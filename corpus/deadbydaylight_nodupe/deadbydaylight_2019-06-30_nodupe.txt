I'd switch Huntress and Clown

Yea especially during free weekend you have all the new people who download it

The dark times
---
This is my exact list to the ‘t’.  Even with how subjective these lists are, I like where your mind’s at.
---
The only reason is put Hillbilly above Spirit is because he requires not alot of skill and he doesn't need Add-ons to win while spirit is very skill based and may need a boost to win against a swf while hillbilly doesn't. Doc, Clown,Pig are above legion because Legion 1, can't end chases quickly 2, stop survivors from dropping pallets and  window vaults or 3, stop generator progression and kill people with it plus pretty good lunge distance with the dash.
---
So your argument is literally based on nothing but strawmen assumptions? Hopefully you atleast understand internally that you're just embarrassing yourself by calling everyone who beats you trash, everyone who disagrees with you trash, and assumes that everyone is intentionally trying to ruin your games rather than you just not enjoying the game.
---
She doesn’t have proper parenting, just cause she kills people doesn’t mean she knows everything education can offer. She kills because that’s what her mother did
---
I will never understand how anyboby can put Billy in the same tier as Nurse and above Spirit. For me Billy is literally the easiest killer to loop almost every time I play against Billy i bully him on the other hand half-decent Spirit and Nurse fuck me up in no time.
---
pretty Ok, except that for some reason Legion is below Wraith? whats that?
---
Teachable Perk 2: Coffe and Contemplation
---

---
When you spawn in the map, a 30/25/20 seconds cool down starts. Within the cool down, you are affected by the “Contemplating” status which makes every action 5% slower but makes every teammate’s action in a 16/24/28 meters 10% faster.
---
“Morning is just for coffee and contemplation... I SAID coffe and contemplation...” - Chief Hopper
---
Ghost Face has the ability to turn off his terror radius and redstain. In some situations he doesn't even need to get stalk off with an ability like that. If you can start snowballing with him he's great.  
---
Plague on the other hand has that stipulation of "Please let me use my ranged ability" which isn't always consistent but usually for the better. Most survivors won't cleanse because they know playing a No Mither game against an M1 Killer is better than giving her the ranged down. Which is where she gets really powerful. But you can very easily play around her if none of the survivors cleanse, and the build-up for her vomit to break the survivors takes entirely too long without addons. She's not terrible but at best she's a worse Huntress.
---
No no no, I said "if," not "until," there's a difference. He doesn't even know what range addons look like on nurse, so it's a really big "if."
---
Camping is in ALL ranks these days. People just don't know how to take a loss tbh. If you run into this situation again just go do gens. I don't see the point in giving a lazy killer the 4k.
---
Your username explains it all
---
It doesn’t matter what takes more skill. Isn’t a tier list about which one is more effective? A good spirit is better than a good billy. SWF destroys Billy and anybody who can loop can destroy Billy while you can’t do much against a good spirit. 
---
Legion gets a free first hit. 
---
Doc’s power shuts down unsafe loops and helps you find people, aka doesn’t shut down actual good loops. Pig has RNG to slow the game down with an ambush that doesn’t get you a free first hit, AND it doesn’t shut down loops. And clown only makes someone throw a pallet down sooner. Oh, and none of these three killers gets a free hit and none of them end chases faster due to having to get them two times. 
---
Whatever you think though.
---
In fact, to add on to this, here’s some of the changes.
---
DS was nerfed.
---
Exhaustion now no longer recovers while running. Making no more double procs in a chase.
---
Hag was buffed. (Cube)
---
Trapper was buffed. (Cube)
---
Wraith was buffed. (Cube)
---
Nurse remained the same, so did billy.
---
Huntress had axe charge speed nerfed.
---
Myers is the same.
---
Doctor was buffed. (Cube)
---
Later killer’s took fat L’s though @Freddy
---
Double pallets were removed aside from bugs.
---
No more pallet vacuum. This is a MASSIVE deal.
---
Window generation is much more restricted.
---
Brand New Parts got annihilated. Rightfully so, but still.
---
Ebony mori DID NOT get a second nerf like brand new part did.
---
Self care was nerfed.
---
NOED was buffed, though only slightly.
---
Ruin was buffed, though only slightly.
---
Only survivor gains was from flat out new content, like MoM which got nerfed; or from some change which was almost immediately reverted.
---
Only solo Q buff was seeing obsession..... for 3 years they’ve been stepped on from killer buffs to combat ridiculous SWF, and that’s ALL they got. No totem counter, no anything else, just that.
---
Gruesome gateau’s 103% - Bloody Party Streamers 100% =3%. Might want to check your maths next time before looking like the idiot.
---
If you read his reply comment to me below, you’ll see his “thought out” explanation of this.
---
i counter with this https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c72ca7/humiliation_100/
---
Thank you so much! I'm glad you can see why I'm so excited about it!
---
We found jörgen :’(
---
Wait, is this actually legit?
---
Shall we dance?
---
He turns to you
---
EXPOSED
---
Thatd not a pillow thats a mattress
---
And so naughty, I would wait by every pallet for the doctor to just come and shock away
---
Hardware store map first. Two birds getting stoned for ghostface and ash.
---
I do agree Ghostface has great mindgame potential and having the ability to make his red stain terror radius great and the snowball potential but in my experience it's really easy to kick him out of the stealth if he doesn't have the range reduction Add-ons and once they know it's a Ghostface they will be very aware just making him a M1 killer . I do agree that Plague is easily counterable but I feel having the ability to one shot survivors is still pretty damn good and I actually prefer them not cleansing but I think I rated her a little high but there is no B- tier so yeah.
---
Idc what anyone says that would be awesome
---
I know, but this is more than I prepared for
---
Agreed! I think he'd be fun to play as.
---
He’s okay he just is incredibly powerful in low ranks so they kinda leave him alone until they can find a way to buff him that will only really affect high ranks so he can be more viable
---
[removed]
---
Better than everyone else? Still projecting?
---
FOUR!
---
Well let me explain, without repeating myself word-for-word: This is not profiting of the deaths of the victims, and it this is not glorifying Jack the Ripper. It would be a bit strange to place a killer in some form of media, without referencing what they did. 
---
As previously mentioned, there was a dlc for Jack the Ripper in AC Syndicate. In that game (and franchise) the primary focus is to kill specific people at most, and kill random guards and/or enemies at least. Not to mention, it is called *Assassin’s* Creed. I have nothing against that franchise, matter of fact, it’s one if my favorite game series, mainly because it based off of historical events.
---
Omg how are you gonna do that?
---
Wraith has a boost of speed when he uncloaks making him able to catch up and hit them and get into a Chase giving him the advantage and he has pretty good damn add-ons to uncloak faster and being able to sneak up on people. Legion just has the ability to stab multiple people but if they miss once they get kicked out. Of their ability and has to wait for it to recharge while wraith does not
---
I'm right here my man
---
Lmao, don't you know what tiers lists are? Following your logic, Billy should be above nurse too, since he is much easier to play with
---
You ignored my reply earlier so thought I’d inform him.
---
That kill is perfect for humiliating lol
---
2v8 would be amazing. It would be very frustrating because 90% of the time you would just get smacked by both killers at once. But the game makes me mad all the time anyway so I would still play it.
---
Oof why you gotta do that to my thicc lad like that
---
Doc has a weird electro hat
---
i meant he didnt crop
---
I wasn't ignoring it I was goin to respond to it
---
How come theirs isn't taken down :o
---
what if i just keep running because i already know the killers going to break it instantly anyways, so i get a bunch of distance and maybe even lose them
---
I believe Nurse is pretty damn easy to play after a few matches in my opinion
---
Playing killer is more repetitive than survivor, since as survivor you don't get to pick who you are versing. Unless you're playing survivor at rank 1, then in this case is repetitive for both :p
---
Lmfao the Entity did not like your teabags.
---
cause i doubt the mods will bother unless you get spiteful or something
---
Ghostface and legion are too low, Billy isn't better than spirit
---
Keep running if you want or drop it on the killer, just hope they don’t have spirit fury.
---
I’m talking about all killers in general they get fucked by survivors with teamwork. The game can’t require any sizable amount of teamwork because they have no chat or voice system along with much information being unknown to each individual survivor. However because of this, just having a discord with a team can abuse all of these to at least save you from taking perks that alert fellow survivors of certain things going on and at best just literally win you the game because you have access to information that you aren’t meant to have with how the game is designed.
---
Got called cheap, toxic, and  racial slurs today because i used Bloody Coil and Honing stone with Ruin and Thrill of the Hunt and trapped windows, pallets, and hooks. Like a trapper.
---
Guess they hate me xD
---
Why does this feel so heartfelt and touching
---
Because you're not meant to know exactly which way the killer is going right after they hook someone.
---
rip it'll be okies pat pat
---
tho, there was one nice guy in that match, which even agreed that they were doing mistakes. shoutout to them, you are amazing
---
Yea I don't know why I brought skill up in a tier list so I'll give my explanation here. I feel hillbilly is better then Spirit because he can go across the map fast, down survivors in 1 shot with a chainsaw and destroy pallets instantly while spirit has to wait for her ability to recharge can't go across the map fully and can't instantly destroy pallets I do believe she is a great killer but not S tier she is probably A+ tier though and for legion I only based my experience off of what I seen from the patch and I can't really make a fair judgement on him so I just put him in D tier and this is all opinion so I can't judge if you disagree
---
Sometimes maybe good, sometimes maybe shit.
---
Actually a great list. Hard to argue. Maybe move the plague up a little? Trapper isn’t as bad as most say. 
---
Otherwise, yeah.
---
Mmm, no. Those games/movies focused on other things as well as JtR's kills. This game focuses solely on killing people.
---
Not to mention that all of the other killers are fictional, who have never hurt anyone. JtR was a real person who killed real people. Period.
---
Don’t teabag
---
Mr. 40 bugs in B tier ? I don't think so.
---
Game scares me too
---
New York is a fucking ICON.
---
How tf dcs against myers?
---
Is it a favourite past time of yours to make a fool of yourself on a public forum, or just a recent hobby?
---
The first pic, though....me gusta.
---
Plague ... you could make a case about her.
---
But Trapper is straight up garbage without purple/red add-ons, he's the most add-on reliant killer in the game.
---
Are you trying to tell me that he's less bugged than Huntress, whose hatchets can literally phase through a survivor? The same Huntress who has 110% movement speed, needs to manually refill her power, AND literally announces her presence with a lullaby?
---
I don't include green/purple/red add-ons in my tier list.
---
I disagree about that Ghostface is too low however for legion I haven't played them that much after the patch so I'm making a judgement of what ive seen of them. the reason I rated Ghostface so low is he so damn add-on dependent with his ability and can easily get taken out of stealth if the Survivors are decent,  once they know it's Ghostface they will be more aware. The reason Hillbilly is above Spirit is his chainsaw doesn't have to recharge, can go across the map, instadown Survivors, destroy pallets quickly, and can go to generators fast making him pretty good at 3 genning but spirit is still great.
---
He would be awesome. Hes gotta say HERES JOHNNY when he finds someone in a locker.
---
You've gotta be one of the worst rank 1 killers in Dead by Daylight. Jesus man. And so unaware of what you're even saying/who you're saying this stuff to. A lot of people here don't play 3 blink, ruin nurse and still 4k consistently. Can't wait when they nerf her add ons so it's actually a bit of a challenge to play nurse.
---
Okay, I don't do it often but that one was obligatory after the David play.
---
Right? I do this literally all the damn time and I still end up getting flamed by them too. Like, gurl, you didn't notice I downed your friend who's on their last hook 30+ times and let him go? You didn't notice that I was running tf away from the hook anytime someone was on it? Can't cure other people's ignorance, I guess. :/
---
Oh god......
---
They’re multiplying
---
It’s a joke loosen up baby :3
---
What about clown tho
---
I think I need to call my therapist now
---
Yeah, he'd probably never get close to red ranks, whoever he is.
---
Yeah, I agree. It's amazing when it works, but what usually happens is I either win the game before gens pop, or they all go out immediately. Maybe Whispers or Nurses Calling instead of blood warden.
---
Hey, are there any still left?
---
But then people start posting hatches.
---
Gimme the basement and I have a dream! 
---
I wish he was better, but he’s so fun and one of the few scary killers to go against. I have trap PTSD after a match and going against another killer.
---
If the clown can put on the ghostface costume and have it not rip, he gets added
---
He'd be cool with me. But what would his power be? And instead of stomping on the pallets he should chop through em.
---
Kinda. I do actually think you are correct though and spirit is better then hillbilly or on the same level for the tier list part i did play every killer besides the new legion for Abit then tried it out and found a little too weak. Glad we are having a civil discussion though
---
Some offerings allowed killers to play characters they didn't own without perks. However, survivors somehow got hold of them, and could use them to force the killer into a different character without perks, regardless of whether they owned them or not.
---
Fair, but she isn't a child in an adults body. 
---
She is smart enough to be considered an adult, albeit one who knows nothing of our society.
---
Only Bubba players who don't camp... I have mained both of these killers at one point though, I somehow how 4Ks as a non-camping Bubba, praise me
---
But a lot of Spirits run devour hope because they know survivors are going to think they have haunted grounds. 🗿
---
"Just git gud killer stop whining the game is balanced"
---
I remember the forums and chat too lol, at least "duuuuude" and "baby killer" and all that shit didnt exist back then.
---
No dissing the other ghostfaces, just saying only one of em is breathing rn
---
Yeah haha he's not a gamer like us. O O F
---
But you can have both.
---
The BNP was also changed to only consume itself, not the whole toolbox.
---
In essence you're trading one addon slot for a (practically) instant 25% completion on a generator. Id call the current BNP still very strong.
---
Dun be sad smol piggy
---
Thats what he gets for having no mother
---
Garbage post
---
someone let me know aswell
---
What dlc Survivors do you not have?
---
Good job man. Hope some people's negativity doesn't discourage you to continue playing. People get way overly serious about this game.
---
To make it worse, they have remember me and spammed hit the obsession to max and have butter murmur so they know where everyone is going in the first 5 seconds
---
All of them
---
Oh that's *fucked*
---
Adam's cosmetics should change what the pebble looks like.
---
Yes, objectively stomping every single game and only "losing" to hatch escapes but I'm still bad because I play nurse, got it.
---
I'm fully aware of who I'm responding to. I wasn't using range addons but it was stated as a matter of fact that I was. Is it unfair to assume that someone is a bad player if they can't actually tell what addons were being used but still condescendingly comments on them? I don't think so.
---
“Legion is basically a one shot killer”
---
Legion, the killer who can stab you multiple times with his power and it just tickles you. The killer who can’t track scratchmarks OR blood while in his power. Legion, the “get a first hit in with your power if the survivor is braindead” killer?
---
 That Legion?
---
The old hook animations...
---
Maybe even the maze and you gotta escape the maze with him chasing after you. I honestly would love this!
---
uh sure?
---
Laurie for the perks and Ash for funzies, Adam second after Laurie because his perks are fun too
---
Yeah, new players don't really know how to deal with each killer's power, so I think some of them think of it as bullshit instead of just how the game is played.
---
It has happened to me a couple times in red ranks. You need to get a certain number of hooks more than the actual sacrifices.
---
When did they say they would fix totem spots again? Like they don’t have to be like finding Waldo level kind of hard but they shouldn’t be out in the damm open especially next to gens
---
Just looking at the bugs creates another bug. A day in the life of a DbD programmer.
---
Not gonna lie, if this guy was in the game, I wouldn't use anyone else...
---
...aside from Ash, that is.
---
This is why when i see people complaining about swf i cant empathize.
---
Probably because spine chill can affect anything you work on, whereas the others only affect 1 action each
---
I actually had this happen a few times today as killer. Feels neutral man.
---
The devs wont change it its probably in the name of "balance"
---
Yeah but Legion doo doo

No, I'm complaining that survivors can completely circumvent an add on that takes 80% of the game to be used, requires a specific build to be usable, by jumping into a locker.
---
Read the post next time.
---
Tbh moris still need to be pulled in, i suggested ages ago a balance but everyone hated it.
---
Cypress  - dont need a hook but still last survivor
---
Ivory - need 1 hook
---
Ebony - double hook needed to sacrifice
---
Pair that with better gen times and better emblem/point rewards for them and i think it would be a good balance, ebonys have always ruined a game.
---
I read it your mad that you can't insta kill someone who has never been hooked.
---
Release
---
Oh. Well she still feels good to me. Get that first survivor with the trap and you just keep em off the gens.
---
Don't get mad at me, but this picture isn't ringing any bells... who is this guy?
---
I've heard about this European heat wave you guys have going on.  Its odd because to us Americans it just sounds like summer.
---
Odd fact.  With all the global warming talk the island I live on has actually had a reverse experience.   We recieve more rain, cooler temps and generally more pleasant weather.
---
To this point we have only hit the 90s once which isn't bad at all.  
---
I have no clue what mainland USA is experiencing though.
---
nice one i saw that
---
Have you ever actually tried to use the add on?
---
Against good survivors, you sacrifice 80% of the game to try to get an insta kill. The fact that after that sacrifice, survivors can still null it completely by jumping into a locker is ludicrous.
---
Hat
---
Lmao 😂😂
---
At least you can admit to not playing legion much, which seems to be the case in most tier lists. 
---
Play him. You’ll see he’s much better than before and at least Plague tier.
---
Not teabagging now huh? Get outplayed fool
---
Poor thing 😭 but seriously what the hell happened to that horse o. O
---
Ward
---
*teabags*
---
yeah, i hate it when thwy fix 7 bugs now have 34
---
It looks like that guy is about to kiss the totem😂
---
uhhh, maybe they meant LTP, (learn to play), but are so dysfunctional they couldn't shorthand text it right?
---
yup.

Lmaoo Lockers OP, but just pull them out and drop them far away from a locker. But seriously lockers is the only way a survivor can counter a tombstone myers
---
That's up to you my guy, I thought it was funny, maybe others will think so too.
---
I get it if it's not your cup of tea.
---
Run back in then run back out again
---
This makes sense to me but I feel there would be a better way to go about it like just highlight the hook for example and lose the circle. There has been plenty of times where I’ll hop off a gen and hide nearby for the unhook, the circle shows up then all the sudden Meyers or another low terror radius killer is right next to me cus I couldn’t see him well enough to move out of line of sight. I am extremely doubtful that it is ‘so you can’t see where the killer is going’ and ‘just getting closer to the hook’ doesn’t help at all
---
Rango was an awesome movie
---
Heyyy, wouldcha look at that, it's farmer John. The man with the beautiful voice who drinks coffee a lot
---
Law dictates that one must play Fuze during a Hostage Match
---
I've mained freddy ever since I started playing this game.   
---
  
---
Also fuck yeah Rango
---
When you're trying to farm point but all these assholes just kill each other and then rage at you after the game is over
---
I’m talking from a “someone got trapped, the trapper wins against someone” scenario
---
Spirit already has that
---
Coulda sworn I replied to you but I think it bugged out and made it a normal comment. Mind looking for it so you know what I responded with?
---
Ya, killer queues are bad rn
---
Sucks to be you, I play doctor. That shit ain't even real.
---
"Omg! The Killer saw me from the other side of the map! I better throw that god pallet down to buy me some time. "
---
I just run Franklin’s demise cause I’ve had enough
---
Oh I know Im just saying his model and cosmetics look very cool plus his prestige is probably the second best (right next to Aces)
---
I've been getting matches pretty fast today like in 2-3 minutes compared to 10-15 that was just couple days before.
---
Do you actually understand what a Tombstone Myers is?
---
How can you have "faster stalk" add ons, when the only two add on slots are going to be taken up? Unless you mean Tombstone piece, but even then, the counter is to just wait out the EW3.
---
Why would you bring Bamboozle to a Tombstone build? That seems pretty silly.
---
Ah yes, the Spirit Fury/Enduring build, which can be soft countered by throwing down every third pallet if you suspect killer has it.
---
I've literally told you how to counter Tombstone Myers. Stay out of his line of sight while your teammates genrush the shit out of him. At red ranks, a Tombstone Myers will be destroyed.
---
Currently trying to learn nurse and tragically don’t have franklins on her yet. So baby nurse growing pains coupled with overpowered survivor add ons which is making matches super enjoyable.
---
Don’t worry dwight, leave the killer distraction to me, you do you man
---
Signed, nea cuntson
---
I’m a Doctor Main and I can confirm this is completely healthy
---
that loadout for a private match? do you hate your friend or yourself?
---
Original vid?
---
Umm... what exactly do you think DBD is?
---
A killer chosen from a pool hunts survivors with specific attributes to please an otherworldly entity...
---
Sounds exactly like the plot of Cabin in the Woods
---
Can't relate, would genuinely love to face Ghostface right now.
---
Be the Dwight main you’re meant to be!
---
meh, just make a few balancing adjustments and it'll be fine.
---
That’s me man, took it today at my local comic fest.
---
I don’t mean to come off as abrasive or aggressive dude, rest assured its nothing directed at you.
---
I had a Legion frenzy stab me twice just today when I was playing.
---
Its not a guaranteed first hit, especially if you’re not running Monitor &amp; Abuse. The 32m terror radius gives survs plenty of time to duck you.
---
And beyond that, the power is useless. A hindrance to use in chase and a minor inconvenience for survivors at best. People praise the 115 all the time for Legion after the nerf, as if its some kind of special instead of the standard.
---
Legion is Freddy tier. The rework saw to that. The nerfs were inconsistent and not thought out, which resulted in complete overkill. Why remove their ability to track blood in Frenzy if you effectively stopped the moonwalk exploit already with the terror radius mending change? Why make their vaulting speed slower if stabbing a survivor in frenzy who already has deep wounds does nothing? My Legion is P3L50 with almost every killer perk and I rarely touch them anymore now.
---
Yes I’ve played and went against a tombstone Myers. It’s not fun going against just to get deleted out of the game because your potatoes teammates fed him t3 and popped it on you. Stop being entitled to every 4K or whatever because someone is hiding in a locker so they won’t get removed off the map.. just move on to the next game lol ...
---
So much fun. Equip BBQ and zoom around! He’s the only killer where you can have a 1 kill or zero kill game and still have fun. Nurse and spirit are stronger.
---
Pretty sure this is against the rules to post
---
That wasn’t BHVR, that was all the entity
---
And what about never ending pallets, not a single way to prevent gens from being done, basical inability to use killers powe against slightly skilled survivors, instant grabs as killers from. The lunge range on uninjured person vaulting windows? This game had a lot more nasty things that are now buried in history, so just get over it, it's for greater good
---
I play legion so it isn’t much of a problem for me either. Especially if I use iridescent button.
---
It pisses me off when I stay a second so the killer can hit me and get som points, but I miscalculated my possition and don't make the exit when I go down. It really hurts when you get killed by the person you were trying to help out. And in the end, I only have myself to blame and this is so frustrating.
---
Actually, and this must be a problem with the wording, it INCREASES the missed attack cooldown. Meaning it lasts longer. You get more range but if you miss you’re punished.
---
Merman duh....
---
Fishing for whining killer likes here but completely flopped
---
Steve Harrington or we riot
---
We aren't getting him, because the cabin is too much of a parody for being a dlc
---
Doing gens. You?
---
His bees could sting the shit out of them making them run funny while screaming.
---
Yea i got 180 seconds with hag today... Not easy
---
Survs can find and keep items + addons, so it kinda balances it out.
---
Game's currently Killer favored if the Survivors don't know how to play the game and are uncoordinated.
---
If the Survivors know how to play the game and are coordinated though, then yeah it's in their favor against most Killers.  But it really does depend on the Killer and then the addons can make a notable difference in some cases as well.
---
You're a garbage human
---
yes stridor counters iron will
---
Today it was pretty good for me to find killer matches compared to the last days from 10-20 minutes down to like 1-5 minutes
---
No, it doesn't. Only if it's not iron will 3
---
I have iron 3 but jake was still moaning
---
I'm glad we got a pro-ana killer.
---
It’s literally the killer/survivor vfx
---
I swear this shit gets reposted every damn day
---
Thank you! And yes I can understand because when I first got P1 I was so excited too.
---
There's nothing they can do about that though. If you balance the game around voice comms then solo survivors get fucked extra hard.
---
Exactly, queuing is already 5 mins, might as well start it searching
---
Had a game like this during the last blood hunt. I never intended to kill anyone, just hook them twice, then make it clear I'm going to farm.
---
I'm doing well, and they're dropping like flies. I got a Claudette and a Meg hooked twice. Then it comes to Kate. I throw her on her second hook, then walked away. I was over the other side of the map chasing someone else, and suddenly she gave up the struggle with plenty of time left.
---
Since the others have already been on the hook twice, when I next down them, I carry them to gens and let them struggle free. They pretty quickly realise I'm farming and we have a merry time each getting over 20k points.
---
Then in post game chat, that Kate who gave up struggle says the following:
---
"Fucking rat, why did you farm with them and not me? Reported"
---
Then the other survivors all called her out for giving up on the struggle.
---
Ok? I've had brand new parts I've never been able to use and purple toolboxes and purple keys. It happens.

I do a very sneaky Freddy. 
---
I use monitor and abuse, pop goes the weasel, nurses calling, and bbq and chilli. I used to do endgame Freddy with more REMEMBER me pop goes the weasel and blood WARDEN  but remember me nerf. On the sneaky Freddy I would switch out monitor and abuse or nurses calling for furtive chase if you can but keep pop goes the weasel cause if you get enough hooks it's basically hex:ruin without being able to take down and bbq and chilli for extra bloodpoints and finding distant survivors.
---
I'm so happy to see another prestiged Freddy. 
---
When that rework comes in we'll be on top buddy
---
Ghostface is a really cool killer. If we had Pinhead and the killer from the Scream movies and then I'd be pretty content with licensed killers
---
Ah, I was wondering when you'd try to compare those.
---
You see, as I've said many times, the difference is you don't have to spend 80% of the game trying to get those things to DO something.
---
I think jumping into lockers are fine I’m not sure why you’re being upset that survivors are trying to survive ?
---
lots of practice and muscle memory
---
Billy in S tier whilst spirit is in A 
---
Yikes
---
Instead of new characters, here is a list of changes I'd rather see in the game:
---
-2 killer 8 survivor or 4 killer 16 survivor gamemode (preferably the latter)
---
-slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously all getting changed to their actual values (instead of "tremensously increases movement speed" we'd get "increases movement speed by 80%)
---
-all weaker perks getting adressed and given a slight buff (won't go over them here)
---
-operation health: taking a season off to fix some of the code as to give less problems in the future
---
-bunnygirl feng, just because
---
It’s fun to play against a corrupt purge plague IMO. Either way, the ranged attack isn’t that amazing.. it gives you a speed boost when hit.
---
I've explained to you why it's irritating and makes little sense throughout this whole thread. Perhaps reading comprehension isn't your strong suit?
---
Right because you are the first one found and you get camped and tunneled you spend 100% of your game not being able to use them. And your game is only 3 minutes long.
---
I am very excited for the rework. Although I don’t play Freddy for his power as much as I do just to be Freddy. I’m currently working on leveling my doctor for the first time to get M&amp;A it seems really good.
---
True, but I personally would way prefer to have more bloodpoints since with the extra points you can get more items and add ons
---
He’s taking off his shirt 😩
---
Groovy
---
i'm sorry but when you're trying to go for a specific build, you should be aware that you need a viable perk build and a map offering too. i succeeded every time by using PWYF, Corrupt Intervention, Monitor and Whispers/Discordance with Azarov's key/Jigsaw Piece offerings where survivors have a hard time hiding behind objects to deny your stalking and nah, you allow them to "genrush" you since they 100% know you have those add-ons if you don't try to hook or at least slug survivors.
---
Ghostface not being garbo + anniversary event = longer Killer queues.
---
Also because of the Wake Up bugs more and more Killers seemed to be playing like sweaty assholes so that probably turned off a good portion of people queuing Survivor.
---
Eh? Have you seen how many lockers there are in the map? They're not exactly difficult to get to.
---
You're still completely ignoring the basic fact that them jumping in the locker completely negates Tombstone.
---
Not really a free win, when any decent survivor will be genrushing while I'm trying to gain EW3.
---
Am I supposed to be pleased that, oh boy, I get to unhook a survivor after they jumped in the locker. What a fun, interactive experience! Oh, except I could do exactly that by playing regular Myers.
---
I tried that
---
Literally looks like the doctor
---
Wait you guys are getting matches?
---
You come with me little bastard
---
David's new cosplay lookin' fresh
---
Why cant this happen to me lmao
---
Agitations not very good imo I'd swap that sloppy butcher
---
You've really gone far off topic there, mate.
---
My issue isn't with GETTING to EW3, because that's a fun challenge. The payoff is meant to be being able to insta mori any survivor you find. My issue is that the payoff for the challenge is circumvented by something as simple as jumping into a locker.
---
Out of interest, what rank did you play Tombstone Myers at, because I invite you to try it at red ranks.
---
mood!
---
i used the bugs to destroy the bugs

I just love Ash, so even if my face isn’t as chiseled as our god Bruce Campbell, I still wanted to go as him.

Ashy Slashy is the best!
---
It wasn’t about game balance it was just too difficult to do multiple versions of a map for every level of moonlight. So all the newer maps have no moonlight variations.
---
If it wasn't for the broken hand, this would've been a pretty good creepy screenshot.
---
Lies. You can say it won’t work for the 10000 different reasons it won’t but don’t pull shit like that out of your ass to fit your agenda. People said the same thing about the devs never adding a Clown killer and looky where we are now. One of the only few things I’ve seen the devs officially knock is killers that are financial and technical hell like giant spiders.
---
Drops pallet, spends 1 turn
---
grab them from the lockers, if they don't wiggle, go somewhere where lockers are non-existent (or an area where you can block them) and dribble them. if they do, just hook them, not every damn strong add-on need to be extremely broken like prayer beads are. i'm at rank 7 but that doesn't matter, it's the fact that i'm trying to tell you that add-on is a high risk/high reward. sorry but Myers at red ranks with THOSE add-ons it's not meant to win, all i can say in this situation is for you to de-rank if you wanna try fun builds or to stop and actually use what's viable if you don't wanna get destroyed

If people stream, they should expect to get sniped.
---
I never said shit I just pointed out how you knowingly straight up lied to shut someone up rather than provide valid reasons for why it wouldn’t work. You should be expressing these points to the OP not me. My name is just a meme chief.  Besides if they ever decided to make a chapter like this I guarantee they’d find a way to work around the height or else people would riot.
---
Nice one. Really got me with a meme pic
---
They've always been long comparably to most other games. Evolve a (bad) game that had a very symmetrical style of play never had the issue of finding lobbies for either party before the entire player base dissipated. Killers at any rank shouldn't be having such a tough time finding matches no matter if there's an event or not. I don't know why they couldn't just overhaul gens and the likes when they clearly have the competence to successfully overhaul something like the end game.
---
Most 115 killers have powers that aren't usually a complete hindrance. Except Bubba. Legion only gets everyone injured if everyone was together at once. That rarely ever happens. He has to power hit them, which is basically a slightly speed-boosted M1 hit, and then get another M1 if he hasn't lost them. Legion injuring everyone just doesn't happen often anymore, especially since people started healing against them.
---
Woo!

You've got the clothes down pretty well! I'm planning to cosplay Young Ash at some point in the near future, and I hope I can do it justice!

That Clown and Pig look badass too! Bravo all around!

I'll still take it over nurse destroys the entire team in the first minute.

Thanks! Hope yours goes well, I know it will!

The only issue I have is the hair, honestly. I dye it black so that isn’t a problem, but it is v e r y curly, and long — so I had to tie it back and style the front. Wasn’t perfect, but it got the job done!
---
Happy cosplaying to you, friend!! Stay groovy!
---
Jigsaw, that you?
---
Is that a little pig or are you two just giant
---
I play both sides and I still can't believe the wait time for killers is like this...
---
Can ya please shut the fuck up. You know for a fact they did not stop spreading misinformation. If you don’t want him fair enough but just stop with the bullshit.
---
Pffft, little pig! His daughter, I think!
---
Omg that's adorable

Yeaah, I'm kinda lucky that my face and hair don't look too dissimilar from Campbell.

Your hair looks fine for the cosplay man, definitely got the job done!
---
You stay groovy too, my friend!

True, but I will still not accept she has knowledge of what things like thicc would even mean, the huntress body pillow will forever be sus to me
---
Not that many people played him tho? Played a week after his release and only fought one of two in the few hours a day I've been playing every other day in this game. Awesome killer, awesome design, cool cosmetics for a licensed killer, but his ability is really not fun to use most of the time. Most gen placement really cock block his stalk. I recently started playing some killer again because I bought him, and he just feels like he ends up using his stalk power to get a free m1 hit, rather than the insta-down.  He also gets screwed over if you use object of obsession or he's against an swf.  I still think I plan on playing him often, but man is he just weak.

Yea I get mad, but at myself.
---
I uninstalled the game the second I saw the bloodweb.  Why hasn't the game been patched in a way that it would remove the web entirely?  How does it make sense that this should be like this after all that time STILL?
---
That's kind of on you, man. It sucks, but you probably should have just gone through it rather than uninstall.
---
How would they even know whose bloodwebs they'd need to refresh? If they refreshed everybody's, then people would be pissed that they lost a good perk or add on or item.
---
They just don't touch bloodwebs, and since it's easy enough to just move to the next level, that's likely for the best.
---
Changes to the blood web often dont affect the current web and only apply starting next level. Uninstalling would not affect this. Just complete that web and you should never see it again.
---
Once Freddy gets reworked it'll be legion tipping bubba

Replace saying with "oh for fucks sake"

Not like it matters. They catch you 20 seconds after decisive anyway.

ehhhhhhhh 🤠👉👉
---
So I'm expected to finish upgrading a web that, as I was told, is old enough to have stuff that is no longer in the game?  For KILLER perks, no less, on a survivor? lol
---
They would know because I made multiple attempts to contact them with this information, going through their support and making a ticket, but all my calls for help went ignored.
---
As I said, the fix is incredibly simple. Level up.
---
Not to sound inconsiderate, but it seems like you've used a sledgehammer for a tiny nail here.

**SURVIVOR FOUND**
---
WHERE?!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/c6wfp6/tester_vs_developer/
---
Take this one too, I got the other one here somewhere
---
In solo queue games you are really rolling the dice on if you will win, but if every survivor just did generators and left the game would last at most like 3-4min. 80 seconds per generator if each survivor found a gen with in 30 seconds except for 1 who would be getting chased 3 gens are done in less than 2 min. Take another 2 min or less to finish the other 2 generators and boom. Now this is given that the person being chased could keep a chase going for 4 min and that is killer and map dependent but most of the time if it isn’t a small map and you are not facing a nurse/billy looping a killer for that long shouldn’t be too difficult if the survivor doesn’t make any mistakes.
---
The point of me saying that is the only reason death rates are low is because survivors are not doing the objective 24/7. They mess around they make mistakes in chase there are a lot of things. Basically if every survivor suddenly decided they would go as tryhard as an ebony mori omega blink nurse the escape rates would be at least over 75% in most games. Also given that the map is not small and they aren’t against a good nurse.
---
I wasn't asking you for a fix.  The fact that it's still like this and they expect me to waste blood to finish the web is absurd.
---
I mean yeah you just deal with it I mean it’s sucks for sure but they can’t do much with this just do a daily or two and knock it out the park and chances are this won’t happen again
---
I see you've discovered sassy gay Myers.
---
Then what exactly ARE you asking for with this post? If you're gonna wait for BHVR to patch the game for an issue that only YOU are currently experiencing, you're batshit crazy.
---
Wtf. So u could pop 4 gens immediately with 4 brand new parts?

Trapper in F, Clown in F, Doc in D. Are you okay?

Judging by your flair, you're a Doctor main. Next time you see them, run Distressing, Coulrophobia, Unnerving, Overcharge, Purple and Yellow calm addons, and a Jigsaw Piece. 
---
Clearly they want to start playing on The Game, and you should oblige.
---
That’s what I have to do apparently.  Nea is my cosmetic main but I finished every other survivor to get the perks and now I’m back on her and this is getting ridiculous lol.

Like they didn’t show up or you couldn’t open them when all the gens were done?

Everything in this game has counter play except highly skilled spirit and nurse mains. Am I supposed to be happy when my ruin is broken? Am I supposed to be happy when I don't get to use an item cause I've been tunneled? Oh I could do that without ruin, or without my item. You aren't special we all get the short end sometimes.

Fact. If it was a Claudette, we wouldn’t be able to see her.

Swamp maps are weird in general. They almost always have a gen touching one of the walls, some tiles with pallets can spawn in the most obscure places and the hatch aseems to appear in some faraway corner a lot.
---
Those eyes...
---
I play killer because it's so insanely easy to get 4k's until high red ranks meanwhile playing survivor is indeed the same monotonous onslaught of ruin/noed matches of top tier killer only rotations. They have nerfed soo many aspects of Survivor the best you can hope for is a couple thousand stun points until you activate spirit fury.

---
The ever-elusive "good survivors". A good killer will 3-4k 80%+ of their public matches, often even with only 1-2 gens done, because most survivors are bad. If they make things even easier, it will only get more boring for competent killers that already are only seldomly challenged. I don't even try too hard as killer, and still only rarely have survivors escape through the exit if I play to win. If I actually camp, slug and tunnel hard and use strong add-ons, I get bored of playing killer really quickly.
---
4 good survivors will also 3-4 escape 80%+ of their public matches, yes, because likewise, most killers are bad. The game is currently well-enough balanced for the average matchup, obviously with some BS items and mechanics and bugs and map elements that should have long been addressed, affecting however both sides. Voice comms are also BS. Either way, I do not agree with the notion that non-max-range Nurse killers don't have "any real control" against a group of good survivors trying to win. It obviously does depend on the killer character and add-ons as well as map, but if you put 5 skilled and experienced players on a server, you do get competitive and challenging games of DbD. There is a relatively active tournament scene in Russia, and they absolutely have some of the best players in the game on both sides. And the games are not 0k fests by any stretch at all.
---
She was like that in game too
---
No he is. He has a doctorate in psychology.
---
Next you’re gonna tell me the nurse isn’t a real nurse, or the pig isn’t a real pig
---
I won’t fall for these *lies*
---
So let me get this straight. A Huntress basement hooks two of your friends and hard camps them, doesn't even move after you finish a gen. Why didn't you just go do the other gens? 
---
What were you hoping to accomplish by lurking near the basement? Some big brain basement rescue? Dude. Just go do the other gens with your friend, and leave. You will never outlast a hard camper like that. 
---
Eventually their basement hooks will either die on hook or suicide, and then it's a 1v2 with 4 gens remaining. Use your head, man.
---
As a huntress main, I must agree
---
Amputations are pretty fun... though, for some reason all my amputation patients try to run away from me

I used the myers to become the myers

i don't think an already weak killer deserves a nerf

Odds of getting what you want on the shrine: -3
---
I am confused.
---
I'd hit it.
---
There is a video of a 2 min 35 game on one of the Autohavens... the killer didn't even find any of the survivors and they got out, so yeah was called a Spare part back then too.
---
Just like whatever is up with Feng!
---
All the Gateau's are making more people want to play killer, since every game is easily 2-4x BP, and you get more points with killer.
---
Same here, that shit makes me mad for no reason
---
This is a repost and yours was a repost, so I mean...
---
Same I didn’t see anything
---
People still play that game?
---
She bites your neck before dragging you out of the locker

What's w Feng?
---
A very handsome and rugged man with a smaller, equally handsome and rugged man!

And Mori'd, tunneled, camped, have ultra rare addons used against them, etc.
---
2v8 wouldn't work without some major modifications to the game. Asymmetrical designs work in small numbers like this 1v4 setting, but the difficulty goes up exponentially for the outnumbered side. 
---
It's a force multiplier issue. A skilled fighter in a hypothetical example might be able to handle 3 opponents of lesser skill. 2 would have much more difficulty handling 6 and 3 would almost definitely be outmatched by 9 unless there were some serious handicaps in place or an extreme skill gap.
---
I just don't see how a 2v8 in this game could be fun or competitive for the killer side. It would be near impossible for 2 players to cover and keep covered that much ground and that many objectives if the survivors were even remotely competent.
---
She looked the same to me
---
Mine was a crosspost. Reposting is just stealing content.
---
lemme suck ur dick homie
---
It is an absolutely acceptable response to NOED. Go grab Small Game and start cleansing those dull totems.
---
If you don't like Small Game, Detective's Hunch is a great substitute.
---
Yeah thats DBD for you. Early game is hell. I reccomend doing both the tutorials and doing the rituals whenever you have them for the BP, and dump that into whichever killer you want to level next. Hopefully you can find some event farm lobbies. 
---
There are some killers that are pretty good without perks, and there are perks you can use to farm BP early game. Hillbilly, Leatherface, and Trapper are pretty good even with base perks. 
---
Distressing is good for farming before you get BBQ, gives you 100% increase to Deviousness BP gains. Trappers traps will give you 2000BP on a trap with Distressing. BBQ+Distressing would give you pretty good BP for chainsaw hits with Leatherface too I imagine.
---
Dude who even are you, I'll have you know i had pinhead sign my profile because he is a literal champion of the realm. Eat a wiener you fool.
---
That's got nothing to do with this, and if anything is shitty logic. Just because a killer is on the weaker side of things, doesn't mean they deserve brokenly OP things. If you have to mend, but also have to snap out of it, you're just dead. No amount of skill can prevent it.
---
Ashy Slashy takes the cake, easily, c’mon.

Two completely different games but ok.
---
rainbow six siege in a nutshell
---
I’m saying its the same video. Its been posted here multiple times in the past week. Even if the title is different or it’s a crosspost, it’s still been posted.
---
Idk how. Most people who have TTV in their name have very few viewers, and it's easy to tell when another person hops in your stream right after a lobby loads up.
---
My life as a killer, those t bags get to me
---
You actually look like her, this cosplay is amazing.
---
Damn did nobody ask
---
Aren’t you just reinforcing that behavior? You don’t have to be mean and use foul language but I still think you should point out that that’s not the way to play.
---
Not to be harsh dude but that Huntress was right. You do need to learn the game. If a killer is camping go do gens and escape, it's not that hard. If you are good with skillchecks you could probably get the last 3 gens done before the people on hook die.
---
I play hag and there's a trap on the other side of that bitch. Have fun ; )

you don’t seem to realize prestige 1 is harder to get than p3.  You have worse bloodwebs and less bloodpoints as a result
---
It's because of all the extra bloodpoints from the event. Give it a while after the event is over and it should settle down. With how many Gateaus you can accumulate though, I feel this one may linger a little longer than most BP events.
---
I know right! Like, your arm is mangled beyond repair; it needs to come off! No, I did not do that myself, it was probably the Hillbilly! Come back!
---
That look in his shiny puppet eyes is tempting, to say the least...

The way he says ‘wanna play’ is hypnotic.

so you couldn't pick her up? You can just go AFK and she will bleed out, takes a couple of minutes. You also can go close the hatch?
---
I may have misread what you said but you weren’t the first. Also, I was only explaining that it’s still a repost because you said it was a crosspost as if that was different. I’ve never even bitched about reposts before but this time I actually saw the original so I understand why people complain about it now.
---
I bought detective tapp because he’s so fucking cool but his perks aren’t that strong
---
DLC pack with the Merman please.
---
I actually just made a post about legion needing some love lol I hope they buff them soon and not in a year
---
You speak of the same company that has gotten many horror icons into their game and has a playerbase that mostly enjoys hearing from them
---
This man is a cheap imitation
---
Honestly, they could just remove NOED instead.  I feel like it would make more sense and overall be healthier for the game.  As a killer main, it doesn't feel good to use and I can't imagine it's any fun to go against.
---
Give us a fucking balanced and fixed game already it's been 3 years.
---
I closed hatch to start end game and grabbed her mid door as endgame ended so to sacrifice her the game auto dropped her but it glitched so it thought I was still carrying her (in the bottom left we're your power would be) and I stood there for ten minutes she didn't bleed out
---
Bold of you to assume I didn’t get slugged and waste my DS.
---
Add a totem counter to small game and never have this conversation again. In a solo game, NOBODY is going to stop working on the last gen to go around counting broken totems.
---
I get the joke, but you’re still a dick. I can completely understand not getting it since the other hexes have the same icon and new players wouldn’t understand that it looks the same as hex ruin.
---
So OP equates having precise timed teamwork with being able to find a poorly hidden totem and easily destroy it while counting a total of five instead of doing literally nothing but rushing the gens, then calls people “ridiculously ignorant”. Totems aren’t hard and don’t take much time OP.
---
 Just. Do. Totems.
---
Halloween 2 was decent but this scene was always a bit silly to me😂. Same as when he just walks through a glass door.

Honey! the baby is crying again!
---
You're hardly going to do what you want all the time.
---
But you really cannot mention the counter to NOED then say there is not counter to it.

Just cleanse totems.

I'd hit that also.

Killers can close hatch now.  Wake Up is glitched and bannable.
---
Haha yep. Was playing against a Billy the other day whom you could clearly tell he had BBQ. Two dead, and I’m working on a gen and see my other teammate in a chase. He gets downed. I immediately get into a locker so as not to show up on BBQ when he geta hooked  . The idiot kills himself on hook as im coming out of the locker , I find hatch. He’s waiting in post game chat to call me a pussy for jumping in the locker. Okay 👌
---
Practice makes perfecf
---
Oh I didn't know behavior had an abbreviation
---
I want baby myers just as bad as shirtless myers.
---
I usually dodge most streamers. Has nothing to do with sniping but MANY of them I've encountered are toxic little shits who teabag at literally every pallet stun, flashlight macro, sabo every hook, pallet blind you every time or even blind you after DSing you, etc.
---
I'm not accusing all DBD streamers of this, but a few bad apples and I usually either dodge, or break out the big guns (Mori, Dr. Worldwide) if I see a streamer.
---
No, because it's a logical fallacy to think it's a counter.  It's not a counter, it's exactly what the killer wants you to do.  There's no skill or outplaying involved at all.
---
And a win for the hook
---
When you go to leave the match you just walk out into the void outside of the map and result screen never triggers. You used to be able to walk back into the match and walk out to trigger but now that doesn't work.
---
bruh
---
That's a good question
---
Don’t take claudette. Self care teaches bad habits. Take Dwight for Bond. It will teach you much more
---
Literally just happened to me today. I saw a totem at the beginning of the match that was lit, but since I tested and knew it wasn't ruin, I decided to leave it there and wait to see if a totem effect came in later. Later that match, me and two Claudette's were working on a gen, when one of them noticed that there was a lit totem. She was determined to break it, even waiting for the killer to go away so she could break the totem. Sure enough, it was haunted grounds, and the spirit found the Claudette and downed her pretty quickly. She proceeded to DC on the down.
---
Thank you so much! I made it myself so that really makes me happy to hear!
---
No, that was mine in the lobby. Then once the game started, it jumped to 500+.
---
&lt;3333
---
That too. Idiots who fail to understand basic mechanics and bitch you out because they're too stupid to realise what you were actually doing.
---
I don’t know but this shouldn’t be a thing. They honestly should set some kind of requirement to filter out anyone who has shit internet. 
---
I checked his profile and I sent him a message. He confirmed he lives in China and apologized for the severe lag.
---
This needs more upvotes
---
I could just counter it, but it takes effort, so nah. Just remove it!
---
Wow that shit was broken. Nothing should give you a free gen.
---
You’re exactly how I imagine Susie would look too. Fuckin gorgeous. Good work 😁
---
Thank you so much!
---
He can be in my hole
---
There is no counter.  Even if you cleanse all the totems, you still did exactly what the perk was intending.
---
But if I bought it, that would support ea, and they're the actual worst.
---
Crouching dosent set her traps off.
---
You can’t mend yourself when you’re going crazy. Ask others to do it. You might hurt yourself
---
Grabbing from windows and pallets only works if they are injured, but you can pull people off a gen at any health state.
---
Just double the gens. It would provide the killers with more time to catch the survivors and the game will exponentially turn to the killer’s side as more survivors die off or are distracted.
---
I hope he would get an icy, frozen skin.
---
I think having his kit revolve around the chase would be good.  
---
Power: **Shine** (I know he did not Shine, but he'd have to have something. Could be described as an evil and corrupt version given to him by The Entity) - While chasing a survivor (for 30 seconds? that's Bloodlust 2 worth of time), Shine charges up. When your charge meter is full, you can activate your power to Shine.
---
While Shine is active:
---
\-You receive a killer instinct notification for every survivor for 5 seconds
---
\-Your terror radius is reduced to 32 meters (from standard radius) for 15 seconds
---
\-The generator with the most progress glows blue
---
\-All pallets, chests, lockers, and totems within your TR are visible to you in blue for 15 seconds
---
\-When any blue object is interacted with, it changes to white for an additional 15 seconds. (only the interacted object remains after the first 15 seconds)
---
Shine must recharge fully after each use. Shine's charge meter degrades slowly for each second not in a chase. When fully charged, Shine does NOT degrade unless you are stunned.
---
Perks:
---
\-**Dull Boy**: Your dedicated hard work leaves you impatient and angry. When bloodlust activates, you also receive a 8/9/10% speed bonus to vault speed, locker checks, and pallet breaks until blood lust ends.
---
\-**Here's Johnny!**: Obstacles that stand between you and your prey make you furious. When interacting with a locker, your interact speed is reduced by 200/150/100% but you damage the locker beyond repair and leave it unusable. You also gain a 2% bonus to movement speed after breaking a pallet or locker for 10/15/15 seconds.
---
\-**I've Always Been Here**: You're devotion to The Entity has gained you certain privileges. When the Endgame Collapse begins, you lose your red stain. In addition, when a survivor escapes, I've Always Been Here gains a token. Each token grants you bonuses:
---
1 Token: All hooks repair and become indestructible -**rank 1 gets from here down**
---
2 Tokens: The hatch reveals itself to you in a blue aura -**rank 2**
---
3 Tokens: All pallets and windows are blocked off by The Entity -**ran 1 perk only gets 3 and 4**
---
4 Tokens: You receive a 2500 blood point "caretaker" bonus -
---
Survivor: 
---
Danny Torrance
---
An adult Danny who has been through enough trauma for a few lifetimes.  
---
\-**Redrum**: You forsee catastrophe in its most grim details. When an ally is downed, all hooks within x/x/x meters (would have to be researched) of the killer are revealed to you. Their sabotage level can be indicated by the intensity of their aura.
---
\-**Danny Isn't Here**: Your terror and pain motivates you to find solace. While injured and upon activation, you can disperse your scratch marks around you slighty/moderately/considerably, making it difficult to discern your path. During this time you do not bleed and make no grunts of pain.
---
\-**The Shining**: Your persistence to escape death is undeniable, even to The Entity. When the exit gates are powered, all totems and traps are revealed to you for 15 seconds. In addition, when the endgame collapse begins, it is extended by an additional 20 seconds (stacks for each survivor using this perk)
---
Don’t go out of your way. Whenever you’re crossing a tile, check the totem spot. If there’s a dull, get rid of it. Totems usually spawn near all 4 corners of the map and the last one is pretty much random. Have fun hunting
---
Keep killing them

The tea bagging is toxic yes but the insta heals and flash lighting isn’t. ( in my opinion of course) the insta heal is just a over power add on ( no different from killers running over powered Add ons)
---
doctor’s shadow looks exactly the same and i hate it
---
Sooo...what?
---
oh ok thats weird
---
Yea, trust me it was a 3 SWF, not name calling since they weren't toxic, just a real unlucky game
---
No I agree. Addons and Items to me are tools like killer addons. T-bagging is asking for it.
---
They already said that they’re not adding more gamemodes because this community isn’t large enough to split. Do you even watch the dev streams? Give this game more time to grow a large enough community to split for more gamemodes. Don’t understand why people keep asking them to make it when they already clarified this. They also plan on adding more objectives for survivor so you should look forward to that in the future.
---
I don’t see anything either after watching multiple times.
---
If you can’t find a survivor when all 4 are on separate gens you deserve to lose.
---
Legit. BHVR doesn’t test anything at all. Their testing team is 3 people who are in green ranks.
---
I ask because I would have put a mori on if I was feeling nervous about a SWF team.
---
You now will understand why 80% of memes and shitposts contain stuff like "BHVR sucks hurr durr" etc
---
Not a waste if some perks are locked behind paywalls of auric cells or (get this) shards!

Thank you for this knowledge
---
Mate 80 degrees is just a Tuesday in US. Europeans wouldn’t survive the 100 degree days we get xD.

every ghostface game i’ve had either contained his purple and ultra rare addons or/and camping. or they just sit somewhere, stalk the hook, then kill both ppl. so i feel that

I like how you shake the camera as if saying WHAT

Might I recommend you cry more, bitch?
---
What about Doofie from Scary Movie? He even escaped at the end
---
Stay mad, stay bad.  :)
---
Once you unlock a teachable it's available to everyone permanently.
---
No they stay as teachables just that all your perks get erased besides those 3
---
From what it looks like both were on hook so that doesnt full count as a sacrifice yet. Techinically you can still use deliverance. Nice play.
---
I actually really like it, if only for the leg pull. I love the leg pull.
---
It's the only killer daily I actually trash can.
---
The killer can just ignore you and he knows guaranteed you'll go down anyway, yeah not OP.
---
Haha yeah, I was in shock because I didn't expect that shot to hit AT ALL. I thought it would hit the tree when I threw it xD

---
Fkin ownedd gz bro
---
Ghost face is the strongest killer because he can tbag
---
No the perk was designed to give the killer a powerful late game, and that's why most killers run it. The time wasting is a secondary effect. Originally NOED wasn't even tied to totems, it was on a timer.
---
Why unerving and distressing?
---
Absolutely, I'm more sad that Pin-Up only got like two minutes of screen time. It really sucked that her two scenes were her death, and a jump scare. It ain't fair.
---
I've always wondered how hot susie would look like....and now I know. Drop dead gorgeous!!!!

You're thinking of crutch perks. Like when you break your leg
---
Claudette: "Have a Juke"
---
I personally prefer brutal strngth. Spirit fury is strong though with brutal you can also speed up the process of kicking gens
---
You right, my bad.
---
Still, gotta have my self care for the small moments of me not pissing off the killer
---
I usually feel pretty safe with Neas in my game. But I’m getting better at looping the killer even using the T walls with windows, no pallets
---
:)
---
Is that a Gorillaz reference :D
---
The effects are quite bad. I know what they were going for but it didn't come off😅
---
Just play meg but get Lithe instead of SB
---
It’s always good to learn how to loop, even if you don’t plan on being an absolute aggro like me
---
Even if you can’t loop for 5 whole gens, survival is key
---
The mask from Halloween 2018 would be so good
---
While pig goes swiggety swooty imma crouch for that booty
---
Manejense vieja
---
So, you disagree, then completely validate my other point about NOED?  In all honesty the majority of killers that run NOED don't even fully understand what it brings to the table, which makes sense because it's largely seen as a crutch perk for bad killers.  It either activates and you win, or the survivors waste time finding and cleansing totems and you win.  But they don't see that, they just see the one hit down.
---
Top Tier shitpost OP

I worked very hard on it, so I'm glad to hear that!! Thank you very very much!
---
Oh shit! My bad.
---
Thank you!! I've made Julie's as well, and intend to make Frank and Joey in the future!
---
Honestly I was thinking more like a points competition so instead of the survivors worrying about escaping to win, they worry about getting points/dicking over the competition to get to the top. Itd take some toxicity off the killer for once and 4 mans wouldnt be a issue if only one could take all
---
~~You flatter me omg~~
---
Tier 1 Myers
---
Well yeah, it’s 16 perks be against 4 perks. If killer perks weren’t at least a little better than survivor it wouldn’t make sense.
---

I always recommend Feng and Doctor as starting characters. Feng has some of the best beginning perks for any survivor. Technician is great to help you get used to the timing of skill checks and make missed skill checks more forgiving. Lithe is my favorite exhaustion perk. It is useful on every map and you are very unlikely to accidentally activate it. Alert is great for tracking killers and also letting you know early who the killer is. (Note if you see nothing when alert triggers it is either Myers or Freddy )
---
I always recommend Doctor as a starting killer not because he is the easiest or most powerful, most high level players have little trouble with him. The reason I think he is great to start with is his power makes survivors scream and reveal their locations. This helps you learn where survivors like to hide quickly and the best hiding places on maps. It can also help you when you play survivor as you will learn new places to hide. 
---
I also strongly recommend doing both tutorials. They are a bit dated but are a good way to learn the base mechanics of the game. If you want to get to the top tier ranks you need to work on leveling David, Claud, Dwight, Nea, and Meg to get their teachables. Their perks are very common in high level plsy. For the killer side learn Billy as he is strongest on console.
---
I very much appreciate it! When I finish her up I'll be sure to post the full body with all the weathered clothes!

I literally was just driving around with Billy around the map with speed limiter, so if I snipe anyone, they wouldn't go down. Sniped two people. Got 13K points.... That's how much points you get as survivor if you escape some times....

This times a thousand. This game can burn you out incredibly easily if you let it. I recommend taking time off from it and coming back later with a clear head. Whether it’s a few hours or a few weeks/months is up to op.

whats funny is that a survivor I use only wake up and find the two others useless and as a killer I dont even care about the survivors’ perks since I just wreck them no matter what.
---
Doctor's passive AOE insanity in treatment mode (Zappy-Mode) is directly linked to his terror radius. If you're in the terror radius and Doctor's in treatment mode madness slowly ticks up over time passively depending on how close he is, even if he's not doing the electro-wave attack. 
---
Since distressing increases your terror radius, it effectively is a direct upgrade for your treatment mode passive insanity AOE. It also gives you deviousness points faster which is a not very important side effect, but it's welcome considering how easy Doc is to earn deviousness with.
---
Doctor also has some addons that increase the terror radius in treatment mode and decrease it in punishment mode (Calm series addons). Call me twisted sick but I love running the purple and yellow calm addons together with distressing for a Dr. Worldwide build, especially if I get Gideon Meat Plant/The Game where your terror radius effectively is the entire map in treatment mode.
---
So we know Doctor benefits from a large terror radius. Because of this, perks that affect people in the terror radius like Coulrophobia (Slow heals in the terror radius) Infectious Fright (When you down someone with an M1 melee attack, everyone in the terror radius screams and reveals their location, although it's debatable if it's worth a perk slot when Doctor has decent tracking by himself.) Unnerving Presence (Harder and more frequent QTE's/Skill Checks in the terror radius) work well on him.
---
I run Unnerving because Doctor has the random skill check locations as part of his base kit when in madness 1 and up. I also run Overcharge and want to be as obnoxious as possible because Unnerving makes the Overcharge SkillCheck even harder to hit.

---
Yea cuz he's post patch
---
You did a good job
---
Yes, because that's the primary effect. The secondary time wasting effect is only incidental as that is the only way to counter the perk. Especially because you running NOED doesn't actually make them any more or less likely to cleanse totems because it's impossible for them to tell if you even have it until it activates. So you could run four completely different perks and survivors would still have to waste time looking just because you *might* have it.
---
Jigsaw's logic in a nutshell
---
You aren’t following at all. When people complain about camping, they are told to just do gens aka genrush to punish them. When people complain about NOED, they are told they should’ve cleansed the totems. See where I am going? If the killer is a camper who also has NOED, then what the hell use is Small Game, your proposed solution for NOED? Do you cleanse dull totems while the killer is standing in front of a hook facecamping? Here lies the problem in that NOED has no requirement for the killer to get it to proc in the first place.
---
I got BBQ still waiting 4 Franklin's in the shrine
---
Exactly this is why noed should be nerfed. Killers are actually surprised when noed doesnt activate.

---
This rejection still stings, and I get denied daily. The one that got away. :(
---
I don't even use any of them. They can be useful perks given the scenario but I just don't like them. As a survivor I usually run Lithe and Spine Chill.
---
Once again, it's not a counter.  It's what the perk wants you to do.  Countering would not involve cleansing.
---
It honestly depends on a few things. If the game is free to play and a companion to the game on PC/Console then yes we should have linked progression.
---
That said I'd be more likely to get the mobile and switch version if there was linked progression.
---
That said, if you look at the mobile leaks, progression looks very different on the mobile version. If they don't scrap the leaked system then they probably won't have linking as it would be too easy to level up perks on the main version.
---
Honestly I thought Ghostface would come with version 2.8 of the game and 3.0 would be the big fall update with Switch and Mobile ports and possible links. Now...who knows.
---
Not spine chill. Just saw him
---
Sick! You gonna post those too?
---
Survivor perks due literally nothing compared to killer perks. Also every other killer uses ruin in red ranks, it's disgusting
---
I completely agree with him. There IS a counter to NOED, and it's really not that difficult. Problem is, survivors just wanna gen rush and GTFO, not do any other objective, and so they generally won't do dull totems in case there's NOED.
---

---
Nea:  MRS. SHERWOOD, GET DOWN!
---
Entity:  **NO QUALITY CONTROOOOOOOOL!**  (stuck forever until dead)
---
Sorry, not a counter.  It's playing into what NOED wants you to do.
---
It completely is related. They arent saying it's any of the movies killers but this persona could easily fit into the franchise because it's never the same guy twice anyways.
---
Why was this downvoted? It’s true.
---
&gt;Give this game more time to grow a large enough community to split for more gamemodes.
---
Its been three years, maybe we're losing people because of lack of game modes
---
I think one of my problems is overestimating my killers. I’m rank 11-13, so they aren’t very good but I expect them to be smart so I make specific plays thinking that it’ll counterplay their counterplays but they think much more linearly than I’d think (sounds r/iamverysmart I know lol)
---
Also how do you memorize the maps?
---
Well I don't play wraith anymore I'm a nurse main now

Of course! Once I finish them all I'll post them up, Susie and Julie both cost under 10$ to make, and less than a week, so I don't see the boys being much more difficult~
---
Just cleanse totems or get fucked
---
What are you even talking about? "Playing into what NOED wants you to do"?
---
Wow haven’t seen a post this inaccurate in a while.
---
Mediocre? Yea ok buddy. That's exactly why half of the red rank killers use it, cause it's "mediocre".

Definitely not cause it's broken af or anything

I guess that's a fair point. I do agree there are quite a few improvements, even PC needs improvement, however I don't think it necessarily deserves THIS much ridicule. Your points are still valid however.
---
New ultra rare add-on
---
If a red rank killer uses ruin they are one of those meta slaves that got to red ranks because they were carried by bad survivors tbh
---
Behaviour is the company who makes the game, they're usually abbreviated to BHVR.

Just stay in the terror radius now. Simple. You’re also going insane, so you really shouldn’t be able to fix up a heavy wound.

without it, games would end in like 5 mins. a lot of killers have like no time at all. Billy and nurse could do without easy but other killers not likely even more unlikely at high ranks
---
I still don't even feel like adrenaline is that crutch. Not compared to something like NOED. It's a one time speed burst AFTER the last generator. It's just as easily wasted if not planned right.
---
Very useful for:
---
We're gonna live forever
---
Botany Knowledge 
---
And I guess Self care for healing with a medkit
---
Finally someone who doesn't call everyone and anything a moron if they can understand sarcasm and joking through text.
---
And full heal off hook, and insta heal, sprint burst, ignores exhaustion. Its a crutch.
---
Adrenaline and other exhaustion perks? Borrowed time? Decisive? Self care? Sure there are perks like deja vu, but killers have perks like monstrous shrine. 
---
Also, rubi is extremely hot or miss. Totems can be found in the first 30 seconds, and good survivors can hit most of the skill checks.
---
Mine is Mad grit.
---
Ruin is active from the very beginning, Devour Hope is active after 2 hooks from a certain distance and that's just the first tier.  Both give you ample time to deal with and prepare for.  There is no counter for NOED because you don't know if the killer is running NOED up until it activates.  So, once again, you either waste time finding and cleansing all totems, in which case NOED wins, or the perk activates in which case NOED wins.
---
[Sigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c4s4n8/baby_meyers_waiting_for_his_chili/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)
---
It was 4 the teabag
---
I don't use NOED (besides when memeing) because I see it as a crutch and as a perk a good killer won't need. If you can't kill the survivors before the exit gates are open and they're at the exit you don't deserve those kills to be honest. But I understand using it against toxic players.
---
First of all, when we equip NOED we don't want you to cleanse it. We already got mending, bear traps, ruin, and other totmes that actually affect the game to slow you down. Hell if that was the case I would run another perk and watch as you cleanse useless totems.
---
No, we equip NOED to use it.
---
Cleansing totems is a counter because it takes the best part of the perk, which is the speed+ exposed. It takes time, yes, But it seems like you want to render the killer completely useless without having to do anything.
---
If that is the case you can always use the perk "youtube" where the game plays by itself.
---
PLEASE
---
Makes sense but Hag does best at map pressure, you never know if your playing 5 nights at basement or dbd
---
That huntress being looped is legit me when I play killer hahaha.
---
Mask is very impressive.
---
Oh I noed everyone but if they were fun to play against I will down them to bring them to the gate not hook
---
I feel it's a crutch that a good killer won't need.
---
I don't think you understand just how much that perk changes the entire landscape of the match.  Even just the threat of it alone makes it so that people play a certain way.
---
Well it’s a crutch I like to use. Because I want to get back at toxic kids
---
Memorizing the maps is difficult because they don't spawn the same way every time. You've probably noticed by this point that sometimes a certain window is open, and other times it's blocked off. Once you play enough, you'll pick up on which windows/pallets always spawn in, and which ones can change.  
---
One thing that helps is to learn the walled structures, which spawn the same way on almost all maps. That way you can tell at a glance where the pallets and windows are for an area. Check this video for details on the structures [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM&amp;t=55s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6QYjInzLeM&amp;t=55s)

---
I hate it because the killer always closes the hatch and then camps both of the doors because they’re always conveniently next to each other.
---
The Trapper and Wraith have fairly basic animations, being two of the original three killers.
---
As more and more killers were added, their kill animations became more flashier to accommodate the higher budget of the game.
---
!&gt;The Trapper steps on their back to prevent them from crawling away before slashing them to death.
---
The Wraith drags them towards him by their leg before *wacking* them to death.
---
The Hillbilly cuts them in half with a slash of his chainsaw.
---
The Nurse pins them to the ground and chokes them to death.
---
The Shape hoists them in the air by the neck and runs them through with his knife.
---
The Hag rips out their throat and stomach, eating their organs.
---
The Doctor electrocutes them to death, leaving visible smoke from their fried brain.
---
The Huntress impales their face with her axe before slashing the body a couple times.
---
The Cannibal whacks them over the head with his mallet before running them through with his chainsaw.
---
The Nightmare runs them all the way through with his clawed glove hand.
---
The Pig stabs them through the hand before slashing open their throat.
---
The Clown stomps on their head three times before amputating their right index finger, licks it and attaches it to his key ring.
---
The Spirit runs the survivor through the chest with her sword before hacking their body several more times.
---
The Legion swings at the survivor who dodges, stabs them in the arm before being shoved back, then stabs the fleeing survivor in the foot to halt them before stabbing them in the chest.
---
The Plague whacks the survivor over the head with her lantern, recites some ritualistic chanting, vomits in the survivor's face then knocks them down with the lantern again.
---
The Ghost Face stabs the survivor several times in the back, then holds up their head and takes a selfie with them before letting go and grabbing their knife back.&lt;!
---
**TL;DR - Yes.**
---
\*breaks faster than the speed of light\*
---
Actually, if you look at current pig, her traps are in active when a survivor is in the pigs terror radius as it currently is, and only active reverse bear traps kill survivors at the exit gates now, this is the writing of a revert, it is not a rewrite, and if it was, what would the point be of writing all that? If it’s as you say, the same as it is currently then you wouldn’t need to rewrite all this?
---
no its not, nurse should be nerfed to thhe ground
---
And? That’s no different from doing things like not going after the blatantly unsafe unhooked survivor in case of BT and DS, or watching my pallet throws for SC+Enduring combos.
---
It wouldn't be managed, because NOED still got you to do what it wanted you to do.
---
There's nothing more to be added.  There aren't different viewpoints or arguments to be made, there's only one objective truth about how this works.  I do have an issue with Ruin, but my issue isn't so much as with Ruin itself as it is with killer design in general.
---
This actually feels really familiar- Did this happen on console?
---
This comment is provided by: killer mains. Enjoy
---
Ok, I never used Decisive but I thought it worked like you have one chance no matter what miss or not.
---
I think billy has enough cute outfits, he needs more like the red jacket and beer army pants one and the bandana hunter outfits.
---
&gt;-slightly/moderately/considerably/tremendously all getting changed to their actual values (instead of "tremensously increases movement speed" we'd get "increases movement speed by 80%)
---
&gt;Edit: a totem count next to the generator count in the UI
---
Honestly, I would kill for both of these. The thing is, the second one especially would be helpful for both killers and survivors

The Pig's Reverse Bear Traps do not pause when in the Killer's Terror Radius on live. That was an idea presented in the PTB that they didn't go threw with.
---
And If you re-read my power description, I specifically say that only active Reverse Bear Trap's will kill Survivors attempting to escape through an Exit Gate.
---
No. Who's that? This was a 4 man SWF cuz we were bored.
---
No if you miss DS, you can get it again.

Real shit though, I get decisive far more when I’m not tunneling than tunneling.

Ohhhhhh- I literally had a situation just like that- You're literally wearing the same skin and everything lolol

I actually intend to make all four of them and then when i retire Julie and Susie, I wanna put them in a shadowbox and hang them on my wall!

My bad haha
---
Vocal percussion on a whole nother level, coming from my mind
---
What is posting about it going to do?
---
NOED only has one perk - exposed after the last gen is complete. There's literally nothing in it that has anything to do with what you're saying, that's only incidental. 
---
Same could be said about having to save hooked survivors, or opening the gate, cleansing Hex totems, or anything else you have to do during a match, other than gens.
---
It CAN be managed, and quite simply, if more survivors would cleanse dull totems. But all you wanna do is gen rush, like I've said, and anything that deviates from that is "wasting time".
---
This is the last time I'll respond cause you clearly don't wanna hear anything logical. No point in pursuing this further.
---
Good day.
---
*P.S. Maybe next time, label this type of post as "shitpost" or "salt / rant", cause there's literally NO discussion to be had here if you won't concede to logic. It's just you trying to force feed everyone your invalid argument, to which multiple people have an opposing valid argument.*
---
Maybe grant me good luck lol
---
fair enough
---
Then remove ruin and re balance the game. My current experience as a red rank survivor that does SWF is
---
No ruin: 2-3 of us escape
---
Ruin: We all die
---
Look dude you made your Reddit account one day ago you don't wanna start your time by complaining about everything.
---
Then my sir, either you have the bad luck to go against Zubat every game, or your team is trash. I've had many games against a nurse, and either I lost because I made mistakes/I was bad at the game, or I stealthily made my way to the hooked person, unhooked just as nurse blinked towards the other side of the map, and then ran somewhere else
---
Was 80 degrees a few days ago.
---
Claudette Army! Send this rank 40 to the dungeons....
---
(Gud meme btw)
---
We did it boys. Dying to camping and tunneling killers is no more.
---
No, I agree that the game needs to be balanced. I don't think Ruin has an issue, but, if the game was balanced, there'd be no place for it.
---
Why though, it’s a garbage perk now
---
So I start to explain why its a crutch and suddenly it's not debatable? That's unfortunate. Also, not interested in karma, not phasing me.
---
I'm fairly certain it's you that won't concede to logic, because you're doing exactly what you're accusing me of.  "Only incidental" I guarantee you it was made intentionally to be that way.  There's no way they didn't plan for that when designing it.
---
That’s probably right.
---
Too late, it happened, boom
---
You literally just conplained that a killer perk had an effect on the game experience. Killer is the power role, ideally all of their perks follow that theme and are just as powerful in the game. Killer perks are going to affect you no matter what, assuming the killer actually uses ones with more specific uses.
---
Ha! I’ve definitely insisted on them living before. In this game I was worried that the three of them escaping might de-pip me or something. That’s the main reason I decided to take the hook.
---
Here are in-progress pictures of both my [Susie](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85d6db77d9e67061e016f720a4c86856/9115ea19ff645e87-1e/s640x960/913d22afa151ba44541be738dc6a61ef508c47be.jpg) and [Julie!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/3892295f3e06aa0cfd6e26d1e3fc2b86/9115ea19ff645e87-75/s640x960/dd9028f4e0eb0457142e6acabdcf91020fd6499a.jpg)
---
They both started as sheets of paper that i shaped using incisions all around the circumference over top a half sphere of styrofoam, and using tape i got the general shape, then layered over them with a sort of mache mesh that you can get at Michaels. I put about three or so layers on them and smoothed them out, and with Julie, she was basically done at that point once she dried.
---
For Susie, I used a dremel for the segment lines, and made sure to only make holes where my eyes are and my nose is so I can breathe a little better! After that, painting, but for the brackets I just used model magic! I'm a cheap hoe so if I could get by on a budget you bet I was going to lmao. I superglued the model magic brackets onto the wires and the mask at the same time, and sprayed a fixative just in case!
---
I'd give more love to Julie if her model wasn't literally a -lazy- genderswap of Frank's model. Even their faces kinda look like siblings... lol. If they made her outfit more unique and not... Literally just Frank's, I'd give more to her. Hopefully she can get a skin, since Joey got the 80's one.
---
Probably one of those Invaders that use a white branch then appears out of no where and backstabs you off a cliff
---
Not very situational at all, and also has nothing to do with swf and can screw over solo people too. Just need to be vs a doctor, and get saved by someone with Borrowed Time, a super popular perk and that's it.
---
Wow. Alot of effort went into this meme. Someone gild this man please.
---
😂I literally saved a clip of me walking down those exact steps as Myers and going back up to see if what I thought I saw in the shadow was true.
---
Try to enjoy your grind. The perks will come, but if you're not having fun, you'll be getting frustrated and burned out before you "start" playing with what you have in mind.
---
Now you see sir, I'm not a retard that wastes a perk slot on Urban Evasion and crouches around the map all game and does nothing. So I'll stop that train of thought there. And of course teammates aren't the greatest outside of SWF, it's DBD. But the fact that literally every single Nurse, no matter how mediocre, can body literally any team and she's the only Killer that can do that is straight up unfair. Either make all the Killers able to do it or rework her power entirely. I'm sick and tired of people protecting a broken fucking Killer because "tHe GeNs PoP tOo QuIcK" That's a game problem, not a Killer problem.
---
You are bleeding on the floor!
---
Literally this post has -2 for votes, all your posts are negative, and everyone responding is saying the same thing to you that I am.....smdh
---
I'm sure it's just me though.
---
One of those *fake* doctors.  Gotcha.
---
Is.. Is that the Hag?
---
"Ew, what a creep!"
---
Thank you so much!! It really means a lot to me to hear that!
---
It's hardly useful
---
I would love if they appreciated all the Legions as different killers rather than making Joey and Susie the better looking skins, I would love some stuff for Frank and Julie that looks different
---
Brutal is never a bad perk choice. Helps with gens and pallets.

You are playing with fire by saying such blasphemies
---
Wait was I dead ass think I was in that game with you, was the person who was hooked named Vibez
---
No there is a limit a solo team can't reach regarding organization.
---
There will be informations they don't have that will make them take a bad decision or hesitate eventually and give killer a chance to snowball.
---
Up to him to make the most of that.
---
BT depends on terror radius just be smarter with your hook saves and it shouldn't be an issue, if someone is getting saved right in front of killer it's probably not going to end well anyway doctor or not, bt or not. It can be avoided
---
It’s very much situational sir
---
I'm pretty sure this is the level I play on everytime I'm the killer.
---
The opposite, tunel that dude and camp him.

I was thinking more Evil Dead... Or Tucker and Dale

I think is an entity's recreation

---
Had a game against spirit earlier where the heart beat was a real coin toss with accuracy/whether or not it worked, and same with her phasing sound. She didn't have beads, it would just some times go whoooosh and sometimes all you could hear were her footsteps.

I play Huntress, yeet.

Why is Huntress top tier but Micheal is a tier lower?

Mooooom! Phineas and Ferb are using Object of Obsession again!
---
Totally 10/10! The eye holes are right over my eyes, and you can actually see my eyes through them if you are close enough -- Much more visibility than my Julie, who i actually have to turn my head to the side slightly in order to see in front of me, and have absolutely no peripheral vision.

Eh, Kate is a really iffy one because she cost money and she has only one good for beginners and her other perks are low tier.

Yeah you made it very clear that it was “wild” in the post game chat😂

The Huntress, except you're not allowed to use her throwing hatchets

You know that one line from Krieg the Psycho of Borderlands 2, "I'VE GOT A HIGE HAND?" Comes to mind.
---
It’s not that there is a Benefit it’s just when you have nothing left tot do in the game then just prestige.
---
It’s like that because they have to contort the arms and stuff to look good in first person for you, but you never see what it looks like in third person, except through shadows.
---
Oh no I still main Pig. I always just dishes out her traps as distractions before End Game so the changes never bugged me.
---
oh god yes bb yes! The entity is my child
---
:(
---
Ruin mixed with devours isn’t the best combo but you have HG to balance it out a little. I just say that because ruin gives survivors a reason to look for a hex but like I said you have haunted grounds to balance it.
---
Yeah try it. I'm on xbox but I assume it works everywhere. Idk if it's intentional. I just hold crouch until I'm all the way down and then hold sprint, then start going forward, then let go of crouch.
---
The one in upper cathedral ward fucked me over so many times
---
Oh you got FUCKED fucked
---
Just get your looping and mindgames on point and run decisive, dead hard and adrenaline.  I get tunneled a lot so I just aim to make that shit as fucking painful as humanly possible for the killer if they decide to whip out the babystrats and camp.  Keep working on your chases so you can punish these types of players.
---
Not a single DC is justifiable.
---
This is why killers run noed, then survivors cry. Survivor main btw, not that it should provide any more “justification” for my opinion
---
It’s fucking weird, southern california has been quite cold and cloudy this summer so far.  Which is very odd for SoCal. Usually gets pretty warm!
---
He started it. Something called self defense, pretty rare in 2019
---
happy cake day, nerd
---
Save your shards because it’s a dead perk after the nerf.
---
"Nothing personal, survivor."
---
&gt;He started it
---
Very mature. 
---
&gt;Something called self defense,
---
It's called being a sap.
---
Thanks man I keep getting smacked by trashface
---
They need a buff to mid range damage too, but yea, they're fun.
---
The pig was the original tbagger
---
That's the thing though, it stunts the developement of learning the ins and outs of playing killer. Those that run it use it as a safety net and it keeps them from putting the effort into learning how to efficiently end chases, how to properly apply gen pressure, knowing when to abandon a specific chase etc...it just creates a lot of horrible habits.  I didn't learn how to properly play killer myself until I stopped using it.  You'll learn so much more about playing killer if you stop using it. It will force you to make better decisions
---
I feel like a blood vessel popped in my brain when that happens. Sorry it happened to you, hopefully dedicated servers will fix it!

Playing against swf is already really difficult since they just run around dropping your hooks when they're all 99%
---
True true

No Mither is worse than left behind, at least Left Behind doesn't cripple you for the entire game

No one does that.

Once the timer runs out, people abusing this bug will immediately get killed by the entity.

Oof

Glad you enjoyed it! 👌😂

My friends and I actually conceived of The Shining as a combination map and killer. Each floor features different killers who all share a perk pool but have different abilities, with one of their offerings being a guarantee of getting a certain floor and their add-ons having different effects based on which killer you had.
---
I can't remember what we agreed on for abilities, but we did agree that it would be very hard to pull off successfully. Thought it'd be neat as hell if they could though.
---
Rio
---
Not sure for survivor, but for killer; especially Nurse/Billy/Huntress. You will find K&amp;M will be 100x Better.
---
Killer mains: "Survivors are OP!"
---
Survivor mains: "Killer are OP!"
---
Me and 5 other people who don't main a role, smiling while watching because we know the game is actually balanced: "Yeeeeah boi..."
---
Yes I agree, but so are most Killers unfortunately.
---
Tons of people do that. If they're really co-ordinated the person looping the killer will deliberately lead them to where a hook has been sabo'd to 99%, so another survivor can pop it. Even 2 man groups do it semi regularly.
---
Oh god damn that's cancer.  Not even talking about swf which is challenging but it had to be the Game Map for a trapper lol.  I am a very experienced Trapper and there is no killer and map combo that makes me die inside more.  I'd rather play Billy on Lery's than deal with that shit.  Better rng luck next time.
---
yeah, those were the dark ages
---
Shit dude you got a point. And its no fun for anyone else if they want to have a good game. I could use a 4th perk on something other than noed
---
reason eu struggles with heat is because theres never ac anywhere, and heat is often extremely dry
---
No promise one does that. If you are going up against someone who is very good at looping, most likely the rest of the Survivors are repairing all the Generators. Usually sabotaging hooks is just a waste of time and that's why even SWF' don't do it.
---
Just play on pc
---
Damn saw that title and was coming here to put you in contact with my human skin guy.  After seeing this was a Leatherface cosmetic question though yeah just kill the og survivors 25 times a piece to unlock.  Has to be hook sacrifices (moris and slugs don't count).
---
Lmao I ran into this guy today too
---
Löööng arm
---
Can you see with that?
---
Oh thank you for that very helpful
---
Dont question the fact that i dont care about seeing the bitchs face? Its a legion cosplay not a oh look im an attractive female that knows im an attractive female let me post my face. Its let me farm some easy karma cause im a chick. Downvote me all you like lol it doesnt change the fact that shes attention whoring by chucking her face in for no reason. Wheres the skin where legions face shows? Oh wait there isnt one
---
The pallet in the killer shac. You only use that pallet when you really have to because its easy to loop the killer there for a while. If you can choose between getting hooked for the FIRST time and using god pallet, dont use it, just rather die and get hooked once. Only use it in the end of the game when you really dont want to die.
---
Or that Ghostface isn’t an actual ghost. It’s pretty obvious he is
---
That must be the best cosplay I have ever seen on here! Good job!
---
*cue the Yakety Sax theme*
---
A pallet that the killer is forced to break because it is too strong to remain a part of the loop once dropped. Usually the loops themselves surrounding these pallets are very strong if run correctly.
---
That's fair, it's definitely been a little less frustrating now that I know her mechanics and abilities. I still wish I could have some variety with the killer though :P thanks for the tips!
---
LMAO wow
---
Hill billy doctor or the nurse
---
I think there are other 3 Ghostfaces in the book written by that fun world guy.
---
But I don't know if any of them survived.
---
BTW, Doofy is only known as "the killer" he ain't officially a ghostface.
---
 🥰😍😍
---
True. Although maybe it's just a perspective thing but I got hit with one after running behind a building at almost a 90 degree angle. Is there a current hitbox issue with her?
---
I can, very well too!
---
Oh lordy, thank you so very much! That's such a compliment!
---
Nah it's not justification to DC. 
---
I still find it kinda shitty to be on the receiving end of and if people teabag and do it at literally every pallet, DS me and then flashlight blind me during the DS stun, etc. they have no right to complain about me tunneling the shit out of them. 
---
I just see doing it over and over as a bit of BM because the advantage it gives is debatable but the annoyance it causes me is rather high. I swear those flashlights never seem to run out.
---
I would think the killers that are undead are the ones that would be strongest in fights with one another. Nurse, Spirit and Freddy spring to mind.
---
That's with a perk though, your comparing a perk to a game mechanic. If seeing the killer when they hook someone was a perk that would be be fair.
---
...the actual fuck is your problem. You think she did this shit with confidence? No, she didn’t. She was nervous the whole time. So fuck you for being a prick and thinking she’s hogging attention you absolute bellend.
---
I just let the killer kill me if I don't have a key and am the last survivor. You are trying to be sneaky and open the door, but the red doorlights give away your position and its over.
---
If Michael wears a William Shatner mask, who's would she wear?
---
No Mither, Resilience, This is Not Happening, Prove Thyself.

That's not what was being shown, look at my offerings, ability and what character I was playing

If the hitbox on the hatchet wasn't so random, Huntress wouldn't be a liar but she is.

You can report them at endgame tally if you want
---
And you should because it amazing I especially love the improv with the mask
---
That’s why I say BHVR since I’m sure the devs work really hard and they actually have a rule to not get overworked, well multiple rules but you get my point. It’s the people that tell those guys what to do which are the higher ups. Don’t want to actually find their names but that is why I blame the company and not the actual devs.
---
In the screen where you see everyone’s blood points, names, perks etc there is a button that appears after hovering your mouse over the player’s row or it a button at the bottom of the screen I can’t quite remember.
---
Found the defender of female virtue. Thats the point cunt she is posting on a dbd sub a awesome cosplay that she tuen for no apparent fucking reason has to chuck her face into so she ensures she gets extra likes from muppets like yourself you fucking white knight tosser. Continue to tell me how wrong I am you onow im right and so does everyone else. Im just pointing it out cause im not enthralled with females like you appear to be. Omg its a woman shes precious leave her alone even though shes karma whoring. You wanna post a picture of your face go post it in the relevant sub not one about Dead by Daylight if I wanted to look at pictures of insecure makeup ridden chicks i would go to the appropriate sub not one about killers getting pallet looped and killing survivors. Fuck you wanna get your face in the cosplay cosplay a survivor or a killer where they show their face not just la de dah im a chick look at me lad de dah

Aftercare, Head On, Prove Thyself, Dance with me

What’s so shitty about him?
---
The first one was a complete failure since no one could even log in. So while this is the second experiment it technically is the first one that they actually got data from and I am guessing sometime in July people who were in it will be rewarded. We have no idea what the reward is however.
---
Honestly, I'm fine with Wraith's Mori as a concept, but the animation quality is just so poor. A bit of an update would be nice.
---
I find dbd youtubers annoying. Like Monto and Noob3, i still watch them but they get annoying.
---
Every killer is strong if you know how to play them, but I think its gonna be Nurse or Hillbilly
---
Lore wise I would say the spirit since she is already dead and she cant really die again.
---
It'd take me a little while to think of a full power for Jack but for now that gave me a perk idea.
---
Here's Johnny!: Once you're committed to catching someone, no barricade is sturdy enough to stand between you and your prey.
---
Whenever you gain a tier of bloodlust this perk gains a token, with a max of 1/2/3. Whenever you perform a basic attack lose a token, and if the attack hits a pallet, vault location, or locker, it is destroyed, but the attack cooldown is 30%/25%/20% longer.
---
Pallets are destroyed as normal, lockers can no longer be interacted with, and any survivors inside are downed, and vault locations are removed, leaving a space that survivors and killers can walk through.
---
I’ll finish his word
---
I C C
---
God, I wish that were me.  I've been getting so much Ghostface I've switched to just playing doctor until the hype dies down.
---
It was like an hour ago so i left isnt there a way to return that?
---
No I’m not an asshole I’ll hide here but won’t wait for the killer here I gotta keep moving
---
He uploads to YouTube but he’s primarily a Twitch streamer with almost half a million followers. He’s probably encouraged so many people to get better at killer and is way less toxic than Noob3 and way less of a douche than Monto.
---
Maybe I’ll check him out.
---
Even then you should have known better than to queue for a game. Unless if it is like Omg there is a spider on my wall! Then you are justified of going afk till the demon is dead.
---
cause it's tiny bit dad bod and it's the hottest thing in the universe

So that's how the hatch spawns
---
I'll take "stupid responses" for 400 Alex.
---
Spirit is the first thing you kill? Have you *seen* the ghosts in the new lomdo ruins?
---
Unlike you ya prick I know her. Unlike you I have respect and manners that you clearly lack. Mommy not around enough? Or was it daddy who implanted this bullshit sexist ideology you employ in that primitive and misused mind of yours? I am no white knight. I’m a friend who looks out for another against cunts who lack basic human intellect or sense of respect. You sir have proven to me that you are a parting humanity that no one can have a piece of respect for a stranger. So what if she has her face? Let it be. She doesn’t need your dumbass comments because you ‘think’ that she’s hogging Karma. She is a human being who has emotion, not some tool who posts pictures on the internet for meaningless Karma.
---
I know this doesn’t have anything to do with the post but what perks do you run for Myers?
---
*Sad legion, plague, trapper, wraith, kinda clown(cuz he don’t have much map control), leatherface and legit any killer with ruin noises*
---
I don’t get it.
---
Also happy cake day.
---
Omfg I am in tears 😂😂😭😭
---
Or that the clown isn't thicc
---
I've been the survivor doing that, it's fun but an utter waste of time. The amount of survivor uptime they save by avoiding a hook isn't actually that high since the themselves have been spending a bunch of time preparing hooks and staying near the killer in chase, and they're always better off having just spent the time saboing and running around just working on generators.
---
That wasn’t their question lol.
---
It lasts 1 minute. You have 2 other survs to go after. I dont tunnel and I never get stunned with it. If somebody who had been hooked tries to get under your weapon, it means they have it 90%.
---
They stoned you for the truth.
---
If you just run in a straight line, yeah. Run with a plan and it wont be 20sec. ;)
---
It's just my normal build.
---
Botany Knowledge, Pharmacy, Bond, and Iron Will.

How can you honestly believe that, when we have rank reset, people depipping intentionally and a bad matchmaking system? There are rank 1's and rank 20's playing together. Being rank 1 doesnt give you anything special, and ranking up is so easy that unless you are bad at the game you should be rank 1 without even trying before every reset. Hell I reach rank 1 within the first week until I decided to try to derank on purpose bc red ranks is an unfun sweatfest. I'll start caring about rank when it truly matters in this game.
---
I play Wraith, so ha-...

*Sad bing bong followed by pallet stun sound.*

As you can partially see by the chat he avoided me for the entire game until i spotted him at the end so i felt a bit of joy and i decided to let him escape. I even led him to the hatch :)

I like how you think

Nurse? Do we have a nurse here???

Patch Notes 0.0.0

But it looked stupid. They tried to recreate the tension and anxiety that the first one had with a similar scene. Like I said, I know what they were going for but it didn't come off.
---
Spirit fury time
---
This made every single cell in my body cry
---
You have to think this as a bussiness, because, well, this game is a bussiness, so if they are adding licenced killers it is because they actually bring profits, which are the ones that make possible this game to continue growing.
---
In short it's not like they are wasting resourses into bringing licenced killers just in a whim, they are doing it because it is good for the game's economy.
---
hey what are the thingies on the mask
---
Thank you so much for your kind words, also great to see another Legion main!! I intend to make all four of them as well in the future!
---
They are the brackets for the "braces" on her mask, but if you're wondering what they're mad if, they are made out of crayola model magic!
---
Daddy broke his hand x
---
Kicking generators and breaking pallets. No cool down either, it is every time they decide to do it. There is even a second after the time runs out where you can still see their aura. Pretty good for locating where the killer is and determining what the next move is.
---
breaking a pallet??!!?
---
I play clown, so prepare to start tripping.
---
Wow, Legion was really nerfed. I can tell she doesn't run as much anymore.
---
A military monster set for billy could be interesting.
---
I'm extremely happy that you noticed!! I made sure to recreate it as much as possible, down to the paint smudges.
---
I’m stoked to see more! Keep being awesome! If you ever need any help with Legion or friends on ps for swf let me know!
---
Normally I hate the legion and I consider all of their weapons designs and even writing to be incredibly low effort. I also consider playing as them equally low effort. Easily the worst thing ever added to dead by daylight and it blows my mind how people consider Joey a good character for example. Joey and Julie are literally just names. They have no character. At least Susie and Frank have some character to them I guess.
---
That being said... This cosplay was by no means low effort. It looks great. You look great. And I can't give this enough upvotes. :)
---
No it’s not at all
---
But that's not camp, is tunnel
---

My G I hope you are 100% joking.
---
Breaking pallets + Damaging generators
---
I think it’s a fair question to ask. I didn’t know it affected generators for a long time so always dismissed it but now I want to try it in a solo build.
---
Rule 34 lol
---
I think somethings wrong with my arm.. 🤔
---
No the rule where a character is guaranteed to have a counterpart of the opposite sex.
---
Oh idk lol
---
Doing the lord’s work
---
I mean Amanda's not like any of the others. They made her work pretty well though.
---
In my house we sing _dummy dummy dummy dummy dummy thicc Jane_ every time we see one.  Not sure why but I can’t stop.
---
Object of obsession, no mither, self care, and slippery meat. I call it we’re not going to make it.
---
Probably bloodpoints, maybe cells. I wouldn't expect a unique cosmetic or anything like that.
---
It's basically cause SWF with voice chat is 100x better than 4 solo ques. 
---
But to say it's cheating is false. Cheating in games is bannable, talking to friends while playing is not.
---
If you play nurse or huntress yes. Otherwise no.
---
It's specifically meant to block your view of the killer so you can't tell where they go afterwards. The killer gets the exact same thing when a generator is completed.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Yeah no, don't kid yourself. When loads of people use a perk for blood points vs using a perk because it's good, that's two different things.
---
The perk wouldn't have such a high usage rate if it wasn't broken, y'all are just ignoring the obvious.
---
If your justifying it by saying, "the game ends too fast, it's necessary" then I can agree with that. Remove ruin and rebalance gens. 
---
In it's current state, ruin's use rate is way too high and it is broken
---
Unpopular opinion: Shirtless Trapper looks slightly hotter than Shirtless Myers.

It still *is* favored towards survivors.  
---
And it will be until they do something about SWF and only \~3 threatening killers in red ranks.
---
pretty sure they’re in 90s-100s, but a still your average summer in maryland lol

Whenever I get the game map I just farm because I know the survivors hate that map as much I do.
---
It’s the whip lash technique from the baki anime
---
Frank. He don't need no bells and whistles he just needs to stab people. I'd like to play Joey but his pants look stupid imo, plus he just has franks voice so it throws me off.
---
People disagree with me?  
---
"mUsT hAvE bEeN rAnK 15 kIlLeRs!1"

I don't run NOED cuz I like a challenge. And survivors that t-bag me and are general assholes will complain. Why do killers have to avoid by the rules that are set by survivors?
---
When one see that sry for the quality.
---
Leapy Legion here to give a stab. Just remember, t bagging survivors get no good manners from the killer.
---
Welcome to dbd. A game where people who have hundreds of hours and all the best perks can play with noobs. Im sure your finding out now that the game dosent really explain how to play to new players, give them absolutely nothing to start and then says fuck you.

Why are there so many downvotes lol

Unfortunately she’s tight on funds so that might take time.
---
I play only Freddy and Wraith and somehow I still manage to win while playing fairly. I got to purple ranks and still go higher and I dont tunnel and never have camped. I dont sweat over 4k, I dont slug to secure ez win. Can I? Yes. But I want everyone to have fun. Im merciless, but fair. I dont need cheap strategies to feel like Im doing good. Only if somebody farms, I'll most likely down the injured surv and go for the unhooker. And if they tried to piss me off, I'll show them my ways of being a jerk.
---
In the local files tabs -&gt; validate game files
---
Yeah, you convinced her because you know she looks good.  
---
Others are going to see it the same way.  
---
It will give her positive attention and boost her confidence.
---
That is the goal.
---
Had that happen to david when i was the killer, felt sorry for him, tried everything to get him out, nothing helped.
---
That mask looks great! How does it sit on your face? Like what's the shape of the mask on the inside?
---
For one, it doesn't work like that. And for two, even if it did, that's a stupid suggestion.
---
Got it worse one time.
---
It was on the  right of the exit gate, in a corner

Are you sure it’ll be given in July? From what I read, it’ll be given out in June

*Mindgames myself by thinking the survivor will try and loop me but runs to another loop immediately*

I love how there are good players with helpful advice but there will allways appear that one toxic attention seeking guy and go like:

---
You get the same in starcraft, league of legends, dota, counter strike and dead by daylight.  
---
Even if you are a godlike player you don't WIN every game. You'll have bad games.  
---
Especially if you play this game for hundreds or thousands of hours.
---
Still want a spinoff with other players so badly
---
Lie doesn't have f in it, just FYI.
---
even if you sniped them, be happy. they are crybabies, complain about the insta down axes from huntress and how they would leave, get pissed at each other for stealing their points etc. they are 'tryhard' basic bitches from what i hear
---
Well yeah, you’re playing spirit. What did you expect?
---
Self care isn’t crutch. Self care is a waste of time
---
Almost all "big" dbd youtubers/streamers are full of themselves. Maybe hybrid panda is the most normal, but I don't enjoy his content that much.
---

---
Do you have a link for this song? 😂
---
Definitely Freddie. Most of the killers are just normal people, spirit is probably the only one who maybe could put up a fight, as she is kinda dead already?
---
Amanda, she's so cute nobody dares to hurt her
---
Viable killers in red ranks are Hillbilly,Nurse and Spirit. viable builds are BBQ,Ruin,Enduring and spirit Fury in my opinion.  enduring and spirit Fury can probably get swapped out with thrilling tremors or another gen pressure perk. Basically all the killers besides Nurse, spirit and Hillbilly aren't really that good in red ranks as Survivors are sweaty.
---

---
That Big Dick Energy.

Yeah ofc I'm going to try and get better but it just baffled me how sudden it was. Like I went from doing good in every game to going 4 games without a sacrifice instantly

😍👍👍
---
I've been watching Scott Jund for a while now and he was the person who got me into the game, I'm going to try and get better but going from doing well to getting fucked instantly was a strange experience
---
Tit for tat, survivors do it to killers, maybe the game before, they learn the toxic behaviour and copy it, 
---
Doesn’t help when content creators who are very popular promote toxic behaviour with titles like “Toxic Ghostface gameplay”
---
Lol
---
The cycle of life and death continues
---
Nurse, Spirit and Hillbilly are the viable killers in red ranks. Hag can also be viable, but she can be hard countered by SWF teams, unlike the other 3 killers.
---
Good perks for Nurse : Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Infectious Fright, Whispers, Shadowborn, Monitor and Abuse, Hex:Ruin, Sloppy Butcher and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Good perks for Spirit : Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Surveillance, Hex:Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Pop Goes the Weasel, Hex:Haunted Ground and Make Your Choice.

Good perks for Hillbilly : Enduring, Spirit Fury, Barbecue and Chilli, Hex:Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel and Monitor and Abuse.

*Hey! Where's Claudette?*
---
I just died inside all over again help 😢
---
Anything that can be countered by Discord is not viable at red ranks.
---
It's not that it is S tier, it's just completely unfair from survivor side. Killers cried about old DS and mettle of man, because survivors get extra chance, extra health state, well noed takes one away and for multiple survivors usually. And it used mostly by bad killers to ruin one persons game at the endgame. Sometimes it goes to 2-3k from 0 because of one perk. 
---
And until we get totem counter, totem cleansing is not an option in solo play, coordinate swf can do it easily, not solo players. And if cleanse obvious totems, the most hard to find totem becomes NOED, and you just fucked yourself even more.
---
I think he should go the the doctor or the nurse.... just a feeling....
---
Entity: Alright, which one of you drew the short straw and is on palette replacement duty?
---
Killer: Boss, if you want the Survivors to feel a sense of hope that you feed on, why not use something that *seems* to give them an advantage? It'd make out job a lot easier-
---
Entity: *Sh.* Their hope must be *authentic.* I won't settle for that half-hearted hope crap. It tastes awful.
---
Killer: ...Yeah, sure, Boss.
---
A god pallet is a pallet that when thrown down is impossible to be played by the killer. This means the killer has to break it to continue the chase.
---
Killer: Boss, if you want the Survivors to feel a sense of hope that you feed on, why not use something that *seems* to give them an advantage? It'd make our job a lot easier-

People like you won't stop suggesting this stupid idea
---
LGBT? such an important information, I'm on my way!
---
Shh...just let this happen.
---
You can manage to win all the time as any killer, but when you face a swf squad or just a group of good solo survivors you’ll understand.  Also get to red ranks before your come to a conclusion on this, good luck getting there without nurse billy and spirit.  I don’t personally camp ever as killer unless I know survivors are around or the exit gates are open and I’m playing an m1 killer.  I don’t tunnel unless the injured is all I find or I need map pressure so I just slug them and chase the unhooker.  Slugging is a must for M1 killers even with ruin, and it’s a must on billy and spirit without ruin.  You just need to get to red ranks and face a group of competent survivors to understand this reality.
---
I actually love wraith he’s probably my favorite killer but I main billy because he’s the most balanced killer and has a high skill cap with his chainsaws and map pressure.
---
&gt;By itself, nothing at all (outside of everyone being able to see the Claws move while the Obsession is in a chase)
---
Woah woah woah woah, what? Well then. I never knew that. I'd notice the claws move but I'd never knew why. Walt, does it only move when the chase starts or does it move while the chase is ongoing?
---
*Inhuman Reactions.*
---
I actually use this build quite frequently but it stresses my swf because I'm a no mither lol

Yep, feeling proud of myself right now.

It happens from time to time.  They were farming you.

Tl;dr:
---
Killer powers should be more in depth on the descriptions so newer players don't have as hard of a learning curve
---
She’s so fucking nasty. Licking her dirty nails every time she hits a surv. Proxy camper to boot.

Fungoose is also a good guy to watch.

I personally dislike Scott but we have are opinions and I can't judge plus he really isn't the kind of guy to watch to get better as he is more comedic then educational. that's why I watch Otzdrava as he is fantastic and says what he thinks and what he is going to do and OhTofu gives criticism to videos sent in by fans pointing out mistakes and what you did right and has many guides on unique map buildings.
---
Yeah I like scott cause I used to watch his dark souls shit. He's sometimes pretty good at explaining his thought process. I will watch some otz stuff (know him from dark souls too lol but didnt realise he did dbd)
---
Probably cause you ruined his game, only nerds use mori so.... Nerd!
---
A lot of new Killers first of all. One you may run into and possibly get frustrated at is The Spirit, lots of good Spirits are good mind gamers, and it'll be hard to get used to. 
---
Ghost Face was added in recently, and my best piece of advice is look all around you while doing a gen so you can spot him. Make sure he is at the center of your screen so you can pull him out of his power. 
---
There's a lot but I'm sure a bunch of people are willing to catch you up
---
just git gud and hit the skillchecks lol
---
CTRL CTRL CTRL
---
[flashlight clicking intensifies]
---
Ghostface(not from the movies) got added and he is kinda bad as he gets countered by detection perks but is a great noob stomper. You can now close hatch and if a gate is powered Survivors have a time limit to leave and if they don't leave once it goes down then they die. DS now is just anti tunneling, Freddy is getting a rework. That's all I got.
---
Hatch can be closed can’t be taken off of it either besides that not much new that I can remember
---
I think you mean every damn Nea also.
---
You can use add-ons, both, Spirit and Hillbilly, don't need more than yellow add-ons to do well. You can play them even add-onless, but they are much harder without add-ons than with add-ons, Billy is very loopable without them, while Spirit can punish you very hard if you misplayed even 1 add-onless phasing. The best add-ons for Billy are charge time and cooldown add-ons and the best add-ons for Spirit are charge time and speed/cooldown add-ons.

A bit surprised to see such a well-formulated response so soon. XD I thought it would take at least 24 hours.
---
just think of this: ochido got the save, my diliverance is useless
---
Am I the only one who sees non-immersed Claudette’s more than immerses ones?
---
Spirit killed me 30 mins ago, now ghistface did.
---
Trapper or Michael for me
---
this fucking benny
---
Stake out counters hex ruin if u stayed in terror radius of killer u will get token. ez great skill check...
---
It's mainly on his(Otzdravas) second channel and he is a Trapper main while OhTofu mains hillbilly and has the legacy set, you got it if you Prestiged the character fully before the bloodweb rework(happened like 2 years ago or so) giving you glowing yellow clothing meaning he is very experienced.
---
I FINK WI DIT A PRITI GUT JUP SEU FART
---
Interesting. I'll check it out, thanks.
---
Damn, well the best advice I can give is to attempt to read the mind game on Spirit. 
---
Oh, a popular perk from Spirit is called Spirit Fury. When they break 2 pallets, the next time theu are stunned the pallet breaks instantly, but they're still stunned. 
---
Very popular Killer perk, when you spot they have Spirit Fury, drop pallets early.
---
Legion. 4 DCs in few minutes
---
It's cool when it happens by luck.
---
People who Deliverance in a teammates face are going to a special place in hell.
---
Cant beat that.
---
Wait, does he *actually* have a doctorate or did the government scoop him up from the university before he finished it?
---
Halloween in general was a disappointment to me. Myers in Dead By Daylight looks genuinely scary, especially with his stalking ability. In Halloween he just really obviously looks like a regular dude with some dumb mask on.
---
Spirit for me. Shutting down loops and using bbq to snowball effect.   You listen well and gen protect will get you 4ks often
---
I don't care how unfair or unbalanced this game mode would be. All I want is to slay some bitches with my friend. I don't care if we kill 1 person or everyone. Just killing together with a friend would make the game way more fun
---
Yeah, shes pretty good when you get the hang of her.
---
Trust me I know the pain of 4 swf, I have been gen rushed, bullied and outplayed. I know some swf aren't like this too, since I'm surv main and I play swf myself - my friends like to brainfart. Also I'm already getting red ranks, even though I'm not there (just look...  https://imgur.com/gjq94c9 - matchmaking, can you not??). I know that experienced solos can win. But the game is BALANCED - which means, you win some, you lose some and its okay. Sometimes I get outplayed hard, sometimes I outplay them hard. I just try to not take it personally. And yes, I know the struggle for M1 killers, I have played both Freddy and Nurse and I see the difference, but I have met so many scummy killers I just refuse to be one. If survivors are okay to me, I am okay to them.   
---
I really must be a nice killer - I even got a +rep **WHEN I HAD EBONY MORI** XD and yes, I killed with it. I just give people more chances than I should...
---
That really would be cool and really dark when you think about it more. The Wraith travels between worlds to become 'invisible'. Hence you're literally killing them but also banishing their bodies to a different world where they will never be found.
---
Now that'd be a good mori.
---
You need the shitpost tag. No one can seriously think this.
---
This will fix the game
---
if you're in red ranks, Brutal is better since survivors tend to drop the pallet earlier to counter your Spirit Fury. if not, use Spirit Fury instead
---
They have a 2v8 mode? That's impressive. Is it fun? Balanced?
---
&gt;seven perks
---
LMFAO
---
Sorry for the stupid question, but I've been seeing conflicting info. If you prestige a character, (say claudette for self care or bubba for bbq), is the perk still unlocked for other characters or do you have to get them to the appropriate level again?
---
Once unlocked at no prestige level 30/35/40, the teachable stays even if you prestige. 
---
You buy it only once. This is the only factual information.
---
If by "fix the game" you mean everyone will finally be free from the game because everyone's left since there's no killers then yeah.
---
killers are faster than the survivors
---
&gt;Once unlocked at no prestige level 30/35/40, the teachable stays even if you prestige. 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;You buy it only once. This is the only factual information.
---
Okay. So if I've ever gotten a perk unlocked through the web it's unlocked. Thank you very much for the clarification
---
So it just takes the items then. Thank you again and have a good one!
---
It should be, pretty sure it is just a visual bug.
---
Captain Jack Sparrow as a new survivor confirmed
---
Are you a hardstuck rank 20 or just stupid?
---
you checked it in the post-match results or when you got in the main menu after the post-match results?
---
If you get a teachable perk unlocked, it stays unlocked and obtainable on all other bloodwebs, normal perks do not stay if you prestige. 
---
Prestige takes everything except unlocked teachable perks.
---
Really? That's weird then. If that's the case I'll take down the post lmao
---
Just post-match, assumed that would be accurate but if its a visual bug then fair
---
And even turned hot in the end
---
yeah they specified that they weren't fit for play
---
That looks so funny. He just comes up like that and takes the nearest survivor like "What's up guys, Imma just take yo friend over here. Oh well, bye guys!"
---
Yeah, it should be acurrate, but y'know... DBD is DBD
---
Every time that happened to me, it was a visual bug but when I got to the main menu my pips where the same that before last match
---
Yeah.. isn't it amazing that they even thought these were a good idea? Especially BNP insta-fix. Holy crap. How was that ever a thing?
---
Omg i play Myers and I noticed that in a match and fucking died laughing
---
not all killers are going to experience this... only the very high ranked ones and it will be a good challenge for them. W.e prestige killers can have addition perks as well. just so game isn't boring. Because unlike killers- survivors don't have an entire kit revamp with each new survivor. Just perk changes. Perks mean nothing when you have meta perks and only a few perk slots.
---
Fair enough then, my bad for not checking. Can't be 100% that it wasn't actually a de pip but I'll assume it wasn't
---
If your dumb ass did it yesterday, you were probably playing against me because a Claudette did that yesterday and I laughed my ass off.
---
Is that a hint you will do a possible Prestige 3 Susie? Or just no pun intended XD. Either way it looks great so far and you managed to make me compliment the legion. You look great and it looks great. Keep up the awesome work
---
Ya wanna give killers the same treatment?
---
Have a Nurse with seven perks?
---
you are big dumb-dumb
---
What you smoking on
---
You gotta keep this forever now. No more gaining or losing BP. Uninstall basically.
---
It looks like The Plague &gt;!actually hits the survivor over the head, recites the prayer, wraps the chain of the weapon around their neck, vomits in their face, then breaks their neck by yanking on the wrapped weapon!&lt;
---
He's right actually.
---
No, because doing this at all makes the game completely unbalanced. Powers are specific to that killer. So it's not really a kit change, just like new survivor perks aren't a kit change, the moment more than 4 perks at a time are included is the moment the game loses any hope it had at ever being balanced. This idea has been mentioned before, but it just isn't feasible
---
Yeah he shortens loops, the only way for survivors to survive is to loop when the killer is on them
---
High ranked killers arent the only killers seeing p3s. When I started killer, I saw my first p3 and they were a rank 19. And then from there on out I see at least 1 prestige every other game. 
---
And SWF is already a challenge for 99% of killers, why make it more of one
---
Looks absolutely amazing! I love it!
---
Get rid of her stupid addons and she'll be way more tolerable.
---
That matchmaking was fine everyone except the red rank was pretty close in rank and what do you want honestly the game would fucking die if you couldn't play with your friends ffs.
---
You only need 627 279 more for ultimate perfection.
---
hmm why stop there, why not 10 perks?
---
Yeah but certain choke points like around and through trees are the best cause people don't expect them
---
Exactly.
---
Only way that could work is a entire chenge to the perk system restricting what perks you can pick for what slot. Like perk one exhaustion, perk two aura, perk three protector and so on.
---
Problem is two-fold though - you still end up with meta set-ups and now its impossible to specialize your build.
---
Ooooo put Astrid’s * on each side of that
---
DbD has a very delicate balance. The survivors have limited defense where as the killers have unlimited offense. Granted this balance isnt very good, but it's there. 
---
All characters have 4 perks, that way it is even. However, the killer needs to be stronger than the survivors since it's a 4 on 1. Hence why they have powers. If you change the perk equality, killers no longer have the small advantage they're already given. In fact, survivors would have more of an advantage because of how good some of the perks are. This destroys what little balance the game has.
---
However, balance isnt the only issue. This game also has many economies. From the bloodpoint economy to the perk economy. Only 4 perks are allowed because more ruins that. 4 perks barely keep perk combos fair. 7 shatters that. 
---
Just imagine- Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Self Care, Iron Will, Balanced Landing, Botany(Increase self care speeds), Streetwise, purple flashlight w/ charge add ons. Now you have 5 meta perks, something to make one more powerful, and something to make the purple flashlight last nearly forever
---
Everyone is saying Freddy but people don’t sleep in the entity they get put into the dream world. So I guess the strongest would be anyone who could get out of the dream world. That would be nurse and wraith. They go into a different plane with their powers. So whichever one of them can fight Freddy better.
---
F
---
Amazing job on the mask!
---
I can't wait to try 8 hex totems with thrill of the hunt.
---
I always like the idea that theu actually die because of her vomit, like so much and so cncentrated when in the dying state its basicly the plauge that killed her killing them. With the whip if the lantern around their necks being a sort of final bitchslap. But thats just me
---
While arguing semantics of it being done in the RL without intent to kill, logically this is what Jigsaw would've said "It wasn't a wound intended to kill, but a wound to warn and to free me."
---
Disconnect every game I'm about to win or lose
---
No legacy head? XD
---
50% of players play SWF. On average there will be a 2 stack in every lobby.
---
Prestige also has nothing to do with rank, with easy deranking and regular rank resets. Not to mention awful matchmaking.
---
You could NEVER do this without doing the same for killer as survivor is already significantly stronger, and so many perks would utterly break when you can have 6 other perks in a build with them. Survivors would NEVER not have DS and BT on every single one, self care gets a free slot, then exhaustion and on top of that you get healing boosts, aura reading, prove thyself. The entire game goes faster and has built in mechanisms to stop the killer being efficient ever.
---
There is no rational way you could think this would ever be balanced.
---
My Claudette - Well Make It, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Were Gonna Live Forever/Botany Knowledge 
---
Though I keep messing with new perks so it might change again
---
I feel the only problem with nurse is how easy the 2 or 1 more blink add-ons are obtained. The 2 more blinks either needs more downsides or turned into a ultra rare and the 1 blink needs to be very rare and rare instead of rare and uncommon.
---
But like, just steal he fucking leg. What's she gonna do? Hop after you?
---
Infectious fright nurse buff? hmm.. dont think thats a good change
---
His power still doesn't counter all loops and he gets gen rushed și hard because he doesn't have mobility, snow ball potential or stall. And the 40 bugs are real.
---
You still don't get it, NO STATUS EFFECT, just bad teammates who miss the skill checks is what the first guy meant
---
&gt; Its odd because to us Americans it just sounds like summer.
---
Thats because you guys are on the same latitude as Northern Africa. And, you also have to turn off the AC. Since this isnt actually common in europe, houses are built to contain heat, and ACs are rare, especially in private houses.
---
nobody is gonna point out the survivor in chat screenshot has no pants on?
---
I do get it. The original commenter didn't specify it clearly enough for me to recognize it as a joke. Just stop dude.
---
Depends on your playstyle. Sprint burst is better for getting the headstart at the beginning of a chase. Lithe is better for breaking away in a chase. Balanced landing is better for prolonging a chase, and dead hard is better for a second chance(If used correctly)
---
Legion would go first. Jigsaw minions are crafty fuckers and Ghostface at least has experience. Any member of the Legion is just an edgy teenager with asthma.
---
Urban, Spine chill, Empathy, Iron will 
---
Urban - obvious as you can so easily sneak around the map while crouched
---
Spine chill - if you're on a gen or doing something else, you know when the killer is most likely heading towards you and you can crouch away on good time.
---
Empathy - a good perk in general but can tell you of the killer's general location when they've hit or are chasing an injured survivor. Has a huge range too. I'd say due to its alternative uses (like supporting teammates) make it a better choice than something like dark sense which will also tell you where the killer is. 
---
Iron will - in the case that you are found and injured, you won't make a noise, fairly obvious. Could be substituted but I think it's a great perk and you have it teachable too.
---
Some alternatives (to Iron Will) 
---
Lightweight - leaving scratch marks for 3 less seconds can be very useful. A lot of survivors don't realise how obvious scratch marks are and how long they last (7 secs) as they don't show for the survivor themselves. So it's a pretty decent option Imo. Worth trying but may be better to calculate when to run (using empathy) and when it's not 100% safe use Urban to sneak around. 
---
Self-care - its gonna waste a lot of time but if you don't have a medkit or you really want to run a toolbox for stealthy fast repairs, then it's obviously a decent option. However, if you are hit and injured, and have iron will it'll much less of a risk to stay injured whilst you sneak around. As well as this you can use empathy to locate other injured teammates and should be able to tell if they are in danger. I'd recommend you stay away from self-care as the other options are superior.
---
but why is it called a god palet
---
It depends on your playstyle. 
---
At high level, Dead hard and Balanced are way better. Sprint burst is good if you play immersed and want a quick speed boost. Lithe is...okay, I think its the worst though. Its really situational and often is a waste. 
---
Head on is a meme.
---
I haven't played Meg yet to try it but would Sprint burst require me to walk the whole match in order to have it for a Chase or is there a way to start sprinting without using the perk?
---
I read that when you guys that heat wave a decade or so ago.  The one that led to so many deaths of elderly in France.  We were shocked over here when we read about that.  There was something about France's nuclear power plants having to shut down because the river water was too warm ... was that true?
---
What rank are you playing at? For me it almost seems like it's nothing but camping and tunneling killers until you get to purple ranks, but from there it seems like almost every killer is running BBQ and Ruin.
---
You'd need to walk or use urban evasion and crouch everywhere. I prefer dead hard personally
---
What's head on? New to survivor so haven't  memorized there perks yet
---
That person made the effort to come for you. Could have at least let them do it and have the points. They just completely wasted that time.
---
But the Nurse is calling!
---
Forgot to include the lunge distance increase for EW3.
---
1. You don’t know pallet or map layouts. And you don’t know where to run when you get to a generator so you randomly run anywhere.
---
2. Your teammate threw all the pallets.
---
Don’t worry someone will tell you that you suck soon
---
HA!!! IT WAS HAUNTED XD!
---
As others have said, your entire Inventory gets wiped clean when you prestige, aside from cosmetics and your base kit of perks.
---
Stay in a locker for 3 seconds, jump out to stun the killer
---
Freddy
---
/s
---
I usually give survivors one chance before i start being toxic
---
After that whatever happens is on them
---
I’ve been running ghost face with ruin, bbq, overcharge and surveillance. I’ve been playing mostly a three gen strat with this build and you can very easily maintain awareness on their progress. Lock down your area with occasional random patrols to others to stay unpredictable. With overcharge and surveillance you are able to see exactly which generators are being worked on. Sneaking up and snatching a survivor off a generator never gets old. Hook them, kick your gen, drop back into stealth and wait for some poor unfortunate soul to attempt touching the generators again.
---
No
---
thats what kept happening when i tried to get these XD
---
Not just the Pig but Saw as a whole, I want Tapps outfits as well.
---
Looks great! Love the detail in the mask, it's sick. Was thinking of doing a Legion (Frank) cosplay for Halloween this year :D
---
Either BL or DH
---
billy is more of an easy boss
---
Every perk at once
---
Benny don't let them shittalk you! You're handsome and you can do it!
---
🤤🥵🥵
---
I’m going to break my spine
---
you suck
---
Truth is, the proposition was rigged from the start..
---
I can hit greats anyway so I can actually have 4 perks
---
'I love wasting my team's time and bloodpoints and putting them in a vulnerable position, not to mention making me seem like a toxic player so people don't heal me and can't get WGLF stacks or We'll Make It proc!'
---
You can google it, it's really easy to find out what the killers look like under their masks with some light research. They didn't just leave a blank sleight, they did put faces under most of the masks
---
*break break*
---
Lithe gang lithe gang
---
i miss the old brand new part :(
---
There we go
---
Rule 63
---
Balanced Landing by far. No argument to be had, it enables so many bullshit loops if you can route properly.
---
It's probably the map swamp barely has any pallets
---
Or ask how many hours do you have in dbd lol
---
Thanks to matchmaking - this isnt a meme, its reality.
---
Thumbs up bhvr!
---
Does that mean that Adrenaline, Decisive Strike and Balanced Landing are all broken? I play 50/50 survivor and killer at red ranks, and I sure do see a lot of survivors at those ranks using those perks.
---
They also banned for the multiple killer bug and sitting on top of the rock on the hill.
---
It would be such an effort to get all these teachable perks together on 1 character that has 7 perk slots.
---
I think the biggest problem with 2v8 is map size, they just aren't big enough to support 10 people and it would end up with 2 kill with friends nurses warping across the map never allowing the survivors a single moment of rest
---
Gonna be a common response but dead hard and balanced are the best imo. I can go through a bit of detail though and point out some downsides to all of them.
---
Dead hard: Just great for continuing the chase, can even help end it but reaching that last pallet or window to another long loop. The uses are so vast. Especially considering it makes you invulnerable to all hits (i.e Billy's chainsaw) and if you think they may have no ed - stay injured and have the last laugh!
---
However, high level killers will start to predict you have it, or remember you having it and will wait if out to insta hit you. It can also be hard to use at first, you have to time it well - either when you hear or see the killer making a large lunge (I usually try and bait it but running in a straight line so they think they can get the lunge) or use it to cross back over them or something like that as its one of the few perks that can make you invulnerable. 
---
Balanced: amazing for extending chases or losing the killer. As well as this, the base 75% reduction in stagger makes it so strong as it can open up loops that wouldn't otherwise be viable.
---
However, there's a chance that it might not be usable at all on some maps or it will be hard to find a location where its gonna work. That's the only real downside but it's not big enough for people to stop running
---
Sprint burst: the best perk for evading a suprise attack of just stopping that initial hit.
---
Walking around sucks tho. Like that is a big enough issue that stops people using it.
---
Lithe: it's great, you will always find a window. But the benefits are never as good as the other sprint bursr perks because you don't always know what exactly is on the other side of the vault or how to maneouver to a safe location. Something like balanced you usually have a clear path to run after you drop. However the perk can be so fun with dance with me and/or quick and quiet. These three together are just so fun honestly. Can lose the killer instantly.
---
Head on: not really worth analysing. Funny perk but has nothing on the others.
---
I'm more worried about the combo of the *odd* perks with a tombstone+tuft of hair build on a 1 man game
---
Oh no are we using "le" again?
---
you should highlight it...took me a while
---
0/10 hair not blue
---
Agreed.
---
A stoner survivor would just be great in general honestly. Great cosmetic opportunities.  Plus I feel he and Jeff would get along.
---
Exactly before the update
---
I play Plague so *projectile vomits menacingly*
---
At the highest level, yeah it is. Mid ranks dead hard is a huge competitor. This guy says he's new to survivor so dead hard is probably the best option for him?
---
Which was just one of innumerable retcons in Retcon the Series. 
---
Still love the Saw series for its ridiculous gusto though...
---
Those don’t stack
---
im pretty sure they do
---
ive seen it first hand
---
even tested on KYF 🤔
---
The entity was displeased with your bad manners.
---
I mean you're just wrong, keep the downvotes coming if you like. Literally go watch the people who stream this game at high ranks and see how people with 3k hours in the game lose as killer because 2nd chance perks combined with still problematic maps are an issue. Buddy give me a good enough map, and give yourself anyone besides Billy or Nurse, and I could personally run you around rancid abbataoir for the entire match. 
---
Many of the problematic perks are still so. Decisive strike is not as much of an issue, but when you have 4 survivors in a game running multiple second chance perks each (dstrike, adrenaline, unbreakable, etc) you actually cant physically deal with the amount of time wasted. This isnt factoring the use of instant heals, still problematic loops and near infinites (I'm looking at your slaughterhouse long window spawn) that allow good enough survivors to win pretty much every game.
---
Even BHVR themselves said the maps were still unbalanced in the most recent event stream, and if you've looked at the way the game plays nothing for survivors has really changed. Survivors can still end the game in 5 minutes, survivors can easily run you around certain maps with the insane number of pallet spawns, many loops are basically impossible to mind game survivors on who know how to optimally move, there are series' of maps such as auto haven where most of the pallets are straight safe, or maps like farm, say Thompson house for example, when the sheer amount AND safety of pallet spawns are so strong that some killers, even people with thousands of hours in the game, will just DC upon loading into those stages.
---
This doesnt mean you cant win of course, you can, but it is more often the result of bad survivors than it is actually presentation of your skill as a killer. This is all without even the consideration of SWF. If you want to see how good you can be in SWF, go watch Marths experiment on YouTube where he and his premade have a 97%ish winrate to rank 1 from rank 20 (I think they "lost 1 or 2 games dont remember exactly how many) where they run no perks and dont communicate over comms. 
---
I dont know man, you tell me, does an almost 100% win rate sound like a balanced game to you?
---
Probably, however BL is a perk you kinda have to learn to use so getting used to routing with it early can be helpful.
---
Yeah true. I get ya.
---
which game is this ? Name ?
---
Myers for me
---
Or you guys just didnt do so well this time, and you underestimated the killer.
---
removed we ask you take part of this sub Reddit before advertising your streams thank you
---
I firmly believe that Sprint Burst is the best Exhaustion perk for newer players. It essentially allows you to get the headstart in a chase, allowing you to not think about where your loops are and focus on generators. The downside is you have to walk or crouch everywhere. Once you get a better feel for mapping out escape plans as you're on a generator, you'll see how the other Exhaustion perks can benefit you more just by being an active you can choose to use.
---
And again, that time commitment doesn't equate to rank. I played mostly killer for a month, and due to rank resets, was down in the brown ranks with a p3 survivor with every perk maxed out.
---
Nearly every survivor you come up against has plenty of teachables. It's VERY easy to get optimal builds, and you passively gain good, but not top meta, perks at the same time.
---
There's DAILY posts of new players coming up against people with perfect builds or vice versa. It's simply not going to magically work because "only high skill killers will have to deal with it."
---
Not to mention it further dumpsters M1 killers and pushes even more to "only play nurse/hillbilly."
---
Just bought the game last friday and it was Myers for me next was wraith although I'm at rank 20 so what do I know xD
---
Yeah if the survivors are not self aware enough it's an easy 4k.
---
I mean most of him isn’t. Face is though.
---
It's all good, both of them are pretty good!
---
Wraith best killer
---
Ironically only.
---
So a killer should have no addons? And the whole point of making her Terror Radius bigger was so that it's easier to be stealthy. Early Warning = More Time To Hide = Easier to Get Away
---
This was actually funny af
---
To be fair, that is what SWF is for
---
Servers: Arent even on PC, so I would expect them at around August.
---
FPS: They mentioned they want to optimize the game further, to allow more FPS on console
---
It takes maybe an extra minute of gameplay to cleanse all of the totems on the map - MAYBE. Probably less than a minute when you know where the totem spawns are.
---
You can look for totems while looking for the next generator, a lot of the time totems spawn near the generator, etc. it’s not like cleansing totems is a whole different side quest that is going to dramatically delay the game.
---
ffs stop following me all over this sub
---
Okay thanks, so their are currently no "solid" dates ?
---
it’s literally a coincidence bucko
---
What is this from?
---
Balance wise yes, give nurse no addons. If they want to give her some shit addons that barely do anything again fine. Nurse as a concept is broken, she ignores everything in the game and with two blinks default she will still by far be the best killer in the game. Nurse would never EVER come out in her current stage at this point and the community has basically accepted shes a joke thats here to stay. So get on with it, remove omegablink, three blink, 5 blink and every variation of those addons 
---
Still if you make nurse one blink or whatever she is beyond awful so she has to stay as she is. With addons nurse should be 4k 5 genning most teams in her current state.
---
not as far as I know. The only "solid" thing would be their Roadmap, which marks Servers at "summer"
---
When I play killer, I often pretend I don't see them while I go regress a gen or something before I go attack them. Thankfully immersive players aren't good at looping.
---
They should put Mori animations on sale in the store. Cause some of the base ones suck ass.
---
Okay thanks for the help, appreciate your time.
---
Prestige doesn't effect ultra rare spawn rates at all. There was a test done to see if prestiging effected item spawns and it barely did
---
Who the fuck is Artyom
---
no iron will claudet ? Mehh
---
Take my upvote and go
---
They do unfortunately.... and now that youtubers like Monto have shown it, the game begins lol
---
So are servers or Freddy first?
---
No.
---
Ghostf Ace In The Hole
---
If they give survivors one more slot they should give killers one as well.
---
WHEEEEEEEEZE
---
I don't know either but I assume freddy
---
Really what extra powers did the new survivor bring that you need a perkslot for? Exactly none, go away.
---
If survivor fucks up, he loses the game. Basically.
---
i play both sides, killers are way too fucking op
---
Bad idea.If you want to give more perk slots to survivors, do the same for killers.And learn to get gud
---
Joint 1st - Dead Hard and Balanced Landing. Dead Hard is very versatile since you can use it on command (when injured), and if you're good at looping it's incredibly strong. The downsides are that insta-downs negate it and killers can wait for you to use it first. Balanced Landing has the potential to be stronger than Dead Hard, especially on maps like Haddonfield and The Game. The main downside is finding areas to use it on maps with less areas to fall from. 
---
3rd - Lithe. Lithe is my personal favourite exhaustion perk because it'sthe best perk for escaping a chase, rather than prolonging a chase.  As I play entirely solo, I don't trust my teammates to get generators done while I'm being chased so I'd rather escape the chase. Combo it with Dance With Me and you get a speed boost with no scratch marks. Downsides are that you need to find a vault spot to use it. This makes it extra stressful when you play against Trapper. 
---
4th - Sprint Burst. You can't sprint around the map. It's just as much of a hindrance as it helpful. In my experience sprint burst is used by survivors who aren't very good at looping and don't want the killer to chase them in the first place. 
---
5th - Head On. Basically a meme.
---
Depends on your preference. Sprint burst is probably the easiest to use and more consistent, but BL and Lithe can really win you the game if you know how to use them. And Dead Hard is pretty meh tbh.
---
“Doesn’t have mobility” he has 115% speed
---
And he doesn’t get gen rushed because ruin exists
---
It's git gud buddy and please leave your 12 year old opinions for your mom and dad to ignore, the internet doesn't want em.
---
Wow someone is salty
---
Remember that 4 killer perks must equal 16 survivor perks soo survivors dont need more perks
---
Im the claudette running object of obsession, so definitely not immersed 😂😂
---
I am not your buddy, sweetie and why so butt hurt? You was the one who made the post
---
This was my thought process: Why not include a real life killer (JTR) who is more of a mystery than he is a man? It’s why Jack the Ripper is so popular, because we can change him. We can create a backstory and identity for him because he essentially doesn’t have one. Were as survivors are involved, I agree that they shouldn’t be.
---
lol! i can already imagine all the false intel i'd purposely feed the others. i'd use totally inappropriate ones too when the situation doesn't warrant it
---
Forgot the shitpost tag
---
I saw Clowns with 4 different gens perks getting gen rushed in 4 minutes. And now 115% means mobility ? So for you every killer has map pressure 
---
...
---
ye but as survivor you just hold M1 most of the game and press space bar every now and then
---
Maybe instead of giving survivors the ability to use 5 perks why don't we just buff the bad perks so they become more viable. And don't take this as an insult, but if you think Self Care is mandatory VS Freddy and that you need urban VBS Hag you obviously need to play the game more before complaining on Reddit.

Pretty sure it doesn't, but Solidarity isn't that good of a perk TBH, try something else.

That design is from the Kotobukya Bishoujo Horror figure collection and I freaking love it. I bought the Myers one (though at the price I paid, it's likely a knockoff but still looks amazing).
---
LOLOL
---
Your perks are also 4 x better than ours and the amount of perks killers get has nothing to do with this post which you would've known if you didn't just instantly started crying that killers should get more perkslots too "because" and actually read the reasoning behind it.
---
Incensed Ointment and Worship Tablet are good. One thing I think her addons could use is any Vile Purge related ones applying to Corrupt Purge also. I don't think it would be broken, and would give more of a reason to use the increased charge time, decreased cooldown etc. ones.
---
Glory Face
---
Not sure why you would nerf her add-ons. Most nurse players can do just fine without, and some even do better without than with. Nurses power doesn't lie in her add-ons but her base power, her add-ons just make her more oppressive than she already is.
---
Yea you trolling
---
Meh weak troll tho
---
I actually made a suggestion for BHVR not some 12 year old kid who doesn't even read what I wrote and instantly goes crying like a killersided bitch.
---
I think it has to do with when you watch the movie for the first time. If you watched it when it first came out, or when you were very young and impressionable, then it's probably much scarier. I saw Halloween for the first time when I was very young and it scared the bejesus out of me
---
He was being a dick which sadly happens in this game. Any time a survivor points a teammate out to me I point I go for the person pointing.
---
That's not true though.  
---
If a survivor fucks up, he might lose a loop. He might have to drop the pallet early.  
---
He might get hit once.  
---
Then ... he might get downed.  
---
Then he might get carried to his first hook.
---
After that you still got 2 hooks to go + you have 3 buddies helping you.
---
There are a lot of second chances and fuck up possibilities for survivors. And it's good that way.  
---
Survivors fuck up CONSTANTLY.
---
The problem is, that killers don't got that room to fuck up. That's why killers complain about being frustrated.  
---
The time is on the survivors side.
---
Chase a survivor for too long because he's abusing very loop-friendly spot?
---
You've just lost 2 gens.
---
The game is 33% over.
---
vs
---
Oh I ran into a dead end. I have to take a hit for it.  
---
I dont know anybody that feels pressured as a survivor. You don't got that: "If I do some mistakes, the game is over!" attitude as survivor.
---
Maybe; either way, Tapp didn't die. :V
---
Imgur link? reddit wont let me save it
---
It is a decent counter against sloppy tho?
---
i was also thinking teh survivors could have some sort of inate perk or power like killers do, since they only look different. either something passive or active. another solution would be to be allowed to see the killer's choice in the lobby. i was thinking they could offer that as an option the killer could choose to allow, at least, for some sort of post-game benefit like more points. i also assume at some point they'll add perk presets so you could switch between 2 or more sets. or one perk slot could be a special one that you can choose to be replaced by whatver given perk in the event that the killer ends up being a particular one that you set for that.
---
This is LITERALLY the exact build I have on my P3 Meg. Fuck lmao
---
Even now it's a pallet city, unbeatable against survivors who know what they're doing unless you're Spirit, Nurse and maybe Huntress(she can throw over annoying unmindgameable loops)
---
Awwww poor baby. And yeah I am a bitch and proud of it.At least I am not a piece of trash who comes on reddit because you think you are entitled to have everything go your way.Apparently you was dropped on your head when you was born because you sound ridiculous
---
Well, thankfully (IMO), the devs do care about balance and I'm willing to bet most players do as well. It's kind of a key component to a healthy game.
---
Thank you.
---
We have one masky boy that can crouch so I think everything can happen .
---
Quality meme
---
I mean, if any killer facecamps, the other survivors would have at least 1 minute to do gens, 2 minutes if the hooked survivor struggles.
---
Pair that with if the first survivor ran the killer around for a while causing them to be salty enough to facecamp and it sounds like you've got yourself a you-problem.
---
Just being able to put on another meta-cancer-360-god tier-survivor-perk to the kit would make survivors even more op. And yes, I main survivor.
---
Sounds like a bug unfortunately, one of many. I heard there is a hotfix coming out, I don't know when though
---
Sure, but the amount of times you find someone who also needs healing aren't that any. You're better of using Botany and or a med-kit to counter Sloppy
---
Hmm you didn't answer the question I wonder why.
---
Also good luck facing a Hag with no Urban Evasion, have fun crouching away from your hook at the speed of a handicapped turtle while she comes walking back to it.  
---
Seriously your first knee-jerk response of "killers too reee!' kinda disqualified you from serious discussion, try better next time.
---
There are 15 killers, yeah, but still only one comes in at a time. So I don't get your point.
---
TIL I'm buying from the wrong guy, because everything still hurts.
---
Balanced is like Huntress. Strong, but only on the right map. Shelter Woods? Kiss your perk slot goodbye. Haddonfield? Welcome to godhood.
---
Well, there are several tweeks they made for the 2v8 mode, one being that survivors require 3 hits to down, the other being that the time it takes for you to die on the hook (chair in Identity V) is significantly shorter. They also added a shop aspect for which you can purchase items in game with points earned within the game fir both Survivor and Killers. It also needs you to complete 7 gens, while the time to complete each gen is increased as well.
---
Splish splash, your opinion is trash
---
He shouldn't have :/
---
100% Trapper is the hottest
---
Please remember to follow [Rule 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/wiki/rules#wiki_1._uncivil_behavior) everyone.
---
Your idea is imbalanced as all hell. Sabo needs something, but this would literally make killer quit the game entirely.
---
Oh yaya
---
Yea true, i think ill just stick with auto
---
Well at least you could counter it with the ol splish splash + salty downvotes and 0 arguments. Good job buddy, you'll do great in public.
---
Oh shit guys she's Phase Crawling, what ever shall we do??
---
r/lostredditors
---
So just break sabo in general? Sure that's not overpowered.
---
So I am from Romania (Central Europe I think) and I don't enjoy playing against a fucking killer from Virginia .
---
The hotfix already came out but didn't fix these issues as it was a hotfix not a full patch.
---
***\*Program doesn't work\****
---
Develloper: WHY ?!?!
---
***\*Program suddenly work\****
---
Only the ultra rare affects the leaning stalk. The other add on would offset the downside of the ultra rare to make regular stalking still usable. Still a fucking mediocre killer even with them.
---
Huntress
---
Survivor these days is just fucking maddening. The amount of times I've been left to go into second state on first hook because they're terrified of actually being chased, or just straight up farmed soon as I'm hooked.
---
And killer wait times are ridiculous. 15-20 mins to even find a lobby then even more time to get the survivors in it. Why does it take so long to "find a match" when you're creating the match???? 
---
I used to love this game. Have over 1k hours. But it's really fucking dead to me right now. No desire to play this shit.
---
There are 4 killer perks and 16 survivor perks in a trial and survivors need more? Right okay. If you think that self care is mandatory against Freddy and UE/Flashlights are needed for Hag, you may just need to get better at the game and stop complaining on Reddit. Freddy and Trapper are by no means strong killers in the slightest, you’re basically asking to make their powers even weaker.
---
I concur with my colleague.
---
I see the good intention, but comms is what makes SWFs broken so I don't think this is a very good idea.
---
Oh right, but still I was just saying there are still bugs even with the hotfix. Maybe a fix will come soon, I have no idea.Btw have you tried restarting the game or uninstalling and reinstalling it to see if it solves the problem?
---
Anna would love to see him, soon.
---
Bad idea
---
Face is plastic shaped as a ghost lol, normal guy, mask , knife, wasn’t impressed the last time they added him as legion, gimme something crazy evil demented. ANSWER= PINHEAD
---
It's modding. Not hacking.
---
Either way, it's safer to not mod in any online game with an anti-cheat service.
---
Not the poster but yes restarting the game or not playing it for a day did fix the issue when I had to deal with
---
It just works
---
Yeah, Susie is a trap,
---
Apparently this film was going to do a collab dlc with left 4 dead and at the end of the movie when it shows all of the monsters in their little squares you will be able to spot a boomer and smoker.
---
I'm surprised they haven't fixed that audio bug yet. Well atleast we can confirm Susie is a trap
---
That, my friend, was a Jake.
---
“Screeching shotgun Noises Continue”
---
Really have you ever faced a trapper with purple and pink addons? Ever had to save someone with 5 hagtraps around them when neither of you have urban or a flashlight? You have to get their early because it's gonna take a while getting to that hook with  -10mph, not to mention doing the same on the way back as you hear her terror-radius coming closer and closer. Then again, no, you haven't, because at rank 12 this never happens.
---
Nurse of course.
---
I see. Thanks for the explanation!
---
How does someone do this?
---
Claudette makes rapid clicking flashlight taunts.
---
*... Well they are a toxic survivor, they don't do much*
---
Depends on how you play, really. I'd recommend getting a group of friends and trying dumb but fun tactics
---
I think he was trying to self teach himself Claudette’s invis
---
And a win for the cook *laughs in bubba*
---
So I’m honestly curious if then tunneling/camping is acceptable without being thought of as toxic (e.g. using NOED)? I play both survivor and killer and have accidentally tunneled and gotten wrath of khan for it. Then brought NOED and got called baby killer. Can someone help me understand please?
---
&gt; her addons
---
As a Nurse main, i think she shouldn't have more than two blinks.
---
You're not a bitch you're 12, stfu go bother your parents.
---
Problem is they are 4. Nor amanda nor Ghostface would be able to take them out all at once.
---
Are ya'll wanking in here or what's going on?
---
Bruh what does facecamping have to do with this? Do you just write what you wanna read? None of you fucking morons have said anything to do with what I wrote, it's a literal fact that with more killers nd more powers our perks become weaker and weaker, it's not even up for debate, but your donkeybrians can somehow not comprehend it, be ashamed.
---
Can you play on groups on the ps4?

---
How?!
---
Entity!
---
That's why!
---
Yah SWF is fine but playing solo is just a disaster. Almost every match I get teamed up with a bunch of white rank potatoes. One is on the hook and the other two went down in a minute, like, what am I supposed to do?
---
I Play Myers, so I will stand, stair and breath heavily until you Fuck up and tier 3, (Cue music)
---
All of them! And two items!

That was the 2003 heatwave.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_European_heat_wave
---
Its true. Article about it from back then:
---
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/12/france.nuclear
---
Yeah, a Trapper with pink and purple add-ons is quite strong, but those add-ons are mandatory for him to be viable, with green, yellow and brown add-ons, he’s near bottom tier. The Hag using their power to prevent the unhook will happen, oh but of course, they shouldn’t use their power, buffing survivors by giving them 20 perks is the right call, someone should make you a game developer.
---
**2003 European heat wave**
---
The 2003 European heat wave led to the hottest summer on record in Europe since at least 1540. France was hit especially hard. The heat wave led to health crises in several countries and combined with drought to create a crop shortfall in parts of Southern Europe. Peer-reviewed analysis places the European death toll at more than 70,000.

There’s a difference between and Claudette and a blendette
---
Yes lets get angry about it!!!
---
If the Huntress knows what they're doing, they'll be able to snipe you when you do stuff like healing or gens, and GOOD Huntresses won't let you abuse pallets on them. If they know when you're going to throw the pallet down, they can just throw the hatchet at you since you're stuck in the animation. Trust me, good Huntresses know how to work around their weaknesses.
---
Yeah how about no 🤣🤣, clearly you havent played dbd enough to understand it. If you put 5 perks on survivors then they gonna put 5 perks on killers, thats really gonna improve things. 🤣
---
I doubted the differences the Legion was multiple people taken whilst Amanda was the only one taken in the Pig's case.
---
Frank, Julie, Susie and Joey all remain their own separate individuals they just go under the moniker of their Gang
---
Yeah the idea of choosing a perk mid-game sounds allright and less of a buff than an extra slot would be. I'd prefer perks to just be that: perks. Not mandatory game-mechanics with a huge powerspike if you accidentally picked the right perk vs the right killer but if that's how they desiggn the game then I'd rather have them punish killers for it than survivors.
---
Nah, you all just suck 🤣🤣
---
Wednesday. Please.
---
Probably by farming their teammates and hiding for the whole match. And they get downed in less than 20 seconds when being chased. They are just everywhere. But at least shitty players in higher ranks know what is happening in the game. They are just dumb and selfish.
---
Good arguments.
---
Lolololol 12 btw.

I’m the killer but ok

They are on sale right now

There's a nice patch in this bug

For some reason this reminds me of "Forget You" by Cee lo Green.
---
Thing is, with old DS and Mettle of Man, they were practically uncounterable. Sure, killers like Huntress could negate MoM with their hatchets, but your ability to negate an overpowered perk was purely dependant on your main. With NOED, you are able to completely get rid of NOED with no perks or items by simply cleansing 5 dull totems; once you do this, the killer is left with an empty perk slot the whole game. Old DS and MoM were wayyy more overpowered compared to NOED, considering there were literally no ways to avoid it and it gave a heavy advantage to the Survivors; whereas NOED is completely reactable and counterable, even after somebody gets downed by it.
---
This response is confusing me.
---
I play Spirit, *vacuum noises*
---
Ruin is mandatory, if you don't use ruin or if ruin is found within the first minute (which happens quite often) the game can be over in 5 minutes which shouldn't be possible.
---
This scene ruined an almost perfect thriller :(
---
They put the colourblind feature in the survey about things the community would be most interested in seeing, so it’s possible it may come soon.
---
Where are you getting that killers are 300 auric cells? It's 9000 cells and you can only buy the original chapters and character with cells.Licensed killers and DLC you have to pay with money
---
7 fucking perks holy shit.....have ever gone past rank 10? or are you stuck in the 20?
---
The very idea that you think that only high ranks will experience 4 people with 7 slots and that is ok is mind nubbing. 
---
Have you eever played as killer? i mean ever? And i dont mean play as in play one game and done, i mean play and reach rank one.
---
Hell yeah this is indeed good news for me! 👍

On PC, nurse

On Ps4/Xbox idk maybe Billy or Spirit

Don't need Iron Will if you don't interact with the killer all game *taps forehead*
---
No you're just too dumb to have a proper conversation. I think it's the new generation having spend too much time on their phones or something, literally wish you'd bring up good counterarguments but all I get is low IQ drivel.
---
If you’re seeing Claudettes they’re doing something wrong
---
That's weird. Why did the hatch spawn when there's only one survivor left? I was in a match yesterday at Lery's. One DCed, other one died and me and my friend found the hatch. Eventually got the exit gates done but I decided to not go through the exit gate and go through the hatch. 
---
(FYI: The Killer wasn't bad, he was actually being nice and let me and my friend go)
---
And then you're detected too early or behind a wall and you have to wait 30 seconds for your power to come back...
---
Just run cooldown add-ons.
---
I know that feel. When I'm rank 8 and I get 2 survivors on my team that don't even have a 2nd perk slot yet. Then when I play killer, people run Object of Obsession, DS and Borrowed Time and loop me into oblivion.
---
Hey man, when is Carson streaming Dead By Daylight?
---
Yea same for me, usually when they t-bag after a pallet i let it go..but after the 2nd pallet and he keeps t-bagging well fuck every one else imma camp this sonuva bitch
---
Yes.
---
He is right though
---
&gt; Stay in a locker for 3 seconds, jump out to ~~stun~~ get grabbed/slapped by the killer
---
ftfy
---
I had a similar experience when a guy was teabagging me from the beginning and so I face camped him. Gave the others a chance to survive but they kind of gave up and said "that poor David." It was a Jake.
---
i love GF ;c
---
Balanced Landing if you can learn a few loops. Not only is it a great exhaustion perk, you also get a bad ass passive bonus, something unique to BL.
---
Dead Hard is good but it requires really good timing. As much as this perk is used, it’s a little overrated because of how much skill it requires. I would say 90% of survivors that use this probably have the perk go to waste. 
---
If you’re just learning the game, I’d say Lithe or Sprint Burst are your best options. You can easily get your exhaustion off to at least give you distance pretty easy.
---
Head on. IDK. It feels gimicky at best but it’s fun. Haven’t seen anyone actual optimize this in a loop yet so this is probably your worst choice.
---
Happens to me a lot too. Some other things that happen to me, like Sprint Burst doesn't activate when I first start sprinting, I have to let go and press Sprint again to use it. I can't heal my teammate, then they start following me around and teabagging signalling to me they need healing and I have no way to tell them I can't heal them. When I hit great skill checks the bar fills up fully then drops back down to where it actually is, and regression does the opposite, it empties the bar and then goes back to the actual state. I sometimes can't wiggle while being carried which is frustrating especially when people are taking hits for you to buy you wiggle time. There's like a million gamebreaking bugs right now, just waiting on the devs to take action on it.
---
9000 one is “iridescent shards(blue)
---
I’m talking about yellow one
---
Love how you only blurred your name 🤣
---
Even if you were rank 20 I'd listen to your arguments if they had some form of logic attached to them but you're the type of person who's not interested in what the other side says and rther just go off on dumb rants like this is some kind of rapbattle. Go upvote some more memes dude stay out of balance discussions, stop using your downvotebutton while you're at it, just realize the real opinion that's trash was yours all along and just stay out of things that you're not interested in.
---
Is the queue location depended. The queue for me are so long that I never play killer even though I want to from time to time. Unpopular opinion: There should be token system preventing players from playing just one role. Everyone should have the chance to play killer a few time without waiting 10 minutes
---
Oh the irony.
---
I would absolutely agree that the game is far better now in terms of balance than it was two years ago, or even one year ago. 
---
The major problem remaining now are that Gens are too easy to do, and Killers often have little means of countering their progression, other than Ruin, which is very unreliable, sometimes doing a lot and sometimes doing virtually nothing. 
---
Most of the Killers in the roster are either poor or mediocre in applying pressure in a meaningful way, with the best being Nurse, Spirit, or Billy. 
---
If the Developers were to do something that would make Survivor objectives a little more than just "Hold M1" to fill a bar, the game would be interesting and possibly go a long way to the best possible balance. 
---
Constantly offering band-aid fixes by the way of teachable perks is not how you fix a game.
---
haha ! you didn't see my build with distorsion, sole survivor and calm spirit!
---
Oh, so Myers is a Faceless One
---
Same. If I can get a gen in a shed, i can trap that shit up tight. If I fat a basement in a shed, I'll kill every survivor as they swarm to save their friends. Escape through the window? Trapped. Go for the pallet door? Trapped. Want to use the safe door and loop tight, corners are trapped. It's my death trap scenario. 4k almost every game.

I’m going to facecamp you for this
---
Did they introduce special, bigger maps, or does it just work on regular sized maps?
---
This whole post is about killers needing ruin to extend the game, which tends to be more true at higher ranks. More gens extends the game for both side, but this is an intended buff for the killer. You literally said “it would extend the time for the killers and not the survivors” which still doesn’t make sense, this is also only meant for higher ranks where better survivors could handle the more generators. I even said this solution is not ideal but would be the easy one without fundamentally changing the whole game, did you even read what I said?
---
Feel free to bring up a single good argument, oh you're not gonna? The irony.
---
His Terror Radius and lunge distance is normal.
---
The only way I see survivors needing a fifth perk slot is if you go solo. Solo play is always a crap-shoot, maybe make it so you have 5 perk slots as survivor but the 5th gets disabled when you group up?  In the grand scheme of things it might make solo play more appealing.
---
As far as killers go I think we're good with 4 perks, though maybe give us automatic Franklin's if 3/4 of survivors bring items.
---
Not sure how this would break sabo but okay. Let's just leave it a garbage perk.
---
MoM, Wake Up, urban evasion, self care
---
Feeling cute, might bully a p3 caludette later, idk
---
Well, you literally said a killer can get 3/4 kills if they camp which is... just no, unless you have altruistic survivors that are also rank 20.
---
And no, not really. So what that against 2/16 killers, one REALLY GOOD perk is less good. How would adding a fifth slot help? So you could have Adrenaline, Self-care, balanced landing, decisive strike and borrowed time? Man if that does not scream "I need crutches to do gud" I don't know what does.
---
And, falling back on insulating anyone who brings up how bad of a claim this is really shows maturity and definitely doesn't weaken your arguments. Good job, sir I'd recommend taking a chill pill, maybe practice a little and come back when you're a little more up for friendly discussion.
---
are you really gonna run self care or urban evasion in every game for the *chance* there may be a freddy or a hag? you do that bub
---
Well what rank are you and where do you live? In all the time I played, I only went with people way out of my rank if they were a SWF
---
Kind of when a dog gets confused, and head tilts.
---
Oh, you're staring at me? Instead of running away?
---
Killer will be like: My internet is fine, you just suck at the game
---
Another way for survivors to have an advantage even when they’re not SWF? What a fantastic idea

I personally think ebonics are right just as they are. Why even bother killing a survivor if they're dead on hook anyways? Ebony speeds the game up and creates a real sense of urgency and fear for survivors.
---
Comparing pallet looping to nurse, talk about a stretch. Ones part of the game fundamentals, other is game breaking. Sorry but i cant agree with that
---
They're rank 20 and don't know how to hit skill checks.
---
Yeah we get it solo survivor is harder than SWF, it's been noted they're working on it, stop bringing it up every thread. The increasing killerroster going from 5 to 15 being a significant nerf to survivors that literally nobody (including BHVR balancing team) seems to be able to wrap their minds around is something that needs to be talked about more, I'd just as happily see someone disagreeing with good arguments but stop derailing into a generic "swf vs solo"-thread.
---
I was getting 2 minute queues last night for the first time since the update, might already be clearing up
---
After not playing this game for like a year, coming back to still waiting in the lobby for centuries is so disappointing :(   new killers and everything doesn't make a difference to me. 
---
...having to invite my friend every single time we die... ugh.
---
this happened yesterday and it felt so good
---
Oh nvm lol
---
Funny how survivors don’t use a perk anymore now that it’s not broken
---
*run in meggy
---
Or that the plague isn't actually a high priestess
---
I can’t drain your meter if I turn away from you.
---
I think Michael is fine. He's a snowballer and his bread and butter is tier 3. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your rework idea, but it sounds like a nerf, to be honest.
---
Been seeing these a lot lately and a tbag always preceeds it, coincidence of course but gloriously satisfying regardless.
---
yea it's way to easy to pip/black pip as survivor.
---
But still… rank 20-16 are something else. Those are typically the new players.
---
Lmaoooo
---
There has been an influx of clips like this and they have all gone the same way just about
---
hey ghost face.
---
Why do you look like a female mad hatter?
---
I have to try that build sometime. And even better you did this on a cornfield map.I usually use Scratched Mirror and burn a Lery's offering just for giggles
---
This is the last day of June...
---
Because you didn't bring up why this was a bad "claim" you just said some "gitgud you're just mad about facecamp"-bullshit which is just as insulting as me calling you a fucking moron, so take your own advice and stfu. There is a growing problem with perks being mandatory vs killers and it keeps growing with every new killer, maybe an extra perkslot wasn't the perfect solution but I don't see you bringing up anything better and instead you just wanna ignore the problem and pretend it doesn't exist.
---
It would make it insanely overpowered for swf. Not sure how you don't see that
---
All characters and survivors are all 500 auric cells usually. Currently they are on sale for 300 (besides ghostface)
---
Tbh I really don't know
---
They severely lowered chase music for survivors., it was intentional.
---
I just posted it for ya
---
in the basement stairs… ? :/
---
People play her bc she's best girl
---
That’s funny considering you ignored all my points in the last comment. Oh and other people downvoted you not just me, so that explains itself.
---
I like to have a mix of selfish perks, which benefit me, and teammate perks like we’ll make it and borrowed time,
---
While my point was SWF is essentially a few more perks for the survivors it wasnt meant to derail or belittle your argument. If you read my statement it doesn't suggest any change to SWF from its current form. You keep referencing the number of killers like that matters, the number of survivors has also increased - both with their own respective perks. 
---
Its more on the balanced side then not, you just have to play killer as well to see the differences. Both sides have crutch perks, BP farm perks etc but the only other way I see a comprimise to your argument is suggesting survivors see who the killer is pre-match so they can plan accordingly (I'm against this).
---
Just look at it as a challenge that exists in the game your playing that you can rise to or move on. If you insist on arguing though please include more information as to how you feel your in the right to get more constructive feedback.
---
Ruin shouldn't be mandatory tbh
---
Lithe and Dance with me in cornfield…
---
Well, I actually did when I implied that in a two minute span, 3 generators could be completed, and if you're feeling insulted about me saying clearly you weren't good enough and got killed (why else would you make this thread), and besides that, in high-level play you'll hardly see anyone not playing Nurse, Billy or Huntress because they're simply the best killers, where the best perks still work.
---
I've seen enough rank 1's escape and have a fine time with playing, and I've seen them die enough times too. It's generally not the perks that are the problem, just the team you play with.
---
(That's part of the reason you don't know the killer before the game, if you did everyone would just change perks to counter them. It's a gamble what you bring)
---
I love Reddit. All the newbs come out of the woodworks.
---
Really upsetting that he’s platform exclusive, as far as I’m aware the Xbox 360 had l4d 1&amp;2, which I played for years,
---
*everyone buys the saw chapter for Tapp*
---
It's not a rework, it's a rewrite. He power works the same as the in-game version.
---
Iron Will,Balanced Landing,Bond and Adrenaline is what I use on my Claudette
---
Sacrifice on a hook, 25 each of the original 4 survivors. Only hook deaths count
---
r/circlejerk
---
So far as far as I can tell it completely disappears. Still, even just toned down is nice.
---
Ace in the hole,Plunderers, Open Handed and Bond. Ace in the hole and Plunderers because it's great for finding items to use and Open Handed with Bond increases how far your bond shows your teammates auras allowing you to give your teammates items basically being support.
---
Love the hair!!!
---
For me it's Legion and Freddy xD Also this movie was nice!
---
Some unfortunate bugs. Are you on console? Haven't see these on PC.
---
&gt; Plague's Pools leading to perma-infection and rendering you broken until she deals with you
---
You shouldn't cleanse anyways though :P
---
&gt; reporting me too for cheating when playing killer which can lead to ban sometimes
---
No it can't, unless you're actually cheating and the survivors have recorded proof. In game reports do NOTHING unless proof is provided.
---
You can but everyone with 300 no matter how many you buys them?
---
I still hear it personally though it is quiet, but I’ve also watched a few streamers where it’s gone completely,
---
Yeah I completely agree with you except for the "loving" it part, actually hurts my soul that noobkids like this decide what hits the frontpage.
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted, that's a solid build.
---
You use to see tye aura of traps with small game.
---
Let’s give a stealth killer bright white colours hah I’m yet to use this outfit personally but when others use it I can see the white lines from miles away.
---
I don't know about you but I see plenty of Jakes... when I'm playing Survivor.
---
Thanks ma'guy
---
Bubba doesn't have a fedora
---
+1500 BP
---
You mean the "HAG SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO CAMP PEOPLE FROM FIRST HOOK TO DEATH OR GET COMPLETELY REKT BY URBAN EVASION ALL DECIDED IN A COINTOSS I LOVE COINTOSSES REEEEEEEE YOU SHOULD BE A DEVELOPER HURHURHURR 20 PERKS HURHURHURHUR" you meant that response? Yeah no I didn't take those seriously sorry buddy.
---
Was the vanilla challenge the questionnaire/quiz that they did or was it something different?
---
At least the OP expressed more thought than lolbad. Your comment is shit.
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Just a quick question, would you receive rewards if you owned L4D/L4D2? I’m not entirely sure for I bought these games before DBD.
---
Derp Min
---
Do you mean elbow? If not I must have missed this pose entirely.
---
You have one spot to use it, and it prractically guarantees the killer a hit if they are close.
---
Honestly spirit is perfect as she can zoom across the map, has great mindgame potential and has a very high skill cap plus her perks are fantastic and she is top tier and can win games easily.
---
I don't think I need to have a discussion with you, the fact that you get -20 points kinda sums up your idea. Like someone said, you clearly need to play the game more so you understand how to counter killer without the use of certain perks. No one is forcing you to run certain perks, and you are not forced either.
---
On PC, if you own Left 4 Dead 1 or 2 you get red shirts with the Left 4 Dead hand logo for Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake and Nea.
---
no, reposti and less good
---
Wow that mask is really good! Did you make it?
---
WHAT A TWIST!
---
Spirit is really fun, strong and fits an aggressive playstyle. Buy her with shards though, unless you don’t care about the money
---
yea it was a joke
---
That’s not a horror movie it’s straight up comedy.
---
If I remember correctly, Valve had some beef with Microsoft over L4D (can't quite remember but I think it had something to do with them making a free PC update paid DLC on Xbox) and since then haven't been particularly keen with console stuff, which I'm assuming is one of the reasons he's not on the console versions.
---
Yeah i run the demon one he has cause it actually makes him difficult to see. If they are gonna have exlusive skins fir buying the whole chapter i dont see why they cant make them a little better
---
they should have make it a green addon that's it.
---
Dead hard/DS/BT/Adrenaline
---
When they introduced the endgame collapse they made it so that regardless of the amount of gens done, as soon as only 1 survivor remains the hatch will spawn. This makes it a race to the hatch for the survivor and killer. Though take not that alot of the times the survivor will not roam the map for the hatch but just look for an exit gate, as soon as the killer closes the hatch the exit gates get powered and EGC begins. Then the killer has to check both doors to prevent the survivor from escaping. Depending on the exit gate locations the survivor can get out because the doors spawned far enough from eachother and the killler “chose” the wrong door first. But alot of the time the doors spawn way too close and the survivor has no chance of escaping because the killer can just keep checking both doors and reach a door before a survivor could open it.
---
I had this same problem. Would literally pick LF anytime i saw a jake and then they would dc when i down them, took me weeks to get it. Now i see jakes almost every match
---
I’m mostly going off of appearance here. Like what would you see in a Souls Bourne game. That’s why Freddy has his own teir, he looks like a player.
---
“Mom says it’s my turn on the gen.”
---
Yeah, until the sale stops
---
Yeah I usually DC on my first blind. It’s even better if you do it right before you actually get blinded
---
Until July 2nd you can buy anyone for 300 cells except Ghostface, it doesn’t matter how many you buy, they’ll stay 300 until the 2nd. Hope this helps
---
NOED, Ruin, unnerving presence, overcharge
---
Ghostnurse 
---
Wait no-
---
Would be nice if he would shove the bell in their mouth and just smack em on the head while going bing bong.
---
wait what am i even supposed to see? :/
---
Nurse doesn't have 115%, so she doesn't have map pressure for you. Ok.
---
It was to do with map changes and patches, back in the day patches had to be a certain size on console, so valve couldn’t modify maps, like “Dark carnival” that map had an end game exploit spot, which they removed on pc, they also couldn’t patch in maps so had to charge for them, 
---
I personally have tattoos of the original 4 survivors but have never played it on Pc, these characters are very special to me, it really sucks ass that I’m locked off from William.
---
Cause you didn't show the outcome of the trial, i assume you lost Kappa
---
Are you ok?
---
As a survivor main, my opinion is 4 perks is fine. Would sometimes be nice to have an extra perk, but then killers should be allowed to get a 5th perk as well
---
ok that was great answer
---
Thank you so much
---
Nah I gave the last survivor hatch tho
---
Do you have the medical term for this?
---
Can we get Kotobukiya to make a Huntress statue?
---
Let's also not forget that it Wakes you up against Freddy, heals you, proceeds to give you a bigger boost than SB.
---
She has 97% and can teleport. I think she definitely has map pressure, even more so with PWYF.
---
I also didn’t say anything about nurse I’m talking about clown. Clown isn’t a bad killer just because he has no map pressure.
---
I truthfully do not understand who downvoted this.
---
 The fact you've to specifically lean and expose THEN chase n hit is super off-putting. In a lot of games you'll get people that know to be alert the second they see him/ unintentionally hear the breakout noise or see someone else marked.
---
With myers its just tier up, literally just hold right click long enough, GF you have to actively not get caught and if they know you're there you might not even pull off a lean stalk in time
---
Bitch-slapivitus
---
Lmao
---
It’s the actual hitbox of Myers
---
Entity: Im gonna stop you right there
---
amen
---
Perfect
---
if you can stall your exhaustion timer w sprint burst you can meme on the killer by activating it mid chase. nothing like getting called a speed hacker because you held your exhaustion timer at one second so you could stop moving then sprint away. at that point its like balanced landing but without needing to fall
---
So nice of the rank 2 to set a good example and bring a brand new part...
---
If only P3 Myers actually looked like that
---
You mean "kill your friends"?
---
Haha okay buddy. Game breaking? Nurse is literally a *character* in the game. Meanwhile, pallets have been bugged for the longest time. Sometimes you get hit through them, sometimes the killer lands on top of them, there’s 3 perms to counter pallets. Saying nurse is gamebreaking, by that logic you must believe that Huntress is since she can hit through them and that Plague is too because her corrupt purge can hit through them as well.
---
This ain’t a repost
---
This looks great. The one thing I would change is leatherface one tier lower than trapper and clown. At least those two get to actually use their power, leatherface’s is worthless against even a half decent survivor
---
You wait several minutes to get a lobby and a survivor with the worst ping ever press ready. Tunelled the shit out of him, of course.
---
People just want psychiatrists cause they can prescribe them the good stuff. “Just take a xanax before starting DBD. Ill also prescribe something that interacts with the xanax for when you are getting camped or tunneled”
---
“Oh you main killer you say? I would recommend the above and an additional diazepam, clonazepam, deprimazepam, zolpidem and some oxy to reduce anxiety. If you do not care for rank you are free to combine with alcohol and cannabis.”
---
\#HAVE YOU HEARD OF DOLLAR SHAVE CLUB? YOU GET BUTT WIPES
---
I play spirit and the mind games are FUCKING REAL
---
That mask looks awesome!
---
Thats true.
---
Clown is a bad killer because his power is countered by survivors who aren't greedy with loops, his power doesn't counter all loops, he is reliant on green and purple add-ons and he is affected by 40 bugs at the moment.
---
Yep, sounds familiar. Then, in the next game, when they get smashed by the killer,they'll spam saying he's a camper or he tunnels, report him too, and say it's unfair.
---
Toxic survivors make toxic killers make toxic survivors make toxic killers make...........
---
(*in Krieg's voice from Borderlands 2*) **CIRCLE OF LIFE!**
---
I don't think new survivors are the same as new killers. Iron Will got a huge boost in popularity after Spirit was released. Not sure which perks killers started using to counter that chapters survivors perks but I doubt it existed considering survivor perks have been underhwelming for 2 years now excluding MoM. I think SWF also need the extra perkslot or whatever should be added to compensate (the perkslot idea got kinda shot down and maybe people are right that it'd be too much). I don't think this is a swf vs solo issue, we have to buff both as both are affected by the bigger killerroster and then try fixing the SWF vs solo thing in other ways because it's a tough one to fix. 
---
I like a challenge but I'm kinda worried that the devs don't realize the challenge gets a bit bigger everytime they release a new killer, that's all I hope that they at least realize this is a thing.
---
This is exactly what I've been running. Adrenaline and BL because duh, Bond because its nice to see your teammates while playing solo, and I swear Iron Will is a perk I can't play without anymore just because of how nice it is not to have to listen to your character being injured.
---
Good team players. Well done!
---
That's gnarly AF.... I love it! Excellent work
---
No you can group up as a survivor before you join a match through the chat. KYF is a option if you want to be killer but since you cant get trophies or bloodpoints its not a real crowd-pleaser.
---
i run urban evasion, iron will, calm spirit, and lightweight asa claudette main smh
---
Le?
---
As killer, the first time I pick someone up, all the music stops for the rest of the match. Pretty weird to hear nothing but footsteps.
---
"Greater Good?! GeT GoOd!"   
---
Oh my God, my laugh hurt me. Quality.
---
I doupt that
---
You just said Tier 3 had the lunge increased removed. That's a nerf.
---
I wish there was servers.
---
1: tunneling the high ping bait is stupid, deal with the real threat first
---
2: You have to wait for a lobby because of player count. The devs themselves said they pull from other regions after a while so you eventually get a game
---
3: Do you seriously think lobby kick would involve the killer in any way?
---
If they tighten the matchmaking its gonna take even lomger to get into a game. Best to wait for dedicated servers and hope for the best.
---
Did they escape?
---
Actually, it wasn‘t a corpse
---
If I tried that they'd just trap me in the corner and saw me.
---
Why? Now they'll think the deserve it.
---
That’s why we’re immersive 😭 
---
I’d love to be better at outplaying a killer in a chase. I’ve tried. Not my strength.
---
I should have let them escape but it wasn’t a swf and I didnt want to wait so I just disconnected
---
When you pick up the last survivor knowing damn well you just obliterated some newbs so you give the last one hatch
---
I'll take "thinly veiled stab at killers being the problem" for $200.

This whole community is absolute cancer.

Freddys Blood Warden can be downright cruel with end-game collapse, shut the hatch with a slugged survivor - wait until the collapse bar is 50% then hook them. All others survivors still in the match get killed by the entity.
---
Sorry, but without double ultra rare add-ons, I can't put him higher.

I still think survivors are really strong and better than killers, but that’s not the point of this post lmao.

the no wiggle bar is a bug in the game currently. and the mori is a tombstone. this post is so wholesome ur such a rank 20 is so cute :(

---
Spirit 
---
The last being the most fun, others not so much.
---
Your flair says otherwise
---
Legion has Mad Grit, its hands-down the best perk for dealing with body-blockers. Takes up a slot but that feeling you get when you've had that survivor on your shoulders for damn near a minute and all his altruistic buddy's are slugged now is incredible.
---
Imagine if that was a thing, but the deeper you were into the mori the more injured the survivor would be when the killer got stunned
---
Would be mad
---
What happened to DS?
---
Survivor run speed, and the ability to vault and throw pallets is based on killer connection.
---
Uninstall
---
Tis but a scratch!
---
 Nah I just felt bad
---
Why I don’t play dbd anymore lol
---
Self care and urban evasion Claudette.

Doesnt matter what my flair says lol i just picked randomly something

---
Usually: WGLF, Lithe, Dance With Me, Borrowed Time
---
Karma. Serves you right.
---
Oh, okay :D
---
Ayeee I was upvote number 1,000!  Great work OP!
---
or a meme build,,?
---
Well being that they can’t balance swf because it would nerf the non swf players to much? Adding this communication would be grounds for them to start working harder to balance the game where communication doesn’t affect the outcome, it just becomes standard
---
It only works after you got unhooked for 40/50/60 seconds 
---
And after that it's gone and u cant use it anymore
---
Naw just facecamping really.
---
Either that or what I said.
---
Yea trolls would abuse it but hey got take the good and the bad lol
---
i really dont understand how running no mither in a swf makes them think they’re gods at the game
---
Its still valuable perk tho
---
Well it's quite irrelevant whether or not you had fun. You can have fun all you want but there is no point in communication if you don't care what the other person thinks or feels. There is nothing wrong with having fun but if it was clearly one-sided there is no reason to rub it into other people's faces. 
---
GG is not about saying "I had fun because I won" it's saying "WE had fun because the game was enjoyable"
---
false
---
I was gonna say those are the ones that instead ave. But no, only neas instasave
---
Because the game is in a far better place for killer than its ever been since its inception.
---
I know I said I play survivor a lot but I’m actually a killer main and I don’t actually think swf is really all that strong. I mean they have the advantage of communication but at the end of the day it still comes down to skill
---
No mither has potential. But using it makes you a big target
---
Thanks bro, its actually hard to find good clips now, if u enjoy it pls leave a like and sub for giving me more motivations;)
---
Yes, I agree. But SWF is still broken and heavily favors the survivor side.  
---
Do you disagree?
---
0 effort, coppy paste of the last post wiht a shity image, sad.
---
Yeah but it got nerfed a lot, but my main focus with this post was that they totally destroyed mettle of men
---
Enjoy that people are salty shit and murder them more.
---
Relish in the salt.
---
Delight in their suffering
---
Make them pay for not improving.
---
Dedicated servers aren’t here!? I thought they were
---
This happened to me exactly like that. All gens done with no sight of the killer and I assumed he was afk, I went for the chest and had a heart attack when I went around that corner.
---
Luckily he was just messing around and didn't hook me or anyone that came to save me, but I've never jumped so much.
---
Controversial opinion: camping (outside of facecamping) doesn't exist.
---
Tunneling doesn't exist unless combined with the above.
---
Letting people bleed out? I always let the second last person bleed out while i hunt the last one down to deny the hatch. I'll leave the last one in a handful of instances where it makes sense (like i know they have DS and we're close enough to the gate/the timer is low enough that it's better to leave them).
---
Toxic is basically just a buzzword for "gameplay i don't like" these days tbh.
---
It only heavily favors them if all four survivors are extremely good at the game. It’s not that strong.
---
Looks great!
---
I gotta put at least one perk for my bois
---
Nah that’s a 2000IQ play
---
Get rekt survy scrub.
---
Reality is often disappointing...
---
*jumps over the pallet and body slams, damaging the survivor and destroying the dropped pallet*
---
EVIL REPTILIAN TIME!
---
slugging for the 4k is annoying, i never do it unless the other survivor is literally right there. are you *that* desperate to get 4 kills? :/
---
3 examples of games I've played recently.
---
1. This dude who logs in every day just to be toxic. His steam profile description is "going for 10 pages of comments by Christmas". I've played this dude like 3 times now in the last week and every time he just downs someone and face camps.
---
2. A Ghost Face who after someone almost instantly DC's (i think they crashed but who knows) decides to proxy camp and hard tunnel all game.
---
3. A Billy who found a Jake right away that was probably at too high of a rank. Got caught hiding behind a tree and gets hooked. Billy starts chasing another guy so I unhook him. He gives up on the chase and comes right back to the hook to down this poor Jake again. Then he chases me and I try to lead him as far away as possible, but as soon as he gets unhooked again, the Billy goes back to the hook and finishes him. This is with 5 gens and Ruin still up.
---
Now only that first example is really toxic while the other two can be described as "playing to win", but all 3 were shitty experiences that instantly had me moving back to killer.
---
This is why instead of a 2v8 mode that seems to be really popular here, I would rather they create a casual mode where things like tunneling and camping are harshly punished. Let people keep playing however they feel in ranked, but give us a game mode that's purely meant to have enjoyable games whether you win or lose.
---
That is some buuuuuullshit. Happens to me all the time. Oh you were running somewhere? Here, lag will take you back to where you were 3 seconds ago
---
No. Don't disconnect.
---
Maybe there is some secret algorithm 🤔
---
Just saw that, thanks! I bought GF with cells, so i missed out on it. It just looks like a less stealthy version of same clothes, no real reason to ever use it...
---
Good points. Personally I'd like them to look at the exhaustion perks and (while still having the cooldown) add a token system where completing gens or popping totems gives you a token that reduces the exhaustion duration. Could also include unhooking and stuff. Would incentivise people to help with the objective early to better their chance to escape in late-game.
---
She's been smoking a lot lately. Marlboro Red to be accurate.
---
Go get some sunlight today.
---
Jumpscares: Scratched mirror myers and Prayer beads spirit
---
Camping and tunneling exist. Just because you want to say they're fair ways to play the game doesn't mean that they don't exist. 
---
They're just words to describe how you're playing.
---
Right..
---
Resilience, Adrenaline, Spine Chill, Decisive Strike.
---
Give me a reason not - the hatch mechanic *gives me incentive to do so* because it guarantees two hooks and two sacrifices, instead of one.
---
Okay now do shirtless hag
---
you can find the hatch and close it. before it was just a free hatch for the survivor. now if you find it first you can get the 4k easily. you dont have to slug for the 4k, you just gotta be quick.
---
I get howyou feel, man, but is it too much asking you too ignore the teabags? They want to make you mad with that and you're letting them. Maybe it helps to remember that it's just a game.
---
 This is the main reason I stopped with dead by daylight not face camping but toxic survivors
---
Thank you mod very cool
---
Right now, I’ve been having most fun getting kills with ghostface, but many of the games I’ll have a person disconnect and some people suicide.
---
I can bypassing having to "find it first" if i just down them both.
---
I just recently started playing again and wanted to play with a friend last night that just started playing. Last night when we were trying to invite eachother we would get an error that said “unable to reach host”. It’s also happening today which is quite annoying, anyone have an idea on how to fix the issue?
---
Ah I always get them mixed up
---
Yeah, lots of people find him pretty annoying.
---
Doctor is not viable for red ranks(not like rank matters some times) basically every killer but Nurse,Hillbilly and spirit are good at red ranks
---
While the chase is ongoing. As long as the obsession has chase music (it's important to make this distinction, because chases are uhhh.. a bit buggy is a nice way of putting it) the claws will move.
---
Addons have been updated.

Then what? Her bloodweb only has offerings, making every game a Mori match, or she picks the level? 
---
What she needs it to have a max of 3 blinks, a slightly longer fatigue, and slower charge speed.
---
Of course she DCs
---
fair enough, i just dont like playing that way because its a bit scummy. at least give em a chance, you know?
---
How does this happen?? I've seen it happening for my teammates before but not me! Is there a specific action to trigger it?
---
Ahh the nostalgia from 1.3 Blood Lodge map
---
No problem. Everyone is 300 each right now until the second. Ghostface is still 500 auric cells though.
---
Total aids: trapper and hag.
---
Finding the hatch is 100x easier as killer because you don’t have to creep around to find it and the survivor does. Especially with the way the endgame is structured now, and if you’ve played enough of the game at all, you know relative hatch spawn locations.
---
Why would i do that? I get more points if i don't and they're going to hate on me anyway so.. *shrug*
---
The spirit 😂😂😂😂
---
Myers on any map is scary, so imagine being on a dark map and saying “ok he can’t see me” and then he looks directly in your direction and swipes you
---
This is such an annoying bug. it’s pretty easy to fix too.
---
Haha, I'm the same, tbh. If urban evasion or lithe with quick and quiet fail me... Well, I just get hooked.
---
bad killers are always very desperate to get as many kills as they can by using the easiest, most bullshit means to get them
---
What are the new bugs besides the exit gate infinite?
---
you’re playing for your fun only by that and im not gonna argue abt it, im just throwing that out there. i just think letting others have fun and have a chance is nicer
---
Yeah, that would be very stressful. Imagine the game map with two doctors or the memorial institute with two stealth killers
---
he can be, but it makes him so good lol plus he can pretty much immediately start a snowball, and he forces people to play more slowly and cautiously than other killers because they don’t want to get marked (so many times I’ve marked a survivor sitting right near them because they were looking the other way- thanks head turn mechanic!)
---
I do like how they made Wraith's brown addons unique things, not just super shit tier versions of yellow and green addons like the other killers.
---
Meh, she doesn't have the Mettle of Man.
---
it ended up introducing too many bugs and things were never working right with hit boxes.
---
LOL For Honor is such a complete shit show of half hearted “balancing”. Poor example.
---
Yeah its pretty lame idk why they make the chapter cosmetics so bad. Adam and Jane you can hardly tell the difference
---
There's no reward in playing as Survivor, every single mechanic in the game is designed to help bad Killers. Ain't no fun in running from pallet to pallet in every chase because of auto aim lunges.
---
Yes, all killers want survivors to waste time and not rush the gens. Including the ones who don't run NOED. If you have reason to believe the killer has NOED, then cleansing Totems WOULD NOT BE a waste of time, since spending that small amount of time and effort to get rid of them negates the "Overpowered pls remove" perk, and it will never even activate, which is more than worth the minute amount of time and effort spent. Saying "It's not a counter because it's a minor inconvenience for me and takes a small amount of time" isn't a valid argument, and just makes you sound like an entitled, salty, whiney little bitch who can't play around one the most basic and counterable perks in the entire game.
---
I really dislike the idea of a 2v8 gamemode. It'll just be 1v4 but instead of being a playable game it would be a huge clusterfuck, especially on small maps. It would split the playerbase and queue times (which everyone under the sun is complaining about) would become much longer than they already are. 
---
Just change the way the game is being played right now. Add an extra objective or two. Instead of repairing 5 generators, repair two and find keys for the gates or something. Literally anything is better than a 2v8 mode.
---
I believe that's Kate, so makes sense.
---
For context I started as an immersive player with Nea so I know how hard this will be but it might be a good idea to drop urban evasion. Takes up a perk slot as a massive crutch while only providing you with the chance to perform some good shenanigans that you probably won’t be doing as an immersive player.
---
As an example of some shenanigans you can crouch around a generator while the killer confusedly wanders around looking for who keeps tapping their gen.
---
Yea I know bro but it’s already annoying when survivors escape because it’s hurts my rank and blood points gained, but then to basically brag about it 1 foot away from the exit lmaooo I just say to myself “ok, yea I got something for that” now I get hate mail every game and I’m perfectly fine with that.
---
I think it was an important stepping stone nonetheless, I think the game wouldn't be as stable as it currently is if it weren't for operation health
---
not at all, none of the player base minded that it was just when they introduced the update it created a lot of bugs to where people could exploit things with deployable shields and the hit boxes were just not working correctly. thats what was wrong with it, it became a HUGE meme for the player base.
---
I play Fred, D A R N
---
You actually need more circles in the first image, just that they represent pallets dropped by your team mates
---
Thanks for the explanation.
---
I did not know this change.
---
And I think it is garbage. (as a killer main I dislike)
---
i mean yeah because it showed bugs and exploits no one knew about until operation health, but im not sure how that would all work out for Dead by Daylight.
---
that's not what you meant.
---
I love how that's literally what I'm using atm until I get spine chill again.
---
okay
---
Cleaning up code can really help out in the long run
---
Then they should play another character with more than one perk slot while they lvl their freshly prestieged character, imo.
---
Hello World! Is what any programmer learns in like a 101 introductory class usually. It's what I learned to code on my 2nd day of class.
---
They are all ok as long as you don't face a swf.
---
That said, Freddy, Wraith, Doc, GhostFace and Leatherface will struggle more than the others.
---
Nurse and pirit are overkilling if used with addons.
---
it can, i would really like to see what could happen if Behavior ended up doing it.
---
This is far from low effort! People who don’t cosplay just don’t understand that “low effort” can still mean a lot of effort to make your cosplay look good. You look amazing!
---
It’s a fun game no doubt. You just gotta find a way to flip the tables. I didn’t even know face camping was a thing at first I literally started doing it by myself until I got multiple hate messages telling me I suck because I face camp and tunnel them, and I tunnel people when they ignore the sht outta me
---
Also, how hard is it to see out of that thing?
---
I'm surprised no one has said Doc yet, especially since the endgame change with hatch spawns. He's easily the best killer at finding the urban immersive P3 Claudette.
---
I’d have to agree that the Huntress is the most aesthetically pleasing to me. Wraiths candle head aesthetic is dope too.
---
Annoy*
---
Are you camping every game and every survivor or just the toxic ones?
---
About that rank issue: If you got the rank achievements already, just ignore your rank. I can say from experience that higher ranks get less fun and only unnecessarily more annoying to play. And adding to that is that shitty emblem system which can easily deny a pip which can then frustrate further.
---
I know but if you face camp the rest escapes and tbags at the exit gates
---
The only rank that means anything is red ranks... they better seriously change how ranking works and not just add rewards with the rank update in a few months

---
Hi 
---
If survivor manage to get the objective done, they have usually the same amount of points.
---
You want more points for doing less? Cheeky
---
gg bb pig git gud
---
His is the worst face. Dwight and meg are the best ones.
---
you can use it on the basement stairs and you can get it off the tree in the middle in shelter woods.
---
Those are tricky to find.
---
Okay so, what’s the tactic with object of obsession?
---
‘Cause it triggers even if the killer is right out of your FoV, meaning the killer sees you and you don’t see him unless you flick your mouse around.
---
I pretty much get my ass tunneled if I run OoO.  Either because I keep looking at the killer, or I keep looking away from the killer and don’t know where the hell he is. When he’s right there.
---
You had an opportunity here to say that head is "lit", but missed it.
---
Too bad....
---
Or thrill
---
I think balanced landing offers a lot more loop capability in most maps and is a bit harder for most killers to counter. Dead hard can easily be countered by the killer (they’ll just get right on top of you and pressure you into use it while not even swinging- happens at all ranks)
---
Huntress is certainly my favorite aesthetic-wise though fancy party Wraith and kimono Spirit are also up there for me. 
---
Also, maybe an unpopular opinion, but I love the idea and look of Clown. Sure, he’s not a handsome boy, but I think they did a great job on making his model and he often looks genuinely intimidating stomping around the map.
---
they should only survive if it was before the fatal act of the mori.
---
Trapper’s 2-3rd swing
---
Pig’s neck slash
---
Halfway through doctor shock
---
etc
---
I had this happen to me a few months ago. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mP3kqBwFib8) a video of this happening.
---
I want my good queue time back.
---
I agree with giving survivors more BP, but WGLF stacks for completing generators which they should be doing anyway? Not so sure about that one
---
My country (Belgium) is usually not that hot, so we have no AC in my house... with the current heatwave, it's a permanent 30C/86F in my room. I have to sleep downstairs in the sofa because it's a few degrees cooler since heat rises.
---
This happened to me directly after a match where a survivor was helping the killer and i had dropped my best toolbox and offering on it. 
---
Guess im not playing this game today
---
and if they save multiple people by abusing the exploit along the way...? Even if the other exits do not work, and they get screwed over, which they can show video proof of to behavior via twitter, they dont have to ruin the experience for the killer in the process.
---
Auto-aim fucks up the killer more than survivors, so idk what you mean by that. If you mean janky hitboxes then sure, whatever. 
---
Claiming every mechanic is used to help bad killers is a huge stretch, considering survivors have many *many* strong tiles, perks, and loops to use. You just have to know how to use them.
---
&gt; Adjusted all stalk rate add-ons (Philly, Telephoto Lens, Knife Belt Clip and Night Vision Monocular) so that they only affect stalking while not leaning. Stalking while leaning is twice faster than normal stalking.
---
???
---
Every game I ever play as Killer, summed up in one short clip.
---
I really love ghostfaces raining blood skin. It looks like a trash bag he painted, so it’s great. 
---
I also think standard Joey Legion has a kickass outfit, some true style. You can’t kill if you ain’t cute. It also looks comfortable. 
---
I do think Plague and Spirit have interesting designs, since I’d argue that they’re the most upsetting visually/conceptually (spirit being cut up and disfigured- and her kimono cosmetic is really cool- Plague being infected and disgusting but combined with objects that display wealth and status is pretty cool)
---
No matter how many times it happens, it always put a smile on my face.
---
**JUST LEAVE.**
---
Unrelated, but evertime I face the Jane with the skirt, I have to watch porn after the trial.
---
Why are you people booing me? Im right.  
---
Hannibal Buress memes aside, the insane karma bombing is worth getting to at least say shit on reddit. If you need to downvote someone you disagree with, whatever ig :/
---
It’s been confirmed by the devs that his lunge is slightly longer
---
Yeah it gets to 30 C indoors here as well, no AC and the houses are built to keep heat in so... yay?
---
I was kinda joking
---
&gt;because theres never ac anywhere
---
This is so true
---
Christ, can that keyboard get any louder?
---
*Queue Confused Gif*
---
I just had a trapper game where they left that Gen, the Gen right beside the shack and the one in the little boat alive so they were all three within 75 feet of each other. Add some traps, badaboom.
---
I want an SCP killer, maybe 106, no terror radius but walks slow when near survivors and relies on catching them off guard
---
I wish I could play with all these top tier high rank survivors that know every loop that killers always say they face.
---
It's not fun dying on first hook because nobody saves you, or having to repair a minimum of 5 gens by yourself. Hell I'll even settle for teammates that last longer than 10 seconds in a chase and don't somehow manage to throw down like 3 pallets in that timeframe.
---
When they do that I run after them, wave at them to follow me, then go back to the gen. They usually get the idea.
---
Exactly. I play killer as well and never run noed but there’s clear justification for those who do
---
Behavior should partner with a chip company to make something like that
---
Camping and  tunneling and slugging isn’t toxic, neither is pallet looping, flashlighting at pallets, playing the game will never be toxic.
---
BM’ing constantly like teabagging or smacking them on the hook and then sending hate mail after the match is toxic.
---
I don’t use words like that
---
You had an opportunity for your fun reply but chose to type that lol
---
His P3 is nice, one of my top faves in the game
---
A teabag and a body block? Deserved.
---
why do people do that? like you are gonna depip by dcing, at least you get SOME bp if you wait five fucking seconds
---
Freddy would fight super dirty, but ghostface might have some potential. I’d argue he’s the most experienced and intelligent killer (intelligent killing-wise, since he has a long track record and he’s very meticulous how he sets up his kills and how he prepares by getting as much information as possible regarding his victims-also unlike most killers, he’s not given a sob story that would offer some point of weakness). Id maybe say Clown also has experience like him, but clown also has different motives and a weak spot. Several of the killers lore-wise didn’t even really kill anyone or killed 1 person.
---
Oh ho!  Then stare as much as you like.
---
The worst is when there is no ruin but SOMEHOW you do 2 gens solo, while your teammates are busy getting downed by the killer, then they leave you to die on your first hook. That happens way more than you would expect in green ranks from my experience.
---
Derpface?
---
Oink
---
Let's be honest its usually number 2
---
The Shapes lunging speed isn't increased or decreased in Tier 3.
---
Meh, I figured with the use of *"dope"* that that was up your alley. 
---
**FAIL**
---
absolute crybaby lol if flashlights are really that bad for you, there’s a perk to counter them. Jesus Christ but regardless if you’re just going to disconnect because someone plays against you instead of for you why the hell are you even playing this game
---
Personally having a great time with the game lately it’s became my daily driver game. There’s always gonna be bugs. The only minor inconveniences I have currently are sometimes when getting hooked my survivor screams loud enough to wake up the state of Mississippi (mostly meg) and the long queue time when trying to play killer. I play ghost face quite a lot and think he’s fine but that’s IMO. Thanks for making such a fun game!
---
Literally no similarities with the original character.  Simply a sad attempt at waifu Mike.
---
And from my experience as killer, it's always a Claudette or Meg throwing them down way in advance.
---
I'm rank 2 right now. I've had several matches vs 4 man SWF from rank 4 to 2 and I've noticed a bit of a trend. They weren't able to bully me and got absolutely slaughter. I hooked everyone several times and when they know they have no chance to escape, one of them will disconnect. I'm guessing they have a designated guy to disconnect because the one quitting is the only one who isn't in red ranks. I've blocked messages from anyone who isn't a friend, but I'm pretty sure they go around messaging people to blame it on lag or something, but I'm 100% sure my connection is good. My ping is low and I won't start a match if any survivor has bad ping. It's happened at least 4 or 5 times the last couple of days. 
---
But to answer your question, yea, they tend to be more dickheads in red ranks. Teabagging at the exit, teabagging after pallet stuns, every single one has Adrenaline, dead hard and decisive strike, all of them have InstaHeals. Pretty annoying, but eventually, you'll get good enough to predict what they do. For example, I won't follow survivors to certain big buildings with long loops. They have communication with each other, it's an easy "I'm looping this big ass building, should keep him busy for a minute, the 3 of you pop a gen."
---
Had the game for a year, been playing semi-consistently for about the last 2 months....
---
Survivor Main: P3 Claudette, Rank 10
---
Killer Main: Doctor / Spirit, Rank 11
---
Player Rank 96, Devotion 0
---
When I was playing Killer there were 2 gens left and 3 survivors alive and the hatch spawned can someone explain??
---
ive been playing for a year and im devotion 2 what
---
It is pretty good ive only got him P2 tho im workin on it
---
Had this Nea thinking they were Noob3 trying to loop the killer shack while I was Trapper. Basement was there. So I put a trap on the closed off wall of the shack because I knew they’d try to take the long way since trappers usually block the window. She walked into it, I grab her off and carry her down the basement stairs, instant DC.
---
On a side note Trapper is really fun. Something something iamverysmart.
---
-facepalm-
---
Amanda and Doctor would be the most toxic combo.
---
Good luck getting that trap off when you have an impossible skill check Doctor constantly putting you in tier 3.
---
I main Amanda and my bestie mains Doctor so we've already decide to do this combo.
---
Yeah same. Something ain’t adding up chief
---
"No argument to be had"
---
Balanced Landing is entirely RNG based. Has a chance to not be activatable, or have one activation spot.
---
Join the club. I own every killer so when I meet a killer who plays like a complete tool in whatever one I’ll go to the killer queue and queue up as them, same outfit if I have it. Then I’ll play the cleanest game I have and give the survivors a GG after no matter the result.
---
I play Trapper... coulda sworn I left something there
---
OoO is best used in a SWF team. The person that is the strongest looper runs this perk most likely with dead hard, decisive strike and adrenaline. Now the whole team always knows where the killer is which is a big advantage. But again, you have to be a strong looper, otherwise your team is left with 3 people within the first minutes.
---
Idk man it's the internet lol, It's really easy to misinterpret sarcasm even if it seems obviously like sarcasm to the readers.
---
Enduring + Spirit Fury is good on any killer that has to use M1 attacks to down someone.
---
The thing that can stun you even if you're the nurse because it doesn't matter if you lose all collision and literally stop existing fuck you it's a pallet and there's 30 on every map
---
thanks :)
---
You are a man of culture too.
---
They seem to have brought back the chase music for specific killers. I don’t know exactly how it works but when I’m on more stealth killers I typically get louder music, which is kinda annoying honestly but it is what it is. Music on survivors feels literally nonexistent.
---
Maybe Nichelle Nichols'? To keep the Star Trek theme going on.
---
They’re racing stripes so he can go faster
---
Vanity mirror Dead rabbit Monitor and Abuse Play With Your Food and whatever other perks you wanna use could be even more effective than scratched mirror. Though you lose the immunity to detection perks that tier 1 Myers has.
---
NOED? Truly you out skilled her.
---
Both are good combos on her but I personally prefer NC/Sloppy as well. I like the added benefit of survivors feeling pressured to not heal or make a break for a corner in hopes of not being spotted. 
---
Enduring/SF is great on other M1 killers with no help in a chase and can help a phase-hesitant Spirit but Spirit’s power can negate some loops with practice. Enduring/SF can be fun on Rin with passive phasing add-ons from time to time though.
---
No not really. You should be using her Phase to cut down on loops. She’s a slow movement Killer that can’t easily catch up around loops to utilise it, she’s also the same speed as Hag and i’ve yet to see a Hag with SF &amp; Enduring.
---
Cosmetic for Dwight? This is Dwight!
---
Naw I kill every survivor because they always try to come save their teammates on ps4 it’s always 3 killed or all
---
So it's practically useless, like I said.
---
I downed an entire team in literally two minutes because they decided they were gonna all try to body block me. Hilarity ensued when they all were crawling around. Then I realized I had BBQ and hooked everyone.
---
Whats wrong with you?
---
They never use to be that bad look at Min's Bun, Cardigan and tracksuit pants combo which were her chapter exclusives.
---
Or Ace's slicked back hair, tuxedo and black pants combo 
---
You used to get a whole different outfit. Thing like  Adam's Casual Jean outfit
---
Kate's ponytail, shirt and jeans outfit 
---
Would have all been the chapter exclusives before the store hit
---
I have 16.6 days on my DbD currently and I play both survivor and killer       
---
Currently I'm level 76 with devotion 1      
---
For survivor I main Jane (currently P2 level 27) with Dwight, Claudette, Jake, Nea, Bill (P1), Ash, Jeff, Adam, and Laurie are all level 50 and currently leveling up David with him being 11 currently     
---
For killer I main both Doctor and Freddy with both of them being level 50 with Ghostface being level 15, Pig being level 29, Myers being level 32 and Trapper being level 16
---
I’ll take  “Killer main who makes excuses for other killers playing like bitches” for $200.
---
Lunges was added cause bad killers couldn't land regular hits then they added auto aim cause 360ing countered lunges. Survivors only have 1 good perk outside of teachables. There's like 2 good pallets but the rest have a quick route around them and killers usually hit through pallets.
---
it can still get more use than dead hard can get in many situations.
---
Not a new game mode some new objectives
---
The bug fixes itself if/when you get stunned by a pallet while frenzied
---
I will throw my iridescent button at it
---
Wait, DID THEY ANNOUNCE 2v8?!?!?!
---
Be my dad
---
It's literally the subreddit you're in right now
---
So pressing CNTRL is toxic, but denying someone’s ability to play the game isn’t? Ok,
---
Killer: 15 (Main: Wraith or Doctor)
---
Survivor: 19 (Undecided main)
---
You are not alone, there are other survivors that feel the same way as you. You will know who they are by their screams as they get placed upon a hook ♥️
---
Never thought about that but yeah youre right same with Laurie and Tapp they got way nicer alt cosmetics its a shame that they decided to entice players to hit the store especially when thise cosmetics are often way better and should have been the base outfits tbh
---
I really love this version of ghost face because he’s got an interesting backstory that is quite different from the other killers. he doesn’t have a sad aspect that calls the audience to have sympathy or pity for him, and it’s rare to see this in the genre of horror/slasher, so it’s so refreshing and fun.
---
I’m so confused
---
Eventually getting caught is too much work. Use this build and you don't get caught, and if you do, you run away fast as fuck. Simple and effective.
---
Yeah, I’m sorry boys it’s gonna be a hard No from me.
---
tbh slendy has more emp/sickness powers if anything he prob be a docter/clown hybrid just modifed a bit
---
Jakes are very frequent in brown and yellow ranks. 
---
Source: most of my friends are brown ranks
---
And can I have some?
---
In the new Scream Reboot coming in 20XX, Ghostface is played by Ace Visconti. Fans have dubbed this variation, "GhaceFace"
---
don’t listen to anyone who suggests Laurie for her perks, her perks aren’t very good. DS after nerf is hugely situational, and you’ll probably be wasting a perk slot on it.
---
Jake main reporting in. I'll usually let LF kill me at the end of the match if he doesn't manage during. I know theres not TOO many of us.
---
Lol, you think being camped on the hook is denying your ability to play the game? You’re doing your team a favor if everyone else does gens.
---
Yea I sorta do the same thing, I never camp or intentionally tunnel.  If toxic survivors escape and say ez, i just highlight the fact that I never camped or tunneled them.
---
This pleases me
---
Iv never been out played with my undefeated spirit build 68-0 only 4 peps survived being the last man hatch-standing, well 3, 1 was a mercy hatch cause I liked his name, ne way, pretty much every other killer i play Iv been loop owned here and there but 4 some reason with spirit I just get into her zone and it’s over, I always smile and enjoy finding the survivors that are 100 sure there going to loop me and start power hopping lol. Trick em into double vaulting and “GOTCHA BITCH” &lt; sorry but every time that meme pops into my head., got 2 perfect games with her now 8 k all 4 categories. It gets strategic lol, I actually have  to hold back to get them, make sure I hook them all 3 times, destroy generators, interrupt healing. Its often that I down down a survivor for the 3rd time kinda quick so I just let her lay there and get healed, Downed1  guy like 8-9 times 1 night. He got all pissed off even though I let him get healed like 6 times, I didn’t tunnel either he just couldn’t run/play at all, I recommended he switch DBD out for Minecraft lol. If I just rage it’s over before they get 2-3 generators, get pitiful bps. Oddly though I’ve gotten a surprising amount of canned messages from survivors when I play like that. Thought it was strange getting them from the survivors I killed, wow reply was about 80% larger then intended lol. I tend to do this when og kush is involved lol
---
You still got more points than them. Sure, the matchmaking is trashy, but technically, you won.
---
i was running passive phasing addons
---
\&gt; Every Claudette I don't see:
---
FTFY
---
I can’t wait til this “no one” thing dies, it never adds anything.
---
Who said they outskilled her
---
You’re so right. Legion had great potential to be fun, but they took it away.
---
The game is massively survivor sided at top level play, get gud.
---
Ghostface he was called derpface in the scary movie series
---
YES. I have to fucking sit there and watch your ass “kick/patrol gens”  or “break pallets” while I’m 5 feet away on the first phase. Then you walk just so your terror radius is gone so my team can save, then here the fuck you come back, won’t hit my teammate who’s running directly behind me looking for a protection hit, and proceed to hit me.
---
I still want it
---
Even in his Mori animations the survivors can still bully The Legion
---
I'm purple, it's a ghost town
---
It def has been lol

This is what bond is for. Bond is already used less than it should be because of swf, adding a feature that allows you to openly communicate with survivors would further nerf it, as well as similar aura reading perks such as empathy, aftercare, map addons, etc.
---
Oink definitely her perks are good to have especially make your choice and surveillance, make your choice can be made into a instadown build and then you also can use surveillance to help protect gens
---
Been waiting a few days for this. 
---
Played survivor, after a few gens into the game it seemed as if I got paired with 3 SWFs. After some great team work, and distracting loops, we opened up the gates. The three possible-SWFs were at the gate and I got hooked, first time in the match. 
---
I see them all at the gate, first thought: "it was a great round, I'm ok with this."
---
Suddenly, I see their auras leaving the exit gates and coming my way... what? This never happens. 
---
Two of them get slugged, the other hero makes it my way and unhooks me. Both of us are dodging this Nurse' blinks and slugs. I'm finally able to get the Nurse off of my unhooked so they can go, ends up in me getting slugged. The Nurse leaves me to get him. Boom. Slugged. 
---
I'm crawling away, found the hatch. End Game's about to run out. Suddenly the hatch opens. A DC symbol appears on the survivor so I could escape. 
---
Yes. I know. I hate when people DC as well, survivor or killer. But this guy sacrificed his BPs so I could get the hatch.. made me smile. GGs all around to survivors and killer.
---
This game should not be taken too seriously, it will never be balanced, it's only for fun. If the game was to be balanced it would have to be both killer and survivors in a max scenario, so survivors running the best of the best and same with killer, including eboni moris. This would destroy the games fun for beginners or even intermediate players. If you want perfectly balanced and competitive gameplay, I suggest going elsewhere :p
---
Wait do you get the survivor's face as a cosmetic for Bubba if you kill them? Or did I get it wrong?
---
So nice of you to take the picture for his special day at the fair!
---
Yeah, let's take overpowered add-ons out. No more Skeleton keys, no more InstaHeals and let's take away rainbow maps while we're at it. Search for those totems on your own. Should balance everything out in a snap.
---
I’m happy I finally pulled the trigger on buying DbD because of the steam summer sale. PvP games are not usually my thing, so I thought I wouldn’t like it. I’m a huge fan of horror, and slashers in particular, though. I had so much fun playing it. I can’t believe it took me this long to give it a try.
---
Yeah, agitation isn’t a very strong perk, since you can pretty much make it to a hook regardless of where you are on a map. BBQ might be good, since it shows auras and gives you extra blood points, and sloppy butcher can be good since they’ll need more time to heal. I’d also recommend nurses (I ran it on legion when I played him) because people will try to always heal back to full health to force you to use your ability. It also pairs well with M&amp;A since your terror radius will increase during a chase, giving you more area to see with nurses.
---
Killers have longer queue times lol. Survivor get enough blood points
---
yeah you get it after killing the original  survivors 25 times
---
Noob here, what is devotion?
---
Camping is lame imo but everything else is fair game to me.  Your job is to kill, their job is to survive. Do everything you can to win because they are doing the same.
---
That’s an annoying strategy but it isn’t “toxic”, such an overused term now for anything a player does that you don’t like.
---
I find that shit irritating as hell but I’m not going to send hate mail and cry about how toxic it is.
---
I had a killer game where one of the players called me a camper in the post-game chat afterwards. The only reason why I hung around the hook was because this was an obnoxious swf where all 3 blatantly swarmed the hook together. What am I supposed to do? Just leave and let them have a free unhook? They made their presence widely known and didn't bother to hide. Thankfully, not all 4 felt that way and one of them gave me a gg. It's nice to see that even within a swf, not all of them are cut from the same cloth.

Soon, my friend. Soon.
---
Why do you keep coming back? Who cares at this point? It was a joke that he didn’t get. WOW OMG THATS SO IMPORTANT! It’s really not...
---
Same, I try to play the way I would like killers to play against me, and I never lose solely because of it. I will say that I have never had any post game salt, even with the 4Ks, because people appreciate it.
---
Just you honestly. The fact I'm giving up another add on slot to counter act a negative effect on an add on I got is better than having two add ons that greatly improve the killer with no negative effects. Now they're are some add ons with no penalty granted but usually is balanced depending on who it is.
---
Only times DCing is justifiable is if the person DCing has to go somewhere/ something came up or your internet shits on you. Besides that, there is no excuse to DC
---
Thanks to this sub I'm scared of using pallets so on my 1st down  I don't even touch em and use windows only. At rank 1 too.
---
Can you please explain what pip/black pip is? I've tried looking it up but the explanations were confusing to me. I believe it's something to do with rank and emblem scores.
---
Reminds me of a killer who every time he started to get looped got really shitty internet and ended the chase in 2 secs
---
Well u I’m not a good facecamper but if you have fun thats what matters for you but I have more fun playing other games and not getting people spam me when I facecamp or kill everyone
---
Even if your internet decides to go poop on you?
---
Leatherface for BBQ Chili. Pig for fun and oinks. Ghost Face or Michael if you want to try jump scares, Freddy if you want a challenge.
---
I guess yours glitched. The hatch is supposd to spawn when there is one more generator completed than there are survivors remaining. Ie: 2 gens done 1 surv. Left. 3 gens done 2 survs. Left etc. Or niw with the endgame collapse it will spawn with the last survivor no matter what if it hasn't already spawned.
---
spirit, shes one of the strongest killers at the moment.
---
What can I say, I'm stubborn as shit
---
This Wednesday, we'll get Feng and Wraith's cosmetics.
---
Next Wednesday, will be the leather outfit for pig and undercover Tapp.
---
The Wednesday after that, we'll have test subject (saw 3) pig and police officer Tapp.
---
You sure about that?
---
Yep, that's what I keep hearing.
---
Yea and the hatch also, survivors cam get a free win without needing a perk or add-on? That doesn't seem balanced
---
Not my Main but I use this when I get bored of the usual
---
Quick and Quiet / Dance With Me / Lithe / Head On
---
Practice. Lots and lots of practice
---
Devotion 6 here. Not getting bored yet. I think it is just as fun as it always has been to me. The cat n mouse Tom n Jerry like feel is top notch.
---
After player level 99 you reach a Devotion level. So basically every 100 player levels.
---
Having different opinions isn't allowed on this sub
---
Pretty sure was OP's first great skill check.
---
On top of that of course he's got that lag. Can't tell if it was bad connection or lag switching but this was awful
---
Benny is such a chad.
---
How could you possibly reject him?
---
You realise queues for both sides are already bad at high ranks (5 and below). If they added one more gamemode the queues would take forever for both the regular game + the “new gamemode” because you split a small community by giving them a choice. This is how you ruin a game with a small community. They’re going to be changing the regular game by adding more objectives you just have to be patient because it’s a small community but you don’t understand. We will need over 100k players for it to be splittable not 25k.
---
have you tried identity v? it came before horrorfield
---
This happens way too often
---
Errrr, wanna keep reading buddy?
---
The Killer can close it you know?
---
Le!
---
You can't compare the hag to the spirit for perks because the hag isn't really supposed to chase at all, she's more like a nurse with predetermined teleport points. The spirit still has to chase a little bit and use her power strategically
---
I'd be fine with that
---
That is movie is pretty good, I like how it seems like a typical horror movie but ends up being a lot different than what you would expect. I was like wtf when I saw all of those creatures locked up and that it was just a twisted show
---
1: I don't want a slideshow survivor in my game. That's why I killed him first.
---
2: Everytime someone dodge the lobby eventually somebody with better ping is found. Why would it be different? Didn't say it's devs fault, only said that waiting a long time to have this kind of player on the lobby is bs. This guy fucks everybody's game. Specially other survivor's.
---
3: Who would involve? The entity? Please...
---
Nothing weird about it. I’ve played literally everyday since I got the game and mostly play Survivor which seems to gives more XP. No reason for me to lie. My first achievement was January 19th which was when I got the game. It was free on Steam to try at the time. I average 50 hours per week of playing and summer gives me even more time to play.
---
Yeah just let your teamate go down again and let him die, instead of helping them, sure thing,

I tried editing the phot but it wouldn't work so I put the text part of the meme in the title
---
Rank 13 is the new rank 20
---
Its in the roadmap but so far nope.
---
“learn fair play” 😂😂
---
I'm talking about getting shorter killer queues. I'm a killer that wants shorter queues.
---
Same boat.
---
Also before anyone says that I'm calling the perks featured here garbage, this isn't meant to represent how they suck or anything, but just not in the current meta.
---
^^^^look ^^^^at ^^^^the ^^^^left ^^^^side ^^^^of ^^^^the ^^^^image.
---
3 blinks should never exsist. A nurse with three blinks is even more dumb than 2
---
As a meg main I resent that.  I can never find pallets, thank you very much.  ~~of course I play stealth and am usually the last one found but thats not important~~
---
It’s a levelling system which can be used to represent how much you have played. Every match gives you XP which goes into your levels. At level 100 you gain a Devotion and are brought back to Level 1, but with an increased number of Devotion. So in my case, I’ve hit Level 100 five times.
---
Then its fair and the guy I posted against is still wrong ;)
---
Thanks doc:)
---
Prestige 3 Freddy looks awesome IMO, after him I’d say Ghostface.
---
He shouldn't have to, that's the point, killers get a chance to counter the free win, but it's still tipped heavily in the survivors favor. I'm not complaining, I'm just speaking in terms of balance
---
I loved film a lot as a kid, it was creepy as he'll though. Especially the ghost with cage on her head, the Jackal I think.
---
Its happened to me twice in the last like 5-6 matches. Started running Deerstalker just to keep track of the slugs lol.
---
Balanced is also situational but you can use it in areas of the map where there is nothing else, a window is pretty useful on its own. Lithe also forced you to use it when it could be more useful to use the vault for a bit before sprinting away. Lithe is situational and tends to get wasted easily like sprintburst. Its not bad but the others are better
---
That’s just the norm for a lot of old people.... 
---
“U guys ready to queue yea go ahead.... uhh welll wait a sec wait a sec, give me 1 minuet here” rustling sounds are heard clearly indicating that teammate sat down his Mic and controller. after 10 seconds you can hear and I love voice... “youuuu still alive there grandpa?....”
---
Even better ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lol you said it should balance it out but you only listed the survivors overpowered add ons.  Surely this was an oversight and you aren't biased towards killer right?  Same exact suggestion let's get rid of Skeleton Keys, Instaheals, and Rainbow Maps along with Moris, Prayer Beads, Iri Heads, additional nurse blink addons and instasaw Billy.  You're good with this of course I assume?
---
Well i guess stake out can help until detectives hunch activates and you find ruin
---
Oh! Ok thanks guys. :)
---
Relatable... unfortunately...
---
ehm excuse me dance with me is meta
---
Bill on console when
---
Ok I mean no judgement but that’s a little under 9 hours a day. How do you not get overly frustrated with the game?
---
And tgen the double twist at the end brought it back full circle
---
lmfao. i want in on this free shit
---
First one is an Add-on that allows Myers to Mori survivors once he hits EW3 but goes back to EW2 and has to stalk to reach EW3 again. Second one sounds like a bug
---
Probably Billy, He s the fastest, numb to pain, and could chainsaw everybody into pieces
---
Once I had all survivor perks unlocked (which took only a month of very mild amounts of play) I was able to get my P3 Dwight to all perks at rank 3 within a week. It would be so beyond broken that the game would be unplayable. Survivors are already weighted more heavily than killers when you have full groups.
---
Shoulda used that key ;)
---
I think it's just bugged, I saw a streamer using it and that's the way it seems
---
If a bad killer kills everyone, that says a lot more about them than about him doesn't it Kappa
---
For obvious reasons the hatch is survivor sided.  1 v 1 is always killer aides so the hatch is there for balance.
---
AHAHAHA
---
Spirit is already in pieces
---
Currently rocking Poised, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, and Dark Sense/Spine Chill for gen jockeying
---
This is a recycled meme from a week or 2 ago :p just changed slightly
---
wow never heard I will have a look THANK YOU!
---
Love these type of games, is this definitely online and not fake?
---
80% killer, 20% survivor
---
No not really? In most situations regardless of skill, the killer is guaranteed to capture someone, since that’s how the game is designed (the killer is faster, the killer has an ability that helps, the killer has perks that help). Even braindead rank 20 killers can still capture someone from a high rank because the game is designed so that will occur.
---
Wraith - The Claudette of the killers. Wait until every other killer is dead except for one. Sneak up on the last killer and give a good - WACK!
---
Hey, does her sword still shatter when you carry someone and hit a wall?...I feel like I haven't seen that in forever.
---
What!!?? I never knew that lol
---
*insert shirtless myers joke here*
---
Freddy - Just sleep the last person alive     
---
or Nurse, she could go out of the map to get a coffee then come back to kill the last person
---
Fancy t-pose
---
Spirit for me. Not just because of the surreal aesthetic she has, but because of the sounds she makes. That crunchy glass scraping sound she makes makes me cringe every time I play/play against her.
---
A Survivor can get a free win without perks or ad ons? And that's there for balance? Makes sense
---
If I hook a survivor in the basement how closely can I patrol without camping? I wanna give survivors a decent chance but feel like I'm not getting much value out of the basement so far.
---
1: Fair call
---
2: True, but if i had $1 for every time someone bitched about queue times i could pay to have half the planet glassed, was just pointing it out
---
3: Mate, the votekick would involve the four survivors and not the killer, obviously...
---
YES! IVE BEEN PLAYING IT FOR A YEAR since it was released! the anniversary is actually in next week's update, though I must warn you the tutorial is really long
---
Wait, this meme was already made? Shit.
---
If the hatch wouldnt be there the killer had a free kill. Would that be fair? With the decent change the hatch became the most Balanced it has been for a long time.
---
Would the killer not see that the survivor stalled?
---
Black pip or half pip is when you don’t lose your current rank but you don’t get any as well. Full pip, or just pip, is when you rank up a pip. When you don’t earn enough score to get a black pip, you rank down. You see the little pips under your rank? That’s what that is.
---
He’s balanced but weak
---
Every time I see people abbreviate Ghost Face as 'GF' I always read girlfriend.
---
Pips are the rank up things you reach at the end of the game ( score totalled up)
---
Black pips are the bare minimum to NOT decrease in rank, so you don't rise (gain pips) nor fall (didn't reach black pips)
---
Yea like the daily of or right after the patch, except instead of Claudette it was Ash :) still a good meme thou
---
Make more pieces
---
It really depends on what addons you use and if you use an ebony mori
---
The reveal post said "Mid Chapter" so I'm assuming they'll be released week by week after the mid-chapter patch comes out, then the next wave of cosmetics after the next chapter.
---
The pip system is stupid anyway - it says almost nothing about the actual skill of the player - you can tank it, and a rank 1 survivor could just be someone who yeets out the hatch every day, for example.
---
Just googled translation of both words. I probably do.
---
Poor doctor
---
 this video can honestly help anyone and everyone thats trying to get better at video games even if youre already good and just want to take the next step "How to Get Better At Video Games" https://youtu.be/9I6vtKNmGF4
---
Not even that, most of them don’t even know about like the loud action mechanics or lockers or windows or anything at all really. I hit killer rank 1 on the last rank reset but I have not touched survivor ever since they locked off rank 16 and up from everyone else. I simply can’t do it, I’m the only person doing gens, chasing the killer, saving from hooks, and all my other survivors are doing fuckall.
---
I’ve found the best way to improve that is to stop running perks for stealth, when you run chase perks you are forced to get better at being chased. If you run stealth perks your only going to stealth. If your good at both you can be a really hard survivor to kill.
---
Ah I see. When is the mid-chapter patch?
---
Try 5 blinks.
---
How about this, if the increased rare-item bonus and the bloodlust clothes aren’t good enough for you, then don’t presteige. Not that hard
---
Without the hatch the killer wouldn't be getting a free kill, he earned it by killing everyone before they finished their objective :P
---
Shoulda kept going
---
Lol this is such a copout fucking response toxic babykillers use around here.  "They're going to hate on me anyway"...
---
No they're gonna hate on you because your killer play sounds like unfun cancer full of proxycamps and tunnels by the sounds of it.  I fucking stomp survivors without babystrats like camps, tunnels, etc...and I get next to zero salt from my opponents.  If I get a message it is more likely to be a gg or a wp because I don't play like a fucking asshole.  Killers that constantly receive salt postgame typically play like dicks.
---
I don’t get why survivors complain about a game where it’s 1v4 and the whole point is for a killer to kill the survivors like what?
---
Doctor is okay. He just a salty survivor!
---
If can get a 4k with no perks in purple ranks, I don't wanna see what its like with perks
---
I'd agree with the tunneling and slugging, to an extent, however camping just.. isn't okay.  
---
With slugging, I never let the survivor bleed out, I try not to waste their time.  
---
With tunneling, if youre both running away from the hook, and I happen to see you every time, well... I can't say that's my fault.  You're the only survivor that I can see, and youre a free hook.  More your fault than mine imo.  
---
Flashing pallets is okay.  Looping is usually okay, but being disrespectful or using unfair loops I can see as somewhat toxic.  
---
Being rude after match is never okay, though, no matter who did what.
---
It usually comes out around a month after the new chapter/DLC is out so we'll probably see it sometime in July.
---
Oh thank god, I was really hungry.
---
You have nothing to lose by closing in on them in the exit game to hit them. It has two outcomes: they’ll leave or they’ll stand there because they think you won’t do anything, so you can hit them again and probably get a hook on them. The exit gate isn’t a safe zone if you don’t allow it to be.
---
I paved the way for toxic Killer mains all over the world, i invented nod, I play top level, top level I rarely lost, too many killer crutch, against pallet loop my win inevitable, Until one day the game changed, killer queue empty, and I never play killer again. I was good before pallet nerf. But not after.
---
Thanks for the new profile picture
---
I had someone say I was hacking cause of mad grit
---
This is kind of quality content I subbed for.
---
I've never tried.  That would be interesting to see, but I have no desire to waste time on it.
---
*Yeetus deletus*
---
😂😂😂 I was watching the movie last night and I was like...oh damn, this is exactly how I feel in the game xD
---
These kind of moments are why I love her.
---
R.I.P. Ace 'Walt Disney' Visconti
---
If you are at low ranks people are bad at the game and think everyone is op even freddy. In reality hes low to mid tier as his power is mostly tracking.
---
This week we're getting Feng's and Wraith's skins
---
Next week we're getting leather outfit pig and undercover Tapp
---
Week after that we're getting Test Subject (saw 3) Pig and Police Officer Tapp
---
Don't call me out like this
---
When i play survivor i get rank 5 all day   when i play killer i get 4 rep 20 ochido fanboys why try to be toxic but just get chainsawed and hooked
---
I think an allseeing build is fun, like nurses, BBQ, bitter murmur or discordance, and a throwaway perk (maybe bloodwarden could have some fun potential, sloppy butcher, etc). Gives you a lot of power, especially if you try to sleep everyone immediately.
---
Bro that's kinda epic
---
Rank not rep
---
Isnt it fun to see you are matched with literal rank 20s every other game
---
I’m trying to depict if this is sarcasm or not
---
Be warned, the community in Identity V is just as toxic as DBD with server chat you can't turn off.
---
Also if you shouldn't play it if you like being the *hunter* role, the game favors survivors a *HELL* of a lot more than you see in DBD.
---
Killers should always let go when this happens
---
Yes, it's relatable for sure.
---
Jake is the worst
---
Ace and Claudette are the best
---
How is using items in the game playing dirty?
---
BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, NOED, M&amp;A, spirit fury, and enduring sounds balanced 
---
This ^^^^^^
---
Wait the blinks are a teachable perk?
---
When your 2 most used perks are part of this picture...
---
Holy fuck slendermin got me good
---
And the survivor earned the Chance to Servive by szrviving the longest and therefore making the killer Not fulfilling his objective.
---
Doctor isn’t great by any means Necessary. But he’s a noobstomper, him and Freddy are. 
---
Reasons why Noobs don’t like the doctor is they can’t deal with the doc knowing where they are all the time.
---
That one is completely your fault. The gate will open, you don't need to watch it. Look around, spine chill activated so you knew she was coming, you could easily have dodged those throws.
---
Additionally to the reasons you play killer, I also play killer to punish the toxic survivors
---
Spirit isn’t a Nurse, but her power comes pretty close to letting her ignore pallets to an extent. I personally would rather use her power to get a hit rather than charge into a pallet. But yeah, it’s not “bad” on any M1 killer.
---
so nothing for bill then?
---
This post means one of two things.  You're either a god-tier troll (seriously the bards will sing of this post for a 100 years)  OR you're simply the worlds worst survivor lol.
---
Dead hard has always been glitched, and it’s very easy to counter. The actual invincibility window is real small, and any experienced killer who knows you have dead hard won’t get got by it.
---
this happened to me yesterday after i had already broken the ruin. i was like, are you fucking kidding???
---
I solo queued in a survivor game (big mistake) and I looped the Bubba for a really long time and my rank twenty teammates didn’t do any gens. Finally, I escaped him and did every gen before escaping.
---
And that's the exact reason I play him, I don't like finding people
---
I'm rank 12 as survivor and 10 as killer. I am more of a survivor main but this shit happens so much recently that I find playing killer is less exhausting. I know the matching system is kinda wacky when SWF is involved but this seems more like a problem that pops up every now and then, based on my experience. I'm in Asia but do regions matter? Maybe DbD don't have enough Asian players so they just match me with some newbies? I don't know.
---
Lol.  This would have been spot on but it's a bit out of date.  Honestly, who the hell DC's against post rework Legion these days?  He isn't even that annoying anymore.
---
Freddy he’s technically Immortal.
---
Michael Myers as well since we’ll ya guessed it he is immortal. 
---
Cannibal and Billy are interesting but alas a chainsaw isn’t a good way to kill someone due to how ineffective it could be with how slow it is going through the body also with it getting clogged up due to flesh getting in it. 
---
Also if he is up and personal all you have to do is get a nice stab. 
---
Legion and Ghostface are the worst. I mean you could probably put any humanoid character as the worse. 
---
Spirit well she has a long range weapon so she has that going for her. 
---
Wraith doesn’t need to fight he can sit that one out.
---
Make Your Choice and Surveillance make Piggy worth the purchase. If you have those from the Shrine though, then yeah GF is pretty fun to play as
---
I bought the Hag the other day and went up against a swf team that were out of my league- I managed to get two out of four but it was a battle the whole way and half of it was dumb luck. After one of the remaining ones offered me a ‘pro strats’ and it made me pretty happy :’)

Bubba cause he's big with a multi hit saw, Spirit in 2nd cause she'd be pretty hard to kill, Huntress 3rd cause she's got range attack

The game can definitely get my blood boiling sometimes when I don’t get saved on my first hook or get camped etc but I never dwell on it. I just remind myself that it’s my team or the killers fault, not mine. But there are moments where I take an hour or so off if things get very annoying. I usually get back on immediately lmao.

On what owo

I never care for phone games

you could just leave if the ping is bad

It's a glitch that sometimes happens

I agree entirely, I liked it when it was a creepy slow paced game, now it's just another shitty "esport"

It was an afk and we wanted bloodpoints. But then he just got stuck behind the box

wHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
---
I have already been testing it
---
Nope.
---
was there a point when no mither was meta?
---
Lol imagine if you could do this as a survivor. I mean I’m pretty much just hopping after people the whole game anyways bc I suck as the killer.
---
Why is he so bad?
---
I’m honestly so fuckin sick of playing survivor. I just had TWO games in a row where the legion would frenzy me, and then leave, but I couldn’t mend. Not even an option. 
---
And when shit like that doesn’t happen, you know what does? I do everything for my team and they do n o t h i n g and just crouch walk around like dumb immersed morons and get hooked after five milliseconds of a chase meanwhile I’ll loop the killer for twenty damn years and NO gens get done.

Killer is the only way I really have fun playing dbd anymore

That's was intense LOL!

they must add it with that name

good
---
Are gonna give me your big bubba cummies after? UwU

(I’m sorry)

That baby Meg didn't even bring a perk. I guess the killer was having fun.

Why not both?

A lot of hurt people on here.

Because they or I got the definition of hacking.  If I’m correct,  modding is technically hacking.
---
Anyway, I wasn’t trying to call anyone out.  Just pointing out that if you mod your game beyond just swapping pngs then you make cause glitches.
---
Not sure how this is controversial— just a comment in a game thread.
---
I agree with everyone saying new mori and here's my idea. You keep it more or less the same but you end it with his weapon getting stuck in the survivors head and then ripping out their head and spine. Just like what he did to his boss.
---
Literally aids. Games give me a bunch of useless perks, maybe 60 bloodwebs past 50 yet still no adrenaline
---
My highest rank as survivor is literally rank 10 because every time I play survivor no matter the rank I just get frustrated because I either do everything, or get facecamped and my teammates do nothing during the duration of me being facecamped. 
---
As killer it’s only 11 because I’ve only really just started to get into killer more and play it more often. Kinda becoming a killer main at this point lmao, at least then when I do bad it’s my fault and I can’t get mad at anybody else
---
Resilience, Tenacity, BK and DwM are actually decent lmfao
---
Damnit Kevin!
---
It does have potential for stalking at a wider degree as well as an increased chance to spot who kicked you out of Night Shroud.
---
and then when the killer gets on them THENNNNN they’ll come to the gen lmao
---
You think ruin is unbalanced? Thought you guys were gods at finding totems within the first 30 seconds of the match
---
Oh god don’t remind me it’s so frustrating. At this point I’m leaning towards becoming a killer main lmao
---
Of course, it's a fun show.
---
What movie is this?
---
I would throw all the pallets I found...
---
IF I COULD FIND ONE!
---
Was really interesting to read
---
Pig to win
---
*cries in having literally zero friends who play dbd or will even try it out*
---
at the end of a match, regarding how you performed, you either :
---
*depip  : you lose one rank point
---
*black pip : you neither nor win a rank point
---
*pip : you win one rank point
---
To know how to optimally gain emblem points and pip refer to this [article](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems)
---
No that’s exactly what I was talking about.    New/inexperienced players will eat hatchets at pallets.   That’s what I meant by predictable hatchets.  If you just run through the pallet (and she winds up a hatchet) she loses ground vs you.  Which is devastating since she’s one of the slowest killers.
---
If you’re having problems with Huntress try using sprint burst.  As soon as you hear her song hightail it across the map.  It forces her to either commit to a long chase or bank on hitting a long range hatchet.  
---
You said “good players won’t let you abuse pallets,,,” but the strategy you’re talking about is day one shit dude. Completely avoidable
---
R.I.P. season four.
---
I think you should only say gg when you actually felt like it was a good game. Otherwise it just loses it's meaning and becomes this hollow shell of what it used to be.
---
Freddy rework will make illusion pallets so at least u will find some
---
Makes sense... I should try to get out of my comfort zone!
---
I have a friend who won't do a gen at the beginning of the game until she sees someone else get hit...
---
Last night i got paired with a 4 man swf, and they were the most toxic bunch i’ve ever seen. all had instant heal syringes, 2 had gen rushing perk setups and 2 had altruistic/looping setups, i got palled looped and flashlighted all game. after the game i got a message from all of them along the lines of “i would say ggez but you were a trash killer and couldn’t even get a 1k so bye”
---
I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
Eh it’s not that bad. Only survive with friends I dislike are the ones who do toxic shit, hate matching against them, but besides that there’s nothing wrong with it so long as they just play the game if you ask me
---
Doctor isn't op just requires no skill for tracking
---
Fair enough haha
---
Really likely its just lag mate, lagswitching is not common let alone on a console.
---
I was body blocking for free hits at pallets camping etc
---
I wouldn’t say she’s a child, but more of an animal, since she hasn’t been around humans lmao. She grew up based on survival, so I’d consider her a monster if anything.
---
Where is it from ?
---
Gotta love perk roullete
---
It’s not balanced until maps are fixed and bullshit loops are deleted, m1 killers are buffed to be on hillbilly’s tier, and nurse is nerfed to billy tier.
---
 google **this from yeah!**
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Unless you’re running this with Lithe and you have some very good line of sight blockers, then I’m sorry, but it ain’t going places. This fact is also supported if you’re injured since you still leave blood behind, and can be even worse if they have Bloodhound.
---
You just posted cringe
---
Def not, you shouldn't be facetanking pallets as Spirit. You use the power to catch up and hit people in dead zones, after vaults, or by surprise if they are at a pallet. Even if they are standing right on a pallet you will usually get them if you lunge through straight out of Spirit Walk as it is not reactable, so they have to guess your exact timing. Even easier if you loop around behind them first. 
---
On pallet loops you should be using the power in very short bursts to quickly zoom to the other side of the loop until you catch them within lunge range, so you almost never have to run the loop like a normal killer. Usually only if you burn all the meter moving across the map or you use all your power and still don't hit them. With recovery addons especially the down-time is almost negligable.
---
Slot in BBQ/Ruin and then take your pick of perks like Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher and Stridor (to counter Iron Will and make it easier to follow people). Pop Goes the Weasel might be a decent option too if you want further gen slowing.
---
I play Ghostface so I wanna join the T-party &gt;:(
---
Doing good with piggy will make you super happy to be honest.
---
And she's the best killer to do gen YOINKS.
---
This, but with no-addon Nurse and if they‘ve „ggez“d me. Of course it was easy to go against a Huntress on Torment Creek or Haddonfield goddammit, no need to be smug about it!
---
THEY SAID JAKE IS THE WORST ACE AND CLAUDETTE ARE THE BEST
---
Wait.. LF can actually wear survivor faces as cosmetics? That’s awesome! 
---
Probably fairly obvious question for experienced players, but I only started playing about a week ago so apologies
---
I've found I rank up much faster as Killer, but as soon as I get to 11-12, I do pretty shitty when the SWFs and purple ranks start showing up. I still haven't found a good strategy, but found my footing with Billy.
---
Nea of course.  I am so fucking original.  Go ahead and give me my comedy award.
---
And that right there is why he's my main
---
Well there was the Wake Up bug and now there’s an audio bug that needs to be fixed
---
Hes not OP, hes just lazy
---
No I'm actually serious I didnt know.
---
I see you’re a man of culture one that uses the spirit
---
Like I said it depends on map. In Shelter Woods Balanced is a wasted perk slot, but on a lot of maps it is better than other exhaustion perks. Dead Hard is too buggy for my tastes, I got sick of using Dead Hard, still getting hit, getting exhaustion, and seizing around on the floor real quick
---
Krieg as far as we know is still alive, but as for Borderlands villians that HAVE died? ... Jack wouldn't be a fit. Too charismatic. 
---
It's hard to say man. Most of Borderlands' villians are just plain old dudes, or really charismatic people. Even Vallory is kinda motherly to an extent.
---
Also fun fact: it was introduced in V2.0. This means that it was never in this game at the start, rather, when the Curtain Call.
---
This is why I like running bind, lets me know when I should leave the area.

When bloodwarden works, it works.
---
I run empathy so that as soon as someone is hit I know whether I'm safe or not. Bond doesn't have as large of a radius as empathy :p
---
I couldn’t read it... but I did like the part of the mercy hatch
---
Are you fucking serious? I have over 100 hours, almost exclusively killer and I never knew that
---
I hate this game of emotions we play
---
Lithe + Dance With Me + Quick and Quiet = WHERE I GO
---
wow you’re a pro gamer bruh
---
Whats your strat with trapper? Do you normally wait to use traps until you've gotten a hook?
---
Aw that is adorable!
---
Yeah I got one with pig on my first game ever and then I learned that I just got extremely lucky
---
Honestly I think the opposite ... try out other builds but with only 4 perk slots available you should suit them to what helps you the best. If you’re not good at hiding then run stealth perks, if you’re not good at chases run chase perks, if you’re not good at skill checks well git gud.
---
Pips are stepping stones towards reaching the next rank. The number of pips required to rank up changes between ranks, as do the requirements. If you do poorly in a match you de-pip, regressing by one step towards the previous rank. A black pip is neutral, so you move neither up nor down (this is sometimes called a safety pip). A pip takes you up a step, while a double pip lets you jumps up two steps at once. Here is a summary of the rank system.  
---
When you view the rank section of the post game lobby, a bar fills up across the screen. There are 3 arrows on the bar that mark the thresholds for determining rank changes. These 3 arrows separate the bar into 4 regions: de-pip, black-pip, pip, and double-pip. How much the bar fills is determined by your emblem score for the game. Each emblem you get is worth a point value: None, bronze, silver, gold, iridescent = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. When you add them together you get an emblem score. The maximum value is 16, which will always result in a double pip. As you rank up, the arrows marking the thresholds will move to the right, increasing the requirements for pipping.
---
Why does everyone assume spirit could be hurt by anything? She's a freaking ghost, all weapons would go right through her. I doubt any of the other killers could kill a ghost. 
---
In reality spirit and freddy would just stand there unable to hurt each other.
---
Michael being immortal? I don't know about that, he seems to just have a lot of plot armor.
---
Just for tracking though he still has to chase people
---
This pleases the Nut.
---
I don’t know what that ghostface was doing but nice job
---
If you love her then why aren’t you the 4th one
---
But most of these perks were never good.
---
Ghostface is more C. 
---
Myers is B I believe or maybe C. 
---
Huntress Depending on player is B or C
---
Any scary movie memes get an upvote from me.
---
and her default look is really easy to see so if you go with kate you gotta learn how to survive a chase really quickly
---
Saved everyones time too
---
Well yes, but actually, no.
---
Killer main here rank 10 all I get is either semi good rank 15-7s or pro 4 man flashlight/insta heal stacks. Kinda wish console was better with the matchmaking
---
That perk is so not worth the slot anymore.  NOED gamers got it nuked into oblivion.  I'd just run something else at this point man.
---
I've played it for quite some time. It's really well made and plays pretty balanced. I gave up when i saw how long i would have to grind for the werewolf though.
---
No idea if it's really bots. Sometimes other survivors do such stupid things that i can't believe them to be bots.
---
Yes! We have two hands, can obviously carry moar things. In fact, some of us have backpacks to fill with items.
---
yeah I've been a Claudette main for forever and I feel like I'm the only one who bothers being immersed
---
Rather than requiring three hits to proc, it needs three protection hit score events to proc. But protection is bugged afaik so it's gone straight into the bin.
---
body blocking isn’t toxic.
---
Gg ez baby killer xD
---
What was the post-game chat like?
---
Unless they patched in awhile back I haven’t versed Huntress in ever. But I’m pretty sure her and Freddy never had directional sound cue. The terror radius just stayed the same sound whether they where far or close.
---
Again, you want her to have 1 blink?
---
Survivor balancing. Smh
---
I would try to help if I could. Sometimes they are adorable and I feel bad if the killer tunnels or camps them. There's nothing much I could do though, when all 3 of them were down before I could come over.
---
God damn you. Resilience is GOD
---
You could get freddy in anticipation of the rework
---
Wow,just wow! If we are going to be nerfing survivor perks let’s nerf killer perks as well,starting with NOED
---
I noticed that people will downvote even when they don't agree with only one position. I don't agree in 100% but I'll upvote anyway, because it kinda matches my list
---
Anybody who calls doctor OP is probably a noob or salty
---
Well I know you don’t care about perks but Spirit has 2 great perks. Now as that’s out of the way. 
---
Spirit is the second best killer. Her power relies on tracking and hearing things. 
---
I’m not a legion main I’m sure you can come across someone that will give you upsides if legion but alas I cannot. 
---
Freddy’s getting reworked but who knows if he will be good. Besides he has 1 mediocre perk which is Bloodwarden.
---
He's one of the worst killers, but new players struggle against him
---
Go easy, he's still learning.
---
Also, Doctor for life
---
i’m playing legion, i’ll hop that shit right with you
---
hell yeah
---
Contact the developers they'll sort it out
---
It works GOOD
---
So that's not...normal?
---
You mean like how Enduring was just nerfed?
---
It's almost like Killers actually do get nerfs too.
---
I'm good with how the game is now. I was being sarcastic and the OP was being biased towards killer add ons being overpowered. I don't care about InstaHeals, and skeleton keys or whatever add ons bad survivors need. More often than not, it doesn't help them for much longer. And sure, get rid of instasaw Billy and iri heads. I don't use those killers anyway.
---
By all means not normal
---
I’m still sitting at Plunderer’s Instinct 1 on Ace. I’m mad.
---
Doctor is a term originally ascribed to scientists and researchers or masters of a field. Physicians scooped that one up. Doctor is a maybe Doctor (credentials questionable since he got a pass from the govt) but not a physician.
---
nice to see that i'm not the only who likes that ghostface set
---
Survivor about to vault window*
---
Iridescent huntress: No I don't think so.
---
Even in red ranks I’ll just run around shocking the whole match if I have a ritual.
---
All my perks are on the floor (≖︿≖ )
---
i wanna try it out tbh it looks fun to use
---
Amen brotha, I bought Kate a week ago and I didn't have any good perks so I started using this one and it is indeed underrated.
---
Thx
---
Huntress was my first too. I’ve gotten worse with her though from switching, my aims off sadly :(
---
I got Myers after using an offering to play as him, then awhile after I used an offering to play as the pig I got her
---
And now I’m on a spirit kick but still play the other 3 lol
---
Except ours.
---
Well your question was is it worth it to stay injured , it is , whether it’s fun or not to go against a ranged attack
---
“get her, jade!” -the entity to the killer, probably
---
Oh ok 😂
---
I appreciate this advice! I don't really know yet if I plan to really shoot for the best ranks or anything, I mainly bought the game as something to play when I want to, The killers are all pretty varied in difficulty from what i've seen, as for looping, that'll just come with time, as will hiding my light ;P
---
also this makes no sense, survivors are supposed to heal,, killers arent supposed to slug. but whatever strategy works, works.
---
John Kramer is that you
---
There is the achievement for shocking survivors and getting them all to T3 insanity.
---
Same for me when I get a ritual like this x)
---
While i like the show, the movies will always be MILES better
---
It’s a good anti healing build! great if you’re like me and will break mid chase to injure a new survivor. If you can force everyone to prioritize healing you can basically always catch them and at least know where they are.
---
I liked spirit for a little awhile, I managed to get her to 50 but didn't think it was worth a prestige. I played Billy for a bit and then went back to her only to realize how slow she actually is without phasing, made me sad
---
that perk build oh my *god*
---
Well he definitely got it then ... or was that bad that he didn’t
---
Lmao for real? Slugging is now toxic and shitty? Why the fuck would I ever hook someone when I know the second I pick this cunt up you'll be gone. That's ridiculous. Cmon guys.
---
Spirit is the most fun killer in this game imo.
---
If you like mindgames then even better, shes definitely my favorite and she is very competitive as well. Once you get to know how she works you can demolish survivors. Also there are a lot of different builds you can run on her for example Mother daughter ring and prayer beads to yoink people off gens, etc.
---
Devs: We nerfed Remember Me because it would be too op in a 1vs1 endgame.
---
Devs:
---
Or stop crying cause survivors are op and toxic af. Especially SWF.
---
I think I'll get spirit and buy the shovel
---
Take a sticky note, rip a a little strip and put it on your screen where the hatchet goes so you can always line up and only have to worry about drop.
---
*Player Icon turns red*
---
Careful guys this must be the work of a killer...
---
Sounds like you're forgetting the toxic killer things, like slugging at the end of the game, pretending to take a survivor to the hatch, hitting them on the hook, etc
---
.. to let the other survivor have a chance? also i never said it was toxic, nor shitty. its just a scummy way to play. if they’re desperate for the 4k then hey go ahead whatever, i dont dictate how you play
---
The chase music is lowered which is nice, makes the survivor noises louder for the killer to find. The only thing that I hate is that specific killer power sounds have also gone away for me. I can't hear when Billy is charging his chainsaw and by the time I realize it's too late. This is for every killer even Myers' stalk doesn't make noise with each tier.
---
&gt; Or stop crying
---
&gt; cause survivors are op and toxic af
---
Ok dude.
---
Yeah she ain’t the fastest but I still love playin as her regardless
---
Plus he's actually really fun right now honestly. Not viable in low ranks but high ranks you can destroy
---
Nah trust me. Every time I've gotten into a match after getting tired of waiting 20 mins for a killer queue when shit like this happens the killer never wants to admit they got shit internet. It's that excuse right there.
---
dead by daylight is definitely not tournament ready. it has so many bugs that can break the game (the not being able to escape, for example) that’ll ruin it. its very hard to do in a tournament setting.
---
That's good. Learning is the best.
---
I reccomend watching some killer streams to see how they hide their lights. A lot of times you'll see them walk backwards towards a corner, then turn around and lunge. There's a lot of timing+practice that into hiding your light, but I'm sure you can get it down! Welcome to the fog, my man.
---
Discord
---
Bond is still better, doesn't matter if your teammate gets hit across the map you only need to know within around 30's meters to make a clean dip.
---
Yare yare daze...
---
Nice. A clockwork orange shirt.
---
do not start with nurse. shes the hardest to learn, and she completely ignores loops so when you play killers that have to loop, you’ll have no idea what to do. start with billy or huntress.
---
WHAT A.... ghostface!
---
Yes, of course.  I personally love the one with the army of the dead the most.
---
The 1st 4 only
---
I started playing DBD at the end of last month because it was available on Xbox Game Pass. The first few weeks I did pretty well as a survivor, but after the rank reset I'm just getting wrecked every match. Similar situation to yours. I fix gens and distract the killer, but nothing else gets done by my team. I've pretty much gone on a losing streak this past week and it's frustrating.
---
I hope you enjoy the spirit!
---
*t-bag*
---
Yeah i agree with what you are saying there but we will be monitoring what they are doing for example broken game features like exploits and that we would also give them retry if it was too broken and if they go though escape and ti just takes them out the map (its happened to me before lol) then we will count it as an escape
---
Ez DC tbh
---
okay makes sense. it’ll be rough to manage but
---
Gotta actually sacrifice them, and not just down or hook them.
---
Jake is difficult to get, because it seems like you never see them when going for it. Got all 4 myself awhile ago, though
---
How much kills do you need for the mask?
---
What about parachute Dwight and wasteland huntress?
---
yeah but we do have a lot of people helping so we should hopefully be fine lol
---
👌 got you
---
Thanks dad
---
I feel ya man, I was playing with a friend and the match got canceled but it still ate his event cake
---
I'm killer rank 9, not the best killer with the highest level or the best knowledge, but facing a sfw that's rank 2, 4, 8 and 8, where 3 has object, all have dead hard and adrenaline, and loop me into the shadow realm truly isn't fun.
---
even if protections hit would work correctly people wouldn't use mettle.
---
Yeah but this is a 3 v 1 endgame, so it’s OK.
---
Perks are important, no matter how strong of a killer you are. Eventually, you are going to need specific perks. Nurse's calling, enduring, BBQ and chilli, hex:ruin, etc. You wont be using each of these perks every time, but they are some of the strongest in the game.
---
Nurse is the best killer in the game, but super hard to learn. The Spirit is 2nd, with Billy close behind. 
---
One major thing you need to know when chasing, if it feels like a survivor is running you for too long just leave them for someone else.
---
Did you just pretend to be someone else
---
Sit down
---
Bro I literally got this game in October and I only have one devotion level lmao
---
25 hook sacrifices only, unsure of endgame kills
---
ah
---
Yea I'd only get perks for characters I dont have..  but I save my shards for outfits and new dlcs.
---
My go to is huntress pink axe with belt. Ruin, sloppy, bbq, knockout and a Mori.
---
Protection hits are beyond bugged. I get them at random points when I shouldn’t and I don’t get them when I blatantly protect someone. Until protect hits are fixed or bhvr makes safe unhooks count as a token, I wouldn’t use MoM.
---
Damnit Karen!
---
"even more dumb than 2"
---
Work on your communications then.
---
Fun fact, you can stop nurse from blinking with a flashlight. Not really that effective but you can do it.
---
[&gt;Shining a Flashlight for ~2 seconds upon The Nurse will stun her in place for ~2 seconds. A slightly faster fatigue animation will play, albeit without the tunnel vision VFX.
---
Although not strictly a stun, The Nurse also cannot start a Blink whilst a Flashlight is being shone upon her.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lightburn)
---
I guess considering she hunts like an ancient human
---
25, only sacrifices count
---
Try "Windows of Opportunity"
---
This can still happen after so many years!? 😂
---
I mean nurse is dumb, she shouldnt be in the game. She doesnt follow any rules of the game. Shes like a different game entirely. They cant just delete her at this point so just make her basekit and be done with it.
---
Yeah, I’ve started running it recently while I practice better looping/pathing and it definitely helps, especially with avoiding dead zones later in the match. The buff was sorely needed and helped it out a lot.
---
I’m gonna have to say false statement on that one. I don’t have all those perks as a Claudette and I’m not one of those crouch in the corner for 5 minutes walking in a circle Clauds neither. I’m the Claud that thinks I’m being bold in evasive playing on the jungle gym while the killer watches for 15 seconds before smacking me... Oh and I heal sometimes
---
It's unconventional but my bet is on Adam.
---
Is small game not good?
---
They are adding a battle pass....
---
You scare me. I was Adam.
---
Ive been thinking about how nurse could be balanced, and my favorite idea is add cooldown to her blink charges.
---
1 charge ~ 5 seconds.
---
Max charges = max blinks.
---
So if a nurse has 3 blinks, she uses her first one, a charge goes on CD, and lets say she uses 1 more chainblink, then she'd have 1 more left with her second one coming off of cooldown after the fatigue ends. If she decides to blink again immediately, she can use 2 blinks only because her 3rd one is on CD. They could mess around with the CD and everything, but im pretty sure this would be a nice way to make her less op.
---
Yes. In a 1v1. Not 3v1.
---
100 % agreed man. I can’t vent about this enough, I literally am not even trying to get out of rank 19 because there’s no point. I have my meg at p3 and my Claudette and p2, all for nothing because I literally cannot play with solo queuing survivors. Fuck that. And swf is just too much work, I’ve always preferred killing people anyway I don’t wanna be bothered.
---
That last sentence sounds rly weird out of context lol
---
The very first thing you should do is YouTube killer mechanics. One of the first things I learned is still the most useful, the moon slash. It catches survivors off guard every. Single. Time.
---
Feelsgoodman
---
WOOOO
---
Great play dude.
---
Me too
---
Sometimes it’s fun once you learn to loop a little bit. I’m still learning but I use to camp the walls because I was scared to go in the middle of the map. But now that I’ve somewhat learned some layouts I can loop at a novice level. And sometimes you might surprise yourself with your moves :D
---
Lmao his iridescents are shit. Cool down add ons are the best thing.
---
I noticed this yesterday. Is this a new change or something?
---
He’s a mid tier Killer. Doctor is nowhere near OP unless you’re a noob.
---
they're gr8 imo xd
---
The actual *what* this is too accurate
---
Well majority of people seem to disagree.
---
Jane's are shit. Legit worst character. This is strictly playstyle mind you. Ever Jane I go against as killer is either trash or toxic and every Jane as a survivor farms me off hook and drops every fucking pallet on the map and doesnt even stunn the killer.
---
Devil's advocate: It's hard to tell that you're the one lagging in that position.  
---
But then it still just looks like the other person is lagging so if they think teleporting is being bad they're talking out of their ass.
---
Damnit Kyle!
---
I don’t like season passes or preorder since you’re paying for something blindly. You have no idea whether you’ll waste your money on the product or not. 
---
So no I don’t think they should have a season pass. 
---
Also only game id preorder is Darksouls 4 or Bloddborne 2 since I liked all of the games and never have been personally let down by any of them.
---
A battle pass prized higher than the game itself? Sign me up. Also a pass is coming to the game...
---
Idk if it was meta but as a killer actively tries not to tunnel it's aggravating as hell
---
Yeah, I thought so. 
---
I had this one guy that was the last survivor and he was the best player on the team. We ended the match where I chased him a bit so he got points then I'd chainsaw him and carry him around giving him a chance to get free. Rinse and repeat, he caught on and finally I felt bad so I let him have a hatch escape.
---
His whole team died in the first 5 minutes and repaired no generators. This guy was the only one pulling the weight. He deserved a win and some chase points.
---
I like just killers as funny as that sounds :) lol
---
I don’t see why they haven’t done it yet. We already know what they’re releasing for dlc this year just let me pay for it now
---
I stopped playing survivor until dedicated servers drop simply because it seems like every killer I connent with is red bar. So it's either wait 30 minutes + to find a good connection lobby. Or wait 5-10 minutes to find a yellow/red bar lobby and deal with the frustrations or skipping around and skill checks that never actually appear. Either way my queue times take a long time on ps4 since they reverted the changes, and when I do connect I don't even get to properly play the game.
---
Iron Will instead of Urban Evasion and that’s my build for my P3 Claudette
---
Yeah I think it's a waste of shards if it's a character you have. Really though the only perks I'd spend shards on are decisive or deliverance.
---
This exactly. I was a red rank survivor for a while, and I stopped playing for a few months. I'd play occasionally (and still do play occasionally), but not enough to get back to red ranks. Because of this I've pretty much been stuck around rank 14-16, and it's basically unplayable. It's either I get chased for half the game while my teammates don't do anything, or I do everything while they go down in chases every 3 seconds. I get that a lot of them are new, so I can't hate on them for trying, but I hate being stuck with new players when I've been playing for almost 2 years
---
I love this

Enduring was buffed tbh, pallet stuns are now shorter and that was all Enduring was really useful for without being total BS
---
Fucking S tier meme right here
---
Jakes cosmetics suck ):
---
For real tho when I play killer it's like I'm against a professional E sports team but when I'm survivor I just see people DC or just run around the maps without doing gens or totems or even  dealing with the killer
---
I mean I always thought T-bagging was toxic in general
---
I like this idea
---
That was nice
---
This absolutely this. I thought it was just my games. 
---
"Where are these guys when I'm survivor?!!"
---
Since it's available on gamepass I decided to download it for xbox (ps4 main here).   I've definitely but getting quicker games.  Granted I went from Rank 20 to Rank 8 in a few hours, but the killers on xbox feel....inexperienced?  I know it's lower rank, but you will find some strong killers on PS4, even in the lower ranks.
---
off topic - what tf is up with the graphics on xbox?  I feel like I'm playing borderlands on 240p.  Characters look like comic book cutouts, nothing is clear, I can't see more than few meters ahead of me.  It's f'ing awful.  PS4 is definitely more crisp, and PS4 Pro is much better.  Maybe it's different for the One X?  I apologize, I'm really not trying to start some flame war nonsense.  But, is this a thing that others have complained about?
---
When the Claudette is using more of megs perks than hers
---
I didn’t actually mean to specifically type body blocking, I know that it isn’t toxic
---
I just want his Face/Off
---
I like it
---
Idk toxic is such a watered down term now, ironically I think calling people toxic for how they play the game has become toxic.
---
Personally I find slugging way more annoying than camping but neither is toxic.
---
Forgot about those! Fixed
---
Wrong tag, use question
---
shes black
---
My buddy had all the faces and every time he saw a Jake in his lobby I swear he got too excited
---
Haha picture of pallets haha
---
If a game was graphically improved or enhanced for the ps4 pro, while being lower resolution/etc on the base Xbox One, then it will still look worse on the Xbox One X, until they update it with an Xbox One X Enhanced patch.
---
For example, MGS5. It was given a 4k Ps4 Pro Patch, but kept at lower settings on the Xbox One, even if you own an Xbox One X. So it still looks better on a Ps4 Pro.
---
Halloween chapter for decisive strike, leatherface for barbecue and chilli
---
Tbh I could go without Dwight and huntress cosmetics just so I can get my piggy ones sooner lmao
---
No Mither and Pharmacy?
---
Nope. I know all maps and I know that the basement appears in one of two places. I find it first and trap around it. It's a maze to get in and out of for anyone but me. I'll also trap up a few pallets on the way to some gens to cut looping. That's it.
---
I used to bring moris every time I saw a Jake as LF. As I Jake main it killed me inside. Then to add salt to the wound I found out moris don’t even count for the faces 😞
---
As a pig main, I whole-heartedly agree. Figures they're saving the best for last...
---
If you just ingnore it and don’t get offended it has nothing to do with the game
---
Survivor: Rank 10, main Feng Min
---
Killer: Rank 8, main Hillbilly
---
Ikr but like I would think they would wanna get all the licensed ones out of the way first
---
I don't even own Leatherface so I had no idea this was a mask option. That's pretty cool
---
If you think about it, all of the current DLC already amounts to way more than the game currently costs so it would be cheaper to have everything in one bundle
---
What?
---
y my pp big hard?
---
Buying a season pass is like flushing money down the toilet to see if you can find where it ends up.
---
Doctor not final boss?! Reported.
---
In the same sense when DH can stay up long enough. When it does, ohhhh boi this gonna be good
---
And you'd THINK they would be releasing together, but from what evidence we have, that isn't the case. We're 95% getting Leather outfit and Test Subject outfit a week apart from each other
---
Not on ps4
---
Huntress?
---
I want autodidact so bad but I still need to unlock it
---
Boi, he only has one nipple and it’s on the left side. Smh
---
Just run the normal meta perks bro. Bitch killer mains complained until it was destroyed. Not to mention protection hits are beyond bugged.
---
She’s probably pallet camping and flashlight ambushing
---
It happens. I got stuck in a really bad rut after the reset and hovered around the 8-10 range for a long time. Same problem: Generally just got chodes for teammates.
---
Play enough and you work your way out of it. Just keep trying to play your game and not worry too much when your teammates are idiots.
---
"I can't do a thing myself so the devs should fix it"
---
I can snap out of it with time to spare on a BT timer, you must just be waiting way too long or failing the skill checks 🤡
---
I bet no noed is gonna be a rule.
---
:O
---
AMAZINNGGGGG!
---
Is this based off of the figurine? She’s so pretty!!!
---
i suck at running away so my strategy is to find the nearest window / locker / pallet, loop for like 10 secs before im hit and after ive made enough scratch marks i either fly away with lithe or disappear into a locker w quick and quiet
---
I was grinding out matches as The Clown for a ritual, getting my ass embarrassingly put down by SWF gen running and red/purple ranks slamming me with flashlights and firecrackers, disconnecting before death, and I was taking a big hit to my killer rank. Then, not only did I finally get the ritual but I figured out Clown's play style enough to pressure down on the survivors that I also earned Adept Clown. It felt damn good. 
---
And then Adept Wraith the following day, which caught me completely off guard .
---
I miss watching courage as a kid
---
But wouldn’t her name be Michaela since it’s the female form of Michael?
---
I'm the only Claudette actually being altruistic?
---
I'm running Self-Care, Borrow time, Empathy and Dead Hard
---
That’s exactly why I like playing pig. She’s fun to play against and I enjoy using some unexpected perks to make the game more interesting.
---
Oh BTW the top comment was a joke I really don’t like how survivors and killers are always complaining how “ThIS pErK iS sO oP pLs NeRf” I personally think that once a pErK is made it should stay the way it is (unless is absolutely broken)
---
Here's how it goes every time: Claud's face first, followed shortly by Meg, eventually Dwight, then pray to God you see a Jake
---
thanks. I hate it.
---
Maybe a little random idea 
---
Practice with nurse right away.
---
Why?
---
Cuz probably ur rank is 20 and you will get matched with ppl rank 20, so its going to be easier for you to practice.
---
Lmao she’s just a very thicc cave woman
---
This is where im at now. I really enjoy seeing several gens pop in one chase. Makes me feel im finally helping the team.
---
Endgame collapse
---
RIP ma dude
---
You're not wrong
---
So worth it, dude
---
She's difficult to learn and difficult to master. However when you do master her you can get 3s and 4s relatively easily if you play on any map that isn't the Japan map or corn map.
---
yeah ok how many times do we have to see this meme
---
You would’ve pipped if you had sacrificed them on a hook instead of killing them
---
Seems like a appropriate response
---
If we were smart we’d disconnect faster than laganja can hit a death drop, but I’m up for the challenge haha
---
Mori'ing/Killing the survivor \[via perks\] instead of being sacrificed on hook gives a lot less points, from what I hear.
---
I remember this episode vaguely due to that memorable line lol I need to find some episodes to watch over on YouTube somewhere
---
you're a simple man
---
you see jojo you click the arrow ^^
---
Nah im 20 and getting matched with alot of people around 10 or so, only 3 matches in, lol
---
I use w.o.o. :(
---
I think it's on hulu if you have it!
---
I use botany knowledge :(
---
Don't have none of them subscriptions of the sort but I'm sure I'l find it eventually
---
To me nurse is balanced, due to the fact that its still has to good killer skills. You cant just pick nurse and be good. Dead zones, fatigue, and depending on the map. I will say though if its an its one of those nurses...like ardetha you cant do anything.
---
Leather face for BBQ and Chili is first killer DLC (in fact when the switch version comes out it’ll be my first killer to level up for this reason alone). 
---
Now are you on console or PC? Cause they have different DLCs. 
---
Another recommendation is Clown for Pop Goes The Weasel.
---
Dont base your opinions on what other people think, in reality T-bagging is the same as a killer nodding their head quickly its a bit of playfulness and honestly if I get rekt as killer and get T-bagged, i know id probably do the same, in the game its survivor vs killer so i cant blame the survivors especially cause its not like they can just say fuck you until the games over then it doesnt matter anyway
---
The only thing Jane does is give you a boner but if you play Quentin your dick automatically grows an extra 15 inches
---
why? also how would you even rework and or nerf it? I would change the rarity to Ultra rare to perhaps limit the amount someone gets
---
Just give us unranked you cowards
---
That only happens during the offering burning part. Other than that, sounds like henry the hoover.
---
Yep, dbd with cabin in the woods theme would be great. With all the monsters that come out in the end.
---
do people really think the blink add ons are op? anytime i do more than 2 blinks i never enjoy it because the blinks arw piss poor short and the fatigue is way to long
---
I did send an apology for being douchy but I couldn’t stop laughing
---
I think they implied that nurse and wraith has a polyamorus relationship in which huntress is a part of as well
---
I almost never dc, but when I do, it's because I'm against 4 immersive survivors.
---
I don’t see the issue.  You used a splinter to play Freddy.  What’s your point?
---
Yes, your a troll
---
nah easy pallet drop when you bing bong to 99% then let them fling it down then free pallet destroyed while cloaked so you can reach them faster
---
Yes you are in the vast minority there man.  Additional blinks give the most powerful killer with exceedingly little counterplay to many extra chances.  Even the worst nurse players with enough blinks will get you down.
---
The fuck happened here?
---
*Insert comment about this meme being underrated or underappreciated here*
---
I watched my friend start it immediately and he still went down, but since you're snarky about it here let me explain things further. Snapping out of it takes 12 seconds, time to mend from BT ranks are 10/15/20 seconds. I'm assuming it was a rank 1 BT save, so because 12 seconds is 2 seconds longer than 10 seconds, it's impossible to snap out of it in time from a rank 1 BT. Even rank 2 is pretty unforgiving only giving you \*really\* a 2 second window to start the snap, because the transition from finishing the snap to starting the mend is about 1 second. My point is this shouldn't be the case regardless, as it's unfair to the survivor. There's plenty of things in this game that are bullshit but can always be avoided by playing better. You can't outplay a 12 second snap vs a 10 second mend, unless you stay close to the killer, but then you're just gunna get smacked again anyway.
---
Savvy?
---
How annoying.
---
Pretty much everytime that happens it spikes in the lobby
---
I mean if you took the right route you shouldn't have a problem. Or you could do like me and go straight to The Catacombs and get trapped in Tomb of the Giants for a week.
---
Shh, let the non-Wraith players underestimate the power of his ability in a chase..
---
Ugh. Had a similar call. Clown's map, against a Hag as Nea. Was the second to last person alive and got slugged, but I knew where the hatch was. While Ms. Sherwood hobbled her way across the map to find my doppelganger, I crawled from somewhere inside of the building to where the hatch was \[on some side of the building inside of a jungle gym\]. As it opened, I hear my friend nearly screaming in my ear, "jumpjumpjumpjumpjump!", and as I hop in, I see Hag's red stain pop up right behind me. \[This was before I knew that they could no longer grab you out of jumping in, too.\]
---
Tbh I think they should remove the prayer beads, add Akuma from Street Fighter as a killer and give them to him
---
That's the point of the snap though, to override other actions. So what you're saying is that you're mad at the killer for using his power effectively.
---
Also basically has to start applying some sort of pressure very quickly by downing someone and hooking them, and then making sure that you're on another Survivor by the time that one gets unhooked.  Have to pretty much be constantly proactive and can't slouch off in comparison to a game against newbie/nooby Survivors where I can basically sit back and give them gens for free if I don't want to dominate the match too hard.
---
Prayer Beads is the most overpowered addon because there is no counterplay for it in any sense. Have you ever played with a Spirit with fullhex perks build and prayer beads?
---
I would just nerf it by removing the grab possibility 1 seconds after the reappearing.
---
But is in ps4
---
I feel like most players know but can't take the risk that the wraith may fully uncloak and get a free hit so it's decent mind games
---
Did you pick up Jane or something?
---
Everyone needs to see this.
---
Spirit still interacts with the environment while phasing. You just have to be aware of grass moving and crows.
---
For whatever reason it only happens to me on the start menu. The longer I leave it, the closer that bomb sounds like it’s going to go off, no other game does it either.
---
i remember when i first started playing i actually did pretty well sometimes bc i had no idea what i was doing so the killers were sometimes thrown off by me being an ignorant and doing weird things
---
Retuuuuurrnnn the slaaaaaaabbb
---
Oh thank God for that last bit, I didn’t know that either!
---
Even if it was just an option I think I would have more fun as survivor.
---
Same lol you can tell people in a party are playing cause you instantly hear their PS4 going ham with those little fans
---
Another delightful repost from about a week or 2 ago!
---
Can't remember the name but it is one of jeffs perks that lets people you unhook and people who unhook you to see each other. It might also work with healing but I can't remember.
---
My steam name is currently "...jUsT a LiTtLe BiT" lmao
---
idk seems kinda gay to me 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytC5lro5LNA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytC5lro5LNA)
---
Definitely a form of toxic to me. Only ever seems to be either trying to gloat or goad so id say it pretty much is. 99% of the time if someone is doing some pallet or endgame tbaging they’ll have something salty in the chat too. Even without the post salt its just goading or gloating mostly.
---
I know... my game looks terrible (sorry I have a potato atm and I need 60fps)
---
So dumb to tbag like this 😂
---
the ship sails on I suppose
---
hey it's the entitie's fault. I suppose she might have an addon though

---
no she's just masochistic
---
i quitted and i m happy now.
---
I've been using Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quite, and Windows of Opportunity/Resilience and it's so good, even killers who are really good at tracking loose you. Especially on maps like Lery's or the Game too.
---
Nothing about that seems toxic except the messages. They just used their items and add-ons to the best of their abilities. No different from a killer using pink add-ons or moris
---
Weird because I’m the ghost face in the picture after 2 survivors kept pointing at me to look through it so they could take a screenshot, then I asked for them to send me it in the post game chat
---
Damnit Kris!
---
It was funny though to me obviously I won’t do it again I know that it was douche but you don’t have to look into things too much
---
I’m a rank 6 killer and was running mori momento, still got played like no tomorrow.
---
Yep! I've heard stories of them stomping it shut and stopping the animation, but I think you have to just be starting to jump in for that to happen. Either way, GG! lol
---
And when we lose as a killer it says entity displeased, because you’re upset that you lost!
---
Yeah I'm definitely not asking for it to be the standard mode. Just a for fun mode/option.
---
Please explain how Claudette walking up to make sure Kate didn't get picked up by trying to blind the killer is toxic, if anything, feels bad Claudette for trying to be there for her teammate and getting slapped with NOED
---
Should we tell him?
---
Dam that sucks, shouldn’t I also be rewarded for playing devour hope well?
---
That's a 10/10 description of the killer role.  
---
Atleast in purp/red ranks.
---
Why is Gjostface higher than myers
---
I mean a larger FOV is obviously an upgrade, and Ghostface can probably use it better than any other killer. But that still doesn't mean that it's a good perk. The problem with Shadowborn is that it makes the game feel better to play, but doesn't actually give you anything that helps you win the match. It's basically just a QOL improvement in the form of a perk. I'm not sure one can label it as "good" or "bad". Whether or not it's worth using competly comes down how much you value what it does give you. No one can tell you that.
---
Yeah, it's now just a mandatory perk for high ranks and potential SWF since communication and cooperation is strong in DbD. You physically can't do your own perk build as killer at high ranks and even have a slim chance of winning unless you're playing a "viable" killer, then you just might get one or two sacrifices.
---
I don't get it. Is this supposed to be a joke? Where is the punchline. I'm confused and crying in the club help.
---
then they have the audacity to be all ‘git gud’ as if their win wasn’t completely circumstantial
---
If you’d like I would be more than happy to post a screenshot of him sending me the pic on steam after our game!
---
just play legion and make them dc
---
Hate to be that guy but you're playing Claudette.
---
Legión?
---
nurse is cancer on console unless you were born with the knowledge to wield her power
---
Bruh the balance of this games perks literally sucks all the potential variety out of the game since every player runs the same 5 perks cause their the only viable perks to be used.
---
Perks need some FAT overhauls...
---
Tired of behavior being so fast on nerfing strong perks but taking 2+years or never buffing weak perks.
---
Just the last game I played. The Spirt is fun. And i thought itd be best under shit post.
---
Docter is wayyyy too low
---
Keep doing it
---
Hag is a survivor I guess
---
The people who are saying nurse is balanced probably don’t have enough hours in the game. If you’ve ever faced a master nurse the only thing you can do is hide. There is no counter play against a master nurse because there is no way to defend yourself. Running behind a wall and then running the opposite back out, a good nurse knew your where trying to do that. Get lucky and evade a blink, good nurse will keep that in mind and destroy you. 
---
Yes the nurse takes an immense amount of skill and I don’t want a nerf but I would like there being some way for survivors  to be able to have counter play. It not balanced to have a killer that pretty much a guaranteed 4K in the game.
---
I used to be a jake main back in the very early days of the game. When saboteur was OP, me and my friends would just all break the hooks, and stay away from the basement.
---
Uh huh.
---
switch edition lookin fire
---
Can someone explain what does the totems do? I’m new from old time player btw
---
Yeah directly staring at them is like a dice roll at this point it's insane
---
I see. How would you feel about one that punished survivors if they ran the same track?
---
Like how about..
---
Running while in a chase burns the ground, leaving trails that both the killer and survivor can see. If the survivor runs over that terrain again they will be slowed by x%, if the killer runs over it: the terrain will be cleansed and the survivor will be safe.
---
This makes both players have to think of unique ways to chase to play around it?
---
The world is just one big infinite loading screen.
---
R-r-repost!
---
well here is the thing, if all 4 survivors go to a different gen as soon as the match starts then that means the killer can really only stop 1 gen from being worked on and in the time it takes for that 1 survivor to go down 3 gens will have popped giving a huge advantage to the survivors 
---
that way only 1 needs to work on the last 2 while the rest can distract the killer and keep each other alive 
---
so its better to work on gens alone than with a group
---
discordance just stops  sub optimal gameplay
---
its important to do gens close to the gen you are leaving untouched. i guess those survivors had to learn that from hard way. Lmao
---
Crows and grass are inconsistent. Simply make it so the phasing sound starts much closer
---
My friends used to hate going against me in Kill your friends. After I told them to try her out they instantly told me how good it fell to get a precise blink. If you want to get good with nurse, don’t try to hit a survivor if you don’t think that you’re gonna hit them. It makes your fatigue last longer. I use pocket watch and dark cincture. There’s a better one than dark cincture but I don’t know the name of it. I think it’s called something with wheeze or breath.
---
I have played killer 3-4 times and gotten 4 kills on all but one of the games. Curving around stuff is not skill I agree with the other guy that it's common sense. If you can't catch a survivor you have to be pretty bad. I have experience with survivors I have a level 42 Claudette but those few games I played killer it was child's play.
---
Have my updoot
---
Yasss.
---
i am ruin
---
if you understand the emblem system, you can relatively easily pip with potato teamates. It's not fun but it allows you to climb rank to eventually get better solo teams.
---
The best strategy depends on their method of juking.
---
If they're swinging back and forth, use a close range non lunge swing.
---
If they're circling around you, before you go to swing, stop moving and watch them cut towards you
---
But what about that surv that was hanged and helped me so I have to help him
---
I was today years old when I learned that Leatherface actually used the faces of Survivors

I think people just need to git gud. I have no issue finishing chases as Freddy who has no means of stopping chase early. people need to learn of to mindgame and how to counter loops. Putting in band aids int he form of perks  just make the game stale and boring.
---
Probably spirit because console has worse fps
---
All i see is a cocky survivor who suffered the consequences of being a toxic little shit. He had a chance to escape but he didn’t. And yes he had noed but it’s the survivors fault.
---
They basically do nothing unless a killer has a hex perk. A hex perk can be destroyed by survivors by cleansing a "hex totem", which is just a totem that is lit up (like the one in the picture).
---
I've heard legends of console nurse gods. It may just be myths and rumours though...
---
Ok thanks
---
Hell yeah gotta love the gay
---
What happened here?
---
I do enjoy Spirits Design, just not a huge fan of the ability cooldown. But I can deal with it for her mindgames
---
No those perks are trash
---
I really hope they fix the PlayStation before it takes off

Legit only does that when im on dbd

---
I swear dude lmao
---
Cant ignore it when 10 threads of this shit are suggested everyday
---
I played one, however my team kept force healing each other in her terror radius so she had a huge crutch to lean on with nurse's calling
---
Get the spirit one for haunted ground. You get deliverance with Adam If you do.
---
Ill play a gane with better graphics and has more to load like rdr2 and it doesnt sound like a jet.
---
This is a shit idea. Fuck off
---
same with killing themselves on hook
---
My time has come😂
---
I don’t play on pc or Xbox but it seems like it sucks on every platform.
---
Haha fair enough. Then again, I sometimes literally shave survivors heads without hitting them, the hitboxes are really weird
---
Good job being the resident asshole.
---
You're really doing just a bang up job there.
---
I get slugging to secure the 4K but I had a Freddy running Third Seal slug all 4 of us on our first down. You know how annoying it is to sit there for 3 minutes dying? Now I know that the answers that some people will say is "run Unbreakable" but most of the time I use unbreakable I get picked up immediately and it is a useless perk.
---
I will try to pay more attention to their exact method of juking, thanks
---
This is why killers bring a mori for blendettes
---
I've noticed that this game is a lot more active at night for added *spook*
---
I’d say Spirit. I’m on console and I just absolutely cannot get nurse down because the FPS is just way too low not to mention sensitivity is fucked on console too. Spirit’s power is actually really good and you don’t have to be precise like you do with nurse.
---
Play Pig and trap them or play Plague with Thanatophobia
---
How do you know the sound of a dead hooker ? ( Not FBI here )
---
Tactical nuke, incoming!
---
Yeah totally ive been experiencing this a ton lately on xbox ever since the most recent update its real fun getting hit by people on other ends of the map!
---
I played a game as nurse because I was leveling her for Nurse's and I got clapped. It wasn't even semi competitive. They sit beside pallets and loop points just running around baiting the blink.
---
So you cry everytime you see someone with NOED ? lol pathetic...
---
dont lunge, if you short swing up close its way harder to miss
---
I played her with 3 level 1 perks and shitty add-ons and still got a 4k
---
Yep, she's powerful alright
---
I tried playing her when I was grinding for Nurse’s and had pretty much the exact same experience. I think I legit have only got one kill with her. To be fair though all the nurses on console I’ve come across has had the same experience more or less.
---
She had the chance to go out wtf I bet she was so salty the entire match and then she DC. Why do they play this game if they can't handle the stress? Haha
---
I'd rather play as Freddy and not even have ruin then deal with Nurse versus people with half a brain cell

Ryan Yamaoka? Woudln't it be better Ryu or Ryo? over an American name?

And what about the legion?
---
Frances, Jules, Josephine and Susan, because his father wanted him to be tough.
---
The fact is that it's always only me. Never happened to my friend.
---
There are way more than 5 viable perks. There's just a handful of extremely strong/overpowered perks so people choose to run those. Hell, a bunch of perks shown above are *viable*. Botany is a great perk, Pharmacy is also a better version of self-care (which admittedly is weak). Resilience is great for people like me who don't generally heal themselves. Windows is also a really solid perk.
---
People just want to run the absolute strongest stuff rather than have fun with their builds. If you're a good  survivor you should be able to play fine without running the current red rank meta.
---
It's sometimes hard to find survivors for some weird reason, even though there are tons of active players.
---
How braindead are you? Chainsaw is always instadown. No NOED
---
Sure, but in exchange, you're permanently flashlight blinded /s
---
Okay that's pretty weird. Maybe it's just coincidental if your connection is good.
---
Have you considered leaving them alone?
---
They aren't so bad, considering the limitations of the game itself.
---
Click on your profile and click “add flair” you have to be in this sub Reddit to do it.
---
No my comment is that at high rank there is no defense against her. I never said she needed a nerf so it has nothing to do with someone who completely mastered her deserving no reward. There being a bad nurses has nothing to do with my argument and is irrelevant. I’m not talking about removing the pay off, all I’m saying is there needs to be someway to defend yourself.
---
ooo okie thanks
---
How am I crying? 
---
*Pathetic* of you to assume an opinion is crying!
---
When Brenda discovers it is a skeleton chasing Cindy is the equivalent of survivors discovering the killer is Freddy.
---
I'll try reinstalling the game, see if that would help (even though I know it won't).
---
People confuse perks not being overpowered for being unviable. A handful of the perks in OP are good. I could easily run a build of Resilience, Pharmacy, Botany and Windows. 99 my heal super quick with Pharmacy/Botany, and get the faster vaults/gens with Resilience and finish my heal when the killer is close.
---
Wait how is MoM changing?
---
Well in my group I'm usually the bait/runner so I don't usually make it to the end game
---
Wraith main... 4 game today where I've had near instant DCs from hooks/downs 
---
All SWF .. its pretty frustrating tbh
---
All the time 🤦🏽‍♂️. Or when you’re being chased by the killer for a good while and not one survivor even thinks to work on a gen. Come on now people lol.
---
Ok, thanks! I’ve been playing this game for almost 2 years and everyone I’ve spoken with has said it’s toxic. But your statement helped me out a lot, so thanks!
---
What? If you only know Myers from Dead by Daylight then that's not the fault of the film.
---
Trapper main. I always trap my Ruin. Recently been getting bad spawns but no one expects the Remember Me tokens i get 😏😏
---
Pathetic for you to assume Billy’s chain saw is noed. 
---
Yet shrekt fuck boi
---
It's glitched
---
And this is why I bully killers. I know they do shit like this.
---
I agree with Ace, but... 
---
#MISS ME WITH THAT CLAUDETTE SHIT
---
If he is facecamping  you can easily repair 3 generators
---
Too salty.
---
One day you will beat a nurse and look back at how ignorant you were to how skill works.
---
You can gain skill and make nurse look bad without windows or pallets. I did. I would rather face nurse than spirit.
---
Besides, there will always be killer load outs that should get a 4k 100% and you can't do anything about it. On the flip side you will have easy escapes from simple killers with basic load outs, and call it ez.
---
You just need to practice, and stop DCing. Lol
---
Is this vore?
---
Now lets see whos really under that survivor mask *oh shit youre actually a killer main because no survivor would ever say wp after getting tunneled
---
Joey &amp; Susie all the way
---
If you have completely average skill?
---
I suppose that Billy is the best. He's a killer that you can transfer basically all of your overall game knowledge into (unlike the other two top tiers who both have an incredibly unique play/chase pattern) with a great ability that both applies map pressure and one shots.
---
He's got a fairly low mechanical ceiling unlike Nurse, a much lower prediction ceiling than both Nurse and Spirit, and isn't killed by console like Nurse is.
---
He's just a base killer with a really good power.
---
Look up the definition of "resent" (verb).
---
Cringe
---
I had a match where a player DC’ed, then the hatch spawned on his body, last player couldn’t leave
---
K what are you suppose to do with the knowledge of where the spirit is, still doesn't change the logic of "if she knows where I am, I am dead". 
---
With that stated, you want perks that mess up with the spirit sense of your location like iron will, Sprint burst, diversion, quick and quite, etc...
---
Samination provided my facts

Ohhh.

Kk. Thanks for the explanation. Never realized the difference.

Nah, it's just me who gets disconnected, the game continues without me.
---
Aww thx &lt;3 I'm still a beginner tho, some of the shadows are completely messed up X)
---
I think Spirit may be in this list too. I'm not really sure because I'm still not really experienced...
---
Nurse is unbalanced, With or without add ons, she breaks the core essentials of the game by eliminating survivors only defense that of which is looping. You could break LOS, but that only does so much against Nurses since most of killers are already good at tracking.
---
survivor: camps pallet
---
me: moves foward slightly, now there's3 meters between us instead of 5
---
survivor: drops

me: looks in the general direction of going around it

Lisa always eats all the food and Amanda refuses to put on deodorant

Is that an iPad mini? Omg childhood. 😍
---
This was always my build on PS4, then I switched to pc and have almost nothin, so I decided to switch it up: Alert, Balanced Landing, Vigil, Wake Up. I know it’s not the best build out there, but boy i can’t tell you how many times I survive with Quentin.
---
Just a heads up, many people don't like basement builds, as it is seen as a scummy way to pay, and doesn't revolve around mindgames and chases. Expect some salt whenever you play this, and when you post it to reddit.
---
Still waiting on the optimization that was coming soon 2 years ago
---
Aye if you want i can put monstrous shrine for extra salt
---
I’ve been running a no mither  build to force me to get good at looping cause you’re so freaking loud to the killer lol it’s fun! But it’s not easy at all
---
Literally nobody to blame but themselves.
---
Pahahahahaahahahaha.
---
Imagine legitimately running Thanatophobia...
---
Coming soon to a lightyear near you
---
This... does put a smile on my face.
---
That’s what’s up
---
Mine is whisper quit playing DBD. Clean your nasty shit out.
---
Yeah it really depends on the time of day, your rank and varies for both Survivor and Killer. This afternoon I've been getting in quickly as Survivor (and going against some brutal players as Killers, fucking Ghostface) but waiting forever for matches as Killer.
---
BF 4 does that when you start it up.
---
XD self care allows for flashlights that save allies, and extend loop times.
---
Self care allows for toolboxes which allow faster gen rush and that's always good.
---
Self care also allows for your team mates to focus on doing gens, or completing objectives... rather than healing you and having 3 survivors actively doing generators is SOOO much better than having 2 survivors healing. :/ see the basic ass logic?
---
Self care- saves your allies time and spends that time on 1 extra survivor doing objectives.
---
No self care- stalls the game forcing you to locate and ally (takes time) and then proceed to make them stop what their doing and heal you (also takes time).
---
Without self care everytime you get hit your stalling the game out and halting progression...
---
If you run a med KIT this also works but then you dont have the loop potential a flashlight brings, or the gen repair a toolbox brings... so your losing something important I'm ever situation without self care.
---
I get not everyone is at high tier play and some killers you wont require self care against (cause their bad) but perks arent built so shitty players can make use of them... their built so they are viable in the closest tightest most evenly matched games...and to be the difference between getting killed and escaping...
---
And in a game where time is OF THE ESSENCE!... self care saves quite alot of that.
---
I mean, if it was a 4 man SWF it would average out at 14.5. A bit off, but putting it in perspective doesnt make it as bad
---
I agree but that’s a little harsh

It's literally the opposite

Survivor: Sprint boost with 70/80/100% extra speed for 7 seconds

Killer: 1/2/3% Recover from missed hits

But it's not like I was facing four rank 14.5's, and I still shouldn't have been matched with that average number

Have also had this lol, no clue why

Mighty cocky coming from someone who's only experience in pc's is inserting a graphics card into a pci slot. It must have been real hard.

Please, tell us "console plebs" more about how difficult it is to pay someone to build shit for us or pay a company for a premade PC and then insert cards into a pci express slot. It must be completely fucking fascinating.

There was a rank 2 this time what a surprise match making needs to get fixed

I haven't seen this posted on the sub before and I've been on it for a while. But sorry that a repost ruined your day so much. You must be one of the real fun people in post-game chat!

that must've been a very boring tournament
---
yeah, I'm low rank because I'm just coming back to the game, but wait times are just unbearable on both sides. I got two games in against a ghostface who 4ked and a legion who 3ked and i escaped
---
I got ggez'd earlier today. As a level 1 Shade. When I'm rank 19. And they were rank 6-9-12-15.
---
Fantastic matchmaking, right there.
---
Depends how long you wait in que, the longer you wait, the higher chances you have to get someone offrank from you.
---
Sexy Jane luv her  ;)
---
Literally 1 like minute wait
---
I'm saying it's a bit off. But only be 3 technically. The average of all 4 ranks is 14.5, which rounds to 15.
---
If you're rank 18, and the average is rank 15, it's not actually the worst matchup ever. That's just how SWF is
---
&gt;self-care saves a lot of time 
---
It literally doesn't. All that time healing you could be on a gen. I rarely see good survivors in red rank using self-care. Running Adrenaline is always a smarter play.
---
I'm not even going to bother responding to the rest of your post if you're still unironically using self-care in 2019.
---
I love moments like these. When someone slugs the second to last survivor to try to secure a 4k, it's just so satisfying to get away. Like a plot twist
---
I mean... You want me to take off my left eye and throw it at you to make sure
---
I'd be interestes in joining as a killer. I don't have many friends who play, so if there's a swf team looking for someone, I can fill the position
---
100 times this. It’s a 50/50 whether music plays on PS4
---
I've been feeling this a lot recently. I spend the entire match running the killer then they open the gate and swarm the hook just for me if and when the killer finally gets me on a hook. Feels bad cause I just leave them to die. I just spent the past 10 or so minutes running from the killer. It's someone else's turn.
---
I’d like to thank the Spirit that messaged me after the game and told me that they felt bad my teammates had zero interest in saving me and wished I would have been saved and survived. So, to avenge me, they killed both my other teammates. Thanks man. Hope you get amazing games after that.
---
I take.
---
He's literally delusional. Self-care is barely even meta at red ranks these days. You generally see 4x Adrenalines and people stay injured and on gens.
---
As a survivor who plays fair, I apologize for the toxic ones.
---
I get it if a survivor wants extra points (by healing) but taunting or wasting too much time gives the rest of us a bad name
---
Wraith is kinda unique in his mori as for survivors it's the only "off screen" mori.
---
Leaning stalk &amp; catching them is not possible against people with a brain because you're either too far to catch up before a loop or too close and they hear you so you're forced to standing stalk or m1 killer it

That's funny as hell so it's not just my old 1st Gen PS4 doing it then.

I'm curious if the ps pro does it too?

No, the sale during the Deathgarden free weekend (and perhaps after, if you purchased it recently) came with an extra copy of the game in an attempt to boost its player base.

AFAIK everyone got a free gift copy for a friend.

I expected to receive some kind of negative comment because of the community in this game. There are so many toxic people.
---
Didn't expect that someone keeps a running log of everything that may or may not have been posted in the subreddit and then calls out people for reposting things (for no reason).
---
Sorry, I guess we just don't all have the amount of time that you do in order to track which comical things have been said about this game.

I'd like to see Jane's asscheeks spread apart with her butthole on my face.
---
Don't listen to them bud. Just block them and move on. DBD is filled with toxicity and salty players so don't be discouraged and play how you want!
---
Spirit still moves the grass she walks through and alerts crows. She does leave a trail
---
I still see survivors using mettle of man all the time as killer. Even worse is they use it successfully. Curse you high level survivors!
---
Disconnect the messages. It can be disheartening that some people get so salty when losing that they’re response is to put others down. At the end of the day it’s a game that you enjoy playing and you shouldn’t forget that. I hope you find people that are nicer to you. We do exist. Gg, dude.
---
It's okay. The bad man is dead now.
---
Just ignore them. They’re salty that they lost, so they want to shift the blame onto you.
---
I continue to look forward to seeing what cosmetics they work up for her
---
LOL they deleted the post but it's quoted here. Ouch.
---
you unlock it at level 40 for claudette and after that it's a game of luck. after unlocking it in claudette's bloodweb it can now appear in any other survivors' bloodweb. whether it does is up to how lucky you are
---
*when you actually do use no mither sometimes with tenacity*
---
30 for first perk 35 for second 40 for third.  So you'll have to get them to 40 to unlock all three.
---
Nah, rng unless it's the cornfield map, got it two games in a row, then the game, back to the cornfields :P
---
Huh, I wonder why there was a rank 2 in your match... maybe there was a swf?
---
I am WHEEZING...I love this!
---
You clearly put alot of thought into this haha
---
And Adrenaline. Which is the best perk in the game, but they all have it to emerge from the shadows.
---
I believe you now get stacks for safe unhooks rather than just taking hits. 
---
So people using it as a crutch are mostly butthurt.
---
Recently I got my first gg as a killer main on PS4 and first free hatch give as a survivor. Feels good.
---
This is too damn true
---
r/comedyhomicide
---
Ah. I didn't use it even though i main Ash so i ain't too mad.
---
To add to This, you have a pretty good chance of getting your new perks first because they will be lower rarity at tier 1 so you have a better chance of seeing a tier 1 perk you don't own rather then getting the teir 2 or 3 of a perk. To further increase your chances of getting selfcare you can clear the low rarity perks so that new low rarity perks have a better chance of coming up in the next bloodweb :)
---
try rating the game (i usually do it as 2/5 or 3/5) I've found that after rating a game on a certain map I get that map a little less. I'm not sure if this is just coincidental, but it can't hurt to try it out.
---
glad the perks got fixed. wake up was so freakin broken was getting gens done in like thirty seconds or less if I had other people. not happy with the reveal section being bigger for ghost face I thought he was decent but now it seems like anytime I play ghost face or face one they cant get their stalk off because its too large of a area to break him out of it.
---
I played killer for literally the first time earlier and got a message calling me a tunneling bitch from the first person I killed. Kinda makes me not want to play killer at all though it looks like fun.
---
In that case 99% them, and enter stealth when your in lunge range
---
Not that long haha, I just know those movies well cuz I've watched them way too many times :p
---
No shit, re read the quest you need to do it from leaning you cant stalk while standing
---
the teachable perks right? Cuzz i'm like 22 with her and already have the SelfCure III.
---
I don’t and if I do it’s because there are survivors near the hook.
---
Holy crap I just tried this and it's awesome. Very first game I gave a GF the slip even though he was chasing me and saw me vault into a building in Crotus Prenn. Fun stuff, thanks!
---
Campbells last breath + Ataxic respiration=4 blinks with longer range, I call it Ultima Blink Nurse
---
It’s hard to play DBD, a quiet, attentive game while also listening to the ramones, who aren’t meant to be played at a low volume :(
---
Yeah with her right? So to unlock that perk for the other survivors you need to be higher level
---
When’s the last time you cleaned it out?
---
How lewd
---
DBD has a small history of doing this to my and others consoles, it’s very annoying.
---
I'm supposed to watch every horror movie? Halloween is not a popular movie int he Netherlands.

They have already had a pretty good representation of other ethnicities. The only big one missing is like middle eastern or something. But they could add super obscure ones I guess.

Lol...clearly you need to have the last word; to the point of no longer having any reasonable or logical response and resorting to using only emojis as a pathetic way to retaliate and try to turn the topic away from your negative comments.
---
So go ahead and comment whatever want. I'll not be responding again to further entertain your negativity.
---
This was me. I been getting out of the stealth comfort zone and some killers are super easy to get away from and loop. If it's a good killer though I get hooked so its toal and error I guess.
---
&gt;I'm supposed to watch every horror movie?
---
No. When did I say that? I'm just saying it's not the films fault you only know him from the game and not the film franchise. Also Halloween is one of the most iconic and popular horror icons of all time. Just saying👍
---
If the killer is chasing the wounded guy you can just continue working the gen, doesn't matter if he is 5 meter away from you
---
Even if killers tunnel, with the current time limit, by the time killers get back it going to run out. Decent killers generally just wait out the time limit also. Killers don’t tunnel as much at high ranks.
---
I'm down!
---
I made a meme about this brother Ik your pains
---
&gt;Yeah it started getting louder every second so i quickly closed the game. It was like loud loud u know. Never heard it this loud before
---
That screen causes overhearting in every hardware, even PCs. I am not sure if we can call it "normal" but definitely expected. We would need BHVR to explain the reason why that screen causes temperatures to go higher than gaming even if the hardware is at the same GPU Usage.
---
Some people love to say *"mY tEmPeRaTuRe Is FiNe, ItS yOuR eQuIpMeNt"*. Sure, if your system normally runs at 50ºC while gaming and that screen pushes it to 55ºC it wouldn't be a big deal but the point is, your hardware is running 5ºC hotter for no reason at all. 
---
Depending on local temperature, hardware positioning (inside a shelf with bad air circulation) and even dust levels, some people will experience higher temperature than others and that screen will push it to alarming levels. 
---
I noticed it on my Graphics Card over a year ago, asked a few friends to check if they got the same results on their computers and they confirmed the same behavior.
---
It is underappreciated. I can use pallets and windows to get away. My problem was I was running around and not being able to find anything to use.
---
do you want to be a Captain?
---
Do you know how easy it is to lean there is so much shit regardless of map, trees, rocks, cars Jesus bad players complaining about easy af challenges
---
What's yer offer?
---
Don’t get me wrong. There is some representation, but just because there is one of X race doesn’t mean we can’t have more of that same race. Also just because we have Feng who is a Chinese character, doesn’t mean Japanese or Korean people are represented nor should feel represented because of her presence. Just a thought
---
Used air duster to clean out your fans. Took off the top cover and sprayed out the cooling fan.
---
You aren’t considering the survivor not having brain damage like you seem to have since you can’t fathom what I’m saying
---
I may have a team u can join if u want to join them?
---
What does it entitle? Do I basically choose some other survivors who wanna play in the tournament and practice with them?
---
It's funny to pretend like you can't see them when they're Blair Witching somewhere.
---
I can’t have perfect connection 100% of the time. And it’s a game, “scummy tactics” don’t exist. I don’t try to camp hooks but if all three of the other survivors are at the hook I’m going to stay around there.

No they didn’t go through with the safe unhooks thing, it’s now just protection hits
---
And here I am back, and just as suspected ghostfaces first and third perk are largely awful.
---
If you made this then thank you, the best video i’ve seen in a while!
---
Yeah the captain is the person that is incharge of your team all you are required is the get 4 survivors and 1 killer you can be one of them playing and you have to have a team name
---
&gt;When’s the last time you cleaned it out?
---
Even though cleaning your hardware will help with the temperature a little, it will mask the real issue.
---
Why the hell does that screen cause overheating?
---
Tuck funnelers
---
Yesssss!!! I feel like this game overall has decent representation.  Jane is the best!
---
someone else’s turn to do gens.
---
Ah my bad, does DBD ghodtfaces lore say he dies? If so this GF is the only living one.
---
Aw he looks cute
---
I haven't bought the Pig dlc yet :(
---
This is great!!
---
Remember survivors,  5000 Survival points for leaving when you open the gate is better than those \~300 for healing :)
---
I have thought about a solution.
---
The following:
---
Rework survivor add-ons for items. 
---
Increase node spawn amount in blood web,
---
(more nodes per level so each 50 increase does have more rotation, one could also think of letting three perks spawn instead of only two per level) 
---
Decrease bloodpoint costs for add-ons in blood web. 
---
This way they can use their bloodpoints to get more viable add-ons that fine tweaking items.
---
No need of extra perks.
---
With extra slots sprint burst and DS would be always in slot, mandatory. Then you could also implement it as a basic feauture. Then the second hook should bring you always into struggle.
---
Extra perks are not the way to balance this game.
---
I prefer naked, especially if I'm being chased through the corn fields... may even find me moon walking through them..
---
Oof, that rubber band. Y'know maybe it's cause I don't really care about getting a 4k; but if I'm killer and I see someone whose lag has dicked them over, especially if it meant they escaped, I just let them go.
---
Not sure if I would call it meta, but it was played quite a lot when legion first released
---
Think about how better chases would be though, I guarantee stress for killers would halve.
---
Major respect to Nurse mains on console because that shit is *not* easy. Whenever I play her it's literally laughable
---
And then killers will wonder why there are 4 Claudette’s in their lobby.
---
but i can find u a team if u dont want to own your own
---
My ps4 sounds like a airplane when I start up dbd, doesn't do that with other games.
---
Because I'm gonna hook you wait there for you to attempt to kobe. Then hit you down again after you do so.
---
Maybe it’s the ping
---
Good god the game was so slow back then.
---
So deep omg im crying rn 😭😭
---
Are we gonna just ignore Feng Min?
---
I’m fine with Claudette’s to those are also loud and rely way too much and their ability to blend their also not good in chase oh and they always have dead hard and decisive strike. Which means in can counter them easily.
---
As a nea main, I apologize for any time I bring a killer to you, I don’t run bond or any survivor aura things so if I run to you it’s purely accidental.
---
That being said, I try to avoid running the killer to gens if I can
---
I don’t understand this statement
---
I’m on Xbox and this happens to me sometimes too. No idea why. Really frustrating.
---
Apologies the other message was meant to be a reply
---
E N T I T Y  D I S P L E A S E D
---
Happens to me constantly. It's normal to me at this point
---
You said other cultures and ethnicities well Feng is in there
---
He should have run lmao
---
Take a break and play something else, no game is fun if you play it constantly
---
DID SOMEBODY SAY HEATHEN?!
---
Also audible cheek slapping noises for Jane please if you do add any bikinis. Ty
---
don’t encourage leaving teammates to die, they obviously played well as a team to have 4 people at the endgame
---
yea
---
I really respect the level of thought you put into this, but it’s so loooong. Some really solid ideas for sure though.
---
it gets downvoted cus nobody love asmrthechaw
---
Tbh, that's a top tier mindgame
---
&gt; keep the downvotes coming if you like
---
I didn't downvote you personally. If you were getting downvoted in your first comment that's maybe because you didn't give any reasoning to why you still believe the game is overpowered in favor of survivors. But I'm glad that you did so that I can see where you're coming from.
---
I do agree with you on a couple of things. There are still a few maps that are a bit cheesy for survivors. You mention Rancid Abbatoir like I did. And yeah that loop is quite shitty for killers. But where else can the maps be a problem for killers:
---
Haddonfield? Balanced Landing perhaps. The slaughterhouse loop should be shortened I'm with you there. But maps like Yamaoka, both from the Swamp, Shelter Woods, and many more don't have unbalanced pallet spawns or loops. In fact some of them have dead zones in some spots and corners where there isn't even anything there. The Wretched Shop on Autohaven too? Yeah that loop is still rough. Oh and Rancid Abbatoir like we said. Those are arguably worse than Thompson House itself. But I'm cherry picking maps here. The rest of them do not have such a problem with loops or pallet spawns as they did before. Autohaven maps do to an extent, but if you loop the pallets properly it's not too big of a deal.
---
And about the 2nd chance perks. These perks can pretty much be avoided except in situational moments. Like Unbreakable. The only time Unbreakable is a problem is when you got two survivors left, you down one of them and search for the other to try and get a 4K. Borrowed Time? You know that when survivors go and unhook in your face they obviously have BT. You hit them in time, they're often not going to escape unless they're 5 meters from the exit gate. Decisive? It follows a bit from that same logic. Go for the unhooker and these two perks will rarely affect you nowadays. Adrenaline can be annoying, but again it's a situational perk that only activates in the end-game.
---
Now if we talk about SWF then all of this that I said goes out the window, simply because they have voice comms, and know where and how to waste the killer's time. But like I said, a 4 man SWF on voice communication who wipes the floor with you does not always mean that the game is unbalanced. They're using a mechanic that was not meant to be in the game in the first place. And that's a problem exclusive to SWF, that very rarely happens at any other time, anywhere else.
---
Marth and his group have thousands of combined hours in DBD. They are pretty much the outlier of the community where players are some of the best experts and have everything from the game memorized. Also that experiment was more than a year ago. Many things have changed since then and BHVR have made the appropriate nerfs to those issues.
---
&gt; I dont know man, you tell me, does an almost 100% win rate sound like a balanced game to you?
---
Of course not. But you're acting like everyone who plays survivor, yes even at red ranks, will make not one mistake whatsoever and do everything perfectly, and that is just unrealistic. Not everyone is going to be a professional gamer, and even the best will make mistakes. That's not to say you can still get bullshit matches that end in 5 minutes, but these types of games do not happen nearly as much as they used to.  Are tweaks still needed? Of course, especially on certain maps and most of the survivor and killer perks in order to expand the meta. But I've been playing this game passionately since its early days in early 2017, and killers do not even have it HALF as bad as they used to.
---
sup joyseph
---
Yes! I'm sure he gives great foot massages!
---
That's Arizona though, I dont know how you guys do it out there.
---
Upvoted. Because I’m curious. Are you saying survivors are OP? Or...
---
I think it’s German
---
I'm all for saving your team mates, but sometimes self-preservation has to kick in though, their greed killed them, both gates were already open and not one person had left, and no one was hooked or down besides Adam in the clip, evidenced by the blood warden proc, and they stayed in the match until that little amount of end game time left. 
---
That outcome entirely their fault through bad decision making alone. As clearly no one was in real danger until Adam was downed/hooked with so little clock time left.  :\\
---
Just be glad you didnt actually have to play against the count that used 3 blink nurse with an ebony mori.
---
Thank you ♡
---
Literally everything a killer does they can expect salt for
---
Its smooth
---
Lol I see. Nice talking to you!
---
Ace is Argentinian.
---
Also what is “latinx”
---
Isn’t Latino the default term?
---
They should allow dance emotes for maximum troll factor
---
Edgy
---
I’m pretty sure I’ve seen the same exact video before on this subreddit.  Did you delete it and repost it? No hate I’m just curious
---
You cant run away either.
---
They still had half the timer left, and the reason they died was because a good decision on the killer’s part to bring blood warden and not down anyone.
---
yes
---
Not happily, I’ll tell you that.
---
That's a bit of a stretch
---
Yeah I got that but why is the brutal killer message overlayed in game
---
Just make your camera face him but make sure ghistface is near the middle of the screen once you hear the sound just stay that way for a second. But if he keeps on moving get out of his line sight and lead him somewhere more open.  
---
Work's for me most of the time
---
What about Feng
---
There’s no secret in keeping an interest in something, it just comes naturally. If you enjoy something you’ll keep playing if not you stop or slow down. But if you want some quick fun I’d suggest deranking a little bit (not to rank 16 because come new players but I mean like rank 10) and just try meme builds or stuff like that. But the players with 7k hours are players who just have a natural interest without needing any external or a method to keep the game interesting for them.
---
What’s your button layout? R1 for Dead hard and X for pallets seems pretty nice!!
---
THIS.
---
The annoying problem is that killers have a meta perk that literally doubles BP gain on an average strong game, whereas survivors have to give up a perk slot entirely for the same chance.
---
[Observe](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c5woy8/this_is_it_i_will_never_top_this_escape_and_ive/?st=jxjjma7j&amp;sh=90cc3a69)
---
Anyways in terms of wasting time that's not alot. Attempting a Kobe takes a tiny amount of time and struggle state only lasts 60 seconds. Survivor gets survival BP, Killer gets time to go close the hatch, break pallets and kick gens, open an exit gate door, spam their ability etc.
---
latino is a male. latina is female. latinx refers to both. i believe
---
this is not it
---
I got her using spirits power but she dced after lmao
---
Shhhh, don’t make fun of the poor kid.
---
I've never met a more wretched hive of scum and villainy like I have with dbd killers.
---
Botany in the trash? Self-care belongs there.
---
I don't know I figured he'd be able to swing his chainsaw normally plus being able to charge at you with his saw i think it would be a one hit kill
---
READY UP DWIGHT!
---
WAAAHH
---
In terms of points considering how long killer queues are I'm glad for every drop of bloodpoints I can get. Sometimes a few hundred BP is the difference from getting the last node to go to the next bloodweb or not. 
---
I still don't like the insta-death thing. Maybe have the game auto-attempt escape if it's your first hook so you can possibly Kobe or just Deliverance off the hook, but once you hit struggle state or if you were second-hooked simply autosacrifice.
---
Nice job Detective SomeClaudetteMain :D 
---
I didn't figure out the body blocking because I didn't see any scratches, but it looks like Adam used Deliverance to get himself off the hook. 
---
Looks like situation B is closest to the answer!
---
Is this decently known ?
---
And its through this that people decide the only way to play is swf, then killers get upset that it unbalances the game etcand the cycle gets worse.
---
Rank reset needs to go. I have like 1k hours on the game. Its no fun for me being with noobs, and its no fun for the killers if I loop them for ages. We shouldnt be put together at all. Let new players play with new players and experienced players play with experienced players.
---
Perk wheel
---
That is strange, from my experience most killers at that rank are generally good enough they don’t have to do that
---
Thats what I’ve said for a long time. It feels like a grind. Every month after reset you have to grind your way up the ranks just to get to a rank where the game feels enjoyable. It shouldnt be like that. The game should not feel like work.
---
They need to fix ranking and increase tips/tutorials for new players.
---
My go to move that works a VAST majority of time if I know they’re going to juke when running, is to back up a step when they start to juke, move back up a step,  then tap swing. Do not lunge into them.  Most of these jukes are them burrowing themselves up against you, expecting you to lunge right on by them.
---
&gt; Susie’s a trap
---
Hey man, you really shouldn't be calling people "traps." The term reflects and reenforces the (obviously false) belief that trans women transition to trick straight men into being gay.
---
The men who are caught murdering trans women often cite that they were provoked into murdering because they were decieved. Calling people traps spreads the same toxic mentality that murderers use as justification.
---
[This person put much more time and effort into the subject than I did, and is far more entertaining with her explainations than I am.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzhqJK3bg)
---
IS.
---
Idk.
---
Attention. He wants that.
---
but basement builds are way way higher up on the list than most things that the killer does.
---
IT.
---
well ig latinx is a newer term used to describe anyone under hispanic descent
---
I love how survivors insta quit the game when the offering is a secret, but we killers have to deal with instaheals and rushing toolboxes :)
---
small game is a good perk tbh, it counters noed(which every fucker runs nowadays) and ruin , and some other perks too
---
You really not going to credit the artist that did this?
---
It’s a bit different. I can’t stand it as a survivor. I might even hate it more as a killer because, in my mind, how useless and rapidly it becomes broken. 
---
I’ll tell you what though, it’s always in any damn match. Survivor or killer...
---
It's trapper just bed of chaos
---
QnQ, dance with me and lithe is god tier on any indoor map, and still fun asf on most maps
---
You fucking have better given him *finger guns*.
---
" Claudette is Chinese. " - I believe you mean Feng.
---
As another person said, Kate was clearly already safe, she just wanted one more cheeky flashlight blind before she left. As well, DCing is a common thing that toxic survivors do.
---
Super cute!
---
Good catch.
---
Is this sunken valley or brume tower?
---
Grow thicker skin?
---
&gt;  I might even hate it more as a killer because, in my mind, how useless and rapidly it becomes broken.
---
Yeah I actually dislike it as a killer to. But more so for the reason being that its so powerful yet so random at the same time. it also leave a bad after taste in that you know that a lot of bad killers get boosted by it when the perk actually manages to work. 
---
There is no middle ground with the perk. Which is why I've been enjoying playing the Pig a lot recently. Being able to get something that's somewhat of a soft ruin in your base kit is nice.
---
Not with a slice of pizza in his mouth.
---
This clip is fucking beautiful, but why in God's name would she DC? I know it's probably out of salt, but the game was already over, if she just let herself get hooked, she wouldn't have just thrown away a while game's worth of BP. I really just don't understand the logic of toxic players.
---
Not all... just the mass majority of them... personally I don’t think the fog traveler one is bad
---
Lol I body blocked for someone and then I ran into the basement because I’m not very smart. Trapper proceeded to camp me until I died lol.
---
Considering the things I've seen on this Reddit and the subreddit, I can confidently say most players don't see the difference
---
I know a lot of people hate it, but it'd pay for it. DbD is pretty much the only game I play and I love the grind. Right now I feel like they need to add something other than new killers/survivors to make the game less stale
---
Yeah, after I took it I felt really bad... But In the moment my anxiety kicked in and I thought it would be really weird to ask a complete stranger for a photo
---
Ive never actually cleaned my ps4 😂
---
Should have escaped with DS
---
Thx!
---
But how... its weird
---
ah, okay.
---
if id have had a key id have gone for that but no doubt he would have closed the hatch before picking me up
---
Me, but with anyone because I don't care about peoples feelings.
---
I don't get why running perks to kill easier is a crime against humanity but survivors running decisive, dead hard, MoM, toolboxes etc is all fine.
---
Same, only game i have it with is dbd
---
This honestly really needs to get fixed.
---
Teabagging is normal you'll have to deal with that.  Salty banter? Deal with it. You can't just go reporting someone for saltiness. 
---
Deal with it.
---
Legend has it their games remain uninstalled to this day.
---
Good job, Deputy foamyism.
---
We’ve done good today.
---
It’s odd, I usually only put it on in red or purple ranks in order to waste just a bit of time to hopefully get a snowball effect going.  The odd times it does its job there, it’s glorious, but I agree with you, it’s totally unreliable. I’ve always loved PGtW and have found it to be a much better gen slowing perk. I can’t count how many times this perk alone has swung momentum back towards killer.
---
The biggest puta in the game.
---
&gt;Even dumber
---
I'm not gonna worry about buying any killers just yet ;P, just bought the game for fun more than competition, but I'll probably buy killers if i like the game enough ;3, thank you for the advice though, nurse's calling and BBQ are on my radar
---
Omg... I was scared for a sec -- I should have recognized it LMAO.
---
this feels like an old rage comic.
---
Thanks for the answer, I’ve toyed with deranking a bit before but it has always just been to play with friends, I’ve never derailed to play solo, I’ll try it out.
---
The ability is trash because if you're even remotely good at the game, you can hit the person as they go through the window anyway. Also, what would the ability's range be? If it's too short, then it's pointless. If it's too long, then it would be as unfair as Nurse's ability, but it requires no skill and goes off automatically when a survivor goes through a window.
---
Yes, very pretty
---
https://youtu.be/LnIkJLYCH_k check out that video with Tru3 :) it's a good example of why the plague may feel a little weak and why I personally am not a huge fan after trying her myself. Not saying every game is a red rank game, and this game is meant to be fun, so you can still have fun with her, but it may help you make a decision!
---
Killer's M1 will put the Survivor into Dying from Healthy (Exposed does not override the effects of Endurance)
---
Mmk
---
One hit into the dying state. Pretty much like Evil Within III (Myers' power), but on just a single survivor.
---
Instadown
---
For sure. Just a heads up if you didn't already know, you earn "shards" after matches that you can use to purchase the non-licensed killers like Legion, Spirit, and The Clown. It builds up slowly but you won't need to spend real money on getting them, just play a lot. I didn't figure that out for like after a year of playing lol. But anyways good luck and I hope you have fun!
---
You should have included those specific horrible things said in the original post provably to avoid responses like above.  If they were just saying like "fuck you cocksucker" or something then sure who cares but once it gets to racism and telling people to kill themselves that crosses a massive line.
---
Ah thx
---
Yeah but ur reaction to Survivior vs killer should be intensely different. Gambling on crows has never been that consistent
---
Snorted at the poof of confetti as everyone started to DC.
---
Damn he might be the hardest killer I've played
---
Definitely high up there for a record fastest game lmao nice chainsaw snipe
---
THE APOCALYPSE.
