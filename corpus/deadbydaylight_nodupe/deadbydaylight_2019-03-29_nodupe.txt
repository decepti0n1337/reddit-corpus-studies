---
I'm gonna be brave and say it: I want a Claudette nendoroid 
---
Do Leatherface. I wanna see someone go fucking apeshit because their chainsaw touched a wall. 
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for a lobby for 30 minutes. Turned it off I‚Äôll go play something else and check back tomorrow 
---
I don't hate Claudette.... when I'm playing. In my experience, all the other Claudette's I play with are absolute potatoes.
---
Hey it's me
---
next killer confirmed: The Hoax
---
Maybe not but regardless it's getting old really fast. Plus it would be great practice for killers to change out from it every other game. 
---
Yeah seriously, anyone know why the fuck this is a thing now? Why did they change aura appearances?
---
Some rank in the middle, idk, 20 minute wait time as a killer (since i gave up on survivor), finally find a match, i freeze on loading screen.
---

---
I cut BHVR a lot of slack since i know this business isn't easy. But what the goddamn fuck BHVR.
---
You don't have to quit the game, the game eventually loads or automatically disconnects to the the match result screen and this usually occurs when someone disconnects during the loading screen.
---
What outfit is that?
---
I know, I was just being a smartass. Honestly, it doesn‚Äôt look as bad as I thought it would. Better than strode imo
---
Maybe because, I don't know, it's a game with slightly weird graphics?

I‚Äôm going to be getting some pics tomorrow 
---
Masterful throw.
---
The killer will always find you eventually. Just do the gen. Two ppl can getthrough a ruin gen faster than 1.
---
Unless you are a killer with increased movement speed (more than 115%) for map presence such as Billy and Nurse, you absolutely do need SOME perk that slows objectives. Be it Pop Goes The Weasel, Corrupt Intervention, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, or what have you. 
---
Not for the animation but for reply the face. For the face used motion capture?
---
Plus never moonwalk, I stopped doing that almost immediately because of how bm and broken it is

I want a genuine explanation as to how you find playing Legion enjoyable. I am willing to hear you out. 
---
Sorry i took so long to comment on your amazing work, (internet troubles) i look forward to your posts every weekend, and hope you continue to work on these. If you ever need help thinking of ideas for killers just ask. I wish you the best of luck on your next post.
---
Ayyy You chill
---
Lmao I know you didn‚Äôt actually look through most of my comments then because literally all of them except the ones from this thread are in the positive. Ironic you‚Äôd prattle in about easy to disprove things. 
---
DS isn't luck. It's skill. However, when you get hit with DS, do you let them go if they are the only survivor around? 4%ing is similar to (the new) DS. Except you as a killer don't get stunned. So why let them get a head start when they have a perk that is meant to do the exact same thing? (DS is great with deliverance for this exact reason.)
---
Overwatch makes tons of money elsewhere though, through merchandise, comic books, etc. DBD doesn‚Äôt have that kind of market. 
---
No U
---
Great. So now I'll get to see Ash after Ash after Ash DC constantly instead of other skins. Yay.
---
It's not okay that I be condescending, but it is okay to want someone to burn in Hell solely because you don't like them? Lmao
---
Think it's pretty obvious who the one with problems really is here. 
---
No. Half the time it works everytime!
---
Why no Spirit then? Too supernatural?
---
There gonna be a killer along with him? A deadite maybe?
---
Dbd have a skin market, recent I agree, but can replace dlc costs.
---
I‚Äôm a little confused lol
---
Why would you sound like a dick? 
---
I never said where his hand was from?
---
I‚Äôm really confused haha 
---
Considering the original setup was 4 survivors to 3 killers, there's gonna be more survivors perks no matter what. That's kind of how the game has always been.
---
I really doubt it, because nothing on the sweatshirt is even remotely related to DbD.
---
Your friend, incoming to stop you from when you're about to do something dumb.
---
i did have a good day, thank you for your kind response!
---
Susie is best though so
---
Whenever someone says, "Play a real game. Play Friday the 13th." I die laughing. Lol let me play a dead game with a 24 hour peak of 430 players and no new content for the rest of existence. ok bud. Give it a few more years. The servers  might be shut down 
---
The thing is that the newest character will (almost always) be the one with the least amount of players because not enough people have had time to level them up and unlock all of their perks. Even if you save up 1,000,000 BP, that's not enough to hit prestige 1
---
Would you rather wait 30 minutes, or play the game? 
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôm just gonna wait till everything gets fixed and settled with matchmaking, theres other games for a reason lol
---
(Spoiler for an almost ten year old horror movie on a subreddit devoted to a game based on horror movies?) He came right back after we think he's dead, so I'd hardly call him a pushover. 
---
I avoid playing licensed survivors bc they don't get cosmetics but hopefully his perks aren't trash.
---
You‚Äôre already rank one, why do you need to pip
---
Groovy
---
LMFAOO that‚Äôs how it went really
---
There are people that browse this subreddit that don't even know Bill is in this game on account of being console players idk.
---
Its more for style anyways.
---
I usually run Overcharge as a stalling perk but it doesnt work very well since Survivors do gens so fast. 
---
Replace "Salty survivors" with "Almost all survivors" and "Legion" with "Freddy, despite being terrible with him", and that's been my experience. 
---
People get weirdly mad about winning against Freddy (if they don't DC right after hearing the lullaby). I mean, I'm learning the killer, they're getting escapes, we're both getting BP, what's the problem?
---
Lesser? Huntress requires WAY more accuracy than Plague. With Plague you can literally just spray and pray, and chances are you‚Äôll hit them. 
---
I was worried you already knew that and I was correcting you for no reason 
---
What? Like seriously the fuck? How does Freddy being immortal make him any more lethal? He was still defeated. Myers has to get shot like 8 times. He‚Äôs a living breathing human. Myers would have killed so many more people if it weren‚Äôt for Laurie accidentally setting up the perfect ambush for Loomis to finish the job. Anyways in this fight/tournament/brawl Freddy is mortal and Myers uses the 2018 storyline so he isn‚Äôt immortal with the bullshit Thorn Cult.
---
Same thing anybody does when they want a perk they don't have, grind for it. 
---
Thats alright, but most will just wait for you to chase em out
---
I need the free pressure, i am incompetent
---
TIL that Hillbilly is just what would happen if Deadite Ash never turned back into a human
---
ayy i have every perk (including jane's) on quentin too. glad to see someone else appreciating my tired boy. 
---
Money, mostly. 
---
I like that idea - instead of hairstyles, or by attaching new hair to the body slots, let us use the third slot for some unique cosmetics.
---
I have two reasons to not play spirit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
1. I don't have spirit and don't want to spend money or shards to get them
---
2. I didn't enjoy phase-shift in Titanfall and its ability is quite similar
---
Those are my reasons.
---
Don't feel bad, l think Ash is replacing most survivors
---
I haven‚Äôt had trouble all day. 3-5 mins max. 
---
Two rank 2 killers in a row. We've angered the entity
---
Exactly. The issues are tolerable if they're standalone. But they're not. They all consistently happen every time I try to play the game.
---
I see no problem
---
Ash returned to fight the deadites ever time to save the world bill tries to escape zombies and I am not saying he isn't a badass because anyone that is willing to do what he did in l4d2 for the sake of others is but in the end his goal wasn't to fight and beat the zombies it was to run from them and reach safety
---
Fuck the legion! They all trash tunneling, campers on PS4! Had 4 of them tonight and they all tunneled &amp; camped! any legions lately have all done the same thing! I don‚Äôt care how many down votes this gets, the legion is the worst killer in the whole game and the people who play him are worse and there are many more of us who agree this than who play him! If they all didn‚Äôt tunnel and camp I wouldn‚Äôt have such a negative opinion about them but I‚Äôm done! 
---
The delayed filing after the lobby is created probably has to do with half of the playerbase being on a different system. 
---
The way it was when everyone was on it would mean your lobby filled in less than 30 seconds after the lobby actually created. The timer was fairly accurate as to how long you'd wait (for me, at least).
---
I couldn't be bothered writing a big wall of text this time. If you wanna maturely discuss any placements, go ahead, we can respectfully debate and have good times.
---
Plague perks weren't on here, but Corrupt Intervention is high A, Infectious Fright is mid A, Dark Devotion is mid C.
---
Rudy pants not all are bad
---
What? Did you really read my post? ALL the killers are immortal. How the fuck would a Babylonian Priestess even *be* here? You wanna know who else is immortal? Myers. In Myers canon he is a bastard child from the Thorn Cult making him immortal. What kind of fight would this be if 2 killers were immortal? The Who would win thing ALWAYS implies nobody is immortal. 
---
They gave bhvr the rights to Bill for free, iirc
---
I've got the sound files for Bill from DbD, it's not the same, none of his "voice" lines are reused from Jim French's voice work as Bill in L4D, it's just a similar scream. 
---
Yes, you are the only one who saw S-Mart Ash out in Daylight 
---
Overall perk tier lists don't really work bc some perks are godly on certain killers but trash on others. For example, Monitor is really good on Hag and Myers but its meh on Doctor
---
Or make do without it and practice using other perks?
---
Glad to see Chuck Finley in the game
---
not a problem, since not every survivor perk is used, like come on, who uses slippery meat? \*gets into match with someone with slippery meat, small game, lithe, no mither\* \*dies on hook\*
---
Why are dying light and overcharge low tier for you? I don‚Äôt play killer often, but I‚Äôm trying to level up my stuff so I don‚Äôt wanna focus on useless perks. I kinda understand overcharge but dying light? :0
---
Honestly I do agree but wanted to try anyway. That's why perks that are effective in most situations rather than just one or two killers are placed generally higher.
---
I‚Äôve come across a very slim few who actually were good and didn‚Äôt tunnel or camp but that‚Äôs maybe 4-6 since he was released, the rest all camped and tunneled, especially the past few weeks, they all have done it! Don‚Äôt know how it is on PC but on PS4 the camping from the legion down has been horrible! I‚Äôm a rank 8 and keep getting lumped in with rank 15-18 killers then throw on party streamers and I get a rank 2 killer when the other random solo survivors were all rank 8-9‚Äôs fuck BhVR!
---
Worth it, sure. Mandatory? No.
---
A+!!! 
---
Your issue seems more to do with solo survivors than Ruin (like most things survivors seem to complain about these days).
---
On account of the fact that you don't like this specific perk...? Like we already established, you can call anything in the game a crutch. 
---
uh but where's the link to buy them? preorder them? get them? pls?
---
Nah, it's straight up stupid to put it at the window.  Around shack, yeah, but not at the window.
---
Hey wait
---
Dying Light first of all inspires a very heavy tunnelling playstyle. As killer, tunnelling a single survivor hard is often just a detriment and you get better payoff spreading pressure around. It's only worth running alongside a Mori but even then the new DS can completely remove that work.
---
Overcharge is only good on Doctor due to madness. On other killers it's simply an easy skillcheck to land that'll only catch out survivors once, if that. 
---
Believe it or not 70% of the time those are survivors who cannot actually run you. They fall for simple mind games and drop like a sack of flour after ten seconds of chase. 
---
I know ruin gets memed on for being cleansed so quickly very fast but I don't agree with this placement. If it wasn't an S tier perk you wouldn't see it in 90% of games. I could discuss why it's so good but you already know so I'm mostly interested in hearing your perspective of it's placement.

He also carried it during Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, but just because he used it where he came from doesn't mean it's likely to be used here, especially since they almost never bring in actual new items for survivors (last one was either firecrackers or Halloween Flashlight/Lunchbox depending on how you view it)
---
Good to know... thx
---
atleast he still got his signature chin
---
Shame.
---
Looks fair and balanced to me! ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve done a good job so far‚Äù 
---
they fear being broken aka being one hit but just play safer and you should be fine
---
its getting a 2 pip with the 3 perks
---
i came
---
I play with deliverance on and even if say I‚Äôm first downed I never dc or if I‚Äôm playing killer and everyone brings a flashlight or toolbox I don‚Äôt dc
---
We need more of these
---
So many survivor perks are just shit and useless though, so who really cares?
---
That's why Ruin hurts survivors at lower ranks but quickly drops off when they understand how to deal with the perk. Even with the progress that Ruin is supposed to slow, the act of simply forcing survivors to do anything that isn't generators does more to slow the game than Ruin ever will.
---
However, I don't think Ruin is BAD, per se. It's high B Tier after all. I just think it's overrated due to how easy it can be to deal with, and the constant possibility that it could die in thirty seconds and now you're stuck with 3 perks all game. It's at least a big help on killers like Trapper that have to take setup time to get the ball rolling.
---
STOP! My penis can only get so erect.
---
-Your 1st flaw is trying to compare DBD to competitive games.  It. Is. Not.
---
-Imagine if Fortnite suddenly announced "Since Trained Military Snipers find the shooting in the game too easy, it is now 10x harder to shoot someone! Enjoy!!"  That would sure be a popular decision!! You should try sugegsting that to them
---
-A business is best off satisfying the 95% of its paying customers, not the 0.1% percent!
---
-The fact that you even admit you only care about the top few players in the game completely invalidates your entire argument
---
That reminds me of how little it's been used--the fact that you mentioned that it makes them last longer. They changed it... half a year ago? 
---
Either way, it makes the marks spawn closer together. It only makes a difference at Tier 3--at the other two it's fairly negligible. 
---
I see no issue here. This just makes the lobby groovy.
---
idk he just kinda has that conflicted :| face to me
---
Exactly how you'd expect lol just both survivors and killers confused.
---
I find it most useful on killers such as Wraith, Trapper, Doctor etc that dont have a tool to reliably aid them in a chase every time. Though it's at least a decent choice for all, just remember some powers do and don't interact with it and can make it less or more useful as a result.
---
-LOL. You think your talking to a few players &gt;&gt;&gt; data from Tens of Thousands of matches. LOL LOL LOL
---
-The fact that you only care about the Best players in the game completely invalidates your entire argument. Hmmm, should the game be made more enjoyable for 50,000 people or for 20 people.   This is sure a tough choice!!!
---
-Killers ranked up more easily in 2018-2019. I you are admitting they ranked up easier in 2016 then that proves they have always ranked up easier.
---
I mean, I like immersed survivors. Keeping track of gen progress is more than enough information to let you know when someone's trying to be sneaky. 
---
I think, since DS rework the enduring perk is either A or B but not an S, now it's mainly useful against pallet stuns and good survivors will not go away from it until you either break it or build up the speed. Whispers is generally an OK perk, you'll know where the survivors are and in 1 v 1 scenario you're pretty much won the game so I could technically agree that it is useful on all the killers. Not sure about STBFL. NOED is an A tier if you're a good killer because most of the time you will either have all survivors killed before all gens pop or there's two or three alive and it doesn't help that much, I think only bad killers benefit the most of this perk. 
---
yes, i will not spend another dime on the game while it's in this state.
---
I was going to ask where she got the cosmetics, but she kills an awful lot of pretty girls and probably goes through their purses. Lesser known loot from the bloodweb.
---
Also, great art. Reminds me of the big russian girl from the Team Fortress 2 comics.
---
Me three!
---
I feel like bloodhound is underrated, not just on this list but in general.
---
That's because someone disconnected during the loading screen. That's literally what I said.
---
Pink shirt, Pink Pants, and Dweird. 
---
Again, literally what I just said. I said it happens because "they disconnected"

To be fair, I'm speculating on the free one since all the other movie characters have been paid only.

I was hoping they'd do evil ash as the counterpart killer
---
Oh yes, yes you can
---
That sounds like a lot of hyperbole.
---
Nah thats just The sound of franks mixtape.
---
So I'm confused about this a bit.  Don't they always launch a killer/survivor combo?  And we just had one like a week ago.  So this is a standalone survivor?
---

NOED IS BAD GAME DESIGN AND DESPERATELY NEEDS LOOKED AT, ESPECIALLY ON CONSOLE WHERE ALL THE KILLERS ARE APPARENTLY REALLY BAD AT THE GAME AND CAN ONLY GET KILLS WITH NOED 1.

Unpopular opinion;   
---
Ash is a bad fit for the game.  
---
He's not someone who runs from evil.  
---
He chops evil into tiny bits and/or gives them the ol' boomstick.  
---
  
---
The thought of Ash (The chosen one, remember) just running away constantly, throwing a pallet at killers he would normally dismemeber, feels out of place.  
---
Honestly just feels like a cashgrab for us fans of the Evil Dead series.
---
[This reminds me of something. I'm just not sure what...] (https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b4e87x/leaked_footage_of_ash_williams_teabagging_the/)
---
If I had to guess, the limited draw distance on this map are affecting the auras as well. This means that auras become harder to see the further away you are and actually aren‚Äôt even visible past a certain distance. 
---

*RIDICULOUSLY LOUD GUITAR RIFFING WHILE YOU'RE LAYING DOWNED ON THE GROUND INTENSIFIES*

---
So do I. I remember being really confused at first. 
---
I think they would rather you didn't
---
At least I HOPE they didn‚Äôt....but the DBD dev‚Äôs are pretty silly.
---
I think the reason the other licensed survivors look off is because the team didn‚Äôt get the rights to the likeness of those actors. I could be wrong though.
---
Mark it as spoiler you shit
---
This is sooo cute. I love it, do you think there would be any chance I could use this on my stream?
---
I need this original pic plz. Where can I get it
---
Hmm, okay thanks
---
Wow those are tiny monitors. lol
---
I tried to :(
---
That's really lame. I hate this stupid cosmetics store. Remember when Bill dropped with a ton of free cosmetics? Or how the survivors used to be released with full extra outfits instead of a shitty recolor of the top?
---
Spirits... They always tunnel and they're also the ones to complain about how survivors are op and have too many crutches yet they run purple add-ons and have all the uber meta shit too... Smh idk if it's me but it seems like 90% Spirit I face are just pain toxic (no offense to you good cookies tho.)
---
I‚Äôm guessing the fog effects on this map are being applied to auras. That would be why they fade away with distance up until they‚Äôre actually invisible. 
---
*Groovy*

Hey BhVR I don‚Äôt know what level crack you are smoking but on PS4 the ranking has been all jacked up! Im a rank 8-9 survivor playing solo and I‚Äôve been playing since 4pm EST all I keep getting lumped in with are rank 15-19 killers and then I throw on a BPS and get a rank 2 killer! Now all the survivors I‚Äôve been paired with are either the same rank or mixed, wait times are from 5-10minutes and I normally spawn in the killers lobby by myself and wait another 3-5mins for others to spawn in. I don‚Äôt know what our doing but your game is turning into a BIG DUMPSTER FIRE. But wait it gets better, your gonna put out another DLC survivor for the cash infusion and not worry about the fans who are fixing to leave... good luck BhVR

Is there a link where I can hear it?  I'm a console player :(
---
there's just a little difference: NOED can make a baby killer make 4k because it stays there (and I can garantee you that in my rank people don't do totens), but adrenaline only aply one state, but I agree with you, we should nerf all the survivors perks and a little about the killer ones, because it's too op that survivors can survive. I wonder if when all survivors perk turn to crap, what will killer main brag abou.
---
"HUUUUUNTERRRRR!"
---
"Bill put the gun down! That's just Nea!"
---
Ash would have been better as a killer. 
---
WHY THE FUCK KILLERS GONNA LEAVE A PREGAME LOBBY AFTER MY 3 MINUTE WAIT TIME?!!!??!!
---
Yep... They just throw DLCs and cosmetics at you and expect you to forget about the game's issues. Saddly I'm a part of the problem because I fucking buy every new DLC they release... lol
---
But can she infect... bear traps?
---
I like this...but it's still needed to avoid them finishing a gen 2 seconds after you spawn.

I made my own Tierlist and I put some Perks in a "Honorable Mention" list like NOED for example and some Perks are in a "Depends" list like Mad Grit, Franklins, Hangman just to name a few because those are super meta dependent or if you are constantly playing against SWF's they get considerably better.  
---
Also I have a BP tier but in that tier I also rank them by what comes first in that list.  
---
BBQ is better than Distressing which is better than Beast of Prey.
---
Some Perks are obviously super nice on some Killers. Iron maiden on Huntress.  
---

I was able to see it better by putting my graphic settings on low
---
Doubt it. I think the only reason where getting cosmetics with ash is because Bruce has a say in what they do with him, and he cares about quality. The other characters are owned by companies that are more soulless.
---
&gt;Myers has to get shot like 8 times. He‚Äôs a living breathing human. Myers would have killed so many more people if it weren‚Äôt for Laurie accidentally setting up the perfect ambush for Loomis to finish the job. Anyways in this fight/tournament/brawl ***Freddy is mortal*** and Myers uses the 2018 storyline **so he isn‚Äôt immortal** with the bullshit Thorn Cult  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In Myers canon he is a bastard child from the Thorn Cult **making him immortal**  
---
&gt;***ALL the killers are immortal***
---
... You ok there, buddy? Feeling alright? You can reread your own responses? 
---
Yeah I member that
---
Yeah I‚Äôm waiting for them to make it back the way it used to be before I try for adept plague. 
---
Actually been okay on Xbox NA for me today. Played SWF with one person and a killer game so far and times have been okay. Killer was near instant 
---
Oh no wait, I thought the sleeves were red, that looks like the uniform for the store that Ash owned in season 3, I don't remember what it was called. It wasn't called S-Mart was it?
---
No W
---
I'VE LITERALLY BEEN WAITING IN ONE LOBBY FOR AN ACTUAL REAL TIME HONEST TO GOD HOUR ONE PERSON IN ONE PERSON OUT. FOR AN HOUR. AN HOUR. 60 MINUTES. WAITING. WATCHING. 
---
Pretty Good job so far *Ryan*
---
It does do totems fairly decent though. It has that going for it. 
---
KOBE
---
Feng, hahaha.
---
"Eee. Eee. Ohhh. Eee."
---
Absolutely, but to an extent. Ya gotta find a good middle ground 
---
Nope. They‚Äôre so fucking confusing. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going as survivor I just try my best to aim for a fast vault for the window and try to run around to pallet and repeat.
---
It just means they bought the likeliness.
---
Barbecue and chili sounds quite silly, with some... fuck what the fuck rhymes with barbecue?
---
I try and play a good boy Bubba because I‚Äôve seen nothing but BM from the majority of people who use it, plus he‚Äôs been around longer than Legion so by default has more hate against him. I‚Äôd say probably 1.Leather 2.Legion 3.Myers 
---
OMG. Ashley who? I'm all about this news instead!
---
Better ran there. 
---
They reverted it and now it‚Äôs back to the experimental system they were trying out. 
---
I get tunneled for 5 gens while other survivors don‚Äôt unhook or help me. Killers drop chase on other survivors to chase me for the entire game. I‚Äôm honestly dumbfounded. 
---
why would they do that it's so garbage
---
On the other side of a pallet and outside the exit gate it is
---
Iirc the actor for Quentin didn't even know about it til after the fact.  I believe he was cool with it.
---
Brand new part with purple tool box, 
---
Obviously your new here 
---
What an ass
---
This is so true.
---
Had a really clever David use dead hard to negate his fall stun, as he looped me on the storehouse, and it took me quite a while to close in on him for the down.
---
They did 4 gens in that time, but once I had him on a hook, I was able to down the other 3 potatoes quite quickly. I was about 40bseconds away from a 0k, and it would have been a lot easier to leave David and take down the gen jockeys. 
---
yeah on weaker killers at high ranks it is.
---
Even when it isn't mandatory it is still far and away the best perk in the game.
---
Is 1300 hours not long enough
---
Interesting list, thanks for putting this together! Is spies in the shadows still B tier after the nerf though? I've found it has gotten way less useful with the cooldown and reduced range. 
---
Had a survivor teammate disconnect when Billy downed them about a minute and a half into the game. Despicable. 
---
You, my good sir, are what I aspire to be. 
---
No. lie.
---
You go to Ash when you're looking for a good time and some fun running the killer around. You go to Bill for The Wisdom(TM) and when you need a good peptalk.

Wow, someone who doesn't have his head up his ass and understands the way things work. Let them keep bitching and making post after post about this.
---
Give Billy a taste of his own damn medicine.
---
Photo shop dwight under Nea about to get body slammed swap leather face to the other side as he cheers for his teacher.
---
Mount Disconnect.
---
Even with the update? Fuck this map.
---
80 seconds difference vs 76 seconds isnt much
---
Yes. Xbox is out of control right now. So much so that I‚Äôm jumping off. Minimal que times seems to be over 10-15 minutes as a survivor. It‚Äôs really bad
---
You gotta get out of the mindset that it is mandatory. 
---
I've played every killer at red ranks (beside Pukey Girl) without Ruin for quite some time and I almost never use Ruin. I feel like the better majority of my games are fine. I'll only really use it in an all-hex build or as a Hag with solid phantasms at The Institute.
---
As for Pukey Girl, I haven't quite gotten the hang of her yet, so I will not say much about her.
---
That‚Äôs a really simple answer actually, a PTB for just matchmaking wouldn‚Äôt give them accurate results across PC and console, plus would rely solely on people playing the PTB.. which considering how well the community reacts to them trying to debug the game.. I can‚Äôt imagine many people would join to help with data collection. A broad implementation of their tweaked system is the only other way around that, it‚Äôs for the best tbh, people want change but with how people react to this sorta situation..this is the only option they really have.
---
As God as my witness, she is broken in half!
---
https://youtu.be/688z-4SWxOQ
---
alternative: getting hyped for new content Vs.  actually playing the game
---
I think you could get enough bloodpoints for both of them pretty easily if you play killer you are comfortable with + bbq and chilli over the weekend.
---
Only if you can get past the thirty achievements you get for doing literally anything in the game.
---
I swear, that achievement sound.
---
Noice!
---
lmao i love that shit
---
When you play this game all the damn time, it's soooo refreshing to just see random antics.
---
Holy fuck lmao.. I didn‚Äôt even realize there was a tutorial üòÇ I figured that bs was just instructions not an actual like play through. Good shit pointing this out! 
---
She's underneath, you can see the red stain at 0:04
---
Technically you should hit them because they managed to make it to the hatch without getting slugged. 
---
Can we get a Huntress skin that is just her naked, covered in honey?
---
Moonwalking is also not really toxic
---
you've murdered their friends by throwing them on meat hooks I think you've established enough dominance XD
---
They just added it a few months ago
---
Silly cute
---
But doesn‚Äôt he take it from the right hand? They‚Äôre not gonna change the animation so that he takes it from the left just for ash.
---
That would require them to make a whole new animation for Ash which knowing BHVR I doubt they would do, but who knows?
---
Let him have it
---
What else could one rage about?
---
***Blindness?!*** Like *blindness* blindness? That's the exact opposite of what I want!
---
Trapper, LF, Pig, Myers
---
Pretty sure I saw the chainsaw hand too..
---
Shoot you're right, the Clown takes a finger from their right hand and Ash doesn't have a right hand.
---
The only reasonable solution to this is to have Ash kill any Killer if they try to Mori him.
---
to be fair there was no real reason to care about ranks in the first place. When i got to rank 1 I didn't get the feeling of accomplishment because I got there with casual matches with friends
---
This map is a hard IDGAF as a killer and survivor. Id rather play on Lerys or Meat Packing even.
---
That explains a lot actually lol I just thought I overlooked it when I started.
---
But the killer DCs right before you exit
---
It doesnt force anything against good survivors. Good survivors just power through it
---
If anything, this community has stayed through and through, flaws and all
---
No
---
Most people use it on Spirit still
---
Clearly.
---
Wait, I have to buy Borderlands 3 and Mortal Kombat. I can‚Äôt buy something that cool right now.
---
FROM DOWNTOWN 
---
Doubtful
---
Don't get caught out in the open so she can't break you with her puke. 
---
LF, hands down. God forbid you're the first one down cause 9/10 LFs will patiently stare you down until the Entity generously takes you into ita embrace. 
---
No because he's licensed like Leatherface is. 
---
is he console only?
---
You were trying to cross the border, right?
---
Ah. Then no, I don't have Rancor.
---
I'd probably switch to killer main for this.
---
It's still only a 2% increase in speed. By then, they'll have gotten away.
---
Feel free to tear this idea apart but I've always wondered why killers don't run Devour Hope instead of ruin. I mean, you're running the same risk of having it be broken super early, but getting a much more powerful perk. You basically cut chases in half with oneshots, get a slight speed boost, and insta kills for that one survivor you may not have hooked yet. Instead of slowing the game down, why not speed it up for yourself?
---
For some ppl april 1 is already april 2. Besides, it could be like diablo immortal: a very out of season april fools joke.
---
Seriously its fucking ash williams. Youd think breaking the game wouldnt be thia subtle.
---
Isnt that a very obvious D.Va reference and not Feng Min? Lmao.
---
Hopefully he has voiced lines at least a little bit.
---
Seriously its fucking ash williams. Youd think
---
when the hell did he have a puppet on his hand? I haven't watched the show so if it's there that's why i got no clue
---
No. All platforms.
---
I think the stun should be at most 5 seconds, but other than that, yeah, I like this. 
---
I didn't think it would increase queue times that much. I thought overall it would make pings and lagginess less painful at the cost of slightly longer queue times. Instead we have significantly longer queue times and still crazy pings!
---
I wonder if he will bring his chainsaw
---
Yes, it's not like you can have April Fool's joke in december, or Christmas in july.
---
I see no problem with stun I genuinely think if it's 5 seconds killers could keep tunneling the same person with them having no real chance of getting away without getting in a chase
---
Ash vs Evil Dead was able to reference Army of Darkness from season 2 onwards, so maybe they got some kind of deal worked out?
---
Why would they make something that'd get their fanbase infuriated with them for a joke?
---
I completely agree with everything you say. It just starts getting disheartening when I literally can't even play the game. I'd be lucky to get two straight lobbies without crashes, rage quitters, or the game freezing. It's just unfortunate, and I only want good things for them and the game.
---
But he's gonna be licensed, you can't buy licensed characters with shards.
---
I'd argue that they mostly prefer Ruin as it has an immediate effect, so even though it is broken early, it still did something. Whereas with Devour Hope, you usually need a good snowball to feel its effects. 
---
Side note: I love Devour Hope and used to always use it. Nowadays, I use Rancor though
---
It's just a survivor, no killer. Much less coding/design.
---
Matchmaking is utter shit atm. 10k players online but each game takes 10mins to find an unbalanced game.
---
We get that this sucks, but until they fix it just smack the Nea. 
---
You only get like 4,000-ish points for securing a 4k, and 2500 of those points are only useful if you haven't already maxed out the Deviousness category. You can easily more than quadruple the bloodpoints you earn by killing Nea by just playing a new game.
---
Your time is better spent finding a new match so that you can have fun actually playing the game AND earn *more* bloodpoints *faster*.
---
Leatherface. Don't know why but 96% of them are complete pricksüòÇ
---
I don‚Äôt know about Bill but Leatherface isn‚Äôt free. I feel like the fact that Ash is a licensed character means he won‚Äôt be free.
---
Oh hell yeah, he's gonna points and make "follow me" gestures with his metal hand. I'm all for it.
---
Oh then they meant as a survivor only dlc! Gotcha......is it tuesday yet?
---
They had to pay for the rights to the character and actor's likeness, so it's extremely unlikely.
---
Spider-Nea. Spider-Nea, does whatever involves chasing killers. Can she swing from an entity? No she cant... She is salty... Look out! It is Spider-Nea.
---
Shes the same speed as most other killers, it really is the best option against her. 
---
oof that's weird when people care about rank. are they always feeling entitled to not being camped and tunneled? 
---
So we‚Äôre not getting evil dead as dlc ever 
---
So evil dead isn‚Äôt going to be dlc then 
---
It was officially announced by behaviour, and it was already all over the place. If you don‚Äôt know this stuff you live under a rock. 
---
That‚Äôs even better
---
Honestly considering ditching Nea to play Ash
---
nah, killer doesnt need anything more going for it. it's already strong af as is
---
I've been playing Legion all day with no hate. one guy called me camper tho. *Not like you can really camp with legion tho lol*
---
10 seconds is way too long, though. 
---
Pray? Is she a priestess like the Plague?
---
Time to main ash, sorry ace.
---
Have they said dedicated servers are coming? New to the game and excited if so!
---
Im just reflecting what you dish out. People like you ruin this game. You're the definition of toxic. Reguardless i could care less what you think about me man I know what my problems but you seem obivious to how ficked up in the head you are. Good luck in life with that attitude. 
---
But thats 3 perks
---
Oops my bad, did not notice that error when I originally typed it, thank you
---
Disappointed!
---
Why would gaining addons affect how killer plays? Besides the situation I presented benefits survivors and give killers a boost for another match?
---
Fair enough 7 should work just fine
---
Yeah brb just strapping my chainsaw and shotgun to my belt
---
If I would have been that survivor I would‚Äôve been tilted hahahah
---
Good fucking job though
---
SHOUT OUT TO WHOEVER DUMBASS WRAITH TUNNELED ME FOR 10 GODDAMN MINUTES BEYOND THE POINT OF ANY CONCEIVABLE RATIONALE. DO YOU JUST HATE MY DWIGHTSTACHE?? ALL I WAS TRYNA DO IN THIS MATCH WAS GET 180 SECONDS OF COLLAB BUT NOOOOOO FROM THE VERY START YOU JUST PICK ME AND CHASE ME NONSTOP EVEN WHEN OTHER SURVIVORS PHYSICALLY PUT THEMSELVES BETWEEN ME AND YOU. YOU IGNORED EASY HITS AND JUST KEPT COMING AFTER ME. FUCK YOU SIR. YOU'RE A SHIT KILLER AND YOU ONLY GOT 1 KILL BECAUSE OF YOUR SHIT PLAYING MOTHERFUCKER.
---
Being 100% honest you'll just get people who body block as a group so you cant get near it without downing all 4, at least this has been my experience most recently where downing 1 person 3 come from out of the shadows to body block and run away
---
Mori machine love the name 
---
this is why we need shirtless leatherface..
---
because more add ons is more power. not only does the killer get points to buy add ons with, now they can also earn GURANTEED greens too? nty. 
---
Mad Grit my man
---
Prepare for downvotes cause you're playing egion. Lol smh
---
I hear that Nea has a very strong bicycle kick
---
See I posted this last time and no one thought it was a good idea.
---
I usually hate pedants who correct spelling online, but I was legit confused for a minute so I felt I had to let ya know 
---
Shit matchmaking bring back peer-peer
---
This seems more like "I don't like killers getting addons because I'm biased" more than it is a "this would throw the balance out the window" Most killers spend their BP on ranking someone else up rather than putting more points into their BW for addons.
---
Also some games i toss trying to kill jakes and tunnel them cuz back when game was first out on console i was a trapper main lol i just hate jakes, you can always find them not helping put around a far map corner or in a locker
---
I don't dc, but the fifth or sixth time in a row the killer makes a beeline straight to me within the first twenty seconds does get a bit frustrating.
---
Lol
---
She needs to be buffed...  they should add her speed boost while charging back..
---
I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs so wrong with having another good killer like the spirit, nurse and billy...  
---
Why do we always have to nerf/make the new killers to bottom tier (Freddy, legion) or have them mid tier?? 
---
And, don‚Äôt cleanse, just pretend she is a trapper or billy without the traps and you‚Äôre fine... she‚Äôs an m1 killer outside of that sickness. 
---
eh i need to build up bp anyway. First time I'm building up the BP for a survivor....feels weird man....or I would if I could find a game! 
---
I have no friends to try the perks in KYF or I would've. Mettle of Man seems good. I forget the name but the one that converts recover bar to wiggle bar could be usefull
---
I'm p3ing and all perking him asap...wait i still need to get jane to 40 crap!
---
The killer probably got little to no chase/deviousness (only in sacrifice and maybe brutality) points since everyone died so quickly. 
---
Sometimes that happens to a nurse if she ends the game too fast. 
---
YEET THE NEA
---
I never even noticed they changed it. That's good though, it used to be really bad, just had random scratches everywhere because they lasted so long.
---
If it fit in my builds I would lol, sucks for them though cause body blocking a huntress who injures everyone isnt a good idea ;) slowly getting better on where I can throw hatchets and the hitbox still hit right over a survivors head
---
I never expressed any contempt towards you as a person. So no, you can try to justify your behavior all you like, but you just wished ill on someone over a petty argument about a video game. Good luck with THAT attitude. lmao
---
"Reguardless" btw. lmfao
---
"could care less" btw. lmfao
---
"ficked up" btw. lmfao
---
Nice
---
Bloodhound is certainly helpful in some situations especially finding those sneaky survivors with iron will or ubran evasion. I'm using surveillance here because I'm currently prestieging Huntress and I don't have other better perks to fill that slot :)
---
What the FRICK did dbd strike a really good deal?
---
Currently prestieging Huntress and I don't have other better perks to fill that slot
---
It has something to do with borrowed time and getting feral frenzied I am pretty sure. I thought they fixed it though?
---
[Canadian man yeets child 4 meters](https://vgy.me/ipyRoF.png)  
---
you are 100% right, but sadly this is how gaming Communities in general work.
---
Something gets hate by some influencel people, gets a few Memes and soon it becomes a reality in those Peoples minds
---
Trevor Philips as a Survivor. Perks: 
---
*Crack (Meth) House* - When within 12/20/28 meters of the Basement entrance, you leave no scratch marks. 
---
*Primal Urges* - The closer you are to the killer, the more this perk charges. At max charge, you may you M2 when facing the killer to attack them, stunning both of you for four seconds. This can only happen once per trial. 
---
*Loooooad of Sheit* - For every Survivor injured/downed, gain 10/20/30% bonus speed applied to all actions. This perks makes you immune to Thanatophobia, and Dying Light. The bonus does not stack for Survivors hooked/sacrificed. 
---
How about Ash as a killer but you see the survivors as Deadites while they see each other as normal. 
---
It‚Äôs awesome watching the living survivors step in the same exact trap that got your ass... like damn be wary of the shack...
---
That's been happening to me too on PS4 as well...
---
boomstick gives ash confidence, gives him hope.
---
The entity can't abduct him unless his soul is out of hope.
---
Well that‚Äôs pretty much the theory why he‚Äôd be killing survivors. 
---
But I doubt they‚Äôd put in the time to make skins for everyone. 
---
i am also sad but for different reasons
---
What‚Äôs wrong?
---
this would be lowkey fire
---
Wasn‚Äôt that the concept of the movie? To harass ash until he died? Lol
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/54657/looks-like-ash-has-cosmetics#latest
---
Wait how is Legion low tier if they have no counterplay?
---
Shame 
---
Usually just high enough to find a p3 claudette on any map, been called a cheater for it too but being 100% honest if one person's hid there then 100s have and I'm sure as hell checking every corner if you disappear into thin air
---
The face makes him look kinda chubby to me lol
---
Can confirm, I never ran ruin with spirit and didn't felt the need as chases was fast and the pressure was easy to put on.
---
Tried it with hag... Got gen rushed so hard didn't even finished my set up properly.
---
I love these, and your future self will hate them in ten years.
---
I have diagnosed depression so it happens regularly so don't worry
---
Eeeh, kinda hard to tell if that's a chainsaw.
---
He has a yellow item equipped, might as well be a medkit in his hand.
---
very 
---
The exact same reason self-care is everywhere??
---
well it's worth the 10 minutes 
---
Where did you get that idea? None of the survivor bios mention that and we have a lot of examples easily dissproving that, the biggest example being Kate.
---
I agree. But to me every killer can have something like that. Facecamping bubba, prayer beads rin, anyone with a mori, insta rev billy, the list goes on. I don‚Äôt believe it to be grounds for a dc.
---
It's worth checking on the start of the match if you can glance at it on your way to gen checking. But don't make it too obvious or you'll give away where it is. 
---
Protecting the totem at all costs won't work unless the survivors are truly greedy. You can sometimes catch them being greedy for a totem once you know they know where it is. But checking every now and then is basically all you can do, sometimes it'll get cleansed at the start of the match regardless but if you get one down before it gets cleansed it's worth it IMO.
---
Overcharge is good on Doc IMO but on other killers you might not be able to reliably kick gens and proc it. As long as survivors don't stumble into Ruin at the start of the match, if they're off gens looking for it it's doing its job plenty. 
---
Moonwalk?
---
What‚Äôs that mean
---
I only ever watched the one on the middle lol
---
I only watch the one in the bottom left as 72hrs quit so can't watch him :(
---
Happy birthday man c:
---
I love finding people like you on subreddits. through the toxicity of dbd there are good people like you. you have a good one too
---
(also this message genuinely made me really happy, thank you)
---
Well, we could mend, it just took ages!
---
The deep wound meter stops going down while in a chase, the killer can approach you without going into a chase by walking towards you facing backwards. This means there‚Äôs nothing you can ultimately do to stop the timer from eventually forcefully slugging you.
---
No problem üòä
---
It got switched to some furry subreddit lol
---
When I say sacrificing two pips, I mean the two pips you lose from dcing, but sure.
---
That's not the point. What we want to know is why you can get what is fundamentally the maximum amount of bloodpoints without self-care spam, and *only get* one iridescent?
---
*hai*
---
Yes, the angry man child who disconnects and encourages various other toxic behavior is considered a "good" streamer.
---
Is it two for dcing? I had no idea thought you were meaning the ones they possibly gained 
---
P3 Frank is best cosmetic
---
I thought people liked him? I don‚Äôt even know the rest of these other people tbh.
---
Metal as fuck üòé
---
Yeah, two if you dc. 
---
As leather face performs an uppercut, new contemplates life choices
---
No clue what BM means but wraith
---
you don't know 72hrs?
---
Wait you mean using the deep wound effect and purposely ending a chase to down them?
---
I thought that was a strategy all legions use the second I read what the effects are that‚Äôs what I did  how is it toxic and not allowed?
---
Serious question I‚Äôm not trying to be toxic or anything 
---
Are we describing majority of the dbd community or tom
---
Nope. I only know of the guy in the middle. The only dbd YouTuber I watch is noob3.
---
is the guy in the middle as bas as ochido?
---
I mean, I've seen killer claim Self Care is toxic, Adreneline is toxic etc
---
There's fuckwits on every side
---
Actually they said they will go back on the last ranking system very soon
---
72hrs one in top left was pretty much titled the god of jukes and his cosmetic is the orange smock in the charity case
---
what does this have to do with anything?
---
everyone knows this
---
not even close 
---
In one game that I play there is a blind person that can sense everything around them. The screen is black and white and they can see people through walls if they are moving or you are really close to them.
---
Ah I see. But is there a reason for the guy in the middle to be hated? I thought a lot of people respected him.
---
Why are you like this
---
Doc so far does the best at farming bp some survivors are generous enough to stay at the gates and let me shock them
---
All PS4 players are feeling your pain! It's so awful again. :(
---
It's amazing when you are the killer because they waste a ton of time, it makes you want to tear your hair out when you are their teammate because they waste a ton of time.
---
Sloppy butcher fan btw.
---
Tbh im getting him only to get his perks for my jane.
---
Jane is my main, I'm not gonna prestige her cause idc about it.
---
Maybe during a double bp event. I love her and her outfits.
---
It's inspired me. Doctor time, get me those goodies. 
---
It's 36 seconds instead of 40 most of the time, it's really not that worth it against them.
---
Why? Its been officially announced
---
Fair enough, but i like true better than toxic survivors the post says made the game better. To me if you look at the way true plays its educational if you dont know what your doing. Pug is asshole troll and Jendenise is a toxic swf player who was caught up in a dcing scandal. Im just saying they could have picked better people.
---
I've never had spare BP lol, I keep jumping to different characters and foolishly spend them all constantly. 
---
Not that I mind, I actually enjoy essentially earning a level up per match! 
---
As someone who got unhooked 3 times by the same Meg the literal second I was hooked each time, I might have to agree
---
Not really a "build" but if I just want to have fun I play as the Doctor and only use add-ons that make the hallucination of pallets. 
---
Entire match of cackling as I see survivors running for pallets they think will save them! 
---
Hidden Ash perk:
---
Makes the Clown's mori take twice as long as he struggles to get his knife through the metal finger, giving your teammates more time to teabag and flashlight your corpse
---
Yay another killer with perks that don‚Äôt even get used because Noed ruin bbq and bamboozle are too op
---
From top left to bottom right is
---
72hrs, Zubat, Jendenise,
---
Tofu, Tru3, Morf,
---
Ehmer3, Angrypug, Geef.
---
I had a game like that yesterday! Literally everyone in the match had obscene BP, such a fun match, we even wished each other good luck in the future lol.
---
The new update makes a noticable difference for that map, the scratch marks are brighter now so it helps a lot.
---
In my experience at least!
---
I mean it‚Äôs smart (S-Mart). Original content is great but when they bring in so many players due to adding so many beloved properties in a row and then stop for over a year what‚Äôd they expect. I get they had no choice before because of Starbreeze I think but honestly they were smart in knowing that‚Äôs what sells and that‚Äôs what the majority want, I just wish they could find a way to put out both licensed and original content without those who are for or against them getting upset.
---
Think bigger. Ash is gonna have a puppet hand cosmetic, so how's that gonna work?
---
The vault over the lobby counter is actually ironwork's of mistery level of safe, it's kinda nutty.
---
We love making these. If you have any killer or survivor in a nutshell request, we‚Äôd like to make it.
---
I mean with Bruce 100% on board I believe it
---
And it's honestly pretty good now that it's been buffed
---
Yeah, Everyone can make their own opinions on each person I just personally find him a bit arrogant
---
Ooh groovy

started out super bright and slowly dimmed, I am so confused rn
---
Pure beauty.
---
Tru3 is hit or miss for some people but he's not a bad person.  
---
Ochido is a different story.
---
"let's do this gen, it's close by"
---
"ABORT ABORT RUN GO TO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE"
---
They're just salty they messed up bad enough for that situation to even happen, and that you didn't fall for the extremely obvious bait/lure on the other side of the map. 
---
I don't understand you, why do you think this is an April Fool's joke when it has been announced in march?
---
Nyeh, there's the high roller 
---
The pip system is also to blame. :) 
---
I deleted the game a couple days ago... that didn‚Äôt last long. I‚Äôm addicted. 
---
Oh my gosh, a licensed survivor getting good cosmetics. Wow wow wow
---
Wait. That's illegal.
---
It's not purposefully ending a chase. You're still chasing the survivor you just turn around and walk backwards. It makes it so the survivor is forced to go down no matter what they do and while I don't consider it toxic it's pretty unfun for the survivors.
---
What‚Äôs up Tom Brady 
---
Thank you!
---
Sounds fair to me, good point :)
---
Looking at it that way it‚Äôs pretty op
---
When I start playing again I won‚Äôt moonwalk I had no clue how unfun and broken it is
---
Thanks :)
---
BEGONE, THOT!
---
I think a DC against Franks mix tape and/or moonwalking Legion is somewhat justified even if I still disagree with it.  
---
But for a time and even now Legion was near unplayable because everyone would DC the moment they saw them. And you still get hate in the after game chat just for playing Legion no matter what you do.
---
*laughs maniacally in Azarov's Resting Place*
---
Your fun is not my problem. My fun isn‚Äôt yours. I‚Äôm tryna kill the shit outta you not have a picnic.
---
yeah, likewise D: i never liked instadown but lucky 5 token mori was awesome.
---
also why even changing Ruin to affect all survivors. cheesus, the amount of baby ruins and baby noeds is way too high
---
They already won, they killed 3 and destroyed the survivors presumably with gens still up.  Hatch standoffs never make sense.  In the time they take they could play and win an entire new game and destroy another set of survivors for more points.  Hatches are basically a consolation prize for last survivor assuming they even make it there (I down people looking for hatch routinely).  These things just make zero sense logically to engage in.  Just hit them out, it's never worth it. 
---
I mean it‚Äôs probably just goodwill towards PAX in general. Companies do stuff like this all the time 
---
The only time I personally can maybe justify it is, ironically, all survivors agree to dc. Then at least only one person gets fucked over instead of everyone lol. Even still I fully disagree with it. All games will have that one thing that just makes you want to pull your hair out but for some reason DBD players just seem incapable of handling it.
---
killers get to play all game and not being put on a hook is a shitty excuse for why killers are OP lul? Killers items don't run out but their addons do, survivors don't really care about their items generally, you know what they do care about? addons. The only item I'd say I care about as survivor is skeleton key. on average from my experience a good killer game nets me 28k BP and a good survivor game nets me 20k. that's hardly a difference. again though... Why does it matter how much killers earn? That doesn't affect the game you're excuse for why this shouldn't be a thing is killers are op
---
Nothing wrong with tru3 or his opinions...
---
In fact, out of all the streamers I like him best and learn the most from...
---
Many of the survivor only streamers and youtubers are the true fuck heads of this community, I‚Äôve noticed.
---
At any rate, I‚Äôd like some examples, preferably detailed in why you don‚Äôt like tru3 or his opinions? What specifically is a bad idea? 
---
Most survivors know not to do it on that one. With Hag, you best believe I'm picking a side to make mine. I'm gonna force that 3gen, dang it.
---
So survivors get brown quality items from chests and killers get green addons guaranteed  that have no limit to their use. That makes no sense listen to yourself. 
---
WOAAAAW ASH IN DBD ! NEVER SAW IT COMING !
---
Totally. I've done it on occasion, not realised when playing survivor, and hey. My fault. Work through it and move on.
---
Game map and one person didn't load in. Hooked all of the three others twice, then let them escape after lots of shocking and making it obvious I was the benevolent one. BP over kills, fun over BP!
---
If Gen rushing is a thing then the 3 gen strat is a thing.  People whine too much.
---
As a survivor, I would make the killer suffer from my poor planning by wasting as much of their day as possible; I'd never go near a gen at all. I would tea bag around the map, maybe sit in a basement locker and definitely gather as many crows as possible during my gameplay. (Rank 1 Survivor) 
---
Not like she wasn't annoying enough
---
Now people gonna use Franklin's to make her even more unbearable 
---
That's a pretty bold statement to be making. 
---
I don't think OP actually understands the full extent of what Ruin actually does outside of the ability itself. 
---
Obeast
---
I think he's based on his most recent appearance in the TV show. Bruce even says that he's from "Ash vs The Evil Dead" instead of something like "The Evil Dead series."
---
Yeah. Been queuing as a solo survivor for 28 minutes now. Reset the lobby 7 times. Still waiting.
---
Yes and no. In the show, Ruby was a big bad for most of the show. Then she became an ally. Then the timelines got all screwy so the Ruby they had been traveling with, got killed by her younger version, and the younger Ruby became the evil, but she was evil because she was trying to save her friend, but she was still (kinda) good, because she was trying to rescue her friend from the true big bad which came out to be a huge fucking creature about 30 stories tall, which Ash eventually killed.   
---
Though the Deadites can infect any body that isn't protected against it.   
---
Basically, Ruby is the overall bad guy in each season, except a little bit. Where they have to kill her ex/Evil Lord, Baal. He was a baddy for most of Season 2 after Episode 5.   
---
But as I said, Ruby is the one who plagues the group the most. Even though she joins them, she's the reason why the group got fucked over, and over, and over again.
---
Ooh, yeah that‚Äôs rough. So the way I think it works is that it doesn‚Äôt immediately stun the killer when you open the lockers, but it does shortly thereafter. Still does it quick enough to where they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hit you, and makes it so they‚Äôre stunned during a time you could actually get away. (I haven‚Äôt used it, just from what I‚Äôve seen and from playing as a killer). When you started jumping out it was lit up, but since the killer was moving past the locker it unlit before the actual stun could happen? Just what it looks like to me. 
---
STBFL, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, and Enduring. Shuts down any part of the chase.
---
he looks like frank west from dead rising lmao
---
This is why Trapper is one of my favorite killers. Sure he‚Äôs just man with machete but damn it, it feels so satisfying mind gaming the survivors. Like when they are about to start looping I just start nodding my head at them and they avoid the loop even though I didn‚Äôt even trap it. It‚Äôs the best. 
---
Dwight better
---
I‚Äôm prob gonna do a Dwight, claud and meg one. It‚Äôs for a video with my and my friends, 
---
Devour hope has never upset me while playing survivor. I will miss it 
---
Everytime I have 4 tokens, it gets blown up. *oof*
---
Not bad. It will work fine, me thinks. 
---
&lt;3
---
Bill is licenced too Pepega 
---
I think you mean ‚Äúthe simple fact that the totem
---
is destroyed so quickly is proof that you‚Äôre the entity‚Äôs least favorite and you should disconnect and uninstall the game before you bring any more shame to your family!‚Äù
---
Or evil ash, who looks like a survivor but is a killer 
---
Yay
---
Holy shit, that scared **me**.
---
I agree that Tru3 isn‚Äôt a bad guy, but the way he handled his argument with Ochido in the past was just a bad look for him, it made him look petty. Let‚Äôs just not forget; People like No0b3, Tru3talent, Monto, and many other popular content creators have made their names off DBD. They are in no way tied down to play DBD (unless they‚Äôre part of the Fog Whisperers program). They could easily choose to leave, but they don‚Äôt.
---
I literally only play as Billy and most of his add ons wouldn't be worth that he's got like 3 good ones... Maybe if I could choose the add on 
---
If anything,  the "nerf" helped. It's slightly less precise now but the constant explosion of crows was real annoying.
---
Nea gets thrown around the maps and commanded to scream if she hits a survivor...
---
aka Killers working together for once
---
Well considering they haven't released it yet, as far as we know all these cosmetics have already undergone approval when the license was purchased. The issue is whether or not we'll see new cosmetics later down the line after release. Cause that's when they will have to renegotiate terms and seek further approval, which is the stopping point for most current licenses character cosmetics
---
Random side thought.. Legion should be able to crouch, to further impersonate survivors.. 
---
Bad Mannering.
---
You flashlight flicking your buddy made me think this.. Lol 
---
All this needs is the re-enactment of her mori animation lol
---
Same thing happened to Monto on a recent vid, probably just bugged 
---
When is being confident in your abilities labeled as arrogant? 
---
That‚Äôs what I mean. 
---
And I think it could easily be balanced. You only get it when closing the book (or something). 
---
It‚Äôs a shot gun. Not a sniper rifle. So instant hit, but slightly longer than a lunge. 
---
Or with ass hole add ons, instant mori point blank shotgun. Dying state close range, injured state medium. Long is ineffective. 
---
(Maybe just one health state no matter range) 
---
We were literally gonna add that but my phone died right there
---
Darn. There go Ashy Slashy as killer memes I was cooking up...
---
...Or maybe not....
---
Angry pug is the only DBD streamer I‚Äôd rank even close to ochido in terms of being an asshole. 
---
tru3, when he loses, complains about the most random stuff. He ended up losing as killer, and claimed 'survivors are broken' and that they're 'all friends on discord'. None of them were friends. He just got out played and refuses to admit when it happens.
---
Skill wise? He's crazy good. When he loses? Different story
---
I thought they nerfed decisive strike..? 
---
Finish her!!! 
---
No, this was the game that got me to rank 1 actually
---
There has been no licensed free DLC. This will not be free. It will likely be $4.99, just like Leatherface.
---
Is Ash a survivor? Because he could kill any one of the killers.
---
Just fix the game 4Head
---
Oh, congrats m8. I wish there were rewards so this sort of thing mattered more 
---
Nurse with bamboozle
---
Should have recommended they use Deja Vu in the future
---
No perk is mandatory. The reason for it being in half of killer games is because of how crucial buying time is. 
---
I know, I just wanted to get there once (after the changes), but now I can go back to not care about ranks
---
"Ranks don't matter" - people in green ranks
---
Hell yeah, time for memebuilds
---
He is a survivor yes, tho he doesn't have any weapons on him. Plus even if he did, we have some suspension of disbelief for gameplay purposes.
---
Billy doesn't shoot survivors even tho he has a shotgun, Kate doesn't protect herself with her giant ice picks.
---
Done... at your request
---
Lol, I promise not as many people have totem spawns memorized as you suggest.
---
it was 7 cans of Mountain Dew
---
But, It's weird cus the first time she hit me I got 23 seconds mend time, and then 35, 54-65. Up until i was unable to finish it before she came back and stabbed me. It just increased in time..
---
Not really, if the survivors are good they will work through the ruin and won't even need to destroy it. If they genuinely struggle with ruin then chances are they're not really good.
---
And if they are good then they will easily find the ruin and make you essentially have 3 perks. It's better to run other perks against them in most situations.
---
I always knew the doc likes to watch.
---
Can't wait until I can have one.
---
I'll take good care of him every day and feed him pallets. &lt;3
---
it's not really a buff just a general QoL update. If you see my posts you'd see I post QoL updates for survivors too. if I suggest survivor buffs I get called a whiny survivor main. If I suggest Killer buffs I get called a crybaby killer. I play them both 50/50 I've hit rank 1 with both and have leveled most characters to level 50.
---
Disconnects, three person lobbies, people playing out of region and lag switchers. All this on top of a poorly executed matchmaking system. 
---
Throughout all the unnecessary matchmaking changes that have if anything only made things worse, they haven't even managed to fix bugged 3-player lobbies, let alone come up with solutions for infinite loading screens and less-than-4-player games. If their dedicated server project will be even only comparably as inadequate, it certainly has the potential to kill the game.
---
T2 aswell btw but a bit less.
---
Swedish thug dropkicks mentally ill man
---
I put that at the end of the post...
---
lol get hit
---
old DS
---
Fair enough, different things work for different people. It just comes across as lazy without that kind of context. Didnt mean to sound like an arrogant dick, but I totally did :-/
---
CAMPING FUCKING KILLERS LEARN HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. I‚ÄôM SO SICK OF GOING THROUGH AN ENTIRE MATCH, UNHOOKING THREE SURVIVORS, COMPLETING THREE GENS, LOOPING FOR FIVE MINUTES AND THEN GETTING DOWN BY NOED. LEARN. TO. PLAY.  
---
lololl
---
I personally just tab out if both exit gates are open and there's 1-2 uninjured survivors left, I'd be annoyed if you did this ;P
---
even if the thought is nice
---
it's gotten out of control and destroying the game for me and many others.
---
Does this Dlc has a killer??
---
I‚Äôm learning that Third Seal on puke lady is fucking nice. 
---
Both girls?
---
True. I tried playing survivor earlier. After waiting for ten minutes, myself and a team of other random rank 15-13‚Äôs got matched with a rank 2 Myers. Good times 
---
Spend most of my day at work. Then I come home to cook dinner and write for about two-three hours. Have about half an hour of free time before bed which is usually spent with the wife. 
---
Then I fall asleep dreaming of the weekend when I can play DBD. 
---
Yes
---
oh, no, instadown upset me as killer 
---
Love that bullshit argument "If the survivors are good.."
---
You can't argue speculation and scenarios you've created yourself. 
---
Ok fair point, but you know the old saying, put a gun on the wall in act 1, it better go off by act 2 or 3, otherwise it shouldn't be there.
---
I think i speak for all killer mains when i way i don't want survivors using shotguns on me anytime soon, we only just got rid of DS after all 
---
We likely aren‚Äôt getting a killer. 
---
Imagine if killers whined on about half the stupid shit salty survivors do lol  
---
"OMG i CANNOT BELIEVE you TUNNELED AND WORKED ON THE SAME GEN eVEN AFtER I JUST DAMAGED it you STUPID GEN TUNNELER so what if it was alMOST FINISHED and the OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME IS TO FINISH THe GENS EVERYBODY should have a CHANCE to 4k AND YOU'RE RUINING THAT"
---
Thought they would go for young Ash
---
We're both preaching to the choir.
---
 Honestly, you're not doing anything wrong. It *is absolutely* exhausting. They doing good, too, (like it's not their fault, per'se, for playing well.) but that doesn't make for a lot of fun.
---
Also the point about the skeleton key is I could use a brown toolbox with good addons. I could use a brown medkit with good addons. I could use a brown flashlight with good addons. I could give less than two shit what type of object I'm putting my addons onto. essentially the point is. Items are as "rare" as the killer ability is. you'll never not have it at any given time
---
As a survivor main, it‚Äôs really hard to trust Claudettes. They sometimes help, but a lot of the times they just screw you over... sometimes both in the same match. 
---
Damn, really? l had no idea. Thanks for the info!
---
I swear bricky encourages brain dead plays
---
what in the  
---
fuck
---
Oh snap! Thanks! Turns out.. I share my cake day with Eva Longoria.. 
---
Opinion: Whispers is garbage because at the start of the game every survivor spawns diagonal opposite of you so you know where they are, and at the end of the game i dont give a shit for hatch so its useless
---
Although this is funny, I‚Äôm pretty sure your neighbors just called the police
---
Eh, I've explained in other comments my argument for it not being higher. As a tl;dr, it's not difficult to bypass entirely, can get deleted in thirty seconds and is only really run because it's hard to find a reliable perk that effectively hurts generator progress.
---
Imagine complaining about the game on a friendly ash williams/laurie strode thread. 
---
Go for Huntress
---
Stop with the i think it does. Sorry but ive read every head on thread there is and the bottom line is its just janky fucking buggy hot trash. Ive lost count of the times it shoulda worked and just didnt. 
---
Because I suck at making jokes about what they did at the end.
---
Its a license so it will be for money, thats how it has been with the other licensed characters
---
That's what they said about undertale, and tf2, and overwatch, and league of legends. Every fandom's gonna have salt. Some dispproportionately more than others *cough* Dota *cough. Shit's more universally constant than gravity.
---
*laughs in irridescent stone*
---
Throughout the entire game, whenever you aren't in a chase, Whispers is a constant form of tracking that allows you to patrol generators faster, making killers with crappy map pressure benefit massively. 
---
Late game, I don't care for the hatch either, but that's precisely what makes Whispers great there. Hatch doesn't matter if you can find them and down them before they ever get to it as I prefer than just sitting on the hatch for hours.
---
Everything you listed has counterplay. Legion does not have counterplay from the survivor. Insta rev billy is strong but survivors can still counter it and the killer still needs to be able to pull of the chainsaw. 
---
Any idiot can use Legion and down the best survivor out there. 
---
If I bought legion I could let my little brother who hasnt even played this game play legion with sloppy butcher and bloodhound and I‚Äôd bet he‚Äôd still manage to get at least 1 kill at rank 1. Thats awful.  Legion is just terrible design. 
---
Im sorry but when I play survivor I‚Äôd like to be able to feel like I can control my fate somewhat during chase and try to outplay and mindgame the killer.
---
Apparently its not Dead, They‚Äôre doing a Switch Version with New Content that will be Backported to the Old Ones. So Content can resume now
---
Thats a good mindset. I saved 1 mil bloodpoints for the new chapter because i not only wanted to level up Jane for her teachables but after I got the teachables I had to max my feng min again because i have every perk for her
---
They are fun
---
Cuz if you ain't first, you're last.. 
---
Also seriously these needs to be pushed or stickied. The devs need to see this. This is by far the most ridiculous video of it failing i have seen. Everything about it was perfectly lined up and it failed. I lose so much faith in the devs man. Like they dont know wtf theyre doing at all
---
I seen scratch marks as a survivor once last night.
---
Its easily fixed, just make it based on terror radius, proximity and being in chase. So if a survivor is close enough to Legion their bar wont go down, if a survivor is in the terror radius of legion their bar wont go down AND if they‚Äôre in chase their bar wont go down. Moonwalking becomes literally impossible.
---
Where you playing as NEA? If so...
---
Is there only going to be a survivor drop? Or is there a killer coming too? Sorry, out of the loop 
---
Content is resuming, Its coming with the Switch Port and being backported to the other versions
---
Could you can't? Thank.
---
Well I slowed down the video frame by frame and looked at it and it seems like that‚Äôs what happens. The stun activates once you‚Äôre out of the locker so that you have time to escape while the killer is stunned. From what I‚Äôve seen from this video, just because the killer is in position to be stunned doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt move out of the way before they get stunned. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs not buggy, but I don‚Äôt think this here was a bug, just awkward timing. They‚Äôre probably going to buff it‚Äôs range to make it easier to use, just like they had to buff dead hard after it first came out. 
---
Haha, I wish I was at that moment. Was playing Jane (:
---
Lonely life where I'm either working (researcher/part-time teacher) or desperately trying to finish my PhD thesis. Occasionally I'll go to a hockey game or play Pathfinder. That's about it. 
---
My favorite is insta-heal build. Autodidact, empathy, spine chill, adrenaline and medkit with an insta-heal. Really fun
---
licenced killers and survivors are very hit and miss with me,
---
ashley is a huge miss 
---
You need a job on the dev team with ideas like this. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it just a specific combination of perks and add ons. I was playing kill my friends and my friend played with a specific legion build, making mending like 3 minutes. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bug, it‚Äôs just broken mechanics. 
---
someBODY once told me
---
Tru3 at least explains the game and try‚Äôs to understand it and show the audience why he is doing what he is doing. Also he will talk to his non subs as well. Pig is just a drunk who communicates to subs only and never talks about the fundamentals of any game. The definition of a sore loser.
---
It felt dumb, yet I was smiling the whole time. Take your silly upvote.
---
Bill is free and licensed. Hoprfully it‚Äôll be the same for Ash, and if he isnt im gonna buy him anyway
---
There was a bug where Bloodwarden would show survivor's auras if they were near the exit gates, even though the generators weren't done. It happened to me as Killer once, I was checking an area that I was pretty sure had a survivor. Then I spotted the neon red aura of an injured Adam Francis probably 30 meters away. He was hiding in the corner where the wall meets the exit gates. He went down before he even had a chance to run- I think he was stunned that I spotted him. 
---
I feel sort of bad because I would have *never* found him if not for the bug. He tried using the Diversion perk where you throw stone while I was running in a straight line for him. He didn't even try to run. Anyway, this story has basically no relevance since this was patched like 4 days ago. 
---
"you probably deserve it" So you wish people ill on a poorly conceived possibility? All because of a petty argument over a game? You're pathetic. Lmao
---
Also, I act like I'm better than you for one very good reason: I am. 
---
Yep this perk is frustrating to use and sucks. The only use would be to prevent basement hooks yet the locker isnt even close enough to do that I dont think. Its such a buggy piece of trash which makes all the restrictions on it even more annoying. Its a god damn exhaustion perk and needs 3 seconds to activate....
---
It would be worth running if it could activate even while exhausted (like adrenaline) so you could at least run another exhaustion perk and use head on only when necessary.
---
Its cool that it gives survival points which makes me want to keep using it more but its just so bad.
---
Outside the grassy window of the basement shack 
---
It's because you can see them. It doesn't matter what perks killers use if its meta it will be hated on. It varies though. If someone learns how to deal with certain perks its okay, it's players that can't win if you run a certain perk and they don't like that I guess. 
---
Oh... Sounds pleasant. 
---
Tru3 can tend to whine about a lot of things but he still plays fair.
---
I don't think legion is fun to play as. Playing against them isnt as bad as they make it out to be because good killers usually wont use legion. 
---
It‚Äôs even worse that you were running good perks, expecting survivors who actually play the game. Just made it overkill damn
---
Even better: Bring a shroud of seperation and watch how they disconnect because you brought a hidden item. It doesn't work as often as the green mori but when it does, it's hilarious.
---
Good or not, if you check and disarm the trap. I'm now on my way. 
---
Also you've never heard the expression, "if it looks dumb but it works, it's not dumb" have you? 
---
Yeah, I know. It was on Gideon Meat Plant too lmao. 
---
Then you better have the Luck Offering
---
I feel like distressing's effect is so unique and useful for many strange builds, it should probably be C tier
---
I will place a trap at the 'cabin' and that single trap will move from the window, to the pallet drop and to a random grassy side and every single time I will catch someone.
---
This happens to me. I quit for a week and come back. Its sad toxic people drive killers off the game but they want to win no matter what. 
---
I can only imagine their confusion at what the spirit can do too, as a high rank killer I bet you could read them perfectly lol
---
The perk synergy of Distressing can be great and as a Doctor main I of course love it. However the effectiveness is limited on any killer with a TR less than 32m except for Legion (and even then, just run M&amp;A). I can see it having use for Doctor and massive TR Myers, on other killers it's just not worth running it with other perks and taking up multiple slots to make it useful.
---
Haha, I pulled 2 of them off gens, which is strange since I wasn‚Äôt using prayer beads. I knew they had to be really low rank when I did that. 
---
Yea working through ruin is not hard and totem spawns are just garbage (at least for me) so i kinda agree with that. I personally just hate hex perks in general.
---
Using a strategy isn‚Äôt toxic, even if unfun for your opponent. The same way flashlight saves aren‚Äôt toxic, just annoying
---
It‚Äôs a thing in the community now to dc thanks to you tubers being toxic, I only do it for tunneling or campers but people have started doing it just when they get pissed the YouTube community has fucked up the game. 
---
Only idiits bitch about bbq. Its strong its not broken

Totally. There‚Äôs a complete tone switch here in regards to how BHVR is treating this DLC. To the more fourth wall breaking trailer, and the care and detail in Ash‚Äôs model and cosmetics.
---
It almost makes me wonder if Evil Dead came to BHVR and not the other way around this time. Sign of DBD getting more mainstream?
---
By your logic everything not fun for the other side is toxic. It‚Äôs a competitive game, the killer is going to use any means to achieve his goal and vice versa. If someone‚Äôs camping a slugged survivor that‚Äôs even better than a camped hook survivor
---
The survivor can choose where to go, doesn‚Äôt lose a hook state and can get themselves free with certain perks. If they‚Äôre not camping the bodies, just pick them up but keep an eye out
---
Repeated slugging only leads to the killer not getting rewarded for downing due to no sacrifice progress, and if they can get the 4K in this method then good on them. It‚Äôs not fun to be camped, slugged and tunneled the same way that it‚Äôs not fun to be looped, have hooks broken in your face and losing all your downs due to flashlight saves (Which is one reason slugging is a thing)
---
All these methods have counter strategies and perks, none of them are inherently toxic. If you hate slugging that much use the counters
---
You can go to the game's subreddit to confirm this isn't true and they still don't have rights to make content for this game.
---
Who the fuck complains about self care? Adrenaline is just annoting to me tbh, but who complains about selfcare being toxic?
---
Yea i kept the File just for that, If anyone knows the 100% correct spelling please tell me :D
---
On higher ranks, it's mandatory because it yields you an additional 30 - 60 seconds which is crucial. Games end way too fast without it. Unless, ofc, you're playing nurse or billy, but not everyone wants to play those.
---
Which ones do you enjoy? I love all of them. :P
---
Dont think about what they can do to you with a shotgun think about what you could do with a shotgun 
---
I had a survivor report he thought I was running rancor. Got all the perks, none of the cons.
---
And yet here we are. With authentic Bruce campbell grunts, screams and pants.
---
I like your thinking
---
Also buff hillbilly, he needs a shotty
---
I guess the rumor that every console survivor sucks is true. 
---
I had people complain about slugging while theyre healing the downed person infront of me. Am i supposed to hook them even though i know i can get a double?
---
I always reset them on windows. I had the same window trap catch 5 people. That means someone did it twice lol. 
---
Ash better have a bunch of one-liners that he says in game against the killer, or it's not worth it.
---
I want to slam a pallet down on the killer and hear Bruce Campbell's voice say something like "swallow that she-bitch!"
---
We already know their working on it tho
---
The guy in charge said when their lawsuit started that there wouldn‚Äôt be new content no matter the outcome
---
It doesn't matter how much points they get for wasting both their times: Both would get more if they just give the other side the hatch/ the kill. (Well not right now, since you can take up to 1 hour to find a match, but I think we can both agree that hatchstandoffs were there long before these issues) Hatchstandoffs usually aren't even about the points, it's mostly about the ego. Both sides feel entitled to get the free escape /kill and neither side wants to give this free escape/ kill to the other side and they don't have a reason do so (besides saving their time). And even if it's one of the rare cases that the standoff is not about ego but actually about points for both sides, neither the killer nor the survivor has a reason to just give up their points so the other person can get theirs. 
---
Unbreakable? I usually mever get slugged long enough to use it but when i do its handy. I also dont have a lot of great perks. 
---
Of course not man. Just don't listen to nonsense!
---
People are finding it so hard to rank up under the new pip system they‚Äôve given up altogether, and don‚Äôt care about their pips
---
*Unhooks or gets a purple flashlight 
---
Groovy 
---
I have been getting games where it seems like 1 or 2 survivors are both running object of obsession when there isn't even a obsession in play... Bad for them since i haven't hear it work the other way round.
---
is that so? but for the amount of quits since last month it basicly go up by such a great amount i doubt even youtubers can do just that so quickly any other ideas?
---
You know what? I'll say it.  
---
NOED is A-tier at best. Much like Ruin, it's very easily countered, and without also using Blood Warden, a killer can really struggle to get more than one kill with it.
---
Thats a great idea. We would need a spreading buckshot and if even one pellet hits you its a stun. 
---
It feels like the latest updates have brought out toxicity in everyone. 
---
["bhvr"](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/944/564/6dc.jpg)
---
Good to know which one of them dies
---
+ Using instinct to track which has a very real chance of failing
---
or
---
+ using a perk provided to you that not only gives you good tracking but also bonus BP.
---
Yeah, i wonder which one the smart killer uses.
---
They had free original killers in the ultimate edition. Just not anything licensed.

---
Ikr? i have 850 hours roundabout in the game and easily 700 if not 800 of them are as killer, i still fucking SUCK at predicting where survivors are going to go without tracking perks.
---
people always saying x is on last legs:) but there is a system but its like 40% of total ever games left.... also known as good luck getting to it as if u played at least 100 hours or so thats (say 3 games per hour more likely 4-5) thats 120 out of 300 games... its basiclly impossible to get it:( unless u are the salt lord incarnate and somehow leave every game for a month...
---
i see that would make sense
---
I believe he sees at his hands in guilt at what he's done when he sees all the blood 
---
Yet they can release entirely new Versions of the Game:
---
[livestream on switch version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7DlbHT1QE) 
---
If they don't DC then you can max out 3 of the 4 BP categories by just playing. Lets  you farm lots of BP even if you lose or have a bad game.
---
i was hopeful replaying the tutorial would give me 50000 bp each time. I can confirm it doesn't work. 
---
Easy to get lots of bp as legion, and they‚Äôre pretty fun to play as.
---
3 of them did dc at least maybe your right about the last one or maybe he did dc ( i tabbed out as i hooked him so)
---
I would say just create some kind of micro transactions,if it helps the game then why not ....maybe by shards with money ? Or new moris ? If it helps them to get this mess fixed then why the fuck not ? At least people would stop getting the excuse of "they create dlc for profit"
---
credit to u/Darkwing_Dork for the idea. Let the memes roll.
---
One word : ART
---
Clowns have to tunnel. Have you played the man? he has to use bottle throws just to catch people. 
---
[removed]
---
Nea has had ENOUGH
---
they just aren‚Äôt and people make solo queuing out to be WAAAAY harder than it really is as a survivor. if you play average, you will rank up and gain points. it‚Äôs not that hard to loop
---
The killers have been spot on, the survivors are another story.
---
*when you don't even edit the image to make it DBD related*
---
*cough* Bill
---
Nothing in this game is "mandatory". The fact remains that ruin is one of the strongest and most useful perks. 
---
JUST BOUGHT THE PIG FOR 4 DOLLARS AND I REALLY WANT TO PLAY AS HER BECAUSE SHE IS MY FAV. 3 DC'S AND LAST SURVIVOR LET ME HAVE A PITY KILL :(
---
I just cry.
---
Hey look it's that dude from Poker night 2!! why is he wearing a vault suit?
---
Thanks, I hate it. 
---
Shit, Im saving this to copy and send in my killer-games :D 
---
Well they said they had improved the totem locations in favor of the killer xD
---
Leatherface because he doesn't have a pair too. /s
---
Can someone explain what is so bad about leatherface.. and how the hillbillys chainsaw (i'm assuming what this is about) is superior?
---
They wouldn't be mad that you're getting extra BP, they'd be mad because of the very useful info B&amp;C gives the Killer. Obviously they are ignoring the numerous counters for it though, so they don't really have any reason to bitch.
---
It's been confirmed Ash is solo.
---
Fucking hell, I didn't expect to see Eastenders here.
---
i enjoy most of them, leatherface was a bit of a miss for me when he first came out. I did end up buying the dlc for the black and blue cosmetic. The saw dlc also was a bit of a miss when it first came out, and i still question whether i enjoy playing pig or not. i guess it can come down to if i got knowledge and enjoyment from the series, im not the biggest horror fan but i have watched halloween, nightmare on elm street n' friday the 13th 2-4. But honestly if it was not for poker night at the inventory 2, i would have no idea who ash was. While i knew about leatherface and amanda before they were introduced as killers despite not having watched the movies.
---
I believe it's caused by stacking both add-ons that increase the mending time. Instead of stacking properly for a fixed time, it increases every time you are hit with Frenzy.
---
It's possible he may be obtainable with Shards, seeing as he is the first licensed character since the Store was introduced.
---
JUst cLeNze ToTuMz
---
unrealistic, that does not look like a flashlight in his hand
---
I know right?? I was like tf
---
I'm actually really eager to see what happens, especially with the puppet.
---
I really like it on Wraith, he doesn't suffer from the normal downside but still gets amazing points. It also makes the bell range massive which can be really confusing for survivors.
---
I don‚Äôt mind that, I hate that he can just walk off two feet and stand still and be completely invisible so if they wanna camp the hook they‚Äôre the best at it.
---
Higher quality product. Like much much higher. It's like eating steak at restaurant (Nendo) vs eating that rough piece of meat you cooked yourself (Funko). There's no bleeding paints on Nendos. 
---
Customisability.  You can give it different look / clothes / accessories. Most Nendoroids come with additional item like face plates for different emotion. 
---
Poseability. You can have more than one pose of your bored with your current one. The figures got joints on body, arms and legs which make it easy to pose for.
---
Seems legit
---
Take him out for some ice cream. He's earned it
---
I save my DCs on 3 gen hostage doc,prayer beads and Legion. So far it's doing pretty well, didn't have to face most of the bs in the game for quite a while.
---
It made no sense and was really awkward.
---
I believed laughed too hard at this.
---
That would be a sick gamemode. Four killers trying to stop an overpowered Ash.
---
Watch Zubat or ScottJund play killer, you'll almost never see Adrenaline triggered in their games. Adrenaline is good if you happen to be in a chase/slugged for sure, but it's a late game perk. The risk of never getting to 5 gens completed is very much warranted.
---
Most of the time when I see it used you are full hp and just get the short speedboost.
---
Not if I having anything to say about it and I do. I'm gonna say the n-word.
---
Never watch Monto, we‚Äôre just doing a mini sandbag tourny with friends 
---
You deserve an Oscar for this
---
And at least 1 million karma 
---
Who do you think his killer will be?
---
#THAT'S ILLEGAL! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!!!
---
Really awesome! Thanks for lighting my day up :D
---
Bubba's chainsaw has a lot of counterplay (vaults, lockers, pallets to an extent) and no other redeeming factors. Billy's chainsaw has similar counterplay in chases, but you can use it to sprint across the map in seconds.
---
I like the meme. 
---
I've read why you put Adrenaline there and imo I wouldn't even bother with trying to avoid getting acused of being biased on this sub. You'll get called -/- main whenever you argue something is unbalanced. Just go with how you feel about things and try to be open to reasonable ideas c:
---
You mean Louise Belcher. Killer instantly leaves lobby
---
Now that's a high effort meme.
---
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNIIIIIIIIIIBBBBBBBBAAAAAA
---
I have nothing towards you for doing what you are doing. If you want to keep doing I am in no position to tell you not to do it.
---
I'm just saying that there are better ways of doing it, and that "if it looks dumb but it works, it's not dumb" is bad reasoning for things.
---
Was Freddy not after pig? 
---
No Clown was after pig :P
---
Ah I see, cheers. Does Billy's break pallets like Bubba's?
---
Normally I hate this level of cringe but maybe I've just spent too much time as the Hag. One tip: the hand needs to be more limp.
---
wow..
---
I'm a university student studying medicine. I spend most of my weekdays traveling &amp; studying with the weekend being my only free time to play dead by daylight.
---
P3 huntress here and by god that shot was golden. Love your setup. looks exactly like mine except I run Stridor as my fourth. Though Surviellance is great now (hitting survivors working on gens is fun) and apparently Iron Maiden is awesome for the fast reload. Have yet to test. 
---
But also... console will never let me make an equivalent shot ;___; 
---
ESPECIALLY IN CHASE AND YOU DIDNT REALISE YOU BUMPED IT AND NOW YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE GROUND AND THEN THE KILLER CATCHES YOU BECAUSE YOU PANICKED
---
You know a killer is hated when survivors and killers work together to fight the real evil...the entity itself laughs at survivor frustration of having to mend again and again 
---
This is actually leaked gameplay from the dbd's switch release.
---
Honestly I could believe that. As much as I enjoy Evil Dead. It's not one of the giants of horror like most the licensed DLC has been.
---
I completely agree with what you're saying. It's just the sheer amount of bugs that are currently in the game. I doubt that many players would mind if they broke the schedule of two characters, six new perks and new map to focus on fixing and optimizing their game to iron out at least just a few of the bugs. Even if it was as simple as trying to fix the endless loading bug, the crashes, players would raise their arms up in praise for the developers.
---
But as it stands all it feels to be to many is that the developers just want to squeeze money through skins, and new characters and killers - as they've ignored all these bugs that are in the game so far. 
---
They need to drop the schedule of new chapters (Killers and Survivors and maps) to put as many resources as they can into fixing the game before players start leaving fast. 
---
Is *content* resuming, or is development continuing? Because they've still been pushing out updates ever since the content stopped. If *content* is resuming, then are we finally gonna get Uber Jason and the Grendel? 
---
darn
---
Without a doubt not intended.
---
Iridescent stone is a pure evil
---
so what happens when me European and my murican friend play SWF? will it find a lobby based on the lobby host or randomly?
---
Confirmed to be paid: https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1111456664446779392

Maybe some of his cosmetics will be available for Shards.

---
My favorite is the heavy smoker nurse, 1 blink with as much fatigue as possible 
---
&gt;Remember when Bill dropped with a ton of free cosmetics?
---
what?
---
I completely agree. I played today with my friend and I loaded in, found a gen and heard the skill check and that‚Äôs when I realised, I had loaded in without any of the details on the screen. I couldn‚Äôt see the other survivors, I couldn‚Äôt see perks, I couldn‚Äôt see totem timers when cleansing, skill checks, etc. My game also told me I didn‚Äôt have any internet connection and kicked me, although I was still in my party chat? It tends to happen after new updates and then eventually smooths out (as best as it can smooth out, that is), but it sucks because I just want to play the new additions! I love playing DBD.
---
they could also add the option to turn off voice acting for those who only like grunts!
---
Nope, nice try, I'm not watching a Paulie Esther video 
---
It's pretty much impossible for me to play survivor. Takes 13 years to find a game only for it to be 300 ping 
---
I *demand* Steven Spielberg see this &amp; give them a damn movie to make.
---
Unlikely, because Feng Min's customisables aren't separated like that. 
---
The Dev's lore means fuck all at this point.
---
To them, lore means "making something up to fit our current narrative".
---
**It Belongs In The Louvre**
---
Welcome to dbd friend
---
Well it didnt at all, but I do agree they should take a chapter of
---
DLC later on maybe?
---
Would be nice to have alt outfits for licensed survivors, maybe Bruce will be the 1st.
---
Love how you throw your rank in there like some badge of honour.
---
Now I know who the survivors that I face are. Its safe to say everyone from this point on will be getting 1 shot hatchet mori face camped from now on
---
I believe its only The Plague.
---
Same things with anal beads addon for spirit
---
when you've had enough of the killers bullshit
---
Lots of people are saying you should‚Äôve let her just have it but with the new pip system it‚Äôs way too unreliable to assume you got more than a safety pip. If she sees you on the hatch there‚Äôs gens to 99% and then pop, then there‚Äôs three possible exit points. 
---
The survivor has the power after they locate the hatch and know the killer is waiting there, but many don‚Äôt choose to use it
---
Are you sure it's the Clown and not your team doing things that would result in the Clown chasing after the same person?
---
Shotgun would be same as Huntress.
---
Just add a delay to ADS and it's the same....but with shorter range than Huntress 
---
Don't forget to gut your friend
---
It's based off the new show with an older Bruce, who is kind of chubby now.
---
literally _nothing_
---
and when i‚Äôm on the receiving end i don‚Äôt tbag or do anything stupid yet still clowns apparently don‚Äôt have the ability to process that target switching is your best bet to win
---
"Groovy"
---
Same thing happened to me, randomly getting stuck on a tree. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the survivor equivalent of when killers could get stuck inside pallets
---
Hopefully when Behaviour get money from the new licensed DLC they can fix more bugs like this in patches 
---
If he had an actual distinquishable trait from all other R1killers he‚Äôd be fine. Most of the time his opinions are garbage and he contributes nothing. Hell I make better plays than him (R1 rn) but I just don‚Äôt publish it, like???
---
Would it be what they looked like pre-whatever turned them into a killer? Cause that would be pretty neat
---
yes
---
Exactly üíØ that's the idea
---
That would be really neat, wonder what wraith looked like before he got those bone extensions
---
Hex: GOLDEN LOCKS
---
Just started leveling hag (need to slow the game down       ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) ) so this got a good giggle outta me
---
HAHAHA BABY KILLER EZZZ XD.
---
Every end game chat after this perk is released 
---
It‚Äôs about the bloodpoints but go off. 
---
I mean... everyone has a bad game here and there, and everyone makes excuses and such at some points.  I can‚Äôt judge a man just because he‚Äôs a popular streamer for doing the same shit that many people do every minute
---
In fact, I‚Äôd say at the level he plays, I‚Äôm surprised he doesn‚Äôt rage at everything.   
---
Was it proven that they weren‚Äôt swf? At any rate, if a team is that good or just got lucky, I‚Äôd assume the same thing. 
---
Any way, I‚Äôd say overall he gets a pass from me for being a damn good player and a level headed one (most of the time) and explains many things he does. Also actually has decent opinions on the games meta (even if some folks don‚Äôt like his opinion)
---
Compared to many of the other toxic ass hats in the streaming community, I can‚Äôt believe anyone would hate on tru3 over them lol 
---
I‚Äôll have to watch that real quick and I‚Äôll get back to you, give me a little time lol
---
Spot on, but there's also two additional things to consider:
---
1. Insta-down Killers like Hillbilly, Myers and Leatherface can potentially ignore the perk altogether (3 hits, 3 hooks).
---
2. You can negate the perk through camping.
---
These two points taken together mean, should the perk become meta, there's going to be a marked increase in face-camping Leatherfaces 
---
One of the few times where I agree with killer-complaints here.
---
The perk is fine vs strong killers (so the top 5) but everything else gets directly affected really hard.
---
I hate how killers are allowed to have strong perks but any of the high tier survivor ones have to be nerfed into oblivion. The same kind of people who want adrenaline nerfed.
---
So it's only the survivor? No killer? 
---
Is your barber still alive? 
---
Geil
---
Awful players looking for an excuse, imagine there are unironically people who think BBQ is overpowered.
---
Yeah, ds + unbreakable (and maybe tenacity) seems like a good build for "another chance"
---
&gt;Watch Zubat or ScottJund play killer, you'll almost never see Adrenaline triggered in their games.
---
I can imagine them not uploading all their games, but rather upload the good/entertaining ones.
---
I'm not gonna watch video's from people. I know how to protect gens, but I play off meta killers and adrenaline is a nightmare especially for the nightmare
---
Don‚Äôt forget spirit
---
It's a cheap perk that makes the game easier for you and allows you to play worse. Ofc a lot of people run it.
---
But the perk is shit, if you can't deal with it as surv you're shit.
---
That's the thing. They knew why DS was bad but created this perk anyway.
---
Downvoted for telling people not to DC.
---
This sub, honestly.
---
imagine we get a bunny Nea instead and only that
---
Enduring, Spirit Fury, then 2 of whatever you want.
---
Unfortunately if your reflex is that strong there might not be much you can do other than muting the whole game, they don't allow for custom manipulation of various in game sounds as they could create an unfair advantage (think how easily an injured survivor could be chased/found with no chase music) definitely nothing to be done about the animation. As far as refunds go? Do you mean for The Plague DLC? Or the whole game itself? Unfortunately I doubt in either case you could get a refund but I imagine the DLC would be more likely than the entirety of the game. As scummy as it is you could just DC against the Plague especially if your reflex is this strong.
---
Honestly I'd think DS + Unbreakable + Tenacity would be too many perks, since all you'd really have room for would be Lithe/Balanced Landing and couldn't take Self Care or something else.
---
I'd personally go for Tenacity so that you can crawl to another player while recovering, but I think Unbreakable would probably be the better choice.
---
Most likely not, 
---
Trapper is almost a copy of Jason
---
Story and gameplay wise 
---
Both have masks, machetes and use bear traps, maybe a Jason skin but probably never a chapter/paragraph
---
Very fun and interacting game, I vote 10/10 flashlights.
---
Me: *slaps on an ebony mori*
---
*Streamer in a SWF squad shows up*
---
Streamer: HOW DARE YOU USE A MORI JUST BECAUSE I‚ÄôM A STREAMER YOU TOXIC FUCK
---
The argument is kinda time spaced as Ochido removed some videos that were aimed towards Tru3, I think where Tru3 messed up is by leaving the video on YouTube. 
---
leatherface, they usually camp. I do the same to keep the stereotype alive
---
You could cosplay as her?
---
I'd be talking about the whole game: I never bought the Plague DLC. The game simply is unplayable for me as a survivor whenever I'm against the Plague, and disconnecting does not feel fair for either my friends, the randoms that I end up with or the killer.
---
Nea launches a surprise attack from the top rope, catching a distracted Leatherface off guard as he gets the crowd chanting "Camp or die", during Wrestlemania by Daylight. 
---
I prefer to play on a 24in monitor over anything else. 
---
hank east
---
Can we get some F‚Äôs for our fallen brother 
---
Well that seemed really fun /s
---
&gt; Trapper is almost a copy of Jason
---
Couldn't you have said the same thing about HillBilly and Leatherface, though? And I mean, we have The Clown but I'm willing to bet money we're gonna get Pennywise before the years out.
---
Not saying I don't agree with the assessment, just that I don't agree with it being a reason he should be left out.
---
Gameplay, somewhat. Stories are completely different though
---
Yes! It makes it almost impossible to play! Usually shows up in 3/10 games for me. 
---
What
---
Feels like the match making is worse now
---
Dev has her personal Twitter and the DBD Twitter on her phone and posted from the wrong one.  She corrected it on her personal. 
---
Similar, both Jason and Evan Macmillan(trapper) idol their parents, Jason his mother and Evan his father 
---
Honestly, as someone who gets 200+ ping constantly It's pretty normal. I've had matches with killers who had over 1,000 ping too (i'm from US, my int is 200mb/s) 
---
All I really care about is preventing lag switchers from cheating. I dont run into them often but they are a special kind of stupid that I will be glad to be rid of. 
---
Dedicated servers are sorely needed and I'm glad its finally happening 
---
Somethings better than nothing.
---
HE'S GONNA SAY ITTTTTTTTT!
---
Literally everybody is about to be Ash
---
This is the first response I can get behind. Moonwalking is scummy as fuck. Legion is honestly like Doctor back in the day. It forces players to find new ways to play against the Killer. The Franks add-on is no different from other add-ons Killers have to make the game easier for themselves. 
---
Legion has counter play, no one wants to learn it and would rather d/c and find a Killer that plays the way they're used to.
---
I await being down voted into oblivion.
---
Ash should have been a killer instead
---
The most OP build?!?! The most OP killer?!?! 
---
First off: Legion is terrible without franks mixtape. Saying a killer is s tier because of one add on is the same as saying trapper is A tier with his pinks.
---
Secondly: "Most OP build" my ass. He's using yellow add ons and thanatophobia ffs.
---
I‚Äôve always loved fan concepts
---
Well, we're talking perks and their relationship to balance. Perks are the main tool of survivors. So if we're to discuss what perks are too strong, we also have to look at what they were used for and what the devs intended for them to be used for. Which means looking at what killers had that was so strong that made it so survivors were too dependant on a single broken perk to win. This isn't the type of game where everything exists in a vaccume. 
---
This bitch empty, YEET
---
I really cant tell what his thinking
---
#BATTER UP!
---
Well I guess I'm shit out of luck in getting a game any time other than prime time. Last night was hell getting into a game less than 150 ping. Killer games always take too long and it's got players with 150 ping that don't wanna play that high.
---
I think that would be a cool. Killer before they were killers skins. Honestly I think having them seem normal could end up being more terrifying.
---
then they need to remove swf because this is a most game breaking thing. no?
---
I RECENTLY HAD A NURSE GAME WHERE ALL THE GENS WERE IN THE WHEAT OR 5 METERS FROM IT COULDN'T SEE ANYONE AND KILLED ONLY ONE BECAUSE THEY GOT COCKY REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Controversial suggestion, but I would just leave, if I am slugged. This way my teammate can get the hatch. 
---
If someone else is slugged and they are not DCing, I will carefully pick them up, get killer's attention and take him/her to the other side of the map away from the injured person. Then I will leave the game. 
---
That's the only option if you want someone to have a chance for a hatch. 
---
Kawaii Bubba ftw 
---
So cringe, but I laughed.
---
IKR? I think this is why Campbell is the best horror movie actor.
---
NOED GANG FTW
---
Clown isn‚Äôt a copy of Pennywise... He is based off the irl killer and I think rapist, Pogo the Clown. It‚Äôs like how LF is based off that Gien guy from Texas that skinned people and was obsessed with his mother.

Put the kid down for bed and stay up way later then I should on a workday while the wife watches tv next to me on the couch
---
I hate and love this. Have an upvote... make more please.
---
Honestly, and this is the genuine reason, is because they feel slighted by other killers, either though bm, camping, etc. They want to give it back so they return the toxicity to someone who wasn‚Äôt involved
---
Could you tell me what multiplayer game doesnt have a toxic players?
---
r/cringe
---
I DON'T WANT PICTURES OF BUGS! I WANT PICTURE OF NEEEAAAA!
---
Good grief 
---
Love daddy myers, had one last night scare the crap out of me... heard him T2 and then not long after down and hook someone. My friend says he will go in for the save and I stay on my gen... 
---
We were in yamaoka estate... after finishing my gen took about 25 more seconds I go to run to my right and swing my camera to my left to look behind me and there he is in a bush up to his chest just watching... made me jump also he was infinite T3 myers... my bad team I'm sorry I'm a potato and fed him so much.
---
Daddy myers scared me and drained me. 
---
I hate it so much, and I think that's why I have more fun being friendly pig that gets her points and lets everyone live. People seem happy, and I hope that they go into the next game in the same mood. 
---
I get next to no points in these matches-- not even enough to pip, and most of the time a depip. I just don't do well with everyone always being angry. 
---
A dizzying blow to body and brain!
---
He already is ;)
---
Im always ready to violate
---
What killers have you been losing to?
---
Man, they somehow made her uglier.
---
wow okay i see you're an entitled survivor main, i'm out
---
Both are very similiar characters actually. They can be quite creative during crisis times and are seemingly impossible to kill.
---
always bring a Mori for the Streamers and feel free to Stream-snipe.
---
I mean really, what do they expect when they gut their twitch name....its not like any of the other survivors or the Killer will want to watch their stream
---
FBI, leave this guy alone please
---
What the fuck did i just witness?
---
hope he is free like Bill
---
word and how long it takes to find a match.  Might as well 4 man up so that you can at least have a decent game
---
I hope he is free like Bill
---
Jesus christ
---
I played against the Streamer last night, I actually tried and I joined the stream to tell them good game, it was all good. Fast forward to the present and I stabbed them with FF a few times, hooked a couple times but when I came across the steamer I stopped and wiggled around, didn't chase him. I let him see me but stalked him like Meyers, I even took one to the exit gate on the third down and let all of them escape. Post game they just said that I was moonwalking him and one said I was being nice because I'm a Legion player and I haven't had any sexual contact ever or something along those lines. (streamer was obsession.) I stood at the exit gate and let them go by me.) letting them crawl out instead of picking them up. One t-bagged me at a pallet stun too. Broke my heart.
---
Freddy does not like this perk
---
If you have an nvidia card use freestyle. Can brighten up the game a bit.
---
You don‚Äôt lose a pip if you plug. Cause and effect of a shitty emblem system. You have to play immaculate to get a pip and almost anything de pips.
---
Tombstone Myers at Memorial? De pip
---
Teammates suck? De pip
---
Nurse? De pip
---
Spirit? De pip
---
Billy? De pip
---
Get unlucky and killer spawns on top of you and downs you quickly? De pip
---
Game starts with 3 survivors? De pip
---
Gen rushed? no pip
---
Didn‚Äôt do 2-3 generators, 6 unhooks and loop the killer for 5 minutes in a 40 minute game? No pip
---
List goes on and on
---
I main the Hag, actually. 
---
The more I think about the F13 timeline, the more I'm glad it got that 09 reboot
---
I mean you would be right in that Leatherface was the inspiration for Hillbilly, same can be said for Jason and Trapper though. But I do agree they could add Jason in, I mean Leatherface and Hillbilly both use a Chainsaw and a Mallet but have different powers. For Jason they could do something completely different from Trapper even if he also uses a Machete, the big issue would be coming up with a new power that suits Jason cus most of what he can do is already used by other killers (eg bear traps (duh), teleportation, stalking) or isn't something you could turn into a game mechanic (eg immortality)
---
i wish i could unsee your other reddit posts
---
You're missing the point where my pig was newly prestiged and I threw on what I was given.
---
Please read everything before leaving a snarky comment. :)
---
They stream live on twitch. Nothing else. 
---
Scott doesn't even upload videos on youtube anymore.
---
Scott played speed limiter LF for like 35 games and got adrenaline popped like twice. [Here.](https://youtu.be/v8XcQoJHauA). They play weak killers too.
---
Don't look then, sweets. 
---
Same
---
That probably would've been better lol
---
Yeah, Mettle of Man's going to be the breaking point for me playing Doc, which is a shame since I find him quite fun, and he was my first killer.  In fact it may be the breaking point for me on Killer entirely since i don't much care for Huntress or the Chainsaw bros, and I'm not sure if I want to go through the beating to learn Nurse out of her being the only remaining killer I'm interested in that isn't 100% screwed by MoM.
---
I just want to know why we got DS 2.0.
---
It is why we are playing against rank 1 o shit
---
Ruin, NOED, Franklins, Bamboozle :)
---
get memed on Survivors haHAA
---
When I play regular games, this is pretty much my mindset-- that said, I also have 'break games' where I switch off whoever I'm playing to be a friendly pig, because sometimes it just gets too rough. :( 
---
But yeah, I get it. People are just jerks to each other because they think they should be the one on the winning team, and you're def right about those made up rules. 
---
I respect the no tunneling, but only because it's usually less effective. Better to have an injured, and a chase at the same time. 
---
I‚Äôd say pose Nea in a better pose rather than have her just standing there; otherwise it‚Äôs cool
---
Might've been running filthy blade, but I dunno. I did a match against a legion who was afk farming and it seemed to take forever. It was actually faster to be mended by teammates. 
---
Some assholes in the comments calling this cringe. It‚Äôs funny and all I see are a few young lads having fun, why are you judging? They probably just wish they were a kid again tbh haha
---
On that topic, MAN I can't wait for a Trapper buff. If I use any addons other than bag+setting tools, then I feel so slow and useless, it's not funny.

Amanda was January of 2018.

Ancient game, but gears of war 2 basically removed the option to leave a match they straight up removed the buttons for leave match from the start menu. 
---
The region lock is terrible
---
Continuing to stalk even in T3 on some guy opening an exit just to give them anxiety.
---
WAAAAT?! EVERYBODY CHEATS!!! NEXT TIME I CHEAT TOO!!
---
I agree with a lot of this. It's hard to try out builds that you know probably won't win you the game-- but could be fun. There's so many gimmick builds that look super fun/spooky that I personally haven't tried because they don't work for my serious, or 'break' games. But I have taken to my 'everyone goes to the basement' build, I just have to get all the perks back since I prestiged. :(
---
The only reason I can do it is because I tell myself it's a loss, but I'll probably still get loaded with points because of BBQ. 
---
That said, Piggy is my favorite killer to play, and people generally commend me on playing her for my more serious games. (Or they're extremely angry about it.) But she's not as good as the other killers for sure, and there's a lot of times where I know that I lost because she's just not able to do things other killers can. 
---
But, man, do I love it when people do call out the toxic survivor, and continue to be against them. 
---

Red vomit is hatchets that you can't juke or miss, that's why it's on a timer, it's really strong. But I agree with the rest, the movespeed nerf really hurt her - now it feels like she has to play much better to get the same results as before.
---
I'm telling you, take away their bloodpoint rewards for 1, 3, 5 games or for a time based period 
---
They should be able to isolate people leaving matches by hitting esc vs. actual disconnects. That might encourage people to pull the plug but it's at least a little better. 
---
lul killer isnt op. survivor is just weak
---
Towards the end was the best Tasmanian Devil impression I've ever heard. 
---
I just hope they buff him up a bit because at the moment you either wreck ass or get your ass wrecked. Most of thr time it's the latter because it's often against good survivors. 
---
X
---
&gt;The point I'm trying to make here is that if you get good enough at the game, Adrenaline will almost never even get triggered in your games.
---
&gt;That's why it doesn't need any adjustments. There is no problem with the perk, it's all about your skill as killer. Even if you play off meta stuff. They have proved it true.
---
Alright, i will not dissagree appart from "it doesn't need any adjustments" it should not both wake survivors up AND heal them. I mean, if a survivor has deep wounds, it only heals deep wounds and they stay injured
---
These peeps playing dbd in 3019.
---
He‚Äôs literally the one that made it haha 
---
I'm a bit of a simpleton when it comes to stuff like this.
---
I'm a Brit, will I still be able to so SWF with my friends in the US? 
---
I think you mean 76 instead of 80 depending on how many skill checks they get. Correct me if im wrong. Im pretty sure a gen takes 80 when working alone.
---
I'm gonna have to disagree with Fire Up over there. I believe it should be higher, other than that I think it's pretty spot-on. Spies would be higher without the nerf which is sad. 
---
What do you mean you dont own hag? She comes with the base killers like huntress and nurse.
---
female clown lul
---
bring lightborn and mad grit
---
i can. final fantasy xiv. you‚Äôre welcome.
---

---
On the other side it's annoying when you play solo and the survivors you're put with mess around, croucjing and looking up and soinning in circles for attention, or trying to show off their moonwalks. Just for once I'd like to be put with genrush players.
---
But this is another reason I think a ranked/casual seperation could be good. One for the sweaty games, one for (hopefully) more chill games.
---
Take Legion with Frosty Eyes and the Moldy Torso piece. There, are you happy now?
---
I mean. Who says that it wont be a skin atleast. 
---
They can isolate them. If you pull the plug /turn off WiFi or use task manager to close dbd it let's you keep your BP and item.
---
Perk idea: when all the gens are done ash says groovy
---
Perk idea: ash can steal billy and bubba‚Äôs chainsaw
---
Perk idea: there is a deadite in the hatch like in that scene from evil dead except she alerts the survivors to its location 
---
Lore idea: deadites have a fierce rivalry with the entity which is why they lend a hand
---
A streamer I was against once had found the open hatch, but got cocky and went to open a nearby exit gate.
---
I was playing Michael so he didnt hear my terror radius until I was on top of him. He left the switch and ran to the hatch to escape but I managed to hatch-grab him and hook him.
---
I found his VOD the next day and he was giving me so much shit. Just because I killed him. 
---
Yet he was the one who got cocky with the hatch, and failed to spot me walking towards him because he didn't pan his camera around when opening the gate. 
---
The matchmaking they have currently on PS4 is really making me not play this game until they fix it. I see more homescreen than actual games.
---
Did you read the caption
---
Enjoy your 400 minute queue time  lmao. Not worth banning 1/5 the playerbase.
---
Same goes for the adult who got so mad he ranted to reddit about how he camped gens. Sad
---
Maybe instead of just punishing people who paid for a game, they should look at the root cause?
---
Like, fuck Ruin every. god. damn. match.
---
But that's, just like, my opinion, man.
---
The killers don't look like their actors lol
---
Honestly my idea when it comes to this perk system is go big or just get rid of it entirely for something different. If both sides had ridiculous perks I'd imagine it would all even out because I always find fun games with nonsense OP weapons fun, but that's because everything else you are fighting is also OP, so there is a sort of balance there. But then again the perk system could be scrapped for some type of different system, since perks just currently seem like a jumbled mess of good or bad right now. It's not even worth running some.
---
Or people should just sack up and stop DC‚Äôing? If you‚Äôre rage quitting that often why are you even playing the game?  
---
havent played killer all too much recently but from a survivors perspective it isnt as annoying as i thought i was going to be. I think ruin is more annoying when it stays up. Also ill usually find rhe first gen corrupted look for 10 seconds and find one that isnt
---
And when you equip the outfit it forces you to watch a 2 minute unskipable animation of them changing.
---
IRADECENT, IRADECENT, IRADECENT, GOLD
---
SINGLE PIP!
---
I don't run it since A) when you spawn first thing you go to the opposite side of the map and with this perk no-one will be there B) It really only gives you as much time as it takes survivor to find other gen so around 10-20 seconds.
---
I'm sorry your reflex is that strong that you're having a bad experience! 
---
Unfortunately, I don't think there is much BHVR is going to do about it. The best advice I can give you, if you want to keep playing, is to DC against Plagues. I know it feels scummy, but with a reflex as strong as yours, you don't have much choice if you'd like to keep playing. 
---
I have a buddy with coulrophobia, and anytime he faces the clown he DC's the minute he finds out its a clown. He loves Dead by Daylight, and he feels bad about having to DC, but he's got to do what he's got to do, and the same goes for you my friend!
---
Actual concerning discussion posts just don't seem welcome on this subreddit apparently, rarely ever see them at top. Wonder if BHVR ever actually sees them too.
---
Well he needs to learn how to use it instead of "long thing = SMASH TOOL"
---
I'll start by saying that this perk plays out pretty much as I expected it to. More often than not, survivors choose to hide and wait out the duration. 2 minutes is a long time though, and I usually can find someone in that time - but smart players will run towards the blocked generators, giving me a choice of either staying in a pointless chase, or turning around and trying to find someone else. Which is often easier said than done.
---
Early game detection is a big issue, especially if players aren't going for gens at all - if you try to check every corner, you'll waste the perk's whole duration. 
---
It's obviously good on Hag and Trapper, but I wonder if it wouldn't be better on killers like Myers or Wraith - especially the former, since his early game is slow, and it's hard to hide from something that you don't see (or hear). 
---
Anyways, these are my thoughts. Haven't unlocked the perk on a lot of killers yet, so these are only first impressions, so to speak. 
---
So let me get this straight; ruin, despite being better than alternative perks, (as you said in the last paragraph), is still mid tier because it can be destroyed in 30 seconds leaving you with 3 perks (as you said in a previous comment). Seems like based on your own comment alone it should be at least A tier but maybe better than alternatives means something else to you. 
---
DH, despite having the same weakness and not being active until there are 3 unhooks, is much better because if you get 5 unhooks, AND they can't find the totem (which again, you're rating ruin based on the likelihood of losing it quickly), you'll pretty much win. Seems like ruin is being judged based on worst case while DH is being liked at as best case. Not sure that's a good way to make a tier list but hey it's yours.
---
 Using the DH criteria, seems like dying light should be way higher since it is pretty much gg once one guy dies. You still have to find and probably use a Mori before a bunch of gens pop and it's certainly not a fun perk, but if you're going on best case it's way better than trash. 
---
Since you like TI, I'm guessing Billy or nurse main? Seems like they would be the ones to get the most mileage (can get back quickly and down quickly)
---
You're asking for something that's just not gonna happen even if it makes sense. People will always rage quit in a game where they're used to being able to do it. If they start banning for it we'll get shitty queue times and they're already dogshit. It's not worth it 
---
MRS OBAMA GET DOWN!!!
---
Omg that hand puppet! His cosmetics work differently too. Instead of head, torso, legs, it's going to be head + torso, hand and legs. 
---
If you set textures to low, it's easier to see claudettes and other dark characters, also makes corn less thick
---
The concept is great. The history and design of this is chilling. 
---
That's why you never give mercy as Legion cause it's guaranteed at least one is gonna ne toxic to you if you play Legion
---
Right, but haven't you had problems with killers only patrolling those 4 available gens? I played a match vs. a Plague on Gideon, and it was impossible to get any progress done (not to mention she got 2 hooks out of that).
---
Okay, will get downvoted to hell but I need to say this.
---
First of all, I do agree with you on some extent, it‚Äôs true that most of the time other teammates are the cause of our demise, and it‚Äôs not always the killer fault.
---
But with that being said we don‚Äôt need to excuse that every single killer is on the right, I mean in cases like camping, if the killer camps you on the first hook for whatever reason, you can‚Äôt put the blame on survivors, that is the killer fault for using a strategy that I consider toxic and ruining the fun of the game for me.
---
Aside from that I just want to touch, quickly, the point of tunneling.
---
Yes it is the survivor fault to unhook me right beside the killer, and I don‚Äôt blame you for going onto me, that being said, just because you have the opportunity of do that it doesn‚Äôt mean that you should always do it, maybe the killer should also think that , that survivor also wants to play a fun game and tunneling him because of another survivor mistake might not be the best fun for him.
---
I mean I read about us being self-absorbed and toxic, but let‚Äôs be real both sides have those, killers too.
---
I don't understand how you can make it look like the character but not the actor.
---
DBD VR confirmed
---
Would be amazing on clown. Constant laughing
---
Work so I can put more money into this game despite the fact that I tell myself I put too much money into this game.
---
People DC because they're having a shitty unfun experience. Sometimes it's their fault for being a thin-skinned whiny asshole, but sometimes it's the game fault for having a bunch of shitty unfun stuff it. Maybe it's not fair to the other players, but there's reasons they do it, and if you really want to reduce the problem you need to address those reasons. Trying to punish DC's will not. Survivors who want out of a game will just suicide on hook and it'll be exactly as shitty for the other survivors. Killers who want out of a game will just AFK in a corner or ragecamp for the guaranteed 2k and at that point I'd honestly rather the killer just DC'd.
---
Every killer is sick of Haddonfield. Every killer is fed up with the transparent tiles on Coldwind. Everyone hates those maps and we want them fixed or gone. They're absolutely shit and we don't want to play them anymore. And for better or worse, the community has gradually realized that they don't have to - you can leave anytime. And that sucks, because it means we all have a harder time finding games.
---
Every survivor is sick of Legion. Everyone hates playing against Legion and we want him reworked or gone. He's absolutely shit and we don't want to play against him anymore. And for better or worse, the community has gradually realized that they don't have to - you can leave anytime. And that sucks, because it means we all have a harder time finding games.
---
The game has a bunch of garbage in it, and people DC to avoid the garbage. The only solution that's actually going to work is for the game to have less garbage. I'm not defending DC's, I'm just trying to tell you the only thing that's realistically going to work. You're not going to successfully chain people to their computer and make them play out a match of DBD. This is a hobby, not a job. The game needs to be more *consistently* fun and balanced so people want to stay and don't notice riding out the occasional bad game.
---
Legion bad lmao, why killer can‚Äôt be loop
---
I wonder what happens if you watch to the end of the video?
---
So these are the kinds of people I play with.  
---
Explains a lot.
---
Hahahaha thank you for this video! You made my dayüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
ü§ôü§ô
---
Hahahaha 
---
Nice I‚Äôve played on a projector once before
---
No sir. I just give up and let the killer kill me if someone DC's.
---
Couldn't care for most of these exceot the imbalanced matchmaking and long queue times.
---
Most importantly the new pip system though. The dc issues have already been there, but now you are guaranteed a pip loss with every one. The gameplay is more towards point farming.
---
You literally finish a game immaculately, but then realise you have to all go back to the killer to farm some more points otherwise it is pointless.
---
After the game I was one rank 6 so yea... :D
---
Not on PC. I did just finally get my 9000 shards so I now own Jumpscare McGee and I'm Doc Farming for that sweet sweet Ruin.
---
It‚Äôs fine, I appreciated your post and didn‚Äôt take offense or anything. I knew your intentions ;)
---
Always destroyed quickly my ass the teammates I get would rather sit there a slog through it then ever think of looking for a totem lol
---
After the game I was on rank 6 so yea... :D
---
I disagree. While LF's instadown might be unreliable, it's still an instadown - that also destroys pallets instantly. If you mindgame people a little, you can make them drop pallets early, then chew them up quicker than any other killer. 
---
And his chainsaw really isn't that easy to mess up with. I think the issue here is that most people play him for his perks / don't practice him often, and thus suck at avoiding bumping into shit. Even if you're doing the maypole around a tree, if he gets in real close, a good Bubba's going to land that saw most of the time. 
---
And yeah, he's still on the weaker side, obviously. But I don't think he's worse than Freddy or Wraith, come on now.
---
epic
---
I did! Holy hell 
---
Better frame rate than PS4.  Rating:  7/5, would watch again.
---
some decent laughs on here this morning
---
It doesn't matter if your a nice legion or not a nice legion. The power shouldn't be with you to decide how nice you are. The character is pretty broken - So play him at your own risk if you want to receive petty hate. know it is not your fault, but complaining on reddit won't solve it - only a legion rework will.
---
Yup. Mostly happens when I'm the noob killer 
---
This is the kinda content this subreddit needs 
---
On ps4 I got all the characters except clown, spirit, and the legion + all the registered characters. But I got nurse, hag, and I had to download a free addon for huntress. But thats it. When did you buy the game, may I ask?
---
These are the people I get queued with....
---
I've usually seen them go to the corrupted gen area instead of patrol the remaining gens. They usually do find someone that way, but then the rest of us are able to work on the remaining gens while they chase.
---
Sure, but you were defending DC's
---
The survivors complaining about it are the ones only playing survivor. Same with killers I've seen complaining about Dead Hard or Balanced Landing. 
---
no it's the one time i tested as well wouldn't have surprised me if there's a bug to get unlimited tho
---
Only survivors I‚Äôve ever seen complain about BBQ are bad survivors. That‚Äôs all there is to it. It was a new survivor with probably &lt;100 hours jumping on the salt train.
---
For the damn daily I keep getting.
---
but.....gg tho
---
Slow the game down just a ~~lil bit~~ lot
---
[Dave Richard supplying the proof](https://twitter.com/DeviusQC/status/1111375965945397248)
---
I've done it before and I wouldn't say I've ever been salty. I just find it funny tbh.
---
wtf DBD has a porn subredit?!  probably on a dev stream they will show ur awesome artwors here lmao... btw that subredit is kinda gross imo
---
Same it sounds so hilarious. Until they just pick you up right away and you scream "Noooo you're countering my build!"
---
We've already seen 10000 matchmaking posts and we don't need any more, prove me wrong.
---
If they don't disconnect? Sounds like something I said but what am I even saying? I'm obviously saying lies because I'm getting downvoted.
---
Yeah, I had a game like that last night. Kited a Myers around for most of the gens, only to find that my team had left three gens literally like five feet away from one another to do. Astounding that people can hit high ranks without learning gen management.
---
Will this mean I finally ain't gonna be matched with julio from Brazil on 1000 ping now
---
It‚Äôs just what scrubs do. Scrub tactic is to not adapt, not get better and to not take responsibility for your own bad plays.
---
Just say l2gen and leave lol
---
I'm in a similar situation. Wanna get Jane P3 50 but also want to have 1 mill BP when he comes out. Gonna have to grind hard to pull it off.
---
A time to perform beyond one's limits!
---
I faced a 3 man streamer group who accused me of stream sniping and called me a complete twat
---
What do you do when you see streamer swf? Whats right kids, put on a mori.
---
Yes, me and my friend has encountered this multiple times...
---
he probably doesnt have a dick, sooo...
---
Mori yes, snipe no. 
---
Lmao are you dumb?  Running unbreakable in 2019 
---
funny thing is, most Streamers that actually use their twitch name barely have any viewers xD
---
Yeah actually, pretty broken that it doesn't, but then again, this whole thing is completely broke.
---
Mentally unstable billy
---
No perks, addons for longest chainsaw charge time possible, and a lerys offering. You are also only allowed to use the chainsaw
---
why? they gotta learn from their stupid mistakes
---
This is just a waste of time. I don‚Äôt ever both with it. I‚Äôll chainsaw them or whatever and get my deviousness and move on with my games. Until they fix this shit, a 3k is just as good as a 4k.
---
Didn't know they mo-capped the killers. Neat.
---
"throw" the game, ok mr. legion
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, and I understand why killers use it. It‚Äôs a GOOD perk, survivors should learn how to counter it if they‚Äôre gonna hate on it so much. 
---
Don‚Äôt let any players toxicity get to you
---
It's pretty useless against good Survivors.
---
Firstly, it doesn't slow down gen repairs, so there's nothing stopping the Survivors rushing the other 4 gens.
---
Secondly; you'd think it'd pair well with Discordance, since Survivors are more likely to team up on gens while it's active, but this isn't the case. In my experience, Survivors will just go full-stealth-mode until it wears off.
---
It could be a good 4th gen-defence perk; to be combined with Ruin, PGTW and Discordance/Surveillance, but I prefer to have a tracking perk to cut down the time between chases.     
---
Your list isn't bad, but I don't agree with some of your aspect :
---
Whispers isn't S tier. I find Whispers very useful on Huntress and maybe on Nurse ( but even on Nurse you are better running Shadowborn ). But on others killers is a really "meh" perk, nobody who isn't a P3 Claudette hide anymore, stealth isn't meta for survivors, looping and gen rushing are, so you are better running anti loop and anti rush perks, then tracking perks. I find Whispers B tier, sincerely.
---
I don't think Sloppy Butcher is S tier either. Survivors start to adapt, they start to run perks like Adrenaline, Iron Will and Dead Hard and rush gens injured or they just use Botany Knowledge or a Med-kit for countering the Mangled effect. I think Sloppy is A tier.
---
Save The Best For Last can be godlike on Hag and Spirit, but on  
---
PWYF is E? I think it should be at least c, but thats my 2c, how comes you rated it so low?
---
Damn... those textures alone are enough to stun the wraith out of its cloak...
---
yea i did hate the new engine, the sound was too loud, teh game looks blurier and horrible, i missed the old engine so badly and my frames were like 50 fps, the only good thing about that chapter was our boi Jeff.
---
If "gen rushing" isn't a thing then neither is tunneling. Generators are the survivors' objective, and the survivors are my objective. I'm starting to feel like the survivor player base hasn't figured that second part out yet. They seem to think the killer is there to make sure they have fun, instead of being there to sacrifice them.
---
They already do
---
big fat man has big fat heart &lt;3 
---
also Discordance is top tier
---
Executed with impunity 
---
This does put a smile on my face
---
It seems to be more effective on particular killers, namely 110% MS killers so they have less ground to cover to start their pressure and Trapper and Hag so they can more effectively get their trap game going. 
---
Ruin is still far superior, especially now with new totem placements. 
---
that true, disconrdance is great, but that doesnt make the chapter decent at least.
---
A dodgy controller wouldn't cause this...
---
What I mean is that the toxicity in DbD would be LOWER if Behavior did something about it early. But they didn't.
---
I like my 'Everyone goes to the basement build': Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine, and I usually run BBQ &amp; Chili with it, but sometimes Territorial Imperative can be funny.
---
I have a lot of fun with it because there's the challenge of not settling for any hook other than the basement, which is a rule when I play with this build.
---
I only use this as Myers or the Pig though since it seems to work best with stealth of some sort to make chases quick enough to have time for all that basement business. I wish there was another basement perk besides the ones listed above. :( So I could have complete basement fun! 
---
Only been playing since August so for me it's the current update. The matchmaking and ranking changes have completely ruined the gane for me.
---
nooo. if they'd remove the whole chapter and fucked sounds (that are present again after new chapter) i wouldn't cry for Discordance
---
Final Fantasy XIV, Warframe, and Space Station 13. There's not many, but they exist. People just need to stop acting like toxicity is normal because "that's how multiplayer games are". Adults shouldn't act as stupid as this community does.
---
Billy's chainsaw lets him go really fast, which is good because it lets you pressure the map easier. Bubba gets a wider arc and more control when he swings, but there's about one situation where that's useful which is defending hooks.
---
Okay my bad, just thought thag might be the case
---
There are pictures from pax with him wearing a hawaiin shirt and other with him holding a chainsaw.
---
Undertale is more cringe than salt imo.
---
the game was great before CHpater X ws released
---
So the Entity started listening to Neon Trees...
---
AND THIS, is not my boomstick rip
---
I know that feeling all too well.
---
Neither because this isn't Evil Dead. Nobody dies permanently.
---
I know what you mean. I was playing as survivor last night and u/umbria_bug D/Cd the second the match started because she didn't like the map she got.
---
Probably for the best. Rank 12 survivors against a rank 1 streamer would not have been fun.
---
My question is what the heck does the clown's Mori do to this lad then?
---
What's going on here? I don't get it
---
The same killers will slug for ten minutes looking for that 4k anyway, so this wouldn't make the game any longer. 
---
Insta blind add ons were removed. You can't insta black all flashlights blind the same speed. Moron.
---
What even is this? And what add on is he using? 
---
I think you just found your toxic Claudette.
---
? it's called being pragmatic dude.
---
What you sniff is just your own saltiness
---
Same tbh
---
100%
---
The penalty system is a joke and running into salty bitches who quit constantly is just annoying.
---
They need to ramp up quitters punishments. 
---
You can see them at the end, HEHE
---
They changed it so you have to double pip to get the adept trophy for killers
---
I get where you're coming from, but you can screw up vomit.  If she's dinged, you want to make sure you've got a loop nearby with high walls or tall clutter.  There's a good chance she'll fuck up hitting you around it. 
---
Hence the 'almost' before the insta-blind. Please, read before you call people names. :)
---
***\*INTENSE CONFUSION INTENSIFIES\****
---
Well said.
---
That type of complacency allows the problem to exist in perpetuity.   Out of sight, out of minds for the devs of this game.  It needs to be in the faces of the devs and the community multiple times per day until resolved.  Squeaky Wheel. 
---
They should do a system like any good multiplayer game.
---
Quit a game = next game no bloodpoints (plus the quit game loss). Quit it again then the next 2 games no bloodspoints and so on.
---
Basically a "low-priority" type punishment like any good developers use. 
---
i totally forgot to follow you when i posted your original tweet but i just did! your work is impeccable. have you ever made videos on your process? i'd love to watch them if you ever do!
---
New killer power leaked?!
---
Fuck your noed
---
I'd call that an upgrade
---
Buff Freddy
---
god that was orgasmic
---
i gotta go change my pants now
---
low settings and nvidia freestyle says hi
---
It's fine if you need to DC against her cuz you have a legit phobia. Better than being a dcing crybaby cuz you don't wanna play against doctor or 4 blink nurse.
---
Everyone gangsta till the trees start glowing
---
The update that made it so you could blind the killer at any point in the pickup animation to make them drop them AND you could blind the killer at any time while they were in the animation of hooking a survivor and make them drop them.
---
If you don't let me proc Pharmacy I swear . . .
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-8CSa9xj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz-8CSa9xj8) 
---
You mean it‚Äôs a punishment for doing the objective because the killer isn‚Äôt putting enough pressure on the remaining survivors forcing them off gens right?
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more.  The guy is so full of himself and can never ever accept getting hit or downed and will be the first to dc on a 3v1, which is feasible. If you are a streamer aren‚Äôt you supposed to be good enough for that challenge? His dcing is disgusting. Holier than thou attitude. I‚Äôve written questions like 10 times in his lobbies not once does he respond to me because I don‚Äôt sub to his trash channel.  He was playing battlefield 5 last night amusing because of the dbd server issues and was down to a little over 1000 viewers versus his nomad 2500.  When dbd dies so will he.
---
This is so good, I loved the first person camera.
---
Yea fuck fat people lol Americans are all fat
---
Make more!!!
---
The Entity won't eat more than one node if it'll cause you to progress a level. That's how the Entity progresses.
---
You just ended this man's whole career.
---
Really well done, i want more plz!!!
---
Didn't know that cap. Thnx
---
Thing is, it's supposed to be a more reliable alternative to Ruin, since it's guaranteed to take effect - but I've seen it simply herd the survivors together while I chase one, so the gens sometimes go faster than normally. 
---
It's a interesting, but weird perk, and I'm still not sure how I think about 
---
Although I've had times where it wouldn't eat a node that cuts a part of the bloodweb for no reason, guess sometimes it just bugs out?
---
Yo good fucking shit ahhahaha
---
this is so fucking bs.
---
Ticket to BHVR? Go into the shrine and check if it says perk owned
---
This perk stacked with instaheals is going to cause a lot of killers to DC lol just imagine getting into a long chase ,getting a hit , eating pallets , them instahealing , hitting again , eat another pallet , whiff on a dead hard then boom hit lands gotcha survivor...NOPE survivor gone feels bad man 
---
Orrr ya could just take their word on it and not try and turn into a post debunker scientist?
---
They wanted to make perks useful at all ranks. They changed survivor perks too. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it was always like that?
---
Hillbilly - Nurse
---
I hate telling my friends when I find hatch because then sure enough here they come zooming over with the killer and get all of us downed. It's funny after but at first when your trying not to die it's frustrating
---
Can anyone tell me who these all are?
---
The fuck...
---
if the community thought about it for more than two seconds, they'd realize that they don't want this.
---
separating regions results in longer wait times - especially during the night. the waiting times have now gotten even longer. **especially during the night.** 
---
here's why id assume the community thinks they want regions to be separated. because they don't wanna go against killers with a big ping. the reality is that the matchmaking system should automatically put you against someone whose ping is decent - regardless of their region. but it doesn't do that. you will meet people far away with better ping, and people close to you with horrible ping. it's not a guarantee that people far away from you will have bad ping. even if they do, why should the matchmaking system put you in their lobby anyway?
---
in the end it comes down to matchmaking not prioritizing the killers with better ping. and now because some of you fail to realize that region separation wont make a difference except increase queue times, we all get fucked.
---
150 ping is high?
---
He still have his other hand üò¨
---
"Wallhacks". Every time I start to be nice to survivors they give me yet another reason not to 
---
Yeah that's exactly right. everytime you get stabbed it takes longer. it stacks and stacks and stacks. that's the bug
---
It used to be a thing for billy with his mangled chains, and huntress as well. 
---
I mean, Just kill them all
---
They're gonna bitch like babies because some people want to have a negative experience
---
Don't let it impact YOUR experience, just do your best to kick ass and kill babies
---
Okay . . . but the Clown Mori always takes the finger from the right hand, which would be the puppet in this case.
---
Post #152 about matchmaking. This week alone. 
---
Damn you had to take that shot. Was it worth it?
---
Well definitely did not expect that response. May I ask why?
---
You don't have slug to stand in front of a hook at the knockdown spot.  It's a foregone conclusion unless you're rank 15 or lower (higher?)
---
Calling a hex perk that doesn't activate until the last leg of the game a "failsafe" lol  
---
I loathe NOED but it's hardly a 4k in the bag or "free kills"
---
Instaheals are being changed soon so this shouldn't be too big of a problem. 
---
You hit a point when playing killer where the only goal in the match is to just get 4 stacks of BBQ &amp; Chilli. After that killing becomes a side objective.
---
^ this man knows what's up
---
You decide to become to prick only because people are streaming or decide to play with there friends. 
---
I've always wondered, who falls for the blatant baiting in these kinds of situations? Who in the world doesn't understand somebody setting off the noise notification over and over or running in a "Please hit/chase me" circle right in front of them in a 1-gen-left situation is just trying to buy time for their friends to finish gens? 
---
I appreciate the time and wholesomeness that went into spreading this message. Thank you OP
---
Jesus I'm so glad that i quit playing this game.  What a shit show.
---
I mean tbh I've tried sniping a ttv guy
---
It slows me down more than anything since there is a delay
---
And it's distracting, I guess if you can't find ANYONE then sure it's a bit helpful
---
If I leave so last person can get the hatch, it's never because I'm salty. I'd just rather get to the next game instead of spending 4 minutes on the ground doing nothing.
---
Why is her hair.. I don't even know how to describe what her hair is doing..
---
Right?
---
OP literally crying like "wah how dare survivors get one good perk (the literal first strong perk survivors have gotten since DS)! brb lemme equip NOED BBQ Whispers Nurse's Calling on my killers" lol.
---
Cus he looks cool. Lmao. But nah it wont mean end times. It'll mean only meta killers at rank 1 and nobody playing for fun anymore. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
---
Ok that sucks. But I don't think it's a bannable offense.
---
Games take forever to end up losing, you don't get many bloodpoints, and it isn't fun... why would a survivor stay?  
---
Even in a legit game against legion where they aren't tunneling/moonwalking/fanks mixtape. Getting power slapped running to a corner mending, work on a gen for 3 seconds, getting power slapped and repeating this all game is terrible. I'm gonna disconnect 10/10 times because it isn't fun even a little and takes forever. I don't even care about the counter play argument I just hate that every game against legion is either A) get tunneled B)mending for 50% of the game. 
---
Even with your super senses you seem to be missing a very critical one. 
---
Its mori's not mories. If it were morie it would be mories. I'm 99% positive that this is the reason why and 100% sure that its mori's.
---
I rarely DC. However, I make an exception for Legions who play scummy. As there are a lot of these, I‚Äôm starting to DC more and more.
---
They'd be treating a symptom, not a cause.
---
???
---
lmao I'm telling you right now I doubt people are going to be running this perk over basic survivor meta once the Ooo Shiny period is over. People had this freakout over Deliverance and Distortion too
---
Legion used correctly, I had no idea the more you stab the longer it takes
---
Every hatch standoff is comprised of two absolute dumb idiot jackasses and I laugh at both of them. 
---
I‚Äôve always had issues with adept achievements, it has always taken me multiple attempts, took three with Hillbilly, but thankfully he‚Äôs easy mode, doing it twice with doctor was not fun. 
---
This. This. This is why I live.
---
Also, I‚Äôve done my due diligence at red ranks. The last two season I prefer to hang around ranks 15-10. However, this new system several times has put rank 1 and 2 killers against us. I‚Äôm not interested in playing Billys and Nurse‚Äôs with identical loadouts anymore. It‚Äôs frustrating 
---
The only toxic trash streamer I know that does that crap is that JenDenise chick, can‚Äôt believe someone like that gets special treatment from the devs.
---
They talked a whiiile ago about adding cosmetics to some licensed characters.
---
Oh hey, I was with you there. Decided to kill myself after that match. :p
---
It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs a real problem or something. 
---
This current update, the massive graphical downgrade on console has stopped me playing. 
---
Fucking stupid I love it.
---
If that's the case I'm balanced then I got One S perk One A Perk and then Two B perks
---
Yea mate same... And sometimes just for 1 item I have to play another match which happend in this pic as well 
---
Guess your copy without adding any meme is shit
---
And this isn't shit
---
Hmmmm
---
Credit the artistttt
---
Tfw you‚Äôre hired to voice your character and all they have you do is grunts and a yell.
---
I guess? Idk i have a lot of hours in this game and I never thought deliverance or distortion would be that incredible. Not to pat myself on the back too much for predicting that. Both of them are just good perks that feel nice to use and give minor advantage. MoM extends chase without causing exhaustion. Any perk that can do that is gonna be dangerous imo
---
This about sums it up for me. I think yesterday broke me. I'm 400 hours in and I'm just not having fun anymore as a killer main. If I get solo survivors, I typically do well and then 1 or 2 d/c. If I get SWF, I get roasted because I use mid to low tier killers and they burn fucking Yamaoka, Coldwind, or Haddonfield offerings half the time. That's if 4 survivors actually make it through the loading screen. There's a 20% chance of having a fun, balanced experience in this game. 
---
Yeah I saw, that's crazy
---
Do i look like a damn Leatherface main? I simply don't have anything else to fill my 4th slot with. All i do with him are the dailies. I don't need NOED, i just don't have anything else.
---
I hate when that happens. It feels so unsatisfying to play the bloodweb correctly just for something like that to happen.
---
That's probably simply because there are no rank 16 killers available for matchmaking to put you up against. They're all in matches against rank 5 survivors.
---
Maybe it's uncommon for lower ranked games, but high ranks tend to have to slug for the 4k to begin with.
---
So you wasting ten seconds of your time for a rare kobe isn't going to happen anyway. 
---
Same here. Maybe there's a patch being uploaded or something? Not sure. 
---
Same I have gotten the error code 3 times and haven‚Äôt gotten into 1 game today.
---
My first reaction to the nerf was ‚Äúlook at how they massacred my boy‚Äù
---
See the issue for Devs is that they want to appease both crowds for the game. Survivors want more perks to counter excessive camping &amp; slugging with other more fun perks &amp; killers want games to last longer so that they can play without the game becoming to intense. 
---
Everytime the dev gives to one side, the other side gets pissed off as it hampers their gameplay.
---
For example if the dev gives killers a proper gen regressing tool or way to slow down the game like ruin, the killers are happy that games are longer whereas survivors are unhappy as they have to fight against this new perk which slows down the game for them.
---
If a survivor is given a new perk to help them juke the killer, killers complain because chases are now longer &amp; gens are being done before they can catch the player. 
---
Many of the perks to slow down the game for killer have been designed to slow all things down. This is the safest way as it does not require the altering of the mechanics of the game. But it is the most boring way to design perks against survivors. Literally slowing down the progression of something instead of making it harder or forcing the survivor to do something to counteract it.
---
Ruin slows gen progression while sloppy slows down healing. At least with Ruin, it is the skill checks that are challenging as opposed to the actual progression bar becoming slower.
---
Corrupt was an interesting take against this idea as it provided another way to slow the game down via repositioning the gen placement at the beginning of the game.  
---
One of the biggest issues with the game is that its main attraction are the chases. This is the case for both survivor &amp; killer. The issue is that prolonged chases only benefit the survivor while hampering the killer. This forces the killer to make the decision to continue chasing or give up the chase, removing the fun aspect for both the survivor &amp; killer due to chases being cut short just so the killer can make actual progress.
---
How the Devs can change this I do not know. Will be interested to see their ideas on how to change this but I doubt they ever will. The only thing that would come into mind is that they make completing gens take a bit longer in the future. 
---
The devs have nerfed survivors so much the game literally isn't fun unless you have a team of four ready to go. You don't stand a chance otherwise.. of winning/surviving, getting any bp, pipping, *or* having any fun at all.
---
Omg same! I thought it was just me. PC isn‚Äôt down so I think it‚Äôs just us on console.
---
It depends on the killer though. With killers that have a slow early game like Michael Myers, ones that require a lot of set up such as hag , or killers who simply take longer to successfully end chases, such as Freddy, you‚Äôre job as killer with these characters becomes way harder. So hard that it‚Äôs not worth it to not run ruin on them or some other game delaying or end game perk. With the release of the plague we now have one other option for game delaying perks, but that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs just one other option. There are simply not that many other perks like ruin that can effectively stall a game long enough for certain killers to do their job. 
---
Haha good luck!
---
How long ago did it change?
---
I wish I could
---
Has this happened before then? The only comment made on this error code seems to be back in October 2018, recently after a newly live update. Strange. Hopefully it's up soon! 
---
Same, was halfway through a match and got booted out
---
Yea it's down right now.
---
Why are you getting downvoted
---
Bruh when you dive into the ground to go to the triggered trap üòÇüíÄ
---
Nobody said anything about toxicity what the fuck are you injecting yourself with? I've been playing this game since it released on the PS4. I don't need NOED, i just don't have anything else on a killer i never fucking play or put points in. Am i just supposed to run without perks and make my dailies more difficult?
---
ps4
---
ingame
---
ive had this bug twice yesterday where none of my teammates were able to heal me. option 'heal' wouldn't pop up to them. today my teammate was bugged and i couldn't heal them. 
---
Bring a map with glass bead, mark a spot in front of a locker, when a survivor comes by, jump out of the locker, nod your head, then run away
---
Thank you man! If you have any killer/survivor in a nutshell requests we‚Äôd like to know
---
the "killer" about to farm you or the survivor? 
---
Oh okay. I could care less if im tunneled or camped at this point unless I‚Äôm being facecamped. I‚Äôll complain about it but I won‚Äôt call the killer out for it. ANnoying how there‚Äôs players like them
---
Actually crimson hair, but it‚Äôs kinda faded already
---
I honestly hate that i have to absolutely run ruin on certain killers if i want to do well at all.
---
Me. Since it‚Äôs usually the guy fresh off the hook they go for.
---
You‚Äôre admitting at being bad then trying to showboat your rank. 
---
Lmao 
---
It‚Äôs always been about having fun and learning the game better to play better.  I stay in between 10-15 usually and I‚Äôve played in the red ranks as well on both sides. The only difference is more saltiness the lower rank you go.  That‚Äôs why I prefer to stay mid to high rank at all times. It‚Äôs a good medium where I can have fun and not crunch my brain on pips.  9/10 times I‚Äôm on the top of the list bloodpoint wise. Low or high ranks.  I lose of course at times but that‚Äôs just part of the game. People get too obsessed with ranking. Truth be told the more you play and especially turn into a runner and get rid of urban your game with dramatically improve.  I don‚Äôt even use self care anymore because it‚Äôs about completing the objectives fast and healing takes too much time.
---
Oh now i see it! The sunlight brought it out
---
Noed is for bad killers
---
update: it works after reinstalling. not sure if it's the servers just went back online after that or if it actually did something but I'm in a match lol. 
---
They're the strongest killer. Unless you win against ALL the other killers once without ruin. Then you can say that, the 2 killers have insane map pressure that even ruin isn't needed. I've lost against those 2 killers countless times without ruin so it's an unfair comparison imo.
---
Yes, kinda hard to see from a distance
---
Happened to me too, no idea. Lost a Scratched Mirror though, I was sad.
---
We shouldn‚Äôt blame BHVR for our willingness to ruin the fun of the killer and other survivors. DCing is selfish, period.
---
What if he still has the chainsaw hand because HE'S the killer?
---
i assumed as much tbh. i wonder if they know stream sniping is a bannable offense?
---
NEW update: got kicked out to the main menu and now everything has a lock. can't click on play as survivor, killer, store, etc. 
---
That could fit in the one where you can turn into Stone Cold and beat ass I imagine. 
---
oof 
---
I'll try without reinstalling now, but if that's the fix - thanks! 
---
ok...you are now running around injured while on death hook, potentially letting the killer know where you are at all times with the debuff perma aura reading.
---
"oh it's late game anyway" is not going to always be the case.
---
Tbh, when I did the report I was pretty sure it was some sort of an bug abuse. And I still am. But idk, didnt look normal 2 me!
---
It‚Äôs the face of someone really considering what the fuck they are doing in their current situation.
---
I guess everyone‚Äôs brains, eyes react differently but the blurry graphics are giving me headaches, even making me nauseous, Especially when playing as killer, I haven‚Äôt played the game since the plague came out, so I haven‚Äôt experienced those issues. 
---
They're back up! 
---
Give me screenshot when survivor is complaning about BBQ
---
Or i wont  Belive it
---
&gt;Me. Since it‚Äôs usually the guy fresh off the hook they go for.
---
Why wouldn't they? Unless they want to be extra nice for no reason whatsoever. 
---
Its the survivor's fault for unhooking in the killer's proximity and not taking a hit afterwards or getting his attention. 
---
IT'S FUCKING TIK TOK TOO
---
Yeah but the other survivor is the guy who pulled you off the hook in front of the killer, making it so the other survivor is farming you, not the killer.
---
You are hatchet god!
---
haha that game was crazy, I was speechless after that game lul
---
OMFG AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
i can't stop laughing
---
it's a shame i can't upvote this more than once
---
thank you for this
---
Not groovy..yet!
---
Welp that‚Äôs a huge darn 
---
I love how much this game triggers people who are way too competitive and just don‚Äôt know how to take a game as it is
---
Follow the page for more content 
---
Only way I know to pause videos on iPhone 
---
Ahh. I've managed to get past the initial 'login' screen, haven't tried playing though - maybe that's still down?
---
*\*Imagine Dragons: Radioactive intensifies\**
---
This is perfectly fine. The exit gates are open, you can leave. The killer is securing their kill. Nothing wrong with it. 
---
During the video i was like "TAKE ALL MY MONEY"
---
Nah not bannable since it's literally the add-ons fault. There's no exploit to it, just the add-on itself is broken.
---
it's so weird though, I had never seen locks on the actual menu screen 
---
As Killer I totally understand that point of view
---
I heard complaints from other people on PS4 that this increases queue times, but I would rather wait 10 minutes for a game that doesn't have me getting downed and hooked from the other side of the map. I am really glad BHVR is finally getting to fixing someone of the major problems, next we need now is constant hit boxes, lol. 
---
are you dense? its stupid to put your Stream Name up...
---
This was the best worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen
---
Thanks for the upvotes guys, make sure to check previous content and keep up with new content for best memeage.
---
Ps4: sometimes when youre running, youll slow down randomly even though youre still holding down the button. Usually happens during chases. 
---
Imagine MoM, Dead Hard, Adrenaline, an insta-heal, and some other chase perk. That's too strong.
---
I had a rank 5 killer and one D.C.. the rank 15 and 14's were promptly tunneled by someone 10 ranks higher then they talked shit after lol. 
---
oof, My game went down when I was queueing with a pinky finger and a cheap gin bottle.
---
Thanks dude
---
I will try it in Hag after leveling Plag up
---
Not sure if I like sloppy butcher or this perk instead
---
It‚Äôs back up now
---
If I was a developer I'd be exhausted trying to satisfy this community too tbh. 
---
I never was dictating what is and isn‚Äôt fun. I was calling out people for being selfish assholes for ruining the fun of other survivors who might actually need the full game for bloodpoints or for wasting the killers seven bucks to play an extremely aesthetically pleasing character. Do you fucking dc in any other game when you go against something you don‚Äôt like or feel has no counterplay? I‚Äôve never even heard of anything like that until I got to this game. We shouldn‚Äôt be fucking justifying wasting everyone else‚Äôs time.
---
John Wayne gacy is the irl killer clown (pogo) you're thinking of and ed gein is from wisconsin.
---
"I think we've done a pretty good job so far."
---
You just made a point that goes against your statement.
---
The fact that pulling the plug lets you keep items shows DCs cannot be distinguished.
---
Boo hoo someone is swearing in the internet. Go tell your mother 
---
Well worth the wait
---
Yeah, but good luck proving stream sniping actually occured. It's the unfortunate truth that it's near impossible to prove 
---
Yeah 2 minutes is kind of ridiculous! Though I wouldn't be surprised if it was just bad balancing, I like Legion but even I know they broken
---
True. I'll take my free survivor pudding please. 
---
Well it kinda makes sense. They only said the "America's" and not separating between South and North America. I'm getting some US players on my lobbies every once in a while too

You are giving him points by screwing your team over allowing him to win easier.

---
NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEJ
---
I mean, they could at least throw Freddy a bone and remove the wake up from it.
---
Im sorry, after reading your comments on other things, I see that your not just another salty survivor. I understand that your trying to start a discussion by saying its not mandatory, but the way the meme is portrayed though, it seems like you just want to dis anyone who uses ruin. 
---
Yup and I find if you really want to slow the game down use the pig
---
I shit my pants in fear.
---
Awesomeness. 
---
For a minute I thought this was the Hanson MMMbop video !!!
---
I don't think he really needs it, though.
---
Unpopular opinion: Freddy isn't anywhere near as weak as people think he is, he just requires approach to the game than other killers and most people don't know how to adjust to that and end up failing.
---
Well if you read the caption you know its dead by daylight, it also hasnt been taken down and I couldve just half assed put a picture of claudette but that wouldn't represent the torment I am suffering unlike the original image from Eastenders
---
Monto using Noed.
---
Amanda is straight up human wearing a pig head. 
---
I've dealt with that. They say it's because your run button is worn out. I'm pretty sure that's not true tho.
---
Longest lunge in history
---
So I know a lot of people like both Bond, Dark Sense, and Aftercare, but they all have limitations, either by distance or frequency of use.
---
Bond only lets you see teammates within a certain range. And while that can be useful in many situations, it‚Äôs useless if no one is around. For Aftercare, it has specific conditions that has to be met *by you* in order to work, and when it drops, you have to put yourself in danger to get it again. Dark Sense is nice in that it allows you to see the Killer‚Äôs aura, but it can only be used a maximum of 5 times per game (once after each generator has popped). And you may never be able to get much use out of it if you have a bad team.
---
Empathy, however, has no such limitations unless a killer is running Third Seal (as with all aura perks). It can be activated an unlimited number of times, and can continue to be active potentially for the entire game (especially if someone is running No Mither). When it activates, you‚Äôll be able to get a sense of where the killer is anywhere on the map provided you‚Äôre in T3, since they‚Äôre almost definitely in chase with the player whose aura you can see, and you‚Äôll be able to approximately tell when they are out of chase. It‚Äôs excellent to keep you safe because you‚Äôll be able to see the direction the chase is heading, and usually get away before the killer sees you either during or after as they‚Äôre heading away if the chase is coming towards you. You‚Äôll also be able to tell when a killer is far from a hooked survivor if they go into chase, allowing for safe rescues.
---
It‚Äôs obviously not perfect, but I think of all the aura perks it has the fewest drawbacks.
---
I know dude her lunge range
---
Eh to be honest some people play to be toxic some don‚Äôt, I play swf all the time but we don‚Äôt use flashlights or insta heals, borrowed time is probably the most toxic we get even though it isn‚Äôt toxic at all
---
I meant, legion looks the most human of all of them 
---
I'm not the one who's complaining like a ten year old before the perk is even out. Even then, it's only fair that survivors have a perk that is useful after the constant nerfs after nerfs they have to put up with. Not to mention all the BS dirty tactics killers use to secure their kill like tunnelling and camping. 
---
These days playing killer is child's play. If you have difficulty securing a kill you should question you're own ability instead of asking others to be put at disadvantages. That's how people become better: by overcoming adversity instead of begging for easy way out like cowards and lazyfucks.
---
take this: https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/16/1474222499230242023/
---
randomly kicks members of my survivor squad out of game. Looks like disconnects from in-game, but looks like killer quit if you're the one disconnected.  
---
Happens to 1-3 of the players at the exact same time. no other internet services (like voice) are interrupted.  
---
You got me there 
---
This also happened to me after the patch for one match, from when the game started till i was dying on my 3rd hook; very infuriating to play with and irritated me to no end. Nothing would fix it, was highly frustrating.
---
all the killers were human....
---
either way the perks leaked were survivor perk so ash wont be the killer anyways
---
Im pretty sure ops calling the game dead. But idk
---
Mob Psycho vibes
---
I mostly agree with this. I think bond is strong because you will always see teammates if they're within range, but empathy is so nice for knowing where the killer is when someone gets hurt. When I turn off empathy after running it for a while Im always spending a couple seconds looking around for the injured person before I realize im not running it that game lol. 
---
Snipe is sort of the anti Swf. An advantage that was never meant to be.  
---
That said I cba opening a stream to know their position
---
The matchmaking should make them want to stay in the match more considering it probably took em an hour to get in
---
The real tragedy is he has no voice lines, like really? 
---
i think bond is mainly because it doesnt matter if you can see an injured guy 70m away id rather see injured and healthy survivors in that 36m
---
pretty much
---
Exactly. There's no point to it.
---
Based on a true story
---
Its sad they couldn't even program in one GROOVY into the game 
---
Oh man I didn't even consider...
---
Soundcloud Legion
---
Only use Fire up, Fuming Mixtape and Julie's Mixtape. 
---
Maybe now people will check out Legion's Soundcloud profile.
---
Claudette ain't hiding by trees this game.
---
Not sure if stupid or trolling.
---
Haven't you seen the footage of people playing as him in the DBD build being used at PAX?
---
Same as gens, just a different animation :p
---
üòÇ
---
More like Bethesda haha
---
Why would they waste the money and resources to...
---
* Get Bruce Campbell for the trailer
---
* Get Bruce Campbell for the likeness and voice
---
* Make a fully finished model for him
---
* Make fully functional perks
---
* Have an entire PAX East booth for him where you can play as him
---
...all for an April Fools joke? It'd be a huge waste + imagine the outrage from the community.
---
For fun builds
---
It‚Äôs true, and you should say it. 
---
Kindred Alliance 4 lyfe
---
See, that's the point. You're kinda supposed to know just by looking at the image.
---
But if you can see them all the way across the map you can go help them. And people are going to get injured during the game 99% of the time so regardless you'll be able to get a lot of benefit out of Empathy in that regard.
---
u/Ghostofbigboss was a hero. I just couldn‚Äôt see it.
---
Hail to the king, baby!  I have a tough time with playing as survivors, so I tend not to play as them, but I'm definitely going to make an exception here!
---
Kindred Bond Empathy Dark Sense

*I see all*
---
everytime i try to kill myself on the hook so my friend can dip thru the hatch, i always somehow unhook myself
---
Also Decisive Strike: For when your asshole farming teammates don't run Borrowed Time
---
I'm not seeing the wholesome. It's just "git gud" with more words.
---
No way. I remember going for adept wraith around 3 months ago and I waited through a 30 minute hatch standoff to get my last kill, and then I didn‚Äôt get it because I didn‚Äôt double pip.
---
I hate that a killer rage quitting can cause survivors to depip. 
---
i feel like i belong at red ranks but im stuck at rank 8-9 because not every survivor in a game can pip not enough points to go around. ranking system is way too hard.
---
Yea empathy is great for keeping track of the killer during chases.
---
I had my almost perfect Kate build for over a month and didn't run her until I got T3 Empathy. It's just so useful.
---
Hey, if someone found the hatch you're on the hook...
---
"be a bro, let go"
---
Some people dig both 
---
Which streamer lol i wanna see the clip haha
---
Wait is this why it takes forever to find a game now? 
---
i use prove thyself a lot so bond helps me readjust what gen im on to pop them faster. altruism isnt my forte
---
Honestly I expect nothing more from BHVR
---
Ok. I‚Äôll let him know. Hopefully if this goes through it will improve the situation. 
---
Do you know how much that would cost?
---
Ugh, didn't the developers specifically state that stream sniping is NOT a bannable offense?
---
Happened to me this afternoon, surprised cause they were doing well. A few hooks under their belt.
---
I think it was cause someone destroyed their ruin totem.
---
If only the devs gave a shit.
---
True but the game in general has been feeling a lot more toxic lately, on both sides 
---
&gt;Other hacks
---
**Using 3rd party software or other tools to gain any kind of unfair advantage wasn‚Äôt intended by the game**, except if they have been whitelisted by us. Heavy proof and a video recording is mandatory.
---
&gt;Multiplatform harassment (Steam/Twitter/Facebook, **Twitch** etc.) ‚Äì These are exceptional cases, if you go all the way to do this, you will be banned for 48 hours right away, skipping the 24 hours ban.
---
&gt;Griefing: Intentional gameplay abuse
---
* Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates
---
* **Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience**
---
* Holding the game hostage
---
from your link. no, it doesn't explicitly say stream-sniping, but it does list things that stream snipers often do, soooo...
---
You don't know that. 
---
The perk is not out yet. The only reason you're make this assumption that thing won't be fun is because you know you're awful with those killers. Others likely won't have similar issue. 
---
It's like DS. I never had issue with it using any killers except after exit gate is opened. But even then that's like 1 in many games. But of course killers who can't chase to save their life complaint endlessly about it. 
---
I think youre overly analysising it. People understand it, people upvoted it, people relate to it, its a good meme. Plus adding a claudette face not only doesnt look good but it takes away from the meme https://imgur.com/gallery/LmKGmgS
---
It doesnt break any rules if you actually read the caption (which counts as identifing as a dead by daylight meme) I think youre just over reacting
---
Lmao
---
Sometimes I kill myself so my friend can get the hatch
---
I was an Empathy guy until I tried Bond. 
---
Never again.

Welcome to the Entity‚Äôs Realm.

Stop telling me what I know and being an overall mandchild. Christ its excruciating how arrogant you are. Just fuckin have a conversation and stop talking down to me from your made-up pedestal.

+1 for tapp
---
Anyone notice the strange head nod at the end?
---
I'd consider doing it just to mess with the survivors and let them go at the end
---
I always hit rank 1 and stay there, only thing that has changed is it was easier to get there because I was facing rank 15-10 survivors basically everygame
---
I guess I just said it in a nice way  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Directed by Uwe Boll
---
I've been wondering why there was an increase of Legion players during this patch and now I know.
---
Lots of good killers do this, no need to point out a specific one. Some of the maps are dogshit anyways and I agree with DCing on them as Killer.
---
Its either that or other kids who care too much about what others think and whats "cool". 
---
Thats just karma. 
---
i really like it for end game once the doors are open im able to see a injured survivor and go try and help them or take a hit for them, sometimes i run empathy and bond at once
---
What a joke.
---
Until you turn up the volume and it's just the spooky vacuum.
---
You have to restrain yourself from vomiting on gens, because then the survivors go off the grid and you just run around puking on shit for no reason.
---
But pig was the most underwhelming license... And Myers is like the best.... Why OP... Why ..
---
I should just know every time someone posts a way-too-long, unfunny, over-edited mess of a video where the gameplay is average and the people speak too loudly that the video is going to have been posted by ImCows.

My team all use borrowed time and decisive so any tunnelers will feel the wrath
---
Happened to me on Xbox as well.
---
Makes things complicated because not all killers have a second weapon. And for the ones that do it would require extra work to re-skin everything.
---
I'm not too sure what's wrong with this community, but downvoting someone because their favourite streamer isn't all that cracked up to be is about is childish as it can get.
---
Yes, it was proven they weren't friends. And, yes, he always says the other side is 'broken' whenever he loses. Pull up any video of him losing. I started watching him as I was getting into this game as I was learning. I learned a lot from him, but hearing him complain that the other side is broken every time he loses made the whole 'learning' aspect not a worthwhile pursuit from him.
---
Thank you for your input
---
I am sorry, but I can't really believe that. Just because it's bad for you doesn't mean it's bad for everyone. So, as unlikely as my experience sounds to you, your experience sounds to me.
---
hey, i'm not trying to be an asshole, but for future reference you can reverse image search stuff like this on Google to come up with the original artist's link, usually. it really sucks when your work gets reposted without credit and if more people linked the original artist the internet would be a cooler place. :)
---
where'd you get the downvotes? I see nothing wrong here
---
That's kinda the point of legion lol-to waste survivor's time. We just wish that we could avoid getting hit. I have no issue with deep wound.
---
I prefer aftercare because I like being able to see across the map with the small requirement of healing someone or unhooking themw
---
It's a macro meme. Super low effort. It's not a good meme.
---
I hate DCing. I play dbd to *play dbd,* whether that's with a camper or really good killer or shit teammates. Do I get annoyed at campers? Certainly. Do I enjoy being sacrificed? Not particularly. Do I care when my teammates DC because they're sore losers? Abso-fuckin-lutely. If everyone DC'd when the game didn't go their way, no one would be able to play a single game to completion. Your match might go poorly for you, but it could be the best match your teammate has ever played. Be a team player, don't DC like a lameass
---
Interestingly based on your timer. Every time you heal from mend, the next mend timer will take around 50% longer based on my calculation. 
---
The first one is I believe the base mend timer of 22 seconds. The next mend you do takes 35 seconds which is around 59% longer than the first timer. Your next is 54 seconds which is 54% longer. It seems that every time you complete a mend, you add a stacking bonus of 55% longer mend time. 
---
Welp looks like calm spirit &amp; no mither have finally got the stealth buff they needed.
---
write-ups would be rad as well! i love learning about stuff i don't know how to do, even if i don't plan on going it, so you'd definitely have one reader at least! i bet you'd get a lot of cosplayers too :)
---
no pressure, of course, just a thought!
---
So what happens when I queue with my friends in Asia or Europe?
---
Man this buff to spirit is insane 
---
Damn that looks sick
---
Its a nea
---
The game is bugged as fuck rn, there have been times the same thing would happen but with 1 side of a generator, or when trying to heal someone
---
Then maybe it's a sign 
---
Lmao the expression of the one acting as the hag.
---
Well, it says stream sniping in the first image so that settles that.
---
But, it also says that targeting specific users is a bannable offense. Does that technically mean tunneling is bannable? And also technically camping? Some of these rules could be interpreted in so many ways they are basically worthless.
---
This is a good representation of what it looks like when you see BHVR trying to patch a bug out their game.
---
If youre getting off a gen to run all the way across the map to heal an injured teammate, youre playing the game wrong. 
---
the bugs in this game just get wilder and wilder every day, lmao!
---
Reminds me of when I used to record first person scenes to emulate videos games on my sisters little handheld camera
---
Aftercare?
---
You need to get more than 9 hooks and kill everyone to achieve that trophy, can't stay near the hooks after hooking a survivor cause you will lose shit ton of points. Good Luck! 
---
Tiny Wraith. I fucking love it.
---
Looks more like a marker board than a sign.
---
Damn she looks like she's a professional body builder. Shredded asf.
---
or better yet, use empathy AND bond for the ultimate survivor survivor aura reading
---
Tomato tomato.

Nurses will have problems as its essentially a second dead hard. Good thing Im a leatherface main lul

Huntress is nothing more than a woman wearing a mask.

Zaat is Obscure asf my dude
---
are they selling those at PAX??
---
I‚Äôll see what I can do :)
---
What snide remarks? I didn't make any, nor did I put any words into your mouth. It's you that did that with your "survivors are op i cant do anything as killer" line. What a hypocrite.
---
Survivors aren't OP, in fact I think they could do with a little buff. However there is a good way to do it and a lame way to do it. A perk that articislly extends the chase - takes no skill to use - can not be avoided - has no counterplay - and punishes the killer for doing their job is not the way to go about it.
---
New DS was a good perk. Its strong when used, is good for the health of the game as it works to discourage tunneling, but at the same time its situational and has counter play. The only change it needs is that Enduring should not work against it.
---
I don't understand how you can't see that this perk is bad design. It's basically the equivalent of Legion. It can't be avoided and removes all skill from the chase.
---
I mean shit...
---
https://youtu.be/LVIT5d6EKXU
---
Great counterplay Michael.
---
All you need is the music added over it and it would be complete.
---
If I'm playing survivor, I will gladly wait. When I play killer I usually just hit them and be done with it, a 3k is still good by the games standards anyway
---
HE KNOCKED THE HIGHLIGHTS OUT OF HER HAIR!
---
Yet she is a fog whisperer and has a cosmetic in the game, I can‚Äôt stand human trash like her.
---
Not really but go off
---
That's not what low-priority is lol.  Low-priority is either a forced delay to finding a game or an entirely separate matchmaking solely for people being punished.  
---
It still did then, I got a screenshot of it too. I'll probably contact them. It was a week ago or something now so :/
---
I have never done that. I just meant in general it can be done. 
---
I‚Äôm glad GlacialEclipse was able to teleport though
---
Sorry but half of my games do not have campers in them. 
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
I mean, the fact you said you're mind cant be changed doesnt really make me want to bother. But I think its pretty obvious to any seasoned player that Bond is far superior. Empathy has a place, lots of new players that are still terrifyed of the killer like to run it. If you like using it, good for you, but to suggest its the best aura reading perk is just a hot take and demonstrably not true. 
---
First off, 'she'. Second off, not a rant. I get a lot of shit in chats, everyone does. Don't post all that, this was more of a 'really?' moment. But sure, go off on that, mate.
---
It's a meme sis
---
Is it just me or is the caption grammatically wrong?? 
---
Kickstart my heart Hillbilly.
---
Perks- BBQ, Discordance, Ruin, Spirit Fury.
---
Add-ons- Doom engravings, Beast marks.
---
Offering- Anything you want.
---
But the real star of the build is blasting kickstart my heart by Motley Crue as you try to win as fast as possible.
---
Was just going to say the same thing.  Takes me about 10 seconds to find a survivor match but 5 minutes with killer rank 11 east coast USA.  I don't understand what they did, it was never this bad before.
---
Hi there Nea
---
I die so you may survive my child
---
You are totally right, nurse that i got is 90% bad only feel guys play well with her hehe
---
It was a one time perk that you could fail. If you fail, you were basically down a perk all game. Even if you got free the killer could just chase you down again really quickly because it's not like the stun was super long or anything. At least try making an argument. 
---
Exactly!
---
I made this on the spot so beside it's a shit post for a reason 
---
F
---
Watch Army of Darkness, at the very least.  The Evil Dead movies (at least the first three - not sure about the remake or TV show) slide more towards comedy as time goes on, so even if you're not a big horror fan, it should still be enjoyable.
---
Funny enough I was thinking about doing perk comparisons myself!
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday on ps4.I thought my controller was fucking up
---
How much?
---
This guy is the survivor, right ?
---
lmao i actually tried that
---
Yes, you c--  WAIT A MINUTE!! üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ 
---
Huntress is way better than plague but ranking up is tedious for everyone right now
---
Lol I‚Äôm just saying you contradicted your statement but if that‚Äôs ‚Äúgetting worked up‚Äù to you I guess no one really can change your mind, so what was the point of this post?
---
Also playing overly altruistic can definitely cause harm, gens need to get done or it was all for nothing.
---
Excellent point sir. lmao
---
I said "low-priority" because I think a true low-prio system would just make matchmaking times even more horrendous. 
---
I would like a dual-penalty system to be honest. I would do:
---
1) Certain amount of disconnects in a time period (say 2 d/cs in an hour as an example) - 10 minute queue ban. If you keep d/cing, the queue ban keeps increasing. Similar to Gears of War system.
---
&amp; 
---
2) Bloodpoint penalty - X number of future completed games do not receive bloodpoints 
---
Can other people not breathe with their tongue out
---
It's a shitpost. There's no point.
---
The reason I say she‚Äôs worse is because, plague actually has map pressure and can run almost a full gen stopping build, where Huntress has to take 2-3 tracking perks. This + the utility of puke makes me think that Plague is better overall. Why is huntress better in your opinion?
---
I would definitely love too see some more educational content for the perks &amp; add-ons in this game to actual see their effect live. 
---
Many people choose perks like sloppy as it can be placebo as they do better in games using them. Whether they effect gameplay or not it would be interesting to see the actual in game effects of add-ons &amp; perks. 
---
Not sure the rules of advertising are like in this subreddit but if you find anything particuarly interesting with the perks then make sure to post it. The most recent finding was he bug involving 2 of the Legion add-ons that cause mending to take longer the more you are hit with frenzy.
---
SNIP-SNAP, SNIP-SNAP, SNIP-SNAP! 
---
There was a post on here with a killer glitched into a tree or something and everybody in the comments was saying "The Wood"
---
Scratch marks have been pretty bad this update. I keep having them start spawning a few seconds after the survivor starts running which, in a loop can make it look like the survivor just abandoned the loop if they managed to break LOS.
---
Damn he got better outfits than Ace
---
Dude one of his posts is telling all ‚Äúsurvivor mains‚Äù to bitch at the devs until they butcher noed. Dont pay him any mind.
---
Here's my idea. In different spots of the map there are piles of dead bodies. You're invisible and can fly around the map really fast. (like the camera flying through the woods in the movies) You can see survivors, but can't touch them til you go to a body pile and control a deadite (which is pretty much a basic killer) you can exit a deadite whenever you want, but can only spawn a body piles.
---
Simple, because she doesn‚Äôt have to wait to kill people like plague does. People can also work on gens that have puke on them, it‚Äôs not a big deal
---
My issue with tru3 is the blaming of the game any time I see him lose. The worst is when he uses a situation where he is at a clear disadvantage to get on a soapbox and complain about survivor gameplay. For example, recently there was a game with him as Huntress on Lerys, famous for being an absolutely horrid map for Huntress.  So he is already at a disadvantage going in, and he even acknowledges this at the beginning of the match. However by the end of the match, that fact is totally thrown out the window and it turns into a gen speed/SWF complaint. Mind you, after hooking the first person, it took him a minute and a half to even FIND his next survivor. Another example would be when he played without perks and addons and was complaining about the same thing. It‚Äôs just stupid. I feel like he‚Äôs created a lot of complaining killer mains by doing this. 
---
You did the right thing.  Fuck feeding a scummy slug camper a 4K just because.  They tryharded their ass right into your hatch escape.  I'd have done the same thing.
---
I tHiNk We DiD a PrEtTy GoOd JoB 
---
Lmao, 99% of survivors are dickheads, they should be punished and suffer every game, they are fucking crying about everything, but when baby killers aroud, everything is fine, and teabaging at exit games is complitly fine
---
Gates, excuse me
---
Yeah this is fine
---
Wait, how does the legion work now. I quited the game like 2 month ago when legion sucked ass what happened why is the timer so long 
---
I want to be rank 1 at all cost, tunnel and try hard, get 4k so I m able to assert my dominance and satisfy my ego in the main goal to feel better in my life.
---
Oh wait.
---
No. That's a sweatie streamer thing.
---
Ahhh the feeling of denying the enemy!
---
is it a forest fire

Anything involved in direct gameplay isn't BM. Killer wanted to farm? Tough shit, it's not survivor's job to farm. Gens popping too fast? Tough shit. It's not the survivor's job to give a killer a chance to catch them, the killer should have applied more pressure.
---
Killer tunneling/camping? Tough shit. It's the killer's job to kill you, it's not their fault you aren't doing gens. Killer using strong addons? Tough shit. Survivors have powerful items/addons too, and they even get to find them for free in crates. They also have SWF.
---
It's only BM if you're doing shit that does nothing to your benefit in gameplay, and is only intended to piss the other player off. You can argue that it's strategy to provoke the killer in chasing you and leaving your weaker teammates alone, and I'd argue that you can't bitch that the killer facecamps you when he catches you, because you had it coming. Tough shit.
---
I've done this for strangers / had strangers done it for me too. 
---
Awwwwww look at the little Insidious baby.  I just want to wrap him in a blankie and cradle him in my arms as I feed him his bottle.
---
This is no match for my BRIEFCASE FULL OF BEES
---
Easily the update where they thought it was a good idea to remove timing from Flashlight saves.  When Ochido says it's stupid that survivors can auto save against a killer you know shit is fucked lol.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt downplay that. his cosmetics are fairly unique and has thought put into how to unlock them and what they represent (the diff survivors)
---
Evil Dead is still being more out there, which could point to DBD gaining enough popularity to put it on the horror map 
---
THEY ADDED ASHY SLASHY. I really wish this had come out when the show was still on. It would‚Äôve driven the viewers up and maybe given us hope of a 4th season. 
---
If this happens to you again, hook them.  Oddly, it works. 
---
you dick you got me to wash my eyes with soap
---
&gt; Survivor could use We will make it with self care to heal themselves in 4 seconds. Killers could literally not kill survivors for 120 seconds after survivors used we will make it.
---
&gt; 
---
There's a video of a Claudette looping a poor wraith in a jungle gym and just healing after vaulting because her self-care was just as fast as his vault. The game these days is honestly a blessing compared to back then.

People like her don‚Äôt contribute anything to the game or community but yet someone like Monto who not only makes daily content for this game but teaches us about perks and how to improve in the game can‚Äôt be a fog whisperer!? Shit
---
I understand depipping and maybe a queue ban, but not receiving bloodpoints is way too harsh. Other then rank it's the only progression system in the game. Plus I assume the devs want people to come back and play the game - What if someone was having connection issues and fails to connect to two games, do you think punishing the shit out of a player to the absolute maximum benefits anyone?  
---
The first thing that would happen with the 0 blood point is every DCs next game they would just AFK or "troll" to just exit the game as fast as possible - this only makes the problem worse not better. Plus the majority of players would simply uninstall if they were told they would get 0 blood points next game, why play a game to get nothing? and if they weren't told, used party streamer, tried hard, 0 bp win I would submit a bug report, uninstall, &amp; refund the game. 
---
Oh yea dude I keep getting out skilled by franks mix tape legions, I must just be bad at the game!
---
Make mori &gt;:(
---
Nice strawman.
---
Playing a game and playing a game like a dick, are two different things
---
I have fond memories of the Halloween chapter, before people learned how to hit decisive strikes. The release of Halloween was pretty fun, regardless of it's effects on the future of the game.
---
Or leatherface, billy and Myers. Seems way too niche to be useful honestly.
---
Nah, aftercare OP.
---
It's been this way since emblem and matchmaking change just not as bad. Still good meme though
---
The locks on there mean the game isnt finished downloading 
---
One wrong turn deserves another. I could be the fairest person you'll ever meet, or the biggest asshole ever, depending on what you do.
---
I'm a strong believer of karma
---
They are not. They have some exclusives for now. They just added a statue for preview for july 2019 release. And a nendoriod 
---
Calm down man
---
It's seriously out of control.
---
I'd say 80% of the games I play now, first survivor hit/downed immediately DCs, regardless whether I'm also doing survivor or playing as killer.
---
Even shittier when it's as survivor because I'm left with the potato survivors because of the dumb fuckin' matchmaking system and end up de-pipping.
---
Read the news post.
---
what that they changed it back to old long wait matchmaking?
---
Netflix  Adaptation
---
Not gonna lie, I didn't read the title and had the sound off, so I was convinced this is what pure unbridled autism looked like, then I saw the title and added sound and even now knowing this was a hag thing, still can't shake the unbridled autism thing, but I'll be damned if that wasn't a spot on impression lol.  Also, nice teleport
---
Shame, takes forever to find a lobby again on PS4
---
 I have a question I play this game like twice one day then don‚Äôt play it for another 4 months do you have to play as both survivor and killer to rank up and do you have to switch characters 
---
At least there is skill checks. Not that they are particarly fun either, but at least it‚Äôs something to do. I had a legion yesterday use both blade add ons (adds time needed to mend fully) dude... that shit is ridiculous. The mend time is, no exaggerating, probably a full minute or so. Worse than franks imo.
---
Hey Entity, won‚Äôt you look my way, I can be your new addiction
---
We also need Ghostface or Ginger from Ginger snaps.
---
Why...? It‚Äôs not even close to impossible. Black ops 3 does it and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs present in other games too. 
---
You're not wrong. Even F13 has better waiting times.
---
Have deserved better than this
---
Survivors and Killers rank up separately 
---
I had longer wait time on any of the "new" systems that I had on the old.  
---
Good luck ranking up at all with the new system lol
---
Ooooh, so it takes longer and longer to mend if you decide not to heal to full each time? I heard they planned to make you just lose an extra chunk of orange bar if you got hit while injured but I'm guessing they did this instead?
---
All hex are totems but not all totems are hex.
---
Giving someone the hatch doesn't make a legion player any less of a shitty person 
---
Rather play against people in my area who are good/bad then people in Australia playing on a didgeridoo
---
You listen to music when you play? 
---
Yes there is no new killer
---
Jeff could feed a family of four hags. 
---
Bye Felicia 
---
i never said it was impossible but lets be honest they cant even make game with stable matchmaking let alone focus on things like that to care at this point and remember dead does not have a massive team like black ops behind it.
---
For gimmick builds.  If you watch him play survivor he typically rolls his eyes and says of course you have noed when someone goes down to it.  I wish he stopped the gimmick builds with it since obviously some people aren't picking this up from his videos apparently.  
---
Just wait for dedicated. I‚Äôm sure it will fix everything with que times
---
They really have to start naming these things, they can‚Äôt just say ‚Äúthe old matchmaking system‚Äù Bc how many we go through 
---
Omg
---
This is my favorite one so far, so many good things together
---
I doubt it would be that hard to implement, first of all. Second of all they‚Äôre trying and in all honesty, the game isn‚Äôt as bad as it once was, so there‚Äôs definitely been improvement. 
---
I agree with the sentiment, but I think it misses the reason that people get worked up over it. From a game perspective, the whole point of a ranking system is an attempt to ensure consistent matchups relative to player skill. DbD's ranking system and matchmaking completely fail to do that. Because of the poor balance across killers and hilariously poor balance between solo survivors and SWF, the experience varies drastically from one game to the next. It's hard to improve in an organic, linear fashion when you play one game against the equivalent of the JV squad and the next game against a swat team SWF that gamed their way into a purple rank game because two are on alt accounts and 2 are rank 1. Am I good or bad at X skill? Because I 4k'd at 5 gens last game and 4 escaped the next game.
---
Honestly, since there's no killer with Ash, why couldn't we get a Deadite-version cosmetic for the BHVR-created killers?
---
Never even said tunneling wasn't acceptable. Both are just aspects of the game. Both annoy the other side greatly. Also, why do you generalize survivors? You do realize not all survivors are like that right? If I said that killers want every game to be easy and expect survivors to stand perfectly still under the hook, I would be told how wrong I am but yet your generalizations are somehow acceptable.
---
I once convinced a group of random survivors in the pre game chat to all put on bond and I put on bond and open handed. We could see each other almost always and we were as coordinated as a SWF even without comms :p
---
Like on the loading screen its just hip hop and jazz. But in game im paying attention.
---
I listen to the game's sound so I can play it property...
---
I'm always genuinely shocked when someone tries to bitch about bbq lol.  It's mindlessly easy to counter with the locker buff and even before this it wasn't hard to counter (sprinting within range, hiding behind gen, faking your direction and hard reversing, etc).  When used the way it was designed it encourages killers to leave to other side of map after hooking.  
---
I had better experience with system 3, for solo and swf.
---
I'm a survivor main, i most def soft patrol by checking gens then coming back right before they hit tier 2 lmao
---
If they arent quick on the unhook, i dont find anyone else and im back by the hook, understand im making my rounds
---
WHat is melodrama?
---
Not when you get over 20k points and still didn't pip. That's not keeping me where I belong, that's a broken system IMO.
---
I think you have it backwards  every square is a rectangle but not all rectangles are squares.
---
Green sacrifice = swiggity swooty
---
I didnt care much, about the DbD section of the Pax, because of Borderlands 3. Good to know,that he is a survivor. Don't know the movie he is coming from tho
---
That last perk would be insanely broken 
---
I was clearly just having a laugh while messing with Quentin... getting grabbed just made it even more funny
---
&gt;WHat is melodrama?
---
what is this heresy? 
---
Damn
---
The player base is nowhere big enough and the matchmaking system can hardly handle the one it already has...
---
My ping has only gotten worse...
---
Obviously, and we'll try not to, but if the killer is staying close, that's when borrowed and decisive come in handy.
---
Killer main btw.
---
No but teamates brains need a buff.  STOP FEEDING HER CORRUPT PURGES!  Stay sick plow through gens, enjoy your escape.  Sick of boosted teamates getting me killed against her.
---
There‚Äôs no better feeling as clown than when a survivor runs passed a pallet then tries to loop it
---
K
---
oh, ok. Never heard of it before
---
I just love the kimono spirit that immediately came and swung like "You fucking bitch!" XD
---
It genuinely is.  I was going to dodge Julio anyway because fuck that ping, this just leaves me in the queue rather than having to requeue up.
---
Rank 1 killer is pretty easy if you know what you're doing, its survivor pips that are a pain in the ass.
---
Wait, will he have unique perks?
---
"Look at this hand, that I just found!"
---
really wished they changed all these hold m1 commands to something far more fun. It just sucks.
---
You've got it muddled up.
---
There was System0, the original matchmaking.
---
Then System1, tested on the ptb and made live with Plague.
---
Then it was reverted to system0 again.
---
Then they tryed system1 with region seperation, that's system2
---
now we're back to system0 again.
---
And eat them
---
old old matchmaking, as it was before plague
---
Its because they‚Äôre jealous.
---
I'm aware. 
---
Usually the most points in the match means you did a lot of work to get em ;)
---
Yeah it's more like when Vooshy did it for noob3. Not salty, just questionable lol. Still funny tho. 
---
Honest question: Why and how can you be so sensitive to that noise? Like it doesn‚Äôt even look like vomit.
---
Can confirm as an avid XIV player that it definitely has toxicity. It's just a lot more passive-aggressive than the in-your face 'you and your family need to get cancer and die' sort of toxicity that DBD has.
---
Did he hit her tho?
---
I played against a trapper with the username I_Fap_To_Murder 
---
psssst. /s
---
It‚Äôs not that hard to hear the killers‚Äô loud ass terror radius music honestly
---
Yea, but i get chased the whole match and only get 15k so i dont look at bp too hard
---
Despite all the mockery they‚Äôve really done a decent job at improving the game. I have faith that eventually legion and Freddy will receive a hard rework and that matchmaking will eventually become better. I love this game and I want to see it improve. Mocking the devs for their failures isn‚Äôt going to help in any way. 
---
theres some videos floating about--monto's made a few for example--for myers with those. they do appear to stack, though i dont know how fast it is exactly.
---
also fun for wraith, since he's got addons that make it *even faster* when invisible which also stack (both with themselves and fire up+bamboozle), as it's basically instant with that.
---
lmao
---
Releatable Kappa 
---
Ever heard of ‚Äúattack the argument, not the person?‚Äù Anyways, the perk was out. PS4 kyf. I never tried it myself but people could have tested it.
---
Wraith standing in front of it?
---
I like to call it ‚Äúpatrolling‚Äù so I don‚Äôt feel as bad 
---
Yea dude, ive been playing for a year and ive seen a lot of small improvements. Mainly quality of life, but the game gets love. Im happy they're slowly but steadily doing better
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠ I CARE ABOUT THE BULLYING I AM A SOFT BITCH
---
The asinine amount of dc's has been crazy.
---
So many 3 person games as killer.
---
Playing legion with the bame HIT (MAX)
---
Fair but if someone else is getting 5k-7k more than your 15k and they don't pip... that seems a smidge broken to me. 
---
What the actual fuck
---
maybe reset on hook?
---
Oh hi Marc 
---
Yes, even more, when you're downed. But another way too, that doesn't imply that the killer is winning.
---
Ok i understand but thanks for help
---
it's a bug....
---
Ive gotten over over 24k with no pips, honestly, rank doesnt matter to me because ive been rank 1 for the longest. Just glad i can get out of the green rank
---
Those are the brutally camping ranks lmao
---
No that wasn't it. It was in a jungle gym so there was only 3 sides anyway and I went to each side and couldn't repair it then I thought maybe it's corrupt intervention glitching out so I ran to every gen I could find and through the whole game I couldn't repair one
---
Plunderers I‚Äôll say no more üòé
---
They've definitely improved the FPS, but the graphics are actually a little worse. Pray to god that you don't get a corn map as killer, it's a blurry mess.
---
Thanks for not being toxic
---
Ashy Slashy is definitely a thing.
---
Well, looks like what you call system0 is the same thing that I called system2.
---
On a brand new PS4 Sony licensed $60 controller and I‚Äôve had the same problem, but on other games the button works fine! Tried older controllers all work fine on other games but have the same problem. So got a new one back at Christmas, still dealing with it from time to time, BhVR is full of shit if that‚Äôs what they said! Just another bug with the list of others!
---
Exactly thank you
---
that's for confirming why SWFs are bullshit and shouldn't be in the game and glad I play less and less now since with their new bullshit match making it's increasingly more difficult to identify SWFs to dodge them. 
---
SWFs are the most game breaking bullshit thing they ever added to this game. 
---
Maybe the system they put in place should open up to other regions after a set amount of time searching? Wonder if that could help.
---
i get lost in chases really easily because im just confused a lot and shit at tracking scratch marks, so, as Legion, i often accidentally break off the chase, look for them and then kill them lol
---
yea but you know that in the first min and i dont think you should get punished for that

I've never seen a killer actually complain that a survivor is looping. 
---
People have been suggesting this for absolutely ages and, as far as I know, there hasn't been any Dev comment on it. So it's probably not gonna happen.
---
Nobody is under obligation to farm with anyone else. I love a good farm (especially now) on occasion.
---
That being said, we need a universal code system. Eg I tap the "attempt escape" button when the killer is camping to alert the other survivors, but I read that someone else uses it to alert survivors that the killer is gone. 
---
Exactly where I am right now. 
---
Hauntingly beautiful.
---
cool to see that he‚Äôll actually have cosmetics as a licensed character.
---
Exactly,  gotta flex on streamers.
---
If your username has ttv in it, I tunnel you. No exceptions.

I thought I was the only one who missed the clown theme! Finally someone with taste 
---
Check out steam discussions if you feel like losing a few braincells.
---
I think it's a recent bug because I've never ecountered it before
---
I don't think the mentality of "if you don't want to do something then dodge" Because sometimes wait queues are insufferable. And the "they can't play the way they want" then saying "doesn't mean you have to bring a Mori" is such a double standard. Not saying I condone being toxic in any way though. 
---
Salt. Please tell me there was some.
---
Could be that I'm just running stridor but I'm actually hearing them a lot better even with the perk on than I did in prior builds with the perk.
---
Survivors don‚Äôt want to wait 15 mins for a game only to get a mori because 4 of them joined at the same time? What‚Äôs the fun in that?
---
but the nea isnt complaining about it.
---
Not always. Sometimes I've hard lagged only when the killer was near
---
Don't give me a reason to stick around and I won't.
---
I kinda agree but then again you will get skill checks and unless your a god your going to lose 15 or 20 probably even more percent from ruin. Its good to look for a bit then give up before to long
---
The entity wanted to try out the rapture. 
---
Dead by Daylight 2 is perfect for a 2 killer mode, fits the theme and name of the game perfectly.
---
I would want 2 entities to help balance (each entity has its own selection of killers and each player gets one entity assigned to them so there won't be OP killer combos)
---
Voice lines and emotes for everyone.
---
Completely different map design and direction. 
---
Mostly new character roster. A few fan favorites would be fine but I would want recycled content at a minimum. 
---
Plus this is not happening 
---
It's not so much trying to normalize it as it is trying to explain that DBD isn't special in that regard.
---
With the entity existing in it's literal own dimension, I really hope we eventually get a few utterly bizarre and surreal maps. 
---
On ps4 visual bug every survivor including me was massive. Fun bug in theory when you're not getting tunneled down and can't see anything.
---
I've noticed it's gotten a bit worse since the new DLC dropped. I'm hoping once people get bored again, there will be less dickheads in endgame chat. 
---
Ive had the vault glitch and a few other game breakers happen too, but i understand that they have to balance bringing in new players with the player retention, so im dead serious
---
lol that's me
---
I had a Leatherface that camped my friend so what I did was got him on me so the David could save my friend and get out. It was my death hook... 
---
nobody‚Äôs gonna play the ptb to test a worse matchmaking system, but sure ok
---
I'm a PC player. IIRC PS4 players may get Hag since Bill is a PC exclusive.
---
Hitting survivors hard with the guilt by association man
---
Well... that's not really true with the current pipping system, especially pipping as survivor.
---
It sucks but if you want Ash you gotta shell out the money lol.
---
they‚Äôre testing matchmaking as we speak lmao, seems like if anyone‚Äôs ignoring then it‚Äôs you kind of people.
---
i just got my Jane to 40 for the teachables so gonna start building bp now. I'll get those teachables on feng later on
---
infinite load screen at least once an hour....wow consider yourself lucky. For me it's easily every few games that it will either affect me personally, or it will affect one of the other survivors thus starting me in a 3 vs 1 or 2 vs 1 depending on who else quits out.
---
i really think it should just prioritize ping
---
yeah, for a while i'd get it after 2 games or so. i know the feeling
---
trying_not_to_laugh.gif
---
But seriously, what survivor hurt you lmaooo??
---
I understand this reference :p
---
the fact ur using territorial 
---
That sounds like my typical experience too.
---
It might. But that's entirely based on where you throw and what add-ons you're using. And the loop in general. Not every loop can be won even with Clown.
---
So?
---
ive got 22 bps saved in total, and atleast 50 escape cakes. im saving them until it‚Äôs fixed, with all these crashes idk why you would take the risk, especially more than once after it happened already.
---
thats whats off üòî
---
Yah I can rank up if there wasn‚Äôt a camping killer almost every game on PS4! Had a hole shit load of them from South America this morning! so you can‚Äôt save them, , you can‚Äôt be chased, so that goes against you big time now... 
---
Yes, absolutely what's the matter here. How foolish of me not to see it. Thanks old chap, I'm going to go snack on a TidePod now good day sir
---
The Ent-ity
---
IM CRYING AHAHAH much love sorry for bullying ur perk choice
---
Nope, just bug or smth

You're welcome Br√∂ther

---
No problem, dear fellow.
---
‚ÄúYou can run, but you can‚Äôt hide bitch!‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm really not looking for this kind of passive aggressive comment lol ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why‚Äù yes you are correct. You don‚Äôt know. 
---
I‚Äôve personally stopped playing myself for now until stuff gets fixed. 
---
The new pip requirements force you to farm the game at red ranks. You need 3 Golds + 1 Iridescent, or any equivalent.   
---
If the load is spread evenly among survivors, and everyone escapes, it often results in all 4 players safety pipping. The conditions for gold are roughly speaking: doing \~2 gens, unhooking/healing a few survivors without people dying on the hook, having the killer chase you for several minutes without going down, and surviving for at least 9 minutes during a trial. That's the high end of safety pip. Notice that most of these things can't be done at the same time. In order to actually pip on survivor, you would need to go out of your way to unhook survivors or be chased by the killer, even if it would be better for your team for you to be elsewhere. If the killer chases you for too long, and your team finished all the gens, you might even de-pip.  
---
On killer there are similar issues. You can safety pip, maybe even depip after 4king the survivors. Again you have to be in such control of the game that you can actually farm the other players in order to pip.
---
Everyone‚Äôs most hate perks hahah no but I would love to own these. 
---
Yeah, I guess it was a bad time to post this. Just pretend ranking is normal for this post ü§´
---
The goal should be to find a fucking lobby in this bug infested game.
---
omg girls at coachella are shaking
---
You can do that? :o
---
hmm ive never had that problem but doesnt surprise me i wish they would make some qol changes to the game already
---
And this is just the handful of matches I‚Äôve managed to play this evening. There‚Äôs also the clusterfuck of ranks playing together, and the fact that due to these absurd matches, glitches and disconnects it‚Äôs borderline impossible to rank up playing solo, making the whole problem worse and worse the more you play. 
---
Where a lot of people are.
---
a man of culture i see
---
Are you high ? The graphics have taken a huge nice dive they have been down graded so much to help frame rate, frame rate is better but the game is a blurry mess now. 
---
You had someone DC! That must be it!
---
We are on the third revision of the previous system after the second update when they changed it the first time.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm sure going back into a queue and waiting is better then they BS build you said you use because you assume all people will be the same as a few bad games you had lmao. 
---
Moris are whatever(I have nothing against them), but maybe try not to let some streamers words get to you when most of them hardly have viewers to begin with. 
---
I get an eargasm whenever I hear that man speak
---
i did not know this and that is a huge problem 
---
HighByDaylight
---
i wish they would fix just more than mm there is so much shit wrong with the game idk why i still love and play it
---
they hated meg because she told the truth
---
Yeah I think I‚Äôm gonna give the game a break for a while. I know that ‚Äúliterally unplayable‚Äù is a meme but it really is at this point. 
---
Correction for those who need this specified. FRAMERATE
---
Now kindly *fuck off*
---
(Im not triggered, i just like saying fuck off)
---
i do this all the time the only time i ever dc'd was in a hatch stand off i waited for 45 mins i was playing path of exile on my other monitor because it took so long
---
Someone‚Äôs got anger issues. 
---
You missed my other comment
---
Aw yea more matchmaking posts
---
Sorry to hear that. It‚Äôs super frustrating, isn‚Äôt it? I was excited for Ash but I think I‚Äôll have to give him a miss until they patch some stuff. 
---
I use it with ruin. They're more apt to be running around looking for the totem and get sloppy and now that it affects all 4 survivors at tier one it buys me some extra time right off the top.
---
I haven't seen a noticable dip. And even so, it's a good trade-off for FPS
---
i like this idea but i think it would be better if you only got 50% blood points or a cool down whre u have to wait before u can get blood points 
---
I mean you said it kindly
---
I have my messages AND friend requests turned off on PS4 because of toxic messages, it's insane!
---
Aside from the 1k points and the 4% chance of kobe for rare cases. 
---
then you‚Äôre prob not playing him right 
---
Holy crap, a trapper face camped me "for looping." I used one pallet and otherwise ran around the red Forest house. He got 4k bp and I got 12k... Never seen a killer get so few.
---
Beautiful
---
It sucks cuz you can‚Äôt run at all you do a two step and wiggle 
---
Jesus, it's hard to keep track
---
It‚Äôs really cool.  I hope you make more!
---
Still, the threshold at the moment is too high. If 30% of your games (just a number i pulled out of the air) drop due to a bad connection or something, it's hurting the rest of the people who play the game. I know it's not always possible to upgrade your connection, I've been in that situation in the past. That said, if you can't meet the minimum requirements to play the game properly, you shouldn't play.
---
Same. What pisses me off the most is using bps or cake and getting dc'd or other people getting kicked
---
I told them to fuck off, in a kind manner
---
But i didnt use commas the first time, so it could be interpreted differently lmao
---
Classic leatherface. 
---
im at sawcon
---
I feel like I‚Äôm the only one who doesn‚Äôt really have these problems, and I‚Äôm on console which is arguably considered shittier than PC. 
---
saw a Legion named "28 stab wounds" 
---
i got into playing Adam lately so changed my name to "Hex: White Privilege"
---
sometimes relaxing i change a name to "m2 doesn't work" and play unblinking Nurse or "i'm a survivor i swear" and just crouch, t-bag, pretend to do gens as Piggy
---
my favorite people to meet though those who feed my inner 9 year old with "ACE IN YOUR HOLE" or "UP THE ARSE". don't know why but Ace is just overall hilarious to me. 
---
OOOOF. They should be selling these on their Merch Store.
---
well said have my red arrow
---
How do you play him right?
---
I stoped playing a while ago and I‚Äôll start when they fix the game breaking glitches
---
Either takes for ever and the timer Says unknown
---
slow survivors down by actually throwing bottles at them, throwing bottles at loops, etc
---
i‚Äôm sure there are PLENTY of clown guides out there
---
this is soo funny! well done.
---
haven't seen this one but multiple times couldn't heal people and they couldn't heal me. no one had Broken status effect. 
---
Dude, I'm like 1000s of miles away in sÃ∂uÃ∂nÃ∂nÃ∂yÃ∂ England!!!
---
if you implemented a system and players were aware of that system they are less likely to dc because of the consequences and people that truly enjoy the game are not going to dc 
---
Freddy Krueger not this fishboi
---
True in general. The Steam forums replaced YouTube comments as the anus of the internet.
---
I don't see a problem... just a pretty good job so far /s
---
I'm out of the loop, what broke today?
---
Damn that after game chat really hurt you huh?? Lmaooo. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand how y‚Äôall let these messages get to you so much. Did you know the big bad chat goes away when you, the killer, leaves the lobby?? 
---
I bet they got mad at you afterward despite going for a save right in front of you.
---
Finally some good fucking food 
---
Thanks dude, theres always dudes that is gonna complain even tho all I do is try to make people smile. But I think the numbers can speak for it self when this post is 98% upvoted. And if he feels a bit better complaining about my work, well then good for him!

i dont think people should be banned for dcing but they need to up the punishment i used to play csgo back in the day and if u kept leaving games you would get a cool down where you couldnt play being a rage gamer back in the day the timeouts really made me change how i acted in game 
---
Yeah wish they could keep the newer system on the PS4, loved the much shorter matchmaking time.
---
Don‚Äôt downvote him it‚Äôs just another quote  from the movies üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
For context, I was just doing a meme thing, protecting my chest at all costs. They could have just left but instead the 3 of them decided to just die instead. lmao
---
It doesn't happen nearly often enough for me to run Unbreakable or care about losing 15k BP.
---
This guy gets it 
---
If my friend and I are the last 2 we either do gens if we need more gens for the hatch, but if there's like 1 or 2 gens one of us runs the killer around until we can get the doors open 
---
who in the right mind calls genrush a bm?
---
who in the right mind blames survivors for shit totem spawns?
---
who in the right mind calls crutch/op/tryhard perk a bm?
---
who in the right mind calls tunneling a bm?
---
bm is bad manners. bm is when killer hits you on the hook more than once, bm is t-bagging or especially waiting at the gate to t-bag, bm is standing on the top of something with Balanced Landing and emote to a killer, etc, etc. aka doing something that is absolutely not needed in the game, something literally immersion breaking (it is a horror game after all, when some cocky shit t-bags you at every pallet, clicks flashlight it makes you feel like this little cunt is a bad guy. or when god damn Myers breaking character and just stands and nods at you hanging on the hook. that's gross, that's not how Michael i know behaved). 
---
I mean I hate legion more than most of the other killers, but I'm not about to DC over it. It takes ages sometimes for me to find a match, I play through no matter how miserable of a round it is.
---
When I play Dwight (I only play him for the memes, with the full red pizza outfit with the watermelon pants), I name myself Dwightgiorno or Dwightlivery.
---
Spirits fury + enduring = fuck you
---
Because bhvr has a thing for keeping low tier killers in low tiers, and buffing strong killers for god knows what reason
---
Well, technically they did introduce the "New" matchmaking system before the Plague patch 
---
Ps4 healing bug- other players can't heal you and occasionally when they try the game lags and they take off floating away. 
---
does it block you from seeing them if the killer is facecamping?
---
alrighty, take my upvote for Ke$ha then. i'm a post punk girl myself but can't deny some nice blondie with a bottle of Jack
---
Except he explained it in a much more simple way 
---
I think sound balancing is messed up, so Stridor may actually be having a stronger effect.
---
They dc because you‚Äôre supposed to have fun in a videogame, legion takes that away, so why would they stay? Rank obviously means jack shit 
---
Saw someone post it from Twitter, under the same profile who had the actual reveal.
---
And you really don't wanna charge it any longer than you need to, since you move slower than a sprinting survivor.
---
I'm all for giving a 1.5k or so "Last Man Standing" bonus. It's the kobe (which WILL be irrelevant) and struggle (Which wastes time) phase that wastes time that I don't like.
---
Just had a game where a survivor killed themselves to give there teammate hatch. I stood on it and made them do gens to escape instead. They really need to fix the hatch. I like the way they had it in a past ptb where if the killer closed the hatch the gens got completed. Then it becomes skill based again instead of a waiting game. 
---
all these squares make a circle...
---
I'm not saying Clown is a copy of pennywise, I was saying just because we have a clown doesn't mean we can't have another
---
I've seen Hex: Devour Ass and I lost my shit lol
---
Ya it's annoying. Leatherface is a bad killer and could use a little love. 
---
EU
---
Actually all 4 survivors join at the same time no matter what due to the last update unless things were very recently reverted. You gotta understand that killers and survivors are both people and neither of them want to wait for games/dodge for games only to get hit by some bullshit. Like survivors may not have fun when killers take Moris, iridescent heads, and stuff like that. But killers tend to not have fun when there is a swf tbagging after getting a flashlight save &amp; then tbagging at the exit. 
---
I just play for fun. The bugs and glitches suck but I don't care what rank I am. If I can't find a game as a survivor I play killer and vice versa. 
---
At this point I‚Äôm just playing for meme builds and semi trolling. If you see someone running Bamboozle Brutal Strength Nurse you know I‚Äôm not out here to get a 4K. 
---
Aight thanks for the heads up üôèüèº
---
In some cases yeah, but when queue times are insane I'm gonna be mad either way so might as well be mad while playing the game instead of playing lobby simulator. 
---
Yeah pretty much...
---
Np dude, honestly he just seems like a toxic kind of person. 
---
I think a small timeout should be in order. It shouldn't be as serious as dcing in like overwatch competitive where you get banned for the season if you DC 5 times since there isn't a quick play option in this game.
---
What the heck is the red one eating?  
---
Don't say pallets.
---
I just hate that with every update they break a bunch of shit. Like please test it. Lol they fix a bug that makes generator sounds not be audible and somehow that makes nurse spawn in with a bag of chips as a weapon. 
---
lEgION iSN't tHaT bAD
---
Says the person who has to play a teleporting killer to gen camp lmao
---
I've also seen some survivors doing something where they start and stop sprinting at random intervals and it kind of causes the game to throw scratch marks going in random directions
---
maybe you disagree but i simply dont find crashes, dc's and camping fun
---
What the.... what the hell happened to her hair
---
So is it region free again?
---
Yeah I would hope for updates and variety. But it looks like it has really cool gameplay mechanics and physics. I especially like how if the hunters can't get every ghost in 4 minutes, they all come back and get buffed. 
---
That‚Äôs ok thank you! If i‚Äôm on reddit i‚Äôm using the mobile version and it‚Äôs very hard to reverse image search unless you are using third party apps or websites. The Google chrome app has a search by image function but unless you get the original image from google images it‚Äôs useless. Nevertheless I will try to credit artists in the future more thoroughly.
---
Yes, but then with stbfl you'd be ignoring the obsession anyway so its no different.
---
Its just that now....well its like you might as well bring stbfl because like DS, you'd be choosing to ignore the obsession. So might as well get a bonus for it.
---
How can you be mad at Basement Bubba? It's a free win as long as you leave his treasure alone.
---
My favorite is when I see no auras and scratch marks behind 2 or more trees within 15 feet of the hook. 
---
bonus points if Dwight sprinted behind me all the way to the hook while I was carrying.
---
Adress 
---
A lot of people seem to shit on Bond because it has a limited range, but the range is pretty far. Sure you can't see people on the other side of the map, but it gives you a fantastic awareness of what's going on around you (if someone's in chase, if all survivors are on the same side as you and therefore only gens on that side will get done, etc) If empathy's your cup of tea then that is what it is, but arguing that it's superior to the others because it can be used at an unlimited range is blowing it way out of proportion :/ Not a lot of people stay injured, at least in my games, so I don't really see a practical use for it. Besides, if it's on the opposite side of the map, why should I really care? It's what's going on in my immediate area (sans people being hooked, obviously) that should be my main concern.
---
I'm a killer main and I disconnected once because a survivor literally took 20 minutes to leave. 20 minutes! I was playing on PC for the first time and my controls were messing up so I couldn't chase him out the exit. I just faced the wall, went and made a bowl of noodles and when I came back the dude was still running around behind me instead of leaving. Then later had the nerve to send me a ggez! I normally play consol and that was the first and last time I will ever play on PC. I think that's pretty much the only situation where it's OK for a killer to disconnect.
---
Fatness IS unhealthy. That is unequivocally true. Yes, we don't have to shit on them and make them feel bad as a person but your language is dangerous and tells me you think fatness isn't necessarily unhealthy.
---
idk man i don‚Äôt know what to tell you since most people are in agreement that clown is alright as a killer
---
I had this problem right now in my most recent video! Wow. They really made Legion even MORE annoying. Escaped though because she was crap. She had both +mend time addons but they managed to bug something.. well that's what they can best.
---
I want David king irl
---
Please begin a series of all killers. You have become precious kings to this sub. 
---
It's a bug, i suggest u don't abuse it!
---
I used to hate Legion more than I do now. Used to DC against almost every Legion until I started playing him and it's still hard me to not DC even if I don't do it much anymore
---
Yeah that meg crawling away from the vomit what a punk bitch
---
*screams in disappointment*
---
Sarcasm noted and ignored. Have a nice day!
---
Thats the point I was making. People are so thin-skinned that anything to them is BM. 
---
Just some good old dev approved DBD balance
---
God dammit not this again. Take your upvote. 
---
What are they doing with ip addresses tho? o: 
---
I enjoy the new conditions too. It sucks with something like Plague cos her perks are garbage, but at the end it feels like that much more of an achievement. I really had to have a great game, not just a decent one without the hatch fucking me.
---
Easier on the framerate, those are untextured objects.
---
I don't care about ranking up. I care that I'm rank 13/14 going against a fucking rank 1/2 killer constantly. It's just straight up frustrating.
---
Not to mention the current rank system encourages tunneling and face camping which no matter how you write it, it's no fun to play against. 
---
Literally a piece of cereal on the screen. 
---
Empathy is my go-to perk. I use it constantly in my regular build. It just works really well for tracking the killer, plus getting those sweet altruism bps.
---
in my 2k hours in game and almost a year on this sub i've never seen anyone call these things "bm".
---
No and why the high fives
---
Ah yes, the elusive Squadette spotted in the wild. Praying for you. 
---
what's fun for you isn't what's fun for the killer
---
i fuckin love you 
---
my favourite is when they are patrolling and do see another survivor right by the hook, their instinct is to instead of go down them for a potential extra down, they instead run back to the hook and stand there instead.
---
That is the pretty much the first time I see someone shorten Barbecue&amp;Chili as BaC.Why not call it bbq like everyone else?
---
Is this a sneak peek of your plague in a nutshell idea?
---
Still cant find a match.
---
Games been out for awhile now. Almost all high rank survivors know where totems spawn lol 
---
We can't even find game AS IS.
---
I wait in menu for 20 minutes for a game to start as a rank 1 killer, I burn survivor pudding hoping for a good game, game starts, someone gets downed very fast, they dc, someone else sees one dc, immediately dcs, I‚Äôm left with two people who have no interest in playing the game anymore, thanks bhvr 
---
lol try playing high rank killer son.
---
I don't think that this perk is for your rank 20s.
---
The perk does have counterplay, if the killer is playing well, it won't even be able to get used until after the first hook. If the killer is using their power efficiently, several killers won't even see this come up as a problem. Hell if you weren't chased at all in the match and DO save it until end game you won't be able to activate it until the killer downs you once, hell NOED trumps this perk to requiring you to get downed 3 times, i.e. most likely dying before using the perk (not to mention other ways of exposed perks and add-ons working) still which sometimes is enough that late in the game depending on other factors. Remember you have to get hit with 3 M1 attacks before the next down becomes omitted. Chainsaws, traps, Mori's, grabs, vomit, edgy teen stabs, and hatchets are all still deadly to you before even getting a chance to pull this perk off.
---
I like how the example you brought up is a Michael who only got 1 kill by the end game with 2 other people who already got out, I'm sure that he was playing super optimally up until that point and MoM was the game changer that totally ruined his match.
---
The perk is an ok design. It isn't the only one of it's kind though, and there are tons of perks like it as I've pointed out that already do extend chases and gives the survivor an extra leg up. Are all those perks suddenly poorly designed too? The same can be said with a bunch of killer perks in other regards as well. I would enjoy more unique perks myself as well, but you can only do so much with how limiting the mechanics are in this game in terms of design.
---
the secret to playing nurse is not figuring out the timing for blinking, but taping a cheerio to your monitor for more precise blinks. you'll see a 100% performance upgrade if you go with the crosshair for nurse. 
---
Wow. 16 downvotes for referencing Waluigi?!
---
Yes it shows the auras of all survivors within a 36 m radius, injured or healthy. 
---
I'm glad you got to have the last word, I know it was important to you.
---
Its literally THEIR narrative. 
---
Imagine being the douchebag in grade 10 telling the english teacher "I dont give a shit what Shakespeare MEANT to say when he wrote Romeo and Juliet.. this is what it REALLY means"
---
True
---
Still a goid reason to give the area a looksie rather than just assume Jeff is across the map getting generator grease up in his finger nails.
---
But I don't have them. 
---
So what's wrong with the rest of you that is different for me? I don't know, please tell me because I'm losing hope in humanity because of you lot.
---
36m is pretty good. I might have try it out
---
This cracked me up so much I got smacked in the head
---
Thanks for this. Way better.
---
You can‚Äôt, she‚Äôs bleeding out. 
---
wtf i have never waited more than 5 mins for a game and yes that sucks
---
Or how about to have fun? People get so triggered when they don't pip 
---
That's what the title says...
---
You want them to make Waluigi skin on spirit? 
---
I believe so yes, think of it as two perks in one.
---
Better graphics and a story mode. 
---
i was thinking of trying to uninstall then reinstall bc the game may think your new 
---
Lmao. Just snuck right by her
---
For (PS4) killer, it wasn‚Äôt that bad to find a full lobby, Granted it was during night so that may have helped. The main issue was finding a lobby that didn‚Äôt have red ping survivors. Was the first time I saw 3 survivors with 800+ ping in 1 lobby :/ 
---
Both.
---
I'm not a fan of temporary perks :/
---
I'd love to play against you. Against good survivors you are basically perkless since they won't heal which makes Sloppy Butcher and Nurse's Calling useless. Thanatophobia does nothing so you would be left with nothing but BBQ that can still be countered by lockers.
---
Against dumb survivors, your build is perfect. 
---
Well it used to be good on him, now if he revs his saw he loses a token
---
This was my first game of the day and has ruined my gameplay experience so much that I have no desire to play this game at all again for quite a while. I'm real sick of the bullshit players on this game and the type of behavior that goes unchecked. If I don't hear back from a mod/developer that action was taken against this player, and preferably the killer, I will be contacting Customer Support for a full refund. 
---
Hahaha this meme speaks to me
---
Yeah my bad. I didn‚Äôt show the dull totem cause I didn‚Äôt think that would happen and before the video starts he was chasing someone below me 
---
Thats not how it works, you have to struggle out of your way to get a pip, fun is not a part of this game if you are trying to rank up
---
As a killer Main my immediate response to the Ash announcement was:
---
"NOOOOOOOO! I grew up watching Ash! Ash is one of my hero's... DON'T MAKE ME KILL MY HERO!"
---
He's so off-putting
---
This was painful...
---
Finally, some good fucking tier list
---
Also, devour hope above ruin? Devour doesn't always work
---
nice ty
---
All of these perks might as well be temporary without ruin
---
Where are you searching and how?  
---
I can help u out
---
Neither does Ruin considering its too much risk for a reward that can simply be worked through by competent survivors.
---
At least with devour hope, it takes a little longer to get going, but can quickly.snowball into getting essentially carried by a perk once you hit three tokens
---
I mean it‚Äôs a prayer but ok
---
Youve been promoted from gen jockey to totem jockie :D
---
I won't bother watching 11 minutes of footage, can you give a TL;DR of what happened?
---
Also, witch hunting is against this sub rules and you must report them using the in-game report system or nothing can be done.
---
I've played DBD since launch and often forget that a large number of the playerbase actually thinks the game is anything more than a glorified cat and mouse chase game
---
they think rank 1 is a meaningful achievement and that it indicates anything about their play
---
Yeah, I had some terrible ping as well sometimes, but I didn't mind dodging and queueing again when the wait time was no more than 2 minutes. Now it's back to sitting in a lobby for 10-15 minutes. Granted, it's usually green or yellow ping, but I just despise the wait times.
---
This is foreshadowing the moment the picture was taken 
---
I actually made Dave (creative director) laugh at PAX when instead of killing a 4 man noob squad I dances around with Santa clown after theatre all double hooked. 
---
Oh boy my flair is back on the menu. 
---
Lol that's pretty much what I did. I just ran around doing totems and making saves
---
what?  isn't it easier than ever to pip as survivor?  
---
you new guys are spoiled if you think the current system is even remotely hard.  you get pips like participation gold stars in grade 1 nowadays
---
It‚Äôs actually not look it up lol
---
Blaze of Glory if I'm up against a Billy.

If the killer messages you pregame asking if you guys want to farm yes that absolutely means you don't kill anyone.  Anyone that breaks this is scum.  And yes they get a ton of bloodpoints without the final hooks on each survivor.
---
it's not i mend in like 10 seconds, i dunno why it takes so long for him or even if its legit.

Real talk, I need the original context as to why that person is dressed as Spider-man and up on stage giving what looks like a speech in front of a lot of people.

Pretty much this, when I'm running legion (which I actually am now thanks to the new ranking system) I find myself having to exploit there injured state instead of downing them with frenzy.
---
u/Heznarrt, perks like M&amp;A, brutal, enduring, spirit, ruin, and such would be better than ones that only work on heals, unless you're facing lower rank survivors.
---
It's taken months for my friend group to take me seriously on the 'leave me he is camping' speel. And with randos, holy christ, if a Leatherface gets someone in the basement, LEAVE THEM.
---
With make up and costumes they‚Äôre not going to. But the film to Dbd adaptations are really good.
---
LOL! i've been that idiot. 
---
What did this thread even turn into lol good talking to u üëãüèª
---
Care to explain ? Afaik only the survivor can do something else
---
Oh cool, i might come back and try playing the game again then.
---
Hopefully the mandatory DC every single game will be gone now and maybe games will actually be fun again too.
---
Seriously loving Dark Devotion and Infectious Fright on Myers at the moment. Myers is terrifying with 0TR at EW3, with knowledge of where everyone is around him.
---
# Bitch, don't tell me what to do!
---
ya nobody quits cuz matches are poor quality due to P2P connections or laggy hits
---
sounds like bhvr should fix their game if disconnects are reaching epidemic level or nearly everyone says "somebody DC's in EVERY GAME I play!!"
---
Looks like DBD wants to become the next Farmer's Only. 
---
A literal gallon. 
---
Yeah just leaving the last guy on the ground and vomiting on him for i don‚Äôt know how long instead of just hooking him and moving on to the next match isn‚Äôt toxic okay lol. 
---
Not gonna like getting chased by that would scare me.
---
Probably Last Breath.  
---
The Nurse was beyond broken when she was initially added into the game, and the game in general was pretty darn unbalanced at the time.  
---
... Oh wait, sorry, hurr durr fuck legon update amirite guise? Let's ignore the fact that it provided us with much needed changes to perks like Spies, Surveillance, Prove Thyself, Leader, etc.
---
Yeah, I couldn't run from the killer unless I ran in a dead straight line, otherwise I'd run the risk of just standing still suddenly and not doing anything
---
Something about it reminded me of DbD. I think it's asymmetrical but not like, 4v1. Rather it's asymmetrical in that for the first part of the game one side has the advantage and then for the rest of the game the advantage shifts to the other side? Idk if that makes sense 
---
Does agitation not make you 18% faster than your default speed? Or is it faster than your normal hook speed?
---
Ur saying they dc‚Äôd cause I‚Äôm toxic...
---
Real players don't always care about what's fun or what's not. If you want a game where players care about your fun go play a game with AI
---
Oh ya
---
They recently significantly increased the requirements to pip. It's so bad that if your teammate D/Cs or dies early, its nearly impossible to pip at high ranks.
---
You're bm scum man.  Make all us killers look like pieces of shit.  Hope you took a shower after that game.
---
1.18*carrying speed
---
I feel like they goofed on the chainsaw charges for Billy and LF, as Billy you want to hold the charge to aim, as Leatherface you want to start swinging ASAP so you don't lose as much distance.
---
It‚Äôs literally just one game with the broken character, Plague.
---
Good luck on that refund 
---
Agreed
---
See who ?
---
I feel like noed just rewards killers for sucking ooh you got shit on all game have an easy kill
---
[It is literally a Cheerio taped to the screen.](https://i.imgur.com/5TwXFq7.png) Make sure it's regular and not honey nut otherwise you'll be tempted to eat it. 
---
Kill-rushing and gen-rushing are honestly the same thing tbh. Complaints against one make sense against the other as well:
---
"OMG these survivors keep focusing on this one generator no matter what I do they keep fixing it instead of the 0% generators"
---
I use a VPN at times through British servers and get better ping with Canada than I do from Canada. 
---
YESSS üòç
---
So you‚Äôre saying that anyone that doesn‚Äôt play this game at an esports level with real weight on each game should quit? DBD is a GAME. GAMES are meant to be fun. It‚Äôs honestly pretty scary how much blind devotion to the game you have.
---
Oh god that shit has happened to me a couple times. Not as far away tho. It‚Äôs bull.shit.
---
If it's a dick survivor I just stand in front of the hatch and then minimize the game for a while.
---
Came back an hour later once to find a survivor still staring up at me lmao
---
In what way is she broken? I've found no problems with her, but I haven't even played dbd in 3 days so a lot could've happened.
---
That's why bbq is so healthy for the game, if I see someone's aura I just go after him, if there's none  I soft patrol because the motherfuckers are camping the hook.
---
I thought my highschool was one of the only ones that had terrible school burgers. Seems you suffer the same fate too. 
---
Literally chest protector Leatherface where they don't play the game they just insidious entire game protecting the chest in the basement is the only iteration of Insidious camper LF that doesn't bother me.  It's a meme game and it's funny as shit.  If I got caught by it I'd laugh not rage.
---
Lol hilarious, the survivor mains crying but they hold the game hostage at the exit gates, shut the fuck up lil bitches 
---
Nope. I dont see no rainbow
---
Can you prove it? Otherwise, it‚Äôs kind of witch hunting.
---
Mathematically your incorrect.
---
1/5 of one game for 1 players isn't equal to 1/1 of one game for 1 player.
---
Ever heard "Don't jump into an argument you have no mastery nor knowledge of because it makes you sound like a dumbass?"
---
The perk were never out. Their description were available but it was not functional or else you don't think we'll see tons of video about it?  Especially since PS4 had inbuilt recording device. See, dumb?  Next time use your brain.
---
they announced dedicated servers for this year... the systems they are putting in now are only placeholders until then.
---
Seriously, they never have the sense to at least creep tree to tree. And it's literally ALWAYS been a Dwight in my experience. 
---
You don't just rush one gen or one survivor. You go for all of them.
---
I am being straight up with you when I say Bloodhound is Legion's most powerful perk. It lets you tunnel and down one person extremely efficiently and with very little effort. Get it, put it on, and prepare for people to hate you even more. 
---
My last game I was playing tum tums and literally just cut one person off and starting charging my chainsaw and they disconnected. They weren't even down, it would have been their first hook, and they just weren't paying attention to where I was going during the chase. 
---
Just messing around. I‚Äôve played this game too much to care every game lol

Yeah, I turned and ran lol he got away tho and my buddy got chased instead (the guy who dropped down)
---
Some players play not to have fun but to pip. Killers are people meaning that it's their choice if they want you to have fun or not. If they have fun being  a d*ck to other players then that's their choice. If they have fun when others have fun, again their choice
---
Then by that logic you're still wrong.
---
4 players ruining the game for 1 player isnt equal to 1 player ruining the game for 4 players.
---
You vomitting on a slugged survivor doesn't make you look any better, btw
---
You can do the same thing, if not better, with Alert and general awareness.
---
Yikes. That's doodoo
---
My only issue is that dresses are too high for how RNG based they are.
---
Yes it can be proven. Otherwise, I wouldn't have made this post? Lol any way if anyone gas anything useful to post. Feel free. If you just wanna be ^that guy. Then carry on somewhere else plz. Thanks.
---
*DEJA VU! I have seen this place before*
---
cope
---
I‚Äôd say if you rage quit all your blood points you‚Äôve earned gets polled to the killer and a heavy rank penalty
---
Eh. Going around with a survivor on yourself would be weird anyways :P
---
It's a reference the game Naughty Bear, another game developed by Behaviour in 2010. The game is basically DbD with teddy bears. 
---
Me bastion
---
Talking out of your ass, aren't you?  There've been maybe 2 months I haven't made rank 1 and that was solely due to not playing much, and now that they've changed pipping w/the release of the Plague, I can't get past 5.  But you probably didn't even know that it changed, so you just decided to lash out.
---
It honestly does, and I also have to do adept Freddy, and it's fucking impossible.
---
I do play high rank "son", thats why I know it's a strong perk. Good survivors won't care about the downside.
---
who cares if it is? one person leaves the match, loses their items/offerings, and all their points so a person can get a few more thousand lol
---
I usually quit because of my team, not the killer...tbh
---
Oh I really like that! The Dwight one is def the best, I may use that 
---
For some reason you're assuming that a survivor's game is by default ruined if they get killed.
---
It's still true for how it SHOULD be tho!
---
Ok I guess you don‚Äôt understand that you should respect strangers but that isn‚Äôt the main point. It isn‚Äôt bitching or crying. By reading perks you can easily tell their power. It‚Äôs safe to assume that this perk is useless against killers that one shot or can hit at range.  It‚Äôs just common sense. Also, I‚Äôm on your side you absolute fruitcake. This guy is definitely being hyperbolic but that doesn‚Äôt warrant you insulting him for having a fucking prediction that isn‚Äôt yours. I never mentioned video evidence.
---
Literally just did it for a vid 
---
If you DC from a match you have to wait 5 mins before queuing again. Easy fix.
---
Possibly, could just be the most used ones
---
Knew it was going to be a Huntress clip just by the title.
---
It is if they get camped/tunneled.
---
In this mutually agreed upon scenario, that it true, and it is true that if a killer gets rushed their game is ruined.
---
I cant imagine why people hate this killer ü§î
---
Feel free to! : )
---
Yes, I‚Äôm being that guy for you making claims you haven‚Äôt proven. Say I uploaded a replica of your post but with your name in place? Take this to PSN if it‚Äôs really happening.
---
Well it would work on console. 
---
Sorry I don't respect or have to respect anyone who makes dumb argument, This is how people like Trump got into power. 
---
I got locked in a locker too lol it was also against the plague 
---
Exactly! There is not a downside to doing something like this which makes me think they are just completely unable to distinguish an actual disconnect from a rage quit. I just have hopes that dedicated servers will help punish it but unfortunately, with how this game has been handled lately, I do not have faith it will
---
Lol.  I literally came here to comment just look at a wall, but that's the EZ way out.  These perks are the only way to outskill them.
---
I agree but what I‚Äôm saying is that if you have fun by being an asshole to others you can‚Äôt expect not to have any consequences I.e. disconnects
---
tbf there isnt always a wall and if there's even a teeny tiny open spot in said wall you can still get blinded
---
That might just encourage shitty gameplay from the killer trying to encourage rage quits lol 
---
PS button (or w/e xbox equiv) and close app
---
I get what you mean and sorta remember the GoW 2 years but nowadays it just isn't the same, even if it was they could just restart or power cycle their console
---
2 of these were massively nerfed in the past 2 years, maybe they're trying to tell us something.
---
Not with the new DS change.
---
What the actual fuck does Trump have to do with anything?! How many people do you convince by calling them bitches or girls? None. You shouldn‚Äôt treat a debate as an argument or nobody wins. Don‚Äôt treat ignorance with hate. How is OP supposed to learn that what he is saying is most likely wrong?
---
most of the time I have to derank myself 3-4 times during a month in order to avoid being red ranks and having crazy queue timers
---
pipping is extremely easy.  most people who think it's hard probably just play extremely immersed and end up not doing the things they need to pip (gens, unhooks, etc)
---
As a survivor main I feel like the luck might be broken because I get off the hook lately probably 7 times outta 10 with no luck add ons 
---
Try spies from the shadows it works really well now especially when you combo with M&amp;A you can get the jump on people easy 
---
Dude, everyone is dc'ing nowadays. They get downed for the first time? DC. They fail Dead Hard? DC. They lost the mindgame with the pallet? DC. It's not your killer, it's the people who can stand losing.
---
can't\*
---
I'm japanese (well I live in Japan) and I will miss you too!
---
Yeah this seriously needs to be fixed. 
---
you're still completely ignoring that pipping got a massive overhaul when the Plague was released
---
so you're still just talking out of your ass.  Pipping is near impossible as survivor now due to that change since it's 100% team-dependent.
---
Fear-mongering based on their own projection?  People like him will never want to be convinced to begin with. If that had been the case, they wouldn't make argument about something based on their own paranoia. 
---
They really don't deserve all the hate.  Yes, we should report the issues we find so they can fix them.  Yes, they do take a long time sometimes to fix the issues.  But sending them insulting things on forums and social media has to be demoralizing.  They go to work each day and put their heart and soul into making the game better FOR US.  They don't show up to collect a paycheck and say "hmm what can I fuck up today?"  
---
I would have to disagree. As a survivor BBQ does not feel healthy at all. And without it, would you just "soft patrol" since you don't know where anyone is? I don't disagree with patrolling if you're running it and no one shows up, but I still think it feels unhealthy. I only play survivor though so I'm probably biased.
---
I saw this earlier and had similar thoughts.
---
The obvious thing to do would be to include different types of ghost with different abilities.  Have a "poltergeist" type, like the one in the trailer, that can possess and move objects.  Then have other ghosts, say, one that could possess another player for a brief time, or a pyrokenetic ghost, or a creepy Borden axe-murderer ghost.
---
I'm not sure that fits the style of game they're going for, though.
---
Where there's 1 survivor 15m from the hook, there's 200 survivors 2.3mm from the hook.
---
Is this lunch? 
---
Lol. Get off my post. Yet another person who thinks there words mean anything. You're obviously here to argue. And I don't partake in petty nonsense. I made an informative post letting players know. So they don't fall victim to these POS people. And there's always gotta be the 1 individual that feels they need to open there mouth about the matter. Dude just get lost and find someone else's post to throw your 2 cents into.
