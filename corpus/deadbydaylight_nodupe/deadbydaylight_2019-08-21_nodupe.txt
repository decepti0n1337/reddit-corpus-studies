I kinda wish the killer had an ability to regress gate progress or you couldn‚Äôt 99 it but could only like get it to 85 or 90 and if they let go before finishing to try getting it to 99 it would just stay at there because it takes a lot of the pressure from end game collapse
---
---
---
Very, very little especially if you haven‚Äôt seen the two seasons before this third one. I recommend you watch if you have time to binge.
---
And so what you have P3 killer? I love how you didn't even mention if you play him or not, you just said you have a P3 killer. Good job, do you want a medal? You're shitty at the game if you don't understand how meta works and I really doubt you're getting 4k every game to not derank as Bubba in red ranks, but hey keep thinking you're good. 
---

---
Also your name is so "interesting" I just had to look on your profile and woah. Do you feel edgy when you're being a racist cunt?
---
No, Scrappy would be the killler.
---
Are we forgetting that Hag is still a human
---
It just came out.

Killer Perks: BBQ &amp; Chili, Corrupt Intervention
---
Survivor Perks: Wake Up, Distortion
---
you work fast daiyum
---
I k ow that she has an advantage for being dark, but she didn't need this hard of a Nerf.
---
I‚Äôm so sorry, that‚Äôs depressing
---
I actually wanted to buy him this week but decided not to because I felt like with my luck it would be in the shrine. Good thing I listened to my gut feeling
---
Well you have noed ruin and bloodwarden I would dc as well
---
Wait, if appendix is on the right, oh no, not the large intestine.
---
Especially if I'm playing Wraith
---
I use to think this shot all the time too playah, then I got mad and GOT GUD, all jokes aside, get a little better bro and be more immerssed, if ur getting caught out alot right off the bat its annoying AF,  try hitting a gen then move around to know where the pallets are then move to another gen , get to know whats going on around you try running urban evasion its dope af for crouching around a rock right around the killer. but do that. Be immersed till you get a really good game flow
---
How
---
I know she had an advantage for being dark, but did she really need this much of a nerf?
---
Ngl wanted pharmacy instead of wake up but I'll take it
---
Let's not.  That thing gave me nightmares of faces melting off as a kid.  I know what I'm walking about, I didn't seen Indiana Jones until I was a young teenager.
---
Thank your behaviour for putting distortion at the same time as bbq.
---
Or EGC begins when last gen pops, not when exit gates open.
---
I bought cannibal and unlocked BBQ when I gave up after last weeks shrine.
---
They made up for the last two garbage shrines with BBQ alone. I'm so happy rn. I can already see the sweet sweet bloodpoints rolling in.
---
No way! My friend started playing last month, and he's gonna get himself a BBQ!
---
I bought BUBA for BBQ, shrine hates me.
---
Delicious. Finally, some good fucking perks.
---
At least we got bbq and chili doe
---
**THANK GOD,** I was hoping I'd half to cough up and buy him.
---
I like what you are doing, but as a fan of Halloween I would spun the camera around and had Myers in the Window and then looked away for a second then gone back to have him gone. Watching him walk away ruins it.
---
This should have been what it was from the start increase the time back to 3 mins and make it an actual intense race to get out
---
Controller isn't bad. You can map buttons we can just swap it for one of the triggers
---
Damn beat me too it because I wanted a higher quality screenshot instead of a phone pic. 
---
Distortion too... almost as a sort of acknowledgement that bbq and chili's use was gonna skyrocket
---
It wasn‚Äôt the same match. And Welp I never called the player trash lmao. It was just a rant because I ended up losing my item and wasting my time for someone I‚Äôm pretty sure just gave up.
---
Eh you should be happy. Knock Out is also pretty good and Franklin's is a great middle finger to use against SWF with flashlights and instaheals.
---
BHVR actually giving survivors tips and giving the counter to BBQ, all in all a great shrine this week
---
THEY FINALLY DID IT
---
I do want the m9ney for him 3 days ago, I am having a fucking stroke
---
Everybodys talking about bbq but currupt is finally in the shrine
---
How is Corrupt Intervention? I seems like it would be good for controlling the map early game.
---
Maybe     [r/wishywooooshy](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Is it worth unlocking corrupt intervention?
---
[removed]
---
Stop. Just stop.
---
BBQ, a perk basically made for getting a shitton of bloodpoints, being put in the shrine shortly before one of the most hyped up chapters is released. Hmmmm....
---
Happens to me all the time man
---
Yup, agreed.
---
What kinda shit is that üòÇ
---
Pharmacy was there like 2 or 3 weeks ago if I remember right though
---
Still dickhead move tho
---
I would want to see Andre Toulon.
---
Bruh I got the cannibal like 2 weeks ago for bbq and I still haven‚Äôt found it in any of my killers blood web
---
I am inevitable.
---
You will get stomped, a lot. But you will get better. Watch Fungoose if you care for improving by watching a good player stream  the game (honestly he‚Äôs the best killer and survivor). 
---
And don‚Äôt play killer until you have at least 50 hours, or at least just don‚Äôt expect to 4k. DO NOT USE URBAN EVASION. Seriously it does not help in the long run. Don‚Äôt use Self Care until have game knowledge when to use it. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to not heal and do a gen and take that risk. Some people think they have the game knowledge but they still do not even after making it to rank 1
---
Some of this won‚Äôt make sense but in time if you play enough it will
---
It really was üò≠
---
I‚Äôm hoping the generators are split between the upside down and normal realm, so games will be longer as gems will be further apart.  
---
Hopefully the Dem creates those portals and survivors can get through them and destroy them slowing the killer down.
---
I've tried it a bit in kyf, its good for delaying gens early on, but after its basically a useless perk
---
Damn I'm sorry dude üòî
---
When i saw barbecue and chill i cried tears of joy
---
My sister said hes the best character but idk that commercial which I heard before every YouTube video for a month made me hate it. Otherwise I am sympathetic but idk.
---
Just mentioned those for the points you get. 
---
OhTofu on YouTube has a bunch of good tutorial videos. I would recommend some of those that interest you. Here is his playlist. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBS8ru85UBhmmJHP-cF7n7x68X-jPazqO
---
There niche at best but my issue is I've had anxetity ever since I was a kid now I'm annoyed I wasted my money and I'm basically having a stroke.
---
Only upside for me is when I get Miguel levelled up I can run him with PWYF
---
but c'mon devs, why so you do this to me!
---
I Always Come Back and One Place to Hide are pretty overpowered. Also, can you choose which animatronic jumpscares or is it random? Powers that rely on RNG are historically bad to play with and against.
---
Damn, and I literally just leveled bubba up to get it. Oh well, those extra blood points is going straight into the doctor.  Picked up corrupt intervention though since it looks -real- nice.
---
These perks are really unbalanced, and having a power based on rng is a bad idea. I like the Idea of Afton being a killer tough. Also having some perk icons would be nice
---
It's amazing for Trapper, and honestly if you have a couple thousand shards, I would do it, but if you don't have it, get BBQ first
---
for a second i thought scoobs had a blonde wig on..
---
Not constant vomit coming from the mouthes of 70 percent of the community.
---
I've been thinking of how to rework leatherface, and one way is to have a different way to dispose of survivors: freezers. In his movie he is shown meat hooking people but also storing them in freezers and having people save them.
---
I literally bought Leatherface last week and leveled him to 50 just to get BBQ, FeelsBadMan
---
And yet it takes more than a minute to find a match as killer.
---
Oh boy I can already see the ironic use of head on
---
We don‚Äôt want atmosphere we want content.
---
GOLDEN EXPERIENCE
---
More like 85 but its a thing man. We all just mobe on from it. Some people profit off of it. Its a cycle.
---
I bought Nina, I am currently having a heart attack + stroke.
---
To be fair if you say you want doll chucky as killer but not demogorgon than your a hypocrite, he is literally a doll
---
I Like Your Name
---
The camper? That title already belongs to someone else.
---
Sounds cool, fresh concept me likes
---
plug walk
---
actual good shrine
---
This is amazing! Great work!
---
I want Nancy's purple dress from this season .
---
I NEEEEEEEED IT
---
Fungoose is excellent. I'm surprised that he has so few subs on YouTube.
---
I was so busy with finals last time. I'm really happy it's up again.
---
Hit 40 on Bubba earlier in the day and now this happens.  Guess I've saved my shards at least... and Franklin's Demise is hilarious to use, so it wasn't a waste.  Even got my first Adept achievement, which I was pretty stoked about.
---
I WAS LITERALLY ABOUT TO SAY THAT WHAT YOU READ MY MIND
---
alearean‚Äô 
---
you down for discord? i‚Äôm 14 of it matters
---
I‚ÄôM LOVIN‚Äô IT
---
I was hoping for a ‚Äúwhat? You wanted more?‚Äù
---
A killer feast!
---
Survivor side ain't bad. Pales in comparison to killer this week.
---
Was it just me or did I hear the crow caw when I first watched this?
---
I'm actually wanting to know would you actually make me a shirtless myers and sell me it
---
Man it‚Äôs crazy how a single perk can turn the shrine from good to amazing.
---
It just seems like a perk that doesn‚Äôt deserve a slot. It is utterly pointless in the actual gameplay. Sure you can be incentivized to do altruistic actions but good players should already know when to save and not. I‚Äôm not asking for this perk to be on the level BBQ is but combining WMI with WGLF would really give it viability at higher ranks
---
Same. I bought Legion and LF for perks and I was only able to level up Legion before this.
---
I have never dc'ed in a game, but the doctor brings me down to like 25 fps it is painful to play in general...
---
I think you‚Äôre onto something
---
Reddit is blowing up with people being crazy over bbq and chilli when they could have bought keatherfave for 5 dollars a long time ago lol
---
Do you know if those 2 were swf, I notice when I solo que and people do that shit they are...
---
Sucks that some swf are like that
---
I changed it to the F key per a recommendation and it‚Äôs better than space, but have still failed it when I‚Äôve been doing it for a long time. Honestly it just didn‚Äôt make any sense when the rest of the game is based around strategy.
---
Literally bought leatherface last week because of that perk smh
---
I hope you all know we are in for nothing but steve memes for months.
---
idk if i dont get this meme if its for real or not but your are able to, to some degree? just choose the killer with the theme that you like and then exit to the menus? it will play until you switch killers or maybe (idk survivors)....
---
im batman
---
Yeah but I feel that BBQ and Chili is pretty much the sole reason for me :/
---
The dev literally says in the first 10 comments that the devs SUPPORT voice chat and communication. You said they didn‚Äôt. 
---
Yeah people are gonna bitch and moan about communication but if you aren‚Äôt good enough to handle it, look up a YouTube video and get better. The ama they did had a comment saying they‚Äôd like a solo game to be more like swf. 
---
Logically this would only bring more people to the game, playing with others is way more fun when you can communicate. Killers will get better at handling group situations which is literally what the game is. 
---
It‚Äôs funny how only shitty killers complain about swf, just like shitty survivors complain about ‚Äúcamping‚Äù when they get downed after their whole fukin team hook rushes. 
---
Dbd is moving that way and I‚Äôll be sure to keep you updated when I find more cause i know itll make you so happy, princess‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Borrowed time doesn‚Äôt give BP stacks unlike BBQ. Thats all I‚Äôm asking, an altruistic perk which helps BP gain AND has an added side affect.
---
I did have BBQ but only level 2, and it took about 30 minutes I think, they started hiding alit.
---
I know what you mean. I was on at 1:30am before work today. My fifth game I finally got someone who wasn't face camping every hook. These were rank 10s too....
---
Is there gameplay of the demigorgon?
---
BHVR didn't believe it either. A consultant estimated 500k buys over its lifetime, but they got 500k buys in the first few weeks of launch.
---
It makes... no sense. There is an almost 0 chance of him ever making it into this game, and he's certainly not more dangerous than some of the other accursed maniacs in this game, or some other options to come, so almost seems flat out disrespectful to put a property, that they will likely never get, on a pedestal like that. Ontop of all of that, it also may cause potential confusion for new players.
---
I got bubba 3 days ago so I'm basically on sucicide watch.
---
Feels bad man :(
---
They released some i game screenshots, the top image is the trailer they released
---
Exact fucking same here
---
it is the main goal for the killer?
---
Thank you for going in depth with the other perks! You‚Äôre the best part about the community to newbies!
---
He couldn‚Äôt get you.. so he lag-switched.. lmao sad.
---
Yeah happening here to me and my friend to.
---
Your post should be pretty self-explanatory as to why you didn't pip.
---
I'm fine with licensed dlcs. I just need some breathing room in between you know? Like the idea of the plague is awesome. And it's not something you'll probably ever see out of a licensed killer. Most licensed killers are slashers. All they did was chase and slash at people. The exception being freddy. Which yes is what this game is about but my point is simply the original killers are a bit more creative. Things like nurse and spirit having powers akin to the Freddys of the world. Plague being her own thing entirely.
---
Now sure, there are also a handful of original killers without ridiculously unique things. Trapper lays traps. Legion runs after people. But my point is simply alot of the coolest ideas come from non licensed stuff.
---
Said that, it kinda sucks that the stranger things dlc has to come out right after two other licensed dlcs. As the demogorgon has the potential to be a really unique killer. It has a stigma with me personally that I'm already not happy because I just want an original killer right now and instead i get another licensed dlc and one that I am not particularly invested in
---
BBQ, and the perk that counters BBQ xD Gooood times.
---
It doesn‚Äôt feel like a waste to me. I‚Äôve had BBQ for around a year now. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had it this whole time
---
Not everyone wants to buy a killer they don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd like playing just for one perk though‚Äî Happy cake day btw! üéÇüéÇ
---
It‚Äôs funny when you run object, because they can see you, but they don‚Äôt come after you or else their ‚Äúhard(ly)-earned‚Äù  reward would run free out of their grasp.
---
Thanks, yours is great too
---
I love Hag. One of the few killers that requires planning ahead of time. 
---
Hag is also good when I don‚Äôt want to pay as much attention. I go around, set traps, go fishing and wait for a bite. 
---
Eventually you will level them up just from the daily tasks. Just try and have fun with it. Good luck.
---
Its suppose to be combo'd with WGLF.
---
they still have to catch them and find all 4 different survivors to get a stack so honestly, it is harder than just healing someone
---
Wake up was just in wtf
---
r/beansinthings is your friend
---
Hex:McDonald's
---
*Robin
---
Hex:
---
 pretty good job so far
---
Yeah same here.
---
I would just surrender myself in that moment
---
Lmao
---
Agreed. Telltale didn‚Äôt even tell them like to stop working on the game or that they were going under. Night School found out pretty much the same way we all did.
---
Bro you can‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs cruel. The number 360 didn‚Äôt even exsist in the 80‚Äôs much less an alternate dimension.
---
We need to protect the prophecy
---
Y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need to go batshit insane because the new DLC is from a show you like
---
Ah fuck I was late nevermind
---
Heres to hoping you see it in the bloodweb. I got excited for this and forgot that i unlocked it last month and still havent gotten it on a killer.
---
He needs a skin with those yellow dish washing gloves please
---
It's like no one is forcing you to buy the skins. 
---
"ThEy SHoUlD bE fiXiNg tHe gAMe iNsTEaD!"
---
The team that develops those aren't the same ones working on the game mechanics. The company is allowed to make different departments especially if one of those generates revenue.
---
SCOOPS AHOY PLS!
---
And take up two perk slots? When BBQ is stronger with one?
---
What's the point in Distortion if you can just hide in a Locker to counter BBQ aura?
---
If anything create a macro to just activate (provided you‚Äôre on PC), my fingers have thanked me ever since
---
Jesus Christ. The game has been out not even two years... that‚Äôs too much time to spend on a game idc how fun it is
---
This is actually pretty decent
---
Personally I love it. I thought it was overhyped but I was bored one night so I gave it a shot and I freaking loved it.
---
They really just need to make it hold to struggle. It‚Äôs a super easy fix and yet they won‚Äôt do it.
---
Note: if you hit someone with Franklins and they used a purple hand offering (where they don‚Äôt loose an item on death) they do lose the item. The purple hand only works if you are holding an item when you die. Franklins makes them drop it. That camping make people go back for items so you can get free hits.
---
I got it to tier 3 on Ghostface already so I'm happy.
---
How they look in the tralier is not necessarily equal to how they'll look in the game.
---
Watching him walk away would probably make the films much funnier
---
Being broke also works
---
He'd come with a perk to hook himself cause the killer can't do it right for shit.
---
The DBD community honestly has some of the weirdest and dumbest complaints I've seen, just a couple games ago a killer said "DS abusers get the 4 man, no exceptions", i have no idea how you would abuse DS other than just having the perk and using it
---
I don't know about people in general but Freddy is definitely on my dodge list, even before his rework.
---
I feel stupid now. How have I not thought of this. How did you do it, just put left click on repeat?
---
8000? Damn
---
WHEN DOES THIS GO AWAY
---
Clowns was the most theatrical. That I why I enjoyed the whole Chapter. It really encapsulates what Behaviour can do with the game.
---
Corrupt Intervention is really good
---
Baby Ashley!
---
Perks: It‚Äôs raw!
---
              Where‚Äôs the lamb sauce?
---
              Idiot sandwich
---
Please open an online store or something
---
so you're against all licensed dlc I assume? hate michael myers too?
---
Yo they should add them in. We‚Äôre getting Stranger things. I think they could go Stranger.
---
Troo
---
Survivors do have WGLF, but also games last longer for killers on average because you can die mid-match. The more you play the game, you will be able to see how to get more BP as a survivor. Another big thing is that killers get points in all categories for starting and completing a chase, and survivors only get BP in one category. However, there are certain playstyles that can effectively get BP in all categories.
---
But as a survivor I want to enter the upside down world!
---
Agreed, except honestly if you have a keyboard or controller that‚Äôs older sometimes it will register has letting go even if you didn‚Äôt. My space bar has that issue, which is why I changed to the F key which is more reliable.
---
Why would you buy a character on shrine reset day
---
Hmmm more cosmetics with fix this
---
Returning after a long time of not playing.
---
I'm down with all the basics but killer especially is super unrewarding for me simply for the amount of times I get stomped on and get 0 sacrifices, my chases aren't terrible and I've sometimes managed to catch clearly skilled survivors because thankfully they haven't made it much harder zone people off, but when it comes to dealing with them as a group the coordination is insane and honestly to be expected from regulars.
---
I made the mistake of buying MM because I just love the character and didn't realise he's an incredibly wonky killer who requires a whole different approach to be effective (but I'm learning).
---
Sorry for long windup but basically I'm just asking for helpful/relevant killer tips (mainly for Hillbilly and MM) that are gonna make up for my nearly 2 year absence.
---
Also maybe just the top 5 or so pieces of advice you would want any survivor on your team to know.
---
Thanks guys, looking forward to properly getting re-invested in this game again &lt;3
---
Leatherface is a D tier killer who I'll never play, I'm not spending 5 dollars on that shit.
---
I have never spent money for cosmetics on this game but I'm ready to pull out my wallet if they bring scoops ahoy
---
I've been wanting to do a flip flop build, but I've been afraid of it not working. But I see here it clearly works!
---
Just to share my idea for a full flip flop build, I want to see how FF + Tenacity and maybe even unbreakable would work.
---
this makes me wish for a younger Ashley cosmetic closer to the Evil Dead movies
---
Next Tuesday I believe
---
In store cosmetics numb nuts. I already got my athlete face, Smart face, and bloody face
---
333 days straight if you add it up.. then calls himself a survivor main when all his killers were p3 lol. Uhh, youre a DBD main dude, not a survivor main
---
Probably because they were the people who think that doc Is OP
---
They should, problem is if they could, I'm not easy how easy getting a license for them would be though
---
Except the only perk they can tell I had was ruin soo
---
I may have to look into that, thank you!
---
That sounds like a salty survivor to me
---
I will buy one from you
---
Since she‚Äôs kicked the Bucket, she would‚Äôve been perfect to bring back but Steve/Nancy are pretty prominent characters besides the kids (who dbd don‚Äôt want to show being murdered).
---
Late but I like the look of the perks!
---
YES I AM ABLE TO GET IT THEN THANK YOU STRANGER
---
This is all good info! Hopefully the devs see how the game can possibly be damaging to people‚Äôs hands or hard on people that already have hand issues. It seems like a simple problem, but still needs to be fixed.
---
I agree. Some days I don't wanna feel like I have to fight to win or stay balanced with my pips. I just wanna have a game that I feel like I'm pretty good at after a long day at work. I'd love to do DbD 80:20 PvP;PvAI
---
I‚Äôm curious, why? He is balanced not op but not pig levels of nerfed
---
For a shrine that's suplosedly random it sure does have some big brain tactics.
---
I haven't seen Fungoose, will check em out. I suggest Monto, No0b3 and Otzdarva for entertainment and learning about different builds.
---
It's going to take you a long time, I would say 80-90 hours without using the shrine at all. Just break down and buy the DLC on steam unless it is Darkness Among Us, because the grind for shards and player levels is a very long and bad one that needs some kind of rework. I recommend buying every DLC but Darkness among us and any you dislike, and when you have the large amount of spare shards, spending them on the garbage that is Legion or Jeff.
---
Corrupt Intervention is a better version of Ruin. It makes you rely on your skill, what you can get done in 180 seconds. Ruin makes you rely on luck, it‚Äôs very easy for a survivor to just spawn near your totem and you can‚Äôt get there in time or can‚Äôt juggle watching it and putting pressure on the map
---
lol I love cracking up randos when I get invited to a party with them on Xbox. every time I get chased, I'm like ZOINKS!! and they're always like oh that man's gettin chased. haha
---
I played like 1 game as Bubba before I switched back to killers I like. You dont need to play a killer to fump BP into them.
---
Pretty dope
---
I grinded to 1 mil yesterday. It took me exactly 23 matches in 5 hours of play time (including lobbies time) to com from 0 to 1.000.000. 
---
I played nothing but Billy with Barbecue to double my gains. Could've used some offerings like Survivor Puddings or BPS to reduce the time even more but I decided to go with just BBQ.
---
Because I'm an idiot clearly
---
Guys. Holy. Fucking. Shit(post). Thank you all so much for this one meme I made in Biology today. With all the likes that this post got, you guys got me all the way to 2K karma and you could not believe how good that makes me feel. Thank you all for this. It has improved my self-esteem on the internet of memes.
---
Noted! Thanks!
---
I thought this was supposed to be My Bloody Valentine
---
Was closing to getting bubba, glad I waited
---
Got leather face to 35 yesterday after buying him. I'm upset
---
untill the demogorgon comes out
---
Way easier to do on the keyboard. Don't worry about it, it barely works anymore due to hitboxes and lag, so it's not as powerful as it used to be.
---
You are considered broke because you don‚Äôt want to spend money for DLC on a video game, nice
---
New kilker ability scooby snacks the "dog" will.    put a snack on you whan your down making him be able to see you everywhere the counter eatting it
---
Herobrine??
---
Fair enough
---
Much better
---
You don't say
---
I don't think it's fun when everybody isn't taking you and your killer of choice seriously and is just making fun of you
---
I doubt it will go on sale one month after it drops. My guess is it will be $10, because I don't think they'll go all the way to $15. And anything in-between is still possible.
---
Update: killer: hero brine.
---
I mean have you seen the amount of crossovers scooby doo has had.
---
Thanks! I'm using ritual pack, colored with Happy clown, which you get [here\~](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/cnacs8/ritual_complete_pack_colored_with_happy_clown/)
---
Swiped right on her
---
After getting to tier 2 try and get just a tiny bit below tier three, that way you can set up a insta exposed when in a chase with a healthy survivor. In addition to that, when somebody is unhooked take the opportunity to stalk both the unhooked and the unhooker to get enough evil, that way you can insta down the unhooker
---
All you need to know is crouch and run. The rest is point and click.
---
third
---
God i hate you with the little line
---
Thank you for the information! As if now I don't have Jeff but I think I may let Distortion slide. I'd like to keep some extra shards (just in case) and I think I can play around without it. I think I'll definitely grab Corrupt Intervention though, it sounds pretty useful from what I've heard.
---
Hah, as if the Entity could ever hope to contain Shaggy.
---
I‚Äôve been saying this since the clown came out
---
From what I have seen, the perks with a simpler effect have a lower average rarity regardless of power level, and the more complex perks have a higher average rarity. Rarity is not a good indication of power level, so just ignore it.
---
Join us and die!üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èwelcome.

\*killer appears\* Zoinks! \*scootily-dootily-scootily-dootily-scootily-dootily-scootily-dootily-fwee!\*
---
Indeed, I really hope, it would be fun to play as a member of the team or as one of the monsters
---
Me failing skill checks: ‚ÄúMan this point and click adventure game is so fun!‚Äù
---
I disagree with not playing the killer. At least play a couple games as killer to understand track marks and blind spots/areas. It really helped me in evading/hiding and not just sprinting away... as a baby survivor I didnt understand how the killer kept finding me "so easy" until I played as killer. So no, dont expect to kill anyone, especially not 4k but it really does help to get the other perspective. It also helps with running away from the killer and understanding swings etc.
---
Also he's not an adult
---
He answered a comment i made. Pretty cool.
---
I also want to say that Alert wasn't on there because I never mentioned anything about me thinking Feng Min being a good starting character. I think she's a solid 3rd or 4th on my list of survivors to level to 50, but, as the person I replied to, is a fairly new player, I assumed that they don't have the shards to afford loads of perks. And I know it's very hard to level up survivors as a new player.
---
Dark Sense isn't a bad perk. It's very useful.
---
Alert isn't a bad perk, either.
---
It's all about the build you want and what works for you, and whether or not you have those perks unlocked.
---
Ya, to be fair I've been using Bubba ever since; usually have a few med-kits sprawled across the map
---
Wow i got jeff just for distortion -.-"
---
I've done it and seen it done in two lunges, but never one. Very nice.
---
As killer it is really hard to pip right now, they are planning to rework the system later this year. Don't worry about it, its a roll of the dice for now.
---
The ones at lower ranks are the worst assholes. They can‚Äôt even win graciously. As soon as I broke in to green ranks it‚Äôs all teabagging, cocky plays, bullying. :(
---
Yeah, making cartoon characters look realistic could be pretty hard (we all know what happened to sonic) but if they do end up adding them somehow it would be pretty cool
---
i hope you didn‚Äôt buy him because it‚Äôs on the shrine rn
---
When you spent all your shards the day before
---
Would unironically love it, but it's not happening in this kind of game lmao
---
I can't possibly see WB accepting to put their characters in a game that contains hooking and slaughter
---
oh well, too bad
---
Both of those killers suck NGL. Try Spirit, Hag, Nurse, Myers, Freddy if you are looking for good and fun killers
---
Console? Lag issues seem pretty common there.
---
I have 6 macros I can set on my keyboard. I‚Äôll definitely be doing that.
---
You arent wrong, but he's not the face of the franchise.
---
Gimme 125%
---
Too bad indeed but one can hope
---
Makes sense since Season 3 is set in 1985 making Nancy 18 and Steve 19. Meeting the "must be 18+" rule
---
Paragraph is a offical term though so I don't know what you're talking about on that part. (https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/467318/#Comment_467318)
---
&gt;There were original killers in between the licensed ones.
---
Yes there was, which was a nice change of pace from license after license however it was four original dlc **in a row** which was a good spot to drop a license instead of a back and forth of a period of original dlc then a period of licensed dlc.
---
&gt;It hasn't just been consecutive licensed killers so I'm not sure why you're upset
---
My original comment should explain my issue with it? 
---
&gt;I don't like how it's a back and forth between original stuff and licensed and hopefully this doesn't become the pattern.
---
aka: Them doing multiple Licensed dlc consecutively then swapping to doing Original dlc consecutively and repeating, hopefully this isn't the start of a pattern until we get a few more dlc to see if it is or not.
---
Working now!
---
Nah I‚Äôm messing lmao. I made a joke vid about the tar monster being the next killer around 2 years ago and it‚Äôs been an inside joke ever since.
---
They‚Äôll never see it coming
---
Still, we only need one post about it. Not one hundred.
---
When there's legit over 50 choices in killer for a FNaF chapter, I wouldn't be surprised if we got one and the other was one of the 10 skins or something
---
Demogorgan has that huge af mouth so he can eat the entire can of beans
---
I'd play this killer.
---
How many times was wake up there
---
Escaping is really difficult in the first 10-20 hours. I recommend playing with an experienced player or watching a YouTuber to see how they do it. You are still figuring out the game, don't worry about escaping, just try to be the last one alive.
---
Alright, just put me on r/Angryupvote and let's call it a day.
---
I‚Äôd love one of these of the doctor, if my boy could look as cute as this I‚Äôd pay all the money
---
I play solo, I don‚Äôt really want to wait longer queue times
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a shame, maybe eventually he can join but it really is an unfortunate event that‚Äôs going on
---
This character requires so much patience and exploitation of limited time frames its crazy.
---
Thanks dude.
---
1. Tuxedo Men??
---
2. Screw Will Smith
---
3. Coffin boner
---
4. Flip Flop
---
5. AssAssAssAssAssAssAssAssAssAss City
---
6. Bald Power
---
7. Wake Up
---
8. Window Rover?
---
Actually for a charity thing she played DBD on stream. She referred to whatever Killer it was as "Angry Groot"
---
Ohhhh, I see, tar monster as the next killer would be cool though, maybe it will work like a combination of plague and clown, he can charge his power from tar barrels on the map, shoots survivors with it to slow them down for a bit
---
900 less than that...
---
Nope Myers actually fits not a bunch of Netflix characters
---
Np, have fun with daddy Myers!
---
The Spirit is a top tier killer, right after Nurse
---
RemindMe! 7 days "what outfits does spooky man have"
---
definitely would be cool
---
The survivors learn about Lullaby before it is a threat, so they have plenty of time to find it. It's only good on Freddy and Doctor, because their powers affect skill checks in some way.
---
Ahh. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many Dwight meme tags.

---
It's always the Megs. . .
---
*Sigh*
---
What specifically is the problem? Do you get an error message, does the game crash, etc.?
---
Tbf you could spend a lot of those hours on one side. He could be 250 hours and be an ok killer but with only 50 hours on survivor, he‚Äôd be relatively new
---
I knew this was coming but That was actually very smooth. I‚Äôm impressed.
---
I really liked that game
---
Run range addons as nurse and it makes it easier to see survivors while blinking because you cover more area.
---
F
---
Its supposed to be my bloody valentine
---
The game crashes and completely turns off my PlayStation
---
Ok thx
---
Bro go look at my page, I made the demogordon. It's pretty sweet
---
He's trying to cope with it by making it less extreme in his head
---
yea but then the original killers would be left out of the fun
---
They want that hit thread.
---
Feels bad using a perk slot on BBQ/WGLF just to make the grind more bearable.  Excited to see What they have planned for lessening the grind coming up.
---
I was thinking about it, but I only have 8000 and I'm not sure how useful it is because after all it is only usable for the first 2 minutes
---
I hear that constantly but I play nurse and huntress with no issues on ps4
---
I have 500 hours on this game and did not know u got bloodpoints for this, perfect timing for the stranger things release ty
---
It feels really unfair when lag happens at key moments. I've been on both sides and used to say the killer was lag switching, but the amount of times a survivor has lagged after I have hit them giving me a free down is way too high, so 99% of the time it is the games fault. Don't worry about it, the survivors can't do anything about it, and if you didn't do anything wrong, don't feel bad :D!
---
It was number 1 on trending yesterday POG
---
Just thro them anyway when you play then. Having bbq and a survivor pudding give more bloodpoints anyway
---
Haha, idiot sandwich is the first thing I thought for a perk. Hmm, if a third survivor is in close proximity of an unsafe hook rescue, borrowed time and exposed are applied to the rescued survivor while the other two are instantly downed.
---
How much killer have you played? NOED does not ruin the game by any means, and while it usually guarantees one down, it can easily be countered by a single survivor who deals with the totems.
---
&gt;all above rank 15 
---
-
---
yeah seems about right
---
Damn it makes the game Devs life slot easier when their customers pretty much tell them what micro-trasactions to charge for next
---
I love me that flip-flop build, but I don't think going 3 perks deep into it is the game plan, but rather just Unbreakable+FF or FF+Tenacity. Leave room to do other things you know?
---
Add Breakdown to prevent your team mates from automatically farming you(I don't have a lot of perks as it is soooo) and you'll make the killers life hell if he decides to slug even a little bit.
---
Devs said they're going to fix how OOO and similar perks work with stealth killers...
---
So...wait for the fix I guess :P
---
I‚Äôve had a great experience with The Third Seal. It shuts down object and any aura perks.
---
IKEA map pls BHVR
---
I'd love to make him ^-^
---
I find that you ignore / avoid them for the most part, and play like an m1 killer whenever you do have to chase them. If they're in a SWF and call you out, there isn't much you can do against it from my experience :/
---
Hopefully someone else knows better
---
Such cute dogs, can I pet them?
---
i thought it was gonna be "hey! vsauce, michael here!"
---
They already are, but yeah I guess if you could choose then we could also get the holiday versions!
---
150% but only when chasing them thicc Steve cheeks
---
I was playing as trapper. 2 people remaining 1 a Jane who was hooked. She gets unhooked by the Meg. I chase the Meg, hook the Meg, and (this was on swamp) I go to the dock cause it was close to where Jane was hooked. I see her climb into a locker, and boom I won. I got called a hacker for finding her probably since I had no bbq or whispers. Guess what Survivors it‚Äôs called game sense.
---
i got so sick of that menu theme because it felt like they had it as default for AGES lol. it's a super cool theme tho ngl.
---
The base game has a lot of strong perks, and can be enjoyed on it's own. Some DLC's have strong perks such as Hag/Ace DLC, Spirit/Adam DLC, and Leatherface DLC, but you only have to buy the ones you want, and they aren't too pricey. Wait til they go on sale and you can buy 2 characters for 5$. Just treat it like you are paying more for the base game; they are content packs and in no means mandatory to have fun
---
It‚Äôs gonna be 2 weeks from next Tuesday before it drops officially just so ya know.
---
ok boomer
---
Chapter stream Thrusday with a PTB release the following Tuesday is how they've been doing the past few chapters afaik.
---
A great Alien classic game is AvP: Aliens vs Predator for the X360/PS3. Amazing gameplay, mediocre story.
---
Nah I really don‚Äôt see the point. Like others have said the default characters are really good, and I‚Äôm having a ton of fun with the free base game that came with ps plus. I‚Äôll probly buy the stranger things dlc just to support the game and then get another character with shards.
---
Pig's games were canonically always rigged so that survivors never escaped, so I'd say she counts for sure.
---
Is he Dwight?
---
Oh ok, wicked!
---
But still trending
---
Hag's mori has always looked like the worst to me.
---
Were did you get the gameplay
---
this made me laugh far harder than it probably should have. kudos.
---
Looks more like a Jeff but acts like a Dwight for sure
---
I would really reccomend Wispers once you get it to tier 3. It's function on Pig is to tell you when you should or shouldn't be crouching as you don't want to be moving around slowly if there is no one to hear your terror radius.
---
He‚Äôs the worst killer rn
---
I believe *blood points per hour* are favored for survivor because of killer queue times at the moment.
---
Get that comment to 360 pls
---
Stargate with Apophis and Teal'c!
---
Closing hatch &gt; Hooking a survivor
---
Have a friend walk you though some things.   My friends did this for me and you pick up things way faster.   It is indeed a difficult game.
---
And this is why imma switch from a meg main to a steve main. Meg mains nowadays are tiny brain
---
Welcome! It‚Äôs always great to see new players enter this community, and I hope you have a great time playing.
---
As a few others have said, you will come across some toxicity and salt. Don‚Äôt let that get in the way of your enjoyment- this is one fun as fuck game, and don‚Äôt let other people spoil that for you.
---
I totally agree. I've seen some hilarious claims as both killer and survivor, it's very much not one sided
---
Can't she start up tbe SWF and it will give you a killer of her rank?
---
Ah, a new player from Stranger Things. Figured the good news would bring new people, so, let me be the first, and likely only, one to say leave this hellhole of toxicity before it roots itself into you. No, really. I am not trying to be mean, a lot of people who play this game are just awful and rude and see it more as a bully simulator without consequences rather than a game
---
I think it's because PC is 60 fps and console is 30
---
Makes me think she did the dash attack to get it like that.
---
I guess it depends on the region. For me killer times are never too long and at night the killer queues are instant.
---

---
Shut up and take my money.
---
Only 2k shards? That sounds too good to be true
---
Jdwight
---
yeah, it's a little upsetting how many people are being negative. this is the first licensed chapter where i've seen and love all of the source material, so it's the most excited i've ever been for an upcoming chapter, and seeing people being rude about it makes me feel silly for being so excited. :(
---
#spacekookforkiller
---
I knew BBQ was gonna appear in the Shrine cus anytime I buy a character for teachables, they turn up in the shrine a week later. Happened when I bought Laurie for OoO as well :*
---
Thanks and no problem! Feels good giving back to the community
---
Jeffight Fairsen
---
I play mainly trapper. Why is this amazing for him more than others?
---
Thanks
---
Everyone is so happy that bbq is "finally" in the shrine even though anyone playing in 2018 had to wait literally a year since it didnt come out once last year.
---
his power gives you the S U C C
---
OMG I need both those perks for killer! I gotta play a shit ton to get those shards
---
why is it great for them? new dbd player and trying to get into killing as well, mostly trapper.
---
True but I hear how absolutely unplayable certian killers are due to framerates.
---
*BBQ and Chile
---
I can literally use the same argument you used against me though and. If you haven‚Äôt seen the show you cannot say the demigoron is memorable and you cannot campare it in any way to Xenomorphs by introduction, lore, badassery, design. Especially as the Xenomorph is the centrepiece of alien franchise. 
---
Both Isolation (game) and the original alien movie focused on the interactions of the Human main character and the Xenomorph. Comparing the demigoron one of films most iconic Alien is unfair to the demigoron.
---
 The sole reason why the demigoron is forgettable is because of the fact the human characters are well written and the acting is great and that took centre stage not the demigoron where it‚Äôs not even the main bad guy.
---
I saw the first season and first episode of 2nd. Couldn‚Äôt continue
---
I mean... Its been confirmed already?
---
Infinite XP?!?!
---
This is the ultimate *tryhard* here!
---
her cute lil pallet stun noise üòç
---
but no really, Piggy scares the shit out of me LOL. and also used to make me super salty bc i play mostly 20-12 ranks and they're pretty campy until you get into higher ranks.
---
It's a great sci-fi show on netflix about a secret lab that had an experiment gone wrong. It's set in the 80's and is definitely worth a watch.
---
ok? i play bubba trapper and hillbilly doesnt matter if i didnt say whether i played him or not tf i clearly mentioned that i had him p3 so obviously i play him, just because you‚Äôre bad at the game doesnt mean you have to go off on me and get all mad and shit idgaf
---
Is that how the mm works? I've seen games that would appear so but that is a horrible and heavily outdated system... pretty much every game these days goes by the highest players rank in the party or more commonly it averages the party out.
---
Thanks for the advice. I think I‚Äôll play survivor in the day since queue times are faster and I‚Äôll play my main 3, use an offering and item every match. Then at night I‚Äôll play two killers, Wraith and the Demogorgon since queue times are faster at night for me. :)
---
I am going to point out that many, MANY people on this Reddit said that this would be a shit idea. Chucky is one thing but this is another. Also when Chucky is inevitably added into this game even though I think he shouldn't be. I will take my t-baggings with grace.
---
Premonition is more complex to use because you have to be actively trying to trigger it while spine chill works passively. New players have lot's of other things to focus on instead.
---
Again, this is from mine and many others experiences that I know of.
---
Yea I know but I want to show my wife she didn‚Äôt believe me that I said it was hinted before it was announced.....just want to win an argument lol
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure its shared amongst the team
---
 I kinda feel like that other guy was the one that provoked a reaction, except it was a weak asf insult lol. 
---
"You live on a farm" üòÇüòÇ I doubt OP lives on a Farm.
---
I‚Äôll be your captain.
---
We need to make a petition to rename BBQ "Get in the bowl!"
---
A hahaha this nigga lookin for BEANS
---
I've played all the free characters and I have no trouble with them fps wise
---
Everyone hates Dvorah. Not gonna spoil mkx/mk11 story mode but she kills multiple fan favorite
---
Sweet, now I don‚Äôt have to play Plague!
---
I'm thinking it was hillbilly and thank you for correcting me.
---
It's a good start, I think, but it doesn't really do much besides making hook rescues take a bit longer. Add an incentive to go to the Upside-Down and a benefit for the killer when a survivor is there imo.
---
Fake left (or right) then suddenly spin the opposite direction. They‚Äôll swing for the first turn, and miss you when you beer back the other way.
---
I was playing as Trapper, R20. Hooked the survivors in this order...
---
1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 2
---
1 DCed before he was officially sacrificed. After the match I messaged him to find out why, and 1 (R14) called me a tunneler.
---
Does this look like a tunnel job to you?
---
I‚Äôve honestly been waiting for a Scooby doo chapter for years
---
I hope it‚Äôs not haunted grounds
---
Apart from some obvious throwing to get de-pipped? Are you on console and/or able to easily make a second account to play on with her?
---
This is one of the best memes I‚Äôve seen on this sub, hands down.
---
Shaggy would have custom sprint animation
---
I am the council.
---
 99.95% of all killers Rank 10 and up run BBQ so distortion is underrated imo.
---
Yeah I wanna add in that ever since the new patch with ghost face I feel like the performance is a lot better.
---
Can we play against the demogorgon on ptb?
---
Coffin boner
---
Early? This is 1 hour and a half late.
---
Looking for Cornn Flaeks
---
Alright, I will try out Spine Chill and then Premonition in a stealth build and rediscuss this tomorrow. I'll be happy to discuss this more with you then. 5 games with each seems good
---
Even before that I've had no troubles except when I've had internet troubles
---
I'm still nit used to the time adjustment....pretend I didn't say that
---
That's necrophilia.
---
How about his mori??
---
I think it might be called moonlight
---
That makes more sense. You get to have sexy time after the mori.
---
Firstly, no need to be toxic. Secondly, if you‚Äôve seen the show you‚Äôd know that it‚Äôs not the moonlight.
---
It consistently happens when I try to take a hit so my buddy can get away and they‚Äôll literally ignore me. It‚Äôs dumb
---
Yeah should‚Äôve aimed higher way higher
---
I don't think you get the purpose of licenses...
---
Lmao I did
---
The copyright is way too much of a clusterfuck to ever have a shot.
---
Unless you play Legion. Then there is only SUFFERING.
---
&gt;Third party programs are only at risk if they are not authorized by us. We have stated in the past that voice chat is okay to use. As a result, voice chat is **not cheating**.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;But assuming it was, how would we enforce this? How can you prove that people aren't communicating with their phones, or by playing in the same room as one another? You would end up in a mess of finger pointing and there is *absolutely no way to prove it*. We would be banning people purely on speculation, and that is not something we want to do.
---
I mean you pull the words out for me that support you stance. 
---
&gt;voice chat is okay to use.
---
If thats what you're basing this all off like wow....
---
Anyways though, you're getting weirdly aggressive, and trying to flex for no reason lol. So pretty much bringing an end to this conversation. Have a great day mate, and try to take it easy out there.
---
Shit
---
This is art
---
Early lmao your about the 59 th person to post this
---
The best way to track while using spirits ability is to litteraly run into the survivors. Spirit still has a model and collision while using her power, so if you suddenly can't move, you may be running into the survivor.
---
You get the hang of it after a while.
---
That is true, I guess I meant Jigsaw.
---
It's actually in there this week!

Spirit also looks like she‚Äôs doing the Carlton coincidence? Probably.
---
And this is why they should switch to private servers

You should've known as soon as you caved it in would come on the shrine. :P
---
Damn you lochness monster
---
üëç
---
I‚Äôm deadass maiming Steve
---
That's what you get for trying to BM üòò
---
Well, the main weakness to trapper is the time he takes to set his traps up. Usually survivors can get a gen done before he finds them, but with this perk, they can't perform gens, and the trapper gets all the time he wants to set his traps up without having to worry about the survivors getting gens done. Hope this advice helps!
---
LT Vile Purge
---
wow these survivors are getting super crazy
---
Um... If I'm not mistaken most of this sub was talking mad shit about how they would never add a killer like this into the game. I just hope that it is a really fun Killer that doesn't insta down. I'm tired of Ghostface.
---
He pulls down his pant, only to cut to the survivors face, with a mysterious green viscous liquid coming out of their mouths
---
Shut up you‚Äôre wrong always play Steve all other characters are bad
---
My mouse is very unresponsive when playing DBD. Only on DBD do I have this problem, some of my friends who play also have this problem. For example; to attack I have to smash M1 multiple times  to swing, press M1 multiple times to work on a gen. Does anyone else have this problem? Can it be fixed?
---
steam page for new chapter has a couple pictures. Including one that shows the killers power, and how survivors can interact with it in some way.  [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135280/Dead\_by\_Daylight\_\_STRANGER\_THINGS\_Chapter/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1135280/Dead_by_Daylight__STRANGER_THINGS_Chapter/)
---
You‚Äôre wrong and your opinion is wrong, play Steve only
---
Die
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Can we have Jager from RSS as a Survivor plz
---
anti meme
---
I‚Äôm a straight male and I‚Äôve beat it to Steve ‚ÄúThe Hair‚Äù Harrington
---
Haha true. But what else would they call him. I only remember them calling him Jason
---
Yeah i feel like i got it 2 weeks ago
---
I agree with your immersed playstyle build. I just disagree with Premonition. Spine Chill is an upgrade in every way from Premonition. It takes some getting used to, but is ten times more powerfull. *And not a single killer I have ever, ever faced does the sidwalk towards a gen thing that people say a killer *could do.
---
In the beggining of the match, Trapper and Hag dedicate most of their time setting up their traps. Is they don't have something like Hex: Ruin or Corrupt Intervetion, survivors can finish up to 2, maybe 3 generators in the meantime.
---
"The Loser"

tfw no void queen gf
---
I assume this is the proper channel for these types of topics (other than official dbd/behaviour forums - I've yet to see about making an account, though), so if it isn't, I'd appreciate it if y'all pointed me the right way!
---
I was harassed and threatened in post-game chat for being a woman, and even though I already reported the dude in game (and am planning to report him on steam ASAP), I do have a few questions.
---
1.) Is BHVR effective in handling reports on players? I feel like what was said to me is enough to merit a ban of some degree (I sure hope permanently), but obviously if they won't act on it, then I'm stuck in the mud (hence why I'm reporting on steam - I don't like the idea of someone playing online games and treating people the way he did to me).
---
2.) Would it be worth it to post it on Twitter/Tumblr/etc? This is more in the event that nothing is done, but I was wondering if contacting major DBD players such as no0b3, Scott Jund, etc to spread awareness would force something to be done against this guy - I doubt that BHVR would ignore something like this if people were clearly upset.
---
This is the first time in my roughly 10 years of serious gaming that this has happened to me, and while I feel that the threats made against me are basically empty (as the guy has no way of knowing what I even look like), it's still worrying to think that there's these kinds of players saying things without consequence; Again, I've reported him within the game, and am planning to report his steam account, but if nothing is going to be done about it upon using the common channels of reporting his account, I still want to try and do the most I can to make sure that attention is generated on it, at least - I can handle the usual toxicity within dbd, and usually I find it laughable, but I don't think that a threat against me is something that I can laugh away; That's when proper poison enters the community.
---
(Keeping specifics of the threat, etc omitted due to potential to trigger someone, but the threat is incredibly serious.)
---
How about one of the cat people from Zombie Island
---
Same thing for stocks, crypto, gambling..I always joked I should publish what I do so everyone else can do the opposite lol
---
HA I see what you did any way
---
Why? Can you explain. I get that u are joking. I‚Äôm trying to figure out what if they had him in the game.
---
Lol it didnt stop there he kept trying to roast me
---
That was like me getting the plague yesterday praying that infectious fright wouldn‚Äôt show up. And it didn‚Äôt yay
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure who‚Äôd fit Scooby.... But I can see Jeff with styled hair and a tan cowhide jacket with brown chaps, almost like a cowboy outfit!
---
Holy shit. That would be great
---
I use it on Trapper because it lets me focus on trapping a smaller area and brings them towards me and my traps. It's also nice having 3 gens locked for two whole minutes whereas ruin majority of the time goes within 30 seconds of being able to move. Red rank survivors can also power through ruin.
---
Doesn't borrowed time only work when the survivor is unhooked by a person who has it?
---
The only people this should be relatable to in that case are people who purposely go after the survivor who was just unhooked to hook them again.
---
Of course bbq comes out after I spend all my thingys (I don‚Äôt know what there called lol)
---
You have swayed my opinion.
---
Ikr. I think it would have been cooler than the demi.
---
At least we got Steve
---
I have a prestige 3 level 50 hag so should I learn a basic killer?
---
Or see him get his throat and innards ripped out by hag
---
And then there is the chance it's gonna be a complete joke
---
Hours and hours of me maining Freddy. Gone. Reduced to ashes. Now I‚Äôm 100% a Steve main. No more murder for this murderer.
---
*One of us!*
---
Run third seal. It shuts down Object
---
Spirit is definitely not broken. Her add-on Prayer Beads is largely considered broken but she herself is not broken.
---
Reinstall?
---
That looks amazing! You making any others?
---
Steve is what I like to call a douche canoe
---
Yes. Put simply, the game takes a snapshot of your Steam Save when you join the ptb a few days before it goes open for test, so when you go in, you have to have bloodpoints ahead of time to go into and test anything with any perks or else you just run KYF.
---
I was meaning about when they use borrowed time from another survivor, I didn‚Äôt say that because it seemed a little too long

Hex: Sad boy hours
---
Tried it and it didn‚Äôt work
---
No.  Have you tried texting someone on a console, it takes way too long.  An after game chat would barely get used because of how long it would take to type something out before everyone leaves.
---
From a Ps4 player, it would be awsome of we had a post game chat, but it's just wouldn't work right now.
---
I fucking know right seriously why can‚Äôt people be happy and have something that they love personally I loved every licensed character that‚Äôs come out I love Saw, Halloween, Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Left 4 Dead Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream (Scream is my personal favorite horror movie of all time) but I could never imagine being mad about a new killer being from a property i didn‚Äôt like actually I‚Äôve seen like half of Stranger things season 1 so I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself a fan but I can still enjoy a cool new chapter (with ducking two new survivors) if you don‚Äôt like the source of the character just don‚Äôt buy the chapter and if you like their abilities and perks BUY them it‚Äôs as simple as that
---
You can use this strategy for all the perks in the game. Are you ready? This is a very complex strategy but I have faith you can pull it off.
---
#READ THE PERK'S DESCRIPTION
---
You can do this on the scoreboard screen or just open a KYF lobby where all perks are available.
---
There would be nothing wrong with putting a spoiler tag I suppose lol I'm just saying I would NOT be upset to see this meme had I not seen Stranger things yet. I mean hell the new chapter trailer is more of a spoiler for than this since it shows the demigorgon, which isnt seen until late in the first season.
---
Bill's visual rework sure is something
---
DBD would be a much scarier game if survivors played in First Person.
---
I mean most killer just dc before you can even say anything, and once the killer dc‚Äôs nobody can talk
---
Therapist: InsidaBilly and the Ruin Beasts aren‚Äôt real. They cannot hurt you. 
---
The image in the furthest corners of my mind:
---
True
---
I understand how ptbs work I just didn't understand what exactly you meant by no perks
---
but the way it works now is that it doesn't reset after you quit
---
Of course, its a different playstyle completely so it will vary it up a bit. Knowing how to play every Killer won't hurt I suppose.
---
USS Butterscotch - The Captain goes down with the ship and you‚Äôre not one to disappoint. When taking protection hits for a survivor, earn a token. When at 3 tokens, hit E to whip out Steve‚Äôs bat and swing it in a 360 degree arc. If it hits the killer, he‚Äôll be stunned. After use, the tokens are consumed and the perk is deactivated. Applies exhaustion upon use.
---
Bananaphobia
---
You monster.
---
I like this template
---
zoinks
---
Guess doc will have to wait a bit more
---
This might be a shocker to you but not everyone plays a game because the killer is strong or weak. Certain killers are BORING or FRUSTRATING to play against. Currently Hag, Freddy and Spirit are my top 3 to DC on sight.
---
But isn‚Äòt he making it more extreme?
---
Try setting your Windows zoom/resolution thing to 100% on the desktop settings if it is higher. I had this problem and that fixed it for me.
---
Wow, I posted this as a 2 weeks ago and it got deleted.

Jazzhands
---
Juat play dbd, R6 operation health 3.0 can wait
---
Every time that Object procs, and the killer *would see you, Distortion eats a stack and allows you to look at the killer *withought them seeing you back. Once SS protects Object, Object will no longer eat Distortion stacks.
---
That‚Äôs most matches with killer especially with No ED
---
Sounds like a plan :)
---
That‚Äôs right m8
---
I wasn't saying it's hard to learn the game it's more so that the game because of how it pairs people up currently I went against rank 17s as a rank 9 that's kinda stupid imo. They were really noobie I shouldn't  go against people around there right? I made it to rank 1 in 3ish weeks and I wasn't even good more so got bad players that made me get there.
---
Is this screenshot a hint at a Final Destination chapter? ü§£

Survivor: *blows up gen*

---
Amazing, but should've put a dev on mikes face
---
Had a Legion on Badham an hour or two ago. He wasn't AFK, but the dude wandered to the farthest corner of the map and spent all 15m just stabbing the wall. We all gathered around in concern for his mental well-being lol
---
I'm already half way there lol, 1200. When people say shards are too grindy to get I honestly dont agree. It takes around 3-4 matches to level up, and you get 300 shards at level 50 or higher, not too bad imo.
---
Ah. A fellow intellectual.
---
For sure, got a ways to go before I can make myself a nice, personalized built but I always knew DBD had some grind to it.
---
What's exceptional on Micheal, perk-wise?
---
I vote a perk where bbq and chili doesn't work and killers need a new perk called fine dining to get him :P
---
It gets better every time I watch it omg I‚Äôm cryinggggg
---
Please release my boy, he‚Äôs been held hostage for far too long.
---
THIS IS SHIT
---
Big pog
---
Of course they can't. They never planned to. Whatever you seem to believe, they're not the victims here, though they seem to have convinced you that they are. This isn't something that popped up out of the blue. This isn't something that no one predicted. They knew this was coming since before production even began.
---
Probably will do different color variations of the gorgon because in game he's complete a white color while in trailer he was light pink and there's another demogorgon which is a dark grey also they could just do different things on him like wall fragments or even some flesh on the gorgon or my favorite him wearing a tiny bowler hat
---
Anyone got any experience with Distortion? Been eyeing Jeff's perk for awhile and I think Distortion could be a solid perk but BBQ's reading doesn't seem to screw me over enough to use a perk for it. 
---
I know it can proc with other perks like Nurse's, but I'm not sure if it's worth the slot.
---
This + a Prom Night (1980) DLC. With Wendy because she deserved better.
---
If you‚Äôve never played before it is possible to not even understand the description.
---
Tenacity Tier 4
---
For the longest time in all of these pictures I thought Steve was Quentin
---
This
---
I agree that a lot of that sounds extreme...
---
 My only extreme mori fantasy is for trapper's to get reworked to where he shoves a survivors head into a trap.
---
Voice chat is what I‚Äôm implying. Texting over console would be awful
---
When there's only one claudette not prestiged against myres and he need dat stalk juice
---
I would want Nancy's purple dress.
---
Yes I am, it' a lot harder than it seems, it takes quite a bit of time compared to a keyboard.
---
Corrupt is better overall IMO. Prevents the BNP from being used immediately and a gen popping before you even slap someone.
---
I'm so stoked for the bloodweb changes. Will make playing survivor not feel like you're completely dragging behind on points and BBQ gets more mileage now.
---
Finally some good fucking ~~food~~ perks!.
---
Even wake up has some decent uses, This is easily the best shrine in weeks if not months.
---
I feel bad for this killer or any killer whenever this happens. He is probably trying to derank and you guys are just wasting everyone's time instead of opening the exit gates and leaving. Granted he could just open an exit gate to force EGC but my guess is he went away hoping to come back to finished match. 
---
Because of shit like this whenever I want to derank, I resource to facecamping one survivor at a time with bubba right from the start of the match. This is the only way to force survivors to rush through gens and getting an exit gate open while also securing a depip.
---
Voice chat would be a whole lot better i agree, as long as there is a mute option
---
Im assuming you're on PC, because from what I've heard Ps4 players are usually nice, and from experience on Xbox I can tell you that 90% of the community on there is nice, with a few bad apples.
---
Corrupt allows you to prepare better. If you can start infecting survivors during the first two minutes, it will set you up for the rest of the match.
---
It's tough at first but after a while you'll be salty in no time
---
Good point, didn‚Äôt consider BNP. Definitely something to think about.
---
Clown music is best music. It reminds me of Wario's theme from Mario Dtrikers Charge on the Wii.
---
You can also get David and huntress for free
---
Are the DLC worth it? Abd if so, what would be the the best for new players? BTW i do intend on getting the stranger things dlc when that comes out
---
r/expanddong would like a word with you
---
A BNP isn't common but a toolbox is, but a BNP is just an exaggerated version of that problem.
---
Henderson
---
I guess I see why you prefer spine chill, but I tend to use my premo to also kind of "radar" around for the killer. Especially at the beginning, spinning in a 360 gives me an indicator of what direction if it goes off, or safety otherwise. Personal preference I suppose.
---
I smell healing
---
Sometimes I run AFK Myers and they think it's all fun and games until the keyboard melody pops.
---
New licensed killer: the licker from resident evil
---
Yeah, I always find myself rushing to infect objects and survivors, that‚Äôll help a lot.
---
yeeep... literally days after I sucked it up and bought/poured all my bloodpoints into leatherface. FFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
---
Im going to go against the grain here and say no. I don‚Äôt like him at all. I basically paid $5 for BBQ and chili, which is currently available for free from the shrine.
---
It was a really smart decision on bhvr‚Äôs side because they knew that so many people would be interested in a game that didn‚Äôt revolve around stranger things, but still had elements in it
---
Whaaaat, we already got a trapper theme.
---
"Here comes the trapper,"
---
"Better watch out for his traps"
---
*Happy *trap *noises
---
Lets see
---
*For each Injured, Dying or hooked Survivor, all Survivors receive an action speed penalty of 3/3.5/4 % to a maximum of 12/14/16 %.*
---
plus the bars turn red
---
Seems pretty straight forward to me. Unless you are stupid and can barely read, then I'd understand this justification.
---
It's been posted about a lot already but thank you anyway
---
True, Corrupt is a good counter to the genrush overall with toolboxes.
---
I feel like a lot of survivor mains (including me) are getting it to level up Nancy/Steve.
---
Ah I get it now, thanks :D
---
Dude, i never thougt of this, but who would be the killer? Maybe scrappy.
---
With how the games go sometimes I feel that. Had the most toxic batch of SWF groups today. :(
---
Definitely a blursed image
---
There‚Äôs not much potential for an interesting power with Negan. At least in my opinion there isn‚Äôt
---
No I am on pc but thanks for the suggestion
---
And it‚Äôs on game pass, so it‚Äôll only cost 1-2 dollars per month to play on Xbox
---
wow, thanks for letting us know! I almost missed all the other 100 threads (and still counting) posted right after the shrine update.
---
Life savior, honestly.
---
thats very true, its a 10/10 game to go in with some friends and screw around
---
It will?
---
this would be an interesting killer idea where a killers power is controlling a companion to help find or maybe even do damage
---
legion dailies are like... the easiest one. They are planning to tweak them a bit sooner or later, but they are nowhere near as bad as you are implying. They are miles better than bubba, and the doctor's power literally doesnt do anything other than earn bloodpoints without addons.
---
Life saver*
---
Or watch him slowly fade away before your eyes as Nurse or Michael.
---
That and playing any trap character is going to be much easier as combined with ruin you'll have a guarenteed 20-30 seconds before any gen really gets anywhere, so you'll have plenty of time to setup anti-loops or as a chaser you'll be able to find someone quickly.
---
*dum*
---
*dumdum*
---
*Evil Within 3 music plays*
---
Dude I am new and haven‚Äôt played killer yet so I haven‚Äôt read the description
---
That meg knows it ahaha.
---
Imagine thinking Decisive is toxic
---
Not to be nit picky but there‚Äôs also l√©ry‚Äôs and jungle gym walls plus the iron works, Thompson house, Haddonfield, Badham and plenty of other tiles with walls and possible ceilings
---
Im so proud of this community
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt even think of how good it would be on Trapper or Hag. Will definitely be excited to get the teachable. Thanks for the advice!
---
I'm sorry someone treated you that way. The community can be very toxic. I wish we were more focused on teaching others rather than berating as there is a lot to learn.
---
If you'd like a toxicity-free way to learn about the game, the [Wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki) is insanely detailed and will have information for almost everything in the game.
---
See you in the fog!
---
&gt;Life saver*
---
Fixed it. Non English speaker so I am bound to some mistakes. I appreciate the reply tho, truly.
---
Holy shit, that's pretty complex lol.
---
I can't believe I was forced to play Bubba for weeks so I could get BBQ and now they do this after 2 weeks of bad perks... I'M GONNA CRY.
---
I‚Äôll be sure to stop
---
You mean ever on on a post asking for help
---
Also for that one dude who always bags on pallet
---
Really?!?!
---
I havent gotten to check yet, what a stroke of lucky cement
---
Hey, im newer to the dbd scene so what doest it acctually mean lol
---
It's not the money, I don't want to spend bloodpoints on a killer I'll never use.
---
You feel bad for killers trying to intentionally derank so they can get easy games... suffering from one game of Surviviors Taunting him? 
---
Hm...
---
I'm just scared because every swinging dick is gonna be running around with it
---
Haunted grounds or ruin?
---
Getting the 2 sacrifices one at rank 7 wasn‚Äôt fun at all but sure. I‚Äôd argue tooth and nail Legion is miles worse than both doctor and Leatherface with addons. And doctors power at tier 3 does do something they can‚Äôt use items, heal themselves, or do diddly squat before snapping out of it. And his power at least helps in chase. LF can at least scare people with his insta down capabilities instead of laughing at it
---
I don't think he even knew what to do...
---
Of course! My suggestion for them would be ruin and corrupt with either bambizzle or brutal, maybe both but with the 'gorgon coming soon BBQ is going to be on every build from here on out for me
---
Np
---
You don't have to play killer to read descriptions. You can do it on the scoreboard screen after every match and you can also enter Kill Your Friends lobby where all perks are available and go through their description. 
---
When I started playing instead of creating dumb threads like this, I would simply go to a KYF lobby and read the perks or even DBD gamepedia.
---
Spent ages getting bubba to level 35 for BBQ only for it to appear on the shrine, just my luck
---
Been there man. But at least we got Franklin's out of it.
---
How was that even mean?......
---
*kids and children are synonyms*
---
I just fired up PS4 and my God, the load times are atrocious getting into a lobby. It‚Äôs been so long since I played I‚Äôm rank 20 and have shit from events over a year ago. 
---
it‚Äôs nothing but baby killers ... I haven‚Äôt played against a camper yet, knock on wood ... but these poor rank 20‚Äôs ... lol
---
Would the combination of these perks be OP?  Meh?  Or somewhere inbetween?
---
I'm enjoying not waiting 30 minutes to play as killer though lol
---
Not entirely sure since I'm not a Michael player, just figured it was a good general tip. I think enduring because he can be looped easily, spirit fury may also help with that. As for the rest you might want to ask someone more experienced or maybe experiment for yourself.
---
i hold nothing against them but the whole " it'll kill DbD " and now we have every Horror icon in a game with active players and trending DLCs ( even with characters from thier favorite show if they've seen it )
---
I mean, you gotta fight toxicity with toxicity
---
bhvr is the company that made dbd
---
guilty as charged
---
Getting easy games isn't the only reason why people derank, a lot of people do it mostly because of queue times. 
---
But like I said, survivors are only harming themselves because the alternative to AFK deranking, is using facecamping to derank but then everyone complains.
---
I wish I could say, I bought Laury and Jeff but haven't been able to play all summer. You'll have to test it out form me.
---
What is dee bee dee?
---
Mate survivors are OP 
---
I've spent 1000s or hours on this game
---
The amount of pallets / looping / infinites 
---
And playing killer trying to hit someone with 10fps 
---
Is pretty tedious , especially when a survivor will just 360.
---
It's the company that works on the game.
---
Honestly man, if this is to much for you then the game might not be for you. The community is salty and you'll get a lot of hate mail so my advice to you is ignore the bad ones and listen to the people trying to help.
---
Dear god why
---
Ty
---
Ah ok, as in behavior
---
And you're the reason nobody takes people who use the word "toxic" seriously.
---
Right, I should start to save for him but I‚Äôm trying to get all the best teachables unlocked. BBQ away!
---
I'm thinking about playing killer more should I get corrupt intervention
---
Cleanse it man, she has NOED
---
They‚Äôre actually extremely consistent on release times for things like this. I‚Äôd bet money the dlc comes out September 10th.
---
I didnt I was gonna wait and see for the shrine because it was 8 hours, imma get bbq baby
---
They could give him an alt color like Dart from the show, he was an adolescent Demogorgon that was kind of green with a yellow mark along his back I think
---
So either be a smurfing asshole for more games or be a smurfing asshole for ez games. Either way the result is the same.
---
Apologizing for our toxic community and giving him advice to use the wiki isn't mean or toxic at all.
---
Could you imagine how fucking awesome that would be if demo could trap survivors down there by closing the portals and you'd have to complete an objective or find something in the upside down to get out.
---
I didn‚Äôt know there was a wiki and if you read my comment you should know that I‚Äôm new and I didn‚Äôt know kill your friends lobby had a feature where you can see my perks because I‚Äôll make this bold for you IM NEW
---
I also buy skins sometimes too  but you must admit that you already pay for the game then there's a boat load of dlc and finally they charge a lot for a single cosmetic, all while the game is super buggy and the community just encourages them by saying.. heyyy charge alot of money for this please
---
more like obsessed over views. i took a look to see what that video was about and the woman literally said i got a range rover. wtf
---
Doc and nurse main awayyyyyyy
---
Yeah I don't wanna hear killers bitch about queue times taking forever and then doing shit like this XD.
---
I just said people don't derank to smurf but I guess you are too stupid to read
---
Guess the result is also the same no matter my reply.
---
I think a large majority of the fan base, including myself, has heard and loved Legion‚Äôs theme.
---
I never said people telling me to use the wiki was mean
---
Indeed.
---
You are insane if you genuinely believe Legion is that bad. But y'all can believe whatever you want. Legion isnt on the priority list for changes, aside from addon changes, and possibly some very minor tweaks.
---
Truth
---
Honestly a fnaf killer would be cool just for the cosmetics alone.
---
There‚Äôs nothing eerier than seeing Michael stalk you from a healthy distant. You just know shit‚Äôs about to go down. 
---
Also, Michael‚Äôs bffs are cocky survivors.
---
·¥âs  á…•·¥âsÀôÀôÀôÀô loss¬ø
---
Ghostface can kill you a lot faster though.
---
We wouldn't be getting this dlc in the first place without cosmetic shop. I know it's really annoying to spend money on them but the work and money put on dead by daylight has increased thanks to it.
---
valentine's day?
---
It'll probably be the menu music for demogorgon
---
I mean, you did comment on my post
---
One of us
---
Michael would be BFF with a Dwight.
---
I'm sorry Dweet...
---
Oh well it was a joke. You are missing the actual take away from this
---
I've downed people who haven't even been hooked and still DC. Usually people do it so you don't get a stack with bbq. At least that's what I've heard
---
I'll give you one.  The man gets to begin chases with an almost free hit to injured state.  There isn't another killer in this game that gets to start a chase with a free hit.  Also you should combine Sloppy with Thanatophobia on Legion.  That combo is phenomenal on him.
---
 A film publishing company.
---
Is this console or pc?
---
PS4
---
Alright
---
Such a dumb reason.   
---
  
---
"Oh you won this chase well fuck you I win because I didn't die and fuck my team for not miraculously getting all 5 gens done in the 3 seconds you chased me ez pz"
---
I play killer just for rituals and sometimes to meme and have fun- never to kill. That said, I chased a teabagging feng out the gates tonight and they messaged me after with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fast as fck boiii.‚Äù I‚Äôm rank 17.. I just said gg and hoped that would be enough to make them think. But I know those are high hopes *sigh*
---
I believe you mean...Left behind?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
It's  a bitch to redownload the game for the PTB then you have to wait an ungodly amount of time to actually get in a match, and then the survivors/killer fuck around the whole game and you didn't get to see anything cool all game. You're not missing out on much.
---
I played killer yesterday, and someone sent me about 50 messages with obscenities and derogatory language, then went through my xbox screencaps, and reported one that had questionable language in it attempting to get me banned. Some people take the game too seriously.
---
Pure game sales would not be enough to keep this game alive.
---
2020, they haven‚Äôt given a date yet. It‚Äôs made by the guys who did Friday the 13th.

It's a decent replacement for ruin if you don't have it

Yinz didn‚Äôt even realize he hit it with no HUT
---
I've run into this bug so like 30 time in 100 hours on xbox meanwhile I have over 1000 hours on pc and I think I've seen this bug once. I think it's safe to say the console port is baaaaad

Welcome to the Salty Spitoon. How tough are ya?

I don't need to get teabagged by Shaggy.

I really love the idea of the survivors getting Scooby Doo themed cosmetics.
---
The fuck is that
---
I say blessed.
---
Lol.  Famous last words tunnel the Obsession.
---
Oooohhhh shiiiiit!
---
Lol i thought was a ruin. And even today we take the perk tomorrow
---
Please join, turn messages to friends only on your system, enjoy
---
Maybe we can play some time! It's exciting to see Stranger Things (something I never really tried to watch) bring in new fans to DBD (something I've loved for a while now).   
---
Glad to have you :)
---
We welcome you! Just fair warning this community can be very toxic. Other than that I hope you have a great stay here at the dead by daylight hotel.
---
I feel like the Demagorgon (sorry if I misspelled) will be able to drag people into the upside down (kinda like freddy) and it'll gain a buff while there. The survivors can then find the entry to the upside down and grab the trapped survivor bringing them back to the real world.
---
Really? How do you test it?
---
i have 5500 hours and didnt know that
---
Definitely, it gets boring with the original characters and if you have the extra cash laying around you might as well pay for the new characters and to get all the good perks.
---
Indeed, but what I really want is shirtless Myers tbh
---
ü§£ü§£ The broken things gonna be the killer
---
fuck off bro it was barely two guys out of like 10
---
Excuse me while I grind
---
I mean ash's perks were leaked months before he came out
---
Yes
---
Uninstall now
---
School is importnat.
---
Someone just got wrecked by a billy
---
Yeah that was an unintentional leak. Not a tease.
---
The game decided to throw him a bone. He clearly needed it.
---
If I wanted to be a dick, I would‚Äôve called your theory ‚Äòfucking stupid and the work of a braindead chimp‚Äô instead of just ‚Äòridiculous‚Äô.
---
I'll look at steam and stuff and get back. Moneys not really a problem, its *parents* (you might say I'm way too young for reddit :P)
---
I haven‚Äôt watched a lot (3 episodes) so I doubt I can spoil too much. The demogorgan is a monster that the kids fight in DnD, and so when they meet a monster in real life, they call it that? That‚Äôs my non-spoiler random guess.
---
Same here. It‚Äôs okay. Season 2 so far
---
Hillbilly is one of the most balanced killers in the game right now, the only thing making him good is his map mobility, the chainsaw is really only good for that and Hillbillies chainsaw is so easy to counter that it really isn't a big deal because all you gotta do is stick close to walls and not run the loop  insanely bad.
---
Oh haha, I had to do a little bit of convincing when I first got steam as well
---
I want my senpaii to be real
---
you're right too scary that's nightmare fuel plus we already have mike myers :P
---
Ggez
---
Oh yeah I get it, I had to do a fair amount of convincing when I first got steam
---
whats the best thing to get here? bbq? i started playing like 4-5 days ago
---
I deserved that downvote.
---
Good to hear
---
Frank still hasn't gotten over the needs just yet, he needs to work through it at his own pace
---
who's to say there can't be an unintentional leak?
---
For years i thought i was the only one who played it, had hours of fun despite the story
---
"forced"
---
I don‚Äôt think a single person who‚Äôs interested in the game hasn‚Äôt seen the trailer. Not only is it pinned, but every damn post is about it. Not only this, but it temporarily reached #1 on Trending. It‚Äôs already become their most viewed trailer.
---
Billy would like to know your location.
---
PS4? Ormound?
---
I fucking hate and love you.
---
I'll wait until Thursday acually. If you were me you'd know why. I'll get back k to this post when I have a solid answer
---
We wouldn‚Äôt be able to actually have Scooby-Doo sadly since they wanna keep the humanoid aspect
---
Logic?
---
It was able to traverse the whole ship faster than the crew could using just the vents, outside the limits of practical movie effects it wasn't a slow killer.  
---
Unless every map is going to hilariously start having large conveniently placed air vents everywhere I can't see how a Xenomorph, an alien so far away from Earth it makes a trip from Los Angeles to Pluto look like a park stroll somehow gets pulled by the Entity.
---
Don't get me wrong, as much as I'd enjoy hearing anyone stumble to rationalize it's inclusion in the game I'd much rather see the devs make their own alien instead of a knock off Xenomorph.
---
It happens, must have not been thinking straight after hitting a skill check without the wheel but you know sorry
---
Why would they nerf the most balanced killer? :(
---
i dealt with it a lot and i've since switched my bind over to mouse wheel down and it helps a whole lot more
---
Yeah, on Ormound?
---
Dark Mist*
---
I play on Xbox too, and I can say hatches are literally messed up for both sides. I've been hit by hatchets when I'm behind rocks, and I've had hatchets go through my head, torso, legs etc, and as Huntress I've hit people through stuff/missed direct hits. Hatchets are broken.
---
You were saying?
---
**I NEED THIS AAAAAAAAAA** üíôüíóüíòüíñüíïüíô
---
What did I do to you and literally 9 of them were toxic
---
Just know that the moment you get your first 4K and/or disconnect you will feel very accomplished.
---
No that's incredibly inaccurate.  Against decent survivors none of the killers you named get to begin chases reliably with a free hit.  Legions the only one.  Wraith you should always see coming from his shimmer walking up to you from 30 feet out.  More than enough notice to position yourself to a loop or window.  Spirit would have to predict out of nowhere.  You'll hear her coming without prayer beads and can easily walk to hide scratches making her a total guessing game to begin a chase healthy.  Pig again same answer as Wraith only worse because she isn't remotely hard to see.  Easy to see her crawl up on you and run away long before she should have crawled anywhere near you.  Only a gen blocked by walls screws this up.  Honestly I'm going to stop explaining them each individually too much work.  Only bad survivors consistently feed any of the killers you mentioned with free hits to start chases.  A basic practice of rotating your camera on gens for awareness allows for the easiest counterplay to each of the killers you named.  All legion has to do is wait until he's on your ass then pop ability.  It's free af as long as you aren't a swing happy potato.  Got to aim and be sure it doesn't miss but otherwise easy injured status to begin almost all of his chases.
---
BBQ on shrine twice in one year after never appearing more than once before? What kind of fuckery is going on?
---
Yesss welcome I'm so ready to main "The Hair"
---
I'm assuming your here cause of stranger things? In that case welcome! I hope you can get your situation figured out and in the case that you get dbd please don't take anyone seriously. People say some nasty things in the endgame chat, don't listen to them and have fun. Good luck :)
---
Billy is very balanced. Some maps can even leave him on the weak side of balance. He doesn't need nerf. 
---
**IF** anything, his charge add-ons could use more nerfing or removal but its a big IF.
---
Hehe I loved that Dead Meat video.
---
Just know that they‚Äôre called baby Dwight‚Äôs
---
and the hottest soo win win win.
---
I've been playing Dead By Daylight since before Leatherface came out and even I don't know what an BHVR is, I can only imagine how confused these new Netflix Normies are with all these gotdamn acronyms
---
Hex: Cool OP. 
---
:)
---
Distortion sucks hardcore ass? What do you think this is? Crazy town?
---
*Fails Skill Check*
---
**NIGERUNDAYO CLAUDETTE**
---
get the fuck outta my house
---
I rebound it to "scroll mouse down" which I've found far easier than mashing the space bar. It's slightly annoying that you can only set it to scrolling up or down, not both, but I'd recommend it.
---
Come thru Dead Meaters.
---
You nuked my meme how dare you
---
BHRV
---
Nah, I liked it before stranger things. Just joined the subreddit today :P just a fan of DBD trying to get the game. (Off topic question, what's your favorite killer?) =w=
---
Real question is why hasn‚Äôt the spirit been nerfed yet? Billy is a balanced dude
---
His chainsaw regularly hits me through objects it‚Äôs quite frustrating
---
did you reinstall
---
I was literally stuck like that. Second game using the plague and I was doing really good. Hit the obsession, snuck up on someone doing a gen, got stuck grabbing them. They literally all escaped because I was stuck.
---
The only reason ghostface has cosmetics is because they got mask license instead of a character license
---
I nevver knew I wanted all of Steve's outfits and I've played like an hour of survivor but dammit if these are in the game. Jumping ship ensues.
---
I think there ok with it, cuz they let me watch whoever I want :P and thanks I guess (tbh like everyone would say I'm too young for reddit  but I DONT CARE) not saying my acual age bc of reasons that I think are obvious
---
Thats why he should fall over when he gets stunned or hits a wall
---
It only has addons offerings and items and all the addons go to the perspectives sides pool of items etc. with the two markets it‚Äôs less of a grind for the items but to get perks you just have to level up your character, and you do that by gaining xp via emblems in a match.
---
I think he should be nerfed but probably not the reason you want him to be.
---
His skill floor is too low and a lot of people end up only learning to play Hillbilly with Ruin, BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury.
---
It gets old real fast, less because of how strong it is but because everyone is doing it. Now it's like- "Oh, this again?".
---
Though I think the solution would be to nerf that build before nerfing the killer.
---
...okay?
---
You must have done something to push the entity off :(
---
Hm. Reminds me of My Bloody Valentine.
---
Well Freddy's teleport seems different because he's a dream demon allowing him to go any where while the demogorgon seems to have his teleporting holes scattered plus they're big meaning it probably takes time to place them not being able to even move maybe.
---
tf is a BHVR xd
---
I agree, finally we can get Wake Up on the shrine.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
When I say whoever btw, I mean people like SMii7y and stuff like that
---
Definitely listen to those guys! Trust me, the surv who runs object is the definitely the one to spend those 5 gens chasing! 100%
---
It isnt deleting
---
Therefore it is much harder to get permission for characters such as leather face and Myers  because they own a character license instead of a mask license
---
No my point is that the demigoron is forgettable because of how much better the human characters are and how the show wasn‚Äôt focused on the demigoron and the interactions between the humans and the monster but focused on the kids and the development they went through.  I clearly stated that the Demigoron was forgettable due to the characters and what the show focused on (not the demigorons)
---
Is it true that killers can activate the exit gate?
---
Killer is steve too.
---
Yes bbq is one of the best killer perks
---
Something about the writers suing about a bunch of jason related stuff, they can't release any new DLC atm, i didn't read into it too much, just heard about it and googled it
---
Though i can be entirely off on what its actually running your console is just a computer that runs a very specific OS granted you cant upgrade many of the parts though like with pc so console versions of the game will limit things like graphics and framerate to make up for it so as it to ensure a solid gaming experience but some games come without the limitation i know seige has no such limiter and relies on vsync and dummed dowm graphicdss to run a smooth 55 on my console
---
It‚Äôs speculation lol imagine thinking it‚Äôs not ok to speculate about how good or bad a killer is
---
Is it bad that I hate the new season for R6 as well as Chapter 13?
---
We need to see some gameplay before we put him on in a tier list.
---
Try repairing the installation through Steam. First verify the integrity of the files.
---
Two of my friends each have over 3,000 hours just on Rust... JUST ON RUST
---
I would love that outfit Nancy had when she was being chased around in the hospital!
---
And what I was saying was that the clear success in sales of Ghostface‚Äôs outfits (amongst other stuff, like Pig/Tapp‚Äôs outfits) may convince the devs to push further for, say, Myers cosmetics. I‚Äôm aware of how much easier it was to get the rights to the Ghostface costume than Michael Myers himself, but I‚Äôm more thinking of it in success terms.
---
Myers is actually so scary sometimes
---
That damn hair is worthy of Farrah Fawcett
---
Could slap that Franklin's on a hag and trap it.
---
THIS IS A MUST - THIS IS A MUST
---
Knowing BVHR, he's going to be a complete fucking joke at the start.
---
PLEASE BHVR Make this happen - It makes complete sense in this game
---
I‚Äôm just saying if all he can do is teleport to pre-determined spots he might not be that good.. and of course we need to see gameplay all I‚Äôm judging on his what we have seen but that‚Äôs still ok it‚Äôs just speculation
---
Dude this is awesome
---
Would second chance unblock the window as well?
---
I would say the legion is. Its all the chasing around but instead of a instadown, you get a notification letting you know that the people you know are near you, are near you. Its just not as helpful as ending a chase or possible hitting multiple survivors if they are dumb enough.
---
Only against Bamboozle

[BBQ IS FINALLY IN THE SHRINE!!](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/rl0FOxdz7CcxO/giphy.gif)
---
I don't need it because i got it years ago but
---
Really hope that they take from horror games as well eventually, and do Silent Hill or Resident Evil
---
No, I don‚Äôt think I will.
---
This is precisely what I hoped will happen with the  new dlc. Welcome ST fans!!! I think DBD could use some fresh faces. And I hope ST fans will welcome me now that I must watch it!
---
They‚Äôre not but when they are it‚Äôs pretty terrible. I had four or five really garbage games in a row today with decked out toxic SWF teams. It‚Äôs not fun.
---
me, an intellectual: ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt gonna put bbq in the shrine, i should just buy leatherface‚Äù *buys him 1 week ago* 
---
devs: i‚Äôm boutta end this mans whole career
---
I usually agree with them even if they're flat out wrong. Confuses people.
---
lol I just told you you were overreacting, and you were, how does that, in any matter, make me unable to offer help and invite you to play together? stop the tantrum dude.
---
Noob survivor PSA. When you see someone coming to unhook you stop trying to unhook yourself ffs.
---
Well can I say the demogorgon even though we haven't seen it in game yet? Considering it will also have prestige clothing making it bloody it seems it will be terrifying getting chased by it. For ones we already have it would probably be Micheal considering his jumpscare potential
---
Should I run STBFL and Dying Light together or not? I have been lately and was wondering.
---
Even after 50 hours of playing I still get frustrated every so often! But once and a while you‚Äôll have a team that‚Äôs peanut butter n jelly
---
Yes but I still think that Myers cosmetics are unlikely just because they‚Äôre isn‚Äôt much you can do without completely changing him
---
I feel like the hag would be the most terrifying to randomly stumble upon in the woods.
---
Everything's fine over here. Something wrong? he's clearly just a god
---
Lol getting downvoted because I hate this show but love watching my favorite game grow
---
Demogorgon is probably the freakiest.
---
THIS FISH IS FUCKING RAW
---
It's not usual. There's the occasional GG ez and such after someone gets the Hatch, but I usually don't get angry messages in the chat.
---
Me when there's BBQ and I already got LF: UwU
---
There's Corrupt Intervention:
---
#0w0
---
Being a smartass
---
That's why I said seems, it's a educated guess as we have no info about the teleportation and how good it will be. I'm just speculating honestly  but if he does has the ability to place his holes anywhere it just seems it would take awhile and be stationary because of how big the portal is.
---
You can't parry a trap, but you can dodge it using Dead Hard
---
Marry her immediately
---
For me it's more Borderlands 3 and stranger things. Haven't been this hyped in YEARS
---
That's what I was thinking! There are SO many ways get could just end up being a weak OG Freddy. I'm hoping it incorporates tracking wounded survivor's because of its attraction to blood
---
If you have Xbox get gamepass.
---
Michael Myers. The pale, empty, expressionless mask really seals it for me.
---
Can‚Äôt you take a joke god damn
---
If they get/when they get servers that will change. I heard they will have them before the end of the year. Can‚Äôt remember a source but I‚Äôm pretty sure it was in the Ama they did not too long ago
---
Why not show that then
---
It‚Äôs because you‚Äôve surrounded yourself in a small hive mind echo chamber.  You play with a small group who probably only plays survivor and your play styles don‚Äôt mesh well against Billy.  You have limited information except those who are like minded. It‚Äôs not all too surprising.
---
It better be $5? Or else what? Lol
---
It's cheap enough. I pay more money for a single meal.
---
As an aside, ya'll should get Distortion too. It's such a hidden gem I wish I could actually find it on other survivors.
---
Don‚Äôt be! Enjoy the killer for their playstyle and design! And try picking up the original media from its origin if it intrigues you at all! 
---
-Stranger things fan (me)
---
I really like the changes that were made to Freddy I think black and red is more menacing than red and green, also new Freddy has a thin sweatshirt witch makes him look lankier/more melted. I like new Freddy‚Äôs claw better with the addition of the shackle cuff around the wrist and copper back strips and welded claws. I like the more raw leather hat and the melted face, specifically I like new Freddy‚Äôs nose and how it‚Äôs almost melted flat against his face,
---
I mean messy is the aesthetic of their music. Look at their add ons
---
*Cues incredibles Theme*
---
You did awesome, if it wasn‚Äôt for the instant down she would have had a hard time getting you
---
Jokes on you, I already have BBQ unlocked... on my leatherface
---
This was taken from [r/jojotemplates](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I think
---
Bob and Barbara, if we are going by the lore of ST, but Steve and Nancy makes sense as the game has always included the top billed cast. Hopper is a supporting character.
---
You don‚Äôt go against mint rag often or any of Lisa‚Äôs purples often do you? Well good Hag players anyway 
---
You forgot the shitpost flair
---
You didn't need it anyways
---
I don‚Äôt have Ruin yet, is Corrupt Intervention a viable gen protect/slow perk until I can get Ruin? Seems solid to buy you map pressure and dominance for two minutes. Assuming if you can get a hook or two in that time it‚Äôs done its job.
---
Is that the sound of Alex‚Äôs toolbox in the distance
---
Are you serious? I just leveled up my bubba to get bbq and it shows up in the shrine 2 days later. Nice
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
I honestly thought the Pig was an original character meant to embody Jigsaw's ideals in the form of a DbD killer. I had no idea Amanda Young was already a canon character in the Saw franchise
---
I am Quentin
---
Dude did I actually get hated this bad for my comment? Stranger things fandom is toxic...
---
Besides your horrible grammar, when did I say I wanted chucky?!?!?
---
I main Michael, and I never play ghost face, if I‚Äôm gonna play as a stalky boy, it‚Äôs gonna by Michael. Ghost face isn‚Äôt eerie
---
da fuck is a LOL?
---
Fuck that little shit
---
Ok.. And I don't get why your even complaining in the first place anymore
---
Correct!
---
if you're really serious about playing steve nancy and the demogorgon as soon as possible there's gonna be a public test beta (PTB) before they release where you can play as them for free
---
Agreed. Sometimes i write full on novels if im a drunk survivor; about how the killer could hsve killed the other three survivors and gotten more points if i hadnt been face camped. Haha at that point though, with after-game voice chat, i could just be muted if they didnt want my 'killer improvement ted talk' lmao
---
Nothing to do with show's fandom, its DBD community itself, I get downvoted too for breaking the party line.
---
fuel cans should be scattered around the map, you have to go refill when your fuel runs out
---
I don‚Äôt know why you want Myers to have more to wear I want him to wear less.
---
Voice chat would be the game-changer though. We dont need text on console. We need comms.
---
Watching DBD on YT while waiting
---
I just really like Hopper as a character
---
So it‚Äôs just an automatic no because *you* don‚Äôt have a problem with it?
---
imagine calling someone a "two-faced brat" while encroaching other people's conversation to talk shit to me for no reason other than trying to be nice to the new guy
---
_and watching fucking hentai lol._

New Killer: [THE UNDERRRRRRMINERRRRRRRRR](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/71/TheUnderminer.png/revision/latest?cb=20190516130347)
---
I wish people would drop this mindset of ALWAYS countering BBQ. Have you never thought that having your aura revealed is a good thing? If you are far away and the killer immediately starts moving towards you (even a Billy or Nurse), it will create a completely safe opportunity for an unhook. This is what BBQ was originally intended for, reduce camping by giving the killer his next prey. 
---
If the killer hooks someone and sees ZERO aura revealed, he will assume everyone is close by and spend more time around the hook or when he leaves, he will immediately come back after the unhook because he had nowhere else to go. 
---
PRO TIP: Don't ALWAYS counter BBQ. It makes me really sad that devs went out of their way to add these counter (lockers and Distortion perk).
---
I say this as both Survivor and Killer. 
---
As a survivor I don't mind being seen by the killer because there is a huge distance between being found and being downed. Being chased is the actual fun in DBD, unless you love holding M1 and dying. 
---
As a killer whenever I hook someone and see at least 1 aura, I immediately leave the hook even though I know the other 2 could be around for an instant save. I really don't care because I actually know where one person is while the other two I would have to guess.
---
NOED doing its job like a champ.  This Huntress may have no idea how to pressure a gen or end a chase but hey at least they still get kills.  Elite Huntress plays.
---
I bet they are portals so that there Demogorgon can quickly navigate the map, Steve and Nancy are trying to close one.
---
Because they are better killers to go with
---
So toxicity is mostly in the chat but tunneling and camping is toxic because it ruins another's playtime for no legit reason other than to be an asshole (talking about completely intentional tunneling). The killer can literally take away at least one survivor's ability to play that round.
---
Crouch spamming may not seem toxic but encounter about 100 times in one game because you dare play a low rank killer for a daily or try out a new killer and every survivor think they're hot shit for running you around.
---
The chat clarifies that these behaviors are toxic, so in the future, even without chat most players call it toxic.
---
And i just bought leatherface yesterday rip me
---
Custom mapmaking for KYF or more weather affects on maps
---
I am pre-rework freddy
---
I'm so glad you're here, *cheers.*
---
Whatever. Your one of those people that will complain at anything. This happens every time
---
Clown and Plague are poison types. Spirit, Nurse and Wraith are Ghost types. Doctor is Electric type. Cannibal, Trapped, Ghostface, Legion, Hillbilly and Huntress are Normal types. Freddy is a Psychic type and finally Myers and the Hag are Dark Types.
---
Not everyone has/wants/uses or needs a xim. Even a keyboard. I play on console and use my pc for all my grad school work. I dont wanna buy one or a xim to play a game. The in game keyboard works fine for me if thats what you mean, i type fast with my controller but most people i play with have no interest in investing in something like a keyboard they only use for chat.
---
lol
---
Whaaat leatherface is adorable
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just dumb but why is it gold?
---
Jane: looks at her nails
---
Dwight: eats them
---
Well they asked if I had a problem with it so yeah its a no.
---
Mmm.... sweaty old man makup or an horrible sickness that smells like dead rats....
---
Yep, i prefier plague
---
I feel like he would work as a mori and trap mechanic since he's a bit small to reach a hook unless they decided to make the hooks smaller and than suddenly shoot up to thier actual heights once he hooks them by the stumps
---
Camping a generator? That's a new one. But it's not too far off for bring called tryhard for kicking the generators at every opportunity.
---
When did they say that?
---
The mismatches are typically because of SWF. The should be a rank disparity limit so red ranks can't queue with green or yellow ranks. I think only being able to group within 3 ranks of your own would be ideal.
---
BP is huge tho
---
-I gotta disagree with the colours. Red and green was chosen because those are the two hardest colours for the human eye to focus on, so Freddy is disturbing to look at even subconsciously. Hell, remake Freddy actually does have a red and green sweater- seriously, look up pictures. It‚Äôs a dark green, but it‚Äôs green. For some reason, in DBD, it‚Äôs red and black though. No idea why.
---
-Thin sweatshirt- I can see that I guess. I dunno, never really bothers me.
---
-Ah, the glove. I do really like the remake claw; the tendon-like plates which connect the finger pieces to the rest of it look really good. Not sure if I prefer it over the OG claw, but it‚Äôs an interesting design.
---
-The hat is interchangeable to me.
---
-The Face. Now, his design in the actual remake movie... it ain‚Äôt great. But in DBD, they had to change it so it didn‚Äôt look like Jackie Earle Haley... and they honestly improved it. His DBD face looks like a perfect middle between Englund and Haley, and I like that. 
---
Eh, I can see where you‚Äôre coming from. Since I purely prefer Englund‚Äôs version of Freddy (since that IS Freddy) I‚Äôd be more than happy to have it in-game. But remake Freddy has some very cool parts to his design that I like.
---
How long did this take?
---
The meta has changed now, motherfuckers
---
Bruh I‚Äôm complaining they chose the demigoron over alien pretty fucking obvious im complaining about something  that will likely never happen in the first place
---
I was waiting for this comment. I was not disappointed.
---
I didnt have a hud so i couldn't do generators or much of anything so of course I wasn't taking the game seriously. I just thought it was cool hitting the decisive strike without a skill check but I am so very sorry
---
Same here, I loved his arc in the last two seasons. If it was up to me I would have chosen Hopper and Joyce as survivors.
---
A) coz it would have added diversity to character design.
---
And B) Coz I still have a huuuge crush on Winona Ryder. Being a 90's kid she was and always be my dream girl
---
Well look who gets 150,000 blood points this week?!
---
I legit would love Jason's mother as the killer
---
Well bbq barely goes on the shrine smh
---
Gotta go fast! ...to uninstall this game
---
*Flashbacks to that Kate and Demogorgon art that already exists*
---
Listen I love Steve but at the same time hes nothing we havent seen within the cast
---
That man's IQ is 300
---
Hey I mean I was that way when Michael Myers was released because I love the old slasher flicks. So welcome to the game! Ignore toxic players in after game chat and try playing both survivor and killer to find what you love.
---
From the title? It asked does anyone else have the same issue, i said no so its a no from me.
---
What are you talking about? I like dlc anyways, survivors looks cool, flower head looks nice, i dont know shit about stranger things, but the thing is this thing isnt scary at all, maybe scary for babies idk
---
Trust me, you don't want it. Generally toxic 95% of the time.
---
ok dude I am sorry ok? you WERE overreacting. one of the guys actually helped you and your whole attention goes to the one or two that were making a joke. this is the internet, people meme and make fun all over the place. if you don't have the sense of humor or isn't in the mood for it, just ignore it.
---
BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL!
---
They said ‚Äúdoes anyone else feel it‚Äôs stupid‚Äù
---
Yes, you should definitely pick that up. I would recommend getting it even if you main survivor since you never know if you want to swap to killer. Also if you want to farm for more bloodpoints then it's one of the best for it. Not to mention just a top tier killer perk and staple in most builds and it's pretty much one of the rarest perks in the shrine; This is only the third time it's been in there.
---
Dynamic weather.
---
There are six perks between the two of them there has to at the very least be one good perk lol
---
Now if only it would show up in my bloodweb
---
I mean people in general
---
Oh fuxk
---
You are allowed to scream when you first start playing. Give it a couple more rounds and it'll be screams of "omg not you again!"
---
Tommy Jarvis?
---
Yeah and I said nope because I've had no issues so I dont think its stupid. He didnt say everyone he said anyone and me being anyone said no I've had no issue. What are you 13?
---
Tunnel bandit
---
I mean no monsters in this game are really that scary. Besides maybe the players behind the controller.
---
The shovel decapitation through the mouth in the remake was great, despite the shitty CGI
---
So people are criminals for actually being nice to others instead of being a prick like you? Funny.
---
Oh yea because alien fits with Stanger things right?
---
Dreadful
---
As it would turn out, everyone else was friends with the guy (I was playing killer against a 4 man swf) so I'm now reporting all the accounts on the basis of them more than likely knowing of what happened (at least 2 of the 3 were also harassing me).
---
I kinda hope they will release a Michael skin whenever the 2018 sequel gets released
---
lol and i am probably the only person in the world that after a fun match proceeds to dm people "gg"
---
Remember to never bully the killer, you might make him stop playing the game because you‚Äôll make him think that the whole player base is toxic. And at the beginning they will camp and tunnel because they don‚Äôt know how to play properly yet. I used to be one of them but I soon leaned that soft-patrolling and tunneling isn‚Äôt fun for the survivors or me. I hope you have fun with this game!
---
Fucking hell stranger things over Alien
---
This is deadass creepy wtf
---
Learn to loop and you can turn him into an M1 killer.  He is fine where he is survivors just need to be way better than they are at chases as they rank up.  This has I ranked up running urban, selfcare and premonition all over it.
---
I just think it‚Äôs wrong to dismiss something when it‚Äôs given examples on why it‚Äôs bad, simply because you‚Äôve not had the misfortune of going through those examples.
---
If they don't do it. Then give us the outfits.
---
From somebody who‚Äôs played Ghost Face an alarming amount since launch, the hotfix (which was a buff not a nerf the angle needed to be widened and it took away his static noise that alerted survivors) it was definitely necessary and many people wanted it.
---
Currently it's Michael. But I feel like the mascot Clown will far surpass him in the nightmare factor.
---
It‚Äôs on the shrine for this week is why he said that ;)
---
That‚Äôll be next year- ‚ÄúHalloween Kills‚Äù is the title. And if it doesn‚Äôt happen then, there‚Äôs the year directly after that when we get the ‚Äòfinal‚Äô one (even the writer of it said he knows it won‚Äôt be the last), ‚ÄúHalloween Ends‚Äù.
---
It‚Äôs fucking raw!
---
Wait, is this the ptb or actual game here?
---
Nice meme
---
reread what you just wrote, if you still think it's right I suggest you to get some rest or drink a cuo of water, cause you're _really fucking confused_
---
yeah, it was meta for a minute and then suddenly nothing. how hard did they nerf it?
---
Then he‚Äôs not being toxic, he‚Äôs being a smartass...
---
I think the pallets are so map dependent I am not sure I want to use them unless I can send myself to a map where I can do something with them.
---
Just seems like a lot of dislikes and not very well thought out comments. It‚Äôs obviously not moonlight and it‚Äôs a very likely possibility based on most characters getting one different variation. Although what can I expect... since the announcement of The new chapter; a LOT of this reddit has had a massive hissfit about it. Either because they THINK that BHVR broke their rules about ‚ÄúNo non-human characters‚Äù when in reality that‚Äôs not what they said?? It was ‚ÄúNo Non-humanoid characters‚Äù. Which means for those of you in the back: no characters who aren‚Äôt walking on two legs with two arms as their normal movement, they have to have a human-like body. I swear it‚Äôs like Chinese whispers around here. Oh and I‚Äôm preeetty sure that most of the people hating on the idea of this chapter will be in fact purchasing it. I‚Äôm pitching a damn idea here.
---
And Self Care
---
I do because I‚Äôve seen the stranger things trailers I only started 3 weeks ago
---
Wanna play 8-ball
---
This and idk if I should get remnant from the ashes or not.
---
Lemme just say, hiding isn't the best skill to have. Sometimes it works, but killers can be smart and find you, either by luck or by noticing things like scratch marks, hearing breathing, etc. It's better to learn how to loop killers (watch No0b3 and you'll see a master at it) and knowing how to survive chases. I'm consistently rank 5 or higher and looping is the better skill. Hiding works though but to get truly better, you need to learn how to survive a chase or extend them
---
They are , but it‚Äôs really easy to figure out where your alarm clock is spawning which negates them.
---
Sometimes I want to play a good group of survivors over and over for BPs. I wish I could but the only way is KYF and there‚Äôs no reward. I know why this can‚Äôt be a feature but it would still be nice to play fun matches over and over.
---
Welcome to the game fresh meat
---
Well your point is semi proven wrong, there are snapshots of the killers power in a steam page
---
Springtrap/purple guy, being the only real murderer in the series is the only person who could do a fnaf killer justice.
---
Ngl I hate playing against spirits but this is amazing!
---
He was invited
---
he refused the invitation
---
The reality is that both sides are a pain In the ass XD
---
It's definitely right. Maybe you should quit your bullshit and contribute something useful to the post or just leave because right now you're just being useless.
---
Shes gonna be so mad when she finds you trying to break ruin
---
Power isnt a perk. Also is it text or a picture because that doesnt explain a power. So not proven wrong there pal...
---
Demegorgon
---
N0ob isn't that educational tho, it's more what survivor mains would watch to have a few laughs
---
I agree to some degree. By himself he‚Äôs not that scary but when you‚Äôre on a gen and see him stalking you from a window that‚Äôs when I shit myself
---
There was only one good comment but the others I‚Äôll just tell you what they called me noob,new to life,can‚Äôt read,another noob,I don‚Äôt know what google is,you don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre talking about because you‚Äôre new, I think that‚Äôs a lot more 2 people
---
Hex: WaKing
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be a perk, still information given away about the chapter. And you don‚Äôt need text to figure out what the power is
---
She did, you can see her crouch right before
---
I saw this too, imagine one day it's like chapter 20 then the next one is chapter 13
---
Careful that's an illegal opinion to have here.
---
I already offered help to the OP and gave him some internet/reddit advices. now, what have YOU done to "contribute something useful to the post" other than calling me a prick and toxic for trying to help the OP?
---
It's easy to get into but takes work to master. I'm still practicing looping.
---
This so much this.
---
And if it‚Äôs too easy? What then? The world ends?
---
I dono dude Nurse would be pretty freaky
---
Well thats not my problem I gave my opinion and said its fine. Just because your bothered isnt an issue. Go bother someone else my guy.
---
When I saw it was BBQ on this weeks bloodweb I had a mental breakdown. A couple weeks ago I spent about 2 whole days playing leatherface to get BBQ for my Xbox and PS4 account‚Äôs, because I thought it would never come into the shrine again because it has only came once in 3 years... up until now. At least I got it and can waste my shards for 150,000 bp.
---
That‚Äôs fine, I just disagree with you, that‚Äôs all this is. Bye.
---
A new mode with a very large map with a 16 survivors and 4 killers
---
But a picture doesnt fully explain a perk or picture. We're done now.
---
Maybe because you called his mom a pig, genius
---
wasn't that actually the same guy in the same thread lol?
---
[Exodia...](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FlickeringHighAmericansaddlebred-size_restricted.gif)
---
Dont message people on posts hours ago thats annoying.
---
lmao I just bought leatherface and then they do this.
---
Trying to help someone isn't commenting on their post and having the first thing you say be "Fuck off bro". I've helped by calling you out for your toxicity.
---
Literally
---
2 of them was one person
---
‚ÄòWell, I personally don‚Äôt fine it annoying... so it‚Äôs not a problem.‚Äô
---
Aight thanks!
---
Alright. Bet.
---
after jason, pinhead, it and the thing, BHRV will climb the tallest mountain to get the honor of putting the gang as survivors and the game will be finally complete
---
The higher ranked Michaels specifically freak me out. They know how to be weird and unpredictable.
---
Adrenaline, iron will, self care
---
I agree, Pain Reliever is the best for learning, but No0b3 is really good, and you can learn some stuff from watching him, but you'd have infer it yourself rather than being told it
---
Why does everyone consider making him detectable is a nerf, he's not even that easy to spot?
---
Agreed
---
I started playing when the clown came out, everyone hated that song but when I library it I feel really happy, just puts a smile right on my face.
---
"She is part of the main cast"
---
well can't debunk that
---
Game map is not nearly as good, in fact I find it to be hell due to all the safe pallets on the map
---
I love it, it's literally :3
---
‚ÄúLol me and Myers are having a staring contest‚Äù
---
Just make sure to do the bone piles of you see them, it will prevent a perk called No One Escapes Death (NOED for short//reference) and it allows the killers to instantly down survivors when the gates are open.
---
Another bigger perk is Barbecue and Chili which let's the killer see your aura when he hooks another survivor x distance away.
---
Otherwise perks are unpredictable and just have to do some guesswork for a lot of them.
---
No killer perks but thanks for telling me good surviver perks
---
thats a god tier team right there
---
FRESH MEAT!
---
And yet I'm being downvoted. People are weird :/
---
I just bought bubba... well I can buy corrupt intervention
---
Yes. You can be perm banned 3 times before you get hardware banned. However, I would hope they learned their lesson.
---
Ok
---
For scratch mirror myers you arent getting into chases so pallets are really that big of a factor.
---
Nice cosplay. I really like that drawing though. I would love mind a full Survivor/Killer portrait pack like that!
---
You don't think they'll let me "get off the hook" for an opinion.
---
you're alone, dumb fuck.
---
Expect things to usually not go in your favor and camping killers. And to be a good team mate, just do your part when you can. Repair gens, cleanse totems, unhook team mates, heal team mates, loop the killer.
---
They're _better_ than Clown's bottles because he can spam them as much as he wants every loop, unlike Clown who usually only has 4 bottles and has to be a lot more conservative.
---
Wait there no ptb for console
---
Get ruin to slow the game down just a little bit
---
Sorry not sorry.
---
Its regional, contextual, and depends on time of day too.  In survivor favoring metas or after a release such as Ash's, there is a lot more survivor players, after killer releases or killer favoring metas it tends to spike towards killer heavy queues, and for some regions the queue time is a bit crazy due to low player base.
---
Only babies hide in a locker against bbq. 
---
The only time you'll see me do it is if we're the only 2 survivors left and I'm by hatch and my teammates on death hook.
---
It'll get better man trust me. You just need to apply map pressure to get them off the gens. The more pressure you put on them the less likely they are going to be sitting on a gen
---
While I wouldn‚Äôt call her broken, it‚Äôs immensely unfun to play against her. Unlike good nurse players that practice their blinks through gameplay and experience, any 16 year old with a good headset and basic knowledge of the mechanics can be considered good.
---
It's good against BBQ and Nurses (as long as you recognize they have Nurses and stop healing that close) but some killers have addons that reveal survivors and you lose your tokens stupid fast against stuff like that.
---
"Why did the survivor try to kobe? BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T FOOKING UNHOOK 'IM"
---
I know I know, just teasing.
---
You have 7days. You can get 2k shards in 2
---
Hey man... just wanted to say thank you for playing positively and considering everybody‚Äôs fun and not just your own. So many people just play like giant dicks who either forget or don‚Äôt care that they‚Äôre playing with other people who just want to blow off some steam and play a fun game. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve gone into this game ready to be entertained only to end the night in a bad mood because someone was an asshole. 
---
We really need to be more positive. I‚Äôve been trying to say gg and other kind words to opponents who play fairly lately just to try and fix all the negativity and toxicity. It also just helps me feel better if I try to be nice to people
---
I understand what your coming from but a lot of people are invested on stranger things so this is big for them it will bring in a lot for them
---
#FreeCarl
---
*shade rattle*
---
Never been less excited for a game update
---
I gotta say also the movie didn‚Äôt look bad. I‚Äôm not one of those people who hates on CGI‚Äôs the only scene that really didn‚Äôt do it was the fully digital Freddy from the dog scene, but I loved his face, in the movie he has almost no nose witch I love and during one scene you can see part of his face leak off.
---
I still walk out after several games. Devotion 1
---
Best time to start playing (if you do end up getting the game) is a week or so after a rank reset
---
The first couple days are really rough as all skill levels kinda just get mashed together into what is basically CoD matchmaking
---
Yeahhh but they‚Äôd probably try a match or two.
---
Keep trying to go for personal attacks because you got called out. Nobody cares. Bye, don't come back. Go be toxic somewhere else.
---
Keep her
---
Alright, makes sense. I'm fine with things not going my way as long as the overall experience stays fun
---
If that is who u play fuck u
---
lul if i play against stranger things characters ima be an extra dick
---
Is it a 1 time thing or does it keep reappearing constantly? That would mess up my blood webs
---
Bbq is on the shrine, Luckily
---
I ran out :( And I have like 16 scratched mirrors, so sometimes I just feel like taking my chances.
---
Oh boy
---
demogorgons in the fog be like
---
Wasn‚Äôt mini scoob a villain in one of the live action movies? Maybe he could be the killer.
---
I am a killer main but also you have my sympathies because so many people are potato.
---
The snares aren't too shabby, but those dream pallets are outstanding.
---
Camping is horrible im sorry for your teammates OP.
---
She used her dash which is longer lunge, but it's still pretty impressived
---
Oh look! A Megcenary!
---
... I will see myself out.
---
Easy to assume that you live in your mother's basement.
---
Yeah I figured it was paradoxical but the mindset was no matter who I was trying to kill in front of me, something is gonna take effect. Thanks for the advicd.
---
I have close to about 2000 hours across all platforms and I must say, never liked stranger things but I'm buying the dlc to support the creators

Hey you have a nice chapter for taking the time to reply treat yourself have fun out their dont bm we dont want them running Franklin's and noed
---
Then it‚Äôll be gone for another 5000 weeks
---
I did this today to myself. Got rid of a bear trap one and got this bullshit in exchange. Then I just started wailing out loud.
---
not going anywhere. I will suggest you to do so, since you were just getting your karma drained with all the shit you're saying.
---
BBQ and chili time!!!
---
My constructive criticism is don‚Äôt say be gentle
---
I deadass thought that the first Myers I faced was cheating because he was running I think the tombstone build. He chased me and instantly stabbed the fuck outta me first thirty seconds of the game
---
Was so mad until I found out it wasn't a hack, he was just running that build and us noob ass survivors fed his Evil III really quickly
---
great i don‚Äôt have internet this week and bbq finally pops up
---
Unfortunately useless due to the survivor icon changing.
---
I mean I'm currently a rank 4 survivor and a  rank 7 killer. I'm chill with the toxic shit since well, winning is considered toxic. Get looped for ages, survivor is toxic. Killer killed you early despite not camping or intentionally tunneling, but that makes him toxic (by this I mean, you get hooked, saved, and then not even a minute later you run out directly in front of the killer because well "He shouldn't down me again, that would be tunneling" ) So No0b3 is fine by me. He's no more toxic than TrueTalent or Monto, just he's on the survivor side most of the time. Plus you also gotta realize, he gets facecamped a ton and dies a ton on stream. His youtube channel is his highlights mostly. Showing interesting games and cutting the worst ones. Like he'll probably have about 2 or 3 games in a video but to make that video likely play about 10. Because sometimes, getting downed is inevitable and if he's pissed a killer off, he's gonna get facecamped alot of those times.
---
Slightly unrelated but I had a teammate get hooked, and each person would try to free him and one by one they would get downed.
---
Out of 4 people, I was the only one standing in the first 3 minutes of the game.
---
You just tombstoned that guy juses christ may his soul rest in peace
---
it‚Äôs on the shrine right now, i hope you didn‚Äôt buy it
---
Why do you have to expose me like that ?!
---
https://youtu.be/9Jrv7TQYg5U enjoy
---
The fucking WEEK I unlock bbq this shit comes up. Imma head out
---
It still is very toxic, but not as bad as this guy makes it out to be
---
Season one is slow imo. Two and three are the best.
---
This is why I dislike Youtube nowadays. Sensitive/stupid company, fake copyrights, bloggers being the main focus and gamers being punished.
---
Do totems instead of looping and gens then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I mean I do that to scare them I only 99 the progress then let them get me
---
Perk skins that don't make my eyes bleed, nice work.
---
Shut up bitch
---
Billy has his super chainsaw sprint but the turning corners part is really more in his add-on‚Äôs and you need both of them to get the full drift King Billy build to work right but really how would you even nerf him without breaking him
---
Slightly less common but you‚Äôll still see them frequently:
---
Nurses Calling - they can see you healing basically inside their terror radius 
---
Hex: Haunted ground - two lit totems and if you break one then the whole team gets exposed (one shot down)
---
Hex: Devour Hope - another totem perk based on how many unhooks happen with them a certain distance away, once it hits 3 then everyone‚Äôs exposed and once it hits 5 they can basically just mori you at will, won‚Äôt last long that often but it‚Äôs scarier than NOED when it does since the killer has to be decent for the conditions to even be met
---
Discordance: Highlights gens with multiple people working on them for a little
---
It's just that Michael wouldn't go out of his way to hook people as offerings instead of killing them himself. Although to be fair, he does just kill them himself sometimes.
---
And the way the Entity is set up, its torture is irresistable. All of Legion also kills, despite Frank being the only one who wants to. And HOW does it torture, anyway? Doesn't that consume a lot of this energy it needs the trails to gather?
---
Well, the lore was sloppy from the Wraith onwards. I don't mind if some things don't make sense, like a man so upset about killing that he becomes a serial killer also magic, but although it's a lighter implication, the idea that the Entity is kind of a horror Mary Sue is a bit annoying to me.
---
Do the Ruin Beasts bite? Just a little bit
---
That‚Äôs kinda the point of the perk. It may be annoying, but that annoyance provides important info
---
honestly would be scarier
---
It happens when we have an influx of new players and the ranks get muddied. Im ginna wait a month and we'll be back to a normal tempo. Once again i am sorry this happened.
---
Disconnecting doesnt count as surviving, Sorry
---
You absolute god. Thank you.
---
Hex: Left Behind
---
A useless perk just like my lovelife
---
Aww. Cute doggies
---
I want it to mori me...
---
You own the DLC and are already 21 levels deep, just level up LF and save your shards. BP is much easier to get than shards
---
Ghost face is good in concept with poor execution. Mainly in his revealing mechanic. 
---
Here are my issues with him.
---
Revealing him shouldn't reveal your position to him. At the very least add a button to start revealing him so as to not accidentally reveal yourself by looking at him. So many games lost because I was looking at him behind a rock.
---
Finally, thus could be just me or lag but It feels like 50% revealing him doesn't work. Like standing in front of him camera centered and everything only to get marked and slapped.
---
Lol. The company
---
Yeah so?
---
Ehhhhhh, sorta? That got me every time when I was a new killer but eventually you notice survivors revealed by barbecue are more pink than gens are. You can actually see a pink outline through the red of the generators if they try this, though it does HELP to hide you
---
Lol!  Theres the winning wit and intelligent counterpoint I was expecting.  NOED gamers man lol.
---
looks like a coal miner from the macmillan industry who survived
---
The character himself isnt very good competitively or even casually. At least thats been my experience.
---
Agreed, so you should leave. Goodbye.
---
Pog champ
---
Maybe but I'm buying that stranger things chapter but also i want my Micheal pregiste and bbq and chili   I already have the perks for Usain bubba I'll just get distortion and corrupt but maybe bbq and chili to get more BP for other killers
---
I think everyone wants Jason but that whole thing is just a shit show especially because of the legal stuff going on and there's already a F13 game so that seems even more well odd I guess? Pretty sure remake Jason isn't mixed with the legal stuff so that's fine to come into the game I think.
---
Run while you still can.
---
I'm almost sure it's only for the bloodpoints. Unlike NOED, I think BBQ isn't even used (properly) by most people, sure it's good to find survivors, but mainly it's for the bloodpoints to counter the grind.
---
That happens to everyone tbh, loop a killer for 2 gens? Get facecamped because they couldn't stop causing you and commited, also Tru3Talent got Stream Sniper for 15 days straight by some guys,  who used a 3rd party software to get matched with him, I doubt they were red ranks since they played like yellow. Just to make him angry on stream, but they got the exact opposite, great content for Tru3's channel and some funny moments

Yeah, not trying to be rude with towards ya. I'm just super annoyed with how shit tonight's team mates have been. I play with one other person, and we are having to do it all every single match and it's becoming more exhausting than fun to play and this is my favorite game. Like we literally will have to break apart to go save 2 diff people who got hooked 10 seconds after another, then we will get tunneled down after running the killer long enough for 3 gens to get done, but only one that my friend did will be done. I just don't get it.
---
Killers can be just as toxic. Its not exclusively a survivor problem, its a community problem.
---
Yup it did
---
I mean that's just bad hitboxes and bad placement and the fact killer is the host
---
You were solo or queued with one of the other survivors? Because if you were solo, the average of 10+14+18 is 14, so close to the rank 12 killer, and you in the mix would put the overall survivor average at 12.75.
---
He needs more love he isnt loved enough he has shitty sequels and shitty lore in sequels dbd can make him better
---
He can be top 3 and balanced. Top 3 doesnt mean op it could mean others are up.
---
Yeah i get legion is really annoying to play against, probably even worse on console, but telling someone to kill themself over that is a bit far.
---
Running No Mither.
---
fuck dud it's really great idea!
---
It's definitely NOT useless. Its a consistent ruin but a bit worse, and in my opinion it's even better than ruin for hag or trapper. I'd say that it's an A tier perk as unlike ruin it cannot get destroyed but it still buys you a lot of time
---
&gt;The character himself isnt very good competitively or even casually. At least thats been my experience.
---
I disagree but also immediately lost interest in this discussion when you used the word "competitively". I'll just leave you to your opinion.
---
I mean at least waluigi is an assist trophy, Jason isn‚Äôt even a figment of the entity‚Äôs imagination. Although since the entity is this kind of weird other dimension thing that feeds off emotion and pulls survivors and killers into an eternal world i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that if Jason does get in sometime in the future he‚Äôd technically be in now,  due to the entity not obeying the laws of time.
---
How so? He is loved alot by everyone he'll alot of people even like some of the sequels plus how is dbd gonna make him better?
---
You run up to the killer, teabag, flashlight click, etc. and know the killer can't pick you up, only slug you, which is not ideal for most builds.
---
Exact same thing happened to me. Got him all the way to 32. Now I‚Äôm not sure if I should just finish off the last 3 levels or buy it off the shrine.
---
We are a duo,  both in green ranks but I was in purple before this match started. I lost a pip, because I only did one gen, saved but they were tunneled, and then died from being tunneled down after I was hooked. So we were a 8 and 9, and queued with them.
---
I personally love playing against Legion, and playing as Legion. I'm not sure why everyone hates playing against them.
---
Swing Chains is pretty good on itself but it is absolutely nuts combined with red paint brush.
---
More spotlight for him havent heard of him in the movie industry for a while people will main him making him more popular
---
Slow down his move speed when he revs
---
*I have school during this and I am very sad*
---
Yos jason walks through pallets
---
The community is incredibly toxic a lot of the time (but not all of the time) from Rank 16 onwards. 
---
There is no Unranked mode.
---
You have an objective disadvantage early because perk slots are locked until certain character levels are reached.
---
You have a subjective disadvantage unless you pay a lot because many perks require a character and all licensed characters are paywalled.
---
Income is extremely slow, with it taking months of regular play to unlock a single unlicensed character (and gain the potential to unlock their 3 perks), and a long time to unlock Teachable perks which comprise the meta.
---
Perks you get are random. You may just not be able to build the character you want due to a luck factor.
---
Teams of Survivors have an objective advantage over solo players because they can voice chat, which the devs never accounted for.
---
I can't recommend the game at all in actuality, but if you want to see it at its best and pick up some tricks, I recommend Otzdarva's vids. Actually, "not Otzdarva's."
---
If you did a quick youtube search on "how to loop DBD", you'd find countless videos. Why don't you try this from now on? Search for the answer instead of asking another repetitive question in 5 minutes. 
---
You complained about people not being nice to you because you are new but you aren't helping here. SEARCH!!! 99% of your new player questions have already been answered. Is google blocked where you live or something like that? You can still use reddit's search tho.
---
Its cool man,i understand. People are ne2 and scared to do things. I've had to bring a toolbox and streetwise to get gens done. Freakin streetwise! It sucks but i'll deal. Its fine to vent.
---
Uh right this way Sorry to keep you waiting
---
Idk. I'm a Male who plays Mortal Kombat and when looking at the new fatalities, I always try it on women because it seems worse.
---
Idk, I don't like seeing women suffering, so the fatality seems more gruesome.
---
That's actually a good point. Yea you're right that would make the franchise get more interest
---
It was on the shrine twice before, once in March (or around that time) and another one almost two years ago right after Leatherface came out iirc
---
Not a very good killer from my experience. If you level him and put on the right perks he can be good for the memes but thats about it. BBQ is the best part about him so I'd say just grab it from the shrine.
---
Pro tip: don‚Äôt be afraid of the killer, it helps a lot.
---
Unless he gets the Halloween treatment push him way into present make him older but still strong and spotlight again but cost
---
second worst
---
You are severely under valuing the aura BBQ gives you. You can, in a lot of cases, be in a chase after hooking someone within 10 -15 seconds. The fact that it increases BP gain  on top of it makes it a set and forget on every killer
---
I'm really happy about the Stranger Things because it's gonna bring so many more players to the game
---
Ah who am I kidding I'm only here for steve
---
What about toes?
---
I have never played the game, I just watch Youtubers play it.. mostly I‚Äôm in it for the lore and backstories.
---
Yep 80% of the time, Ruin gets cleaned **immediately** and the guaranteed 2 minutes of gen slowing that Corrupt gives you, is worth it.
---
Plus lightweight will give u freedom to run and do the gens. Urban won't help you with that. Urban is slow, but it's handy.
---
I'd get rid of self care if you're serious about doing gens. You'll get use to not having it
---
Oh cool.. thx for that i never knew
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs big brain time
---
The entity is beyond time I think, but still follows some rules for itself. A future character would make sense regarding how we have characters from all different years appearing in some sort of order.
---
It's not quite as intuitive as you'd assume, I had to explain BHVR to several friends who play games.
---
Especially if you just skip past the opening menus and Behavior Interactive = BHVR doesn't click right away.
---
Aww man
---
wait, so i can basically place all 4 portals at 1 spot and guard that so the survs are basically stuck there unless they wanna get hit?
---
Can we get a link to the promos?
---
What does dlc mean :p
---
I was new too, but newer players shouldn't be matched against green ranks. I could see yellow but green is a little much. I've been running keys, so we can try to do 3 gens ourselves, and escape that way because with bbq, the tunneling, and the newer players getting 5 gens done with 2 ppl is damn near impossible. Not a man btw,  just throwing that out there lolololol.
---
I JUST BOUGHT FUCKING SPIRIT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
---
One person playing well does not make a killer OP.
---
Nah 1/2 meter if the killer isn't in you,it's not camping...it's protecting!
---
Lol, salty pop.
---
thank you for posting this, i just got on to buy it and i havent played in a while
---
You didn't answer the question.  I take it looping isn't a strong point of yours then?  Those of us that can chase force Billy's to M1 unless you're caught out in the open with nothing which you should never put yourself in that situation anyways if you play with awareness. Billy is good but far from OP.  He can be looped like any Wraith.  I'd he even tries to rev his saw at a loop he's literally just giving you additional free loops that other killers don't offer.  Well Bubba does too but he's far less common to see at red ranks.
---
Sorry the rick threw me off. Its cool pickle just bring a toolbox as well wirh charge addons. Best of luck.
---
Next big battle, Demogorgon VS Mind Flayer
---
Of course it‚Äôs a pity party for the killers, because they have it soooo ‚Äúhard‚ÄùüôÑ sorry you got stuck with teammates like that, it really is an instant handicap
---
.....Just finish him off. While not meta, Franklin's is useful when you see 2/3/4 flashlights or toolboxes in the lobby.
---
Who are those tools anyways?
---
**D**own**l**oadable **C**ontent. Additional content (in this case, the new Stranger Things characters) that can be bought for games.
---
HA, what about killers treating the baby surviviors better? Instead of breeding the "toxic purple flash light immerse Claudettes" y'all complain about? I've gotten matched up with noob survivors tonight who killers completely took advantage of, camped and tunneled them to death.
---
Indeed
---
Not good Billys.
---
I think you mean exactly the normal map but with a blue overlay.
---
It's a nice meme, nice job!
---
I'm ok with it.
---
Anyone know how much it's gonna be?
---
I posted Night Mother as OG Iron Maiden last week from Skyrim and Mods deleted it, hope you have better luck.
---
You queued with the 16 and 18 as a 4 man swf?
---
I love the game but I hate myself for loving it and each time I play I lose a little part of myself but it's great. You'll understand this feeling if you get it.
---
Exactly! They want matches like this it seems,  when they just completely shit on everyone or they hate it and it's unfair. I've seriously had team mates all night who the killers just shit on immediately,  and I'm like well we are fucked lol.
---
excuse me?
---
We aren't with them. Only two of us. Idk how we got matched with the gray ranks.
---
I bought leatherface yesterday ;(
---
Animated-
---
You can move at triple speed if unseen, but survivors see your aura when within 24 meters.
---
Can turn windows and pallets into fakes, blocking movement for survivors when they try to use them.
---
A fake pallet or window turns into blank, sheetrock wall, as the image of the pallet or window falls off of it and drifts to the ground.
---
This is my new favorite meme template
---
If you are only buying a killer for how good they are, go spirit. Or Michael. If you want to have fun go for Plague. Only problem is, her perk is controlled by survivors.
---
Her perk alone doesn't make her worth it. Go for Spirit, she's stupidly strong even without perks
---
Survivors are meant to be annoying, that‚Äôs how they live
---
Exactly, thank you
---
Finally, bbq
---
Where can I get big brain like him?
---
Lol just like Rick and Morty, and couldn't think of a name. It's fine tho, wasn't mad about it, no need to apologize. One of us carry a tool box, the other a key,  and hope for the best. Lol.
---
I'll take it from your continued deflection of my original question that my assumption held true and this is yet another Billy is broken post from someone that simply never put the time into learning how to chase.  Practice your loops with pallets and windows and watch how many maces these men got to swing your way.
---
That new wraith skin
---
Noob3 did one (or several dunno) videos on this.
---
I already have that character
---
There was a video earlier of a Laurie dicking around in the exit gate and getting downed when she could have left and using Decisive Strike on the Killer.
---
Does that sound like anti-tunneling?
---
There are lots of ways that DS just accounts for survivors being bad with a sixty second timer on it, including a survivor getting caught healing somewhere dumb, it's like people complaining about Adrenaline vs. NOED, but with BBQ&amp;C (or Nurse's Calling) and DS.
---
BBQ&amp;C lets you finish your current chase and get a hook and spot survivors that are not in lockers outside of forty meters. Nurse's Calling lets you try and find a healing survivor.
---
So if Survivor A gets unhooked and thirty seconds later I hook Survivor B, and then I spot Survivor A healing in a corner through BBQ&amp;C or NC and I down him, he gets to DS me if I don't leave him on the ground to be healed up for free? I'm literally not allowed to touch him for another thirty seconds?
---
I can't just camp the slug, 30 seconds is forever (generators are repaired in 64 seconds w/ high "rarity" toolbox) in the course of the game, so this survivor gets a second chance they don't deserve.
---
Did you read the topic? I'm asking everybody to treat every new player well. I personally have no problem with purple flashlight clauds
---
Really not that bad
---
If im playing a survivor id still love to ask survivors about perk builds, skills, technique, etc.. Even give advice to others. 
---
Making friends would be a huge plus too. 
---
As a killer itd be cool to ask survivors about how i could improve, gamplay stuff and so on. 
---
Toxic ppl will always be there. That doesnt change in any game. It never will. I wanna make the most of what i can and this would be awesome to help alot of people do that including me. 
---
A mute button is all it takes to water down all that salt.
---
You do bring up a good point but I don't think playing the objective as killer breeds toxic survivors just annoyed ones, it's mostly big streamers that breed toxicity with how they act and when new players see it they think it's acceptable to act like a asshat.
---
Yeah but you more addressed the killer side,  when I think they're the more toxic ones tbh.
---
I think I play this game enough/have a lot of BP offerings that I just got to 1 mil only to prestige a character, in the hopes that I will have 1 mil by the time the DLC comes around
---
Spirit is much better, Dark Devotion is pretty meh. It sounds good in writing but it pretty much never ends up doing anything useful.
---
People are talking about getting enough for a cosmetic
---
Are you telling me to use scratch mirrors Myers on the new in door map? Sure thing buddy. Hey I haven't played Killer in a few months and I'm currently rank 15 as a result. So by the time the DLC comes out I'll be even lower. Thanks for the idea! - former Rank 1 killer
---
Get out while you can. The elitists toxicity will suck you in and swallow you whole. This community is horrible.
---
At this point, I'm pretty sure the entire fan base has agreed on Scopps Ahoy :)
---
I been playing since a little after release and didn't know that
---
pre-historic, Viking Era or Ancient Egypt would be awesome.
---
Yeah. It could be that African Village from the intro. Plenty of Windows &amp; Pallet locations. Plus it has verticality to make up for a lack of size. Multiple floors and rooftops and stuff.
---
 Plus there are many possibilities with a giant axe Hammer thing. He's also bigger than trapper
---
That actually scared me for a second
---
Also he'll complain that he got 4-/5-genned because a survivor had a very good loop against his killer (e.g. Huntress), but will continue to chase that survivor anyway.
---
Like... good job...
---
No one‚Äôs gonna get pissed off at you for using Noed. It‚Äôs your own fault that you‚Äôre bad and refuse to get better.
---
One time my cousin and I literally ‚Äòplayed‚Äô the same killer like 4 times in a row. A nurse that would DC at the very start of the trial, after we all loaded into the game. Lost a few offerings due to that annoying pierce of shit lol
---
Bruh I just finished Bubba
---
Save Shards first. BP are ezpz to get comparatively, and theres no max on them, so if you save up a lot of them first, then get BP, youll be in better shape
---
I do agree. But after being being face camped so many times,  can turn even the nicest survivior toxic. Then they become toxic to a killer who isn't toxic,  which then they do the same their next match. It's a vicious cycle.
---
yeah, I've been using Franklin's and dang, it's really helps with flashlights and toolboxes. lol
---
Tried that trick never could get it to work are you on PC
---
I do it to actually if i feel like they earned it!(: obviously i dont message most games and 95% of the time its just gg. Id like to get a lot more out of that though and talk to tjem about the game, perks they ran, style of play, etc.. Maybe im too social for my own good but i feel like learning from better players, making friends post game,  and giving a gg over chat isnt a bad wish to hope for.
---
I fee like if I‚Äôm not pro with sneaking and tend to panic quickly and just give my location away around killers I should use lightweight over urban
---
That's a great idea, but I think simply taking away their bloodpoints when not engaged in a chase so they either lose a pip or don't pip is fair enough. 
---
As I've said before survivors are penalized for not unhooking the first two players, and a camping killer is preventing that from happening so they shouldn't be rewarded for it. We aren't.
---
Holy keys Batman
---
r/blursedimages
---
I use noed and I agree
---
He already peed on her according to his comments
---
You can‚Äôt use streamers who represent the very pinnacle of play as an example of how X thing is OP because 99% of the playerbase will never be able to play like them. Streamers and pros can make just about any combo for something in games they play all the time work.
---
I feel like an idiot for replying on your previous thread with actual tips and seriousness. You are clearly trolling with all these "I am a noob" questions in short amount of time between them. First you asked about Thanatophobia, then you asked how to loop and now you are talking about 360s and PROs?
---
This last question suggests that you, at least, watch enough DBD gameplay to no longer be considered brand new to the game, specially when you use slang like "360 and pros".
---
The broken key is basically useless. My friend and I run them because we've been playing with noobs all night,  and we attempt to do 3 gens alone to find hatch. Only we we can get out anymore.
---
&gt; Trapper was just an enforcer
---
For his father, to whom he was extremely loyal to. Under his father's direct orders, he beat and starved his workers, and frequently treated unruly ones "with a visit to the furnace." Not to mention the incident of trapping over 100 men in the mines to suffocate.
---
Sure, he may not be technically a 'serial' killer by pure definition, but he's a mass murderer with no qualms of getting his own hands dirty to please his father.
---
&gt; Doctor just wanted to continue working towards success
---
He was a sociopath who tortured and killed his victims well past what would've been morally acceptable on enemy spies.
---
Again, I guess he's not technically a 'serial' killer, but the same thing applies to him as it did the Trapper.
---
&gt; Huntress is a clueless child
---
I don't get these types of comments. She's not a 'child'. Yes, she grew up living alone in the woods, but it doesn't make her emotionally stunted. If anything, she turned "feral", as a wild animal would.
---
She hunted humans, and she knew exactly what she was doing. She's well aware that she doesn't need to kill them to survive, yet she does so anyway.
---
&gt; Jigsaw was creating games that make people realize how special their life is
---
Yeah, I can see that with specific cosmetics, but it's still not terribly grindy. And to be fair, it's a free cosmetic that someone put hard work into.
---
WW2 or 1 seems kind of cool
---
That's bad. Lowering the chance of it being something else/more useful items.
---
Yea it is but I think more people are toxic because of streamers then getting facecamped allowing the survivor to do other stuff like watch a video.
---
Ooh I‚Äôd love to see what a Viking era killer would be like, maybe inspired by the mythos
---
So, did you buy LF since BBQ is on the shrine now?
---
what's your id? we could play some matches (I'm rank 18 survivor, almost never play them lol)
---
I think on both sides of the game we can all agree that the matchmaker is often garbage and unfair.
---
Spirit plays similar to Jason from F13 the game
---
I suppose. I don't watch many streamers,  but I'm also not toxic unless it's done to me first and only against that same killer. I enjoy a good match rather I die on not,  and tend to make a lot of killer friends.
---
I am new
---
Well yes but actually no.
---
Oof. I feel bad for ya dude. I get some games as killer can be pretty shitty, but I don‚Äôt think people realize it‚Äôs can be just as bad, if not worse as a survivor due to having to RELY on your team.
---
Yes, but you only see one side complaining 98% of the time so I figured I'd shine some light that it goes both ways.
---
They‚Äôre amazing but some maps don‚Äôt have hardly any places to use them then on others it‚Äôs like every five feet there‚Äôs multiple spots to spawn them.
---
Lol I get that but they don't.  They see 3 keys so probably expected the worst.  Also 2 keys is legit horrid to go up against.  Definitely don't condone the babycamps but I could easily understand why he was annoyed with you all.  That item is pretty stupid lol.  It's basically our Mori.
---
What this game actually needs is people to understand how ping / latency work and only then, complain about the few yet very specific issues hitbox related this game has.
---
I usually do better then most of my teammates. Not necessarily always winning, but I don't get destroyed by her, and constantly lose her when she's haunting me.
---
I'm using iron will+ lightweight combo. I run spine chill too sometimes as that will let me know when I should be running. So when she haunts me. I'll be running in a direction. Stop running for a moment, and I'll change direction. When there's an opportunity I sprint out of there. She's so confused she thinks I'm still in that area. I could be in a locker, watching her look dumb.
---
She has a hard time tracking me with lightweight, and she can't hear me. I run through grass, to avoid being detected by blood. She uses scratch Marks to track you, but she can't see your physical body. It easy to deceive her.
---
 If you're constantly sprinting, she will catch u. Blood puddles gives you out too. But she mainly relies on sound
---
RIP
---
To be fair you need a very high IQ to understand Richard and Mortimer
---
mayybe what we need isnt hitboxes changes but rather some freaking dedicated servers
---
it rarely works but yea, waste time trying to learn that
---
Do you realize how low the stats are on surviviors escaping anymore? Lol. I was red ranks before rank reset, I started this game on PC and moved to ps4 so I could play with a few friends. So I've been playing quite awhile, and it seems a lot of things go in favor of the killer. I'm only in Yellow to Green rank as killer because I rarely play,  and I get a 4k almost every single time because so many surviviors are absolute garbage or new. I will say I won't hate on a newer player. With ruin, and other things, if surviviors aren't good at skill checks or don't want to gen tap they'll look for totems instead of doing gens. I've had matches like this one where I'm the ONLY one whose done a gen because of ruin. So I don't think a key is that unfair. Killers can stomp the hatch now and it activates the ultimate crutch which is NOED, lol. So yes, I think surviviors do something deserve a "easy" way out. And, trust me. I'm objective I have even made post in the past about the insane amount of survivior toxicity and so on. But the game is not in our favor,  especially when it's only two people doing anything what so ever.
---
I think it's pitiful on both ends. Sucks when you get good survivors as a lower tier killer and when you get crap teammates that ruin the fun.
---
you gotta word this better
---
and that doesn't make any sense, there's not any correlation between the 2 "getting in"
---
Just read through the comments, this post sure backfired.
---
Corrupt intervention can also help killers who rely on zone control/map pressure by shutting down a whole section of the map for a few minutes (i.e. trapper doesn‚Äôt need to worry about trapping that side and can instantly build up traps and pressure on the side with workable gens because he knows survivors must come)
---
I thought im all ears was a ghostface perk
---
Doesnt nurse have stridor thanatophobia and nurses calling?
---
TT is just discount bbq with a unneccessary cooldown
---
Behaviour Interactive, the company that made the game
---
How would it lead to problems?
---
&gt;mayybe what we need isnt hitboxes changes but rather some freaking dedicated servers
---
You see, this right here... People have no idea how latency works. Even dedicated servers won't get rid of "unfair" hits. Depending on where you live and how far the server is, your ping can still be fairly high which will continue to cause hits that looked like they wouldn't connect. 
---
The only way to completely remove unfair hits (or close to that) is by playing on LAN.
---
Old reply, but I like your idea. Needs some tweaking, but solid base for what Legion should be.
---
I agree. It is rough for both,  but as I said in another comment no one ever comments about how rough it is for survivors.
---
That is so unbearably cute! Are you planning on making more and selling them? I would definitely buy one. &lt;3
---
SCOOPS AHOY PLEASE!
---
I'm a doc main ;)
---
What about Adrenaline and Dead Hard?
---
LITHE FOR LIFE PLEASE
---
 LIKE XD
---
See that shit is insane,  and makes no sense. Why have ranks if they're going to be that far off with match making. Hopefully they at least did ONE gen to contribute to your game,  I haven't been so lucky tonight.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctchr3/is_there_any_way_to_buy_a_perk_from_the_shrine/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
This in a nutshell, except I play Killer less these days, so I end up at rank 13-15 and move up to 10\~
---
Games switch from being filled with absolute potatoes of survivors to people who can abuse every trick in the book to make sure you can't ever catch them.
---
Yeah both of these perks are far better.
---
Yellow and green rank killer is potato ranks man.  You could 4K playing adept Claudette at those ranks.  Play killer side seriously through red ranks and then come back to this conversation because you obviously play survivor hardcore and killer quite casual which is why you won't necessarily be able to relate to what I'm describing.  Keys are the biggest crutch survivors have period they are worse than instaheals by far.  I try not to use Moris or Keys because I recognize them both as being easy mode for their respective side.
---
Glitching?
---
Balanced landing has an awesome passive effect.You can always choose when to use it.Combine it with dead hard and you are golden.
---
I think noed should require you to get hooks for it to work. Rewarding the killer for the survivors doing their job isn't very good.
---
not entirely. it's reasonable to tunnel if you run dying light, or if they get gens done quickly, it will eliminate one of them and add pressure. what you did wasn't exactly tunneling. it would be if you went after one person until they were dead.
---
Thanks :) Feel free gimme a shout-out on Twitter to the devs. Maybe something‚Äôll happen
---
Dark Devotion isn't really good
---
Eh, I disagree, with TT it activates on pickup, so it gives survivors way less time to prep to and get off a gen, where with BBQ they have some time to jump in a locker. With TT if they get off the gen when the survivor is picked up they are blocked for a time from returning to it, whereas BBQ they can just get out if the locker almost immediately after hook and get back to a gen. BNQ offers what is probably better tracking, bit TT makes up for it in game slow down imo
---
I hate going against franklins myself but killers need some way to counter instaheals, strong toolboxes, skeleton keys, etc. lol
---
Oh boy where do I start.
---
#Welcome to Dead by Daylight!
---
Lemme lay some ground rules.
---
1. Fuck Legion. 
---
2. Respect the Baby Dwights
---
3. Half of this fanbase is toxic, but not everyone is.
---
4. We want Shirtless Myers
---
5. Hex: Ruin is the Killer meta
---
6. Bubba is bad killer
---
7. Claudette is a very sneaky gurl
---
HAVE FUN and DON'T TRY TO BREAK YOUR COMPUTER!
---
Billy is balanced, Nurse and Spirit are OP, the rest suck ass. does this help?
---
Also make Borrowed Time proximity based, not Terror Radius based.
---
Given everyone seems to enter lockers to counter BBQ, would Iron Maiden be a decent perk to run now? Sure, a lot of the time they'll be on the other side of the map, but it essentially removes lockers as an option if the killer is nearby.
---
i actually think all exhaustion perks are bad. DBD is all about time management and fast decision making. Anything that requires you to change your optimal route in a chase/before a chase is bad imo. Be honest, how many times do you have a killer running towards you, and instead of run as far away as possible you run closer towards (not directly, but closer in terms of diagonally), just in order to use your Lithe/balanced landing? 
---
Stealth perks/objective perks are better
---
If I was playing solo and/or specifically trying to rank up, I don't think it would be worth the perk slot.
---
However, when I'm just playing for fun with friends, I love running it so I can call out if they need to watch for BBQ/Nurse's/jumpscare Myers/Bitter Murmur/anything really. It's a comfort perk that makes the game much more enjoyable so I don't end up playing around killers that "might" have BBQ or Nurse's.
---
&gt;With SPRINT BURST you have to walk everywhere you go.
---
You can run nonstop and while your exhaustion recovers, work on gens, totems and healing after unhook. You can even run while holding your exhaustion at 99%. 
---
Lithe is a decent exhaustion perk but being forced to get stuck in an animation can be deadly against specific killers like Nurse or Huntress and also against every other killer if you can't get a fast vault. 
---
Balanced Landing is considered the best exhaustion perks because it has a passive tied to it and is extremely strong if used in certain loops (*cough* Haddonfield *cough*).
---
Can't wait to flashlight a demogorgon
---
TAKE MY MONEY
---
Most people use adrenaline and a different exhaustion Park and I hate dead hard so much that I didn't even consider it
---
Tier 1 Myers.
---
My 3 oblivious teammates crouched 5 meters from where he's hooking me.
---
Nobody escapes marriage
---
Bru
---
They can't add crawling killers they've said it on screen because it's too difficult to animate
---
One was desperately trying to flashlight him, but he always moved and turned
---
SLugging is part of DS, the rest of that has nothing to do with DS and is just general toxicity. It's also a totally valid play to proc DS on purpose by jumping into a locker or what not
---
I always used to play KYF and do stupid things like, no blink Nurse, or no chainsaw Billy or snipe Huntress, and used to love doc. I got into a killer match and got a 4k my first game. Not only was it because the survivors were potatoes, but also because I kinda trained while playing KYF and learned while watching NotOtz and N0ob3. Now I'm a rank 12 survivor and rank 16 killer in under a month. The best way to train is KYF and watching vids. If your on xbox it's even easier since you can get group posts killed with toxic kiddies who scream when you beat the shit outta them. And the relief is good too. Welcome to the community dude.
---
You‚Äôre right, he didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a no for everyone because I don‚Äôt have problems with it‚Äù, he said ‚ÄúNo, because I don‚Äôt ha e problems‚Äù. Suggesting he disagrees with its change despite others issues due to himself not recognizing them or feeling they‚Äôre justified.
---
Also, when did I attack him? Or make a logical fallacy?
---
A combined chapter where they stand on each others' shoulders to have a normal height killer.
---
But they do if you‚Äôre a good killer lmfaooooo fuck you mean? Silent bell wraith? Prayer beads spirit? You‚Äôre gonna tell me no other killer gets easy ass first hits? That somehow Legion isn‚Äôt as shit as EVERYONE but you is saying? Okay bud.
---
Regardless of whether or not the mechanic is stupid, if you‚Äôre failing it so many times that it‚Äôs making you that angry, either you‚Äôre keyboard doesn‚Äôt work properly or you‚Äôre doing something wrong. I doubt the devs will be changing it any time soon so you might wanna start looking into the other problem.
---
Since more horror icons are being added I thought I‚Äôd list off more iconic killer s and franchises. Obviously this is just spitballing and it doesn‚Äôt mean all should be added. These are just concepts, not theories or full suggestions, be nice :). If you have any more leave any comments below.

---
Sorry for the long reply :)
---
Plague is great. She‚Äôs fun to play and has three viable unique perks. She can snowball very hard and is effective against most skill levels assuming you can mind-game a pallet.
---
They tried it already. it broke the game
---
40 meters is enough to be in a dangerous spot of the killer decides to come for you, especially a Nurse or Billy. So if they are a bit out of your terror radius, people will still be spotted with BBQ but be close enough that they need to move.
---
had to hit me with it huh
---
but it would fix the unfair hits that are caused by the killers lag. bc right now the killer runs the server and whatever they see happening is what happens regardless of the survivors perspective. dedicated servers would eliminate those issues. not ping issues. if the survivor has bad ping that is on them
---
Micheal Myers is no where near serial killer yet. Yeah you can stab but can you *succ*?
---
It's your job to stop them
---
Good Luck
---
It's called Behind the Mask the rise of Leslie Vernon. It's a great movie. He shows how the greats like Freddy, Jason, and Michael are able to do what they do. It starts as a documentary and turns into a movie. Kane Hodder, Robert England, and Zelda Rubbenstien are in it among others. It's a master piece I think.
---
How much I need it please
---
that's a nerf tbh
---
I‚Äôm on a plane flight :(( mori me please... üëå

Reminder that sole survivor only activates when your team dies
---
Mark it as spoiler &gt;.&gt;
---
Art the clown :)
---
It's been tried before, survivors abused the shit out of it so it was removed.
---
Oooh, that would finally add some gore into the game! I‚Äôm guessing ur a dead meat fan from the come t no?
---

Whalecum 2 plebbit, home of the downvote dog pile from sweaty house dwellers who feel like the emperor giving the thumbs up or down

Stop typing like this
---
Sorry im new to the game what's everybody freaking out about?
---
Damn, might watch it some day thanks! It‚Äôs no pennywise though :) ü§°
---
From the what? Lol but yeah hes a cool guy
---
Here's to hoping they rework Bubba next and make him actually fun to play.
---
Other killers should be buffed to billy's power level
---
If the killer camps the first two players, you have no excuses for not having all 5 gens powered and gates open. 
---
Killers are punished for camping with loss of pips and terrible bloodpoints unless the survivors fuck up playing against the camper, no further punishment is required. Anything added further isn't going to stop people camping because they want to spite someone and is more likely to punish innocent players.
---
Wait, what? There're tutorials??? I did not know this... Been playing for a few months now - is it too late to do them tutorials? xD
---
Swing Chains is good with basically any addon.
---
Don‚Äôt worry about it man, people tend to not like when killers do that, but if you‚Äôre having fun then screw em
---
DERP FACE  IS DOG POOP
---
I'm sure that they will continue to show up on your blood-webs as normal. :)
---
Oops typed too fast, meant to say comment.
---
It the camping. You actually lose BPs for doing what you did.  You want to move around the map, and hook each survivor at least twice.
---
Howd my comment say ima dead meat fan lol
---
camping gives no one a chance and makes the game unfun so yeahh
---
Wtf
---
Please, go away.
---
derpface is pretty good, you just dont know how to use him
---
how is that fun? waiting doing nothing? this guys gotta be trolling lmao
---
Hopefully they go better for you, dude!
---
Nope. Trust me, if you try to play how every else tells you to, youll almost never win. Just grow at your own rate and, if you're having a bad day, turn off the chat.
---
and leatherface is any better?
---
I‚Äôm just assuming he‚Äôs new to killer
---
This is the stuff I‚Äôm talking about, an actual suggestion. I think the frenzy stun is too severe and shouldn‚Äôt be as long and drastic when you use frenzy for mobility and don‚Äôt hit a single survivor. Gives them a good 3-4 second head start and it hurts them a lot. I use it to get to a gen from across the map, frenzy stun, finish gen in my face then sprint burst away.
---
try to get someone w an xbox to log in for you and buy it
---
Salty
---
Oh. Didn‚Äôt know.
---
Camping is universally seen as bad for both you and the survivors. As you climb the ranks, you'll get more and more punished for camping, and you'll realize it's not fun for anyone, as well as detrimental to both your rank and your points.
---
if he gets implemented, is he the first human killer? in terms of appearance?
---
And for some reason they all seem to be getting upvotes
---
Not Tier I Myers, though, right?
---
Had [this](https://funkyimg.com/i/2Wokf.png) happen to me as well just a couple days ago, even something similar once or twice today. Do you think it is cause of the influx of new players via the Stranger Things DLC? I think maybe there are so many new players the matchmaking is spazzing lol.
---
I love playing with Plague. But I say get them all.
---
No they dont, the majority of what they do is just copy and paste in game descriptions
---
everyone likes to be salty when killers use noed. doesnt mean youre bad if you use it, obviously if you can get one hit you can get two. it gives you more time to hit people 4 times instead of 8 when theres only 15 seconds until the doors open
---
Know one told me what there called so that‚Äôs what I call them
---
Personally, I would prefer a killer from a post apocalyptic future. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be a zombie/monster, it could be a wasteland survivor.
---
1.5k hours here. It is an amazing game, the more you play it the more you realize there's more to learn. Even professional streamers sometimes lack tiny informations that  make a big difference. Just a VERY important tip: try to understand the game mechanics and how to counter each obstacle instead of rageposting here/harassing the other players. In fact we all could benefit from this behavior. See you in the fog.
---
what are they? when youre doing the gens?
---
I'm not telling you hoe to play, people will just punish you for playing the way you do. You don't get any points either. Neither side does.
---
Oh my fucking god
---
Yeah
---
When does the ptb come out
---
skill checks
---
i honor your sacrifice

Ok thanks for telling

You‚Äôre not popping 5 gens with 2 people on the hook. You‚Äôre assuming those players are good enough to loop long enough and or won‚Äôt kill themselves on the hook because the killer is camping them. That statement ONLY applies to SWF players. 
---
The entire point of adding the penalty for survivors was because they were leaving players on the hook. Even when the killer wasn‚Äôt camping. That change fixed it and this would too. 
---
Making them lose points and depping is so they stay at higher ranks and either get good or uninstall. It‚Äôs not fair to the hooked player who will depip because of a shitty players inability to play the game. 
---
If BHVR isn‚Äôt going to separate SWF from solo, this is the only fair way to deal shitty killers. This not a random issue, it‚Äôs a constant complaint from survivors that hasn‚Äôt been addressed and needs to be.
---
I would use tt if the cooldown didnt exist
---
&gt;punish
---
punish me how?
---
These people cannot be that new,  because of their perks. If they only had 1 perk on,  or a few at level 1/2 maybe I could believe that lol. That's what I don't understand about the whole thing, unless they took a LONG break. It could be that we are getting new players,  maybe the game is purposely doing it in Hope's we can carry them and they'll like it. Lol. To bad it's just getting them dirt napped by the killer in the first 30 seconds of the match. &gt;.&lt;
---
Also let's not forget bloodpoints
---
The BP gains from BBQ &amp; Chili is really really nice; it's also a great aura-reading perk
---
Flashlight perk sort of already exists, lightborn and overwhelming presence.
---

---
Gotta love when they hit air and you like ow
---
Getting all the gens done. Once you get to higher ranks, people wont play the "camping" game with you. They'll get 3 almost 4 gens done before he dies. On hook.
---
The first =D
---
wait
---
There were tutorials???
---
I WAS EATING THOSE BEANS. I, WAS EATING, THOSE BEANS!
---
I can picture it now hahaha
---
i think what we should do is kill them normally. let them learn but dont camp them and actually give them a chance. that waytheyll know what to do and wont be babied but willhave a chance
---
Don't listen to the whiners. You do you, and you'll learn what works, what you can do to improve your score, as time progresses. Don't listen to survivors trying to tell you the "rules" you have to play by. Play to win and you'll always have fun. Survivors who also play to win will have a challenge and fun as well. Survivors who are less skilled and refuse to admit their own flaws and mistakes and work to improve them will try and degrade you to make themselves feel better. Ignore them and worry about yourself and what you can learn from observing your own gameplay.
---
What is happening in this picture?

Am I the only one who gets scared as a killer looking for the hatch without sight of the last survivor? It‚Äôs tense af

Ah. Yes. I just realized that too. What a bunch of fuckin' clowns.
---
people were keeping the killer there to waste his time when one or two people were working on gens. it was a time of infinites and 20s cooldown while in chase sprint bursts tho
---
also, if they ever implemented this, they should also greatly speed up the dying rate when the gens are done, as camping there is not "toxic", it's a must (most killers can't get another down when the gates are open/powered. leaving is just a bad idea.)
---
I'm actually beating myself up right now. I've wanted Distortion for a while, the past 3 weeks I said it'll come in the bloodweb, it didn't, finally cave in and go on a grind for Jeff's perks, get his teachable, then have to get it in the bloodweb for Kate anddddd 4 days later, it's here lmfao
---
If he doesn't play killer , is not BBQ who gonna give him bloodpoints xD
---
just bought DLC for BBQ and this shit happens in the same week. fml
---
Steve and Nancy are not the top billed cast, David Harbor is up there with Winona Ryder

Maybe they could have a Scooby Doo cosmetics as a license for the og four people
---
It doesn‚Äôt really depip you, it‚Äôs just a visual thing.
---
May be scary at first but after a while, it‚Äôs just competitive. I recommend watching some you tubers play it to get a better understanding of what to do.
---
2 killers on kyf
---
And yet if you‚Äôre a baby killer you will not get treated well at all. Lol
---
Camping doesn‚Äôt put pressure on gens and it is not  at all impossible for them to unhook the teammate.
---
rare perk that youd normally have to buy a shit killer and level him up a bunch to get is now available for everyone if u have in game points
---
&gt;never understand
---
I'll play survivor eventually but really I just enjoy the hunt and seeing the kill.
---
&gt;swayed by opinions
---
I guess? Most people who sound like killers are saying play how like, though there are drawbacks. The survivors just seem to think im a bitch.
---
really good perk btw and i say rare because it was only out twice before, once this year and once like 2 years ago
---
Same price I‚Äôd think  but it could be more
---
Thats the big one imo lol^
---
Don't force new players to be tryhards, it's just awful, let them have fun and learn by themselves. Also, playing killer helps a lot in understanding what they are capable of, which will make it easier for you when playing as a survivor.
---
To summarize, your comment doesn't make any sense.
---
I mean I use spine chill every match because I play stealthy but its not the best skill because if you get found or you are against a killer who has an uncanny ability to find you, you gonna be in a chase. So yes, its a great skill, but to get to red ranks you gonna need to learn to survive chases. Stealth is just the icing to prevent as many chases as possible.
---
Again your assuming they are SWF and are communicating. They will either disconnect or kill themselves on the hook. That happens more times then a player actually hanging there allowing us to do gens. 
---
I‚Äôve played this game across all three platforms for over 2 and half years and it‚Äôs rare a player just hangs there. Everyone knows that. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen, but it‚Äôs not as easy or as frequent as you are making it seem, 
---
Not to mention BVHR nerfed decisive strike which would help to prevent that. I‚Äôm not going to go down this path making excuses for bad killers are explain how the game really is. 
---
It is major issue and needs a fix. Penalizing then will do it.
---
I love Otz and Pain Reliever! But yeah No0b3 is an entertainer but still, it was more of to show what good looping looks like rather than to teach you to loop.
---
first, you must read 'The Survivor's Rulebook for Killers.'
---
I believe you mean... No Mither?
---
And this is bad why?
---
Speed...... I.. am... Speeeeeeed
---
I think he would have the ability to crouch.
---
agreed. like a mori
---
Apply more map pressure
---
I totally fucking understand you (I chose dbd tho ;(
---
IKR LMAO
---
It was a joke lol
---
Best monster would be the scuba monster. Hands down.
---
Gonna complain if price is increased
---
It's a similar game made by bhvr
---
So trapper with extra steps
---
Should have been called Genny Dogs since we're on a Stranger Things theme XD Get it Genny Dogs/Demodogs? HAHAHA
---
I'm sure it will be the same price. They'll make a killing in selling sheer volume, so they likely won't rack up the price. That would just turn off the new players that will be coming to DBD specifically to try the Stranger Things DLC.
---
he is SO UGLY
---
Who TF wants Jason  , hes such a boring Killer in everything he has been in
---
If we don't get Scoops Ahoy we riot

**BERRY NICEU SHIIZA CHAN**

Well, I think this kinda came true due to the fact Trapper can look like a miner.

And that's a fact

Welcome to the fog dude.

Welp , I'ma still have 10 euros to spare for this dlc lol
---
Hard to see but thats hatch under me. Died to EGC because toxic survivors wouldn't just leave and had to Tbag at gate even tho killer wasn't around.
---
It‚Äôs pretty boring imo but to each their own.
---
new killer lookin top tier
---
Can you share some anti-tunnel/camping perks?
---
When you've played for more than 10h doing gens becomes incredibly boring.
---
YEAH I really HATE when someone TYPES like THAT
---
no, that's a section
---
sentence is a single cosmetic drop (like, one hair style)
---
You didn't do anything inherently wrong, just a really boring and uninteresting way to play. 
---
But trust me you'll get hatemail no matter how you play, so there's really no winning with that.
---
Strawmanning: distorting or misrepresenting someone's statement or argument in order to make a point or refute it.
---
Example, someone saying: " Nope never had a problem with it" and then someone deciding that means "it's a no for everyone" or him saying other people can't have issues with it.
---
The problem is that having a "problem" with the struggle mechanic is an opinion - if I said "yes, always had a problem with it" would I be invalidating people who disagreed, or just expressing my opinion?
---
You're assuming one person expressing their opinion means things it does not, and twisting his words to match, which is strawmanning the issue (a logical fallacy).
---
better yet corrupt intervention is on for once.
---
is it so hard to chop the white parts off?
---
Yea but if it‚Äôs so easy to do this then mirrors would be really easy
---
holy shit, i already have BBQ but Distortion and Corrupt Intervention is on the shrine?!
---
now the question is if i should grind my ass off again to get Corrupt Intervention early or just level Plague
---
either way this is the best shrine we had in weeks!
---
Plus another 10 for Steve‚Äôs ahoy skin right?‚Äô
---
Would be great if do but nah. It's Hori Tac Mouse + Keyboard, it emulates gamepad with different input. It has a left stick on the keyboard, but the mouse is instead of the right one. Because it only emulates analog input, it lacks precision and playing Huntress still feels crappy.

I wish I could turn into a board to play like this sometimes

The hitboxes are actually fairly consistent, they're just really dumb. The surv hitbox does not cover their arms, the huntress hatchet hitbox is a sphere etc.
---
It becomes really inconsistent when client desync hits, causing hits to falsely register/miss for no reason.
---
everybody gansta until afk myers hits tier 2
---
You‚Äôre making this way more complicated then it actually was.
---
He said he doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs stupid, as he hasn‚Äôt had issues.
---
I said that it‚Äôs not right to have a verdict on something using only his experiences, and being aware of the other issues. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs all there was to our exchange really.
---
Don't talk shit about Bubba. He's the second cutest killer
---
Megan.
---
You spin around in a circle, that's literally it. It's 30% timing, 30% the killer messing up, 30% false-hits and 10% on the mechanic itself. The camera turns or extra spins you see noob3 or someone else do are just extra to be fancy.

I have 50 Moris on my p3 Hag.  Im killing everyone, face camping, tunnelling, using Franklins.  All that.  Gotta give them the real DBD experience.
---
That's the spirit, welcome my friend (The Spirit puns incoming)
---
I am also looking forward to this DLC. Steve might actually be the reason for me to ever play survivor
---
i was literally gonna get him like 2 weeks ago and i was like ‚Äúnah i‚Äôm a jinx it WILL be in the shop as soon as i get him‚Äù. good thing i didn‚Äôt lol
---
I like this little bit of personality dwight has
---
Ok, then how do i exactly apply more map pressure without perks and without using nurse, billy, spirit or freddy? Because in that game i played as plague which has extremely bad mobility in comparison to the rest. When i'm playing as freddy I don't use noed at all (I use pop goes to weasel) because he has great map pressure thanks to his teleportation, and it can be used for mindgames. But what about plague? She doesn't have any of that.
---
As someone that loves playing as Bubba and loves the movie/lore of it, I‚Äôve been hoping this for SO. DAMN. LONG. IF they rework him, I‚Äôll probably shed tears.
---
Iron Will, Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick &amp; Quiet if you wanna vault and vanish
---
that feeling when i just bought jeff and leatherface literally two days ago :[
---
fr i killed 2 ppl in a game w legion on HADDONFEILD (worst fucking map with too many infinite‚Äôs) and refused to chase the teabagging kate who had balanced expecting me to run an infinite and actually went to go check gens. sure enough ppl are doing gens lmao. i hooked the kate before she wasn‚Äôt anything special but i refused to waste time on an infinite and she told me i sucked. i‚Äôm like okay and if i would have killed you you would have said the same thing?? because she teabagged and pointed the whole game anyways obviously she just wants to be toxic lol
---
No Mither is OP
---
it counters instadowns, no one has to heal you after the unhook, it also counters Legion and The Plague. You never waste time self caring in the corner and it makes your dead hard always active
---
what else do you want?
---
nipples like hag but have 2
---
iF yOu UsE nOeD tHeN uR BaD
---
Yeah, so, using Decesive Strike and Dead Hard means you are noob too, because you let killer find you and down you
---
for me i like spine chill, borrowed time, balanced landing, urban evasion/self care, dependent on how helpful i think my team is gonna be
---
I see god tier editing skills, I upvote

Regardless of the myopic detail of art being subjective a person has full autonomy to their own body. I see crap tattoos every day and I‚Äôm sure people look at my ink and think ewwww, but it‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt mind them at all because I know it‚Äôs my body and my choice.
---
Im definitely a killer main and I think we can all agree, that matchmaking in this game, for both sides, is a missunderstanding
---
This is so true
---
already got it time to rotate between 20 different bloodwebs before getting it
---
No joke u was thinking about this a few days ago, it‚Äôd be really great to see and there would be a tonne of potential!
---
That's exactly what I'm doing. I do get tired of seeing BBQ and ruin in every single game though
---
There have been so many good main menu of tracks. It would be good to get a little playlist going or at least choose what you want to hear. The year 3 music has all been garbage ruined by terrible voice lines throughout the instrumental.
---
I don't think I would ever get sick of season 1 main menu music or the Assassin's Creed event music
---
Oof
---
Guess in that case it would depend when they DC on the hook...if they make sure to use up all the available struggle time before DC then fine ...but if they simply give up on the hook and don't struggle or in essence utilize their full hook time ...or try to jump off the hook when survivors are nearby for a rescue they are often still screwing their teammates by not keeping the killer busy and giving him one more thing to worry about for as long as possible ...another bad one is DC when being carried...don't know how many times I've waited for a pick up to rescue a survivor and the guy DC during carry then killer was able to immediately come over and tunnel the unhooked guy.
---
*what*
---
Welcome to a place saltier than the Black Sea! Look around, get frustrated.
---
I'm gonna make a concept today for him. Add ons,ability and everything
---
It is a ghost face perk but I mean getting the teachable and using it on nurse
---
Same, and I also feel the same about the acronyms
---
tf is wrong with some of you people? I said i'd love to play as dustin but OBVIOUSLY come with complications, can you not read?
---
Its fine, was just confused,forgot teachables existed
---
Okay. Here it comes...
---
It's already released since 2016 tho
---
I've never seen Stranger Things so I can't say anything about it. I've just heard of critics saying it's mediocre.

---
Oh, corrupt intervention! Yes please!
---
delete this bro, the Killer mains are gonna see
---
:(. Did you at least do a clown mori and suck on my fingers?
---
i think the whole point of the hook realm is for survivors to not want to go there since there are no benefits from going into the upside down in the show and the characters hate going there and will only do so if absolutely necessary (i hope you see my point) and since the demogorgon will want to go there (due to the lack of a terror radius) when the survivor goes into it they will will indefinitely be put into danger
---
Dont use Night Shroud while in chase
---
Nah. No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity and Object of Obsession is the meta
---
Had this once as well. It lasted for like twice the amount yours lasted though :/
---
Oh snap!

For his power he will be like old Freddy but he doesn‚Äôt suck you into the dream world he sucks you into the upside down.

Iron maiden is sweet for huntress. I was gonna buy it but bought legion instead so I get discordance and the man boy/girl himself as well.
---
I run adrenaline, dead hard, iron will, resilience. Sometimes I swap out resilience and iron will for borrowed time and d-strike. I have a build on Kate with the lithe, dance with me, quick and quiet and iron will build and I'm fucking around with a build on Tapp with tenacity, flip flop, unbreakable and d-strike. Idea being that if I get smacked right after an unhook the killer can't slug or pick me up. I like having a few different builds to switch between to keep things interesting.
---
Probably the best looking model as far as accuracy to the actor. Ash is recognisable, but steve really looks just like a cartoon steve.

I'd down her anyway to show her that it's not working and MAYBE I'd leave her on the floor if she deserves it

Tbf I never mentioned powers or gameplay, just deals. You probably could pull of an us killer, with a character clone starting at you, with a power, idk, being incorporated into that.
---
No one:
---
Me seeing Mr. X: IT'S A FIST DADDY! 
---
Side note: I dont think Mr X would work tbh. He is around 7 feet tall, if not taller. Plus what would his power be? I think I'd prefer Albert Wesker as a killer and Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield.
---
Best jojo for the best perk.
---
:D
---
That's a hard...    maybe
---
Yea, NA East PS4 seems to always have quick killer ques, survivor varies sometimes pretty big bigly.
---
I played a few days ago after not playing for a few months, the lag was much better, no teleporting / rubberbanding all over
---
BHVR: #ITS NERF OR NOTHING
---
Lets just remove that little pest in the button left whose name we shall never say
---
Dude got my man Bucciarati in the background
---
I want Gordon Ramsey in DBD in any capacity. Make him say a voice line like Ashley and I will buy the shit out of him. It would be glorious.
---
I‚Äôll allow a ghostface selfie too
---
You can listen to dlc songs in the character select by picking the killer with the song you like. You just have to sit there in character select forever now.
---
The fuck is wrong with his neck?
---
Me trapper
---
Idk up to interpretation. Never mentioned powers tbf. I never finished resident evil 2 as Claire because mr x just comes in 10 mins in gameplay, I‚Äôm like nah I‚Äôm out. He‚Äôs honesty terrifying
---
This. Ive heard about the game in whispers but wasn't interested till one of my buddies told our group to download it and at first i didnt really like it, (I had only experienced kyf) 
---
But when i branched out, i really learned to love thus game and it's been amazing
---
Is corrupt intervention good? I already nabbed bbq and was either gonna get distortion or corrupt.....which one?
---
More like- Isn‚Äôt alexi :(
---
the game is fun, just know that killers and survivors both have loud idiots shouting abuse at each other on the reg so its probably in your best interest to not grow attached to the community and just get you a few friends to play with. Welcome &lt;3
---
How did you get the golden perks?
---
Goobel gobble gooble gobbel
---
*infinite tombstone Myers pops tier 3*
---
I have finally tamed the sun...
---
That's a nice idea!
---
Now I really want SafeHead after Demogorgon lol
---
What? I'm on PS4 and it still takes me a while to find a killer match. SWF with just one friend takes ages sometimes thought
---
I second this motion.
---
I KNOW! I literally spent an hour in the Chief's office not wanting to leave my safe space. 
---
But more on Albert, if you dont know who he is; he's a villain in most of the RE games but does die. Won't say how or what game. He injected himself with two viruses that made him super fast, and super strong. I feel his power would be a mix between Legion and Wraith. He can move at top speed, but has a cooldown, and cant hit survivors for x amount of time. 
---
Another side note; what did you play RE2 on?
---
Your comedy needs more attention lmao
---
Holy shit imagine the screeching terror jumping out of a whole right at you, that shit would be insane.
---
This happened to me before
---
How did you go from ground to full health?
---
I've been grinding like crazy, I have always felt less of a killer cause everyone had BBQ but me, but I could be cool and fit in with the popular kids.
---
dbd is highly rewarding if you focus on one killer or survivor so if you like doc then focus on him (and please dont camp im not saying you will but a lot of noobs do it so please dont there are much more efficient ways to deal with them)
---
That's what I was hoping, that he can drag them into the upside down where he gets faster and can execute survivors once they're downed, effectively making hooks useless for demogorgon, as they should be.
---
Lmao my boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand the game but tried to give me a pick-up Line.
---
He told me I can cleanse his totem ü•µ
---
Idc about ‚Äúannoying‚Äù i‚Äôm not a 4fun casual i‚Äôm trying to get a good perk thats been denied from the shrine since release despite new perks getting to the shrine
---
Why is that even a rule anyway? Just because we havent had a nonhuman before?
---
The rule was actually "Only Humanoid" and Demogorgon is one
---
r/petthedamncrow
---
There's also "DEAD"
---
You have to think about changing those too
---
Shoot, you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs been forever since I‚Äôve bled out.
---
I‚Äôm transsexual
---
There‚Äôs a Freddy one as well if ya didn‚Äôt know.
---
I'd just like to take a second to appreciate the fact that not a single soul batted an eyelash at the thought of nurse being broken. I feel like that says something.
---
The bones of every woman who dares to touch my boyfriend.
---
Hope dedicated servers kills this shit.
---
Orisa: \*pulls sigma into the well\*

Definitely no mither, iron will, resilience, and dead hard. You‚Äôre literally invisible just make sure you‚Äôre playing Claudette or else it won‚Äôt work.
---
Hold up. What? I have no recollection of this üßê
---
Play survivor at all and you‚Äôll find it isn‚Äôt fun sitting there for 120 seconds. That‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs just very unfun, and if you don‚Äôt care what survivors think, then you really shouldn‚Äôt care if you get hate for doing that.
---
Just another reason why Michael is the best killer ‚ô•Ô∏è This was cute üòÅ
---
No one give a fuck about Dwight. 
---
Kill all Dwights, prptect baby Steve.
---
It took me about 6-7 hours in total
---
happy cake day
---
Wait.... I'm confused. Who is going where and why?
---
I assume Freddie is going higher because of the new changes, but why would the nurse be lowered?
---
No difference at that point everyone knows or everyone doesn‚Äôt plus spirit isn‚Äôt op and prayer beads are not that bad to deal with
---
Who needs roses when your face is a flower?
---
Clown's theme all the time &lt;3 His theme music is actually OP.
---
Distortion actually tells you the perks the killer has though. Once I know he has bbq, I hide in lockers, once I know he has nurses calling I stop healing near him. Its a must have, if you're hiding in lockers everytime and they don't have bbq you're wasting a lot of time.
---
Everyone escaped and u just get unhooked cause your BT is running out that means u just didnt ran straight to exit gate u should just follow your teammates i guess maybe tank one hit with BT for free sprint burst.(sorry for bad language)
---
I didn't say Spirit is OP, I said Prayer Beads are unfair ;)
---
Jeff
---
Welcome! We are really glad that new people will join the game now that Stranger Things is coming to Dead by Daylight. Feel free to ask anything!
---
P.S: Ignore toxic people and just have fun playing your way!
---
Wait what? Not very toxic? I get messages about every game (on Xbox btw so people manually have to take a few minutes to type something) for literally doing nothing wrong. I thought this community was supposed to be overly toxic.
---
People will flame you for anything. My messages are filled with angry survivors.
---
Just try to tone down on camping. There are situations that call for it, just recognize there situations and leave if it doesnt call for it.
---
&gt; Always jumping in lockers, never healing near killer 
---
I told you already that I don't give a fuck about BBQ
---
&gt; never healing near killer 
---
Correction, I almost never heal at all. Adrenaline is the only heal I need
---
&gt; never working on a gen with someone else... 
---
I do it when it's needed, but working on a gen together is the least efficient thing you can do. Not only you both work at 90% of the speed, you'll also both have to run if the killer comes near, doubling their pressure. Discordance punishes bad decision making.
---
A chapter is a DLC that includes a killer, Leatherface is a chapter (according to the official DBD website under Chapters) and Ghostface is a chapter, while Bill and Ash are paragraphs.
---
Wiggling is stupid as well. You almost get out but due to the hook vacuum you dont. You should also get bloodpoints for it as well.
---
Franklin demise:
---
#No
---
So.....BBQ FINALLY on the shrine. Seems the devs had a bit of a.... Wake Up!?
---
I love how this gets downvoted just because people don't like tunneling even when in some cases it's good play for Killer.
---
I took a break from dbd. Im coming back to main steve
---
I hope I never have to play with you lol. Imagine 1 gen left and you refusing to help incase of discordance. Never jumping into lockers so always having to leave half done gens cos killer has charged over with bbq. Never healing team mates. My kinda hell
---
Okay, i'll be honest. 
---
I LOVE THE IDEA, WE NEED IT ON THE GAME RIGHT NOW
---
DS and borrowed time
---
I don't care how BHVR calls it. LF is a paragraph on the wiki and people were calling Ghost Face a paragraph too.
---
*GOT US A DRONE, HEAD ON*
---
Hahah this is awesome!
---
You'll never reach the Clown.
---
The terror radius is captain sparkles song
---
&gt;If you hold sprint you can stop the heal and move. But any skillchecks will be interrupted, making a noise for the killer.
---
&gt;This works when crawling too.
---
Wait, this is how you do that? Does it work if you tap it while holding a movement key? Or do you need to hold it for a second?
---
My guess at the power. The demogorgon can open portals into the upside down.
---
 While in the upside down the demogorgon can move stupid fast, cannot be seen and has no terror radius and cannot see survivors. Maybe nearby lights also flicker like in ST. 
---
The demogorgon can then open another portal to leave the upside down. 
---
Opening a new portal takes longer than going through an existing one but survivors can close portals by interacting with them.
---
Maybe the demogorgon had limited portals at once like hag traps so you have to position them carefully to maximise your map presence.
---
I'd hope there would also be an in chase power such as a dash or leap of some kind.
---
For r6, it's normal. If you hate ch. 13 then idk what to say. Have you watched stranger things?
---
SO you don't care what the developers call their content, and it is the community that decides that the DLC is?
---
This is gonna get gud.
---
You combined three of my favourite things! The Office, Michael Myers, and Dead by Daylight ü§©
---
It's the other way around for me. I took a break from dbd.
---
I'm kinda mad that I now have to avoid the sub like the plague until I'm done with part 3 of Stranger Things :(
---
My memes are getting shared? Omg!
---
Pennywise is a shapeshifting god and Clown's more like Michael Myers, he's a slasher killer.
---
&gt; I do it when it's needed 
---
You struggle to read what I say or just want to argue with me lol. poping adrenaline is the most important thing in my book. dealing with NOED is the second most important
---
&gt; Never jumping into lockers so always having to leave half done gens cos killer has charged over with bbq.  
---
and take them away so no one else is pressured. I also run bond to make the most efficient plays
---
&gt; Never healing team mates. 
---
I do it when they come to me asking for it, but when they don't ask for it, I'd rather do the gen
---
Also, apparently Ashs DLC is also considered a chapter on the official website, so the only paragraph we have is Bill.
---
Yeah, we call killers dickheads and survivors shitheads.
---
What are the best survivor perks for escaping or creating some space between yourself and a killer during a chase?
---
It‚Äôs beautiful!
---
For real, there will be a lot of people who start playing or just following the game because of this.
---
Welcome! Please don't be discouraged it's a great community!
---
I didn't expect to do well, but I also didn't expect to be bullied to death tbh.
---
I'd love more unconventional additions like Tomie, I know she's in Identity V but I'd love for them to add Tomie as killer and Suichi as survivor. I'd also love a Michonne from The Walking Dead as a paragraph. Shuya from Battle Royale and Tak from the cult classic Versus would be bad ass too.
---
I dont. No mither is shit
---
Welcome ,the game is hard in the beginning ,but as long as you dont care about ranks,you'll have a lot of fun,hope to see ya in the fog soon
---
And since you don‚Äôt believe I made it, check my profile, posted it 5 days ago with me explain how it took an hour to make because I had to idea what I was doing
---
Dead Hard and slippery meat. Classic perk combo
---
You‚Äôre right, quick, delete! On a serious note it is a bad taste because I‚Äôm disregarding most of what they said to say something kind of unrelated. It would be better if this post was more popular, so pro tip, don‚Äôt post at night; especially on week days.
---
He credited you I‚Äôm sorry that I didn‚Äôt see it
---
I believe you mean... Wake up?

i have the pig head one that makes them heal slower lol, addons and perks are a lot to take in

Aww.. on my side it shows 67 tho
---
So I‚Äôve been away on holiday for almost 2 weeks straight (I was home for 1 day in the middle) so I‚Äôve missed all of TI9 (Dota 2) up to now, all the R6 news, and all of the DBD news

I‚Äôve got a lot of catchup to do

Having to play Nurse on console...

Is this Blades? How is it?

That film is dog poop.

Pig is the best for it, because she doesn;t need to swing twice and does it extremely fast.

Go into Settings, then Account Management, the select Restore Licences. That should sort it out.

Yeheah bwoi!

What is a good perk combo for spirit with bbq and haunted grounds?
---
I;m just sharing my idea, Reddit is just for it, same with flair suggestion O.o If you don;t like suggestions don't read them lol
---
Well The Nurse ignores most mechanics survivors have to combat killers and The Spirit is just really unfun to play against because of how quickly she can end a chase.
---
He made a guide on looping tho, it's made for killers but I think it also helps survivors
---
Insidious Killer lol

No you're right, one time only. However, people who skipped the tutorial can still get the BP even after 100000 hours

HA!
---
As if a Killer with great mobility AND AN INFINITE USE INSTA-DOWN is balanced.
---
Honestly, all he needs is a 110% movement speed.
---
Probably will since around when Ghostface came out there was a sale so there's no reason for them not to do it.
---
at night? it's 10am!
---
America is not the only place on earth ya know
---
Ah Thank you :)
---
Don't let no one influence your choice.
---
Most people complain about things that are not necessarily true. A lot of it really has to do with the build you're using being weak against certain killers. With so many options available, there's plenty of ways of countering. 
---
While sometimes the odds are against you, that doesn't necessarily mean you should lose hope. It basically means to adapt, and overcome those odds. It can be brutal, but that's what a challenge is. Surving the odds is a better feeling then their being no challenge. At least for me.
---
Isn't it convenient the perk that counters bbq is right next to it coincidence? I think not! They are trying to show there is a huge counter to bbq right in everyone's faces
---
Yeah I suppose, they don‚Äôt ban you for it though
---
Nurse is equiped with the power that lets her simply obliterate everything she sees if she's good enough (and it doesn't take as much skill, really. You'll get good after one play session
---
Spirit isn't fun to play against on top of being very strong
---
Those 2 killers are hard to counter but not impossible.  You will only have a bad time against them when you‚Äôre getting into the red ranks. If you‚Äôre new don‚Äôt worry about nurse or spirit :) 
---
In my opinion the real killer for new players is Myers xD he‚Äôs the real terror against newbies :P
---
WHERES THE SURVIVOR SAUCE?!?!?!?!
---
Don't listen to anybody play the way you want unless you facecamp that is really damaging to playing as killer
---
No because the closest one will despawn. You can place 2 portals at 1 spot tho.
---
 Techinichan, Spine Chill, Prove Thyself, No Mither
---
Same experience on Xbox. If I do well as the killer I get hate mail. If I do poorly as the killer I get hate mail.  :  /
---
Wait a few seconds. Nod like a madman and do some pointing. Then you can commence crouching. I don't think of crouching as always negative.
---
They're killers, but all they do is walk around and survivors injure themselves doing actions like vaulting or gens.
---
That's up to us as a community. We need to fight against toxicity in general. If I play with friends and they hassle the solo or killer, I tell them to knock that shit off, I do it even with strangers. I main killer so I only see SWF tell their friends to chill every once in a blue moon. Especially the racism, we need to call that shit out. The devs are not going to ban anyone, they hardly ever take action so we need to have each others' backs. That's just the way it is.   
---
Hell, I go as far as to lose on purpose sometimes when I go against noobies then congratulate them when they win. I want more people to get into the game. I hate having no one to talk about DBD with.
---
There's a good chance. A lot of things tend to go on sale, except for anything that's new.
---
*sips blood of the innocents*
---
"0w0 what's dis oh... Bloody hell wtf"
---
Reboot Jason is absolutely involved with the lawsuit. Just because it‚Äôs a reboot doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôs still Friday the 13th and it‚Äôs still Jason. Best they could do is make a generic hockey mask killer not named Jason..... but that‚Äôs already Trapper.
---
They use ET time, because that's where their company is located
---
Me. I got him to 35 over the weekend
---
I've always been a fan of having more variations.  Go-under spots, single use (ie instabreak) pull downs, non-locker hiding spots (hay bales), using fire barrels as a pull down, and route changing pull downs that either survivor or killer can tag (say log piles that can be pulled down that permanently block a path to both sides afterwards).  
---
Considering BHVR can't even add a meaningful second objective to break up the monotony of gens, though, I would hold my breath.
---
I do too. Since you know..... NO EYES
---
Tommy Jarvis features in three movies and is considered as the 'main' protagonist I suppose. The final girl from the first film (Alice?) briefly appears in part two but yeah, there isn't particularly much consistency between characters.
---
Enjoy your stay, mate :D
---
I literally got Leatherface to level 35 yesterday, BHVR why
---
That skin is going to be available for purchase for pretty much the rest of the game's lifetime. The perk is only available for purchase with shards until next week and who knows when it'll be available again (this is the 3rd time in like 2 years). 2000 shards isn't a lot for most skins and doesn't take long to get
---
She's getting some "attention" from the devs shortly.
---
No Mither, Self Care,  Left Behind and Adrenaline then complain in post game chat that 2 of your perks were bugged
---
He could have voice lines in game so that he can yell at the killer and stun them for 3 seconds
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs 5 there now, so I don‚Äôt know, are games popular near where they‚Äôre made?
---
It was on sale in the Steam Summer Sale.
---
If you're on PS4 and in Europe/UK, it's on sale until midnight.
---
You are a pussy if you disconnect against nurse or spirit its just a killer where is is actually possible get a 4k. So yes they are better then the rest of the roster but you can still survive against them.
---
hold sprint, 1 or 2 to do any gesture and you are out
---
It's a rule because devs did not want to have to deal with skeleton and rigging for non-humanoid shapes.
---
I know that, I don't want to learn nurse though
---
80 is underestimating I think
---
Maybe they‚Äôre too old? Who knows really.
---
I'm not sure about playing with friends advise. If said friends are high rank players, then they will force a newbie to face rank 15+ killers who a more or less competent, instead of rank 20 potato killers. I really think that a brand new players should start learning the game alone and play against players of their skill level.
---
I'm one of the people who actually enjoy playing Bubba, so I didn't mind tbh.
---
while Laurie is the only surv worth getting, having everything is neat. Your choice on that.
---
Spirit, Freddy and Hag are strong. Ghost Face isn't top-tier, but he's fun to play as.
---
Bbq is a killer perk that allows you to see the auras of survivors at least 48m away from you after hooking someone (also grants bp) this perk let's you know where to go for survivors and possibly generators. Great way to get info.
---
Corrupt intervention is a killer perk that blocks off the farthest generators for 80 seconds. This forces the survivors closer to you, shortens the area you need to check, and is a good counter to gen rushing, ppl getting generators done extremely quick.
---
Distortion is a survivor perk that has 3 tokens (indicated in game as a number in the perk icon). If a killer has a perk that allows you to see your aura (like bbq) a token will be used up and your aura will be invisible for 6 seconds.
---
Wake Up is known for being one of the highest rated perks in the game. It's commonly listed as an S tier perk. The way this survivor perk shakes up the game is almost unfathomable. When it first got added to the game it had to be nerfed almost 10 times as the community was deeply affected by this addition. The perk grants you the power to open exit gates 5% faster.
---
Truly a god send
---
I play for 9-12 hours a day. Am currently unemployed so y'know.
---
No mither with self care, solidarity and OoO is the best perk build
---
You‚Äôre gonna have fun against Myers
---
Ok thanks guys
---
I expect behavior to screw it up and pull a freddy/hag move..  Demigorgon lays traps around the map that pulls survivors into a mirror world where the demigorgon hunts.  Survivors not in the mirror world can reach in and try to pull a trapped survivor out.  Traps take 8 seconds to plant, and are destroyed by flashlights.  Demigorgon cant injure survivors not in mirror world but can use a power to see survivors to know where to plant his traps.
---
Ptb proves Demigorgon is new worst killer so they nerf him with stranger things terror radius that survivors can hear while outside the mirrored world. Chapter goes live for 12.99 and everyone looses their mind on how bad the killer is and how expensive it is.  But the dlc becomes a steam top sellers for the next 3 weeks because everyone wants to play as Steve and there are two broken op survivor perks split between the two survivors.
---
Why did i think of dwight eating janes nails
---
I like to fight back but also hide whenni need to so Head on, Quick and quiet, decisive strike, iron will
---
Why does jane looks so calm, its like she doesnt even care about being in the entity realm.
---
Not older than billy? Also probably just alightly older than Jane
---
Third time from the moment of the release of shards...Btw the easiest way to get shards is to play the game, but don't make it last more than 10 minutes. The best way (not the most enjoyable for both killer and survivor) is to play wraith, go to an exit gate and wait until all the gens are done. Then open the door and let everyone escape. It shouldn't last more than 10 minutes and you'll probably depip, but that's it.
---
I bring you bottle Champaign....it empty tho
---
Boil Over, Empathy, Quick and Quiet, Lithe.
---
I honestly think that iron will should be integrated into no mither
---
Not yet
---
The demogorgon is now Light born V2
---
Idk
---
The steam page for the dlc
---
and you would get spotted from across the map if you wear them
---
Dog walker billy can‚Äôt hurt you.
---
He‚Äôs not real.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not that challenging to get to a mill. Best way is playing killer and if you have bbq even better, it‚Äôll take a couple of hours of play :)
---
This has got to be the dumbest thing I've read today. You were new once too, new players means a larger playerbase which is also good. You want good survivors/killers? Then the new players have to learn the ropes and become good, they don't do that by getting bullied by sweaty players, they just get frustration.
---
Play a lot but with SURVIVORS. Be a little coward and hide around, don't take risks, you get xp based on time, it caps out at 10 mins per match.
---
It‚Äôs this mentality that causes games to die.
---
wow, you're not only a jackass but a homophobic piece of shit as well
---
if you do get the game, map knowledge is huge especially as a survivor. knowing where pallets might spawn so you can drop them, also don't waste the god pallet plz
---
Exactly
---
The developer said on a post that the fact that a flashlight is shining in their direction makes them want to recoil in disgust
---
Can I run Search party on Piggy?
---
*POST* *NUT*
---
1. Story mode
---
2. 1 killer and 3 survivors vs 1 killer and 3 survivors mode.
---
3. Killer vs killer vs killer vs killer vs survivor mode
---
As far as I'm aware Robert Eungland owns the character likeness to his Freddy. If I remember correctly Will Craven signed it over to him in part payment for the first movie (when it was a low budget non-franchise).
---
But there is some kind of dispute between him &amp; the current rights holders and I don't think they would want his likeness being used for the character if they are trying to move away from it.  All this stuff becomes a legal minefield really.
---
that is literally me, did the exact same thing
---
get rekt lol
---
Hi gay, I'm dad.
---
Nice bait
---
no
---
hmm...i still see it being abused a bit.
---
what do you mean
---
Come for the bloodpoints, stay because killer is fun when swf groups aren't bullying you.
---
https://youtu.be/ztxEHtrgTRg
---
Stop getting trolled so easily y'all
---
Yes I agree! Going against Myers was more scary than first seeing a Nurse. I didn't take a look at any of the non-base game killers perks or abilities at first because I didn't know I would be playing with/against players who did have the DLC's I didn't (my bad, haha) but for some reason seeing him randomly off to the side staring was more of a spook than seeing a nurse blink and slash me for the first time.
---
Also Blood Warden if you have stacks come in end game.
---
Well before this gets removed, I just wanna say that we all were new at one point, and we all sucked at one point. De-Ranking to Rank 16 to bully new players isn't gotta weed out the weak. It's just gonna turn away players, that with a bit more practice, they could've been great at Dead by Daylight.
---
Only for an additional 9.99$
---
I don‚Äôt want DLC, I want an entire game based around the SD universe made in the concept of DBD.
---
It would sell millions.
---
It kind of suck because killer usually doesn't pick you up if youre lauire because 9/10 you hsve DS
---
The LeGone
---
Shut up, Heather
---
Because you're a bit thick.
---
the problem is i want to ruin their experience
---
get yourself some friends and you're all good. Or just play killer. Or play survivor but get ready to feel frustrated at first.
---
if Netflix lets them make cosmetics,  
---
something like Mud Medusa Hag's red skin effect would be cool
---
I bet you're shite at this game. 16 is probably just your level.
---
this is not a troll
---
i hate new players
---
Killer abilitys IMO need a reason why the survivors can't use them whether its because billy has the only chainsaw on the map or because the killers have special powers, why can't the survivor use the mineshafts that are apparently in every closet?. The miners helmet is neat though
---
 Be mine seems alright but increased terror radius isn't much of a drawback unless you super tunnel him early.
---
Choo-choo should probably scale to 50/75/100% at level 3, hit a gen not being worked on and have a cooldown, assuming its not already planned to have one otherwise your just gonna lowroll it every game and have a worthless perk or highroll it to the point that you may as well just have the level 1 version cause 20% big enough to matter.
---
nyctophobia makes zero sense, why would they scream? The killer isn't doing anything like the doctor and they wouldn't scream outside of the miner being the killer(outside of it being teachable). Not that good of a perk anyway cause if your crouching and standing still your not gonna be there for 15 seconds outside of edge cases. Better off making it something else
---
Sure bud
---
I would have Clown music for everyone, even survivors.

I guess she wants da bone

he's playing wraith so that's going to happen often...

you might think he's exaggerating, but i'm not surprised.

i bought bloodhound a two weeks ago when it was available,

and i gained them back in less than a week.

mind you, i only play three times a day at most because of my schedule.

good luck-

I have Bubba but I'm too lazy to level any killer up so....

No alert perks work against tier 1 Myers, who ever told you spine chill does is lying.

Aww thanks!

I have watched a good amount of episodes. I just don't really like it cause it was boring. Was pretty much forced to by my sister.
---
In the show hes sensitive to light so doubtful
---
I unlocked BBQ 5 months ago and still hasn't shown up in my Huntress bloodweb. So sad
---
Thank you üò≠üíô I want to make them all!
---

Some killers are anti stealth or even perks combat it. I feel like stealth loses its edge fairly quickly but ScottJund has a looping guide that‚Äôs helpful for [killers](https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ)  which is still some good advice for survivor
---
:3
---
I didnt know you could do this!!
---
Ahhhh, thank you! This was really helpful! üòä
---
She wants you! ... dead :3
---
I just bought leatherboi and got the perk a week ago. Feelsbadman
---
I find it kinda sad, he's one of the most iconic killers and the only reason people are buying his DLC is for just one perk.
---
To answer your first question on why they cant use the hidden entrances is simple. Why dont they use the hatchets that are located in every closet, also its hidden and yes the entity could easily block them.
---
Choo-Choo with a 100% would be too overpowered. Imagine kicking a gen and another gen gets affected by overcharge or something similar. It would simply be a little bit too god.
---
Also nyctophobia translates to fear of the dark. And it was made for those survivors who hide in lockers or in dark corners so the killers can barely see them. The idea is that the perk induces them with nyctophobia and they scream when they stay in that one are for too long
---
In China we often call The pig as Â∞èÁå™‰Ω©Â•á(peppa pig)
---
I think part of it is because if you can grind the shards and bloodpoints for Plague, you can get Corrupt any time. Bbq requires actual money for the DLC if it‚Äôs not in the shrine.
---
Scoops ahoy and the ball dress. I need those.
---
That happened to me several times against the Huntress yesterday. Her hatches were like 1 to 2 metres to my side and were knocking me down.
---
Bitch, those bastrds lied to me
---
Still no new guns
---
i had the same problem for my first months of the game, and i send an email to them about it after a while.  
---
they said it was a known bug and they're trying to fix it.  
---
and it's fixed for me now, though rarely it does still happen ( not much of a big deal. )  
---
it sucks, but you'll have to be patient
---
Ghost Face
---
I did mine with about 100 hours of playing.
---
ARE YOU FUCKING INSANE?
---
This dlc got leaked weeks ago
---
I'm not too sure about that.  What if the closest server is a far off from your location.  Killer or survivor, wouldn't you have bad ping regardless because of sheer distance?
---
Tbagging and emotes I can live with but I'd really like some kind of fix for noise notification spam. I.e. you're not chasing the survivor that wants to be chased so they throw down a pallet on the opposite side of the map and jump back and forth over it 2 million times. Actually gives me a headache and obv can't just turn sound off.
---
Spirit.
---
They are still there for you. Go into the help and do them. Free BP for a couple of minutes.
---
When I'm dodging hatchets. When I'm trying to stealth around a killer.
---
Solid point. I didn't think of that.
---
Good point. I suppose more leeway is needed then, but still there s a margin. I ll edit it to be more generic.
---
Hallowed Blight had best music for me.
---
Or just...you know be happy with what we got cause this looks like a really good chapter?
---
She is the last dragon
---
&gt; Right now, the SWF goes off the lowest person‚Äôs rank. 
---
Then high ranked survivors will bully rank 20 newbie killer. Either way someone's experience is going to be ruined.
---
I.. *am* happy with what we‚Äôve got?
---
I was literally just proposing a solution to those that really wanted to see other characters in the chapter, is that so bad? In no way did I whine about not having them in this post whatsoever.
---
Personally I dont care to much about that because I never watched the show but I can see the point on character popularity. Also I agree with the balancing part to, having more than 9 perks all at once (6 from survivor) then it could shake things a little to much, especially if they are good perks. Not that good perks are bad but if they make to many then testing with them could take a bit longer and they have to worry about how they interact with other perks and the killers.
---
What if location of the killer is so far from locations of other survivors you can't get below 150 ping and you can never actually get a lobby? In P2P one person with bad connection ruins an entire lobby but in dedicated server it's each man for themselves. It's not a perfect solution but P2P is simply not something that's made thinking of online gaming
---
If the possibility of BM sets you off and makes you not want to play, in all honesty, that‚Äôs an issue with you and not the game. 
---
If a Survivor BMs you for the sake of it but they are actually trash then own them and make them learn. If they are better than you and BM due to outplaying you then it is what it is... that happens in a lot of games. 
---
I used to be a Survivor main and switched to Killer due to the BP disparity and getting trash teammates even at red ranks. I never BM because what‚Äôs the point?... But i‚Äôve had it happen to me by really good players and I just brush it off as them trying to get across that they are better than me, rather than showing it by just continuing to playing the game well. 
---
Also, at the end of the day BMing does not physically prevent a player from playing aspects of the game, whereas a face camping Killer, namely Bubba, literally ruins the game for each Survivor they catch. As does proxy camping and tunnelling someone off the hook, yet the answer to those issues seems to always be ‚Äúrush gens and leave‚Äù which is a much worse scenario for those involved when compared to someone making their character crouch up and down and few times. Hell, most Ghostfaces‚Äô i‚Äôve gone up against teabag like mad now too.
---
That‚Äôs mainly what I was thinking, yeah. Adding so many new perks all at once would just be a nightmare to handle in terms of bug-testing and balancing.
---
How long was the matchüò≥
---
I wasn't reffering to you necesarilly but ok...and it's an ok idea...but it will never happen.
---
This was a great read, thank you people.
---
Uhm yeah, you can buy Spirit anytime but BBQ is only in the shrine for a week now
---
I love this game so much
---
The two plant monsters get to eat people together. How romantic. Good for the hag though. She gets little love from the developers and never really gets any good cosmetics. At least now she has a popular ship from the community. Congrats Lisa
---
Yea just play and get the points back...bbq is a good perk it's worth.
---
Ok calm down son, no reason insulting people over the internet.
---
It's only humanoid.
---
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be my teammate!  And the other 2 default Dwight‚Äôs fucking up simple skillchecks will be my teammates too!!
---
Are you from noob3 streams?
---
I mean, your comment sounded like it was referring to me with the whole ‚Äúor you could be happy with what we‚Äôve got‚Äù thing.
---
The only BMing I generally hate is where players hold the game hostage and really that can easily be fixed with a few changes from the developer standpoint. Its gotten better with the collapse forcing survivors out the door but killers can also do it but slugging the last person alive for two minutes now.
---
It's definitely my issue, but I can't be the only one.  I also agree that killer BM is just as bad and would love to see it gone. Only, hard-coding it out of the game would be far trickier, and I'm sure BE won't go such lengths if they won't fix simpler things first.
---
Knew I forgot one
---
dude that's sick!
---
death is not an escape
---
Spirit fury enduring is always good
---
Meh...sorry about that bro should have said "ppl could be happy" or smth.
---
We want new players. It's good for the game.
---
The game is pretty nuanced so it will take practice.
---
Ok, thanks
---
Lmao baby survivor get camped on noob xd
---
Sloppy butcher only applies to her swing and not her throwables
---
getting shards gets easier and easier as your account level keeps rising. BBQ and chili is an amazing perk attached to a turd of a DLC killer. Get it now while the gettings good. Get spirit a bit later. Sure shes a great killer with good perks but BBQ and chili beats pretty much all other priorties for anyone interested in playing killer at all.
---
Make sure to play a game of each every day at least.
---
That 300 points for FGOTD as Survivor or Killer adds up, and is basically a free level when all is said and done.
---
You're right. Keep forgetting they split them.
---
Tbf BBQ is really the only reason disstortion is even considered an ok perk, and even then i often find myself close enough to another teammate who had their aura revealed,so the killer still comes to my general direction anyways.
---
I sooo badly want search party
---
That's pretty cool.
---
I think this killed several of my braincells.
---
I was thinking more of the general design of Englund‚Äôs Freddy, not his actual likeness.
---
i think it looks brighter, maybe so people can see whats going on better.
---
The big change they should make to the pig is only have her roar after charging her dash, instead of roaring while she charges the dash. She could be scary then.
---
Enduring is a billy perk right? I'm a survivor main but I want to play killer some more.
---
Totally worth it. BBQ is so good for grinding bloodpoints, and you‚Äôll get more shards while you level up other killers.
---
[Thankfully not. I‚Äôm pretty sure I have the shards for it as well](https://pics.me.me/a-surprise-to-be-sure-but-a-welcome-one-18706661.png)

While i do believe it's not  random i also don't wanna jump on the conspiracy train like others and say all perks are cherry picked. I would say they have control over it but do let it be random a lot of times, but with lower valued perks having a higher chance of showing (this would just be smart business since you wanna sell dlc,so i'm not gonna raise a pitchfork at them).
---
I got him 4 days ago and I'm hoping steam might give me a refund, I still have hope. But worse case scenario I can still play him with PWYF and Fugitive chase
---
And making BUBBA move at mak 9 speeds
---
The concept is nice, but rng powers are never fun to play against. Plus, take a look on how BHVR writes perks. Following their convention and using some perk images would really spice this up!
---
That would save some time

Oh yeahh!!

What are the op perks ?

Isn't Ethan's face never seen in game? It'd have to be Mia or Zoe
---
&gt; killers get more BP on average than survivors
---
Do they, though? "On average each match" is not the same as "on average over time". A survivor could potentially play two matches in the time it takes a killer to play a single one, as a killer will always be the last player to leave a trial.
---
&gt; Why is it that the best way to farm BP to level characters is to use BBQ and Chili rank 3 as a killer?
---
I wouldn't say it's the "best" way, but the logic behind it is that Barbecue &amp; Chilli affects your postgame score, raising the cap on earned BP. That's why it and We're Gonna Live Forever are so favoured for BP farming - although there's no doubt that getting safe unhooks and protection hits is a trickier task than simply getting a hook.
---
As for "incentives", you're trying to counter the fact that it's just a lot easier for solo players to play killer than it is for solo players to play survivor. Killer doesn't have to worry about their team's competence, they don't have to worry about getting sandbagged or having someone kite the killer directly to them. I would argue that there's no reasonable incentive that can be applied to force people to deal with that - and that's why SWF is popular, and why improved communication is a dev goal. Survivors working together will have a far easier time getting their BP than running around solo - and if you prefer to play solo, then that's arguably what killer is for.
---
These are the thoughts I get at 2AM. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Thank you!

Me: Leaves survivor on the ground so I am not tunneling.
---
Survivors: "Slugging tryhard."
---
Yeah, the grind is outrageous
---
Of course it appears when my PS4 can run dvd anymore kms
---
Actually no....Prove Thyself just makes you get BP a bit faster, making it easier to max a category. We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever is the only perk that gives extra BP on survivors
---
If you look in the mirror I think, don‚Äôt quote me on that, you can see his face. Otherwise yeah. Idk
---
Or give the Killer a reason to *always* leave the hook
---
Just make sure you know that everyone is bad in the beginning and that there's nothing wrong being bad at videogames (500h and still play really bad sometimes xD) so don't let toxicity take away your fun
---
I thought u were complaining about bbq stacks ur build doesn‚Äôt even have it.
---
Nurse and spirit superb in chases but pretty weak against stealth play btw. Iron will can help a lot against them. You cannot predict what killer you will be against but its good perk overall. Bout your build lithe and balanced both exhaustion perks. People usually do not run more that one such a perk. But balanced have a passive effect so more power to you i guess.
---
"Lol i dc so you dont get points. HAHAHA I WIN YOU LOSE. REEEEEE--" every toxic survivor main.
---
Trick to spirit is the same as nurse, break line of sight then execute a good escape plan.
---
Iron will and dance with me are both great anti spirit perks, which also do great against most every other killer. Throw in lithe and quick and quiet, both great perks, and you can straight up vanish on most killers.
---
If you dont want to counter her with perks, you're going to have to play to her weaknesses. Unless add-on'd, she cant see blood while ghosting. Walk when you know or think shes haunting. 
---
And for the love of the entity, dont try to mend game a spirit. You will lose a very high % of the time.
---
Yeah 1 person, but Michael can kill multiple people a lot faster.
---
the higher your level the more shards you get per level. I guess it kind of evens out since I assume the exp required goes up but I still make 2000 shards easy between shrine updates.
---
I have chat and other messaging turned off, so as far as I know they're all screaming into the void.
---
As for "certain days", I'd argue that every day there has to be a particularly nasty player online. That's just probability at work.
---
Everyone has their own limit on what they can take, doesn't mean you ever need to have that limit tested. Turn off the chat, play the game, and enjoy playing it.
---
It gon b ok lil' lady.

The power / perks / add-ons grant ability to make survivors injure and kill themselves üòÇ
---
Must have been a sad Plaggy after that, big F for her
---
She's so cute she'll even slay your nightmares for you üòç
---
Low Stamina shouldn't cause exhaustion for 10 seconds and decreases the vault speed too much
---
they all should have a max amount of "stacks" so they don't go infinite
---
other than that, hexes that you have to stack up aren't too bad for the game, as they can be destroyed before they get good

---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctfnoy/wheeze/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Not another nurse. We really don't need another killer that ignores one of the only ways to survive in a chase.
---
Yes, but if they've already closed the hatch then they cannot open the gates.
---
Some killers will carry survivors to the gate (for many reasons - a good game, they like your cosmetic, you didn't wiggle as the last survivor, they're in a good mood, etc.) and keep dropping them and picking them up so that they eventually wiggle off. If they smack the gate then it generally means they're letting you go, because they can't open the gate after closing the hatch.
---
Note that some killers will do this and then Mori you after the gates are opened, or hit you so that you have to crawl out. Good luck.
---
i haven't watched it, but it seems so awesome.  
---
honestly i think you should just enjoy it,  
---
but everyone has their reasons.
---
Nah, It's fine as it is. You just have to learn how to play against it. Prayerbeads is just like the Nurse's Omega Blink
---
Ah, fresh meat!
---
Seriously though welcome to the game, glad it‚Äôs growing this fast.
---
The Exhaustion perks are all you really have to extend chases once the killer finds you. Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Lithe, and Dead Hard. If you are new I would recommend Sprint Burst or Lithe. 
---
Spine Chill is a perk that notifies you when the killer is looking in your direction and within 36 meters. If it stays active for more than a second or so, you know the killer is headed your way and you can get a head start.
---
Ok so you pick them as a killer and its random which one you get until you are in the level. Each one gets a voice que! Capt could go yeah yeah yeah yeah and laugh,Otis could say hes the devil here to do the devils work,and baby could just do that trademark cringe laugh. They each have different powers and perks but all brutal! There can be no softness no remorse. How about skins! We could do Otis and Capt from corpses
---
Shit this has me excited!
---
Sounds awesome. My Bloody Valentine
---
That was the inspiration.
---
Outplayed I guess
---
Perks like these would require a maximum number of stacks to be balanced at all.
---
Once they have been powered yes.
---
Usually you would have enough game sense to pick up what aura perks the killer is running without any needed indication.
---
Typically the Killer add-ons are spammed so easily, Distortion runs out super quickly. Scratched Mirror activates everytime Myers stalks, same with Amanda's Letter everytime she crouches. Restraint add-ons are automatic once you start getting people into madness, All-Seeing activates as long as the Wraith is cloaked, Hag's aura traps aren't affected, I believe Huntress has one when she hits you with a hatchet, which well is pointless in itself but also not a big deal with Distortion since she obviously knows you're there.
---
Especially if you're using it in a SWF with comms, you will most definitely be able to figure out what the killer is running without the need for Distortion, I personally think it would be a decent perk if it had more than 3 uses, or masked auras in a small radius so you're not busted when next to other survivors.
---
Why do you have to be wraith and why do you have to stand in a corner? And also, how in the heck do you get 2000 shards so fast?! You level up fast then
---
i walking
---
Yeah, but Franklin's is also pretty damn nice.
---
r/woooosh
---
‚ÄúUseless dead‚Äù lol
---
Just gave him a pat on the shoulder
---
Lol, no. It‚Äôs a handicap with no benefit, regardless of how ‚Äúgood‚Äù you are, if the killer is better or your team is not working together, you just went down. There are far better perk builds, or none at all, that are better than this. I can loop the entire map but if a gen didn‚Äôt get done or blood lust caught up, instead of continuing to extend the chase with another hit, downed.
---
If you're wraith and stand in a corner they won't find you or look for you because no terror radius, so you just open the gate once all gens are powered. Also i play literally 9-10 hours a day every day. I go through levels fast because of how much i play, so I'm gaining 300 shards per level. If i level up 7 times a day that's 2100 shards per day.
---
Honestly more than the stranger things content
---
I love getting "Brutal Killer" and not piping
---
Certainly
---
In which case I still cheer because of all of those free blood points!  ^^
---
I think Season 1 is an absolute masterpiece. The other 2 have flaws but I seriously cant recommend 1 higher.
---
I bleed out so much just because I try finding hatch when I am downed and last it getting hooked.
---
I have never heard anyone in the world share that opinion.
---
I almost feel it is objectively wrong, but I know that's not a thing.
---
0.25 meters dude!!!!!
---
The thing is Spirit and Nurse are difficult to play and I'm guessing you're at yellow - green ranks now. I used to think Nurse isn't *that bad* but at higher ranks she's super dangerous and her addons make her even stronger. Spirit is unfun as fuck to play against, it's mostly a guessing game if she's phasing or not. If you're injured against spirit you're fucked unless you use Iron Will. It doesn't mean they're unbeatable tho :)   
---
As for the perks I think you should swap Lithe for something else - you don't need two exhaustion perks. Perhaps you should try using We'll make it instead to heal your teammates? Lvling up Meg is a great idea, her perks are very good especially Adrenaline :D
---
I want Hawkins high mainly because it looks like normal casual clothing.
---
Maybe it's just the rank I was at. I barely get out of red ranks until rank reset so I probably just forgot how bad it is around those ranks
---
I am going to be a Nancy main from now on... The only bad thing is that I was planning on getting all the perks on Meg.
---
Hatchets are affected by Sloppy Butcher.
---
It wasn't by a grab but I got stuck an enture game in a tree as Huntress
---
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Huntress is pretty balanced
---
Honestly really needs to be fixed. They basically get a free hit burst without the cost of health.
---
Could be happening. But not on this engine :D not with behaviour.
---
Hello, fellow stranger things fan. I suggest trying out the game now that the show you like is soon to be in it.
---
I get downvoted for telling the truth...ok üòÇ
---
How is timing it to get a free hit without loosing health a fair or balanced game mechanic?
---
So you can shine it on his ass or tits and stun it?
---
Same but let me cheer you up because it happened to me aswell.
---
BUBBA might get reworked because he is really weak.
---
Knock out and Franklin's demise are good perks, they work better on other killers.
---
BUBBA can be quite meta with some builds my personal favourite.
---
Play with your food
---
Furgitive chase
---
BBQ or thrilling tremors
---
And any gen regression perk.
---
It's actually really good.
---
That Steve perk is very very broken
---
Guard dog (the perk) wouldn‚Äôt be a perk as its specific to the power of your killer :) nice idea though
---
I really hope the Demogorgon turns out to be a strong killer so I actually get to play as it. I think it looks supercool
---
Literally one killer: wants something broken to be fixed
---
Everyone: &gt;:(

*every regular player that has had chili for years*

I love this üòÇüòÇüòÇüíô
---
Thanks for the feedback! Although personally I don't think these would be too broken since they're hex perks I can see where you're coming from.
---
This is why I want to start running my FUCK YOU build. 
---
Franklin's. NOED. Rancor. Ruin/Dying Light.
---
Franklin's because shithead survivors life is completely over once they lose their flashlight.
---
NOED because FUCK YOU THAT'S WHY.
---
Rancor because fuck the obsession in particular. It's literally *SUPER-NOED*. No counter as it's not a hex, gives them tracking, AND comes with a free Mori. AND It's ran ontop of NOED, so it's basically quadruple NOED! 
---
Ruin because again, fuck you go find the totem.
---
Dying Light because once again, fuck the obsession in particular.
---
I still need to buy the hag but I'll keep this in mind
---
This reminds me of that mining dude from the end of the 1st Incredibles movie
---
Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Object Of Obsession, Head On üò≠
---
Killer: Stridor, Devour Hope, Dying Light, Incidious (even though I hate that perk soooo much Ik it‚Äôs true I‚Äôm really good at not being noticed and in the 6ft range)
---
So no escape from chase and no hiding if injured? That's broken.
---
Look how this turned out
---
I know this isn't life or death, or anything, but it just gets to me. All these accusations that it's some kind of plot and all these contradictory theories, no matter what the shrine output is. It's so dumb.
---
LaAaAaAAaaAMB SaUCeeEEEeeEe

Nah, their just admiring how good of a player i am. Killers really want to be survivors but they have no friends.

Ouch. That's very understandable. Most that run no mither are not good in general. That's just bound to happen. Few exceptional players can pull it off.
---
I know immersion players get a lot of shit, but not all stealthy players are deadweights. Most are :)

Glad you liked it!
---
Lol
---
Lmaooooo
---
I'd just add an extremely hefty BP boost to the hooked player based on the amount of time a killer is within their immediate vicinity (don't make it terror-radius based ofc, insidious is a thing after all). That way, even if you ended up being the first one found, downed and camped, you will at least get some BP out of the game instead of ending up with like 4k as you normally would.
---
Dev's like sympathetic killers. That's why they play off the once human card. Lisa is a prime example. She is literally a demagorgon herself.
---
Welcome to the game
---
Heck yeah
---
Ooft
---
Nurse with discorance and corrput will go some amazing work
---
No mither, Dead hard, Resilience and this is not happening is my goto no mither build. Dead hard acts as your second health state, resilience makes you do everything more efficiently, and this is not happening makes great skill checks way easier. All round decent build for no mither,
---
I don't use it, I use balance landing instead.
---
Yeah I know but still it's a ok counter better than being forced into a locker
---
Oh fuck not bbq
---
I think the guy that unhooked me found the other exit or the hatch because the second I was unhooked I hauled ass to the exit.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm a ghost face main and his theme is really annoying
---
That and moon walking at hyper speeds past the exit gates when they're all waiting to tbag you. Never gets old seeing those clips.

Meme of the Day. IMO.

Their aren't enough upvotes for this gem.

I bought the cannibal yesterday
---
Woah Satan just take a deep breath lmao
---
10 to 15 days after PTB drops.
---
But there are 2 questions
---
BuT ThAt CoSt FiVe DoLlArs!! ToO MuCh FoR BaD KiLlEr!! 
---
Seriously guys its $5. For many of us here that is less than 20mins worth of work. BBQ alone is worth $5. Idc if bubba is trash tier or not
---
He spelt it is as D-E-D.  This is the correct choice.
---
Fat Rambo? Yeah, but The Hair is a good second.
---
That's insult to injury after being tunnel-Mori'd.
---
I had my whole account get reset and they compensated me with more BP than I had earned when my account originally got reset. This was about 3-4 months after console launch though.
---
JASON DOESN'T EXIST!
---
Ya I added another question after the fact.
---
Fuck off, I just bought the cannibal to get that perk last week, I bet that this week when I finally buy the hag with shards next week we will have ruin
---
I pick fellas up as I please because I don't have to worry about DS because I almost always go after the saviour.
---
Thats how I feel
---
 How far behind is console dlc? If I were to get the switch game when it comes out...... would I get stranger things as an option to buy?
---
Me and if it was 2 survivor thing, Joyce too!
---
Love me some Winona üòî
---
Overwatch has to be the single most toxic game I've ever played. I might consider lowlevel League of Legends due to all the people making new accounts after being banned for toxicity. But otherwise for sure midrank Overwatch
---
Yeah but the "Broken status" wasn't a thing. Like when I was playing it didn't tell people they were "Broken" you would just start injured. Now there is a constant status effect. It also wouldn't tell you about Ruin/Hexes or even NOED.
---
Most annoying would probably be a 3-gen doctor.
---
Use BBQ on all your killers if you are just starting out for the bloodpoints alone
---
Not that i know of. That‚Äôs why i said it would be completely unique, no other perk has that kind of system. They would probably need a setting or something which turns off killer specific sounds so people don‚Äôt get confused if they don‚Äôt want it but i would like the personal touch.
---
Hillbilly = Billy Willy
---
Leatherface = Big Bubba

Doc = Zappy cunt

Huntress = Big Russian Mom

Clown = oh god oh fuck i need to consume his thick cheesy foreskin oh god please big dick clownerino lemme slurp that chunk
---
I guess the ability to play 'dress up' while trying to look at cosmetics? I want to see what Items look good together before I buy them but I cant because when I leave a section it goes back to what I was actually wearing.
---
So it would be cool if you could like, for example: Put on Feng's ribbon hair, move to shirts, Ribbon hair stays on, put on a random shirt, move to pants, ribbon hair and shirt is still there, put on pants, and then off to the side it lists how much those items would cost together in auric cell or iri shards. Just so I can get a feel of what cosmetics look nice together since I don't really like just going with one outfit that the devs made to show off the items.
---
For huntress, a loud version of her lullaby
---
Alright, I have tested with 2 different stealth builds and 2 different more balanced builds, 2 games each, so 8 in total. I will share the best game from each pair. I am only Rank 12 right now. My perks are not super leveled, sorry, but I can try to imagine the impact a slightly better perk would have.
---
Build 1: Spine Chill 2, Urban Evasion 2, Diversion 2, Dark Sense 1
---
Killer: Clown - This game was on the Swamp map and gave me a good example of how Spine Chill could help. Near the beginning of the game, someone got injured. 30 seconds later, I encountered them and they helped me work on a generator. Since Spine Chill didn't go off at all, I knew that the killer had sufficiently lost them. Later, I was working on a totem and saw spine chill start to activate. However, someone got unhooked, and since I saw Spine Chill go off and stay off, I knew the killer had gone back to hook. With the cooldown of Premonition, this would not have worked as well. Spine Chill also helped at the end with the exit gates, allowing me to know when I could safely start the red lights on the switch, where premonitions cooldown wouldn't have worked with the short patrol route the killer had. Spine Chill helped me avoid a chase for the entire match.
---
Build 2: Premonition 2 Instead (Only got a chance to play one game for this one, did this one last and ran out of time.)
---
Killer: Wraith - I got caught at the beginning of the game and Premonition didn't trigger, must have been at the wrong angle or something. However, I ended up escaping due to the Wraith being bad. Eventually, I got to work on a very unsafe generator at the side of the map, and Premonition told me not only was Wraith going for me, but he was also nowhere nearby. Spine Chill wouldn't have given me this information. However, that information didn't do much for me in this situation. Premonition helped tell me what exit gate Wraith was at when they became available, but Dark Sense covered this information, and in a different situation, Alert would have covered it as well.
---
Build 3: Spine Chill 2, Wake Up 3, Lithe 1, Adrenaline 1
---
Killer: Plague - This game was on the Baddam Preschool map. At the beginning when I was working on a generator, Spine Chill went off, but I misjudged which direction the killer was coming from, which wouldn't have have happened with Premonition. I was hooked and went to the second state, and there were many gens left. However, later when I was working on a generator, Spine Chill helped me know I was safe on my escape route when the killer showed up, and I got to survive a bit longer until I eventually died by exiting a locker at the exact wrong moment.
---
Build 4: Premonition 2 Instead
---
Killer: Freddy - This game was on the Mother's Dwelling map. The killer used the addon that made us all start asleep, and as I went to the alarm clock, Premonition told me Freddy was nearby. However, I tried to be stealthy, not knowing he had already spotted me from a distance, and when he found me and had a chase, Premonition had no effect that helped me extend my survivability. Spine Chill has the two in chase effects of making your vault 6% faster and helping you avoid some backtracking mind games if you use it very effectively. Premonitions cooldown is too long to help you during a chase whatsoever. Later, Premonition helped me again by telling me what direction Freddy was coming from, allowing me to know that it was safe to get an unhook. However, it gave me no information on whether or not I could heal the unhooked survivor after moving a bit away from the hook, so I had to guess and luckily got it right. Later, I knew Freddy was in a chase near me, but I couldn't tell if he had seen me and abandoned his target which I probably could have with Spine Chill. This ended up killing me. However, I could see why Premonition has value compared to Spine Chill
---
Final Results:
---
All in all, from this recorded test and previous experiences, I can see the uses for both perks. I believe Spine Chill is very strong against the top tier killers Nurse and Spirit (It destroys Prayer Bead Necklace,) and also Ghostface and Myers. Against a Hillbilly or Huntress, though, Premonition is more or less as useful as Spine Chill, and both are fairly strong. Against a Freddy though, with all the mist, I think Premonition is stronger, but I don't think either are very good against a Freddy regardless. These are all of the fairly good killers, so I don't know how it would work against the rest. Anyways, I would rather run Spine Chill still, but in a KYF if I know who the killer is, I can see myself running Premonition against the killers I stated.
---
Nah those are cuties.
---
For Jaso- oh wait
---
There are benefits to stealth, nothing says game throwing when you get farmed off a hook with no BT when the killer is picking up someone and they see you get saved, drop them, then down everyone lol.  A healthy mix in my opinion is needed. This has been fun.
---
I feel like it was about time we got some young survivors.
---
DLC releases on consoles at the same
---
Matchmaking was always done on their servers. We're now also having the game run on their server.
---
Also, dedicated servers are worse than P2P for the killer 100% of the time. For survivors, it's somewhere between 0-100%. There are definitely nearby hosts that will give you better latency than whatever unity server farm the game is hosted on.
---
I agree but they were a lot stronger before I changed them. I actually buffed Spirit Drain so instead of 15% it's 20%. People also didn't seem to like that the effects were stacked every time a survivor was hit. Low Stamina used to decrease the speed at which you vault windows and pallets by 9% per hit. Thanks for your feedback though!
---
does anyone have a clue on when test server goes live?
---
What did you say to him? Saying fuck you doesn't get a ban
---
Plug walk
---
Sorry but this doesn't illustreate the problem with swf. It only shows that you had bad players on your team
---
Maybe when it is Demogorgan. The gens will have Christmas lights on them, and when the Demogorgan goes near a gen while in the upside down, the Christmas lights light up so survivors know the Demogorgan has spotted them and will most likely be coming out of one of the tears and straight to them.
---
Is it just me, or Steve and Nancy are small as fuck
---
Nice upvotes bro, oh wait..
---
Yessssss! 
---
(Spooky Space Kook was the name I couldn't remember, that laugh definitely Doctor type){Captain Cutler could be Trapper, the weapon could be so cool}
---
And there could be special medkits that look like Scooby Doo lunchboxes or boxes of scooby snacks. Flashlights that give the Scooby symbol or the mystery machine.
---
Iron wil Self care Small Game Sprint bbbbbrus
---
He was obviously trolling and sent me weird messages, and I unfortunately fed the troll and called him some things which he probably just waited for to report me, I swear people these days get offended for rhe smallest things they wouldn't survive an hour on mw2 lobbies back then
---
it cannot be easy to bring these things into the game. just from working out and purchasing contracts and licensing agreements - to actually creating the content in-game? I happily pay for it. Can‚Äôt wait to add the ST Chapter to my roster. What I am grateful for is that these devs work hard and keep up with their game. Some other games like this one and pretty well-known f13 are a nightmare now because they‚Äôve been abandoned. And actually they did give everyone Bill Overbeck for free.
---
Breaking Bad. Good show too.
---
Wouldn't "dead weight" be better?
---
When I get unhooked, I usually let the rescuer run away so the killer follows their tracks while I walk towards the other direction.
---
They completely changed the perk. Originally, you just needed to be *hit 3 times* in order to activate the perk. Now it‚Äôs 3 protection hits. 
---
They successfully eliminated MoM for the most part. It‚Äôs more than a nerf, it‚Äôs almost the entire removal of a perk from the game
---
It doesn't? Hm
---
Lmao, yes, it would. Though chances are the devs will pick the most inoffensive options for every category.
---
Or maybe, just maybe, it's purely a monster.
---
Oh man. I been grinding to get Hag in order to get Hex Ruins but didn't expect BBQ to show up.
---
I'm not really sure why people are so confused between human/humanoid.. The demogorgan is a humanoid but not human. No one lied to you.
---
They are 100% picked by devs and that's ok with me, I dont want to have 4 tier 1 perks at once and miss out on one
---
That perk would solely make Huntress almost completely unplayable. Maybe make the speed only temporary, not through the whole chase because that‚Äôs just dumb powerful
---
The only other idea I had for him was a reverse head on for windows
---
 I'm not really sure why people are so confused between human/humanoid.. The demogorgan is a humanoid but not human. No one lied to you.

Michael Scott, killer:
---
Perk ‚Äúthat‚Äôs what she said‚Äù. Michael screams his catchphrase and all survivors within 15m suffer a 5/10/15% speed penalty to ALL survivor actions for 3 seconds whilst grabbing their heads/facepalming from the corniness associated with said catchphrase. Survivors do NOT have to be in view for it to take effect, though. 
---
Perk ‚Äúassistant TO the regional manager‚Äù, any survivor affected by this perk (it would activate like Mikey‚Äôs stalk, though it would have a cool down period), gets a 3/5/7 second cool down on all activatable survivor perks due to losing morale when they realize they aren‚Äôt actually an assistant regional manager. 
---
Perk ‚Äúyou get the Dundie for.....‚Äù upon activation, Michael sings one of his goofy parody songs for 5/10/15 seconds as he hunts the survivors and anyone within range of his song (Huntress‚Äô range, which I forget exactly what the range is), suffers from the ‚Äúexposed‚Äù status effect if they are working on a generator or healing. 
---
His weapon I would really like to be the car he hit Meredith with but that‚Äôs pretty much impossible, so..... a sheet of paper that‚Äôs razor-sharp (paper cuts) 
---
This has all been a parody, a joke, and I hope at least one person enjoys it!
---
Thanks for the feedback. Although I don't think of these as bad perks. They can all be stacked to a degree. Hitting a survivor 5 times with Spirit Drain literally makes it impossible to do skill checks if the totem wasn't cleansed. Nobody Lives Forever can also be stacked as many times as you hit the survivor, making perks like Autodidact more used. I don't think I can win with Low Stamina though, people complained it was broken in its last iteration but I changed it and now people think the opposite even though they get exhausted (meaning they cant use exhaustion perks) when they vaults 3 times in 15 seconds. Again, thanks for your feedback, I appreciate it.
---
Remember, if you have a lot of the games perks, you can also save shards, and convert them into BP when the DLC drops, you can also try to fish for some high BP quests, namely the mori ones, and complete them, but not redeem them until the dlc drops.
---
I didn‚Äôt think of this... but agreed
---
I wasn't discussing whether or not she was fun to play against, I was responding to the premise that she's broken.
---
Chad as killer please.

I always liked hearing him in them, but the narrator they got for Darkness Among Us onwards sounds so cool tbh.

:P I didn't know what to write when I wrote this last night so I wasnt thinking that much. I'll have a solid answer, 'a yes or a no' on Thursday
---
Yeah, i got so hyped! Man i wish i was that good at looping.
---
I can understand Low Stamina having been op, maybe if it was like 1/2/3% it would have worked but idk. I‚Äôm not good at the numbers just getting something out there so people can bounce off it to get actual good numbers.
---
Shame that you are so unlucky with him, and that you dont get fun. I assume you are a high rank killer? Cant deny he's underperforming at high ranks.
---
I have 6000 shards saved at a moment. Just gonna but 200k on killers then work back up to a mill then repeat
---
I think on my Billy id rather run only BBQ than any 3 other perks if I had to pick one or the other.
---
(Unless there's some insane billy perk that's been released since the plague, I haven't been playing)

---
Just watching a few of his videos has actually helped alot! Now i just have to figure out the layouts of each map.
---
Normally when i actively play i'm high purple rank, one or two ranls from red, so yeah I guess a high ranked killer, but even when i'm at the lower ranks it's just not as fun as doctor or Myers
---
Welcome!
---
Thanks man.
---
I have so much stuff on my Jake I won‚Äôt even know I‚Äôve used them ha
---
I did not realize they stack, so I can respect Spirit Drain a lot more now, that seems balanced and fun. Nobody Lives Forever is now incredibly overpowered, should be 1/2/3 seconds. I would like Low Stamina to maybe slow down your fast vault speed while exhausted instead of exhausting you for fast vaulting.
---
Am I the only one that doesn't try to hide?
---
I mean, it's not that i'm going to go find the killer, but I don't mind being chased either. They way I look at the game, when you play survivor, you should either loop the killer or repair gens. If you're crouching around, trying to be stealthy or hiding in lockers you're just being useless.
---
Isn't the phasing already mapwide just not inside her heartbeat?

That looks really cool!

Imo it all falls apart once the totem is cleansed (stacks can't be put onto survivors and stacks already on survivors disappear).

Makes u feel good
---
How about getting the game last week, waiting 5 mins to get a killer game and getting 4 stacked where 2 of them were rank 4
---
Has claudettes self care perk ever been on there?
---
I'd say she's a bit underpowered. While her power lets her do some amazing plays and she's very good most of the time, on some maps (anywhere where she doesn't have enough time to charge up her throw, like houses on Haddonfield) she's even worse than bubba/wraith.
---
Pretty much agreed honestly, not a huge fan of the actual games, but the theme is pretty cool. Also, the last game, the VR one was actually pretty well done overall in comparison.
---
He was streaming. His buddy had distortion and he lost a stack in the exit gate area since Blood Warden reveals survivor auras in the exit gates. He told his buddy I was running BL, and he DC's to screw me out of my BW.
---
This is the best shrine ive seen yet.
---
Yeah. What do you believe the power of the killer would be? I personally have no idea.
---
Now that you added the death ones, I suggest a change
---
I'd change it form "Dead" to "Death" when you depip/pip
---
Probably wraith. Skinny really out here with that tree branch aesthetic. 
---
For real tho, I hate the idea of running into a dude that‚Äôs tall, thin-limbed, white-eyed and has a strangely disfigured head. Myers is up there too, and so is Trapper 
---
Id wanna run into Anna she kinda quirky doe üò≥üò≥
---
Bubba was actually my highest level killer for a while lol
---
People are still going to be using self-care. They already use it through Sloppy Butcher heals. If you want to incentivise using a medkit you could make it so that medkits heal at normal speed so 16 seconds (No speed boost to healing from the medkit.) That could incentivise bringing Pharmacy as well as Autodidact. I think it should cap at something because every perk in the game that grows over time has a cap, but maybe make it 40 seconds instead of 32 or something.
---
I'm not too sure to be honest, but they could easily have a perk, or perks relating to the gens,
---
let‚Äôs not, i don‚Äôt want to see poor Kenny, Lee, Clementine or anyone else die :/
---
Basically when you set up your flair on the site it has a text prewritten under it, you can delete that text and replace it with something else.
---
But if you're asking in general, go to the subreddit on the new Reddit website, on the right hand side where there's a box that reads "community details" there will be a drop-down box labeled "community options". Click that and then click the pencil next to user flair preview. It'll show all the Flairs.
---
Did someone summon me?
---
Oh maybe you meant "reasons to get the game". Well cause it's fun idk
---
Every time you get a non-stop teabagger you just know they're going to disconnect the moment you manage to land a hit on them. It's so pathetic. The only people who are actually trash are people who cry over taking a hit and try to deny you points and your perk benefits. It's their loss because they're ensuring they get zero bloodpoints while you get a quitter bonus from them. It's also a shitty of them to disconnect because it screws over their own teammates unless you turn the remainder of the match into farming, in which case they're losing out while you and the remaining Survivors are farming for points together. It's an even greater loss for them if they used an Escape Cake or anyone else in the match used Bloody Party Streamers. The disconnecting players a real issue and I'm glad it's going to be punishable soon. There's nothing worse than playing Survivor and the moment one of your teammates is hit or down there's gone. Some people disconnect even if the match has been going super well and it's their first hit.
---
I feel that a lot!
---
What do you think of my Low Stamina idea? I don't think the fast vault thing really makes sense right now.
---
Definitely perks related to machinery in general, but affecting perks. Probably something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou have thorough knowledge of machinery. Using the activate ability button, you can temporarily disable a generator for 10 seconds by interacting for 2.5 seconds. Once used, this perk goes on cooldown for 150/120/90 seconds.‚Äù Or something like that for one perk. Idk i‚Äôm not good with balancing the numbers but neither are the devs apparently so that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.
---
well t bagging a team at the hook is just troll players messing around havemt had that experience in a while and t bagging at a dropped pallet is kinda toxic be its basically taunting the killer and the survivor is ballsy and acourde t bagging at the gate is a traditional everyone does that to the killer and the killer usually walks away until they leave or nod his head up and down at he walks towards them
---
What do you think is inside our megawatt flashlights?

I honestly think perks from killers/survivors who need to be bought with money shouldn't be on the shrine. It makes ppl not even wanna buy the dlc. Not many ppl like Leatherface and they feel like there's no point in buying the killer if they can just get their perks through the shrine. So why let them be in there in the first place? Tbh it doesn't make sense. BHVR wants ppl to buy their dlcs but putting the licensed characters perks in the shrine will in a lot of cases prevent ppl from buying them. Besides, 7+ dollars is kinda expensive for a dlc character anyway. U see all these fighting games that charge 4.99 for each character so why 7+? Especially if u can get their perks and play their maps already with the base game? Idk I'm just ranting I'll stop now

I‚Äôm being honest 90% of the time i forget i have one and lose it.
---
They wont because the point of the window is to create distance from the Killer, not for killers to be on par with survivors
---
Pinhead? Who could it be? Who's fucking left lol. Maybe pennywise?
---
I am transgender
---
Fucking auto correct
---
Be sure to get the xp bonus for playing you first killer and survivor match each day
---
It has not been announced yet. Keep your eyes peeled, we'll let you know soon.
---
Killer lobbies take 5 seconds to make, survivor queues are 3-5 mins just to get dodged or get shitty ping
---
Mine take like 10-15 min just to create

I wish they would actually just fix it for everyone. I like playing survivor but alone it isn‚Äôt as much fun, and not many friends of mine play.

LEAVE BUBBA ALONE

Of course wake up is still bugged

Perfect, now I can prepare for grind season
---
What was the old mettle of man like? What did they change?
---
i love it when ghosty is stalking someone and you break him out of stalk and he turns towards you looking feelsbadman
---
Because he draws out the game but isn't good enough to actually end the game
---
I had a 4-man swf turn up that all had no mither + sabo boxes. I was playing Hillbilly and despite not using my chainsaw once it was one or the funniest games I‚Äôve ever had. More people need to do this, it‚Äôs a nice refreshment from the usually nurse/spirit red-rank games.
---
When I see someone with Object of Obsession I ignore them until I kill at least 2 survivors. Then I down the last one and go for them cause it's obvious all they are trying to do is get the killers attention and try to loop them while everyone else does gens. Might as well save them for the end and let them die on first hook.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the ebony mori and infectious fright
---
You will never reach the truth
---
I thought she just sucked to heal there and they missed. How the hell did that work?
---
If I DC at roundstart, you can't finish a single gen, making you even more garbage. See? It goes both ways.
---
Also with the build I was running I am literally perkless (Well, besides Rancor's location reveal after each gen is done) for 95% of the match.
---
i think these perks are nice but the one that affect skill checks should maybe have a cap so you arent at 100% less opacity and just screwed if the killer is really protecting that totem
---
Getting the generator done faster matters a lot, because the killer has way less time to patrol back to the generator and interrupt you. Once you have 3 people on a generator, if the killer doesn't immediately patrol to that area, that generator is gone. This is especially useful on unsafe generators, like the ones in the center of the map, because taking those out as fast as possible helps you a lot later game, and while the killer can guard the generator in the center of Ormond effectively if it takes 80 seconds, they cant when it takes less than 40.
---
I think disabling SWF for at least the first \~5 matches for both killer and survivor would be great for new players, it would help them start learning the game in a more healthy way. Our playerbase is not big enough for that tho.
---
I mainly play legion because I like him a lot and since I have tier 3 bbq and chili the bloodpoint gain is incredible even if everyone gets out. Stabbing everyone  with a couple hooks included nets over 20k a game (before bbq) playing casually against average survivors. Every now and then I get salt because I "camped" a hooked or downed person when bbq literally means hook everyone once which means camping is a waste of time. I don't even hook survivors 3 times most of the time if I manage to keep finding them instead of the others because I put myself in their shoes. It isnt fun being the only one chased unless you actually want to be. IMO the hate comes from survivors not liking him even though he is one of the weakest killers but strongest against bad survivors who are super altruistic.
---
With all the Mori posts involving the characters being ill aligned, we will see this some day.
---
[Poor Michael](https://i.imgur.com/UiXAker.gif)
---
That sounds awesome!
---
All perks can be played on all characters, same as survivors you just have to unlock it
---
I see a fellow Third Seal
---
If you tunnel the killer for 1 minute you get camped. Rank 10-20 killers will always have noed. If you accidentally tbag the killer will message you. The whole community is toxic
---
I still have fun with Leatherface. Maybe I'm playing him wrong (right).
---
I am by no means rich or well off but i will never understand people that buy the game and then slowly grind shards and buy everything else. All the DLC is super affordable, why isn't people just buying a DLC every now and then instead of waiting months and months for that one perk to show up.
---
Spine Chill, Solidarity, Bond, Calm Spirit
---
It‚Äôs because they mostly do it as a joke, it‚Äôs a terrible perk. If you‚Äôre looking for a meta build, you‚Äôre going the wrong way. If you want a meme build, then carry on

It was! I know it wasn‚Äôt a great reply to your question since I‚Äôve never tried it, but from the killer‚Äôs side it can be super duper fun!
---
I really enjoyed Doctor....until I leveled up.  Not fun getting endlessly looped around the larger tiles.
---
I dont think this format fits here
---
We're aware it goes both ways, but we both get this garbage, ONLY killer is negatively effected by SWF queues ignoring ranks other than the host. But I've literally never seen one streamer even queue up as the higher rank. They always queue with the lowest.
---
what ?
---
Especially when they go on sale for $3 every so often.
---
I live pay to pay and can still put aside for a DLC by skipping a meal or taking my bottles back to the depot.
---
Talking about The Walking Dead, how about Negan as the killer? Would be pretty damn cool, I mean imagine his Mori.
---
Or Alpha as the killer would be maybe even more cool.
---
You give us way too much credit.
---
Definitely not. Putting on a weak perk to "counter" a counter to your perk is a waste
---
They want to kill you. Crazy, right?
---
I really enjoy the idea of Spirit Drain.  The potential combo of that with Huntress Lullaby with the Doctor's power makes me cackle with glee as a killer and hopelessly frantic as a survivor.
---
It‚Äôs only the price of two beers, oh no
---
Well how were they supposed to know that you had bloodwarden. Just a happy coincidence that their dc fucked you
---
Top tip of the week: if you run ruin don‚Äôt immediately make a b line for it at the start of the game. Nothing quite screams ‚Äútotem over here!!!!!‚Äù Like a billy chainsawing it to the other side of the map, looking around sheepishly then leaving. It‚Äôs incredible how many killers do this even in good ranks.
---
Entity wanted a longer show
---
Its not good. Ruins is clearly better. And if i'm gonna run a second perk to help slow down gens ill use something like pop the weasel, sloppy, or even thrill of the hunt
---
Nurse is currently the best killer in the game when mastered. Spirit is also good.
---
Hopper would have fit just fine. This reasoning is just something you made up.
---
Fortune Favors the Bold iirc. It's what Gladiator says when he toe stabs in For Honor.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt happen back to back though. One of the sides waits at least 5 mins for a game, the other gets an insta lobby
---
I can't wait to teabag The Predator !
---
Leaks by daylight found that the dlc is going to be released on september the 30 :(
---
They are reworking the Bloodweb (No one knows what they are doing exactly) Thats coming along with the Stranger Things chapter. Could be easier grind?
---
Yeah i don't really get it, if you're a decent killer main chances are you already have BBQ because it's a very meta, so it only benefits new..ish killer or a survivor main doesn't really make a difference
---
The grabs are super bugged and it gets very little attention.
---
Trapper against OoO Means M1 killer pretty much Feelsbadman
---
Laughs in nurse main
---
Lol. You mean super easy! Ahh, but they had strategy for their build so they probably entertained you from the sound of it. How many kills did you get?
---
I hope the next dlc is original
---
I don't really care licensed or not, as long as its well made.
---
Don't forget ghostface! I have ghostface, leatherface, Freddie and Michael Myers. Might have to get the stranger things one now
---
Again, that shouldn't matter. But I'm not you.
---
&gt; instaheal has a delay.
---
It's less that, and more that while you're locked in an animation, you don't have a knockdown animation, so your animation will continue to play until the knockdown animation timer expires, which will then slap you in the down-state immediately.
---
It's why you can continue to repair a generator for 0.1 seconds after getting hit into the dying state while on it.
---
Hi Dad, I'm Invisible
---
Some way to make the game more competetive
---
Ya after the demogorgon at least.
---
I mean like it could be a mr. Black
---
‚Äúall the time‚Äù ? I play dbd a lot, rank 1, and I barely face nurses. I do play her myself though
---
Well they were SUPER on it when it came to 99ing hooks, they played ridiculously smartly for what they were doing, the no mither self pickup thing worked in their favour a lot as I was forced to slug without any hooks close. I wouldn‚Äôt say it was easy but it was damn fun! 
---
I killed 3 in the end, wanted to give the Jane the hatch but she just pointed at a hook and refused to leave so I killed her too. I hope one day I‚Äôll go against a team doing something similar!
---
I think this idea is so good and worthwhile, that you should refine it and try to bring it to the devs. I genuinely appreciate this mythological asetetic.
---
*Loud coughing*
---
Their policy on licensed killers is simple, they produce them as the opportunities arise. They have no reason not to take those chances, due to the fact that licensed killers consistantly draw new eyes onto the game, particularly such a modern one like this one. Sorry to break it to you, but if chapter 13 goes well, theres actually a pretty good chance that we might be primarily seeing licensed content for quite some time, due to other license holders approaching behaviour.
---
I understand, though personally I‚Äôm a big hillbilly main (with some love for Myers and Freddy though). But I do think people should indeed try Leatherface. Having to grind Leatherface for bbq and playing him along the way should almost be required for all killers lol
---
XD
---
Yeah i know, but I was wondering if enduring was a billy perk or a general killer perk
---
What's this model from? Looks dope.
---
Wow that Kate sounds like a champ! They probably knew they deserved it for trolling you hard. Sounds like an interesting game. I've seen something similar on YT before. Don't think it was a man tho
---
I don't really wanna "get in" on this argument, but this part:
---
&gt; never working on a gen with someone else...
---
Makes no sense in context of a conversation centered around Distortion
---
This is exactly what I thought of while making this perk.
---
BBQ isn't the only good perk Cannibal has. Franklin's is actually a good perk and I love running it because whenever I smack someone as they are running away they always do a little spin around circle basically saying goodbye to their item which makes me laugh.
---
I watched their stream. Their buddy called it out since he was running distortion and lost a stack inside the exit gate area. (Blood Warden reveals survivor auras inside the exit gates)
---
Not sure if b8 but: No One Escapes Death, BBQ and Chili, BloodPoints. Most acronyms are shortenings of perk names and offerings/add-ons to the items in game. Like, TOTH is faster to type out than Hex: Thrill of the Hunt
---
Tru, on the upside if u have to grind the licensed killers for their perks it will give ppl more experience and they can learn to play them better or even Branch out and change their main. Can't really say the same about survivors tho since all a survivor is, is a new cosmetic xD. "Oh I main Meg but I can get all the same perks as Jane so maybe I'll go with Ms.Thicc" lmao
---
I legit bought bubba last week just for bbq and chilli and now it‚Äôs in the shrine
---
Someone made fun of me for running Spinechill.
---
It was an autodidact build, Spinechill is great in that build, or in general VS stealth killers.
---
Right. At least they can‚Äôt depip
---
Is there any point to playing solo? I kind of want to get into it but don't really have friends to play with.
---
Unfortunately that's from a large amount of the sub not knowing what an actual BHJ is
---
They thought you were farming or deranking...that's literally the only reason you got even a single kill
---
I just bought Leatherface a week ago..
---
Or People Who Type Like This
---
What has that to do with me getting a single kill? The last survivor obviously made a mistake by staying near the exit and try to be funny. ;)
---
I applaud you
---
Oh my god we need Lee.
---
fair enough
---
Urban evasion
---
That's a really cool idea but I have a feeling it would be hilariously bad in execution.
---
That would be broken, making a whole item useless.
---
If you run We‚Äôll Make It then it‚Äôs nothing but a buff for that perk.
---
Tbh I agree 100% BUT LET ME TELL U SOMETHING!! If they add a Resident Evil chapter with either Mr.X or Nemesis as the killer and their respected survivors (Leon, Claire, Ada, Jill) I would hands down buy it with a quickness and I'd have new mains. Lol
---
They probably thought you had a throwing axe daily. You were just yeeting axes at them, clearly if you annoyed with them you would've just ran up and chased them out
---
Oh thanks for explaining lol
---
Shirtless Myers isn't an r/deadbydaylight meme.
---
At least she has them
---
Yeah but this would force me to either unlock it in the shrine or boost David up.
---
*to be continued music* üòÇü§£üòÇ
---
Only thing i don't really like about licensed characters is the inability to purchase them with shards tbh. Most of them are very nice additions to the game, and help bring in more people who otherwise wouldn't even know about the game.
---
Killers have feelings too
---
Finally some good fucking totem placements
---
Not really, only do rituals that are 30k+. I ain‚Äôt gonna do a daily for 20 or 25k. Reroll it is
---
Sorry but I have to disagree, he thought the axe wouldn‚Äôt hit him and that‚Äôs why he stayed there.
---
You can keep the ritual anyways. Those mori dailies are the best ones to get
---
Well I mean the demogorgon hates light and heat so ...
---
It does as long as your playtime while you bought that DLC is under 2 hours and 2 weeks of purchase.
---
I would've thought the same had you not admitted you let them farm the whole game
---
A good week for newbies coming in for ST DLC. Get that BBQ. I was so dumb and level 50'd like 6 killers before getting bubba.
---
Not enough people playing killer, I‚Äôd guess.
---
When you realilise he has s tombstone
---
Its good, not great. Its better on the 110ms speed killers, and killers with set up time like Trapper and Myers. 
---
It's a more consistent, but less powerful Ruin. Its also Plagues best perk, so if dont plan on getting her DLC then yes, CI is worth getting. If you plan on buying Plauge, then just wait and unlock the teachable.
---
Probably because they hate themselves and are generally just a loser.
---
Wait, so I was AFK - unaware that the game loaded since DBD takes forever to find a match. And now you‚Äôre saying I let them farm? I don‚Äôt understand but frankly I don‚Äôt care. Thank you for your replies ;)
---
The ONLY problem I have with Ghostface is that he can just t-bag behind a box or spam-lean around a wall and keep resetting the reveal timer. I feel like to balance that aspect out a little it should keep the timer for a few seconds after he hides or resets his exposing timer.
---
Not if you don‚Äôt have mori‚Äôs on that certain killer lol
---
I think what he meant is after the first 2 minutes it's deactivated perk.
---
Not really language dependent but a friend and I always call the Pig any other animal/insect than Pig, and each time we refer to it we have to use a different animal.
---
Scratched mirror for life
---
Like I said, you can keep the daily
---
I'm tranquillised. Zzz
---
I'd have thought killer was more popular. And you can have 4 survivors to 1 killer.
---
So long as you understand that you will die more than you escape you'll be good.  I'm usually happy with a safety pip or if I kill at least 2 survivors. 
---
Success shouldn't be viewed as steamrolling the survivors. Or getting everyone to escape. It's all about those blood point imo.
---
Welcome to the game.
---
I'd rather have Lee or clementine
---
Cause  he's mentally challenged
---
i think you mean.....  Deja Vu?
---
Killer is gonna be terminal cancer.
---
That's the problem. How do you rework vigil without completely remove the effects from Sloppy Butcher or Third Seal? Third seal that lasts only 30 seconds is completely worthless.
---
Kill Count?  I see your a man of culture as well
---
It sounds like they're for free!
---
It‚Äôs honestly so annoying. You wait that long just to 
---
1) get dodged because you look toxic or for whatever reason
---
2) get in a shitty ping lobby
---
I fucking love your attitude my boi. But u forgot hex: devour bit**es. Because fuck them for daring to unhook.
---
Well on one side it really doesn't fit in with the lore they created.
---
On the other side why does anybody care about them changing minor things in lore if you get great content?
---
A lot of DBD players on PS4 play with friends, and you can‚Äôt play killer with friends. I think that‚Äôs part of it. There‚Äôs also the fact that the game performance seems worse for killers, and that toxic assholes will bombard you with messages post-match which puts some people off.
---
Realistically it would probably be a lot harder to make it walk on all fours. They probably use a base model for Killers, similarly to Survivors.
---
Decisive strike
---
Thanks Julian, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it tbh
---
lmao welcome!!!
---
They used the phrase soy cucks. They don't like themselves, how can they like a game?
---
I was just about to post on this. Currently waiting in a queue as a killer but surprisingly still can‚Äôt find a game!
---
Actually a really big fan of that Steve perk. I have always loved saving people and i will totally pair this perk with Borrowed time. I really hope his other perks have the same "Babysitting" Theme.
---
Add one for DC'ing that just says "Coward"
---
Thanks for the news! 
---
From this, I'm really excited with the direction that they're going with these survivors and the perks actually seem viable and not trash.
---
Be mine, shouldn‚Äôt it be 15/10/5 assuming levels 1/2/3?
---
Or you hide too and not letting yourself get stalked when he does it.
---
Why are people booing you? you're right
---
Mike can wipe an entire team of cocky survivors in 1 tier 3 lol
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

Im in the opposite boat. Myers, I know Im going to die. Ghostface, there is a chance. And that chance makes my butt pucker.
---
Oops, yeah that‚Äôs right. Honestly I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs how it worked
---
Sounds like it‚Äôll still be their default outfits
---
I don't see the point of seeing my own scratch marks. I mean, if I run I obviously leaving scratch marks, If I stop running I won't anymore. It's common sense, what's the point?
---
Yesss, that is a great explaination
---
Very Intriguing especially with Nancy's second perk the Scratchmarks one.
---
Or you hide too and not letting yourself get stalked when he does it
---
Me and my Italian friends always call The Pig "La Maiala" which basically means "The Bitch" because, y'know, Amanda is a pig
---
they're dlc excluvise cosmetics ie u get them if u buy the dlc. they always have those
---
Yea , if you buy the DLC you'll get the cosmetics too but I think there'll some other cosmetics in the store that you'll have to buy with auric cells
---
Corrupt is amazing on Trapper and any other trap based killer. Couple of minutes to basically get your traps set up and not have to worry about gens getting done across the map
---
I don't mind the Demogorgon. I would have just really preferred Billy Hargrove. I think evil people are more interesting than evil monsters.
---
Yeah, i also never watched the show and i don't get all this hype by the fans, but 2 new survivors, a new killer and a new map are pretty good reasons to get hyped even if you don't care about the show. I just don't really like this whole influx of ST content on the sub that will undoubtedly keep up at least for a couple weeks after the chapter launches.
---
I feel like the actual DbD content i visit this sub for is being drowned out by all these ST posts and discussions, and i even got downvoted to hell and back for daring to say i don't like the state the sub is in right now. Like, chill out people, i get that you like the show, but please don't constantly shove it down our throats on a subreddit dedicated to Dbd, there are subreddits for ST content.
---
Okay, that Steve perk alone confirms we're getting Season 2/3 Steve and not douchebag Season 1 Steve. Nice!
---
I think you only get these cosmetics by purchasing the whole chapter from the steam store and not using auric cells or whatever to buy individual characters from the ingame store.
---
Good boy, here's a treat. üî¶
---
Being a survivor main I too love to gain a bit of boldness  points and do a bit of butt dancing around AFK killers but this is always my fear. This is exactly what we deserve if we get too ballsy  haha but still nice throwing skills, I bet she was pissed off at herself for not leaving sooner üòÇüòÇ
---
Dude seriously I have like 450,000 bloodpoints because of this shrine
---
it's confirmed on the [roadmap page on the official website](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/roadmap) that we are getting cosmetics "Year 4 will feature four major Chapters. Each Chapter introduces a new fantasy in the Dead by Daylight universe, bringing new characters with their own backstory, unique gameplay mechanics, progression, and set of cosmetics."
---
Sir this is a Wendy's
---
Oh my
---
I think there'll be dif. just like the Ash dlc where he comes with 2 hands
---
It does remove the effects from sloppy butcher so its a good counter to that, and the third seal is already useless. This perk is meant to counter other perks and abilities so it is situational. This takes up a perk slot and it doesn't protect your team from effects like that.
---
Yeah but usually it's a t-shirt recolor. This sounds like SOME design went into it.
---
I guess survivors have vile purge now good to know
---
Scoops Ahoy or die.
---
No mither has a 50% (i think) iron will built in. its largely good enough that only killers with incredible headphones will be able to hear your grunts
---
How did you misspell it
---
Don't actually have leatherface so this is really good for me
---
I'm down for this. Might get rid of the locker-all-game crew
---
Exactly. I tried LF and wasn't too much of a fan, also don't have a lot of time to grind for his teachable. So purchasing this perk came in handy so I can use it on Killers I do enjoy playing.
---
I never bought characters with auric cells so I guess ur right
---
Awesome!
---
Fyi for my European fellows, that will be at 20:00 (or 8pm for who prefer to say it that way).
---
That's what I'm waiting for lol
---
Pallet town, a killers worst nightmare.
---
Alexi didn't deserve what he got
---
That'll never happen, they lost the legal battle a long time ago and can't ever update the game anymore because of it unless it's just like bug fixes and patches. Friday the 13th is now officially done for.
---
Holy shit a perk that lets you see your own scratch marks! I've been wanting that since the beginning!
---
This sounds amazing all these perks sound awesomeeee. Makes me now even more excited for the DLC even though I thought I couldn‚Äôt get more excited!!!
---
lol epic toast
---
Ahh having a great time with friends and chill games. Miss those times
---
It's so annoying that all conversation immediately shuts down when the killer decides to bail. Wanted to applaud a teammate for a masterful hook save during EGC against a Doctor with NoED and a mori, but the killer immediately ragequit the lobby once the game was over and i didn't have a chance to.
---
It's just general matchmaking. You'll see high ranks while at a low rank and vice versa, but you're much more likely to encounter event lower ranks as you start ranking up.
---
I hope one of the perk is called babysitter
---
I'm gonna lick his fingers
---
Darn! I knew I missed something. And peaches come to think of it!
---
Youre best off just buying the chapters, Halloween DLC has one of the best perks as the other commenter said. Otherwise just save up your shards to buy non licensed DLC survivors and/or their perks from the shrine of secrets.
---
If youre ONLY going to play survivor and have 0 interest in playing killer, then just buy auric cells and buy the licensed survivors that you want. 
---
Also the Huntress/David DLC is free, so grab that when you can if you havent already
---
Wait so you were watching their stream while playing? Meaning you knew exactly where they were and what they were doing at all times?
---
Isnt that somewhere between extremely unethical and outright cheating? How are you gonna do this and then complain someone use a cheap, borderline cheating tactic against you?? 
---
Sounds like a double standard to me lol
---
That's a bit dumb
---
Pls say it won't really be someone from stranger Things WHY DO THEY HAVE TO BE MAINSTREAM?!?? Carry on with them 80s killers, survs or bring out OG bhv content
---
He's just kinda annoying to play against. His power is he runs slightly faster sometimes. Kind of boring. At least he has some counter play now.
---
You got what you deserved that game i think. He wouldnt have had camped you if you didnt run OoO. Take adrenaline next time so you can scream t o x i c while the killer begins to cry because your running to the exit Gates.
---
Disappointed that his power isn't throwing trash around and then eating some of it to assert dominance.
---
*[Reloads bottle with malicious intent]*
---
They‚Äôve done that before with Bill. All of Bill‚Äôs perks were baseline for console and everyone had to level him up to get the teachables back. This is totally within the devs reach especially since David‚Äôs chapter is free.
---
Community is toxic as fuck, just leave now.
---
I am actually pansexual
---
What would his powers be to transform into other killers
---
Yeah they were all baseline. I‚Äôm not saying it wouldn‚Äôt happen just that i personally wouldn‚Äôt enjoy it unless i get the bp back i spent on getting the perk which would most likely be removed.
---
But that means that Alien would an actual option to be considered
---
Yo fuck you mate xd
---
I get the feeling they're just another toxic player who's avoided Stranger Things because its popular
---
You just had to cite very specific loadouts with their respective strongest addons in game to make your point.  I'm talking base kit vs. Base kit no addons none of your pinks or purples you just had to default to to even have a point at all.  Base kit none of those killers reliably and consistently start each chase off with a free kit.  Not against competent survivors who rotate their cameras and always know where the killer is coming from.  Base kit no addons Legion sees you, approaches you, hits ability aims and gets free hit.  It is different.  I know you guys desperately want me to be wrong on this but just take a step back from mindless mob mentality and look at the comparison objectively.
---
Yup, did exactly this yesterday.
---
Why are they booing you? You are right!
---
I feel like its extremely profitable for both parties.
---
DBD players are more likely to want to watch stranger things, and stranger things fine could be tempted to try out DBD.
---
Yep, especially with how season 3 ended.
---
Idk, this is the best image I could find of them (granted I didn't search for long since it's just a shitpost)
---
It's for mindgaming. If the perk also makes you walk faster than you can see exactly where your scratch marks lead, and can walk faster when you stop running in a loop area. You can also see whether or not they are still visible when the killer comes to your area.
---
thank you!
---
AND IM...haha.. I DON'T KNOW
---
Finally, we have a Dwight killer
---
Some people arent worth understanding
---
I have all killer perks but i wish i could live the happineds they live :/
---
Yeah, it's always the survivors that are salty until the killers get a Haddonfield/Swamp offering or get into a lobby with multiple people running Adrenaline, Decisive and Borrowed Time.
---
Their ranking system is a mess for a tons of reasons, but they don't work on that they make new comestics instead.
---
nah fortnite took him first
---
Do you play ps4? You could play with us sometime
---
U never saw the PTB ranking system/matchmaking lol
---
Getting hit 3 times granted you the invincibility on the 4th hit, they changed it to taking hits for other players OR safe unhooks, then changed it to taking hits for other players only. The detection for a protection hit is really finicky and basically is making you go out of your way to get hit and waste time chasing the killer for something youre likely not going to activate
---
Like fuck letting people live. Too many fingers to let leave
---
demogorgon is light sensitive according to the show. it doesn't need eyes.
---
Oh yes because I want to look good while I'm being smashed by 4 rank 1s
---
Oh that‚Äôs very kind. I do have friends still to play with, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve now become a good player and every game I just feel like I need to try my ass off lol. I‚Äôm pretty competitive while I get good at something xD
---
That's what a lot of dead OoO users say.
---
Imagine running that demogorgon perk with pgtw
---
Didn‚Äôt bother to ever grind out bubba and now I never will
---
There really aren't that many crutches in the game.  People misuse that word so hard.  Survivors have keys, instaheal and comms, killers have NOED, moris, and Prayer Beads.  That's about the extent of the crutch comparison.
---
He'll probably play killer eventually and then complain about not having bbq.
---
I watched it afterwards. I'm too lazy to be concentrating on both MY game and audio and listening to the stream at the same time. I just watch them afterwords for a post-match review of how the round went, any mistakes I might have made, what the survivors were thinking, how the survivor pulled a houdini in a loop, and the level of coordination I was dealing with as well as what I could have done differently, etc. 
---
I don't stream-snipe mid-round.
---
PC gets a testing period for the DLC, so if you heard something like it being delayed for console, its probably that. But yeah all DLC final release is the same day unless theres an issue (PS4 has gotten DLC early and late, Xbox has been delayed a day or two for a chapter, etc)
---
BBQ and Chili? Yes please
---
Game is going full-on pay2win and people will defend it untill their last breath, with the obnoxious combination of fanboy and dbd-player I feel like those are just conversations I rather not have.
---
Screw BQQ I need Discordance
---
Scoops outfit or riot
---
Ah yes, I too have a dog with a generator as their stomach
---
Join the dark side, we have cookies.

Honestly those demogorgon perks seem kinda eh  early on but great later so kinda balances it out but the second one especially seems situational. Also the phrase he can teleport around and just that is um worrying? Not that it's a bad ability for the demogorgon but we already got the hag which does that Freddy also with generators and technically Nurse considering she blinks to locations. Nancy's scratch mark perk is what I've always wanted so I'm definitely leveling her up for it.
---
Henny
---
Fair enough.
---
Is there a way to get the meg mask on console (PS4)?
---
Probably because they played the game once and the mean killer killed them. Or maybe it was the toxic survivors who dared to survive against them. Who knows.
---
Flashlights in general are fairly shitty vs good killers.
---
Nancy‚Äôs perks seem really cool and unique, I can‚Äôt wait to see her last one.
---
How long did it take? This was my first time getting all 8k
---
Wraith: bingbongboi
---
Legion: it's fucking legion
---
Shape: Meyer Mickles or Mickle Meyers
---
If he healed before he wouldn't be at the healthy state, he would be injured.
---
Pretty sure it only gets used when you down not hook someone so technically it's a negative as it could deny Pop if they don't work on a generator
---
These sound like some very interesting perks. I can't wait to see them in action.
---
It's either try to reveal him and take a chance on getting exposed or try to hide and getting hit. Either way nobody will change my mind that something needs to be done about that aspect of Ghostface
---
wait, is the teleportation the demogorgon does not even a fucking ability, its a perk?
---
Oh sorry. I forgot how handicap is used. My bad
---
Better bust out clown
---
I wasn't gonna buy one character just for a perk. Even a near essential perk like BBQ. I buy characters that are interesting to me. That's all. I don't buy characters for their perks. This may come across as disrespectful, but I'm not a tryhard to to do that, buy a character just to get a perk to make the game easier.
---
Ash is a good example. Yes Mettle of Man was a great perk when he was first released and now it's been nerfed into the ground. But, I still would buy Ash even with his 3 garbage perks because it's Ash. I don't care about Bubba as a character so I'd never buy him, even though he has BBQ. The only characters I've purchased are Ash and the Saw chapter. I will also buy Stranger Things so long as BHVR doesn't pull some fuckery and charge a ridiculous amount for it. And I buy those packs/characters because I like the characters, that's all.
---
Yeah.. Taking away a single item would just be the end of us. /s 
---
But gotta remember we have exhaustion add ons for killers too, rendering perks useless. Same with Franklin's if you forget exactly where you got hit or just hope to come across some other dude's dropped item. Insta downs like iridescent head huntess, infinite t3 meyers, exposed statuses and the like which render popping an insta heal that isn't syringe useless assuming your team is coordinated enough in the first place. A few other things in the game too that make others completely useless.
---
you have posted this on @r/leaksbydaylight ?
---
IT'S CALLED A LIGHTBURN AND IT'S ALREADY A MECHANIC THAT FITS THE CHARACTER
---
Now i'm confused too ü§£ü§£
---
Be careful pretty sure it‚Äôs haunted
---
I like the mix we get.  Plague was definitely a miss to me though.  Hardly ever see Plagues anymore, and I don‚Äôt touch her unless I have a ritual.
---
Big brain trapper main here with one easy trick to ruin this plan
---
r/eyebleach
---
My current favorite spirit build uses BBQ, Haunted Grounds, Thrill of the Hunt, and Ruin. I know I know, it‚Äôs a lot of totems, but that‚Äôs the thing, with this build you don‚Äôt even play for gens, you only patrol totems. It doesn‚Äôt have much patrolling anyways because with 4 glowing totems on the map survivors WILL find them quickly. That‚Äôs ok though because thrill gives you a notification and slows down the cleansing process of totems. Plus, if you don‚Äôt make it to your totem you‚Äôve got a 50/50 split that it‚Äôs haunted for the first totem cleansed. I‚Äôve had incredible success with this build, 4K, 5 genning groups as low as killer rank 6. Beyond that it starts to fall apart a little bit because well, red ranks are another story.
---
Either
---
What buff do you think leatherface needs
---
You've gotta be kidding me I bought and started leveling Leatherface 2 days ago!
---
I havent watched up to season 3 so i dont have any good predictions for that.  I doubt they would add a beer drinking perk as that would tick off the rating people.
---
The key to getting it for me was slugging against a team of 3 dead hards so chases were long, downs were aplenty, deviousness through the roof.
---
Pretty sure it's just the phrasing as it's Google translated or whatever into English meaning it got messed up somewhere because it doesn't say perk just it can teleport across the map giving a description like the other first lines.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôre right, I didn‚Äôt realise he went to full health. That is pretty ridiculous lol
---
inb4 Doctor worldwide.
---
if the killer isn't brain damaged you literally will not get an angle to use it.
---
But what if you don‚Äôt like stranger things then you really want to kill him
---
Yeah they didnt make ghostface to what he should have been. They were really lazy programming him.
---
That would honestly be really cool
---
Even more malicious intent
---
He used to be my my train I rode on until purple ranks. It was a blast. I cheer for his rework and look forward for more engaging gameplay.
---
I learned to just tunnel and camp the teabagers and toxic ones. always fun at the end of the game to see the salt about me being toxic.
---
Well , they're free after all
---
Only thing I don't really like is the perks being locked behind a paywall. Yes Ik shrines a thing but it takes a silly amount of waiting for that to happen. Just look at bbq. Everyone freaked out when that came back.
---
You know Paris, France? In English, it's pronounced "Paris" but everyone else pronounces it without the "s" sound, like the French do. But with Venezia, everyone pronouces it the English way: "Venice". Like The Merchant of Venice or Death in Venice. WHY, THOUGH!? WHY ISN'T THE TITLE DEATH IN VENEZIA!? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!? IT TAKES PLACE IN ITALY, SO USE THE ITALIAN WORD, DAMMIT! THAT SHIT PISSES ME OFF! BUNCH OF DUMBASSES
---
Just a reminder that kira in the dub said "And as soon as I saw it." I got a rock hard c*ck."
---
Also "What a beautiful duwang!"
---
In lower ranks, higher up you just get bullied. ;_;
---
Ace's outfit costs 1,080 auric cells or 21,600 iridescent shards.
---
Nurse's outfit costs 1,080 auric cells.
---
Dead Meat suggested video... I see you are a man of culture as well!
---
Responding all at once, so again, never touched a single trap, just looped for 3 gens. I'm not upset. I had a blast getting chased. Who wants to sit on a gen? That's why I run ooo. Hey you, killer, if you're looking for survivors I'm a survivor! Chase me. But somehow I get face camped for making your job easier. Great chase though :)!
---
They can't just give us a F13 chapter. That license is a shitshow.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to be called ‚Äúuseless‚Äù for running the killer around for 3 gens and getting facecamped.
---
Didnt josuke also say "make everybody happy"
---
The most malicious intent but I also don‚Äôt play killer so I guess I‚Äôll just sand bag him
---
Disconnect first.
---
Have malicious intent 
---
but don‚Äôt be rude
---
This would be hilariously OP. 
---
Now I want this soooo badly lol
---
You follow their ‚Äúrules‚Äù and they will still flame you in post game. That‚Äôs why I literally play however I want, nothing will change
---
Lol i literally just leveled bubba to bbq an chilli the day before the shrine of secrets reset, fml.
---
So that's how Wraith works, huh.
---
Probably an entitled surv or killer main mad they couldn‚Äôt win every game in a row
---
Fine I‚Äôm just excited for six perks
---
I feel like replacing stalking with legion fast vaults  but keeping the stealth aspect would be great
---
Clem or nothing
---
Hag 2.0 anyone?
---
What is this some sort of peasant joke I'm too rich to understand? I bought it 3 times buddies. 1.Bubba blood web 2.shrine 3 months ago 3. Shrine yesterday
---
Introducing the new survivor: BEN! Never going to be played for some reason just like Quentin
---
Like others have said, ruin is a great crutch that allows you to have control over the game while it lasts, but I think the most important thing about killer is knowing when to give up a chase. Most teams will have survivors who aren‚Äôt good at looping, find and target them and get the ones who can loop when they go for saves. Other than that, patience and just lots of games are required to improve. With MM try to get tier 3 almost filled up and only active it when you know you‚Äôll get a down. Having people hooked while in tier 3 can provide a pretty big snowball effect.
---
+1 on Spine Chill, that's one of my go to survivor perks! Very helpful to know when the killer is semi close and facing your direction, it can definitely get you a jump on escaping.
---
He probably did, honestly I watched all of it in subbed. I only watched certain scenes in english to have a good laugh. This one in paticular made me laugh hard due to the fact D.C. Douglas is Kira. Which is the voice actor of  Wesker from Resident Evil 5.
---
Guess I'm hoping back in tonight. Haven't played in months but I gotta prepare.
---
I'm not a fan of most of the english VAs but damn does Douglas fit well for kira
---
Lowkey sounds like a worse urban evasion depending on how much faster you walk compared to the base speed.
---
Game starts ,give the killer a nod, start on gen and wait until the decide to chase. No chase, on to next gen. I'm literally using it to make your job easier. "I'm just supposed to let them escape"? "I'm not allowed to use a perk against a killer it might hinder"? "Remember kids, it's not camping if the exit gates are open"
---
It would be cool if the flashlight forced the Demogorgon to focus on the survivor carrying it. It doesn‚Äôt blind the Demogorgon but locks the killers cam on flashlighting survivors for a few seconds. Still dropping the survivors once fixated as well. Rather than disgust the reaction is anger. 
---
I don‚Äôt play this game but I watch streamers play as a means of entertainment. It would be nice to see new strategies in the game.
---
Here in Italy a famous dbd twitcher (zeb89) created some nicknames for the killers for example the pig is "la maiala de tu ma" (literally your mum is a pig. Pig is meant to be translated as "hoe" or "bitch"), another nickname is for the hillbilly. In Italy he's called "mandriano" that is similar to another Italian world:"mandolino",the sound is similar, butz the meaning is completely different, infact "mandriano" means hillbilly, while the "mandolino" is a musical instrument. Leatherface  is called "Dov'√® il bagno?" (Where is the toilette?) because he walks like he is retaining a huge shit.
---
Ironically playing the blonde guy who wants a quiet life lmao. Instead of a blonde guy with "superior DNA!"
---
I agree that he‚Äôs a lot like a much worse Plague. At least Plague has layers to her power and the ranged down capability you mentioned. She also doesn‚Äôt get stunned when she missed or when she hits someone and her ability isn‚Äôt as laughable. Honesty I see the rework approach being what they decide to do. I don‚Äôt think his power is very good nor was it very good before.
---
Hell, I'm in it for the map alone! The idea of a map that shifts and changes like that sounds like a lot of fun!
---
I love the perk ideas too, and I think the mythological aesthetic is a nice addition to the genre. I do see how the Bull's power might be a little problematic though, because it's quite similar to Billy's, although I'm not sure how you could tweak it to make it different. Maybe something along the lines of how a Minotaur is an expert of the maze he's in? Perhaps instead of a traditional charge, when you activate the power a mini-map comes up and you draw his charge path, then set him loose on it? Adds unpredictability on survivor end because they won't know which spot might be safe.
---
I had a look at their other reviews, they‚Äôre all like this so I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs satire
---
So we can do this about anything in the game
---
360ing effectively is probably the most advanced tactic a survivor can learn
---
He didn't like it, apparently
---
I'm not like a wall at all.  I listened to your point, it was a poorly made one that relied on the strongest and rarest addons for those specific characters to get that free hit that Legion can get everytime. It's not even no addons it's literally those insanely specific addons you had to list that can even support your point.  Use literally any other addons and it completely falls apart.  I feel like I made a very clear logical point in a straight killer vs. Killer comparison Legion is nearly guaranteed a free starting hit the other kills aren't unless running your incredibly specific and rare combination of addons.  I'm not going to agree just because a few presumably inexperienced players say the same wrong thing.  I made a clear concise point you guys didn't.  Downvotes don't change that.  I play rank 1 on both sides and have for years.  I understand this game incredibly well which makes me confident I have more to offer on this topic than some of those responding who I can tell are basing their opinions off playing inferior killers and survivors.  I'm not even partial to Legion he is just one of the killers in my rotation I play everyone except Nurse, Huntress and Spirit.  Admitting a weaker killer has one thing he's objectively better at than other killers (starting chases off with an immediate first hit) doesn't make me biased or partial towards Legion.
---
Won‚Äôt find the angle and timing isn‚Äôt necessary cause the killer will look around and chase anyone close enough to save. Easy counter. It‚Äôs when you‚Äôre too eager to pick them up that makes the save, has almost nothing to do with skill
---
Not really sure tbh. People don't like losing. Hurts their ego too much.
---
I BOUGHT BUBBA LITERALLY A FEW DAYS AGO NOW BBQ IS ON THE SHRINE.
---
IM NOW USING HIM AND JUST M1 FRANKLINS DEMISE'ING OUT OF ANGER
---
CAN YOU SPEAK UP PLEASE
---
which has nothing to do with Discordance
---
Yeah, when I'm your 1st and only hook with 2 gens left...we like to whisper you sweet nothings since you're right up in our grill.
---
Not that good at plague, but I can offer some tips, you wanna get them broken, but don't choose vomiting over hitting, (same for doctor) if you can get a hit, go for it. Also, at higher ranks you want get alot of people cleansing, so take advantage of that at try to down more than one person at once
---
Newer player so I don‚Äôt understand what you mean. You have the perk already and our get blood points because it‚Äôs in the shrine?
---
Looks like they will miss the end of summer date for dedicated servers then.
---
They also mention a stealth part in his ability, just saying.
---
Don't play nurse
---
No-brainer version of dead hard with speed boost, random chase breaker and "imma make this tile a 30 second+ loop with no effort"?
---
What the hell were you thinking about when making those? Oh wait...
---
&gt; Makes 3 trash perks which are hexes on top of that for killer and 3 plain broken perks for survivor
---
When did you play killer last time?
---
Killer: Pennywise
---
Unique Power: Annoying Clown - Your uncanny ability to move shakily at quick speeds like that‚Äôs scary or something makes you hostile. When charged you see the auras of each survivor who hasn‚Äôt yet been hooked for 3/4/6 seconds. When all survivors have been hooked once, increase your movement speed by 4%
---
Perk 1: Reboot - A solid domestic box office return stimulates your overrated senses. Survivors‚Äô repair, heal, sabotage, and search actions become 8/9/10 % louder to your swollen dumb head.
---
Perk 2: Irreplaceable - Despite Tim Curry never being outdone, you‚Äôre forced to perform savage acts for a new audience. You become obsessed with one survivor. Each time you reveal your obsession, gain 5/7/9 % increase to bloodpoints.
---
Hex: We All Float Down Here - A hex rooting its power to the fearful. Any survivors within 6 meters of the generator furthest from you are revealed until this hex is destroyed.
---
14. As a shy introvert. I guess not
---
I'm getting 300,000
---
But we've had so many evil people, and I'm not even talking about the entity twisted ones, we've just had Clown, Legion, and Ghostface. Sure I guess being a person is more immersive and can have stories, but a monster is some fun diversity.
---
Just simply a lack of interest in the show, nothing more
---
It feels like this is a perk you *don't* pair with borrowed time though
---
? You literally heal 2 tiers by yourself, which is essentially Unbreakable + Self Heal - all the time it takes for those perks to heal you. That's stronger than the original DS haha.
---
Idk what your last sentence even means, how is healing from the injured state the same as healing from dying state to healthy in one second?
---
Someone who just blindly downvotes and calls people insane for what they think(That‚Äôs the community majority opinion) then can‚Äôt explain how they‚Äôre not in a bad place when you try to say ‚Äúthey get an easy first hit‚Äù which tons of killers already do and then what about securing that down? Oh right he‚Äôs got nothing. Bye Mr Wall. It‚Äôs not a discussion when you use insults to try and argue a point. ‚ÄúYou made your point very badly‚Äù what a condescending bag of fun to deal with lmfao no wonder why everyone disagrees with you when you speak like a twat to people.
---
You guys going camping? *Laughs in Borrowed Time*
---
150000 more blood points am I right?
---
How'd you mori two people with an ivory?
---
Steve's perks sound like they'd be perfect for rank reset when my teammates are potatoes and doing gens, you?
---
If I can give them boosts of some kind myself to help them then maybe I won't lose all my low rank matches.
---
But if you down someone after you hook
---
I found a Laurie that jumped in a basement locker, I put down a downing trap in front of said locker, she never came out.
---
Oh! That‚Äôs interesting. I didn‚Äôt know that. Is it a set amount of BP, or does it vary depending on the perk?
---
whack
---
Hacked jk
---
Bled to death couldn‚Äôt find him lol
---
Adrenaline surge might not be the most OP but I don‚Äôt wanna see it in the game
---
Luck as a While is a worse RNG lithe
---
Spirit Shield could be okay if the cool down was a lot longer
---
Alright, thank you
---
nah, Sounds unfun for everyone
---
Lol I read every comment and didn't downvote anything blindly.  You literally just blindly downvoted my previous response.  You admitted yourself you didn't read it lol!  Jesus you're a hypocrite.  Tons of killers do not get an easy first hit.  Not at red ranks.  You aren't showing anything to support your statements while I did.  I insulted you?  How and when?  You insulted me multiple times already lol.  Again hypocrite please look up the word dude.  You've clearly shown you have nothing of substance to offer here.  It's simply statements with zero factual support to back them up and insults.  You got nothing to offer.  Let's just call it a day.  You've shown your hand several messages ago.
---
Not really, because at the end of the day survivors are still just skins. I'm still excited for them, just not as much as having a new killer to use.
---
Try using thrill of the Hunt
---
IT'S EVEN BETTER WHEN YOU SEE THEM SELF CARING OR BEING IMMERSED WHEN YOU'RE ABOUT TO STUGGLE OR ARE STRUGGLING.
---
I buy licensed but save shards and it's because it gives me a goal in the game. To be honest sometimes this game can be a bit boring when you've already grinded for everything you need in all your builds. I like to have something else to grind for!
---
what? doesn't every single Hex perk dim out when its totem is broken?
---
This is a thing already? If you‚Äôre affected by a hex and it gets cleansed it‚Äôs removed from your HUD
---
It's been my dream to loop killers as Steve The Hair Harrington.
---
Welcome, on this side we have killer mains who run ruin, NOED, BBQ &amp; Chili, and nurse's calling and a mori on P3 Nurse and complain about mettle of man I guess and on the other we have survivor mains who run mettle of man, DS, Self care, and Urban evasion and a purple flashlight with two battery addons on P3 claudette and complain about ruin, NOED, and the DS nerf
---
Next week in ptb? Hell no they are going to be bringing all their good toys so ptb usually gets no mercy from me, but I don't try hard I'm not that much of a sweaty monster.
---
Now when it comes to going live then sure, but I doubt I'll get any new players at rank 10.
---
It's super risky though. If you aren't in a chase once a gen pops that's one of the 5 potential uses of it wasted. Granted 30 seconds seems pretty long. We'll have to wait and see what it is tomorrow.
---
*eats survivor* IT'S RAW
---
Show us an empty space in the shrine you pussy.
---
Is Boxcombed Bell toxic on Wraith?
---
Yes and no, ashe for example is also still alive. Entity just takes them after everything
---
whitesupremacisttron
---
I don‚Äôt really care about either/or tbh. Stranger Things isn‚Äôt my favorite.
---
Holy shit, it sounds like u/rgb-queiroz was really close with his "Nancy Drew" perk idea!
---
PGTW only works if you kick a gen. If this perk just causes normal regression on nearby gens when you down someone it wouldn't let you kick them since they are regressing, effectively making it a bad choice to run them together.
---
made with mematic
---
What people mean by it doesn't fit in with the lore is that all the killers are as much a prison of the Fog as the survivors. Everyone is human, and stuck in the same endless purgatory to feed the Entity--How does an actual monster fit into that?
---
Probably pretty easily.
---
See that would be pretty useful. Just depends on how the math breaks down.
---
Noted.
---
Finally got Bloodpoints and chilli :D
---
i just bought it with a level 34 bubba, i am such a fucking idiot
---
I'm liking the sound of the demgorgon perks. It might actually end up top tier. 
---
They chapter is gonna be legendary, I can tell already.
---
Careful... the mods don‚Äôt like it when you post photos of what actually happens in DBD lol
---
I'm definitely going to make other killers!
---
He's not talking just about the game
---
I've seen this comment everywhere lol, I dont understand what the joke is behind it Haha.
---
My buddy has 4000+ hours on tf2
---
Oh ok
---
It was the hardest choice I ever made in any game ever. And even tho I'm 28 old man, my eyes are getting wet every time I reminded of it.
---
same
---
It's not a movie but a show called "Breaking Bad"
---
I don't speak for anyone other then myself. Ooo is telling you that whenever your ready, I'm ready. Play to win if you want. I only do gens because a survivor may have a perfect chase. I'd rather just get chased and watch people get chased. Fuck gens. I'm saying killers have their rule book too and rule #1 is I have to win! No matter what. Camp the hook, gotta win. My favorite one: glitched out while vaulting a window and teleport back, free hit. Let ds timer run out, gotta win. Just top notch talent there bud. Win your game.
---
^ Laurie mains when you don‚Äôt even use decisive strike and get slugged anyway
---
9 times out of 10 as a survivor i‚Äôd honestly prefer you hit me and slug me while you go after the unhooker so the guy who farmed me without BT gets an unsafe unhook. they shouldn‚Äôt be rewarded for farming in the killer‚Äôs eyeballs and i always think of it as a way of punishing them for bad play while still giving me a chance to get picked up by a teammate or use unbreakable.
---
activate your Windows!
---
And funny how no one in a rank 15 game is an actual beginner, looking at those builds. Rank reset, truly is amazing
---
Where I live it's not allowed either (have to be 15-16) yet I have worked during vacations and weekends since I was 11 so...
---
I don't have any other perks other than his but I'm not refunding him because:
---
1. I can't. 
---
2. I still have fun playing with him.
---
Err, it is fair enough because I can admit when I make a mistake. One small part of the whole thing wasn't correct. Big woop.
---
Cet+1, so most of Europe.
---
Choo-choo seems a bit too strong with his already considerable map pressure from the lockers.
---
Ah yes, I am doing that as well! 
---
Someone recently suggested devotion levels should allow you a BP bank and that‚Äôs just been buzzing in my head ever since. :P
---
I think it‚Äôs similar to the nurse fatigue stun
---
Wah wah I‚Äôm a survivor main and I want free escapes
---
Me and my friends call Wraith Sininho (little bell in portuguese), and we read Myers name as we read in portuguese, so we call him ‚ÄúMixael‚Äù basically. Also we call the clown Paia√ßo (misspelling of Palha√ßo, clown in portuguese)
---
It does seem like one of those "punish the other side for doing their job well" perks. Which is never really a good thing. I gotta see the numbers, range, etc. To make a final call on it though
---
You can do both....
---
That's cool that they did that but does that mean you had to spend 100 hours painstakingly going through blood webs???
---
The lore is that the killers were all human at some point and the Entity corrupted them/took advantage of the fact they were corrupt. People are right when they say it doesn't fit in with the lore of the game.
---
Not having vaults is huge tho, a lot of maps rely heavily on windows. Imagine you are getting chased, about to vault and then a gen pops.
---
Plus it's something the killer nor the survivor have any control over, so sometimes it will be an absolute waste, otherwise it can completely mess you up.
---
Plus it's 30 seconds!!! Why introduce such an uninteractive perk? What's the counterplay to it?
---
One of us! One of us! One of us!
---
Ya. I like new people to play with. Kinda. Bothered me we got two licensed killers back to back
---
Yeah that's what I noticed too
---
I didn't realize that the Demogorgon from DnD was so... bushy
---
I don't have ruin but I can try something else
---
Hahaha. Thank you for the laughs.
---
Even if it did work you'll have to make sure people actually touched the gens
---
You said you were done a while ago and here you are replying.  Jesus you must be bored lol.  Again hypocrite please look it up dude this is getting painful. Jesus I thought you moved on instead you came here to blatantly lie about me not supporting my claims of Legion reliably and consistently beginning chases with a free first hit.  You claim I provided nothing to support this when all you have to do is actually go back and read my comments where I detail exactly how he gets those hits, what you have to do to ensure said free hit and why the other killers mentioned previously don't get that same free hit Legion is known for nearly as consistently or reliably.  Stop pretending I didn't say things I did.  It makes you not only a hypocrite but a liar as well.  It's a bad look dude.
---
It blows my mind just how cheap video games are  nowadays. You can go have a fancy dinner and spend say 60 dollars and be happy for one night, or you could buy a triple a game for the same price and be happy for possibly even hundreds of hours. Heck I spent 20 dollars on dbd and just hit 1600 hours, over 3 years of enjoyment. People go to these bs coffee places and blow 5 bucks everyday but a 5 dollar dlc is just too much.
---
Now of course there are always circumstances so I don't mean to offend but this is generally the way it goes.
---
It's 2000 shards for 150000 BP. Which requires a lot more time than just getting those points through gameplay. So not really free.
---
Welcome dude! Look out for toxic players!!! Just dont mind them and play the game for fun! Im sure a lot of people would like to help u become a better player! I would love to do so myself but im also pretty new so ;) Good luck on your journey to either defeat the entity or help it!
---
Eh, ya know, classic case of ~~dummies~~ people thinking it's equal to disagreeing with someone. It doesn't really bother me. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  
---
But cheers, I appreciate the gesture.
---
#pornhub üòÇ
---
He should be able to eat Grilled Charlies to gain temporary speed boosts
---
Thats not really salty lol hes just trolling you.
---
Can definitely see it stalling games immensely on killers who can find and down quickly like Hillbilly if it works with non-M1 hits.
---
Wow, one of the Steve perks is pretty identical to the perk some fan did a few days ago, specifically this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cs2kkc/this\_is\_my\_original\_creation\_about\_a\_survivor\_id/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cs2kkc/this_is_my_original_creation_about_a_survivor_id/) ("Stay safe")... Well... I really hope they will add that survivor at least, because she seems pretty cool...
---
It‚Äôs likely not gonna happen since Jason has a video game already
---
If you were browsing by new you'd see a shit storm, mostly yesterday and before but you might still find a post about someone hating it.
---
Don‚Äôt finish gens while survivors are in chase easy
---
Well if you're thinking about that Laurie is definitely alive and well but she is in Entity's realm aswell?Same goes for Ash
---
So what's the difference of it I'm healthy 100% 
---
What's the point? Is it buff.
---
Honestly, I dont see a lot of entitled killers out there. Might be biased, as I'm a killer main, but I just accept that bad games happen.
---
Those survivors just wind each other up, like when a neighborhood dog starts barking and then suddenly postgame chat is just a bunch of nonsensical bullshit whining.
---
I had one survivor the other day after a brutal 4k tell me I didnt win because you dont win by killing everyone.
---
I mean, what?
---
I think your frustration is not winning everytime all the time. Do you not enjoy the chase? You want to sneak from one hook to that gen and insta down and repeat? That's basically target practice. The surv is giving you free knowledge. Hit that mf twice and be done with it. Just like these people said. I AM AGREEING WITH THEM, barely. Chase the surv put them on the hook move one. The whole tunnel thing is just salt. Don't tunnel because they got lucky and used a good perk against you. That's what balanced means.
---
No
---
Bit off topic. But I want her to sit on my face.
---
My teammates are cleansing
---
&gt;By not playing ~~nurse~~ *the game at all*
---
Seriously, people DC for no reason, all the time. Just yesterday I had two survivors DC and I was a Scratched Mirror Myers on the fucking *CORNFIELD MAP!* And I always play fair, so I didn't give them a reason to DC.
---
It's one of the biggest problems with this game, luckily it'll kind of get fixed soon with the DC husk idea.
---
Calling other morons while carrying so much about stupid unimportant shit. Hmm...
---
well your thoughts are wrong, upvoting anyways
---
Also please please link your stream.  I need to see this elite player for myself.  I have an idea in my head what your play looks like but I'd love to see it if you stream all your games.
---
Hey, so I'm native with german. The article mentions the teleportation and a stealth mode as parts of the power of the Monster.
---
The Steve perk is Buckle Up but with extra steps
---
Where'd you hear this? The gen kicking one would be nuts on a 3-gen doc.
---
Dude I grinded for that the first time it came.  Probably played a shit ton not to miss it.
---
Don‚Äôt watch the show, how old is she?
---
I love Reddit
---
100% I just wanted to show it happens on both ends.
---
I was so mad that evil ash wasn't included as a killer. Like, you had such an opportunity and you wasted it, Behavior!
---
Weird, few months ago I suggested a buff to wglf on the official forum that was exactly what Steve's perk do.
---
Ur from usa?
---
It would've been cool but it would've just missed the point of having stranger things in the game. They could've done barb as a survivor and sure some people would've been happy but it would be like, why them? The demogorgon is the most well known villain of the entire show.
---
Yeah some people just can't handle being dominated by someone else. And in their heads it's always the other person's fault for them getting downed so when they DC they think they're resolving some form of imagined injustice.
---
Why doesn‚Äôt the lore make sense? Sorry I‚Äôm new here lol. But I thought the entity just kinda stole all the characters to his realm so couldn‚Äôt they be from any horror fandom really?
---
Nah, Canada.
---
I knew someone would make this eventually.
---
I don't watch either. She is legal.
---
Pinhead would be awesome too. I think the joker would be really neat but I don‚Äôt know if they could add him.
---
Good to know
---
This is next level garbage, you never played killer I see
---
I TRIED PLAYING FREDDY LAST NIGHT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND I GOT MATCHED AGAINST TWO RED RANKS WITH THEIR RANK 20 FRIENDS AND THEY BULLIED ME FOR NOT KNOWING HOW TO PLAY FREDDY OR HAVING FREDDY LEVELED UP AND IT DISCOURAGED ME FROM WANTING TO MAIN FREDDY. THEY KEPT FLASHLIGHT SPAMMING ME AND BODY BLOCKING AND TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME AND IT REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS.
---
I think 17 is still too young for BHVR
---
Similar to how new perks cost a little more shards, they give more bp, but thats just for perks in the currently newest chapter. I don't remember the exact numbers
---
He's just memeing not being salty
---
Okay but get this. What if the gen kicking perk works with PGTW? Or any other gen kicking perks. That would be heaven. I doubt it does though.
---
I JUST BOUGHT BBQ AND CHILLI AND I DONT KNOW HOW TO GET IT BC I'M NEW
---
As a shy, introverted (and also autistic) 17 year old who‚Äôs had a job since he was 15, I disagree. I got a job washing dishes and, as uncomfortable as it was for me to get to know the kitchen staff, I got to know them after a little while and that made it a lot easier.
---
Find yourself a job where you‚Äôre working with just a few people (like washing dishes) and it‚Äôs not as hard as you think.
---
Relax snowflakes, it's clearly a joke. Don't take it so personally kiddies. 
---
You can afford an xbox but not a $5 DLC? 
---
There FTFY
---
The article mentions that you run faster in german. So my guess would be a exhaustion perk with a passiv effect for now otherwise it's broken
---
Wait how is Myers better on console?
---
I know I have seen the Gen Obsession for Nancy somewhere once before. We will find out soon enough on Thursday or Tuesday at latest.
---
Giant T-posing Kenny in the distance would be too strong, we can't have it.
---
He has also a stealth mode mentioned in the article
---
All the time you were earning those shards,  you were also earning BP. So, on discount at worst.
---
Might be good with SB.
---
you don't need this.
---
Would work way better with overcharge then with pgtw
---
Yea if it worked with overcharge and PGTW it does look even greater for sure. If its at least 32M range i'd probably consider using it.
---
The devs have specifically said that all the killers had to have once been human and corrupted by the entity. Not just humanoid.
---
Does plagues puke make medkits useless ?
---
The source is a reliable gaming site in germany so it should be as accurate as the things C√¥te said during the Interview. Also the vault blocking don't work with gen completion but with downing instead
---
Bbq was finaly on the fookin table? Ive waited to long and just got se√±or autismo
---
so what's your way to do it? How'd you found a job?
---
IT WILL SHOW UP IN YOUR KILLER BLOODWEBS AT RANDOM
---
Hmmm lets ask Laurie and Quentin how they are doing, since, you know, they are explicitly the same exact age as S4 Clem. Clem is completely fair game at that point.
---
The blocking all windows and vaults seems underwhelming as it wouldn't affect pallets likely
---
This is wonderful and we need those.
---
I'd love to see a The walking dead character I mean hell its recent its a somewhat substantial franchise / property. Heck they could even make a zombie as a killer, but honestly I can't see a zombie being a killer in DBD
---
Frank: Charlie. He's my buddy. We sleep together. We hang out together. Once I pooped in the bed. I blamed it on him.¬†[laughs]¬†One time the guys got hooked on crack. It was really crazy. Well, they found a baby in a Dumpster. They wanted to make some money with the baby, but nobody would buy the baby because it was white. So they had to turn it brown. We were fighting over the sword. And just about when we were about to hit each other with the sword, Social Services came in, thought we were killing the baby.
---
Asian Tourist: I-I don't understand this tour.
---
Frank: Charlie wrote this musical. Oh, man, it was really funny. I played a troll on the musical. And it's called The Nightman Cometh. I could sing you my song, if you like. You gotta... you gotta pay the troll toll to get into this boy's hole. Yeah, and, uh... But you gotta pay to get in. I was saying, "soul." He thought I was saying, "boy's hole." One of the things I like doing most is banging whores. I, uh, I go out and bang a lot of whores. Listen, here's the thing. I'm going to have to jump off here. So you guys enjoy the rest of the tour on your own, okay?
---
Asian Tourist: How are we supposed to get back to our tour bus?
---
Frank: That's your problem. Welcome to Phill
---
It's part of the ability and just badly translated. Also he has a stealth mode mentioned in the article
---
What would be better? To cleanse or not to cleanse. Why do I keep hearing a strange noise. Like clanking metal
---
Is there a blank version of the template?
---
This only really works well with ruin because you have to give them an initial reason to search for totems. You could try something else but with nothing stopping them from quick gen progression this doesn‚Äôt really work that well.
---
It somewhat is, but not to 100%
---
**if u dint care u wuld not'nt post this xd**
---
Thanks for the extra information. Questions does the stealth ability more in depth also thanks for clearing up the perk stuff
---
Ooof
---
I was about to make the same observation about his appearance. I‚Äôd love to see Lee or Glenn added though!
---
We have how many killers with stealth abilities now? Ghostface,Pig, Micheal, isn't that a little too much stealth?
---
Oh fuck off and stop being such a damn delicate snowflake. Shy introvert? You‚Äôre not even fully developed yet. Stop being a sop
---
I'm going to be honest with you - it does really boil down to two things: who you enjoy, and whose perks you want. In terms of perks? Leatherface has one of the best perks in the game - BBQ and chili - but that's in the shrine right now for a week! I'd recommend looking through the perks for each DLC and gauging which DLC has the best perks for you, as well as weighing who you think you'd enjoy playing more. I'm sorry this isn't much help, but 'best value' does differ by person depending on your playstyle.
---
The clanking sound is her getting the black vomit, or it possibly running out.
---
The best strategy is not to cleanse because then she has to get close enough to hit you regularly. However, if you have teammates that are cleansing, you'll want to be healthy as much as possible.
---
Quentin, Ash and Laurie were all alive as well. Them being taken is only canon to DBD, and not canon to their actually franchises. Really a simple  answer, just think of DBD as having taken alternate universe versions of them.
---
Ah fair enough she and Quentin do look older than 17 to me I thought they were in their 20‚Äôs
---
Iron Grasp (only because i dont have bbq yet) whispers bitter murmur spies from the shadows
---
I like stealth abilities tbh so I don't mind. Also 4 killers out of 16 doesn't seem that much to me
---
I told 3 of my friends and my sister of the show and they loved it for some reason.
---
Why is it that survivors are 9 times out of 10 the toxic ones? Had a David teabag after he dropped a pallet on me.  I'm a fucking rank 15 Leatherface with no teachable perks!  No Ruin, no Enduring + Spirit Fury, I'm basically your team's bitch!  I'm not even running Noed, what the fuck do you think you're doing teabagging!?!?  I'm just an honest newbie Bubba desperately trying to get his bloodpoints!
---
Yes!
---
Either make his base saw charge faster, increase his movement speed while charging the saw, or increase his movement speed while sawing.
---
There is no reason to activate windows, you just gain some customizations and thats it
---
Let's hope for the best, right ? If not, Kate will probably forgive you :)
---
What dr 3 gen. I never heard of this tactic. How does it work
---
Oh my bad i need glasses i guess XD
---
I think the immerses claudettes will get the message when they are called useless dead
---
Survivor: starts tea bagging behind pallets*
---
Me: no No NO YOU WILL DIE!
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Honestly I run discordance on all of my killers
---
Play with you food is a good perk to go with Lf
---
Oh no how could i be so blind, dammit your right D:
---
yea I mean its not to bully low levels or anything like that. Thats not my style, and I would immediately go back up after getting it. Just the thought of doing it in high purple to red seems like a bad time.
---
I mean throwing onto hook sure carrying survivors weird also a problem with him being a foot tall might be a bit op
---
You can teleport over the map for demogorgon, that's not a perk, but their power (I speak german)
---
i got myers, ghostface, freddy, nancy, ash, and my demogorgon and leatherface are coming in the mail tomorrow
---
Exactly, such a godsend
---
I dont mind survivors getting skill checks to escape
---
They all seem unbalanced but your first one is literally old MoM on steroids.  It would become the top meta perk overnight.
---
This looks like it was fed through google translate a few times...
---
Yeah I get it, I just would consider it unsportsmanlike cause you would murk the purple ranks but no judgement really! Do what you gotta do haha
---
Barbecue is god tier because of the double bloodpoints if you hook everyone, it‚Äôs good for awareness on survivor location as well. You know if they are close or far away. Amazing for map awareness.
---
I had never played or seen DBD until this year when I stubbled upon it on twitch, it's now my favorite game to watch and play
---
Adrenaline surge just sounds like a buffed version of Metttle of men before its nerf?
---
I like the luck perk
---
Hey welcome my guy, hope you have a good time!
---
Adrenaline Surge is a second chance perk. it works for free but has a drawback. I'd make it so it can't activate while exhaused too so you can't use both Dead Hard and that thing in one chase
---
Luck as a Whole is an RNG based bonus exhaustionless Lithe. This should tell you why it's a bad idea
---
Spirit Shield is an idea I had once, but lasts twice as long and works on pallets. 9 seconds is too long and stopping the killer from kicking the pallet is a bad idea
---
*gets a weaved ring and milky glass on a broken key with ace in the hole*
---
It‚Äôs usually 2000 iri shards for 150000bp, but newly added perks are 2700 iri shards for 250000bp.
---
Y'all. It ain't that deep. Literally nothing about Bubba appeals to me besides BBQ and Chili. I don't think I'm 'sticking it to the man' by not buying his DLC, nor do I think \~$5 is that expensive. I just preferred to wait. I don't understand y'alls obsession with telling people who are patient enough to wait for the perks they want in the SoS even knowing it might take forever that 'you can jUs t b Uy thE d L c !!! It's N Oyt th AT m U ch!!!'. We're aware, thank you.
---
Did you really do this?
---
And rank 20 killers should shut up when it's obvious they don't know what they are talking about.
---
It's nothing compared to League of Legends for example.
---
yes
---
Getting a licensed skin for an already licensed killer? Doubt it‚Äôll happen but I can dream...
---
Dio as a killer
---
Jonathan as a survivor
---
Gotta do evil incarnate and adept killers so im sure im in for plenty of misery anyway lol
---
I would honestly pay for Larry to be in the game
---
Strong meme, mate. Carry on the legacy
---
So you want the ice climbers as a survivor?
---
Imagine if it's inside your terror radius, how nutty it'd be on a impossible skillcheck Dr. Worldwide.
---
How would you hit your DS if you are using laurie wtf?
---
Reminder that, yeah, that's part of that perk's function.
---
Keep playing matches, you get a little xp bonus for each side once a day
---
Yall know its not an actual demogorgon. Just check the DnD description of Demogorgon. The kids just call it that cus that was the monster they were fighting when shit hit the fan.
---
never watched Stranger Things go be honest.
---
Not gonna stop me from thinking it's cool as hell
---
EXACTLY
---
I keep saying that they need to allow the killer to pick which hex they want. Once the killer selects their totem then Ruin should start proc'g. 
---
Devs, get it done.
---
And people say that DbD isn't a horror game.
---
you got downvoted because it was a joke, no one wanted a real answer. were looking to mess around.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Oh ok. So he isnt better, other top killers are just worse lol gotcha
---
Dings Dong with malicious intent.
---
Not arguing it counters ghostface. But you make it sound like the surv is constantly following you just staring at you and if that's the case HIT THEM. It's not that hard. If you get knocked out of shroud, happens all the time, it's not like it's gone for 2 gens...here's some advice I get from killers on here: adapt. But seriously, just fucking hit them. You don't have to tunnel them or play around them. Just hit the tucker. They'll leave you alone. If it's a swf, good luck. That's bs and they all know it.
---
Should also point out that "general" patches are same day as well, not just DLC.
---
What they mean is:
---
In this example he instaheals just before adrenaline hits, result: healed fully.
---
But you could also hit adrenaline and then instaheal with the same result, eventough it obviously takes longer and this is still a problem
---
Thanks?
---
Flair checks out
---
theres a german news article, was posted earlier today
---
I think it's because people feel more comfortable being ass wipes when they're part of a team and not solo like the Killer always is. Toxicity seems most common in experienced groups playing together. They pick on the Killer because there's power in numbers. It's one of the behaviours that breaks the spirit of the game. When I'm the Survivor I don't have time to pissing around with the Killer, not that I'd ever want to, because Survivors are supposed to break chases and hide, get their stealth on, whatever. I know it's a game but when people behave that way it breaks the immersion. Would we teabag serial killers in real life if we managed to drop a bookcase on them during a chase? No, we'd take the opportunity to run as far as we could and hide. I like to fear the Killers in a serious match (meaning a non-farming match), not give them them a reason to tunnel or camp me. Survivors who bully Killers weaker than them just make themselves look stupid. It's not something to get high off of if they had an easy time. Managing to hold up against a very difficult Killer is something to be proud of, or managing to overcome a tunnelling camper.
---
I'm still happy for them, though.
---
Lee or grown up clem
---
hahaha
---
It's not dumb to point out the devs breaking their own rules wtf xD
---
Lol I feel your pain man.  I deranked once for the same reason to get that achievement primarily.  I definitely felt horrible doing it but at the same time Evil Incarnate is nearly impossible to do at red ranks and I tried to make up for it by playing Streamers for them every game until I got back up.   First you have to manage to even get to T3 which is difficult against strong red rank survivors in and of itself with how unbelievably long it takes but that isn't the reason the achievement is impossible up there.  Two words which I'm sure you're already well familiar with DC's and Lockers.  The amount of times you will have a red rank survivor DC during this attempt is absurd.  Only takes one to ruin it.  And then you have the assholes who read the killer has tombstone and counter it with the forced locker jump plays lol (not judging by the way I'm totally one of those assholes that jumps into the locker to force hooks in my survivor games when I know that's what they're running).  So short answer yes it is still wrong to derank but if you want that achievement you pretty much have to.  Just try to be wholesome and maybe spread some BP offering love out while you're up there.
---
lmao get bodied
---
Outstanding.
---
Guys we're not having a clown killer btw!!!!!!!!! - BHVR like a year and a half ago btw
---
Signed.
---
Fair enough, its also why I personally don't count licensed characters as being canon since they don't have a real reason as to why the entity took them such as the Myers example you pointed out.
---
I haven't seen the movies, but from what I read Michael still seems to be fueled by anger.
---
It always makes me laugh when a killer catches me doing some weird shit like that, and then participates lol
---
What happened to me :‚Äô(
---
Ahahaha, what? Those perks are garbage! Super situational and when their situation happens they don't actually do enough to justify putting them on. Just run Rancor/Bamboozle and Pop Goes The Weasel instead.
---
Is it unsportsmenslike? Yes.
---
Is it unsportsmenslike in a bannable sense? No.
---
Also play Streamers for sure during your attempts.  It will encourage them not to DC at least.
---
Wrong the source is from a reddit post from earlier today stop believing the leaks by daylight accounts they don't find any of that info
---
ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER RAGE ABOUT THE SHIT ASS MATCHMAKING ABUSE ALLOWED BY THIS GAME.   I TRACKED SHIT THIS TIME.   FROM RANK 14 TO 12, I HAD 43 GAMES THIS WEEK.   ONLY 4 GAMES DID NOT HAVE AT LEAST ONE RED RANK.   21 GAMES HAD 2 RED RANK CUNTS BEING CUNTS.
---
In terms of survivors, because they're essentially skins, based off of their perks alone it's hard to say. Multiple survivors have nigh-useless perks but have one redeeming perk that might make them worth the DLC. Jane, for instance, has Head-On. Others might argue Poised is worth it, as well, but to each their own. Kate Denson has pretty good perks, imo. She's one of the few survivors whose perks I like completely, not just one or two. The DLC's killer, the Clown, has two good perks, as well: Pop Goes the Weasel and Bamboozle.
---
I also kind of like all three of the Plague's perks, but that's just a personal preference.
---
If I'm being honest, I'm not too in-touch with the current meta. I run who I want to with the perks, tools, and add-ons I want without much of a care. I'd love it if someone familiar with the meta atm could answer, though, because as someone going to be looking at DLC's soon, as well, it'd be very helpful.
---
YOU KNOW WHAT I FUCKING HATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
THE FACT THAT I BOUGHT BUBBA 4 DAYS BEFORE THEY PUT IT IN THE MOTHER FUCKING SHRINE!!!!! LIKE I MUST BE ABSOLUTEYFUCKING CURSED absolutely
---
IT REALLY PISSES ME OFF THAT THEY BULLIED YOU AND POTENTIALLY DISCOURAGED YOU FROM PLAYING THE KILLER YOU WANT TO PLAY.
---
NOW YOU HAVE TO GET GUD WITH FREDDY AND BULLY THEM BACK OTHERWISE I'M GOING TO BE EVEN MORE [PISSED](/intensifies)
---
Bold of you to assume PS4 players don't exist.
---
I like the idea of burning streamers while going for it. That will make me feel a ton better lol. Yea the dc's are one of my biggest concerns. I mean I see people quit cus they step in a trap I can only imagine how fast they dip when people just die.
---
IRIDESCENT HATCHETS ARE EXTREMELY UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST WITH INFANTRY BELT ON. THEY MAY NOT BE OP BUT I CANT STAND BEING ONE SHOT AT RANGE FOR ONE SLIGHT MISTAKE.
---
Me cus I bought it the first time it was on the shrine
---
FUCKING NOSHOES
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that just be one of the people working for the Macmillan family?
---
Playing into the slug, so they can get up a bunch of time, makes for a really fun game.
---
I have played against it, and I always have fun.
---
Source?
---
Lolz :)
---
Reminds me of all those assholes that steal items when the killer has Franklin's. Like how rude are you?
---
This fantastic advice and I know of some purple ranks that could afford to read this as well
---
Friday 13 already doing that
---
yea prolly gonna do that for sure.
---
But maybe it's because the demigorgan choose to come to the human earth realm where the entity has the power to capture 'humans'. The entity is just stronger than the demigorgan
---
Mori?
---
I hope we get a Werewolf next XD  lol
---
Dub is poo poo.
---
I just don't see how it would be possible without dropping ranks.
---
The king of hearts would enjoy some bbq.
---
The only time Michael Myers has ever showed any emotion is Halloween 5, which is appropriately titled the Revenge of Michael Myers. Jason Voorhees is more of an angry killer. Even in the kills the two respective killers commit, you can see, Jason is a lot more physical whereas Michael (while some of them may be brutal) are usually pretty quick. 
---
In the first Myers film, which the DBD is incarnation is based off of (the first film and nothing else), Loomis goes on a rant about how Michael has ‚Äúthe blackest eyes, the devils eyes‚Äù because there‚Äôs nothing there. Just a blank emotionless stare. Hence his mask being emotionless as well.
---
Its only evil if survivors derank. 
---
/s
---
RNG IS A CRUEL MISTRESS
---
Survivors are essentially reskins, so that question doesn't apply to them. 
---
As for killers, all killers are viable - but some are more viable than others. Bear in mind that the official stats released by the devs place the lowest kill rate on PC at 50%, and the highest at 66%. Not too many people are going to get worked up by that disparity, especially since 2:2 is the intended balance ratio.
---
My head canon with characters who were taken to the entities realm but still exist in their respective worlds is that they're copies or clones so to speak.
---
Like they were too important in the grand scheme of things to take entirely, so the entity took a copy and recreated them in its realm.
---
Can't stop watching this.
---
The key to your release is across this carpet strewn with tiny plastic blocks. Live or die, make your choice.
---
It should be the shoulder buttons on a pad. Wiggling a stick is unreliable.
---
Wraith: Was so mad he got tricked into killing people he became magic and killed way more people.
---
Huntress: Can't identify her own species despite being old enough to survive in the wilderness at the time of her mother's death.
---
Spirit: Hates her dad. Isn't killing her dad.
---
Legion: Susie's one of them for reasons.
---
It's rare for killers to do, but yes, killers can either close the hatch or open the exit gates. 
---
If I'm farming or haven't played well as killer, I'll open the gates for the survivors and then try to find the hatch so one of them can get out that way. If y'all encounter someone named Baby Spirit - Sorry, that's me!
---
Kenny is an asshole and such an overrated character, i shot his ass as soon as i got the chance, will gladly facecamp him in DBD.
---
If you've played more than 2 hours of DBD since buying it, they won't refund it
---
Barb isn't much of a survivor though is she?
---
Syringe insta heals get rid of exposed status effect?
---
man please don't do that here lol. I don't want to see that war unfold....again. I know you put /s but i also know this sub haha
---
First off, no need to be a dick about it.
---
Second, not everyone wants to run the same perks every game. Yes, that combination is more effective, but I don't care. I want to have fun, and fun doesn't mean winning all the time.
---
Everyone who is in dbd has died so...
---
It really isn't, so if achievements are important to you just do it. I mean (ideally) it's just one game, they can deal with it. 
---
Id say if youre going to do it, do it before the stranger things DLC drops as we don't want to scare off new players, and try not to BM when you rank your way back up afterwards
---
Don't forget the demogorgon can teleport. When the killer teleports to you directly after you completed the gen those 30 secs could be difficult
---
Why can't we just be happy that they are adding content on a regular basis that people are excited about? DBD has lore but it this isn't a game that relies on its storyline to truly enjoy.
---
Well Netflix waltzed in and bribed the entity. Nea has to get some new clothing from somewhere!
---
Never said he is, I love his Outlast series
---
Was the Wraith standing there? Lmao
---
I EXPERIENCED 10 MATCHES YESTERDAY RIDDLED WITH DCs. FOUR OF THOSE FUCKING MATCHES THE KILLER DC-ED EITHER ONCE WE OPENED THE GATES OR MID-MATCH CAUSE SOMEONE WIGGLED FREE. AND THE REST WERE SURVIVORS DC-ING, BUT IT WAS ALL 3 OF THE SURVIVORS ON EACH  TEAM, USUALLY AFTER THEY GOT HOOKED OR CAUGHT ONCE. THE ICING ON THE CAKE? I WAS RIGHT THERE GETTING READY TO GRAB THEM WITH BORROWED TIME AND HEAL. THE KILLER WASN‚ÄôT EVEN THERE.
---
Everyone also just forgets Kate is also still alive and she's not even a crossover character.
---
Yea hes pretty cool. Probably my fave rn
---
Only one that came close to legit dying is the spirit, Tapp and Pig were bleeding out.
---
Hiding behind gens doesn't work. You can see survivors through the gens if you are an experienced killer. I do it all the time as freddy and then instantly teleport to the gen. Or fake it depending in circumstances
---
Good call. And nah no BM. I'll prolly just work on adept killers on the way back up.
---
You weren't invited
---
Wasn't the reason for his first murder jealousy?
---
Steve's perk looks like a great perk for sandbagging
---
That's for the Frank survivor version because we can't have too many Franks. He can offer other survivors an egg in this trying time.
---
We don't know yet but considering they atleast have Steves look down on point kinda like Ash's it's most likely he will but personally I wouldn't want that considering how annoying it is to hear " LOOK WHO'S SHITTIN IN THE TALL GRASS"
---
At first I thought you instahealed and then used adrenaline, but upon closer inspection, I was wrong.
---
The best is when they accuse you of cheating when they just can‚Äôt comprehend that they played poorly.
---
I will preface this by saying that while I asymmetrically play killer and survivor (\~30% killer, 70% survivor) I have plenty of experience with post-game chat.
---
I don't necessarily get 'angry messages', but I've gotten a few 'gg ez's after a game. I'm ngl, as a baby killer it was a bit disheartening as I was trying to learn lunge distance, how to keep track of survivors in a chase, mind games, etc.  - my goal wasn't necessarily a 4K. However, whenever I switch to killer, I usually change my name to Baby ---, Sorry. As Spirit, it's "Baby Spirit, Sorry" and any other killer is just "Baby Killer, Sorry" because I know some people get frustrated when they load into a game and it's too easy. That tends to ward off a lot of nasty messages. I've actually had a game where all four survivors were set to get out and they waited until the EGC timer ran down to die and then said 'we love you &lt;3' in end-game chat, primarily due to my name I'd imagine.
---
That's not how it works. Read Kate's backstory.
---
Any incentive sufficient to make solo players happy with the worst possible "teamplay" (bearing in mind that right now there's no official communication between survivors) is going to be overwhelmingly broken when applied to people who actually *can* play together. 
---
Short games are not the intended standard, especially short games with a 4k - please consult the list of scoring events in order to see why killer will walk away with a far higher score in such a scenario.
---
I WANT THE HAT GOT DAMMIT 
---
I NEED CUTE SAILOR STEVE
---
Yea but it was worth it. I went from about 5 teachables to 15, all while being able to P3 level 50 my main at the time, and being able to get huntress to roughly P2.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of different theories based around it, and the novelization offers one as well, but the way the film presents it, no it‚Äôs not jealousy. He just snaps and kills his sister one night. Like all his emotions just turned off that night and never turned back on. 
---
It‚Äôs the Rob Zombie remake Myers that explicitly shows emotions.
---
Even if that is the name they gave it, the point is that "the creature" from stranger things never was or has been human, which is something that was stablished in the lore as some sort of "rule".
---
You can see the problem right? Some people are apparently invested in the "lore" of an online game with a backstory that is pretty much just made as an excuse to have different horror icons in it. 
---
I don't know why people care a bout the lore anyway, is not even the strong point of the game, is pretty much background noise you need not pay attention to.
---
No, but syringe heals 2 full states. So if you have a infinite t3 meyers who is slugging you can get someone up with it, fully healed.
---
Jokes are supposed to be funny and make you laugh...this isn't one of those "jokes". And these jokes are what got us Stranger Things üòí And you really just made a petition to put this in the game as a "joke"?!
---
Ikr. He is more salty than survivor
---
Mfw holding m1 is doing your job well
---
Also some further advice on how to derank "the right way".  Again not condoning the practice it's usually done maliciously to bully baby players but for this achievement I get it.  You likely won't ever get it at rank 1 between lockers and DC's.  
---
Whatever you do don't just join games and quit immediately.  Complete lack of respect for the survivors who will lose all their offerings played.  What I did was simply mess around with stupid meme games where the survivors can all escape and get their points, not depip etc...No Blink Nurse, No Uncloak Wraith (see how many pallets I could force down before they realized I wasn't uncloaking), Chest Protector Bubba but I'd only kill the person who actually touched my chest (Insidious downs from unhook attempts were left to crawl back upstairs to get picked back up) or if you don't feel like meme ing just go afk somewhere let them play and leave.  They will all safety or pip and get free range to keep whatever items they searched etc...Do what works for you but definitely don't just immediately quit.  It's a dick move
---
Nope I did nothing but sit in the basement and throw hatchets for like 12 games straight to get the huntress achievement 
---
Do whatever you need
---
I went and bought it on the shrine for pc cause I was not in the mood to level LeatherFace up again for a second time. I fucked up and leveled him up first on PS4. That was probably the least fun experience I had on killer.
---
yo imagine if Demogorgon could teabag like Ghostface
---
So just stand there and shake your tatas while someone loops for an eternity?
---
Hooked me upstairs and a guy saved me and he just blocked the stairs.
---
Adrenaline doesn't pop in the video. It's the Ultra Rare Syringe add-on. She max heals before the last gen is even done.
---
New Killer: The Cat
---
nah
---
I wouldn't say so. That achievement is a bitch and anything to lessen the burden is fine imo
---
Basically haha
---
This clearly isn't intended, otherwise you would be able to use the syringe while you have already been downed.
---
welp think i just figured out what im gonna do to de-rank. 2 birds one stone.
---
You cannot have fun in this game while running perks that dont do anything, have you not noticed that yet? The survivors will run you around for ages and let me tell you, that is no fun at all.
---
Nowhere in the lore does it say that the entity takes only humans.
---
Whereas I don't think non human monster should have been apart, due to lore, i do understand that its been a few years and the game needs to keep evolving. The creative capabilities of new killers only gets held back by the no nonhumans rule. Im sad to see it broken, but relieved to see the game change with its audience and become a better game for it.
---
:/
---
starting to seem like the majority
---
Check gen count at end of video, adrenaline doesn't pop. That speed boost is from getting smacked, and that guys comment still doesn't make sense.
---
On that note though, imagine this happening as killer, who has to hit you 4 times in 1 Chase to down you to then get hit with adrenaline. As well. Big meme haha.
---
Which is why it is called that in the show.
---
That happened to be today. Luckily only a day's progress was gone, and I'd only done 2 rituals and leveled up some killers
---
The mere existence of a flashlight makes a killer play differently. Wait around and check for flashlighters for a sec before pickup. Or forcing them to look elsewhere so they can't be flashlighted. Thus, making them waste time or play a way you want. It isn't always about the blind.
---
Tbh, I wouldn't want to see The Spirit irl. Surprised no one tought about her yet.
---
Moreso it should count as a kill, she can be the anti-DC'er
---
I gotcha mate.
---
YES!!!
---
Pretty much yeah. You can heal as long as you're not broken. But once you are, it does nothing.
---
Alright, that makes sense, and like I said I don't really count the licensed ones as canon because there is no reason why the Entity took them aside from "oh hey there's a killer" even most of the older ones don't have a story as to why the entity took them.
---
I can see this happening almost every single game:
---
&gt;Survivor 1: in a chase, and about to vault a window
---
&gt;Survivor 2: finishes a gen
---
&gt;Survivor 1: Can't vault the window, gets hit/downed
---
&gt;Survivor 1: DCs because he feels he was wrongfully downed and that it was his teammate's fault, then spectates for the rest of the game just to yell at Survivor 1 int he post-game chat
---
Well them being fully healed wouldn‚Äôt even matter if it‚Äôs a t3 so any kind of insta heal would work.
---
Assume every offering is a mori
---
&gt;Huntress: Can't identify her own species despite being old enough to survive in the wilderness at the time of her mother's death.
---
Isn't it that she sees adults more of a threat and kills them? She "saves" children, so she must recognise other humans.
---
That's called determination.
---
Fuck me daddy
---
Ah well just gotta wait and see then =)
---
I didn't buy DLC's, but I bought a bunch of auric cells to get all the killers since I main killers, but survivor became a little more interesting so I bought the survivors with auric cells too. It supports them and I'd rather use my shards on appearances or the shrine to get the massive BP bonus for perks I have already.
---
I believe it would be 17 with the Demogorgon
---
Stop acting like you're better than people just because they picked a character you don't like. We get it, you died. Too bad. Get better and try again later.
---
well i guess she requires a little amount of brain cells
---
I don‚Äôt know man sounds like you need to be hit with the classic get good.
---
The snares are superior.
---
With snares, you deal with regular pallets a lot better, and window loops can be shut down faster than normal. You can set the snares up in the survivors view, and still gain advantage. 
---
With dream pallets, you could get a hit through fake pallets, but you are weak to regular pallets and windows, and if you were going to get a hit through a fake pallet, you were going to get the hit a majority of the time anyways. You can't set up in view, because they will know. 
---
Conclusion : Snares are better, simply because dream pallets take away snares, which means you have no strength VS regular looping.
---
Time to stalk with malicious intent
---
Lord headass
---
What scoops ahoy outfit?
---
Yo but seriously where the dedicated servers tho
---
At my rank (10-15) Spirit's aren't a huge issue, but I'd like to see a change where you can tell if it's the Spirit or just the husk. Someone recommended flashlighting the Spirit which works, but I don't want to bring a flashlight every match just in case it's a Spirit (I don't normally bring items)
---
I KEEP NOT GETTING BARROWED TIME, BBQ AND LITHE BECAUSE RNG SAYS FUCK YOU TO ME
---
I've had bubba for ages and both BBQ and Franklin's were bought from the shrine. I hate the killer and now I never have a reason to play him. üòÅüòÅ
---
I swear
---
I love the republic
---
I think all the fussin and cussin can be explained away as ‚ÄúThe Entity is stronger than it was at the beginning.‚Äù
---
Yea im not a dick so its not gonna go that way. Meme builds sound like a fun way to go about it. Somebody else also mentioned they got the huntress achievement by just throwing hatchets in the basement so I'll prolly do that too on the way down.
---
Bro. I feel you on this so hard.
---
Honestly, considering how many new players this dlc will bring to the game, an easy way for them to understand how scratch marks works is a very good idea to me.
---
I guess it also depends who you're with, I've run into people who were self healing vs iridescent huntress after they got picked up and I just facepalmed. Such a waste of time
---
no windows or openings?
---
Only thing is devs are bad so we can‚Äôt have Scooby as a survivor. We can‚Äôt have Shaggy because even if he used 1% of his power he‚Äôd be too powerful and would escape every time. We couldn‚Äôt have our two favourites üò¢
---
Adrenaline surge looks like a very annoying and strong crutch perk
---
r/chargeyourphone
---
This about sums it up for me too lol
---
I hope they add another staircase/window in that house, it's annoying that killers can hold you hostage like that
---
Is this legit? Like is this a skin for it, or default?
---
You could put them as situational perks instead of hex perks
---
Stranger Things Demogorgon is like a harmless kitten compared to its DnD counterpart whose title is a f u c k i n g ,,Prince od Demons"
---
who was the wedding between
---
When I hit 16 it started. They were using hex's to slow down gens while camping too. What made it worse was it took almost 5 minutes to load into lobby. All that time wasted waiting for a shit match. Thankfully they were garbage at playing and I was able to loop them around the map. You definitely need perks that help with chases on PS4.
---
One could argue that what is supposedly Demogorgon‚Äôs power (tunnels) is just as similar to the Hag as my idea for Mr Vorhees. 
---
I‚Äôd go out on a limb and say if they had a way to get the rights, Jason would be getting in. Billy is basically Leatherface but looks who‚Äôs in
---
So I'm sorry for the clip being so long, but I'm trying to make a point.
---
This is a dick move. And I'm usually pretty chill with like, bodyblocking/tunneling/camping because whatever, but there was no reason for this? I came in with a toolbox and a Brand New Part (that I used on the very first generator). There's nothing that I could've done to this guy that would've justified this behavior. I'm more than a little mad about it.
---
If you're new to DbD - don't do this.
---
As a ps4 player, it runs relatively well for me, any glitches that happens isn‚Äôt ps4 exclusive and i‚Äôve only had a handful of bad connection games due to killer‚Äôs ping.
---
I'm sure a similar thing was said with busted legion pre-nerf, people hate to admit a killer is OP because they want to think they're skilled. Literally every thread of "who should I unlock next" is
---
* spirit
---
In a few months when she is inevitably nerfed then all the killer mains will be like "oh yeah she was OP"
---
Yeah. I still need to get ruin from hag anyway. She‚Äôs actually the killer I play the least yet still enjoy. I think having a good first round does that. It‚Äôs why I dislike Doctor and Clown yet love Myers and Wraith
---
Yeah, they have completely different purposes.
---
Yeah exactly that's the point lmao. Just another instance if BHVR going back on their word.
---
If any of the scooby doo gang sprint, their legs need to do that wind up first
---
i am not
---
It can work, but I often bait survivors into trying to blind me. I can time it to where I phase just before I get blinded and then I follow beam of the light. It's risky to try and blind a good Spirit.
---
I don't know if there is a way to stop this.
---
Unbreakable
---
I always denied that they'd ever add him because of that rule, however I was never against the idea. I'm actually really happy that they did and I hope to see more monster killers like him in the future. ^^^^^alien_and_ripley_next_plz
---
I want one of the Perks to be with Steve Hair, actually Steve's hair should be a survivor by itself.
---
It would have to affect the survivor who completed the gen only or it would be crazily broken. Imagine it on Lerrys.
---
Actually yeah, it's perfect for SB.
---
Well, I've got the tutorials done. Still not letting me play.
---
I Liked the wooosh subreddit but a lot of people (like you specifically) ruined it. oh and those annoying ass people on youtube that reply with fucking 40 wooshes
---
FUCK HER, IVE HAD A SLEW OF ASSHOLES FOR THE PAST WEEK DOING THIS AND WITH SLOPPY BUTCHER TRYING TO SELF HEAL WITH NO MED KIT WHEN IM RUNNING BOTANY &amp; WERE GONNA MAKE IT SO I CAN PULL OFF SOME QUICK HEALS AND GO BANG OUT SOME MORE GENS FOR THEM TO RUN OFF FOR THE NEXT MINUTE AND THEN SELF HEAL FOR THE NEXT 25 SECONDS!
---
Disgusting Julie player
---
Oh dang that's nice but big ooF for the blood web time though. I get so bored when I save up 1 mil for a new character.
---
Yeah, you have to finish the download. It usually downloads in two portions, you‚Äôve only completed the first portion
---
I completely feel you with that, I wasn‚Äôt that great of a killer when i first started (naturally), so I ended up becoming a survivor main, prestiged nea twice and jake once
---
Now I somewhat regret it because now that I play killer more often, I don‚Äôt have the teachables I want or need
---
It‚Äôs literally a cancer that ruins any meme with it.
---
&gt;The article mentions that you run faster in german
---
I guess I'll have to learn a new language for the in-game advantage.
---
Devs said there won't be any monsters in DbD. Only humans. So you're not dumb if you're saying it, you're just repeating what devs said.
---
That is bannable as well, he‚Äôs taking the game hostage
---
Made perfect by that scream with the trap

You can report him for that atleast xD
---
Select Wraith. Get in a game. Sit in a corner and wait for the match to be over. I heard that's the easiest way to get xp. And the match should take less than 10 minutes.
---
I just wanna say that I bought licenced DLCs for money, those that are affordable with shards, I buy them with shards. I've been playing for about 10 months now and I need to buy only 2 survivors (Kate and Ace), I have everything else.
---
So IMO if it doesn't take too long to grind those shards then I think it's worth it since you won't waste money on basically free content
---
Except she's not OP. Good red rank survivors run me around. A lot of people stay super predictable, sprint through grass, hold W, them claim she's OP.
---
I hope so, it'd be weird to hear them not sound like themselves
---
DnD is a tabletop game not a videogame, you can imagine it however you want, but this is it as portrayed in the 5e books
---
The chase is the fun part about this game. It fun to not know if you're going to catch the survivors, making it thrilling when you do. Yeah, good survivors can escape you with ease sometimes, but there's nothing wrong with that. Take it as a learning experience, give um a gg, and get onto the next match. 
---
These perks are fun because of the variety(wither big, or little) it offers to gameplay. I don't want to play the same killer every match, which is why I personally switch almost every game. Like I said, this game is supposed to fun, and winning doesn't constitute fun.
---
people that don‚Äôt like Stranger Things:
---
[loads mori with malicious intent]
---
I just go away from the exit gate now and try to do stuff that gives me a few extra points like break pallets or whatever so they leave and don‚Äôt get the satisfaction of their bullshit teabaggin. :/
---
That‚Äôs the plan. Thanks for saying that, it makes me feel better about doing it and that I‚Äôm not just blowing it out of proportion!
---
Honestly, for your best chance, wait until the new map is released and do your best to get the offering for it on Myers. 
---
Then go for the achievement. Ruin will last longer that normal since no one will know where totems spawn. That's how I got it, a two days after we got "The Game" and cleansing totems was pretty non-existent. 
---
It will still be a challenge but you'll at least have a better chance at it.
---
Report him, get him banned.
---
That was my thinking with putting it on this graphic. Everyone keeps on saying I should have added the star court dress and purple dress which would be cool skins but i feel it would just be redundant to put several dresses.
---
Spirir is definitely not OP.
---
FRANKLINS IS STILL A GOOD PERK FOR CAUSING CHAOS
---
Amazing shrine for killers, not so good for Survivors
---
I hardly play survivor since I just prefer the killer experience, even if that‚Äôs sometimes me getting pallet stunned every single loop and not getting a single kill
---
Honesty lol
---
Thats because people ask should I buy Spirit or x (Plague, Bubba, etc;) I honestly dont even see a lot of Spirits when I play survivor, its not that serious
---
That would be really cool
---
Not explicitly stated but a monster without a proper sentience doesn't fit in.
---
Its a Dead hard that activates after 3 gens, what the fuck
---
i was looking memes in reddit while i was waiting
---
Are you playing on console? If you are on console, are you game sharing with someone? It could be a game share issue.
---
Oh boy I can't wait to use Mettle of Man with Adrenaline Surge with Adrenaline and get that sweet 54% action speed bonus and 2 free hits, a speed boost with insta heal at the end and that's without any items or add-ons.
---
Also Mods gay including AutoMod....got removed first time just beacuse i said exit gate bug.
---
Apologies in advanced if ends up being me stunning you every look and blinding
---
I am a bloody nea after all
---
Oh, definitely going to do a report!!!
---
Anyone else feel kinda weird about the ST porn already there? I mean those are like... Real people being drawn.
---
I have bubba and enough bloodpoint to lvl up to unlock BBQ, should I buy the BBQ shrine for extra Bloodpoint ?
---
I'm on pc and I play Hillbilly, the nurse and huntress that I will lvl when I'll have BBQ.
---
But it says its updated to the latest version. And I don't know where to find the second portion.
---
If the one Nancy has, seeing her own scratch marks, is legit, will she be able to expose if the killer has Predator?
---
Yeah that sucks, but it‚Äôs still a lot better than before at least. I‚Äôd rather be trapped for 2 minutes than be trapped for 40 minutes.
---
And apologise in advance from me if I end up accidentally tunnelling you since the person who saved you is a Claudette that‚Äôs gone literally invisible
---
Yes, it does. Since this is a competitive game, like it or not. And variety doesn't automatically mean fun. Pre-nerf legion sure was variety. These perks are non-interactive and (1) do something you yourself can do, aka kicking gens, only this perk does it sometimes maybe if you're lucky enough to down a survivor near a gen thats been worked on. And at that point you can just go kick it yourself. And (2) are completely random and will most likely activate at times you'll never be able to make use of its effect. Yes, so much fun.
---
Isn‚Äôt this bannable? If he was just blocking the staircase until you guys died? Idk maybe I‚Äôm wrong
---
You have to completely download the game in its entirety, opening the game when it says ready to start just lets you play the tutorials nothing else.
---
Trust me, I‚Äôm gonna try.
---
Can you really blame them though?
---
Perhaps not OP, but definitely way too strong for how easy she is. If be fine keeping her at her strength if it took more skill
---
To be fair, everyone is invisible compared to my neon pink hair
---
Ok boomer
---
There is no "save" scoring event. There is a hook save and safe hook rescue. Therefore you can't classify it as a "save" unless they add a completely new scoring event.

Hillbilly: [whispers] "this is the part where you uninstall"
---
I don't get it
---
That‚Äôs very true. Doesn‚Äôt stop me feeling bad when I go back to a book that‚Äôs just had someone saved off it and the only one around is the injured survivor that got taken off it
---
That's... what I was suggesting.
---
No, it‚Äôs not holding the game hostage, the game will end.
---
To be fair that did guarantee two kills for them. There should be an open railing there so you can‚Äôt get trapped though
---
Integrated team chat or riot. Otherwise, gg solo queues.
---
I just see a smart players using the map to his advantage lol
---
I HAVENT PLAYED IN A FEW MONTHS, IS THERE DEDICATED SERVERS YET? TRYING TO PLAY WITH MY FRIENDS ON PS4 WAS A GOD DAMN NIGHTMARE
---
Nurse the best killer, huntress and Billy two top tier killers: all totally free and base. 
---
Spirit, second best killer: purchasable through free in game currency.
---
Pay to win???
---
The frame rate on certain maps was killer to me. Sometimes I would be chasing someone into hay or straw and the frame rate would drop drastically
---
DREAM PALLETS EVERYWHERE MY DUDE FUCK THOSE ASSHOLES. GET YOUR BAMBOOZLE ON.
---
What the hell is helicopter parenting?
---
This is a good idea and I appreciate the advice but I'm a huge Stranger Things fan so when that DLC drops I'm prolly only playing as the Demogorgon or Steve for a loooong time lol.
---
Denomnomegorgon?
---
Spot on. The only killers I've bought has been bubba, Micheal, and ghost face. Bubba for the BBQ, and the other two because I love sneaky bois
---
Healing someone out of the dying state is currently not considered as a save, therefore its why its not rewarding.
---
Steve Harringon has a sailor Outfit from his Scoops Ahoy   Ice Cream job
---
We have to agree, to disagree then. I know I'm in the minority with saying I enjoyed pre-buff Legion, but I did. Did I win a lot of games? Oh fuck no. I enjoyed the character though, and that's what matters to me.
---
Yeah, they probably will, as they have their faces, and you cannot prove their facial likeness without the Actor¬¥s knowledge
---
That's what I was thinking lol
---
I know, that's why I want it to he considered a save because it should be more rewarding! Imo of course.
---
You forgot the "No skin off my ass" perk.
---
helicopter parent is a parent who pays extremely close attention to a child's or children's experiences and problems, particularly at educational institutions. Helicopter parents are so named because, like helicopters, they "hover overhead", overseeing every aspect of their child's life constantly.
---
Clearly you are not a good red rank surv, those guys really know how to fight back against an Spirit. You should learn about them instead of complaining and maybe you will git gud.
---
I mean, he isnt really a DBD killer,yknow.
---
Lol? Do you know how slow you move with a flash light out? This wouldn't be op itd be suicide unless you're on a hill or something.
---
&gt;and takes the ability to play the game right out of the killers hands.
---
You can say the same for getting picked up and put on a hook? Its not that great of an idea but surely this isn't the problem.
---
I‚Äôve not had that issue, the only issue involving hay/straw/corn is just
---

---
You can't classify it as a "save" unless they add a completely new scoring event.
---
I AM A KILLER MAIN NOW IN GREEN RANKS BUT I LIKE TO PLAY SURVIVOR TOO. THE NOOB RANKS ARE SO FULL OF POTATO I CANNOT ESCAPE. I JUST WANT TO PLAY WITH SOME HALF DECENT PEOPLE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
---
Pre-nerf Legion. And nice seeing you enjoyed a character that was pure poison for the game.
---
Lol that's almost as good as the salt messages anyways.  Killer proceeds to facecamp every survivor with gens up.  "GG man, you did great".  I might have to try that one I almost feel like that would piss them off more than some of the stuff the messages they actually get.
---
Yeah that's what I want to know
---
No,
---
I don‚Äôt know, maybe they were salty that I wasn‚Äôt playing Nea too- there were three other Nea‚Äôs.
---
Ew Bubba. Good meme tho
---
The trailer is what got me to finally watch it. I'm at episode 5 now and yes, I like the hell out of this. The chief sheriff is fucking badass, too bad they didn't make a third survivor for him.
---
I agree it should
---
I love Democracy
---
I mean, would that be too complicated? I'm positive BHVR has the capabilities to do that.
---
You keep this shit up and I'll bring out nurse on the PTB
---
You're wrong.
---
Kinda sounds like the person playing, not the killer
---
I‚Äôm sure two survivors was a lot of work already for them, to be fair
---
Yes but there might be like 10 available holes so its different.
---
This guy thinks the world is ending because kids like cellphones. Just another stereotypical nihilist.
---
[visible confusion mixed with dread]
---
Where did she get it? I want it
---
I HEAR YOU MY DUDE ALL DAY YESTERDAY I WAS JUST TRYING TO GET MY KILLER ON AND HAVE SOME FUN AND KEPT GETTING SHUTOUT BY SWF TEAMS. THEY CANT EVEN GIVE ME A LITTLE DIGNITY IN THEIR VICTORY THEY ALL T BAGGED AND FLASHLIGHT CLICKED ME TIL ONE GAME I TUNNELED AND CAMPED SOMEONE SO I COULD AT LEAST GET ONE KILL. FEELSBADMAN
---
I don't even bother getting in lockers unless they've got pop and my green can be finished as long as they don't run to it. I want them to see me on BBQ. BBQ is the best perk survivors can wish for too avoid having the hook heavily camped.
---
Laughs in distortion
---
There currently is a hook save and safe hook rescue. There is no "rescue" from the dying state. They would need to add that.
---
Its a good idea thought i upvoted you.
---
It really isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre very unlikely to be able to find survivors for that 30 seconds and when you do it‚Äôs a free hit or free pallet. Seems like it‚Äôll be pretty bullshit for survivor
---
I'll head on your pumpkin head while I teabag you as nancy. Try me &gt;: ^ (
---
It's a killer in Dead by Daylight....Yes it is?
---
Funny enough I think Devil Face is harder to detect than OG while he‚Äôs leaning. It‚Äôs a lot darker than it looks in the shop.
---
Oh duh. I didn‚Äôt read it as D‚Äùn‚ÄùD sorry. This creature is pretty awesome looking.
---
again? seriously?
---
If anything perks need to be removed entirely
---
I actually play both roles like you. When i play survivor i usually play with random discord people. And then its funny because they often complain about the killer and i'm like "well he did fine!". For example, a slugging killer, they all insult him and i say "gg wp" and they get mad haha
---
True. I think that big warning with her dash is probably her weakest point besides the rbt escape.
---
"my ruin NEVER lasts more than 30 seconds but I'm going to continue using it"
---
That‚Äôs actually kinda cool and makes sense.
---
Oh man I hate micro transactions and rarely buy unless I really want something but goddamnit SCOOPS AHOY AHOY
---
devs said that the demogorgons power would be nothing like freddy, so lets see if they were correct i guess
---
ohh haha
---
don't blame the killer blame your team for opening the door in this scenario as well.
---
Lol everyone's mad if they add BBQ and mad if they don't. Leatherface is a ton of fun to play and I bought the DLC and have no complaints. Thanks for the good shrine, finally.
---
That would be cool but I‚Äôd rather see Rick as a survivor and maybe Beta or Alpha as a killer
---
Ohhhh, wow, a free pallet, yes definitely worth using one of my four perk slots.
---
If it's not explicitly stated then you're just wrong.
---
It is bannable and it is still holding the game hostage.
---
I love it
---
Not the same thing...wish killer mains would stop with the false equivalency
---
The vicious cycle. Sigh.
---
If you are literally receiving a message of salt after EVERY game I have to assume there is an aspect of your playstyle that is encouraging the salt.  My guess would be either camping with gens up or proxycamping and playing to hard tunnel the unhooked player immediately back down for rehooking.  Do either of these seem like something you do regularly?  I play a lot of killer and rarely get messaged post game.  The times I do it's a 50/50 on whether it's a gg/compliment or salt from a dead survivor.  Where there's smoke there's fire and in my experience killers that constantly receive salt are playing in a way that triggers people to message you in the first place.  Entitled salt definitely exists and is silly but if it's happening as frequently as you say there has to be something happening in your games.
---
**Tier 4 DS**	
---
Using whatever is at hand, you stab at your aggressor in an ultimate attempt to escape.
---
After getting downed by the killer, Decisive Strike will become active and usable for 600 seconds.
---
While Decisive Strike is active, when grabbed by the Killer, succeed a good Skill Check to automatically escape the Killer's grasp and stun the Killer for 10 seconds.
---
Succeeding or failing the Skill Check will **not** disable Decisive Strike.
---
Successfully stunning the Killer will result in you becoming the Obsession.
---
Increases your chances of being the Obsession.
---
The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
---
yes, and i finally got it on the hag
---
My friend refuses to play killer so he doesn't have a very deep understanding of how they appear. I imagine lots of players are the same way, so this perk can help them learn without forcing them to play killer.
---
HOW DARE YOU
---
No I'm just kidding, I hope they do add a new scoring event for something like this. Anything that makes survivor bloodpoints easier, I'm all for.
---
I'd say free BP but they dropped it down to 150,000 when it use to be 250,000. Just cant have nice things I guess....
---
But we're not getting it in dbd.
---
That's not a solution, that's just saying hey wow it's great you're giving us more characters at once than ever, but could you just real quick pay for the likeness of two people, also pay them for voice overs and also some character models would be great. Fuck off
---
Report him

https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=191426
---
Why cut off the part where she hit you?
---
There is a decent amount of skill to her by knowing where to phase to, but it's about the same amount of skill required to know where to place your traps as Hag or Trapper. A lot of times it's a 50/50 shot when I phase walk that I'll find a survivor or be on the other side of the map from them all.
---
The killer never set a trap?
---
When you have DCs and salt you either played good or played legion
---
Cause he probably stopped moonwalking
---
I plan to switch to Billy once i get BBQ on him, so.
---
*raises hand*
---
#NO
---
I don't think it doesn't fit with the lore. The Demogorgon, while not human, is still from earth (just a different dimension of it). The Entity exists in a different Dimension (not unlike Pennywise's home), and I find it reasonable that  it would be able to access and even recruit from them as well. The Demo's worked for the Mindflayer on Earth why not work for the Entity in the Trial.
---
[AAAAAA](/intensifies)
---
There are plenty of characters who didn't die. Ghost Face, Laurie, Ash, Kate, Quentin. Maybe a couple more.
---
Being able to get a free pallet in the first 10 seconds of a chase and then chance targets is really fucking good. But then again you probably just tunnel one guy to the ground then complain about genrush so
---
I actually got a GG yesterday. I‚Äôm on Xbox and don‚Äôt get messages generally. It was a nice change of pace.
---
haha yeah...a lot of GG seem to drip with sarcasm.  "GG man, you did great" is probably the same.  But I would rather get that then messages like get cancer or KYS.
---
My two mains :) Lovin' it!
---
No, the girl is his Ex-girlfriend from season one. She‚Äôs one of the main kids (Mike/Finn Wolfhard) smolder sister
---
Why... Just why...
---
Moris would be broken without the heads up.  They completely change the way survivors have to play the game.  Moris are already easy mode for the killer playing them without a warning would just be busted.  There is a reason devs give the survivors a heads up.
---
Spiders aren‚Äôt humanoid
---
Already in the game
---
Almost all of the comment I've seen want the Xenomorph and Ripley now
---
I love this thank you
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from with your first point, but you really think people are tryhards for buying characters based on perks? Doesn‚Äôt make sense
---
Shitty ‚Äúgame‚Äù
---
Why not drag survivors? That would be awesome.
---
I better see the his name as Steve "The Hair" Harrington
---
It's not explicitly stated that BHVR don't know how to code but they sure as hell don't know how to code ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Love how some people ask why people don't just buy bubba when they are forgetting some of us don't have a job and DbD was a gift to us.
---
I don't mind salt typically but KYS has no place in any message ever.  Seriously the lowest forms of life wishing people death over a video game.  Some people take it too far.
---
Steve x Pig now a thing?
---
Tier 4 hex ruin. Survivors must cleanse all totems in the map to disable this perk. Good skill checks regress the generator by 50%. Great skill checks regress the generator by 10%. A failed skill check results in a 100% regression to the genrator.
---
Ooo those demogorgon perks looking spicy. Really liking the steve one.
---
Probably a hipster
---
If you're buying the character JUST for the perks, yes. Because the perk(s) will be in the shrine eventually. They want it right now and they're willing to pay real money for it. That strikes me as a bit tryhard, yes.
---
If you're buying characters just to play as new characters, that's different.
---
Fuck it I'll redownload and give it a try
---
lmao "the meaty backhand" i love that
---
Uhh...
---
Guess it‚Äôs harder to defect survivors by sound and moving grass then just go vroom vroom chainsaw
---
Can we have Clementine tho
---
They would just have to not give him the ability to use add ons or perks and he *maybe* has a chance of getting in
---
They had a store in the game called scoops ahoy is what I mean.
---
If you combined it with borrowed time, the survivor could get hit and use the speed boost to escape without leaving scratch marks
---
I GOT BUBBA TO FUCKING LEVEL 34 YESTERDAY AND BBQ IS IN THE SHRINE.........I WILL GET THAT FUCKING FRANKLIN'S THO
---
AND ALSO CRINGY SURVIVORS THAT THINK I SHOULD HIDE IN A CORNER AFTER I HOOK SOMEONE
---
Uhm, lmao what? You do realize that just because windows are blocked off doesn't mean the survivor has to throw down the first pallet they come across immediately right? They can still loop just fine. And what idiot "switches targets" when a pallet was thrown down. And what would I even switch to, the survivor that is conveniently standing next to the other one, just waiting for me to chase him? Are you stupid or something?
---
I would ban every single person who uses it.  Its absolute terrible and has no place anywhere
---
*heavy breathing*
---
I just smack em and leave. 2 people out of the game for a bit while I go focus on someone else.
---
The fact that this is true makes me question how much of my time I spend pointing at random stuff
---
Yeah if this was a thing it would either be survivor only, or it would be something like rick:survivor and negan:killer with lucille
---
Oh so it's just another instance of the devs going back on their word. I completely understand, it's not like they're ever true to it. No clown killer btw, Freddy rework before a year and a half btw, making legion actually fun to play as and against btw, I could go on but I'll stop here. :)
---
We don't know that yet lol
---
First 2 are crazy strong, the third only benefits the killer unless you're being 3 genned
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too. Look at Hillbilly, Hag, Nurse, Spirit and Freddy. They all have access to better map pressure and high mobility and little to no drawbacks when you‚Äôve got used to using them. They all have fairly easy to use tools to keep them on people throughout the match. Legion has to pray they have people close by and risk eating a stun and waiting for your power to recharge if you go to an empty area or lose a survivor who has sprint burst or lithe.
---
How dare you bully my boys the doctor and wraith
---
The killer ran a perk so they did something. I still think that perk will be  bad since it won't do anything at a normal loop.
---
NO SCREW COMPANY POLICY!
---
Survivor is Badger
---
If you kick non-regressing gens, it works. If you want to kick a nearby gen... luckily the Pop duration has been increased.
---
I think it would be cool for the Demogorgon to rip out the survivors throat and clawing them before dragging them screaming to the upside down, leaving a dead patch of grass and some black gunk so people know where the survivor died
---
See you get it!!!  
---
Also I'm not too happy with the Freddy Rework. I hate that he's visable all the time. Watching someone get Mori'd by an unseen force was awesome!
---
I should really know better than to argue with people on Reddit. Damned logical brain of mine.
---
DemonetizedGorgon
---
Mhmm ...
---
I don't know how good you are with Nurse but you can bait Dead Hard especially if you know they have it, 1st blink on top of em so they'll Dead Hard and 2nd blink to catch up :)
---
Imagine running a perk that gets blown up in less than two minutes leaving you with only 3 perks for the rest of the game. 
---
Run PGTW, Thrilling Tremors or even Corrupt Intervention cause at least CI is for sure going to last two minutes when Ruin will hardly last more than 36 seconds.
---
You can say that for all the original DBD characters. In none of their origin stories it says they die
---
Yeah, bloodwebs aren't as random as one would think. The layouts seem predetermined, while only the order in which each layout appears is randomised.
---
The spirit is not the only one who can mindgame. Also survivors can abuse pallet drop notifications to trick her. For example you can drop the pallet on her side while she's phasing and then vault it. To her perspective it would be a pallet drop on the opposite side of the pallet and then vault back. And if you also have a headphone you can hear the vacuum sound under the heartbeat when she's phasing. Iron will hard counters her and if there's no grass she only have crows and their physical body to hit them 100% sure. I'm not saying that she's totally counterable, it's kinda like the nurse, just use stealth as your primary way to counter her, not looping.
---
Did you buy the game on the account it is locked for?
---
He tried
---
Pffft 2.2k shards, real men have at least 50k
---
[Readies shock with malicious intents]
---
54% action speed
---
2000 Shards? Those are rookie numbers you gotta bump those all nighter numbers up man.
---
And Bill. He was pretty close to death as well.
---
If you have nothing else to use your shards on, it doesn't really cost you anything. I would advise saving some for future shrines though.
---
I‚Äôm more hyped for Nancy
---
A question, i see a lot of people saying that they will use scratch mirrors in the new map, Can you explain me what does it do?, i dont have Myers
---
Me with bbq and flip flop lol
---
It counts as healing someone (altruism).
---
Screaming: hit, and hook sounds
---
Grunting: jumping off of things
---
Moaning: injured
---
it does nothing
---
The stealth crouch thing is only mentioned in the end, when it talks about the Demogorgon walking on two legs normally, except when it goes into crouch mode. Sadly not much more was explained.
---
We have to get a Demo LEGO cosmetic in DbD now. When we pallet stun him he just kinda falls apart
---
What i meant, he isnt originally from DBD ,headass
---
Because Blood Warden also activates from hooking a survivor. If the survivor DC's the exit gates won't be blocked. This goes on for other perks like Pop Goes The Weasel, etc.
---
And I never fucking run NOED outside of on super weak killers (leatherface, wraith) or as part of an endgame centric build. I never slap NOED on my "typical" killers (Doctor, Plague, Freddy, Ghostface, Myers) as a band-aid or crutch because I'd rather not dedicate a perk slot for "Endgame" when I can use a different perk and maybe get a better advantage and not hit endgame in the first place.
---
Thanks to your mentality I might just throw NOED on all my killers out of spite though. You sound like someone who feels like you're entitled disconnecting if I'm running a mori or something.
---
Also the faster walk speed could help regain exhaustion while at a loop
---
That's what I was saying
---
WHY THE FUCK IS BBQ JUST NOW SHOWING IN THE SHRINE AFTER I SPENT HOURS AND HOURS GRINDING BUBBA TO MAX AND GETTING THE FUCKING THING ON ALL MY KILLERS?! RANDOM SHRINE MY ASS
---
Compensating for that DC :)
---
Nerf/Buff This Thing
---
Quentin was easier to get this was back when dbd wasn‚Äôt nearly as popular so the main focus was getting Freddy for name recognition
---
Doubt it with an attitude than that.
---
Unless you mean you have more hours but you're survivor main, then I can believe it.
---
OMG The Lore RHEEEEeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!
---
Gow aheat, misa joestur
---
People need to feel important in their mundane, boring ass lives.  Looking for things to complain about.  Also, they feel a sense of accomplishment when they "get the last word" so to speak...the old "I told him!"....It's sad and exhausting.
---
The other thing is I wouldn‚Äôt have to be a total asshole and run Sloppy + Thana because it‚Äôs literally the only build that can reliable give Legion enough time to chip away at survivors and get a 4K. But it‚Äôs cancerously unfun to play against and the perks themselves while good on him do not really provide a unique gaming experience. With my proposed change you could use Mobility to take advantage of Make Your Choice or Pop. Etc. Run more unique builds.
---
It's not necessary. If you're sprinting towards a window consider not vaulting it. Or fast vault it and slow vault back. Or slow vault it and fast vault back. You can't just run around like normal and expect to escape her. I'd be rich if I had a nickel for every Claudette that got salty when they crouch walked through grass and told me she was OP because I found them. I'd suggest playing as Spirit to really understand her.
---
Not very important, but didn't the first two Ghostfaces die in the first scream movie if I remember correctly?
---
Plot twist, she buys a copy of the game and DLC for herself and finds you in a random lobby, then proceeds to eat your face with the Demogorgon
---
This is actually really hilarious lmaoüòÇ
---
‚ÄúReady‚Äôs shock nodes with malicious intent‚Äù
---
yeah keep that in my for next time, thanks tho!
---
and that's a fact
---
 That's not tunneling or camping, they were just being toxic
---
Really wish people would stop perpetuating the "us vs them" rhetoric.
---
Yes.
---
Tier 4 pebble let's you store up to 5 pebbles at a time
---
Hmmmmmm well there‚Äôs 1 lie. Now idk if I can trust ur word.
---
Don‚Äôt you? It‚Äôs Hag‚Äôs favorite meal.
---
This does not qualify as holding the game hostage. The game is going to end as soon as the timer runs out, and he‚Äôll get two kills.
---
This isn‚Äôt bannable, just a really scum strategy
---
BBQ is good for the game though
---
&gt;Mods gay 
---
üôèüôèüôè
---
I didn't expect a *literal* Megamind meme.
---
I've played matches as survivor where my teammates ran the killer around the map and I did almost every gen and finished last because they were altruistic and I wasn't. It happens. I've also spent the entire match running the killer around and saving my teammates while they did gens and finished at the top even if I didn't escape. That also happens. 
---
Healing is altruism, it's just not as rewarding. You have to decide what' s more important, escaping or getting the most BP. Either way you can play to that each match. It's up to you.
---
I mean either of them would work similar to Bill seeing as they had similar approaches to the people close to them.
---
You broke Rule #8741, Page 753, Paragraph 4 of the Survivor Rulebook for Killers: Killers are forbidden to use their power to help them get kills.
---
ok
---
why
---
Download TapTap and get it through there, it's been working for at least a month and a half
---
I would walk his useless, crazy ass into the killer immediately every time.
---
Fuck Kenny. Fuck him in the god damn ear.
---
Im gonna learn how to nurse just so o can choke both of the new survivors
---
The definitive tier list.
---
I‚Äôd move doctor to ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù though.
---
Would put on a mori every time I see him
---
Which version of Alpha T.V or Comics?
---
You've read the comic, right? Bill got pretty darn messed up.
---
What about a "The Thing" chapter?
---
Doctor is my boy, for doctor you want to run perks that would make you have a larger terror radius, say distressing. His treatment mode has a shock field which is about half of his terror radius. Doctor is a low tier character but in the right hands can be really powerful. If a survivor tries looping you, shock them before they reach treatment mode which will trigger a animation where they won‚Äôt be able to throw down the pallet. In this situation they will have to risk going around again and maybe getting hit or waiting at the pallet for an assured hit
---
I'm assuming a Dr with a large terror radius to cover multiple gens. After the first few gens are done, if the remaining gens are close together the survivors can be in a tough spot where the killer can easily patrol to find them all and kill them one by one unless they hid. With Dr, finding people is a lot easier, especially with the right perks. Someone who knows more can add to this. I'm using Overcharge, Surveillance, Ruin and Distressing on my Dr along with Calm add on, not sure if this counts for that build but quite often, the game gets tied up on the last couple gens.
---
I love this format. Monto is our lord and saviour
---
I was just thinking of a perk like BBQ for the survivors, but I was thinking of reworking We're gonna live forever, by revealing the Killer to you for 4 seconds if you're outside of the terror radius, or just 40 meters like BBQ, whichever is more balanced.
---
But they seem to have made into a separate perk.
---
LAST I CHECKED SEPTEMBER WAS FALL, NOT MID SUMMER. THOSE LAZY PUG FUCKERS. THANKS FOR THE INFO
---
Do you know Ash,Bill and Adam?
---
Ur mom
---
Naw dude, this is a freaking video game, I think ur taking it a bit too serious bro, going down 2-4 ranks to get an achievemnt is OK, tf these ppl trying to make rules on a video game bro.. its only unsportsmanlike if you feel bad bro
---
He was using bodyblocking and NOED to guarantee a kill. No way he gets banned.
---
Bodyblocking a survivor to kill them isn't bodyblocking your teammates or holding the game hostage.
---
‚ÄúIs teleporting back from across the map once they‚Äôre off the hook and running away seriously considered camping/tunnelling now?‚Äù
---
Well, yes. I‚Äôm not giving my personal opinion on it but teleporting to the closest gen to a recently unhooked survivor so you can chase them down and re-hook them is what most consider tunnelling.
---
You hold M1 all game. SKILL
---
Well, until he killed you. 
---
It wasn't really a waste if it got him a kill.
---
You can distrust me if you wish, but I do genuinely try my best to be fair to the other team. It's no fun when I get flashlight spammed to hell by one of them, but I'm not allowed to mind game with the Freddy clone or else I'm being toxic. I gave chase until they dropped but didn't focus on anyone in particular. I just outsmarted their looping one too many times I guess *Shrug*
---
You are really not playing the same game as everyone else, huh?
---
Nothing like OG Freddy.
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠ im on xbox 1. Im looking for ppl to play with too.
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT STOP MATCHING ME AGAINST RED RANK CANCER SWF GROUPS IM A FUCKING RANK 12 KILLER IT RUINS THE FUCKING GAME I JUST WANT TO HAVE SOME GOD DAMN FUN
---
Steve‚Äôs a good mom. I can see where the confusion came from
---
So he's supposed to throw away a kill rather than let endgame collapse kill you? Your teammate should've let you die on hook, no killer is stupid enough to move/hit one of you and let the other one most likely escape when timer is ticking
---
I mean if there's nothing else to buy with shards, then it is effectively free bloodpoints.
---
When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie?
---
I GOT FACECAMPED (ON MY FIRST HOOK) BY A RANK 20 BILLY. MY FRIENDS ESCAPED BEFORE I DIED BECAUSE HE JUST STOOD THERE HITTING ME. I NEED TO LEAVE THESE RANKS.
---
#BABY SITTER SKIN
---
Im not saying hag is bad, i main hag myself. Im just saying that with his stealth kit and te ability to teleport at comman like Freddy he might be a bit better.
---
It would be an all nighter finding a game on console
---
Yeah I don't think being an asshole is going to help the kid. How about giving him some actual advice that would help instead of being a dick and telling him to fuck off?
---
I just go chill in the basement or whatever. Don't give shitty, toxic survivors what they want. Make them just stand around like idiots.
---
Id like the option to discuss gameplay right after the fact. Obviously theyd have to put a mute button in with the aftergame voicechat. Theres no reason to have one right now. 
---
I dont wanna deal with writing novels when i could just speak to someone and id rather not ask for advice from people i havent seen play
---
I mean if you regularly get called a camper and tunneler maybe you're the problem?
---
GET THE #### OUT FRANK

THATS ME OMFFG

Would recommend changing his woodland creatures from crows to hoors

we'll be playing games like geometry dash

Probably not for her.
---
It cost 2700 for me, sad face
---
Until you realize that it still technically is a baby Dwight because he‚Äôs someone‚Äôs younger brother trying to play his older brothers favorite game!
---
&gt;Spirit: Hates her dad. Isn't killing her dad.
---
I actually love this part of Spirit's lore. It's unclear whether the entity gave Rin her vengeance right away and the Spirit is just paying it back for eternity or (as I believe) the Entity is constantly dangling the prospect of vengeance over her father like a carrot on a stick as Rin continues to deteriorate into a monster).
---
Do what you gotta do to win bro, sometimes tunneling a guy down is legitimately the best move, sometimes sitting on a hook cuz you know his dipshit teammate Captain HookBomber is near is the move, get that dub guy
---
reboot jason is not in the game.
---
I bought him 14 hours before the shrine change, I'm hoping that the steam refund will work but I'm not hopeful
---
You have a valid point. But in there defense some people are not interested or want to buy other killers and level them up just for there perks. They just want to play the killer they like or are more comfortable playing. For example, I‚Äôve bin wanting the perk pop goes the weasel but I don‚Äôt like to play clown and I‚Äôd rather invest bloodpoints into other killers I like to play like Freddy, Ghostface, and spirit.
---
Ugh you sound like one of those people that's doesn't like something just because it's popular.
---
My point was that I was across the map. 
---
Though I do see how that could be considered tunneling. I didn't just chase the most recently hooked person until they died. Sorry if my wording was unclear. I just used it as a means to get back to them and managed to get lucky with a teleport. I typically let a hooked survivor go once they've been unhooked. But I teleport back to chase their savior.
---
Oh my god yeah that was beautiful to watch, just like the OG films themselves.
---
I don't play this game for the lore. I play it for the challenge. We have 5 gens that need to be repaired in order to escape and 1 killer trying to stop us. It's not rocket science. The less I know about something the better. The only immersion I care about is playing Claudette and crouching in a bush. 
---
Popular Licensed I.P.'s sell video games and Stranger Things is very popular. I want the game to thrive and stick around for as long as possible.
---
I‚Äôm currently at 672 Hours and I don‚Äôt even believe it personally.
---
I remember maybe ~2 years ago I bought this game, and now it‚Äôs just my favourite thing ever.
---
Jason is bigger and sexier üöπ

I played the whole thing. but that person didn't mean anything to me, it was annoying actually. on the other hand having an open ending on such a complicated character is more interesting
---
so steve is dwight 2.0
---
Sort of related but I'm so hyped for the Demigorgon because it paves the way for more non-human Killers. Not saying we'll get a Xenomorph or anything like that but this is definitely a step towards that.
---
This meme should have been dead a month ago but I still see it every day. 90% of the time it adds nothing to the joke.
---
have you seen Jason‚Äôs body? trapper can‚Äôt even compare. plus, Jason satisfies many fetishes trapper can‚Äôt üòî this is so sad
---
What rule are you talking about? This "no non human" thing that people keep saying?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cshi9r/_/exfoakr
---
You know you can just let them out the hatch instead of DCing right?
---
I have to ask what us your rank because that statement is absurd.  Camping and tunneling is not how the killer is meant to be played at all.  It's simply the go to for those that haven't learned how to properly play the role yet.  You will lose so many games camping as you rank up survivors will gen rush you out the match.  Once you get near red ranks even if you faced potatoes and somehow camp your way to a 4K you'll still lose and depip.  The ranking system is the devs way of telling you with absolute certainty that camping is not the intended way to play killer.  They actively punish your rank for doing it.
---
I don't think it does
---
Shame would have been better tbh
---
You‚Äôre wrong and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve never had an erection : (
---
They were asked about Pennywise in a stream a very long time ago I believe. Their response was something along the lines of 'killer clowns are too mainstream in horror. We won't be adding a killer that is a clown to the game.' and then look what came out a while later. They don't say things to get people off the trail, they blatantly lie and make things up on the spot. Poor community work and a poor development team.
---
I'll probably play normally but maybe give the last one the hatch/exit more often
---
Yesterday I got rid of my nurse ritual and immediately got the same ritual. lol
---
That doesn't take from my point. They don't have to die but they disappear from their original world.
---
Steve and Nancy are still running around in Stranger Things
---
Oh, wow, thank you! What a *strange thing*, though: almost 2 months ago, I sent privately that same concept art to BHVR support web site, submitting a ticket, too. A certain Ian replied me that it would have been sent to the devs to review it.. I mean, I don't want to imply bad things, but surely it's a funny coincidence..!
---
Imagine if we find a perk that allows you to stun the killer by throwing a toolbox!
---
I'm seriously thinking those kind of people got abused as a kid and taking kind of revenge by doing these shit.A killer literally DC'd as soon as the match started with 4 gateaus(all from survivors),like what the fuck?
---
I'd do the same, to be honest. No point in letting 2 kills go away when there's so little time on EGC, besides the risk of DS and BT.
---
That's primarily it, it allows more visibility for the player because of less particles and not as harsh lighting.
---
I don't like it because the whole point is that the killers are extracting dread and terror from the survivors to feed the Entity. That's why The Entity chose them. But the Demogorgon is an unthinking predatory killing machine, it wouldn't think to hook a survivor it would just eat them. The Entity wouldn't pick a wild animal to be a killer because a killer needs to be able to linger success in front of the survivor's face to give them hope before ripping it away. The Demogorgon wouldn't do that, the Demogorgon wouldn't behave how The Entity would want them to which would probably lead to The Entity simply kicking them out of their realm or killing them. It makes no sense and undermines the main concept of the entire DBD setting and makes it feel like it isn't DBD anymore.
---
Definitely not always the best move, more often than not, it can be very inefficient, and good survivors will punish you for it, game sense is about knowing when to spread the pain around and when to focus someone down
---
Also my build was:
---
NOED
---
Remember Me
---
Sloppy Butcher 
---
Blood warden
---
No Add ons 
---
Moldy oak offering
---
people are going to hate you and say you are using a crutch with a NoED focused build but you do you.
---
Personally seems a bit memey. NoED and Blood Warden basically means you have two dead perks for 90% of the game. Your blood points are also going to be minimal if you focus on just killing everyone in the last few seconds if that matters to you. I'd also say save the best for last is important because hitting or worse whiffing consumes a lot of time and being able to machine gun m1 attacks ASAP seems like it would be important.
---
I'm sure there is more then just the teleport
---
Hear me out for the Big Brain Plays boys: "AoE gen kick" + Overcharge
---
Side note as someone who really enjoys being a gen jockey Nancy's perks sound really interesting. I do also like playing a protector role from time to time so Steve also sounds interesting. Really hyped for the reveal stream tomorrow!
---
I would replace PWYF with Remember Me, but the build is good!
---
Against coordinated full SWF I probably get MAYBE 20k with one kill if I‚Äôm lucky.  I‚Äôll get some hooks but usually struggle to get the kill. I went on a frustrating streak vs red rank SWF that I started running NOED just to have a trump card. Started having some success with the NOED.
---
The dimension thing isn't new, it already pulls people from different dimensions/alternate realities.
---
The new thing is probably that it always looked for strong human emotions to pull its victims in, the demogorgon doesn't have those (though that can be rewritten without really changing lore)
---
As a big fan of D&amp;D I'd love this.
---
This is trash
---
its a tactic used in basically every video game. Put your PC on the lowest setting to remove as much visual noise as humanly possible so you can focus on important things and react faster.
---
They also put him in mortal kombat X. They can totally get him in game, it would be hard but worth it. Especially since they could do reboot jason which characteristically fits better into dbd
---
I think they should make it immune to lights i mean it doesn't seem to habe any eyes so it wouldn't make sense for it to work
---
I assumed it was based on the game where one person stays to keep the generator going and then the Entity grabbed them once the other 3 were far enough away that they couldn't see him get grabbed behind all the tanks.
---
Not all the killers have the strong human emotions. They a pulled because they have abilities to draw those emotions out in the Survivors.
---
This is the best way to approach them. and also dont do any try hard builds if ur in rank 20
---
&gt;Laurie mains when they hit DS in the middle of an open field ~~they created~~ and get downed 10 seconds after using DS

holy shit that second demogorgon perk. Wow, that could actually be really top tier
---
Billy is in the 'Fuck You' tier :)
---
We can‚Äôt have a lifeform from another dimension

But we can have a tall tree boi with a dinky bell that makes him on invisible
---
I swear this kinda thing soothes my soul. Nothing better than salty gamers.
---
But if it countered those it would be good. And it is complete trash. Becuase it counters nothing.
---
Because you now need 3 protection hits, which is honestly wayyy too hard of a proc condition
---
Lol. Ok dude. They were lying and 100% said in bad faith that they'd never do a iconic killer archetype while probably working on said iconic killer archetype.
---
Very useful, I‚Äôm gonna try bond now. Can you recommend a stealth build for me? like a lot of usage and stealthy üôèüôèüôè
---
That was gold not gonna lie.
---
Lol I feel dumb for not realizing the ghostface had a completely different name from the movies. Even if it's a different ghostface, they all die one way or another right? I havent watched Scream 3 &amp; 4 but it should be safe to assume that the killers died too.
---
no hes not...
---
It‚Äôs actually incredible how pc players can make the red light so visible
---
I'm excited to see just what the fuck that killer is. Haven't seen Stranger Things and I'm not going to either but that thing looks insane. It'll be the first time for me that a licensed killer gets added that I have no clue about.
---
I wasn‚Äôt responding to you anyways
---
This is honestly one of the worst parts of playing a lot of games, is comparing the rest of life to the price of games.
---
I recently went to play some laser tag with my (also-gamer) friends, and it was $18 for 3 hours. Sure those 3 hours were super fun, but factoring for gas, we instead could have each gotten a $20 game that would probably entertain us for tens if not hundreds of hours.
---
&gt;BHVR didn‚Äôt get the likeness to Haley
---
Of course they did. The current rights holders would have the rights to Haley and so came with the licensing deal, the actor isnt just going to let them use his likeness without having the rights.... and paying for them.
---
And yeah of course you could take a new actor and dress him up as Freddy but whats the point in that?.... everyone is asking for the iconic Robert Englund version not a knockoff Sharp Hand Joe.
---
Hey that's my shitpost! :)
---
The entity can help guide the demogorgon to do its bidding and keeps him around because it thinks the demogorgon is cute. Boom, problem solved.
---
The Entity is basically a hive mind
---
and of course he has noed
---
I actually agree with this. I just started the series and am three episodes in. I got the feeling I was supposed to think he was douchey by his treatment of Jonathan, but Jonathan was creeping on them at the party. I definitely understood why he was hostile towards him. 
---
That said, I am very early on in the series. So maybe something else happens that makes season 1 Steve a douche.
---
We dont know the full extent of his power, he just has some kind if teleport
---
Yep.
---
Doc = Zap Daddy, Zappyboi

The real mindfuckery comes in when you wonder if it's video games that are cheap or is it everything else that's expensive.

Not everyone can play Bubba.  I can understand the intimidating factors.

Yeah, you're right. I actually completely forgot about that until after I commented that and went to check.
---
They couldn‚Äôt secure licensing with the original actress
---
I'm pretty sure there's an official Michael Myers LEGO figurine. Pretty sure anyways.
---
This has to be a thing holy shit
---
If he can force the Hag, the Shape, and the Nightmare to hook survivors for him, forcing the Demogorgon to is easy peasy by comparison.

You‚Äôre leaving out the part where this 8ft lovecraftian horror from an alternate reality is also controlled by a hive mind. The entity is a godlike being. Is it really hard to think, lorewise, it could just simulate the Mind Flayer‚Äôs control over the Demagorgon?
---
Love it! Looks like a well balanced change that adds unique flavor to the Bull. Hope to see this implemented one day!
---
Care to share? ü•∫

Nah they are greedy and dont look wgat community wants.

Remember pre rework DS and how every killer main ever complained about it? That‚Äôs how I feel about Ruin

Well I can easily make this meme in photoshop. It's just that it is way easier and faster this way. After all it's about the context and not about how I made this meme.

Wait you bought him but still used shards for his perks?

You know you can level up characters without playing them.

Easy solution, ‚ÄúThe Entity has gotten stronger and can do this now‚Äù

Its all an opinion and this Comment u Made makes u officialy the worlds  saddest little cunt
---
I am excited about the survivors but I‚Äôm an really interested to see how the demogorgon feels and plays. As a survivor main I‚Äôm actually excited to see Nancy a little more because I feel like she‚Äôs meant to do both be immersed and run the killer.
---
U gei
---
original actress as in heather langenkamp in the first movie or rooney mara in the reboot?
---
I doubt it, considering their content guidelines (Looks like they‚Äôre loosening now with Stranger Things and Friends getting sets), but I‚Äôll see if I can find anything. I know they‚Äôre are custom dogs for most movie killers so it might have been one of those you saw
---
I'm going to give you a really good tip I picked up from Entity Education who got it from Twitch streamer Scorpionz.
---
Don't crouch all the time! Instead, run Whispers and Monitor &amp; Abuse. Monitor &amp; Abuse will make your terror radius smaller than the indication for Whispers, so it allows you to know when you need to crouch in order to ambush properly without anyone hearing your heartbeat. This will increase your mobility significantly as opposed to crouching all the time just in case there's a survivor.
---
You know its funny, I tried what you people are suggesting just earlier today. I wanted to get play some Trapper, who is very low level on my account because I don't play him. Not very optimal perks and a pretty much agreed upon lower-tier killer. And sure, I had a few games that went semi-okay. But it wasn't really fun, because half the time I felt powerless to do anything but react. And then there was the game where two survivors, one obsession, the other flashlight, ran me around my set-up area while the other two did gens and I couldn't get more than one hook because they played without making mistakes, so I was pretty much just following them for no reason. And yes, I lost them every now and again to try and keep my gens in check but that doesn't really work now does it, with four survivors alive and three gens left.
---
because i think they were restricted to the reboot characters in the first place
---
A wraith in the wild wow. Props to you
---
&gt;That made no sense to me, the objective of killer is to ultimately get a 4k and pip
---
My objective is maximum bloodpoints and 0 or -1 pips. If I play for pips the survivors get too good. Lol.
---
The one looping you won't mind a trap as they are there to distract you till they die. Trap the heads of the ones doing gens not looping. The looper will then have to change their strategy cause it isn't working. Just ignore the looper until you can force them to give up a hit like while saving their friend.
---
Enough reddit for today
---
I delivered papers when I was 12-15, took a small half an hour route didn't talk to a single person. Pay wasn't much but outside of birthday/Christmas funded all of my video games.
---
Facts, in P5 when their souls gotswitched, the VAs did the most 10/10 job getting the other characters manners down and the way they talk, it was godly, DP doesnt let down
---
Her crouch/ambush can be amazing in (select) loops. If the loop is short and has high walls, they cannot see you when you crouch and it makes it hard from them to stay on the opposite side of you. Once they're confused, you can quickly ambush them before they drop the pallet.
---
I'm trying really hard not to respond to few of these comments lol
---
Even better: they make no noise aka they don't notify the killer when they vault or open a locker so it can work it bt nicely
---
I have iOS and switched to the Denmark store to do it lol. If you search on YouTube ‚Äúhow dead by Daylight iOS or Android‚Äù you‚Äôll be able to find a good how to.

Corrupt intervention is friccin good also

IT'S REALLY KIND OF YOU TO HAVE ALSO GOTTEN HIM FOR YOUR FRIEND!

Wow you're so cool and quirky not getting excited at something like everyone else man, I'm so impressed.

Somehow I had ruin, devour hope, and huntress lullaby all get cleansed at the same time in one of the games i played

IMAGINE COMPLAINING ABOUT POP
---
JUST WOW
---
Anyone know a good farming method with bbq and chili?
---
if The Entity could do that, why does it not do that for every single Killer? It is mentioned on several occasions that The Entity has to offer the killer something in return. Usually in the form of their special supernatural ability or just the opportunity to fulfill their bloodlust in perpetuity. If the Entity could outright control Killers, why do each of them have long cooldowns after hitting an attack where they inspect and relish in the blood of their victims sprayed across their weapon after a singular slash?
---
Just means you are at low ranks most likely. And there's nothing wrong with that.
---
But try LF at rank 4 and tell me you are still having fun.
---
NO WAY. FREDDY IS BY FAR THE MOST FUN TO PLAY AGAINST
---
First person caught is infinitely more likely than some personal grudge. Do you know him?
---
That real in person social interaction is important though. Looking back on the last decade or so I‚Äôve don‚Äôt quite a bit. Most of the time was spent playing Starcraft for thousands of hours with my friends. Literally 10+ years of Starcraft for hours a day. It was a blast. But I don‚Äôt really remember those moments exactly. Not the same way I look back and vividly remember the times I went out to beaches or amusement parks or just out on the town with friends.
---
Quality shitpost.
---
it is ms related 100% you cant do this with good ping killers
---
When is it more optimal to spread hooks out instead of killing one survivor.
---
Please give an example.
---
It‚Äôs less unsportsmanlike than lag switching to get it; I‚Äôve run into so many ppl cheating for an adept after this rank reset
---
You can't even compare an actual huge content update with 1 perk in the Shrine that most player already has. Stranger Things is huge news. BBQ in the shrine, not really.
---
I don‚Äôt like the distance requirement, but it does need a change. What if instead of instadowns it gives the broken status effect for some period of time?
---
The rule doesn't apply regardless. If Hillbilly was blocking the entire team up here and there was absolutely no way to progress the game, that's holding the game hostage.
---
If Hillbilly was holding three survivors up here and one was the single guy who did all five generators, opened the exit gates, left, and then these three were sacrificed, that's not holding the game hostage - the game is able to progress beyond the Killer's entrapment of three players.
---
It's a dumb rule and it's not really possible in many situations, but this should absolutely be fixed to allow another way down someway.
---
How do you get purple tier abilities? Asking as someone who's never played DBD
---
You are providing advice on how to lose games!  You admitted the playstyle deranks you which we all knew anyways but new and inexperienced players pop on here and it annoys me to see someone being completely disingenuous to them by claiming a playstyle you know for a fact loses you games is "literally how you're supposed to play killer".  What you do is literally the exact opposite of what you're supposed to do as killer if you want to win your games, improve at killer or both.
---
Ah, that‚Äôs absolutely true nevermind
---
Nah, hitting you means you could've gotten away. Hitting you with NOED before your team escaped means one of them could've dropped a pallet or used a light to free you.
---
The only way to guarantee this kill was to camp you like he did.
---
The Entity just "growing in power" is possibly the most asspull-y excuse outside of maybe "THE ENTITY GAINED A NEW SUPER SAIYAN FORM SO NOW IT CAN PUNCH HARDER AND WIIIIIN" that kinda power escalation writing BS has ruined a lot of fiction that I loved. So if that's the in-lore excuse for why The Entity can pull in such dumb, lore breaking nonsense then I guess DBD is just another casualty of power creep in writing. Shame, I used to actually really like this game's lore.
---
*NOED intensifies*
---
You can loop her until her power comes back (which takes what 10 seconds?) and then it's a guessing game where the spirit has every advantage.
---
I don't care one way or the other about Steve, but having a Nancy in the game tickles my inner fanboy.  I can't wait to kill her over and over again with Freddy, in honor of the NOES Chapter that could have been.
---
Lets look at this from a different scenario
---
A hawk just grievously wounded a small animal in an open plain, the hawk decided to fly back up into the sky for plot-related reasons. The hawk then sees another small animal helping out the wounded animal, the wounded animal is clearly at a disadvantage because of the fact that they are extremely close to death, assuming the stronger animal leaves when it becomes clear the hawk is back in the area, what is the hawk going to do? 
---
***Kill the fucking weaker animal*** 
---
Don't ever feel bad about a play you did, if you know you can rehook the survivor in a timely manner then do it, if it makes more logical sense to chase down the savior, ***then do it. There is no logical reason why an apex predator would let a dying animal escape unless the apex predator gets outmaneuvered, when you are placed into a situation where you are the apex predator, why is this any different?***
---
On the other hand, this is a different story when it comes to quite literally focusing all of your efforts on one survivor and making no progress towards hindering their survival, but instead of changing directions, continuing to focus that survivor. Imo there's a fine line between a chase and a tunnel, and it all comes down to progress ( and if they're your obsession ), if you make 0 progress in a 3 minute long chase, I would call it a tunnel ( the killer has focused all of his efforts on you regardless of how detrimental it might be for said killer )
---
In the end, the differences between someone chasing and someone tunneling all boils down to salt, because no matter what you do and how you play, someone is going to be annoyed lmao.
---
***Just play how you want, and enjoy the game, if someone gets mad at you while you're on a killer, then you did your job well.***
---
Not only camping on hooks, but just camping in general.

You can use it by waiting on a hot spot untill you see some one, or wait at a gen or gate.

I was farming a baby Dwight last night. He kept trying so hard, hid in a corner once that was so obvious that I just laughed, looked directly at him and did a slow head shake at him. He ran and I cackled. Caught the guy camping the hatch, and let baby Dwight live.

Has every advantage? Maybe if they're playing with ear bleeding volumes, possibly.  But she can't vault when she's in it and she can't see you. The only thing that needs a nerf for spirit is some addons, her base kit is fine.

Huntress is not stupid as these forums make her be. She fully understand what she is doing. She got bored of hunting animals and decided to hunt humans. She kill for sport not out of need.
---
"When unsuspecting travellers came through her woods, she discovered her new favourite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. She liked to collect their tools and colourful garments and especially toys when there were little ones. But she could never bring herself to kill the little girls.
---
Girls she would take back to her house, deep in the woods. They were precious, and looking at them woke up something deep in her heart. She craved the closeness of a loved one, a child of her own. Among the pillaged wooden toys, dolls and story books she couldn't read, the girls would be tied by the neck with a rough and chafing rope fastened firmly to the wall. She couldn't let them wander off, or they would surely die outside.
---
Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness. Every time, it plunged Anna deeper into pain and sorrow and madness. She was compelled to try again, and started raiding the nearest villages to slaughter families and kidnap their daughters. She wore one of the animal masks her mother crafted for her so many years earlier to try to calm the frightened children. Villagers spread the legend of a half-beast lurking in Red Forest: The Huntress, who killed men and ate little girls."
---
So she's enough of a psychopath that her first thought upon seeing humans wasn't "They're like me!", but "I want their stuff," or even "I have a duty to kill things in this forest" since she was trying to BRING herself to kill, as though her mother taught her to just murder everything indescriminately.
---
She's also apparently so stupid she can't figure out that children need food and shelter, like she does, or identify emotions at all.
---
Even if she wasn't TAUGHT that much besides hunting before her mother died, she should still be smart enough to figure some of these things out if she managed to not get herself killed. Jason managed with water on the brain.

What's happens when every survivor shines a flashlight at it?
---
YOU FORGOT TO SAY SIKE
---
*sad Jason noises*
---
I'm confused, are the two sandbagging and preventing you from going into the building? Why isn't the killer hitting them?
---
Yeah it's fun seeing that salt after Insidious Bubba game.
---
This is a great idea, love your names proposals too
---
I always send good game or give a tip if they were weak somewhere. I rarely get a reply on Ps4. I send haha hilarious or funny stickers if they think they are trolling me. Had a Bubba play fully confused when he got a haha message after downing me then offered a s'more while he camped. He stopped camping me and I got the hatch cause everyone was sending him salt.
---
It would've been perfect, i know
---
I don't think it does counter them. I believe it countered it in ptb when it got changed to unhook and protection hits, but when it turned into only protection hits they also took the instadown counter, or the update after that
---
I can't stand his chainsaw noise!!! Otherwise I would be.
---
I just realised this while I was on the toilet
---
The objective of the game is to rank up, which is done by pipping in a match, bp and shards are nice to have, but are by no means the primary objective, judging by the attitude you take towards it, I assume you‚Äôre not a very high rank?
---
Hey that‚Äôs 100% of my games because I‚Äôm a shit killer!
---
We don't know.
---
Yes, true. I'd still rather BHVR make actually useful perks.
---
I was thinking this. A free Overcharge on gens around you sounds pretty damn good.
---
I think it's great on stalking killers (Myers, Ghostface) or on killers who actually CAN disappear like that (Hag, Spirit).
---
*Sad Bubba Noises*
---
? I don‚Äôt understand.
---
Wait what do you mean tomorrow?
---
ARE YOU A NEW PLAYER? AND DO YOU ONLY PLAY SURVIVOR?
---
Dave Richard said that Quentin was a much more interesting character to them (which he is), and if they couldn‚Äôt get original Nancy Thompson they didn‚Äôt want to go for Holbrook, her lesser counterpart.
---
Yeah they seem like they are fun to play. I only really play dbd with friends so this is a survivors perspective
---
The killer is prolly afk
---
How about this
---
Run sideways. Simple. Spirit can't predict where you go from there, you aren't standing still or running in a straight line. Don't be dumb.
---
If it's bug that means it's gonna get fixed soon, better to get something that works in the long run
---
Got 200k during a double BP event, I shat myself
---
Claudettes always become blendettes.  Feel no shame for nipping those assholes in the bud.
---
I do.
---
On the plus side there's still more perks to be revealed. Plus this article isn't completely confirmed so hold out hope until tomorrow's stream.
---
(hug kenny)
---
Oink oink!
---
WAS IT OBVIOUS?
---
One of his addons should be a *dirty hoe.*
---
Might be able to make a case for making Dance With Me viable??
---
This is so ridiculous that I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest if that's what happened
---
&gt;Better Add ons certainly couldn‚Äôt hurt, either.
---
They need to completely rework his addons because most of them are completely useless it's actually sad.
---
I only bought DBD because I heard that Freddy was coming to it. I then fell in love with the game, and though I adore BHVR‚Äôs original characters, I actually still only play licensed ones (Ash, Freddy, Michael and Ghostface). I‚Äôd imagine it will be the exact same case for those coming to the game only because of Stranger Things and we should just embrace this. Anything that expands the playerbase is good to me.
---
KIND OF LOL
---
Good manners lmaoooooo that's a good one
---
WELL, FAIR ENOUGH. IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO TELL YOU WHAT IS OR IS NOT ANNOYING TO YOU
---
Heroes dont steal &gt;:(
---
Well, that's weird because everyone else on this post understood what I meant besides you. Maybe reread it again, or a few comments.
---
I dont think any offering should be secret
---
Got to love the fact that you can tea bag survivors as pig and ghostface and them calling you toxic for teabagging them when they teabag you and flashlight you at a pallet
---
I have no friends :'(
---
Well...
---
I was literally *this* close to typing the exact thing
---
With the hag yes, but in this situation all he had to do was listen
---
Same.
---
I wouldn't like that
---
Spoiler, your console is overheating. As the game kicks up rendering, your console gets too hot and shuts down.
---
Thermal paste doesn't last forever! Gets worse if you smoke / vape / cook near your Xbox. Animal hair is the worst though!
---
IVE ONLY BEEN PLAYING FOR A LITTLE UNDER A MOTNH NOW SO ITS PROBABLY JUST MY LACK OF GAME KNOWLEDGE. ILL TRY TO GET USED TO HIM.
---
Honest question I know its frustrating when people in your scenario dc to stop you from a kill or help the rest escape, but why not laugh they just wasted 10-15 minutes running around just to dc lose 2 pips and get no bps, you as killer still get bps for the dc. I just laugh when I'm playing killer and people dc, I frustrated them enough to just flat out leave. As survivor I get more mad when people dc because it makes it basically impossible to escape after that.
---
Orange means it's a teachable.
---
Everybody gangster till the tier 3 myers starts moonwalking towards you
---
It makes it more certain now that the development team actually does look at this subreddit for perk ideas, which I don‚Äôt object to haha.
---
6.5 more days
---
10/10
---
HONESTLY THE REASON HE'S MY FAVE TO PLAY AGAINST IS JUST THE BUBBLE CLOCK. I LOVE BUBBLE CLOCK :3
---
I've just had a guy about half an hour ago say I didn't deserve to win after a 4K with Ghostface. I wasn't camping, tunneling or any other thing they usually complain about. Instead this time I was "bad at the game". Some survivors will literally find anything to complain about and disregard the fact that maybe I was just better that game.
---

WHAT IS A BABY MEG? I JUST PLAYED WITH 2 AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO KNOW
---
Do you want end game collapse? This is how ypu get end game collapse.
---
Hardy har har
---
That's what they were saying.
---
that is surprisingly low
---
This made me laugh because its true haha. I've had BBQ since day one on the game both on console and PC and I see it in the shrine and like "Ooh more bloodpoints for me,"
---
Thank you I'm here all night
---
WHAT PART OF FREDDY TRIPS YOU UP? MAYBE I CAN GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE IF YOU WANT!
---
To be fair, im pretty sure the devs said "Humanoids only" and not "Humans only" and also the Demogorgon is quite intelligent if you've ever watched the show.  It isn't a dumb creature.
---
Tbh the humanoid scps would be cool killers on dbd

And they already have a system / wording for this!

The guy who made a "fake nancy" art and perk list post before ST was even announced had the generator obsession idea, he must have known.
---
While i imagine the Demogorgon will follow the basic abilities of other killers, we don't know EXACTLY how it works yet.  I mean the thing doesn't even have eyes so what if it's vision is echolocation or something?  Maybe the Demogorgon has a "different type of hook" but still synergies with hook-based perks.

Terrible build for ranking up but if you just are looking to mess around and get some kills go for it I guess.
---
&gt;New Line Cinema do not own the likeness rights. No company does to their actors.
---
This is where you are incorrect. When signing an actors contract contained in that contract is the rights to your image as the character you are depicting for a set term. Usually for X amount of years, (or months for an advertising campaign) with an option for it to be extended if need be.  Also included in there would be a list of usage types of your image covered in the contract, so use of your image in merchandising, marketing, licensing, billboards, video, TV cinema, radio (for voice) etc etc etc. It can get extensive.
---
When the agreed term runs out the rights holder (or former rights holder at this stage) has the option to renew by paying another agreed amount of money for X amount of time, or to let it die.
---
This is very standard practise for actors contracts. I worked in advertising and film and we've used a lot of them and have had actors agents kick up a stink if we stray outside its bounds. I can 100% guarantee you Haley's likeness was tied up in one of these and obtained by BHVR.  In NO WAY would they use it otherwise or they would be sued in a flash.
---
Least played: Claudette
---
Top 3:
---
1: Shirtless David
---
2: Shirtless David
---
3: Shirtless David
---
Most played: Shirtless David
---
I got sent a clip of people chain disconnecting exactly like this the other day! One survivor got sacced, and the other three disconnected with like 5 seconds between them.
---
Immune to blind, yes, but doesn‚Äôt it have severe light sensitivity in the show?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt have to look exactly like this, the visuals for DnD are up for interpretation so I don‚Äôt think licensing could be too much of an issue
---
I think she over played the hasn't slept in three days angle and ended up being dull for most people. I really liked the movie but I'm an easy get, plus the visuals were really cool
---
Only if you‚Äôre planning to save directly in front of the killer, as opposed to the killer being close but not looking at you. Otherwise BT goes unused
---
They probably didn't laugh at its jokes.
---
This exact thing happened to my girlfriend when she started playing. Close the game and reopen it now, because all the progress she made before closing it was lost lol.
---

Carl is love. Carl is life.
---
Not to mention Bubba isn't that strong of a killer without addons. And even then he doesn't do well in higher ranks. I have 0 interest in playing him, and the Shrine allowed me to avoid grinding him and allowed me to focus killers and survivors I wanted. Finally got Head On on David and I am working on getting Ruin as a teachable instead.
---
I got the ‚ÄúNurse is a trash killer that takes no skill‚Äù even though I had a 4k
---
How long will ps4 have to wait?
---
It‚Äôs warranted, but he broke his expensive camera and spread rumours about Nancy with no direct provocation
---
This should be pinned at the top until next month.
---
Oh, when they said they didn't want to do a clown killer because some people may have a "clown phobia" and it would be too upsetting for them? lol
---
No, I was stuck with the name of the map on my screen
---
I might be misremembering, but the whole Nancy is a slut spray paint and the way he treated Jonathan in the early episodes was pretty shitty honestly. But otherwise I don't think there is much
---
Honestly that's a pretty effective use of those trash common items
---
He‚Äôs already got 1/4 devourness, I doubt it
---
I get it, I do.
---
Thing is, I bought LF for BBQ and I *hate* playing him. Rather than play a killer I hate for a *chance* at a single perk to show up for Killers I like to play, I can buy the perk outright.
---
So it can maybe show up in someone else's BW.
---
Just easier this way.
---
I was stuck with the map on my screen, only seeing auras of gens
---
That's because people are the easiest to manipulate when they feel strong emotions. A being like the Demogorgon would be even easier to manipulate
---
Oh yeah i think they added that dumbass reason too lmfao
---
[deleted]
---
I personally use low settings because everything looks better and lines are much crisper.
---
This is amazing, keep it up
---
*enter leatherface*
---
Oh i see
---
No clue. Steam will probably have it's public test build next week for about a week and then sometime in September it'll release on all platforms, no confirmed date.
---
What about things like vaulting and locker searching?
---
Well if it got removed from the killer then where would it go? Might as well put it on the survivor for the vine
---
Dude i find the flashlight hard to land so i waste them all and like 90% of the time ppl bring franlkins, ims guessing flashlihhts are op at high ranks
---
ITS MINE NOW *pallet stuns you*
---
I forget the exact explanation the dm came up with, but it was certainly a series of unfortunate events. He chose a cantrip at random and it happened to be the only one that could damage the dragon. Then we rolled for initiative...
---
You're welcome friend
---
We don't know what the demigorgons are in the lore of Strangers Things. They may as well be whatever descendants or related to humans in some way. They're bodies are actually fairly similar for it to just be chalked up to coincidence.
---
And this is why I use insidious with bubba. They t bag. I act like a leave yo go chase another survivor (but really I just camp right by the gate). You'd be surprised how many people I've killed like this
---
The Entity feeds on the emotions of the survivors, not the killers
---
Oh shit! Good call! I didn't even pay attention to that! I saw the map name and just figured it was the beginning of the match. I played one last night where the killer spawned right next to me. Started off with a good little chase! I didn't think that was supposed to happen! LOL!
---
Non player hosted servers as in BHVR hosts the games to prevent the lag spikes that happen a lot. Only issue is some players playing from far away may experience higher ping but most modern games are running on private servers. It also makes it very hard to cheat, more than it currently is.
---
Mortal kombat happened before the big liscencing lawsuit so now it would be way too much trouble to get him in 
---
Maybe one day
---
[X] doubt
---
weird copy, but ok
---
They also said we wouldn't get a clown or talking characters. Look where we are now
---
It interrupts her blinking.
---
No way, man. These shards are for Ghost Waifu. You kids and your disgustingly poorly balanced perks can eat each other for all I care.
---
Gotcha!!!
---
This movie is so underrated
---
But the Joker is basically the same as the Clown, they both fuck around with gas so I don't think they will ever put the Joker in.
---
Do people really think that? I‚Äôm new to the community but fuck man how is he op he is probably the weakest of all of the killers.
---
What copy
---
Why bush bad?
---
Dude thinks probably the single most iconic slasher of all time isnt popular because he isnt in DbD lol...
---
How dare you challenge my tin foilery!
---
Some killers want to be there though
---
She got it at some little store called pampling, or something in Cadiz, spain. 
---
Tho i suspect you can get it on an online store p easy
---
Dude I‚Äôm new I‚Äôm not poor I just don‚Äôt have time to play 6 hours a day and I kinda want that soo shut frick up and stop flexing on us new players
---
That's a quarter of the BP cap...?
---
Remaining at the gate for 2 minutes should just give the Killer a gun, honestly.
---
THE WAY HE CAN LOCK DOWN LOOPS. ILL TRY TO PALLET LOOP HIM OUT OF FEAR FOR HIS LONG LUNGE ATTACK, BUT I CANT SEEM TO ADAPT TO HIS BLOOD SPOTS.
---
Tapp still has his throat scar.
---
That shouldn‚Äôt have happened lol, it‚Äôs never for me anyways. I think OP meant that the map name was there the whole game so everything else didn‚Äôt show ip
---
Some people care about the lore though
---
Ty im sure you look breathtaking.
---
The guy was spinning on the other side of the entity blocker, i only had about 20 seconds, and no idea where it was lol.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST 3 SWF TODAY WITHIN 5 MATCHES. IM JUST TRYING TO LEARN THE NEW KILLER THAT I JUST BOUGHT BUT I END UP HAVING TO DEAL WITH FLASHLIGHTS, KEYS AND TEABAGGING AT EVERY PALLET. I DONT MIND BEING DESTROYED BUT ENOUGH WITH THE BM ALREADY I JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN TOO. OH AND PLEASE STOP GIVING ME RANK 2 AND 3 WHEN IM A RANK 10 KILLER THANKS.
---
Now that would be a horror stealth killer
---
Michael has no cool down when coming out of stalk, so you can walk up to the survivor and immediately leave stalk to grab them off the generator. Wraith has to uncloak, which takes time even with his strongest add-ons. 
---
So unless you‚Äôve managed to box the survivor in, it‚Äôs difficult to get a generator grab unless they‚Äôre deaf and blind.
---
Do it on rank reset
---
Empathy, Iron Will, Bond, and Tenacity. 
---
....have a feeling a lot of people didn't read the question right and responded with their in game perk builds. 
---
It is an interesting question, just wish more people had answered correctly XD LOL
---
What if all the survivors are up stairs and no one can get past the killer. What then.
---
As a neverwinter fan this would please me
---
Exactly, Demo knows it's stuff
---
unbreakable + ds with laurie is a 5000 IQ move, because killers always slug lauries
---
Several reasons:
---
1. PTSD - Flashlights used to be mega op in general.  Negative memories = punishment despite the relative nerf.
---
2. Suck without friends rely on them heavily as they have one person stalk the killer in a chase and get the blind for a save.
---
3. Generally, only trolls run flashlights in solo to either abuse with clicking macro (which can still crash the game), or as a general taunt to the killer.   In a chase with another survivor and pallet drops, they will show up to blind you every fucking time.   
---
Flashlight trolls get franklin'd, camped, and/or mori.
---
No I‚Äôm saying to counter the perk you have too play smart and pop gens when it‚Äôs safe or if someone is at a good pallet it won‚Äôt be hard you have too adapt
---
Just because they wont give us shirtless myers does not mean they don‚Äôt care
---
lol you want an ultimate fuck you build? Run Rancor, Remember Me, Dying Light and NOED. 
---
Literally just patrol the map till you find the obsession. Keep hitting them to get your remember me stacks. Follow them around till 5th gen is completed then down and mori. Now survivors are stuck at the exit gate for forever while you have a insta down. Omega BM
---
Dont see why they would. They are the only company thus far that has pulled off a truly succesful asymetrical multiplayer horror themed game. An idea that that has been a dream of a lot of games since the mid 2000s. Its not perfect, but they've managed to do a pretty damn good job, and the playerbase is still showing no sign of actually dwindling, unlike all other attempts at this style of game, before and since.
---
Reported thats illegal
---
 I'm pretty sure a dev has said that if the autocheat detects the modified game files and bans you or whatever, they won't help you get your account back
---
Myers above Nurse and Plague above Spirit AND Hillbilly? Yikes
---
I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs nice to have our own version of ds
---
Basically the same format from the same image yesterday [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ct1z1l/stranger\_beans/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ct1z1l/stranger_beans/)
---
I'm gonna be a bad man, am sorry.
---
Does that also applies to any framerate file mods I've seen people talk about?
---
1) rare addon LOST
---
2) perfect timing
---
3) risky af
---
4) easy to outplay
---
Honestly, a red mori is waaay less balanced or fair then this.
---
Alot of companies support their game for a year or 2 with content tops.  Theyre continuing to release licensed content in 2019 and that deserves praise
---
You say that as if it‚Äôs some kind of disease you can catch.
---
Literally does nothing. Doesn‚Äôt hamper your game in the slightest.
---
Ah, you see, it's a 500 iq mind game, killers will think running DS on Laurie is stupid and nobody would do that because it's obvious, but if u do run DS on Laurie killers will be like she probably doesn't have it cuz that's just dumb and tHen bOom stUn
---
Base points = 32k
---
BBQ / WGLF points = 32k
---
5x 100% BP offerings = 160k
---
Total = 224k
---
If there is double BP you add another 32k, which means the absolute max one can get in a match is 256k.
---
Its called gaining a idea from someone not stealing /s
---
Falls under parody law.
---
try running away lol
---
But...end game timer...
---
I know little of DBD lore (for now) so forgive me, but if the issue is them still being alive in "our world," (the Right Side Up?), couldn't the Entity's realm be similar to The Upside Down?  
---
The Mindflayer was able to pull various people into that realm (granted if you find an entry you can just enter too)
---
Allow me to explain, its basically a meme. Basically myers is superior to all killers for some reason maybe because he‚Äôs built like a chad or something. In my list i put him higher than nurse as a joke. But if i was serious he would be mid tier so he would be in the ‚Äúbalanced killers‚Äù section. While the rest of the killers are put in their actual spots, myers was placed above nurse as a joke.
---
Do u get him all the way leveled up or did u level him up ?
---
In most cases when that occurs, its due to dwindling interest in the game, regardless of whether or not the individual player notices. If each DLC they drop has progressively lower sales, as is very frequently the case, then its only a matter of time before the company decides that its no longer worth the cost of production.
---
He doesn't exist with malicious intent
---
He *is* malicious intent
---
You literally got bbq at level 2
---
Sounds like you have some crazy bad luck. I usually play survivor, but barely see keys from either side. Let alone see a survivor escape using a key. Moris are still a bit rare, but I see them more often than a key.
---
Lachappa dad
---
This was pretty cool until I realized it was a Bubba. Y'all didn't have a chance.
---
I just want a sefie with him
---
Actually I think she only really recognized little kids because she still sees herself as a child. She's learned to survive in the wild and to hunt, but beyond that she has got the mind of a small child because she never had the opportunity to develop properly.
---
All of these perks were suggested by reddit community lol
---
Do you have a point?  Or are you just looking to try to argue about literally nothing?  Point is they pump new lifeblood into this game to this day with consistency.  Instead of making a new game and abandoning it.
---
I do my job at gens. I save people and run the killer around. Gates are open. Haven‚Äôt been hooked all game. Timmy the trapper gets one hit on me cuz he‚Äôs super fast. I die. 
---
Moral of the story if I am doing my job well I should be rewarded. If the other guy isn‚Äôt, he should not be rewarded.
---
I'll watch him from afar to know exactly where to plunge my knife
---
It was at that moment he knew, he fucked up
---
I'm actually not arguing at all? Just explaining why they haven't abandoned it, and why many other games often do go abandoned as you are describing.
---
But I already have it
---
I'd be OKAY playing agaisnt nurse if everyone used that skin
---
The item served it's purpose, by healing, that wouldn't really fit with the term lost.
---
Good red rank Spirits will fuck over ANY red rank survivor within 60 seconds tops. The only Problem for her downing times is her Power cooldown.
---
Being able to Walk INVISIBLY with high movement speed and attacking out of stealth is not counterable by any survivor. Let them be as Good as possible.
---
Seems like you're countering something I said, when nothing I said was wrong.
---
Honestly I'm with you. I cba looking for if I pip or depip. It's already in the past. Just rage post on Reddit when you depip and move on.
---
Hard disagree on Legion being weaker Spirit. They're nothing like each other.
---
Common sense might let someone assume that this happened before EGC was in the game
---
&gt; Legion is basically a weaker spirit
---
&gt; Spirit is hillbilly and wraith
---
Stretching like Mr. Fantastic
---
I personally disagree I don't think it'll be a bad killer but I don't think he's going to be good but you know we will have to see
---
I expected people to not agree. Am i the only one seeing connections?
---
He can jump and punch a locker open
---
Never had this problem. Never had friends.
---
You should have let him go, it wouldn‚Äôt have been fair to the last survivor who lost to bad sportsmanship
---
It ruins my mood and gives toxic shitheads the satisfaction of being cocky. 
---
Feed their egos all you want dude, that's on you.
---
my bing bong boi needs a buff
---
Spirit runs invisible but cant harm, legion runs visible and can harm. I think they used her as a template, which is what i have a problem with
---
As someone who doesn‚Äôt play this game but sees the posts that come up on r/all from time to time.. ever post confuses me more as to what this game even is.
---
yeah but i was expecting something insane since half the stuff in dbd gives you bp
---
Bust down clowniana
---
&gt; Am i the only one seeing connections?
---
I dunno but it's eye roll worthy
---
It's like saying an elephant is pretty much just large Fennec fox because they both have big ears
---
I don't send hate mail but many times I'm stuck waiting 10+ minute que times only for my match to end up against an unfun face camping (not even defense/patrol "camping") bastard. Hell yeah I'm gonna be salty.
---
You're legit the only one being a dick in this screenshot though?
---
It was Legion. He came charging at me, so I booked!!!
---
&gt; Spirit runs invisible but cant harm, legion runs visible and can harm
---
You should be embarrassed if this is your logic lmfao wow
---
New original content in so short time is hard to do. This game has a lot of restrictions while making killers it seems, skelleton model are the same on most killers (i bet it will be for demogorgen aswell) and that makes difficult for them to make new mechanics, i think thats understandable because we get a lot of QOL changes and new content every 1 or 2 months
---
&gt; kicking all the generators in a certain periphery when you down a survivor (one perk)
---
 Overcharge and Surveilance meta? 
---
&gt; blocking all the windows and vaults when one generator is completed for 30 secs (another perk)
---
Bamboozle the second coming? I‚Äôm All Ears UnSynergy. 
---
&gt;when he saves a survivor from the hook the survivor leaves no scratches and makes no sound for a certain amount of time 
---
Borrowed Will? Very interesting.
---
Good thing it wasn‚Äôt one of the more annoying killers, the sprit would‚Äôve scared me
---
Noine Noine!!!
---
This is a really cool idea man, I like the perks
---
This is pretty unlikely considering there is already a clown killer but with that forehead, I wouldn't complain if he got added.
---
I totally didn't just cry a little inside
---
This was about a month ago I'm not too sure. But never underestimate the crouch walk strat
---
You just keep going eventually whatever you‚Äôre looking for will show up
---
&gt;Like what happens if you don‚Äôt get the perk you want on your survivor/killer by level 50? It‚Äôs just confusing if anyone could offer me help
---
Bloodwebs are endless. You will continue to get them past level 50, your character just won't level up anymore on that number (50).
---
Hatch is the only way around the bug
---
Even from your limited description they're complete opposites in both traits you used, other than they both run, which still isn't quite true.
---
A new killer every 3 months, i think its not that hard making a new original killer. They are a big studio and they did plague in just 3 months so that works. Same to pig.
---
Why theres so many of these toys? Tell me, there one of these that its ghostface as well?
---
They literally used spirit as a template bruh
---
Dimension hopping of some kind
---
Most stuff only lets you get BP faster while in game.  Only WGLF and BBQ give you extra BP.  
---
Distressing, for example, lets you get deviousness BP 26% faster, but doesnt raise the cap.
---
Are you actually braindead? Or trolling?
---
Thanks! Glad you like the perks too. It was actually kinda hard for me to come up with three good ones for her.
---
Well what does spirit do then? She runs over the ground, invisible.
---
I really like the concept of a survivor being obsessed with another
---
like, she‚Äôs thick but her ass is flat.
---
So you want more killers that are based on old ones?
---
i know that now, i was just expecting more before
---
Hey I made that post
---
Okay, braindead it is
---
Quick question:
---
Why Steve and not Johnathan? I mean, Nancy and Jonny did more together against the Demogorgan than Steve did with Nancy.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen Micheal ones as well, no idea why they have he manned everyone.
---
It's more like my post tbh
---
Very hyped for Steve 
---
Finishing up season 3 and am now getting hyped for Nancy too. Really liked her this season
---
It has never done anything
---
Dude, with add-ons flashlights can last quite a while, and if you have a team of 4 survivors with flashlights (not uncommon) that coordinate, they can constantly pull you off of chases with quick flashes from a survivor in a different direction.
---
And because your camera is pulled you either have to give up on your chase and try to catch the one that flashed you, leaving the process to be repeated with the guy you were originally chasing being the next one to flash you when you start catching up in the new chase, or you have to try to re-orient yourself to try continuing the original chase, but the flashing survivor can just keep following you and flashing you, causing you to either have lost the trail for the original chase, or forcing you to chase them.
---
All of this happening while the other two survivors do generators and swapping out with the two baiters when their flashlights run low.
---
By the time you finally catch one, maybe two survivors, 3-4 gens are probably already done and the survivors can use the flashlights to prevent you from being able to stop an un-hook, because you won't be able to look at the look and catch the survivor un-hooking while another survivor is shining a light on you.
---
It's a terribly thought out mechanic to let flashlights force a killer to look at the user.
---
Nope, it's literally worthless.
---
My favorite idea for a rework is that it let's you re-open the hatch after the killer closes it but requires maybe 20/15/10 seconds to do so and a skill check
---
Aaaaaaaaye!
---
Those poor sad PC-less people. F in the chat
---
I don‚Äôt see why not stranger things can get a chapter so why not terminator
---
Who let this child play dbd?
---
Not at sll,? Just once again, explaining the reasons
---
You are braindead if you dont see that they literally made ghostface only out of pigs and myers abilities...
---
geometry dash is so fucking good
---
The Devs said "we won't ban you.  Ask EAC" EAC said "We won't ban you. Ask the Devs." It's not bannable at all.
---
Griefing is separate body blocking is an intentional mechanic. I'm not saying situations like this are OK but it's a dev problem, not a player problem. It isn't something you can be banned for.
---
I played as Freddy and was told I was cheating cause I could find them. I think people forget we have ears and eyes to see scratch marks..
---
Just make yourself the bait for the killer and then keep opening the locker Steve‚Äôs in while the killer is looking
---
Happy killing x
---
Sorry but totems are an objective. Noed is the punishment for not cleansing.
---
he‚Äôs in deathgarden doesn‚Äôt really work with dbd theme I feel
---
Oh fuck so you're actually megabraindead because I never once said anything about your Ghostface comparison. I have literally only criticized your idiocy regarding spirt and legion
---
That's what I was thinking! And he's a human character who fits into the whole "hunting normal people" thing. He'd probably have a cool obsession perk with Sarah Connor as the survivor.
---
Karma is a bitch...
---
some of you on here be lookin like clowns thinking that this guy was serious about this tier list... now that is a YIKES!!
---
Noob here. What‚Äôs bubba and BBQ
---
I‚Äôve had that happen to me as well and I‚Äôm not sure why, but it was a few weeks ago when it happened
---
On another topic, am i the only one who wants to see the grudge come to dbd?
---
For some reason adding survivors or killers that have modern day/future technology just doesn't seem like a good fit for DBD to me
---
I play nearly all killers (wraith, doctor, lf are out of my list) and when using nurse i am constantly harassed
---
however, if you want to go down that road, despite Ghost drawing from both Pig and Myers, the playstyles of all 3 are quite different
---
Yet I already know all this, hence why it seems like you're countering something you think I'm wrong about
---
My point is that they recycle old killers and make new ones based on their abilites but with changed details. And you come here calling me braindead because i think that spirit is kinda like legion.
---
&gt;Dude, with add-ons flashlights can last quite a while
---
Ya want to give us exactly how long? Its so short it doesn't even matter with add one.
---
Actually saying the number would make your argument look weaker I get it.
---
Killer mains always want to call everything OP but this takes the cake. Literally a passing idea in a Reddit thread
---
I read this in shreks voice
---
Nope? Lol
---
That may have been the problem. It is fixed now, so thanks anyway!
---
so fucking tired of it, it was never funny and its so old and overused now
---
I see what you mean, that's why I don't think Alien/Ripley would be good. But Terminator is a time traveler so it makes sense that he looks out of place. Alien is SET in the future so there's a difference.
---
&gt; And you come here calling me braindead because i think that spirit is kinda like legion.
---
Because you are if you think this. Your example to the other person to make your point literally disproved you. You are braindead.
---
i just started to get into the game so i just got the perk
---
Nurse is the top Killer, so anyone decent with her is going to get shat on by entitled Survivors.
---
I think they could pull it off if he had the Arnold look instead of the full robo skeleton.
---
Bubba AKA Leatherface AKA The Cannibal is a killer and BBQ is short for Barbeque and Chilli (which everyone uses since no one knows how the fuck you write Barbeque, barbieque, barbaque IDK), which is one of his perks.
---
(The one that lets you see survivors outside of a certain radius when you hook someone.)
---
I thought the specifics were that the bloodweb would have 4 perks up and you can grab two before the entity does his thing.
---
If I'm not mistaken the mind flayer has tendrils and rules the realm that the demogorgon is from. To me this is similar enough that maybe they can work the entity as a being similar to the mind flayer but of another realm
---
It wasn't leaked at all what are you talking about. DC, Sony have personally posted the trailer hours ago.
---
People might've understood if you actually explain your point of view in a respectful way. Instead you decide to be dismissive and say''wah wah'' and label the comment as ''survivor bitching''. 
---
No one is saying the perk is broken. It's really unfun perk, has no counterplay unless you're swf, screws solo survivors even more and overall takes away mindgames.
---
Pretty sure she just hunted humans for sport.
---
"Bodyblocking is bannable when it is used to hold the game hostage or grief, such as blocking a survivor in a corner and sitting there for a long period of time just so they can't play. Or sandbagging, where you intentionally jump in from of someone and block their path so the killer hits them."
---
Not what devs say ü§î
---
How does devoted commander work in the killer's eyes? Do they see two obsessions?
---
That would be funny af tho
---
That's happened more than once for me, but I also play at odd times so it's probably more that not many killers are on.
---
Thanks to everyone who helped! It is fixed now, with no issues as far as I know.
---
 I'm more just irritated it's the dumbass demogorgon and not another monster that's actually unique.
---
a 3k hour survivor was being toxic against me (a 130hr survivor man who barely has any experience with killer) cuz he was rank 8 and was being a cunt with his friends the entire game. I was with the huntress on The Game so i couldnt really get anyone. Hate the toxicity.
---
Just reading the comments you are posting, yikes. You are pathetic.
---
I know, i've been fucked over a lot with that strat, but i don't think it was me ib the clip then, cuz i started a week ago, and yes i'm a spirit main (at rank 18, yes)
---
Damn i thought people appreciated my cosplay.... must grow that neckbeard
---
The survivor most likely let the hit connect, just like the other survivor already in the ground. Looks like the killer was trying that glitch and the survivors played along with him. And those moments are one of the reasons why I love this game :)
---
I‚Äôm more hyped for the new players and the new perks I can try out.  I‚Äôm anxious about the map
---
He's not just stopping them there so they can't play though.
---
I don't own the perk, but as far as I know, it does. Some players complained that this perk was buggy at the beginning, so maybe that's why you didn't see it work.
---
I though they said "humanoid" and demogorgons are humanoid enough to me. Arms, Legs, head, torso, ect.
---
Dear Behavior, please let the tulip monster rip me open and devour me. 
---
Sincerely, Everyone.
---
Yes kinda, demogorgons live in a dark environment and it is believed they use their sense of smell to detect blood and hunt prey. They are also very sensitive to fire which will kill younger ones. Demogorgons are able to heal from  most burns and major injuries once they‚Äôre adults tho.
---
Sounds like it got.......left behind.
---
Leaked months ago, same as Ash being in mk11. Just because the trailer is out doesn‚Äôt mean that people havent leaked it
---
I think that would be good, but keep the generator repair thing alongside it too. Repairing gens already as Last survivor gives away your location when you complete it, so it's very risky and it's late game only perk so I don't see why it can't be 2 perks in one.
---
#WALUIGI NOISES
---
Honestly I'm bringing Moris for every game I find a 4 man Steve team
---
So you dont see any connections between killers?
---
YOU KNOW HONESTLY THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING PRETTY WELL FOR DBD BUT I'M SO USED TO ANGRILY POSTING HERE THAT I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO.
---
FUCK INSTAMEDS. I'M SO SICK OF PEOPLE HAVING "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARDS, WHEN ARE THEY GETTING REWORKED/NERFED ALREADY BHVR COME ON
---
I've read [articles](https://mspoweruser.com/mortal-kombat-11-dlc-leaked-includes-terminator-the-joker-and-spawn/) that state it was leaked earlier which is why the trailers were put out.
---
Take it back
---
Okay like I said if I wanted to argue with reject dumbfuck #1298 I would've asked.
---
I'm not even a killer main lol. I main david.
---
And with the right Add-ons and a purple flashlight you can have 24 sec, maybe longer idk, of usage on a flashlight.
---
Multiply that by 4 and we have 76 seconds of time survivors can just completely take away camera control from the Killer, using this smartly in quick burst can essentially make attempting to chase one survivor impossible for a majority of the match.
---
It's not
---
It is! First you need to think a new idea of a killer, think about it backstory and how to reflect it ingame, what will it do ingame, how will it work with certain perks, is it funny to play as/against?, does it break actual code of the game? What addons will it have? What mori animation will it have? Do his animations work as intended? Art, ect.
---
I'm an English speaker, but my friends and I have the following nicknames for killers:
---
Trapper: Ugar. You always have to say though, "It's Ugar."
---
Wraith: Bing bong boi
---
Michael: Mikey
---
Doctor: The Shocktor
---
Hag: Hagatha
---
Huntress: Mom, Bunny - lady
---
Leatherface: Whever you see him you have to say, "BUBBA?" in the dumbest voice you can.
---
Billy: Whenever we run from him we always go, "Bye beeeeleeee." (Think like, when Andy says 'Bye Woody' in Toy Story 2 lmao)
---
Freddy: Nightmare Feddy, JaCrispy, Fredward, Fredboi, Slashy slashy
---
Also we sometimes will call the killers by their first names, not sure why. Lol.
---
Alright buddy
---
What‚Äôs it like being so fragile that something so minor from someone can ruin your entire mood?
---
What a way to live.
---
Haha I haven‚Äôt played wraith in a while mostly Huntress and Billy
---
It's not fine and I'm Spirit main .__.
---
You can choose to prestige but it‚Äôll clear everything and you‚Äôll lose all perks and items/add ons. Or you can just keep going for as long as you want. 
---
I could have p3d Jane 20 times over by now but decided to keep her normal without any prestige-ing and just continuously leveling her.
---
you forgot the extra 15% from gateaus
---
Certain people just want to complain and blame others for anything they can when they lose. Just ignore them and move on /shrug.
---
I'm reallly looking forward to getting my ass ate by the demigorgan
---
...How the goddamn fuck does that make Spirit like Legion?
---
I DON'T MIND SPIRIT BUT PLAYING AGAINST HER 5 TIMES IN A ROW MAKES ME SCREAM
---
Sacrificing all 4 survivors
---
i said what i said
---
Jesus defensive much?  He was explaining his ideas on the topic. Wth is wrong with you
---
It does if the killer doesn‚Äôt close the hatch but when has that ever happened? Lol
---
The Nancy is a slut spray paint was his friend's, not him. Steve def cleaned it up after, but I'm trying to remember how he reacted to his friends spray painting slut. If he didn't care/supported his friends I can agree more with Steve being a douche.
---
Console issue not the game
---
It's basically a MoM but with different circumstances for activation
---
Thanks you saved my life
---
r e l a t e a b l e
---
this perk is literally op
---
Only counterplay I can think of is a full swf group 99'ing gens and pop them at safe moments
---
"Ah people being shitty ruins your mood? Lol you're so fragile and sensitive and that's totally not a normal human reaction to get upset at someone being an asshole." Quit justifying toxicity you twat.
---
Bubba is Leatherface, the  killer from Texas Chainsaw Massacre and BBQ&amp;chili is one of his own perks. It's one of the best perks in the game. You can see auras of all survivors outside of a 40 metre radius when you hook someone. Auras show for 4 seconds and the perk gives you a massive bloodpoint bonus, which is the biggest benefit on my opinion
---
But if they for some reason make some updates and you get auto banned for changing files like that, they will never help you. Thats what they said.
---
Damn! Lucky bloodweb!!!!!
---
I wanted to start maining Ghostface, and luckily got Hex: Ruin in my very first bloodweb.
---
This is the third time it‚Äôs been on the shrine but k
---
76 seconds wow that's.... a nuisance in a game that lasts about 15 minutes. And that's assuming every single survivor is bringing in the exact same best flash light with the 2 battery add-ons.... On top of that being 76 seconds of survivors not working on gens and fucking with you rather than hiding.
---
You bitch like a killer main.
---
get 4ks
---
This is so good.  Holy shit I'm dyin' LOL
---
I don't play enough to spend bloodpoints on killers I don't use. If I did I would level them up, but I only have on one prestige on the doctor and no other killer at 50.
---
You're the killer dude and not just nobody killer, but Freddy fucking Krueger. You're there to kill survivors, not to play by their shitty rules.
---
Its not that serious my guy.  Gettin a lil emotional there are we?
---
Actually looking forward to have him join the Hookers.
---
Toxic Survivor mains stole my memes and my basement chest
---
Nah. I‚Äôm good
---
It's going to be so good. We will learn everything about it tomorrow on the live stream!
---
they could easily have 2k by the end of the week.
---
*pulls out flashlight*
---
Wow your a dick
---
you should watch the original nightmare on elm street. original nancy is a much better character than remake nancy. 
---
once you've seen the original movie the remake will seem like a huge disappointment in comparison
---
For me it‚Äôs different. Survivor queues can take up to 5 mins (Although I still get games...) and killer creates the lobby instantly
---
I am a noob to dead by daylight what exactly is a black lock
---
I love carson
---
I also got Bamboozle on lvl.3 so i'm pretty happy. Just demolished a 4 player SWF without a single gen pop and they were all rank 8 to my rank 20, haven't played in a while, the messages were pretty salty but i deserved it.
---
Ash is a horror icon so I think he gets a pass even if they were to pull from Army of Darkness which is pure comedy. AvED is 100% in the 80‚Äôs gory horror comedy style. I do think Stranger Things fits well enough but it is interesting since it‚Äôs more aimed towards teens. Same kind of thing with Joker in MK but similarly they fit well enough.
---
Why
---
So 99% it and only complete once killer picks someone up. It's easy to avoid, especially for swf or high ranks. I can only see it being annoying for new or low rank solo players.
---
Tapp and the pig are both dead too
---
Trapper was inspired by Jason, its so unlikely that would happen.
---
Neither is ghost face. Hes the literal. costume
---
I CAN'T STAND PLAYING SURVIOR ON PS4 BECAUSE 8/10 GAMES HAS A FACE CAMPER OR A TUNNELER AND BY THE TIME I GET OUT OF BEGINNER RANKS ITS THE 13TH AND I'M BACK TO CAMP CITY. ITS SO BAD THAT AFTER MY LONG BREAK I GOT MESSAGES THANKING ME FOR NOT CAMPING AS A KILLER. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE LONGER SEASONS.
---
If that's the case then the dlc should stay $7 despite 2 new survivors.
---
It only blocks vaults so they can still loop pallets I think it will be fine just will have a short learning period for survivors
---
Bubba is the best killer
---
Pop is activated when you hook a survivor, not when they are downed, i dont think that is a good combo
---
&gt;you forgot the extra 15% from gateaus
---
I said 100% BP offerings, I didn't forget about the 15%, I ignored them. Every other comment gave the wrong total amount, not adding the base points to the final result, which would be 256k during double BP or 224k in normal days.
---
Okay maybe i can explain it to you if i talk it simple.
---
Spirit charges her ability, goes into spirit realm and begins to run fast and appears at another position, she cant attack while running in her realm.
---
Legion runs, but his ability is a charge. He can run left, right, forward etc... like spirit. Unlike spirit he can attack people while running and cause them to bleed. 
---
Now imagine playing spirit but you dont enter the realm and begin to be fast, now imagine the camera moving down and up with that wind. What does it remind you of? 
---
They do use older killers as reference for newer killers, they said that on stream. And i want them to actually make new stuff. A killer that has the ability to climb? They actually wanted to do it but they had problems with the clipping, but i think with the budget they have now they can do it.
---
Good question
---
I get what you're saying, but Michael Myers, the Huntress, the Hillbilly, and even the Nurse to an extent are all very "kill, kill, kill" oriented. If the Entity can force them to follow his rules, I don't see why the Demogorgon couldn't do the same thing.
---
Honestly it makes less sense to me for the Plague or Wraith to follow him. The Wraith was generally an innocent man before killing his boss, and the Plague was trying to *save* people. She has no lust for killing at all.
---
It's true. I've had it on mobile for at least a month. Playing it is sketchy as hell, but it's there! Had to download stupid TapTap first.
---
Steve is best mom.
---
I can't see the whole match so I don't know. Either way. You are complaining about a homicidal maniac choosing to kill you over someone else. If he tunnels you? What can you do? His goal is to kill people, even if it's toxic, he isn't doing anything game breaking or illegal. You won't win every game. L's will be taken. Just how dbd works.
---
I have friend who I play dbd with sometimes (he and I got the game a little before Legion was added) he learnt that sprinting leaves scratch marks yesterday.
---
Spirit isnt like legion at all, but they have used some chunks of her ability and put it into legion.
---
The question was maximum BP, just figured Id let you know, calm down mate.
---
great idea! I have a question tho. For narrow escape, wouldn't you just hear the hatch?
---
So your fucking reasoning is that they both move more quickly when they use their power? 
---
It actually makes me mad how fucking stupid you are
---
Wait Mathieu was on the gamescom. That was my chance to meet daddy Cote =(
---
IN MY OPINION KILLERS SHOULD GET PENALTIES FOR CAMPING NEXT TO HOOKED SURVIVORS. IF I GET TO STRUGGLING PHASE AND NO ONE IS AROUND TO SAVE ME BUT I STILL HEAR THE HEARTBEAT, YOU‚ÄôRE A CAMPER AND I HATE YOU.
---
I think he was very blah about it. You could tell he was conflicted, not directly responsible but definitely didn't stop them. Not that that makes him at fault.
---
When Nancy came to investigate it he called her a slut to her face basically
---
The earlier stages of the Demogorgon seem to dislike light, but the final stage doesn't seem to mind it too much. Or at least from what we've seen that is.
---
Your fucking exact words were "Legion is basically a weaker spirit"
---
God I fucking hate you
---
CHILL damn.
---
Having monsters in the game doesn't break the lore.
---
Its really hard talking to you because you dont understand anything or get everything wrong. A little tip btw... you got my last comment wrong too.
---
My friend refuses to believe that medium vaults are a thing and thinks Bubba is OP
---
Im a rank 1 pig main. A lot of people awnsered already, so I'm gonna say one thing. Use your dash to mindgame a downed pallet or vault. Fake one way, then go the other
---
The devs have clearly stated if anyone body blocks for more than like a minute of gameplay it‚Äôs a ban.
---
That is holding the game hostage, hopefully you aren‚Äôt one of the dick heads that does this.
---
LOL can't you think further than that? Proccing that perk is completely up to the survivors, killer literally can not affect it at all. There is no counterplay for the killer if survivors just pop gens only at the right time. Just wait for completing the gen until the killer picks someone up. Done. At least 1 of 5 uses wasted. Just 99% gens until he picks someone then pop multiple at the same time.
---
**OH THAT'S A BASEBALL**
---
Damn, so my point is like Extra, Extra Invalid
---
I have gotten literally nothing wrong. You are just hopelessly dumb
---
Ding Dong boi doesn't have the same ****ahem**** *ring* to it as Bing Bong boi. Sorry I'll see myself out.
---
....do bones..?
---
Oh, for sure!!! I got lucky that it was a Legion for sure!!!!!
---
What killer?
---
Youre just behaving toxic now. Its impossible talking to you.
---
Come on dude. You aren't an "apex predator" because you clicked a different button on the title screen than the survivors.
---
Killers are op guys please you've gotta believe me
---
‚ÄúSticks and stones may break my bones, but names can never hurt me.‚Äù
---
We teach children this, yet you‚Äôre presumably an adult, and yet you‚Äôre so easily offended and triggered to the point where you resort to name calling, and I‚Äôm the toxic one?
---
I think you need to re-evaluate yourself. I feel quite sorry for you truthfully.
---
Getting me mallet
---
You are allowed to \*\*Use\*\* pop when you hook, but it activates when you kick a gen
---
Daaaaaaaaamn!!!!!! I love it!!!! Great job!!!! Keep on slaughtering those survivor turds!!!!!!!
---
There isn't a single person who agrees with your brain vomit, but sure, I'm the problem. Fucking idiot
---
One of the killers is literally called "The Cannibal"
---
[Right here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/data-sheets-community-requests).
---
Console's lowest is 40% - in both cases it's Nurse, for obvious reasons. Since we can ignore her as an outlier, the lowest *normal* performer is still ~50%, which again tallies with the overall goal of 2 kills, 2 escapes.
---
Ur right, she has soo many meat and nice holes
---
It wastes a perk spot.
---
You know, why is his name Demogorgon and not Stranger Thing?
---
It's all about the Stranger BBQ and Chili Things
---
Once in every 10 games you get that god-tier spot and your totem never gets broken
---
since your worthless ass apparently forgot, here is your reasoning
---
&gt; Spirit charges her ability, goes into spirit realm and begins to run fast and appears at another position, she cant attack while running in her realm.
---
&gt; Legion runs, but his ability is a charge. He can run left, right, forward etc... like spirit. Unlike spirit he can attack people while running and cause them to bleed.
---
&gt; Now imagine playing spirit but you dont enter the realm and begin to be fast, now imagine the camera moving down and up with that wind. What does it remind you of? 
---
You fucking literally describe their powers as being totally different except they both run fast. Fucking moron pos
---
Freddy vs Jason? Its not an f13 license, and if they make a fredyd vs jason chapter, i think they could add the robert englund skin
---
I missed that one
---
&gt;Omg, you didn't even bother reading what I said in my previous comment.
---
Yea I don't care to read essays from random on reddit on some real cut and dry ideas
---
Nice, the perk that comes with the anti-perk.
---
Until you realize that it's actually the older brother pretending that he is his younger brother trying to play in his account so he can trick the killer and make them have mercy on him!
---
So why bother suggesting some horrid mechanic if you don't even want to discuss it beyond unsulting whoever points out the flaws?
---
I doubt it - we'll just get 800,000 salty rage posts from Claudettes who identify as bushkin.
---
Nancy lost her virginity to her mom.
---
I bought it but i still cant find it on the bloodweb üò°üò°
---
DISAGREED
---
I'm surprised Jonathan isn't a survivor.
---
Me, an intellectual killer: \*Slugs Claudette while nodding vigorously\*
---
oh boy can't wait for the influx of wallhack killers with the ability to pinpoint my exact fuckin hiding spot unless I break my flow of gameplay to hope I'm hiding my aura of seek out a locker literally the second anyone gets downed who say that they totally 100% only use for the bloodpoints no really
---
I meant that the lore doesnt mean much to me but I can see where my emojis went wrong
---
From killer pov it's fine. But as a solo survivor this perk is a gamekiller.
---
They used spirits run for legion. Dont see it? Then go your ways because your "anger" at an online person fogged your mind. 
---
Do you really think they made legions run completely out of scrap if there was a killer that literally runs too? 
---
Jesus help you and your anger.
---
I was worried about that happening to me but I just levelled up my clown a couple of times and badabing badaboom. How many levels have you gone up?
---
I rarely have problems at lower ranks unless it's a SWF group. While they don't always do it, they will leave me on the hook to die more times then not. 
---
On PS4, most solo players are proving to be quite shit. I'm at rank 14 now and it's still the same. I can't count how many times, they've hid on me on my first hook when I've pulled them off twice and the killer is no where near me. 
---
This is one of many reasons I decided to move it to PC. Also PC killers at lower ranks are just better then console killers. It's so much more fun against them and I've played against some really brutal and well round players. 
---
I was also shocked to see how badly the game runs on the Pro. There was a time when the Xbox One X was bad, but now it's more in line with PC and the framerate is visibly higher on Xbox. I had to retime skill checks it was so bad and the framerate drops are noticeble and non existent on the X.
---
So most do that here
---
The way you speak can get you banned from this subreddit fast by the way.
---
Dying Light doesn't affect the exit gate IIRC.
---
x2 Party Streamers - Worth already, entity must like you
---
&gt; So why bother suggesting some horrid mechanic 
---
You give me shit for not reading your essay but you don't want to actually read the first comment I made with my entire point in it? Lmao get your head out of your ass
---
"Its not that great of an idea but surely this isn't the problem." Get your dumb ass strawmans out of here.
---
r/wooosh
---
wait so you're saying that legion is a weaker spirit because you perceive their animation as being similar? good fucking god that's even fucking dumber
---
how do you function
---
It already does that. You can literally expose him from behind a wall
---
That comment does not say criticism is off the table, it just tells everyone you're not even confident in your own comment.
---
Which game is this? I'm going to assume it's one of the tycoon ones. Restaurant Tycoon?
---
Sause on the art?
---
Yep
---
get this, OP thinks this because they think legion and spirit have a similar running animation
---
it's more dumb than anyone thought
---
I was never a fan of The Telltale Games much because no matter what you did you would get the same results. The artificial illusion of choice only carries you so far when the writers aren't good.
---
Either way besides his terrible awfully written death... I think Kenny was the best character by far.
---
To everyone who comments on this post, most if not all survivors are canonically dead in some way.
---
I'm kinda surprised how many people haven't seen it. It's so good and it's been like 3 years since season 1
---
Lmao my entire point was that it was a bad idea but that his criticism of it was not valid you moron.
---
I'm not the one that came up with the idea you dumb ass
---
 Not digging what I see from the killer at all. Like at all. Absolutely too much. Inb4: whiney Survivor main.

Break up the Meta perks!!

FUCK PEOPLE WHO WASTE THE GOD DAMN PALLETS! I WILL TUNNEL ALL PEOPLE WHO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY FUCK THEIR TEAM OVER. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN IF A DEPIP FROM THAT AS LONG AS THEY DEPIP

See?! This person knows what‚Äôs up!

Good ideas narrow escape does seem a little op though
---
So would he just have 0 terror radius until he's stunned??
---
i didnt make a petition, someone else did my dude. 
---
petitions dont mean anything, its not like BHVR made it themselves. 
---
I consider it a joke bc it made me chuckle. Its like saying Shirtless Myers cosmetic. we meme about it but no one believes its gonna happen petition or popular vote aside. sorry it didnt make you laugh, doesnt mean its not funny to someone else.
---
Also are you really gonna compare a smash hit horror show like Stranger Things to the Cat in the Hat? the Stranger Things memes and pleas were more of a request than saying "haha cat skin" tbh. 
---
I wasnt trying to start an argument when i commented that, just giving you an explanation on why. And to clear it up: people go into the comments to joke around on posts they find funny, and then one person doesnt joke and just says No, as if that wasnt obvious. Even the petition is a joke. no one upvoted you because the truth took away from the good time everyone was having looking at cat in the hat and saying "yeah, killer material" when we know hes not...
---
Your comment made my day better thank you.
---
What? They stalked sydney for years, using their knowledge of her and her friends to harass and make her life a living hell.
---
Stalking doesn‚Äôt just mean staring at people
---
Oh ok thx so much

Also last time I asked someone people downvoted me probably because "It'S rObLoX dUmBaSs ReAd ThE tItLe"

But what‚Äôs a broken key for
---
It's not a tantrum because you disagree it's a tantrum because you make up a bunch of boogie men about a half baked idea from a single reddit comment at someone who didn't even come up with nor agree with the idea.
---
You literally thought this was my idea and went crazy because I said his criticism wasn't valid.
---
You also don't have any data you've brought to the table, don't know what that's about.
---
Keep being scared of those 4 man teams that would waste their item slots on this dumb ass mechanic lol
---
dont kill steve you shit
---
Thank you! That‚Äôs sad but every game has his ups and downs
---
The exact quote is, "a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down".
---
Disney couldn't claim a *similar* quote. Besides which, copyright is designed to stop one stealing another's Intellectual Property. A key part of this whether general consumers would confuse what X is making for Y's IP.
---
No-one would think that this Nurse skin has anything to do with Mary Poppins.
---
The perks that have been 'Leaked' thus far sound amazing
---
If roadmap is accurate, they're coming before the next chapter which we know is coming next month. It will be here before you know it. I never have issues loading into a lobby on PC as a survivor, but consoles take forever.
---
Also why is this ochido guy cancer ?
---
I will repeat

#[Loads hatchet with malicious intent]

#[Yknow, to kill steve]

I expected the sound tbh
---
I BOUGHT HIM LAST THURSDAY. IM RAGING WITH YOU, THOUGH HE IS FUN TO FUCK AROUND WITH WHEN IM DRUNK NGL. HAHA
---
Also 4 death engravings and 2 coldwinds
---
1. For killers, I can‚Äôt answer. I suggest to watch some videos and pick who you like the most out of all of them. Some killers who require a lot of skill are Nurse (arguably the best killer in the game once you learn her), and Spirit. For survivors, they are just skins. Every survivor has 3 unique perks but once you level them up enough you can unlock ‚Äúteachable‚Äù versions of those perks, making them available to other survivors when you level them up. I suggest to open the menu ingame that shows all the characters bios and perks and choose from there. (Also whoever you like the most appearance-wise). A lot of people choose meg or claudette as the starting survivors, since Meg gives you perks to run away from the killer fast, and Claudette gives healing perks.
---
2. At least to me, most of the community is pretty nice. Of course you‚Äôll meet some assholes, and some really toxic people, but that‚Äôs how every game community works.
---
3. Tunneling is basically when a killer chases after only one survivor, ignoring all others. It sucks when you‚Äôre survivor, but sometimes it‚Äôs the only way to ensure a kill when you‚Äôre killer. Slugging is when you knock the survivor to dying state, and not hooking them.
---
4. Of course!
---
5. It‚Äôs pretty huge for DBD since Stranger Things has such a wide audience and is insanely popular. It‚Äôll definitely increase the games playerbase.
---
6. I definitely suggest Monto, he plays all of the killers equally and is pretty good at the game. He also plays survivor too. I also suggest n00b3 and Demi for comedy gameplay. Puppers is great too. Stay away from Ochido, he‚Äôs a shitty person.
---
7. Currently main Meg (future Nancy main), and I also play Legion, Ghostface, and Spirit.
---
8. I definitely suggest to play both, it‚Äôll help you learn if you see both perspectives.
---
9. Hardest killer is definitely Nurse, but she is also the best one. There isn‚Äôt a hardest survivor because they are just skins, but easiest to play stealthy would probably be Claudette since she blends into scenery so well.
---
10. I personally love the devs, but some other people don‚Äôt like them that much.
---
Ha
---
I get that reference
---
Exactly, a med kit with 32 charges and the adrenaline allows for 3 full heals throughout the game, and it also counters butcher and even nurses calling to some extent. Just gotta hope the killer doesn't have Franklin's though.
---
Such is life
---
Because hes toxic. Aside from having his followers witchhunt other streamers he dislikes, he generally bullies the killer and tbags and tries to humiliate them.
---
listen here you
---
Because Steve is a fan favorite
---
Hmm
---
And they say that the Demogorgon isn't human.
---
It's not enough, I haven't managed to reveal a GF doing this while staring at him the entire time, and I was in range (I started to get the sound cues but then failed, and I had revealed from further away earlier in the match).
---
It's bad enough when you have such a short window to reveal him while he's leaning before he exposes you, when he can almost always get a free hit in due to approaching from any angle while completely silent while you're on a generator.
---
But when you can't even reveal him when you DO happen to spot him before that small window is up? It sucks.
---
Yeah, they just go about it differently.
---
BT lets you get away from the killer by just tanking the potential hits, while this one makes you bank on the killer not noticing/looking at them and sneaking by, while at the same time giving them vision of the unhooker.
---
I SECOND THIS. MATCH THE KILLER TO THE HIGHEST RANKED SURVIVOR, THANKS. IM A RANK 17 KILLER AND IN MY LAST MATCH, I HAD A RANK 9 AND A RANK 7. HAVENT PLAYED SINCE SATURDAY.
---
Yeah i love the scratch mark one especially.
---
Just scared that the demogorgan may be like mint rag hag from what ive read
---
It needs a rework, but this reminds me of a perk idea I had. It's dumb but I like thinking of these things:
---
Perk name: Final Attempt
---
// If you are the final survivor you suddenly become the obsession and the killer can kill you. However, you can manually open the hatch. Opening the hatch takes 20 - 18 - 16 seconds. //
---
This means if the killer goomba stomps the hatch, you can open it. 
---
I personally feel like the gate spawn locations can sometimes be bullshit, and they make escaping as the final survivor literally impossible. I have been the killer and have been able to see both gates by moving my head left and right. You end up just waiting for a light to red so you can engage... This doesn't make the endgame tense when there's only 1 survivor left, it makes it kinda boring, and I often feel bad killing the final survivor when the exit gate locations screw them over.
---
I doubt the devs will change gate spawn locations, but some more end game related perks would definity help a final survivor. Especially if they have both pros and cons.
---
I don‚Äôt think they would add the bat cosmetic like they didn‚Äôt add the chainsaw for Ash
---
Lots of questions but I'll try to answer most of em
---
1. I would personally recommend Nea, she has really good evasion perks and as a newbie you don't want to get spotted by a killer or if you do you want to end the chase fast as you won't last long
---
2. Yes and no, Reddit definitely overexgerates the problem. In fact this subreddit is way more toxic than the game itself. If you play toxicly you be greeted by toxic players. That said sometimes you'll play nice and even then people will be toxic. Problem is people have a short fuse, they try to be nice, some asshole is mean to them so they decide to be mega toxic to everyone in response and the cycle continues. I try to be a nice player and rarely see toxicity.
---
3. Tunneling is having "tunnel vision" on one survivor. You only go after him even when there is someone else literally right in front of you. It's considered rude but is a valid tactic. Slugging is when you leave them on the ground in a dying state rather than hooking them. Both of these are valid tactics but can be considered BM depending on the context. If you aren't doing it specifically to be rude, it's fine
---
4. You are more than welcome here, welcome to the community! üòÄ
---
5. It's pretty big, but I mean DBD already has huge killers like Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, Bubba (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Amanda from SAW. Still, Strangers Things is huge right now so I imagine this will be really big for DBD
---
6. -
---
7. I play both sides, I like Pig for killer and Jake Park for survivor
---
8. Play both! not only is it more fun, but it's makes you significantly better at the other side. IMO people who only play one side are missing out and often the toxic ones 
---
9. Hardest Killer is The Nurse, but she's also the best. There is no  hardest survivor as survivors are pretty much just skins
---
10. They've been mantaining the game for years and still getting high profile licenses so yeah they're cool! Keep in mind though it's a SMALL dev team so changes may take awhile.
---
Had that happen to me. The doctor that did it to me is a pos. My other teammates try to get the killer to chase them but alas :‚Äô)
---
this is 100% true, the thing that makes me mad is that 90% of the time you can stare directly at him for 10 seconds and it doesn't cancel his power
---
I'd trade Ruin for Unnerving Presence. If you are doing a 3 gen build you shouldn't care about prolonging early game.
---
Well, turns out I was wrong. I suppose an apologies is in order.
---
Well, you are the entity, so I think you are allowed to do as you please
---
haha, nea killer meme haha
---
SHIRTLESS GAY SAILOR STEVE IS OUR DREAM LET US HAVE IT
---
Is it bad that I missed the top part, and laughed? Anyways, here's an upvote
---
IMAGINE COMPLAINING ABOUT SURVIVORS COMPLAINING IN A RAGE THREAD. JUST WOW.
---
What was his comment? He deleted it :/
---
Look, I know some people don‚Äôt like stranger things
---
But do you really need to jack off to killing steve
---
I mean, yes and no
---
Thank you !! This is so helpful boi everyone is so nice! This is the second time someone said that Ochido is a bad person ? But he has 580+ K? Why is he bad also Nancy will be my Main too
---
Appreciate the post my man, but just like  the teabagging I don‚Äôt mind the downvotes either. Comes with the territory.
---
hey there! Ive been playing for a good while and thought i could help you start out
---
1. Picking a survivor to start with id recommend either feng min or claudette. their perks work for a starter playstyle. As for a killer ill assume you'll only have the starter 3 killers, so id recommend learning trapper to get a grasp on power usage and chases
---
2. This community, just like any other, has its toxicity but as a whole its a great community with some amazing people and personalities. 
---
3. These are some broad definitions for your questions, but "tunneling"- chasing a survivor unrelentingly, often throwing a game just for one person. "slugging"- leaving a survivor on the floor instead of hooking them, often doing it to multiple survivors.
---
4. You are totally welcome here! Welcome to the fog, here is your complimentary flashlight and medkit, please watch your step and please, dont feed the demogorgons!
---
5. The collab opens important doors for the game such as new types of killers (not just standard humans) and providing a boost in playerbase with great people like you!
---
6. As for funny, id always recommend Monto, No0b3, and FarmerJohn. Informative youtubers id recommend OhTofu, PainReliever, and Ardethas coaching series.
---
7. I main Freddy/Ghostface killer side, and Ash survivor side!
---
8. Its always acceptable to play killer and survivor, whatever sounds fun to you is what you should play, and thats part of the beauty of the game. I would recommend picking a side to learn first to get the hang of, but only for your first few hours.
---
9. Survivors are mostly skins, the perks are the only differences and you can get them on any survivor. Killers would mostly be Nurse/spirit as most difficult. 
---
10. The creators and developers are amazing people, and love the community! Matthieu, NotQueen, and the rest of the crew have a passion, and you can see it in their game. 
---
as a side note, dont you ever worry about sounding or playing like a noob, we all started somewhere, and learning is crucial. Good luck, and have fun in the fog!
---
Don‚Äôt forget Hag‚Äôs Scarred Hand add-on that gives 300% more in Deviousness!
---
Now all I need is distortion and pop goes the weasel and I'll be at max power
---
I can't remember if Lee is shown as a zombie. He could be abducted by the Entity before he turned.
---
Yikes but you watch him?
---
i bet there is a michael myers one
---
Plus it would teach survivors that just escaping isn't winning. There are those assholes that do literally nothing the whole match and escape with 7,000 points while I die with 24,000 because I went down on hooking them after the gates were opened and they refused to do anything.
---
Or those idiots who wait on the hatch and do nothing for their team.
---
You can die and still win and escape and still lose.
---
Video games are actually not all that cheap nowadays compared to video games in the past.
---
I remember buying video games for a flat price of $40 with no DLC, no microtransaction, no season passes, no battle passes, no premium currency, no limited time content, no subscriptions etc. that slowly but surely drag the price up from $60 or $80 to $500+
---
Video games should be compared to other passtimes, which can just easily as easily stack up in price when you consider how invested you are in that activity, how much you pay for it, how often you engage in it, equipment, etc.
---
You could also buy a baseball and bat for $12 and have hundreds of hours of fun with that, or you can factor in the inevitable costs of replacing them, getting gear, etc. Just as with video games, you factor in the cost of the system, other games, equipment and all of the other extraneous costs nowadays.
---
I stay at the door to give them free hits so they get points, not all survivors are assholes
---
Thats true
---
Tunneling isnt going after someone who just got unhooked, its ignoring all but one player at a time even if there are easier options. If the player gets unhooked and the killer is close enough to give chase, that's fine and more often another survivor "farming" whomever was hooked so they can just get the points for unhooking them. If the killer has the chance to hit like 2 other survivors but refuses to because it would slow them down and prevent them from hitting the one whi was unhooked, then it's probably tunneling. The key thing here is that tunneling can happen even if someone wasn't unhooked, if the killer is singling out one specific player for a large amount of time, or relatively large amount of time, its tunneling and ignoring the others if they are around then its tunneling. But if the survivors make a bad play, i.e. unhooking when the killer is nearby then the bad play is on them, and potentially bad sportsmanship depending on the situation.
---
I wonder if the gen kicking perk will actually trigger action of kicking the gen or if it just puts generators into regression state.
---
Right? It's basically another free basement.
---
Look up "dead by daylight funny moments ochido".  His compilations aren't just of him.  User submitted too and they arent just bully clips.  He has regular gameplay vids of him that I dont watch.
---
He has gotten banned many times by the devs because he constantly abuses bugs and is a toxic person. He sent his audience to hate on tru3ta1ent (another content creator, forgot to suggest him earlier but hes great!), and theres rumors that he has asked underage girls that watched his videos for nudes. I dont know how true those accusations are, but hes basically the embodiment of what a toxic person is in this community.
---
But so is Jonny. Fans love every character. Except Max's step brother.
---
Playing Demogorgon just gives you a black screen upon loading in
---
Also in that sense it shouldn't work on Nurse either cause her face is covered.
---
You'll regret not watching Breaking Bad at least once
---
you dont need distortion to know if the killer has deer stalker, bbq, nurses, etc.  Nurses is mostly pointless because good survivors dont heal themselves, unless they brought or found a medkit.  32 sec to self care.  That's about 40% of a gen or about 75% of a gen with 2 people.  With sloppy, 40 sec to self care.
---
domemermon
---
WE COULD JUST USE THE BASE HAIR INSTEAD OF THE HAT!
---
THEY DO WHEN IT COMES TO SCORING AT THE END OF THE MATCH.
---
FUN FACT: I PLAY SURVIVOR TOO, GENIUS
---
YOUR COMPLAINT IS STILL PATHETIC
---
You don't have to play him though, just buy him, grind with your character of choice and spend the bloodpoints on him. But I understand if you meant you just never wanted to level or use him either.
---
Thank you so much! You seem very nice! Sorry if this is stoopid but what is BM?
---
I guess but I don‚Äôt really have a problem with the killer chasing me for large amounts of time and ignoring others. Whereas being knocked down straight of a hook is super irritating.
---
How do I download this?
---
Uh.
---
You do understand that the Killer is *meant and designed* to return to the hook because they get a notification, right? It's literally a game mechanic.
---
It's only tunneling if they break off chasing some other survivor in order to return to the hook.
---
You're saying that the Killer returning to where they know two survivors are is tunneling? Do you expect them to just ignore it? Wait until the Killer finds and hits someone else, run We'll Make It to get the heal off, do something other than blame the Killer for finding the injured guy you unhooked at a bad time.
---
It's not the Killer's fault, it's the fault of the two survivors to some degree, particularly the one unhooking, but the hooked survivor should be able to reach a loop or hide if the Killer is outside of 32 meters.
---
And?
---
1. Probably claudette or meg for survivors 
---
Hillbilly or trapper for killer 
---
True but she has that ghost type of theme going on so I think it's justified in her case that or the fabric on the pillow case I very thin
---
Still killed me a little bit on the inside that we didn‚Äôt get Mind Flayed Billy from S3. I felt like it had a lot of potential and made much, much more sense lore-wise for DBD that we get him instead of the Demogorgon.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm still hyped, mostly for my fucking Scoops Ahoy shorts, but I feel like there was a lot of potential lost for an interesting killer. I just hope like hell I‚Äôm wrong and the Demogorgon ends up being fantastical.
---
Sorry for replying so late but did this actually get to cursed comments cause I have never seen it
---
I would normally love to explain the myriad of things that can cause everything you‚Äôre frustrated with, but thanks to the MAGIC of the internet, someone else has. u/int3r4ct has been gracious enough to make a fully detailed explanation on Ghostface that I can timestamp for you. 
---
https://youtu.be/DkDyYBg5oYw
---
4:16-11:11. I highly advise you give his video a watch.
---
I try to be kind and I rarely see toxicity. You get out of it what you put in. 
---
Problem is sometimes you'll be nice / "play by the code" and some butthurt guy will still respond negatively. Just ignore that and move on. Some people here have thin skin and because one guy was a dick to them they feel the need to be toxic to everyone else in response, and thus the cycle continues.
---
I always say GGWP and compliment the other side, oftentimes they return the gesture, give advice, or just generally be nice. 
---
Like I said, this sub is way more toxic than the game itself, it's because people who are mad come here to vent while most people don't bother going to Reddit to say they had a nice game
---
lol everyone forgets about jonathan lets be real
---
Fuck them too
---
Ate all 4, entity displeased.
---
I don't have the self care teachable so it's with a medkit, I actually bring pharmacy+botany knowledge a lot of times and with Distortion it's saved me from getting killed because they saw me.
---
OKAY, YOU'RE SWINGING TOO FAR TO THE OTHER SIDE LOL
---
Changing icons is not cheating so EAC will not ban. I'm pretty sure it doesn't scan the icon images and I'm also sure there's some things EAC can't check at all. It's been 2 or 3 years since people chance the custom icons and nobody has been banned. If EAC did change it and started banning for changed icons then we'd lose a big portion of players because this game isn't really popular. DBD only has like 15-20k players playing on PC most of the time.
---
I am not sure on the post itself. Everytime I post on there my post never rise up.
---
So many nice people here I can‚Äôt keep up! Thank you so much! Ugh this makes me so hyped for the game! Thank you for your comment!
---
But the corn is all around me.
---
Huh that sounds like a weird IP/copy right set up. Did FunWorld own the rights to the mask beforehand? I assumed since it was used in so many movies and then the show that the studio just bought out the rights to it or had it to begin with.
---
Not aire about steves perks but Nancys look like they were made for me, i already obsses with a gen most of the time and i like the walking fast thingy
---
Cant you try kill your friends with him and show the vaults?
---
Thank you! I will do that after I finished looking at every comment
---
I feel like this is bait to get people mad and god it almost worked on me
---
Not often, but it's surprising which killers get called OP occasionally.
---
Last week there was a forum post that Wraith's invisibility was too gamebreaking.
---
Yikes but he has so many fans? That‚Äôs like ew. Thank you I will stay away from him
---
Well the chapter name is kinda an after thought for most people I would assume. I just assumed the went with GhostFace for the chapter name so people didmt think there would be a survivor along with it.
---
I JUST PLAYED AN ENTIRE FUCKING GAME AS KILLER WITH THE WORDS "BRUTAL KILLER" COVERING UP THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF MY SCREEN. NOT TOO BAD, I CAN GET OVER THAT BIT OF THE SCREEN BEING TAKEN UP BUT IT MADE MY FRAMES DROP SIGNIFICANTLY SO WHENEVER I GOT IN A CHASE I WAS RUNNING AT LIKE 15FPS WHICH IS NOT FUCKING HELPFUL AT ALL!! THIS GAME HAS BEEN OUT THREE YEARS AND STILL FEELS LIKE IT'S IN EARLY ACCESS SOMETIMES
---
when i saw dwight in this i literally died
---
i wanna kiss whoever added dwight
---
As a Laurie main i can confirm that i have been slugged so many times. I don't even run DS anymore, and i still get slugged.
---
Hag quietly shuffled into the corner, organs in hand.
---
I'd trade all my Vanity Mirrors, Tufts or Hair, and Tombstone pieces for more Scratched Mirrors.
---
Thank you!
---
Ecstatic to eat a Steve!
---
I've gone back to give Stranger Things another try just because of this expansion.
---
Couldn't it just mean walk faster? Like Urban evasion but for walking?
---
that poor man can't catch a break even dead
---
You‚Äôre being the bitch here lol it‚Äôs literally moving pixels on a screen

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ctngzq/if_i_only_have_160_hrs_in_the_game_and_mostly/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Impressive. Most Impressive.
---
if you're looking for streamers on twitch you could try ZubatLEL, puppers, or no0b3. as for YouTube content creators monto is pretty good
---
When I hooked him, there was only one DC. The other two didn't really make an effort to save him.
---
Can't really unhook someone when you're killer.
---
Eh, I can only speak for the couple of games he was on my team. He went down very quickly, so of all people I wouldn't take looping advice from him.
---
He's a great killer though, and his videos are really educational for killers. I just don't agree with his survivor perk tier lists and opinions on a lot of perks. His killer gameplay is a lot stronger.
---
Ah and I bet you're the type to say "the n word is just a word" as if negative connotations just don't exist, aren't you?
---
I could, but I actually showed him in a real game and he's insisting that medium vaults are really just the same as fast vaults because they both cause notifications.
---
really, he's just doing it because on occasion I've been screwed by a medium vault and called it a slow vault on accident so he thinks I'm making up excuses
---
There should be a drop down on the upper floor.
---
It's the "choose not participate" part that made me think you're one of those people. I don't care if someone dislikes something that I like.
---
Uh thank you !
---
im like 90% sure BM means bad manners
---
I know your referring to the future but the entity should grab Jack the Ripper, that could be interesting maybe?
---
Yeah you can loop that is a thing right ?
---
Sry i didnt mean to post it unfinished T-T
---
1. Probably meg or claudette for survivor and probably hillbilly or trapper for killer
---
2. Some people are very toxic but it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems to be 
---
3. Tunneling is going after the unhooked person . Slugging is leaving them on the ground instead of hooking them 
---
4. Of course you‚Äôre welcome 
---
5. Yeah i guess . It will bring a lot of new players 
---
6. Monto and no0b3 are pretty much my favorite ones
---
7. Spirit for killer and nea/feng/laurie for survivor
---
8. You should play both 
---
9. Survivors are just skins and nurse is the hardest killer
---
1) Survivor: Meg - Her perks are generally great - amazing. Her one perk, Adrenaline, is one of the best perks in the entire game. Killer: It depends on your play style! - Survivors all play the same, minus switching around perks, but killers are different in that some walk slower/faster, some have range attacks while others don't, and some can even blink! 
---
2) Yes, but it tends to be non-high ranked players - You start off at rank 20 and work your way down to rank 1. Ranks 1 - 4, people are generally a lot nicer and won't call you names if you win/lose. From around 7 - 14, you'll find a ton of emotionally unstable, angry people. 15 - 20 = new people, and they generally don't know/care enough to say anything.
---
3) Tunneling = Focusing on one survivor and chasing them only. The idea of this game as a killer is to kill survivors and not let them escape, but this is viewed as bad manners. I, however, do not care if a killer tunnels me or I tunnel a survivor. That's the purpose of this game for a killer. If tunneling is their strategy, then it's theirs to use. Slugging is where you hit survivors to the point where they go down and leave them there, then go chase others. Same as tunneling, there's literally nothing that says you shouldn't do it minus angry people. But you should pay 0 attention to them anyways, as you'll leave them behind you when you climb the higher ranks.
---
4) You're welcome here, regardless of when or why you want to play dead by daylight
---
5) It is absolutely huge for us because Stranger Things is such a popular and amazing show. I'm so excited that it's coming to DBD, and I seriously cannot wait to play as the Demogorgon
---
6) Monto and Pain Reliever are my go-to's. There's other people out there, but I learned a lot from these two. They were a huge reason why I got to red ranks within only a couple of weeks of playing this game.
---
7) Meg + Legion/Nurse
---
8) You can play either or. Theres people who get to rank 1 with both, while others only play survivor or only play killer
---
9) Nurse is, in my opinion, the hardest killer to main because it can take awhile to learn her blinks, timing, range, etc... however, she's also the strongest killer in the game. There is really no 'hard survivor' as they all play the same, but there are perks that are not that great and make escaping more difficult
---
10) Yes, they are. They did a huge survey and asked us what we wanted, and we're getting what we asked for. We got killer re-work, dedicated servers, new maps, re-making of old maps, and clear-cut communication between us and the devs.
---
Enjoy your time in DBD, OP. I hope it's filled with awesome games and even better memories.
---
I HATE YOU FOR USING FRANKLIN'S DEMISE - NOT BECAUSE OF THE NORMAL REASONS BUT BECAUSE ON CONSOLE WHENEVER YOU GET HIT WITH FRANKLIN'S AND YOU DROP AN ITEM IT MAKES THE GAME STUTTER AND I ALMOST ALWAYS GET HIT AGAIN STRAIGHT AFTER BECAUSE I'VE ACCIDENTALLY RAN INTO A WALL BECAUSE THE GAME IS TOO BUSY FREEZING TO TELL ME WHERE MY CHARACTER MODEL IS ACTUALLY GOING
---
Sure and this idea came up quite a few times and also would be possible. People even translated it like it. But the german word she uses translates into running. We will see tomorrow tho
---
Whats wrong? Low meme knowledge maybe lol. They are even as bad as my memes
---
Oh it certainly is, but it's more of the ignoring anyone else part that makes it tunneling and irritating. Hopefully you get chased for large amounts of time because it A. Means you are good at running the killer around without dying and B. None of your teammates are making themselves easier targets for the killer. It's when your teammates run and are closer to the killer than you and they still refuse to change targets that it gets into tunneling territory. Now sometimes it's not really a matter of being a bad sport, perhaps that other survivor is really good at running the killer around and they know that so they domt want to bother when you are the better option. Some people would still call that tunneling, but that boils down to the Play for fun vs. Play competitively arguments that occasionally pop up
---
Not stupid at all, BM = bad mannering (intentionally being mean)
---
Some examples for DBD include:
---
* tbagging the killer at the exit gate
---
* tbagging the killer after you stun them
---
* spamming your flashlight at the killer
---
* sandbagging a fellow survivor (getting in their way to they get hit)
---
* The killer facecamping a survivor on the hook (literally standing one foot away while constantly hitting them)
---
* the killer slugging the last survivor (making them wait a few minutes to bleed out rather than finishing the game). Note: slugging is fine if there are other people to chase, buts it's rude when everyone else is dead because you're intentionally wasting their time
---
All of these are BM because their purpose is literally just to troll the other person and make them mad
---
The way youre playing is totally forbidden in the dbd community lol. 
---
Honestly just turn your message settings to private or ignore them. You killed them your way, you had fun. You hosted the game, if you camp they can do gens but they didnt. Its their fault Honestly. 
---
Just dont play by their rules :) have a good day and i hope i helped you.
---
Goodshit man! I like hearing this...
---
Because we dont care about the perk enough and can kill 4 survivors without it.
---
You just assumed I equate pixels in a video game to a word used for hundreds of years to demean, antagonize and vilify people because of their skin color, you are an actual fucking moron. What is wrong with killer mains?
---
Yeah but it will take you a while to learn how to do that though. To do it you need to run around a pallet to maximise the chase time but you‚Äôll probably be waiting on pallets to stun the killer when you first start which is fine but not the most efficient
---
Okay thank you ! Then I think I will do the same but sometimes I just wanna rage out
---
Wraith: we really need to come up with a new name.
---
I'm not sure if this comment should make me feel disgusted or impressed. So, have an upvote I guess.
---
Nice I will check them out. I know no0b3
---
I think the cannibal chapter is like 3 dollars. Its not a big achievement to have bbq before shrine
---
Maybe not comment like you know and instead ask questions then
---
Hellz yeah!!
---
Do you play 10 minutes a day? It takes about 20 killer matches with BBQ but no bonus BP offering to get to 1kk BP. 4 hours of play time at the most.
---
It's the same argument people use for that, dumbass. Connotations. They exist. They're why certain bad things are bad. Teabagging is bad because you're being cocky and taunting the killer when you know you're safe and they can't do anything about it. I shouldn't have to explain this to your dumbass.
---
Hello there! ;)
---
That is actually easy to figure out thank you XD
---
General Kenobi!
---
Yeah I agree but I also think sometimes sureivors over exaggerate like if your injured the killer would obviously want to chase you rather than a healthy survivor. I‚Äôm a survivor main as well so hopefully not biased here
---
Can‚Äôt wait to lobby up with the same killer 3x in a row!
---
Can one person who claims that the Demogorgon breakd established lore or rules cite where they saw this? I keep seeing people say the devs are breaking their own rules but absolutely no links to dev blogs, clips, or lore entries.
---
I play on and off but I‚Äôm leveling up 2 killers
---
If I was speedwagon I would donate my bps to other players, thing I wouldn't mind! I'm always near the 500k mark of bps
---
I don't consider my example of a 60 dollar fancy meal as a necessity, more of a luxury. But that argument could apply to many things.
---
It's an interesting discussion but it's one thats a bit abstract considering a dollar has no defined value, it fluxuactes.
---
So basically Steve is a mom and Nancy is Bob the Builder
---
he‚Äôs not the last iconic killer, I‚Äôm still praying for our boy chucky
---
She just gave up lol
---
I noticed that people can't find that anymore and it's because the article got changed. The current version mentions that you can place your portals as you like that wasn't part of the first version of the article. So we will just have to wait for tommorow
---
Uh okay! Than my main goal will be to be as good as him
---
I'm hoping it comes true with a spooky indoor map and flickering lights
---
Yeah that's the minimum bro
---
Bold of you to assume he wasnt stalking as ghostface
---
Meg was on a run in the woods

---
&gt; 1. First of all when I would buy the game which killer / Survivor would be the best for starters 
---
For survivor, you can't go wrong with feng, claudette, nea, or meg. all have perks valuable to new players.
---
For killer, I would say hillbilly or wraith
---
&gt; 2. Is the community really so toxic?
---
kind of, but also not really. the extent of toxicity is more meme than truth
---
&gt; 3. What is Tungeling ?
---
generally, when you go after someone right after they were taken down from the hook while ignoring anyone else
---
&gt; slugging ?
---
when you leave survivors in the dying state
---
&gt; 4. Am I not welcome here because I just picked up on it by stranger things ?
---
of course not. everyone is welcome
---
&gt; 5. Is the DBD x ST collab really so huge for dbd ( because I saw videos of it where people said that this is so huge for DBD) 
---
Definitely. This release is huge for the game, but it's also part of much more in the same patch which has dedicated servers, a grind re-work, and a change to survive with friends 
---
&gt; 6. Some YouTubers who bring DBD content ( funny / helpful videos would be cool )
---
Monto
---
Hybrid Panda
---
Farmer John
---
OhTofu
---
AL-boyo streams on twitch, but I don't know if he has a YouTube
---
&gt; 7. What do you Main ( Technically not a question just want to know )
---
This is pretty much the only game I play so I play survivor and killer about equally but every now and then i have phases where i play one or the other a lot. as far as characters go, i usually play Tapp or Nea for survivor and freddy as killer
---
&gt; 8. Is Playing Survivor and Killer acceptable or should I pick one
---
do whatever is most fun for you. many people think playing one side helps you learn the other and vice versa, but i don't think there's much truth to that. if you only like killer, then just play killer. if you only like survivor then just play survivor, if you like both, play both :)
---
&gt; 9. To question 1. What is the hardest survivor / Killer ?
---
generally no survivor is harder than any other, but david has a perk that makes him always injured. hardest killer really depends on the person and what you mean by hard
---
&gt; 10. Are the creators really so cool like everyone says it? 
---
I can't think of a more involved and nice development team
---
Kinda useless to run Sloppy on the plaq, as they will break from infection before you can hit them, and if you hit them, you do mangle them, but they can only heal by the fountains
---
Recently on console (xbox atleast), killer lobbies have been almost instant for me. Usually its about a 3-8min wait which leads to me playing on my laptop or scrolling reddit. But search times have been less than 1 min for the past week.
---
thanks you epic gamer
---
Amazing.

haha such a original and funny meme üëå
---
Ah. Well I dont pay attention to flairs. I did an oopsie
---
Taunt to Get bodied combo
---
This was my understanding.
---
This article mentions stealth it's after the part about the second perk of it
---
They should make a movie on The Shape that would be a classic I bet
---
No it‚Äôs not this perk will only be strong against low ranks high ranks this perk will be useless as aurochs can loop a pallet for 30 seconds
---
I'm not complaining it's just what I do when a game goes that bad. Love making a cuppa and stepping away for a bit.
---
Nah, Nea and the pussy cats
---
Sorry for answering late! I will not take it as competitively as i did with mf overwatch this game ripped my heart into peaces and jumped on it. I think I will play it first casually and then I will make my way to rank 1! I think it would be funny to get called a god
---
That highly depends on your definition of "mostly"
---
I'd say anything over 70/20 is a "main". (So for every 8 games as survivor they play 2 games of killer and vice versa)
---
BBQ is a god perk for the nurse, also nurse's calling if activated is a free hit. Sloppy is always good for slowing down the game but as the nurse isn't really needed (at least on PC). Noed is okay but survivors can counter it by cleansing all the totems and if you have ruin in your roster it's even more probable.
---
As for possible perks for her you can use whatever you want, but not chase related perks. Here are my favorites:
---
-Shadowborn: Having a wide fov helps find people easier and makes 360s almost impossible
---
-Whispers: This is absolutely the best tracking perk if used correctly. Even if not, this perks gives you a general awareness of where are the survivors
---
-Monitor and Abuse: Reduces the terror radius to 24m. Your first blink is 20m and the second can reach up to 12 without add-ons. It will makes your first hit easier
---
-Pop goes the weasel: Her mobility grants her the ability to check gens really quickly and so pop the middle gens or almost finished gens
---
-Devour hope: Her primary strength is her ability to end chases quickly. So paired with BBQ, hook and chase other people. Repeat. Then start mori everyone (if the totems gets to 5 stacks *without being cleansed*) 
---
-Haunted grounds: The perk itself is a trap, but it's a trap one must step in. Paired with ruin is gonna be kinda like Russian roulette. Works fantastic on her as she gets hits consistently
---
-Infectious fright: This is for snowballing. Down a survivor, spot another, down that survivor, and then hook if the perk doesn't activate
---
Nurse is really powerful but I heard on console is not really respected. But good nurses on console exist so when you master her blinks you can use whatever you like.
---
It‚Äôs because my guy is lacking eyes so now we won‚Äôt be able to flashlight blind it
---
Maybe it could be Frank's Friends
---
Okay nvm if I open the link here it just shows the same article then in the og post lol
---
It would be very unique and cool for stranger things to world build outside of the show though, in other words its a neat idea.
---
Besides, it seems like a revealation that is plausable for the show
---
Holy shit, good job.
---
This is also why I run tenacity haha
---
Imagine looking at the frontpage right?
---
Thank you! This helps so much ! sorry for answering late
---
That‚Äôs nice! Thank you! Sorry for answering late :D
---
Main refers to the side you mainly play. So, yes.
---
The green key is exclusively used for add-ons that allow you to see auras of killers and survivors. Higher rarity keys can do this as well while also being able to open the hatch.
---
If it was THAT T-800 with that look, then heck yeah it would be cool. But the exoskeleton look has been a bit overused imo.
---
Interesting what if I have no friends to play DBD with though? :(
---
To instill fear and awe in mere mortals
---
Nope just one
---
I just walked around hitting stuff once and one of the survivors just didn‚Äôt leave. Let themselves get sacrificed. I‚Äôd like to think it was out of pity, but it would also be funny if it accidentally happened.
---
It confuses me a little..... every killer has a story as to who they were and how they got pulled into the entity‚Äôs realm..... how does a humanoid that was never a human get pulled into this realm?...
---
Maybe I'm overestimating how far 20 meters is from the hatch but with the perk I was intended to for you to see it before you would hear it.
---
That‚Äôs me with Nancy. Fuck Nancy.
---
I'm in this photo and I don't like it
---
This is just a description how about you wait and play against it first then you can bitch ok :)
---
I thought we were going with "Killers Anonymous". Hahaha

-Miles Edgeworth
---
Survivor: Kenny
---
Perks:
---
One eye is still enough to see:
---
Unlock potential in aura reeding ability 
---
you can see the killers aura when he/she picks up the survivor or puts them on a hook if out of 16/12/8 meters 
---
heavily loaded
---
each time you take a protection hit you recive a token 
---
up to a maximum of 4 tokens
---
each token deacreases time to struggle out by 3/4/5%
---
remember the loved ones:
---
you become obsessed with one survivor in which you fall in love with
---
if the survivor dies
---
you feel sad and empty
---
you suffer from the exposed effect for 15 seconds and your action speed is reduces by 10 % 
---
for 60 seconds
---
after that you came over your sadness and you are stronger than ever 
---
heal up 1 health state and get a sprint burst of 150% for 5 seconds and shows you the killers aura for 3 seconds and your action speed is increased by 15/20/25% to the end of the trial
---
(ignores exhaustion, causes the exhaustion status for 60/50/40 seconds)
---
i hope you guys like my idea

The obvious choice for me is Barb and yet...
---
I wanted it to be a reference to Ripley's relationship with Newt from the second film, plus there hasn't really been an overly defensive survivor for DBD so I thought it might be interesting.
---
*Me like. . Noob Stompers.*

---
Check guides about perks builds
---
Ignore the posts of people crying about everything, waste of time tbh.
---
And you are good to go ! The game its pretty fun and it's not that toxic as people say.
---
Thank you so much! Dude it was never so hard for me to answer people, so sorry for answering late! I meant the playability.
---
Two eat, another munches. That's all really
---
What I find hilarious about all these people is that no one seems to be taking into account brand new players or people who don't have time to grind one character for hours just to get the teachable. I got other shit to do in my life so I can't play DBD for hours on end. These people really are self centered if they think everything should be catered to them.
---
Nope, confidential information
---
Official backstory:
---
&gt;When unsuspecting travellers came through her woods, she discovered her new favourite prey: humans. Unlucky souls who strayed into her territory were slaughtered like any other animal. 
---
It doesn't explicitly state that she ate them, but that seems to be implied.
---
Overcharge T4 damaging a generator overcharges it, the next time it's interacted with the survivor is face with a skill check with no success zone. Failing this skill check causes it to explode and reveal to aura's of all survivors who seen it
---
we need an alexei survivor
---
Bro this happens to me too! Sometimes at the loading screen not just the offering screen. If I move my stick during both i noticed it crashes less, I dunno why if I just leave the stick still it crashes almost for sure lol. I‚Äôve called Xbox and bitched about this and they said it could be a hardware problem and they have to find out whether it‚Äôs the Xbox or the game. They want me to uninstall my account and then reload it to troubleshoot, I just haven‚Äôt done this. I thought maybe the next update would stop it and it hasn‚Äôt. I get the ventilation/overheating message too and I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that, my machine is never hot and I‚Äôve put fans on it and shit and it still does it. It does it after I‚Äôve turned it on after 10 hours of not using it. I‚Äôm no expert but i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs overheating but that‚Äôs just me. Finally someone else with this problem lol! But I‚Äôm sorry trust me I know it sucks!
---
Maybe it is a little OP. I stated several times before that balancing was something I was never good at so comments and feedback is always welcomed. Thank you for your support!
---
It may be. Sorry.
---
Thank you! I will definitely do that!
---
Does he really say that? Omg
---
Just spend millions of dollars on a movie 4Head
---
Yeah killer was mad he tunneled all game and we instantly found his Ruin
---
Sloppy I understand, but Thanks goes so well with her
---
100%
---
He‚Äôs a massive complainer, a red rank elitist, and too arrogant, but he‚Äôs a solid ass player for sure.
---
yea lol, at least im not going insane thinking im the only one with this lol
---
Yeah same I've never really understood it either haha
---
Or lee üòÇüòÇit‚Äôd be awesome
---
It happened to me too. I had just bought the dlc and leveled him a couple levels and then the shrine came.
---
Me with P3 chili boi
---
Ik the struggle I barely got him level 40 like a week ago then bbq comes out in the shrine :(
---
as far as playability goes, i'd say the hardest ones are the killers who move away from the more standard gameplay. this would be hag, nurse, spirit, and huntress. in my experience many people have trouble playing hag correctly in particular
---
I think there was originally supposed to be a tie-in to the walking dead show that got nixxed, as the timeframe and distance she could have gone before the vehicle died matched up.  I believe the character in the show also closely resembled her.
---

FUCK ME SHE WOULD RATHER DO A GEN WHILE THE KILLER IS CHASING SOMEONE ELSE. SOMETIMES I FUCKING WONDER WHY I EVEN BOTHER SAVING PEOPLE. I SHOULD JUST SAY FUCK THEM AND LEAVE THEM FOR DEAD.

---
Stick with it my dude, season 3 gets really gory and intense all of a sudden
---
Let‚Äôem rip
---
No problem! The best way to get used to pretty much any mechanics or strategies in the game is to try them out yourself, but there are many youtube videos that give tips or "loose guides" on how to do them so I would definitely recommend watching some once you have played a couple matches!
---
Think of DH like Reaper's ULT in OW.
---
It will rarely be useful, but, once you FINALLY get a full team kill with it, you'll feel like a badass for the rest of the day
---
Dude it's a such a fun game and I'm fairly new. Glad that you're really enjoying the game like me, and those moments are really the most fun, today I had a game where trapper refused to kill anybody and we all just farmed bloodpoints with him. Fun times man, this game is the best
---
You shouldn‚Äôt block out his name. If hes being toxic then people should know his name. See how he likes it

It was great today. Was playing Michael Myers, got 2 kills and then the third hooked as the exit gate opened. (Farm map with the 2.5 story house). David went to save Nea and I saw him and got my stalk to 90%. I fake went away so he would go around the house again and while I was on the steps above him I exposed him and jumped down at him ü•∞

---
Humour is subjective

There's also the fact that one of the screenshots shows a hook in the background while he's not holding anyone
---
If i had to recommend a content creator, I would say otzdarva. He an extremely nice person and very informative. He has multiple beginner guides to help out new players. I would highly recommend watching his videos/streams.
---
Inb4 the pointless "but what about a killer that looks like a survivor!!!"
---
This is also true. Learning the new killers must be difficult for that reason, too. I played from 2016-2017 but didn't play the entire year of 2018 and only started again this may. It took a while before I knew all of the new survivors, killers, and maps.
---
Kevin would approve
---
Got it too but this game wants me to have all 3 tiers or monstrous shrine and unrelenting before I deserve that spicy treat of a perk
---
I don't play nurse main, but the first time I played her I wiped the entire lobby in under 3/4 minutes. The longer you hold her ability, the further you teleport, you have up to 3 blinks (small teleport) in a row. You can use teleport to go through pallets and walls. You have to attack just after teleporting as you will be stunned momentarily. Be warned however, the nurse is the slowest killer in the game, meaning you have to use teleport very precisely, I'd suggest just going into games and trying to teleport as close to survivors as possible. Normally, don't use the longest teleport unless they are really far, because you might go past them and strike nothing. I'd say to use longest teleport when you hear a sound (failed generators, ect) because they wont expect it. I'm not a big fan on perks, so you might have to do it some research on that, although there are ability attachments that increase your number of blinks or reduce stun time. Hope this helps.
---
*looks at hags that moris their survivors*
---
Playing killer made me a better survivor because I was able to mimic what they did to me that gave me a hard time. Then I played survivor a lot because survivors were destroying me as a killer and I had to learn what better killers did to combat them.
---
That was one hell of a loop
---
They're weaker, that's the thing. I don't hate them either, I just don't think we need more of them.
---
It's easier to farm as killer for sure. It's a bit more even now since the recent changes, but you'll still likely be getting more on killer even without BBQ.
---
Lol nah you've just been lucky. 
---
If you win I call you trash. 
---
If I win I call you trash.

---
Yea, my killer perks are still pretty limited, I have hardly played trapper. I want to get huntress lullaby to boost overcharge as well. That or swap overcharge for something else since some good players seem to easily hit the "tremendously hard" skill check without other buffs.
---
What icon changing?
---
You can also look downwards at the pallet without phasing, and when they see that they aren‚Äôt blinding you, they‚Äôll probably try to vault and give you a free vault.

According to the devs she do feed them and from her addon she tied them up cause she know they will run away. She know what she doing is wrong but decide to do it anyway.
---
The new ones do typically have a lot more going on with their powers than the classic killers

Does this also works with Myers lunge? I think he can cover that distance

another fun fact, the actual demogorgon from DnD looks nothing like this creature from stranger things, they referred to it as the demogorgon as that was the boss they were fighting in their last session.  The actual demogorgon has a few different appearances through out the edition, with him looking more lizard like in older additions and ape like in newer editions, but he ALWAYS has 2 heads, the 2 headed demon king is a staple for the actual demogorgon.

I wish that BHVR and netflix partnered up to make a series about the killers. Make 45 minute episodes detailing background lore ending in them going into the fog.
---
It would give more background to the lore, attract new players, and would overall be pretty cool to see the killers on TV
---
It would even give an opportunity for killers like Pig and Ghostface to have a unique backstory.

Oof. I need sailorboy Steve in my life!
---
NoT eVeRyThInG iS aBoUt YoU...
---
*No, but this 150,000 blood points are all mine.*
---
And interestingly enough he's probably the least likely to eat a Survivor.
---
Despite having a perk that literally implies he's eating the Survivors.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Japanese grudge ghosts are like that. They die with so much rancor and hatred in their hearts that they become malevolent and lash out on the living, even if they technically have nothing to do with their death.
---
Idk who they are or why they hate the game so much but no self respecting person willingly uses the term ‚Äúsoy cucks‚Äù lmao
---
It makes more sense in Black Panthers voice since Philip Ojomo/Wraith is actually African
---
This happens to me so often it‚Äôs a crime.
---
Definitely not, it‚Äôs not just the lunge, it‚Äôs also how fast you is goin
---
Okay I will watch a video from him now
---
I figured as much, the wording was super weird &amp; that‚Äôs okay! Just wanted to share with you guys to see what you thought.
---
I will do that !
---
A fun party game? No, not really... It has too many mechanics for it to be a party game, it has lots of depth to it, and a high level entry point...
---
It sounds like you don't know what you're talking about and like you'd be rank 16-20
---
You can jump off the edge, which will spawn you back inside to find hatch.. if you have enough time that is. I‚Äôve had this happen to a friend and he actually got hatch
---
The Hag eats her victims
---
I feel like if you reveal him he should be a short stun effect. Know I'm gonna get downvoted but he just feels to strong
---
It does mention the ‚Äúrifts‚Äù which survivors can use to go between worlds to unhook fellow survivors or escape the hook!
---
We need more devs like him around.
---
Classic Stalin, not letting people do what they want...
---
Isn't the entity being fed with the hope of the survivors? This is genius
---
Make it the flavor text at the bottom
---
I don‚Äôt believe it would work. The Arnold version is somewhat of a good guy depending on the movie, and the plain old robo guys aren‚Äôt popular enough to warrant high enough sales imo.
---
Eh
---
I agree doc is pretty good...until you get to red ranks
---
Reeeeeeeee my mental property! Jk
---
When some people lose they always blame it on someone else to feel better. Even if they really know it's not true.
---
it‚Äôs against subreddit rules
---
&gt; The Demogorgon is an animal that has no emotions
---
This is one of the most absurd misconception I see around. Emotions come from animals. Humans are animals and therefore have emotions.
---
Besides, even in the series, there's a demodog that clearly felt emotions, so that argument is completely null.
---
Same
---
I mean, feng min has a skin called Enter The Matrix. It's still around.
---
This and the survivor bug where you can‚Äôt escape are ruining a lot of games for me
---
wow how tall is mathieu?
---
Why are you being downvoted if you run the same addons for impossible skill check doc it‚Äôs a pretty big fuck you
---
I always thought of him as a nice person, but he was amazing. He was just sitting next to us while we were eating.
---
like what
---
Probably around 1.8 meters. I'm just very small üòÇ
---
I would‚Äôve DCd in his face. People like that are honestly fucking scum
---
I'm sick of this joke
---
Excuse me but I personally have  pig
---
"This fucker thinks he can get on **##MY##** **##BOAT?##**"
---
But I must please the entity.
---
Entity has literally no reason to break down the will of humans and make deals with them if she can just randomly kidnap genetic monsters
---
The utter complexity of this monologue dumbfounds us simple gamers
---
The meta deviates, but perk builds usually consist of 4 of the following:
---
 (Lithe, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard), Adrenaline, Iron Will, Unbreakable, Borrowed Time, Urban Evasion. 
---
Self Care is slowly being worked out of people‚Äôs loadouts and isn‚Äôt worth a spot anymore imo.
---
I don't have any immediate ideas, but anything is better than another licensed killer.
---
DLCs might be exempt from their refund policy.
---
If he's fed, he probably will hook survivors willingly! It most likely will view the entity as an "alpha" anyway, with it's beastlike and wolfpack nature that Demodogs have.
---
We already have a cop and a grumpy old man.
---
Spirit was the first killer DLC I got, and let‚Äôs just say I don‚Äôt regret buying her
---
Let me guess survivor
---
This reminds me of the time I prestiged Bubba to III and found Insidious in my first bloodweb.
---
I must be the Chosen one.
---
I know not everyone does but it sucks to get rolled then stand there and watch everyone t bag and troll you instead of just leaving. I‚Äôd rather not deal with it. But I don‚Äôt want to DC either.
---
I NEED THIS!!!!!
---
Tunneling the gens. What?
---
PLEASE DON'T BUTT DANCE AFTER DROPPING A PALLET ON A HUNTRESS! SHE CAN THROW HATCHETS (and probably the game too)
---
Looks like a couple claudettes didnt like this
---
I find her very difficult to play. I‚Äôm a console player. Same with nurse.
---
U agree with your other comment, but you have to admit it's still pretty funny secret offerings partially do the exact opposite of the word "secret."
---
I wouldn't even be mad, he asked for it and he delivered
---
Haven't watched in a while, but I always had the impression it's more of a meme / reflex at this point.
---
It's either, too easy, you were a sweaty try-hard, zzzzzzzz boring, or you were hacking/playing unfair.
---
For some, there is no good game.
---
As long as you have a good headsets she's ezpz to play as
---
Stalin let you do what you wanted, if it was state approved.
---
Bee lining to each generator, like hard patrolling the generators when there is only 1 gen left to do.
---
I play both actually. How presumptuous. I prefer survivor because I don‚Äôt even have to be good at killer to do well. There‚Äôs virtually no challenge most of the time, and every time I play killer there‚Äôs at least one case where a survivor gets fucked over by a bug in the game. As a person who plays survivor as well, it always sucks to see it happen to someone.  It also sucks to see the same thing happen to a killer when I‚Äôm a survivor. I‚Äôm a firm believer in BALANCE. When a game goes unbalanced it eventually dies. Period. Now shoo.
---
Sometimes a dead raccoon is better then a survivor. One time I was playing nice, downed a guy, carried him to my Ruin and kept hitting it. He wiggled free and run. No biggie, i'll just do it again.
---
FOURTEEN times later I gave up after I noticed another player who was crouched watching the whole thing
---
Yeah, some killers just patrol the last three gens over and over destroying them as they go by.
---
What an absolute mad lad
---
Yeah thought that was a bit odd I assume it means patrol
---
Season 4 Clementine could also be a possible survivor
---
I wish the creator would have one of the other Legion killers show up, even for a gag.
---
I disagree. I'm the main character in this subreddit
---
Oh ok. I love the idea!
---
I guess he means when the SURVIVORS make a poor strategy and end up with 3 gens near eachother, because THE SURVIVORS, didn't plan the areas that they would have left to repair genes...
---
And somehow it's the killers fault
---
Hey Why did you delete your post? It was amazing
---
All the disconnects disagree, but I see the point in not giving into toxic players.
---
Guess who controlled the state....
---
That dude really should've just left me after the first loop
---
He can only hit one survivor so somebody just needs to take the hit and the rest can gtfo. Its sucks but if all 4 are in the same place maybe that's kinda the survivors fault?
---
I can only hear the DBD killers voices as Sam‚Äôs.
---
Freddy though, ehh I‚Äôm a big Nightmare fan so I‚Äôll always hear Robert England.
---
I swear somebody better actually write a book about killer rules and have it be like, 3000 pages long of just non - stop ranting and things killers can't do to the point all they can do is watch from spawn lol.
---
More like goku, people want him, but it won't happen because of legal reasons.
---
What‚Äôs your problem, I haven‚Äôt seen a single killer posting this problem say it‚Äôs only a killer issue, it‚Äôs fucking everyone‚Äôs issue because it ruins any balance the game has
---
Dude... should I make a google doc?
---
Definitely try to get the plaid flannel to learn he blink distance. The rest is just experience
---

---
My friend got this bug a couple months ago before I joined this subreddit. Never knew how often this happened :(
---
I don't think anyone was doing this
---
I don't know much about Stranger Things...I take it Demogorgon doesn't possess human level intelligence?
---
They take practice, but once you get it down you're gonna make every survivor dc
---
That's a perk, right?
---
I mean, I always wanted a more feral killer, like a werewolf kind of killer, this is basically what I wanted, and it's a pretty cool monster that can teleport and stealth.
---
his builds are just horrible
---
The entity tortures them until they do her bidding. All that effort makes no sense if she can just grab the equivalent of a roided up bear
---
Because I misspelled the word 'Licensed' in the title and it annoyed the hell out of me lol
---
He'd happily eat them, just needs to be cooked into Chili first.

Add on. It lets you see where you're doing to teleport to
---
This format is used too much... Have my updoot
---
Nah, we need a full on library book, sell it for ¬£2.50 and gain a one penny profit due to all the paper you use. We need like a "Ten commandments of Dead By Daylight" kinda thing.
---
Yea
---
Also, Love your videos! Took me a while to recognize ya.
---
Oh boy here I go circlejerking again
---
I only see him complain about snipers when the chat is calling them out as a sniper or when he checks steam profiles. He gets sniped to a point where he checks the profiles before match. He will legitimately go against the same Survivor 11 times in a row who looks at his stream to instantly break his totems. The Survivor even wears the tru3ta1ent shirt from the charity pack and stuff.
---
He definitely complains a lot and isn't my favorite streamer but the dude gets sniped a lot. Probably because he complains about it and gives them the reaction they want
---
Mcote lowkey a fckn unit.
---
Hate Mikster or like Mikster, he's spitting facts
---
Many people. Stalin wasn't the only one that had power in USSR.
---
Nice strategy
---
But you gotta respect the 4% lmfao
---
Dude that is BS. Most of the time he just complains about ruin being gone too quickly or says that totems need a rework. The only complains about stream snipers when he checks their profile before the match and recognizes them.
---
Call me cynical but I don't buy it. Level 50 so we can't tell if you just recorded the same bloodweb and out it twice. Why were you recording anyway?
---
Essentially, you have to be hit three times while the killer is carrying someone now, or get hit when someone injured is near you. It's no longer free, so a lot of people don't want to adjust their playstyle to capitalize on it.
---
Alrighty, thanks
---
I don‚Äôt think I could do that :/ my hand writings terrible and yeah
---
Sorry but you're doing something wrong if a survivor can loop one pallet for half a minute.
---
She is slow while on cooldown, and it's not hard to lose her, because she can't see survivors while in phase.
---
She ain't no nurse, but she isn't Wraith level easy.
---
y r u being downvoted

But you at least gotta wait until the gates open for everyone else
---
Would have been more funny if he dc'ed as soon as the last gen was done.
---
Sorry would you like me to take it down?
---
Yeah he did... He was like THE dictator... Remember how he had people executed if they were simply suspected of being spies, he pointed fingers at everyone having them killed like a witch Hunt!
---
It acts very animalistically, being attracted to sound and blood; attacking indiscriminately. The only 'intelligent' actions it has done is capture humans while full and trapping them to consume them later.
---
‚Äúit‚Äôs just a well known rule for survivors to not do more than 2 toolboxes or else‚Äù 
---
Actual message from a P3 Spirit I played against the other day.
---
Nono happy it made it to your discord!
---
They‚Äôre footsoldiers to a hive mind
---
Hi, welcome! 
---
1) For a survivor, I‚Äôd say either Dwight or Nea. For a killer, I‚Äôd say either Wraith or Trapper (moreso Wraith).
---
2) Nah, the community isn‚Äôt overly toxic. Sure there are a fair few toxic members, but don‚Äôt let it distract you from the majority- we‚Äôre all mostly nice players, trust me.
---
3) Other people have answered this, so I‚Äôll leave it.
---
4) Of course you‚Äôre welcome! Hell, I only came to this game originally because I heard Freddy Krueger was coming to it a couple of years back. You‚Äôre more than welcome to join our community, no matter why you joined.
---
5) Yeah, the DBD/ST collaboration is huge. Now true, the game has had a lot of famous horror characters added- but nothing on Stranger Things‚Äô level.
---
6) For pure entertainment, I‚Äôd say Monto, Farmer John and Puppers (he‚Äôs a streamer, but he uploads his clips to YouTube). Others may say No0b3- I personally don‚Äôt like him, but you may think differently. For more serious and educational videos, I‚Äôd say PainReliever and Bricky- especially his DBD Casefiles (Bricky also has a fair amount of humour injected into his videos).
---
7) For survivor, I main Ash Williams. For killer, I main Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and Ghostface.
---
8) Playing both is encouraged. There‚Äôs stuff you wouldn‚Äôt know about Killer if you don‚Äôt play survivor- and ditto. To become the best at one of them, you must play both of them, imo. And anyway, they‚Äôre both very fun to play, so go for it!
---
9) Hardest survivor (in terms of perks) is probably David King. There‚Äôs a fair amount of timing that goes into, say, Dead Hard. Hardest survivor is an odd one, so I may have the unpopular opinion here. Hardest killer is without a doubt the Nurse. 
---
10) Yup, BHVR are very cool. They have a very lovable team (some of which lurk in this sub from time to time, such as community manager Peanits), and they‚Äôve brought so many iconic characters and locations to this game. They may fuck up sometimes, but they‚Äôre still great.
---
It's not bannable it's just sweaty as fuck.
---
And THE COOK as the killer

---
WHY THE FUCK HASNT ANYONE SUGGESTED HANNIBAL LECTOR AS A KILLER ALONGSIDE PINHEAD AND PENNYWISE WE DESERVE ALL THREE
---
Then just upload it to the Dbd forums lol. 5 pages a day should be the book finished in just short of 2 years, easy, right?
---
I like Tru3 too, he taught me a lot of shit when I first bought the game but these days he's almost unbearable. Wish he wouldn't take so many build requests if he's just going to complain about that build not being perfect the whole game.
---
Wait they have myers on mobile now?
---
Post only in r/dbd, looks like a devs alt to spitball to the community.
---
Bloodpoints are the same at the end of the web, and at the start of the new one. It would take way too much effort to edit that for something this simple.
---
It thematically really just doesn‚Äôt fit. If we were going to get a non-human at least have it be chucky or the thing
---
1-10:
---
Have fun. Stop taking directions from this sub.
---
But now your comment is even more pointless than my post or the other post before me.
---
Shame that is a 1/25 chance of happening since even purple and red ranks are full of idiots that just crowd around the killer while he chases you without being of any use. That and people still somehow see ruin at redranks and spend half the game looking for the totem instead of doing gens
---
I feel like the mentality in this community is that killers are extremely weak, while survivors are op as fuck, and I gotta say as someone whose started playing about 2 months ago I don't really feel that to be true. I know I don't have 2000+ hours logged, and a full swf group of super pro survivors with all meta perks can dunk on a killer, but I feel like everything outside of that top level play is just brushed aside. 
---
Ghost face feels inconsistent. You look at him and sometimes you just can't snap him out bc the game just won't recognize it. And when the outcome of not exposing him is getting exposed, and potentially one shot, that's a big issue imo. 
---
I'd say me and my friends are at an intermediate level, I'm rank 8, and they're like 10 (I play a little more) we do a 3 player swf, have decent teachables/items, but we almost never escape versus ghost face. The only counterplay feels like spine chill/OOO, which feels dumb. Not to mention literally everyone runs ruin, bbq+chili+nurses calling. 
---
I don't think he should be made unplayable, but every other killer at least feels consistent, he just feels like RNG
---
Bill literally died.
---
I'm really curious: what rank was this killer? I dont see a lot of good players face camp. Let alone high rank
---
well there isn't any reason why u cant play for fun, but I think players should know how to play. I think playing objective and efficiently is pretty satisfying tbh. And it doesn't reduce toxicity, but it might reduce errors made by players who are genuinely unaware that their plays might be negatively impacting the survival chance of the team, like pallet camping, farming, using lockers, stuff like that.
---
True true
---
Thanks man! and it‚Äôs a good meme why wouldn‚Äôt it what did you mean by tunneling gens however?
---
Thank you kind sir, I will remove at once
---
I swapped to Corrupt intervention. It may not last as long as ruin COULD last, but there's a zero percent chance of someone spawning on it and destroying it in the first 20 secons
---
Circle jerking?
---
I don't think kids are the primary audience of stranger things lol
---
And somehow is bog standard at actually eating... people...
---
I mean, he's probably eaten more people in dbd than when the dodgy Leatherface movie came to existence. And that's saying something.
---
*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
---
It‚Äôs like seeing a broadsword in Star Wars or laser blasters in a story about King Arthur. Sure it‚Äôs cool, but it‚Äôs bizarre
---
Good point, but it would be easy since the background is static.
---
A suprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
---
The Thing. Chucky. Deadites/kandarian demon. IT.

If we‚Äôre gonna lore bust we can get something better than a flower head monster

Shouldn't have body blocked, but shouldn't have spared either. Just chainsaw her immediately and get it over with.

Walter
---
It‚Äôs all a joke kinda but when the last 3 gens are all nearby each other and the killer keeps circling around them.
---
This is fan made, I saw the actual redit post a few days ago, but i can't tell you who made it
---
It's not just the money it's also the time spent getting bloodpoints to level him up. And I did bought and level him up to 40, but just saying this for others.
---
Whatever you so guys. **DO NOT** and I cannot emphasize enough ***CLICK THAT***
---
I see lol
---
Thanks for the response!
---
May I ask why? When I played it was the premier perk!
---
I was hoping they'd change every episode/scene randomly but act as if they're the same.
---
An obsession is indicative of some sort of emotion or desire. A lack of empathy is not a lack of disappointment or morbid enjoyment
---
Sam wise the brave would be OP  as fuck.  Couldn't use him
---
All perks cost 2k except for the first time they appear on the shrine, at which point they cost 2.7k.
---
I know I would
---
Feels really good especially when there's 3 gens left and you know that the one who left the gen to save you will come back to it shortly and complete it
---
Thanks! That‚Äôs fine. I saw it on Facebook. I‚Äôm gonna delete it since a few people have said it‚Äôs already been posted here too. Have a good day! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Instead of "Don't use any good perk" it should've been "Don't use perks"
---
Oh, I see. Well now I am certainly a bit concerned about some people wanting to do the do with it. And no, do not ask where I saw such people.
---
'Right off the bat', love how it implies it will be ruined anyway, just not straight away
---
Ever been hit with a phone book? Names can very much hurt you.
---
Hey it's the only thing that makes applying deep wound worthwhile ):
---
On Android I‚Äôm not sure, on iPhone you gotta change your App Store country to one that has the game. YouTube ‚Äúhow dead by daylight mobile iphone/Android‚Äù and you‚Äôll find some walk throughs on downloading it.
---
This is why I wish there was a way to tell in the lobby if people are SWF.
---
It's worse when you're being sneaky and watching him put the traps down then completely forget them when you're being chased.
---
It‚Äôs not human level but it‚Äôs very intelligent, at least in terms of hunting. It‚Äôs also controlled by a hive mind that is at the very least as intelligent as a human.
---
Haven't you heard? When survivors talk about killers it's memeing, but when killers talk about survivors it's toxic circle jerking. Get with the times dude!
---
I... actually kind of like the first perk.
---
Yeah, I fucking meant for you to be less angry in your post, I was saying that it is a Survivor problem too and that no one thinks it‚Äôs a killer only issue, and then you get mad that ‚ÄúKILLERS ALWAYS COMPLAIN‚Äù, of course they do, we all do, but none of those posts nor anything else leads anyone to believe it‚Äôs a killer only issue, my problem isn‚Äôt that that happened to you, or that you posted it, it‚Äôs that you need to take a chill pill and realize that no one ever said it‚Äôs not a survivor problem too
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!
---
Everyone keeps talking about these when they coming?
---
No offense OP, but why do you care?
---
Guess I‚Äôm just old
---
Hello! And welcome!
---
Will copy/paste your questions for ease.
---
1. First of all when I would buy the game which killer / Survivor would be the best for starters
---
Survivors are really just skins since you can unlock all their perks for each other overtime. It‚Äôs highly suggested you start with either Claudette for Self-Care (ability to heal yourself) or Dwight for Bond and Prove Thyself (See other survivors and work with others faster).
---
Ultimately, you‚Äôll find a survivor playstyle that works for you. Some people like looping and being chased, others prefer stealth and objectives. You‚Äôll find a playstyle and pick perks off that.
---
Of Killers, Hillbilly and Nurse are top tier, but may take some getting used to. Huntress has ranged capability, but she is much slower in a chase. Leatherface is good to level up for the perk BBQ and Chili (Extra bloodpoints) which means faster leveling overall.
---
Personally, I like Clown for his area denial power. Throwing a bottle and spreading his cloud can deny survivors escapes and corral them where you want them to go. Just like survivor, you‚Äôll find what works for you and your preferred playstyle.
---
2. Is the community really so toxic?
---
No. Most of the community is pretty chill and laid back. The vocal minority of assholes are vocal, but it‚Äôs much better than other online games.
---
3. What is Tungeling ? slugging ? ( I don‚Äôt think I wrote it right )
---
Tunneling is when the Killer focuses on killing one specific survivor before anyone else.
---
Slugging is when the Killer downs a survivor and leaves them on the ground instead of picking them up and bringing the survivor to a hook.
---
Both are viable strategies for the Killer, depending on situation, but many survivors like to think they can dictate how the Killer can play based on their (survivor‚Äôs) idea of fun. Ignore them. Sometimes you need to tunnel, sometimes you need to slug. The Killer‚Äôs responsibility is not to insure the survivors have fun.
---
4. Am I not welcome here because I just picked up on it by stranger things ? 
---
You‚Äôre more than welcome. But this is the Internet, and some people are assholes. We also have our fair share of hipsters who want to look cool because they played DbD before you. Ignore them.
---
5. Is the DBD x ST collab really so huge for dbd ( because I saw videos of it where people said that this is so huge for DBD)
---
It‚Äôs kinda big for DbD. We‚Äôve gotten licensed horror content in the past, but nothing with such a huge following as Stranger Things. Not only is this going to bring in a huge amount of fresh faces and new players, it‚Äôs going to open up the door to other licenses who will see the success and want to become a part of it.
---
The devs have previously been denied by some licenses, which may now come back and want to join up. Getting such a large and famous IP like Stranger Things shows this game is the real thing.
---
6. Some YouTubers who bring DBD content ( funny / helpful videos would be cool )
---
[Monto](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMontologist)
---
[Puppers](https://www.youtube.com/user/Anusbuttlol)
---
[HybridPanda](https://www.youtube.com/user/hybridpanda)
---
7. What do you Main ( Technically not a question just want to know )
---
I main Survivor. Used to main Killer, then friends started playing and I switched over.
---
Play Dwight
---
8. Is Playing Survivor and Killer acceptable or should I pick one ? 
---
9. To question 1. What is the hardest survivor / Killer ?
---
10. Are the creators really so cool like everyone says it? 
---
Thank you so much for your time! I hope I don‚Äôt sound like a noob noob
---
No I‚Äôm not some loops and be abused for 30 seconds or more
---
He has to be trolling. That doesn't sound real.
---
Monto does the same. Maybe it's a good thing he only uploads matches where he wins.
---
What?
---
It's boring but admittedly works.

Fer sure my guy.

Contrary. Every killer can be ‚Äúheard‚Äù if you have a good headset and can pay attention to your surroundings. 
---
Pig: hear her breathing and growl w/ dash. 
---
Ghost Face: leather,  breathing. 
---
Wraith: loud footsteps and shimmer when moving. 
---
Prayer Bead Spirit might be the hardest but you can hear her loud ass footsteps if you pay close attention. 
---
All of these killers can be detected by spine chill/premonition. 
---
Hardest person would be tier 1 Michael because he trumps any aura reading perks. 
---
You can‚Äôt just stare directly at the gen when working on it. Always look around you at all times and be aware of your surroundings.  Even a non stealthy killer can have tinkerer and can get you.
---
I'M SICK OF MORONS ABUSING 3-4 WINDOWS LOOPS MAKING CHASES IMPOSSIBLE
---
Good god...you‚Äôre 100% correct.
---
He‚Äôs very biased about Dead by Daylight and gives it unfair criticisms. Like in his DBD vs F13 he basically treated DBD like it‚Äôs Michael Myers the game and ignored literally any crucial part of balance.
---
‚ÄúWhy do the killers wipe/inspect their weapons after hitting it‚Äôs so stupid‚Äù. Well it‚Äôs called balance and unlike F13 you get a chance to make distance after getting hit.
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt kill people in this game‚Äù. Because within the lore of the game and also is apart of the gameplay as, unlike F13, you can actually get a chance to play the game without jason just spawning up your asshole and choking you to death within the first 2mins of the game.

He also bitches a lot when licensed characters join DBD. He cried so much over Ash becoming a ‚Äúbitch‚Äù  because he gets his ass kicked (despite ash getting his shit pushed in constantly in the films/TV show by weaker enemies.
---
Tl;Dr. He‚Äôs just a massive minge when it comes to DBD
---
I did the same except I got one for survivor where I escape as David. Who is level 1 with no items or anything good. I went through 4 games to complete it.

To be fair, I'm not putting you or your post down anyway, just poking fun at post similarity with the new content that everyone's scrambling to get karma for
---
But what about the crows man? What's their relationship with the entity? Why are they there, cawing and helping out the killer?
---
Hardcore parkour!
---
Man what a pretty good job so far.
---
I mean your whole post is crying. You complain about stuff that isn't true in the comments to people and cry when you're called out on it.
---
I'm not mad at all.
---
This is a little bit cursed
---
He's on console
---
Once you learn to play her, she's not too hard to play considering she's not half bad, however she is one of 3 killers (some may debate 2) killers that are actually good enough to win games that no other killer could win, so until every killer is around the Same power level as she is, it's hard for me to complain about her. Unless of course you would rather see only nurses and billies at high ranks, but I would not.
---
Your going against some boosted ass survivors if you don‚Äôt have to try or your lying about your rank red ranks will make your life miserable as killer
---
Youre here to cry on my lighthearted joke of a meme.  Keep sobbing.  Manchild. Go cry to someone who cares, maybe his discord or something?
---
No, manchildren just love playing with legos
---
Btw I thought the main was funny. It's your comments that I find toxic and cringe
---
Scooby is gonna be a killer in that dlc
---
All I wanted was a spider based killer and now that clown and this thing are out, (phobia and non human) it kinda gives me hope
---
Is that an emoji I see?
---
I don't. 
---
... because Thanatophobia won't just drop on my bloodweb...
---
*cries in rank reset survivor teammates that run around like headless chickens with ruin up*
---
The games pretty toxic, but I will gladly go through that if it means Stranger Things in this game.
---
Could just be an animalistic/otherworldly fixation on her, something compelling him.
---
I'm just basing off of what is literally canon, and said in the movies. Ignoring the remakes.
---
So? I'm on console too
---
I got BBQ the moment I saw it no hesitation.
---
No one is angry,  I'm annoyed. Annoyed that all day yesterday I was matched with surviviors who couldn't complete a gen,  and a killer that just destroyed them. Just because someone cusses,  doesn't they are angry. So you take a fucking chill pill,  and quit trying to tell someone how to feel or speak when they are annoyed or ranting.
---
Yeah humanoid and human are two different things
---
WHY IS IT SO HARD TO GET MATCHED WITH OTHER SURVIVORS WHO ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE GENERATORS; YOU SEE ME BRING IN OBJECTIVE OFFERINGS YOU HOGS
---
Cringe is crying over a joke.  Youre as cringe as it gets.  Talks about toxicity while bringing arguments to a damn meme.
---
Again. I thought the meme was funny. You as a person are being toxic. Can't call somebody a man-child when you're the person resulting to name calling and insults.
---
Have you watched the movies though or are you picking off quotes from Loomis whose entire character is obsessively wanting Myers dead or locked up
---
He says as he uses the same format to tell us what to do.
---
Survivor Meta is a combination of any 4 of those? Also why Unbreakable- on paper it seems as though it wouldn‚Äôt be used too much?
---
Speaking of Hex Ruin, do you have any tips on locating totems? I swear I can never find them...
---
I‚Äôll take virtue signaling for 500 Alex.
---
What bbq the bottom one costs that for me but bbq didn‚Äôt
---
Typing in capital letters means you‚Äôre angry or at least shouting
---
Guessing. Due to the nature of rapid movement, pausing, rapid movement, repeat, movement of the nurse, a lot of nurse is predicting survivor routes. You can't teach this, but map knowledge, time played, and playing other killers indirectly help.
---
Name does not check out.
---
It‚Äôs much easier from here
---
I'm not bringing arguments to a meme. You were saying stuff that wasn't true in the comments. I never once said that Meme was bad or offended me. I thought the name was funny which I had said multiple times.
---
You're trying to misrepresent me when you're being the **man child** resulting to name-calling. Blatantly lying in the comment is different than a light-hearted meme. The meme was funny
---
He went from "no gg" to "gg." What is the problem?
---
It's why I hate prestiging my killers and don't see BBQ within the first 50 blood webs. It's like, come on, how else am I going to have fun grinding BP's with my party streamers and survivor puddings with no guidance to my next victim?
---
They are my favourite horror movies, so yes. If we're going by that logic, demigorgon has emotions, it's focused on eating people.
---
He need some milk
---
I find it hilarious that other commenters are ripping him apart what I said was what I personally seen on his streams and yet you choose to come at me and not them.  How pathetic.
---
Not really. Since you can't actually choose the places you can teleport to.
---
imagine using Self Care
---
Yeah if you want to grind I prefer killer since they get more bloodpoints than survivors easily and also use BBQ to increase the bloodpoints.
---
and hes also a very hansom gentleman
---
I said what I saw on his vids on youtube.  Cant say it aint true when its my personal experience of witnessing it.  Other people on this thread are actually ripping tru3 apart yet you choose me to try to discredit LMAO.  Get bent.
---
Just don't be a dumbass if you can't take people roasting you. Only rule survivors really need.
---
Me, too.
---
For the second perk, can you use the strike while being carried? Also I think the 3rd perk is a bit too OP. Sure killer‚Äôs have an advantage because of faster speed but with that perk survivors will win every battle to find the hatch and killers will have to rely on RNG to find it first. It‚Äôs better if it is RNG for both killer and survivor instead of only one.
---
I'm sure Stranger Things involved millions. Especially with it being as popular, and owned by Netflix. I would imagine they play big.
---
Lmao no. Tell me which one.
---
Glad people on Reddit use downvotes right, to downvote a genuine question. You get him level 1 like all the other killers
---
Mostly play survivor= survivor main
---
You're mixing up demidogs with the actual Demigorgon. Demigorgon is in NO WAY mindless. It intentionally spooked Will in the very first episode and toyed with him. It waits for opportune moments to strike. It can unlock doors with its mind.
---
Yeah...not sure where tf you're getting this thought from.
---
The Hag is a fucking Wendigo for crying out loud. Freddy is a dream demon. Demigorgon is an intelligent being from another dimension.
---
Is it worth it to spend 2000 for the blood points alone? I almost did it
---
Well I can tell you in his last 10 videos he hasn't called anyone a stream sniper Beyond one person who is factually stream sniping him.
---
I just went through and checked all of his uploads for this week. Skipping to the part where they destroyed ruin and most of the time he complained about it being gone too quickly or saying that he was unlucky
---
Ok thank you soo much I wanted the perk but I don‚Äôt think I have enough time to get it that why I asked thank you ;)
---
Actually trying to get my point across.
---
Mostly a rework to her add-ons, but they might also be tweaking the base kit
---
They should have a killer social lobby where killers can go to just hug each other.
---
Then they get called a tunneler for chasing people. Cycle never ends...
---
Sometimes survivors can just work really well with each other that it seems like they‚Äôre SWF when they‚Äôre not.
---
I remember when I asked a killer why he camped/tunnelled everyone.
---
"Casue your bad."
---
"So because you camped/tunnelled, i'm bad?"
---
"Yes, very bad."
---
^(Sure sounds like a survivor main.)
---
Nooooo
---
It‚Äôs because they have release garbage shrine perks for over a month now finally a top tier killer perk now I hope next time it‚Äôs a top tier survivor perk to balance things out.
---
That‚Äôs exactly his problem. He gets sniped more than other streamers because they can always rewatch the clip and laugh at him getting worked up. Dude needs to stop biting and giving them ammo.
---
Ah
---
This would've even more hilarious against Hag at end game with Hope. 107% vs 110% is antagonizing = half map chases in moonwalk.
---
I hope the Demogorgon mori is &gt;!how Bob died at the end of Season 2. Sorry not sorry Joyce.!&lt;
---
Ah yes, because a worse-freddy-gen-teleporter *Stealth Killer* is S tier, as we know Wraith and Pig are. And the two Killer perks we see here are god awful.
---
I love how his neck is the king of the crew, and also playing CS.
---
Yeah but I think that they should just be add ons... like one of them runs faster but only injures survivors and applies no deep wound effect and hitting any injured survivors end the power Like with the deep wound with normal legion. And one of them will not fast vault but runs faster, this theoretical add on would still allow vaulting pallets and it will be faster then normal but will be not as fast as normal and stuff like that.
---
We were not even that coordinated. The killer just chased me for like 2 minutes and 3 of the gens got done. Not my fault they focused on me.
---
Funny
---
Yeah. The problem is when he actually gets stream sniped he is acknowledging it. That's why they keep fucking with him.
---
I feel like they should really make it so after awhile you should be allowed to walk through someone who is clearly body blocking, like if they're idle in a position for a long time then the collision should be removed and you should just be allowed to run out. This would make it so Survivors can't be dicks and block their teammates and killers can't do this shit either.
---
If you can, you should get Bubba anyway. Lots of fun and it works well on ranks lower than 7
---
D√´m≈ìg√∏rg√∂√±
---
Might actually thank you
---
It's been a while since I watched Stranger Things, but isn't the Entity pretty similar to the big shadow tentacle monster in the show? The fog doesn't seem a far off concept from the upside-down either. And the Demigorgon in the show didn't really seem to have motivation in the sense of emotion, it's like an extension of the main brain. Like the Hivemind to the Flood in the Halo series.
---
Bbq was already in the shrine a few months ago...
---
You would be lying to say it's easier to maneuver first person on a controller compared to a mouse.
---
Drop the flashlight motherfucker!
---
Really? It‚Äôs not like you can do much to killers in DBD. They are all kind of terminators.
---
Dude makes piss poor content and comes off like a twat in most of his videos.
---
People think that downvoted are for disagreeing lmao
---
Hopper‚Äôs perk: Gun: Take out a gun and crosshairs appear, you have one chance to shoot the killer, successfully shooting the killer kills them.
---
Like that Adult Swim gummy bear animation.
---
I find whenever people suggest xenomorphs as killer to be unrealistic to either the game‚Äôs lore or movie‚Äôs lore but adding Ellen would be amazing
---
Yeah but he‚Äôs more Si fi then horror and yes stranger things is quite si fi but it had a lot of horror elements plus what would his power and weapon be? A gun would be hard to balance in this game and death garden had guns already in it so
---
Try out hillbilly, he‚Äôs a fast killer and can get around the map fast with his chainsaw
---
Make better jokes
---
Filthy Legion main here. I felt this post.
---
What you said was false. You just don‚Äôt like being called out on it.
---
I need to get better at the game first
---
I agree Monto does but to a lesser extend. He'll occasionally berate himself too whereas whenever tru is talking his opinions are always "matter of fact" and that everyone who disagrees with him is wrong.
---
Again, its my personal experience of seeing mang vids where it happens.  And not someone he previously encountered 80% of the time.  Also why arent you "fact checking" these other commenters?  Who actually rip into him lmao
---
One tip is to not swing your bone saw after blinks unless you are 101% sure it will connect, otherwise, you get stunned longer and survivors will gain distance
---
Racist and toxic now I‚Äôve seen them all
---
Only because of some asshole squatting on the copyright and lashing out on the F13th devs. Judges don‚Äôt even want to rule on that shit because it sets a bad precedent. Copyright law was a mistake
---
They ask you how you are, and you just have to say that you're fine, when you're not really fine, but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.
---
Not really.  You cant say my personal experience of witnessing something is false.  Nice try tho.
---
Same, but most seem to wanna.
---
First time I've ever seen it in the shrine
---
The real elephant in the room is the build I'm running.
---
Literally just used up all my shards before the shrine. Feels bad man :‚Äô(
---
They‚Äôll be back at daylight
---
On the second perk, no. Other wise it would just be DS in my opinion. For the 3rd, how about instead of revealing the aura you get an arrow pointing to where the general location is for a few seconds?
---
I used to think the same but I think the addition of the Demogorgon kinda thows that out of the window.
---
Just send this to Devs, trust me they don't tolerate toxic shit, find a mod on twitter and DM them, they always listen
---
Yes. Unbreakable can give you another chance in a situation where you were slugged and no one is able to save you. As for locating totems, you might want to run a perk called small game until you learn the spawns of the totems.
---
EVEN WORSE WHEN YOU SEE ALL 3 ON ONE GEN
---
Well yeah it‚Äôs been there twice before this. Second time was like 4 or 5 months ago and 1st time was a very long time ago
---
even if i have tier 1 of borrowed time on someone? it still won't appear in that characters bloodweb?
---
You know Bubba isn't gonna cook them himself. Gotta get Cook.
---
When you bought bubba dlc and leveled him up just for BBQ just to see it in the shrine of secrets.
---
This is crazy accurate I‚Äôve been playing around with survivors all evening. They are quite the jittery bunch.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
But how could a grasshopper use a gun?
---
Oh totally the irony is not lost on me.  It's pretty rich.
---
Get hag first. Spirit is more op, but hag has two of the best teachables for killer
---
Nope. He's "saving shards for if he wants a perk next week"
---
I recommend to all new players at the core of this game it can be heart dropping, spine chilling, and down near unforgiving but in a good way, the game is incredibly fun especially when playing with friends however like op said we do have a toxicy problem which is why I recommend turning your messages to friends only if you‚Äôre on console don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs handled on pc but yes you‚Äôll meet cool people but many will be negative especially to new players trying to figure out the game
---
Impossible.
---
Hag for ruin, spirit is easy to play and just basically an easy win card. Either one is fine
---
The Pigs backstory is Amanda‚Äôs story. What more expanding could they do for her?
---
Scrap Self Care and go for Bond. It's a lot more efficient than Self Care and gets you a lot more than just heals as well.
---
What if Jane was even thiccer
---
Toxic people defy logic, my dude. We should all be excited about new players, but some people are just nasty and there's no way around it. We have an unfortunate concentration of them.
---
When did I say that? I SAID Spirit is easy to play, I never said Spirit is easier on controller.
---
If we get someone from the walking dead it better be a Negan survivor
---
I guess then I would have problems figuring out a power. Would facehuggers be involved? How does acid blood work for stuff like pallet stuns and DS? Xenomorphs can climb on ceilings but can‚Äôt in DBD? Too complex of a creature for me to figure out how it works
---
So Nancy can possibly outrun Michael
---
Don't let toxic people get you down. You'll find people you enjoy playing with. Plenty of folks willing to give you pointers in post game lobbies.
---
BRO THAT FIRST PART HAPPENED TO ME TODAY, IT WAS A HAG BUT NEA STARTED URBAN EVADING FROM REALLY FAR AWAY WHERE FOR SURE THERE WEREN‚ÄôT ANY TRAPS, KEEP IN MIND HAG PUT ALL HER TRAPS AROUND ME BECAUSE I DIDN‚ÄôT FALL FOR HER BAMBOOZLES. SO NEA TAKES THE TIME TO URBAN EVADE THAT DISTANCE, I GO INTO STAGE 2, ONCE SHE UNHOOKS SHE SPRINTS AT FULL SPEED ACTIVATING ALL THE TRAPS, SHE WAS RANK 14.
---
For some maybe, like the Wraith and the Plague, but others obviously have no quams with doing what they do. Ghostface, Freddy, and the Pig (kinda), all welcomed the idea of torturing and slaughtering people for eternity, and I'm pretty sure the Doctor called the Entity first to see if he was hiring.
---
Sure, other killers are definitely NOT fans of what they're doing (the Spirit, the Wraith, the Plague, and the Legion (with the exception of Frank, I would think), come to mind), and a lot of them are pretty indifferent towards it (Trapper, Hillbilly, Hag, Clown, Huntress, etc.), but it's not like the Entity is *required* to put in the effort to force the Killers to do its bidding.
---
You‚Äôd have a hard time trying to convince me negan is killer tier. Nothing he does is really worse than rick
---
So you mean camping
---
Now that hits home
---
Huh? Can you hit me with a link?
---
I'll be frank with you...I may have already made a killer concept for the xenomorph before doing Ripleys lol.
---
Since survs don‚Äôt like it
---
Sounds good, I'll try out Unbreakable!
---
Small Game looks awesome for me lmao. I'm definitely going to use it for now. I'll try looking up totem spawns too, thanks so much for the help!
---
The timer only starts once a door is opened so the survivors can finish the gens then 99% the door and farm with you.
---
Playing new it‚Äôs better honestly that they depend more on themselves for getting healed than others. No point in wasting two peoples time to get healed when they could be running the killer or be on a gen instead. Also in the situations where a games going south and your teams twindling depending on them for heals can be a literal death sentence. The amount of times I‚Äôve made an otherwise impossible save or escape due to myself healing when my teammates were dead or busy or hooked is far too great to pass it up especially for a newer player.
---
You know some of us have lives and other obligations and prefer to spend bloodpoints on killers we actually intend on using.
---
This post just makes you sound like the whiney little bitch you seem to dislike. You're literally bitching about people being happy that they don't have to farm hundreds of thousands of bloodpoints. 
---
So maybe you should stop crying like a little bitch over something that doesn't affect you in the slightest. And let people just enjoy the game
---
He killed Glenn I think that's more than enough to justify him as a killer.
---
Its *humanoid*
---
To be fair, getting chased by her is boring as hell too because they end so fast. Really no counters to a decent nurse because they‚Äôll just predict everything you do.
---
Well I asked more for visual ideas and not what would their stats be. I appreciate the memes though!
---
