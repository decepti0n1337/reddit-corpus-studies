The main problem with all these “killer disguised as a survivor” ideas is that it would be hard countered %100 of the time by the existence of SWF
---
---
---
"hey son its 8, time for bed"
---
It’s not 200 IQ by the pig at all. Doing this is extremely easy. All you do is crouch and body lock the trap and since crouch mode doesn’t stop the timer there’s nothing the survivor can do. I play pig and I’ve done this to people that ruin the game for their team
---
I hope whoever did this realizes they're part of the problem. I hope. But I know they clearly don't give a shit.
---
Oh dear
---
Well dead hard won't matter since you'd have to be injured and I believe same as MoM less it's been changed.
---
ANYONE ELSE ACTUALLY HAVING A SENSE OF FUCKING FEAR OF DEMOGORGON? I HAVEN’T BEEN SCARED FOR THE PAST YEAR AND FIRST GAME VS THIS ABOMINATION MY HEART IS LITERALLY RACING DAMN IT
---
yes, and the Servers need to run first before they stop lol.
---

---
They get released in about 2 weeks
---
Such a tired post.
---
a dirt clod blending into her natural environment!
---
YEP.  IT DRIVES ME FUCKING NUTS, BECAUSE I USUALLY HAVE SPINE CHILL OR PREMONITION AND I *KNOW* THE KILLER IS COMING, BUT THEY WON'T STOP TRYING TO HEAL ME EVEN WHEN I RUN.  
---
YESTERDAY, I HAD SOMEONE FUCKING STOP ME TO HEAL WHILE WE WERE LITERALLY BEING CHASED.
---
Technically the Freddy one is cannon so may be intentional
---
Cool.
---
But then he has tombstone
---
what if you get a 4 man Premade team? the Killer would be useless
---
Her main ability which is RBT barely works and doesn't really apply gen pressure. Its similar to legion, forcing survivors to go out of their way to do something. And her dash is very situational and only works on unsafe pallet loops which good survivors wont try to loop around. Her crouch is the only good thing about her
---
Get hooked, use deliverence, then ur injured
---
Buenas, compadre!
---
No, but she rigged a lot of the traps so that people would die anyway and there was no way to escape.
---
Ive evolved
---
Both of the healing survivor perks are good imo, though nancys is probably more consistent. Camaraderie is good against camping or patrolling killers though if the killer isn’t doing that, it’s kind of pointless. Fixated is cool but sometimes the scratch marks don’t show up even when I’m running. Baby sitter from Steve is eh, and definitely not better than borrow time. The killer perks are niche but you can find some value in all of them.

Yes, this is the real hype for next chapter
---
Holy shit!
---
People are saying is a scummy move because of reasons.
---
God, this video never stops being funny.
---
yep! i mentioned survivor possession before. its the neatest idea i could come up with for something different
---
nah the juking was Mediocre lol, he was complaining that he was gen rushed when all he did was camp Huntress Lullaby and not protect gens..
---
Why
---
&gt;two gens coincidentally completed in a short span of one another
---
"oH mY gOd gEn RuShErS"
---
They would be frowning and like “just die already”
---
Fuck You bhvr!!! Nothing but a bunch of lying cunts!!!
---
I don't get it. Is the subreddit full of memes that start with the line "Nobody:", and is what really is the point of that?
---
&gt; Cruel Confinement
---
WE WOULDN'T WANT A PERK FROM A SCARY HORROR GAME TO BE TOO SCAARRRRYYYY
---
The thing is, how is realying on randoms while having to sneak, which is really slow mind you, any more fun? 
---
Its not, what if survivors are super far away, then you have to sneak around the whole map at a super slow pace doing nothing, which is also not fun. And then they might not even help you in the first place. 
---
There is flaws with your idea as well. And please, don't insult me cause i dont think your idea is much better
---

Hold off for the steam sales the bundles go on sale regularly, and just grab them at a cheaper price. Alternatively you can also save your shards, and buy them in game that way if you want specific characters until said sales pop up.
---
Well, you got me.
---
By all accounts, it just doesn't make any sense.
---
Yep, that’s the sum of this video clip.
---
He's just sending Steve to the Upside Down is all its apart of his power!
---
You guys can play games as killer?
---
They could just make a new character named KG and give him to everyone that had the nightmare pack unlocked.  Make him look like he should and not like Gollum and give him slightly better versions of Quentin perks
---
I’ve only played against him (mainly play survivor) and I can’t see how anyone could possibly argue that he needs a nerf. He seems perfectly balanced from a survivor perspective. As soon as I got some red rank killers on PTB you really see his full potential and map pressure. I saw a couple of people use make your choice on him and it worked great.
---
Made me a bit nervous for my Trapper too. I guess I'll walk with traps on me as much as I can to deny loops but there's nowhere to really hide them.
---
Pre-change Dying Light encouraged tunneling but it was good at slowing the game down if you got the kill quick enough.
---
Now it works in the complete opposite way, you're better off ignoring your obsession altogether.
---
Oh no, he's been blocked by some ineloquent fart-sniffer on reddit. You have truly bested him. How ever will he recover from this indignation?
---
#Steve
---
**Babysitter** - More commonly known as Make Your Choice bait. Bad. Just run Borrowed Time instead.
---
**Cuckradarie** - Useless 99% of the time. Now that Left Behind is being buffed it's the most useless perk in the game by far.
---
**Second Wind** - Great for the "Self Care wastes time" types but the healing requirement kinda hinders it akin to Deliverance. If you can get it to go off though it really saves time.
---
#Nancy
---
**Better Together** - Do you have Prove Thyself? No? Well I guess inverse Kindred is okay. Gen jockeys will run it. Good to team up with others with Kindred, or keep Survivors away while they're being chased and you do a gen.
---
**Fixated** - Honestly one of the strongest Survivor perks they've released in awhile, simply because it lets you move faster while still being stealthy. Being able to see scratch marks is also cool but the biggest asset is being able to Urban Evasion at 90% speed.
---
**Inner Strength** - Massively overrated. Almost everyone I've seen running it on the PTB has done terribly as a result. It's only good if one person is running it and even then it's bad because you have 5 charges of the perk which can be "stolen" by your allies just doing their job. In a SWF it can be extremely strong but I think the "speed boost" from Inner Strength's heal is worse than just running Self Care.
---
#Demo
---
**Surge** - Massively overrated, especially with the PTB nerf when compared to the prerelease. You will hardly ever affect more than one gen with this perk and as soon as Survivors realize you have it they'll play smart and loop you away from gens. (Like they should anyways.)
---
**Cruel Confinement** - God tier on instadown Killers. Also great against cocky gen rushers who do a gen right in front of your face.
---
**Mindbreaker** - Pausing Exhaustion is far stronger than the 3 seconds of Exhaustion, but they're both really good. Particularly strong on Stealth Killers like Pig, Wraith, and particularly Ghostface (very good on Ghostface since he can instadown so people don't just wait 3 seconds mid chase to get Exhaustion back)
---
I get called a tunneler after a 3k. I'll never understand the salt that survivors have.
---
To be faaaaaiiiiiir ♫
---
With 9 new perks being released next, not using BBQ right now is just dumb.
---
Also from rank 8 down (up??...to rank 1.) BBQ and ruin are standard. That's why people don't like ranking up. Not necessarily because it's 'difficult', but because it's stale. Facing the exact same killer and perks, and being forced to use the exact same perks in order to counter said perks.
---
Damn they really did listen to reddit killers and make ruin last the entire game /s
---
Bill is either Atruistic as hell and can/will sacrifice himself for the team with clutch Borrowed Time saves...
---
Or he’s just a new player who used to play Left 4 Dead, and dies first.
---
I thought that was the other guy making her do that
---
Found the Gladiator main
---
It’s... a horror game wtf?
---
what?
---
I main GhostFace and Ive gotten good enough, and with the right addons, to play in reds
---
reee
---
Demo is fucking best dad the fuck?
---
what hits when what goes through?
---
yeah dawg
---
Between the crouch and the traps forcing people to get off of gens, I think she's very good once you learn how to use her. I feel she's very underrated.
---
May be a bit off topic but can agree the demogorgon has the best icon also clown is  daddy and you can't change my mind
---
I mean, not "useless".  A possesed survivor isn't working on generators or doing anything useful, but they also can't be saved as easily like a hooked survivor.  But you're mostly right, that would make it a lot less effective...
---
Majority of killer mains on this sub lul
---
for def agree on that. it completly makes no sense to just "mend" a wound. bitch you need BANDAGES
---
Im afraid snares are superior by a long shoot
---
Replace plague with anyone else
---
I BOUGHT ENDURING AND URBAN BEFORE I KNEW THE PTB WAS OUT AND NOW I CANT BUY NEW SURVIVORS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
They do, the set up of perks and add-ons I just listed is one of the most cancer builds out there. On a map like game if the doctor stands in the center all survivors would tier up from just the shock radius
---
So you insult people who disagree with you, I think your the stupid one here. 
---
Your idea does NOT make it any better, if anything its worse. You can't see survivor auras, thus you could be walking around the entire map 3 times over just to find someone to mend you, and what if everyone is mended then you might all just be screwed. 
---
Mending right away is the ENTIRE POINT OF IT. Its meant to STALL the god damn game out, and if you don't have to do it you get a plague issue coming. 
---
So no, your idea is not better because you say it is, because its honestly not. Your idea will also bring more problems.
---
No point in removing the aura reading when you can’t even get the perk to activate in the first place.
---
Can we stop throwing the word genrush around? Holy shit sometimes you have to commit to a gen so it can be done and doesn’t get regressed, nothing cocky about it, just you being butthurt lol
---
Probably because u were claudette and the killer could see you because of the pallette. That's why you were scared xD
---
Very nice :)
---
Doctor is a great Killer since his power is very versatile and he can work with just about any perk. The only thing I would say you really don't need is close range detection (IE Whispers, Spies in the Shadows, etc.)
---
Distressing is always good but tbh I've come to dislike it since it makes Survivors scream faster which indirectly makes it harder to get to them. Long-ranged detection (Surveillance, Discordance, and of course BBQ) is great cause when you get close they just scream. Distressing is obviously very good with other Terror Radius perks like Unnerving and Coloraphobia. Doctor is probably the only Killer who can actually capitalize on Unnerving due to the random location of the skill checks, and Coloraphobia can really fuck with Survivors.
---
I personally **LOVE** Save the Best for Last on Doctor. Doctor is one of the Killers who can actively ignore their Obsession, since you can just zap your Obsession to Tier 3 and then leave them alone. In addition you find Survivors very fast which makes getting stacks for STB4L very easy.
---
The build I have currently on my P3 Doctor is ye ol' Distressing + Ruin + BBQ and also Brutal Strength since I tend to do a lot of pallet munching. (Brutal is also good on Doc since he can force early pallet drops.) I think if I went for a more "tryhard" build I'd probably swap Distressing out for STB, and BBQ out for "tryhard BBQ" IE Thrilling Tremors.
---
Also if you want to be a colossal dick you can run the "fuck your generators" build of Ruin, Discordance, Overcharge, and either Surveillance or Unnerving Presence. Three gen Doc is an exercise in insanity as it's just a massive test to see who's going to quit out of shear boredom first: The Survivors or the Killer.
---
~~Also suit "Therapist" Doctor is best Doctor. Halloween is overrated, though Victorian is alright. Plague Doctor is bad don't @ me.~~
---
Yes, most of the time that is
---
That was almost some really good teamwork on their behalf, if only you got blinded
---
Always respect baby killers or people who had a rough day, no matter how shitty they played
---
Not going to lie, I tend the think like that for a bit, then I switch tactics like patrol gens constantly, do some slugging, or apply the 3Gen Strat. It sucks but it’s time to plan the next move !
---
I think either the devs need to consider the instaheals as broken or let all items and offerings to be free in the PTB. Theres not a lot of use testing a new survivor or killer when I literally cant even get them to level 20 in the day I get the chance to play. Everything should be unlocked and balanced around that imo. Of course everyone will just run meta builds but thats pretty much the state of the game right now anyway.
---
depends, watch people like n0ob_3 and otzdara bc its really a decision you have to make for yourself. sorry for no straight answer
---
Doubt it. There have been rumours but seeing as the PTB gave me points from an earlier level (not my current number of points) it seems the PTB runs on a different version to the main game.
---
And BHVR has stated in interviews that the DLC will probably cost about $11.
---
Shock me doc daddy
---
Yes it is definitely worth it
---
So if support for this game ever stops like if a second game comes out. I can still play with other without servers on consoles?
---
Vigo or something made the hatch tho right.
---
Agreed
---
Yes you can blind the eyeless beast that is the demogorgon
---
Had same thing happen to me as killer, and I was angry. Game was vs people who were 10 ranks higher then me too. Don't know what caused it
---
Waaaaaaaan I can't counter the two most used perks in the gaaaaame BHVR so Killer-sided plz nerf!
---
probably not once the Servers get released, but the devs said they Support this game for at least 5 more years
---
In this 20 second clip you just see the pig blocking one box to survivors, for all we know she could have been doing normal killer things and stalking the gen that was being worked on near that box when she heard the beeps and went to block the box.
---
Unless it was the last box, which the Pig could not have known, the survivors could have just gone to another jigsaw box. The survivor in this video is literally following the Pig around, and the Pig doesn't know how much time you have left on the RBTs. Although I guess you could argue they heard the rapid beeping in this case.
---
If anything, them blocking the Jigsaw box 99% of the time wouldn't work out for them since it forfeits complete pressure on gens just so you can force a survivor to go to another box. This case just happened to work out for them and makes for an interesting strat for an already pretty weak killer.
---
I really don't see what is so bad about this video. If anything, I would have had a good laugh about with the pig in end game chat as a survivor.
---
Shit ill sacrifice myself to get another 25%
---
I can still play with other without servers on consoles?
---
agreed if we can get my breathing problem t3 boi into top column.
---
What makes you feel that way?
---
I haven't seen a single MoM ever since they nerfed it to the ground.
---
Shi No Numa DBD
---
None of them other than the big three. :)
---
Just look at tier lists and play high tier Killers that you like. The higher tier they are the better they are at all ranks. There are some exceptions (Killers like Leatherface are very good at low ranks) but if a Killer is good at high ranks they'll be good at low ranks.

Don‘t care what survivors say...reddit is all in all for killer mains
---
Yea I agree. They should change it so it becomes more like we're gonna live forever. So u also get stacks for a save unhook.
---
In ST lore the demogorgon tries to avoid all light and lies in darkness. A bright light right to its skin would disorient it
---
aww i love doge steve &lt;3
---
Really I see it as a neutral view cus i play both but is the community bias towards killers in Anyway?
---
I've had this happen to me on console multiple times now and i can lose up to like a minuet while the figures out what is up
---
You also don't lose STBFL tokens if you hit the obsession with it. Note: if you don't charge the full attack and don't lunge but hit the survivor instantly you'll loose your tokens
---
I like it. I'm a rank 5 survivor main. I think it's great as it gives killers a comeback chance if they are struggling. I would change it though. My idea is that you see that you get exposed when the last gen pops, and once someone gets hit, the totem is revealed to everyone
---
we're not too asshole-ish
---
just really cocky
---
but like how does he see things tho
---
Yeah I’m at rank 4 on killer now and that would’ve pissed me off if it had happened on killer side. It’s never happened to me before so I didn’t know if it was something new or what
---
light burn is an in-game mechanic whether you got eyes or not
---
Why is it good?
---
XD Yeah, Devour Hope was extremely popular the first day of PTB, but I haven't really seen it on the second day when they broke out Stranger Things.
---
No problem!
---
Hiding a locker now protects you from aura reading, but also inflicts Blindness (so you cannot see auras either,probably to prevent cheesing OoO). So if you suspect the killer has BBQ, you can go into a locker when a survivor is downed/picked up to hide from it.
---
Yup, at around 5pm EDT I think.
---
Or slam gens and let the killer depip.
---
It’s more on how the game will be perceived by the general audience. Think of it this way, the new DLC is going to attract new players into the game. The last thing Behavior wants is to associate a perk with real-life events that involve solitary confinement and abuse when people look it up on Google. They made the right call in trying to distance from that, so that they wouldn’t face any backlash if any opinions arise from it. Although, we can all agree that the new name change for the perk is extremely lackluster.
---
You really didn't need to do that, I was aware of the oversaturation after I posted.
---
[removed]
---
Seriously,  it's like nobody on reddit knows how to use the search button anymore.
---
Your mending idea would make deep wounds useless as shit. Harder to see vision? Any survivor could play around that: Look at plague. 
---
Your insulting me because i disagree with you and can point out flaws, but your the one refusing to accept them and say  no no my idea is good. 
---
Having only able to mend you is fine, but with it only giving a vision debuff no body would EVER do it and it would just be a repeat of plague, thus it would be pointless to exsit.
---
I’M A KILLER MAIN WHO JUST STARTED TRYING OUT SURVIVOR AND OH MY FUCKING GOD I FINALLY REALIZE THE FRUSTRATION IF NOED IM SO SORRY EVERYONE
---
I don't use it as a killer because I rather have 4 useful perks (tracking or chase perks) and end my games before all gens get repaired, which usually is the case. 
---
I don't mind it as a survivor because in 90% of the maps totems are too easy to destroy and it means a killer playing with 3 perks throughout the match, causing an easier time holding him longer in a chase.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Eat steves ass.
---
This is a game where people are literally put on meathooks and moried in terrible ways, a name of a real life practice is not going to put anyone off
---
That moment when you're such shit that you can't even facecamp with Leatherface.
---
That's when you know you're playing the wrong role.
---
Yeah, and damn that looked laggy as hell.
---
Can we stop throwing the word butthurt around? Holy shit sometimes you have to use strong language to get a point across, nothing toxic about it, just you being butthurt lol
---
i kinda wish they would do that with laurie, not that laurie is ugly i just really would like jamie lee curtis's likeness
---
Are the huntress shots still as laggy as the last servers?
---
You realize that line is from the scene in the picture and not from a YouTuber, right?
---
Nicely done, dude XD
---
I'm not kidding though lol
---
I get the same msg (almost) every time I shut my computer down after playing DbD.
---
I have *NEVER* altered any files on any of the games I have (except for RoR2 for the Lunar Tokens).
---
You guys have DBD installed?
---
What's a nail gun to a riot shield and an Uzi?

It's ok I have borrowed time. Run. You should've been running decisive strike.

---
I WANTED TO PLAY JUMPSCARE MYERS, BUT EVERY TIME SOME ASSHOLE SURVIVOR ALSO TAKES AN OFFERING ON A MAP AND GUESS WHAT I TRIED THIS A COUPLE TIMES AND FUCKING ALWAYS THE GAME PICKED THE SURVIVOR MAP, AND I LOST ALL OF MY ADD-ONS AND OFFERINGS, WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK ?!
---
NEXT, I SAID ENOUGH SO I DECIDED TO PLAY AS HILLBILLY AND GUESS WHAT ? 
---
I GET THE FUCKING LARY'S MAP (1 KILL COS I WAS JUST A PATHETIC M1 KILLER) !!!
---
THAT WAS MY MOST PAINFUL 5 DC'S IN MY ENTIRE LIFE COS I LOST FUCK TON OF PROGRESS   
---
IN MY FINAL GAME I PLAYED AS PIG ON A OPEN MAP (STEALTH BASED KILLER AND OPEN MAP THAT'S JUST FUCKING GREAT), AND I GOT A WHOLE TEAM OF 4 SUPER ANNOYING TEABAGGING INSTAHEAL RUSSIANS WITH FLASHLIGHTS, BUT I WAS SO PISSED AT THAT MOMENT THAT I TOOK EBONY MORI AND KILLED THEM ALL ON A FIRST HOOK, AND THEIR SALT AND TEARS WERE DELICIOUS, ANYWAY THIS GAME IS BULLSHIT IM UNINSTALLING.
---
Read the bottom of it, don't just see "Xenomorph" and say, "OP didn't look at what others have done."
---
&gt;Are the huntress shots still as laggy as the last servers?
---
They feel... slightly better. Maybe they are the same and I am just unable to tell because I am starting to get used to having 60ms. I've played A LOT of huntress during these PTBs with server enabled and I also missed the day where they deactivated them. Its been a while since I played with 0ms.
---
dude, you draw this yourself? it's great!
---
Why?
---
I mean...isn't this the point of PTB? To find bugs before release?
---
He's more like the loyal pet
---
Most default players have decent teachables.
---
The only change they can make to Billy that'd help make him not op without fully gutting his ass is a capped camera rotation while charging saw so his weak spot (riding his dick) is further emphasized and forces him into M1 instead of this jank saw hit while facing the opposite direction.
---
dont mind it and rarely use it. Thats all
---
Tell him to share his bloodpoints with the other players. No one in his matches should make more or less. Bet he won't do it.
---
It's been putting me in games with rank 2 - 6 for over a week and I just started.
---
He is extremely sensitive to light, so we can make that head canon work, but this is something the devs will need to keep in mind if they decide to make more non humanoid killers.
---
I play half and half killer/ survivor. I don't really get why noed gets so much hate.
---
At its heart, Noed is just a momentum perk like most of the exposed status effect mechanics. Haunted Grounds gives you momentum at the beginning, typically when people are looking for ruin. Devour hope let's you speed through the middle-game where you have a few hooks but most survivors are still 1-2 hooks from death. Noed on the other hand, gives you a (admittadly pretty large) momentum boost during the endgame. 
---
 My best guess on why Noed is so hated is because it happens at endgame. It's frusturating to think that you have the edge only to have the game turn around so close to the finish. And honestly, I would be all for calling it a bullshit mechanic if there wasn't any risk or counterplay, but there is. 
---
Putting a full perk slot into an endgame play is a huge risk that might not pay off even if you catch a healthy survivor with the instadown. The risk increases even more if you devote more endgame perks (blood warden, etc) into trying to capitalize the hardest on the noed down. And even if you pull it off, you pretty much are guaranteed no medal on the Gen Protector so it makes pipping very difficult. Not to mention that you get almost no value out of the perk if survivors just cleanse totems, and they are adding a new (strong) survivor perk to further incentivize cleansing dull totems.
---
True it’s very intense not knowing if they have noed unless u get fucked by it as you try to open the gate but yea personally I think knowing Bertie would be bette but I wouldn’t consider revealing the location cus then that’d be unfair :/ as much as I hate coming against noed
---
Upvoting because I want to know as well
---
Yeah
---
Demodaddy literally eats your ass how is he not best daddy
---
I wish you could have ur theme set to whatever you want and fir example I would 100% have spirit's music playing lol
---
This was definitely pitched by Eli Roth.
---
Mark this as spoiler
---
if a portal is invisible and a survivors stands ON it, can they see it?
---
Because they were rigged to where it didn't matter if you opened the locks or solved the trap anyways. 🤷‍♂️
---
I'm an Ash main and honestly yeah I'm pretty toxic
---
It's sad that such a small mind can't be bothered looking at the original post. Deep Wounds for Legion would affect the terror radius, it's more than just vision issues. Even then, the core of your argument is stupid as fuck. "No stalking, we already have a stalking killer; no teleporting, we already got a teleporting killer; no vision impairment, we already got a vision impairing killer." This is essentially the line of logic that you decided to accept through huge generalizations. You can have killers that share certain aspects. Legion wouldn't be puking on items, survivors aren't going to fountains for legion, survivors aren't poisoning others with deep wounds; it would be taking aspects of stealth and vision impairment and putting them into a killer. The point is that deep wounds isn't this overwhelmingly oppressive ailment, but instead a mild disadvantage that becomes more problematic the more survivors have it. I'm not 'refusing to accept your points' because they're incredibly idiotic 'counterpoints'.
---
Nobody knows, when the devs say it, we will know
---
I was just asking for a friend,and I didn't learned that yet you didn't need to be that rude ;-;
---
Ok but doesnt that screw you out of bloodpoints too?
---
you ever just start laughing from how nervous you are
---
Same with pretty much every killer release

All i got were results for a wrestler.
---
I've been playing killer for less than 100 hours. I used it on my first games to make up for lack of skill, but as I got better I started to ditch it.
---
As a survivor, I think that with the recent changes to totem cleansing points and the upcoming inner strength perk, people are going to cleanse like crazy, so it will get used less often.
---
I thought it was implied in the show that they go off of thermal-like detection, as well as smell.
---
The cast time is alittle slow. This needs a buff.
---
overgrown egg chicken flower head thing
---
I'm done arguging with you. Your a person who refuses to bother to look at some potetinal flaws with your idea and then go to just insult people instead.
---
Still wouldn't use it, it got gutted.
---
Yeah wow. Thanks for that
---
Interesting axe placement.
---
Jk love the art!
---
I'm a bit iffy on it.
---
As a killer, I feel like it doesn't promote growth as a killer since it's mostly for killers that can't...well, kill that is or catch survivors.
---
As a survivor, I find it annoying, but I can understand it cause survivors are a bit strong(especially as ranks go up).
---
I kind of want it to be reworked, something to fit its theme still while still being a totem:
---
&gt; Survivors that will die on their next hook are exposed and you gain 8% Haste in chases with those who are exposed.
---
The only downside to this suddenly thought up change is if a killer can't even get 2 hooks on a single survivor, which to me is a whole different problem related to the skill of the killer, the map, etc.
---
It's a very interesting perk that I don't know how they'd rework it or if they ever will or if it even needs it.
---
So let me see if I understood correctly.
---
You never play trapper outside of doing dailies, which means you don't understand his weaknesses and strengths but you feel knowledgeable enough to suggest buffs? 
---
There are no invisible portals. They look like mounds of roots
---
It is a lot of fun. The dlc is great and a lot of it you can buy with in game currency.  If you play on console there is a special edition game that comes with some free dlc. Doctor, huntress and hag for killers and their survivors. This community can be really salty and sensitive so LOTS of us will try to tell you how to play. Lol! Play how you want and enjoy. 
---
You might want to check out a couple of streamers to get an idea if you like it. I would recommend fungoose, oh Tofu, Puppers and Monto. No0b3 is pretty good too. Good luck out there and fun!
---
No, he really doesn’t, if you know how to play him well, he can be really strong.
---
“ leave no dwarf behind!”
---
why not "cruel containment" then
---
THE ANSWER IS NOT AT ALL, NOED HAS A COUNTER BUT NOW WE CAN RUN IRON MAIDEN SO IT BALANCES OUT
---
I'm biased but I think there are a lot of good Jake players (most seem to have a shaved head and/or leather). The other day, I played with a very altruistic Jake who was also just very good at evading the killer in general.
---
Edit. Forgot to mention Feng. I've seen quite a lot that are really good with loops
---
Everyone is talking about Laurie and Quentin meanwhile Claudette looks like a spooked fish.
---
Toxic diaper baby
---
Not so much a nerf as much as a rework because the majority of Gorgons I've been playing with have been face camping, the shred has been hitting people around corners, and the portals have been used a lot to find and desperately defend gen clusters, ruin, and the basement before a single generator has been touched. The perks are cool, but in general the Demogorgon has been OP.
---
all I see is fucked up shit that fits the game about fucked up shit
---
Lol @ the watermark.
---
I watch every video he puts out, AND YET, that line is still from the scene in the picture and not from a YouTuber
---
He’s a survivor main as well
---
Me too :)
---
kate's way of saying we should see other people
---
He died to collapse
---
Wow they literally stole your meme and just slapped their own watermark on it. Fuck you u/sp00kyjeff. 
---
Edit: wow they steal shit tons of memes, water mark it, take the credit, and upload it to Instagram. Honestly fuck you OP
---

---
Would strait up pay thirty for Briscoe County skin.
---
ADEPTS ARE NOT "BROKEN" ON KILLERS. THEY JUST REQUIRE A DOUBLE PIP, WHICH ALBEIT IS PRETTY DAMN HARD ON ANYTHING RANK BETTER THAN 15. BUT DON'T USE THE TERM BROKEN UNLESS THE TROPHY IS ACTUALLY NOT POPPING WHEN IT SHOULD.
---
Puffy shirt skin.
---
So the survivors know the portals are there, but cant seal them til the demo uses them? Like hag traps?
---
YOOOO Dwight look creepy with the red stain in his eye
---
Bad ping hits
---
No, I’ve played my fair share of killer and as Trapper. Mind you, about 3,000 hours of game time. I only play Trapper for dailies NOW at this point because I find him to be weak. Regardless of whether I’m a survivor main or not, you can still know what a killer’s strength and weaknesses are. I feel survivors have a better understanding of these things sometimes anyway.
---
Well freddy can stretch his arms so canon hit box there.
---
Honestly I’ve always seen the perk as a band aid fix to many killers to just not being good enough
---
I’d love to get that because I’m a Doc main.
---
Litterally any toxic survivor when the killer has a survivor:
---
Feel exactly like that because canceling should have a slight cooldown like every other ability plus allow survivors to get a vault if you cancel instead of getting smacked if you're far away enough for a M1
---
I see people making legitimate suggestions about his lunge. At the end of the day the PTB is there to offer suggestions and make tweaks to all the new content, people complaining saying "No keep it exactly the same you entitled survivor mains!!@!#@" don't seem to understand the point of the PTB.
---
From what I personally noticed, his lunge can possibly be tweaked to benefit both survivors and him, for one, make the hitbox a little wider I've seen him literally jump on top of survivors and not even hit them, people are also suggesting some slight punishment for spamming it, since as of now he has practically no cooldown on missing unless he hits a wall.
---
The last PTB with Ghostface was horrible for this kind of outcry, the number of people who cried and cried (including 1 notable streamer/fog whisperer) that he was surprisingly getting tweaked right out of the PTB and saying it's going to destroy him, when it literally did nothing to his effectiveness at all was one of the most infuriating things to witness. With the exception of Legion who literally had issues in being brokenly OP unfun and turned to being made into a low tier killer, every other killer change was for the better in my opinion since Clown, and while Clown might be a victim of the general game structure; Spirit, Plague, Ghost Face, new Freddy, and currently the Demogorgon are all solid killers.
---
How so? I mean, aside from good trap placement, he’s just an M1 killer. The time it takes to set up traps and place them where you want is silly 3 years into the game. He’s very much still a 2016 DbD killer.
---
SHIT I APOLOGIZE, BUT POINT IS THAT ITS HARD AS FUCK, ESPECIALLY WITH MYERS. LIKE WHAT THE FUCK 2 OF YOUR PERKS ONLY WORK WITH OBESSESION ALIVE AND 1 ONLY WORKS WITH THEM DEAD.
---
I mean, this doesn't actually confirm it. We have no idea what kind of barriers are in the way to getting this done as there's no guarantee that Gallner actually holds the right of the likeness of Quentin. That's not to say I don't think it's likely—I have no idea how likely it is—just that the actor's consent isn't the only thing that's needed so we shouldn't take this as 100% confirmed, and that we shouldn't be surprised if we never hear about this again and nothing ever comes of it.
---
If the license holders aren't cooperative, the best thing they could probably do is create a separate character called Kyle Gallner and made it look like Kyle Gallner and everyone would just have to know that Kyle = Quentin, and just leave Goblinface as-is. Which I doubt they'd ever do, it would be a big middle finger and future license holders may not be very empathetic to the situation, and would create a really weird situation in-game where a character either has no teachable perks, identical teachable perks as another character, or would have his own new perks. Him having his own perks would be plausible but at that point, it's more of a "Kyle Gallner dlc" than a quentin face-rework
---
As a Killer, I’d rather have a perk that prevents survivors from getting that far. As a Survivor, oh god no
---
Its Demos secret ability...
---
eliminate
---
It's worse than that I fear. I ran around the map for a long time. That was the ONLY totem that spawned at all, as a hex, and our killer was try harding on PTB with an unbreakable Ruin. Wasn't fun.
---
from only like a month ago too lmao
---
No see, they can seal them at any time, like bear traps. It just takes significantly longer and the demogorgan can see when they are near them. They also become oblivious when they cleanse.
---
yea, escape cakes and BPS were meant to be limited-time items for an event but BHVR kept them since we liked em so much, it was around the time of the bloodfeast iirc
---
Template pls
---
Hahaha
---
LOL
---
Such a brave thing to say.
---
I'm curious what you think makes him really strong. Not that I disagree as I don't play Trapper much, just when I play as and against him I find him to be pretty underwhelming.
---
What is this comment? It is the enemy. This sub is way too preachy. “But like be excellent to each other” No. I want to play Myers and end your game just as cold and quickly as he would.
---
Like the German Shepard from the police video
---
As others have said before, they aren't going to add any content from JC, because the creator is a Pedo.
---
I play Megan. Can confirm. I'm awful. But I'm a squirrelly fucker lol
---
Even tho he was only a "child murderer"  its not that long of a stretch to guess why he was killing the kids in a secret room of a school.
---
NOED is fine how it is. I know I’m going to get downvoted for this, but idc. NOED is easy to counter by doing dull
---
totems. It’s going to be even easier to counter with the new Inner Strength perk. When I play survivor, I have no problem getting dull totems done and preventing NOED. Also many times when I play killer the survivors manage to prevent me from using NOED by cleaning totems. 
---
I feel like the people who complain about NOED are the ones who sit on gens all game and ignore everything else. Cleaning 5 totems is really not hard at all.
---
no, they aren't supporting the creators of jeepers creepers, he sexually molested a 12 year old boy who was in one of the films. the devs don't want to give money to that shit
---
So would you say you've adjusted to the dedicated servers with lag then? A lot of huntresses are making it seem like the end of the world, and the footage I saw of the first day of PTB made it seem like a server with anything close to above 100ms was unplayable.
---
SPEAKING OF WHICH, IS THAT ONE LEGION TROPHY IMPOSSIBLE NOW? THE ONE WHERE YOU HAVE TO DOWN SURVIVORS IN FERAL FRENZY
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
Edit: happy cake day too btw
---
Someone doesn’t ‘gorgon.
---
Nobody Knows for sure. Datamines say either this weekend or next weekend but really it's all up to BHVR.
---
That first one sounds like a way to make ruin worse.
---
When people mess with their WiFi’s so other people glitch out in the game and get a disadvantage
---
You can perfectly see my Reddit's account age and verify that I'm not obliged to know every top post that has been in this sub.
---
Wish I could say the same.
---
His animations and sounds are nice, also love his shred ability. Probably the best mori in the game aswell, overall he seems really good so far
---
Oh, so why put them near a gen in the first place if theyll just be closed? Yeah you detect people, but once its closes you gotta close it again
---
I see
---
/r/ThanksObama
---
Because it is? Lol. Also, you can’t do gens either, that’s toxic asf. But then, because of this, the killer has to give the last survivor the hatch *all* the time. If you don’t, you’re bad at the game and deserve to be reported.
---
Very good point
---
It keeps people from working on gens.
---
That Bubba made a mistake, if he really wanted to camp, he shouldn't have smacked you, he should had charged the chainsaw instead.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not that I encourage camping, but if he was going to camp, camp right.
---
Remember though, you have to run this over a different perk. That means you have to switch out either:
---
1) Borrowed Time
---
2)Sprint Burst/Dead Hard
---
3)Adrenaline
---
or
---
4)Self-Care/Iron-Will
---
These perks are pretty weak or sub-par when compared wit hany meta perks
---
"Hey."
---
And lot of balanced spots. Also the fuk you talking about?
---
From the sounds of it, I'd rather be friends with the Gay Legion Main than you :P
---
[Huntress main] Holy shit this is a massacre. I don't known what to say about this.
---
Lies
---
Lol that’s because you’re a billy main.
---
Well, yeah, if the killer is nowhere nearby, you're just wasting time, and if the killer is at the gates, just let them get their hit and get out.
---
They had a post out saying the 5th thru the 9th for another blood hunt double blood point weekend I seen it myself as many others did! Screw them and everything is encircling this fucking next chapter and yet again we will probably get the DBP weekend when they drop the DLC which will be full of bugs and nothing but camping tunneling shitheads! it’s gonna be another shit show chapter 12 hell fest! I bet you $1000 dollars that dedicated servers won’t be live for console till the fall. Just about done with this game and BhVR interactive another shit hole company who couldn’t code their way out a paper bag. Been here done this shit before with past devs....
---
Well, at least you’re one of the least toxic killers.
---
I've come back around on Trapper, from thinking he was one of the worst to actually being pretty decent.  For awhile I thought he was too time intensive to set up traps for a chance, basically determined by luck, at getting a good return on that investment.  That's still not even entirely untrue, but there's a lot less luck to it than it might seem.  He doesn't have the mobility that other killers have, so he does have to choose his battles wisely and be willing to give up defending areas sometimes when it would cost too much time, but he can control maybe half the map pretty well and force survivors into bad situations.  I would definitely recommend checking out Otzdarva for how effective Trapper can be.  He inspired me to go and give Trapper another go, and it's pretty satisfying.  Adapting aspects of his play into mine has made Trapper much more consistent and fun for me.
---
That was a joke
---
Don't know what platform you're on but on xbox [at least] they made the huntress dlc pack free a few months ago and apparently it wasn't a short term deal because it still is.
---
My bad. Im an experienced player and have been to rank 1 a couple of times. After playing for a long time and watching a lot of other peoples gameplay and builds you start to understand how things work and whats the best strats and perks to use
---
The Ranch was actually the campfire all along
---
It adds emphasis
---
Well thanks, I'm here just to upvote people stuff.
---
It's literally a switch that cuts off the outbound connection allowing the player to move and attack other players who are frozen for a few seconds. I've had it happen quite a few times in CODBO4.
---
A lot of times people confuse lag with lag switching which it's not. If you can't move and the killer can, then it's probably a lag switch. But, if your lagging all over place and can move, it's just the connection.
---
That with Lightweight combined = new main perk build
---
r/gamerpresident
---
I think it’s alright the way it is now I don’t think demo need nerfs, for some reason though people want it’s lunge nerfed despite it being worse than billy’s chainsaw and worse than nurse’s blink. Also demo will get worse as people get better at playing against him
---
I think head on makes for great play mid chase and saving people. The plague overall is an awesome killer that can really capitalize on survivor choices and mistakes without ridiculous play like Spirit and Nurse have. That’s the best DLC in a while and right up there with Myers and the Halloween DLC. 
---
Demo does have decent play when I’ve tried, and I don’t think any perks are good of the 9 except Inner Strength. That with DS and Head On are brutal. Possible new baby meta. 
---
It’s ok so far. I hope this is more about new players coming to the game and bringing more $ and attention.
---
You little shit, you play with self care.
---
I really like the demogorgon however I feel people are hyping him up making him sound like a really really good killer when in reality he's kinda mid tier plus not everyone has gotten good at countering the lunge making using shred easy , once the dlc hits live servers and everyone starts to play him more people will get better at countering his lunge making him less enjoyable.
---
That all pallets, but one or two, are unsafe.
---
Lol be honest, who do you main.
---
You're welcome!
---
Awaken! My Wraith Mains!
---
Slap on iron will so she can't hear your breathing and spine chill to know if she's looking at you . Ain't nothing more to say really
---
Why not bait out a pallet drop then get an easy tomahawk after, instead of sitting there trying to hit one like an idiot? I see Huntresses do this a lot.
---
If anyone has played the Gold Express tests, they have a really nicely done killer who disguises as a survivor. Works even against comms. She works by using her disguise (as one of the survivors in the match. if that survivor is injured then she appears injured as well)  to get close to people and get an easy hit or to run through loops as a survivor would. She is very strong and very cool, best in the game. Not completely horrible for solo either as thats all I played and still was able to beat her. It simply discourages you from wanting to work in groups or heal someone for fear of them being the killer. You keep distance until they prove themselves real. 
---
I think that after playing as and against her, there is possibility for a disguise killer in DBD that can actually be effective.
---
Actually, Trapper is the strongest Trap based Killer in the game, it's just that the ranking system doesn't account for him.
---
Trapper goes extremely well with a Late Game build (Fire Up at the very least) since it turns his biggest weakness into a straight advantage, and he is the only character who can completely shut down broken Loops that Survivors have (the window loops in Rancid Abbattoir and Ironworks of Misery). With Fire Up, having three gens pop means your traps are all planted and you're doing everything 12% faster now.
---
If you want to be a real dick, add in Corrupt Intervention and a Iridescent Stone and suddenly the Survivors automatically 3-gen themselves with self-resetting Traps on the Generators.
---
[Huntress main] FUCKING SUFFOCATION PIT, ALWAYS IN THE FIRST GOD DAMN MINTUE.
---
Fax
---
We'll make diamonds from our flashlights. Take them into the trial with us.
---
How do you do it? There is no foilage around the gates whatsoever. Survivors will see your traps from a mile away!
---
But they can keep pumping out cosmetics on time without missing a beat!
---
Trapper and Ghostface, used to be Trapper and Pig but Ghostface took over on her.
---
Could you imagine that? Someone just goes "screw this I quit" and warps out of the trap back to their house or something.
---
Is that Twitter or Pornhub wtf
---
Just relax, its just  Double Bloodpoints and I saw 'the post' too but it was from the Wiki. I had my hopes up for the Blood Hunt but went back and looked over their twitter and forums and didn't see anything official for it.
---
It's the walking version of Urban Evasion essentially, which makes it good for stealthily juking the Killer due to the walking movement speed bonus increase.
---
It is not good in actual chases since it deactivates once you're injured and you still run faster than you walk with Fixated.
---
But some people are talking about combining it with Lithe (run faster after a fast vault), Quick and Quiet (fast vault/locker silently) and Dance with Me (leave no scratchmarks after a fast vault or leaving a locker); this strikes me as somewhat nonsensical as you don't need Fixated in that build unless you're trying to find out when your scratchmarks reappear after Dance with Me (it's three seconds, you can just count it out loud).
---
That’s just plain wrong. The second floor has at least one good poop and zero hooks. The room with isolation tanks has two loops. Another one is one other place I can’t really specify. Probably more in other places
---
Ok. But at the same time how many times have you been body blocked by survivors? Don't feel bad lol.
---
maybe they don't want new players googling stranger things perks and getting BDSM murder
---
like, maybe Bind, Torture, Kill would be a bad name for a perk even tho thematically appropriate
---
That was my thought too, it just sounds like worse urban with scratch marks as a bonus
---
I think you did a great job on this! None of the perks are broken, and they all fit Daphne's personality. My favourite one is I'm a Blackbelt, I can literally HEAR her saying that in my head.
---
Absolutely. Im new to the whole Dead Hard business but so far it has been an exercise in frustration. I never seem to be able to time it right. Most of the times it worked was against a Huntress preparing to fling the hatch.
---
I smack em. I only had 1 person body block me successfully while I was trying to hook someone. So 1 out 100 that tried.  Yea that doesn't bother me.
---
Michael, ghostface, billy, and leather face, they can one hit down without a totem, and free moris eh depends on if they can even get far away enough the the labyrinth like map
---
It's not pointless, it's just heavily misused.
---
It's supposed to be:
---
&gt; Nobody:
---
&gt; Somebody: Did something no one asked for
---
And most people use it as
---
&gt; Somebody: did a thing.
---
And here I was thinking the beam had to be directly in their face for it to blind, apparently just has to be in the general area.
---
I don't run it anymore this was around christmas time and I still had it on.
---
I agree with fixing any potential bugs prior to the full release but I think any potential nerfs should only be considered after the full release.
---
Used it last night on a babysitting Steve build. I'd get between the killer and the chased person to get a stack, and the killer would always just stick to who they were originally chasing. Got every stack and used it to cover for the final two injured folks going for the gates. feelsgoodman
---
Think about what you just said. Cosmetics bring in revenue which keeps them afloat. it's not rocket science here. Agree to disagree. I prefer the game to run better over the delay of an event.
---
I play Trapper all the time and he absolutely needs some buffs. 
---
It's insane that you need an addon to carry more than 1 trap at a time, have to sink so much time into collecting traps, can have your power completely disabled by survivors and it's complete RNG as to how quickly survivors can escape traps.
---
what about intentions?
---
cruel intentions?
---
also to add, at the end of the first movie laurie stabs michael in the stomach and thought it was a good idea to drop the knife instead of, ya know, holding it just in case. as if it even mattered cause he decided to choke her out instead of stab her.
---
Dude mark this as a spoiler. I'm actually happy I finished that episode yesterday
---
Welcome to reddit
---
What people should do is close their wallets to this company and tell them no more until they make due on what they state! If that’s the case then BhVR interactive should have come out and made a official announcement that this was some bs thing on wiki and there would be no event, but yet again those incompetent people over at BhVR interactive have a serious problem with communication!
---
I was gonna point out that the game is fine on console, but then I remembered the regularly fuck it up and we have to deal with horrible fps for a month or two.
---
I'm low level and the game feels fair I just suck. I switched from feng to doctor recently and have gotten 2 4ks, tho one 3 of 4 dudes let me kill them cuz rank reset I guess and in another 2 dudes dced. I think I like killer.
---
I'm sure we'll get more information soon! Here's hoping though!
---
That's definitely a step in the right direction
---
I don't care about it as a survivor, don't use it as a killer.
---
I'll still attempt the save as a survivor :P
---
Killer:  
---
Bloodwarden + Noed
---
What's Gold Express?
---
Him: "Heh, we look like a couple here"
---
Her: "A couple of bestieeeessss"
---
**pallet drops**
---
Some of you may die.
---
But that's a sacrifice Kate is willing to make.

***S t e v e***

So, picturing the dude be wielding a steel driving hammer - like railroad workers used to drive the spikes in - and for his M2 have it be sort of a combo between Plague and Clown. He breathes out an AoE of smoke that inflicts Blindness on players and acts like the thickest of fog for obscuring actual vision but grants him sight on anyone trapped in the cloud.
---

---
I’m just done with the bs and this company, it’s all about making a buck and never fixing jack shit, just like another company I know which is going belly up. windstream communications, fuck the customer and sell them something! That’s their Moto!

https://i.imgur.com/qtMC0z6.jpg
---
Tell me that you love me more.
---
I think that's the joke he was going for
---
Yeah I'm noticing how this works.
---
I like killer too (im playong survivor rn bc the new kate cosmetic is my favorite thing in the whole game rn) bc its a lot more fun to be in control of the game and if a game turns out bad its myfault
---
They did that.
---
It charged faster than before.
---
The lunges range is very long, if you can get a guaranteed m1 then do it, it’s a lot easier and more worth it.
---
He's essentially an M1 killer, so him facecamping is just a non-point as you'll always get killers who love to camp. Leatherface and Billy can 1 hit down if they're camping, as can T3 Myers or any killer that's running NOED. Weird thing to complain about.
---
 Also his portals are literally geared towards fast map travel and defending important totems/gen clusters. Is Hag OP cos she can do the same? Is Freddy's gen teleport OP? I can't see how he needs a rework at all. Shred could do with a cancel cooldown but otherwise he's pretty balanced.
---
The second floor pallets are literal crap what are you talking about
---
Somehow survivors manage to get ALL of the totems before it can go off half of the time anyway so i'm indifferent to it.
---
Do you play PS4? Because I just played with someone and they messaged me that they thought the killer was lag switching, I didn't even know it was a thing. I've had so much trouble with lag on DBD anyway.
---
If they add a cooldown of some kind for shred, then make the hitbox a little more consistent, please. Shred seems to only hit when it wants to...
---
Awesome
---
This is gorgeous
---
Sorry that stuff was said to you, brotha. I hate that shit.
---
if the killers offering doesn't flip when this happeneds just close the game and restart ez
---
When you get a 2k but the entity is still disappointed
---
how long have you had the fucking game?
---
Wanted to share this with 'yall since I ended up including prettymuch all the licensed killers from Dead by Daylight.
---
Shit like that happens way to often.
---
There should really be a minimum distance from gens/hooks that a totem has to spawn.
---
I'm a daily player, so I don't care about the BP events. In fact, I try to avoid them as it brings out the worst players. There is no shortage of survivors who just abuse killers and killers who just camp and make it that shitshow. 
---
I really do respect what you're saying, I just don't personally don't care about these events.
---
Yes
---
It’s his only saving grace, if anything I think he’s in a great spot right now. They just need to fix lunge hit boxes because it misses half the time
---
It has a timer.

So do you think that everyone knows every post that has ever been posted here? In some other subreddit, I crossposted something that has been already crossposted by other user. I got a message saying that was a repost and my post was automatically deleted. How am I supposed to know that this is a repost if not even mods deleted my repost? If it is a rule (and I completely agree this should be a rule and repost shouldn't happen) then my repost needed to be automatically deleted in my opinion. I understand that it might be unpleasant for some people to see the same post again but for people like me that never saw it, it's funny (people are upvoting). So either the post is immediately deleted by mods or reposts will happen again again and again.
---
Edit: btw if you want me to delete it, I'll do it.

Just had to lie on the ground and cry like a btch for a few billions of times, im just out of tears at this point :/
---
And it is, just like insidious basement camping leatherface is a dick move. Just because something works doesn't mean you should do it. I don't believe instaheals should be in the game, so I never use one. I don't believe iridescent hatches should be in the game, so I never use one. 3 blinks, etc. Those are all scummy things to use and you will be deemed a dick for doing it. However none of it is bannable so its free to be used, just don't be surprised when people disconnect or are toxic right back.
---
You, as the killer, sets and controls the tone of the game. Do you want to have fun along with everyone else or do you just want to give the middle finger to everyone's enjoyment and go purely for kills? I mean, I would never even consider the later option ever, but I tend to consider others feelings in my daily life too.
---
**YAMETA**
---
and coodies
---
That's not true Tho. 
---
Hag is 100x better than trapper.
---
Hag has better map presence and can end chases instantly with very little penalty.
---
Trappers traps require long grass or dumb survivors, both of which on some maps are rare. 
---
He's way more fun,  but way worse 
---
Freddy also has better traps
---
What program you using to render these?
---
Thanks now i will see that in my nightmares.
---
UwU wuz zis!
---
Wish it was exclusive to weaker killers like wraith, leatherface, doctor, legion, etc.
---
He ate the survivors last trial instead of hooking them so the entity put him in time-out, gotta learn somehow
---
Vommy Mommy

Jesus christ.

I feel like ash and Steve are the best looking survivor (Nancy also but Nancy bad grrr &gt;:( )
---

Cycles in blender.. for video i use eevee in blender.
---
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD SURVIVORS ARE OP. I GET THEM ALL HOOKED ONCE BEFORE THE FIRST FUCKING GENERATOR, BUT FOR SOME GOD AWFUL REASON, THEY CAN GET ALL THE GENS DONE SO FUCKING FAST IT IS INCREDIBLE. SURVIVORS NEED A FUCKING NERF OR I'M GOING TO QUIT THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME!
---
but you actually did
---
Reporting: "The bird tipped over the pallet on me and continued to tbag and taunt me !"
---
The lunge is weird where on sloping surfaces it can miss and the hitbox is either a sedan or an apple. Portals are all good tho
---
lol ok buddy, time to take your pills
---
HybridPanda has the same problem.
---
I hope you get deep wounded and then have to mend for 5 minutes.
---
I do. Sometimes in random games like overwatch, this, and csgo. No other games I've found do this and it kindve kills them for me.
---
In dbd unless it says it doesn’t stack. It Stacks
---
I feel like they should up the amount of normal hits it takes. 5 hits at tier 3 sounds okay, right? You get hit twice, hooked, healed, hit twice again, hooked, healed, and on your sixth hit it activates.
---
This is the ideal situation, mind you. It is still very possible to not get it to activate, so it isn't as overpowered as before, right?
---
Legion mains can suck my balls
---
Altruism, boldness, etc, all exist too. Objective isn't the only way to make points, and the same goes for escaping. Just doing things will net you bloodpoints.
---
It's not even about what they got with them, it is just that some will still feel that they are in the right and will insult you no matter what happened in the game or what they did. It's like a... a broken record, just repeating the same shit all the time, "trash killer", "camper", "ez", etc. Just to insult the Killer without even thinking about it or if the things they say are the truth (which, even if they were, just pointing and insulting wouldn't really help).
---
Billy doesn’t have a cancel cooldown.
---
Ok so like I know this is a dickish thing to do as a Pig, but Nea DCing was pretty funny.
---
But he has maggots in his navel :c

Okay thanks for confirming :))
---
Good luck with the dash lmao, hopefully you don’t get looped as much
---
It’s true I could show u 😂
---
No worries, We've all been there.
---
Well thats better, I just had some exstitental dread about thinking that toxic people could harrass me even if I'm not playing lol. Not saying you are/were but its a scary thought.
---
Her ass gonna get fixated
---
Already did. Goodnight sweetie
---
Doc could never be daddy
---
I think it opens a door or two. TBH, I've spent most of my time in the lab either doing gens along walls or leading a tunneling killer around the map. 
---
It's a great map to get away from a killer and perfect for balanced landing.
---
Cool idea on paper, but they forget that this is the internet. So many exploiters and trolls like this
---
And rightfully so.
---
Listing the perks they used is irrelevant, since none of them change the foundation of the game or how it's played. Prayer Beads on the other hand...
---
I haven't heard anyone asking for a nerf, as far as I know survivor mains will be playing Demogorgon lol
---
I believe it's similar to the game where gates open only in specific areas though
---
What a nerd, I love it

Balanced landing could get more use so i like this change. Hills and certain maps abusing it could make it more meta. I like it.
---
Oh man, if only there was a killer who acts like a survivor, had a trailer showing them being mistaken for a survivor at first
---
And then was done dirty by having their ability being simply running and stabbing deeply
---
Holy shit. Free iridescent hatchets
---
Body blocking is not toxic so long as it's serving a purpose and advancing a goal. Body blocking to give a survivor more struggle time is not toxic, it's tactical.
---
Right?
---
sometimes they can still vault after having it Blocked off...
---
Oh yeah. It's not like you can run ruin and apply pressure to gens... No not at all :D
---
More like *reaches into pocket and pulls out giant key ring full of keys*
---
You know what scares me is the Demogorgon's chase music, It creeps me out.
---
Thank you for your thoughts! What do you think on the topic of sabotaging traps? I've always thought a killer with so many other inherent weaknesses just by nature of design shouldn't be able to have part of their power disabled for 3 minutes, even with as situational as it is.
---
This is one of the reasons Ash Williams is so fantastic.
---
Bruce Campbell actually partially owns the character, it was a technicality from when the first Evil Dead was made, so I imagine it was a lot easier for him to get added since Bruce has a say in whatever and wherever Ash Williams is going to be portrayed.
---
That’s... what I’m here for
---
Finally
---
They just need to limit the amount of traps you can have active at once and make them a refillable like Huntress Hatchets. That would also stop revealing him at the very beginning when you see a trap as you load in.
---
Who is this girl? I've seen her in a few memes recently.

You have to flicker the camera, its just makes it easier.

Or just don't run? That's the learning curve to the perk. Basically only run when you need to then afterwards if it's safe you can run without activating it again for 40 seconds.

In the movies she made traps that would guarantee the death of the person trapped. John wasn't disappointed by her. To him, she was a murderer.

She’s a really funny YouTuber, her channel name is Nicole Tv.

yep

---
Nice edit!! Looks dope!
---
Once they iron out the bugs, he seems like he'll be upper mid tier.
---
Not *quite* viable against good survivors, but almost.
---
...the fact that people are even *considering* nerfs is kinda dumb.
---
Ah, A fellow For Honor man of culture as well
---
What's the back?
---
“Why is the Boomer so skinny wtf”
---
To be honest, the Demogorgon is kind of weak at this state. Big and small loops have never been more effective since Old Freddy.
---
AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
---
Stealth killers will probably do good tho. 
---
Myers trapping someone doing the gen in Elevens room... Oof. That scares me.
---
Yes, I won a few times despite having hardly any unlocks.  But any information I look up online about the game mainly deals with perks, meaning I can't participate in the game until I put some number of hours into the game.  I can't implement strategies I read about or try new things.  This is in distinction to many other successful games.
---
You seem to be in the "I enjoy it" category, though.

Adrenaline rewards success while noed rewards failure

Pffft not with that attitude

wait? that how you 360 the killer by turning the character AND the camera?
---
I love your username.
---
It allows him to mind game with it, I think he should keep it

But more killers should be like billy not the other way around
---
Claudettes aren't so bad, some really lean into the whole healing thing and are super altruistic. Blendettes though, those guys are nightmares.
---
in the PTB?
---
Stop crying nerd dam play the dam game it's a new killer. Yall don't even know it yet
---
How is exactly is it mindgaming? Just curious
---
Oh my bad. New to reddit but not reading lol. I didn't see the ptb part I am tired. I apologize.
---
Why the fuck would you want this, it wouldn't take skill at that point, and that is a problem with certain killers, killer perks, and certain survivor perks.
---
I literally never use a mori. It seems so dumb. Get less points for almost the same amount of work? 
---
Just camp someone once they’re hooked to get some spicy points instead! /s
---
That's what appending "bitch" to your sentences is for, bitch!
---
ALL OF THE HOMO!
---
Honestly, the new perks are trash now and won't shake up the meta, some of them got nerfed for no reason. I'd most most of them are garbage tier, except for the babysitter, but then again, why don't I just use Borrowed Time.
---
Amen
---
The thing is hillbilly gets slower when he revs up his chainsaw giving survivors a chance to not get chainsawed because he's slowed while the demogorgon isn't and he has instant cancellation allowing him to M1 so technically nerfing him would make him more like Hillbilly
---
The fast map travel is fine, but the problem is it's being used as at the start of the game plant portals around a gen cluster, go get 1 hook, plant a portal, and walk around being able to see if anyone is near a portal and either ensure that cluster is defended religiously while there are still 5 gens left to do or the moment someone gets near a hook the Gorgon can immediately show up and tunnel the hooked survivor. It's OP the same way Legion was OP, when used by someone that's somewhat competent it is very powerful and can be used sheerly to grief people. Also, NOED becomes an endgame problem when survivors have already done gens and just bail.
---
It's still annoying when a Hag leaves a bunch of traps around a hooked survivor and stands just far enough away to not be detected by kindred, it's annoying when Hillbilly stands just far enough away from a hooked survivor and chainsaw sprints, and it's annoying when Leatherface basement camps.
---
If there is absolutely no change to the abilities on the table, then maybe it should just be not let people read auras around a portal, or at the very least around portals that aren't active? You know, make it so that it's not so heavily geared to people who would just grief with it?

---
Actually canon.
---
Actually there are. When the demogorgon hasn't activated the portals yet, they're invisible and the survivors can't interact with em.
---
Is that the true lore? I rarely read them, that would explain it
---
As far as i know you can't pop even if the timer hits 0 as long as you're holding m1 and dont miss a skillcheck, could be wrong but that's what ive been told
---
THE SAW IS FAMILY!
---
Save it for a relevant post
---
The hitboxes are the same, the new netcode is probably poor and causing lag, that why they keep updating it, keep in mind the first server ptb was a fucking nightmare so I think they're improving it.
---
Wait what? What do you mean when they aren’t activated
---
It is a confusing system, honestly. By the time you unlock the perks you want on the character you want them on, you are familiar enough with the multiple killers, maps, and counterplay strategies to feel consistently useful in a match without them. 
---
It may not feel impactful to veteran players who have grown with the game, but new players might see it as an intimidating learning curve. The best advice I can give is just try to be as productive as you can in every match as survivor (even if it is just running the killer for as long as you can), or learning maps and mindgames as killer
---
Now I just want them to tease Kars and then add Dio
---
Because of how fast he can open his mouth then cancel it, it’s keeps the survivor on their toes and guess whether or not the killer will shred. If they make it super slow he can’t mind game as easily
---
And remove 30% of pallets on each map while we're at it.
---
I dislike having to use portals when I don't want to just to activate them.
---
Good advice. I do see the value of perks to add variety to play and strategy to team composition (which seems hindered by not having team perk selections public).  I feel like needing to adapt, rather than having RPG-like progression, would fit the theme of being a survivor more.  But yeah, I'm just focusing on the basic mechanics right now and will take new tools as I find them!
---
wooòsh
---
I know how to use head phones, Im saying that the gen being worked on might be pretty far away from the hook and if you dont pressure the survs from the hook then you are letting them work on gens and at the 10 seconds you are trying to find the gens being worked on there are 4 People on gens, if you chase People of the hook there are 2-3 People on gens and no gen rushing going on
---
What does hope do. I used it for a while but I never fully understood what it was doing
---
Note: traditionally it was a physical switch, but nowadays it's super easy to just do it virtually, especially on PC
---
I laughed way too fucking hard at this. I think i just popped a lung.
---
Worth it
---
Why do you even want to rank up ? There’s no point
---
Focusing entirely on a survivor that you've clearly had no luck with hitting outside of maybe 1 surprise hit and 2 gens being done during that time? Clearly it's only because the survivors are genrushing.
---
Nope, I own the forza blue edition Xbox One, it runs perfectly fine, never had problems or frame rate drops. And I have 90 degree juked killers, lol, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, if the killer is enraged they make bad choices, like to keep hitting out of anger without taking time to aim correctly. 
---
And for the opinion, you can’t ha e a factually or statistically WRONG opinion. 
---
That would be a fact, opinions are free of any “facts” or “statistics”. 
---
It’s my opinion that playing with a controller is far more comfortable, and gives me better performance than a keyboard and mouse does, and I have used keyboard and mouse, tried for a while to get over the “learning curve” and it just never worked for me. That’s why I play console anymore, it’s just easier for me.
---
tnx bby
---
He likely "escaped" when your power drained. You can vault forever when you're not in a chase.
---
Ghostface went from being very good to basically awful, I don't know what you are talkin about.
---
On top of that his power still wonky, and he's the most bullyable killer in the game.
---
Try using this killer before you make stupid suggestions about his lunge, there's a lot more than zero cool down when you miss lunges. He's not nervous, he's not faster when he uses his power to move around he's slower. It's not like you can just bunny hop around the map at a faster pace with it.
---
Yeah Left Behind is prob gonna be a staple for me
---
Yeah, it would be really annoying to start the grind over.  But really nice to have the game portable.  Another reason I wish it were unlocked from the start.
---
I don't mind it, if I'm facing an m1 killer I just assume they have it and if it's confirmed I'll just leave rather than trying to save the unfortunate soul who got insta downed
---
I think its balanced
---
i thought i was on r/pornhubcomments for a sec
---
TO THE GROUP OF SURVIVORS THAT WERE BODY BLOCKING ME AS KILLER AND DISABLING HOOKS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME AS I WAS GOING TO HOOK SOMEONE I HOPE THERE IS A SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR YOU ALSO THANKS FOR THE POST GAME HARASSMENT ON MY STEAM PROFILE AFTER I HAD TO RESORT TO SLUGGING ALL OF YOU AND LEAVING YOU GUYS TO BLEED OUT.
---
If they add a cool down to canceling out of shred it's basically useless. Any good survival be able to play around that and make it worse than pigs Dash. Being able to mind game with it is the only thing that makes it good at high levels, as is extremely easy to just move left or right suddenly when he starts the animation.
---
I'll reiterate that for those who aren't listening, it is extremely easy to move out of the way this attack, he's been out for 2 days and mediocre survivors can already do it.
---
Cool down on lunge Bluffs will put this killer down there with Ghostface l
---
Yeah, this is big brain time! /s
---
"It doesn't cross the map and it doesn't one shot" isn't a great argument for why it is fair.
---
Its pretty insane how it shuts down huge areas of the maps as killer shack, hallways, and any open area between jungle gyms/pallets are all free hits for Demo.
---
Is it really a mindgame if his whole mouth opens and amits a screech? I don't really consider that mindgaming either it's more so a guessing game if you don't got line of sight I get where you're coming from though but I just feel he shouldn't be able to switch between M1 and shred instantly maybe a second if you cancel then you can m1?
---
I want to add on to this
---
The only characters that have to be bought using real money are licensed characters (think Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, etc). This is because BHVR (the developer) has to not only spend time making these characters but also *pay* the content owners for the license. So only reason they cost real money is because BHVR spent extra to bring in that character.
---
All original characters can be purchased using in game currency
---
Well I mean the chapter is cool but it’s something new also Quentin face has been a problem for a long time
---
The demogorgon does slow down when he charges this ability, and unless you're caught in a hallway it's a very easy to dodge if you predict it. If survivors can dodge 3 blink nurses then they will easily be able to dodge this.
---
He's fine, stop trying to Ghostface this killer
---
The music was still going on way after he made the 4th vault
---
The Demogorgon is a pretty cool killer, but unfortunately people have been playing him like an asshole so it's been like the pre-rework Legion. Plant portals on a gen cluster before a single gen has been done yet, place 2/3 (depending on how hard they defend that cluster) portals near a hooked survivor and keep teleporting between 2 and when the survivor is unhooked go straight for them. Love the Demogorgon, but sadly we can't have nice things.
---
Life as an Ace isn't something just anyone can handle. It requires a lot of sacrifice. Of you, specifically.
---
Claustrophobia would be a decent rename imo, but i really think the original is fine, google searches be damned
---
Another survivor dcing means you lose out on potential unhook and gen coop points.
---
You can use it around the corner to cause someone to move from a window vault over to the palate, which might be the difference between a hit or a vault.
---
If you give him cool down every time he cancels the power then survivors will just instantly move to the left or right every time he charges this power and it will never ever hit unless you're in Point Blank Range or in a hallway. It is much easier to dodge than you think
---
MOUSE
---
🍪🍪🍪
---
Makes ultra rare add-ons *even more* common than the regular system
---
You know I really only like a second between the two if he cancels right? I don't want like 2 seconds in between because that's a little long also the only reason I want this because it basically makes hesitation of to vault a window or not a guaranteed hit because if you go for a window he can just lunge and hit you and if you don't he instantly switches. Maybe I'm being a little Hasty with my thoughts but these are my feelings currently
---
I gave him 3 maybe he'll share one with you.
---
I still have no idea how flashlights work on the thing.
---
Here should be a perk that allows he survivor to walk faster coming out with stranger things. Pair it with that and you should be good to go
---
This is a quality shit post.
---
Ps4 had quick lobbies earlier. Have you restarted your system to delete the server cache
---
I wonder why people message me by leaving a team game and ruining the experience because I felt entitled to have a fun game
---

---
Yea probably should look at names before commenting lol.    I get where you're coming from and after looking at how well Ulysses can dodge the demogorgon just by moving right or left I feel he's completely balanced and I was making hastily judged thoughts about the demogorgon.   in my opinion I actually feel he'll get way worse with time once survivors get semi decent at dodging his shred making him mid tier. Glad you managed to change my mind though that's why I like having discussions with people
---
Mate, if they’re being toxic and can find matches easily, I don’t see a wrong. I’m not having fun so why must I stay in the match? I bought the game, so I’m gonna play it how I wanna play it
---
You don't get a notification, but doesn't it glow white when it's being sealed?
---
So you made a bunch of wrong assumptions about his power and are mad because you don't see how he's less abusable on hooks than hag or wraith?
---
You can't stop bad killers from ruining games  anymore than I can stop 4man depip squads. The 5 things I listed aren't difficult to pull off. 
---
If a demogorgon wants to lose the game by trying to be a worse hag then that's on them, 10 second cooldown is enough to unhook and get a heal off with We'll make it. He can't just go back amd forth indefinitely, and unless I'm mistaken you can see whenever he uses a new portal
---
The moment I regret bringing bloodwarden
---
How much googling did it take for you to discover that
---
In the end this whole argument amounts to nothing because all people care about is the New content
---
I know you probably just saw a funny meme and wanted to share it but there's a lot of cheap karma whores, repost bots, etc all around reddit so people tend to get *really* upset about reposts.
---
sorry everyone was laying it in pretty thick
---
When u get the 4K entity kill cause you purposely let gens get done to blood warden survivors asses...best feeling in the world.
---
Same - he's great and keeps the pressure on! Way fun to play against.
---
If your not having fun playing the game maybe it’s because you dc any game your not having fun you didn’t include the toxic part either you just should oh I’m not having fun I’ll dc I wonder why they are mad when I leave the game and possibly lose a item or offering I had because of some dick wad leaving
---
One of Steve's hooked scream sounds like singing to me.
---
Depends on the map; it helps to walk and listen carefully for a crackling sound where you know a totem might spawn
---
Wow nea's hand got ugly
---
I like his scream, it echos through the map for a while.
---
Lol I really thought I was gonna hear it. Nicely played.
---
5-8 min! What game are you playing because it’s not Dead by Daylight!
---
Agree - it would be cool if he could pick them up and replace them, but I don't think he should have *more* exactly.
---
Are you playing on a Surface?
---
I have no issue with that as a killer main, but pls let me hit you if you do this, bc otherwise what’s the point?
---
Already stated I changed my mind completely about it and I feel he's actually balanced just made a hastily stated opinion that's all and I actually feel he'll get worse with time as people get better and learn how to counter stuff etc
---
Kiryu and Majima.
---
A person of culture, I see.
---
Mate, I don’t care for bans, I got multiple accounts and I never dc as survivor. That’s the one thing I will never do. Yes I should’ve specified that I was playing Myers for the first time under the worst conditions. But you shouldn’t get so mad at someone for a genuine question. You might also want to start adding some periods in your sentences. So call me a dick all you want, but they got their bloodpoints and I started my next match sooner. There was really no loss there

I was playing Myers for the first time using a black splinter and got coldwind farm with the cow tree. I let them power the gates then dced. I found out one was rank three in a game of rank 12s. Explain how someone would want to stay in that match any longer.
---
I didn’t expect a rank 3 in a rank 12 game mate. Nor did I expect coldwind. I got horrible luck and left after they got their blood points. I just wanted to try him and well, never again it seems like it, that is when I’m sober
---
420 Rev it
---
I found out the way to fix this. Simply press the esc key and click leave lobby. It should get you back into the game. :)
---
Its like those kids who would say " TIME OUT TIME OUT" during hide and seek ,lol
---
And after a week nobody played any of them. Real solid killers.
---
I didn't my friend sent this in a group chat lol
---
Should have waited 10 more minutes to take the screen shot
---
True went against a huntress who had thrill of the hunt, huntress lullaby, and ruin that was the initial reason I want to learn how to find them.
---
No to everything you said.
---
Just “Confinement” would have been better.
---
Because, you know
---
Just make it block every window on the map for 30 seconds or expand the area
---
More like [ZA HANDO]
---
That wasn’t a good question why would you expect anything other than hate? And I hope you realize that even with multiple accounts you can get your system banned entirely like seriously that’s like asking I played killer and only targeted one person am I toxic? That’s setting yourself up for hate I legit hope you get banned
---
I know you don't want to waste a perk slot on Small Game, but it might be the quickest way to learn where the totems spawn. You don't have to run it forever. Just until you're more familiar with where to look.
---
The other option I can suggest is to have a friend or maybe someone from r/dbdlfg load in to custom games with you on each map. You'll have to load in multiple times, but you should be able to pinpoint where the totems will possibly spawn after a few runs.
---
Eventually, you'll just know where to look. I don't know off the top of my head where each one will spawn, but I have a pretty good idea where to look now.
---
It has to be Steve thought, can't be anyone else except maybe Ash, David or Ace depending on the strength of the form they have
---
He sure was trying to dc but it was too late.
---
And proud.
---
Yeah that’s usually the best part cause some totem placements are god tier so the map will help you find totems until you can remember locations by heart
---
Cruel Bindings?
---
It's not. Legions power could easily be used to tunnel, demos cannot.
---
You're worried over nothing, try and relax.
---
Legion was actually unloopable and inescapable, demo isn't even close to that difficult to lose. At best (for hard tunneling) he's a worse hag or a slightly better freddy
---
Never show kindness
---
They deserve it. If you're only coming here because you saw some characters from a series that you like, you don't deserve mercy. The people who bought the game for itself and not just for some characters are the ones who get mercy.
---
Rofl 5-8 minutes.  I'd be happy if it lasted 1 minute every game.
---
DIO as a killer when
---
Except its incredibly difficult to double pip if someone leaves as killer if the DC happens early. And survivors keep their BP if the killer DCs. He doesn't really cheat them out of anything unless he DCs before you leave when the gates are open.
---
CONTEX: 2 PLAYERS DCED AND ONLY 2 WERE LEFT AND I HAD NO-ED. I MESSAGE ONE OF THEM THAT ONLY ONE LIVES. I PICKED AT RANDOM. BY GAMER TAGS, I COULDNT TELL ONE WAS FEMALE. A DUDE GOT MAD BECAUSE I LET HIS GIRL LIVE AND KILLED HIM. IT WAS FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. HE PROCEEDED TO TALK ABOUT HOW HE “KICKED MY ASS WOTH 360S” AND CONTINUED WITH RACIAL SLURRED MEMES. I WENT EASY, THEY BOTH WOULDVE DIED IF I DIDNT. I TRY BEING A LITTLE FAIR.
---
You said you don't understand why they're mad, yet plenty of people here have told you why. And you argue against their valid points. It seems less like you're confused and more like you don't care. Leaving is leaving and it makes a bad experience for the other four humans you're playing with.
---
As a fellow killer, when you make that lobby you sign up for whatever happens, even if that means getting your ass kicked. And you deal with it and move on to the next game, learning from what you could have done better. They had a right to get annoyed with you leaving.
---
They got their rewards, but if they wanna act so immature, they didn’t deserve any of it. I do gotta day though, I did leave a couple details out that should’ve been left in there but like, everyone here is just way too toxic for no reason
---
Saw a concept for a Kill Count chapter for dbd dlc a while back. It looked pretty well made.
---
And how am I being childish I’m calling you out for bullshit but you insist that leaving and making waste time of their lives is justified cause you used a splitter add on for Myers with no perks and expected the best game of your life you shouldn’t being doing this red rank or not you played a killer you didn’t know and got wrecked like seriously wtf were you expecting?
---
A face only mother could love.
---
You guys have right to property?
---
Goddamn it i snorted that time.  
---
I hate you just a little bit.
---
i took my upvote away for your crossed out statement being absolutely blasphemy
---
Bro just saying, why are you using a splinter at rank 12. Youll get your ass blown. It seems like you just got heated and felt the need to type this. Just try to stick through with games or just go AFK. My advice is just save the splinter for when your rank is lower just because that shit will get you screwed fast.
---
Can you blame them? I would shit myself is I saw an alien lifeform open its head like a flower and run towards me
---
(Blows kiss)
---
Ay that's my build of choice!
---
Poor demorgon :(
---
What rewards did they get then less bp like seriously you get less bp for a killer leaving because of less actions and just a fact there’s a high chance people don’t wanna just play for rewards and also have fun in the game sounds weird i know

Huntress can't defend gens on a big map.  It's the reason why she has the worst map pool in the game - about half the maps in the game are bad for Huntress.

I’m arguing with the people that have insulted me or I’m simply just trying to further the understand their logic. I did leave out some details that should’ve been put in the description, but to give me more hate for a question is ridiculous. I appreciate you for being the most formal one here lol.
---
But yeah, they got their bloodpoints as if the match had finished and I just sped up the process of getting into another match. I just don’t see the point of going out of your way and messaging someone when you can simply just start another match. Especially continuing to argue with that person when you have their reasoning. It’s pathetic and I can see why people hate this community

When it gets nerfed: *Opens Flower mouth* REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Metal of man?
---
What map were you playing on?
---
Fuck yeeeaa give me dose missions plz . Doc Nea David main
---
I left because I wanted to start a match quicker than waiting for the survivors to wait at the gate and tea bag. They got their points and I found another match easily.
---
I'm on PC steam.
---
Well yes, but there will be a lot of new players due to stranger things and all of them will want to play it.
---
Well with nurse, you need skill to get hits with her blink. I get what you’re trying to say but they’re still very different.
---
You misspelled seconds there buddy.
---
Yup :) 
---
Had it for a few years now and am saving for a desktop
---
god i will not buy the stranger things chapter if they nerf demogorgon
---
If the game was over, why not just finish it? I dont understand your thought process.
---
ALL MY TEACHABLE PERKS ARE GONE, HOW DO I FIX THIS?
---
when did you purchase ghostface
---
They all had above 10k BPs and what’s the point of playing a video game if you’re not having fun? They got what they wanted, a match where all gens had been completed and gotten their BPs. I got a match where some racist dude with a god complex harasses me through messages. Like, they lost nothing compared to me
---
Yeah it would probably just kill him and survivors would win
---
Get fucked by the Stick.Exe has completed a task successfully
---
So lemme get this right you got your ass kicked survivors are at the exit gate which is every single game you get in and then you dc instead of finishing a game giving you more bp than you doing a dc and made them lose bp and you found another match easily they could’ve been a swf with friends so it sounds to me like you got salty over a add on you shouldn’t have used at a high rank expecting a win so you dc which can make people lose bp mind you so it’s a lose lose situation right here they gain less bp and maybe gain none and you gain none and lose your add on
---
You guys have a WIFI to play on?
---
I posted this an hour after the incident with the dude to make sure it wasn’t a salt post. Genuine curiosity was here. Using racial slurs after calling someone trash for dcing seems pointless. Like, just move with your day and enjoy the easy match
---
Watching him leap out of the shadows and down somebody, as you run away hear him screaming and the monster roar as he tears him apart.

Pretty good...i mean, good stuff

As a Dwight main I do them all the time, unless I'm trying to get some teachables from the characters I just bought
---
Excuse me Hag is my dad
---
I went against a T1 Mike running terror radius suppression build in the hospital. It was terrible.
---
No you got a match in high ranks left then got messages hate to say it but the community is toxic leaving doesn’t help if you can’t stand messages I’ve said before it’s not right what they said but you shouldn’t dc you should just finish the game and let everyone win it seriously isn’t that big of a deal if you don’t wanna see them wait at exit gate and T bag then build up your stalk and gain more bp your logic is very flawed and you bring a bad names to killers
---
She might be hard to learn but not hard to play.
---
With Nurse you don't need mindgames or prioritizing as you can literally hold M2 for a certain time and win a chase.
---
I’m rank twelve in the green ranks. I was facing a red rank with other green ranks. I didn’t expect a win, but I also didn’t expect to get such shit luck nor did I expect a red rank in my game. There’s no bullshit here and I’m pretty sure you got salty after looking at my genuine question.
---
Btw, you really need to use periods mate, it’s getting hard to read your replies this late at night
---
I beleive it was wreakers yard but I might be wrong.
---
*No eating tits or ass for the double penatration.*
---
*he touches the boob of a corpse though*

use small game so you can learn the placements first. after you learn them then use whatever perk you want.
---
I understand your anger but they arent the only ones that can be toxic.
---
Easy kills tho and I’ve done it
---
*Ghost in the Shell: Feng Ming*
---
yea let's get her actor's likeness
---
I would have to wait for the survivors to finish their teabagging at the gate one by one. If i hit one, he would be hit again and fall out side, resulting in an escape. To do that four times is just dumb. I wasn’t gonna wait around for it. They could’ve left, but they waited by the open door. This is really on them for being toxic and not leaving
---
I was wondering when they’d add my ultra rare add-ons!
---
i mean have you seen some of the death scenes from the show?
---
itll probably break fans hearts to see the characters die but they'll pop back up in the next round :)
---
It's called Hex Karma. Happens sometimes.
---
It uses your savegame from 29th August
---
As a David, I feel validated lmao. 
---
Claudettes are a mixed bag in my experience, but Neas always seem to be mostly useless. Jakes are usually gods. Kates like to DC after getting downed once. Megs and Aces are mostly average. Dwights are often super toxic, which is weird. Haven't seen enough of the others to get an impression yet.
---
Also not saying these are absolute truths, just funny patterns I've noticed, likely just coincidence.

#New Survivor: Jotaro Kujo
---
#####Stoicism
---
Your mental strength allows you to withstand things that would kill others. When healthy and hit with an ability that would put you in the dying state, you are injured instead. After a period of 8/11/14 seconds, you are put into the dying state.
---
"That's a nice watch... but I'll break it so you can never see time on it again." -Jotaro Kujo
---
#####Cheap Trick
---
You grow in power as you out-smart your opponents. While you are in a chase and the killer receives bloodlust, gain a token up to 4. Each great skill check grants an extra 3/4/5% progress and consumes a token.
---
"I figured you were planning something like this... Are you sure you did your research on us?" - Jotaro Kujo
---
#####Showdown
---
When injured in a chase, the perk becomes active. When you perform any quick action, all other survivors can see both you and the killer's aura for 2/3/4 seconds. Additionally, the killer will see your aura for 5 seconds. The perk deactivates once the chase is broken.
---
"There's only one reason why you lost, Dio. One simple answer. You pissed me off." -Jotaro Kujo
---
I don’t have to use periods because I don’t have to and yeah I’m not salty I’m calling you out on bullshit and since you got a bad luck game you wanna ruin it for everyone else well guess what half the Reddit was filled with bad match making you aren’t the only one but those people didn’t leave. You my friend seem a bit salty because you refuse to listen to anything people say just saying stuff like oh they were toxic after I left and I wasn’t having fun by that logic half the games in dead by daylight should be filled with people who dc and like you didn’t expect bad luck but you played a killer with no perks and it’s your first time playing them what were you expecting exactly I’m pretty sure even if they were all green ranks you wouldn’t have gotten good luck
---
He enters a locker to change into “mother”.
---
What if he could also hide in a locker and grab a survivor if they enter.
---
Fucking awesome
---
Repost
---
I’m not even high rank though, they could’ve escaped. The doors were open and they were waiting at it. They didn’t leave so I dced. Where did I go wrong? I wasnt gonna smack them. I’m playing for fun mate, not rewards. Also, it was an offering I was glad to get rid of. They could’ve escaped but they waited, thats on them

In the films, she bamboozled her victims into thinking they had a chance to escape but really there no chance in surviving since she rigged them
---
That literally just happened to me too!

And for whom?
---
&gt;This is really on them
---
Yeah, no it isn’t. Just chase them out and get your bp next time.
---
I now hate you for wanting to further nerf one of my fav perks that doesn't even work half the time and has already been nerfed to hell.
---
I think he’s a little too human now people say everyone is basically human but they all have something special in killing he legit had a knife and was crazy about his mom pig has blades that come out of her sleeves and one of the most iconic horror items the reverse bear trap
---
Thank you. Im laughing at this message. Ty for making me have a good day
---
Thanks for the credit: )
---
Spirit is 2nd best in game but not fun to play against unless they’re a bean
---
Yeah, babysitter combo is gonna make it worth running more now.
---
They didn’t leave so I dc that’s literally like every killer game ever that always happens is that what you do every game then dc when survivors get to the exit gate if so you have very low patience
---
Why is this kind of post becoming a thing when they're obviously in KYF? 😒
---
Well in your post you didnt indicate who you were playing as soo... yeah thats your fault tbh. "completely justified" holy shit hahahahaha, yeah because what you did doesn't ruin anyones experience
---
The survivor thats sending you racists and homophobic slurs is sadly over reacting.
---
And you bring a bad name to the community mate. Like, they had all that time to leave but they waited. If they wanted to escape and by be a toxic dick, they would’ve escaped. They didn’t do it so I left and am now receiving, like I said before, racist and homophobic messages from a rank 3 put into a lower rank game. Please for the love of god use periods man
---
facts
---
It wasn’t confirmed at all it was sort’ve made up but I think there could possibly be one this month or maybe next
---
But not the joke we deserve
---
His new buff made him viable.
---
Would be more effective with the skips ahoy skin.
---
*NANI!?*
---
Well, yeah. But I'd prefer this hand cosmetic over the cyberglove or the muppet.
---
If you wanted your facts straight, you would’ve asked for details. But instead you decided to reply with what you did. They could’ve escaped, teabaggin at the door and everything, but they didn’t. That’s on them
---
BBQ and Ruin, daring
---
So your lazy. Both states have uses
---
does anyone have a clip of his scream? I'm a PS4 player and can't play the ptb
---
The reason your getting grief is when the killer dc's no one gets any blood points. This happened to me yesterday we had just finished the last gen and the killer dc'd. Just let the game run its course.
---
How do I bring a bad name and you keep bringing up the messages you ever heard of turn off messages on ps4? Just because people get cocky at exit gate doesn’t call for a dc you literally could’ve looked at Reddit or something don’t get salty about a game taking longer than it should because people wait at a exit gate and you said you left because bad luck but now it’s because of them waiting at exit gate make up your mind. Ps: I don’t think I will
---
I stared at their teabagging and they didn’t un out. They had their chance, so I dced. That’s really their fault for being so toxic. Like, I don’t know what you want, they had their chance and refused. I dced to start another match sooner and one guy gets salty at me. Nothing wrong mate
---
4 stacks of WGLF too hnngh
---
I'm guessing it was a disagreement between host and client. Tons of stuff is determined in each players instance of the game, so you get ton's of wonky shit like this. Sometimes I get downed just after dead harding, and I still get exhausted. Other times I will get exhausted, and then get un-exhausted two seconds later. The only way this will be solved is if they allow all the action based stuff to be monitored by the server once they move to dedicated servers. At least then there would be a neutral 3rd party deciding.
---
I just kept upgrading in the bloodweb untill i came across this
---
Thanks for the clarification! :)
---
If survivor teabag he should get exposed effect, and being able to be moried
---
Bottom right is the face I make when killer chase da pebble.
---
I’m starting another match sooner, if they wanted their bloodpoints and to keep any item they found, they would’ve ran out. It is on them and line I’m constantly saying, I’m playing to have fun, not for BPs
---
It’s really their fault for being toxic or your fault for not killing them? They had their chance to leave and refused and you had a chance to chance them out and refused
---
It did make it to the PTB, they just found it to be a better (if more situational) whispers, and didn't go forward with the change.
---
we gonna see a lot of vore...
---
I really hope i never find you in a lobby
---
Imagine thinking 200 ping is bad
---
do you period
---
the fire can't burn anything except offerings
---
If you’re not gonna use periods and refuse to use proper grammar, I’m not gonna argue with you any further. It’s reading run on sentences and it’s not something I’m trying to do this late at night. If you want to continue, use periods, if not, I’m done replying to you and probably gonna block you for being illiterate.
---
Then Just run out instead of teabagging at the gate. It’s that simple
---
At least with tapp the design looks decent as a character or a person  that could easily exist and not like a gremlin or anything

Sorry, don’t care. Didn’t read! Try again?
---
Mate everyone isn’t native in english
---
Small Game, Detective's Hunch, Rainbow Map, Green Map w/ Red Twine, memorization over time, turn up head phones and you can hear lit totems.
---
Please don't bring Jojo's shitty fucking community to this game, dbd's  fanbase is already bad enough.
---
May have been one of those setups where they massively reduce number of boxes and get an extra trap.
---
Amanda's Letter + Last Will could potentially enable the situation portrayed.  See them fail to open one box, just camp the other.
---
She'd have no more traps left, but it would leave her in a position of relative power over the remaining survivors.  A 2v1 with 3 gens left is at least one more kill generally, and the other being a hatch escape, unless they manage to pop 2 of those gens seconds later.
---
What can I say?
---
*I'm the bad guy.*
---
They decided to be toxic and teabag when I gave them the chance to leave.  I left because they wasted my time, resulting in their time being wasted. But they weren’t there for fun if they got salty after being toxic. There’s some respectable people in this community, but then there’s the others. I’m glad you not being toxic in anyway mate, thanks for that.
---
Eh, the speed you get from it is still far better from stealth and is really easy to catch up, It would still be way to op if NOED effected it.
---
To be honest it doesnt matter which side you were on, you disconnected and thats that.
---
You know you can Open the gate yourself right? and put them on a timer or idk chase them out
---
YESS
---
So, you finally used punctuation. That’s a start I suppose, too bad all your other points aren’t taken seriously due to them being illiterate! You clearly did read it though, otherwise you wouldn’t have copied me.
---
.... tell me that you love me more.
---
Sleepless long nights, tell me that it feels so right. 
---
OH SWEET ANGEL DELILAH

&gt; googling stranger things perks and getting BDSM murder
---
What in the hell are you guys googling to get this shit? I'm just getting articles about solitary confinement.
---
Yeahhhhh let's hold up on beat chapter yet 🤣
---
What when? Because right now u can only get hits through protective hits.
---
Coulda also been an Amanda's Letter + Last Will situation.  She knew there was only 2 boxes, and had 2 traps to work with.  She knew they failed the other box, and that both of them were auto-kill from this box not getting to be used.
---
“Mom he’s not using periods even though his arguments are legit without them and I’m getting a lot of hate for being stupid” is what I heard out of that.
---
I didn’t want to go through the process of smacking each one twice nor was I gonna let them be toxic without punishment. They got what they wanted it seemed and well, now I’m being harassed through messages by the rank 3. I feel completely justified for my actions.
---
True! But I drew him with that skin on for the past few drawings I posted so I wanted to try something else ^^
---
If this couldn't have happened, you know what she would have done?  Hit them.  Watch them bleed out on the ground because they can't interact with the box.  If they got picked up, all you would have to do was go right back to the box.  If they even had enough time to use it.
---
Why is demigorgon and frank not daddy

Now we’re acting even more childish? This immaturity is making your points less valid and not helping your case whatsoever. You can have the last word if you desire and continue to be immature, but I’m out and probably gonna block you for acting this way. I’m too tired to deal with this further, so peace
---
The Vince Mcmahon meme will forever be my favorite meme.
---
Even that description depends. If the doors are open, its downright foolish for the killer to waste their time hitting you instead of trying to get at the dwight.
---
Unless we doin JUMPSCARE MYERS!
---
played on this ping since i couldn't find a decent lob under yellow ping. they did not get out though :(
---
You know how bullshit it would be if a killer could hit you from 30+ feet away because on his screen you weren't?  Oh wait, that is exactly what it's like when matchmaking decides to send me to fucking brazil to connect to my killer.
---
Yeah, this mind gaming me rn
---
Damnit it as soon as I heard the music pop up I had ptsd of the legendary eggdog good shit
---
Unrelenting. What kind of a meme build are you running?
---
no idea, other comments say it's because google searches would turn up bad stuff, honestly doesn't seem that convincing to me, especially because it's purely speculation
---
I swear if they'll nerf another killer quickly after the release just because of few salty kids that lost against him, I'm going to be seriously pissed.
---
I'm not at home currently to try PTB, but I've watched many various streamers (both survivor and killer mains) playing against or as Demogorgon. In my opinion he's perfectly fine right now and definitely not even close to being OP. Nerf would only destroy him. Actually I've seen more games where survivors completely destroyed Demogorgon than 4K Demogorgon games.
---
Well oof, not everyone is magically good at the game :P 
---
(Still waiting for Legion buffs &gt;:( )
---
Oh I meant his power/effect against the killer.
---
When they play killer, find you and Play nurse
---
You set yourself up for that you fool
---
nah like how the killer is hosting
---
I thought we're playing gen rush simulator with some annoying guy interrupting us?
---
No it’s because it says 360 because it knows he does a lot of 360s.
---
Bloodmarket?
---
I did quit yes. I also did forget to add some details in the description. But they could’ve left. They decided to waste my time so I wasted their time. Get angry st me all you want, but I’m just returning the favour to the toxic people
---
Lol
---
IMO only block for the person completing the gen/who have worked on the gen, and increase the range.
---
It ain t the same feeling tho.
---
I wouldn’t know I’m a ps4 player :( .
---
Well all the newer maps are survivor sided so no surprise there. There are way too many pallets everywhere. While many of them aren't safe that are a very big waste of time as you don't see many of them in the chase until it's too late (around corners). With that it's not very balanced for freddy pallets. And yes, I'm not a big fan of that dream world effect either, I'd rather they use something closer to the movies, like a tinge of red &amp; green.
---
They have it set so if you play the demo (or even freddy it seems?) you almost always get that map. If you play another killer it's rare. so it's hard to say how well it plays for another killer. I imagine it'll be much more difficult for a Trapper, Huntress Billy and maybe Hag.
---
I’ve lost all my respect for you mate, comparing me to those people. I dced because they didn’t want to leave. They waited and were toxic instead of leaving. They waited my time, I wasted theirs. It’s as simple as that
---
I thought the 360 was doing w a s d w, we are character forms a quick loopy but apparently you have to move the mouse at the same time I don't understand
---
I don’t get why there isn’t penalty for leaving. Like if you leave two games in a day or 4 in a week your account is banned for a set time. It’s so annoying. This goes for survivors too
---
Tbf launching yourself off high places as Demo is the funnest shit ever.
---
I was nurse too 😢
---
Nurse is my mommy 🤤
---
I like fornite and battle buses
---
I'm against dcing but those loops look bs
---
It's probably going to be dependent on when the chapter is coming out so people can level up their new characters supa fas.
---
Yeah it is kinda awkward but legion also has a similar animation to that it misses and they stand up for a second

Lol it is fun to read stupid comments
---
Maybe shidd and cum?
---
He's certainly designed like Freddy  with the gen tele's has the lunge like pig and the setup time of portals like hag. He's basically just mash-up of already existing killers. I think they're running out of idea's. I think if he gets out of PTB without any nerfs and no buffs to his perks he's C tier at best B. We'll see.
---
Yeah I agree with this he started out saying it was because he was bored, but it turned into survivors beings toxic, so idk if he’s telling the truth on this lol
---
I did read them, doesn't change the fact that DCing is a shitty thing to do.
---
Aw boo hoo they were at the gate teabagging for a maximum of 3 mins. 
---
Get thicker skin you baby.
---
It's super weird that it does because Devour Hope instadowns don't work with Shred but HG does??
---
I gotta say, it looks really cool in that grab animation.
---
there's a reason there's a ptb
---
Doesn’t the oblivious status effect apply to all killers when they’re in stealth.. or have I misread the patch notes?
---
5 minutes, Rofl! i only got that time maybe once when playing against rank 17s.
---
Spine Chill pops and I Fixated my ass out of there.
---
Didn't he just say she isn't? Because she definitely isn't fun to play against.
---
I love it and hate it at the same time
---
repost
---
They teabagged at the gate when they could’ve left. A scum bag move for a scumbag move
---
Did you forget the OG badass Lauren?
---
I’ve been able to vault before a killers Bamboozle blocks it off also. Doubt that’s intentional.
---
it might be next weekend, but don't bank on that
---
Lol, what pissed you off so much? I left because they were toxic and quite frankly, didn’t deserve those points. They could’ve left, they decided to be toxic and payed the price. Leave and don’t be toxic and all your time isn’t wasted
---
It takes a while to grind but the chapters go on sale quite frequently so you can always pick up other characters then
---
Id hate using IT. But adrenaline is a thing.
---
They waste my time I waste theirs. Simple. To get racist and homophobic messages from dcing is ridiculous though.
---
Rigging games you
---
why
---
Think of Bloodwebs as a market of sorts. 
---
It allows you to buy items, addons, perks, etc for Bloodpoints which are earned through playing the game(you gain more from certain actions as well as perks that give more Bloodpoints).
---
You earn perks by levelling characters past 32 and getting their "teachables". These unlocked teachables will now make them appear on other survivors bloodwebs allowing you to use different combinations on different survivors.
---
Survivors basically have no difference between them other than teachable perks to get to other survivors, and of course if you like them cause of cosmetic / backstory.
---
Cleanse Totems breaks the totem and gives you points. The importance of this is to get rid of certain things called "Hexes".
---
Think of them as a sort of secondary objective in a way. Certain killer perks light up totems that'll give them special effects when broken or from certain triggers.
---
For example, you will encounter this eventually: Hex Ruin.
---
This Hex will make the normal skill checks on the generator actually regress the progress while also stopping any progression.
---
The way to counter this is to hit the "pip"(white square at the start of the success zone) so that it doesn't regress.
---
This is just an example of a hex perk, there are many more.
---
At first, the game will seem unwinnable, but practice makes perfect after all. You will die....a lot, but it doesn't have to be this way.
---
The way to make sure you survive is knowing how to loop, doing gens, and wasting the killers time.
---
By wasting the killers time, you allow your teammates to progress on gens that'll open the exit gates and allow you to escape so you can "win". 
---
I sadly don't have a video series I can recommend to learn the basics other than throwing you into what a good survivor and a good killer looks like.
---
Not as bad as the return the slab ep
---
Don’t bother with this guy he’s just a asshole he doesn’t listen to criticism and blames the survivors I doubt he has played survivor at all
---
Me and a few other people I’ve seen on this sub definitely only even heard about and got interested in the game in the first place because of Michael and Laurie being added
---
maybe its a hint of what they did to eleven in season 1
---
Head on*
---
Sure they should buy it for that reason, it’s one of the main reasons BHVR gets licenses in the first place
---
Everyone has to learn sometime. I don't send a lot of PMs but I've definitely been known to PM "And that's why you don't want to sit there wacking the hooked person."
---
console 360s are fuckin' easy, not to mention the killers are terrible
---
Second wind improves efficiency substantially, can work on a gen and heal at the same time.  Nancy’s aura perk will be great for solo queue.  Killer perks are all garbage pretty much.  Cruel confinement could be used on billy to really fuck survivors over.  Killer perks need buffs for sure.
---
Survivors wait at the gate to get hit and leave. It gives both you and them extra points.
---
Frick you’re right
---
I made this a couple days ago but I’ll delete it
---
Nancy
---
I feel that the portals combined with thrill of the hunt wouldn't be fun to go against. Placing portals near all hex totems and knowing when to travel to them.
---
Slippers
---
And Fredy mori
---
No clue. I'm wondering this as well.
---
Freddy’s mori makes the survivor randomly stand up, so maybe they’d just do that again?
---

*SLAPS ON MORI* bring IT toxic survivors FOR THE GIANT DOGGO!

Plague and ghostface "solid killers?" Are you *trying* to hit open wounds? They're pitiful. The plague power is not useful unless survivors make mistakes and THE Ghostface (stupid name) is unoriginal (power is tykie mikey shitting in amanda's tall grass) and a pathetic excuse for a chapter as a whole. Plague is at least one whole league/tier over ghostface, and she is still not even in my B list.
---
I can agree that new freddy and spirit are solid, but the demogorgan hasn't been out a week. I imagine its pounce will be almost useless on open space maps, and the teleporting would be the only saving grace to make it viable.
---
As some have said, tweaking for perfection takes time, but a nerf right out of the gate would be undoubtedly unsavory.
---
Pretty much they'd just kill themselves same result.
---
I’m gonna miss Quentin’s beautiful face..
---
Yes yes its perfectly reasonable to have a game that relys on a perk not to be over in 3 minutes.
---
Very reasonable.
---
Well currently dedicated servers aren’t live on main game yet. So you’re connecting to the killer as he is the host. If his internet goes bad then it all goes to shit
---
aha....
---
You get 157% speed if hope is level 3, it stacks
---
I'm not saying that the demogorgon is overpowered but just because something is not as overpowered as another thing that doesnt mean it can't be overpowered.
---
Same bruther

☝️☝️☝️tHiS mAn rIgHt hErE iS sPiTTinG sTrAiGhT fAcTs!!!
---
Lol, waste my time I waste yours. I’m playing for fun, not for BPs. I won’t hesitate to throw your point down the drain. Just leave and don’t be toxic
---
This seems like a good fix
---
^^^/s
---
Except when you DC so someone else can get the hatch or deny the killer BBQ &amp; Chili
---
I wouldn't worry too much about knowing when to activate it, since red rank killers will play around it and run right up to you if given the chance. The killers missed attack cooldown isn't very long, so even if you get it off, they will be right back on you. The most effective use of DH is to get you the extra distance you need to make a window or pallet.  
---
  
---
If you are desperate you can use it elsewhere. Try going into a 360, then DH right after. Usually the killer will try to hit you through the 360 and you can bait the swing. Another place is when you know you just can't make the window vault. Run at it like you are going for the fast vault, then peel off to the side and DH. Killers will often take the lunge to try and hit you as you vault, so you can force the swing there. Sometimes you don't even need to DH there if they swing swing early.
---
Go back home little Gladiatoe, you're lost.
---
Yeah that makes sense, but i play swf alot and even though i get that lag on skill checks, my friend dosen't (I've asked if he just lagged and he didnt) it's weird because it's basically only on gen skill checks as well. Ive never gotten it on sabo or heal
---
So you were having fun and *NOT* wasting your time right up to the point where they were all in the gate area.
---
Sure.
---
Sounds like you wasted your own time.
---
Honestly at this point I'm not even gonna buy killers any more, just wait for the good perks to be in shrine and use them on hillbilly. If they want the new guys to be trash then that means they love going against the OGs, right?
---
You'd have to know that the survivor is on their last jigsaw box though wouldn't you?  Or just assume they're screwed because you hear the fast beeping?
---
Don’t waste my time and I don’t waste yours. Simple.  Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a ghost face crouch build to tend to. Stay tuned for an ebony Moro with quick stalk add-ons!
---
Little did I know Freddy Krueger was actually Michael Jordan in Space Jam
---
Dwight :
---
Finger nails are yummy
---
Bruh imagine the level of toxicity required to do this and multiple it by 1000
---
Exactly &lt;3 both lore wise and mechanics wise it makes perfect sense for him to not slow down
---
Very funny, did laugh
---
I wasn’t having fun but I was planning on playing through it, resentfully. They wouldn’t leave so I ended the match. It’s simple really. Waste my time, I’ll waste yours
---
The Wraith... Bing bongs
---
Yeah i disconnected too. Im pretty annoyed because i lost my survivor pudding
---
You spent more time watching the loading screens then you would have just chasing them out the gate.
---
Get outta here with that braindead logic shit
---
No. Its not. Obnoxious, yes, but not toxic. What you did, thats toxic.
---
Waste my time, I’ll waste yours. I don’t care if you don’t get BPs, just leave and don’t send me hard Rs as a result
---
Someone in here mentioned that a similar asymmetrical game implemented something a lot like this and it worked pretty well even against parties. At the end of the day, SWF counters lots of killers pretty effectively, I think the first variant would fare alright.
---
See this is the thing. You ask a question, i give you an answer, and you get defensive. They maybe tbag to get you to come to hit them because you're just standing there. But honestly, why ask the question if you don't want answers to it?
---
how
---
gay people are too busy playing plague lmao
---
How did I lose I gained 20 karma in this experience and you lost 50+ I won because everyone knows this is bait which it didn’t start out to be I can and I won because I know you didn’t block me first lol made you angry and even made friends in this comment section it seems to me I won here and your just gonna be known as a dick
---
Definitely blind killer, but nice job
---
A free sprint burst and they cant find a loop?
---
oh well not my problem safe hook prompt happened
---
Wraith is my dad
---
Op probably plays their leveled survivors in the ptb
---
ok? what are you even trying to get at now? lmfao
---
DBD doesn't need stronger killers, it needs the current roster tweaked to complete with BilSpiNur.
---
Found the killer main
---
Pretty good take I love the pounce like attacks on killers
---
Why didn't you show you're rank
---
Lol, who even cares for karma? Just a number on your screen meaning nothing. You took the bait and I fished you out. You lost in my game. Karma means nothing to someone who doesn’t even who reddit that often. It takes a lot to piss me off and words just simply won’t do. Stab me in the back and maybe we’ll see some rage. Hold this L bud. Goodnight and thanks for the laughs!(Please take some sort of English class for your own good though.)
---
That film terrorised me as a child so yeah could fit well with dbd
---
I did wonder. Your story changing was what tipped it for me. I understand the frustration and like I said my viewpoint is if I DC I am as bad as them so I can understand their frustration, but again this does not condone hate messages. Personally I just go stand in the basement and leave people to their devices, I try to take a more I don't care it's a game I am not getting annoyed by it attitude.
---
Hang in there. The game isn't very well balanced for brand new players. It's going to take a bit to get used to playing against each of the killers. One easy way to get the hang of things is to try playing as killer for a few games. You can see what the killers see that way, and get a feel for the things they do and don't want you to do as survivor. Whenever you run you leave scratch marks that are visible for 7-10 seconds, which the killer can use to track you. When you are injured you make lot of noise that the killer can hear directionally, and you also periodically leave pools of blood.  
---
Survivor 101: The map spawns with 7 generators, or 'gens'. The survivors need to complete any 5 of the 7 gens to power the exit gates. You want to spend as much time as possible working on gens. Most killers are 15% faster than you by default. The only way to stay alive is to use windows and pallets. You can vault windows much faster than the killer, especially if you get a running start directly towards it. Pallets can stun the killer if you drop it on their head, or create a barrier between you in a pinch. These two things help you make up for the difference in speed. If the killer is after you, you should always be running from one window/pallet to the next, and only in the shortest possible path. If change directions mid chase the killer will be able to cut you off more than likely. A good place to start with this is to begin each match by looking around for a couple of windows and pallets you can run to when the killer shows up. You don't have to run him forever, you just need to waste some time for your teammates to get some gens done.  
---
It's rough in the beginning. I highly recommend watching someone like Monto or No0b3 on YouTube play survivor. Just seeing it done right once can help a ton.
---
Mate, someone’s called the bait out and well, I’m just not even trying to hide it anymore. That devan dude fell hard lol
---
naaah that's just the actual hitbox.
---
I don’t need English I can talk how I want free country but do take classes on human interactions not a good job so far

....
---
Didn't...
---
Didn't people say almost this exact kind of praise towards the spirit on release?
---
Yet lately theres been a circlejerk of "hurr durr spirit no fun nerf bad klr too ez to get keels with"
---
Give it some time. Joy turns into salt as sure as the sun rises.
---
I’m with you there
---
I mean at least try. Even a title like "kissy kissy" is better than nothing. I've been seeing so many posts that are just "title" or something similar and it's just getting annoying.
---
And also have fun getting ip banned so good luck with alts :)
---
Sometimes I wait for kobe, but sometimes I'm just like: nah, if they kobe and find the hatch, so be it. And sometimes I'm just respecting kobe like "oooo I can't touch him"
---
I couldn't even see the demogorgon until I looked back at the image also yea every killer must hate Claudette no matter what.
---
His point is if your going to act in a disrespectful toxic manner to him during the game then he is not going to give a crap about your fun. Not condoning his actions just I can understand his point of view as many have the old 'eye for an eye' outlook in life, not personally my choice but each to their own.   
---
Also dude he was trolling as he admitted in his reply to me. He baited you all.
---
I don’t think he baited he sort’ve just made himself look like a idiot
---
So I mainly play killer most recently my boy Ghostface and daddy Freddy I don't use ruin and I 4k most games at all ranks. Am I lucky as fuck or is it not as needed as most people keep saying because like I have the teachable but I like having perks that tend to give me consistent gains where ruin I find is inconsistent
---
I’m petty prick lol. That’s how I solve my games issues. Either way, it was nice talking to you. Have a good night
---
The phrase "to die on a hill" is not a threat, nor a suggestion, it is an Allegory.
---
Or, in simple terms, a phrase that has a deeper moral or spiritual meaning.
---
I'm saying, that your sticking to this very obviously wrong thought process, and there's nothing to gain from it, so you should stop doing it.
---
I don't want you to get banned, I want you to stop being a child an own up to your misguided notions. If you can't do that, then I ask that you refrain from putting yourself in situations where you would continue to make these short sighted, bull headed ideals.
---
But I digress.
---
Go back to your For Honor porn and trolling on the internet, because that's mature of you, child.
---
And finally, to conclude this stupid pissing contest,   you shouldn't let the words from faceless, anonymous, fuckwits in your message box bother you enough to go crying on Reddit.
---
Grow thicker skin.
---
well u talk talk about your feelings.
---
Fuck me daddy Trapper 😫😫🍆🍆
---
A few weeks ago
---
I’ve literally never seen this happen in my time playing so I wouldn’t say it’s that commonly abused. Even still, they would’ve died anyways with the time they had left.
---
Cruel limits is just bad lmao
---
I'd said stupid...He could switched to Treatment mode to find you
---
I’m very confused you were baiting to be a dick but I was a dick and how am I looked at like a fool nobody in this comment section agreed with you I’m not mad you seem to be even calling my words childish and “threatening” to block me periods don’t change arguments the actual words do I wasn’t mad you should be you wasted 2 hours of your life baiting people on a sub Reddit with 150k people so you wasted your life and I got a laugh out of you being salty about grammar so I say I won :)
---
salty survivor mains with any killer that counters them *looks at spirit and legion*
---
&gt;I play Trapper all the time and he absolutely needs some buffs.
---
&gt;It's insane that you need an addon to carry more than 1 trap at a time, have to sink so much time into collecting traps, can have your power completely disabled by survivors and it's complete RNG as to how quickly survivors can escape traps.
---
Don't get me wrong, I know Trapper needs some love, I am just merely confused about OP being the one suggesting said buffs without even playing the character.
---
its pretty fucking annoying to go the whole game and just not being able to save a teammate because they get downed and camped......everyone always says yeah just do totems but that's easier said than done to get every single totem on the map especially when we're trying to get gens done
---
Just get good
---
[Huntress main] I do abuse hitboxes, but even I could tell you that's bullshit. You shouldn't get hit by that, it like the hixboes on the generators all over again.
---
I would suggest tydetyme on YouTube he explains the game mechanics and looking the other YouTubers you got recommended are good but don't explain alot
---
I feel like the leatherface taunted deserves at least a little squeak at the end
---
Playing against spirit is always a coin flip. Sometimes the best you can do is to play like an absolute psychopath and be unpredictable. The best you can really do it make her job more difficult, and not give away any info for free. Run iron will to stop her from hearing you. Don't walk through the tall grass, since she can see it move. Be weary of running, as she can see the scratch marks while phasing.  
---
The only real juke you can do with spirit is to run towards a pallet, then start walking and switch directions. This won't do you much good near the edges of the map since you'll have fewer options, and the pallets/windows are usually farther apart. It's always a guessing game, so the best you can do is try to tip the odds more in your favor.
---
I'm going to be seriously pissed if another new killer will be nerfed quickly after the release just because of the few loud salty kids who can't be bothered with learning how to play against him.
---
Now don't get me wrong, if killer was seriously broken then sure, nerfs are fine. But Demogorgon isn't even close to being OP right now.
---
I think the dedi servers have really compounded the issue. The connection is just not stable and the game-states are just all over the place. The regular M1 lunge on the servers for any killer is absolute madness. No wonder people think he is ridiculous. 
---
Once he gets on the regular stable build and we're back to regular client-host, people will realise he's really not that much of a problem.
---
Oof that sucks but it's also really funny xD
---
Them? It's not multiple monsters. You don't need to use gender neutral pronouns for a fucking mystical monster. Just call it "it".
---
The old badham preschoolmap used to have a palletloop with some bushes on one side and literally one single tree on the other side. Prob the most useless pallet of all time.
---
It still directly counters Sloppy Butcher, though.
---
There is a shit ton of strategies you dont need perks for. I can chase a killer for 5 gens without perks, as long as they are actually a fun killer and not a spirit or a nurse (the worst designed killers funwise)
---
Reminds me of that pallet downstairs in the Temple of Purgation map.
---
Had to give my mans an award. I lol'd hard.
---
I have fun playing against her....
---
Excuse me sir, I require 1 "Big Enough" meme.
---
yeah ofc, but that doesnt happen every match with green ping.
---
green ping ~~=~~ green ping
---
Funny and original
---
He kinda looks like a velociraptor
---
Amazing.
---
Welcome to dedicated servers.  Where killers cant lag switch, but everyone lags like a battlefield server running at a 30 server tick rate.
---
I was working on a totem yesterday and a Demogorgon charged at me. His arm went through my head and didn't damage me. The hitbox is really not that big.
---
Damn I'm surprised how well the title worked
---
&gt;yeah ofc, but that doesnt happen every match with green ping.
---
&gt;green ping !=green ping
---
Except you are playing on dedicated servers and the ping is working differently there. Not even sure if it is working as it should. 
---
I give up. Apparently people just love to live in the ignorance.
---
i hope they dont nerf him im sick of only playing against spirit, billy and nurse i dont mind spirit and billy much but i want to face other killers and play other killers in high rank
---
shutting down 1 gameplay mechanic just cause it doesnt have eyes is absolutley stupid
---
so that means its unplayable on some servers, this laggy green ping servers happened to me 3 times from 20 games.
---
Not good, not terrible.
---
That happened to me when the killer picked me up ut it only lasted a few seconds.
---
Well dedicated servers come with the chapter
---
i leterally had someone who could vault a blocked of window indefinitely it even was a infinit window where i would loose line of sight and couldnt get bloodlust, and ofc after the match this one person said: ggez get rekt noob
---
Holly fuck
---
This, I've played way to many games where I had to find the hatch or lose because of people not knowing what they're doing. I'm tempted to start bringing wake up so I can open the doors but its just not a big enough boost to cut out a perk
---
lOl what kind of answer is this, everyone has his own motives :/
---
*Doubt*
---
Even those who got 3.500+ hrs into this game, aren't toxic at all and back their statements up?
---

---
Only if the killer acted like a douche
---
Ok? She’s really effective without being unstoppable and is fun to play against. It’s not like say Legion or the Clown where their powers are more annoying than anything.
---
Apply directly to the forehead. Now available at walgreens.
---
?
---
I am confused all they did was take hits and try too flashlight, did they do something  else that I didn't see.
---
Well, you can test it: look for numbers, not for a color. If every 40ms server plays good, and every 90ms server plays bad, you know you need to dodge lobbies until you get 40ms server. But if there are some good 40ms servers and some bad 40ms servers... then we have a problem
---
Keep crying child.
---
Had the same thing happen to me as the killer, lol
---
Dude just let if go. He baited you and a lot of other people on here to react angrily at his statement. You had good intentions but by continuing to post on this thread your only making yourself look like a fool because he is still baiting you and your gobbling it up. Their is nothing you can say or do to 'win' a debate with a troll because your both playing too different games and for a troll they win when you keep replying. Trust me no one but him is winning from this argument.
---
No need to guess, it is successful unless its the endgame. You know what is an unsuccessful time sink? Plague's power. It monumentally sucks that 1/2 of your power is locked by survivors refusing to cleanse unless you bring add-ons that start the game with pools already corrupted.
---
This might be part of your issue is my point.
---
It certainly does cause issues BUT this is something that;
---
-Has happened to others running decent PCs
---
-Has only happened to me on the PTB
---
Is there a face in the mouth?
---
Yee lol. It's a really stealthy survivor, hiding where the killer would least expect it.
---
Bloodweb rework that was promised - now you can spend points faster while playing already
---
Indeed it js
---
people who use those emotes are sub human
---
&gt; are really only asking for slight changes to the lunge like a little bit more cooldown for a missed attack or when canceling shred you get a slight cooldown. 
---
No.
---
Don't nerf him.  
---
Stop it.
---
It’s Claudette lol
---
Man the throat looks so weird it kinda looks like a face but in actuality it's probably just teeth
---
You're the one complaining when you didn't realize that PTB is on dedicated servers. You should probably just man up and apologize instead of continuing to be a jerk.
---
I mean, even people in this thread are asking for it.  
---
"I don't want him to get nerfed ... BUT ... I would like it if they add a bigger cooldown to his power, also a bigger cd to his power whenever he misses or interrupts it. ALSO  I would like it if -..."  
---
And I bet these aren't even from rank 20's.
---
Of course, but I imagine no one voluntarily plays without perks because it's more fun that way, right?  I just don't think games should start out incomplete, but I'm learning that for a lot of people that's a feature not a bug. The grind is "addictive" (compelling and good) rather than "addictive" (manipulative and cynical) for some.
---
I thought No0b invented all of the sound byte in his videos and the shocking revelation that he didn’t is currently making me go on a downvote spree AAAAAAAAAAA
---
Happy Cake Day
---
I stopped using DH on the PTB because it absolutely does not work. DH should be more effective on a centralized connection, not less. Spaghetti code strikes again.
---
Better idea.
---
Instead of a few hits to the back, hit once, where the spine ends and butt begins, throw your weapon next to them, rip their spine out (always the same model) and as you gain control back, have a bit of shine from the handle to the top, slowly turning it into the cosmetic you're currently wearing
---
Hex: Devour Toes
---
That's not very groovy of you
---
Its all good
---
Thank god you aren't a game dev. Something that has literally no counter play is not a good play, it's cheap and skilless.
---
You think points are the way the game is designed but it is opposite of that. The tasks you do are the one that determine how much points you get and it shouldn't matter because they are just a currency for people to unlock d things. The survivor's main objective is to do things so that they can open the doors and escape, doesn't matter how much points they gather.
---
I have seen so many killers get less than 15k points when they down the survivors quickly enough to hook all of them at the same time. Does this mean they are bad killers? By you telling that they didn't have their 15k you do say they are bad killers which is totally wrong.
---
thank you for your service
---
No you need to place a new one
---
I already can see the chat cursing at the killer
---
That's how it SHOULD work, but it doesn't. As far as I know, left click are client sided.
---

Why are you playing him like those killers then? It's not the same and you probably just dont know how to utilize the portals well. Billy and Demo are way different and Nurse and Demo are also way different. The comparisons dont add up.
---
Yeah, the explosives with the guy who was hooked with rings? That was an impossible escape. Same with the woman who got her ribcage ripped open, I believe
---
what is the killer is being toxic? Then the player should be able to mori the killer. Dont you think?
---
I play on console but I never bm killers or anyone unless they start it.
---
admitively the more i look at it, i am noticing im liking it more than the old one
---
her collision with survivors needs to be removed during phase walk
---
This is a month old post. You should contact DBD Support or make your own post. But make sure to verify your integrity.
---
Well this streamer, if we are talking about the same person here, was completely right.  
---
They introduced Plague. She was fine on the PTB.  
---
Then they nerfed her while releasing her. (She gets a movement penalty while loading up her vomit spray).  
---
Now she's unable to compete against top tier survivors.  
---
They introduced Legion. He went from shit to being ... well. Shit. I don't want to say that they nerfed him. They basically just reworked Trash into other Trash.  
---
They introduced Ghostface. And he went from a a funny killer that might have been able to compete with myers (who isn't able to compete with top tier survivor players to begin with) to trash.  
---
They took him and gutted him.  
---
And I like how "lots of entitlet survivor mains" on this subreddit said:  
---
"It isn't a nerf when they rework his toolkit to work as intended" ... even though it made him a lot weaker.
---
New Freddy is viable? Well on yellow to green ranks, sure.
---
Demogorgon solid? How can you even say that? He just gets looped like everyone else. And his perks allready got hit by a slight nerf.
---
I am a killer main. I stopped playing this game like 3 months ago but honestly: Those are the things that scared me.  
---
Every killer that seemed slightly viable got gutted after survivors screamed for a nerf. I don't know if they nerfed them because of these babies, or if they would have done it even without it.  
---
But I just can't stand it.
---
Give us some new strong killer that can compete with top tier survivors and nurse and spirit. Please.  
---
It's so petty that every killer turns out to be a meme build at best with perks that are just shit. At this point I even think that they are scared of releasing strong killers.
---
nope and i dont really see it happening
---
From what I know, some games already do exactly what I described here for exactly the same reasons
---
Same I guess because if the killer starts to be a toxic player I will join in and throw his toxicity back
---
Well the devs announced it a while ago and I'm just left here uninformed
---
&gt; They should get better ones like For honor did.
---
It's not about hardware, it's about their code being bad.
---
Just reading that killed 20 of my brain cells.
---
Mikey boi 101
---
You...you tried. I'll give you that. No one can fault you for that.
---
The spirit goes WAAH!
---
Well, looping for 5 minutes only to get decisive strike and see generators pop like crazy, this is worse than mori
---
&gt; There are indie games more polished than this.
---
With the same amount of content? With a new DLC every now and then? It's way easier to polish a small game when you don't add new maps/models/mechanics etc.
---
&gt;Aaaand? These dedicated servers are shit, 62ms and it runs like that. What the hell is wrong with you? They should get better ones like For honor did.
---
Wow, its almost like they are currently having another PTB regarding servers to see how they in practice before actually releasing them. 
---
First PTB with servers they wanted feedback to see which regions needed servers and how the servers available at the date would work with nearby players.
---
Second PTB with servers I didn't bother trying and the current PTB looks like they added more locations or improved the existing servers from March.
---
"Just add good servers, lol" "BHVR such incompetent" 
---
I am the one asking what is wrong with you. You didn't even know servers were active and came to reddit to complain about a very late dead hard that often won't work even with 60ms.
---

thanks

*Laughs in PalletHaven*
---
I don't get why people are against Spirit and not Nurse. Is not like you're facing a Ring+Beads Spirit everytime. I only use those add ons on Blendettes. Nurses cuts loops, pallets, chases and every rule on this game. But yeah, damn spirits.
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
&gt; Left behind was less than useless. It was completely unusable. Only now are they addressing it.
---
If they don't fix something, they are bad. If they fix something, they are still just as bad because they didn't fix sooner?
---
Jeez.
---
New killer: The Thing
---
Just scroll a bit further in reddit you proberbly will also find a post about that(:
---
Also the reason it's spaced out and looks weird is because I'm on mobile and I can't find out how to make into paragraphs(my phone's janky I apologise)
---
Entity's like "say goodbye to your mama I'm your new mama now"
---
It's great, but I have no idea how they've got away with it for this long
---
If you have darkened traps most of the time they will run into it. They are not used to checking the ground I'd guess and run straight to the switch for those extra BP.
---
SNAP!
---
Do you add chrome to a broken down car? No. You fix the car, then make it look good. It took us a year to get out of the "dark times" and it was painful to be a part of.
---
At least with nurse you cant just stay still to win
---
Bites the dust, detonate!
---
This isn’t Facebook...
---
Well done!... Now do this one hundred times more, exactly same way with nothing but numbers increasing and decreasing.
---
That’s*
---
Tysm!! &lt;3
---
I would argue about being a dick. Looks more to me like a pretty normal "game over" happy pig. Game overs are rare, most of pigs get exited over them, and some pigs try to pull off 4 man game over. Looking at that post, survivors must be breaking furniture when 4 man game over happens.
---
you may want to \~\~cross it out\~\~ by putting ~~'s around it so people don't misunderstand ♥
---
I take it it’s not been out long?? It looks like an old game
---
I’m rank 3 on console and have been for most of this entire season. I play a lot. I see ghost face at least 5 times every day, if not more. Most of the killers are Billy/Spirit/Ghostface. 
---
However, it’s pretty rare you see Plauge, but I do see her more often than the clown.
---
Thank you
---
Yea true but there already so many unsafe pallets
---
Absolutely agree, none are even approaching meta, especially for survivors 
---
No idea why everyone is jumping on their dick
---
It's annoying mostly around rank reset. I don't play as much as I used to, so I tend to drop into lower ranks where every killer has NOED. I'm not the best at totems so I take Small Game and cleanse every totem I see but there's always one tucked away somewhere that I thought my teammates cleansed because I can't find it even with Small Game. It's frustrating then but usually I can get out before I get smacked.
---
It is quiet good but wont really do much while you get looped, more before you get looped. The teleport could use a little buff tho
---
First of all, I think some of DbD problems just can't be fixed without full redesign/rewriting of the game. So, won't happen.
---
And second, game will die, if devs will decide to stop producing new content for 6+ months.
---
I know what kills killers, toxic survivors
---
Two or less stacks at DH gang report here
---
Well, crouch doesn't start a CHASE. If you start crouching in a chase, timer not gonna start ticking all of a sadden.
---
damn it, demi! not again!
---
Nurse is unfair with her add-ons (Range addons, 3 blinks+)not her power. Spirit has a really strong add-on and her power can be a bit unfair. Like unless you're running iron will or fixated you're going to have a bad time.
---
Entity: hey can I have this?
---
Mind flayer: ummm n-
---
Entity: k thanks
---
*Takes a demogorgon*
---
Too back you can't have jigsaw boxes in a basement.
---
It was less than 4 minutes!
---
Exactly it's great when not getting looped (besides windows trying to loop using Windows is just asking to get hit) but bad when getting looped(unless it's a straight loop that's mindgamable) and I personally feel the portals are fine as you can get great mobility and camp both exits greatly
---
Maybe even less than that.
---
I mean, hey, if people love going against Nurse and Spirit and every game, then they’re more than freely to do so. Lmao
---
I get your point but ds is only if you tunnel.
---
maybe instead go to a other player. and 5 chase also cancels the ds. they are just surviving cant be mad at that. And I get you because I play killer also and it irritates me the f when the gen rush but what are they supposed to do? The teabag thing that's toxic because it doenst help them. But gen rush that's just something we had killer need to do something about.
---
Yamete
---
So... No one escapes death confirmed?
---
That is freaky good man.
---
I think you misread the comment. Survivors should get compensated for other survivors DCing, because, it means:
---
- less unhook/co-op/heal points
---
- game becomes fast-paced, hence you can't just do gens and get points from it since it's a 3v1. 
---
This post isn't about killer dcing.
---
Well thats just a addon rework not a full on killer rework
---
I never said "full on rework" or "overhaul"
---
Meanwhile last night on this reddit it was killer main complaining about him saying things like "His lung is wonky" because they don't know how to aim his lung lol
---
as a surv, i don't anyone to touch Demo &lt;3!! 
---
HE IS FUCKING PERFECT AND I LOVE HIM \~!! Glad i'm not the only one who can see he doesn't need a nerf at all. LEAVE DEMO ALONE
---
yes, but just his face
---
Survivor: Sure, it feels like shit to get hit by it but technically it's your fault for not taking out all the totems.
---
Killer: Really helpful especially when you're getting genrushed
---
it's not yet confirmed, but they might try to get the agreement
---
I mean, it's Nurse.
---
I usually don’t play her this well lol
---
You're
---
True alpha
---
Prepare to receive a lot of hate if you decide to play her more often.
---
at first i thought it was a gachi reference
---
I have a ponytail on Meg Thomas, and whenever I escape or die or whatever (when I'm running on the end of game screen) her ponytail gets stretched out and spins around
---
You’re so damn wrong. In high red ranks, surv know how to bamboozle even a good Spirit when they are not injured, and often run Iron Will.
---
However, (and here i talk as a rank 1 Nurse) nurse with no add-ons in good hands is literally unstoppable. All add-ons are useless or even detrimental (3rd blink is rarely useful, and push learning Nurse to be greedy, range add-ons can be useful, but are far from necessary and you need a few games to adapt. IMO her best add-ons are the blink speed ones, they help you get where you aim a lil faster, and it can be the whole difference sometimes, but it’s not that useful overall.
---
Nurse is absolutely OP in good hands.
---
Spirit is strong, and can turn unfair with some Add-ons and strategy, but nowhere as unstoppable as Nurse.
---
Poor solo survivor will get chat burned for not helping them LOL
---
Assuming blackbelt doesn't make the killer drop you, these are incredibly good
---
Well done kiddo
---
Now your talking
---
Ikr
---
&gt; how long have you been playing this game? Because if it's been awhile you have VERY selective memory. It took 2 YEARS for dstrike to get "reworked" and it hasn't really changed its selection rate.
---
Nurse and billy with broken add ons and ebony moris have been in the game before DS even got added, so I don't really see your point there. At least DS got reworked, the other guys have been pretty much the same since forever.
---
&gt;You talk about broken addons but forget conviently about brand new part pre-nerfs, sabotage pre-nerfs, original infinite loops, pallet teleports, permanent sabotage, pre-nerf self-care, pre-nerf exhaustion perks, pre-nerf sprint burst
---
You don't see a pattern here? All of those things have been nerfed and they are fine now, some of them are even pretty weak. The things I've mentioned haven't :\
---
Because you can activate it when you see the survivor going towards a pallet to loop which makes them run to bad spots instead to avoid getting hit by the shred attack. Then you cancel it and lunge at them instead.
---
If you don't get the stun with that one, you're 100% going in the basement.
---
*in a high voice* Bruuuuh this is deeeep
---
Tbh its not less of a mindgame than Spirit's power, and I feel like adding a cooldown would just make him like Doctor when he switches modes
---
You're 360ing a low rank killer on console, calm down, buddy.
---
I hope the real actor did all of those. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Now thats a bold post on this r/ looking forward to seeing the debates. Gets an upvote from me tho.
---
i honestly think legion could have a pretty interesting thriller/psychological horror going. different members of F.J.S.J basically hiding in plain sight, constantly putting the viewer on edge. I personally think the best horror comes from cold reality, and the legion has plenty of that going for them
---
is he not verified? or is this a fake tweet?
---
Wtf is wrong with you micheal is best
---
I like moris. When the killer uses one on me I always feel special. It gives them personality and I find it much less boring than being left on the hook by incompetent teammates. Gets me into a new match faster.
---
I also think they make the game scarier and add much-needed tension. Will the killer play The Entity objective for more points? Or will they give in to anger or bloodlust and straight up kill you while you're down? Originally That was supposed to be the option but they added it as an offering due to being considered frustrating and overpowered... Killers originally could kill you whenever they want or hook you for more points and rank progress, hence why Hooks could be sabotaged forever and The Killers felt so weak when the game first launched. A key feature was removed initially.
---
Either way. I love going against a killer with a Mori or being rancor. I know that's an unpopular opinion but there are some of my favorite matches in the game. So intense and feeling like the Killer is truly stronger than me.
---
The legion
---
killers get hungry to
---
besides
---
now i can say
---
ELECTRIC WAFFLE'S
---
ELECTRIC FREAKING WAFFLE'S!
---
I AM SO UNLUCKY 8 OUT OF 10 KILLERS FACECAMP UNTILL I DIE ON HOOK. BUT WHEN I PLAY KILLER I TRY TO PLAY FAIR (ALMOST EVERYONE ESCAPES AND THEN THEY LAUGH) SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY.
---
Demogorgon is scary af and it feels good to dodge his shred attack. He's very enjoyable to play against imo
---
You should switch to singleplayer games
---
Well I agree and disagree. New players are supposed to lose often and learn from failure or mistakes. But you honestly can't expect that the game should only be the players who have been on since launch or enjoy the original killers. The whole idea behind the licensed characters is drawing more players in. Love it or hate it... We always need more players and hopefully a lot of them stay around for years to come. Can't really complain about slow matchmaking if people like you try to push new players away every time the game blows up because of a license DLC.
---
the spirit: nvm fuck that
---
Sometimes you gotta bite the bullet and accept you're gonna lose, especially if you decide you wanna level someone new and you get to a medium/high rank with another character.
---
When the one good looper on the team is booking their ticket to facecampville
---
Don’t think.
---
Why wouldn’t you let him pick you up
---
I can say from my experience that I have fun playing against the Spirit and I find her pretty easy to counter most of the time as long as she isn't running the Mother-Daughter Ring and Prayer Beads add-ons.
---
The problem is that you get those add-ons way too often not to mention the 50 White Wards you have laying around.
---
Source: *am Spirit main*
---
Hey! :(
---
if i can do it then a demogorgan should be able to do it
---
game on demogorgan game on
---
Yea I don't get the hype really it's only good on certain map tiles but most make the shred absolutely useless it's only good when a survivors running away in a straight like a dummy or vaulting a window in shred range. It's really strong on Hawkins though I have to admit because it has long tiny areas making it great but besides that it's mediorce
---
Of course you did. There will always be players who are just jerks themselves or they may be having a bad day, or maybe you did something you didn't realize was a jerk move. That still doesn't justify being as low as them.
---
The sad truth is that doctors wear crocs in the clinics. I am not joking
---
Hair doesn't look this bad on low settings in the live build...so no?
---
Thank you... It was just to much to handle for me.... 😭
---
At least you got one MoM stack
---
The screenshot real i FOUND this tweet
---
Sorry I didn't mean it, I just think Quentin is getting a lot of shit for being ugly.
---
Like maybe a perk that can apply ruin effect for injured/exhausted survivors, and ruin-type effects can't stack
---
that is what it would look like
---
The Spirit is best girl
---
I was running a small loop against them, and they charged up their lunge attack and it was terrifying as hell running for my life around a small box while this Demogorgon, face completely open was right there
---
Devs are trying to make every new map like Springwood from now on. Pallets spawn at 8m distance minimum but the majority are unsafe. The only good loop there that I could see is the hole/stairs room.
---
Nurse mains be like : *yea get him*
---
I haven't played in a few year's and yes he is strong but I don't feel like he need's a Nerf just need's to be figured out. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
U right
---
I can say the exact same thing for your whole thread. So.. we're done here? Good
---
I was thinking proximity because irl you can’t talk from meters away without some sort of device or just shouting, you gotta be next to each other. SWF can just form a party chat, but solo queue proximity chat would make communication easier and still have most of the risks while playing alone. I get where you’re coming from though.
---
Thought i was gonna main nancy but then i saw the new kate cosmetics
---
STBFL only works for M1 hits while PWYF for any offensive hit. So you should lose a token if you use Of the Abyss with PWYF.
---
I tried earlier but he wouldn’t, the other survivors tried to
---
Wow Nancy Drew calm down
---
It’s the best chapter because we got a new map that’s pretty detailed and a new killer who isn’t human, good perks for killer and survivors and 2 new survivors with cosmetics being released very soon, I don’t really like stranger things but we got all this new content just for one chapter
---
or it's just an awfully balanced game for high ranks.
---
but according to your logic, anything worse than nurse is underpowered so literally every killer is underpowered which would also be awful balance
---
Barrel bois for sure
---
Frank doesn't have a daddy bone in his whole twink body.
---
Well it counter spirit pretty hard as most spirits use breathing as a way to find survivors and it makes loud survivors quiet meaning if you're sneaking you won't get caught if they try to hear breathing. I'd say run it in your build to see if it's worth using no Hurt in trying new things
---
It’s not very impressive with spirit.  However it’s still a milestone to be proud of, gj keep it up!
---
weakest: davids and megs
---
strongest: dwights with a skin and laurie's
---
AREN'T I SEPOSED TO BE THE KILLER?!: nea and claudete's (these 2 they scare me when they got the p3 skin)
---
It depends on who you play, if you wanna play Jeff or bill then yea, it’s absolutely worth taking, but if you play someone more quiet like ace or tapp, then you would rather keep you’re current build
---
You literally have to run a very specific set of perks in order to even have a chance. That's not fun, it's annoying.
---
That is so bullshit
---
That is indeed what I'm implying.
---
That and his perks are a trashfire.
---
*seriously though* ***24*** *meters?!*
---
Great job! Hey just so you know in red ranks you have to get that in order to double Pip.
---
Are you legit throwing shade on the Biker Kate set, or did you just see an opportunity to meme about the second outfit? Because I 100% switched mains for Biker Kate. I started spending all my BP on her when the set and renders leaked like a month ago.
---
Ya know, I never realized how subjective fun is before I played DBD.  I have a ton of fun versing most Spirits.  I'll grant you that Prayer Beads are blech, but matches without them are pretty fun.
---
DbD community: 
---
Ace- Good
---
CLAUDETTE- E V I L 
---
(I too main a healer Claudette, but when I play as killer, it is usually Claudettes that does the tagging.)
---
He wasn't made to tunnel, he was made to use Make Your Choice and kill the rescuer while using Devour Hope, till all 4 survivors die :)
---
Really? I find it very easy to hit survivors anf the killer shack as Demo.
---
Or pretty much every single pallet and window in the new map on the PTB
---
Legion. That would be amazing. Imagine the good guy works in a diner and sees on the news that there had been attacks by a teen. And then he would start seeing different people outside the diner that were in the legion.
---
Matter of opinion.  I find her extremely fun to verse as long as we're not talking Prayer Beads.
---
Seriously? Crying about Spirit? She’s great but holy shit is Nurse way stronger and more cheap. Killer mains need amazing killers and survivors need some amazing perks, we’ve got both. I’ve never seen spirit clap 4 great survivors either, but nurse can do that with no add ons
---
Yeah people just post these memes for every killer for some reason.
---
I use it, but I sometimes get caught uiding from the scratch marks
---
That's suuuuckkkkkks
---
BHVR has a bad habit of making perks for other killers in mind. Plague, GF, Demo and Spirit all have one or two perks that other killers just love dearly but they themselves are neutral on. Demo has perks stealth killers will drool over but on him he’s okay because he has a stealth aspect.
---
If your aiming this at me your completely wrong I always cleanse totems when I see them 
---
And I’m looking st this from a neutral view so I’m not hating it or rooting for it so watch what u say before jumping to conclusions
---
I disagree.
---
I've always, and forever, will have an easier time with an OMEGAblink Legacy P3 Nurse than I will with a Spirit. 
---
This game literally depends on predictability and mindgames, and that's where Spirit excels over Nurse. Once the Nurse charges up her blink, she's forced to use it, and if you're a good survivor you'll just run around anything you see and it's easy enough to mindgame even an amazing Nurse player.
---
A spirit though? Unless you ARE running iron will, you're not winning that chase if the Spirit is good.  Iron Will top tier tho. So there's that for us Survivors atleast.
---
From my experience with the game, I think Prayer Beads Spirit is the best in the game, and is also the most unfun thing too.
---
Only thing better than Spirit is Omegablink and that's my opinion. Maybe it's because I have a harder time against spirit, but she's way more irritating and frustrating to play against than The Nurse. Breaking LOS against Nurse even mid-charge destroys her.
---
This is so sad to see. People who say "Gen Rushing is toxic" are one of the many reasons this game has a bad reputation.  
---
Not gonna lie, I used to find it funny when Killer's DC. Mainly because getting 5k BP no matter if the killer just quit the game via the PS App or just in game gave you the points. Now its a God damn gamble and more often then not I wind up with nothing.  
---
Now whenever a killer DC's, I will genuinely report them using the in game report feature and genuinely send them a message telling them they could of just left the game via the pause menu to give us all 5k. But nooooooooo. Cause  doing the damn objective is toxic nowadays.  
---
Jesus Christ...
---
They got the commando pro perk
---
nah, they actually do gens as 3 lmao
---
Read that all again slowly, sport.
---
I like the idea would be excellent for the next dlc would be expensive for BHVR. I still think we will get a werewolf killer with a deep forest or graveyard map.
---
Did you not ask for ppls opinions?
---
Nurse's best add-ons are her range ones, they improve everything about nurse, and increase her blink speed. Ssswhy it's called omega-blink.
---
&gt; (Imagine if he could go through windows and over pallets with the lunge... oh lawd).
---
You mean like the Nurse huh? Puts the Nurse into perspective quite well.
---
Because any object she has to blink through is a mindgame battle with her that can be won if you're good, and lost if you're bad?
---
Where as Spirit it's praying she doesn't have an OP add on, half the match the Killer standing still and Survivors walking right into her, and just all in all an annoying and irritating thing.
---
Atleast you can tell when the Nurse charges her blink and be prepared for impact lol
---
Which is why they put this stuff on the PTB, you're literally beta testing it right now so don't complain when its not perfect
---
HAHA I have a key and left behind
---
Man when you got pulled back there, its almost as if the game was telling you "Ah ah ah Kiddo! You're having a LITTLE too much fun there winning. Lets fix that! \*Schluuuuuuuurlp\* There! Much better!"
---
I wish I was as optimistic as you. Cuz with a pitiful 24 meter range, both Cruel Limits and surge is more or less worthless as on most maps that'll tag very few windows/gens. Also lets not forget how buggy the blockers are.
---
Mindbreaker as well is mostly worthless. As very few people run SB anymore. People seriously overvalue mindbreak.
---
Well, I was playing against this camping Bubba with Franklins and I got a red key from the basement like Monto. I lost the key a couple of times saving teammates and such, and while the last survivor and I were getting to the exit gates, I found the hatch and tried to show him. But Bubba found us, and that last survivor, Adam, t-bagged Bubba for camping everyone hard, but instead of hitting him, he hit me with my key :( I wasn't even the one tbagging, but at least all the survivors made it out. :)
---
yea maybe at rank 10 lmao
---
Use okay with your food
---
Nea's face is pretty bad.
---
[*_*] oh sh!t
---
Mmmm survivor salt seasons my killer’s stake very nicely ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Legion has eyeholes in his mask
---
Let’s say I’m already injured
---
Well I normally run ooo and iron will, so I'd say she is
---
Yeah but you know what the difference is? Skill. Nurse takes forever to play effectively. You simply do not see nurses at green ranks, because people aren't as experienced here. Meanwhile, at least ever third game is a spirit, half of which have prayer beads. And they regularly get 4ks. Is the nurse OP? In the right hands, maybe. Is the spirit OP? No, but playing her is low-risk, high-reward and requires very little skill.
---
Yes, he still wasn't made for that, and if survivors will hate him for something, is for Make Your Choice
---
I mean if you take into account all the content it’s getting, plus the fact that the killer seems (at minimum) relatively decent, what chapter honestly beats it?
---
r/ihadastroke and also very cool art
---
I KILL THOSE PEOPLE THEN NOD TO THE LOCKER
---
Yeah but they're tiny like really tiny
---
Ight 
---
Imma head out
---
Honestly I recently started running it and for me it's an S tier perk I run it with DS, Borrowed and Balanced. It's extremely helpful against Spirit, very good against Nurse and  good against every other killer (except Plague). The amount of killers I managed to juke thanks to this perk is insane.
---
They said that they'll do something with Nurse first so you have to wait
---
He doesn't have "unlimited" portals?
---
Honestly, I think it more stems from the fact that DBD Quentin looks like an entirely different person from the movie counterpart - even if you don't mind how he looks in DBD, it looks like they didn't even try to make it look accurate beyond hair and eye colour. Maybe I'm just a stickler for consistency like that, but it bothered me BIG TIME xD
---
its mettle thats what he was talking about lol
---
Oh don't worry. Therevs always this one guy who cleanses, srewing his entire team over.
---
But you can immediately attack since he isn’t cloaked. But your red stain is still there.
---
Bubba is the worst killer in the game (on average)
---
You really need a specific build and knowledge on how to use them to have some success with this guy.
---
No, only 6 for the whole match.
---
Okay With Your Food is the best perk

Yea that’s what I’m talking about, I’m saying that metal of man is one of ashes perks
---
and very close to their face, making them not so tiny anymore
---
alright fine. I remember in some older videos you could see her face, and it actually looked *good* now idk what BHVR did but she needs her old face :(
---
yeah but its *mettle* of man not *metal* of man
---
"The best chapter yet"
---
I don't think so
---
Oh ok
---
See now that's just a dumb argument.
---
The point is that the way the game is built, you're rewarded for participating in all the different aspects of the match. Yeah, do fucking totems, that's why noed exists, so that you have a reason to do them because it's still an "objective" that gives you security that once the gates are powered you can still make it out.
---
On the opposite side, you then compare it to a killer only hitting people, 100% removing the sacrifice bloodpoints from the category. Them hooking you is still playing the game to it's fullest, where 3 people injured on gens ignoring that healing is an aspect that the game and many perks are balanced around even exists, then they complain when someone hits them down in one shot after adrenaline, because "we were just doing our objective and ignoring everything else, how dare you use a perk designed to punish laziness!" us just dumb.
---
Or even better, then they go onto forums to say that they need more stuff to do because "just holding M1 on a gen isn't fun!" Well hey, maybe that's why there's more to a game than just doing gens?
---
Good job, dont let anyone tell you who to Play or not
---
What FPS / refresh rate / in-game settings / resolution are you getting on each? 
---
What temps &amp; useage are you getting on your CPU/GPU's when this happens?
---
Have you made any changes to GsmeUserSettings.ini?
---
When you and the other person who has the same skin as you find each other
---
Thats why i always run object of obsession. Never have to wonder who the killer is
---
Every pallet in Hawkins
---
Bruh chillax, no need to bully people because of their choices :/
---
You're just arguing for the sake of arguing. You left out all the other 3 examples and choose the only exception. Bruh
---
looks like youre one of those who really like handholding, he?
---
r/cursedimages
---
I'm kinda happy they included his sleep deprevation. It is part of his character
---
If the cosmetic comes with a Zweihänder its an instant buy. Instead of running away all the time, you just stand there with your huge Zweihänder swinging at the killer, trying hard to land a hit, because you can't see shit with that Knight Full Helmet on your head.
---
there also are some pallets that are the most unsafe pallets in the game. There's this one, small room which has one enterance and a pallet inside, which traps you in the room with the killer if you drop it.
---
You are everything that's wrong with this game's community.
---
no peripheral
---
Yeah, looks like entity doesn't like queen Meg (ಠ‸ಠ)
---
Doctor would be my number 2!
---
Someone made a long post here yesterday explaining why it's not that easy and why it'll lokely never happen.
---
Hell yeah!!
---
Darn, no more p3 tweaker mains
---
Better take advice from my flair.
---
FACTS
---
It's capped at 3 seconds or it increases 3s of exhaustion per second of real time while you do gens? If it's capped at 3 seconds it's worthless lol. If not - it really disables Lithe, BL, DH too so it sounds fine
---
I have v sync on so it’s capped at 60. Monitor is 144hz without Gsync. Low graphics settings. Cpu temps Max 65. Gpu max 45.
---
The only thing survivors are missing is perks to counter bad team mates. Killers have the advantage of only having to rely on themselves, but as survivor, whether the match goes good or bad, you really only have control over like 25% of it
---
Ghostface got nerfed? I thought the only things people complained about him was his buggy detection which frustrated both sides
---
No it’s not back.
---
Lag or de sync for sure.
---
The Nurse is still better than the spirit. Nurse can literally go through walls and floors.
---
Not confirmed, the actor and BHVR might want to but the license holders agreed to this version of Quention, they'll need to give their approval for a rework
---
I NEED a ebony mori
---
It can work very well those who prefer a stealthier playing style.
---
Very noice. bUt ITs tOo OP!!!!1!! pLZ nERf
---
Can you really not blind the demogorgon?
---
He got nerfed after his buff right before he came out.
---
Well, I was talking about how people are excited for the rework - they might not have licenses for the likeness, but they could at least make him look more like a soft twunk guy than Gollum. I, personally, wouldn't mind if they made an effort to make Quentin look.... Somewhat like Quentin, even if it wasn't 100% accurate, but they didn't. He looks more like one of my grandparents than a 17 year old whose gone without sleep for god-knows-how-long.
---
Spirit bad
---
Rc bad
---
Swamp man good
---
You aren't much of a Nurse main from your comments. Range add-ons are inarguably her best add-ons, no ifs, ands or buts about it.
---
People hate Spirit because she gives absolutely zero feedback. Standing still or phasing, you don't know. She holds absolutely all the power in the chase and makes the Survivors hope she doesn't phase right on top of them. Turn your volume up to even 50 and that should be a guarantee when playing Spirit.
---
Can she be beat? Yeah. Every killer can be beat against 4 good survivors who spread out. But that doesn't change the fact that her power embodies the word "unfair". Killers need to be strong, but they need to have counterplay, to which Spirit has none.
---
Sometimes it's not about winning. It's about the principle.
---
Meg's neck is stiff which is why she constantly turns her head
---
I love everything in this chapter.
---
The map is amazing as well and feels unique unlike everything else which can feel very similar to each other (and feels 'generic') with the recycled assets. Take the exit gate on the new map for example. When I first saw it I forgot I was playing DbD, I thought: oh cool this is the exit, too bad you can't go out. Then I remembered I was playing DbD. It had the same exit gate as the others but it is well hidden and well 'painted on' with ST stuff. There's also the vault spots which blend in really well and don't feel tacked on for gameplay. There's also a lot of fun little details and different areas that you can actually go to like the staircase that you can actually go to and vault over. It would be nice if there were different pallet and generator graphics as well but I understand that they don't really have enough resources for that.
---
Well, blinding him really makes no sense as he LITERALLY has no eyes, while killers you've shown have eyes and can be blinded
---
It's pretty much just Iron Will, and besides, why would you run perks that do well against Killers that aren't played often at Rank 1? Wouldn't you rather run things that counter the Killers that are played the most up there? (Nurse, Billy, and Spirit) Stuff like Dead Hard, Iron Will and Quick &amp; Quiet help quite a bit against Nurse and Spirit.
---
Why tunnel vision is a principle?
---
I saw fungoose say that you could use his lunge to travel faster than just walk. That's strange to me.
---
Also from what I saw his lunge looks like a low risk high reward move, and that's not good.
---
But I haven't played the ptb myself cause I'm on console. And the way I see people haven't had the time to get used to counter him yet.
---
I would prefer a longer time to experience him before a Nerf.
---
Also, he can trap exit gates at end game and actually patrol both exit gates. That looks damn strong.
---
He seems like a very frightening killer to oppose and I'm anxious to play against him.
---
you guys always complain about camping, i really really wanna see you play at red ranks ..you problably wouldn't even get a safe pip
---
YOU NEED to camp and tunnel one person at least, or it's mathematically impossible to win . The only condition where you win is when survivors are AWFUL and can't loop you for more than 10 seconds.
---
Lol every killer main has to deal with that too buddy, why do u think u see the same perks ALL THE TIME, ever heard of ruin? We’re not doing it to piss u off its to survive
---
Eh. Stranger Thongs have happened.
---
r/rorikroll
---
this would make the result unreliable too. If you deactivate items but not the addons, the balance is even more offset. Also, they kinda need to check item interact correctly with the new killer, perks, add on and other stuff...
---
Remember when freddy had a complete immunity to flashlight ? With a PTB, this would have been pointed out earlier, and never been in the actual build. If you take the items out of the PTB, those kind of bugs just go right under the radar too.
---
Or people hate her because this is a PvP game. PvP games are supposed to give players feedback from their opponents in order to counterplay it. How much feedback does Spirit give to the survivor?
---
Couldn’t agree anymore. Hate the way people say the dash is too op. But nurse blinking cross map through walls and having control is fine. Like what is balance to some people. Either way I don’t think he’ll get nerfed, he needs a buff. Because most games the DEMOGORGON is losing with like 1kill max against average survivors.
---
Me watching the killer DC because I cleansed all the dull totems with small game
---
That would be overpowered
---
In the stranger things lore, the demogorgon and other upside-down characters are sensitive to light anyway.
---
The dedicated servers aren’t that good in the ptb so i hope they get better when it releases for real.
---
Maybe when played by two potatoes, spirit is a good bit easier than nurse
---
You can, people just say it for the memes.
---
r/raimimemes
---
Fun? You have fun against watching the Killer stand still until she either phases right on top of you or you try to """"mindgame"""" her husk and you find out she was never phasing? Yeah, I have fun watching paint dry, too.
---
Capped. If you get on a gen while exhausted itll pause the timer which I guess is fine, but if you dont have exhaustion itll exhaust you and give you a 3 second exhaust when you let go.
---
Its garbobeans my dude.
---
*Scratched Mirror Myers crying in the distance*
---
because games are not fun as m1 killers, people after 4 fucking years realized the only objective are generators and so game end in less than 5 minutes which makes it impossible for the killer to rank up. if survivors are decent enough to know where the pallets are, that's enough to make a killer lose. Survivors have it soooo easy, i have the most relaxing games when i play suvivor, while killer have to manage an entire map and sweat their ass off
---
I need this perk but i feel like we should either only be invisible or invulnerable
---
If spirit is clapping your cheeks at green ranks, you gotta get better. I’m still pretty new but even purple spirits aren’t much of an issue without beads, and I honestly see beads on less than half of the spirits. 
---
Beads does need a nerf, but spirit is completely fine.
---
So you wanna do a Joey Legion render for me? :) &lt;3
---
Nice job editing your comment pal. Also, Who said anything about tunneling.
---
It's the principle of proving to yourself that you can do it. It becomes something more than just winning.
---
Its going to be unfun to play against. Im a spinechill gen cockroach and they wont ever be able to catch me at gen period
---
Invulnerable** not unvulnerable.
---
That would have the opposite effect of what your after lol
---
I’m the 500th upvote🙂
---
I love spirit. She got me into playing killer a lot. She’s super fun to play. I only run beads if it’s swf
---
Sorry, my bad
---
I’m a rank one/two player and the Spirit is much harder to play against. With the Spirit you literally have to run certain perks and there’s no mind-gaming only guessing. At least with the Nurse I know when she is using her power and have a chance to mind-game her. With Spirit it’s just the killer standing still either faking so you get close enough to her or she just hits because I’m not running iron will.
---
Thank you.
---
Same except I run Bloodwarden
---
DBD has hit  politics level point where people are making fake news and manufactured outrage.
---
Good job, community
---
I wanted to make something that was more focused on the Xenomorph from the first movie since that's when it seems to be at its strongest and weirdly similar to DBD with how it acts, seeing as everyone on the station is relatively helpless against it, excluding our girl Ripley of course. I wanted the alien to be really good at maintaining pressure on some but not all of the survivors, which is why the pounce doesn't instantly down them and instead does deep wound, and the heavy penalty for missing or getting stunned ensures that it doesn't apply too much pressure.
---
no? he's meant to chainsaw so he can get one at least
---
Do you recall off the top of your head what the nerf was? Otherwise I can just look at the change log
---
You are new to humor it seems! Welcome! Try to get your first joke ;)
---
Seems the bait caught a lot of fish.
---
Honestly, I feel Gorgi (I'm calling him that now) is an M1 killer with a few tricks up his... sleeves...?
---
He's got chase ending potential, map pressure and mobility. And all of those attributes can be mitigated by survivors. Now hear me out, the lunge only goes in a straight line, survivors can go through a window or swerve left or right. The portals can be destroyed by survivors, but once Gorgi starts moving to said portal because of the killer instinct, he can stop said portal from being removed. 
---
Gorgi can patrol both gates in a similar way that Billy and Nurse can patrol them, but Nurse and Gorgi have the advantage over Billy depending on the map.
---
I think survivors should automatically get a buff simmilar to wake up when that happens. 95% of the time you will die.
---
That’s not true. The entire time the red stain is still there. Also stalking only raises your blood points at times like this.
---
Every game is like 50k BP if you play killer with BBQ&amp;C
---
It's ok, I'm not usually a spelling stickler but this was an ez mix up
---
It looks like the throat go up not down
---
Combine with sprint burst, spine chill, and ironwill.  
---
Half the killers gonna quit the game
---
&gt;a horror game?
---
lol
---
This is exactly what happened to me a few days ago
---
Just part of the balance of the perk. We really don't need to be buffing sprint burst.
---
Its fake
---
There's no charm she looks like fucking shit those she has an alternative cosmetic that looks pretty good
---
Oh I forgot about that shitty aspect too.
---
So yay now Moris are more common and add ons aren't... literally no one wanted that
---
Yes/no.
---
If you're grinding through bloodwebs for prestige or perks, it's not enough. That's true.
---
But if you're perked out on your survivor you dont really need it (bare with me here).
---
Survivors have the potential to carry out items and addons, as well as finding new items and addons in maps if they perk for it. Killers need the blood points (depending on the killer of course) to stay competitive.
---
Plus, I mean, killer queues are a thing so it all probably is a wash if you calculated blood points a minute. *shrugs*
---
Ah ok thanks. Sorry for that round
---
Also, nancy was running after me at some point. With the loud grunts you'd think she was injured but she wasn't
---
Lmao like I don't care about PC culture but you literally choose to complain about like the one time where "them" actually makes sense
---
Id prefer the jockey
---
 Yeah my comment was garbage but I edited it before your response, sorry for that.
---
Meh I had the killers who would say they respect me and stuff after they tunneled me for the whole match and then facecamped, but what good do I get from their respect? 8k - 12k ok points and a lost item? I don't need any respect like that man
---
a killer being on the map is camping. get with the times man!
---
It’s called “proxy camping” 
---
You gotta do what you gotta do to eliminate people, that’s a fact.  And that’s the teammates fault for sticking around without a save and waiting too long. 
---
But in all honesty, chilling by the hook when you could be snowballing people down is ideal and proxy camping, tunneling, face camping, is considered “toxic” and denying the player a game.  
---
I would put on bbq if you don’t have it and whispers so you can keep finding people.

There's still one of those loops on haddonfield. Instead of a tree it's a bush and a trashcan. I love baiting that pallet when I play killer because it's such an easy down and a short distance to the basement.
---
Did you farm with the last guy? How'd he get so many points without teamm
---
This is true, but the devs have yet to capitalize on it as concept.
---
From Benedict Baker's journal entries this is what happens. However of they were to do it we have references to many survivors who aren't around anymore like Benedict himself, as well as the named people from the items we have like Alex and Vigo. 
---
I'd like to see them make appearances as either killers or survivors before we start trading out our current cast for killers, but would still love it nonetheless.

Thanks for the reply. I'll have to try to get BBQ when I can. And I agree, it's entirely their fault for waiting too long, especially since i was gone for quite a while
---
We all knew it was coming. Me and my friends who play seen it perks and we knew instantly people would want it nerfed.
---
Puts the nerf nurse need into perspective

Haha, sure feels like that's the case

Bruh leave Casper alone, he shy an just wants a picture to remember you by.

Had my headphones in and noticed how heavy David was breathing, it wasn’t David but the 7ft behemoth Michael Myers I literally shit my pants.
---
&gt;Well it counters spirit pretty hard
---
My counter to spirit the the fat "leave game" button, it even takes on less perk slot!
---
Maybe they are like me. I don't always play to win. I mostly play for fun. And fun for me personally are good chases with somebody amazing who get's my blood and adrenaline pumping, making me pull every card out of my sleeves in order to get them, every mind game in the book. All the different kinds of people play this game, not just those who want to do the objective and gtfo asap with maximum amount of bloodpoints. If people actually played for fun instead of winning we'd have way less toxicity in the community. But heyo, different people different tastes.
---
I didn’t complain about camping, I said it’s a bad strat if you want to win. It’s why you don’t see camping in the red ranks as  a survivor,  or at least I don’t. 
---
What I do think is stupid is people bitching about gen rushing as it’s literally the objective of the game. I do totems, pop gens and get bitched at in chat for gen rushing as if it’s my job to let the killer chase me instead.
---
Lol it's worthless. I think it should be capped at least at 60
---
Well, the thing about survivor BP gains is that they are inconsistent. Since there are 4 of them per match and the amount of work each survivor does is not equal and depends on coordination. Killer on the other hand just has to do its own thing. Although it also depends on the killer.
---
I've seen tons of amazing swf that managed to make 29k or so BP in a match, while I struggled to get to 20k as killer.
---
Maybe they could add more stuff to add to survival points, but other than that it seems fairly equal
---
I don't consider it camping, I consider it looking for more survivors. A whole section of the map shouldn't be closed off to you because you hooked someone there, and you are supposed to keep control of the map, not them.
---
You can counter the spirit? If you hear her phasing then walk away so that she can not see your scratch marks and the same goes for when you're injured, using perks like iron will/quick and quiet etc etc. If she has the good add ons then you're fucked but other than that there's plenty of ways to counter play her
---
To be fair that's very true. I'm thinking about this in more of a rank 8ish sort of viewpoint (I know I suck at the game) 
---
It's super annoying because when you give against the Spirit it's usually out of nowhere and no one is normally prepared for it.
---
wE aLrEaDy HaVe A cLoWn KiLleR
---
Yea, I let him to do all generators, stun me with pallets and more
---
Wait, is it actually impossible to blind it or are you saying that hypothetically?
---
Ohhhhh gotcha. Makes sense.
---
i think the other way around, given both have no uber addons. With spirit you cant heal, after the first hit, she continues with the undodgeable phase unless iron will. With Stridor, just hope she doesnt get a first hit on you.   
---
With nurse you can dance around albeit difficult
---
ah, fair enough. Thanks
---
If you don’t have reason to believe there are Survivors nearby after you hook someone and yet you hover nearby and don’t actively try to seek out anyone else then most consider that proxy camping.
---
Huntress
---
The only thing that really has been needed that sucks about Demogorgon are his perks: Surge and Cruel limits, the first name was better imo, have both had their ranges reduced. At least surge did, I know that for sure.
---
Havent played the ptb, but from the vids I've seen it's the distance. Like 2 or 3% shorter with add ons to make the distance greater would be great imo. Not a lot. But just a bit.
---
We all know that, im saying this NEW content is actually good for both sides

But I explicitly stated that I go pretty far from the hook while looking for survivors. I'm not really all that nearby
---
The Pig and Legion can see. Their masks still have eyeholes. As for Nurse, I have no idea how she even lives, let alone how she can see.
---
My sims after I set fire to the house with no doors.
---
The spirit is hot?
---
... stop it.
---
if only he was running the only good dwight perk youd have given him the adept too
---
Honestly. You see post like these before you even see the complaints. Jeesh people.
---
Good job!
---
Average Spirit seems fun but with absolute spirit users like Tru3, i think its a one way street. One hit and the next one is guaranteed
---
Face them at rank 1, cant tell which is worse tbh. You are going to get absolutely stomped if any of those killers appear. At least nurse needs blink mastering, which is way less of a deal than people over here make it look like, mastering blinks its the achievement of a lifetime, thats why 95% of red ranks players can do it, while only 2% can actually do well with normal killers like billy or huntress
---
All 4 of us were still alive when the exit gate opened; Meg got downed while I was opening the gate. I was about to head out because I only ever play solo and I'm never altruistic at the endgame, usually. Michael hooks Meg and, to my horror, the exit is blocked off. I never knew about survivors auras being visible while Blood Warden is active, so I sit in the gate while the other 2 survivors get downed. I feel shitty about it now but I just panicked and ran away; if it wasn't for the other 3 getting killed, I wouldn't have had the time to escape.
---
Run? You have to stay until you hit that good skill check and then run.
---
I played against someone with that name on ps4, moried them first haha
---
I would like to see a nurse skin like this
---
And then there's me, who just got head on on Jeff, only for it to yeet onto shrine
---
this perk is gonna be god tier on my blendette
---
I mean yes but no. You’re not actively seeking anyone else out because then you wouldn’t have reason to go back to the hook. You’re going away and then heading back hoping to get there in time for the unhook so you can likely down the guy who was just rescued. If you genuinely try to find someone else to chase you’d never have to head back to the hook.
---
Who is saying Spirit is better than Nurse? Nurse is better and always has been, but that is NOT the point. When Nurse holds up her hand, there's only one thing she can do, and that's blink. She has her short blink when she aims at the ground, but that's it. What happens next is down to BOTH of your skills, regardless if the Nurse comes out on top 9 times out of 10.
---
If being injured means I'm instantly dead, then I'd sure hope it would be difficult for her to get me injured, but it's not, is it? Or are you telling me, out of all the great survivors calling her bullshit, that you have unlocked the end all be all to beat Spirit. "Be unpredictable and her brain literally malfunctions."
---
I think you're entirely missing the point here. Both Nurse and Spirit have chases that make chases unwinnable. Difference being when you die to a Nurse, there's atleast a sliver of outplay potential. As a Survivor, you atleast have a small say in what happens. This is how Spirit chases go: run to pallet, she stands still, she watches to see what you're doing, she's still a statue (keep in mind at anytime she can go into her power and you will have ZERO feedback), you leave the pallet silently, she goes into phasing and chases you down. Or alteratively, you go back to her husk and SHE WASN'T EVEN PHASING TO BEGIN WITH.
---
In conclusion, Nurse is better in terms of strength, sure, but Spirit is more broken, busted, fucked, whatever you wanna call it.
---
I actually like the goblin so no comment on that
---
I absolutely despise Claudette players.
---
No you can blind, just aim at his head, you know when the blind works because the beam will tighten, it's like how with hag you have to aim slightly down, just have to learn where the "Eyes" are.
---
I read that as seve
---
I'm a survivor main and can't remember me or any of my friends ever genuinely complaining about OP Killers outside of heat of the moment frustration. Coming into this subreddit makes me feel like I'm auto hated for the vocal portion of survivor mains.
---
was playing solo survivor as Tapp. Both gates are open and three of us go to rescue a hooked guy, the rest of the squad runs to an exit gate and I get the nurse to chase me instead of the whole group as I head to the other exit gate.
---
She downs me near the exit gate and under a pallet, but I'm running tenacity and unbreakable. I'm literally holding down m1 trying to revive as fast as possible as she decides to check the exit gate for lurking survivors, she comes back and on top of me right as I get 100%, I get up and instantly pallet stun her, she blinks across, I juke it, and lithe over the pallet and straight to the exit
---
I literally screamed, unfortunately it was one of the few times I didn't have shadowplay on
---
Lmao I did search it and nothing related to bdsm murder showed up. Thanks for the insult though
---
I am though. I don't go back to the hook within a few seconds of looking around. Almost all the time, without fail, I don't even need to go back cause I found someone else who was doing gens, totems, or just walking around
---
I saw the second IT yesterday and it was better than the first one for me, cause not so many kids. But still no horror movie for me
---
2 people dead, the other guy dying on hook to face camping hag, I go around to look for hatch, I trigger her traps and get downed she hooks me and the other guy just died, I slip off the hook on 3rd try and run across the map to find the hatch.
---
Honestly the face itself isn't... Terrible, I just don't think it works for a character like Quentin. That's understandable, though!

I meant just human, all the other killers are technically humans that are just morphed or disfigured in some weird way, even the Hag, still have eyes amongst other familiar features. Unless Demigorgon is supposed to be some weird forced evolved human made by the Mind Flayer, it is the first exception.
---
DOH?
---
Shinobi lmaoooo
---
Enjoy those 10 min survivor qs
---
You would’ve revealed him anyway
---
Facebook memes
---
That’s already in the game, it’s called Object Of Obsession.
---
dead on hook
---
***S b e v e  H a i r i n g t o n***
---
There's two builds in dead by daylight there is spine chill stealthy builds and chase me builds. 
---
Fixated is going to make the stealthy builds as meta and Powerful as the chase builds, except completely non-interactive a Survivor with any fucking brainsspine and fixated without ever getting caught.
---
I wouldn’t mind Mori games if they didn’t count towards my rank when I’m playing survivor, but they do, and being someone who likes to climb ranks, mori’s suck
---
You could have atleast cropped the image so it looks like you tried, even just a little bit
---
no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
 Okay so you dont like having to use certain perks and you dont like the idea of needing a flashlight. So what do you suggest they do? Most killers have a really good set of add ons that are hard to counter, even Hag. So do you just want prayer beads gone??? I don't see the point in that tbh. Spirit's sounds are pretty easy to hear if you just listen. Prayer beads doesnt have a direct counter because you just need to adjust. Is it hard? Yeah. Ive been on the receiving end a lot. But Ive never called the add on OP or anything because ive seen plenty of survivors last a long time against it and sometimes escape. Thats my thing about playing survivor, its normally always my fault if I die unless the killer comes in with 600 ping or something.
---
Yes and no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why its recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.
---
YES
---
heres my greatest escape ever recorded https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
---
Becus they are rank 20 and wraith is so bad it's the only way they can get a Kill
---
He needs muffled bell in his base kit
---
Inb4 killers shouldn't have the strong meta counters they currently have, but of course, "a killer should only be able to kill one person in the match, and the others must escape." Everything in quotations is directly taken from the survivor's rulebook.
---
I wouldn't even care if the lunge was long, considering that as a SURVIVOR that SURVIVES from undeniable death, can run a few times around a building and play the scooby-doo scene with the killer, while a few others hold M1 without the worry of ***I M P E N D I N G  D O O M***
---
As a 50/50 survivor/killer player, I can say that while survivors are vulnerable, they can bring other forms of damage to the killer, in form of frustration.
---
***Aaand I'm ranting again.... Nevermind then***
---
honestly that kinda defeats the purpose. And I mean no offense when I say this, but it kinda just sounds like you have trouble using his abilities
---
Just get good 4Head
---
What's wrong with Prove Thyself?
---
So this is where killers start their First mori? from a doctors who has been studying Moris all his life?
---
You're not. Other people have. What goes around comes around y' know.
---
The rest isn't a problem anyway.
---
Well good thing I gave you three points, even if we considered the first two invalid (which I don't), the third still stands
---
Plague. Thats it buddy.
---
You literally said you went a kicked 1 gen then came straight back...
---
Dude, give the rest of us lowly, inexperienced survivors the key to being good at the game so we can telepathically counter everything a Spirit thinks of doing!!
---
Yeah, it's been bothering alot of fans but getting the permission to use an actors likeness is difficult and costly and you need more than just the actor saying, "yep let's do it" because they no longer represent that character. That being said, I understand why Laurie and Quentin look different so it doesn't bother me. What bothers me are the BHVR original characters like Claudette who they can fix anytime but are letting her keep that spooked fish look. I still love her though.
---
Those things are the most annoying and useless things to have in your bloodweb
---
Uh, you see what you're unfamiliar with is the anime blade wind / chi cut technique.
---
gachiHYPER
---
The bloodhunt was never official
---
The other issue I see is afk farming. Join a game and hop in a locker or corner or let the killer take you while you do something else ang get bps for your teams work.
---
Yep, I fell for it too. For shame...
---
I'm far from the best killer, combine that with perpetual red rank survivors and you can guess the result
---
Thank :3
---
I never played against either lmao
---
Do you solo queue?
---
Now this wouldn't do anything regarding the toxic people who just DC instantly maybe in the event of a hidden killer offering or the sounds of the nurse, but those people are just toxic and bans will take care of them
---
This will stop the DCs from the people who feel discouraged, unlucky, frustrated, etc
---
the lunge has a super weird hit box. it is soooo easy to miss. all you have to do is not running away in a straight line.
---
This sounds kind of cool, but it also isn’t fair if you have that one teammate who does absolutely nothing the entire game, but they still end up with a good amount of bloodpoints.
---
It’s like you duo with a friend, and both of you do most of the gens, saves, etc it’s not fair we put 90% of the effort but somebody else gets credit of a percent of our bloodpoints while Urban Evading around the map.
---
reverse steak out lol
---
But still Demogorgon is sensitive to light and heat so you should be able to stun him with flashlight from any direction. I mean it would be ofc a terrible idea to make it like that but it just shows how "hE dOnT hAvE eYeS" argument is.
---
Sorry, should've been more specfic. This was during endgame, so there wasn't much gens left in the first place. I believe only 1 needed to be completed and that was the gen that was mostly worked on. Because this was during endgame, I didn't have as much time, so I was gonna just take a quick peek at the hook while i was at it before moving onto the other gens which were in the direction of the hook
---
Thats what i meant with kinda😉
---
* First get an exhaustion perks. Dead Hard, Balanced Landing and Sprint Burst all can work, depending on personnal preferences.
---
* Decisive Strike is usually a good choice to defend against tunnelers.
---
* Borrowed time is not a bad idea to defend against campers
---
* Iron Will helps helps a lot against all Killers but especially Nurse and Spirit which are the worst Killers.
---
* Adrenaline can be a good choice especially if whole team is running it and gen rushing
---
This isn't a shitpost, it's just shit
---
"The best chapter" is really subjective and biased. I couldn't give a single fuck about Stranger Things because I don't watch it, yet I lost my shit when they announced Myers, Freddy and SAW chapters
---
He owns his likeness so that part is fairly easy and I don’t see the owners of the nightmare franchise having any reason to complain about the change. So there is a decent chance it happening.
---
It's called a Meme Karen
---
Couldnt describe It better
---
Came to write this, and for some fucking reason your post is downvoted.
---
New Survivor perks are meh at best and are way too situational to work properly.
---
Franklin's demise, Ruin (rarely but people do), alot of perks man alot
---
They call it a nerf, I call it a challenge.
---
-pig mains
---
Because "MUH STRANGER THINGS"
---
Its not Camping nor Proxy Camping, the survivor was just salty.
---
I haven't heard one complaint about the demogorgon, I have however heard all the killer mains asking for survivor nerfs already. Guess it goes both ways.
---
Best chapter? I haven't heard of a best chapter, yet.
---
Your an idiot, the reason mom got fix was because it was broken, did became a fair good perk, nobody complains about head on or self care. Your literally the problem
---
Its more of the variety of things added. A new killer, a new map, two new survivors, nine new perks, the archives in a month and a half, bloodweb changes, perk changes, and more work on dedicated servers. Not only that but this chapter is making the devs a lot of money to make more stuff for the game. It may not be people's favourite, but its huge for the game.
---
Honestly, at first I thought his lung was a little op but after a while you get used to how it works.
---
Best Chapter Yet? I don't think so. the most *hyped* chapter, sure.
---
MEG...
---
Bitch I'm a red rank killer and a spine Special Blendette. 
---
Fixated is going to make a rank 15 with spine chill as effective as a red ranked chase me expert. 
---
Low rank killers are not going to stick around for this shit have fun with 10-minute Survivor Q's bitch
---
That's a funny way to spell "a hessian sack."
---
I dunno
---
Michael needs his own tier over "yes sir"
---
it doesnt lose stacks because of the abyss isnt considered a basic attack and play with your food works with any offensive actions so you lose stacks with PWYF
---
That is hilarious that you think getting your aura revealed was enough to let you get a free hit for doing nothing besides getting hit three times. But please tell me what killer perks are unfair or op in your eyes?
---
From what I've seen having 6 portals (i think that's his base number) is plenty of portals anyways. But it would be nice to just be able to move them.
---
The pallets there seem pretty weak but dear god is the Balanced Landing strong, so many drops :0
---
Don't close the portals that are at previous gens or hooks and the killer won't have enough portals available to do this
---
Haha I can tell you're a shity Survivor main, an opp perk shouldnt be nerfed bc it ruins game?
---
Just eait, ull see. Imagine if spine chill had a range of 43.2 meters (+20%) when uninjured.  Would that be op?  Yes.  Would it be healthy for the game?  No
---
Thid is going to be as aids as if spinechill had 43.2 meter range
---
High five i do that to!
---
What is it?
---
Oh no, making stealth builds meta would be horrible kappa
---
Kate is HOT
---
You can't smurf in a game where rank literally doesn't matter. Also, if they were indeed smurfing, their rank wouldn't be red, it'd be brown, cuz that's how actual smurfing works...
---
Only thing I dislike is that his portals make him better than Mint Rag Hag when it comes to Tunnelling
---
Oh really?  And yet I'm not seeing you bitching about getting free one hit down with NOED for failing to defend gen.
---
Your hypocrisy and stupidity is astounding but I shouldn't expect much of of killers main.
---
It’s called a shitty ass meme
---
I know doesn't it suck when you're forced to use a perk otherwise you get fucking destroyed?
---
Stop complaining and deal with it. It's how the game is. We are forced to run ruin otherwise the gens get done immediately and we have hardly any time to even fucking breathe before you're out.
---
The thing is right. 
---
Im poor as fuck so these kinda help me test the waters if i can get some bucks anyhow.
---
Sounds indeed awesome!

I think Myers loses collision while stalking so you can just run right through him. It was made like that to prevent the situation you just described.
---
I was in a game where I was the only one to die... and got more BP than any other survivor. By your logic I owe them some.
---
One way to not have to keep track of hooks (if all players are present for the unhooks) is to hook whoever just did the unhook, then either all the survivors get 2 unhooks each or the greedy one dies.
---
It's like some teen mental stuff, I forget but it's like rlly bad.
---
when did i say i was complaining? i just wanted people to see the spot fucking hell man.
---
Fuck you, and that's a free downvote for denying the best chapter
---
pick survivor or killer.
---
Fungoose, a reallly experienced killer main streamer says that his pounce should have a bigger CD or a small range
---
It's scary as hell in addition to the roar from across the map and then the loud thudding footsteps
---
I'm hoping it's not going to be like the pig again
---
ive never seen it, maybe try doing the tutorial?
---
Borderline NSFW
---
Nurse's bag is made out of a material that you can easily see through, especially a flashlight light pointed at you
---
Pig's mask has entire eyes open, but her hair covers them, so she can be blinded as long as she can see light between her hair
---
No it's not bullshit. Fix your internet.
---
The fact that you use a serious disease that some people suffer from to justify your hysteria tells us more about you. 
---
You just make up shit to cover up for your inability to track, find and down survivors. Pathetic.
---
Hefty price of being revealed - this is if you are an idiot and heal to full instead of healing to 99 percent
---
But survivors dont like counterplay anyway, MoM was nerfed because it was plain broken, even the devs admitted it and made sure it is fair now
---
Want proof? It was nerfed. End of story
---
Oh god I hate that I can hear this in my head
---
Well she *is* what amounts to a rotting corpse, in one of her cosmetics her heart has literally been torn out so I doubt she needs to breathe
---
If I was a killer main why would I complain about that lol, besides I play both survivor and killer and that is why I know that more is op or unfair. It punish survivors who only do gens and don’t cleanse totems,plus noed has an actual hefty price as it takes up a perk slot, can be easily deactivated by cleansing totems, only activates at end game so its useless most of the match. Now unless you have another perk that you think is unfair or op besides noed please stop spreading your idiotic opinions about this game.
---
I’m sleep deprived but even I don’t like a melted wax figure
---
Try getting Meg's perks. They're all great. Next try Dwight or David.
---
Dwight has Bond and Prove Thyself. Bond is an amazing perk to find teammates and spend your time appropriately. That + Prove Thyself helps you do generators faster.
---
David has Dead Hard and We're Gonna Live Forever. Dead Hard is considered one of the best Exhaustion perks, and We're Gonna Live Forever, which makes it so you can get up to double bloodpoints if you unhook a lot.
---
From then on, it's up to you! Bill and Nea have great perks, and there's a lot of perks from DLC characters that are good. Feng Min, Laurie, Kate and Jane are my faves.
---
**Here are some ez builds**
---
Plunderer's Instinct, Ace in The Hole, Pharmacy + Any Exhaustion perk of your choice. It's great for looting chests and getting rare items.
---
Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet, Adrenaline. Lithe + Dance With Me is a really strong combo.
---
Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Iron Will, Calm Spirit. Very sneaky, use Claudette
---
As a Spine chill user, I laugh my ass off every time one spirit try the stand still bullshit, I just keep pointing till spine chill light off, wait a sec and fast vault
---
Then you can find them easily by following their blood trail. 
---
Yeah because you some about it like a bitch.
---
Looping the killer mindgame but you are the obsession and you know the killer has Rancor.
---
Gen done. Another. 1 gen left.
---
"I guess I'll die"
---
Ur right but just a thing on the exhaustion perk.
---
It also halts the exhaustion timer on any other exhaustion perk. Such as lithe or balanced. So if you run exhaustion perks in general (which. you probably do.) this perk is effective.
---
*Nea
---
FTFY
---
I think more BP should be given to those who are camped and tunneled.  I always find it unfair that these people are expected to hold on as long as they can but they get ridiculously miniscule BP.  If you want them to hang on and not DC, you need to give them incentives to stay around.
---
Said the guy making a qq thread
---
Nice double down
---
That's... Like.... The strategy with almost all the killer at the end. I really can't see how people can complain so much
---
Nice! Very Detailed. You've got talent!
---
Thanks brother.
---
Yeah because we totally dont have a chase meta and everybody hides trying not to be found by following a blood trail - do you think sometimes when you speak? Or just words pour out of your mouth?
---
It’s the best dlc since Myers imo but it isn’t like as crazy as people are making it out to be. I’ve been wanting a perk that allows me to see my own scratch marks for a while and im glad they’re finally doing it. Also it was comedic when the dlc was confirmed and everyone said they were “going to go easy on all the baby Steve’s” who join the game because of stranger things and we all know that’s not going to be a common theme for new players. Getting shit on three games in a row and instantly getting off the game is more like it but hey I could be wrong but I don’t see the majority of those new players sticking around because it can be an extremely unforgiving game while you are learning it and the only way they’d have a chance is going up against another new player who wants to try killer.
---
Pictures of this face rework?
---
Tutorial first
---
Damn, so close to getting your adept too!
---
It gives a signal that the totem is being worked on. If the killer keeps showing up as soon as you start working on it and he shakes his head sideways yet you keep going for it, it's more than obviously intebtional at this point.
---
The way you said - "being a survivor is toxic" almost sounded like you spoken about survivors in general.
---
Exactly me yesterday. I protected a Dwight while he was cleasing a Hex. It was Haunted Ground and Wraith proceeded to destroy our butts.
---
Claudettes are boosted
---
It's a shitpost
---
Ah ok, thanks a lot mate!
---
It's not out anywhere. On PC you can play on test build, but you'll have to buy DLC on release.
---
I'd say we're roughly 2 weeks away from release
---
no problem
---
Mate I'm a red rank Ghostface/Huntress and camping is literally the worst thing you can do, even on characters like that who are shit in a chase. Tunneling is a different story, if I'm getting pummled I'll remove one of the variables but camping is goddamn impossible to win. I get frequent 4Ks by just going for the three hook kill, but if I just hung around waiting for people to show up they'd just do all the generators and I'd only get one kill
---
Ah? There's something blocking you from going into the killer and survivor menus? Did you do both tutorials all the way to the end? If so, I'm not sure because when I first started the tutorials weren't even a thing
---
Ok, thanks, quite exited for it!
---
 Nurse takes skill. Strider Spirit with addons and “mindgames” is not skill
---
That's the issue. It takes him something like 1.5sec to travel through it with no real cool-down. I feel you accidentally suggested a good fix for this. Increase the travel time or add a longer cool-down of how often he can teleport. Cuz right now he's just all over the map
---
I’d rather go against a nurse then the spirit. Obviously you actually have a chance against spirit but I find my self having more fun against a nurse
---
Right.
---
True
---
There is a reason mom has been nerfed and noed hasn’t despite the constant bitching about both perks, one was broken and the other does more harm to killers then good. Getting your aura revealed once isn’t a good payoff to being able to take a free hit. There’s literally a perks that does that for survivors and many run it because it’s reward outweighs the risk.
---
Good morning! New characters and features are tested for a week on a PC beta before being released to everyone else. I believe the Stranger Things chapter comes out on Wednesday! Welcome to DbD!
---
As you should be, this DLC is looking really good!
---
Hmm yes I to love screenshotting something off google and putting some text on it to act like its a meme
---
Fungoose is arguably the best killer and survivor yet he thinks the Lunge needs tweaks too
---
Just because *you* need to do that to be red rank doesn’t mean the rest of us do.
---
This one is for the H8'res that keep DOWNVOTING my posts
---
What's a rage quote? I'd that where you start screaming populate phrases from important people?
---
his lunge hitbox should be tweaked
---
Do the tutorials you can't play until you finish them
---
Oh SHUT! UUUP! you don't know *anything* about power constructs &amp; misdirection that the MSM puts out! OBJectIvITy is OUT while LibCuck/RepubliTard indignation is IIIIN!
---
/s, if necessary 😐
---
same for me. I know i did them to the end because it gave me a award for doing so. Thank you for asking 😁
---
What do you think the whole point of doing these guest killers/survivors is you dingus?
---
Hag and Huntress would work together in the woods. Hag would be the mother, an old lady who can teleport around and the Huntress her scary daughter/caretaker who comes humming along as she searches. Initially the Vloggers find symbols on the ground and every time they touch one, you occasionally see the fleeting glimpse of someone in the background for only a few seconds. It's only when they damage one that the old lady starts getting more aggressive and hounding them.
---
In another situation they're scared and hiding in the dark and hear humming getting closer and further away. They're trying to hold their breath as humming and footsteps get close before finally giving up and moving away.
---
Wow! Looks great! Where did you render it?
---
Killer perks: a ranged pop and a fuck you loops, also a really powerful and easy killer that require no experience to be good at
---
Survivor: 2 heals that ignore sloppy and stuff, and one that make you walk fast, all the rest is really bad design.
---
Also a map confusing af, with bullshit windows and clusterfuck
---
At least demo mori is cool
---
Not gonna fall for that.
---
Ah nice, I guess that’s good for a smooth release. Also thanks really enjoying it at the moment, just learning more about the bloodweb, it’s been a while since a game has given me as much of a adrenaline rush as this when being chased.
---
And i enjoy people hiding for 30 minutes, lets nerf hiding then? 
---
Good killers with map pressure are great for the game, he isn't on nurse or spirit level but he is really good, and there is no reason to nerf him just because you are hiding and crying in a corner 
---
If you didnt do gens fast and he can take time to mąkę this strategy work - this just means you fucked up your gamę from the start and its your fault for loosing
---
Cant wait to see you go.
---
Also, you use 'an' if the word following starts with a vowel, otherwise it's 'a.'
---
Wow, that's quite an archetype on console. I don't really see that on PC. From comments on reddit it feels like console DBD and PC DBD are very different.
---
What
---
Personally I'd say Shattered Bloodline brought us the best killer content in a long time, with both a strong, viable killer and a lot of high value perks.
---
Curtain Call would be the single best for killer perks alone.
---
Saw, Halloween, Ash and NoES beats this for bringing cool licensed content, they're staples of horror, this is fotm to draw a more mainstream audience.
---
Even in terms of survivors, it only brings a couple of perks that are interesting and not all that good. Personally I'm going to get really fucking frustrated if I keep getting denied altruism bloodpoints because everyone has one or two passive healing perks. And outside of them, the other perks are pretty dry. Considering other survivors almost all have 1 good perk each, that's pretty par for the course except that this DLC adds 2 survivors.
---
Umm this is a pic of me and I find it very offensive that you claim it. is. you.
---
Whatever you say pal.
---
agreed. finally a non-ridiculous concept idea from a player. good job man.
---
As a Pig Main I wasn't sold on Mindbreaker until I read this comment. Could be a pretty strong addition!
---
restart the game, if it doesnt work uninstall and reinstall
---
I need to do more gen grabs as Myers - I keep hanging back and stalking due to fond memores of the DBD version of "The Hedge" playing as you got your Stalk on. Woe.
---
Low Samples on DOF.
---
As said Dlc's go into a player test build on pc for 2 weeks before coming to console, expect it 2 Tuesdays from now, so roughly a week and a half
---
I do it just in case he has noed but I also do it for bp
---
Please nerf killer because i can't do great skill checks through ruin and do shit whole match, and when the killer hooks most of us twice we just manage to have only 1 gen left 
---
But now everyone is to scawy to go do gens
---
Behaviour fix plox
---
I tried logging into my game just now, it launched no issues so I would try closing it and restarting it (seriously) and if you’re still getting that screen, try doing the tutorial again?
---
Yea, would take her any day over Billy, whom I have faced so often I actually lose all motivation to play when I see him.
---
Your posts are about as awful as your skill at the game I'm betting
---
I'd like the time it takes to close his portals to be shortened but thats it. As is if Demo gets his portals around 4-5 unfinished gens (or, God forbid, he closes the hatch with both doors trapped) then survivors are screwed except for SWFs with good comms.
---
Yeah that seems understandable. Gonna be great!
---
But closing the portals doesn't take long *at all* and if you do it while the killer is preoccupied you'll never have an issue
---
But stranger things season 3 came out is july 4th months late they can still do this
---
I disagree. I think survivors don't complain as much as they should. This now causes a big problem where they end up  DCing as they feel they are not heard by the devs.
---
I think her window vault is kinda bs too.
---
To be fair, Demo has a dope ass mori. People probably just wanna see it as often as possible.
---
Pallet loopers with decisive and insta heal
---
I can assure you this happened exclusively over purple and red ranks. If you think people can't hit greats there then I have bad news for you.
---
For Pig it depends, in mask or out?
---
BBQ was already nerfed a few months back when they made lockers block aura reading.
---
What about Feng tho
---
Piggy is cute &gt;&lt;
---
So, youve yet to face a spirit who plays around spine chill. Nothing is stopping the spirit from facing another direction while phasing, baiting you out. Though, youre probably never gonna have to worry about this possibility, because most spirit mains are simpleminded shit killers
---
Has anyone even complained about it? I’ve seen more people complaining about the new survivor perks tbh.
---
When everyone is around the hook, camping is the smartest decision you can make
---
He looks like a corpse flower
---
Your English rage quit
---
Yes, I agree that objectives are done too quickly, especially against coordinated teams. I think there needs to be something (slower repair speeds, another objective, idk). But also having to run IW just in case you play a spirit is annoying.
---
Tldr you're allowed to dislike multiple things
---
Yeah, it's just a bonus when spine chill works
---
That is not a nerf. If anything, it makes killer thinks They should camp when they can't get any reading. It should be a cool down instead.
---
The guy tweeted out go ahead and do it but I doubt that’s legally binding
---
Fuk ok wait
---
They should at least make half of my add ons useful I mean, why would I make my chainsaw quiet when they already know I’m around?
---
This is SWEET, well done OP I wish i had this kinda talent lol
---
Nerfing her ambush so her traps comparatively feel more powerful is the equivalent of you saying that your shin hurts so your friend punches you in the arm so now "you don't feel the pain in your shin anymore" but in reality now you have two places that hurt
---
I disagree. Hook everyone like that
---
I assumed people can hit greats that's the thing, i was mocking you for not playing optimally, but you are complaining about the fact games last longer because you werent fast and smart enough to not let demogorgon do his portal shaneningans - if you dont want to spend another 20 minutes in a game you know you wont win 
---
Come closer
---
Closer
---
Just lose quicker and play another one where you would complain about nurse blinks or spirit chases or sth
---
You have to be joking right? Have the post on the front page are survivors complaining about killers, the devs have listened so much to stupid survivor mains like you, multiple nerfs to killers that where fun and strong. Freddy, legion, the pig, and ghost face, all killers who were over nerfed because survivors complained. Freddy has to be reworked because of how badly people complained and now they’re complaining again.
---
Reading that gave me a headache
---
Wat
---
Personally, Rank 3 survivor right now on PC. I've been seeing so much Vommy Mommies lately, but clown I don't see at all, or atleast very rarely I see him. At most this week of 100 hours playing, I saw clown maybe 2-4 times.

Were you ever familiar with the term: oversaturated comedy?

~~Otzdarva~~ Not Otzdarva has some some videos on his channel about general stuff: like perks, survivor sounds and such. Most of the videos are about killers, but there are a few videos with information about survivors.
---
Err, Freddy is recently reworked. Pig was nerfed because of the player tendency to tunnel with the RBT. Blame yourself for using dirty tactics and getting comeuppance for it.  There's no nerf for GF. They just fixed how reveal mechanic as it frustrated both the user and the revealer due to how wonky it worked.
---
Yeah I was able to play the ptb! The new map is very confusing, moreso than lerys. Gonna take getting used to for gen, pallet and vault locations. It's a cool map though. Killer seems pretty good, his lunge is decent. Only played a handful of games and wasnt really able to use second wind, but I did use babysitter it seems cool. Also used Nancy's perk that heals after a totem break and that was sweet. All in all its fun and I am excited
---
Great perk. I was even more surprised to find you can activate it multiple times in one game.
---
He is better than Hag in every way and she is A tier.
---
Quoted is not a word, it's rage quit, it's already past tense.
---
No the lady who hates Jessica chastain as the survivor
---
I captured it by accident:

The Entity snatches the Characters out of a multiverse. In one universe, Steve and Nancy are running around like dummies. In Another, they were snatched out of their world by the Entity and now run around like Dummies in the entity's realm. How does no one get this concept.
---
This can easily be applied to every single character that is shown as a corpse/still alive in Licensed characters; Laurie grew up to be a Granmother in one universe, and the Laurie we have in DBD never got to have a life after HAlloween 1978, she was snatched away to the Ettity's realm.
---
I don’t remember that in all the lore, I remember in the entitys part of the lore that once a survivor has been hooked enough they turn into a hollow shell and get cast into the void, i do not remember seeing anything about survivors going mad being able to turn into a a killer
---
Now he's just called Ghost
---
Does it matter if it's all going to be vore?
---
Out
---
Then that would make him very add-on reliant.
---
There is a decent bit of time before you can actually travel through your portal again after using it.
---
And considering end game doesn't start until you open the exit game or the hatch is closed the main suggestion I would make is simply go to an exit gate and just wait if he travels through his portal he's going to be stuck on the other side for a while.
---
Am j the only one who wants an American horror story chapter?? Maybe like the second seasons killer
---
often male stuff gets downvoted a lot for some reason.
---
Imagine if the reverse happens and next thing you know you got Myers chillin on a gen beside you.
---
Another funny thing about what Demogorgon does that other killers do better: he needs an [ultra rare addon](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Red_Moss) to break pallets with his power and the addon also has a downside to it...
---
It takes forever for the plague power to work unless the survivor basically runs in a straight line, but at that distance, you could have just lunged. Her power doesn't seem to synergize either. When you have to wait for a survivor to cleanse (which puts them at full health) AND track down that specific fountain to upgrade your purge is taxing to say the least. As for ALWAYS knowing where you're at, that's usually in a chase. If a survivor is not near you, you can't hear them and they're likely to be cleansing.
---
Literally any killer with a removable terror radius can do that; wraith and pig just don't have the exposed effect built into the power. Hell, even hag is great for surprise downs.
---
What I'm calling a nerf, and it is a nerf, is suggesting putting the very basic, transparently readable power on a cooldown.
---
So what if you can spam it? It would mostly be used for tight spots anyway, so adding a cooldown can limit and already limited and predictable power.
---
Also, why make the hit box wide, per se? Sure, it is wonky, but I think it should stay narrow; it is a jump straight forward.
---
just restarted it. And completed the tutorials again. I went on to another game to see if it was my ps plus. But i got on to a online match no issues. So i am completely lost.
---
Fengs changed too
---
Only tweak I would make is slightly increasing  the stun time on missed lunges
---
She's not perfect but Quentin's face is exceptionally ugly
---
i just felt an emotion i’ve never experienced in my entire life
---
I want the first season just so we can get THE MURDER HOUSE!
---
tons of people are whining about the killer and inner strength
---
Better then people wanting him in MK
---
ILL GET YOU FOUR THIS SPIDERMAN
---
Ram ranch
---
Nice one, makes it look even sexier.
---
Tbh I've heard more complaints about Inner Strenght already then the Demorgorgon. That includes dbd youtubers
---
This exact thing happened to me yesterday, looped wraith for 4 gens, I end up being downed and facecamped right before the 5th gen pops. I actually managed to kobe right in front of his face and got Adrenaline, unfortunately my friend got caught in the crossfire and died to NOED. I died trying to go save him. Wraith got the 4K 😔
---
If we're talking about amount of content, it's probably a contest between Clown and this one. 
---
For me, A Lullaby for the Dark beats it. The Huntress is fantastic killer for both sides in terms of gameplay.
---
I guess the people I argued with about this are just figments of my imagination
---
actually...
---
I'm pretty sure the Entity kind of just plucked a random demogorgon up and was like yeah I'm gonna take this and go
---
The mind flayer was just like meh
---
lower ranks ruin isnt need as much red ranks ruin is more needed and even that is debatable ive seen gen rush without needing to destroy ruin
---
r/emojipolice please fucking help
---
The only issue, if any, is that it's lunge has what seems to be a very inconsistent side hit register. It lunges forward with arms pointed forward, but has an easier time hitting someone who jukes left or right rather than someone right in front of it.
---
If the lunge properly hit people in front of it and stopped randomly hitting people on the side of it, games would feel a lot better against and as it. Nothing kills the mood like landing *next* to a survivor only to have them take the damage anyway. Same for playing against it. I juke, get hit anyway, amd they do it again.
---
These shitposts are so bad they are funny I love all the people getting mad about your other posts lol
---
Why are you booing him, he's right
---
Personally would move Quentin to D and Adam to C
---
Well there is a way to escape, you die. It's annoying for the survivors, sure. If she did this for many many minutes then yes, I'd say that shouldn't be allowed but in this case... eh
---
Ohtofu said the lunge was op on the first day and needed changing. Even tho he was losing every single match.
---
Ace is too low on your list. He is used somewhat often at red ranks due to his very quiet grunts of pain.
---
Someone just downloaded their first meme creator app.
---
I never understand taunting a ‘noob’ player. If they face camped or tunnelled fair enough but if they haven’t done anything but try to play what’s the point
---
touching G spot be like
---
Nothing there looks too bad, plus this is a horror game, we can uave dark names for stuff
---
Okay I’m down for a good fight. You pick Dwight and I’ll pick the Spirit
---
Flair checks out
---
Me with my first purple flash light
---
I know how blinding works. I’ve been playing since before the Pig was added. I’m still just very confused as to *how* this is even possible.
---
F
---
For you as the killer that might be fun, but not every survivor enjoys being chased the entire match. Even if they are good at looping and extended chases.
---
if you took long enough for all of them to get there you waited to long
---
Certified cringe nae nae baby moment
---
yea really does. xD
---
If you use a very precise deciding program you can hear the demogorgan say... lag switch
---
Why are you so cool bro?
---
I ran into a hillbilly who face camped me first hook (we're all red ranks) because one of the survivors used this map as an offering and he said afterwards it was "toxic". Is this a new thing? I thought it was only Haddonfield that was considered toxic to use an offering for? All these fucking rules lol.
---
Which is good
---
It would be hard to do it on Jane thought, the hook might get stuck if u know what I mean.
---
Maybe that says something lol
---
Every time I get looped by a survivor they are usually putting objects between me and them that would block shred. It’s really mostly useful when you catch them out of place or they are trying to run from one loop to the next. Or the killer cabin if the survivor doesn’t play around it there.
---
Same. This is my type of humor🤣
---
still not as bad as literally bypassing every mechanic of the game
---
Somebody once told me a mori's gonna roll me
---
I mean I'm generally rank 3 to 1 and I'm fucking devotion 2 lv 50 or some wack shit like that. Anyhow long story sort I've found that I've never needed ruin on the characters I play.
---
I can't explain it but I've got irrational hatred for David King.
---
Never hate on a glow up
---
Will do
---
You know who you are and you are a piece of shit. So are the survivors that act like twats
---
Omg!! He did wow that's so cool xD now I will think of tesco every litle help when I get hermet shopping cart. er.
---
Do steve and nancy both have their actors voices?
---
Yeah. That's a fair point. But all you need to do to rank up as a Survivor is last at least 7 minutes. Do a generator and get an unhooked. If you don't die immediately in every case then it should be easy.
---
Definitely can be frustrating if the Killer is playing scummy though
---
I think he's only really going to be strong with the pallet-breaking ultra rare. That seems like it'll combo well with Enduring+Spirit Fury, you'll be able to get Spirit Fury charged quickly by lunging into pallets and forcing them to drop them.
---
Don't take this the wrong way but your taste in humor is shit. jk but no seriously it's horrible
---
It’s on ptb basically servers for pc players where you test new content he will be available in neck 2-3 weeks
---
Some people just don't like the truth I guess. But that's part of the fun for me, figuring out how to go against a new killer.
---
I just think we needed another perk that's rewards addative bloodpoints instead of gaining like what no one left behind already does. But I'm glad you liked it
---
notice how it's always the bad survivors who complain about new chapters?
---
demo's lunge isn't hard to avoid if you're playing tiles right considering he can't really turn/curve his lunge lol
---
Really wish they just brought in Joe Keery and Natalie Dyer for it
---
correct
---
It's generally hurting killers though... Not survivors
---
No, but 4king 9/10 games at red ranks does. Exit gates get powered against him literally less than 10 times a month, if that. His skill speaks for himself, can you make a better killer? Sure as hell not Tru3 if that’s what you’re thinking
---
If anything is OP about the demogorgon it's his stomping. lol
---
STOMP STONG STOMP STOMP *screech* STOMP STOMP *screech* STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP *screech* *screech*
---
That first game against him indoors was legit terrifying. No idea where he was just this constant STOMP STOMP STOMP *screech* until I saw the stain and he lunged at me and I had to change my shorts.
---
So simply more ways to BM and become more toxic huh!
---
Obviously this is subjective, but Clown is a really really boring killer so I wouldn't even put this close to the top DLC.
---
I think it didnt take itself seriously enough
---
Ppl flip out and call you toxic if you point you'd give them aneurysms if they could dance
---
I was watching hexy for PTB stuff and literally any time anyone ever touched a gen at any point during the game ever he would say they are gen rushing.
---
Gen rushing isn't actually a thing. The goal for survivors is to power the gens, if the killer sucks ass and has no pressure are you supposed to chase him?
---
I play mostly killer these days btw.
---
Every new killer perk is EXTREMELY situational and will have no place in any of my go-to builds.
---
Watch some of "Skemooo" youtube videos to see killers and survivors dancing
---
No u
---
This is a high quality meme
---
You just summed up the 5 perks I use. I used to not run Iron Will but I love it so much, especially considering how many spirits you face. (+ It’s good against any killer really). I’m just not always sure which perk to drop.
---
He complains about the bad designed loops, the one that you can see the killer over, which are unmindgamable and require 0 skill, since you can see the killer you just run until bloodlust and then pull the pallet down. He uses them because they are in the game(?) I mean, what is he supposed to do? Stand still and let the killer kill him? He even acknowledge when the loop he's doing is stupidly bad-designedly strong, so it's not like he is oblivious to that
---
Um actually i think you mean rank 20 and I'll have you know us rank 20s know everything there is about this game. /s
---
Insightful
---
i thought it was tunnel lube
---
“I fucked your mom”
---
There needs to be killer emotes.
---
Seeing a post like this every few months is really funny, because it’s very accurate XD
---
The sad thing is that now after the nerfs the perks feel superunderwhelming
---
Nobody is saying anything about inner strength...
---
Hag isn’t A tier😂😂 I cant even tell if this is a Kappa or serious
---
I’m sure they will be checking the subreddit right now
---
theres almost no juking it because it's so fast though, they should reduce the hitbox because demogorgon can already cancel it/fake it out for a mindgame
---
CHAOSHANDER GIANT DAD
---
BANDIT
---
SOUL LEVEL 99
---
I think they're both experiencing issues. Not sure I fully agree anyway considering that survivor gameplay is a lot more reactive than killer and not being able to react due to latency really hurts survivors in a chase.
---
I honestly expect all Freddy's to have noed I rarely run into a freddy without it
---
Have you ever been in red ranks? It's sometimes frustratingly annoying to rank up. I can do three generators solo, get two hook rescues, and still not rank up because the killer decided to ignore me all game, and I got no good points because stealth points are doodoo compared to chase points. Welp. Another great 10 minute game where I just black pip. Nice.
---
Killers can make your experience much worse than survivors. Eventually you will down a survivor, it’s how the game works. But survivors can’t make killers fuck off
---
You know the killer can turn the hitbox when lungring right? They even said something about it in the devstream
---
Thank you for the sacrifice and the sacrifices, sir.
---
Tbh I’m fine with it, since the past two killers have been “fake pallets lololol” or “4 sec stare = instadown (also no tr mind games are scary) so I’m willing to leave it be. I haven’t had dh cause I’ve been playing only Nancy and getting bad perks so once I have a decent load out, maybe also throw on iron will, then I’ll see how he is
---
I absolutely hate their voices. They sound only slightly inconvenienced with getting murdered and it leaves me feeling very unhappy playing as them.
---
What?Hag is one of the best killers you dumb or what?Are you Tyde?Hag comes after the top 3.She has immense map pressure.Can end chases very fast and most of all unlike Huntress she isnt map dependant.
---
Well, i can see that. But it would be really cool to have in the game. Lots of other multiplayer games have dances as emotes that can be bought in the game. There will always be some people who would use the dances as å way to be toxic, but most people would not do that
---
4head
---
Rank doesn't matter right now because the matchmaking is having a shitfit. But if you can honestly tell me with a straight face, that red and purple rank games are the same as yellow, then I'll smack you.
---
Majority of people here honestly
---
Not to be confused with The Spewit, the vomiting killer.
---
I was implying that dedicated servers hurt killers. But latency hurts survivors more. Sorry for beong unclear
---
Yep, a lot of people need to realize that life is happening on the other side of the screen.
---
I've dc'ed only twice; first time was my dog was having a seizure and just alt+f4'ed without thinking, and second was I was nearly late for a dentist appointment and lost track of time
---
I bet nobody complaining here runs iron will. Lol
---
Approximately two weeks.
---
I'm ok, I'd rather not get whipped and nae-naed on by an omega blink nurse thank you.
---
What’s more important is that bhvr tweeted back saying let try to make it happen
---
#No
---
Stage 2 would have been amazing, if not for the large chunk of people that already bailed and weren't looking back. Oh well. Maybe they'll do something with it in the future? We can be hopeful.
---
He is boring but he can stop loops faster kinda like demogorgon, i meant that his whole update has more contenta than this one
---
Thank youuu
---
Never heard of this killer rule lol “don’t break my totems” nice
---
I saw some dude complain about the map coverage his power has...like wtf? So I guess Billy, Nurse, Hag, Spirit and Freddy are all broken lmao
---
That's not counterplay. You can marginally increase your chances, but no matter how well you play, you're still ALWAYS at a high risk of getting hit because you brushed past some grass. No matter how well you play, you can never TRULY counter her because you are given nothing to work with. This is a PLAYER VS PLAYER game in which one player has to completely guess. I just have to believe you've lucked into finding trash spirits, because good spirits will get LoS, either due to the massive amount of open pallets or by forcing you to. I implore you to watch someone like ScottJund deal with people who try to do things you've said, because it's laughable how uncounterable she is.
---
You can add the demogorgon's jump now
---
If you ever need some help, hit me up! I teach a LOT of new players the ropes, and even run some games with them and explain what happened, what went wrong, etc. :)
---
This subreddit is abnsolute aids. It' just killer and survivor mains arguing constantly.
---
Haha majority of people  if not all teabag to be toxic, who would be judge to tell killers if your dance is toxic or not, every killer would take it as toxicity coz why would you do a dance during chase, maybr if you say you can't dance during a chase i would agree, fine add them all but if you can do it in a chase i don't care, that's toxic
---
I think I’d feel less bad about getting hooked if the killer did a little victory dance instead of just hitting me repeatedly lol. And dancing at the exit gate would seem like more of a celebration than a slight at the killer (when I was a newbie, I thought everyone squatting at the gate were dancing to celebrate surviving. Didn’t realize until much later they were t-bagging!)
---
I think a thumbs up emote would be nice, not everyone I’ve played with realizes that a quick double squat means “hi” or “thanks” and they sometimes get salty about it.
---
And that’s how a shit killer that would originally get no kills gets carried by NOED. That’s balance yeah? lol
---
But we can't base out games on brown ranks tho, where if there's a ruin, survivors won't even touch a gen, meanwhile in red ranks survivors can easily push through it. Also low rank killers are also bad, don't understand how loops work and what to do
---
all 19 of them!
---
No but the actor has shown interest about it in the past. Behavior is the ones that can actually make the changes. Having them acknowledge it show that it’s more than an impossible pipe dream.
---
Fair enough but a one time thing if all the requisites are met
---
I play on the PS4 daily and have NEVER encountered a Pig that does any of the things you are saying. Either I'm extremely lucky or your comment doesn't hold water.
---
As a surv main
---
Is demo powerful? Yes
---
But he IS balanced, pretend hes hillbilly but w/o the instadown
---
Decisive is a must but you have to know how to use it. Most killers wont pick up a recently hooked survivor because of this perk. If your ds is avtive and you think you're about to get downed you need to do something where the killer has to grab you (going into locker/working on gen.) Otherwise, you might not get to use it most matches. Most people run exhaustion perks. They're great. Dead hard and balanced are great perks to use but lithe + dance with me is an amazing combo. A lot of people run adrenaline. It's a good perk. It speeds up the game a lot. Two injured survivors with one gen left? No need to heal. Just do the gen and ez heal. I know that a lot of people like self care. Personally, I find it useless. It takes forever to heal when you could just be doing a gen or get someone else to heal you. One of my favorite perks is bond. It's greaf because you can see if other survivors are being chased and you can find other survivors who are working on gens and can heal you. Another really good perk is we'll make it. It helps so so much in terms of game progress. Also borrowed is really great. It's definitely one of the best perks to run. Sorry about the formatting I'm on mobile :/
---
They can abrley see but can technicly see

*Cries in Jeff main
---
The wouldn’t have the nerv to do this... would they?
---
This is a beautiful meme
---
Yes I think you might be overly  sensitive
---
Play Billy, run charge and cooldown addons. Ruin bbq whispers and monitor. You go fast eat ass and get BP
---
I had a killer complain about this the other day. Turned out he was struggling as Huntress on the swamp so decided with 3 gens left to camp 3 gens in close proximity to the pier. This meant me and Meg got 2 gens done across map with only the occasional Hail Mary Hatchet being thrown are way. He was then destroyed at the end so badly I let him kill me because I thought he had been memeing just throwing hatchets from the pier. He claimed he 'played dirty' by camping last 3 gens because we gen rushed and couldn't understand the gens got rinsed because he applied no map pressure.
---
I think it’s fine so long as you walk a decent distance not like two feet then come straight back

Honestly if they kobe at that point I can respect it. It's the only choice they had left and if it worked (excluding Deliverance, or honestly even with Deliverance if they based their build specifically around this situation) then good for them. I base a lot of things in my life around dice rolls; in fact most of the time I pick the Killer I'm going to play or the cosmetics I'm going to wear with a random number generator. I'd be a twat if I didn't respect RNGesus.
---
Ikr, he's one sexy beast. People (/I) dont call him Demodaddy without a reason
---
Gen Rush? No. 
---
The realization the  killer can only chase and hit and down one person at a time and if you aren’t that person you may as well spend your time doing your main objective and three people unhindered can complete a generator quickly? Indeed.
---
But still not better than daddy myers
---
It would be better if it was not every offensive action
---
Mccote did dm him, so there’s a good chance they’d be able to work something out, plus everyone wants it
---
wow, you climbed with Wraith? or your rank 1 but plays Wraith? 
---
If you climbed with purely or mostly Wraith, that gives me hope!
---
It's ok alot of people in this world get bothered by small stuff your not wierd
---
&gt; Yep, a lot of people need to realize that life is happening on the other side of the screen.
---
&gt; 
---
Which happens conveniently only when you are downed after recently tbagging a killer.
---
Swap BT with Adrenaline
---
Ty ;-;
---
Pair it with instakill perks, addons or powers and it's an above average perk. MYC and Hex: HG are the perks you need
---
"Listen here, New comers. I have been here since when the scripts were written. Don't test my patience, just play the fucking game and stop tying to be toxic when you can't even properly loop me."
---
Eyyy!! so they know you're following them and you stress them out until you herd them with other survivors? dayum thats a nice tactic havent thought of that.
---
Can confirm
---
If we're being honest, at the least the current live servers are more dedicated than back in 2017.
---
I think if you are using a med kit, Adrenaline is a good choice to drop.
---
If you are SWF, at least 2 guys in your team should have BT.
---
If you don't have a med kit and you need to use BT for your team, i'd drop DS but not be too happy about it.
---
smh these entitled survivor mains trying to survive
---
How
---
It hasn’t even been confirmed yet and you’re thinking it’s coming with the stranger things chapter?
---
If this does happen, don’t expect it till probably mid next chapter at the earliest,
---
You didn’t have feather falling
---
as killer you can't see how much the Deep Wound meter goes down, that's why it doesn't change when you hit a survivor with Deeps Wounds on them
---
also please don't use that addon, it's not even useless, it's straight up harmful to you
---
You need 4 hits i think to down survivor. Its useless and take around a minute do to xd
---
Shhh, stop telling people about this.
---
Fucking werewolf killer would be sick as hell dude, I'd buy the hell out of that.
---
I don't think there's much difference in using Survivors.
---
You guys?
---
If someone did that to me I’d assume they were running devour or something and try even more to break it
---
Cringe
---
I'd much rather they release fun off picks than Killers who in all honesty are kinda overpowered in the grand scheme of things. I think Hillbilly and Spirit are counterable (Prayer Beads withstanding) and even Nurse can be juked out if you're competent. But compared to all the other choices they're way too strong and do honestly need some nerfs.
---
Think all Killers should be at a level akin to Ghostface, Freddy, and Demogorgon. Very potent power but with direct counterplay on the Survivors' side to make every match against the Killer feel different to playing against another Killer.
---
yeah im quite familiar with bodyblocking.. racing them towards the vault or pallet. But its more of a skill than a tactic
---
Already resulted to insults, grow up seriously. Can’t you have a discussion. Can you explain to me please why hag has a very low win rate at high ranks. She’s got an amazing one at bad ranks. But that’s not saying much.
---
Steve sounds like a total puss when hooked
---
Only if it’s franklins level one tho
---
It *could* be meta but the issue is that M1 killers like the one you described are shoehorned into needing stall perks to keep the game going against coordinated survivor groups
---
It used to be the most broken add on in the game, now it's the worst after the Legion rework.
---
Jesus what rank are you playing @?

This means biw we have baby dweets AND baby steves/nancys

---
Been there, done that and I only have mild regrets :/
---
Yeah at the start of the game 1 survivor won’t finish their gen if all of them are doing single. But 3 more will. I think the issue is when swf play together. They can get through gens in minutes flat, fairly so, but the killer doesn’t stand a chance when 1 player distracts and the others all blast through gens. + in a way most killers do NEED ruin, especially higher ranks, or they’re fucked. But true not all do. And it’s a minute for 1 survivor. But when there’s more survivors it’s done extremely quickly
---
"NOED IS A PERFECTLY BALANCED PERK DRINK CLOROX THANK YOU"
---
EVERY KILLER THAT SAYS THIS SHIT NEEDS TO CATCH AIDS AFTER GETTING RAPED BY 5 BLACK MEN IN PRISON
---
He’s not a clown. He’s the whole circus.
---
Damn Twitter censors getting good. Blocked out that 250 characters of profanity about Spirit.
---
Seems about right lol
---
With about 5 miles on either side of the fence being an invisible wall. :^)
---
&gt;I literally just replied to a comment saying his power is OP like 15 seconds ago
---
That comment:
---
I've not been having any hitbox problems but I've been seeing different shit like vaulting windows and not going through, nurse blinks going fuckin sideways???
---
I climbed to red ranks with Spirit and Huntress but I played Wraith to climb from rank 3 to rank 1.
---
I've noticed this too, I could lunge and run into a survivor and he wouldn't get hit but other times (in videos mostly) I see that survivors get hit by it when they are in the close proximity (left or right to it even)
---
i think both of their voice actors dont sound like how they do in the show
---
It literally doesn't matter. Rank is merely symbolic of how much you've played in a month before it resets. A previously red ranked killer who takes a break from the game could come back as brown rank. Same goes for survivors.
---
A lot of people play don't play hag effectively. She isn't in my personal top 3 but she is A tier, if you take the time to learn trap placement and when to drop a chase.
---
Jane Romero mains when hit be like *porn noises.*
---
Whatever, I'm not arguing that, just wondering how you can unintentionally break a Hex unless it's a NOED
---
I try lol
---
When they ask why you're reposting, but never what you're reposting.
---
I once downed a survivor through a pallet, i didn't even get close enough to be stunned.
---
Hmm.. that kinda changes things but I guess rank 3 to 1 is still good
---
does fixated do anything else then show ur tracks? havent been able to get on ptb yet, so havent tested the perks
---
Act like you go away then hide behind something or in bushes. I'll wait a few extra seconds if they dont move I move on
---
they called it broken. if you call the killer's power broken with the insinuation that it's too much for survivors, then you're de facto calling them OP
---
give me a fucking break
---
It depends on a lot of things, most killers are able to work in that rank both obviously some will do better than others. So what do you typically play? You also need to be abke to mind game the survivors, if you just try to brute force your way through jungle gyms and pallets they will waste a tremendous amount of your time. You also need to understand when to cut a chase off if it's not going well for you or if they get to a really good loop, like the cow tree on coldwind farm.  I would have to see you actually play to give some actually answers but these are just some rough ideas as to how you can improve.
---
i would love it so much if he/she came to the game i think he would have a unique power like michael
---
Everyones gangster till they see this shit charging at them
---
Good for you! I would use a similar name, but my needs are specific, so I play as "Mori me, Ghost Face". I get to see this wonderful sight every 20 games or so!
---
uh oh sweetie I'm about to destroy your narrative:
---
&gt; Seriously seems pretty broken. Fuck survivors I guess
---
This is the comment. They're calling the killer's power broken because it's too much for survivors in their minds
---
sorry sweetie
---
Not really, no. They called one facet of his power broken.
---
All I can see is those dumb Forknife dances. 
---
That's a no from me chief.
---
1. Kyle's face is his, and because he played the character it shouldn't be too hard.
---
2. Sure, why not there are people who prefer it
---
3. Given how Ash, Nancy and Steve look like their respective actors, I don't really mind if they remodel the model to look like Kyle.
---
4. Given how McCote's DM'd him and Kyle's requested it, I'd imagine it'd be fairly straight forward.
---
5. Not a Quentin main so it's no real big deal to me.
---
Honestly hope they change Steve’s voice
---
Most people say he is the worst killer but a 0 terror radius killer cannot be the worst killer... there is so much potential on Wraith if people give him a chance.
---
Ahh so thats why people dc when i down them 15 seconds into a match! ;p hope your doggo was okay after though :(
---
You’re wrong
---
Actually Ash mains really aren't that toxic anymore, they seem to have really calmed down after the MoM nerf.
---
you are doing fucking back flips lmfao. One facet? Literally half of its power
---
I'm a rank 1 killer lad.
---
Are you capable or reading? That's the comment I linked and noted that ITS POSTED BY A FACT ACCOUNT
---
server DC'd on you
---
When I play survivor, this is every loop
---
When I play killer, it's nothing but jungle gyms and safe loops
---
STEVES SHITTY SCREAMS
---
thats exactly what they do
---
He scream
---
THE
---
That must have been a long meeting
---
it works at rank 1. Just because you can't do it doesn't mean others can't.
---
I think Imma about to fight you for that. En garde!
---
A lot of salt stranger things meme
---
I agree survivors are such babys. Spirit is so easy to counter. Her counter is to dc, fucking baby survivors who don t know how to counter spirit, they rly need to git gud and learn how to dc against spirit and her whole character is countered.
---
What a stupid way to overassume
---
He definitely puts other people down from time to time. No need to get all defensive because someone doesn't like your favourite streamer
---
Go back to sucking his dick now
---
I used to be a nea main now im a tapp  went from a to d :( I must be bad at this game
---
NOED means instant diarrhea
---
He can hit this but 70 demo lunge misses later... 
---
Hopefully they work on dem hitboxes
---
It makes you slightly faster too
---
Every... single... time... these ignorant threads complaining about hitboxes are actually facing a latency related issue. 
---
I feel really sorry for our devs having to put up with this wherever they go. 
---
Can't people just become educated on how ping / latency works?
---
Yes hatchet hitbox is a huge basketball and yes survivors hitbox is a cylinder (that still forgives you by not accounting your limbs as "hit zone") but when you are running in a straight line, the huntress throws a hatchet at you and you try to *juke* it like you were playing with 0ms, you will get hit. Period. 
---
This has little to do with hitboxes. Your character is always a split second (insert ms here) behind where you see on your screen.

I'm a Rank 1 Killer.I main Wraith, just because you haven't seen someone actually do it. Doesn't mean it's impossible.
---
lol you edited your comment after I read it initially and please don't lie and act like you didn't. 
---
anyway, the claim was that no one is saying it. so good job moving the goal posts. i'm sure you're very proud of yourself
---
&gt; players who just sit there and throw every safe pallet which feels really bad for the killer to play against
---
Wat? Nothing makes me more happy than people who throw down safe pallets.
---
Sorry but I have never experienced anything like this but a game like dead by daylight really needs to be played with headphones in my opinion.
---
Dude, this is some pretty good art, but you know what’s not good? Steve’s scream on the hook
---
A rank 4 queueing with 3 rank 16s isn’t smurfing to get low rank killers isn’t smurfing?
---
I’ve seen no complaints but uh I’ll note that 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Fengs are little shits who set off all of hags traps while she is carrying someone &gt;:(
---
Just because people have no idea how to play doesnt mean she isnt good.
---
WORLD
---
If you hit the big button in the middle it inverts controls
---
What about hag?
---
Isn’t that good???
---
ah ok, ive seen true use it and saying its pretty useful but it seemed like it was pretty useles to me. i guess ill have tp go test it! thanks!
---
Of course you can do it if you tunnel long enough. That’s why the game has 4 survivors, 1 man can’t do it alone. The game is tailored for the killer to catch them, eventually they run out of pallets around them and you gain bloodlust. And then I bet you proxy camp when exit gates are powered and you finally get them. Doesn’t come of as a good match, it comes off as your feelings got hurt so you tunneled all game. 
---
And no one finds being tunneled the entire game “generally” fun, the only people that do are survivors who usually play killer and tunnel
---
Lol no, he was criticising specifically the difficulty of breaking a portal.
---
I think the insane grind for perks is what will keep new players away. If they don’t do something like removing perk ranks completely then it will continue to be harder and harder for new players to join.
---
Huh. I must be pressing that on accident. Thank you. :)
---
&gt;You can dab ironically, but it's still dabbing.
---
Me with the word "yeet"
---
Everyone knows Survivor mains are the only ones who ever complain. 😂
---
There isn't. Not that we know of.
---
I get that, but also it's not the killer's responsibility to make sure survivors are having fun. I think people forget that it's supposed to be a horror game, where the killer's get to power trip over the weaker survivors. Survivors should expect to be chased.
---
Yeah because no one wants to be facecamped and tunneled...
---
There is no max level after 100 you get devotion levels and are reset to 1
---
Actually a really good concept for a survivor. I like her solo potential given how much she relies on herself during the movies. Also like the idea of a adrenaline like decisive strike. Though it would have a lot more potential if the perk activated every time a gen was completed but went into exhaustion 
---
It would be pretty cool if it could activate while hooked to give you a free unhook when the escape gates are powered
---
Plus, she's kinda floating
---
....which is part of the demo's power which they called broken
---
holy fuck i'm going to send you a gold medal for these mental gymnastics
---
I agree as much as I hope Quentin does get a face rework nothing has been confirmed that it'll actually come through and the whole licensing process will take way longer than just 2 weeks before the chapter drops.
---
Cool new mechanic then- He has echolocation and sees based on movement and breathing.
---
It makes you WALK faster, not run. It can be useful in certain situations when you’re trying to juke the killer but it’s not all that helpful. Definitely better than Urban Evasion though.
---
A killer that is only fun if you run certain perks is not a fun player to go against :)
---
IF I TURN MY CAMERA AND BODY TOWARDS GHOSTFACE AND HE STILL EXPOSES ME ONE MORE TIME. IM GONNA DECISIVELY STRIKE MYSELF IN THE GODDAMN BRAIN
---
I always run iron will personally, adrenaline requires you to get to endgame iron will helps you get to endgame is how i look at it
---
Okay so we agree that he wasn't calling the killer OP but rather one part of his power OP.
---
How does he put other people down? I’ve never heard him do it. If you say something stupid, he looks around awkwardly then says ok. The worst thing he’s said is “if you don’t like the stream, you’re free to go.” If you’re that much of a fragile bitch then I don’t know what to tell you buddy. But I’m very curious on what he said to you that seemed so toxic
---
Yea a good killer should know when to abandon chases like ironworks, asyLUL, broken shack or jungle gym set ups. or just dc on The Game or Haddonfield. 
---
However it gets really obnoxious if you're up against seperated team that all run into the strongest structure as soon as they hear the HB.
---
Considering how uncommon SWF squads are, it's just not possible for it to be every game
---
also almost of none of what you listed it toxic
---
Well you're not supposed to win every match or rank up every match. Sometimes it's annoying when a team drags you down or the killer ignores you but it's part of the game.
---
And yes. I've been to the red ranks. Tons of times but you win some you lose some. A bad match can be extremely frustrated after several losses or bad matches in a row. Especially when you're watching rank progress go down the drain or stagnate.
---
But it's all part of the game. In my opinion survivors should be reworked. Escape tiers that signal your rank. So that way people stop thinking escaping is everything and actually help the team. For example. Merciless sacrifice. Hopeless sacrifice. Regular sacrifice. Barely escaped. Great Escape. Just an idea I've seen bounce around in the community.
---
Who’s Claudette? Never seen her before. All I see are talking bushes.
---
Oh, I didnt know this thread was yours. Wasted my time. Darn.
---
Hey there,
---
I've calculated this myself, and here's what I came up with:
---
Number of total perks you need to obtain can be represented by
---
(P*3)-3
---
Which is 
---
(71*3)-3
---
Subtract the levels where you get individual perks
---
210 - 39
---
Then, divide the rest of them by 2, as you'll be getting 2 perks per web
---
171 / 2
---
That leaves
---
85.5
---
Which is rounded up to 86. Add the 39 bloodwebs back in, and you get a total of 125 for survivor.
---
Trappers are usually pretty friendly, demolish me most of the time though
---
Calling something broken and/or OP is a form of criticism.
---
&gt;Toxic
---
What? You're upset because they outplayed you? The post-game messages, I understand how those can be considered toxic, but not the rest.
---
Poor Jeff
---
you're about to get a handful of people saying "no one actually is asking for nerfs!" even though people are, and this handful of people are all over the place saying it
---
I hope there is no nerf yet. It's too soon. I think he is fine right now and people are just learning how to play him and use his power.
---
FUCK YOU LOCKER SHITS, HIDE AND DO OTHER SHIT, LOCKERS WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE GETTING OUT AND SCREW THE TEAM.
---
Legion should have been in the trash can. Miss Piggy is too good for that
---
Legion and Leatherface are worse than Wraith imo

I think his pounce needs some slight adjustments but other than that he’s pretty solid.
---
yeah no shit, but you were downplaying what they meant because your trying to force a narrative that they didn't actually say what they said
---
thank you for admitting you were wrong
---
I use it sometimes to juke survivors
---
*Coldwind Farm intensifies*
---
Lmao!
---
Exactly like this.
---
I've been there too but like my first games
---
Yeah you think youre doing good gen time and then he finally appears and every vault is trapped
---
i've never noticed any killer being any friendlier than any other. same goes for survivors. vast majority of people just play the game
---
Just in case :)
---
Lol this is wholesome.
---
The pig and legion have eye holes in their masks, And the nurse’s mask is thin enough for her to see through.
---
But I do agree with you on your point simply because: IT’S A F*CKING VIDEO GAME!!!!
---
No
---
Nope, but lower ranks has a higher variety in killers, which makes the game enjoyable rather than just two killers every match
---
Lol right? Trying to figure out how it could work with interior maps too.
---
Didn't teabag, wasn't the survivor. It was at the very beginning of the match and I only saw one Dwight.
---
I'd love a wraith movie, but to be fair I'm biased
---
I don’t know. I’m asking you what’s the McKay toxic thing he’s said and you’re just saying I’m dickriding and that he has, but provide no evidence lol. 
---
So I’ll ask again, with a line break since you can barely read, what specific thing did he say to put someone else down?
---
Bruh, all I'm saying is that he isn't calling the killer OP but saying that it's broken how hard it is to destroy his teleporters.
---
So pissed The Joker Is wasting a character in mk11. We haven't had Smoke, Rain or Stryker be playable since 2011 but the Joker has been in 4 netherrealm games in 10 years.
---
At least their attempting to help the team based on an in game tip
---
Mood
---
I would say LITHE from feng min is a really good perk, I prefer using that over speed burst
---
Playing to win in a SWF is not toxic. If something exists you are allowed to use it in any way you want it unless it's a bug.
---
I don't see why you wouldn't be able to get a perk every level, as long as you go for it before any add ons or offerings. I figure # of bloodwebs is equal to number of perks *3 for the 3 tiers and not including the 2 teachable you may need to get out of the way so other perks will spawn, and assuming you have unlocked all other teachables.
---
and as I said over and over, that is de facto calling the killer OP
---
you have not proven otherwise at all
---
His stalk takes 2.5 seconds, if survivors are pre stalked it is impossible to break his stealth before he exposes you. Not to mention it never goes away until he hits you or activates it. It is not the same concept or effectiveness as wraith or pig.
---
I'd probably recommend Bill (Borrowed Time) or David (Dead Hard)
---
A certain lawyer from Hell's Kitchen would like to have a word with you.
---
Leatherface, so bad I didnt even remember him.
---
But Legion i think is pretty neat he is up next in my list after Plague. 
---
seeing him hack 4 survivors at a time seems pretty dope
---
My list Wraith &gt; Plague &gt; Legion
---
I wish you would've started with David, We're Going to Live Forever is a must have for early game unlocking. After that, Bill or Dwight have easy to use meta perks to unlock for the base game.
---
He definitely needs something done so he can be viable consistently in the higher ranks. I can see new players saying that though. I was there once too
---
Balanced Landing from Nea is good.
---
Bill's perks are good too.
---
If you plan on grinding for more perks get David Kings perks. His perk gives you 100% extra bloodpoints
---
Couldn't let a shitty killer get 1k, right? Better give him 4.
---
yep i've had it on her for a long time now
---
Just for clarification. It was at the beginning of the match, was in a chase with someone and was actually having fun and I heard a person in my house collapse. I don't want to give anymore personal information than that.
---
There IS a face tho
---
Is there any point in upgrading characters?
---
Legion. Don't quedtion IT i Just enjoy
---
I honestly think bill for borrowed, or kate for dance with me. I love those 2 perks and think they are very solid. Especially a quick and quiet/dance with me build.
---
Dryer? I barely know her!
---
*ba dum tiss*
---
I honestly only run noed if I don't have ruin. I run noed on wraith and on Michael which pairs good without pwyf if I do say so myself.
---
I used to think noed was unfair but I gradually learned that it wasn't that a bad of a perk.
---
Also when I play survivor if they don't have ruin I assume they have noed
---
Not for Lisa. :'(
---
You tried, but please learn how to type. But you tried.
---
He doesn't afraid of anything!
---
Me when I get 4 downvotes and am now at -2 karma: Holy *bleep* look at all this damage
---
Like just tap it twice to double back quickly? That's pretty cool
---
r/youngpeoplereddit
---
That last perk idea isnt half bad, just needs a cooldown though
---
Yeah she’s one of my fav to go against, looping M1 killers isn’t as satisfying as juking a spirit.
---
whattt hes the coolest looking dude in the mix
---
I see what you´re saying with more bloodpoints, kinda hard dealing with no self care early on though
---
IF THE GAME DOESN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE PRESSED 'E' ONE MORE GODDAMN TIME! WE'RE EVEN SPAZZING OUT ON THE GROUND AND SHIT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! THEN PEOPLE ARE LIKE: "TIM TIME COULD BE BETTER HUR HUR HUR!" NO, NO IT CAN'T, TRY IT YOURSELF AGAINST NON-POTATO-RANK KILLERS!
---
You are.
---
Shouldn't really matter there anyway.
---
I mean, cant really tell from the picture
---
&gt; a well-known survivor
---
Not really and as a massive horror fan I'm more than okay with that. Detective Tapp is far from a name the average horror goer is going to remember off the top of their heads. The same with Quentin Smith. I like it though, because it leaves room, or at least once left room, for characters actual horror fans would be familiar with. I'm not so sure about that anymore though, I think they'll just go for hyper popular household names if they can so R.I.P any Clive Barker stuff I guess.
---
I love this.
---
He sounds like when Mario gets sucked into a black hole in Super Mario Galaxy
---
My issue with mind breaker is that it only functions when survivors are repairing a generator not yet repaired to  50%. The survivor with exhaustion has a simple counter to mind breaker : repair the generator to 50% then pause for  three seconds then carry on their business to repair the generator and recover exhaustion and the negate the killer perk
---
I've seen dozens of posts complaining about survivors complaining but seen 0 of them complaining
---
The beta is not out in the U.S. ,you can still get it by changing your region.
---
I run ruin, TOH and haunted grounds on spirit and I had two people body blocking for their buddy. All three went down in the basement when they popped the wrong totem.
---
In Patch 3.3.0:  
---
*  Hooks have been removed, as have the Cypress Mori, Ivory Mori, and Ebony Mori.  Killers may now kill a player in the dying state.  
---
*  Pallets have been removed.  Survivors now split 20 firecrackers between themselves at the start of the game.  Firecrackers activate immediately, without warning.
---
Speed limiter addon
---
I mean the list I want to play  
---
Wraith first, when I feel like ive done a huge deal with Wraith im gonna try Plague and then Legion
---
Omg I feel so dumb... I usually just throw on random add ons when I play killer. Thanks!
---
I'd like to see some Myers cosmetics, like maybe the different outfits from the many sequels and reboots
---
honestly it totally depends on how many people are using it.It's possible that majority might use it on higher ranks and get usage out of it like once or twice at most.
---
imagine complaining, he is not even close to being OP. I would say he probably needs a buff to be descent in higher ranks :P
---
I've seen that happen on some youtubers. It was in EPIC FUNNY DBD MOMENTS MONTAGES so Idk.
---
Cool
---
Is it right at the edge of the skill check where it looks like it hit but it doesn't? If yes,  it doesn't go off at those 2 places. If no, then it's probably a bug
---
ye that Tip is really dumb
---
Wait what’s the killer?
---
And he took Ash’s spot in KP 1. When I saw that goofy fucking render of some Joker imposter and no Ash, THATS when I said “alright I’m fuckin done with this game”
---
For Pig? I don't think PWYF is good on her at all, even tho it helps her crouching speed. She's not the type of killer where abandoning a chase is a good idea just for the speed boost, and STBFL is much better for ending chases
---
*boss comes and closes hatch*
---
How long is the PTB active for
---
No its on ptb
---
I like the idea of closing the entire game, someone, I can't remember who or where suggested that people who dc, leave ”husks” in which the killer can still interact with, ensuring the extra blood points.
---
That's a good idea, imo a penalty to dc-ing would be better, but it might hit people who just lost connection, so your idea is probably better tbh
---
THIS ISNT A RANT BUT I HAVE TO THANK YOU ALL BECAUSE IM LEARNING SO MUCH FROM READING YOUR THREADS.
---
Which region?
---
Can confirm this is how it feels
---
The only times I've hit with it are when I coulda just used M1 or when it didn't look like it shoulda hit them
---
Anytime I think it SHOULD have hit, it was a huge miss that makes it look like I'm hugging them or scratching their toes
---
Then you probably deserve to die, plus if the hatch is closed then a door can be open.
---
Just because *you* don't like the show doesn't mean you should bully people who came in because they want to play with characters from the show. Besides, this DLC is the best thing that has happened to DbD in a *long* time, and that's just if you take into account the amount of people this thing is bringing in. Last time something like this happened was way back when *Michael* was announced. So let people just enjoy the game and don't be a prick
---
It's been fine
---
Don't say it, 
---
Don't think it

The Bye Bye Man

thats hot

Gotcha. When is it’s official release date? I know it’s in September
---
Why are you booing? He's right
---
I bet you’re a pretty positive person. That’s super awesome. Have an upvote

ye the pounce is pretty busted. it has the range of like 2 lunge attacks and has no cooldown if it hits or misses but besides that he cool
---
Nor Instagram...
---
But good for Feng ;)
---
I got a 3k as a level 1 trapper and people called me a bot and that I was hacking, I really don’t know what goes on in these peoples heads they just can’t imagine someone outplaying them in a game
---
I think an idea like this even if nothing else but to make more interesting palette replacements would make the game feel more authentic and interesting, palates are fine but kinda boring so make pallets skinned to look more contextual would be great
---
I encountered 2 friendly wraiths who basically led us to the generators. Maybe they were the same guy.
---
Brutal doesn’t have to mean gory
---
Propably Rin as her backstory has such insane depth and is beautifully written... Okay just kidding.
---
For a movie I think maybe Legion, huntress or Nurse. They all have pretty good backstory to be expanded and explored 
---
But Billy's story would make for a bad-ass base to a metal song. Sadly i have bo skills in creating music because that I do want
---
Yes, I know, and that's what I was talking about. Opening a door as the last survivor almost never works.
---
How so
---
Just dead hard it or bait it out.
---
If you want to add the teachables in, then add 1 bloodweb to my total.
---
The official notes state that there will be 3 perks per web on 40 - 49. From what I've watched from PTB streamers, the bloodwebs haven't changed their behaviour otherwise, so in almost all instances you should be able to grab two perks if you plan your approach right. The only exception to this is if you grab a perk and the entity grabs a perk which terminates on your path in less than 3 moves. The entity would then have to take the last remaining perk on the next move. So it's possible to lose the third perk as well, but the chance is low.
---
I will always find it amusing to see how upset people get with pipping in this game :D    TY
---
It's mostly rank 20s who don't understand that running in  a straight line is gonna get you killed. These are the same people who bitch about every killer.
---
And the gen? IT'S NEXT TO SOME TREES. And the trees? NEXT TO OTHER TREES
---
I mean, the last update might have broken a bunch of stuff, but in all fairness there's no point in fixing it if you're about to roll out Dedicated Servers and will have to fix everything anyway.
---
This map is widely considered the second worst map for killers. I propably still wouldn't facecamp because of it but i would definitely be salty
---
Hillbillies for most part.
---
Ace kinda has a built in iron will. Not as quiet as a real Iron Will but he is much harder to hear.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d0iznq/the_clown_and_myers_have_some_explaining_to_do/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Clown 
---
He's a strong
---
I think there's enough cooridors to get some hilariously long shots out.
---
Are you doing it in KYF or a regular game?
---
The only real danger you would be in is if they try and body block. You know right away when you're chasing the obsession and can just not attack them. Also, her ambush attack does not count as a regular attack, so you can use it to attack the obsession and not lose stacks. And you can also try and force another survivor to use DS and cause the obsession to switch so you can attack the former obsession
---
I know! It should be in the Options, not bound.
---
Spirit is one of the best killers in the game. Clown is the weakest of the 3
---
Spirit is the strongest of them. Plague is fun i guess.
---
Agreed. They could do a lot with his insanity, we could also follow his descent into madness, which is kinda seen if you read his notes. Some of them have normal quotes, others have quotes that are him but less of Carter and more of "the doctor" (it's never stated it's the doctor in some of the quotes, but it's kinda obvious). Also, it's clear the place he worked in abused their patients, we could see that portrayed as well.
---
It happens on ps4 too
---
Still, some variation would be nice. And those are not pallets — they have very different uses.
---
Goddamn get off the dude's dick o-o
---
At that point you give up and go to the rnext game
---
STBFL is good on any M1 killer tbh
---
I usually run it on freddy,wraith and clown
---
New map is fine, lrn 2 navigates
---
Wait you mean there is something wrong with having 10 conjoined junglegyms, rockloops and a shack  and a ridiculous middlestructure that can be accessed anywhere in the map? I'd say this map is worse than haddonfield if there are no balanced landings
---
It takes the fun out of the game for both the survivor doing it and the killer. It doesn't help the survivor get away at all. It has no purpose at all beyond annoying the killer, which is poor sportsmanship/griefing.
---
No one cares though
---
Same would be good for the lockers. Some lockers make more iron-ish. Or make some pallets appear as some objects (thrown to the side tables for the School, etc.)
---
I am 100% for something like this
---
Is this a PC joke that I have too low frames on ps4 to understand
---
Spirit is so annoying to play against to be honest. It's probably the strongest of the bunch too.
---
Plague is fun to play but not as rewarding
---
Clown is really boring and easy to play against
---
&gt; Also, Who said anything about tunneling
---
there are people who define tunneling as "chasing me for too long boo hoo"
---
Yeah that would make the game feel way more interesting and less repetitive
---
Change survivor mains to anyone who runs in a straight line. Zig-zag or bust, bois.
---
Yeah, I forgot this sub is survivor/killer cyrcle jerk, my bad
---
Thoughtful Myers.
---
How is Spirit not bad for the game? Her "mindgames" consist of the survivors having no tell as to what she's doing, while she holds literally all the power. An example of a Killer that IS good for the game is Huntress, legitimate counterplay and a power that isn't a push-over. I don't even think Spirit is overpowered, but her power is just unfair.
---
Pwyf and discordance on wraith is godlike. Otzdarva has made a few videos with that build and his chases are so easy because he can get 3 stacks in 15 seconds so easily
---
Then what should the survivor do if not loop? Just run in a straight line?
---
Yeah. That it it’s only real downside. However, this limitation is necessary — or else this perk would negate a lot of meta perks, and Idk if it would be for the better or not....
---
As far as we know, no. I can't even imagine why his power isn't all that hype. At max the holes, when being closed, shouldn't be able to be teleported too but I think that is about all they could do. Maybe slight changes to lunge hitbox as that thing is weirdly messed currently and it just needs to be telegraphed better.
---
It's not about enjoying the show. It's about the reason for getting the game. Not once did I say that I don't enjoy it. Doesn't mean that I'm going to buy an entirely new game just because they added characters from the show. That's what most of these people did. They bought it, not because they liked the game or anything, but because they just saw some characters that they liked from a show. If they were playing the game because they liked it and not because of some characters then things would be different.
---
DOES ANYONE KNOW ANY GOOD YOUTUBERS THAT PLAY THE GAME? 
---
SO FAR I’VE COME ACROSS OBNOXIOUS OR ANNOYING PEOPLE THAT SCREAM INTO THE MIC OR HAVE EXAGERATED REACTIONS.
---
I'm on PS4, but appreciate the offer. That's a lot of pallets, so I could see the time wasting potential.
---
How is ghostface now?
---
Mario kart?
---
Boodoobadoop thats huntress!
---
I love Goose but I strongly disagreed with his assessment. He was playing KYF with his viewers and they legitimately were running in straight lines. He should have tried playing real games. While every killer is powerful in his hands, his assessment of the lunge was based off of terrible data.
---
To be fair that Freddy one is just how he do
---
It's not the actors from the show, just random people from BHVR half-assing it
---
One time I was just sitting on a gen thinking who the fuck is the killer next thing I now Micheal is just staring at me like ten feet away. Man's a ninja
---
so, do you think its right they let the game uplayable until they roll out dedicated servers?
---
Spirit is a guessing game. There’s no grand Joseph Joestar outsmarting their outsmarting. You are given a set of options, and you have a guess which one is right. There’s almost always no way to tell. For example, you throw a pallet in front of a spirit, and she stops. Is she phasing or trying to fake you out? Who knows? Running away if she’s phasing could result in her quickly catching up, hitting or downing you. Running away if she’s not phasing can cause her to just move again and chase you or start phasing to you. If you stay and she’s phasing, you get hit. If you stay and she’s not phasing, she can start phasing. Vault the pallet and she’s not phasing, get grabbed. Vault it and she is phasing, maybe you get away. There’s no way to predict what she’s doing other than dumb luck, and even if you do, she can easily get you anyways. And don’t say to run iron will, because I don’t find it worth it against other killers and I’m not counterpicking perks.
---
This was a great show. Bring back brown hair link
---
I’ll be honest there’s nothing sweeter than absolutely fooling someone with fake pallets on freddo. I get such a dopamine rush because it shows I have such a superior intellectual to the person I’m chasing that their puny minds can’t even comprehend my insane sick plays.
---
this is a bizarre comment
---
That's a thing for all killers though. Demo has a large horizontal swing and the handful of things I've seen don't make it clear that it is as wide of a swing as it is.
---
Wish mind flayed Billy was the killer.
---
Which chapter was better in your opinion?
---
Thrill only helps you reach the 8000 cap. you don't get bonus BP
---
It’s main purpose is to waste the killers time. Other survivors can be doing safely do gens or something whilst you loop
---
Found the killer main 
---
Bonus if they argue tunneling isn’t toxic
---
"They" can always make sense, no matter the gender or the amount of people you're discussing.
---
Wot?
---
Thanks it's nice to watch new content creators with different views I enjoyed the video looks like a bunch of friends enjoying the game look forward to seen more.
---
Even though I’m a Freddy main, have been since release and I miss my wall hacks btw, I still think Myers was one of the best dlc even without the movie aspect. We got decisive and object of obsession. Two pretty fun perks even with decisive nerfed it’s still good to use and then Myers tier 1 terror radius spiced the game up quite a bit especially when everyone was used to the 32 meter radius I know I got pulled off a gen a time or two and it legit made me scream and this was well after the scare factor of the game was gone for me. And I love the map. Yes I know it can be an abusive bitch trying to catch survivors looping those houses but I’ve had plenty of good killers mind game me in those situations and manage to get the hit on me pretty easily because they understand the map. Like the map is so fresh to this day that it creates its own mind games. I fucking love that. I get pretty disappointed when we get a new map and it’s nearly a copy and pasted version of another map and the only thing changed is like the center of the map.
---
I still think gen progress should be tied to killer and Ruin should be completely changed so that way you don't need to run Ruin on anyone but Nurse and Billy to get multiple kills.
---
Chelsea survivor when
---
If I'm playing killer and stumble across the unhooked survivor with no one else around, I'll usually just slug them- which also avoids DS, that and it also puts pressure on the team to come back and heal them.
---
Why does everyone say that? Running straight isn't the only other option. Run away. Use the environment to hide or throw the killer off your track. A tiny bit of logical thought and you can fairly easily get away from the killer.
---
Yeah I know, he’s one of the survivors I use the most. I should main him but I can’t ditch my Nea like that
---
That happened to me
---
hmm, patch notes say, "increased the amount of perks available in the players Bloodweb, starting at level 40." im not sure where i heard that you arent garanteed to buy 2 perks till 50 but my formula accounts for that if you multiply the 40\*2 (100%) instead of  40\*1.5 (50%). 
---
when i put in 100% to my formula i get the same numbers you are showing now. with the +1 which accounts for the teachables.
---
thanks a lot, this was a fun math check. cheers
---
Quinton used more than jeff? I think youre lying to me
---
Yea it's more of a problem if just having too many pallets that can't be mindgamed. Now if the survivors are not doing gens all the time, and they (somehow) run out of pallets, the map has only 4 vaults, 2 of which, are useless without balanced landing. So if the survivors aren't optimal the map becomes a deathtrap in a second, I still hate how boring it is to kick 20 pallets without counterplay
---
"Guys the hatch is next to the thing! The uh... The tree!"
---
Maybe not, but we also definitely need a "The Ogre" killer with a stunning roar ability
---
It's a defense mechanism. If you whine before it happens you won't be disappointed when it does happen. 
---
Is it stupid?  Yes. Is it because of prior events?  Also yes.
---
Its regular, I know about the KYF thing
---
So far, from what I've seen he ranks just below huntress viability wise, he's almost like a jack of all trades, he's got a bit of map presence, he's got a bit of stealth, a really good lethality option, he seems kinda well suited to lots of situations
---
Looping is not poor sportsmanship.
---
Looping is being smart.
---
if you find it unplayable then it's probably a bunch of you issues
---
How does that prove anything? It didn't get banned in the first place.
---
Pounce is his only saving grace. Jfc this is what I’m talking about. It’s so easy to counterplay and dodge!
---
Back in my day, Killers made fun of Survivors for wanting to play against AI Killers. Now, in 2019, we have Spirit, a single player experience, practically facing AI Survivors game after game. But there's counterplay, just walk 4Head
---
Yeah adjustments in the fact that it misses when it shouldn’t
---
It's probably because shirtless Davids are very annoying to go against and unfortunately quite common
---
Ship?
---
&gt;Just hide LOL.
---
You will have fun when you run into a competent killer
---
Billy and Nurse are as borderline as you can get with certain items and builds but ain't nobody bitching about anyone but those two who understands basics.
---
&gt;Run away. Use the environment to hide or throw the killer off your track.
---
Where? Run where? 
---
There are scratch marks that lead any killer right to the survivor. If it was so easy to lose the killer in a chase then people would do it. This stuff only works in brown ranks.
---
I'm absolutely loving his rework and same I love the plays I can pull off with him
---
Agreed, mostly to his portals, his shred is in a fantastic spot right now. I say for the shred he definitely needs fixes to the hit box to make it more consistent, and he needs to be able to turn after connecting a hit or missing (even if it’s a slow turn because right now he’s basically frozen when he hits a shred)
---
I suppose that's fair, in general though when taking in dbd community content it seems to be more saturated with killers complaining about survivors than vice versa. But I also don't look around here a lot, just my experience.
---
Spirit has so much mindgame potential
---
Like I’m running to a super obvious window and I’m thinking “am I about to be pounced” and I get jumped like there is a lot of mindgame potential. I’d only call for nerfs if the jump didn’t have a CD but if he crashes into a wall, he CD is longggg
---
I can relate, not the best with her on console haha
---
Then nerfed right after release with a hot fix, not a huge nerf albeit, but made him way easier to spot now
---
QUENTIN FACE REWORK N O W
---
This bug has been around for so long. [Here’s a video of it not working from 8 months ago.](https://youtu.be/IHwSbOl3I0E) Mind you this was pre decisive rework as well.
---
Yeeeaag bb
---
lmao leather face should get a pink add on that extends his range \*tremendously\* increases his range also visually
---
When I say 'run away' I just mean get away. Dont literally run the entire time
---
Dbd really needs to be played with headphones. There are a lot of subtle sound queues that can help you a lot. Especially directional sound.
---
Trapper could have a cool My Bloody Valentine type movie with the mines and shit. 
---
Honestly though I think a Clown movie would be great, set in a circus or some shit. I'd piss myself if a 900lbs clown with severe tuberculosis and rapist hair came running at me in an abandoned circus tent
---
I’m gonna still call it what it should be called
---
It's almost like Killer is supposed to be the power role.
---
Spirit does have tells. You hear a wooshing noise. She's standing still (in a non-loop setting). You play stealthy so you don't get hit and become easier to find. 
---
It baffles me how most people can't seem to pick up on the fact that everything that people scream is OP or "Not Fun" are the things (No One Escapes Death, Nurse, Spirit) who punish you for just running around because you gotta do it fast. Nurse and Spirit are the best Killers in high ranks because they completely counter that, not because they're over powered.
---
How was it not a nerf? It reduced the information given by the perk, which weakened its effect, which is by definition a nerf. Whether it caused more killers to camp or not is sort of beside the point.
---
It punishes people who run in straight lines or who run predictable loops. I've played and seen experienced survivors play against the Demo and the lunge is not that difficult to avoid if you pay attention.
---
I NEED A FLASHLIGHT AND I NEED IT NOW
---
I play on PS4 and I asked him to throw his Xbox into the garbage because that's where that unworthy creation belongs
---
I mean sometimes, you just wanna get that one kill after a tough game, the exit gates are powered, survivors ready to teabag, you just wanna pitch a tent and chat with the hooked survivor. It was a strategy I utilised a lot when matchmaking was fucked and all I got were survivors way above my skill level, where you essentially don't stand a chance. Even when I played a lot of survivor I understood when a lower skill player camped/tunnelled me
---
Get away how? Killers are faster than survivors.
---
How did you possibly reach the conclusion that delaying yourself dying has literally no purpose, in a game where literally the main team objective for your team requires safe time to work on? Did you comment in the wrong subreddit and forget literally the entire main game mechanic?
---
Maybe not friendly but I personally haven't seen a lot of toxic doctors (but also maybe I'm biased)
---
It's not toxic theOtakuX, it's just a game flaw that 70% of killers have no real way of dealing with outside of running it in a way that ends it asap, which can often times be more than enough for survivor to work on generators without any worry.
---
Except you didn't mention the fact that it's a SWF 4 man and everybody already knows who the killer is.
---
Stealth 100
---
Key: Exists
---
Killer mains: It'S bRoKeN aNd UnFaIr
---
Not really, I mostly saw talk about inner strength.
---
Wow, two whole people complaining. That definitely warrants a PSA to everyone else on this subreddit.
---
A) JoJo's bizarre adventure is an overrated piece of trash.
---
B) Don't get found in the first place? Stealth is an option in this game, even if most of you "high rank" survivors never want to use it.
---
The new players are the outhouse, shrek is the mori killers
---
That’s not camping.
---
CALM THE HELL DOWN.  SOMETIMES THE KILLER IS COMING AND THE LOCKER IS LITERALLY THE BEST PLACE TO HIDE.
---
ARE YOU SAYING THEN, THAT IT'S BETTER TO EXPOSE THE PERSON IN THE LOCKER SO THE KILLER NOW HAS A CHANCE TO DOWN TWO PEOPLE INSTEAD OF ONE?  IF SO, YOU'RE JUST AN ASSHOLE AND *EVEN MORE OF A DETRIMENT TO THE TEAM.*
---
ALSO, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET OVER IT, BECAUSE IN THE NEW META BEING IN A LOCKER CAN POTENTIALLY HEAL YOU FASTER THAN ANY OTHER WAY.
---
Congratulations!!
---
No, it's not "right".
---
But it's most certainly the lesser of two evils since there's no point in wasting time and manpower in fixing something that is going to be irrelevant soon enough anyway.
---
Placing the two in a relationship together
---
STOP BREAKING HOOKS RIGHT NEXT TO THE GEN IM WORKING ON! HE NEVER KNEW WHERE WE WERE AT UNTIL NOW!
---
People flipped their lids over it, claiming it was "old ds" level broken and "Killers didn't see the hypocrisy in saying it wasn't broken."
---
“The killer went, uh... away from the hook. Towards some rocks!”
---
it means when someone likes and supports them as a couple
---
Have you played dead by daylight before? The killer is faster than the survivors. If they're any good you won't be able to get away with just the environment.
---
THANK YOU
---
NOED oP pLz nErF
---
Trip them up. It isn't hard if you just use your fucking brain
---
Thanks!
---
Ok, I have many negative opinions about whatever stealth bullshit you just told me but I can set that aside, leave jojo out of this. Have you ever even watched it?
---
Theyre really nice if youre low rank and dont have those killers. Once you buy the killerd or you get to green ranks, theyre worthless
---
No one: 
---
Dbd subreddit: OMG LOOK AT THESE BAD PLAYERS COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS ARENT WE SUPERIOR NOW LAUGH MONKEY LAUGH GIB KARMA NOW
---
Hes going to be Freddy tier i think. As in, High mid tier easily.
---
Yeah it's literally the stupidest thing ever like why the fuck would you need a button to quickly switch to invert as if like oh I'm in a chase here better switch to invert real quick
---
Ok cool. I got worried for a second here, glad to know you were just trolling when you said looping is toxic.
---
It still gets you killed
---
You’re lucky. Most of the people I play with groan and say, “can we just DC?” When there’s a Pig. The only other character we say that about is Bubba because they all play the typical douchebag style as well.
---
They aren’t gonna put kids in the game, they said that about the stranger things chapter, but maybe it chapter two when they’re adults
---
It's ok to die as a survivor some times
---
How have people been playing against the Demorogorgorogorgorn? My friends and I can't even find the DLC?
---
if you happen to arrive at the same window multiple times that's one thing. If you're doing various twists and turns it's going to happen sometime anyway. I just mean it's stupid to hug the same window over and over without even trying to get away from the killer.
---
Besides, if you're actually trying to escape it's not like you're going to remember which windows you've already used anyway.
---
I swear JoJokers feel like I just slapped their mom when I say the show is trash.
---
I have no interest in watching the show because people just spam that shit all over the place.
---
People have been whining about both, mostly the portals and inner strength
---
Yeah. Lithe (as a killer main) is much harder to deal with, because after a vault it takes the killer longer to get to you anyway. It creates much more distance if you're running, but if you're in a loop already (think the gens in a jungle gym) lithe is less useful and nearly wasted because you don't need to yeetus deletus to a loop.
---
So while BL is very situational it can be more useful because of how you need to proc it and how rare dropdowns are with some maps, whereas lithe is more accessible it's much easier to waste.
---
Demo is basically super doctor.  Can lay out a 3 Gen immediately, keep it safe, and actually close out chases during it, leading to actual kills.  He's upper mid.  His biggest downside is the new trend of letting survivor control a chunk of killers power, but he can recover from it better than some.
---
Have my F that's a painful fate
---
The only bad opinion I have of him, is that he can teleport too often. Last night, I followed it to the exit gate, he placed a portal, and went through it. As soon as he started leaving I was on the door. As the exit gate opened he came back via portal and almost hit me on my way out. I havent been able to play him, but I really like its abilities
---
It does appear that people have mixed opinions on him.
---
Bloody Tapp checking in. Can confirm, fellow tapps are few and far between. 
---
Damn I play Jeff a lot too...I’m a glutton for being chased with the loudest grunts in the game.
---
you forgot the shitpost
---
Most people who say Jojos is overrated are people who havent seen it or are part skippers lmao I bet this guy never even gave the show a chance but thats just a hunch
---
Okay buddy. I'd like to wish you a good day and hope you have a nice life. This was a nice conversation. Maybe you should come visit me soon? I live in red ranks, if you can find your way there.
---
Well which do you think is coolest or scariest?
---
Spirit moves around really fluidly and quickly; it's all about predicting where survivors are going to end up. Most stealth-oriented option because her terror radius is smaller and she can teleport. Good if you want to be hysterical and weird
---
Clown is harder to play because he's not stealthy, but you get to throw bottles to cattle survivors and cut off their options. Fun if you like being fat and intimidating
---
Plague is gross noxious chunderrific fun. Infection on survivors is a little random since it's up to them to cleanse, so it's more of a crapshoot whether you'll get the one shot purge. But when you do it's incredibly easy to two-shot any survivor unlucky enough to be out in the open. Great if you love puke and whack-a-mole
---
Idk, it's not that I think nurse is less powerful than spirit, I just have less fun against spirit than I do nurse. Nurse has constant feedback and you can outplay her pretty consistently because there are tells as to what she's gonna do. With spirit to me it just kind of feels like a guessing game. I never feel satisfied or like I outplayed them, I just feel like I chose the correct option.
---
your art style is lovely, hope i'll see more content from you
---
His charge up, I think, increases his fov, which can make movement feel strange.
---
I notice that Nea players have a habit of leading the killer to their teammates and not saving ppl...
---
He seems ok, though the cloaking seems pretty inconsistent on both sides, easy reveals don't reveal, and sometimes reveals happen when they shouldn't. all ik is that he's a really funny killer since he can butt dance and peak around corners. cracks me up, and occasionally scares the crap outta me
---
My games always start off like shit because me or one of the other survivors basically spans inside the killer's terror radius and he instinctively knows what gen we are going to at the very start. Meanwhile when i start as killer, it takes me a minute to find the first survivor even with whispers because i just so happened to patrol the gens in the wrong direction EVERY SINGLE TIME
---
yes, because the point (which should have been obvious) is that you're both delusional to a degree where figuring it out doesn't even matter
---
Damn i never thought a generator could be cute
---
Hahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahhahahaha YES SALT MY FOOD :)
---
Even better OWO
---
His pounce is fine, the only problem is that you can literally move faster in a open area, they need a bigger CD in his pounce, or a big stun if fail, why would I use portals when I can move twice as faster and can patrol places?
---
R/UsElEsSnObOdY HaHa i aM JuDgInG OtHeR PeOpLe's sEnSe oF HuMoUr
---
Usually (in my experience) lithe, if wasted, causes a hit or a down anyway. The hit gives you even more speed and distance, and if you get downed you most likely end up on a hook, thus resetting exhaustion
---
Wait, really? I think he can be looped pretty well by a good survivor but he has more consistent map pressure etc whereas Hag cannot be looped unless the survivor has a flashlight. I'd put them in the same tier.
---
It would make sense lore-wise, how every time they are sacrificed, they lose a bit of their soul.
---
I'm not on the PTB, but it looks like from what I've seen that the Demo could be pretty scary endgame with his power in concert with things like NOED and Blood Warden.
---
Bruh I fucking hope we get something like this make it an hour long episode. Do one for each killer and survivor and what they’re doing to survive. We gotta remember some of them aren’t necessarily bad just situations and they did the bad action.
---
That’s not too bad, he could use a couple buffs potentially but I also like where he’s at right now too
---
Do Bones, mate.
---
If the Killer hasn't gotten any kills, you're not under a ton of pressure. Do bones.
---
Pretty good job OP
---
Yeah you’re clueless and don’t know how to play against the demogorgon lol. Kids like you will get good killers nerfed
---
You don’t play survivor much do you
---
Ive had rank 3-11's complain that Trapper's OP cause of his lunge
---
ok...? you still only get one gen done when it could've been two
---
Although annoying, he’s probably one of the most balanced Killers. He has good map pressure, he can be looped but can also punish Survivors who get greedy or make mistakes and he does actually get stunned for missing his chainsaw attack, either by bumping into an object or by his cool down when missing it.
---
Sorry that you just died pal, better luck next time, git gud
---
There's an entire mechanic built around looping. Bloodlust.
---
Your brown rank is showing.
---
\&gt; If you want to see unbalanced "killers" go play Deathgarden. When Spirit is anywhere near The Veteran, you let me know. 
---
That's okay, we have two imbalanced Killers in this game.
---
\&gt; Nurse isn't OP, her add-ons are. There's a huge difference. 
---
No, Nurse is OP by nature of her power, but she's a necessary evil. If you think the ability to shut down literally any tile and end any chase in 10 seconds balanced, I want what you're smoking. But again, it's okay, because she gives you feedback and feels good to play against.
---
\&gt; And oh yes, I haven't played against one of the most popular killers in the game. That hasn't happened. At all. Nope. Not one bit. 
---
I meant you don't play Survivor, because you don't even know how the Killer works from the Survivor point of view. "Just listen for the whooshing 4Head."
---
\&gt; DON'T LET SPIRIT SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING. 
---
And when she does see me, I just get to die? Well. Designed. Killer.
---
#OH YEAH TOUCH ME
---
nah, I changed my mind I'm tired.
---
No purpose apart from occupying the killer so the gens can get done
---
E.g. the central purpose of the game
---
Portals are faster though and the CD on pounce is substantial enough for it to be harmful.
---
No, Nurse and Spirit are most definitely overpowered. All of the 'tells' that Spirit has are washy. She doesn't have to have a whoosh, her standing still could be a bait (near a loop or not), and even if it isn't bait she can easily hear you, see your scratch marks, or see the grass moving. She is always 100% in control of any and all mindgames. Any and all counterplay she has is all based on luck and hoping they're bad at Spirit. If you're found, you're fucked. Playing in this "it's stealth or bust" mode is unfun garbage.
---
I get forcing stealth scenarios in this game, but there needs to be some kind of way to actually run away from and lose killers if you're found. Believe it or not, it is possible to run a Nurse around for a bit and maybe even lose them. It's hard, but doable. Against a good Spirit it's quite literally impossible.
---
There's a difference between killers being the 'power role' and killers just rolling over survivors. See the above Huntress v. Spirit point.
---
The new killers is perfect. Bad players are simply going to be bad using him. 
---
With that being said, and I can't believe I'm saying this … if you're new to him and not a godly killer, you should run ruin as soon as you get it in the blood web. That really does help until you learn how to play him or just in general. 
---
He doesn't need any buffs, nerfs or tweaks. There are perks that can help you. Use them.
---
Pharmacy is a fine perk and Vigil actually used to be pretty good on release. So at launch they definitely were not the worst characters. 
---
Freddy also was decent before he got nerfed into the ground. Remember Me and Blood Warden are decent perks too.
---
Clearly you got outplayed
---
No, one gen gets done instead of 2 gens getting to 50%
---
God that reminds me of the time I got tunneled for 3 gens by a doc. He kept losing me cause I had Poised but would find me again and just keep following me, finally got me down after the gens were done and proceeded to camp me on hook, the door was right there and my team opened it they got me off hook, took hits and on my way to the gate he DCed.
---
Personally, I think it's problematic balance wise that there are structures where the killer has to just give up.
---
Dances? No. Emotes? Yes. I want more emotes such as "heal me" or just a simple yes or no.
---
Pretty mid tier. Not as good as Myers.
---
I don't think you know what Delusional means... but go ahead good sir don't let me keep you from ranting!
---
Personally haven't tested him enough but what trickster said is essentially a really good survivor will loop the demo around for a while. His power doesn't counter loops. But freddy's snares does counter loops.
---
Also Freddy's teleport can be used at will. Demo has to actually set them up.
---
Also freddy has a built in slow down mecanic (sleep).
---
And it takes you a whopping 20-30 games before you're back up in an area where you belong. Killers that haven't spend 3 months away, and are in brown from red, WILL jump back up rather quickly. But it's a good thing for them to spend a few games down there because perks and meta have changed. Rank isn't a deciding factor into deciding skill, but it DOES indicate how much you've dedicated to being good. And is a pretty good indicator as to who is going to be more of a problem for the killer to get ahold of and beat.
---
Not every game needs to be turned into fucking fortnite.
---
I'm actually that survivor main lmao
---
Oh you think so too?
---
Dude you’re the exact type of person that ruins the community. People are just trying to have legit conversations. Why not just agree to disagree and move on? 
---
Staying by the hooked person while all gens are getting done is a terrible idea. At least 2 ppl will get out and I can’t believe you would pip since your emblem scoring would be super low. You have to get in chases and gate keep gens from being done. That’s a part of the pip system.
---
How about super hag? looks like he can be pretty good at camping the basement.
---
Ok, so you haven’t seen it? Then shut up about it being overrated
---
Anyways, stealth is a terrible idea because if it fails and you get too committed to it, you’ll probably get hit, then have to do a chase while injured. And, if it’s spirit, that’s probably already a death sentence. And if you stop trying to hide any earlier then too late, you’re going to get found.
---
The game is about chases, and the chases are what’s supposed to be the most fun. Thats why clown, spirit, and old legion were so controversial, they make chases unemployable. And hiding usually results in getting hit against any competent killer, which means less chase and chasing while injured. And don’t even get me started on running perks like urban to make stealth “better”...
---
Whatever, point is, stealth isn’t a good idea against killers with special awareness, which is (usually) most of them.
---
I mostly play survivor.
---
Pwyf is my favorite perk to use on bubba
---
Just wait until they play the Hawkins Lab. It will be over for them before it even started.
---
Yeah, he just said he hasn’t watched it
---
&gt; Ok, so you haven’t seen it? Then shut up about it being overrated
---
JoJo is trash.
---
You on the ptb?
---
Well, because Demo don't have portal cap and don't need one to teleport, right? I'm 100% sure that they don't intend to make that pouncing in a straight line faster than actually walking.
---
Current survivor meta is Adrenaline, Dead hard, Balanced landing and Decisive strike. If you’re not selfish like I am, switch out DS for Borrowed time.
---
I guess a 7 second time to open gates is quite short, might lower it to 25 or 30 percent
---
Ah. I was thinking a forced DC.
---
He'll be missed dearly
---
Lery’s itself counters billy and good survivors would loop him and force him to a m1 I think he’s balanced
---
If she has the good add one she can be alright, but she’s shit on loops. And her power can be easily countered.
---
I mean being how it's just billy but 2 hits and way easier to dodge I would say he is just fine, maybe some portal buffs would be nice though
---
So it's tunnel vision but not tunnelling gotcha. However if you call it different the thing stays the same: it's a weird behavior nobody wins from, not killer, not survivor. Everybody in the match including killer gets way less BP and also the looper is practically denied of their item because it's really hard not to kill a person you tunnel the whole game.
---
I think some buffs to his portals would be nice but yeah the gorgon is in a really good spot right now
---
Yeah, it is if you know what you're doing and don't just stay in the same 4-meter area running in circles.
---
Ahh, that might be what it is
---
*when you nut but she keeps sucking*
---
I could have sworn this was posted before on this subreddit
---
LET ME GUESS KENNY DIED AGAIN?
---
It does have a cool down if you miss trust me, and you also can’t turn for shit during the whole Cooldown.
---
No he doesn’t he’s strong but not in need of a change
---
Hey buddy, I think you got the wrong sub. r/forsen is 3 subs down
---
For example mount ormond often spawns a shack with two jungle gyms and a rock loop, which is absolutely too strong if the jungle gym rng is good.
---
There is nothing wrong with strong set ups as long as they can't be accessed anywhere in the map (looking at you asylum)
---
Naaaah. I think it's fine as is honestly. Requires a bit more thought about placement, plus unlike Hag traps (need to be triggered by a survivor to be used) you have more control on when you can teleport so I think being limited is a fair trade-off.
---
Come to red ranks and see how that works out for ya. Maybe bad killers will lose you like that but when in a lobby vs a killer who knows what they’re doing, the only option is to loop
---
Pharmacy, plunderers, dark sense, slippery meat
---
Its def silly that you depip for winning the game fast lol
---
Agreed. 
---
The best skill any killer main can learn, is when to disengage
---
This happened to me yesterday and I actually thought I imagined it thank you for confirming my sanity
---
Not saying hes op, it just seems werid that someone like legion is punished way harder for something less powerful
---
I’d be super sad I spent lots of blood points on him if I didn’t love the character
---
Lorewise it's because the entity feeds off of hope. Crushing survivors ruthlessly doesn't give the entity any hope to consume.
---
Logically you get points and emblems for actions taken. The longer the game, the more actions. If you're doing really well, slow down a bit and play with your food. Enjoy a nice stress free game where you're in control. You won't find very many games like that once you start getting ranked up.
---
I hope it will work out too bud
---
I would venture to guess most survivors would say their favorite part about DBD is the chase aspect, rarely have I seen survivors say they prefer mind games over trying to see how long they can hold a chase and buy their team time. Spirit completely deletes that and it’s why people don’t enjoy playing against her.
---
No real reason to straw man.
---
I better be able to get it with Shards
---
They do gens?
---
How can you sound pissed in text?
---
Too bad she wasn’t hooked by a killer that was slightly taller
---
If you’re lucky?
---
The reason for exhaustion perks is to prevent a hit (SB is prevent an insta hit, lithe for in the chase escape, BL for the same thing, and DH mainly for nurses because they are effected by it the most)
---
If lithe is wasted you're giving the killer a free hit 
---
(Small glimpse into how I play)
---
I play it as mathematical and logical. If I smack this person, where is it they will likely go. They will have the distance advantage, so I have to be proactively reactive. 
---
I also play it like this: each person is going to have an exhaustion perk and likely adrenaline, so each chase I keep an eye out for it and see if they even have one. Then it's a matter of math "how many times have I smacked them? How quickly were they healed? Was I chasing someone or saw someone as they were healed? Medkit?" Counting the survivors and noting what they are doing.
---
After that, most people will have D-strike, so going after the unhooker is a better option (that and it's less of a dick move. It's not their fault they were farmed if I'm close enough to down them again) However if the game isn't going my way I will down the unhooked but leave them, both for D-strike and the need for yet another person to stop what they are doing to try and pick them up.
---
Overall, exhaustion perks are meant to act as a buffer between you and the killer. Lithe being wasted means a hook for you sooner than later, and since this game on the survivor side is running the killer around so others can play M1 and spacebar simulator. Because of this when I DO play survivor I run either BL or DH so I have easy, not wasteable access to an easy exhaustion perk.
---
Also, another counter argument to lithe is multiple survivors working on a gen. You may not be the one being chased, but you may end up wasting lithe anyway to get away to prevent you from being a side casualty, or sandbagging another survivor looping the killer. Also, another argument is gens in elevated places (docks, yamokas estate, 2nd floor gens and so on) where lithe isn't usable, and they are super dangerous.
---
this is how all survivors look when they're getting ran through with Mikey's Kitchen Sword
---
THE ENTITY IS DISPLEASED
---
Yeah, but I don't wanna seem like a bad guy either :P
---
If he’s not op nerfing him would be stupid seriously let’s make a not op killer worse he does get punished just not that hard also he gets pretty damn punished if he hits any object one of this good things is closing distance with his chainsaw so yeah let’s ducking make his map pressure worse chainsaw is used for getting around and this would just make him clunky and weird
---
If they gave him a slowdown it would just turn into leatherface without the instadown and I'd hate it
---
I don’t understand, you just said that isn’t smurfing, and I said it is? Playing lots does mean rank, but NEW players will be low rank. And those red tankers that group with 3 brown rankers will be put against them. I don’t understand the issue here
---
Billy better than nurse? Nah dude lol. Even a good billy you can deny him chainsaws if you’re smart with map awareness and stick to safe loops, a good survivor makes Billy a m1 killer.
---
Nurse is just bullshit if any player invests a considerable amount of hours practicing her blinks.
---
Spirit for sure.
---
Oh I know but I'm just giving my thoughts currently and how I've seen it used by skillful players and stuff. I feel we can all have opinions about something even if it might be a little soon but that's my thoughts glad you said with all due respect though means you mean no offense which is nice
---
 Kind of like a series of unfortunate events, each chapter being put into 2 parts for both characters. Each episode with then waking up by the campfire or in the fog.         
---
        
---
Season 1 (7 episodes) is basically about the main 3 killers + 4 survivors (Call it, Idk, the beginning or some shit with each individual story).       
---
         
---
Then the later seasons use their other killers, using 8 episodes each.         
---
S2- A nurses calling; Flesh and Mud, Spark of Madness, Lullaby for the dark       
---
-An episode each for the 4 killers + 4 survivors. (Flesh and Mud pt1 (The hag), pt 2 (Ace)).     
---
       
---
S3- Curtain call, Shattered bloodline, Darkness among us, Demise of the Faithful . Same again      
---
          
---
Idk if they could access licensees characters, maybe ghost face being that he’s only the mask. The others would have some word contracts, + retelling an already told story. Wouldn’t make sense for the stranger things chapter being on Netflix.          
---
Then they could have seasons were it’s the gameplay in action. So it’s like watching the 
---
game in better quality, + talking of course.   
---
      
---
Just thought the concept was cool and the characters they’ve made are episode worthy at best.
---
Guess there’s not reason to play Billy then because he would lose a ton of map pressure if he got stunned when ever he got out of chainsaw while patrolling the map
---
Holy fuck that’s amazing!!
---
Really? Am I that blind I can't tell enough because when I look I just see teeth or decoloration in the back
---
I agree completely except they gotta pick a single survivor. Either Bev or Richie...only because they’re kinda the main focus of the Pt 2 film
---
Your data is saved into the cloud. You won't lose anything. Dedicated servers just mean the killer won't be the host of the game anymore.
---
And baby demogorgons can't forget that
---
Very cool
---
Killer mains during Ash's release would like to have a word with you.
---
Haddonfield I can understand, but DC on the Game instantly? I'm not a Billy/Huntress main, does that still apply?
---
First on my list would be Wraith, just because of the background story.
---
You never see him before he sees you. What is with that
---
It’s a direct copy of clown
---
Best advice for finding survivors quick, go for the furthest gen from where you spawn. Most of the time you'll run into a survivor there or on the way to it.

I run this with sprint burst and vigil. I legit power walk everywhere pissing off my friends.

Good job fellow meg main
---
Why is this only 90 upvotes? This deserves more
---
When people call the stranger things dlc the best chapter
---
I honestly see Laurie Strode waaaay more than Adam
---
If that happens for over 30 seconds l just leave, that usually gets 2 pallets or a hit or if nothing then less wasted time
---
It's happy someone finally hit a great on it
---
i give it a month before survivors will go back to the meta and killers will spam billy/spirit.
---
i mean some are still good like Adrenline or mettle of man, i mean as a killer ive just come to accept these perks
---
Excuse me while I just *kicks generator*
---
Yikes
---
I like to combo PWYF with STBFL and Rancor aka the One Punch Man Build. 
---
You simply break chase every time you run into the obsession for PYWF stacks and never hit him so you rack up STBFL stacks and remain there for most of the match. Once the last gen is popped you can insta-down and kill them with Rancor.
---
Just a paper bag will do.
---
Preach
---
No i don't mean when he got out, when he like hits a wall like LF. Its dumb legion is stunned
---
The ones on the third floor 💀💀💀
---
You
---
A good billy is more common then a good nurse too
---
I mean i know how the game works I just think its dumb that the survivors could literally purposely derank you just by doing nothing like b r uh
---
It *is* hard if the killer is using his brain.
---
??? He gets stunned a pretty hefty amount
---
Yeah but I feel how  people are reacting to are making it out to be much better and I'm gonna be real with you I feel it's kind of weak on most maps, because most loops in the game of some sort of bend to it or cover where a lunge wouldn't be able to be bit.  As someone else said previously its great when not getting looped but close to useless when getting looped (besides those big long loops you see on the corn maps you can get hits with the  lunge from far away. You have to think also everyone is playing on Hawkins which is kinda on the demogorgons map which means it'd be most effective on there with it's long staircases,risky pallets etc.
---
Pretty accurate except for the Spirit's Placement. She’s as good as the Nurse in my opinion.
---
No, it was hard for me to tell too
---
If you like pressing mindlessly W and breaking 18 safe pallets (literally the max amount I have seen) while praying the survivors aren't on gens, go ahead.
---
No i dont want him nerfed either. You could give him some buffs in return and make him more punished.
---
Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d0fu3m/pretty_good_perk_so_far/)
---
I think demogorgan should be a bit lower he’s High b tier or low a because while he does have a lot of good powers nothing that helps in chase per say it helps with that lunge but survivors can still loop him like any other killer just have to be more careful
---
Yes daddy just like that ahhh~
---
Thats some Jurrasic Park shit lmaoooo
---
works out just fine, thanks.
---
I think it's probably because they use a base skeleton meaning it has a head in it like all the others and they tried to obscure it best as possible but they didn't do it good enough.
---
Me when I find the right video after 90 minutes of searching
---
I find a lot of people doing that on the ptb. They also play like rank 18's so they all end up either dc'ing or killing themselves on hook
---
I’m a killer main but that range is a bit to far with no drawbacks
---
I think SS and S are dumb. Just make it A-F. Also I don't think Demo will be higher than midtier even without nerfs come live servers.
---
Feel like it's a bit too on the Rock, kind of music, it also feels a bit too bombastic compared to the other killer chase themes.
---
Epic
---
do you have ig or tumblr?
---
r/TIHI
---
Did you just call mettle of man good?
---
Idk nurse ignores all chases and while spirit can play mind games she can’t tp through everything she still has to walk around it spirit requires mind games and can be outplayed nurse requires stealth and juking
---
You can run the "not get hit so you dont get injured and make noise" perk
---
What a qt, have my updoot
---
Red rank killer thinks survivors seeing their own scratch marks is going to be op. *bruh* good survivors already know where there scratch marks are... the algorithm isnt complicated and I use it to juke all the time. 
---
And if you're referencing the walking speed while injured, it's still slow af lmao. Nowhere near game breaking, stealth builds are inherently worse than chase and second chance builds... they provide much less value individually and to the team. They're crutch perks who take their load of the pressure and put it onto their teammates shoulders, selfish and not viable.
---
I just don't agree with Legion's placement.
---
Should be at least high C tier.
---
It's an amazing killer in good hands and with the right perks/addons.
---
so Nurse and Spirit are fine but Billy isn't?
---
We're conditioned at this point.
---
Have you met survivors making you derank on purpose by doing nothing? 
---
Me neither.

I have Instagram : themelfernandes

Well, know that somewhere, far far away, there or survivors who don't post on Reddit at all :p

Thats crazy, i was thinking the same thing lol

You're not helping anyone by PMing people "lol that's wut u git." Don't be that guy.

Have fun!

And take some set of cards with you to pass the time while being camped at the high ranks.

CHECK OUT PAINRELIEVER, SOOTHING VOICE, GUIDE MAKER AND OVERALL GOOD GUY.

Most of what you said was negative. Not a big deal, just disheartening.
---
Just learn how to run left or right lmao
---
Have fun. At the best ranks. I recommend avoiding hitting red because ya know, cancer...
---
My friend i can sense some strong clauddete vibe  from you, who hides in bush, not doing gens, and as you said not looping, so basicaly die in less then 30 seconds. I hope i will never get you in game as survivor, and hope i get you in game as killer. Also git gud.
---
I personally don't use ebony mori but why hate on people that do ?
---
I mean technically you can't blind anyone with a low wattage flashlight like the one they're using. Also killer would have a much larger range of movement in their neck, and never get locked in animation. That's why it's a game.
---
You feel a draft?
---
Good survivors will notice you immediately when you're following them.
---
Thats not the problem here. Not saying hes op
---
I think it’s because of the PTB, doesn’t it get an old saved file?
---
They shuld change the anmation then
---
He is betwen A and B, so I Just pulled him to A with Spirit since he will most likely be buffed. Also that's not the point of the post
---
Your powers of deflection are quite strong indeed, but I am curious as to your answer about Fun putting people down. Like Istormpush never once stated it was you Fun was being toxic or whatever against, he was merely stating it as a general populace. Also zubat is shite. Dude slugs every other game when it's unnecessary and is an absolute toxic survivor.
---
Its really depends on the map. Maps like cold wind you would be harder to spot opposed to the fengs and neas with bright blue and pink hair. I would try to keep your cosmetics neutral unless you have a specific map offering.
---
I am kinda hoping for The Phoenix , an idea from HybridPanda, had a cool concept.
---
I really like the idea of removing the cap on the blood points gained from the categories. However, I still think there should be a cap, like regardless of how much you get you still can only get a cap of 32k from the end of the match (besides perks and offerings advancing that for after match bonuses).
---
Just use brown. I can spot Kate much easier with silver hair.
---
Please don’t tell me you watch ochido
---
KYS: start the match sacrificed in Spectator mode
---
That was made back before Quentin even released lol. Jake is my 2nd main. I'm on Reddit is Fun app so i rarely touch flairs since the app doesn't have an option to change em. Have to desktop it to do that.
---
Couldn't find a link but you can just find it by searching Steve's gameplay on youtube
---
Ugh. I like quentin's current face. You can mass downvote but don't argue with me.
---
But also fun plus bamboozle with Legion is fun.
---
lol that happened to me the other day versus a pig. When the gens were powered he tbagged me. I messaged the guy afterwards asking him if he enjoyed the depip. Claimed I was salty even though I pipped. Fun stuff
---
Well it's something different to say: "Well she had bloodlust 3 speed" or: "She had addons which ..."
---
And even then there is no reason to nerf her base kit at all when her addons could be re-adjusted.  
---
&gt; I honestly don't know what Ghost Face's or Freddy's you're facing but I've seen some solid ones throughout purple/red ranks and they still have potential 
---
Well of course. You get people that suck sometimes through red/purp games. I've gotten 4k's as perkless wraith on rank 1, but that doesn't mean that he has potential.  
---
It's the same with freddy and ghost face.  
---
They can win, but against a good team, they shouldn't.  
---
They can. But they shouldn't.  
---
&gt; Also any killer is capable of winning at red ranks 
---
Yes. I agree. And that's because not everyone at red ranks is of equal skill.  
---
I like the analogy Tru3talent makes here.  
---
Red Ranks could be seen as Gold Division - Master Division of League of Legends.  
---
Sometimes you'll face a red rank of "Gold" skill. Sometimes of "Plat" skill. Sometimes of "Master" skill etc.  
---
If you're a perkless "master skilled" wraith you might shit on some "gold skilled" survivors.  
---
But most killers, just by their design, are going to lose against equally skilled players because of how the game is designed. (SWF, Gen-Speed Progress, Killer Pip Progression etc).  
---
If you end up facing survivors that play optimally, and you play optimally yourself, there will be lots of games where you just won't be able to win with most killers.  
---
Spirit, Nurse (and some people might argue: Billy) are able to.  
---
Others aren't.
---
And like I said: That doesn't mean that you won't be able to win games at red ranks with certain killers.  
---
It just means that there will be a limit to most killers which survivors can easily take advantage of.
---
On the topic of jojo, your opinion on the show being everywhere is one thing, but saying it’s overrated trash without even watching it isn’t really fair. I do agree it’s everywhere and it can get annoying but I don’t dislike it being everywhere.
---
Clown is annoying because he cancels loops and essentially forces you to camp pallets, but that’s neither here nor there.
---
I do believe the game is about chases beyond just “it’s what it evolved into”, because you don’t get bp or emblem points for hiding, you get them for running the killer around and chasing. I’m not even really super against nurse tbh, she’s honestly fine to me.
---
Again, spirit is just a guessing game with the odds stacked against you and if you fail you lose the game. There’s no fun outsmarting or anything. There’s nothing fun about guessing wrong most of the time and dying.
---
No, I tend to spend my time doing gens, healing people I come across who need it, and I survive far more often than I die.
---
Probably because I don't spend all my time looping the killer waiting to get killed.
---
100%. Look guy, we're all here trying to have fun, why do you have to taunt me? Especially when I know I'm not great at this game and I'm trying to get better?
---
You forgot 4, which is people that don't want any changes, which seems to be the majority of this sub.
---
Personally i am your #2. I think mid tier killers are fun to play against, nurse and spirit are not.
---
But i also agree with Killer mains that says mid tier killers are not competitive due to gens being done way too fast as soon as ruins is gone.
---
The Spirit... is a killer 👀
---
Deafness should just apply the oblivious status effect. So one can run it as a double-edged sword to counter TR related perks like Infectious Fright or Overwhelming Presence, or the Doctor.
---
Mori’s don’t bother me too much cuz I’ve been playing the game for a while. But killers that use them on newer players that are still trying to learn how to play are assholes.
---
Lol thank you for the link to the flower.
---
It’s satisfying in an awful way when you get facecamped after a multi-gen looping. Like ya fam, be upset and lose this game.
---
Imagine being unable to make a point other than going “smurfing isn’t real”
---
What? Thia tier 4 is just as small meg mains brain, everyone in this sub wants that top tier killer be nerfed a bit, or nerfed perks (aka Bones ones) or wants survivors to be slowed, such as generators and perks being nerfed aka adrenawin
---
good for u
---
I think those would be interesting not as a type of perk, but just modifiers that give you bonus BP if activited
---
"Im sorry, little one"
---
From what i've seen so far, he isn't as strong as A tier (Huntress, Hag, Freddy), but he is stronger than B tier (GF, Myers, Plague, etc). You can't compare his current version with spirit or nurse or even billy.
---
And noed
---
Care to define "toxic"?
---
It is really fun!
---
I just wish the *PLING* sound wasn't used so often. It is loud and it hurt my ears.. :(
---
What would he change the perk Blindness too?
---
Yeah no go into tofu’s stream and ask him what his favorite thing about the game is and he’ll say it’s the chase. Mind games are involved in chases I.e. moonwalking, pathing, playing tiles but spirit standing still doesn’t fall into any of those categories. He says it in a lot of his videos too especially his video on why he thinks the nurse is boring. It just sounds like you don’t like him judging from how angry your post is.
---
Any good killer hides their stain and good survivors play around that anyways. There’s way more to a chase than following a stain lol it’s why people enjoy running against killers like huntress, Billy, Hag, Freddy... the chase is two sided, I put output
---
Fr brotha
---
I don't agree, but you have a point, maybe they nerf him, but yet, that's not the very point of the post
---
Sleep paralysis demon as new killer please
---
I do. You must only be tier 1 sleep deprived. I’m tier 4.
---
&gt; everyone in this sub wants that top tier killer be nerfed a bit
---
Your the first person i see say this. Everyone goes ape shit whenever i suggest a Nurse nerf. But anyways i def agree she needs one.
---
&gt; wants survivors to be slowed, such as generators and perks being nerfed aka adrenawin
---
Yea i actually think both of those changes is a good compromise. Slower generators AND weaker top killers.
---
I’d put ghostface in B and demo in A
---
Spirit’s is fun yes
---
Are you oblivious to the fact that OP is joking? Lol
---
Why would they nerf him? He's fine imo.
---
I want a perk like small game to keep count of totems. That way NOED has a perk based counter meaning nobody could (reasonably) bitch about it and it’d make it easier to deal with as a solo survivor.
---
👈👈
---
Speed limiter.
---
i don’t even remember the last time i’ve seen a laurie
---
And when did I ever say something about Zubat?
---
What dicks. I'll never understand trying to directly ruin someone's fun because they are doing something really basic like that
---
&gt;had me dying
---
idk if this was intentional but it cracked me up
---
Very true. But there's about 4 times as many survivor mains than killer mains and they tend to be very vocal. You have to be able to bully the killer while playing blind for those people to maybe finally be fine with a killer. Most killers are shit on red ranks and so will every new killer...
---
Lmao, I've had a killer complain about Mettle of Man. AFTER nerf
---
Exactly. The person that wants to be chased isn't doing generators anyway, same with people going for flashlight saves. In that sense, it's actually good for you. The survivor you are chasing and the one flashlight saving or wanting to be chased are both not doing generators.
---
That might have been someone else then, if not you.
---
Well yes i saw people complain but somehow whenever i suggest a nurse or spirit nerf people claim they are fine. Anyways since i'm essentially agreeing with you i'll stop arguing lol
---
What a weird comment. Nurse literally ignores survivors best chase options which are pallets and windows, but that doesn't feel like cheating? With this logic, every killer in the game is more unfair than Nurse because you have to heavily rely on pallets and windows.
---
Oof. Im not terrible good at looping so I've been running Spine Chill, Lithe, Quick and Quiet, and Dance With Me, to escape the killer in a chase. I guess I should stick the stealth lol. Im kind of the distraction of the team
---
Don’t get me wrong, I can’t see all the situations and outcomes of these perks. You made some solid points in your argument.
---
One day we might just see a video of a great play only possible by one of these perks.
---
no you haven't
---
negative perks don't use a real perk slot.
---
I've never heard of anyone being called trash for using Dead Hard. I could buy Decisive Strike before the changes to it.
---
Games have a mental aspect to them too, not all plays are within the game
---
What’s the Kate treatment?
---
Me too, except i was already about 90% so i was like "fucking NAILED that skill check, lets go!" For 1/10 second
---
Pretty sure its edited
---
Ah okey then it adds up
---
I can’t tell if the trapper mask is actually there or just edited on but it looks good either way
---
I mean... Both cases, particularly stranger things were relatively easy to suss out before hand.
---
I would put Hag and Huntress higher on that last. Hag is a tough killee when played right
---
Imagine not checking usernames before posting such a comment
---
Brand loyalty only helps companies, not consumers.
---
And still no explanation or evidence of when he’s talking down on people. This is maybe my 4th time asking. Just deflection
---
^(fuck) you...
---
As a killer main I believe that all survivors have to do 25 gens and take 10 mins to finished and when they get hooked they are on stage 3. Only proper way to balance the game. Also, no pallets :)
---
No lie. Here's the vid! https://youtu.be/TFMh5wZRZNU
---
i dont think so, it says walking speed. i'll try to remember to get on the ptb but i cant text myself because of the 0 tolerance for phones policy
---
lol gotta love the downvote/no reply combo
---
good shit
---
Why thank you.
---
&gt;If we're going to be expected to grind for all these perks, make the Grind less stupid and make it where you can actually get ahold of everything sub 300 hours in.
---
Are you really complaining about something that has been addressed in this exact moment on PTB and should be on live version in a few weeks? 
---
I don't get it. 
---
As for your other complaints, I can't really argue against it. Sucks that some great perks are locked behind a grind and a paywall but at the same time, what would be the point of playing DBD if not trying to unlock better stuff?
---
where do they complain about it? do i need audio or something?
---
There's s reason I stay at rank 10ish, diverse killer and survivor meta
---
Maybe if you stopped DCing on your second down you would have enough points to actually level someone up instead of complaining about it on reddit.
---
Well then learn English lmfao
---
LMAO
---
Switch Laurie with Jake and it’s correct
---
Yeah, I wasn't bringing perks into consideration but I do agree with that
---
&gt;That's okay, we have two imbalanced Killers in this game.
---
Nurse is slower than survivors, and she can't cancel blinks. Use that to your advantage.
---
&gt;No, Nurse is OP by nature of her power, but she's a necessary evil. If you think the ability to shut down literally any tile and end any chase in 10 seconds balanced, I want what you're smoking. But again, it's okay, because she gives you feedback and feels good to play against.
---
Hypocrisy at it's finest.
---
&gt;I meant you don't play Survivor, because you don't even know how the Killer works from the Survivor point of view.
---
You don't even play killer, and this is coming from a survivor main.
---
&gt;And when she does see me, I just get to die? Well. Designed. Killer.
---
Play stealthy and you wouldn't have that problem.
---
One day everybody will want shirtless Quentin

You just dodged the same question the other guy asked. When has Fungoose been toxic? Just shut up honestly you’re obviously just talking out your ass

No I actually clipped out the part where it shows his gamertag and where he messaged me. But that guy DID send hate mail about that, called me a toxic hook camper.
---
Inb4 you against a billy and they see it once and hard tunnel from across the map
---
I think Billy is extremely strong, with very little potential for error. He’s easy to use, and godly when used correctly.
---
But I don’t think he needs to be changed. He’s simply a top tier killer. It is what it is, just learn to counter play better.
---
Completely new voice.
---
Honestly, Nurse herself doesn't really need a nerf. It's just that Nurse's addons absolutely break her. Playing against a no addon Nurse, or at least some of the weaker addons that aren't OmegaBlink is actually super fun. She brings a lot of variety to the game (ironically since people always complain it's nothing but Nurses) because you don't loop her like any other killer. It's all about open space mixups and just making her blink to the wrong spot instead of running the same loops over and over again. 
---
The problem is that Omegablink just eliminates any counterplay. She *always* is in range for a mixup during a chase and there's no real punishment for missing because you can just get back to them in the next blink. If default Nurse misses a blink you gain distance and she has to catch up and loses time just like any other killer, but Omegablink just keeps coming until she wins a mixup and you're down.
---
I honestly think it's symptomatic of a bigger problem of the game as a whole and that's that killers are so addon dependent. Addons/ items are a nice little bonus you can have as a survivor but the majority of the killers *need* to keep spending bloodpoints to run addons in order to even stay viable.  This is just more my beef with the game design as a whole though, not really a balance concern.

"I, uh, clipped it out yeah. Just believe me!"

lmfao
---
Yea thats true
---
She's quite amazing on loops? Not sure why you would think that lol.
---
This happened to me too, what do you play on?
---
I mean you shouldn't really worry about the killer being able to spot your hair more effectively because ultimately this isn't a stealth game but a time management game.  
---
It doesn't matter if your hair is red, blonde, brown or whatever if the killer strolls up to you while you're on a generator.
---
Halloween was pretty great
---
&gt; They literally cut the grind in half past level 40.
---
And this doesn't help anyone get every character to level 40 at all. That's where the issue lies; I've played this game for 200 hours and still have half the roster I need to level up, I could not care less about  having to worry about everything after 40 as of right now.
---
That's how ridiculous this grind is.
---
&gt; what would be the point of playing DBD if not trying to unlock better stuff?
---
Dead by Daylight doesn't need to force people to grind for stuff, it just does it anyway. I mean, people who started when the game came out have everything unlocked because it was a much better grind (grind up two characters to 40 in three months. not that hard) and yet they still play.
---
PS4, first time happening. I think it was somewhere last week
---
SHE'S SLOWER THAN SURVIVORS!
---
Imagining trying to give your own thoughts on a new killer that isn't popular opinion amirite fellas? Seriousness aside I don't get the salty main posts either
---
Half my roster is leveled up.
---
That doesn't stop the fact that people who don't have perks on characters they like to play are forced to play unleveled characters because the grind in this game is fucking stupid.
---
Is that why I've been thanked more than anything else? *snaps*
---
You still have to make a guess when she holds out her hand. Same thing you have to do against Spirit. With her, its different though. Spirit standing still is the equivalent of Nurse holding out her hand.
---
I don't know what the difference is to this community. Both require you to make a hard read and if you guess wrong, both will punish you for it. I guess since Nurse has been the same for years and Spirit is relatively newer, that people have more or less figured it out at this point.
---
Cos he’s not as sexy
---
You forgot the focused focus one.
---
Oh I'm with you. It's in a better state. It could be even more optimized,  but they keep putting more in and now they can't stop to focus entirely on optimization. I love this game, which is why it hurts to see it in disrepair. I hope they can find balance and keep the game alive while still fixing the issues that are mucking about. They are getting better! Time will tell. 
---
By the way, good on you for keeping a reasonable attitude. Its difficult to have a discussion with people nowadays and talk like human beings.
---
Good point but still no reason to insult someone though
---
Ah ok
---
Once you get past yellow ranks you can't be immersed. Most killers have at least 1 braincell and check around when they lose a survivor
---
So(n)y please leave, take your 20fps third person cinematic trash somewhere else.
---
So do facecampers.
---
I mean it's not like both were extremely obvious from a mile away I'm happen Paulie managed to compile the information though and show it to his viewers but if you looked at any leaks during that time it was so obvious
---
Well i like them so
---
I know, but i don't wanna make people mad
---
I think the Demo is great and ghostface is ok
---
3rd best, billy and nurse are top 2. Unless your console.
---
And he is really good
---
Are you in red ranks? Nurse, Billy and spirit are extremely frequent and more often than not the nurse knows what they’re doing.
---
He bout to het nergens watch my words
---
It would be great, but I dont see it working on any big human killer. Do you imagine hillbilly crouched with his chainsaw?
---
Thats why Decisive Stone is a perk
---
I think trapper is a good/great killer and legion..... well i don't wanna be killed for saying legion is good. And i just feel like ghost face is kinda week

“Spirit is a very hard killer to master, she takes skill using audio and mindganes to outplay survivors. - comment I’ve seen a moron make
---
Is that why I've been thanked more than anything else? \*snaps\* 
---
Your response is being a dick, my response is just advice. I only do the PM at low ranks for people I assume don't know any better. Its all about how you phrase it. Maybe \*you\* shouldn't be that guy...
---
You're not forced to play anything.  You can level up your survivors as you go, like play as dwight and use your points on laurie or whoever.  
---
Having the perks you want doesn't just give you an easy win for every match.  You want D strike because you get tunneled "every game," but you still only get the one strike.  Sure it buys you some time and distance but that doesn't fix the problem.
---
I THOUGHT IT WAS DOUBLE BLOOD WEEKEND AND IT IS NOT AND NOW I AM SAD. THAT IS ALL.
---
I know, but the pig is in a bad spot and i feel that ghostface is too
---
Just kick the generator over and put a new one there, like "SERIOUSLY THESE THINGS."
---
In the words of Socrates, go fornicate yourself.
---
I FUCKING LOVE SABO SQUADS WHO PISS AND MOAN WHEN THEY GET SLUGGED AS IF THERE IS ANY OTHER COUNTER. THEY JUST WANT TO BULLY THE KILLER FOR THEIR FAILURE YOUTUBE CHANNELS
---
The lunge is long but very specific, it only goes forward, unlike the normal lunge.  
---
Plus there's an extra time penalty for missing.
---
They can't check every direction. You're usually going to get away. If not the first time, then the second time. It's extremely unlikely you'll get way multiple times just to be found again. If they don't outright lose you most killer will be distracted by someone else or a completed generator.
---
Locking and removing these messages since they turned into personal attacks rather than contributing to productive discourse. Keep it civil please!

---
If there is a killer speed debuff for the first 3 minutes, I can see this working. Would be great for trapper.
---
Nurse is best on console still, just a lot harder to play. And it also depends on add ons. Spirit with prayer beads is the best killer in the game except maybe 1 hit Huntress with 3 hatchets.
---
Alright bud
---
LOL I FEEL SO ALONE SOMETIMES BECAUSE I DON'T GET BOTHERED BY NOED AT ALL BUT SLOPPY MAKES ME WANNA PULL MY HAIR OUT. WHAT A BORING FUCKING PERK
---
Wait until tier 5 bruh that's where I'm at
---
&gt;And this doesn't help anyone get every character to level 40 at all. That's where the issue lies; 
---
The grind to level 40 isn't that bad to begin with. It takes roughly 1.000.000 which can be obtained after playing about 24 killer games averaging 22k using nothing but BBQ (if you burn puddings or survivors burn BPS the amount of games drops). 
---
24 killer games is roughly 6 hours of playtime with lobby time included. 
---
&gt;I've played this game for 200 hours and still have half the roster I need to level up, I could not care less about having to worry about everything after 40 as of right now.
---
The grind past level 40 is the one that actually matters because you must choose at least 1 main survivor to play, get him to full perks and every new teacheable you unlock will be immediately available on him. 
---
&gt; I mean, people who started when the game came out have everything unlocked because it was a much better grind
---
????
---
The grind was much worse when the game came out. 
---
I am not saying DBD grind is perfect but this sounds a lot like a you problem.
---
It is fucking run the time it’s takes for us to break it gives you time to hide
---
That's kinda lame tbh, either buff the amount or give "unlimited" uses
---
Look at the way you're talking dude, do you actually think me giving you any examples to you is going to be worth my time? You're just going to keep brain-diarrheaing all over the place like the pigeon you are and accuse me of lying because I didn't clip what I saw almost one year ago. But I'm excited to see your mental gymnastics in action so here it goes
---
This one game I saw him play survivor he was looping the killer for quite some time and, after the last gen popped, he got hit by the inevitable NOED. Now he did do quite a good job at keeping the killer busy to the point where he actually solo-carried that game so naturally he was pissed. Called the killer shit for relying on NOED, and made this long ass point on how he doesn't need it. Okay, fair. He is very good at the game and everyone hates getting cucked by NOED, let the guy rant for a second
---
But he just kept on going and going and repeatedly had to call the killer trash. I went afk for a handful of minutes and when I came back to my computer he was still going, ranting about how a skilled killer like him doesn't need that perk, because he ALWAYS has one guy on the hook, one on the ground, and is putting pressure on the other two.
---
Does that make him a shitty streamer/person? Hell no, and the fact that it all got triggered by that stupid ass perk makes most people including me sympathize to a certain point. But he definitely put that guy down and is not the behaviour I expect from a streamer whose main selling point is him being educational and all about having an improver's mindset
---
Oh look, somebody to bounce on the idiot's dick. Nobody cares that you feel disgusted and he didn't make any real criticism, he made really half-baked claims that were highly unsubstantiated. For example, his initial claim is 'the point of mending is to waste time' which is pretty much a no shit sherlock platitude and it clearly doesn't address why this suggestion is here in the first place. Then he defends it by bringing up unrealistic worst-case scenarios as a follow up. I'm sorry, but this idiocy doesn't deserve any hand holding, but if you want to be there as his mommy to make him feel better, you're free to do so.  
---
Actually I've been coming up with plenty of logical responses to each of his 'counterpoints', but I suppose if you struggle with basic literacy then you won't see that. Instead you get triggered by any shred of banter and ignore any of the substance behind what I post. But I'm not going to cater to small minded people like you or this other dipshit troll.
---
I have many problems with this list. 1,the demogorgon isn't even out yet we can't just throw him into a tier just yet as he could get changed and he's likely to get way worse with time as people get better at countering him, 2. Why is nurse A+ tier while Spirit is S? Nurse is so much better while Spirit can still get looped 3. Legion A tier? His ability is useless it's just stunning yourself for a couples seconds making people mend for a little. Besides that I agree with it (besides Hags and clowns but don't wanna make this too long.)
---
THAT MAP IS MOSTLY LUCK FOR EVERY SINGLE PLAYER IN THE TRIAL. JUST AWFUL
---
The demogorgon and hag are nothing alike though they play completely differently
---
So I come from competitive Super Smash Bros Melee originally and that definitely puts me in category 1. In that game, pretty much every character is stupidly strong. Fox, for example, has a frame 1 move that's invincible, combos into itself infinitely (if you have borderline TAS execution), reflects all projectiles, kills at 0% if you hit them offstage with it AND is extremely advantageous on block. What stops Fox from absolutely running shit is that like 8 of the characters have just as "broken" of mechanics that let them compete. When every character is strong enough, these "broken" mechanics start to just feel like tools that each character can *reliably* use to win.
---
This is kind of how I feel DbD should be too. Killer powers should be a checkmate situation when they set it up correctly. As a tradeoff though, survivors have safe, strong pallets and perks they can use as resources that the killer has to slowly strip away when they have pressure up. The problem is that there are too many killers like Ghostface right now (and this is coming from a pig/ GF main). GFs power is the exact opposite of what a good killer power should be. It puts the impetus entirely on survivors: you can only theoretically mark a survivor if they *let* you mark them. They instead need more powers like the Spirit imo where when you pop her power it is actually up to you to make a play and not up to the survivor to mess up. If they could balance more killers to be like this while maintaining balance such that survivors don't just get rolled by a bunch of Spirit-tier killers i think it'd be the perfect game.
---
It has a decent cool down if you miss dude. And again it’s extremely easy to dodge. You’re the type of person that I want to shut the hell up. Quit trying to get good killers nerfed just because you can’t counterplay.
---
i think they call it freddy krueger
---
You just need to do a quick tap to reset the timer, or you could just destroy all totems before the 3 minutes hit.
---
Spirit Above Nurse? God no.
---
Spirit is strong, but you can't compete with something that can have insane range and blink through obstacles.
---
ACTUALLY it activates after the gens are done, gates don't have to be open. And how would you feel if you completely outplayed the killer, but he gets ONE LUCKY hit on you, and he happens to be running noed? And because the killer is desperate, he camps you too. I imagine you'd be pretty salty.
---
With such reductive reasoning like that, I'm surprised that such a person sees fun in anything. Have fun being a bad salty survivor.
---
And one of the doctors cosmetics
---
Spirit with prayers beads is op, but an add on doesn’t make the spirit better than the hillbilly overall.
---
Just happened to Me

oh look, another thread wrongfully complaining about a non existent problem. Keep adding to the bandwagon.
---
Absolutely, I'm pretty sure every slasher except Jason starts by creeping around almost smelling the air for their victim while the victim hides in the corner. It's pretty iconic on just about all of them.
---
I definitely don't mean for them to have a full on 'crouch' but a height adjustment in general would really help sell the feeling of stealth.
---
As a survivor main when I fight huntress I keep my camera at a certain level. If this sneaky huntress used something to go Undetectable it would absolutely throw off my game.

PLAYING KILLER WITHOUT IT, ESPECIALLY ON CERTAIN KILLERS, IS GENUINELY AWFUL. MAYBE IF BHVR FIXED THAT PARK OF THE GAME BALANCE IT WOULDN'T BE A CONSTANT
---
I, someone with only 100 hours on the game was easily able to not get hit by it alot of times. The people complaining just have zero skill
---
Cotie wants to thank you so much for playing his game. :)
---
Thats honestly really cool, I love it!
---
Self-care is ok, but I pointed you to dwight for bond, which in most scenarios is better than self-care. Self-care requires that you do nothing, uninterrupted for 32 seconds which, while equivalent to two people in the healing animation for 16 seconds as far as efficiency, is much riskier than being healed by someone else because of your exposure time. Being found before 32 seconds is up means that time was wasted. Most of the time you'll find yourself injured off of hook, so we'll make it is often the better choice for a team overall.
---
The only times you'll ever find yourself injured and not hooked is if the killer is really bad and loses you in a chase, if you're really good in chases and they give up, or if you're taking protection hits. If it's scenario #1, you'll win anyway, if it's #2, you won't mind being injured because you'll be able to waste the killer's time again anyway, and if it's #3 you traded a health state to keep a teammate up, so you're hardly "losing" health, you're more or less just transferring it to a teammate.
---
Im more offended you didn't use the meme properly tbh.
---
Yeah but even then, with no add ons Spirit and Hillbilly are still very close in how good they are and really just depends on the player. Spirits purple add ons are much better than billys and you can use a purple add on most of the time if you get every perk unlocked for them.
---
Don’t respond to trolls - you only encourage them.
---
Why mention hitboxes? I don't see the connection with the image.
---
There is no such thing as a "good looper", you run in a circle, that's basically it. It's benny hills simulator rather than an actual horror game
---
Honestly, this perk seems like it'd be good for newbs to see how scratchmarks work, but the grind to get it kind of ruins that idea lol.
---
R1 killer/survivor here. Demo requires the longest setup time to take full advantage of his portals and can be countered easily. I've leveled Demo up to 50 and I'm a p3 freddy I can say with absolutely certainty Demo doesn't match freddy. What Demo does well is late game plays if you can kill a survivor by then. I would rank him as C tier. He's still fun, but once he goes on live servers he won't be very viable ranks 10-1.
---
More like a plastic one.
---
Why would you waste time finding totems? That gives the killer time to hunt you down and kill the team faster.
---
I PLAYED AGAINST A SPIRIT WITH BEADS WHO WOULD ABANDON CHASES AGAINST INJURED SURVIVORS ELSEWHERE ON THE MAP TO PHASE BACK AND TUNNEL DOWN UNHOOKED SURVIVORS. PURE SCUM
---
You're not understanding what I'm saying, or I'm explaining it horribly.
---
The simple fact that there's *nothing I can do currently* about getting tunneled down is absolutely frustrating to the point where I don't want to play the game anymore today. At the very least being able to equip a perk that is specifically counter that very thing would drastically reduce the frustration, and would buy time to get to an actual defensible position.
---
That scream was hilarious!
---
Demo... really isn't **that** strong. I'd place him between B and C personally
---
I'm just giggling my ass off. Survivor mains all cried for their dedicated servers because of "BS hits" and Behavior's incompetence fucks them over. It's beautiful. Because they always cry to get what they want and they got what they wanted and it still got fucked. 
---
"Waaahhhh! We want to play with our friends! We don't care if that will destroy the game's balance just shove it in!"
---
"Waaaahhhhh!" Freddy too OP pls nerf!" 
---
"Waaahhhhh! Legion too OP pls nerf!"
---
"Waaaahhhhhhhh! They nerfed Mettle of Man! That was a fair perk!"
---
"Waahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Nerf NOED!"
---
"Waaaahhhh! Nerf the Nurse!"
---
Constant fucking crying. Get fucked you crybabies. If we complain about the balance or SWF we get told to shut up, accept it, you're bad, SWF with mics isn't that common well by the same token are the "bs hits" as common as SWF with mics? Go fuck yourselves. Suffer.
---
BIG FACTS. FUCKING FUCK KEYS. THOSE AND MORIS. CONGRATS ON PUSHING THE NEXT BUTTON ON THE GAME. YOU'RE SO GOOD
---
* Rule 3: Shaming other players
---
* Rule 8: Oversaturated Content
---
Honestly if I loop a killer long enough for my whole team to do the gens leave I see it as a win even if I die.
---
THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING A LOT LATELY
---
I am understanding what you're saying.  You're angry about a string of losses in a game and you wish you had one of the tools that makes it a little easier to deal with.  
---
If you're at the point where you are DCing out of frustration it's time to take a break man.
---
Even if you do get the stun, you’re still fucked. It would actually be better if it wasn’t there, cuz it just ends up baiting new survivors, and a good killer won’t run through the pallet.
---
Hag and Trapper both have set up, so i dont see the differnce. Plus he still has 50% of his power without the portals
---
They're probably saying they got hit from that distance in which means hitboxes are buggy in the PTB I guess?
---
You can tell if you hear a chainsaw kinda scrape, just learn to listen
---
I had a Legion do almost that exact same thing as we were walking out the exit door. Frustrating as all get out but whatever.
---
There no point. The killers that would have it already have a new stance.
---
Guess it fits with Amanda making her traps impossible...
---
From my personal experience, yes.
---
I love your art style
---
Is there a better feeling in this game than a well executed body block?
---
I dont know, some people say they never get revealed, others are always revealed, so i think it matters on that
---
Teabagging isn't a mind game, its just being an asshole.
---
i mean thats a straight fact but why the fuck is that like "OH MINUS POITNS WHAT A FUCKING IDIDOT SXDDDD"
---
Oh, that's part of ruin? Ok, that's really strong still and will make teams more aggressive with totem hunting. You can guarantee good swf groups will have one person with detectives hunch or small game.
---
You sound mad and bad.  Stop blaming others for your bad games.
---
It’s only out for the PTB on pc
---
i performed 4 sacrifice where points
---
Provoking your opponent into making poor decision is exactly what a mind game is
---
I'd settle for any beast type killer tbh at this point. We need beasts.
---
So sorry, guess I’ll go kill myself✌️😞
---
Thank you so much 😊
---
💩
---
That's kinda sad.
---
Thank you ❤️
---
this is a really good rendering of badham 2-5
---
The good part is you still got time to set up since the 3 minutes give killers some clarity time.
---
Ruin is more of a plan B.
---
* Rule 7: Spam (flooding, excessive self-promotion, ...)
---
what? that map has tons of strong pallets
---
Considering I've never been marked and down by a gf and only succeeded a 99% mark twice, I call bullshit; that is not true.
---
2.5 seconds can make a big difference, and they can block your stalk AND reveal you in much less than that time. Might as well sneak up just to get a hit or close a gap instead of waiting for them to run away on the off chance they're exposed. Even if he somehow became viable by some esoteric meme strategy, he's still a pathetic installment with exceptionally limited creativity l, let alone utility.
---
I do a lot better with both the wraith and the pig than I do with gf, so yes his power is not the same concept or as effectivene as  the wraith or pig. He's not as good as peppa pig with her most recent nerfs, and she's not hardly viable at purple ranks.
---
Just because a killer cant go through a wall doesn't mean they can't be S tier.
---
&gt; Like Istormpush never once stated it was you Fun was being toxic or whatever against, he was merely stating it as a general populace
---
Shit. How dare I not understand the question in this super poorly phrased comment that was clearly meant for someone else
---
Haven't they used temporary voices for the PTB in the past? Maybe that's what this is?
---
&gt;They're probably saying they got hit from that distance in which means hitboxes are buggy in the PTB I guess?
---
Hitboxes for basic M1 hits in a straight line have never been buggy. 
---
Being hit from that distance probably means the ping wasn't 0 (who could've thought). If you factor in ping to that image, OP's character was a little behind, making his model perfectly in range for that hit. 
---
OP was kind enough to not mention how high the ping was so if he had something between 60 to 600, I don't see anything wrong with the image.
---
* Rule 8: Oversatured Content
---
Ha ha I guess.
---
Actually it would make sense for a stranger things episode because Nancy and Steve are adults so we can find out why they were chosen together, as previously it was one survivor to one killer
---
And you got your sacrifice points.  Killing a survivor off of a single down is worth significantly less than downing and hooking them 3 times.  
---
You get points each time you hook them, points for chasing them, points for hitting them with your regular attack or using your power.  
---
So if you hook all four of them without allowing them to unhook and heal one another you're not going to get even a fraction of what you possibly could get.    
---
Every round of killer you should be aiming for 32,000 points (the max score) which you get from any number of actions in four different categories.
---
Shit, that sucks.
---
Yeah. Been on that end of the story several times.
---
yeah but it's just not fun. i actually want to try and play around loops with people. survivors who just toss pallets are boring
---
I worked with them for over 11 years .. in this instance it’s really simple.
---
Could get into mythology, Minotaurs or Anubis.
---
BING BONG YOUR OPINION IS WRONG
---
It has potential, if like to see the devs experiment with things like this in the test build to get some feedback on future tuning of the mechanics.
---
Im theory no it should not. It's all rng.
---
If I was playing a friendly game of basketball against someone, I could make them perform poorly by puncturing their tires and/or making threats against their family. After all, not all plays are within the game.
---
I'll admit, if a survivor starts to teabag after pallets I'm tunneling them. The post game tears are so tasty.
---
That'd be nice, but out of 2 whole days of playing games I only had 5 killers that hadn't been camping the hooks. It's a fucking PTB, what's the point other than to grief?
---
Again though, you deflect. Yes I got that 1 part wrong but you still haven't answered the other part.
---
So that means everything is fair game? Even when your mind game actively makes the game less fun for everyone else?
---
I dont follow directly behind them. I just follow far enough to keep eyes on them and know where they are going, if they stop I hide behind something
---
Someone has to lose, sorry but that’s the way player vs player works. Just get better and move on
---
Fixated: The perk some y'all motherfuckers need in real life.
---
Top tier would be A then. Nurse can be very strong but it takes many hours to master the timing of her ability's, which is quite difficult seeing as most of her add-on's are worthless and mess up your timing... making it more difficult to learn.  Then you have to be able to predict player movement without LOS, learn what items you can go through  at what strength of gasp and what you cant go through at all. After p3'ing 6 killers I'd rate her as the most difficult killer to learn to play well.
---
Demorgogon is the new locker
---
They could just test it out by playing nancy
---
This happened to me as well a few days ago. It was also the exact same spot. I still have a screen shot. 2 keys were inside that box. Luckily someone found a key and we managed to escape through the hatch.
---
I know Pig and Ghostface have a solid crouch, but it would be nice to do something to help other killers possibly build stealth.
---
Doctor, Hag, Legion are built to find survivors. But there's perks and statuses to help other killers find survivors.
---
Plague, Pig, Trapper are built to delay survivors. But there's perks and status to help other killers delay survivors.
---
It's pretty hard for a none stealth built killer to actually be stealthy, so I think this (or something like it) would be a handy way to help with that.
---
Put Ash in D for console and it’s right. Nice list
---
Also works well with sprint burst, but it only makes you walk faster while uninjured.
---
Let me know if you ever want to play - Free tomorrow and Sunday - Rank 8

Sure, that’s all I was asking for buddy. You went through your own mental gymnastics instead of answering the fucking question lol, throwing out insults like a child. That’s all I wanted was to see when, because circumstances like that are rare. Call me a dick rider as much as you want but I don’t remember something like that happening and I always watch his streams, but sure. Next time just justify the shit you’re talking instead of getting insecure and lashing out. It’s still a video game remember
---
I think they are not of the category 100% must have in the build, but can be good niche perks.
---
For example, Billy + Tinkerer + Cruel limits will be very strong.
---
Or Pig + Mind Breaker is not that bad of a combination either
---
Similarly, Nurse + Surge will be quite effective as well (she doesn’t kick generators at all, but having that allows her not to worry about the gens and chase people non-stop).
---
Something among these lines.
---
150% true
---
In the bloodweb you *always* get 2 perks, if you only have 1 available, no its not rng.
---
No but it means they can’t b ss tiers
---
You'll have to wait another week or two for it to be released to everyone
---
I think he’s completely fine as is.  Maps just need better balancing now.
---
Perks show up randomly. It's never guaranteed you'll immediately get a perk you bought off the shrine on your bloodweb.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d0kszr/annoying_glitch_pc/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Wait explain the plague/legion thing to me quick. Ive never played as them.
---
Happy birthday :)
---
So you mean to say 3 bloodwebs had 0 perks, and when you go to shrine it says you own it??
---
Scarily relatable
---
The difference is you have to actually travel through your portals to make the most of them and that takes a lot of time.
---
Too many killers just have a massive ego and will throw the game because they can’t accept when the survivor is just a better player
---
Clown has pop goes the weasel, and if you don't have that unlocked via the shrine, you should go for THICC GASSY BOI.  
---
It's great on almost every killer.
---
Lore wise it isn't hope, that's a very common misconception, the entity actually feeds off of any strong emotion, that dude you see rage quitting every game? Feeds the entity a right feast he does
---
It takes 3 seconds to teleport, and they have a 15 second cooldown. Survivors then arent doing gens by closing them
---
I guess he saw you as someone who just botched and moaned just because.
---
how is trying to survive toxic
---
Guess so
---
Some downvotes... what do you disagree with?
---
Eh. With doc you still have to go through the pallets. You can drag the game to last like an hour but you'll propably still lose against good survivors
---
Not every killer is supposed to be stealthly
---
Gotcha thanks
---
* Rule 4: Encouraging and/or enabling to break the End User Licence Agreement (EULA)
---
well you can like mindgame and if the loop you are dealing with is too strong you can just abandon the chase
---
&gt;Yeah, do fucking totems, that's why noed exists, so that you have a reason to do them because it's still an "objective"
---
I couldn't read anything else after that but come on. Really? LOL.  So NOED exists FOR survivors now? Just for an extra objective for them right? And it doesn't, let's say,help the killer to get like a couple of easy kills after being bad for the trial? 
---
So based on this theory, Adrenaline,DS, MoM and Borrowed time exist for the killer to help him/her get another hit for more bloodpoints? Exhaustion  perks help killer to chase survivors furthermore for more blood points? 
---
Idk what else you are gonna find to defend NOED but that was a stupid attempt
---
I read this at first and thought you fucked up a Nancy Drew reference.
---
Nothing to fix, he was on your ass dude
---
Did Myers get woke?
---
How have the Devs forgotten this game?  They are putting out a huge licensed DLC with TWO survivors and a new killer and completely reworking the blood web generation, not to mention dedicated servers are coming out soon.
---
I see more post about salty survivor mains whining then I see of actual salty survivors whining...
---
Imo a survivor that still has plenty of pallets left and plays it safe should not be caught by the killer if he makes no mistakes.
---
Where it should get interesting is that if survivors play too safe, then they run out of pallets and lose, but if they play too risky they get caught by skilled killers.
---
But right now its not really how it works.
---
Either the Killer is literally unstoppable (top tier nurse) where even with all the pallets still alive survivors can't dodge her.
---
Or at the opposite, you have a killer like GF that simply feels useless against a top survivor team, because even if you break all pallets fast, the gens are done way too fast.
---
Imo the solution is Killers to be around mid tier strength (huntress, hag, Freddy), but also have somewhat slower gens.
---
Game ruining? I personally think it could have its injured restriction removed. No other buffs for it though, just that.
---
What do you do after getting stunned by a pallet?
---
i'm laughing so hard omg poor claudette
---
Congrats man!
---
I FUCKING SUCK AT THE GAME AS BOTH SURVIVOR AND KILLER, AND TO ME THE DOCTOR IS THE MOST ANNOYING FUCKING KILLER IVE EVER PLAYED AGAINST STOP MAKING ME HALLUCINATE YOU FUCKSTONE
---
"i dont have to rely on pallets windows" because you literally cannot utilize those things against the Nurse, how the hell do you find being robbed of escape mechanics more enjoyable than being able to utilize them?
---
Yeah, but I'm already gonna lose more often than not because I lack map knowledge and skill.  I just don't accept that I "gotta" have a less interesting time because I have one slot and like five perks to choose from, instead of having the full toolset the game is balanced for.  I do think developers should avoid mechanics like this in multiplayer match-based games.
---
This photo is just proof that cats live for one thing, to destroy everything.
---
Shirtless David should always be forgiven.
---
the *ACTUAL* legion
---
&gt; You're assuming no off games or games where you just get stomped. Not every game is going to be a 22k game as Killer.
---
You understand what AVERAGE means, right? Some games you will finish with 30k, other games with 15k. 
---
I am starting to get bored of this discussion because you seem to be actively looking for issues instead of accepting the solutions and working on them. 
---
&gt;Not every Killer is going to have BBQ when you level them up. If you level Bubba first in order to get BBQ, then sure, the first couple of Killers will have BBQ, but after you unlock more and more perks it's likely you'll end up either never seeing it or only having 1 rank of it.
---
Which is why right from the moment you start playing DBD, you choose a character (one survivor and one killer) that you will get all the perks and play as him to enable other characters. Once you unlock BBQ from bubba, you will get it in the first bloodweb of your main character. 
---
&gt;If you play every single game as only the characters who have BBQ, you'll lose a ton of variety. Should everyone only spend their first 200 hours playing Doctor or Legion since they're the best Blood Point farmers?
---
You don't need to play Doctor or Legion to farm as they aren't the best ones, they are the easiest ones. My "data" came from playing as Hillbilly. Also, you don't need to spend 200 hours playing the same character because you don't need every teachable immediately. You listed yourself just 3 perks. It shouldn't take 200 hours to level 3 characters to 40 and get their perks on your main character. 
---
&gt;35 characters (including Stranger Things) at 6 hours of grinding is still 210 hours of gameplay, and you can't argue with Just use BBQ and offerings because you won't have those on every Killer.
---
Again, you don't need every teachable unlocked on your main character and getting all the perks on your main character just became easier with the bloodweb update. 
---
I am done with you. You are clearly looking for problems and excuses to bitch about the game instead of using your brain to grind in smarter ways.
---
Take my filthy upvote good sir!!! But I have purposely said in kyf’s that I was running devour hope and the moment they cleansed it they shat bricksssss
---
Looks like the clown from Hell House LLC wearing a new outfit
---
They can provoke all they want but then they cry when they get what happens when you provoke a killer.
---
People want to shut posts like these up as if the devs see a few people saying he needs adjustments they'll jump on the bandwagon and nerf him immediately. We've seen this done before with ghostface. 
---
You're completely entitled to your opinion as well as im entitled to mine (as killer sided as they may be), people don't want another good killer to be nerfed that's all.
---
There's nothing wrong with what happened.
---
This is one of the reasons i only play survivor as SWF now. Too many quitters.
---
They are the one stuck with Doc on the Game. I may lose but it will be hell for them too. After 40 hours I stopped trying to be friendly, as well as had to block my steam account from all the "baby killer comments" . I just don't give a shit anymore.
---
GOOD
---
Nice. If it's a work in progress and it's this fucking good, I can't wait to see the completed design.
---
Have an upvote for that good idea. They are rare here on reddit
---
are you 100% sure you brought the perk? if so, try restarting your game.
---
But yeah those are top tier killers in uncoordinated matchmaking, they should be winning most of the games. The top tier survivors still find ways to loop and waste time for a little bit, especially if it's a smart 4man with comms (but that's a whole different can of worms lol). But yeah I agree, in a game that's mostly about running in circles around walls, a character that bypasses walls completely is always going to be annoying.
---
 
---
&gt;100% agree with you. The addon system  is kinda stupid. Especially when things like eboni mori completly  breaks the balance of the match, or red hatchets for huntress.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Rare addons should be fun and interesting, not broken. For example, Myers's addons are fairly well done.
---
Yeah eboni mori's are stupid and should be flat out removed and a couple of the red addons need toning down. I *guess* it's the dev's balancing of 4 survivors bringing in Brand New Parts or max speed toolboxes or something, but it just feels like a 2 wrong's don't make a right sort of thing. Myers' are great because they are strong and completely change his playstyle but none of them are a guaranteed win.
---
holy fuck lmao
---
This sounds awesome! i would love to see pennywise in DBD!
---
That's the point of licensed characters you toxic fuckwit
---
Even on dedicated servers he would had hit you
---
I mean tbagging also slows you down when you could have been sprinting away at full speed so like 🤷‍♂️ a tbagging survivor should be easier to catch lol
---
Take the down and wait for your teammates to get you. That’s kinda how this game works...
---
Got any links? I have seen any posts and searching for “Demogorgon OP/nerf/etc.” just brings up a load of *these* types of posts telling people not to call for nerfs/call it OP and so on.
---
huh?
---
Are you kidding me? There is feng, bill, dwight, ace, should be in a tier
---
You are a trash survivor main, change my mind (oh wait i don't care).
---
Yes.
---
I'm just gonna chime and say NOED was preventable just do bones if you see them but MoM you had to play certain killers where they're attacks didn't count a M1 not giving a stack of you played m1 killers you had to suck it up and get looped by someone with 3 health points. It also rewarded bad survivors because you just had to get hit for it to activate nothing else nothing more.
---
I've noticed the reveal only works in a small radius around the centre of the screen and the debris hitbox is pretty garbage.
---
No, it isn't toxic. It is a strategy (Though often not a viable one). Guess what is toxic. Teabagging and flashlight clicking.
---
Lol I love getting downvoted for saying he could use some minor buffs. But yeah the map doesn’t need a fucking infinite, and there are a few too many pallets
---
Triggered

When I saw that post I was disappointed it wasn't the Malcom in the Middle reference
---
Run all you want, even quitters can’t escape
---
I don't think it's the connection. The game has huge vertical hitboxes. If they swing while the top of your head is the same height as their foot it will usually land.
---
No, because it has strong, consistent counters. Mettle had no consistent counters. I think logically NOED should be tied to how many totems are still on the map, but it isn't bad for game health in its current state
---
Licensing and new media
---
Oh i know. But when there are 2 other loops connected, they can combine into a single really dirty loop.
---
Yea good for you pal
---
Racism has nothing to do with it. Neon haired Fengs and Neas are also considered to be toxic players. One's white, one's Asian.
---
Noed is a way of extending the game, or punishing survivors for moving too fast.
---
i mean... technically legion has eyeholes, So they would be able to see the light, But you know i get it.
---
NOED rewards bad killer because you didn't need to do anything but wait till end game. If I can do bones and prevent NOED you can waste MoM
---
Ah I see now. You are one of the survivor mains that try to purposely ruin the game, unfortunate. If you really think that killers are more broken than survivors just go try and play killer, it's all I have to say. Not a single person who actually plays killer at rank 1 thinks about the game the way you do. If you want we can talk the hard numbers that prove statistically survivors are worthy of hotfix level nerfs AT THIS VERY MOMENT, but I know you wont. Discord is wonder590#4989 if you are ever interested in discussing.
---
Teaches Survivors to at least try to cleanse totems.
---
Honestly they should be cleansing them anyways for that sweet 1000 Bloodpoints
---
I love these Carson memes being made into works of art
---
i've found a way to avoid this.
---
Anytime someone dcs when they get downed the first time, block them. Every time you queue into a lobby check the profile of all your teammates, if one of them is already blocked dodge the lobby. I get way less games with dc-ers now that I do this

MOM was poorly designed (and overall boring) but it was the first REAL meta perk for survivors in over a year, its kinda sad to see how fast it was booted compared to some killer perks that have been left unchanged.
---
Ikd the sound of a hurt meg is WAY louder than a hurt Ace.
---
That'd be a great cosmetic
---
Im pretty sure they did it by mistake, not intentionally, but yeah...
---
absolutely not. i hate her. i’m a survivor main and i’ll never forget the first time i played against her
---
“she’s just looking at me. she’s just looking at me halfway across the map. what she gonna do, intimidate me into the dying state? yea right keep trying that’s not gonna wor- WHAT THE FUCK THIS BITCH HACKIN SAVE ME PLEASE”
---
So, infinites?
---
That's a great way to weed out the weak, thanks for sharing!
---
Reverse: new killer players trying to enjoy the 3 minute game of looping till toxic tbag escape.
---
Fucking BBQ &amp; Chili for my Freddy. I swear, if I didn't keep going through the bloodweb he could have completed all 3 prestiges by now....
---
What killer perks should be changed?
---
Wasn't even a flex but ok
---
Lol as long as nurse and billy exist in this game I'll always 4k at will, whenever i want against anyone, no effort needed, so im good either way. Whoever says its boring to win every game with nurse is just yeah exactly triggered for dying every game,
---
Nice try Dwighty
---
I like it!
---
Places where it's literally impossible to outplay the survivor and they get a free escape just for being there
---
How can you waste a extra hit though? Honestly I don't like NOED and how it rewards bad players but atleast it has a counter which is just do bones if you find them while MoM only had if you were playing a certain killer to counter it which was bull because you shouldn't be forced to a killer to counter a single perk that can completely change the game.
---
TRAPPER'S SECRETS REVEALED! SURVIVORS HATE HIM! CLICK HERE TO FIND OUT!!!
---
Swap Billy and Freddy and your perfect. (Freddy can't be looped while Billy can).
---
Huntress and Pig in my experience.
---
I like to sneak up on Pigs and try to scare them sometimes and usually they'll be a good sport, oink at me, and let me go away and return back to actually playing
---
WHY AM I FACING RANK 8'S AS A RETURNING RANK 16?
---
&gt; NOED rewards bad killer because you didn't need to do anything but wait till end game.
---
NOED procs no matter what; failure or success and skill level do not factor in. It rewards bad and good killers equally 
---
&gt; you can waste MoM
---
I don't know what it means for the killer to waste MoM
---
I was literally just thinking this the other day.
---
Found the claudette
---
You can run with shift.
---
This would require an update and considering how simple files are organized on DBD folder, the video would be up all over the internet before anyone booted their game.
---
Wouldn't it be nice if we lived together
---
Wouldn't it be nice it autocorrect didn't act like a depressed faather
---
The impact was so violent it made her DC.
---
Hopefully surge gets changed back. I haven't played PTB, so I don't know about Windbreaker; do you fully recover from exhaustion after getting off the gen after 1/2/3 seconds?
---
Good to know, if someone is toxic I’ll just lay back and take it. Seems to be the way of the world now anyway
---
Guess we'll just agree to disagree on that front. Sometimes, people doing stupid things that cost them warrants comment in my book. Especially if you think about the nature of the behavior I'm commenting on in the first place. What is it saying to the person on the hook as the killer wacks them over and over? 
---
Now if the guy is going to the hospital because he forgot to wear his safety goggles, that's probably lesson enough without comment, but if he was actively being a dickhead to someone before he hurt himself...
---
Thank you, I only speak out about potential changes if I've REAAAAALLY thought them over.
---
People say nurse is really good but I’m good with countering. Just look behind you majority of the chase.  If she’s charging a teleport then get ready to change directions/juking. Also if she’s charging then don’t go for pallets or vaults.
---
ONCE YOU GET TEABAGGED YOULL PUT IT BACK ON
---
I'd say next week it could end soon since PTBs are around a week and half or 2 weeks and the PTB started last Tuesday so after this/next week it could end maybe? Then after that the dlc should come out a few days later

Is huntress able to full speed with her hatchet drawn? Is Nurse able to move full speed with her blink charged? How about Michael or Ghostface while stalking? Again, explain to me how Plague currently is destroyed and a bottom tier killer all because of PTB tweaks, hell even the streamer you mentioned Tru3 agrees shes a good killer.
---
And you agrees with me, all killers are viable, and some have an easier time than others. I'm not denying that it's harder to win as Wraith or Leatherface compared to Nurse or Spirit.
---
When the data that the devs release every now and then starts to show imbalances I'll agree with all the rhetoric of how 90% of the killer roster gets consistently shit on but until then and when most streamers stop showing they can dominate with a variety of killers or when I personally start having these problems in my games I'll start to believe it.
---
That's all fine, but wouldn't it be so much cooler if instead of that, Dead By Daylight starts a stream or releases a video? It's been like a year of seeing the same intro cutscene everytime. It would make people feel a lot more special and would feel like a reward for playing every day.  Imagine your favorite streamer launching up the game and being super surprised whenever a new killer is released. Anyways, thanks for Dead By Daylight.
---
Did both
---
F*ckin’ Diabolical.
---
Like a dog waiting to go for a walk.
---
Mematic isn't a meme. It's a tool to make memes easily you dip.
---
“Camping generators” lol
---
The shit these Claudette’s get up to
---
MY FRIEND THERE IS NO POINT, IT IS JUST THE WAYS OF THE ENTITY. TOXIC FUCKERS EVERYWHERE
---
When survivors actually do cleanse totems I see Killers running to forums screaming totems needs to be hid better because they all get broken before endgame. Which one is it? Do bones and don't get downed or don't do bones and get downed.
---
But Billy can be looped. Spirit cant (at least not consistently)
---
Exactly. I don't see anything wrong in this video.
---
Face camp
---
lol, he cant even do irony right. he has to come out and say it.
---
Fire up it’s too strong right now
---
I’d put Quinten in D tier and switch out Jeff, I can count on one hand how many times I’ve seen a Quinten.
---
Tapp is spot on though, that dude gets no love.
---
P3 and iron maindon so scawy, gotta love reddit, making me laugh every time
---
I TRIED TO BE NICE AND SAVE SOMEONE INSTEAD OF OPENING THE GATE FOR MY DAILY AND I PAID FOR IT
---
Only shot once I would of unloaded a full clip on that perk
---
I THOUGHT DOUBLE BLOOD POINTS WAS THIS WEEKEND AND IM CONFUSED AND IRRITATED NOW.
---
I've been trying to get iron will for nea and iron grasp for freddy forever now
---
Um Steve yea Demogorgon here uh time to stop working on the gen
---
Or people just didn’t know I was being ironic, the comment was edited but if you think you’re putting me in my place then congrats to you
---
I had exactly the same after failing a ruin skill check, the meter drained all the way to 0 (from about 80%) then reset itself, I shit myself thinking ruin had been mega-buffed.
---
Gg ez
---
Oh yeah but I've missed some I should've hit too so I've convinced myself it evens out
---
Weird Flex again.... But ok
---
There’s an app called photoshop mix on phones and it’s great
---
&gt;Is huntress able to full speed with her hatchet drawn? Is Nurse able to move full speed with her blink charged? How about Michael or Ghostface while stalking?
---
Completely different killers with their own unique powers.  
---
Plague without the movement speed debuff was still viable and not overpowered. 
---
People didn't even complain about it. (Atleast not as much as they do about the usual stuff).  
---
&gt; And you agrees with me, all killers are viable 
---
No. I said all killers have the potential to win games because sometimes you play against potatoes.
---
If you play the perkless worst killers and your enemies run into you / DC you don't say: "See? I said he's a viable killer!"
---
You've got the win handed to you.  
---
&gt;  hell even the streamer you mentioned Tru3 agrees shes a good killer. 
---
Yea he said she has the potential to be a good killer, but sometimes he'll have a match up where her weaknesses show that she can't perform with the big girls (aka Nurse and Spirit).
---
Let's leave it here. Atleast I will.  
---
You'll have your utopic balanced world where any killer can win any match up but they just have to "try harder".  
---
Meanwhile I'll wait until they start listening to the loud voices of reason which demand/pray for a better balance.
---
Someone has to lose, true. But the winner doesn't have to be an asshole and try to tilt and ruin the losers fun. That's bad for the health of this game community.
---
I hope your condition improves.
---
It also drops image quality off a 30 story building.
---
Triggered.
---
Weird Flex but ok
---
Hearing a bear trap go off and see someone stepped in it, hearing multiple generators complete is also so damn satisfying but my favorite is huntresses stun sound I wouldn't consider it satisfying but funny.
---
Shirtless David when he's injured. For obvious reasons.
---
Not really
---
That’s just camp that’s not face camp
---
K
---
That ace was having an awful day lmao
---
My rule with camping is an eye for an eye. You wanna teabag or flashlight click? Fine, I'll camp you.
---
-Salty Killer Main
---
But his toxicity was so trivial why say anything at all. Move to the next game. You are equating his toxicity  as something somebody should stand up against.
---
Alright so you're screwed and there's nothing any of us can do about it, happy, you clown?
---
Same here. Got it tier 1 at least, but now all I get is Monstrous Shrine
---
You made my day
---
what kind of pen did you use?
---
Based on what data?  I can count on my hands how many times I've seen Adam played, and Ace is definitely not D-tier.
---
Laughs in rotten fields.
---
Tunnelling can be toxic. If the killer is doing it to spite a survivor, to ruin their match, specifically to make them have an unfun time, that's definitely toxic. To be clear, I'm not saying all tunnelling is toxic.
---
Ok
---
Dead hard got it a month ago and here I am 3 level 50 survivors later with no dead hard :(
---
As killer: Landing a chainsaw hit with Bubba. It’s so fucking hard but so satisfying.
---
As survivor: Getting a pallet stun
---
Lay back and take it? No, more like let it roll off your back. Going out of your way to msg and antagonize someone is not called for, I don’t operate that way but maybe that’s how your world works. Whatevs.
---
Imagine not sleeping for a week, beingchased by killers in a weird realm then being told you look like shit lmao
---
A graveyard map would be badass!
---
I like the idea of having an extra hit, but they make it way too easy obtaining it. Every M1 killer got screwed as everybody ran it. 
---
Now it’s 3 protection hits which are buggy, so the perk is basically useless. Removing the gain 1 stack after getting a safe unhook was a bad idea, because not everybody would even be able to use it.
---
New survivor buff is overpowered
---
* Sound of a survivor slamming a dream pallet on you when playing Freddy
---
* Sound of a missing M1 hit right after vaulting a window
---
* Sounds of successful chainsaw
---
...is not skill based.
---
Most of the time it’s cannibal or billy :\
---
I-
---
I would say getting to tier 3 as Myers and downing someone at full health.
---
I thought the other 1.000 threads were also a discussion.
---
Are you sure this one is for real and not just 1.001?
---
You don't get the bonuses if people are dead which is why you get the 25% for each token (for each player alive) but I get what you mean by having a token for yourself is stupid, it's just hard to divide 100 between 3 people. I'd say you'd get the bonus if atleast one other person survives so you can atleast get the 50% from the other person surviving.
---
Ahahahah
---
New killer: The Shadow
---
Took me forever to M&amp;A for Michael Mayonnaise.
---
So I just started playing the game this week, what exactly makes a killer toxic. See people on here talking about it a lot.
---
Strangely i don't really have much of an opinion. As Killer i never use it but i'm happy it encourages survivors to cleansee my totems. As survivor, i'm usually good at avoiding it since i mostly assume they have it.
---
Demogorgon is definitely not better than spirit and billy. In fact, I would say that he’s B or C tier from what I’ve seen.
---
yea but i had to have done something right to get a near perfect score.
---
rank points r called pips
---
Fair and balanced game :'D
---
It wouldn't work because of publicity; people sharing Twitter and YouTube links, the dev team updating their own social media, etc.
---
Yea this game is obviously favored towards killers, specifically talking about lower ranks.
---
I played about 30 survivor matches today, almost all against campers and obvious smurfs. These people also say the most disgustingly toxic things in the postgame chat.
---
If you want to enjoy the game, I suggest playing killer or playing with your friends. Otherwise just drop, because honestly, it's not worth it. This is just a game, but it's one of the worst I have ever seen.
---
Atleast the developers of other toxic games take action against such pathetic low life subhuman players, but it seems bhvr doesn't mind losing countless beginners every passing day.....
---
Yeah mate that works against a baby nurse with two blinks. But as soon as the nurse is good and got 3 or more blinks you are fucked. I played against that kind of nurse that fucks the whole team in a few minutes and it's terrifying. She just breaks all mechanisms survivor got to extend a chase
---
Rank 20 is a blessing.
---
Could say the same for the baby demos and new killer players. 
---
Killer is definitely harder to learn and takes more practice. And survivors can be ruthless...
---
&gt;Or maybe some bug fixes. Id like that.
---
From 3.2.0 PTB patchnotes:

---
I agree on the skillcheck Ding, it's so good!
---
plague above meyers and wraith... seems legit...
---
Then how do you explain the ridiculous hits I get when playing killer?
---
I agree that latency is part of the problem, but it is not the only problem.
---
Hooking Claudettes is music for my ears.
---
Lol I'm a p3 huntress and I still relate. Sometimes the aim isn't that great some games
---
I think this kind of thing would be cool, in theory. Sort of like Team Fortress 2 where you can see average kills, heals, headshots, etc. It would be interesting to know how many kills I've had in total as a certain killer, or how many pallet stuns and gens completed as a certain survivor.
---
Yes, you almost maxed out your Bloodpoint scoring events. What you didn’t do was fulfil the Emblem requirements good enough.
---
Nea is the ***FUCKING ENTITY***
---
no it wasnt
---
This is such a great idea. We need this!
---
Same here man, it’s the only way I can think of it being fair :/
---
I would love any kind of statistics/leaderboards even, although people would probably play more for their emblems/pips
---
I am living for these pictures.
---
&gt;yea i get that but why on earth did i almost no pip for a near perfect game?
---
I just explained and if you want more details, read the ELI5.
---
Same here. I will keep playing the PTB until the dedicated servers are disabled.
---
Ahhhh ok thanks!
---
[Version without watermark](https://i.imgur.com/vj1J5Xr.jpg)
---
Stuff like favourite killer/survivor, best kill/escape rate... etc
---
That would be hilarious if it actually completed the gen! Bad for the killer, but overall worth a laugh.
---
&gt;  i want to be changed is Bamboozle, Mainly bc it was made to fix infinites, but most infinites are gone now. So its just the anti skill perk
---
yo you're the first person other than myself I've seen who also thinks this!
---
How dare you cast doubt on this truth? It is obvious that all killers are toxic campers while all survivors are tbagging asshats. We are absolutely right to be angry and mock them on this sub altogether!
---
As a survivor main who often gets stuck playing with potatoes who don't seem to know that scratch marks even exist, I can only hope they all use it.
---
thats... just not true... just cleanse the five random totems... its five things, total cleanse time is under a minute, split into 4 people, for less than 15 seconds of work per person. And now with the new perks, you have MORE reason to do totems. Even then, its not reliable enough to run blood warden and think you are safe, so it isnt a great perk in any build, just a meh perk with a ton of counters. If you are gonna complain about something complain about bbq or something
---
yeah same, i went back and forth as to whether make a low effort comment, or a slightly less low effort post, i went with the post. Don't think it'll get much attention, but i'm happy enough with it
---
didnt know you had to get stunned to break pallets
---
I want the third season just so we can get Emma Roberts
---
Did you reply to the wrong comment?

Hitting someone with Billy's chainsaw is satisfying as hell.
---
The sound when you hook somebody (not the scream is again pretty satisfying
---
My biggest issue with Billy is the snowball. I start the match and 2 seconds in there's a Billy charging at me from across the map. Then he starts bouncing around with bbq and it's just so much pressure. I rather play against Spirit or Nurse any day. At least I know I can take 2 hits from them. Billy with whispers is terrifying to play against.
---
&gt;Then how do you explain the ridiculous hits I get when playing killer? I agree that latency is part of the problem, but it is not the only problem.
---
I am talking about this specific scenario with huntress. Don't know which hits you are referring to but there are some situations where hitboxes are actually at fault. Not in 99% of the situations people complain tho.
---
Wrinkles been around Florida longer than coughy clown dlc
---
love to see it .. gj mate
---
Pips correlate to emblem scores, not bloodpoints. When you get bullied by a SWF but still end up with a lot of bloodpoints (~27k), it can still be entity displeased
---
"They hated him because he told them the truth"
---
what? what ptb patch notes? what the fuck are you on about?
---
Hearing Trapper step in his own trap. It’s funny every time.
---
That works against bad nurses, if you go against a good one you're dead, just dead.
---
Enduring. I need it desperately for my Legion.
---
Survivors have more to be toxic with and can do it with 4 people.  Killers still can but need very specific killers, maps, and builds to do it.
---
He honestly seems to not mind being hooked when he yells, its odd
---
Insecurity?
---
Demogorgon, have a Snicker's Bar, you're not you when you're hungry.
---
But mindgames are a basic part of chases. Is the killer going to backpedal as you go around this t-wall or are they going to commit? Is the survivor going to take the vault or fake it? Is the killer going to respect the pallet, swing through or run through? This is without getting into the finer details of each killers power.
---
I understand that Spirit can push this over the edge and can leverage these guesses in her favour more than most, but I don't understand the indignation some people have regarding her as if guesswork isn't a fundamental part of chase mechanics. Yeah, you can use meta-level information about what the killer has done previously in regards to backpedalling, faking, red stain manipulation etc, but you can use the exact same methods against a Spirit's mindgames. 
---
The real issue imo is that winning these guessing games as a survivor vs Spirit is unrewarding because her power charges back so quickly. If you make the right read it doesn't buy you much time at all.
---
"i forgot the entire sub is a circle jerk between all players of the game"
---
What did you mean by this?
---
Keep that same energy when you’re getting face camped lol
---
A Bill and Nea duo weren’t even doing Gens in the game I was playing. One brought an InstaHeal, the other brought a Sabo Kit/Perk.
---
After downing them probably a total of 9 times (Kept dropping them since there were no hooks) I just downed them both and left them there to bleed out. They died pretty early on in the game, and I just farmed with the other 2.
---
They waited the entire 30 minute match in spectate just to flame me/harass me in post-Chat.
---
So few understand this simple thread of logic.
---
Why y'all downvoting this man WeirdChamp crying abouy reposts without OP knowing.
---
Additional comment because I'm a 4head who doesn't know how to embed images in text posts:  
---
If BHVR were to add some kind of stat tracker, it would be nice if it was seperated into an account tracker and a character tracker, stats like hours, disconnects, and blood points gained would shown on account. And things like average emblem score, average rank, and the stats depicted in the info screen would be shown for each individual character.
---
Apologies Lord Dwight, your chariot is stationed at the front of the Autohaven for your weekly locker viewing.
---
They can both be looped consistently. Both require different strategies as both have strengths and weaknesses.
---
Thankfully, it seems like they're finally fixing his face..
---
weird. youd think theyre basically the same thing. rewarded bloodpoints for playing good, rewarded rank for playing good.
---
Dont go higher man, its way funnier down in the green ranks.
---
Only for spirit. I just find nurse more fun (not the sweaty god nurses) then a spirit.  Both require different play styles to other killers, but spirit is just really annoying to go against
---
My nurse is nearly maxed out and I’m still waiting for BBQ
---
makes no sense to me how playing good for rank and playing good for bp is different. youd think they are the same thing. rewarded both when you play well
---
Boy OP is gonna be pissed lol
---
&gt;I 100% agree with you, I really do. I guess just personal statistics would be nice to have but people would still want to compare them. Then there’s still a problem with DC’ing/Deranking/Lobby dodging...
---
I like OP's idea for stats. Bloodpoints spent, matches played. Stuff that doesn't mean much if you start comparing to other players.
---
I don't know about kills and emblems tho, it could lead to the thing you just mentioned.
---
Cause spirit isn’t fun to face? I’d rather die to a god nurse and move on to the next game then fight a spirit ngl
---
As a Legion main, I LOVE THIS 😍😍😍
---
As a survivor..I would still love it but be terrified at the same time 😂😂😂😍
---
Be proud fellow Jeff main! Not everyone is worthy to play him anyway!
---
I’m not too worried about Demogorgon camping, especially since the current way the portals are used involves placing one near a survivor when they’re hooked and then using said portal to travel to another one. Since this gives quite a bit of time for survivors to unhook their friend and rush off, I don’t think Demogorgon camping will be as effective or used as much. I could maybe see that kind of camping happening if a Demogorgon place two portals very close to one another, but in that case a Demogorgon ends up wasting two of it’s 7 portals on one person. The Demogorgon is more map pressure and making survivors question whether that portal near the gen their working on is gonna have the Demogorgon popping out of it in the next second or so, likely reducing the amount of gen rushes.
---
All the perks are very interesting. for the demogorgon I feel his shred is good but massively overrated as you can easily just move left or right as they have no control after starting the lunge, i feel the hitbox is a little too big and forgiving though, maybe shrink it just a tiny bit because when I'm watching people play him they get hits that shouldn't even have landed besides that the demogorgon is mid tier in my opinion so far.  Over all the dlc looks great
---
&gt; Michael Mayonnaise
---
Was this intentional or a typo?
---
Definitely - they really marketed this thing extremely well, I've just also been noticing since all this Stranger Things talk that whatever mistakes BHVR's made with the game, their marketing department is definitely always ahead of the curve whenever licensed content drops
---
Those are the best! 🔪
---
Here my change to noed. No one escape death
---
When all generator are complete this perk activate. You gain 2% more movement speed and 20% reduce successful hit recovery and 25% reduce unsuccessful hit recovery.
---
Ragequitting is not reportable, you are just creating unnecessary extra work for the support team. Just spreading awareness. The system that will eventually punish these people, is automated.

People here are so sensitive. Get fucked and git gud
---
K, few things.
---
I don’t use NOED.
---
NOED is a perk you can counter before it EVEN comes into play.
---
Let me just repeat that:
---
Before. It even. Comes into play.
---
Most of the game it does nothing, and it only punishes survivors if they rushed gens without cleansing totems, which by the way, is not some monumental laborious time consuming task, and didn’t avoid the killer while escaping. Just cleanse the totems. They even buffed the amount of bloodpoints for cleansing. Its free points and meta tryhards still complain because you “wasted” a few seconds getting rid of some shittily hidden totem you can spot walking to the next gen.
---
“But the killer didn’t DESERVE that kill!” Yes, they did. They chased someone down while the totem was active and got a hit. This is while literally at least one survivor is free to aid in your chase and help you to the gate. Saying a killer “didn’t deserve a kill” is just entitled survivor main pissing and moaning because the killer didn’t play by their imaginary rulebook.
---
NOED 100% does not need any sort of change.
---
I might be an "entitled killer main" but agree with you. The strongest of the two sides is strangely enough the survivors who are trapped in the realm of an evil being who feeds on suffering so obviously the killers should be stronger and more unbeatable then they are in terms of the lore
---
Mom?

Until purple ranks let them quit lol they are new they are just giving up

My brother and I have been calling him that since we were young lol.

---
Gotcha, lol.
---
Apart from the, you know, mandatory "giv x shirtless skin pls" comment.
---
I would really like a cosmetic set where he has a backpack, black jeans, a blue unzipped hoodie with just a generic white top. 
---
I say generic because I don't know if BHVR can get Joy Division t-shirts in their game.
---
Agreed. The Shred attack can be a bit overrated at times, but it’s usefulness in a wide array of situations can’t be completely ignored. That one survivor that just likes to run in loops or vault the same pallet can be tricked into believing you’re planning to use Shred, only for you to stop using it and get a hit in. Despite that, I can definitely agree on the Demogorgon likely being mid-tier, maybe a little bit above that. His power does apply both map pressures and aids in chases at certain points, which gives him a solid mid-high tier rating imo.
---
But adrenaline doesn't reward failing your job
---
Don’t know, I’m on Console and we were Banished along time ago... 
---
It looks cool via YouTube vids!
---
Again i'm not expert of this killer but from what i understand if u put a portal on top of basement, you have plenty of time to place a new portal and teleport to that one as soon as you see it light yellow
---
I only recently got access to ruin because of the shrine of secrets (thank God because I did not want to put blood points into a killer I don't like to play as) so now I just need to get it on my piggy girl and demogorgon when he comes out on console because, I WANT
---
Yes, it's a teachable perk. Every survivor and killer has their own 3 teachable perks which you unlock at lvl 30,35 and 40
---
dude it’s crazy how offended people get when you try to explain to them that’s the purpose of the PTB
---
Weird, I’ve had that happen to me as well
---
I misread. My bad.
---
Same. The dreaded PC master race has forsaken us from the beauty of PTB’s. But I can say I’m definitely hyped for the release.
---
If that's the case I would send a support ticket.
---
Im pretty excited for Ghostface tbh. As a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan I can say bravo BHVR. They nailed Myers look and even made him lore-friendly. I hope Ghostface has a cool power though.
---
Apologies Lord Dwight, I did not notice the fifteen crows perching on your locker while parking, I shall take note of this for next time I assure you.
---
Oh my word, finally someone else See's it!
---
It really isn’t though
---
I'm not sure honestly. It would be a part of license which is separate from the likeness of the actor. 
---
I'm pretty sure the Nightmare on Elm Street reboot license is pretty inactive but I could be wrong.
---
I think he should be able to peek *over* things and stalk rather than just *around* things. It also should be easier to reveal him when he's in peek mode than it is
---
Don’t be a bitch and die like a survivor?
---
Needs buff more like it, wraith has better map pressure like damn... and pig has better loop counter like damn
---
Imagine being so entitled that you feel the need to say the devs have forgotten the game during the middle of a huge updates release just because they're not addressing a problem the way you want then to.
---
Nice

I agree looping is the viable strat to do for survivors, but truly believe the problem really is worse when SWF gets involved. Looping out of nowhere seems a lot worse when everyone else knows they’re safe and can focus on gens while coordinating group saves later on.
---
Did this to a Steve the other day. I felt pretty bad, so I gave my own life so he could get out and I apologised in post-game chat.
---
And yet I still feel bad.
---
Noel gives killers a movement speed boost and they can deal two states of damage 
---
Adrenaline gives survivors a movement speed boost and heals a state 
---
Granted the killer version is permanent until cleansed while survivor is a momentary thing.
---
Like I dislike noed too but it’s straight up the survivor version
---
Awesome work!
---
I recently had one of the two last survivors play a jungle gym, so I started spamming the pigs charge so he'd know I didn't mean to kill him and we played that area until their teammate opened the door and left, and then we looked for hatch
---
I understand why you'd dislike a really good looper when using a trapper or something like that, but actually having a fair "duel" is fun as hell
---
the connection between BP and pips is only very mild. This looks totally fair
---
Mainly Faber Castell fineliners. The grey brushes are also Faber Castell; I bought them in like a five pack, with different shades of grey
---
Thats what i walk talking about, they're called corpse flowers
---
I would have done the same but she died on hook so rip
---
I think Hag has far greater potential for camping but so does any Killer to be honest. Agreed on the perks.
---
This is why I always early juke against her, I never trust the ping
---
I'm not sure how the video shows the survivor was bad.  It does demonstrate how latency and hitboxes allow for hits that do not look like they should land and also addresses issues with dead-hard and how it procs.  However, it appears you have a lot of pent up frustration.  Perhaps find a safe place to vent this or exercise, it will help relax you and maybe you can engage in a discussion of game mechanics rather than telling people to "get fucked" and call other people cry babies when you go on a long, incredibly emotional rant.  Toughts and prayers for ya my dude.
---
Can't wait to see Matt Murdock kick the entity's ass
---
The perks are more than the perks itselves. Under what condition do they proc? Survivor only when you did the objective well which isn’t evey game. Noed procs when you did poorly and when all totems get cleansed, you should’ve killed everyone within 5 gens. Besides, the noed speed boost would be more like Hope, Adrenaline’s boost is a longer sprint burst (only matters while in chase)
---
Stats would be a really great addition to the game. Personally, I'm a geek about numbers like that and I know a bunch of other people are too.
---
It’s an elbow.
---
Lol you straight up sacrificed her

My favorite thing to do with scratched mirror is watch where a survivor is running then get on a corner in their path and jumpscare them as they get close
---
You don't realize a lot of thing evidently because you jumped up with your chest out ready to defend your tribe. WihZeh and I were talking about the original change the dev were going to go with but they decided against it because killers were bitching MoM was still too strong even with safe unhooks. Please read threads completely before you emote yourself

* *Description:* On Mother's Dwelling, cannot escape after opening the exit gates; player just walks outside of the map rather than triggering the escape animation. Going to the other gate on other side of map will give the same result and can only escape by finding the hatch. 
---
This happens quite often and is obviously not related to my personal specs, and have no clue what causes this.
---
yeah I get that but with "unlimited" traps you can use them more efficiently, for example near doors in endgame.
---

---
Umm ghostface came out a couple months ago? What? This dlc has the demogorgan as a killer.
---
You laugh? You got some kind of disability or something? 
---
People on this game are so dumb lol, survivors especially but i wonder if that has anything to do with the game being extremely easy as a survivor and the only objective being to hold one button for prolonged periods of time. 
---
Love this game but the survivor side of the game honestly needs to be re worked, if it was actually challenging and more importantly fun i think the game would be way less toxic

 yeah.. this aint it chief
---
Gen rush is just a term created by salty killers who suck donkey dong at the game. The single objective for the survivor is fix generators.
---
Unless you're nurse
---
We got back bling now?
---
I watch him and he tunnels sometimes because otherwise he wouldn't win. You should play killer yourself and try it out instead of basing your oponion on streamers
---
I couldn't care less as long as that guy's dead
---
Lol, I main Wraith and Myers, and I would consider my gameplay very survivor friendly, I never camp or tunnel, but I get my jollies from scaring the shit out of people. With M&amp;A even Tier 2 Myers is a sneaky bastard.
---
BL and BT
---
Every commenter forgot about Huntress even OP.
---
But then the portals would be useless if you can't ever teleport to or from any
---
I’m 2 days late to this thread but I had to point out, your username literally says your a survivor main, of course you wouldn’t like somebody talking about being a killer main lol
---
I like to think that is Frank being carried by Joey.
---
BBQ always takes forever to spawn in my bloodweb for Billy
---
Given the fact that Inner Strength is all but guaranteed to be a meta perk, I think noed will probably disappear from most builds pretty quickly, the chances of it actually activating at endgame are slim to none once the new chapter goes live
---
Leatherface leans forward.  His head is now inside the survivor.
---
Well if you ever have to disengage while playing nurse, it might be time to try someone other than nurse.
---
There's one upstairs in a room with only one entrance. It's in between a desk and a wall. If you're on the wrong side of the pallet after it's been dropped, then you're absolutely fucked. 
---
Monto points it out in one of his most recent vids.
---
Here are 3 ways I think they could change NOED.
---
-For each survivor you chase that gets away you gain a token, if NOED has 4 tokens when the Exit Doors are powered NOED activates.
---
-The Dull Totem for NOED now lights when there is only 1 generator left to repair. NOED still doesn’t activate until that generator is completed.
---
-Once the Exit Gates are powered NOED activates for 30/45/60 seconds, each time you hook a survivor the timer resets.  (This would prevent the NOED killer from slugging a team in the end and survivors could attempt to hide from the killer and wait for NOED to wear off before trying to open the exit door.)
---
I don’t think NOED needs a rework it is a saving grace perk same as Adrenaline.  You chose to not have an active perk for most of the match to try and secure a last second save and earn something back.  It is a powerful perk for sure but that is why it doesn’t active until the end and can still be disarmed. If I had to pick I like my 3rd idea best.
---
We're too used to BHVR putting weird and unnecessary cooldown or once-per-match restrictions on perks.
---
Jane sex noises?
---
Here's the argument. As a killer main and survivor player, the killer really has 0 say in how fast gens are done. Sure, corrupt, ruin, and pop are all gen slow/regression perks but as we both know, gens are done as quickly as survivors want. Not the other way around.
---
NOED while a crutch is like pre-nerf decisive. A second chance. I just say it's like adrenaline at this point because thematically they both have very similar effects. Both effect health and speed, and only proc after the gates are powered.
---
Nurse is stupidly easy to play, honestly. Which sucks, as she's undoubtedly the best killer; a spot in games traditionally reserved for characters that are hard to master, such as Bunny Mama. I can understand Nurse being mildly difficult if DBD is your first game ever, but the skill and time investment required to play her at a high level are vastly overrated/exaggerated. I think people who say Nurse is difficult just want to feel better about roflstomping with an easy killer, but that's just my 2 cents.
---
Source: I play Nurse with no addons. No 4k feels like an accomplishment or grand display of skill. Crossmap or needle-threading prediction hatchets with Huntress on the other hand...
---
you're a fucking neckbeard loser
---
&gt;  because killers were bitching MoM was still too strong even with safe unhooks
---
no that never happened. devs decided against it because they thought it could encourage farming (unsafely unhooking survivors in front of the killer is still farming even with BT)
---
For further information, please read our subreddit rules. If you want to discuss the removal feel free to contact us.
---
No, there aren't. There are add-ons that decrease the cooldown before you can Feral Frenzy again, but nothing that negates the stun of it.
---
Demogorgon is fuckin C tier at best his lunge is easy as fuck to dodge if you just look behind you... so he has no counter to loops.... the mother fucker has to stand one portal to teleport wasting so much time.... takes survivors a solid 6 seconds to destroy them and honestly I'm so disappointed that behavr would rather make more BAD killers, than fix the bad ones they already have... I'm talking trapper, wraith, clown, pig, legion, bubba... the borderline free wins for survivors with the exception being a really good trapper who gets lucky and spawns with a 3 or 4 gen... and a pig on the 2 maps shes viable on, the game, and let's. And even then it needs to be a fuckin good pig.
---
Plz stop with the new shitty killers to balance, and fix the problems you already have... plz get some skilled players to test your shit... we all know the devs are legit fucking garbage at their own game... I don't care, but your opinion as a group of people who hide in lockers, dont loop and pre-drop pallets,  cant mindgame, and spend time crouching around instead of rushing the gens.... we dont want your balance opinion we want the balance opinion of people who see the max potential of games at high lvl play.
---
I’m not arguing that noed is a reward or anything like that. I’d be down to have it removed so it doesn’t clutter up my blood web. 
---
Just simply stating that those are two sides of the same coin with altering health states and movement speed.
---
But your point about hope is pretty good and accurate. It’s just that adrenaline has the heal so it always synced up more to me
---
As if the community of this game isnt already a cesspool, lets be honest...
---
Invisible man confirmed next killer
---
\*runs a little bit away and hide inside another locker\* "I can do this all day, spooky boi."
---
I find Jane played a lot more than Laurie, and I would put Quentin in the d tier. I do get a few.
---
Freddy may be good now but he remembers what it was like down there.... Pepperidge farm also remembers
---
True. I feel like the new map, the Underground Complex, plays both to the Demogorgons strengths and his weaknesses. Some areas are tight enough to make his Shred ability difficult to hit, but other more linear and open areas make the Shred useful. In the end, I suppose the usefulness and skill of those who play the Demogorgon as well as the map will play into how the Demogorgon is ranked among the list of killers. I can probably visualize the Demogorgon having only a little trouble on the ever-despised by killers map that is the god old Memorial Institute, as the Shred would be semi-good for all the windows there, so I may end up liking him a lot in that regard. More open maps like Coldwind or the Crotus Prenn Asylum may also be somewhat good with the Shred ability, at least in my eyes as a killer main.
---
It was never confirmed
---
Really cool stuff!
---
The "rumor" I had originally heard was it was from the 3rd to the 5th. However, I'm just going to assume it will drop either right before, or during the next Chapter release when it happens.
---
Borrowed, ds, kindred, adrenaline
---
New map is going to be soo fun with Peekaboo Myers
---
It was confirmed, unfortunately, by Dave Richard that Joe Keery and Natalia Dyer weren't gonna voice the characters.
---
You can't waste MoM, though.
---
Well, like three Killers could, but if you were playing anyone other than them, good luck. **That's** why MoM was nerfed into the ground; it's not because it was too good, it's not because it was too strong of a perk for Survivors, it's because it countered 80% of the Killer Roster before you even got into the match.
---
As a Wraith, I could counter DS by not picking up someone right after the hook. I could counter BT by not standing next to the hook (or turning invis). I could counter Dead Hard by not swinging until it was used. There was nothing you could do to counter MoM.
---
NoED doesn't reward a bad killer. NoED punishes survivors who don't cleanse bones.
---
:((((
---
Ty
---
Yeah, I saw it. His was one of the few poor spawns I saw. Go watch some of the games GibsAndPieces played - they had incredibly strong pallet spawns

Chase him, force him to drop a couple of pallets, then leave him alone and go find someone else.

I don’t know why so many Killers think that losing a chase=bad

I'm fine with seeing black&amp;white game or just everything black with white contour. Like SCP-939 in SCP-Secret Lab game. Survivors will be outlined aswell, though. It would be pain to play, but it would be cool.

Likewise. Had a game vs a Trapper where he didn't find me until I was on a door. All of my teammates kept stepping in his traps and I was the only one to leave the game never getting injured.

There's also more ways that a survivor can be toxic

---
YEAH! SHE SHOULD WALTZ AWAY AND LET YOU FINISH THEM! FUCKING TOXIC KILLERS, NOT LETTING SURVIVORS WIN &gt;:(
---
Easy to dodge and you call it fine?.... dude... demo needs a huge buff to his teleport, make it so he can teleport on spot without going to stand on another one... demo needs a buff to his lunge... it needs to have some curvature to it, if it doesnt than hes a useless killer with no loop counter therefore he just sits in C Tier with the other dog shit killers behavrs dumb ass released and never fixed...
---
The devs are shit players, I've watched their streams and the vast majority are dog shit at the game... this is fine... but I dont want their opinion on balance to be considered cause their balance opinion made-wraith, bubba, trapper, pig, clown, and legion rework....
---
I dont want it... in fact they were so bad at the game they released nurse and her 5 blink add ons because they are shitty players and the dev testing nurse sucked doo doo... so they released it thinking it was ALOT weaker than it actually is... cause they didnt see a good nurse playing with max potential.

It doesn’t even sound like he’s that troubled by it honestly
---
The guy was downvoted into oblivion so not sure it’s a great example, it doesn’t seem to be a popular opinion. 
---
Well, yeah, exactly. People will whine about anything in this game. There are people who think that Leatherface is OP. One or two people thinking something is overpowered doesn’t warrant multiple PSA posts, and if people want to do it they should post it in the PTB feedback on the official forums.
---

He gets stunned from flashlight clicking sounds. When you have to toxic to stun the killer
---
Will bloodWebs be bigger? Meaning the amount of points needed to get all the perks will remain the same. Or will the webs be the same size just happen to have 4 perks on them

Yea but that's a ultra rare add-on meaning it's kinda scarce unless you're lucky or save alot of them

I really like the noises that Spirit makes. It’s my favorite part about her.

---
"it only punishes survivors if they rushed gens without cleansing totems"
---
Im a really aggressive killer, so I'm gonna try my best to not give you time to do anything. And if you decide to cleanse totems rather than doing gens, that's even better for me.....see where I'm going with this? 
---
"It's not a monumental laborious time consuming task"
---
Actually during really intense matches, EVERY second counts especially if it's a killer that has great map control. 
---
"just entitled survivor main pissing and moaning because the killer didn’t play by their imaginary rule book"
---
I'm not an entitled survivor main, nor am I trying to come off as complaining and whining. I was simply saying that I understand those who rely on noed AND those hate it. They both have valid reasons to feel the way they feel. If a killer gets absolutely destroyed, they may feel like noed is their only hope. Likewise that survivor who put in so much work, but gets unlucky due to noed, is also understandable. Those who throw around the phrase "entitled survivor main" are usually just the exact counterpart. So now I have to ask, are you just an entitled killer main?
---

---
Killers can ruin a survivors game with little or no effort.
---
Survivors bullying a killer requires effort and multiple players. 
---
It is much easier for a killer to be toxic.
---
I'll try to explain why Spirit is a necessary killer for the game. The key is non-mindgameable loops and pallets. Let's assume we have the best killer player and best survivor player. So if someone is looping a jungle gym, or around a pallet which has to be broken otherwise you will never reach the survivor, then who do you think will be the power role in this scenario? If a survivor is looping killer shack for example, let's assume he is doing it perfectly (no mess up), then will any killer other than Spirit and Nurse will be able to get him without destroying the pallet? Maybe huntress and hag can come close, but huntress can be dodged and if you see hag putting trap then you can just move onto the next loop. My point is that nearly all the killers have no way of outplaying a survivor, all they can do is capitalise on their mess up. Which in my opinion is not a good design. Although this is completely okay for any ranks other than red ranks, since there are no perfect survivors in low-mid tier ranks. These are the reasons why I think spirit is a necessity. She is in control in every loop if she plays perfectly, this allows the red rank killers some relief, and for low to mid tier players she is fine as well since she isn't that easy to play, you end up messing up a lot and then you have to wait for cooldown.
---
ah yes this is very fine for 90 ping.
---
Leatherface is so good for this 
---
Sure I get looped for half the game but once you Catch the weak one and hook him it’s chainsaw city baby
---
awww, thanks &lt;3
---
premature completion can be a bit disappointing
---
This is so cute 🥺
---
There are 4 survivors per killer, so of course more seem toxic since you see 4 times as many!
---
&gt;Rage quitting is reportable it’s literally described in the reporting form.
---
The reporting form is outdated. The links I provided are far more recent.
---
Iron Will, Bond, any exhaustion perk (for new players, Lithe is the best option), Windows of Opportunity, Decesive Strike, Unbreakable, Quick and Quiet
---
1. PC if you have the option. PC has shorter queue times, better frame rate, and the Huntress along with the Nurse are a lot more fun to play on PC
---
2. Nothing wrong starting off with DLC. Meyers is a lot of fun. You may struggle with more complicated killers but just see how it goes. You'll want Meyer eventually so might as well try him out right away. I got the Leatherface DLC first and BBQ&amp;Chili is a staple in pretty much every killers perk loadout. Unfortunately the killer himself kind of sucks though.

3. Yes, playing as the other side will give you a huge depth of understanding, you don't need to do it a lot but definitely plan on playing some survivor if you want to truly get good at Killer
---
I was so excited to play Ash and then I found out that he gets targeted hardcore by all killers. 😭
---
I don’t you tell me, it’s called get another one
---
Thanks! It's the official mask, bhvr sold it on their website!
---
This my gf ranks so much faster then me and I realized it’s cause I’m playing bait 3/4 of the match and she’s just plucking away at gens
---
Still harder to play as than the average killer, I don't see people going "lmao Michael takes no skill just look at the survivors"
---
&gt; gens are done as quickly as survivors want. Not the other way around.
---
I was gonna say I wasn't sure if this is true, but then I remembered the "gens before friends" meta lol
---
yes. if you don't go into a blind rage over a video game, he doesn't feel as good about himself and therefore loses. so don't be dumb, be mad
---
I hope your day gets better!
---
Hexy is literally a facecamper, its too hard to see him not camping. He looks for a reason to camp everytime he plays the game; oh they did 2 gens before i managed to down the survivor i was chasing lets basement camp him
---
I play PS4. Whatever you are more comfortable with and what you think is more fun. I would play a few days to make sure you really like the game before you but the Dlc. Also PS4 comes with more characters!
---
What does ranking mean anyway, as long as there is no reason for wanting to actually rank up I don't care about my rank
---
If you're looking at playing killer, PC is probably the way to go because not only will your performance be better but you can also meet some nice people and stuff and actually talk after games. 
---
There is not really a reason to dive into the originals before the DLC unless you really want a specific teachable from one of the originals. 
---
It is not imperative to do that but it will help a lot because if you learn both sides you can see where survivors will loop as killer and then where you should loop because of what the killer is likely to do
---
My biggest tip for a new player would be to watch some rank 1s on YouTube. My personal favorites are Monto, FunGoose, Puppers, and Noob3.
---
Have a blast!
---
I play on PC and if your framerate is getting low, you can just swap out a graphics card.
---
nurse is totally free as well as huntress, Though they are some of the hardest killers you can play as.
---
I play both surv and killer even tho I love killers more than survivors. Playing surv gives you access to their mindset  and thus grants you more knowledge about what survivors will do in certain situations so you can predict their movements etc... 
---
Biggest piece of advice: don't DC and just keep persisting until you git gud
---
&gt; actually do cleanse totems I see Killers running to forums screaming totems needs to be hid better because they all get broken before endgame
---
People are talking about their hex spawns, not the general spawns of dull totems and you know that perfectly well.
---
It was I have a screenshot of when I first saw it
---
That’s happened to me before, I screamed
---
Yes, for two openings. Which will need to be replaced. Much longer than laying a trap. I mean you can play it right now on the PTB, if you disagree.
---
People say map wide would be op, but yet where it is rn it's kind of worthless, even 32 meters it just seems too niche with little effect. Wheres the middle ground?
---
This is a rant not a discussion
---
I personally play on ps4 and I’ve never experienced the frame rate issue. I have a PC but prefer console because It feels slightly more casual. Both are great obviously and PC gets to play the PTB so that could be an important thing to you. When it comes to DLC, I’d say maybe try out some of the free killers first but the Halloween DLC is great just because Michael is so much fun and well balanced imo. Playing survivor isn’t necessary to be a good killer but obviously it helps a lot. When I first got the game, I considered myself a “killer main” but both are super fun and I actually prefer survivor now. If you have friends that play then survivor can be much more fun even tho everyone hates on SWF.
---
It's more of a question but nice answer
---
1. I'd recommend PC. You're going to be getting higher quality games especially as Killer because Killer is a bit of a rough experience on console. PC gets access to Player Test Builds and a just smoother experience. 
---
2. Play whatever character you find interesting! The base characters are cool but I've found all the DLC to be worthwhile purchases. The Leatherface DLC is on the less expensive side since it's only one character and you get a lot of bang for your buck out of BBQ &amp; Chili. 
---
3. This point ties in to the advice you want as well. I'd say you should definitely play both sides because that understanding will take your play on either side to the next level!
---
Overall I would highly recommend this game in its entirety and I'm glad you're deciding to give it a go!
---
I made it! It’s in the 3rd Stranger things DLC video.
---
Is he even able to have preferences?
---
I changed when Jane came out
---
1. PC, if it's more powerful than PS4.
---
2. On PC you'll get both Nurse and Huntress with base game (you'll have to buy Myers ). Trapper is good to understand basics of M1 (basic attack) killer, but honestly, if you want to play Nurse and Huntress only, you can skip that imo. Leatherface DLC is essential (for BBQ). Other than that you don't need to buy DLC to get a very strong build for those 2 killers.
---
3. Yes, playing both sides makes you better player for both roles. Still, it's not mandatory
---
Advices: play for fun. Forget about ranks, kills, etc. Don't think everyone's out there to bully or BM you. Focus on your game, on improving your skills. And don't be an asshole to others.
---
No it's not, what do you think that the police are going to crash into your room and arrest if you don't respect a Kobe?
---
Why does no one mention they lock their solutions perks behind fucking paywalls. The fixes to a games issues should not have to be paid for.
---
the absolute shirtless mad lad
---
Same size, just 4 perks instead. The Entity will likely take the perks first which means that you’ll have to grab the 2 you want straight away.
---
It just looks like a bird cage lol
---
Saw this happen on a stream recently, got a good laugh out of everyone
---
/ruselessnobody
---
You don't have to play into either side's expectations for anything. Play how you want.
---
I sent you a message with the link!

Next Game: *Hears Nurse screech in the distance*
---
If they nerf this killer, the devs are proper fools
---
HybridPanda does a great job showcasing killers and survivors as well as various builds. He’s very entertaining and at least in my opinion, seems like a real chill and down to earth kind of guy I’d wanna be friends with. His ShrineWatch series is great for seeing perks in action if you’re not familiar but as a veteran player, I still greatly enjoy his content.
---
Ohmwrecker is another fun and exciting guy to watch and he has a bit of a contagious energy to him. I do enjoy Noob3 and Farmer John as well for some good laughs, especially as someone who plays more survivor than killer.
---
Is that Persona?
---
Hi! Glad to see a newcomer! I’m reasonably new myself (just a few months in)  so not sure if m answers will help you entirely but here they are:
---
1 - I play PC, had the same conflict but decided it’d be better due to access to the PTB, somewhat larger player base and controls (though this is personal preference, as you can configure a controller on pc too) 
---
2 - I played trapper a couple of times to get used to the killer mechanics, however since each killer is fairly unique, I picked one I liked and played around. I’d say play some original and, if you like it, branch into the DLC ones. I would suggest Leatherface for BBQ, since it was just on the shrine it might not be back for a while, Hag and clown provide good generator delaying perks, and Plague has some useful ones too.
---
3 - Its not necessarily imperative to play survivor in order to play killer better, however some people (myself included) play both to see both sides, become aware of loops and map awareness both from the first and third person; it’s all down to personal preference really, so I’d suggest give both a try and stick with what you like, be it killer, survivor or a mix!
---
The biggest piece of advice I could give you is have fun with it! Watch some streamers/Youtubers to learn about the killer(s) you’re most interested in and how to mindgame etc. 
---
Hope this helped somehow! :)
---
Well then I guess they should update their reporting form
---
I ,along with you two fine gentlemen, enjoy this quality meme.
---
PC is much better
---
&gt; is it better to stick with the original killers before diving into the DLC killers?
---
Not necessarily, no
---
&gt; which DLC do you buy first?
---
leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili
---
&gt; Is it imperative to play as a survivor in order to better understand playing as a killer?
---
most people think yes. I don't think so.
---
&gt; what is the biggest piece of advice you’d give to someone just starting out with the game?
---
* be patient. it takes a long time to really get the game and the grind is rough.
---
* the game is what you make of it. it can be tilting, but if you keep the right mindset it's not so frustrating
---
True r/dbd starterpack: "everyone is a rank 20 except me"
---
&gt;Prayer beed
---
Lmao
---
And here my name is *tombstone myers plz,* yet I can't get a single one.
---
"However, I'll pretend to take the high road."
---
Kill your self, phaggot.
---
also on top of that: even if there somehow an even number of toxic survivors and killers...you meet 4 survivors per a game as killer, and only 1 killer per a game as survivor. You have 4 times the chance to meet a toxic survivor.
---
I play mostly ash and you are correct lol
---
But usually once you go downed and get unhooked there is s good chance that you will get tunnel without doing any gens, escaping chases etc and will probably de-pip.
---
Yep
---
If It becomes clear it will take a while to catch them I just leave. Unless they teabag after dropping a pallet. If they do that they are asking to be tunneled
---
Groovy
---
Your numbers are optimal bull shit. The real world doesn't have that kind of optimization. When in game, those numbers don't do shit to help gf. In other words, you're banking on a lot of if's and ignoring empirical data, which is making the discussion difficult.
---
Pre stalk all you want, it still doesn't guarantee a mark, let alone a down, especially with a 4 man swf. You can say it's a favorable set up based on RAW, but in practice, that almost completely goes out the window.
---
Probably
---
Had the same thing yesterday. I found a generator that was almost done. Untill I started working on it. It went down to like 10% done.
---
demmogrion
---
Unless you're teammates do NOTHING omfg 1 rank reset and I can't get back to red rank solo
---
Survivors just want a sandbox game where they complete gens while a big scary person hits them with pool noodles while they slam pallets on their heads.
---
I highly recommend Demi, Otzdarva, and PainReliever. They're my favorites off the top of my head.
---
Mount weird jungle gyms that I dont understand and dont know how to run
---
Seriously how long has this map been put I still feel like I'm going into a maze when I go into those jungle gyms
---
From what I've heard, its more about the amount of pallets and good loops (like, really good) on the Hawkins map. I played on it and there was this one room that was a pain in my ass, it had 3 pallets and 1 vault point with no drop off or mindgame potential. Im pretty sure if you jave balanced landing you could run the killer around for a pretty long time... other than that I don't really see anything bad about the perks, just give it some time to develop and see how or if it changes the meta
---
Meant to say EVEN when you did poorly. Urban evaders don’t do gens, I also two hook most of the time, if they do all 5 totems before getting the gens and you still don’t have at least 2 kills at the end you probably did something severely wrong.
---
Also, WHEEEE indeed. Just what really matters is if the instaheal affects the killer (which would be in chase)
---
Congrats! You're down the rabbit hole now, there's no turning back....well until rank reset anyway.
---
I still think the community clown skin shouldn’t have won 🤷‍♂️
---
Truth. The killer is pretty good, but could become pretty bad if they nerf it’s power in some grandiose way. I feel like the Demogorgon is fine as he is. All I could see maybe getting some tweaks are the perks, but even then I feel they’re quite balanced.
---
3. Play survivor! It will give you a wealth of perspective on how survivors navigate maps, what decisions they make in chases, where they usually hide, and how they're keeping track of YOU. Very strongly recommend to help your Killer game, but also, it's great fun in a different way.
---
Biggest advice: Dead by Daylight has an unforgivingly steep learning curve at first. Small mistakes are incredibly costly; the game rewards doing a few things well rather than throwing shit at the wall. Just be patient and focus on small victories and before you know it you'll be having insanely tight games!
---
Also, play WHATEVER Killer character you want in whatever order. The basics might all be the same for each Killer, but their abilities will be different anyway, so you may as well start with who you actually just plain like
---
Traps also can be countered 5 times easier then portals can
---
Yeah his jump is pretty scary
---
No you’re not. You shouldn’t be chasing a looper you know is good for 2-3 gens. Good killers can tell about how good a player is very quickly. Did they rotate away from you? Are they not falling for mindgames? Do they run you around the pallet instead of dropping it ASAP?
---
I’ve had killers (I’m one of them) who chase me for around 15 seconds, learn that I know what I’m doing and choose to rotate away. Then they instantly catch one of my teammates who was doing a gen or fucking around. Instead of tunneling me he’s just a got an early hook, learned who’s a weak link and who’s a strong link. Anybody can hold M1 until a gen is done, it’s up to the killer to take advantage people who can’t loop, hook them, and force the good loopers to constantly be altruistic instead of doing gens
---
I love watching Paulie Esther. He is just so wholesome and nice. My favorite content creator for the game.
---
I agree. Tunnel and facecamp all teabaggers
---
Its called Demogorgon
---
I already have. I've tried everything except for deleting my progress and just having it restored.
---
Right now I’d say this chapter is probably the best chapter they’ve ever done and I’m hoping they don’t ruin it

As a survivor once stated "PIG op plz nerf"
---
&gt; I also two hook most of the time, if they do all 5 totems before getting the gens and you still don’t have at least 2 kills at the end you probably did something severely wrong.
---
I don't run NOED so I don't have a frame of reference for something like this. I'm just addressing this idea that gens getting done means you did poorly

This subreddit has absolutely no idea what they're talking about, they dont even know what a hitbox is, they think because they got hit from far away the survivor hitbox MUST be huge, it's not, it's called ping. You can easily prove this ingame.
---
Well, there are more toxic survivors than killers, cause y'know 4 on 1. But I'd say Killers can be more toxic, cause if your getting teabagged and flashlight spammed it's not keeping you from playing, but if you're getting tunnled and camped you're not able to play.
---
I teabag killers during Chases sometimes to taunt them into not giving up on it. Gens get done and I get face camped but it's worth it knowing my mates escaped. Gotta be the sacrifice. But doing it at every drop is excessive
---
I'm not asking for support you dumb bot!
---
He spelled it like that cause he was getting shredded and didn’t have time to spell it
---
You don't complain being tunneled / face camped when you tea bag players then, I hope.
---
Flip flop, tenacity and unbreakable ❤️
---
Especially with the fact that they took the time and care to make this killer and the survivors truly unique! All new animations, a terrifying presence with the killer, perks that fit the characters, and nods to a show that many people enjoy. The Demogorgon is quite terrifying and Nancy and Steve are two survivors I feel a lot of people are going to be maining.
---
I have a good amount of games like that, I run spine chill, empathy, self care, botanist with a toolbox for a stealth/support hybrid. Thinking about swapping botanist for urban evasion, any thoughts guys? I'm fairly new with prolly around 20 hours played and I'm at rank 15 is that okay for time played? Just looking for input to see if I'm on the right track.
---
I screamed loud when I dislocated my fucking kneecap.
---
I agree with this. 
---
While there’s no way to tell if Inner Strength will become meta or not until a few weeks after it goes live, I really do think most games are going to have at least one survivor with it. I expect NOED to become rarer (except in lower ranks) and perks like Iron Maiden and Haunted Grounds to pop up more.
---
As an self-proclaimed totem hunter myself, I don’t see the need to change NOED. I thought this before and think it even more so with IS in the picture.
---
If ruin was like that then it would slow the game down a bit more than just a little bit
---
Sh, or they are going to instead nerf demo
---
Big Dick Ash Mains RISE UP
---
Oh oops
---
AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH Do I have to keep screaming? Ok. AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
---
Hearing a totem break when I'm phasing around in the spirit realm as Yamaoka. Really makes me feel nefarious and like they've just cracked the one wrong branch
---
Roaring as the Pig as I begin my ambush because I know from that point I have precious seconds to predict their flight path from around the corner
---
The Clown's disgusting, creepy laughter
---
Dwight, because he's precious
---
&gt; Look at devour hope. I could say it rewards you for failing your job as well.
---
I'm curious how you would make that case
---
What the hell happened here?
---
Spine chill is best friend.
---
Ego? I don't like ranking up as killer. Stops being fun.
---
Noob3 is the best one
---
Hell I’m a killer main myself and I’ve encountered salty survivors mains about twice or three times in my many hours of playing DBD. Not as many as some people think, at least on console.
---
Oh, don’t mind Tommy. He’s just have had his usual burst of energy.
---
I guess survivors will need to totem hunt and not just pass by them anymore.
---
I understand why you'd bring those up and I agree with you to an extent. MYC and HG both inflict the exposed status but that's only for a limited time whereas noed is unlimited. The only complaints I've seen regarding MYC was due to camping. And HG is just a lucky find because no one really suspects the killer to have it unless it's a Spirit.
---
Mild or sharp?
---
I gotta check out this Nancy perk. What is it again?
---
I havent seen anyone dc on first down in a while now
---
#BETRAYAL
---
Iron Maiden might need a minor tweak before higher rank killers start incorporating it into builds, but I 100% expect to see an increase in players running Haunted Grounds, and maybe Thrill of the Hunt (for Ruin protecting purposes)
---
2 beartraps next to eachother, the meta!
---
You misspelled 'balance' lmao. Please BHVR don't touch the nerf jar you will Ruin your sales. Who am I kidding they wait till everyone buys the dlc before they nerf.
---
Thank you for bringing this wonderful animation into my life.
---
That feel when ace is my main...
---
If you’re solo, and not SWF, bond might be the best perk in the game.
---
SWF? I got bond yah
---
Just kill them for not respecting the 96%
---
What are you talking about no they didnt
---
The problem is the teabaggers more often than not also complain the loudest when they get camped/mori'd.
---
Both survivors and killers can be toxic, and I myself play a lot of killer, but I haven’t encountered any toxic survivors, even when I play legion, but as survivor, I experience both toxic survivors and killers. I got a face camping leather face, a survivor who talked shit about every other survivor in the lobby (who then proceeded to DC after I down) and a meg who talked about the killer camping her.
---
There's more survivor than there's killers, so finding a shitty person is 4 times more likely.
---
It sucks cause Jeff is my second main, and also the ONLY survivor I dont have Iron Will for. Lol
---
They nerfed every new survivors best perk. What? Did you say M.O.M. Head On and Left Behind (technically Bill is new to console)? My bad my english isn't that good...
---
New to reddit and I am already noticing the community here in this sub wouldn't last in China's social system very long.
---
Being wrong with an audience is still being wrong.
---
Part of the reason I love Ghostface.
---
T-bag me, you fucker. I'll T-bag you right the fuck back.
---
Hilariously it actually worked in my favor. I T-bagged and remained crouching after an injured David dropped a pallet on me, I went to break the pallet and he tried to blind me with a flashlight. Problem being is that right after the animation I automatically crouched down, avoided the blind, and got the hit to down him.
---
Yeah. And I love getting downvoted and insulted constantly whenever I voice my opinions. Fans of any serious should criticize games. That's the only way the developers will listen or improve. If you just blindly take whatever the developers give you... Each game will have less features. MK9 was so packed full of content and had the best roster of the series besides Armageddon. I would genuinely arguing MK9 is the perfect Mortal Kombat game. The controls are a bit dated but other than that it's easily the strongest.
---
Can't decide which is the worst game in the series though. MKX for mk11. At least MKX didn't have loot boxes and kill too many characters off off screen.
---
forsen1 I c bajs
---
SWF stands for Survive with Friends. Basically if you’re in a call with other people
---
Doesn't matter what it is to anybody. I play both sides. As survivor yay me I get time to do gens. As killer you are funny if you think your made up rules are going to make me go away when I know 2 of you are around waiting for me to leave. That's 3 people off gens of which I usually know where at least one is. I'm not going to follow you across the map because you think I'm stupid. I know your buddy is there and I'm gonna go smack him too.
---
Not gonna lie, Inner Strength does not work as well as I thought it would. I find it more of an inconvenience, even though it does heal faster.
---
I don't like getting one totem and then waiting to get hit, then finding a locker and healing up. I would rather just get totems as I see them and not worry about saving them for heals later. It's a cool perk but not something I think will bother any meta.
---
Problem being that if the player is actually good it just makes you run out of breath and does nothing to them.
---
Trash talk or trying to "trigger" your opponents into making bad plays only works on average players at best and completely destroys your chances of winning against a stronger player. T-bagging a Killer who can't Loop well may cause them to follow you, but against a Red Rank Killer you just wasted your speed boost, any amount of headstart the pallet would have given you, and you're not close enough to a jungle gym.
---
Or get hit with NoED is up to you
---
Left behind got a buff in the ptb, head on also got a buff where it lands more consistently, what are you talking about
---
I think ghostface is a solid b tier, he's basically just a better wraith with insta downs in his current state
---
did i say a nailgun? i meant a fifty caliber machine gun in a fully decked out bunker whilst i wear a full set of riot armour
---
At that point it's principle.  I have to land the hit because fuck.
---
According to this subreddit teabagging is the most toxic thing someone can do. But I guess thats only when survivors do it huh? When a killer does it its trivial? Lol.
---
&gt; I don't think looping is toxic unless 
---
Nobody thinks looping is toxic. This is just a Survivor bullshit strawman to pass off dumb ass memes like this. The only time you see someone saying looping is toxic, it's people that only play survivor trying to mock killer, or turn a legit criticism with Hyperporble, 
---
Killer: "hey abusing this broken mechanic or glitching this is toxic
---
Survivor: ZOMG YOU THINK LOOPING IS TOXIC!!! It's in the game, it's fair and not toxic. 
---
 and some times, you'll see killers using ironically.. Like one idiot or troll may have said it and now survivor only players took it and run with it now like it's a overwhelming sentiment.
---
I hate clown, he's so incredibly boring and basic, and he doesnt even have any good aesthetic or meme potential.
---
Yeah, most people seem to be saying that PC is the way to go, especially with the characters that I want to play. 
---
It's also good to hear that you can just kind of dive in with the DLCs. I'll probably grab Myers right out of the gate, along with Leatherface, since BBQ seems to be basically mandatory. Even if Bubba sucks, he's still my favorite idiot; I don't mind having him in the lineup. 
---
And it sounds like I'll need to give survivor a go too! That should fun. I'll have to ask my friends if any of them play the game because it seems like surviving with your friends or hunting them down is a good time.
---
Thanks for all of the advice!
---
100% agree.
---
I don't think he remembers who she is in the latest film. He just wants to recreate his 1978 killing spree
---
Rain isn't boring. He is the only male of his race depicted in the series. He is a prince. And he controls water and storms. The dude can shoot lightning or summon water and control it. He's much more interesting than the Joker who's been in the last 4 netherrealm games.
---
The problem is guest characters taking priority over Mortal Kombat characters. I'm fine with them being DLC and existing but when it's the same character for games in a row and we're about to go 10 years without playing as some original Mortal Kombat characters... It's pretty mind-blowing. We also had to have all three of the cage family members despite all of them roughly playing the same and the worst character in the series Jacqui Briggs who is just a copy of her dad. Glad we didn't get Takeda or Kung Jin who are much more popular.
---
Also we're Missing Mileena, Kenshi, Ermac, Rain, Stryker, the Cyborgs, and 2 of the Kombat kids from Mortal Kombat X.
---
I would argue that Mortal Kombat 9 or Mortal Kombat Armageddon have the best roster. Although I'm guessing you never played Armageddon. The game that literally had everyone. Each year the roster gets smaller and smaller and people like you defend it being filled with pest characters. Mortal Kombat 9 literally had the perfect roster in my opinion. All of the fan favorite characters plus some great DLC and easily the most content of any of the HD era games.
---
Meg is like 20-something right? I’d be surprised to learn there’s no r34 tbh.
---
How is it? You can do all of that and still die all the same.
---
Nooo its true i got camped again
---
At the rate at which pig keeps getting nerfed who knows where she'll end up
---
No, it doesn't show the auras for Second Wind or Inner Strength.
---
Inner Strength is done within a locker which removes auras and Second Wind is a passive insta-heal which means that you aren't actually filling up your heal bar over the timer. Instead you are instantly healed after the timer has finished.
---
I mean, a pretty decent part of Ghostface's Kit is using Night Shroud to tell you where the last survivor is while you're both looking for Hatch.
---
The amount of times where I'll be walking, suddenly see the "You're being revealed" pointer and then turn to see the Survivor is kind of staggering.
---
Uhh, exactly. That's kinda the problem - chases against her.
---
ᴵ'ᵐ ˢᶜᵃʳᵉᵈ...
---
When you see it
---
You'll shit bricks
---
It's what the Japanese do ok
---
Lol I remember tru3 played mirror Myers once and a surv tried to protect someone doing a totem and tru3 waited for them to finish. You can guess what happened next
---
I think when they designed his perk set, they made it so that you'd be getting rewarded in some way no mater what happened with your obsession. That way you can get STBFL if you never see them, PWYF if they keep popping up, and Dying Light if they're dead.
---
Tru3, Monto, and No0B3 are my favorites if I'm being perfectly honest.
---
She actually has one of the highest kill rates on all three platforms, [see here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/community-community-data-requests).
---
I was actually intrigued by Plague, but she doesn't seem super popular for some reason. Hag seems fun with the traps and the ability to scare the living daylights out of people. I'm hesitant on Clown simply because he seems so slimy and gross lol.

Thanks again for the tips! I'll start finding some youtube videos now!

1. That’s a toxic mentality

One makes your terror radius 0 and the other doesn't.
---
Question that explanation as much as you want, it kind of deserves it, but that's their reasoning. 
---
Also props for the JoJo meme.
---
Look at it this way, 
---
Why bother intercepting? It’s one thing if you’re getting totally annihilated and need to get one player off to possibly win,   But if you can keep hooking people 3 times then that’s the best way to win. That gets you closer to a perfect score, and you’re not denying the person the the hook a game, because no one wants to sit on the hook the whole time when they could be playing and earning their own points and having fun.
---
Demo
---
Thanks for the tips! 
---
I'm 100% playing this for fun, so I'm not about to let some angry children bully me into submission, nor will I try to rain on other people's parades. The whole purpose of this game is to have fun, and some people forget that.
---
Imagine getting stunned by a palette
---
I did this on the ptb yesterday at rank 7. Ended up being facecamped until my guy steve saved me.
---
There are ways to make her powerful in chases, yet satisfying to go against. Giving her power some ability to read with your eyes and not your telepathic abilities is what people want - the people who want her power to not be strong are pussies. I want to know when I did something to stop myself from dying and it wasn't just her messing up, and that's what Spirit is. Killers should be in control, but not unstoppable.
---
I think she is very powerful but shouldn't be nerfed. 
---
It's nice to have a killer other than the Nurse be stupid strong. I love it even as a mostly survivor player. Yeah she sucks to go against but keeps me humble when I get destroyed by a Spirit every now and then.
---
Are you the spirit i just played that told me there was counterplay to her phasing?
---
I dont get what this means

I’m on the fence with NOED: on the one hand, it’s utterly fucking infuriating getting hit by it when you’ve managed to stay hidden all match; on the other hand, one of my favorite killer builds is **Literal Nightmare Freddy**, which is an entirely endgame build (NOED, BW, BBQ, RM). 
---
That being said, I adamantly refuse to use it on any other build due to how situational it is. Besides. my friend and I are die hard totem hunters, which is absolutely delightful denying a killer their NOED, and not having it at endgame is too much of a gamble for my tastes.
---
Coming to your house and playing little piggy went to the market is also a game but it's only fun for one of us!!!!!!!!
---
I'm sorry that brought up some stuff
---
I play console so all this ptb stuff does not effect me at all so saying it as if I am supposed to know it is hilarious.  I am new to reddit and I don't suck the tit of the newsfeed in this sub cause when I do it is mostly complaining and trolling. 
---
So again, what are you saying exactly cause you say it as if it has been in the game for a while now? You are funny, yarp...
---
The learning curve does worry me a bit, especially since I want to play as Nurse and Huntress, but I figure that it should be a nice challenge too. I'm not playing to get to high ranks, I'm just playing for fun. Which is also why I'm just choosing killers who seem like they have fun power sets.
---
No she's not op, but redditors love to bitch about her because she's not as difficult to play as as nurse.
---
I haven't played against a pro Michael in soooo loooong. It's killing me. Where are all the good Michael players???
---
The dash works with exposed effects
---
Yea that Ace was fuckin up
---
Thank you so much for the tips!
---
Dont see the disrespect I just see survivor gameplay against a spirit
---
Buy the perks to take them out of rotation
---
A huntress just messaged me the other day saying she just wants to throw a few hatchets and then we could escape. Wholesome &lt;3
---
then you don't belong at red ranks.  Dunning-Kruger effect in action.
---
When will people finally learn that green ping don't mean shit?
---
Wish I could see GFs perspective.
---
And you must not have any time if you can't use the searchbar.
---
That.... is feedback. Spirit can't use her power if she's moving. If she's standing still, she's either using her power or trying to play you. That is literally feedback. Like, quite literally. I can already see where this conversation is gonna go though, so I'm just gonna call it here.
---
I think it is. If you look the one on the back might have breasts, or well one showing anyways, while the one next to Susie does not.
---
My dude. Have you seen this sub lately? Pretty much every recent post with the Nobody meme has at least one of these turbovirgins trying to shame people for having a different sense of humour.  
---
The reason there isn't one here is because I beat 'em to it, and evidently they hate being called out in this manner.  
---
And you wanna call me obnoxious ♥ That's cute ♥ You're cute ♥
---
What's even more annoying and nonsensical is that Franklin's demise doesn't work on the pigs dash attacks. Are you fucking kidding me, being surprised by a dash attack and hit by it doesn't cause them to drop their item? Ridiculous
---
It is trivial on both sides.
---
Dwightsitters
---
These look awesome! Good job!
---
Doubt it. They're two completely separate things.
---
I also find that often the cocky pro looper will waste time trying to get my attention and sometimes just chase me down being completely unproductive.
---
With boobs you can never be sure.
---
Wait, how the hell did a Cypress Mori prompt and action trigger on a survivor that wasn't the last one? Did the DC just confuse the game?
---
Cutie cunt cunt
---
Purple, try again.
---
Yes this is what I meant thank you
---
Throw hag in there, too. Pretty sure she has no eyes either on her base skin.
---
Wasn't actually his theory either.
---
What about the chance that you run into another looper
---
The entity has come to claim them
---
Then he has no terror radius.
---
Nah
---
While I would like Mileena she is cannocically dead (which is fucking stupid btw).
---
I  do also agree with you on MK9 having the best roster in the game
---
Survivors are different from killers in that they have no power and all perks are interchangeable. His perks by and large aren't very good but that doesn't mean you have to stop playing as him. Every survivor has 3 unique perks. Getting that survivor to level 40 unlocks their perks to be found in other survivors bloodwebs.
---
So you could start playing Meg Thomas for instance. Level her up to get her perks unlocked and then get those on Ace so you can keep playing as Ace.
---
Why do people see somebody doesnt like something, and then proceed to be an annoying jerk about it instead of just ignore it?
---
That may be the case for some people, but I’ve noticed once you get lower in the ranks, killers start to realize that tunneling a survivor usually loses them the game. I really only see red rank killers tunnel toxic survivors.

Thanks for sharing this was so cute I didn’t know about this channel now I want to watch all their videos lol. Also poor spirit 😂
---
This is gonna go bad I can already tell plus if keems running a tourney it's gonna be even worse considering how that garden gnome acts
---
If you ran back into her, you weren't paying attention. And even if you did, she still has to wait as long as she held her blink allowing you to still outplay that. It is far from the same thing. When a Nurse holds up her hand, she is going to blink. There is no canceling that blink to force Survivors to run into her.
---
When Spirit's feedback ends, it opens up to 3 different outcomes, all of which you have no control over. And you shouldn't have MORE control than the killer, no, but you should have some say in whether you die or not. You don't.

I honestly believe that now your mind is set on simply "countering" anything I say. You keep wanting to put me in this secret survivor main box and completely disregard that I clearly showed that I do understand the struggle of both sides. It only seems manipuuand juvenile because that's what YOU want to believe and its gotten to the point where nothing of actual value is being said, you're just wasting both of our time. 
---
Clear your head, get rid of the salt or whatever it is that's preventing you from believing that I really do understand both sides, and find something constructive to say. If you can't then I will kindly ask you to leave.

You do know the killer can still hit you whilst you're in the air right it's not like you're immune all they have to do is look down and swing
---
This is man is stuck in 2009

Yea it would but we already know dbd tournaments go  which is really really bad

---
The killer look down whilst falling above him and swung but apparently that's game breaking
---
You should definitely switch to someone who has better teachable perks. Ace’s perks are kinda for messing around, looting chests and stuff. I recommend Nea, Feng, or Meg. Nea for Balanced Landing and maybe urban evasion because it can come in handy sometimes. Feng for all her perks because they are good for beginners, and Meg for sprint burst and Adrenaline.
---
Am on Xbox and I want to Nurse main. I hate my FPS.
---
idk lmao if you messaged me on ps4 probably, because I play on console
---
SeXy TiMe HaS bEgUn
---
Isn't he the guy that nobody wants on DBD because of his toxicity?
---
I've long maintained that there should be a secondary debuff from getting hooked/hit that incentivizes target switching without the need for perks. 
---
Something like 4% slower action speed after first hook, 10% after second, 2% per hit taken, ect. Number of course, are off the top of my head and not at all spoken with balance in mind. 
---
Just make it so the killer doesn't feel like he needs to absolutely commit to every chase or his time is completely wasted. Then we can actually "just switch targets" like survivors always say we NEED to.
---
Yup,,,
---
Step one: stop playing on mobile

The saddest games are when a killer chances me no matter what. Yesterday, a Huntress kept chasing me and I’d run all around the map to lose her. Then we’d accidentally make eye contact while she was chasing someone else, and she’d start chasing me again.

Yep same guy.

Hey I mean still free health though
---
I think it’s a similar situation as Nurse - at base she’s okay, but some add ons make her a bit too potent. Prayer beads bracelet is the obvious one, but Yakuyoke amulet is really strong and even some of her green add ons make her a bit too good in my opinion, especially when you stack them. They essentially remove a lot of the weaknesses of her power, which removes a lot of counterplay.
---
I have two problems first of all dead by daylight isn’t ready at all for tournaments secondly keem is a toxic asshole
---
I HAD A NURSE BRING A EBONY MORI WHEN WE OFFERED TWO BPS. SHE INSTANTLY FINDS EVERYONE WITH INFECTIOUS FRIGHT AND TUNNELED ANY UNHOOKS TO GET THE IMMEDIATE MORI. REASON FOR BRINGING IT: "I DON'T LIKE BLENDETTES". THE TWO CLAUDETTE'S HAD BEEN DOING GENS THE WHOLE GAME AND WERE THE ONES WHO BROUGHT THE BPS. HE ONLY MORI'D THE CLAUDETTES AND KILLED MYSELF (MEG) AND THE NEA BY LETTING US BLEED OUT.
---
In my opinion NOED is fine as is, you don't want to encounter it? Cleanse every dull in the match, sure it takes time but hey at least there's no nasty surprise for when them gens finish. I personally relied on it in the past with freddy before his rework, so am I a bit biased? Maybe, I don't main killer or survivor I play both equally at 700 hours in game.
---
I do it, for that reason. Helps against 4man swfs who have one guy in red ranks who is really good
---
You know keems really bad when the dbd community hates him and calls him toxic.
---
Maybe one day
---
Oh I've had this happen a lot too, when they notice I'm not chasing them they'll chase me down trying to taunt me / piss me off to get me to go after them. I just kinda laugh and still target someone else because that just lets me waste 2 peoples time /shrug.

Tea bagging is a good tool gets the killer to chase you so survivors can do gens

This happens so often

He is not strong, but he is fun
---
bruh,just do my "dull/annoing" strat,if you can't win the chase,let him,perhaps later you can take other with the guard over and have a easy chase to win
---
So the other day I got into a match with a P3 Nurse running Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy, Whispers, and an Ebony Mori. They proxy-camped the basement and had 3 people hooked in the basement before even a single gen was done. Everyone then suicided and the Nurse found me and downed me just to slug me for half my bleedout bar for no other reason than being toxic and then hook me and hit me on the hook while I died. Then she types "gg ez ty 4 free win" in the chat and immediately left.
---
To quote an asshole on Reddit who was shaming me for being Rank 6:
---
&gt;Keep being shit and being hardstuck purple. I'd say I'll see you in game but you're far too low ranked to ever be matched against me on either side lmfao. like I said, go watch a fungoose stream and you'll quickly (or maybe not, seems you have double digit forest gump IQ) understand how terrible you are.
---
and to quote myself:
---
&gt;Can't imagine why I don't enjoy red ranks.
---
Yeah getting genrushed then getting GG EZ  most games isn't fun.
---
Dude it says your a bloody nea duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuud
---
he isnt weak and he is fun, hes not on Huntress Level, but way above Trapper/Wraith
---
Wb his finger fetish though?
---
I wish Myers’ “hmp” was instead “ArGh.”
---
They said something like “a chad wouldn’t have stood up after that” when you literally need to in order to take the clip
---
Nah, I’d say he’s below trapper, but above wraith
---
What happened did the neas hurt you?
---
I think it's kind of childish to pick and choose what swear words you're okay with. It's either all okay or none of it is okay.
---
I think it’s really important to recognize when a chase just isn’t worth. Sometimes they’re in an area with really good looping potential, or sometimes you’re just better off chasing lower skilled players in the game to get pressure off of you.
---
Legion is imo a decent mid tier but not great in anyway. Hella fun though. Know what you’re doing easy 4K until red rank typically
---
I don't think the current survivor meta is to have two exhaustion perks.
---
Yes lol omg pls make it happen community pls 😂🙏👌🏳️‍🌈👏😮🤣🌩🚘🇧🇩😆🇦🇫🇧🇪😟😚🙁😏😖🙃🧐😍🤨😑💀😶👽🤕✂️✂️✂️
---
You mean the only objective.
---
Very true.  
---
Killers just kill.  That's their job.  Survivors however have a whole host of rules they expect killer to abide by while simultaneously t-bagging at the end of every game.
---
It’s super easy to counter, turn left or right hard. He can’t change direction once he pounces. Doing a nice 360 will throw it off too. It’s super easy to doge once you get used to it
---
IMO a good ghostface is more reliable but a good myers can snowball really hard if they get the chance.
---
"I think we did pretty good job so far"
---
A survivor unplugging does weird things in this game
---
Both of them had pedophile allegations against them. Yamimash used to have a thriving community, but now is a streamer with about 50-100 viewers. Tobuscus rarely uploads. The allegations were responsible for this, but can you guess where the allegations started?
---
No I want me points grrr
---
You have to make the correct read on absolutely no viable feedback. And the only way to actually make a correct read is if she's bad and goes into phasing right away. A good spirit will wait to see what you do and react accordingly, to which you have no tell, clue or feedback that she stopped waiting for you to make a move, and she's phases right on top of you.
---
Stand still, wait to see what they do, react accordingly will gift you guaranteed hits each time you phase. The Survivor has to predict you and can get punished no matter they play they make, you only have to react to what you see. It's like the Survivor is taking a test in which the question is blanked out, forcing them to guess the answer each time, whereas the Spirit is taking a test that gives you the answer in the question itself, but it's up to her to circle the right answer.
---
Sunk cost fallacy.
---
If they don’t finish the chase, then the last 30 seconds were “wasted”. But even if they continue the chase, they’re still not getting those last 30 seconds back, so they shouldn’t be considered when deciding if continuing the chase is worth it or not.
---
Gonna go ahead and state that they've already said him being able to use noed and the like with shred is unintended same as pigs dash relax boys

for me it’s completely fine if they reworked that addon cuz I don’t use it but yeah I think it is counterable, me personally when I get into good survivor lobbies I don’t find it extremely easy to win even if I use good addons
---
No, he's just a manipulating career ending scummy asshole. And the only reason people believed him is because he had a decent following.
---
1. PC, please.
---
2. Not necessarily. 
---
3. It is always good to have both POV in order to improve your gameplay.
---
4. Playing killer will be very frustrating sometimes, if you get furious at videogames consider not buying.
---
Well thats because its actually a shit meme which a very little persentage of people like. Dont post things on a forum that you know they arent gonna like. You know, you really arent making yourself look better by acting confident using heart emojis and saying the word "cute". Have a good day and enjoy your downvotes.
---
Eh, I don't know I mostly don't like the ones that are meant as derogatory. Like I don't care if they are used jokingly since it's just teasing. However when you use them to directly insult someone I don't like them, in that way I don't like most swear words since I prefer cursing for a more comedic effect, probably why I like this meme
---
Yeah I’m sick of killers getting the nerf hammer so quick because people complain first, think later.
---
Even wraith would be disgusted by legion
---
*blushes*
---
Lmfao, that would be a nasty idea for like a red add on or something
---
The way I see it, you are only offended by the word because you let yourself be offended by it. Words are meaningless, so you shouldn't be offended by them.
---
Aww you’re such a nice killer.
---
It's satisfying when you personally cleansed 5 totems and then get smacked by (clown, freddy, pig) who instantly dcs after because you don't go down in one hit.

RED RANKS HAVE BEEN THE FUCKING WORST I SWEAR TO GOD. I GET PAIRED WITH 10+ RANK SURVIVORS FOR WHAT REASON?AND WHY IS THE KILLER ALWAYS THE ONLY ONE IN THE RED RANKS WITH ME?
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU CAMPING ME?AND THEN WHEN YOU GET CALLED OUT FOR CAMPING YOU SAY "BUT I WASN'T FACECAMPING, I LEFT" NO U DIDN'T, YOU SIMPLY WENT BACK AND KEPT LOOKING AT ME AND LOOKING BACK TO SEE IF ANYONE WAS COMING, WHAT DO YOU GET FROM THAT?YOU'RE DERANKING AND GETTING 4 RUSHED GENS AND ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS KILLING ME?
---
AND THE WORST FUCKING PART ABOUT IT IS THAT I GET NOTHING FROM THIS. REACH RANK 1, GET AN ACHIEVEMENT, WHAT ELSE?N-O-T-H-I-N-G. THE FUCK AM I RANKING UP FOR?TO WASTE MY TIME AND HAVE A WORSE EXPERIENCE?AND THEN GET CALLED OUT WHEN I'M PLAYING IN YELLOW OR GREEN RANKS BECAUSE "I SHOULDN'T BE HERE"...YOU CAN NEVER WIN.
---
SKINS, CHARACTER UNLOCKING CHANCES, BADGES, IN GAME ACHIEVEMENTS (NOT THE REGULAR STEAM ONES), IDK FUCKING SOMETHING.
---
So my first guess was correct and yea keem is Definitely a career ruining scumbag. Wish YouTube would ban him but since dramaalert isn't "owned" him they can't do anything
---
I didn’t say the nerf made sense or was justified. I said this is why they did it. It’s stupid I know.
---
The fact he hasn't gotten a skin yet means the copyright holders are probably pieces of shit and will only give us the bare minimum.
---
Demmogrion
---
I never meant any disrespect, and rereading my comments, and yours, I can see how I can come across as negative.
---
You're right, context matters.  I want to be more positive, and I commented hastily, assuming the worst.  I don't want to be a part of the toxicity of the community.  I'd like to be a positive part of it.
---
For whatever a rando's apology is worth on the internet, I apologize.
---
Thinking back to my own experience, it is rather humbling and rewarding when I have outplayed a toxic killer.  And whenever a killer makes a mistake like this, or acts cocky, maybe they'll learn something from their humility, as you suggested.
---
Part of me must be bias, because all I've ever received are toxic PMs from survivors when I'm playing killer.  Or toxic PMs from other survivors when I'm playing survivor.  I've played as "fairly" as possible throughout my short time with the game, and have lost, not sacrificing a single survivor, and I've *still* gotten PMs afterwards, trash talking me.  Yes, from survivors who successfully escaped.
---
I had to turn off messages from strangers, because the hateful comments I'd get here or there really soured the game for me.  Like, you won already...  Why take time out of your day to flame me?
---
I'd much rather live in ignorance than have to deal with the vitriol spewed at me by teabagging SWF groups.  And the last thing I want is to become that which I hate.

Offense seems way to strong of a way to describe how I feel, it's more distasteful and honestly more of an empathetic distaste. People can call me anything they want and I'll just laugh since they end up insulting themselves more than they do me since their showing how petty they are. But I don't like seeing other people who don't deserve that treatment get cussed out
---
That's not true. If a Spirit sits there to watch you, you break line of sight and run the hell away. Or break line of sight and hide. You can get to another loop. You have options. You don't automatically die.

Are you sure about that? I recall it being the reverse where you could flick your camera around and accidentally reveal him accidentally during the ptb thrn making it the way it is now after everyone griped that his power was worthless

That's a very good attitude to have. I wish everyone in the DBD community thought this way

I personally changed it to left directional button because im never going to press it for any reason.

Perks that reward killers for doing their job (getting survivors killed) are often pointless, like old dying light, it doesnt help you win, it helps you win MORE, because if you have a survivor dead that already sways the game in your favor in a huge way. It's almost always better to have perks that just help you period. Enduring "rewards" you for getting stunned, no one complains about that.

Sometimes you get the occasional killer who will down the second to last survivor and not hook him (this is called slugging). This way the hatch dosent open until there is one survivor left. And when there is a survivor down and knows where the hatch is they will lay over it till the other guy gets hooked and killed because he can still escape that way and is really the only way he can if the doors are not open
---
Leave him alone, just because hes a messy eater doesn't mean he shouldn't be allowed to have PB&amp;Js.

Well, looping is the only way to avoid a killer?
---
And how does that affect the killer with ability to teleport 32 meters within seconds
---
What’s his terror radius in tier 2 with monitor and abuse?
---
If it’s not too much to ask of course, thank you :)
---
What happened with the dbd community. Cant even do a good play without linking it to toxicity.
---
Imagine thinking any killer main worth their salt calls looping toxic.
---
Camping isnt not really fun tho
---
I feel like they will probably nerf the lunge to make it slower, but other than that everything else should stay the same
---
my watermark comment was targeted toward the guy who made the meme but i wouldn’t have apologized simply bc they didn’t apologize when they realized you didn’t go out of your way to steal it. i respect your maturity though
---
Not gonna lie you do sound like the aggressor in that situation

Watch to the end. The final scene is relevant to the question.

Why does it take you eighty seconds to power the generators? Just flip the switch
---
Dedicated servers are not live yet.
---
They are currently being tested in the Public Test Build available only for PC version.
---
Fuck this is good.
---
I'm a survivor main, and yeah, big time, absolutely.
---
Yea I definitely feel the lunge is gonna get hit with a nerf and everything else will stay the same because Bhvr has a habit of nerfing stuff that's good on release like Ghostface or Plague and freddy
---
They shouldn't rub anything
---
I never said MOM didn't need a nerf. They did the same thing with MOM that they did with legion. People where to dumb to understand that they both needed a rework and not a nerf. 
---
Never said it was close. But it discourages skillful gameplay and that's what they are pushing with the new preschools.
---
Bc totems are so fun.

It seems I've made a spelling error what I meant is face camp lmao
---
She has counterplay besides just "guessing" also you can use prediction skills
---
I have every character P3 max perks on the live version so I just did this because I really enjoy how Demo plays and I wanted to see the prestige for myself :p Here is a imgur of the individual prestiges! [https://imgur.com/a/GOXmATU](https://imgur.com/a/GOXmATU)
---
You cleanse my devour hope, I forget about your "no camp&amp; tunnel" rules.
---
Not really, I was looking for gens/totems when he found me the first time, I ran him around cause he was bad and I was running a situational perk that just so happened to come in handy, I never t bagged, or pointed at him, he just could win the chase
---
Because they "wanted to give the last survivor a chance if the killer closed the hatch"
---
What I mean by hitting a survivor who is already hooked means that they are actually *currently hooked*.
---
So it's the situation wherein the killer attacks a hooked survivor as if to say, "yeah, I'm gonna hit you some more while you're helpless" for no other reason than to be an asshole.
---
her hair looks like a spike lol
---
Actually not. I don't know if this is a problem on PC, but literally every pig I go against would hide, and camp, not letting anyone near the hook. Making the game not fun for anyone, wether it be an altruistic survivor, or the victim of the camping.
---
"50 years free from DbD..."
---
I faced my first nurse yester day on ps4, 5 gens and not a single hook...
---
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WILL EVER GET FIXED?? THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME AT LEAST 5 TIMES IN THE LAST 3MATCHES. AND IF THEY DONT MANAGE TO GET AWAY, THE GAME CRASHES.
---
Yeah we learn to get better at looping 😂
---
I personally don't ever get upset about a killer camping a gen that they know has been worked on, especially near end game.
---
Nani?
---
Yea still though you could've just waited until live to p3 them but thanks for showing us them and for the individual prestiges also do you plan on p3ing Nancy or Steve too?
---
When it comes to escapeing the Killer during a chase I’d highly advise against rubbing in any direction. Looping is definitely effective at the right spots against the right killers. Like me as Leatherface (not a fan) but with my Spirit build looping is what I hope 4.
---
I can agree with this
---
Sure, it might be a bit boring, but hey with hyper-altruistic survivors it's a free win and free bloodpoints to spice up the next game.
---
Rub? Keep that in the DBD porn section.
---
M8 I have 2000 hours into the game, and speaking from the actual numbers, my own experience, and what the devs said, disconnecting always benefits.
---
This fool went out his way to make a meme to send to people cuz they lost to him? Lmao what even
---
People are just terrible in general
---
Anything from the demogorgon now
---
It's literally perfect
---
Yikes, yeah I think I remember that
---
Kkyyyaaahhhhh
---
Not true they only temporarily turned them off. They are indeed on the ptb right now.

It's ALWAYS salty survivors that message me. Only one time did a killer message me with toxicity.

In the ptb?
---
I definitely feel that would be devastating as they cant do generators if they haven't worked on it and any close by ones get hit with 15% gone and if they tap it you can just PGTWs it making like 40% percent regressed and ruin would slow them down alot. Saying that out loud makes the build sound very scary
---
They should both work.
---
This is Not A Hooker, AMA :D
---
Plus with Pop I feel like Pop would be used with Surge destroying one of the gens a good bit. And Corrupt Intervention would give you a good amount of time to apply map pressure.

Man last night I felt so bad. This nurse was like, very new to the game and I ran her around for the entire game. Even made plenty of dumb mistakes they never got to capitalize on because they were so new
---
That sucks.
---
Just find perks you like and buy the game for them
---
One time I was in a swf and my buddy asks "Anyone know who the killer is?" And two seconds later he scared "JESUS CHIRST" while getting yoinked off a gen by mirror Myers
---
you sure doesnt huh
---
It would have to be the adults since they don't want children in the game (and I don't blame them).  
---
But it would be interesting to get one set of survivor perks along with a few survivor skins, similar to Legion.
---
That's..... Exactly a crutch if it's every killer. Do you know what a crutch is? Like an actual crutch. Something you NEED to walk around if your leg(s) are injured. Crutches don't help you when you're bad at walking. They're required in the situations that they're required. Ruin is always required. Like you said, it's a vital perk and there should be no vital perks. Yea you'd be a fool not to run it, that's the problem. There's no reason not to run it. No perk should be that good.
---
And then adrenaline goes off.
---
Lol I get downvoted for literally stating facts. They buffed and fixed his bugs that were in the ptb, but then after the official release they sent out a hot fix that nerfed him. It made him easier to spot basically.
---
Happy Cake Day!

I'm gonna be the friendliest Pig these baby nancys have ever seen.

Oh dang, it is. Thanks.

She could. They brought Shao Kahn, Jade, Baraka etc who are all canonically dead from the tournament in Mortal Kombat 3. Mileena was at that tournament. She was with all of them. Why didn't she come through the portal as well? It seems like the new incompetent writers haven't played previous games in the series and don't remember characters or what happened in previous games.
---
 For some strange reason erron black came through with them when they could have just had his present version. Kabal was even in the story and he did nothing but lose a fight and disappear for the rest of the game.
---
watching a trapper do a shinobi style warp kick to a survivor face sounds great.
---
😍 Love It!
---
Never called him an idiot originally, though
---
Killers are meant to hook survivors to sacrifice them right? Survivors being unhooked means they aren't being sacrificed, meaning you failed at sacrificing them (that time).
---
What even?
---
Also Ed Boon totally picks favorites. Scorpion and dvorah are like the only characters who get kills and they are both his favorites. Dvorah got to kill Baraka and Mileena in her first ever appearance. Then in the very next game she gets to kill scorpion. As well as a bunch of other characters off screen in the stupid comics that make up for lazy writing apparently.
---
Best thing yet. Every antagonist besides her dies. They all get what was coming to them but absolutely no consequences for her because she is his new favorite. Developers pet. I love when they randomly insert new characters into the story and say they have been there since the beginning and give them all of the kills or key plot points. Noob Saibot should have killed scorpion. Since scorpion was the one who indirectly killed and created him. Instead Noob Saibot just loses a bunch of fights in the story mode and disappears by the end. Oh well. Garbage game. Glad I got some money back for it today

Not really, if you said you didn’t like football and then someone made you sit through a whole game and then watch highlights, that wouldn’t be fun would it?
