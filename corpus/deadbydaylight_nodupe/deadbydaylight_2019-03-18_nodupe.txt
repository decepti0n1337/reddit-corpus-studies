I'm sorry, I don't encourage this, and I regret it, No0b3 is my favorite Youtuber/Streamer at the moment, and I don't normally get to watch his streams live, so this was exciting for me, however I let the attention get to my head.

---
&gt; Lastly, like hell it makes you tunnel. It's mostly helpful in finding Survivors without location perks.
---

---
I shouldn't say it makes you tunnel. What I mean is that unless you were to waste your time guarding the two Jigsaw Boxes (a horrible idea) the RBT becomes basically a non-issue for the single survivor you can RBT. Because that's a horrible way to play, the RBTs basically become useless entirely. They don't really slow the survivor down any, and are definitely not gonna kill anyone, so it seems like a heavy trade-off for the limited 12m aura reading, but maybe I just don't know the popular pig builds. Generally I thought Iridescent addons were pretty straightforward, but I just can't figure out why you'd opt for it versus some of her lower tier addons (Jigsaw's Sketch, Combat Straps, Bag of Gears, Last Will, etc.).
---
All that Activia really helped her out after all 
---
Ah I meant the left stick will eventually wear out, especially having to smack it side to side to struggle when picked up. Yeah I've gone through 3 controllers haha end result having it stop and go when moving forward
---
I dont spend my life on reddit. I just post what I post and every once in a while make a meme. I just ~~stole~~ improved yours.
---
Console here. 
---
Glad I cant chat. I would say some heinous shit.
---
So so soooo tired of playing killer against groups of 4. I CAN camp between two hooks and win. I dont. But these fucking cocksuckers like to group up and consta heal. Not fun.
---
Game 3/5. Fuck you. Uninstalled.
---
these perks are actually really well thought, i like it. though i think it should be something like 3/4/5 instead of 5/10/15
---
*Rank 1
---
Maybe it wasn’t gens? They did something to make a loud noise and I assumed it was a missed skill check for gens. Does anything else make a loud sound once an exit is open? I may have misunderstood the noise, but it wasn’t a fib. 
---
Ah, I see. My bad then. Again I fully agree, the matchmaking can get foofoo and the amount of sweaty SWF is annoying at best. 
---
Many things can make noise notifications, fast vaulting windows, lockers, dropping pallets, fast vaulting pallets. 
---
That’s pretty sad, here’s hoping you start learning how to make your own jokes sometime 
---
This happens to me aswell, I believe this to be a bug. Strangely enough, it never happens when I play as a survivor.
---
You’re not supposed to crouch around the entire map. You get a hook, see someone on bbq, get close to the gen, and crouch. A good pig player knows their terror radius, and can get close enough crouch before survivors hear it. This is why she’s underrated. You assume pig players are ambushes gens and crouching around the whole map.
---
It can be, sure. But It can also be BM, and I can tell the difference. Either way though, it's unfun for me and I don't have much of a reason to reward it. I don't blame people for using Decisive Strike or blinding me at every pallet, but I'm not going to handicap my BP/pip for those players. 
---
I’ve helped one guy to the hatch because he was right there and I felt bad for him 
---
Thanks, I’ve tried a few tactics and nothing seems to work. I’ve even tried giving myself up to the killer but I have the horrible luck of getting a killer that’s tunneling the others and ignoring me. I’ve never failed so badly...at failing, lol. I just keep breaking even all the time. I don’t want to be a complete hinderance to the team so think I’ll just wait till the update and see how the new ranking system works, maybe it’ll help me reach what my proper level is because I don’t think I belong at rank 1 survivor. Thanks everyone for the help, I appreciate it.
---
I 360 and struggle a lot, since dbd is my primary game (ps4), but my controller is still fine. Just gotta be more gentle- slamming the stick isn’t going to make it go faster
---
The og "I got your nose"
---
Hold up don’t all players drop on hatch I do if you played well and didn’t tea bag I’ll be happy to give you the hatch 
---
selfie time
---
You're probably right. Still weird though.
---
Lmao you're way too sad about a stolen meme that you didnt even put in the effort to actually make.
---
This made my life r/raimimemes + r/deadbydaylight = &lt;3
---
The Entity has some weird tastes.
---
You’re not supposed to crouch around the entire map. You only crouch when you know survivors are on a certain generator. BBQ can tell you that information. This is why she’s so underrated. You assume that pig players are just crouching around the entire map
---
Second picture from the bottom left is from {Monster Musume}. Thank me later.
---
You'd be surprised how long you can chase survivors around the hooks in the basements.
---

i know what it does, but it was ranked lower i’m pretty sure? i was wondering if something changed that made it more viable or something

Actually people are still bitching =/  people claim there will be server lag. 
---
Seeing r/dbdgonewild for the first time

The frickin speed boost it gives killers tho is the icing on the cake, like can you at least get rid of that?
---
Sure add me I’ll play whenever I can :)
---
My PSN is Galllade
---
LMAOOOOO
---
grrr he told me to get better at the game to counter a counterable perk, lemme just tell him to kill himself
---
Don't mind the downvotes enjoy the game
---
i love this
---
You should check out r/DBDGoneGay 
---
How dare you make sense.
---
/s
---
To killers that drop the last survivor on the hatch: I hope you all find a $10 bill on the ground, it tickles me as a survivor whose often last.
---
However, I usually get the killers who usually take me to the hook in front of the hatch and just hit me through my dying animation... 
---
Idk it's pretty obvious when the killer is coming towards you, with there being a heartbeat and all. Also you could just use your eyes you know, tee hee.
---
This is why my steam name will forever be big brain oink main. PIGGY GANG RULES
---
&gt;The frickin speed boost it gives killers tho is the icing on the cake, like can you at least get rid of that?
---
How about survivors get rid of totems?
---
People fail to realize that survivors have total control over NOED yet they continue to complain about it. 
---
I get it, it’s because Internet Explorer is slow!
---
How dare you make sense
---
**NOT /S**
---
These are both great ideas!
---
&gt;Congrats on being a dick, I guess?
---
How exactly am I being a dick? I am soloing and trying to play the game, if the killer camps me I just want to join the next game ASAP. 
---
Could always join the DbD discord and get a KYF going. Let them know you wanna practice a new killer or build. Some may be willing to join or even offer tips on your gameplay.
---
Y’all both need a nap. Calm down.
---
Lep in the Hood protagonists &gt;&gt;&gt; Jennifer Aniston tbh
---
Okay. As long as killers get a buff. Because the game balance issue is beteeen SWF and killer not SWF and solo who are on the same side and solo gets second hand benefits from SWF
---
Survivors have all the control over NOED. You just sound salty you died to it.

---
Silly, don't you know you have to give the last survivor hatch. Also when you hook someone you have to go to the corner of the map and just let them get saved peacefully. Remember isn't not about your fun, it only matters if the survivors are having fun, your just their to entertain them. (This is sarcasm if you couldn't tell, unfortunately I have to put this disclaimer.)
---
Add me @ Ripfaith. Anyone else here that wants to play should feel free to add me aswell :)
---
It’s always been a pretty damn good perk, most people just don’t care for the perk as perks like SB and SC are universally preferred. 
---
We ain't seeing you levitate though
---
to do 360s
---
spin left stick clockwise
---
flick right stick to the left and hold while spinning left stick
---
hope that makes sense..
---
and its the opposite to spin the other way
---
Actual serial killer would be too op and survivors would complain.
---
Yeah, that's the downside. A lot of players decide to try and hide, and wait out the last player so they can get hatch instead. I try not to bleed people out, so I have helped the 3rd person back up (picked up, dropped, picked up, etc. until they break free) and then gone for the 4th person. I refuse to let someone get hatch if they tried to let their teammates bleed out.
---
Evan and Freddy are easily the best. This is an amazing piece of art--Props to whoever made it. 
---
I like how you could kind of tell that you thought about it for a split second but then you were like "Nah it's meant to be."
---
DBD GODS send a msg
---
Happens all the time. They did not have a single item in their hands until the 5 seconds ticking starts. two insta heal medkits + flashlights kick in to fuck me up the whole trial.
---
That looks sick. I'm no longer turned off by hag.
---
How childish are you, do you think telling people to kill themselves is ok?
---
Rin didn't kill her father, she was killed BY her father.  Rin didn't kill anybody at all.
---
Yes, but I really like that they're intentionally shown to be as human as possible. There is or was a human beneath the mask. 
---
Or make DC'ing actually have a punishment instead of  just not getting points that game and two meanigless pips being removed...
---
To be fair, that is a valid concern, but I'm staying optimistic.
---
I play on PS4 and I've noticed a huge difference. I don't have to wait more than a few minutes for a match vs. before it would be like 30+ sometimes. 
---
Anger Issues: Your unbridled rage and anger hinders survivors from thinking straight. Hit survivors suffer from the blindness and exhausted status effect until healed.
---
-Youre selling rotten food!
---
The Entity doesn’t think like a human. You can’t begin to understand its intentions. 
---
Wrong......Pic........)’:
---
Because they buffed totem placement you fucking melt. They’re nowhere near as easy to find and if you do waste time trying to find them during the match it’s less time on gens which equates to the killer having more opportunity to down and kill people.
---
You stupid fucking melt. 
---
Imagine Leprechaun trying to get someone on a hook 😂
---
^ testify
---
BRO ITS JUST LAG!!!
---
Oh yes, because I do want to keep waiting for more than 10 minutes for someone to jump in the hatch instead of playing another match.
---
What the fuck
---
When you realize the Killer has Rancor and you're in their Terror Radius 
---
&gt;Because they buffed totem placement you fucking melt. They’re nowhere near as easy to find and if you do waste time trying to find them during the match it’s less time on gens which equates to the killer having more opportunity to down and kill people. You stupid fucking melt.
---
Salty much.
---
They are just as easy, you just need to get closer to actually see the totem (the "change" made it so they can put them closer to walls / objects) but they are spawning in the same places for the most part. 
---
Let me fix that broken nose for you.
---
How do you feel about the killer perk Rancor?
---
Gives bonus speed to actions when the killer is facing you (including vault speed), alerts you when a killer is coming. Really good for small terror radius killers or stealth killers like Wraith/Pig.
---
I like it a ton. Gives you a nice warning.
---
How do Evan and Anna STILL radiate Daddy and Mommy energy even outside of the Entities relm
---
This reminded me of the piper perri
---
that gave me anxiety watching! Goodness! Great job! 
---
When you get to use their line on them... Gold
---
Thanks!
---
Wait, that's illegal! His map so his rules I'm guessing Lol? I didn't know about this either.
---
Imagine if there was a Survivor perk that made it so everyone could take three hits when the exit Gates where powered?
---
I'm guessing that Myers was taken after the events of the first film.
---
Good attention to detail with his eye.
---
I'm honestly repulsed... It should be called r/DeadByGaylight. Come on guys, it was right there!
---
That’s a statement.
---
Tier 1 ruin only affects 2 people while tier 2 affects 3... and tier 3 affects everyone
---
I like this 
---
Considering that Clown is a chaser you need 1 gen perk (Pop Goes the Weasel), 1 tracking perk (Spies From the Shadows), and then two chase perks. Distressing really is only good for running Unnerving or just getting Devious points, which Clown does well, but well enough he doesn't need that perk. If you run it with Caulorophobia, then you need Nurse's to see them healing.
---
I recommend using Enduring as one of the chase perks, with either Spirit Fury or Brutal Strength to deal with pallets.
---
Concerning the upcoming chapter with the Plague's perks, Corrupt Intervention might be a good replacement for Pop. *Maybe*.
---
Come on. There was a big nerf for Claudette in the last chapter! xD
---
This... is so amazing.... but then again I'm just easily amused. 
---
Thank you, it means a lot.
---
Seems to be a Perfect pixel peak LMAO
---
Thats my usual style, but it hurts oh so bad when they carry me right past an event hook and slap me ln a regular one
---
Try it on Lerys or the game it's super fun especially if you're into stealth killers/ jump scares.
---
It's not super strong but seeing auras as a stealth killer can be very strong in the right hands. Especially if facing immersed survivors
---
Fresh Meat: At the start of the trial, 1/1/2 survivors are revealed to you for 5/6/7 (timer does not include the spin-around open to every map) 
---
-It seemed like he knew exactly where we were at all times. This man isnt and ordinary man.
---
This happened to me once. Seems to be a random occurrence, doesn't seem to happen when you play Survivors. Do note I'm a Survivor main, I play Killer on only very rare occasions.
---
Holy...
---
That's like saying not to DC when getting tunneled/moried 
---
Borrowed time, you?
---
Farming hooks,you?
---
Breakdown, you?
---
Probably has been said a thousand times but i also que for 10-15minutes as a survivor, i only see a turn for the worse. Hope bhvr gets this fixed and actually working / ps4
---
I mean, Susie would still be a killer, just an unwilling one.
---
Scooby-Doo I think velmas Prego
---
LMFAO
---
Being the first on the hook, esp. if it is early in the game sucks. 
---
But taking out one survivor is super beneficial for the Killer. Which is why I usually guard my first hooked survivor pretty closely. Because if they unhook him under my nose I can put him down again quickly it becomes a 3v1 .
---
Facecamping like the guy in the video is not very efficient, but I can understand the mentality of "I AM GOING TO KEEP THIS ONE" .
---
Good for you that you were able to exploit his misplay. 
---
Stand still so you go invisible as wraith maybe? I think that'll get rid of the weapon, then you can crop the distorted edges out.
---
If it's a new survivor or he played well I do that, I also do it when the person got farmed on the hooks with people unhooking the survivor in front of me.
---
People be mad and blame the DC or suicide for not escaping don't let it bother you
---
&gt;Yeah I'm just gonna go looking for totems like a dunce while my teammates are dropping like flies and aren't doing any of the gens...
---
&gt;What I'm trying to say is that it is unreasonable to expect a solo survivor to make sure all five totems are cleanse on top of having teammates that aren't pulling their weight. Of course Swf fixes this but we all how broken coordinated swf groups can be.
---
&gt;Honestly if they just added a totem counter to small game I'd be happy. Cause tbh its current version just has me running back and forth like and idiot with that annoying ass bell sound ear-raping me lol.
---
I play solo and I easily remove all 5 totems in most maps. What you are stating is an issue with individual players skill so why touch a perk because of it? People need to either get gud at cleasing totems or at being chased. 
---
I agree with you regarding wasting time when your team is useless but this is no NOEDs fault. 
---
I also want a counter to Small Game. 
---
While I agree that it’d be stupid, Adrenaline already is the yin to the NOED yang.  I’m also not insinuating Adrenaline is broken. 
---
Why do your grapics look so amazing! You on ps4?
---
Oh a LOT of the DLC killers and survivors have top tier perks or playstyles. Spirit is one of the best killers in the game. Myers is a really fun one to play when you want to give survivors heart attacks. Freddy is sort of a joke but his bloodwarden perk is really good. You can spend in game currency to get the characters but the dlc 's are cheap enough that if you want to spend money it's pretty worth it
---
“This old Lep, he played a lot. He played pogo on his lot” as he teaches them about stealing his gold.
---
Or a good ‘ol top o’ the mornin’ to ya as he drags Dwight out of his locker.
---
Clown has zero map pressure. Pig has her traps that force survivors to get them off. There is not counterplay like not healing against legion. You HAVE to get the trap off or you die. And yes, every killer benefits from BBQ. But pig benefits more simply because it allows her to sneak up on the generator. 
---
This. The chemistry was not there, it also didn’t help that they were slow and lacked any presence. 
---
Oh God. 
---
Hot
---
Nah ur wrong
---
Have you played her?
---
Imagine what'd happen if killers can hide in the locker
---
And people should be nice and fair 👌 good luck preaching 
---
All day today it’s been nothing but Wraiths on PS4 for me! Maybe a bunch of people got the same daily? 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
That actually dope tho you can earn the dlc, not used to that in the games i play loll
---
As a survivor main, I have set rules as a killer.
---
1) If you don't play like a jerk, neither will I
---
2) If your team DC's on you, you get to finish gens and a free hatch
---
3) If your whole team is dead and I find you before you find the hatch, you get the hatch.
---
I generally never go for 4k's unless the team is toxic/nasty the entire time. I know it's an objective game so I never really go after gen-rushers. It's not fun when everyone takes the game so serious, especially when a killer decides to tunnel, terrorize, or just berate the team.
---
Just watch a youtube video or something while you're being camped I guess
---
Because he’s a handsome, gentle fella that even survivors can appreciate. 
---
“What’s that on your shirt” 
---
“Ahahahahaha”
---
Daaaaang, that’s a good one...RIP
---
Maybe she kills the survivors because to her, we all look like her father.
---
Nah dude this community is trash, there's a lot of good, but a lot of bad too.
---
True, they unhook you and leave you die. 
---
I think since we keep getting more and more killers as time goes on, it's probably that last bit.
---
Felt good man
---
You shouldn’t have anything to worry about, then. If your teammates are that bad, it’s not hitting end game anyhow. 
---
"Imagine if I hadn't been drunk"
---
Just a side note: This was my first day streaming, so at the time I haven't figured out all the quality settings. I have mostly fixed the settings for now, but sorry for the bad quality lol. 
---
Just two things, 
---
One Amanda needs to look more... Crazy, she was all fucked up after Jigsaw 
---
Two My boy doc should be more... Sadistic, he worked at a gov torture place 
---
Other then that, Rin fav 👌
---
Yeah Anna and Freddy are cute or whatever but don’t forget that they are literally child murderers. 
---
&gt;if you do waste time trying to find them during the match it’s less time on gens which equates to the killer having more opportunity to down and kill people
---
As if that's a bad thing? Something that slows survivors down isn't a bad thing. You sound like you're salty because you didn't get your safe genrush. 
---
I mean sure but a lot of killer mains are gonna complain cause they won’t be able to rely on killer advantage anymore. 
---
Also let’s be real here, how much faith are we willing to put in the devs to not mess up the servers?
---
It’s been like this for the better part of a week now for me, it’s insane 
---
I would agree with you if he had shoes or something I can’t stand see his nasty feet 
---
Did you ask Grafo for this?
---
You have to buy each teachable perk in order before the next one will show up.
---
I would lol. Don't need no pitty pips!
---
I can appreciate a good stomping. Letting them go also usually leads to a friendlier post game chat.
---
Killers be like "I can't sprint!"
---
This meme was made by Legion gang.
---
Both will show up as teachable just pick the one you want and carry on blood warrior
---
I noticed that too. And they all cloak &amp; stand next to the hook.
---
I like that Evan still looks like a dick.
---
The best stun noise in the entire game.
---
Why does Ana look like a guy?
---
You did extremely well against those hackers!
---
Below Spirit, above Huntress, and the 4th best killer. Good set of addons, but doesn't even need them to successful rekt a team of survivors.
---
She has an instadown ability built into her base (unlike the Huntress which requires a very rare addon for that). She can turn the survivor's strength against her (instaheal from the fountain) into her own dangerous projectile. And she can throw said dangerous projectiles from side-to-side (which the Huntress can't do) in an arc which can go over objects, shutting down loops. All while moving at 115% speed which the Huntress can't do. 
---
She's good in a chase because of the ability to break a survivor quickly (5 seconds of constant vomit) and down them. Should that fail, the longer you run from her, the greater the chance of you getting broken become and then M1'd. She wins either way.
---
It's difficult to loop her so survivors attempt to stand behind pallets and objects to shield them or bait her into a stun, but that will not work against high rank killers who know how to angle themselves properly and mind-game. Stealth is your best bet and spreading out ad hammering gens since she doesn't move fast enough to apply great gen pressure.
---
Unlike Myers and the Nurse, the corn is no good against her because of her side-to-side projectiles, and neither are windows. You're not going to be safe at Lery's (too many windows) or Lampkin Lane (her projectiles will easily hit you over the short fences, and your infinite will be shut down), Backwater Swamp (too open - no where to hide from being broken/hit), or Badham Preschool (again, fences are too short and you won't be able to loop her). The only map that should bother her is Mount Ormond. If not that, then good luck.
---
All in all a great killer who in the right hands is a superb killer.
---
My blood web is always packed with useless everything so I feel ya pain 
---
Not to say Prayer Beads aren't busted, but I personally find them unfun and limiting to play with. I switch up my targets a ton so I'll hit someone and then pull a survivor off a gen when they think I'm in a chase nearby. Movement and/or charge addons are a lot better for map pressure in my opinion.
---
That said, I think they should come with some sort of downside like extra charge time at the very least. 
---
Seems like their internet sucked from what I saw.
---
are you sure that was a lag switch? He caught you either way there.
---
It reflects the real world, don't expect people to be nice killer/survivor wise, if it's on sale and yellow u got buddy's who also play it yeah it can be fun 
---
Welcome to the fog 
---
That blows! He’s one of my least favorites to go up against. I just went up against a Hillbilly who was just standing in one place swinging the whole game. I think it’s a sign I should quit for the day. 
---
im sure.
---
If I am being face camped and I see that the team is actually doing gens then I stay on the hook to waste the killers time. On the other hand, if the team is crouching around the corners of the map doing fuck all, you better believe I’m moving onto the next game. 
---
Take it bitch
---
Say my name
---
W9ooooooo
---
It was corrupt one get three free. The Entity is a bargain hunter apparently.
---
Atleast he's not complaining about the killer being weak before anything is even revealed about them, looking at you tydetime.
---
Short hair and stronk Russian body can give the impression it’s a guy.
---
Even with the hacks or lag those guys aren't the best players lol  
---
Nice touch with Myer's eye, love the whole piece
---
“And I never insinuated his bias was a bad thing”
---
I mean I agree with a lot of what you’ve said but your first comment is literally asking why would people ever watch Tru3 because of his biases. 
---
She got back up, killed him, and the reason why was cause she was reanimated. Where do you think she got the sword? She was dying, and demanded bengance. So the Entity gave it.
---
&gt; He’s one of my least favorites to go up against.
---
why's that?
---
You drop coins at the exit gates to win lol
---
I'm not interested in levelling Feng beyond 35. Kate and Jeff are the only skins I like.
---
It's rare that all 4 survivors die and reach the end game lobby at the same time.
---
Pretty good job so far... 
---
Ah I remember playing with one of my friends and he ran through the gates. Much raging ensued, basically going past those pillars causes the trap to trigger and stuff.
---
You forgot monitor so you have 0 tr
---
Very fun game, but some people can be over the top toxic. I ended up quitting for a long time because the community was just so bad. 
---
But, if you’re willing to put up with that and the bugs, it can be an amazing game with hours of fun. 
---
But you can still hear her. And survs are in 3rd person. The fact that you think survivors don't have eyes shows me where your mindset is.
---
Both parties are at fault. You could say "killers could just hit the survivor" but at the same time survivors could just run away, and do gens if the killer doesn't follow them.
---
I'm still very new at this game but I'm slowly learning how to properly loop and buy time. Still dont know how to properly lose the killer without just leading them to someone else but I'm happy that my skills are improving!!! 
---
The generators could be swapped for pots of gold to gain safe passage via the Entity’s toll.
---
This is an easy ban and I really wish they took bans more seriously.
---
Gasp, Frank what's on your mixtape that makes everyone want to kill themselves?
---
Bro. Surveillance sucks. Read the usernames and other comments for context if you like.
---
And people wander why legion is the most hated killer
---
^^^*downvotes*
---
Lol, but yes, I agree that they are best used for posts that do not positively contribute to discussions. 
---
Non-agresssive may not have been the best word to describe my intended meaning. I moreso meant comments that were not adding to the conversation, like I mentioned a second ago. 
---
Maybe the screams of the innocent, idk XD 
---
Fucking beautiful 😂
---
I was half hoping that was a real sub
---
***THE RED ARROWS FUEL ME***
---
Adrenaline doesn't give you an extra health state.. it heals you *if you are injured* but if you become injured after the exit gates are powered it doesn't heal you or stop you from being injured... so it isn't even at all comparable to NOED. It would only compare if it gave you a literal extra health state no matter what health state you were in when the exit gates powered.
---
Hatch dropping is always cool, since you already got your pip and unless you were extra try hard - getting the double pip is not going to happen.

---
Exactly! This system should be better.
---
"Chase survivors for 3 minutes as Freddy."
---
So tunnel, easy!
---
Basically this. BBQ, Ruin, Fury, and Enduring is the best loadout for the majority of the killers.
---
When you have BBQ and Chili and Survivor pudding on with The Chef 
---
"Finally some good fucking food"
---
I think they mean perks like enduring &amp; spirit fury, you know like perks that have good synergy with each other.
---
With the exception of billy I can deal with pallets with his chainsaw which leaves room for bamboozle to stop infinite’s 
---
More than peer to peer? Hell no.
---
Ive had campers stay there though. If they are just waiting there for me to come im just going to do something else to make them leave the area. If they catch me then so be it but its worked out for me before.

okay

Why does the dog look Stoopid I'm a legion main and he takes much more skill than nurse.
---
Myers stalk with only one eye
---
Plot twist
---
That 1v1 duel of who gives up first on giving the other a “win”. 
---
How's Claudette an OP?
---
Yeah.. rank is just a number I get better teammates at green rank than at red tbh.
---
Played legion for the first time yesterday on PS4, first two games i got gen rushed instantly and badmannered at the gates by everyone both games. Third game i assume was a SWF Group, the moment i snuk up on someone who was on a gen and started frenzy rushing, they all ragequit.
---
You two should play together so you cant both be the obsession. 
---
Alternatively that’s basically a killer version of a Kobe. 
---
Why not do it to all the memes, like hit or miss and that other want to be tracer one 
---
I don't play like this because it's a waste of time. So, you're welcome.
---
But there have been times where I'm just bored with the game as a killer because of all the "balance" changes putting everything to the killers favor. So I'll rbt someone and then drop them until they're free and crouch walk behind them into a corner and watch their head pop. There's nothing they can do about it either.  It's not fun for them I'm sure but I've never gotten any hate from anyone about it either. There are some people that play this that have a dark sense of humor.
---
I think the best time that has happened that I did that to someone was when I had 2 people body blocked into a small room on "The Game." One had the rbt on and the other didn't. The timer just beeped beeped beeped until pop. I made them watch their friend die and then let the other one go free. 
---
I throw the whole match for some cheap lulz. 
---
Is Amanda the pig
---
Sadly some people would bring these in and then play immersed Claudette all game until everyone died without having any real risk or drawbacks, if assholes didn’t exist this would be kinda cool but maybe op. 
---
I’ll take that as an apology lol. You made it sound like really bad. Take my upvote. Good thing others read this.
---
I’d say 9 times out of 10, if the match hasn’t been full of teabagging and emote spam then I’ll carry the last person to the hatch. Though it kind of depends if they struggle and in that case, the relative distance of the hatch.
---
I did down somebody who struggled loose like three times before they finally got the hint. Just let me love you!
---
Hell, I just want it to be procced when somebody is hooked after all gens are completed, and goes off once an exit gate is opened. 
---
Playing against Legion #never 
---
Dance is cool btw. 
---
Sitting around doing gens all day is boring af, the whole fun part of the game is the interactions between killer and survivor. Chases is the only enjoyable part of the game. If the devs decide to make new objectives that involve more then holding a button on a gen then maybe solo survivors would be more reliable. Me personality I got 1 survivor to p3 with every perk and I just run around to get chased for as long as I can. That’s all I need to do because survivors are just skins and have no specially ability like killers that make their games interesting.
---
Comparatively to any other game, people getting angey in the endgame chat isn't really that toxic compared to other games. You can always just turn off the chat, or leave right away.
---
What they said was bad, but easily avoidable and not really as "toxic" as other games.
---
Fantastic style, I actually like the lack of legs, very well drawn.
---
Thank you very much! 
---
Usually I would laugh at the fact that you didn’t show who escaped or died but... A.) Someone raged B.) everyone pic has 6k or below C.) You have 16k D.) It’s a fucking Claud
---
It looks like Jeff and Dwight prostituting themselves for BP.  
---
Not surprised about Dweeb but disappointed that Jeff will stoop this low. 
---
...chase them out? Like its not rocket science
---
5 mins into Netflix &amp; Chill and she gives you this look
---
4th best killer? Really?
---
&gt; She has an instadown ability built into her base (unlike the Huntress which requires a very rare addon for that).
---
Its not an insta down, it can be countered incredibly easily. The survivor can just hug and object, wiggle their mouse, or just loop a pallet normally lmao. Only an insta down if the survivor just stays out in the open like an idiot
---
&gt;  She can turn the survivor's strength against her (instaheal from the fountain) into her own dangerous projectile.
---
She has to go out of her way and interrupt her patrol to gain this.
---
&gt; And she can throw said dangerous projectiles from side-to-side (which the Huntress can't do) in an arc which can go over objects, shutting down loops. All while moving at 115% speed which the Huntress can't do.
---
She can do that yup, even though it seems super inconsistant.
---
&gt; She's good in a chase because of the ability to break a survivor quickly (5 seconds of constant vomit) and down them. Should that fail, the longer you run from her, the greater the chance of you getting broken become and then M1'd. She wins either way.
---
Only bad survivors will let you get that vomit, and if you just get the broken by chasing normally you will be wasting a lot of time.
---
&gt; 
---
It's difficult to loop her so survivors attempt to stand behind pallets and objects to shield them or bait her into a stun, but that will not work against high rank killers who know how to angle themselves properly and mind-game. Stealth is your best bet and spreading out and hammering gens since she doesn't move fast enough to apply great gen pressure.
---
No, you literally cant hit them if they crouch behind a pallet. It also isnt that hard at all to loop her. 
---
&gt; spreading out and hammering gens since she doesn't move fast enough to apply great gen pressure.
---
Thats just any killer lmao
---
&gt; Unlike Myers, Huntress, and the Nurse - the corn is no good against her because of her side-to-side projectiles, and neither are windows. 
---
If your talking about the corrupt purge, fair enough. But you will barely be able to land a basic puke if they vault a window, travel time is too short.
---
She isnt top 4 at all, theres no way she beats Hag, Huntress or most people below her. I put her at around Legion.
---
Not great, I'd put her with Legion
---
A Kobe is that 4% chance of a survivor successfully getting off the hook without Deliverance or other hook escape perks. Quite a few survivors think you should honor a Kobe and give them a free escape or the hatch if they’re the last person. 
---
I don’t think so. 1940’s CIA operatives don’t usually put headgear like that on. Doc had to wear normal clothes. Maybe he put the electo-stuff on during his murder spree but the Entity gave him the Spark. I’m almost sure the Entity gave him his gear.
---
I’m certainly happy. I’m not sure if it has something to do with the new matchmaking, but something like half my lobbies when I’m trying to play Survivor lately have 290+ ping Killers.
---
Me with DMC 5. I can't help myself.
---
Honestly the word "toxic" has lost all meaning when it comes to this game. Anything you do is apparently toxic now
---
As a killer, you just stand over the downed survivor's body for a second. The survivor will more than likely be rushing to you to try to get in position for that flashlight blind/save.
---
Quite a bit of daddy issues with some of these killers now that I think about it. 
---
Thanks for the answers guys! Still a long road to go to unlock these perks
---
Am I the only meg that loops and 360’s?
---
How is spirit broken??

Things got real when the Monopoly game got real intense.

I'm guilty of that. It's not intentional though. Sometimes I'm too busy editing my perks/cosmetics that I forget to check the ping only to find out that I'm in a high ping game. It's annoying when it happens, but my fault though for not paying attention to the ping as soon as I joined. 
---
Nobody escapes death, it’s a killer hex perk, ones the exit gates are powered everyone is exposed unless the totems have all been cleansed ☺️
---
Ouch also thanks for the answer 
---
Rin didn't kill her father, it even says the entity took her after the oath was made " *The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.* " She didn't kill any1 at all in real life, and the entity rebuilds shit, thats where she got her sword, just like it rebuilds maps, thats why she can just pull it out of her hand. Its not her fathers actual Katana.
---
I must be in the minority of the playerbase but i tend to play with the mindset of if the survivors play really well i like to give the escape instead of cheesing multiple kills and if i destroy the survivors (down them all very quickly) ill give the last guy the hatch if i find it.
---
I love seeing the survivors absolutely gobsmacked that a killer respects the good survivors and doesnt get cocky cause of a quick match. Its a good feeling IMO
---
Yeah frustrating as a survivor!

No good. Some one can just take a key an escape at the start. A 4 man swf with rainbow map that tracks black locks would also be a nightmare for the killer.

I'm not convinced that most of these lag switchers aren't just people with terrible internet.

Signed a person who can't play tonight because my internet is fluctuating between 0-7mbps.

They were farming bloodpoints, they set up a bot to earn BP while afk. Its permabannable though so report report report :)

About 4/5 matches I did today was with the same afk person and it got old fast

Big yikes.

If your in a chase the timer pauses. That's why at the end I moved closer so the timer would stop.

Upvoted because shirtless myers

Dwight on RPDR serving looks!

Wait so if she is chasing you then you are able to go out the exit gate??

Is this what he does with that mixtape?

I posted earlier that this happpened to me like 5 time today, and then it happened 3 more times after my post. It’s honestly bizarre how many people are doing this
---
Legion challenge is just in my dreams :c
---
No you will get instant killed.
---
Only the hatch?
---
If there's 2 gens Ill bring them. If not they didn't earn it.
---
Only the hatch you can get out of??
---
You can escape through the hatch even if your not being chased.

Same, im always listening to music and have to repeat what two-three times to figure out what they said

Cosmetics change hair colours all the time. I.e. Best Girls Nea and Feng

Jakes 3 inches. I’m not the type of guy to make an Asian joke but...
---
honestly... If you don’t hack the game and teleport yourself onto a hook, Im reporting you rignt now
---
I do this anytime I really destroy a team, unless I end up getting everyone before they get 2 gens. If people struggle out I usually just let em go for it. However! One time someone did abuse my mercy and start working on gens when the hatch was open and so I just hooked them, that usually doesn't happen though.
---
That makes sense. I use Frank’s hoodie and I get the sense that a lot of people aren’t used to seeing it, because I’ve had a few people greet me.
---
Swiggity Swooty Killer Nea comin' for dat booty
---
Yeah but she ain't nurse or billy. 
---
Yeah it’s really annoying.
---
IMO that add-in is more for a end game type of build that would work if you paired it with Blood Warden, Unnerving Presence and the last will add-on
---
To be fair. I bought every DLC (7 on console), all of Jake and Legions cosmetics and about 20$ on Nea, Dwight, Doctor, Trapper, Kate, and Feng each. So that's like around a couple hundred lol so I better play this damn game xD
---
I’m on PS4 how do I report?
---
To be fair, Doctor was an absolute madman prior to the Entity. Guy was way into torture and electroshock shit way before his glory days. 
---
Theres a small portion of the community that defend BHVR on all sides and can't accept criticism of them.

Read their lore it should tell you what led to them being taken by the entity

Oh, right.

How is someone that stupid to just wander into some random part of the woods

You want scream? Here’s an auto DC killer.
---
Jk I fucking love legion. 
---
I dont get it, what is it with his eye? Did he lost one in the movies or something like that?
---
Honestly, no. Using ruin as much as we have has turned survivors into ruin resistant super bacteria. It doesn't slow the game down very much anymore.
---
Coordinated effort, could literally turn this into something like a 90 second game.
---
Just as a perfect storm, if two Survivors each were on one generator, it's about 60 seconds to complete both. At that point with the key with this ultra rare add-on, the hatch will spawn.
---
If they're playing with a Rainbow Map that tracks black locks and shows all Survivors the discovered objects? I mean gg I guess.
---
Killer leaves with probably 1k points. All Survivors get out with like 10k.
---
How about using these addons removes all BP for escaping and using the hatch?

Every downvote is another swf getting mori’d.
---
I did this today lol. Some prick not only teabagged me but he slso screwed his teammates cuz he led me to every pallet and dropped it the second he passed it. The last 2 were on ground so I hooked him and gave the other person hatch.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rin_Yamaoka It doesn’t specifically say what happened after she closes her eyes. The fight barely makes any sense anyways...
---
The nightmare bringing illusionary pallets would be an awesome buff to the dream world, if they got rid of healing skill checks they couldn't also bring in illusionary gens. And the gate is easily avoidable when the switch isnt intractable. But the freddy bluffs sound awesome.
---
Leppy boi is the biggest pile of shit to ever be created, and I love him.

Killer main here. I'm expecting dedicated servers to make my experience *worse*, due to the fact that I'll no longer be the server. And the fact that depending on *where* the server in my region will be the average ping might just get worse for me. 
---
I'm not saying they shouldn't add them, since it'll probably improve the game on the survivor side, but, well... Let's just say I'm not eager for the change to come. 
---
Freddys worse than huntress. Freddy raped little kids and killed them. Huntress just starved them to death iirc
---
Oh darn
---
With your logic, might as well remove DS and NOED. Got outplayed and mindgamed? Don't worry, just use DS and get out of jail free. You got looped and juked the entire game? Don't worry, NOED is here to bail you out of jail for free. 
---
Not so sure about it because those servers probably won't be near where I live and I would probably would get so much lags...
---
Mission failed, better I luck next time

\&gt;Never going to have a nice Frank-Cosplay BF dancing

I'm sorry why would a killer main prefer to have dedicated servers?

I was the claudette hiding in plain sight!
---
Yeah let me waste my time for strangers. Nah I'll kill myself, I hope you don't get out too. 
---
Exactly. Personally, I wish there was a 10% change that any given hit would insta-down. Survivors should ALWAYS fear the killer.

---
Shirtless Meyers is a thing we could all get behind 
---
I absolutely love her I might even main her
---
Naw man fuck em. If I am not being camped and they are just doing gens leaving me to die they can burn with me.
---
Was actually looking up other videos like leprechaun best moments and have it in my recommended. Now I know what I must do before bed.
---
No no no. You can only gift items to killers not other survivors. Sometimes killers need a medkit to mend their broken hearts.
---
I wish Quentin looked that good
---
But we're talking about being camped here, not NOT being camped...
---
Their choices in characters has nothing to do with server technology, at all. 
---
When?
---
Cool, I've always thought the doctor's illusions running would be sick
---
Wow. That's pretty pathetic lol. 
---
i put too much soul into the hype and it got progressively harder to breathe through the mask lmao
---
Yep. Gotta love it. 
---
impressive.
---
Precisely why I think he’s the next best option for the Entity. The game could always use a toxic leprechaun.
---
Because we get blamed and reported for a lot of shit that we don't even see happening from our perspective 
---
Burn it with fire. 
---
Haha it's funny because it you just run small game it literally tells you where totems are
---
Nothing could have prepared me for this.
---
That’s annoying 
---
Thank you !! 
---
I still really enjoy the Legion from a lore perspective. They're still the most realistic killer(s). They aren't malevolent, magical beings, they aren't serial killers. They're just some kids from a bleak little one-light town who made bad choices in life.
---
Someone show Cote. He's going to love this lol
---
Console is easier to play on
---
you're welcome. :D
---
I got like 3 sets of Survivors where 3 of them were playing Claudette and had Prestige or Legacy cosmetics.

if he sees this i will eat my own camouflage cargo pants

i fucking knew it.

Probably not tbh, especially not with the new system being implemented

If I’m dumb enough to not be able to use a fork I’m probably not smart enough to spread butter. Both are somewhat similar tasks.

Frank is a man of culture 
---
This really annoys me
---
Just so you don’t have to go dig, heres a copy and paste from my previous post on the mask:
---
First, I took a mannequin head and sculpted the base shape of the mask out of clay. Then I took plastic wrap and covered the sculpt. Next I paper Mache'd over the wrap with 8 layers. Once that dried, I took it off  (be careful) and used scissors to revise the shaping. Next, I painted over it with two layers of white acrylic paint. I sketched out the facial details in pencil and went over them with sharpie. Then I took a damp rag and mixed together Grey, Black, and Brown acrylic paints, put them on the rag, and went over the whole mask, then whiped it off to leave it looking dirtier. After that I used JDF Studios blood paint to get all the blood down. Hope that helps! :)
---
I think it's implied in the lore that there are tons more monsters and survivors than we know of, like in Cabin In The Woods. 
---
I hope people realize this is a joke and don't turn this into an anti legion circle jerk.

---
I would go over my own tier list but you would probably call me bad/a troll, and its besides the point. She definitely isnt better than Hag.
---
&gt; If it's not an instadown then I don't know what is. That 5 seconds is just a little longer than Leatherface's rev up time before he chainsaws, and sometimes people aim an iridescent head axe with Huntress longer than 5 seconds before throwing it.
---
It is not a straight insta down. She has to be able to puke for 5 seconds, like I said, then m1 the survivor, which is impossible on a loop.
---
&gt; It only takes her a few seconds to gain the corrupted purge ability. It's so fast (what, 2-3 seconds?) that it can be done mid chase (such as putting down a trap with the Hag while in a chase). I've done so in a chase, then caught right back up with the person I was chasing. I've seen other killers do it too. It's not that inconvenient. If the survivor is running toward or near a fountain, stop quickly and refuel, but if not then just catch up to the survivor and give them a dose of the regular purge then down them quickly.
---
Yeah getting the corrupt purge is quick, its the travel time to the fountains that is the problem. Being able to pop it in a chase is not likely at all.
---
&gt; If you're directly in front of a pallet and the killer is directly in front of the pallet it's going to be hard to hit the survivor with regular or corrupted purge. But if you walk to the side of a pallet and aim your purge more in a horizontal pattern then it's possible to hit them at an angle. If that doesn't work, you juke left or right to get the survivor to move/stand up just a little then you hit them. If the Plague has corrupted vile this is an even worse strategy as survivor because if you budge just a bit from a superior position and fall for any type of juke move, the killer and swing their purge all over and around that pallet and nail you. It's especially bad in the killer shack around the god-pallet as the killer can hit you through the window if you stay near that pallet. Pallets are strong against her, but not fire-proof.
---
All of this stuff Huntress can do naturally and doesnt have a timer on her hatchets. If you have vile purge and you bait the survivor into standing up you will only get half a second of puke, which doesn do anything AND gives you a slowdown. Sure it might not work against corrupt purge, but I've given an explanation as to why I dont like it before.
---
&gt; Not quite, there are killers that are able to exert a lot of gen pressure and it won't really matter how well you try to not to 3-gen yourself. Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Hag all have great built-in gen pressure abilities. Even the Wraith with the right player can be hell. She's fast, but not speedy. Her strength is being a great chaser and getting quick downs, forcing survivors to leave gens and constantly rescue/heal.
---
Sure those killers might exert more pressure, but the strategy to dealing with them is the same. Rush gens. Plague is a ehhh chaser, better than a normal m1 killer, and a much better chaser than fucking clown lmao
---
&gt; Yes I was speaking of her corrupted purge specifically on that one, but her regular purge will also nail you through the corn or windows. It's just that it will just be a splash and will require two or more directly hits to get you into broken if you keep going through windows on a map such as Lerys where many windows are near each other. If she has the addon which moderately increases her regular purge's effectiveness then jumping through windows will get you broken in 10 seconds instead of 5, as it just takes 75% of a full purge to get you into the broken state. And that addon stacks I believe. It's crazy good.
---
You have to land A LOT of puke to get them into broken. We shouldn't be including addons in the argument also, as otherwise you should put Legion at A tier in your list bc Franks/Joeys mix tape and Cold Dirt exists.
---
&gt; Our motions may vary on this one. I think she's a really good killer. As you can see on my tier list I'm of the opinion that Myers is better than Hag, and the Hag is better than Huntress. An irredesent-head Huntress beats both of them, but other than that I don't place the Huntress above them since Myers' one-hit ability and stealth, plus the Hag's map pressure and ability to be everywhere her trap is are things I value more than the Huntress' long range capabilities. I rank the Plague just above Myers because there are few maps that I feel will give her a problem (and like I said, Mount Osmund is the only one in my own experience that has given me trouble). She's going to be the more versatile of the two, and her corrupted purge power gives her another edge. She's a combination of Leatherface and the Huntress. She's going to be very strong. Very very strong. Unless the Devs nerf her.
---
Myers is in no way better than Hag. Hag has so much more map control, pressure and chase potential with Myers, and has almost equal snowball if her traps are placed right (she can bounce around the map like a pinball). Hag is a lot like Freddy, people underrate them because 99% of people who play them play like shit (Hags placing 10 traps around the hook, Freddys tunneling with double blocks and NOED). I personally agree with you that Mike is better than Huntress as well, Huntress gets cucked by certain maps more than mike does. 
---
&gt; Mount Osmund is the only one in my own experience that has given me trouble
---
Ormond is terrible for everyone lmao, its almost as bad as Haddonfield.
---
&gt; She's going to be very strong. Very very strong. Unless the Devs nerf her.
---
Wouldn't be surprised
---
Listen I dont think she is dog shit, I think she has potential. Her sickness just doesnt do enough and her corrupt purge is just too hard to get imo.
---
I 180’d a killer twice in a row (can’t 360 I’m garbage ik) and he facecamped me then called me toxic garbage after I escaped cause of borrow time and friendly hit-taking survivors
---
What? No it’s not
---
That’s why firecrackers are superior, they can’t hear you running ;)
---
2k hours here - Most veterans players have known this for quite some time and it is the reason survivors are slowly but surely getting the nerfs they need. Yet somehow, you have people who genuinely believe that killers are OP. 
---
When all veterans are in a match even against a VERY good killer simple math says that the survivors are going to shit on your family if they play efficiently since both sides are running the tiles in the most efficient manner possible 95% of the time.
---
However, the problem is this is a casual game first and foremost and if they were to truly balance this game then killers would almost never lose in low tier play. This is not good either for the games health.
---
The dev's best bet is to reduce the difference between SWF (as they tend to play the game in a efficient manner more often) and solo play so as to get more games that play out in an efficient manner. With the real balance of the game revealed the devs can safely make changes that won't devastate the majority of the playerbase's gameplay.
---
Make no mistake - the game at the HIGHEST level will always be survivor sided as they do not have a successful product without it. However as a killer if you are good you should still win 95+% of your matches simply because people are bad.
---
If you play survivor, you need to accept that your team should win and when you lose it is YOUR team's fault. Full-stop. You could have played much better as math says it is your game to lose.
---
Who needs therapists when this exists
---
You can trash talk them on this subreddit yeah
---
Sue them idk fam you might have trouble backing your point
---
I would disagree, the whole point of local host is to save their (bhvr) own computing resources and so that local networks enjoy the best connection. So no, people in North Russia are having good ping just as everyone else (but of course, probably rarer than us in NA or EU because of fewer active players). But my point is the difference between having the possibility vs impossibility to even have a green ping. There are a few other things associated with this but i wont go into detail here.
---
And yes, BHVR fucking things up is a valid argument. It is a sign of incompetent management / programmers incapable of delivering high quality products. Sure, bugs always exist in a program. But this isn't just about bug. You cant deliver a products with super obvious flaws and say "Oops, just a bug".
---
And to address your last point. I dont think majority of people want dedicate servers solely because of ping jump. They are thinking that dedicate servers will magically solve all of their connections issue. And it wont.
---
Oh dear. I've seen people run the build 100% meme and chase other survivors only carrying someone.
---
Your plans are much less memey lol.
---
it feels like some people don't realize that historically, Russian females are tiny and very feminine. 
---
i, a Russian Jew(Russian is nationality, not bloodline), being 170(5"7) feel like a damn ogre in Moscow. all females are shorter than i am and their features and bodies are more feminine than mine. 
---
does Evan absolutely have to be such a hottie? D:
---
Not to toot my own horn here but I do this if I feel it was a good game overall. But there's a catch, I down them, pick em up, walk to a hook, pause, then bring them to the hatch. It's all about asserting dominance. My own little checkmate.
---
Hillbilly easiest killer in the game
---
Console is easier
---
Yeah ok mate 
---
Actually the devs gave him a first name max
---
i think thats just death metal
---
If you're good at nurse and Billy then you don't need it on them but everyone else you need it 
---
Prove me wrong. I’ll wait 
---
They should be all around the world. I exaggerated shit up to a certain extent. But yes, people in areas that are far away from wherever their server might be will suffer.
---
When I played dota from Vietnam with just an average ISP back in around 2012, ping never dropped below 200. And that was Valve's server. Imagine a company much smaller ...
---
Oh god please get rid of him mcote 
---
She can now run faster than a fat guy walking at a mild pace
---
Oh definitely, that’s a definite yuck, but I’m honestly just gonna take the happiness of them finally coming out.
---
i get better teammates after all the bad ones DC :D... why i refuse to play rank 1 anymore 
---
No need to wait.
---
Hillbilly might not be hard, but here's a list of killers that pretty much no one would try to argue that they're way easier than Billy:
---
Trapper
---
Legion
---
Pig
---
All of these killers require little to no skill when compared to billy, who needs to hit his chainsaw which mind you 1.isnt the easiest thing to do with survivors 360ing all over the place and 2.is extra hard with console frame drops and lag. Hillbilly isn't super hard to use, but saying he's the easiest killer to use in the game is just silly when you have killers like legion where you don't even need to do anything other than cheese game mechanics 
---
As for console, I have no clue what led you to the conclusion that console is easier. Frame drops like crazy, bad ping even if you have good connection and if you walk in corn your game turns retarded. Not to mention using a controller is way harder than mouse and keyboard. 360ing is also super easy to do because of the combination of frames dropping and controllers being harder to use. Have any idea why no streamer or youtuber plays dbd on console? Take a wild guess. 
---
This is just adorable. I love it
---
All the hooks are on a different map, there is no basement.
---
What would be the point of the perk then I'd it only lasts like 10 seconds?
---
Eh it’s just a classic lovecraftian creature. Ancient and incomprehensible, usually contact drives one to insanity. 
---
Now how do we make camping do away? 
---
I thought the Max Jr. thing was non-canon for the sake of the wiki. Could be wrong though. 
---
smell ma breath
---
ok
---
What does SWF mean? 
---
Surviving With Friends?
---
Alright, I'll wait for a few more replies, but thank you for the advice, chalk one up for getting it!
---
i think most perks are in a pretty good state at the minute, but something needs to be done about territorial imperative and sole survivor imo. i think i’d prefer if territorial imperative worked a bit more like iron maiden? and sole survivor is just useless if you arent running it w object of obsession

---
Why have you done this
---
My only thing as a killer is if I find the hatch and the survivor is nowhere near it I'm gonna roam the map looking for them. I absolutely hate killers who stand on or around the hatch and wanna play the 'lets dance for 5 min till someone screws up game'. If you reach it before I find you then you win, but if I find you while you're looking for it then I win.
---
Where does all this lore come from? The only time I see it is in killer descriptions
---
Hag is easily top 5... have you played the game at all in the past 9 months?
---
8 200-500ms Ping Lobbies per 1 100-150ms ping lobbies.  35-60ms Ping lobbies are 1 in 16.  
---
The only good part about this is if BHVR fixes hitboxes, I'll be so used to lag hits, hits through pallets, hits through windows from miles away, that I'll feel the fixes are over the top.  Heh.
---
(on a side note.. first green game of the night get a P3 Doc that was tapping Punishment in Treatment mode to get around faster.  Biggest sweatlord I've seen in this game for a long time, myself excluded.)

I try to post things daily and keep the subreddit alive so it can thrive on its own at some point and let other people post to it.

I actually have been playing without Ruin this past week. I usually 4k still, they all just die with 1 gen to go. Sloppy Butcher helps to slow things down, and it nice to have all 4 perks last through the whole match.
---
You don't assign roles like that in this game. Just use whatever the fuck you want.

Drastically reduced her setting time and buffed all of her addons while also removing all downsides to each of them aside from the ultra rares.
---
nah man, i regularly play for honor and it doesnt come close to all the salt generated by DBD.
---
DS is actually still affected by Enduring.
---
It's definitely a huge nerf to DS.
---
I also forgot Tribal Wraith since he's African decedent oofs
---
I wasnt, but you mentioned that they "made the game miserable" for you. How so? Got lopped? Blinded? Outplayed? There's no possible way that survivors can "make a game miserable" for a killer other than being GOOD. So, essentially a 4man premade shit on you so hard that it gave you a miserable experience? So you "get back at them" by dcing and wasting offering?
---
You're a fuckin loser dude LOL.
---
I might have to try that perk loadout
---
I like sloppy butcher a lot as well. It kinda dreads me when I play survivor to see others just heal themselves and not do gens.. the point is to get out ; we waste so much time bc of this (I run adrenaline, empathy, lightweight and quick&amp;quiet)
---
Again I disagree because they're very different in nature. Three gen doc makes the match last forever but eventually someone will win. Legion (being played as most people currently play them) makes the game end way too fast for one player and gives said player little to no counterplay.
---
Legion being played as intended (chaining FF) is no worse than playing against Doc, imo. Doc makes you snap out of it Legion makes you mend. I'd honestly prefer playing against a "fair" Legion who's using their power "as intended" as opposed to a Doctor running Order along with either Calm or Obedience.
---
Why would you report them?
---
Relatable af
---
Though his eye already looks fucky on the original movie. Not sure if intentional or just the actors face though.

I bring all survivors to 40 first then pick a single survivor to main. This way you have all teachables

Same. He’s more white or at least tan. Also, Evan has a much more square jaw. Otherwise, all spot on.

You think. . . you think somebody would really do that? Just get on the Internet and tell lies?

 That's a dead ringer for Katy Perry.

Wow I’m sorry this question seems to be so awful. Listen, he has a high number of followers with few trophies and I’ve heard this dude has to get new usernames all the time so THATS WHY I ASKED for other opinions. Geez. 🙄

so if your group isn't coordinated and they all leave your ass with a trap on your head, your only option is to get chased until the pig finally kills your ass, or hope the pig doesn't camp the jigsaw stations with your loud ass beeping.
---
Where did the whole "Doctor is black" thing come from? Was it mentioned in any of his bios? I thought his skin is black because the motherfucker is charred and burnt, it never once crossed my mind that he's black.
---
Apologies, all I know about this guy I read about here so I thought this would be the appropriate place to ask. 
---
Being born deformed is not self-inflicted
---
I didn’t mean to sound confrontational  I’m sorry omg 😭 
---
Nope?
---
Search cursed cat
---
As the killer, this is EXACTLY what I want you to do if I camp.
---
Oh thats awesome! Persistence is key to perfection so keep practicing! 
---
For me I was just hugely discouraged by how much I struggled to even land a proper blink. I would hold my M2 down and then it would make me blink a small distance and i'd be instantly fatigued? I was so confused.
---
Honest mistake, I'm sure. In the future, you can do exactly this, but censor the username.
---
 If anyone asks the name, I think you can PM them that, as long as you're not just trying to start trouble for anyone to see.
---
Yeah it is now/will be according to q&amp;a. I don’t think it was during ptb, That actually kinda shitty and they should up the stun to 5 seconds and/or give a burst of speed IMO,
---
Given he had already been stabbed three times, all we can hope for that he was already dead before it was Susie's turn.
---
Then she simply desecrated a body. No killing at all :)

The fucky look was because of Lauries stab.

---
I pick and choose who to level based on perks i want. Furst I wamted ds because i get downed a lot then i wanted claudettes self heal and next ill do meg for sprint burst. I haven't really bpught cosmetics for them. 
---
Why? That'd basically be a built-in Sprint Burst. And 5 seconds is *way* too long, to boot. DS will be situational, it's just the way things go that the stun happens to be lessened by Enduring.
---
So, maybe he didn't wamt to get a lot more done, maybe he only wanted this one guy dead and was alright with everyone else escaping
---
A small part of me is starting to think it could eventually become more useful than the original version. Killers tunnel the unhooked survivor 90% of the time, and given that it can no longer be dribbled, it has insane potential. Deliverance + DS sounds so good. Hell, DS alone is gonna be the ultimate counter to end game facecamping/tunneling when the gates are open
---
How would you know?
---
I mean it's what happens to me. If I play pig though people usually don't have a trap on late game they tend to get them off before then so they don't die. Go main pig for a week then come back and tell me it's fair to use the hatch with a trap. 
---
I did cuz the rework version interests me a lot more then the one we have currently
---
The trick is to just find the rhythm, it's all about practice.  I can barely do it on 100+ ping though, you just straighten up instantly.
---
Wannabe 
---
I'd rather he get behind me
---
I went through a few survivors until I found my main. After finding my main I have a second survivor who I tend to use all my offerings on to gain bloodpoints because I feel like I'm extra losing if I do a bad game with my main and the offering goes to waste. 
---
As for cosmetics I don't like buying them at all and rather like to work for them.
---
It wasn’t directed at the shrine, rather BHVR themselves.
---
don't forget she's 16 at the oldest
---
If you crouch behind a rock and don’t do anything while I’m on the hook then I’m killing myself. If I see my team doing objectives I’ll wait a while longer.
---
She seems to also be heavily based on the Wendigo, an Algonquin myth, which would more closely relate her to Native Americans.
---
Technically, Philip was still killing people, he just didn't know
---
I've been playing this game close to 1K hours and never have I ever thought about reading the lore. Should I?
---
Seems really interesting tbh.
---
Can someone tell me the video? I DC'd before it played
---
I suppose you could. which is basically the same logic of waiting for everyone to leave? 
---
[Evan MacMillan](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Evan_MacMillan) is the Trapper, [Max Thompson Jr.](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hillbilly) is the Hillbilly.
---
I think the monstrous shrine is a great idea hook people in the kill room but its useless. Effectively making the kill room kind of pointless as well. 
---
These are great! Excellent work.
---
I’m not a huge fan of Michaels depiction considering he’s never been unmasked and looks exactly the same throughout all his movies as he does in the game. 
---
But really, I love how Sally looks overworked and stressed, her work really wearing her down. I love how innocent. Rin and Lisa look innocent which is perfect considering their backstories. Freddy and Amanda actually really resemble their movie counterparts (the Freddy in the game is based on the remake and not the original. 
---
This is really great. 
---
A year later I came back and saw this meme. So it didn't change much huh.
---
This makes me hate Legion even more, thanks

You know the saying “make your hobby your career and then you will be truly happy” or however it goes? I’m sure the doc was having the time of his life
---
Dbd wiki probs has tips and same for youtube. My tip would be to look up/down to shorten/lengthen your blink alongside charging— if you charge too long and the surv runs at you looking down will help close that gap. 
---
With that said be careful around multi-level areas as you will blink to other floors. Nurse is like 99% practice to get a feel for blink lengths and stuff before going into different addon paths and how they impact the aforementioned (ie more charges greater distance faster charge rate). 
---
Granted, the Entity could have been whispering to him for a while slowly driving him insane.

this is the big good

I’ve never been more mad that someone didn’t draw Micheal with the long hair he deserves.

Sliding scale resolution on PC that doesn't seem to actually change much. I can probably tweak it through the NVIDIA panel but that will mess with the whole system

First thing I tried. Thought it might be a fix available through the coding like the was with the FPS unlock but so far I haven't found anything

Most people who want the servers don't think about the results for more than 2 seconds.

You're gonna have a blast trynna play killer with over 30 ping.

who would win? Artwork that took hours of care to make? Or one shitpostie boye 
---
I dropped someone on the hatch and got complains for being a toxic tryhard
---
I only play killer.  Wouldn't this like... not affect me at all?
---
Oh shit. Ok sir you changed my mind
---
when they just wanna give back his sketchbook too : (
---
Until BHVR gives incentives to the person being camped, unforch most will DC. 
---
Transfer the BP from the Camper to the Camped player and show it on screen. Then it'd discourage  camper especially if the loss is severe. It'd also give the camped person to stay to get free BP. 
---
As long as there's no punishment for campers, even the proxy ones, no one will stay around to be camped to death. 
---
Thanks! I kind of see it? The curly hair and stuff but idk all the other depictions seem pretty accurate to the characters moods and stuff but ... let’s be honest, Michael Myers would never be winking and smiling all cutesy like that. A handful of the killers weren’t evil before the entity took them, like Lisa, and it shows in their drawing. But Michael was evil since childhood so it’s hard for me to see it.
---
Again, I think it’s because he’s always been so imposing to me. I think I saw the first Halloween when I was like 7 or 8 and he scared the shit out of me. It’s funny because I love playing against him in the game. 
---
I do think these drawings are really well done though. My favorites are Sally and Evan. 
---
I started playing Legion because I have no shame.   
---
Those legion games (about 10?) were one of the most fun killer games I've had. Maybe it was because the matchmaking was good, maybe I was just lucky.   
---
Thing is, the survivors seem to have a lot of fun too, even if they had been sacrified. I realized that in most of the games, the dead survivors had spectated the game, and in the post game chat, many were dropping "gg wp", and even "that was a fun game" a few times. No one was toxic, no one called me names, I only had one DC, and there were very possitive vibes. Very refreshing.
---
I changed my struggle to F. (F for respect) It's just much better. It doesn't feel like my arm is gonna fall off
---
His height makes it a serious issue but I'm still not opposed to it
---
But people get temporary ban if they do it too much which then leads to a permanent ban
---
I'm in EU, and I've been getting a lot of Asian/Brazil lobbies.
---
Hell yeah it would work best if it injured them as well. So if they try twice you can knock them to the ground. That and most people who farm like that are already injuried and just unhook during chase for a distraction. 
---
Point wise a kick with the killer within 30feet gives survival points.
---
Outside of 30ft lose some altruism.
---
Jeff looking like he's gonna join the legion and kill everyone
---
Did you realize mid gane they were potatoes.
---
Spirit: Got your nose
---
Jake: You're not supposed to actually grab my nose
---
Spirit: What? That doesn't make any sense
---
Game settings file you can set your resolution. Otherwise, it'll use your desktop resolution. 
---
It’s interesting but some of it’s pretty nonsensical (I still like reading it though)
---
Except the game is balanced around survivors not having voice comms.  SWF + discord exists, so that more than cancels out any advantage killers would get from hosting.  Being able to strategize live with 3 other players and get info from 4 different points of view at any given time is immensely huge, especially when things like hexes come into play.  If I chase a survivor past one of my hexes, I can pretty much assume that every single other person in the game now knows where my hex is...  That's pretty fucked.
---
Since they changed the matchmaking, we are forced to wait much longer and end up joining red ping lobby. I just don’t understand why the devs think this is alright.
---
I like em bloody, I like em invisible.
---
Ugh these are amaaaaaaazing. Lisa, Amanda and Rin are fantaaaaaaaaastic
---
It's not good enough to deter them.
---
Most importantly, it doesn't provide incentives for the hooked person to keep struggling. 
---
I’m not talking about that though, I’m talking about low level games or games where the survivors aren’t tryharding  even if they are 4 stack swf. Even if it’s in a situation like you’re painting, being hit through a window you’re very far through or hitting the pallet stun to somehow get hit feels like garbage and sucks ass. 
---
Was where are our favorite chainsaw bros are they too ugly to be here
---
I would love to see Ghostface as a killer. He's been one of my favorite killers for years!
---
r/dbd_irl
---
Both camping killers and people who kill themselves on hook have one thing in common. They are sore losers. 
---
The camping killer intentionally loses the game for one kill bit only if the survivor being camped stays there there the whole time. 
---
In short the camping killers will stop camping if they dont pip. So if the hooked survivor allows the team to win you'll see less camping. 
---
Stop complaining and run small game
---
I want them to give Survivors an ultra rare offering that negates the killers offering. Just give us a counter to Moris.
---
That's actually pretty stupid. It's way better to leave the basement and hide somewhere nearby.

*Survive With Friends Animator*
---
Some killer perks are very strong and balanced around the fact that the killer loses their perk if survivors destroy the totem "powering" it. These perks are called Hexes. If you see a lit totem, it means the killer has a Hex and you should probably destroy the totem. I would look up a list of Hexes so you have some idea of what they do. Sometimes you will be affected by the Hex before you see the totem, in which case you may want to seek out the totem. 
---
There are two Hexes that behave differently than the others; No One Escapes Death (NOED) and Haunted Grounds. NOED doesn't appear at the start of the game, it only powers a totem once all the generators are complete to make the killer incredibly dangerous until the totem is destroyed or everyone escapes/dies. Haunted Grounds is a "fake" Hex, it powers a totem but it doesn't actually do anything until someone destroys it, 
---
Tikled a good laugh out of me.

Uhhhhh, that is not how it works, my friend. Not at all :( I dont assume that "all computations are handled by the Killers PC". I KNOW for a fact that it is the case. I can give you hard evidence here but doing so would violate the rules of this subreddit. If you want, you can private message me and i can tell you why you are 99% wrong. You can easily verify this by yourself if you capture your own outgoing connection.
---
Why I left that 1% because in some sense, you are right. Of course at one outlet, the client will eventually have to communicate with their database. But no, the server they are having is nowhere near capable of handling real game data packets. The server they have is like the person controlling the scoreboard in a soccer game. And the killer's pc is the ref. The ref tells that operator what to put on the scoreboard and that is where all the hard work comes from. That operator guy does nearly NOTHING.
---
TLDR: I dont assume, I know for a fact that all computation are in killer's pc
---
Except that screws over the Killer during the one time they *should* be camping, when the gates are open and they have someone on the hook.
---
At last, our battle will be legendary
---
Except it can be because you DC that people don't get out?
---
ew, you bought Legion's cosmetics
---
"Outnumber the killer" wait what, that isn't an advantage. That is a basic game mechanic.
---
I have the sudden urge to stab you with scissors. 
---
I'll always get 1 survivor to the hatch if there's a DC
---
I can't see the improvement, I can't understand how it is possible that the matchmaking system keeps putting people with +1000hrs against people playing their first match. 
---
My most recent exemple is that I played a match with two new players (they literally bought the game yesterday) and went against a LEGACY KILLER. I must say I have less than 200hrs myself. 
---
Are you trying to make the new players quit forever or something?
---
Hellraiser would be amazing. Pinhead and the cenobites.
---
If you want to get to rank 1 killer: Nurse, Billy, Spirit, or surprisingly Hag.
---
If you want to have fun: Any killer besides Freddy and Legion. Just don't expect 4ks all the time. When you get better, you'll definitely get 3ks consistently. Highly recommend Trapper though. Very fun to trap unsuspecting noobs.

Mlga dodging that shit. Or gonna stand on a rock until you d/c
---
Two exhaustion perks?
---
Why????
---
Squad With Friends but you got the idea
---
Except Legion is still slow even with NoED.
---
A lot of people think that NoED is only strong because of 1 hit downs, and that's not entirely true. However, that speed boost is a lot bigger than most people think since it gives them 120% move speed and they have an easier time catching up to you while you loop them. Legion, with NoED, moves at the standard 115% movespeed of most killers, so even when he gets his Sanic on he's only as fast as anyone else. He's still not catching many people with it.
---
No, if you want to use an endgame perk as Legion, use Remember Me. It's ridiculously easy to charge on them, it keeps people in the game longer, and it doesn't actively clash with your power.
---
They hated him, for he spoke the truth
---
Feng mains....UNITE
---
It wouldn't effect perks. Just an offering that negates the killers offering. They'll never do it because it'd be horribly imbalanced and honestly unfair to killers because it could eat Puddings and Streamers but... I just want Moris removed.
---
Had a Bill struggle off me when I was bringing him to hatch and he immersed himself for about 5 minutes before I finally found and killed him. Never again, it's not worth the risk. You struggle, you die.
---
Jeepers Creepers will probably never happen
---
I always let Feng min live lol
---
It’s worse on console D:
---
Honestly this, before I even noticed DBD reddit I always commented to my friends about Nea being like a secret plot killer.
---
Soon I will never see Dwights ~~warp out of existence~~ going to Narnia
---
When I do play pig i use bear traps late game to buy more time to down/hook. If you haven't gotten any kills and last survivor gets hatch escape that's entirely your own fault for being too slow or wasting too much time tunneling a survivor that's outplaying you.
---
Well isn't that helpful against the worst Legions that can't find anyone after frenzy ends.
---
Yeah sadly and its depressing
---
Ill be celebrating when they're *actually* working and not the guaranteed mess they'll be in the first few months.
---
I don't know why everyone hated the legion tho. 
---
when?
---
Hell Yha, now no 200,000 ping killers in my DBD lobby. And no quitting when the odd sfw join.
---
Fuck man, figure yourself out.
---
Yea, they're keeping this game open. With this, they could make more interesting killers. 
---
What?
---
Who says it wasn't? You can't change something like that overnight, especially if it has to work properly.
---
She seems decent enough. I'm just wondering about her map pressure.

What don't you like about her?
---
Well, it doesn't explicitly say in her lore that she killed him, but it heavily implied by her taking an oath and the entity entering her mind that he died one way or another, possibly in a 'vengeful SPIRIT'-type way
---
Upvote the post if you know what this is from
---
At rank 1 matches don’t last very long as-is, with either the survivors being able to finish most of the gens relatively quickly if they don’t all stop to look for ruin. 
---
Or, alternatively, the killer is able to down them quickly and make quick work of the game.
---
Why exactly, when the games are already so short and the rank system is becoming much harder (requiring more investment in metals), would anyone want the game to be over faster?
---
Without we’re gonna live forever you’re looking at a fat 25K BP on average for getting out alive as survivor, and that’s with a decent match. The idea of speeding up games even more is just silly imo. 
---
It doesn't have to. They can add condition to lessen penalty once gates are powered. 
---
Yup. I’m Aussie and devs are notoripus for neglecting us with dedicated servers. Could make the game unplayable for us 
---
Gayyyy
---
Chucky will be called The Strangler, if they ever get him in the game. This summer new chucky movie arrives, we Can hope ;-)
---
Its marked shitpost for a reason
---
The (creator?) of that series was busted with child pornography or something of the sort.
---
If BHVR wanted JC in their game, they’d have to pay that foul man since it would be licensed, and I really can’t see any scenario where they’d do that.
---
Because they prefer a more balanced and fair infrastructure?
---
I mean, yeah, you can be like "FUCK EVERYONE BUT ME" about it, but why would you?
---
Oh yes indeed.
---
It's Trapper. Unless they are noob, there's no need for him to camp. 
---
Up to a point. No one enjoys waiting an hour for a match, either.
---
I didn't mean that the Killer doesn't do anything but act as a relay between the Survivors and servers. I realise that a lot is done Killer-side.
---
What I failed to communicate effectively is that Killers do have to connect to servers in some capactiy. After all, nothing about one's DBD account is saved client-side; so to access this data, one must maintain a connection to the servers at all times.
---
This increases latency. Thus, I believe the ping displayed to you by the game (when you play Survivor) may simply be a measure of latency between you and the Killer, but doesn't account for the Killer's latency with the servers.
---
Thanks Kanaya.
---
Goes on sale pretty regularly. I'd expect another one when (or shortly after) the Plague goes live.
---
Horrible taste.
---
Also dark souls has a thriving community that's far from dead
---
Extension of tip two: If faced with a camping Killer, immediately split up and each take a generator. If the Killer has not left by the time those start popping, coordinate a location to meet up for the 4th. The Killer **should** get the message when he sees 3 gens pop off in quick succession. If he leaves hook at this point, either have one person break off and go in for the save when he's far enough away, or wait for him to find you and break off in different directions. The Survivor he's chasing should lead him away from the hook, ideally looping for as long as possible.
---
The other two can either coordinate a save (running interference in case the Killer breaks off the chase, and healing if the third continues to loop) or have one go in for the save while the other runs off in a different direction and makes a ton of noise to serve as an additional distraction.
---
yep, played nearly for a n hour after a long break. guess what happened? lagswitched by a pig that got run around for 5 gens and poor guy couldnt handle the defeat. Went back to apex anyways
---
I feel like that's obvious, man. Is that not obvious? I don't play Legion, but I don't condone joking about this shit.
---
Oh yeah, that remaster really helped when it killed the PC community. Go on.
---
I expected something which effects hatch standoffs
---
The thing with the Plague is that she varies a lot depending on how you play her and her add-ons. Plus, I just think many players haven't quite found out yet how to play her properly. She's definitely nasty in the right hands. This might be hard to swallow, but I think she can come close to S-Tier.
---
Such a troll lmao
---
Idk, if I sit in lobbies with 300+Ping for fun :) it never starts because people constantly leave! 
---
we're often 3 swf aswell because it's a meme to play with hight ping :) but it takes soo long before anyone else stais and redies up, then they sometimes just end up leaving ingame, but at least we get our meme game :)
---
Mike Tyson new killer confirmed
---
Why would you chase at all when you can stand still in front of a hooked guy with your chainsaw revved up
---
TBH it won't happen since 4 survivors = 4 chances to burn this = WAY less chance for killers to use any offerings at all.
---
I agree that Moris still need to be fixed, but this would just create more problems.
---
When you mori last survivor on hatch as a legion
---
&gt;  I'd honestly prefer playing against a "fair" Legion who's using their power "as intended" as opposed to a Doctor running Order along with either Calm or Obedience.
---
Probably because Doctor will be way more effective at actually killing people xd
---
The problem with Legion is not just that when played "wrong" he's overpowered with no counterplay, it's also the fact that when played "right" he's not that great. Definitely way below the Doc, in both tracking and chasing. 
---
Level hag to level 35 for ruin and Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chilli. These two perks are currently meta, Ruin making survivors take longer to complete gens (usually, and BBQ gives you good aura information whenever you hook someone, as well as giving you a +25% bp increase for each freshly hooked survivor (basically WGLF in killer form). After that it's up to you to find what youblike and what works best for you.
---
I would recommend Pig the most, as she is a very balanced killer that's also enjoyable. You can TBag survivors with her as well, albeit very slowly-
---
Can confirm
---
When I get camped peolple rush to try and save me. When I don't get camped none fucking saves and if they do they go slow as fuck and crouch around when the killer is on the other side of the map
---
You do understand you are feeding the troll, right?
---
Dedicated servers won't help with this. If someone has really bad ping in general they're still going to have really bad ping. It'll help smooth things out a bit for sure, but it'll just make it like any other game where people have lag.
---
SunDadSolaire! Also the Ds1 remaster was a joke, but check the Ds3 subreddit, we're a thriving community!
---
&gt;(creator?)
---
I think that's right? I think he wrote the script and everything and then directed it.
---
Yo, separate to whatever bullshit we're on in this bit, I'm actually on there too. Any challenge runs you've done? I beat it without ever equipping a weapon or using items other than Estus, and haven't had the heart to go back. Fucking hellish, honestly.
---
I'm not sure if she'll ever be S tier, but I think that she's a LOT better than people are expecting. Corrupted Blood is literally the best ability in the game, it's just that it's not "always up" that holds her back.
---
But the reason I don't think she'll be top 3 is that she just doesn't have the map mobility that Nurse, Billy, and Spirit have, so it's a lot harder to keep map pressure up.
---
I taught that was his special ability.
---
Missed opportunity to edit in mist vial for bottle.
---
Parental issues are the staple of an unpredictably dangerous mind.
---
Omg please I'm begging you
---
“I use BBQ for points” also “I camp” 
---
Yes, but killers with bad ping can now play witouth waiting 100 years for a lobby, the question is how they will make the actuall game corolate to what the players see and do, the main thing is just to get rid of lag switching and as a survivor you won't randomly teleport in the open while you tried hiding behind a rock ect. I see a lot of ptential flaws and bennefits, but it all depends on how the devs change the game for dedicated servers. if they would just slap it on witouth doing anything it'll be really bad, but they've said it's been in the works for a while so I don't think so. 
---
Any killer leads you to rank 1.
---
*Hit 4 survivors with haunting as the spirit*
---
Oh free bloodpoints!
---
I’ve never played her but I don’t think a killer but no mobility can ever reach S-tier
---
So?
---
Because the plague is cooler? 
---
If you can escape him, stop and you'll be able to mend, which gets rid of the bleed out timer, as for escaping him before that, you've just got to get to a point where you can hide 
---
DBD's almost calming in a way. Routine enough to be therapeutic with just enough variables in each match to stay fun and exciting. Though I do wish we had one or two other play modes.
---
Nah you're not dumb. Longer matches are definitely more enjoyable, I think most will agree. My most enjoyable matches are when the killer doesnt tunnel or camp and puts a lot of pressure on us to be able to do the objective. I just wish they would find a fix to the issue instead of nerfing survivors every patch.
---
FREDDY REWORK PLS 
---
Really? Maybe that should be explained in the game somewhere...
---
When survivors have bad ping they tend to teleport on your screen even when you're killer. I'd prefer this from stop happening though I'd agree it's usually more of the matchmaking issue
---
I didnt realize 128m was pretty much infinite. Glad to hear that.

Do people who use mouse wheel not use their index finger for struggling or something? Maybe I just have busted hands but I feel like it'd be uncomfortable to quickly scroll for that long without one of those infinite-scroll mice.

Whats the price of a DLC with a sale? 
---
The meme is almost outdated tho
---
My net just straight up died for good 30 seconds, I didn't realized it and just killed one person, the chat was not nice to say the least after the game.
---
Honestly the fun really came from all the frustration leading up to completion, most of the bosses kick your ass and it feels so good finally killing them after so many failed attempts. Sence though I've taken a break from the challenge runs cause of how hard they were.
---
Ok that's my new avatar thanks
---
That makes sense, yeah. Any thoughts on the change to whips in DS3? I had a great half a playthrough with them, since you can plan your swings through walls, but your combos and overall damage suck.
---
Knowing bhvr they realese servers this month, game will become playable around summer 2020.
---
Usually around 4-5 bucks from what I've experienced 
---
So this is what's inside Frank's Mixtape.
---
Do auric cells go on sale? 
---
If I see some nice teamplay without beeing toxic, I usually drop the last one on the hatch...
---
So I had to relook up hatch rules. The offering is still way to strong. 4 man would get a escape at two gens left. This would make games very fast. Or would give the “doin gens you” Claudette the hatch at five gens.
---
idk i play on ps4 and i can't fail ruin skillchecks
---
Everyone when you bait dead hard: thats ILLEGAL IN ALL CAPS
---
I leveled all killers and survivors to 50.  Then started p1, p2, and p3 of the ones that had the least amount of perks that I liked once they hit 50 again.  Sometimes it was out of order, sometimes I stuck with one until they were p3.  It is very spontaneous for how I spend bpts, I usually also save between 500k and 800k before I spend them also. 
---
For cosmetics, i bought $20 worth of cells for my favorites when they first released. I have spent a few shards on them, and have saved 25k shards.  I spread out the cosmetics pretty evenly where I can. 
---
Accurate.
---
I have the hardest time being scared of the Pig when she's eating pallets. How do I get right with God?

No.

I feel offended by this because I can testify Jake has at least 7 
---
I know it's not the intent, but the way this is done makes it look like hes using traps to get a date.
---
You are going insane.  You use Tik Tok.
---
Indeed he does. He also has the ability to enlarge a woman’s breasts.
---
No W
---
PS: Pretty sure I screenshoted the main pic just because it reminded me of Leatherface's hitbox.
---
What Jake are we talking about again?
---
I didn’t think anything was cooler than a leprechaun.
---
Pretty generous for a guy like Frank.
---
It's okay to admit you're bad at playing her. 
---
She's not an easy to use killer like Spirit but dangerous in the right hand. 
---
Wouldnt a better name for Jack the ripper be "The London Slasher" or hell even "The Stalker"
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
Im so proud of this community
---
I completely agree, the Corrupted Blood is really strong even with an average aim 
---
OP in this case means Over Powered :)
---
Same. My internet is trash 99% of the time, so I very, *very* rarely play killer. The *only* time I play killer is when I have a daily *and* I think my internet is better than usual at the time. At the end of the game I apologize if I was lagging at all. It sometimes works, but sometimes everyone will call me an "obvious lag switcher", and say they reported me.
---
The worst part is, I can't tell that/if I'm lagging. I have ***no*** idea how bad it actually is if I truly am. All the survivors look normal to me, so I would assume it can't be bad. But judging by how pissed people sometimes get at the end of a match, I just assume it's pretty bad.
---
Hit 4 survivors after a blink
---
Thats so hard tbh, its really rare that you hit survivors after a blink with nurse. Really makes you work for that 30k bp
---
Not too hard to thing so,she is pretty strong, but what many survivors do wrong when i puke on them is try their best to juke the vomit. Now dodging a little to the left and right to not catch all the vomit and prevent yourself from being broken in one puking is fine, but if you stop heading towards a loop and you instead circle around the killer, you just screw yourself. When people figure her out a bit better she won't feel as strong, but still a great threat. I just wish there were more options to mass spread the plague instead of getting lucky and finding more than one survivor together.
---
Welcome to DBD, where the rules are made up and the bloodpoints don't matter.
---
And by benefit you mean they move at standard killer speed, and as long as they don't use their ability they can *maybe* catch up and one-hit survivors, assuming they don't get caught up in a loop they can't counter without using their ability.  
---
It's just detrimental to use NOED on Legion. It's as good as using nothing.
---
I... Know that actually, and I'm serious about my question. I really don't know how Claudette is an OP? 
---
I'm actually scared. I'm a killer main and usually have qn ammazing connection. When I host a kyf match, my friends are amazed at how smooth it runs. I'm just scared that for me, dedicated servers will mean a lesser experience.
---
I do agree that in general, dedicated servers are a good thing
---
those are all my victory royales.
---
I wouldn't say negates a killers offering,  maybe mitigate in the way the branch offerings counter each other but having one survivor able to completely negate the killers offering is kinda BS, seeing as there's 4 survivor offerings to the killers 1.
---
Ah in case english isn't your first language its just she *Is* over powered not *an* overpowered.
---
The reason people believe she is overpowered is because she basically blends into certain maps such as swamp and some corners on coldwind. 
---
even more so when she is P3. 
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Who made this, needs to make more. I need more of this fucking OwO shit
---
It has always been the truth. But the nonbelievers rejected it
---
I think they were moderately entertaining 
---
Male Legions sound like they stubbed their toe.
---
I don't know how to recognise a lag switcher, but I'm sure that a wraith I played against once was a lag switcher. I was working on a generator with another survivor, everything was running smooth, I suddenly hear the wraith bell, so I start running, the bell keeps ringing over and over again and I see the wraith just walking by the generator, it was only when he kept walking into a wall that I realised that the game had been lagging for the last 20 seconds, I could move around no problem on my screen. Another 40 seconds later the lag stopped and suddenly all 4 survivors were in dying state
---
Excuse me, Herman Carter’s giggle is super spoopy. (Piggy oink not spoop though).
---
Wow, I just looked at your profile and other comments you've made. You are truly a trash bag of a human being. You positively RADIATE micro dick energy.
---
You're also toxic AF obviously so you are obviously overcompensating for probably being really passive and mouse-y in your real life. You probably wouldn't say boo to a goose because you're scared so you overcompensate online. Pitiful.
---
The fact that you pretend that survivors cant be toxic says it all. Its not about them making plays, they certainly didnt do much of that. It's about them dragging out the game for 20 minutes once the gate is open and i let them leave by trying to find me and teabag relentlessly. Its about not outplaying people but making sure the killer has a miserable time by going out of their way to keep the killer in a game. You obviously ignored the fact they sent abuse too and that's because its behaviour you are obviously guilty of with your post history of racism and terrible please for attention. This is the last time I'll respond to you, I'm not here for you to lash out at because you can't make peace with what little you are packing where it matters.
---
Lisa was killed. 
---
Iron Grasp only adds on a second or two, so Aggitation would be a much better pick.  
---
yo wtf, this would make him mid/high tier, i love it!
---
I don't see this as a troll. More of a legit tactic that unfortunately works in this game. 
---
Sometimes I’ll have bad ping as a killer, and I’ll feel bad knowing they’re really having a shitty time. So dedicated servers are going to make it so I suffer too when I have shit connection. But hopefully the servers will be a better connection than peer to peer.
---
The entity isn't a fanboy, it doesn't want celebrity murderers...
---
I usually play with my friend, but my boyfriend met some of his best friends this way, so why not!
---
Ill DM now :)
---
So you run into it enough to be sick of it and more often than not have 1 Totem left you struggle to find? I suggest you consider taking something like Small Game to help you deal with.
---
Also, it's pure bullshit when anyone claims NOED gives you a free kill when it's really 1 hook. Even then it's not free as you've still gotta find someone and catch them.
---
Neither, otherwise is the key word

1. Become a Claudette main

2. Level Clauette to P3 and unlock the feature: Invisible

3. Unlock and equip Urban Evasion
---
4. Befriend the grass. 
---
Indeed. Once you learn even just some of the spawn points it makes a huge diFFerence.
---
Huntress isnt intimidating, she sounds like a kid throwing a tantrum, aww come here huntress :3
---
Up until you down 2-3 people going for a save because they didn't expect you to have it. Saying its as good as nothing is extremely ignorant, especially if it comes down to a legion that understands they can cut off a survivors path and cancel frenzy to get the hit on a survivor before they can make it to a loop. Compared to a survivor taking self-care and no mither (a perfect example of as good as using nothing) i would say NOED still has some use on legion.  Again, not as good as other killers, but it's still applicable. 
---
I feel like it maintains his ability of small area / hookdive control, without incentivizing people to try to exclusively hold the basement survivor hostage.

The way I interpreted it was that the otherwise could have functioned as establishing a new terror radius. Good to see that it was just me, though. 
---
fair enough
---
eweeweweweew
---
It's about the stun sounds, not sounds in general
---
well if the killer is toxic by camping then why not be toxic back? are you deluded?
---
Neat.
---
yeah it seems awesome, right now his ability is pretty weak without add ons, he is the only killer i dont play without add ons in fact
---
200% true, especialy when they are a 4man lmao
---
Prayer Beads Spirit has drawn more attention to it.
---
I'd say it's the best killer detection perk tbh and very slept on. It tells you exactly what you need to know - whether the killer coming for you or not. Perks like Alert give you lots of precise information on where the killer is but not when it really matters to you. Like ok, they're across the map, that doesn't help for when they decide to come for the gen you're working on 20 seconds later. Spine Chill gives you a head start on chases/stealthing, lets you work confidently within the Terror Radius and largely invalidates the stealth abilities of everyone but T1 Myers. A really versatile lil perk imo!
---
i find him visable, since they gave killer a big buff and nerfed survs, but before 2.0 he was pretty bad

People dc against frank's mixtape legion because it's unbalanced and awful to play against. If you fix the balance issue with it you won't have nearly as many people DC-ing against it.

---
This really is only gonna work if youre against a bad killer. Experienced killers will punish you for this.
---
Bar none one of my most hated maps. 
---
This man is unworthy! We must light the dark path this man is on! Show him our god! (Mcote is a DBD dev who is a Also a meme and we all love him Bc he is a QT)
---
Doc's is just... funny. 
---
God is real 
---
Idk I actually like this idea. People act like this would be game changing, but good killers will probably get a 4k anyway. Killers still win with 3k. Like???
---
I find that people don't really understand how the hatch spawn works anyway (if spectator mode in low ranks is any indication) so this could work in either party's favor.
---
Note: I don't really care about ranks, but if this would affect killer pips somehow, then I guess I could see how this might be a problem if a 4k is necessary for a pip.
---
o shit didnt even realize it was you XD
---
Because they are both doctors. 
---
Its the same reason I hate leatherface, hes just the Billy that we couldn't originally get. They are the same character idea. Imagine if we had another nurse, or another clown, or another wendigo. Like wtf make something original please.
---
It's like looking at a bunch of penguins.

yeah some japanese site said the 20th so i think thats it

It happened with Friday the 13th for me.

No worries. I'm coming back down, just got this phone and time. Probably my bad for being so blunt about where I was at with this.

Yep, as well as "How can I best keep my stacks on Save the Best For Last?"

whenever i get a russian killer its super laggy, really doesnt help the steriotype lol

can be a good thing, if the killer had STBFL youre most likely gonna be left alone for the majority of the match

What does SWF mean? (I am a new player) 
---
Me: lets survivor go into the hatch.
---
Survivor that escape: "GGEZ NOOB CAMPER, UNINSTALL UR MOTHER DOG" 
---
Survive with friends!
---
I’m mostly talking about frank and joes design, now that I think about it. The 2 girls I forgot about. (Ugly cosmetics)
---
Except rotten fields. No one likes rotten fields.
---
New killer trailer releases, New Karlsson as The Traitoe
---
Ah thank you! 
---
Honestly the moment you said stuff about momentum and chainsaw sprint you lost me— is this for leatherface or hillbilly? bc only one technically “sprints” 
---
Dlcs don't release on Wednesdays at least in western countries.
---
Since Clown they've all been Tuesday.
---
Most of the new killers dont follow the rules of the old killers anyway, every killer before spirit i believe has killed at least 10 people
---
Everyone below is bringing up some pretty good points. I think the best thing to do is wait and see what happens. Hopefully everything will get better, but if it doesn't then it's definitely voice our opinion. 
---
If survivors didnt stay in the game and fuck around with the killer this much after gates are open, there wouldn't be a reason to run NOED. It really cuts down on the cocky assholes that taunt and swarm the hook. 
---
I totally agree. 
---
memes and titties, you sir, are a hero
---
I wish struggle stage didn't require you to smash a button and instead just had a "give up" button
---
OOOOGH

saw it on a japanese website not sure
---
EEEK
---
&gt;get rid of lagswitching
---
&gt;Fuck over Australia, large parts of asia, aftica and south america because they can no longer play with low ping against each other
---
&gt;Fuck over literally every killer because the killer-sidw isn't programmed with latency in mind which leads to awful rubberbanding with any ping above 30
---
B-but a-atleast le lagswitching is g-gone right?
---
Given your example of the 32 metre trapper BASE terror radius— 
---
In a chase is +8=40 meter terror radius. 
---
Otherwise (not chasing) is decreasing. 
---
The words are used in a pair — increasing from original, decreasing from original— game coding gives a +8 value to chase terror radius and then subtracts 16 from that in any other situation—
---
Thus it is increase and decrease from whatever the given base terror radius is. 
---
Trapper base= 32
---
In chase = 32 + 8 = 40
---
Out = 32 - 8 = 24
---
When people reported this as uncivil behavior. 
---
Except for Billy. He likes rotten fields ;)
---
Aw heck, I love cuties.
---
It definitely does, I do it all the time 
---
I got upset when I saw the most recent patch notes, penalising the killers even further. I'd like the camped survivor the be rewarded. I don't care much if the killer also gets punished or not, but the survivor is being helpful to their team, so they should also get a reward for it
---
I like it, it was a broken perk before, but I like it's new purpose so will be using it a lot more
---
yeah, perhaps you might be able to hit it when you actually get to activate it once every like 10th-20th match.
---
This gave me cancer
---
Ye I was supposed to also add Agitation but meh
---
Given that I mostly see killers camp the hatch and don’t let survivors escape anyway, I wouldn’t consider it Get Out Of Jail Free.
---
Hop into a KYF with a surv as the host and try playing any killer that needs timing, aiming or has any sort of mobility.
---
Latency breaks the killers because they've not been programmed to function with it, and no one in their right mind can genuinely believe that bhvr can actually recode them to make it work
---
Depends from person to person, I see 0-1 kills as a loss, 2 kills as a draw and 3-4 kills as a victory
---
Fun fact: I had that autistic screeching guy as my gamerpic on xbox and I got suspended for a day.
---
I mean the only reason I want dedicated servers right now is so people will shut up about them and then we'll have a bring back p2p because servers suck movement. Just watch it happen.
---
When the killer has rancor and [you see the killer morying them](https://i.imgur.com/Z55VOWl.gif)

This is honestly pretty scary/uncanny

Imagine how annoying it would be not being able to see anything because you’re short as fuck.
---
You fuck off
---
Subreddit is legit cancer, camping/tunneling/ebony's get encouraged. And if you say  "camping is for noobs" you'll get -40 karma in no time which then the moderators will shadowbann all your messages because how dare you say camping is for noobs.   
---
Then again it's fucking reddit, always has been and always will be a circlejerk somewhere, usually the moderators personal beliefs end up winning which side gets circlejerked, high karma usually means you're good at being a sheep more than anything else.
---
I mean, I am asian so...
---
All jokes aside this radiates the kind of chaotic asshole energy that Frank would have and your cosplay is spot on, I love it. 
---
God, I hate playing against Legion but the 'lore' of them being literally a bunch of edgy, annoying teenagers is SO good. You nailed it! &lt;3
---
19th/20th

That would be 19th in the west then since Japan timezone is far ahead.  In 3 hours it'll be the 19th over there 3 hours will be 18th 11am for bhvr.

Unless they don't release it for every country at the same time?

OpeDO better be careful

Yes...if there was a way to keep nice people from the toxic, I'd know who to be an asshole to :D

Wow. You must be that guy who quits after being put in dying state.

I've seen it 4 times on the shrine. Never seen bbq on shrine.

It is, huntress is just a kid. Just let her win

People like Legion.  Awesome

People don't like Legion.  Awesome.
---
Can we move on now?
---
When you play okay when you are alone but starts lagging when the killer is chasing you but he can't hit you because he is bad as f.
---
Or when you can play the whole match without any problem but you want to get the hatch and once you find it you start lagging and end trapped in between some random rocks and the killer blocking you.
---
It's easy to distinguish if you are playing against someone with bad connection or someone who lags on when he wants to.
---
The Whitechapel 
---
P3 or event clothing why waste money on killer cosmetics when I won’t even see them?
---
Technicalities, my friend. Leatherface definitely enters a chainsaw sprint, he's just not Usain Bolt. LF also has a top speed he builds to, unlike Billy.
---
One killer at a time. But when a new killer shows up, I happen to cancel my plans :(
---
I like the idea that this is played and then 3 people dc on the loading screen so you spawn in and the hatch is just open.
---
I only like Susie’s mask honestly, the smile ones just looks childish and the skull one just looks like someone trying to be a tuff guy and failing its cringe, I use Susie’s mask and Joe’s outfit looks cool.

Unless killer took hook offering of their own

I like how Susie has a knife now instead of her ruler. Mr. Myers requires the student to have a knife.

Some people let friends or siblings play their account and I feel like they get immersed. Other people are just having fun. Not everyone has to play mlg pro 360 YY triple stall decisive strike. Annoying? Absolutely. But it happens.

&gt; Alright heres a link to my tier list: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b0sgeq/reworked_my_tier_list_a_bit_added_where_i_feel/
---
Thanks. That's a reasonable list. Our top 6 are around the same, except I have the Plague in there. She hasn't come out yet so I can understand that there is some projection going on with me about her and that I may ultimately be wrong about her. I'm a rank 1 killer with over 3900 hours and I retk'd people with her on the PTB. I may not be the norm but I gravitated toward her playstyle and took a liking to her within a few hours of playing her. I've been on pins and needles hoping that the Devs don't nerf her and keep her like she is. If they do nerf her even a little then it end up significantly dropping her on my tier list.
---
Ya know, I was telling another poster earlier last week that when Freddy is re-worked that I see him being B-tier at worse, possibly low A-tier. I've seen some really good Freddy's and I respect anyone that plays him well because they deal with a lot of crap. Having to wait several seconds to hit a survivor you're next to is annoying, having to watch as survivors unhook each other right in front of your face without being able to hit them is infuriating, seeing someone working on your totem without being able to pull them off is insufferable. Part of my low grading of him is in protest of how much I think the devs have screwed him up. I really hope their rework is as good as it sounds. But I solute you as a good Freddy.
---
&gt; If we are talking about Corrupt Purge, while the puke may be eaisier to hit, Huntress has much much more range. Plagues puke is like, 12 metres? It doesn't have good range at all, forcing you to chase the survivor for a while to be able to hit them.
---
I found that when I aimed the highest, the puke went further than 12 meters but it was easier to dodge as a survivor. Kind of a bad downside with exchanging distance for accuracy. The Huntress no doubt has her beat in accuracy. I just Tasmanian devil it and splash it all around while walking forward to cause as much chaos as possible to hit a survivor. It's funny watching them try to juke only to get hit by a least expected piece of corrupted purge.
---
&gt; Thing is though is that her traps are very very hard to avoid. They are impossible to avoid in a chase, and if the hag is good and knows to trap pathways and crossroads, you will have to crouch everywhere to not pop one, meaning that you waste time not on gens. I put mike lower than Hag because he can be looped like any other killer, he has a trash early game and his power can be countered kind of in a chase, unlike where where if a trap pops 99% of the time you are getting hit.
---
Good point. That is something I forgot to mention - how good her traps are in a chase. She's an underrated chaser. She can really cut down on loops and herd you in a certain direction. I do love when smart survivors know it's the Hag and they just begin crouch-walking everywhere. I had a game at Lery's where no one was doing gens and I wondered why, only to find them all crouch walking everywhere without urban evasion because they were afraid of setting off my traps. It took them forever to walk to gens. It was hilarious. Strangely enough I think Lery's is her best map, and also it's Myer's best map. They are better than Billy and Nurse on that map. Go figure.
---
&gt; Third most hated map in the game, Yamaoka and Haddonfield edges it out for me.
---
Yamaoka Estate is ok for totem spawns in my experience, but it's like stealth heaven for survivors. I sometimes walk by those large bushes and bump into a solid object only to realize it's a survivor. It can be frustrating at times. I also don't like that there are few if any unsafe pallets there. Original realm and all, but it needs some tweaking. Before the devs think about touching The Game's map due to survivor's complaints, there are several survivor-sided maps that need reworking first and foremost. Even the Plague's map is too damn big and it's going to be hell for less mobile killers. I didn't try the Hag with that map but it's probably going to be a pain for her even. A three-story indoor temple surrounded by a football field is ridiculous. Even a two-blink Nurse is gonna have problems gen patrolling on that map.
---
It will make the experience almost equal for everyone, but as it is now, you can play a perfect match as a killer when the rest is lagging as hell.
---
Do you really need a guide for downing someone and then hiding around a corner? 
---
Didn't the Hag killed her captors before disappearing though?
---
What has this to do with the topic? 
---
Not glitchy, I find stuff but not often at all. No laggy lobbies, there are connection bars of the killer host to avoid it all. If it is red, go find a different lobby. Yes, quick to find a game.
---
It is the only game where I decided to prestige something and reset my whole character.
---
Looks like an invitation to me
---
Its to help Legion farm more points.
---
No more bs hits through pallets for you, must be really sad. 
---
Don't get caught. I know this is a petty answer, buuut I played survivor this week and not once did I get caught by NOED. Some team mates did. Don't be found, don't get caught :)
---
Doesn't make too much sense to call him the place where he murdered people. Imagine "The London" or something similar, it sounds weird :D.
---
As a Londoner who lives close to Whitechapel (and so have been around a lot of JTR entertainment stuff like the walks or the London Dungeons etc) I hope he's never in the game though, not a fan of real life killers being playable for entertainment. Imagine the outcry if it was someone more recent. 
---
A Survivor leaving instantly after a team mate gets caught (exit gates powered)
---
Reporting them does nothing. Disconnect bans are done automatically.
---
Rockefeller Street nightcore.
---
Huh, Jack The Ripper woulda been cool. The Serial Killer is a terrible name though. That's every killer in the game lol
---
Rank means nothing in this game.
---
One of the best games released on PS PLUS in my opinion
---
Legion's used Kleenex...
---
I hope not, cause everything is great until they start tweaking
---
I think it’s fine how it is because it’s only useful at the very end of the game, so it makes sense that it’s strong. 
---
And that's exactly why a survivor shouldn't be the host, of course the survivor will have an advantage. This is still in no way proof that the Dedicated Servers wouldn't work.
---
In fact, we have played games with a spectator as the host, and 4 Survivors + a Killer (obviously). We had about 60-150ms ping (we changed hosts after every match, we played 6 matches total so everyone got to be the killer). I also don't remember anyone complaining about lag or latency when playing.
---
We're all in the Rank 1-3 range and the killers always got either a 2K or a 3K if I remember correctly, which in my opinion is an OK score considering that everyone were quite high ranks. I know rank doesn't mean shit but this is just to give a rough example of the skill tier.
---
I doubt the ping on Dedicated Servers will even be over 100ms most of the time, I don't see the issue here.
---
"Does this smell like shit to you?"
---
Cool rant bro
---
The killer that hugs people, slaps people and grabs and drags people by the wrist
---
I don't let no rage quittin slide, i don't do it even when losing as killer. 
---
It looks like the game is made to scale on 16:9 monitors, based on width. The game sees a super large monitor and scales the viewport up, it's as simple. Thing is, your screen is not 16:9, so the height doesn't fit well. There's nothing you can do with such a wonky aspect ratio, apart from reducing the resolution (defeating the point of having such a monitor).
---
The spirit didn’t kill anyone until the Entity revived her so that she could kill her dad as an act of revenge
---
I can draw. I am working on a drawing right now. Anime style. I'm just curious about what it is you got in mind lol
---
Can somebody make this in GIF format for me so i can use it as my sub pop up?
---
Reporting just wastes BHVRs time when they could be banning actual hackers and exploiters.   
---
Don't report people that disconnect.
---
I disagree. It isnt hard to get to the end game and the same can be said about NOED.
---
Nah, think I'll keep doing it now since you trying to tell me how to play
---
It hard for me, I went from 10 to 16 and then I couldn't take it anymore and ranked back up automatically when just having fun :(
---
Every Legion when they bring Frank's Mixtape, Cold Dirt and an Ebony
---
He's a full on convicted pedophile who filmed himself full-fledged molesting / abusing with a child (an actor from one of his earlier films), actually plead guilty to it too. He's beyond garbage. He definitely has the rights to the character as well.   
---
Jeepers Creepers is a movie that I really enjoyed when it came out and Creeper has a good story and design but I can't see them licensing him as well. Maybe if Salva (the writer/director) was dead. But while he's living he's not getting a penny from me.
---
It works. I wish I had recorded my gameplay the other day. I was the last one left (friend died and other two left because it was hopeless trying to save me). I had a trap on my head and I'd get to a box to remove it and the pig would be following me the whole time, go into stealth, and pull me off the trap box. The Kiiller \*wanted\* me to explode and was generally playing in a semi-toxic way because they could've just hooked me. 
---
After pulling me off the trap for the third time she dumped me in the far corner of the map and went into stealth again. I was already ticking pretty fast. Unlucky for her I knew where the hatch was and she didn't. I made a beeline for the hatch with her following in stealth so she really wasn't catching up. She realised the mistake and started chasing when I was about 30ft or so away from the hatch. Managed to get it and she complained I got "lucky" and didn't explode. Not like we'd been around the whole map together for 10 minutes any way!!!
---
you looking for an epic female gamer julie cosplayer counterpart to add to this dankness
---
Oh okay then? Continue to support hackers and exploiters.
---
I'm fairly new to the game too but from what I've seen, the game has a rank system that's based on progression, not skill.   
---
So rank 1 survivors will play better than a rank 20 survivor, mainly because they've been playing for longer, but not   necessarily because they're very good. Keyword being \*necessarily\*. But in my experience as a rank 12 killer, I've found rank 13 survivors that play much, much better than rank 7 survivors, so I'm not really that upset anymore when I get rank 7 survivors in my games, I've realized it doesn't mean much.
---
Yep he's the sole writer in addition to being the director. He has the rights to the character.
---
The 'circling like idiots' part, so relatable, and so funny. I will never understand. I get a big smile on my face and say in my head: "Sorry, this is not a cartoon"
---
This is absolutely adorable!
---
As a Susie Main, I approve.
---
Chase them around the hook with your chainsaw revved up ez
---
try the huntress, she's really fun because she can throw her hatchets
---
Ohh, didn't know there is a big difference in over power and overpower. Yes, english is not my first language. Thank you for the explanation, and yes, now that I think of it, she does blend well with some maps. 
---
Right, hindsight is always 20/20. My point is people blame other players too much.
---
Nice bait
---
Imagine Chucky picking up a survivor
---
I'm gonna pop some tags
---
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
---
I I I'm hunting, looking for some killers.
---
This is fucking awesome 
---
I think there's a higher probability to get dailies for the side you've played less lately. At least thats how it works for me
---
Oh man we were all optimistic and happy when we first started playing this game, wait until you reach the lower ranks where the opposite side will be your biggest enemy in life.
---
I remember a match where we had to dc because it was impossible to play due the killer's connection. 
---
When we quit he apologized on the aftermatch lobby and said "I understand why you dced and I am so much more pissed than you are because I just want to play and my itnet connection is very bad".
---
There is where I learned not to blame the killer because it is not his fault. I felt really bad even if I did not blame him but other teammates did and, I must say, I blamed other killers before for that.
---
Whoopity slainus i now own your anus
---
The mori cycle excluding the yellow is unfair. We should not fight op vs op that will lead to ruin. Survivors lost there ultra rare offering and I do think the devs need to add one for them but should not be one that will let a 4 man sfw get out in less then two minutes. Or award selfish actions for solo players.
---
Well, while that isnt the best move to do, some people just want to get out before who knows what happens
---
Oh I agree. I also think that is why we won't get Norman Bates or Patrick Bateman. 
---
Exactly, as I said. While it was only one kill, it was the strong feelings behind it that allowed her to fall to him. Origionally, Rins father was going to be the one taken by the Entity. but seeing the rage and will of Rin chose her instead.
---
Myers for two simple reasons
---
1. He is arguably one of the most unique killers and can be played in lots of different ways (my favourite is tombstone with infinate tier 3 because I can Mori people on the spot)
---
2. Myers can't be bought with shards so you're better off saving your iridescent shards for the others.
---
I would say that stab wounds study is much more annoying than cold dirt. but other than that good meme.
---
Just shoot hatchets through pallets/windows/melee. That's how I'm playing her on PS4 and it's pretty damn effective
---
That's like the old bug where you could spam bing bong to go faster
---
If anything after the recent balance changes I think it needs to be even stronger. Heal you fully from the mend state &amp; maybe even free you from the Killers grasp if you are being carried to a hook...
---
True, but there's a degree of separation and surrealism that often makes them unrelatable. I can't, personally, understand what goes on in the mind of a serial killer.
---
But everyone knows what peer pressure and the desire to fit in feels like. Maybe you haven't stabbed a janitor, but that feels closer to reality than blowing up a mine full of people or pulling somebody's head and spine out of their body Mortal Kombat style.
---
You just crossed the line buddy
---
I dont like Legion but I have to say that this is awesome lol.
---
Well, I'm definitely guilty of this, but if I don't open them quickly, my teammates will open them even tough I told them to noy open any chests before the trial. I need my key... for when you die... because I didn't save you... to get the key... I think I now see the error of my ways
---
Learn to look behind you when running.
---
When getting to a gen, make sure you know where the nearest pallet is.
---
Dont waste pallets. If you're running to a pallet and you think you're still going to take a hit, don't throw down the pallet. Take the hit and use the Sprint burst to go to the next loop.
---
Learn the killer shack loop, if nothing else. It's on every map and can easily waste a ton of the killers time.
---
If someone is getting chased, get on a gen asap. If someone is hooked across the map, just stay on the gen.
---
There's no shame in bringing a toolbox if you're having trouble pushing gens.
---
Power through Ruin. It's usually not worth it to stop and run around looking for it. Trust someone else is probably going to break and look for it first. Practice your great skill checks.
---
Holy shit people in these comments are delusional "I don't care about my **teammates** in this **team**-based survival game. I'm playing **solo**". The whole point is to help eachother escape, that's not happening if you're giving the killer free instal-kills...
---
Creepy af
---
Face camping Bubba uwu
---
Imagine him hooking Jeff by ***fucking yeeting him*** 
---
It all depends on the kind of net code they use. For example: if you're a killer and chasing a leggy survivor it could either show them further back than what they are (due to the delay) or predict where they'll go and have them teleport around a bit. There's tons of other ways this could go, but dedicated servers aren't a magical fix. Lag will always cause issues.
---
dude wtf this is so scary I’m shaking and crying rn I can belive that you have done this why

Its mostly because of the cosmetics

They all have high school clothes with that year

Makes sense, kinda

lol

What have you brought upon this cursed land?
---
Their 
---
Is this madness tier 4?
---
That’s how you learn bitch
---
He said, go play Fortnite pedophile cringe lord.
---
Even though it’s the killers wifi and unstable connection.
---
sir are you okay? its okay to not be okay some times.
---
Ds needed to go fam, survivors are in no way weaker than the killer, the game is more balanced now than ever before.
---
All that’s left now is nerfing noed 
---
Indeed and he fucked up, he chased the other guy for a few seconds, but didn't commit, enforcing my tought that he wanted that one guy specifically dead and didn't know the most effective way to facecamp
---
true 
---
When you hope it’s Play With Your Food and the killer is actively ignoring you, only to find out it’s Rancor and your heart drops. 
---
Leave me alone. Rank reset is the best time to try new killers. Well, two weeks after a rank reset. I wish each killer had its own killer rank. 
---
Are you?  You actively participate with an app that illegally collects data and has become a hunting ground for pedophiles.  Fuck you for condoning that shit.
---
1. None of these would never be in their, BEhavior doesn't have that money. 2. Chucky is to small to even be in dead by daylight, that's practically a camping killer

I feel like The plague has the weakest lore. All she did was catch the plague and *boom*! Now she’s a serial killer
---
Legion just became 100x worse
---
Can confirm I am one of her axes
---
New mori looks great
---
In my experience it's about 80% chance the killer will just play it out like normal or even go out of their way to be a dick.
---
I personally always let survivors escape if there's a leaver.
---
Why are you taking the mixtape with stab study, you can still three shot without it :)
---
I mean, the flipside is  that you'll either only be tunneled once every 10-20 matches or the killer will give away a gen for free while  they slug out the timer
---
Maybe just the ability to not go in a game if 1 or more people don’t load in, you get your offering and add-on back?
---
that is as simple as, as I said, you are not able to hit no one without them lagging. 
---
Also, your argument is pretty selfish. 
---
I always have calm spirit on me. Always. Idgaf.
---
Just depends. Honestly, I don’t play this game to farm and with the amount of times survivors regularly DC, it would happen too often. 
---
If it’s 3 survivors, most of the time I will DC too. Or tunnel the obsession then go AFK while I grab a drink or whatever.
---
This is hilarious and your cosplay is awesome. 10/10.
---
He toll 
---
Right. His stun sound is a little giggle.
---
Making some tweaks to stop moonwalking, reworking Franklin's Mixtape and buffing his base speed to 115 should make him more tolerable for both sides, imo. Maybe tweaking deep wound a bit so it provide some additional useful effect beyond mildly inconvenience survivors for like 5 seconds. 
---
I CANT BREATHE HELP
---
It is def a nerf, leatherface can swipe an entire team in the right circumstance 
---
Sorry the riot that formed seconds after he said that already burned down his house with his family inside.
---
What you're saying is contradictory to the changes being made.
---
DS will still work the same as it does now with 2 core exceptions and 1 change.
---
1. 60 second timer after being hooked.
---
2. Can only be used if you were hooked.
---
1a. Can be used while being picked up.
---
-If you use DS you can't use it again even if you're hooked a second time.
---
-If you miss your skill check then you won't be able to use it for the rest of the match. Same as if you hit your skill check.
---
-The current DS doesn't have a timer.
---
-The survivor (obsession) using it can decide when it's best for them to use it.
---
-It is more anti tunnel in its current state than the nerf will be because there's still risk/reward for using/missing it or using it at the wrong time or in the wrong place. 
---
-It can only be used once.
---
Knowing this, this nerf is worse than using borrowed time since you're still going to get tunneled again anyways. 
---
So if the game as it stands now, as you say, is as balanced as it has ever been, then why the call for a DS nerf? If the issue is "wasted time" then why not just add the new change and allow people to use the current DS in the pick up animation. 
---
They're going to get tunneled after getting hit with it anyways so what sense does it make to nerf it? Do you see the issue here? It isnt the perk. It's the person playing killer that is so determined because now he's butthurt that he has to chase you all over again. 
---
No time was saved. So do you see where I'm coming from on this and why I think the nerf will change nothing? 
---
It's contradictory to say the game is currently balanced and then say DS needs a nerf. If It's balanced we wouldn't be talking about a nerf. Games that are fairly balanced don't have nerf discussions. They have discussions about how to make the game more fun for everyone. And that's my issue with the nerf. The game currently is balanced. Even with the current state of DS and hook placement with the faster pick up times. It ruins any chance of any non obsession of ever getting the skill check after having to wiggle for what is it, 35%? 40%? 45%? Of their wiggle bar. By the time you get it that far you hear the skill check notification and boom, on a hook before it even shows up.
---
Looks like normal nea to me
---
On Wraith, Swift Strikes, bloody body, and tarnished sickle. 
---
I use full bloody Hag because she's pretty like that.
---
I have default Spirit except for a brown schoolgirl dress. 
---
My Huntress has boar head and dress and bloody axe.
---
When I first started, I went all in with Claudette and Hag because I didn't know how bloodpoints and prestige and perks worked lol. Got her to P3-50. After that, I realized and I did a sort of calculated level everyone to 40 based on whose perks I wanted. Leveled all my survivors to 40. Halfway through doing the same for my killers. Though, I am leveling all the killers to 15 first so I can play with four perks on everyone and get adept achievements (and in hopes that BBQ &amp; Chili shows up since I leveled Bubba first specifically for that reason lol.) 
---
After that, I'll probably return to the survivor side and level Claudette until I have every perk fully leveled on her. Then pick some of my favorite killers and do the same for them. 
---
Disgusting truth ? Companies don't care if you play it, they just want that sweet sweet dosh
---
I don't bust out the wallet unless I'm playing the game in the next hour
---
Same, had this problem for a long time now.
---
Where is it directly stated she killed him? I can't find any canon information stating she actually has had the opportunity yet.
---
“Hey I’m in ormond, I’m gonna go see whether the legion ever got out of ormond! Hmmm where could they be? Ah, the resort, better head there!”
---
-Jeff’s last words
---
Fairly low amount of time put on my end but there’s a lot to learn that is written in the game and a lot more to learn that you have to look up. If you asked me how Freddy’s dream state works I’d say “uhhh he can see you in the dream state once you’re beyond a certain range?”. I don’t play Freddy, I’ve barely played against Freddy, I’ve only watched one Freddy video and that was No0b3 doing the no passive challenge. It’s no excuse, it’s my fault that i don’t know what he does. I don’t know the intricacies of what a lot of characters do. I have no interest in them. I’m slowly learning them because I like learning and the competitive value, but imagine the average player just not caring. 
---
Same. Can't even fuck around with my friends. Gotta keep it on the down low.
---
Everything except the Auric Cells seems to be included!
---
Okay, well, she still had a damn good reason to be pissed off, then.
---
I seem like I'm in the majority, but my pings have been good and my queue times good as well. I've been lucky. This change certainly helped me.
---
Hope they allow steam to do the same! 
---
Yes, but removing something isn't the same as balancing it, I'm proposing a balance, didn't say I wouldn't like it removed
---
I’m talking about the hypocrisy in the sub overall, not your personal opinion 
---
the hallmark of creative and not half assed writing
---
Unnerving doctor really isn’t that bad. Especially compared to legion or a good nurse. I feel like it honestly helps me hit the great skill checks lol
---
I love the pitter patter of petite elite feet
---
Hello, timezones exist
---
No
---
more like she goes into a little girl tantrum
---
Omg delete that i look so bad here 
---
Shroud of Separation should be a Survivor offering and Shroud of Union should be a Killer offering #ChangeMyMind
---
I have a suspicion Legion was supposed to be Ghostface.   
---
I'm personally hoping Chucky comes around the release of the movie reboot. I seriously hope the camera is super low and he runs just as fast as the other killers, with his weakness being the super low FP camera so boxes are like buildings.
---
You see how you’re thinking tho right? 
---
You’re only thinking from the survivor’s pointbof view.
---
Fact is that DS was a pain in the ass for normal killers who don’t tunnel or camp, and made it very unfun for killers while also rewarding toxic behaviour from the survivor’s side.
---
Whenever I play killer I’m more scared of the survivors because of the fear of them having wiggle DS which was the most frustrating thing in existence. You need to try killer for a bit.
---
Well like I said, I use it for points so I wasn't 100% sure on the distances auras show up. I've been playing this game for so long auras don't even matter to me. I have a pretty good idea of their general location, spawn points and where they're going to go or be anyways. It feels like all the maps are the same. I can't wait for the new DLC to freshen this game up some.
---
For me, it depends on how soon they leave. If people leave early and there’s an unfair amount of gens left for the remaining survivors, I’ll probably let them live but if they leave after a few gens have been knocked out, I’ll keep playing like normal.
---
Honestly the only real intimidating stun sound is Wraith's elephant giving birth noise. Huntress kinda gets angery and Leatherface squeals a bit.
---
Billy's stun noise is also pretty intimidating. I love Trapper's stun noise though and how he literally goes "oof." Mikey as well with his "augh!"
---
This would be an interesting idea especially if there was a killer equivalent introduced too. Like maybe an ultra rare that stops the hatch from being opened by a purple key (but not a skeleton one) or a rare that ups the number of gens required to spawn the hatch? Idk. 
---
*paid
---
Also did Jeff make Legion's logo? I thought he just made band logos and shit.
---
I wonder if it will affect The Plague DLC?, Hopefully it comes out before 29th on PS4. I got all DLC but good to know for people that don't.
---
Susie’s Mask is the best mask and it’s best complimented with Joe’s knife. This isn’t opinion. 
---
He never said it was balanced, he said it has never been MORE balanced than it is now. There is a difference. DS should never have existed in the first place. A perk rewarding bad plays and makes the game a living hell against coordinated groups.
---
I'm still really hoping for a Chuckie chapter. I doubt we'll get a Scream chapter after Legion was basically Ghostface but I'd love a liscensed Legion cosmetic for Ghostface.
---
I'm not specifically asking for SWF to be removed because I honestly don't care that much about rank (if DBD was the only game I'd play, I'd get red ranks on both sides within a week). It was for the sake of argument, but i'm guessing that went over your head.
---
Killer based play largely revolves around aim-precise killers with the exception of a few killers. A lot of top killers are being indirectly nerfed by lag. All i'm saying is don't be surprised when it takes fifteen minutes to find a lobby when BHVR's spaghetti code makes killers turn into survivors or quit the game. 
---
Her obnoxiously loud roar is the big issue for me. Not saying they should completely remove it but if they could place it at the end of the ambush channel that would make it a fait bit better. I'd say get rid of the roar in favor of making the sign of ambush the "shing" the blade makes when unsheathing, but I know the roar is supposed to be from the Saw series so it would be nice to keep it too.
---
Survivor perk tier list? Based on which one? There's countless of tier lists around.
---
Just make your own conclusions and use what you feel like gives you the best gaming experience ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
CANDYMAN. NOW.
---
It’s heavily implied that a member of the Legion paid Jeff to make their logo in Jeff’s lore. I honestly really like that their lore is actually tied with each other.
---
This surprises me, the lore is one of my favorite things about the game, probably wouldn’t enjoy the game half as much without knowing the backstory behind it
---
We must summon the chapter!

It’s only on select DLC, so The Plague almost definitely wouldn’t be included.
---
I have all the DLC too so no help to me but great deal for those who don’t! 
---
I know. I figured it would be moot. But I figured id try.
---
I'm a rank 1 killer. I have been for a very very long time. Long before this cancerous hand me down rank 1 system. DS has never bothered me. The "toxic" survivors are easy to bait it out of before the first gen is even done. They think they have something to prove to their friends. It's gone long before a gen is finished. DS in its current state isn't an issue. Not for me at least. 
---
I'm also not a bad survivor. I've been known to make killers give up chasing me, rage quitting or they see me and turn right the fuck around and go do something else besides waste their time on me. I'm one of those survivors that will run you for 4 gens then hit you with DS and run you for the last and ultimately get facecamped for not being able to do anything but run the whole match. It's lame being chased the entire match. I don't like doing it but it's gotta be done if the killer won't go fuck off somewhere else.
---
I really wish hatch wasn't the ultimate get out of jail free card if their team gets slaughtered and the immersed claudette that has been sitting in one corner in the entire time gets a free escape.
---
Also, the fact that it’s a strong Freddy counter is ridiculous 
---
The first one that comes up when you google “dbd tier list”, and the only one i’ve seen that has an entire website dedicated to it.  Led me to assume it’s pretty popular. And I don’t play based on the list, I just find it interesting to keeping up with.
---
I suppose we will see, but I'm skeptical. I just can't believe killers can't see at least from a survivor perspective how annoying lag is. Like when youre 10 feet past a window and killer put get still connects. Sorry it's just selfish on killers part
---
It says ‘select DLC’ which made me curious since it looks like every single DLC is on sale. So my best guess is that they put that there because The Plague will release during that timeframe but will still be full price.
---
Cool :)
---
i see! thank you for an actual answer. i need to give the perk an actual shot!
---
Yeah it's unfortunate that Wraith is such a cruddy stealth boi at the moment. I could tell I'd main him a lot, and occasionally I do play him a fair bit, but he's just so weak that it's really not enjoyable.
---
\*Slams the chest shut and runs off with his brown toolbox\*
---
Summon, Brother! We NEED your power!
---
I stopped playing on Xbox all-together because of the long wait times just waiting to get into a lobby. 
---
It's spelt daylight you idiot lmao smh xd
---
Whiny people always find something to want to nerf. But I hope they let her be for once so we don't get another Freddy
---
I'm sorry that you feel bloodlusting a survivor until they're away from a loop to down them is a "bad play" on the survivors part. I don't see how it's rewarding someone for "bad plays" in the hands of a good survivor that can kite the killer the whole match. 
---
3 things are certain in life: death, taxes, and you being a weirdo in this sub lmao. I honestly see you in every single thread. Go outside or something, please. 
---
I know with legion, they released quickly are the PTB closed but that was an outliner for most chapter releases. Normally it's like 2-3 weeks after the PTB closes, right? 
---
If you want to play 1 vs 1 you are in the wrong game.
---
You, as a killer, must end a team, what is 4 vs 1. That is the way the game it's made, swf or not.
---
What they need to implement is a way of communication ingame. Not a voice chat, but at least a general menu where everybody can interact with.
---
damn, this sub fucking sucks lol i was thinking this too, and it’s gross you were downvoted so much
---
I think the idea is we’re just not seeing the perspective of certain areas yet. Even thought you’re in an enclosed area in game, lore makes it sound like all the areas kind of string together. Every new DLC is likely meant to be interpreted as the new survivor and killer in their ‘native realm’, I think the survivors are always meant to go to the same starting point when leaving the campfire, e.g. Jane Romero starting at the Temple of Purgation but being able to move to other realms, whilst the Plague is linked to that location in some way.
---
It's all personal prefence
---
Unnerving doctor is an interesting build to play against. It’s sort of a thriller/horror theme that things are harder to do with the killer nearby. And guess what! You can loop a doctor! Woooo. Doctor takes skill to play.  F legion. 
---
Reddit complaining about survivor lag is in the very minority of cases and shouldn't have been taken as seriously as it was. I've been on the receiving end of lag when I play survivor and now I just implement common sense and watch my ping before I choose to stay or go in a lobby. If it starts to badly lag mid match, i'll leave. 
---
Adam is from Jamaica, actually.
---
How come this is brought up now? Did you finally get around to cleaning your room and found this or what? :D
---
Tbh I think the real negative is that the game will no longer be immortal. Old games like PS2 games have lived and died from dedicated servers that are no longer open. We could’ve been playing DBD for years after it had fully lost a player base, and that will no longer be an option.
---
I had this happen when doing a daily with Feng. I hadn’t noticed I was obsession until the last possible second, just as the gates were powered and I was downed.

What? Look, ok, first off, he was an interrogator. Interrogators don’t kill people. From what I know people just realized that his POWS went missing. Anyways even IF they knew he was BREAKING THE GENEVA CONVENTIONS they wouldn’t care. A soldier killing people isn’t weird, that’s his or her job. A soldier killing people with mind augmenting gear that causes a field of madness is out of place. Doc didn’t wear his gear because he would get arrested. Why would Pamala Voorhees show the counselors that she is insane? Anyways Doc (like Trapper) got his implants from the Entity.
---
I've literally been rank 1 on both sides. This game doesn't have competitive depth enough for me to care about "getting good" and my internet connection has never been an issue.
---
A more fair clause would be to stop letting people with bad internet host lobbies and to immediately disconnect a game if a killer's host starts lag-spiking. This is a solution that only punishes people who make the game unfair and not everyone who plays the game, which is unfair. 
---
And yeah, you're ignoring large chunks of my responses in an attempt to cherry pick. That's pretty ignorant.
---
The 10% per player penalty means three survivors on three generators make more progress than if they were all on the same one.
---
You cant exit through the doors with a trap but you can exit through the hatch with it on. 
---
these would be hilarious to see in game
---
They also said they would never implement a clown

Good hilarious or bad hilarious tho

It's actually pretty simple, it just wants toys to control and play with.

Ah, guess I can laugh at the fact you didn’t show the guy who escaped? Honestly I just wanna laugh at someone. 
---
I think that puts her fourth above those three, I’ve always held that she is above any killer apart from those three hypermobile ones, so still above Hag and Huntress. I’d say 4th could be considered S tier.
---
Well, 1 week removed from the ptb was always optimistic.. it's far more likely to be next week but I'd be so happy if it just surprise released tomorrow.

Also it's only 10am so the could still announce something today

Remember that time you got shit on tho, and said you had a miserable experience cause of it?

from what ive seen though, freddy is incredibly fast while putting survs in the dream state? it seems as soon as he pulls anyone into the dream state its an insta hit since he’s able to get up right next to you before youre pulled in the dream state, and its difficult to get to a pallet before youre pulled in. i’ve also heard people say self care is an easy counter to get out of the dream state, but skill checks come too slowly to wake up before freddy gets to you.
---
honestly lol im just a surv in dire need of tips for going against freddy cuz every time i play against him its a 4k
---
Being pessimistic about a company isn’t being a dc’ing douche. Also, I’m a fucking Trapper main. Do you really think I care about winning lol? Honestly I may be giving too much shit on Behavior. I’m still angy that they thought Legion was a good idea
---
You can’t fucking mindgame at all on coldwind and it sucks
---
Would you settle for McLean?
---
Brain games what is... PT?
---
But we all know it’s just rancor :(
---
I do this a lot if there's leavers. I also in general like to do this when I've been playing a lot of survivor and I switch over to killer for a while, because how rough it is out there for survivors at a certain rank.
---
How old are you? If you were a teen in 96 or are above the age of 25 you’ll think it’s cringe. That’s just what people do lol. Btw I think all the masks are dumb. I prefer their faces.
---
No it doesn't. Multi stalking worked at start but it got changed.
---
They also said no religious killers and now we have Plague 
---
Whenever I decide to just deal with the bad ping, it's just an afk killer in the corner swinging their weapon with four hex totems
---
The only S tier is nurse because of how much better she is than everyone else
---
If you gave *me* the hatch, I'd thank you cause that's super awesome of you. (: 
---
I once had a match where I was playing Quentin, against a Freddy, I was the obsession, and had I not used Azarov's Key, we would have ended up at Badham Preschool, because the Freddy put up a map offering for that.
---
We remember the outstanding originals, the cool 1000s, the fucking awesome 2000s, the not mediocre 3000s, and the memey 4000s
---
Spooky Nurse: Any weapon. (Preferably the Victorian or marked) Pumpkin head, and black aberrations.
---
Sadly I’m 28, 
---
Its the same speed, being able to gain EW with multiple survivors was removed long ago
---
Why everyone thinks that cold dirt is good with franks mixt tape its better to use movement speed addon with frank and green fatigue addon with cold dirt
---
Or the Jockey from Left 4 Dead 2.
---
Yep, welcome to the age where anything teen or below is exceptionally cringy and completely baffling.
---
I have two survivors where it's a mainstay.  Alert, calm spirit, iron will, and either breakdown or kindred

Deception has an outright ridiculous cool down, and numbers need to be tweaked, but the ideas are neat.

Also Just because one of them is first on the tier doesn’t mean they’re the best in the tier

Definitely enjoyed watching this.
---
Nah man toxic is part of any competitive game. I play a ton of smite and i think that might be the worst toxic game ever (you still a kill in a ranked game some people literally go afk and throw the rest of the match) since you are fairly new. Did you get the dlc with it? And if not have you earn enough in game currency to buy a dlc character?
---
Huh, I must not have noticed that. It's been a while since I've played, but I know it used to work.
---
The “so you picked Myers” map. I swear the first Myers game of my night is almost always coldwind.
---
The first one def hilariously bad. People already think NOED is a free pass for bad killers ( which it arguably is). This is LITERALLY a free pass for failing at your job.

At least you didn’t make a racist joke that got you 30 downvotes. Rip

Before the Legion, I absolutely HATED doc. Now I get a Doc and i’m relieved.

Same thing happened to me, but I was playing hag lmao. Endless bags
---
It does only work once tho and if the said survivors hasn.t been on hook he can still be saved xD
---
It.s not an exhaustion perk... that.s why I thought it should have a long cooldown
---
Coldwind becomes best map for chucky, lol.

Word it takes mad long without getting the dlc, bet yea ill prolly just get em all, its like buy the game without the deal if i get all the dlc so f it
---
Just had this happen yesterday. Finished 2 daily rituals, left them completed and they disappeared.
---
Same thing that always happens with new chapters. People overreact before they know how the killer is played or, if they think the killer is too strong, how to play around the killer. 
---
People figured out which add ons are best and which perks work with him, and then realized he can be extremely strong. 
---
People downvote but I honestly agree. Unless they also have ruin, hitting the skill checks isn’t gonna be that much of a challenge. 
---
It's not about how often you can get a 4K, the tier list is based on how much potential the killers have got to beat a very optimized survivor team
---
Being able to insta-get off the killer's shoulder if you hit a skillcheck is very strong. That's why it's getting nerfed, to make it more in line with other powerful yet situational perks.
---
shit you got me i dont know
---
Yeah I can see how they're annoying. I primarily used em and I had people message me constantly saying wtf Legions bad tho after I got all four. 
---
Prove Thyself
---
Yep. The argument for NOED is just cleanse the totems. The argument for Adrenaline, in that case, is just kill the survivors.
---
Poop thyself
---
Are you sure you didn’t cheat?
---
you look just like him!! amazing cosplay! :D
---
Step 1: Accept your Death
---
Wow... No war... Guys and gals... WE DID IT. 
---
I feel like other survivors escaping the trial should reward you with 1000 points each, with all 4 survivors escaping being 8000 bloodpoints
---
I actually like getting stunned while playing Pig because the sound she makes
---
Clown's is so good.   
---
"HAAAAGH HA HUH HA". Like you just clobbered him with a sheet of lumber and he's still hacking and laughing his way through all of it. 
---
I had to look it up for sure. You didn't say it was a closed-book test
---
Imagine having Jack the ripper as a killer like thats why they could never find him the entity got to him first.
---
I think we passed tier 4
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Summon the chapter. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
It's fine as it is. Sure, it can be really powerful in certain situations, but so can many other perks. It's situational enough that it's strength is justified.
---
Fuck you right. Alright closed-book brain game what is TI?
---
When you put on Nancy's and put a survivor to sleep at max range just before he manages to break LoS to you... I love it. Or when you run through a cornfield, spin 360s with the power up and sleep someone. With Nancy's the range of his power is like 24m or so, quite insane.
---
Also yeah, tunneling = bad freddy. A good freddy is a multitasking machine who has massive control over the match.
---
Not to mention that for non-tunneling killers, it benefits them for playing well and literally never having to see DS again.
---
Seriously. Why do these offerings exist? Why, as a killer, would I want everyone to start separate, all doing their own separate gens? That's like the worst case scenario for a killer. You want the survivors to all be together so you can scatter them and get all of them off gens for as long as possible. As a survivor, the only real benefit to starting the trial together is if you have Prove Thyself or something.
---
They need to just rework those offerings completely, or make them defunct like the moonlight offerings.
---
*secret*
---
A calculator company. 
---
Close enough. Territorial Imperative
---
Thats true. Forgot about that.
---
As if having counters is a bad thing.
---
Stare at flashing lights.
---
If you don't mori every survivor that uses an OchiDO-reference player name, do you even really care about protecting the children?
---
Right. Also worth mentioning im not looking for a hard nerf, in its current state I felt it was very strong. Just wanted to change it to make sense. But it turns out this became nothing more than another NOED discussion lol. Oh well I guess.
---
I meant to reply to the other guy. My apologies.
---
Fuckin doctor and his fetishes
---
So... we aren’t gonna talk about the killer in the same tier, that throws a tantrum, *and* is actually autistic or has some form of mental disability? No? Ok.
---
\-How can you talk about balance without talking about the Most Unbalanced things in DBD: The Game map, Iridescent Head, Frank's Mix Tape.
---
\-I think the game has become less balanced. Almost every Killer was above a 50% Kill Rate, and every Map had a 53% Kill Rate or Above and that was like 3 Survivor Nerf patches ago.  
---
\-The game will be completely balanced once Killers have a 50% Kill Rate, not when they have 55% Kills Rates and then get further buffed.  To say almost every other Killer should be buffed, when they already average more Kills than they would if they were completely balanced is amazing
---
\-NOED has an easy fix.   Make it so that the Perk goes away after Insta Downing 1 Survivor (or alternatively could have it last for 30 seconds or whatever).  A perk giving the ability to Insta down is very strong. No reason it should enable to Killer to insta down an entire team.
---
Thanks! 
---
You probably missed Wraith's new buff.
---
I hadn't played Jake in a while and decided to play him again the other day. The game I loaded into was with a doc and i had calm spirit. Everyone survived because I was able to continuously confuse doc and also gen jockey just a little bit. 10/10, prefer doc to legion anyday
---
Nah, Pig has that top tier stun noise.
---
The other day I deliberately killed myself on the hook just to give the other 3 no reason to not just get out.  Could tell no good would come of a rescue mission based on where I was hooked. 
---
I play Doc only for his giggle and gimp weapons.
---
why
---
His name would probably just be The Hell Priest, like it is in the Scarlet Gospels.
---
How is myers not A tier? And how is legion A tier whats with your list bro...?
---
Lobby times already take up to fifteen minutes majority of the time anyway worst case scenario I'll switch to killer to find a damn lobby even if I get my ass kicked. I play both and from both sides i can say lag sucks. Sucks ass to get lucky ass hits that shouldn't have hit and it sucks ass to get hit by those lucky hits. But dedicated servers most people don't realize wont fix hitboxes. It will fix the lag hits but not the broken hitboxes themselves. Your still gonna get hit through pallets and windows at a 50 ping. Not due to lag but because of hitboxes. Tested it many times before when I've had 50 ping and when someone in my lobby had 50 ping. Hits like that unless its totally bullshit like halfway across shack after vaulting a window and going down wont be fixed with servers. Only ones that will are the downright bullshit ones that shouldn't happen at all.
---
They could put an acronym list in the sidebar. I'm guessing there is a way to do some custom CSS to have a hover-over applied to acronyms from a lookup table....but the redesign and mobile make this not work for a lot of people. 
---
mrw using stbfl but they have woo and dwm but I counter with pgtw and noed while also using jj and ftoh addons
---
That's great
---
Here's a link to all the Piggy sounds, the stun "oink" is included: https://youtu.be/Wmg4HuEMJtU

Because they can look through the walls?LOL
---
And killer is spirit with rancor hahaha
---
It’s just gonna keep going on down the line. Eventually Adrenaline will be nerfed, I’m sure of that. Then sights be will probably be set on Borrowed Time..”it’s unfair to me that I can’t camp and secure my kill at the end of the game!!! 
---
-rep learn to play noob killer its so unfair that you run op and unfair perks. And no d strike and adrenaline are not op.
---
I know cool place right? Nobody gives a damn about what your trying to say. I dont even use the app nor care what goes on because it doesn't effect me. If I see something funny or cool I'll upvote it because it's cool or funny. Not just go "oh this app does bad things or this app is bad so anybody who has the audacity to disagree with me and like it is a shit pedophile"
---
Why isnt michael. Give me a reason.
---
Also agree. I main survivor but only play killer for daily rituals. I’ve never gotten more than one kill except for when I played nurse for the first time yesterday lol
---
This is without add-one or perks he’s still good just not as good as plague huntress or hag
---
God, you are hostile for no reason. 
---
It was just an example of why he sides more with killer. He doesn’t want to run perks that aren’t fair to the killer. 
---
Can you relax now? I’m sorry I questioned your favorite streamer. But you’re taking this way too far. 
---
I've wanted that exact idea for so long! It would be so creepy to have a bunch of creepy contorted mannequins just scattered across the map. You could look towards one and channel for a second to take control of it, leaving the last one in its previous spot. You could even place the "husks" to block certain windows or loops. 
---
Maybe the entity taking a more direct approach and taking one of the husks in the void (where survivors go when they lose all hope and become catatonic) for a spin. She just kind of piggybacks around their body and does all the smashing with spidery limbs.
---
Doesn't really fit the entity's schtick, though. She's more an an observer.
---
The Hag isn’t that intimidating. The Doctor tho... those [other sounds](https://youtu.be/VcJ0bPpBH7U) are creepy af. 
---
When you are the dwight and was already planni g on hiding in that locker either way
---
That's the point im trying to make though is the exact one you are lol. If survivors understood that camping is worse for the killer than good then killers would stop camping more often. This means that the hooked survivor unfortunately needs to take one for the team in order for this to happen. 
---
Idk why i'm getting so many downvotes all I'm saying is camping killers suck and are unfun.. 
---
So youre saying an insta down killer with stealth isnt better than 2 slower moving killers and one that is new. The doctor ia better than the hag. Come on bro.
---
I don't even watch Tru3 lmao in fact the last time I talked about him was in one of the posts when Plague was released on PTB and I made fun of him for thinking he's a mind game genius and criticized him for being a tunneler
---
"yes I'm being a toxic asshole" yeah dude please shut the fuck up
---
Then delete Claudette or Nea while you're at it for balance
---
I hope so lol 
---
I’m hoping today xdddd
---
That’s fantastic 😂
---
I’m refreshing the twitter like crazy

Worse case scenareo it's a Freddy or Scratch mirror myers with ranchor. Why is this the worst case scenario you ask? You can't see their aura, so you only know for sure when it is too late
---
Oh well. People are gross, who knew
---
still subbed to /r/funny?
---
100% up for Jack the Ripper
---
Oh hell ye, it IS a good thing. Change in the right direction is always good. Might be my bad in communicating, but all I'm trying to say is to educate people about potential problems with dedicated server. It just seems to be that people here who are unfamiliar with networking behind the scene think that dedicated servers will magically solve everything. I'm just trying to save them some frustration just in case it doesn't work out as expected.
---
👏👏👏
---
I’d imagine that he would have Tiffany (his ex girlfriend from The Bride of Chucky) be the main killer and maybe he would be like on her shoulder. 
---
The mori would be her kicking the survivor down and Chuky would leap from her back on top of the survivor and stab them to death. 
---
If you can’t tell, I haven’t watched past Bride of Chucky.
---
This is it. I’ve never thought it could be typed, but this is the sound he makes. 
---
Only if the killer actually tunnels. If not, DS is a dead perk.
---
This is like an amazing frank cosplay, you got all the details right, good job!
---
I wish he played Pokemon so I could make a shitty joke about capturing girls in pokeballs
---
What rank are you
---
Lmao 
---
(Your team )this ain’t no swf the point of the decisive change was to help non swf players and all it does in hinder them 🤦‍♂️ there was no change needed just prompts camping on the ground with leatherface 
---
Isn’t nurse above S tier?
---
So who is helping someone downed and camped for 60 sec ? They just go gens then no red pops then you played the whole game waiting on the floor because decisive too op 💀🤦‍♂️😂😂 
---
IIRC it's getting nerfed so that you can only use it if you are downed within a minute and a half or so after getting unhooked.

Might be the worlds memest build but legion with NoED and play with your food could possibly make this work. You could stack to 130. Of course that means finding the obsession early and having the discipline not to hit them until the end of the game, after the gates have opened and youve downed everyone else BUT it COULD hypothetically work. To be extra gimmicky you could add Save the best for last but i love the idea of legion sprinting at the obsession and they look back and hes gone multiple times in a game. Kind of a mind fuck.
---
That's only if the killer's camping their body. And if NOED pops, that's on the team as well because they clearly didn't do totems.
---
Oh Joey and Julie are both cool and I play them too, but Susie is best Legionnaire.
---
As for Frank and his Mixtape, they can both go suck on a lemon.
---
What are you even on about 
---
It seems to be based off of Jack the Ripper, so I think "The Ripper" would suit him fine.
---
He needs to put out the fires, what do you think he's doing?
---
She would have if there'd been a window between them.
---
The same is true to a lesser degree for Rancor. You can get them more easily later, so it's not worth trying very hard to kill them early.
---
killers should not see the survirvors either. your comment is so fucking true it hurts.
---
I was in this one game yesterday when the gen popped and the killer hit someone and they had NOED.  Booked it to the exit gate but since I'm running WGLF and only had two tokens and UE I decided to try and sneak back.  Killer must have been running BBQ tho because he came right at me.  I guess it could have been SFTS but I don't think I hit any crows.  
---
Anyways I got the guy unhooked with BT and the killer looped right back but he managed to DH.  I went down but since I wasn't running DS it was pretty much over.  Everyone else just dipped.
---
I like to think of the Legion as Roman soldiers. Honestly, his mixtape has a few good rhymes so I’m fine with it. 
---
In most games NOED goes down after the first down tho
---
Spirit is scary
---
And I love her
---
The only one bitching about something here is you. Why would you even bring swf-issue into this argument? This has nothing to do with dedicated servers. 
---
Killing the obsession when the killer has no obsession perk does nothing to benefit the killer right? 
---
Im not trying to say pips are everything that's just how the game rewards winning and losing currently. I heard theres some rank 1 reward the devs are talking about putting in. This would be a step in the right direction for people to care about pips.
---
Could say the same about ps4 killers 
---
I don't know what you've said but if it's about slugging there is another perk for that
---
Fred's too D:
---
fair point there are a lot of sweaty killers in ps4 
---
Adrenaline is op now??? 
---
WTF!
---
Xbox plebs are just sipping their tea laughing.
---
Depends on the killer of course. Sometimes I start with 2 DC's and it's a toss up between the killer being friendly or not. It's not uncommon for the killer to feel bad when players DC early on in the game. It really does make the match impossible when 5 gens are needed and one DCs because they got caught first, or figure out it's a Nurse, Bubba or Legion.
---
Hopefully after Dedicated Servers are implemented, leavers will get a penalty for leaving the game so it will be less common that players DC out of pettiness.
---
Depends what mood I’m in, a lot of times I’m like “I’ve waited 20 minutes to be put into a match just to be put on a hook for 5 minutes” -_- 
---
The funny part is, I don't even remember if the last person got the hatch or not
---
its bc barely anybody thinks xbox is relevant 😔
---
Nea and Dwight playing a fun game of leapfrog after escaping.
---
Am I missing something here?
---
Any decent survivor perk Is “OP” to killers LOL
---
I know I fucking hate coldwind farm. Also can't see through corn very well anymore.
---
Everyone seems to run the same shit. I like playing around with different perks and builds. I have 1200 hours. I don’t care about ranking up or down. I just play for fun.
---
An ebony mori nurse with range addons is the most broken thing in the game. Nothing suevivors have even compares anymorw
---
That'd be pretty nice.
---
*Runs STBFL, PWYF, and rancor. Still tunnels and kills you first.*
---
How about:
---
&gt;At the beginning of the trial, (you)/(all survivors) are notified of the killer's location.
---
&gt;At the beginning of the trial, you are notified of (one survivor's)/(all survivors') location(s).
---
Not an aura, but the "explosion with a generic silhouette" like you get from doctor screams. The offering would still be secret. Arguably quite powerful, but as long as Moris exist, that evidently doesn't matter.
---
The bonus idea sounds nice,but I want to be able to dc against scumbag killers while getting carried to deny their bbq stack(in case they have that perk)
---
Lol, if the Legion are Legionnaires, who is the Senate? Doctor?
---
Damn son
---
I used to nearly always be found first too because I’d start on the nearest gen right away. Now I’ve learned to wait for the killer to patrol the area I’m in before I start working on a gen and it’s improved things a lot. 
---
I've mastered the art of clicking my daily and closing the chat before the survivors can say anything.
---
Getting called shit when you got 3 of them is quite a thing to witness. 
---
They're supposed to be fixing Freddy tho. I don't have too much of an issue with him now, bit making it possible to get 4k with him would be great. I use Freddy a lot. 
---
Cant wait to puke on Claudettes as the new killer tbh
---
Which ones you need help with, bruh?
---
They're still in a poor state.
---
But they've buffed them since then. Legion suffered from a Freddy problem. Where's their whole playstyle is the most hated parts of the game;
---
-  Doctor/freddy= 
---
 - Slowing down the game
---
 - M1 stimulator
---
  - Easy anti stealth hunting kit
---
- Nurse= anti chase build as you cannot use windows and pallets against them. 
---
 - that would be fine and all but when you couple it with the ability having no way of countering it via dodging, mind gaming as well as legion not getting punished but rather rewarded for missing attacks. 
---
     - So it can feel like you're playing against a wallmart nurse who requires no skill to play, because at least for a nurse that power comes with a great learning curve and some punishment if you don't bring your a game.
---
     - there used to be some play around the pallet vaults and momentum, but that was removed when they started buffing them because it was way too "weird" for the survivors to be vaulting around.
---
...and the only really way you can get any effective use out of the killer is by doing the lame moon walking exploits.
---
They're really down there in terms of how effective they are are as a killer, everyone would like to see them be viable in the end myself included. But where they stand right now ergh. Its not a really good look.
---
Makes you wonder how did they go from great killers like clown and spirit to the mess that is legion.
---
From what we've been seeing online even internally among the devs there is a divide on how satisfied they are with the legion. 
---
They're on the right track with Plague thankfully having learned what not to do after Legion but its a shame that we'd probably see another Wraith/Hag and Freddy situation where the killer will likely be left in the back of the fridge until they get rebuild/reworked. 
---
I rarely encounter people using that perk tbh. 
---
I like the list but don’t agree on the hag.  I think she is weak.  The traps aren’t great.  I would put MM over hag.  But nice job with the Pig being up there.  Very underrated. Extremely fun killer to play as well.  BUBBA is not F tier.  You put the right basement build on him and he’s solid.  
---
BHVR finally working on the balance changes we want
---
Thank you 
---
u/survivorscrytoomuch immediately thought of you when I saw this :-)
---
Then the end game turns into protect the president 
---
So i need ds and unbreakable is what your saying .... instead of just having ds ....
---
Because they don't know how to use his ability properly, they just see "7 seconds? Yeah that's terrible"
---
I like Pig being higher than most.  She has a steep learning curve, not as bad as nurse but once mastered I think she can be at least a tier 2 killer.
---
Hmm i was wondering if i was going to get one of these. I thought survivors only get these for bitching about killers. Why else post on this reddit if not for memes or bitching about something?
---
All good homie &lt;3
---
Yeah, cause you as the killer don’t have the ability to down and hook survivors who take the risk to stay injured, right? How about getting some kills before the gens are done? You say just cleanse totems, I tell you just kill survivors. Let’s be real, if you have quad Adrenaline popping you, you had a bad game up to that point and can only blame yourself. The perk should be strong because actually benefiting from it is so situational. Lots of times you’ll die beforehand, or won’t even be injured or in chase to where you even benefit from the speed boost. It’s just very popular because when it does work for you, it’s powerful. It’s a risk/reward....same as NOED.
---
With that being said, the issue as it pertains to Freddy is understandable. Other than that, it’s perfectly fine.
---
i play on xbox too sksksk
---
Totally agree; I've been cussed out by more than 20 individual people on PS4 and only 2 individual people on PC: both of whom I met as a Survivor rather than a Killer.
---
Cause she's the go to for toxicity plus Neas seem to abuse Urban Evasion a lot
---
If I'm being camped I stay alive as long as possible to waste the killer's time.Only problem I have with camping is with my fellow survivors who don't do gens or ones who dive to save me but end getting hooked.
---
Welcome!  Nice list!
---
yeah you definitely just threw a temper tantrum on the internet about claudette.. all I said was i thought of user survivorscrytoomuch. No idea what you’re expecting from me
---
Sexy time has begun
---
Is it a disgusting truth? These companies hire people with families and bills to pay just like you. Of course they have the main goal of making money. So ridiculous. So much time, effort, and money goes into making video games. You’d probably think someone who said it was gross that you do your job for money is stupid and out of touch. 
---
Haha yesss! It's because the frames are so bad, survivors can make moves that would never work on PC. The frames always drop at the worst time it's so easy to miss as killer
---
I think doc's is spookiest actually, because he sounds like he likes it. 
---
You have to realize youre putting 7 seconds into an investment. Yes, 7 seconds is a while. However, for the 7 seconds, you get valuable information on where your prey is heading and where other survivors are (you can see them waking up with help of a teammate). You simply don't have to commit to a chase even when you first sleep someone, and in most cases, it's worth sleeping multiple people compared to sleeping one and just chasing them. His ability is not a hinderence if you use it well. While they're in the dream world, unless they wake up within 5 seconds of falling asleep, which is actually rarer than people lead you to believe, the "7 seconds that add up" will be repaid to you by the fact that they'll take forever to complete a gen until they wake up.
---
&gt;That's like saying not to DC when getting tunneled/moried 
---
Yeah... thats exactly the same, you should not DC. I'd also say you shouldn't DC if the killer is slugging to make sure the hatch doesn't open.
---
I see DCing on the same level as lag switching and glitching. You are mis using a game mechanic to gain an advantage.
---
From worse to least:
---
1. Hacking
---
2. Exploits, DCing, lag switching
---
3. Tunneling, camping, sandbagging, early suicide on hook (first/second hook of the match and you suicide), teabagging
---
4. Mori
---
5. Looping, slugging, destroying hooks
---
6. Running away from the killer, hitting a survivor, hooking a survivor, doing generators, cleansing totems, opening exit gates
---
Where
---
1-2: don't do these things, people who do these things (on a regular basis) deserve a ban in my opinion
---
3-4: try to keep it time, there is a time and place for these things, but don't make a habit out of doing thse things, they potentially ruin the experience for other people
---
5-6: nomal gameplay, free to do so at any time you like
---
And while some would argue to move certain things around, I don't think any of these things is more than 1 place off.
---
I just realised I started drifting away from the point Inwas trying to make. Basically, the only time you are allowed to DC is when the other side does an equally bad or worse thing (hacking, exploits and lag switching). DCing is also ok in my opinion if it's not a full game as long as you do it at the beginning and if it doesn't screw over your teammates for doing so.
---
currently i do not, not sure which social media to make a page on instagram or facebook
---
doktors stun is like hes having weak knees, which is pretty accurate representation of whats happening
---
Those are *completely* amazing! I really want that Self Care charm.
---
You can't compare him to another killer in that sense though. You're rarely just walking up to survivors with another killer and hitting them, at least not good survivors. Those 7 seconds should work to your advantage if you know how the dream transition works. It's a free hit almost every time to start the chase. He has plenty of problems, but the the dream transition is not one of them. 
---
You're definitely one of the best DbD artists out there! Lovely work like always!
---
I know alot of people who would LOVE a Scream chapter. I'd be very disappointed if they decided to make Ghostface a Legion cosmetic, especially considering the current state of Legion. There's so much potential for Ghostface and Sidney in the game. 
---
Most Legions I play against (Rank 10) hit me then run off to get someone else. I just self-care to 99% then finish when he’s coming to hit ‘em with that bamboozle.
---
You're not wrong, and usually they are the most toxic and salty ones like, in PC and xbox you find like a couple every 10-20 games, on ps4 you find at least 5 in every 10 games
---
You did not just do that.
---
'Hey fuck you guys okay? i did like half of the godamn gens while yall were fucking around! godamnit...

Imagine getting downvoted for being against stale spam "memes".
---
This sub..
---
I don't think Huntress' stun is that intimidating personally. Basically a 5 year old throwing a tantrum with a more developed voice. I also don't think clown should be that high, he basically just lets out a raspy laugh from the help of his deteriorating lungs.
---
Thank you for posting this, I really love it! That Meg’s voice is priceless
---
Hmm. Gonna be that guy and say I disagree.
---
Before I knew much about legion I had already decided that he didn't look like a killer. It is literally just a 'hoodie' off the streets with a knife. Makes me see him as a pathetic little cunt I want to punch in the nose rather than a killer. Like really... he/she/they is stood along side Kruger, Leatherface, The Pig.... Things that might make you scream. Not shout..
---
"What you doing mate - stealing hubcaps off cars again, get the fuck outa here before I call your parents!.... little shits"
---
...But at least i still had hope for him outside of the 'looks' department. I logged on to reddit and noticed the sheer unrelenting hate for every practical aspect.
---
Like I said right circumstance, you can also get lucky when an entire team hook dives 
---
Aww thank you so much, my friend!
---
I think they should give some auric cells as rank rewards. Not necessarily enough to buy an outfit every month, but enough to work towards some. 
---
That way, people can slowly work towards some of the auric cell only outfits. 
---
I understand what you mean, especially at higher ranks, leading a killer for a merry chase should be something you can do.
---
Personally, I can usually take the killer for a long chase if I get caught, but I try not to get caught because it's easier for me to complete objectives if I'm not getting into a long chase, and since I solo queue most of the time I can't guarantee anyone will come rescue me if I get hooked... or even guarantee anyone will work on generators while I'm being chased... lol.
---
My favorite thing to do, though, is to hide behind a nearby rock or tree when the killer comes to my generator and just slowly crawl around it as they check the area so they never see me. p:
---
Oh and I should say I don't play Claudette or run UE most games. I usually run Feng Min or Kate, and will be running the new survivor once she hits console. :)
---
“I’m not listening!”
---
I agree that it's possible she did and that would be like how The Wraith killed people and The Nurse killed people before disappearing, but it's also possible the entity just took her then. 
---
We're not really sure, and I'm not sure the entity is some...thing to be trusted to make good on its promises.
---
Their concept makes me worry that they won't do Ghostface because they're "too similar".
---
Killers with bad internet, that helps them get kills: \*slightly annoyed*
---
Killers who lagswitch: \*visibly angry*
---
Killers who immediately exit the endgame lobby so that nobody can say anything mean about them: \*openly sobbing and wailing, rocking back and forth in the fetal position*
---
Hes still not "wait to hit people" tier. Leatherface is shit but hes the same tier as trapper etc not freddy
---
You're welcome 🖤 glad you like it 
---
Oh, imagine this with the Thanatophobia buff.
---
Haha, well said. I completely agree. (: 
---
It would be cool. Giving the killer an idea on where to go at the start of the match while inversely letting the survivors know where the killer and each other are.
---
I suggest having it last during the 360 camera pan.
---
Freddy isnt that bad, there are just a lot of people who ignore the benefits because "7 seconds bad"
---
Love it. It's basically a better bitter murmur. Not a super meta perk but fits in with fun builds and definitely helps you even if you are trying to win 
---
Wait, where can I see those discounts? Or is this only in America
---
It's implied she made an oath to the entity, whether or not the entity just took her OR reanimated her and let her kill her father whom the entity seemed to be controlling as well is a bit of a leap.
---
I love four-man SWFs when they aren't the toxic "We're gonna finish all five gens in 3 minutes and then leave because we have one runner who knows frame exploits" SWFs.
---
Abusing mid teir perks, now I’ve heard it all
---
Doesn't the doctor just shock you before you hit a pallet? He can put you in a situation where you are guaranteed to take a hit even though you're safely behind pallets and windows
---
If it were a movie I'd cheer her on so hard
---
I main him and have a ton of time invested in him at high ranks (for what it's worth). In my opinion, his biggest problems come down to RNG and how it affects the viability of his power. 
---
Picture this scenario: You have someone asleep that you're chasing. They're injured but near a fairly strong tile and you don't have any perks to help in a chase. Discordance shows that two or more people are working on a gen relatively close to you. Is it worth it to go put those survivors to sleep and then go back and snipe the injured survivor? Will the survivors on the gen wake up by the time you down the injured survivor? Will the injured survivor wake up by the time you get back? Will everyone wake up and effectively undo all the work you've done up that point? The answer: Who the fuck knows? It's up to RNG and whether they get skill checks or not. 
---
Point being: Freddy is just an M1 killer with no chase potential if you don't use his power on multiple survivors, but there will absolutely be games where you just spin your wheels putting people to sleep only to have them immediately wake up through no fault of your own. 
---
People point to the 7 second dream transition, but this is an advantage to an experienced Freddy player in most scenarios. You can use Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, etc., for chase help, but you lose tracking potential, and you really need multiple survivors to be asleep for him to realize his full potential. He can be very strong, but sometimes RNG just doesn't allow it. 
---
I always believed that, but so many people have it nowadays where there is S+ and then ‘SS’, the equivalent of SS in Dead by Daylight would be a guaranteed 4K every match without fail.
---
Yeah i know but its better use with double fatigue addons
---
Oh the horror! Not Level 15 Thug!!!
---
I think it gets a lot of people, I've probably fallen for it a lot as killer too. That's fair about Claudette, especially P3 Claudette can be *really* difficult to see.. I have a lot of cosmetics so my Claudette is brightly dressed and has purple hair though lol so I can't hide from anything as her p: I'm very fashion-oriented with my survivors, though.. there's nothing like hiding from the killer successfully while playing Nea with neon pink hair and a neon pink accented shirt lol.
---
Yeah no! I do my best to be an asset to my team.. do gens, get saves, break totems etc. I mostly commented because I felt like your op kind of implied that no survivors who prefer stealth do gens and was like "wait, but *I* use stealth and do gens!" p:
---
What will dedicated servers actually fix though? Why not take the time to fix your game, rework freddy, rework legion, rework nurse just a few things they could do with that money instead of something g that will have suuuuch small benefits as "yerrrrr derdicarted serrrrrveerrrrrs"
---
I’m sorry, but... you’ve heard Spirit’s stun sound right?? So not intimidating LOL 
---
Piggy gonna tickle wickle. Amazing.
---
I have my suspicions about why people feel that way, but I won't say p: but yeah, it's not that bad especially since most groups have only one runner and if you go after their friends who are working on generators they're helpless..
---
The feeling of accomplishment when you beat a 4k against a really strong swf team is amazing it's true.
---
I've started noticing how you people on this sub always hide your ranks and player levels.. it's kinda funny
---
Poor Mommy she just needs a hug.
---
Idk, when I am surviving and I physically run into the killer as they're attacking and I don't get hit, it feels kind of like cheating. It's not, it's just knowing the killer's animation timing, but that doesn't make it feel better on the other end as killer. I main survivor, so 🤷‍♂️. 
---
haha this is gold!
---
You know how many times Neas use that shit to work on gens in secret and slip away? That shit is annoying
---
Rockefeller Street, the Nightcore remix.
---
And it would be a trade of bringing that instead of a mori.
---
That’s why I said traditional haha. The tiers can be listed as whatever the person wants, but those are he exception, not the norm. 
---
I mean I'm not saying it's cheating but there are movement patterns that work on console that would never work on ps4
---
A lot of good perks rely on synergy:
---
* Dance with me + Q&amp;Q + Lithe 
---
* Head on + Q&amp;Q + Dance with me + Iron Will
---
* Spirit Fury + Enduring + Brutal Strength
---
* etc.
---
Actually, Unbreakable was good in combo with DS even before the DS nerf
---
Can confirm. It’s even like that in my friends group. One of my friends and I usually tank for the other two. If the other two get chased too much, they usually die or we die saving them.
---

---
and also ask the OP if it's okay since it's their original content.
---
Ick.
---
&gt; «I might feel bad about survivor-side lag if 90% of the games I played didn't have at least two on voice comms with each other.  Voice comms are such a huge advantage that the game needs to be balanced around.  Way more of an advantage than killers ever got from lag.»
---
&gt; «Didnt bring up swf.»
---
Yeah okay buddy. 
---
and that's why whenever I play legion, (I rarely do, don't go insane lmao) I spare the Jeff if there is one. 
---
Yeah i mean pretty much. i think it just kills the fun. People complain too much when they lose but there are other ways to have fun that aren't winning and i think those are the things people should be complaining about. NOED and DS complaints are for people who care about winning too much
---
Not even the sweatiest swf group can forget their loyalty to each other p: when I play swf (rarely) I'm the same way though.. I'll try to lead the killer on the longest chase I can because my friends I play with aren't as good in a chase as I am, and if they get caught I'll kill myself trying to save them.
---
well i say this because urban evasion claudettes are doing this more than 50% of the time lol
---
Welp, time to hurry up and cap on BP in preperation. Figured I had until Thursday.
---
You might be my long lost brother. I can relate to this for the full 100%. 
---
Well maybe you should read the whole conversation? The original poster was crying about “swf are more in advantage then killer lagging”. 
---
I wouldnt call them toxic,but i do question why they even play the game.  The game is really all about the chases, unless some people find doing gens exciting and fun?
---
To be fair though, on console the frames can also make it so that killer hits that absolutely should not connect do. It's not something that only survivors can do..
---
They're fine
---
For them it's fun to be stealthy and hide. Just because something isn't fun for you, it doesn't mean it's not fun for someone else. Some find fishing boring, others find it fascinating. Some people like country, some people like rock'n'roll. Catch my drift?
---
My reaction when using save the best for last but they have windows of opportunity and dance with me but I counter with pop goes the weasel (I don't know how that counters but ok lmao) and noed while also using Judith's Journal(?) and fragrant tuft of hair.
---
That was me! I love using weird acryonyms. ☺️☺️
---
The one I can think of off the top of my head is when I'll visibly see Huntress's hatchet hit the ground several feet to one side of me but somehow still be injured by it, or if I run around a corner but somehow the killer is still able to hit me from the other side of the corner, or when you're being chased and the killer somehow hits you despite being *way* too far behind you.
---
His problem is he thinks DBD is a competitive game.
---
This is much closer to Mario Party than Counterstrike. Just because there's a ranking system and they have different colors doesn't mean it's a competitive game.
---
Without add ons and perks legion is pretty fucking bad. Not bad as Freddy mind you but still bad.
---
Go and hug her and watch yourself get crushed lol
---
Haha just like some people find camping fun right (;
---
I just hoard the items, i don't even use em, i just like too look at them, ya know? :P
---
Now we can lag together!
---
That's when I turn from the most altruistic person to "I'm getting out at any cost", good luck teammate!
---
What makes people say "lag switch" is they have green ping in lobby, then as soon as the killer starts chasing them they start rubber banding. But that's not always a lag switch either, that's just a killer with wifi internet.
---
Id use it as motivation to get better at the game :) 
---
Clown's intimidating? Nah his is funny. And Huntress ain't scary either more like a kid throwing a hissy fit
---
so playing Hag?
---
You got me....I was just looking for the ones with the longest names. 
---
Err, no man....Pop Goes The Weasel totally counters Windows of Opportunity since the 1.5.43.1.88 patch.
---
So the liberals are going to hate that the 4-1 get 1000 when obviously it should be evenly distributed to everyone..  
---
Do you receive any penalty or is it just like the game never happened?
---
-Loot a chest
---
-Green Toolbox
---
-Do the gens faster
---
-Smile at you

[I swear...](https://i.imgur.com/RgwjfXK.png)
---
Really? It only motivates me to not play killer since it's so easy for survivors to do. 
---
What about the console update? Lmao sad
---
i think the devs have stated in the past that they will likely never do non-humanoid killers.
---
I swear i'm always the obsession when there's no survivor obsession perks in the game :/
---
Candyman and Pinhead please.
---
Legion actually put this over the clowns vhs porn 
---
not saying he's good or bad, saying they're absolute cancer lmao. he's boring to play and boring to play against. 
---
1. i know Myers was released when Behaviour was still under Starbreeze, but IIRC the Pig was released after they left (correct me if i'm wrong), so i doubt it's a question of money and rather a question of how the mechanics might work and if they can even get the property in question licensed to them.
---
2. all killers are camping killers if you play them that way.
---
Whenever survivors burn the offering i know i could end the game before a single gen was done.
---
Good stuff!
---
Well until a survivor can put a killer on the hook and sacrifice them, Id say killers are doing just fine
---
Oh fuck, sorry. I was the one confused lol carry on.
---
I think Hag is really strong, but she has very different gameplay. You basically are defending some part of the map and don't care about another, and trapping the shit out of loops. People are going down really quickly, and then 3gen comes for the remaining ones.
---
I'll admit to being guilty of this, to an extent.  
---
If I get a good toolbox with good add-ons, I'll be able to repair the gens faster, making up the time.
---
If I get a good medkit with instant heal, I'll be able to unhook you and heal you instantly (or be able to heal myself instantly so I can run the killer myself for a bit)
---
If I get a key I can get a couple of us out without needing the last couple of gens (which has actually helped me rescue people)
---
If I get a flashlight I'll leave it in the box unless it's a hag, you can have it!
---
If I get a map I get to farm points by running around and getting gens or other objectives... ok that one is a bit greedy. 
---
I only bought legion because both the killer and survivor looked cool. Jeff is pretty much where I see myself in some years, and the legion are a bunch of edgy teens who do edgy stuff. Favourite themed chapter, second least favourite chapter character-wise. Kinda a cash grab, but I don't regret buying it. 
---
I just run a full on slug build when a certain SWF joins my lobby ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah i agree 100%
---
I used to, but I quickly realized if I had to be nice and do a farm game because a Survivor d/c'd /rage quit/ just plain didn't load in I would spend more time making sure the survivors had fun than myself. 
---
Now I just do my best to end the game quickly.  Whether the remaining players want to try or not it's up to them.  If they get upset they can complain to the people who made it lopsided in the first place.
---
Really think they are done with licensed killers.     
---
Looks like a Claudette starved of pallets to me 
---
The goal of golf is to play less golf. Let that sink in
---
Hmm I thought it was 110 even then. Doesn't change my point tho, which is he still takes skill to play well.

---
"I'm not listening!"
---
My favourite is when people immediately downvote questions new people have about the legion
---
Nea has become Ezio and is using a flashlight instead of a hidden blade
---
When the PTB first launched, at maximum sickness a really neat black and green effect would cover the edges of the screen, effectively reducing your Field of View.  Apparently is was a glitch, but it made her a lot more terrifying at loops.
---
Thats all great, except none of these things can be relied on. You can always just get out of the terror radius immediately. If someone gets hit when youre anywhere near them, youre hit too. None of this shit works unless the person playing them is literally complete trash.  
---
These are neat! I have spent too much money lately to spend $40, but good luck to your friend!
---
Correct, in that case the survivor would have to be using a Obsession perk from [**Laurie**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Laurie) either unlocked from her or the shrine, [**Decisive Strike**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Decisive_Strike), [**Object Of Obsession**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Object_Of_Obsession), or [**Sole Survivor**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Sole_Survivor).  I looked and unless I missed it that haven't added any Obsession perks for survivors.
---
Side note: They have added killer ones besides the [**Shape's**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shape) **:** [**Save The Best For Last**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Save_The_Best_For_Last), [**Play With Your Food**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Play_With_Your_Food), or [**Dying Light**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dying_Light), they did add [**Rancor**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rancor) from the [**Spirit**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spirit) and [**Dark Devotion**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dark_Devotion) from the  [**Plague**](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Plague)**.**

You must have about 100~ hours eh?
---
Now that the straps are basically on her base kit, she's pretty much not add-on dependent. Almost all of them are just to help you to put a bandaid on some aspects of her that you aren't good with or to stall the game even more just a little bit.
---
You can say that she is somewhat perk dependent tho. Unless she's using a tracking perk, like Whispers, Surveillance, NC etc, it may be counterproductive to crouch unless you're going to use an ambush to force the Survivor out of a safe loop.
---
I don't understand how Hag could be so perk dependent tho. Ofc she's gonna be a heavy tunneler but nowadays after the buffs she's a much better Killer. Her addons are extremely important when facing good Survivors tho, so I'm not sure about her position either. Maybe B-.

I'd much prefer Rancor than Dying Light, it's a bit thrilling and is mostly active during the end. Had a Huntress yesterday running Dying Light and a "kill first person hooked" mori, and they were lucky enough to run right into me from the start (I was obsession). Never been tunneled so hard, felt pretty bad man. 
---
Gotta keep 10 purple flashlights at least. Just incase there's an emergency.
---
[https://youtu.be/SvFM-M2q9D0?t=2](https://youtu.be/SvFM-M2q9D0?t=2)
---
I already found the hatch and I have a key, I was just there to annoy the killer before escaping via the hatch
---
Im sorry. I love this game so much. Im like part of a cult about this game.
---
After over 1000 hours in the game, you begin to realise its really not that good. 
---
Please dont get tattoos. You will regret them so much. Mabey not now, but in years to come. Please stop. 
---
I love this game so much, but I beg you to think about it a little more. Please decide if a tattoo is really what you want. I look at these tattoo post and I feel so bad, not proud of a community where people are permanently marking themselves.
---
I know I will get a lot of downvotes, but please think about your body. I dont have a say in what you do with your body...

thanks for clarifying the situation &lt;3

Dlcs are at the bottom in the dlc section.
---
Pretty accurate honestly. Any loss results in a complaint about survivors. I heard the guy complain about survivors genrushing him as Huntress on Lerys. Cause yeah, I’m sure an absolutely terrible map for Huntress had nothing to do with....it’s gotta be the  gen speed!
---
Mmmm I love the taste of survivor tears
---
I do whatever I want, you don't have any power against me now Ms. Fritz
---
Reported for shaming another player in the game, where he is clearly better than you. Grow up and get a life sweetheart.
---
Question is do they release console and pc at the same time? Remember what happened with Clown.
---
I really like this idea. I still think Shroud of Union (the spawn beside ONE person) offering is good if you're running buff perks like Prove Thyself but after the Leader nerf there's no reason to run Shroud of Union, and unless it's a 4 man Dwight squad or you want the Survivors to think you have a Mori there's no reason to burn a Shroud of Separation. (And honestly just bring a Yellow mori instead because at least the Yellow mori won't cuck you.)
---
Unless theyve fixed it, those add ons have been glitched since release and atleast as of July its still been that way

It’s a lot of fun to play in one, not always a long of fun to play against one.

Depends on if puking on a downd survivor infects them. If it does then sure. It's super viable

Yeah....  not really
---
You just won a free ride on the magic foo bus! 
---
It’s not something that happens all the time but there are some who are like this. 
---
Then there are ones like I had last night. There was a Feng who had spawned in a tree, like... she was in the trunk and high up. The killer messaged her after the rest of us were dead and said if she could get out of the tree, she could have the hatch. Now not a single gen had been done but after mashing buttons or something, she finally dropped from the tree and started doing a gen. 
---
She got about halfway thru the first gen when the killed downed her and hooked her. When I messaged him and asked why he did that to her, he responded “it was funny”  😑

Iridiscent shards? They don't cost money?
---
No I’m pretty sure he killed *everyone* at his work. Not just the POWs. My understanding is he went on a killing spree at his base and wiped everyone out. While that was going on he probably experimented on himself  
---
I can’t find your til too!!!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Maybe that blog is a little hit or miss then? 
---
thanks i'll be sure to save it, whoops i mean forward it
---
it's also the noise they make when cancelling frenzy, so you get to hear it quite a lot (legion main btw)
---
Doc has counterplay. 
---
I'd say yes, if you look, that survivor was already sick/broken. Streamer dropped the survivor JUST to puke on them for no real purpose other than to get a cheap laugh out of it, unnecessary.
---
But that's just my opinion.
---
But it isn't that hard to pull these off.
---
NOTHING can be relied on. If we go by that logic, then Nurse should be outright removed. With these tips, you can at least stall the game for Legion. You can make getting hooks a lot harder, and by playing more smart (I.E mind games) you can make a legion waste their Feral before they get good work done.
---
Of course, good teamwork is always the best counter though. Communication shuts down near every killer.
---
I'd say that these have saved me at least half if not more of the time going up against stabby clan.
---
I did a joke based on your grammatical/math critic, I don't really care about simplifying it, hence the joke.
---
Hitboxes and ping are 2 different things.
---
My favorite is OoO
---
At least it's an Avatar meme 
---
honestly that's more intimidating IMO, same with Doctor because he just giggles instead of sounding like he's in pain.
---
I don't think we will ever see him. Would propably be too similiar to Legion. But who knows...
---
Downvoted and already DCed. 
---
Good to know that you know exactly who is better than me. And do you butthurt really think I care about your stupid report? XDD
---
I used to like watching him. He used to make good plays and be positive. It seems like he hates the game now and is generally unhappy. Which results in more complaints. You can see something similar with No0b3 too. But hes stated it outloud (made a whole video about it) that the game is starting to suck and they're not providing anything genuinely more interesting to the game.
---
Your memes are bad.
---
I'll keep my eye out :P was dissapointed to find no DBD cosplayers last year.
---
I'm still beyond confused why we got a Jamacian guy that throws pebbles in our Japanese Chapter. I mean it was already pretty weird that we got a English Survivor (David) in our "Russian" Chapter (Lullaby for The Dark) but Shattered Bloodlines was so deeply engrained in Japanese culture while Lullaby for The Dark kinda had a Russian Killer as a fun tidbit. Shattered Bloodlines has a purely Japanese concept for a Killer (the concept of a vengeful spirit of a woman who was unjustly murdered - it's a piece of pure Japanese mythos) with a purely Japanese map (traditional zen garden + Japanese house instead of generic forest with generic wood cabin) and we even got purely Japanese cosmetics for other Survivors and a Killer. But we get a fucking Jamacian guy with a "Canadian Tuxedo" as our Survivor?
---
It would be like if Darkness Among Us gave us a Sombrero-wearing Mexican as the Survivor, or if Curtain Call (the distinctly "American" chapter) came with a Survivor from Brazil.
---
it takes too much coding to do anything. 
---
&gt;ReplyGive AwardsharereportSave
---
can you even speak English? :)
---
I don’t know why it has to be such a secret for when they are gonna release a chapter. 
---
Like The Ripper or something.
---
ScottJund and Zubat are much better killers as far as streamers go. I also don’t hear them constantly making excuses. They might complain about a map for a particular killer, which is totally understandable, but that’s about it. 
---
It’s a map add on called Glass Bead. It allows you to create a beacon (column of light) that ONLY survivors can see. 
---
HOWEVER, you cannot simply equip it to use it, since it is a secondary action. 
---
You have to use the Map (M2), and then hit the secondary action button (space bar) to make it appear. 
---
Good New is, you don’t have to wait for the entire map to charge up before setting your beacon. 
---
I mostly use it to show what gens I’m at so other survivors will join me, or to mark totems if I’m somehow unable to complete them, OR to mark the hatch. 
---
Hope that helps. :)
---
The entity took the gang while they were teenagers after that night of the murder. Then years later when Jeff came back around he was grabbed through the same hole.
---
Whipity whine this comment is now mine
---
Is it a cheap laugh? Yeah, but I don't find it toxic. Toxic would be detrimental to the flow of the game, at least to me. This is just stupid fun that doesn't really affect that much. 
---
Life's tough.
---
haha right? Played with a bunch of different rank killers/survivors all last night so there were some interesting games. As a console player though I'm not complaining because at least I'm finally getting matches instead of lobby simulator 2019.
---
Since you didn't respect the latency and dropped it too late. I fall for it alot too
---
hate is good for the gameplay tho, makes it more immersive
---
I hate when this happens because I suddenly feel compelled to play far more immersed on the off chance it's Dying Light.
---
80+30=100 quick maths
---
I’m sorry but that’s not a valid excuse for playing bad entire the game, and all I saw in this clip was a leather that had multiple opportunities to either trade a hook with someone or get 2 people but failed and this is the result 
---
As a kid Chucky was scary.  As an adult, I don't find him scary anymore.  Sure, the supernatural aspect of him is suspect, and his ability to "blend in with toys" gives him surprise. 
---
But I just can't find any killer that I could punt terrifying.
---
Yes, he failed because that isbwhat he tried to do, if he didn't move, there would have been no resque
---
&gt;Stand on a rock until you d/c
---
How have the bans been lately m8
---
You are correct that you earn points by playing matches and leveling up your devotion (the circle filling with yellow on the end match screen). It takes 9000 to get the killer you’re talking about, which does take a little bit to get, but goes by fast if playing regularly. You can also buy her with real money, about $5-10 if I remember correctly.
---
I can agree to this but most of the time I will allow the last person to escape unless their being toxic  
---
Yeah, it's best to work on a totem or something instead of jumping straight on a gen if you don't want to be found first but you still want to be useful
---
IMO, I'd switch Pig and Huntress.
---
But they're being automatically reported, you're just filing a pointless report that will waste their time...
---
Plague should be coming out March 20th or so
---
Yeah, it’s either that or he’s just catering to his fanbase, which seems to definitely be the complaining killer main types. Im sure ego also has something to do with it too. When he loses it’s something wrong with the game, when he wins it’s something crazy like “just beat the best 4 man SWF from Japan ever, guys!”
---
Frame exploits? Care to explain.
---
That's Claudette. 
---
Yeah right. I somehow wouldve offended somebody and got banned for posting a rich white guy. 
---
This again 
---
The moment the killer gets the said survivor down the doors get unblocked and if the (soon to be)hooked survivor is either in the first or 2nd stage he can still be saved xD
---
Lighten up dude haha 
---
Japanese crops are worse honestly
---
Dlc doesn't drop on Wednesdays. It'd either tomorrow or next Tuesday
---
Honestly I think Legion takes the crown from Freddy as worst killer.
---
My first game baxk playing in like 6 months was this... While being rank 20.  Ugh. 
---
Yah your right, now days yes bannable, 10 years ago it would have been met with laughter. How the times have changed... 
---
I rarely use adrenaline, but to answer your question: Survivors need to "earn" their adrenaline by accomplishing their most difficult objective, completing all 5 generators. A killer does not need to do anything other than EXIST to   get their ezmode speed boost + instadowns. 
---
Feel free to carry on creating false dichotomies in order to sustain your inner narrative of "I'm not bad, the game is unbalanced".
---
I think in general that people using acronyms just do it so that only others who actually use the same perks on regular basis can decypher it as they only want to reach to people with same playstyle
---
Thats why i know save the best for last as i use it often :p
---
No worries! Good luck!
---
Post buff hag is c tier? Interesting opinion there lad. 
---
ITT:

---
people missing the joke
---
Rip your friend because holy shit that game is plummeting in quality so fast. Went from best online game out in s5 to pure cancer in the past few seasons. 
---
Better than setting a release date and missing it, you cannot disappoint anyone if you dont set a expectation. 
---
Might not have passed certification yet, in Europe.
---
But remember, PlayStation Japan already listed a release date for the 20th (Wednesday), so it IS coming this week.
---
Thank you very much 
---
I’ve had 50 ping lobbies lag so bad in game I literally couldn’t walk over to a gen I teleported so much
---
The chosen one would be cool but I think that for each gen completed the killer should see your aura for 0.5 more seconds (2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4s). Survivors should only be allowed to see each others aura within a certain range (32 meters or so) and for less time (4,5,6s). Having it at 7 seconds after the second gen is crazy good. 
---
Tier 4 comfirmed?
---
More than likely it'll come out tomorrow around 1-2est and it'll be the 20th in other places by then. :D
---
do not worry, i will stab the shit out of you and hook you a couple of times
---
and then i'll let you go because i have bloodpoints and YOUUUUU will escape and i will get my bloodpoints and EVERYBODY WINS! 
---
especially me
---
How
---
.*
---
To be fair, it feels like you get stuck on everything in that map and she was probably just dajfajfzjafnfmsf-ing to get free by then
---
You might've understood it in a wrong way. Basically whenever a generator is completed you get to see everyone's aura for 5/7(maybe 7.5)/10 and the killer gets to see yours for 5/4/3(just for the first 4 generators). Meaning the time is always the same and only you can see where the other survivors are.
---
Really? I’m used to seeing the teabag during the mori. 😂 
---
So if the killer is using noed and I've managed to escape him every single chase without using DS then I just automatically deserve to be face camped because a killer wasn't able to complete his objective? 
---
This works both ways. If you have a counter argument then don't be a hypocrite. Not every survivor that uses DS is bad at the game. Not every killer that uses noed is bad at the game. In fact, I would argue being able to hit a skill check that's smaller than the BNP skill check every single game takes more skill than holding down w and repeatedly smashing m1 until you down someone with noed.
---
It’s the second coming of Jesus.
---
1. Freddy has to wait 7 seconds to hit people
---
2. Freddy vision is reduced so he struggles to see
---
3. Freddy despite being a stealth killer has no stealth and can easily be heard approaching
---
4. Freddy remains the only killer who cant defend hooks and unhooks
---
5. Freddy remains the only killer that cant defend totems right in front of him
---
6. Freddy remains the only killer that cant stop gens right in front of him
---
7. Freddy is the only killer that cant prevent a survivor being healed right in front of him
---
8. Freddy can still autolock onto awake survivors when asleep
---
9. Freddys dreamworld which effects are meh to begin with can be escaped incredibly quickly and is based on rng
---
10. Freddys ability doesnt help him in a chase (or in any way at all).
---
11. Freddy is a 115% M1 killer with essentially no power
---
12. The one thing freddys ability does is slow the game down slightly by making a survivor waste time waking up. Other killers (pig/doctor/plague/legion) all does this job better and they arent particularly good
---
Freddy does well at low ranks because low rank immersed people hear the lullaby and hide and have no idea how to lead chases. He dies at high ranks because he cant chase people properly.
---
Should always get Bubba up to 35 for bbq and chili.  After that, it's up to you.  For true new folks, doctor can help you learn how Survivors behave and hide when killer is nearby, but since you have survivor experience, thst shouldn't be an issue. 
---
I don't know if you're joking but green ranks are some of the sweatiest .
---
That's where 3000 hour derankers like no0b3 and kittychipz hang out and play SWF. 
---
I feel you on that one, Piggy is the worst for me.
---
Is it tomorrow or Thursday cuz I'm finna skip school.
---
Gonna keep happening each time a new chapter comes out. 
---
Was in a game with the Hag on Coal Tower. After sacrificing two, the Dwight and I, Feng, get a gate open and she stands there nodding to let us go. I go up and try to give her my toolbox, but she said no.
---
Kind of made me think of a grandma and a little granddaughter having a cute moment about giving items. You know, when the kid wants to give their thing to their grandma but she kindly says no and whacks you with her big arm gently to say bye. Fun times.
---
I think we all are.
---
That’s fair, I’m pretty lucky and rarely see that so I actually sometimes forget that lag switching is an issue.
---
He's totally into it.
---
It honestly all depends on what kind of player you are going against. Its not really anyones fault if they coordinate and want gens done they will get it. 
---
Yeah no the entity is a lazy shit who never does anything herself
---
&gt; Must have speed checked my internet close to 30 times this weekend.
---
You know you're proper Australian when you have to speedtest every ten minutes to check if the internet is slow because it's Australian or because a relative is on fucking Netflix or something.
---
Tuesday or Wednesday. The Don't release dlcs on any other days.
---
What if told you, Legion being *this* annoying, makes them the best killer in the eyes of bhvr?
---
Do you really think they want to listen to salty survivor mains that want and easy time? 
---
Lmao yep :P
---
If you're actually slamming gens, sure. If you're self-caring in the corner for the 3rd time this game, good luck and peace out.
---
Had a sabo daily recently where I ran around and 99'd 5-10 hooks around the map and was ready for a fun match with maybe some clutch saves. Eventually got found, ran the killer for a minute or two, got hooked. A P3 Claudette slowly slinks out of a nearby locker and urban evasions a bit away before self-caring. Nope'd the fuck out of that game instantly. Nothing tilts me harder than seeing teammates using self-care or urban evasioning at me from across the map.
---
Skeleton keys make it even more bullshit I just finished a game where I’m learning spirit. SWF, three toolboxes, everyone had DS, couple dead hard, adrenaline, all the stupid perks. I kill one guy because he kept healing near me and assumed I was deaf (Of course accused of tunneling), one gen left. Rancor would make another kill completely doable despite all the powerful things I had to deal with (It’s not fun learning a difficult killer when it’s constant toolbox swf groups) 
---
Long story short they all went super immersed while I had to keep patroling the gens since there’s one left but three take an easy undeserved win because one had skeleton. Don’t have cannibal so no franklin’s, literally no counterplay. And people wonder why killers tend to dodge swf lobbies
---
I started running DH again now that we have HG.  Used to go too quick before.  You'd have to also run ToTH
---
Tmrw 
---
I play Stabby Boi Myers because of the music. Thats the only reason you play Stabby boi
---
He is cool af but He is weak and unfun to play against
---
Can you explain the meme to me I’m slow
---
I personally play more survivor than killer, and I can guarantee that most of the time my swf does not give me an advantage. Yeah, all of us have comms and such, but we’re usually talking about other things than the game because we’re not that serious. I had a game where we all got demolished because we were laughing at tik tok memes instead of looking where the trapper trapped
---
It's from "White Chicks" BF means Bitch Fit. Hilarious movie.

I'm just making a joke.
---
It is garbage. Hilarious garbage. 
---
Oh ok I’m not good when it comes to white chick movies
---
I love that movie!
---
Okay but hear me out, what if it's survive with friends? Because the people who are friends with Hitler should probably die too. 
---
They should make it where if the survivor runs a grip add on for their flashlights and made grip add ons for all the other items it would be a way to counter franklins without just straight up nerfing it 
---

---
Too many...minors? I'm 22. Unless you mean I'm down in the mines...which I'm not that either. 
---
Interesting how you reduce huntress and hag to only “slower moving killers”. There power more than makes up for their move speed, while Michaels power is decent, he doesn’t counter regular loops for the most part. Huntress and Hag can both end chases very quickly with proper use of their power, though I do admit Hags traps are less great without addons. 
---
I only allow myself to pip twice a day as survivor if i want to keep playing survivor lol. 
---
360? Very original, thank you for your great contribution to Reddit 
---
Silky as new survivor, confirmed.
---
OwO
---
Yea but the killer usually lobby dodges before hitting a DC, but that’ll change in the next update when you wont be able to tell if survivors are playing SWF
---
Rancor doesn't show an aura, but a pop-up notification like madness.   Which is why it works even if you are in a locker.
---
Being camped is boring and most people don't care if their solo teammates don't escape(I know I don't care).
---
So what’s the point of 5/7/10? After the first three it goes up? The perk would definitely need to have a radius limit if the times build up to that high. It should be if YOU have the perk those things apply because if everyone runs the perk two things happen; the survivor not doing anything gets a free aura reading and the killer would see everyone, even if they chose to complete another task (other than a gen). It’s a sick ass idea if you want the game to be slightly slowed, but the times like you said would need some work. I think the survivor aura reading is too high without a radius limit
---
Okay but a game shouldn’t be balanced around its average, especially an asymmetrical game like dbd. It needs to be balanced around the highest level of play, so assuming optimal swf and an optimal player playing killer. 
---
There’s always room for improvement on the players part, but there’s only so much a perfect Leatherface can do against perfect survivors in a match.
---
That’s right, My bad, I saw a report saying that it was set to drop in Japan on the 20th, forgot that they’re a day early from North America because timezones
---

---
&gt;Freddy has to wait 7 seconds to hit people
---
This point has been said multiple times in every "freddy is bad" comment ever. All I gotta say is, you're looking at it wrong. It's 7 seconds as an investment. You want 7 seconds to hit survivors, but you get information like being able to see them across the map. Truth is, there are also quite a few gens that are somewhat distant from pallets/vaults anyway, you get a surprising amount of free hits for being forced to wait 7 seconds anyway.
---
&gt;2. Freddy vision is reduced so he struggles to see
---
Not only did they brighten the dream world a while back, but the only thing important to freddy is the color of the survivors in the dream world. Survivors glow a bright blue, they're very easy to see. You may not be able to see a really immerse Claudette, but thats why holding your ability out doesn't slow you down. If you hold the ability out, the ability will autolock and auto sleep survivors, you don't need to worry about seeing in those dark corners because your ability will spot them for you, and since the survivors fall asleep and go into the same vision youre in, the burden that is the "dark" dreamworld effects them more than it effects you.
---
&gt;. Freddy despite being a stealth killer has no stealth and can easily be heard approaching
---
I don't think freddy technically is a stealth killer, but with the right build he doesn't suffer like most of the stealth killers do. Pig is definitely a stealth killer, and she suffers from movement reduction while crouched. Freddy moves 115% speed and can have his heartbeat lowered by perks, and he is invisible until he sleeps someone, you don't know if he has eyes on you until it's too late.
---
&gt;Freddy remains the only killer who cant defend hooks and unhooks
---
Technically this is wrong, as you can prevent sleeping survivors from unhooking in your face. This doesn't really matter unless it's end game anyway, because if they get off that hook, you now have 2 targets to go after (this is where the information you get from sleeping survivors comes in handy).
---
&gt; Freddy remains the only killer that cant defend totems right in front of him
---
The simple fix is not needing a reason to run a totem. I don't run noed, ruin, or anything like that (unless it's the rare occasion that I have super fast sleep and I wanna run a totem). You don't need ruin, run sloppy butcher instead for a more consistent slow down to the game.
---
&gt; Freddy remains the only killer that cant stop gens right in front of him
---
This is the only good point you have had thus far, but again, it only matters if it's the last gen left since adrenaline wakes people up. Even if they have the nerve to pop it right in front of your face, they're sleeping. You know where they are going, and until they're out of the dreamworld, they contribute almost nothing to gens being complete.
---
&gt;Freddy is the only killer that cant prevent a survivor being healed right in front of him
---
If you see a survivor being healed with self care, they most likely won't even be close to being done  unless they had a long time to heal. If you see multiple survivors healing together, you have multiple people in the dreamworld, and even if they do decide to finish healing in front of you, you don't lose much since you can hit them again anyway, and if one of them vaults a pallet/ window, the same one most likely won't be able to go through that same exit, so you'll be able to go after the healer instead. 
---
&gt; Freddy can still autolock onto awake survivors when asleep
---
This is an issue but that really only effects end game, and it also usually only effects a bad freddy. If you know you're going to autolock onto a someone who isnt sleeping and you're chasing someone who is sleeping, swing when you know you won't auto lock. It's really only an issue when you NEED to lunge to get them, which won't happen unless they're right in the exit gates, meaning you probably won't get them anyway since they can block you by healing (but there are ways to avoid those type of situations)
---
&gt;Freddys dreamworld which effects are meh to begin with can be escaped incredibly quickly and is based on rng
---
Effects are meh? The survivor who is sleeping basically can't help their team progress in any way until they're awake. And yes it is rng based, but since its rng, there is no guarentee. You can do a full gen and not wake up, that's rng, and it can happen even if the chance is slim. You can limit the amount of chances survivors have to waking up through rng by playing well and not giving them room to do so, and if they wake up in front of you, you just sleep them again.
---
&gt;Freddys ability doesnt help him in a chase (or in any way at all).
---
This is just wrong. At the beginning of the chase, when you put someone to sleep, you can use your no terror radius, phasing in and out of their vision, no red stain, to get a free hit at certain pallets. If the survivor is wasting a lot of your time by looping you, you can leave them. Unless they have self care (which is a pretty rare thing ever since the nerf) they have to leave their safe area, and that's when you capitalise on their positioning. If you run monitor and abuse like I do, I can break away from a chase and wait for them because my terror radius is so low, they might think I left but I'll still be there. It might not provide you benefits at loops, but you can use his ability and information to make moves that help you in the overall chase. One thing I love about self caring survivors is that they usually run once they fail a skill check and wake up, letting me get a free hit because they thought the 7 seconds to hit them was enough time to get away.
---
&gt;Freddy is a 115% M1 killer with essentially no power
---
Except in multiple paragraphs I said how his power isnt a hinderence and how it can be used to your advantage? People play him uneffectively, you can tell who those people are because they consider his ability a hinderence.
---
&gt; The one thing freddys ability does is slow the game down slightly by making a survivor waste time waking up. Other killers (pig/doctor/plague/legion) all does this job better and they arent particularly good
---
Pigs is based off of rng, but unlike freddy, the boxes are marked for survivors. Her traps approach stalling the wrong way, because survivors dont technically need to worry about getting them off until theu are activated, meaning they can just contribute to gens instead of getting it off until a gen pops. The stalling she provides is inconsistent, and unless you have good addons, you usually get the trap off at box 1 and 2. Doctor isnt really for stalling, it's more for revealing survivors. Doctor has to spend a lot of time zapping survivors and being at 110% movement speed to stall survivors, and they just snap out of it, which isn't rng based at all, and won't stall effectively in most situations, if doctor is spending that much time zapping survivors, his lethality is going down because he isnt hitting them enough. Cant say much for plague since she isnt out, but I think her ability is the right amount of lethal as it is stalling, I think she is going to be mid-high tier, so she is better than freddy in those terms. Legion can stall survivors for a while, but without certain addons, his lethality suffers. They can't down survivors easily at all, freddy doesn't lose his ability to hurt survivors consistently.
---
Also are we really going to compare him to other killers? At this current time, leatherface is hillbilly but without all the benefits hillbilly has (leatherface has no map control, a chainsaw that makes him run slower than survivors while revving it, a chainsaw that excels in niche situations, etc.) Freddy also does not die at high ranks, I'm rank 1 and do well with him because I've practiced and can say I know how to use his ability well, BAD freddys who don't know how to utilise his ability die at high ranks. You made a few valid points, but a lot of your arguments are the same thing everyone who doesn't know how to play him well say, there are so many ways to make his benefits shine through and lower the amount of times his ability hinders you. He isn't perfect, but he is underrated by far.

I'd just say that being able to hit and run people at max speed is way more viable than hit multiple people at once with 1 second of good speed.
---
I've played like 300 hours of LF, and unless I took someone to the basement, his power wasn't very viable in a chase. When I did basement, I spent a lot of time charged, baiting, and crushing unhooks by hitting both as they ended. High rank or not, Borrowed Time or not, people still went for it.
---
With this change, you could still use his power like that, but his potential of slugging and hit and runs would be increased massively, since you could cover the distance somebody waiting to flashlight or bodyblock gets from you right away. 
---
 I'd definitely take forcing a pallet / getting another down by running at 250% straight into a loop. You get that over the occasional two survivors getting stuck on eachother in a tight space, and eating an inadvisable unhook instantly but honestly, you could probably still do both with this proposed change.
---
When there is lag, yes
---
When there's 4 DStrikes, that often means swf. It only takes one body block to use wiggle DS, which is super easy with communications.
---
&gt;you're a sociopath because you don't want to waste your actual real-life time to help random people you don't even like achieve an arbitrary goal
---
Yikes
---
Don’t like it, don’t comment. 
---
No 
---
They're on ZubatLEL's discord server (only the red ones and I don't have an immediate copy of the rest on me atm)
---
I don’t mind it. I do like when they try to do hook sabo squad though. Those teams are usually the easiest to take down because they’re more worried about taking hooks down and body blocking than actually doing generators. Both sides end up getting a lot of BP and it’s a nice shake up from the normal games. 
---
So why is it so hard for them to give an actual firm release date?  They know exactly when it’s going to be available so just freakin’ tell us.  We’re literally giving you money for this stuff, so let us know!
---
I'm a spirit main and if I'm not expecting to be palet slammed at all it scares the shit out of me.
---
So, what do I think we can do to make NoED less frustrating?
---
First, we make it where as soon as it activates, the Survivors know they are screwed if the Killer catches them. They are automatically given the Exposed Icon when NoED becomes relevant.
---
Secondly, because they know now it's relevant and they have to go Immersive, I think it's fair to get rid of the Hex Portion of the perk; it's just a straight talent now, no getting rid of it except for escaping. This gives the Killer the guaranteed ability to have it active, and makes it a good perk for Late Game builds with stuff like Remember Me, Fire Up, and potentially Bloodwarden. This isn't set in stone though; it could remain a Hex if it proved to be too powerful as a regular perk.
---
Thirdly, because we actually want high-risk, high reward gameplay, I feel like it's fair to halve all BP the Killers gain after NoED activates (But nothing changes prior), while giving Survivors double BP for any action taken after it activates. This gives Survivors an incentive to actually try to save their team mates from the Killer if one is caught, while making it where Killers are punished heavily for relying on it; it's still a Training Wheels perk after all.
---
I feel like with these three changes (Tell the Survivors, allow the Killer to keep it, and it manipulates blood points), the perk would stop being so frustrating to go up against and would actually not be a big issue for either side.
---
Care to dispute how playing killer on ping is somehow good, or have you never played KYF before? Just because you're bias doesn't make me objectively wrong. 
---
Omg please noo
---
i mean, sure, you have a point, but i was addressing this person's specific concerns real quick. i'm unfamiliar with the Chucky franchise as a whole, but someone upthread did note that his ex-girlfriend could be the "main" killer with Chucky riding on her shoulder as her "power," which sounds viable enough to me. the question of how that would work is of course still in the air but it would be an interesting concept.
---
I do agree with you. If I knew that NoED was active the second the last gen popped I would play differently. It would give it more counterplay. I get that people can do totems before hitting the last gen, but in Solo Survivor land that simply doesn't happen. 
---
A totem counter for Small Game, or global notification of NoED once active would be really nice. I would be interested in what you thought of for a fix. 
---
More like
---
&gt; you're a sociopath because you don't even care about anyone outside of your social group if they can't get anything for you
---
Thank you for putting this frustration into words. NoED is a good perk as far as strats for killers, but the lack of notification until after that 1HKO makes it so annoying. 
---
If youre gonna throw, then dont play a team based game.
---
I like this idea.
---
Faster kills, faster hatch. 
---
I love her! You did such a wonderful job so far :) even if you dont finish it this is a masterpiece 
---
Huntress always makes me scared. Like I made her extra mad
---
Myers is only second to Evan Macmillan 
---
maybe if we all actually ranked up maybe? at least don’t derank like a prick
---
Congrats, you found the joke.
---
Matchmaking, makes playing killer worse, don't trust BHVR, etc.
---
It's a cool idea, but the killer immediately knowing a survivor's location at the start would be extremely strong. I think it would help the strongest killers most, and not help the weaker killers as much, so it would be kind of unbalanced. Imagine a Billy, Nurse, or a Spirit, who immediately knows where to go.
---
well idk if theyre allowed to call him the ripper, coiuld they get in trouble like a license or lawsuit for using The ripper? probs not huh
---
if NOED makes such a big difference in a match, the killer probably needed it in order to counter the survivers' skills. especially if you're doing SWF. the killer cant do SWF because killers dont have friends on account of their psychotic tendencies. so the next time you're beating a killer who turns things around with NOED, just think, "good for you, friendless one!"
---
Whenever that happens I treat everyone equal until someone actually does have DS then I tunnel the fuck out of them
---
1. It rewards shit killer with free downs/kills
---
2. The only counter is incredibly timeconsuming with zero benefit for survivors
---
I feel if cleansing the totems gave you any benefit apart from denying noed it wouldnt be too bad. As of right now if you cleanse 4 totems it doesnt mean jack shit
---
Ummm no? Aang is the airbender monk kid with the blue arrow on his head. Appa is his sky bison.
---
tbh ya'll being too sensitive
---
I'll continue playing how I like because I paid money for it, thank you very much.
---
I feel like I'm the only one whos just disgusted by the new killer concept. I neither wanna puke on people nor do I want to get puked on
---
Gross
---
* sigh * here we go again * unzips pants * 
---
Oh me too! Absolutely!
---
I mean you get used to it and try to adapt but there's some kind of move where they move towards you and then left-right you and that's 2 free misses right there. You can literally be hugging the survivor and miss multiple swings

Not really. I don’t mind murder and I’m not sensitive about violence, it’s more from a common sense/ game design purpose I don’t want real killers. Jack the Ripper liked to mutilate and destroy women’s genitals for example - so what his Mori gonna be?! You do have to think about those things. Plus some victims/ family members of killers (not jtr) are still alive so it’s not cool. 
---
But you could surely distinguish them. One is the current Doctor- the other is a religious man clad in robes, holding smoking stick and a lantern. Or he could be more like a mummy in appearance- sickly and covered in bandages. And their abilities wouldn't even be similar. I'd imagine the Plague Doctor would punish altruism by having some sort of disease-spreading ability. 
---
I'll give it to you on Leatherface and Hillbilly. Hillbilly was a homage to Leatherface before they could get him, chainsaw, disfigured face and all. And it's unfortunate that they couldn't think of any interesting ability for Leatherface to distinguish them, but I think a modern doctor and a plague doctor can work separately. Especially since one uses electricity and the other would use voodoo magic, basically. Or diseased rats or something. 
---
If you're the obsession, don't let him lose you if he does find you, even at risk of death.
---
 Scratched Mirror is completely viable if you let him build Play with your Food up.
---
As someone who likes to give advice to new players, it hurts a bit when you see someone who doesn’t know how to lunge but they leave chat instantly so you can’t tell them. I understand a lot of people would rather shittalk them for being new and that’s why they leave but not everyone is like that.
---
I don’t even understand these people. Best just to ignore them
---
Based on the downvotes, seems a lot of killers think that the only thing survivors like to talk about, is how much they hate killers.
---
Maybe we... y'know... want to talk about the game? Say "Good game", and mention that time you almost found us hiding? Ask that Meg what she was doing all game? Might take the chance to add some positivity to the world?
---
But nope, someone might accuse you of camping the hook or tunneling, so gotta run away. Then post on reddit about how survivors are toxic.
---
I had those the other day. And I also had a match where it seemed I was hitting through survivors not affecting them at all. 
---
Interesting build. How does it play for you? Decent? 
---
They have to be to match the killers energy. 🤷🏿‍♀️
---
Yes. And you, a bad one.
---
If you did draw this, it looks good! Something I would change is making one hand lower or something because I think it looks awkward when you can tell one hand is just copied.
---
I'm sorry you had this experience :( some people are just mean spirited no matter what you do 
---
People always say pig is the best jump scare killer but fuck that, setting off a hag trap for the first time In a match physically makes me jump out of my chair every time.
---
Holee sheet
---
35% wiggle bar is fairly common. There are times when the survivor can wiggle fully, and times when they're downed under a hook. So 35% is pretty tame, especially when you've got these hyper altruistic survivors who converge like raptors when anyone gets picked up. 
---
Amanda should be higher
---
Yeah they already said they weren't changing anything significant about the Plague or the new perks so tomorrow is a safe bet
---
Yeah my net disconnects for 10 - 40 seconds, sometimes minutes, randomly throughout the day. My games are usually pretty chill at the end, but I had a very pissed off SWF the other day. I couldn't even tell anything was wrong, everyone was moving normally on my screen.
---
every time an objective is complete while you're on a hook, you should get some points.
---
You know how each perk has 3 levels? That.s what those numbers are there for xD
---
Oh my god, that was kind of epic!
---
Myers should be bottom teir, he's stun sound is just a mildly disgruntled moan. Its even worse as every other time hes compleatly silent.
---
Why the hell are people downvoting this 
---
We pay a hundred a month for 7-10 mbps ("""Up to 16mbps""") and even then it frequently cuts out for a few seconds at a time throughout the day, and only 2 people can use it at a time because additional connections extremely slow and unstable.

---
That's a pretty good idea, actually.
---
Doctor eliminates stealth, but has limitted tools in a chase. That makes him as skill-based as others of the same token: Freddy, Wraith, maybe even some other killers who don't get much mileage out of their abilities, like Leatherface. 
---
So really he's as skill based as a naked killer- which is still *some* skill. Granted he can stop people from using pallets, which I find effective but many people don't for some reason. I'm not saying Doc is under-powered or incredibly skill-based like Huntress or something, but he still *takes* skill. 
---
TRUTH. That is honestly the worst map to play killer on.
---
Im on PC :(
---
Shouldn't you be more spread out than all on top of each other?
---
Maybe it's just me, I don't know, but when I see NoED pop up it's not always me that gets hit first. It's just what frustrates me the most.
---
"The toxicity is 100% equal"
---
Had this happen a few times too.
---
I like that idea
---
Just chucks at it them like cheese to babies
---
looks fricking epic
---
 good job
---
I'll only be there on Saturday, just so you know :)
---
All the time. The problem with your idea is that if youre trying to measure the skill of a survivor, escaping doesnt properly measure that.
---
You can escape and still be a bad survivor and the flip side, you can die on hook but still be a good survivor.
---
Exactly, the aswesomeness of his giggle is more important than him being a shit killer.
---
Yeah console version is super buggy, but it worked out for me.
---
Nothing beats getting on dbd for fun with friends and it’s legion/iri head huntress the first game of the day
---
Go malignant in KYF.
---
This is me.
---
\*stepped on LEGO brick
---
Well this game is perfect as everybody knows
---
This happened to my mate the other day. He died, the rest of us escaped through the hatch, and he got the trophy. 
---
To be completely honest pig is truly terrible against good players. You don't patrol the map in stealth mode as its much too slow compared to how fast the game will go which makes her just an M1 killer. Most loops cannot be mind game with her crouch dash and even then the timing is quite easy to just slam the pallet on your head if you try and get it off.
---
Her power basically just says "wastes between 20 and 80 seconds of a survivors time after being unhooked depending on RNG"
---
She is arguably worse than freddy as they are both M1 bots except he has better tracking and spreading his dream world pressure will waste more time than her bear traps if done properly.

I bought iron will for a gift. Can attest these are really nice, very good craftsmanship.

No biggie. It's just a video game. It doesn't matter.
---
Some of you have never had to 3 man commit to the last gen and it shows
---
The rule still stands: if your the obsession and had no plans to be, TURTLE THE WHOLE GAME!
---
Some of my adventures running this perk:
---
- I unhook another surv right as a Jake arrives. The killer has just downed the fourth player. Rather than allow Jake and I to heal her in seconds, the freshly unhooked survivor runs away. Why?!? There’s two of us! And I have We’ll Make It!
---
- up against a Hag. Exit gates are open. A Meg gets downed and taken to the Killer shack basement, where I have managed to hide in one of the lockers upstairs while the Hag traps the staircase. She leaves, I crouch over into the basement and unhook. I heal for a split second before the Meg decides to cancel the heal and move. Trap goes off, Hag teleports and kills Meg. 
---
What is it about this perk that makes other survivors refuse to let you heal them?!?
---
Right? People always forget that 4% in this game is mach10
---
Thanks
---
Then you love urself! You absolute qt 
---
Ayyyye godmode saves! 
---
All the time. As long as you do your job you pip. Atleast 1.5 gens, an unhook, and a decent chase or two.
---
Hag depends on map. In meat plant without addons she's A tier easy since her default range covers nearly that entire map.
---
Huge sprawling maps like cornfield she's D tier.
---
I'd argue that, but I respect your opinion
---
Your fired. 
---
This isn't politics, it's a game.  And playing both roles doesn't mean you don't have an opinion. But it does likely mean you have a less bias and more accurate one.
---
So instead of screeching inaudiably about, say the hatch or tunneling you're going to value the strengths and weaknesses of both arguments and have an overall stronger perspective. 
---
Aaron, if I had any advice for you it, it would be....DON'T SPEAK!
---
Leatherface can deal with this situation if he stays close enough, most killers can't.
---
Oh, okay.  My bad.  This is reddit after all.  Sadly your joke is the normal kind of mentality around here.
---
Because Freddy is taken in this sub as being the worst killer I did enjoy reading your rebuttal.
---
UUGH
---
Me personally, I want him to have a cake cutter as his weapon. Powers and perks I'm still figuring out, I was thinking one his perks would be like "No running". For every 30/25/20 seconds look at a single survivor and they will not be able to run by fear of being in trouble
---
I resent this list, wraith and trapper by far have the worst ones
---
It’s so hard to find a match as an R1 survivor. Finding matches on PS4 has gotten better lately but it can still take forever to get a lobby as an R1, especially if you’re playing swf. The rank reset is so harsh anyway that you end up having to play with potatoes when it happens. Devs need to work on lobbies for R1s and fix the rank reset first. Then it won’t happen as much. 
---
Thats why it's called a "shitpost" buckaroo

I literally wanted to hit them with a hatchet and thats it.  Your scenario is fine but the trashtalk at the end was unnecessary. They got a freebie, they can move on to the next game - instead they decided to tell me what my intentions were and I made them pay for it.
---
It can be annoying when campy killers have it. You go through an entire match against a tunneling killer, finally complete the generators and instantly get downed by someone who really didn't deserve the 4k
---
So they paid $50+ in 90s money for a logo commission of their 4-person gang? What a bunch of dorks.

---
Okay I’m just a slutty pig main so I’m biased as fuck but I still thought I was better than those two 😂
---
What is the problem with noed? It is a perk that can be fully destroyed before it actually activates, so why is everyone conplaining? Just look for totems, it is not that hard.
---
This isn't politics, it's human nature. Most people don't have all of their opinions fall straight down the middle on most issues. I dislike the golden mean fallacy stuff. This idea here on /r/DBD that a player's opinion has more credibility if they tell you that they main or don't main something is stupid as hell. It comes down to the issues you empathize with more and less about what you play more often, and I think virtually everyone here empathizes more with one gameplay mode over the other. I think being honest about our biases in conversations here is more important than trying to signal to everyone that we don't have them. 
---
That pallet drop at 1:40 😂😂 
---
I think LF should be in the top tier.
---
Do you know how long sixty seconds is in game time? you're going to get picked up off the floor before that. Its basically an escape =/

Yeah, we got a Valve survivor with Bill.

Damn what did big boi do to you?
---
I frequently let the last person go when I play the pig. I always send them a message when they're the last person that simply says "You've survived Jigsaw's game :)" assuming they have messages open. If I'm unable to message them, I just kill them. 
---
My fired what?
---
If wraith and trapper aren’t at the very bottom then I don’t understand 
---
He existed and ruined the killers.

Literally all you do is slice them once 
---
Idk if they'll give new cosmetics to licensed characters. If they will, heres my guess what they'd give survivors. 
---
Laurie: Her look in H20 or the 2018 sequel. Tapp: Maybe his look from Saw: The Game

Its just the truth. I'm just sick of people trying to defend them and say they have legitimate counterplay because thats bullshit. Leta be real. 
---
Hi, P3 Claudette main here who runs Urban Evasion, Lightweight, Iron Will, and Quick and Quiet.
---
You can suck the big one. I play how I want. 
---
I generally get more gens done than anyone, because I don't waste time running away from the killer. 
---
Now you watch your mouth
---
You see the shock and can still drop the pallet, unless he predicts it and has a large range addon. It also slows him down so if he shocks you, you just run away. 
---
^This. Also your flair says you’re a spirit, any tips for someone new to spirit? I know the basics and are decent at her but her lack of map pressure is crippling, especially with toolboxes. And I have a tendency to easily get the first hit but lose the survivors before I can get the second off
---
The trapper. Honestly. Having my leg caught in a bear trap is just so horrifying. I can deal wotj lol chainsaws, axes, swords. Those will kill me quick. I would have one perk. 
---
Laugh it off
---
Laugh for 5 seconds and heal one state. 
---
For me, it doesn't particularly matter how the game went. If i kill 3 people, There's a good chance I just let the last go. BPs aren't a big deal. I don't specifically go for like really expensive addons or anything. I haven't even prestiged any killers, I just level up at 50 over and over. 
---
Idk why but it disturbs me how well you get to write a noise
---
Some one would be sitting on the fence by pretending that they don't empathize more strongly with some issues over others, specifically one side's gameplay over the other. Nobody denies that you need to have some experience in both roles to have a good perspective on the game in general. But if you're arguing that playing both roles(even equally) protects you from prejudice or implies that you believe the game's issues are evenly split 50/50, I'd say that what it really implies is a lack of strong opinions, or insecurity with how they'd be received here.  
---
I was waiting for a floating Feng to blink in and start whacking.
---
Imagine looping the killer irl
---
"Zero benefit" you get points and don't get hit with NOED.
---
This JUST happened to me. WTF, now I have two completed rituals just gone. 😑
---
I'm not really worried about being scared or terrified, 
---
I'm more worried about the pain Im gonna feel when one of the two Chainsaw wielding douchebags come around.
---
God, the pain...
---
Spirit freaks me out so much, I'd never want to face her if I ever end up in entity's realm. 
---
When it comes to survivors, I think I could get along with Jeff as we are both quiet, black metal loving somewhat creative thicc bois in their 30's
---
Only a fool formulates an opinion from the information of one side. 
---
The biggest factor for me is if they were playing toxic tbh, sandbagging teammates and such. Bloodpoints aren’t important when you don’t prestige and I’m not too concerned over them either
---
"More counterplay" Just do the totems, that's the counterplay. The bit about solo survivors seems more like a solo survivor issue and not actually about NOED itself.
---
This is the build Hitler himself is running.
---
It'll still have the issue of Sprint Burst shitting on the lunge so I don't know that that'll alleviate much, but her counter-play to all that is to just uncrouch.
---
So I sooner would like if her lunge attack landing had a better pay-off than M1'ing if they're going to make it more difficult for it to land.
---
That shit doesn't work, I've blocked people and been blocked by people, still get in their lobbies
---
You can just put white over the image. Or even put your image on top of theirs
---
If you get "outplayed" by NOED, you did that to yourself. You got plenty of time to do all the totems before popping the last gen.
---
Do you know how many potatoes it takes to kill an Irishman?
---
&gt;! None. !&lt;
---
was looking for this comment 
---
&gt;See, there you go again. Suggesting that by playing both roles your opinion is watered down or weakened...
---
I didn't suggest that, at all. You misunderstood. I said that saying that you do doesn't imbue your opinions with extra credibility. 
---
oh... I was fine by myself, but since it's you, daddy... I'll make an exception
---
I use bbq and chilli, hex ruin. Monitor and abuse and usually bamboozle or nurses calling. I tend to switch them up every now and then 
---
She’s better than billy
---
Though sometimes you escape, but get no pip so what is the point.
---
That's true. I hadn't thought of that, but yeah if they were being super toxic I make sure to kill as many as I can. 
---
Why would you get banned for achievements? 
---
I don’t get how people can be so mean to others in a game. Props to you for being a nice killer. Hopefully you’ll get the respect you deserve. Without killers there cannot be survivors.
---
Fun fact, you can puke on people on hooks.
---
And this is why I don’t let survivors go anymore, you don’t find hatch before I find you you die like the rest.
---
IDK about DBD specifically but I know it works with other PS4 games so I'd assume it works here. I haven't tested it myself though. 
---
Monitor and abuse so when your on your first tier, you have ZERO terror radius
---
It's a Jesus light.
---
I believe puking on hooked survivors works.
---
Best Killer: Probably Freddy; He is slow and has to pull you into his world that or Have because she is slow, small and presumably weaker than others.
---
Best Survivor: Probably Adam; He is smart, quick and seems like good company, something g you may want if you're going to be hung on a bloody hook.
---
Worst Killer: I would have to say that Leatherface is very scary, he is massive, had a chainsaw, is cannabalistic and looks/sounds terrifying. However, most of the tall killers seem the scariest.
---
Worst survivor: Quentin, Laurie or Claudette. Three words; Doing gens, you? I'm kidding. It would probably be Laurie, she's a babysitter and seems like she'd be useless in a DBD-type situation.
---
Noob3 👌
---
Monitor &amp; abuse to reduce his terror radius to 0 in tier 1, 8 in tier 2 and 24 in tier 3. Gives him very good stealth. 
---
Ruin allows you to stalk people until your tier 2 without losing significant progress via gens.
---
Some people like sloppy and nurses. Due to Myers small terror radius he can see people heal before they hear his terror radius allowing for ambushing of survivors
---
I like to use discordance to help me find my first stalking spot and to easily find groups of players. Can work well when you have tier 3 ready.
---
Knock out can be useful to hide dying survivors if you want to make the most of your tier 3. 
---
Whisperers is a good tracking perk and saves time having to look through different gens.

*stares
---
Yes, but the only objective is to do gens and escape. Personally it makes sense, if you die you lose, if you live you win. Same with killer. If you get 2 kills you get a black pip, 3 for 1 and all 4 for 2 pips. Looping, helping your team or hiding aren't objectives. The only objective is to do 5 gens and escape. How you get there is up to you.
---
I'm surprised that you don't find the Legion mori to be YES YES YES.
---
Legion mori is really well done and fits in well with their lore.
---
I got this trophy accidentally. I was playing in a 3-stack SWF and we ended up just rolling the killer. I had a red key with me, just for insurance, not even thinking about the trophy. Once we had all 5 gens, the hatch spawned out in the open and we just hopped in. I think randy saw the key and knew we had the chance to do it, because he followed me until I found the hatch instead of opening an exit gate. 
---
While what you said is true, there's always going to be someone that only plays 1 side and has ever only played that side that's going to chime in with the biased bullshit and objectively downvote the topic just to make sure you don't get heard.
---
Of course you got time for totems except not really if you're solo. Then it's not only unfun, its also pretty much impossible to be sure you cleansed all 5 totems.
---
&gt;NOED Killers should only ever get 1K
---
They shouldnt even get one. There is literally nothing skillful about equipping a perk that is just double damage and speed boost. If they couldnt get a down the entire game then why should they get one at the end? The killer fucked up and survivors outplayed him. Why does the killer get rewarded for playing poorly?
---
I've actually thought about [this](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/Slappy_behind_chuck_7619.png) survivor + killer combo for a while
---
Matchmaking only considers the rank you are for either survivor or killer. No other variables are considered. 
---
The game is balanced around Solo Survivors, you know that right? Hence why there are a metric butt ton of perks that tell you where your allies are?
---
That's me with WGLF and STBFL lol
---
Kate owes you a round of beers after that. 
---
honestly all you need to do to get a single pip is like 2 gens, and then maybe a hook rescue, or a few heals. That's it. Ranking up as a survivor is a joke. 
---
Sweatier? Absolutely. Better? No even fucking close. The best PS4 survivors are the average PC survivors. I played a lot of rank 1 Survivor and Killer on consoles, and rank 1 Killer on PC. Survivors are horrible on both platforms, but on console it's just embarrassing. How can that many players be so bad?
---
I mean, quiet in a different way, ya know... Pretty sure we'd both be dead within minutes, no stealth for us fat heavy breathers :,)
---

Nah. I'm a Trapper main, and I don't particularly give a damn unless you're an ass to me. 
---
No one cares.
---

---
Lifts mask and it's actually nea
---
“OK bye!”
---
I have. I've had to do a 3 man last gen before, and my SWF had the sense to run in opposite directions after the killer downs the first one of us to wipe his blade.
---
There are two doors to run to, you both don't have to exit the same one.
---
If you remember which one they were I'd send this screenshot and an explanation of what happened to Behaviors support with the gamertag of the person that did that to you. That'll do alot more than a downvote. 
---
I'm in awe of how you can get mind gamed by a killer holding a survivor. You cant even lunge yet she vaults like she is expecting you too.
---
Ohh. That sounds really interesting , iam looking forward to the change of the perk
---
A name so nice you just gotta say it twice
---
The Clown is not only disgusting but terrifying. As for the Survivor I'd befriend the fastest? Probably Bill or Jeff. 
---
Mhm she is!
---
Bloodhound really helps if you have problems with tracking. I also have problems with tracking (on all killers) because I'm supposed to wear glasses, so the neon blood color helps me a lot.
---
Make sure that you're wearing headphones or a headset, preferably one of those headsets with 360 sound, so you can pinpoint where survivors are based on their injured sounds or the sounds of their breathing when you're in haunt mode.
---
Something that I do, too, to try to up my gen pressure, is that sometimes if I'm chasing someone and I know that a generator in my terror radius is being worked on, I'll phase in the middle of the chase and haunt to the gen that's being worked on. I sometimes get to pull people off, but I usually at least get a hit in. This means that you're sacrificing the chase you started and starting a new one, but if you aren't in purple or red ranks, it means that the person that you lost will probably waste time with healing while you're downing their teammate.
---
Another tip is to play survivor &amp; learn the survivor mindset (I started as a survivor before I switched to killer, so I had a leg up), so you can learn to predict their movements while you're haunting.
---
You can also alternate between fake-outs by pretending to phase by standing still (survivors will sometimes double back and come toward you to try to juke you while you're haunting), and actually haunting.
---
Oh, also. Get yourself some good hair. The default Spirit hair is very tall and easy to spot in cornfields and across the map. I use the Geisha updo because it's classy, but either of the short options are good.
---
Joey's the really chill one, canonically, I think 
---
Self care is garbage tho
---
She didnt bother to struggle until the very end. Looks like she gave in and was maybe expecting the claudette to stun him with the pallet. 
---
She only started struggling when the Jeff came in with the flashlight.
---
Struggling on console though is a bit of a pain due to possible damage to your joystick and I think she gave in after being caught in the locker.
---
Freddy did get a huge boost with the recent changes, but he's still the one of the worst killers in the game right now. In absolutely no circumstance is Freddy better than Clown, or Hag. Trapper is much better on some maps, much worse on others, and Wraith is about the same power level. You can still do well and pull of great games with him though, which is something that used to be impossible
---
Doing Gens, You?
---
Can't take any chances with NOED being a thing.
---
You haven't read the last patch notes have you?
---
I did something rather like this once with an AFK Jake on my back. They were stupid enough to think that Bodyblocking me from the basement was genuinely a good idea. 
---
Freddy.  You can’t escape him.  He’s a burn victim who lives in your dreams and then becomes your reality in real life. Nightmares becoming real is the real terror.
---
Oh okay
---
Fun challenge, solos are way too easy to wipe the floor with rn
---
There's literally nothing skillful about a lot of stuff in this game, I hate to say. There's nothing skillful about Adrenaline, Kindred actively punishes the killer for putting someone on the Hook because the Solo Survivors now have a way to see what other people are doing, Self Care takes away the skill of knowing where other Survivors are, and even Borrowed Time is basically saying it's ok to pull some risky bullshit instead of waiting for an opportune moment.
---
This isn't a skill intensive game. Yes, there are skills you can use, but there's very definitely a skill ceiling, and that ceiling is low.
---
Guy really did not wanted to like, just turn to a wall to pick up. Rip to him.
---
That poor Trapper. I'm kinda shocked that he didn't learn to look in a different direction when picking that Kate up.
---
Turtle?
---
1: Make Frenzy have a much much longer CD, but chasing survivor fills it quicker
---
2: Remove Deep Wounds, it is boring, just a standard hit
---
3: Only sightly increased MS, also make base MS 115%
---
4: Sightly linger lunge, but a missed attack instantly ends Frenzy
---
5: Can vault windows very quick and also pallets at normal speed or slight faster.
---

Thanks man haha
---
I think some of their cosmetics are cool, but Frank's default, in my opinion, sucks. He looks too much like a knock off Jeff the Killer. I don't want to remember that cringe.
---
Distressing to confuse over monitor and abuse for peek a boo?  I’ve never ran distressing on MM
---
Ahh so thats why i get in different moods to play different killers
---
you forgot huntress lullaby. madness for random skillcheck placement AND missing sound notification will make surivors miss every skillcheck (implying that the totem doesnt get cleansed until you get the tokens required)
---
Vaulting a window allows you to place a barrier between you and the killer, forcing the killer to spend time going past it or vault through it themselves, resulting in you gaining more distance. 
---
If you keep getting hit through a window then its likely that you maybe are medium vaulting. If you sprint straight at the window and then vault it should be a fast vault which is hard to punish. 
---
Vaulting when within the killers lunge range is always a bad idea as you waste the speed burst you would have gotten from being hit and you also get hit.
---
You should try practicing fast vaults in the tutorial if you cant get the hang of them. 
---
If you keep getting hit then you need to practice understanding the different lunge distances of killers. Most killers have a general lunge of 6m and you should maybe try playing killer to gain a better understanding of how that lunge looks. 
---
Though I crunched the Numbers, and it turns out the Tombstone Piece can only be used twice. After the second Mori, there's no returning to EW3.

I love having an opinion on something, and then SC says something that I just said. It makes me feel so validated.
---
I ended up in one if those "broken killer" games, so brought a key and messaged all my random teammates to gather at the hatch. Luckily they all needed it too lol
---
That was actually funny really good first video just a tip id say is stay away from the same mainstream editing things that like ochido does cuz it’s really overused ( like the Mexican guy one and the I’m fast as fuck boi) and original stuff is funnier like the sponge bob part that made me laugh rlly hard really appreciate original editing like that 
---
Alright thanks for the advice! Always appreciate people who are cool and not toxic or anything lol I’ll try it out!
---
Cindyyyyyyy, the TV's leaking.....
---
No one is coming close to implying any of that but you.....
---
Hence my over complicating things to fit your agenda comment.
---
I play both equally survivor is too hard because i get tunneled and face camped and killer is too easy because everyone have autisim.
---
Woosh
---
Sounds like a good idea, I thought about making the Legion kind of "gaining" 115% ms with it's power, my idea was that, after hitting a survivor in deep wound for the second time, your ms would increase to 115%, that way it doesn't need to keep waiting over and over again to hit the survivor once. This change would possibly make Legion better while still keeping the original gameplay of hitting as much survivors as you can with Feral Frenzy.
---
mods feel free to take this down
---
Dokkaebi is calling... 
---
I've had it when it was allowed but since they made a statement that their anti cheat might ban you and they won't do squat about it I just restored the original files. 
---
I haven't heard anyone getting banned over that but I wouldn't risk my account with 1.5k hours in game:P
---
This is SOOOOOO wrong. It would be beyond stupid to balance a game for the Top 0.01% as opposed to the players who make up 90% of their paying user base. For example, imagine the NBA declaring "since Stepth Curry can make 3's too easily and Lebron can dunk too easily, now it is only worth 3 points if you make a shot from at least 30 feet away and the baskets have been raised to 11.5 feet!"
---
Or, imagine if the Fortnite designers declared "since the Pro players can kill people too easily, now your screen will shake as if you are in an earthquake in order to make aiming way, way, way harder.  That would be a very popular patch!!
---
Considering that a perfect Survivor does not exist unless an AI controls it, the Leatherface should be doing just fine.
---
just for fun - i would argue that even someone who plays one side extensively but *watches* other people play the other side a lot could also have more fair-minded discussion to add!
---
me, i'm talking about me. :p i'm a survivor main if only because i literally can't get a lobby with the deranking change (i'm rank 20 killer and i don't want to wait a million years for a lobby) - but i watch a lot of killer mains/"centrists" and like to think it helps me be a better survivor main and be more fair-minded in discussions.
---
And you look up and get flashlighted.  . .
---
Literally making the survivors watch you smack the generator with your weapon is an instant way of telling them you’re friendly
---
If you need an exhaustion perk to win, then you're the rank 20.
---
accurate
---
laughs in tydetyme
---
And if you don't make it? Tough. There's always next time. 
---
Right. Like I said, playing both roles doesn't lessen your understanding of the game, it raises it. My point is that playing both roles(even equally) doesn't inoculate you from bias because empathy is more important than how you distribute your playing time, and virtually everyone empathizes more with some roles than others. That doesn't mean that you don't acknowledge that both sides have issues you'd like to see addressed, but it does mean that circlejerking about how objective we are and that we're above the players who go hard on issues they feel strongly about is silly to me. 
---

i think within the last 2 years ive only ever had the pleasure of playing with super chill &amp; entertaining hag players. either they were ridiculously good at their game or were completely new / trying out stuff, but they've all been a good sport. the two killers that got insulting to such a degree that I remembered them till today were a huntress and a hillbilly
---
None of the perks you mentioned are as braindead as noed (and if they are as braindead at the very least they reward you for completing your objective)
---
Adrenaline rewards you after you complete 5 gens
---
Kindred doesnt punish the killer enough to be actually noticeable.
---
SC may be easy to use and have very little downsides but it rewards the killer for injuring survivors. Before the nerf I would agree with you here.
---
Borrowed time still requires you to plan the unhook. It's easier but it still isnt braindead easy. Not to mention unhooking is another survivors' main objective. It rewards them for unhooks and doesnt punish killers for hooking because they still progress the game.
---
Noed on the other hand still lets the killer 4k even if they didnt complete any of their objectives and punishes survivors for being better and completing their objectives.  Not to mention it just gives you a buff to stats. No gameplay or strategy change. Nothing changes you just hit people harder.
---
I don't think we're having the same conversation, as you say. You want to tell me about how playing both sides is helpful to understanding the game as if I said otherwise, I'm trying to say that everyone empathizes more with certain roles and issues over others, and that almost nobody sees everything as 50/50, right down the middle. That's ok.

Legion is pretty much already Ghostface, adding and glorifying a real serial killer who murdered real people is just wrong in my opinion, Chucky wouldn't work because of his height. The only good suggestion is the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers but the creator of it is a terrible person so even that would be a bit strange to add.

Your initial assumption is just wrong. 2 Survivors Living and 2 Survivors Dying is not a Survivor win.  2 living and 2 dying is essentially a Draw and how the game should be when perfectly balanced.
---
Are you really trying to compare Iridescent Head to DS???? Iridescent Head lasts the entire game and has 0 counters beyond hoping you can make the Hatchet miss.  DS is a 1x use. Iridescent Head can end a game within 10 seconds. In order for DS to be like Iridescent Head, it would have to be able to be used any time a Killer picked you up, without any limits.  I also have never seen a game end in less than 1 Minute due to DS.

Well, maybe they are using Resilience. I do sometimes and I just don't know how to give people the hint that I don't want to be healed. They always chase after me or wont do a gen that im on because they're waiting to heal me.

Camping makes my leathercock so hard i wanna commit third grade felony 2015 minecraft server bus driving sandwich
---
Why would this be a perk? Like how does this help survivors in any way?
---
Considering how hard they are going to make it, I think we would be getting some sort of special cosmetic. Like a new look for your favorite survivor or killer. Or a new and Special weapon for your killer, these would be for rank 1 only. then 2-5 should be blood points based or shards based. So 2,000k Shards for rank 1-5 and droping by 1/5 for each ranked tier. Max BP's for rank 1 would be 300,000k bp  and divided by 1/5th for each tier lower then that. This acomodates players who have been playing for a long time, new players and players still trying to get all the unlockables still. Because of this it would create a much larger demand from all player groups to grind out each season.   
---
Also, seasons should be extended to 2 months because of how difficult its going to get. This reduces even the best players to need to play for atleast 3 more years to obtain every rank 1 skin or cosmetic.  
---
send a link to each lore?
---
TIL 
---
13 = 0
---
13 = a lot 
---
I can't tell whose wrong but as a killer, I generally tend to drop chases if the survivor is decent and knows how to loop. No point in chasing 1 guy for 2-3 gens and being forced to tunnel or camp just to get anything. 
---
Gotta do more then go from one locker to another all game long (not saying you did that, just an example of doing nothing all game long then escaping). 
---
After I killer damages a generator you are working on, you can continue to work on it. While the killer comes back you can use this and the killer would think the generator is still damaged and won’t search the area for survivors who was recently there.
---
Its not controversial its pretty much true. People like jendenise and kittychipz try to say its for that but youre part of the problem if more people played in the red ranks it would be fine. Also playing on xbox i rarely see the same people maybe after a couple of hours i'll run into someone. But barely.
---
Is this PC? If it is then that person is on my friends list
---
he literally relies on an unreliable perk to apply pressue that can give you only 3 perk slots at the start of the match and makes long ass chases. He's the one making himself lose
---
These conversations go nowhere because people do not understand the concept of an asymmetrical game.
---
The changes anyone suggests are always in the realm of balancing a solo survivor against a killer. It’s always “give me more tools to 1v1 the killer” when people fail to realize that survivors should only have 1/4th of the power that killers do. 
---
This is why BBQ &amp; Chili and We’re Gonna Live Forever are balanced the way they are. It doesn’t make sense to give survivors an equally powerful perk when there are 4 of you.
---
So, please stop comparing NOED to any survivor perk. 
---
And please understand the word “asymmetrical”.

I got hooked watching his perk review videos and when I tell you he was resonating everything I was thinking about those perks, I bout near exploded with happiness. 
---
Who said anything about NOED and being facecamped? Like the devs said, the two aren't equivalent.
---
I'm not a hypocrite. The DS change isn't bad. 
---
0 lies detected. 
---
So you blame him for losing this match. So you believe that one perk cost him the game? Interesting.
---
Yeah, if you don't listen to music or with the volume off, you can hear her. 
---
You also say the Wraith is bottom of the barrel? And that Pig has map pressure because they survivors have to hold m1 for 12 seconds? Believe what you wanna believe. Obviously you're having fun with it. And from how you think about the game, I can guarantee you wouldn't prove anything if me or any decent survivors go against you.
---
I like it.  Good job.  Clown is mid but outside of that it looks good.
---
The number of times I’ve hit the PS button while frantically struggling is unreal. 
---
Too many forget there’s human beings behind the character, not just A.I. Ironically now that I look back that’s exactly what he called me xD
---
As a wraith,I agree,we don’t play to give a fuck about the game otherwise we would play someone else
---
So you’re saying he gave up and this is why he lost?
---
Imagine calling a trial **a round**
---
Extra Blood Points for me.
---
I've explained Clown and Nurse in the other comment. 
---
Hag I feel is good where she is, I don't think she has any chase potential except blocking off a loop or setting up a camp by prox camping a hook and setting a trap down too.
---
Wraith let's be honest is really bad, he has counters and nothing to bring, he needs some love from the devs. High rank players, when they realize it's a Wraith will know to look for a glimmer the air and run away, Spine Chill completely counters everything he can do, when he uncloaks he's easily burnable, sure killers know how to look up or just away but we all make mistakes, nobody's perfect. In a chase he really has nothing but a basic M1 and maybe a boost from his uncloack which is risky to pull off anyway.
---
Freddy I don't want to talk about too, he's been nerfed for no reason and is currently just where he is in my mind. 
---
If you want to contribute more feel free too, I like discussing this :)
---
Lol you got mad because the survivor didn't give you an easy kill . Pathetic.
---
Would you prefer he went to a weaker loop or would you prefer he stood still? 
---
tomorrow.
---
don't skip school

r/titlegore
---
I mever minded going against a doctor to be honest
---
The worst is when We’ll Make It is running out, but your injured teammate won’t get off the gen. 
---
So you just sit there spam crouching and emotes.
---
Mind you, this is not last gen so no Adrenaline pop.
---
Partially him, but probably the map more than anything. It also took him quite a while to get into his second chase it seemed, as he seemed more content just complaining about the doors and windows. This is the problem I have with him, he takes a situation where he’s at a disadvantage from the start (Huntress on a horrible map for her) and spins it around to make it like the survivors are too strong.  It reminds me of the time he was complaining about being gen rushed in a game where even though he had Nurse, he was using no perks and no add-ons! And despite this, still got 2K. Any time he loses, he’s somehow going to blame survivors...even in this game where at the very start he acknowledges the difficulty he’s going to have on the map.
---
Not really, although I guess you could say that to an extent.
---
I’m saying he didn’t play very well that match, constantly complained, ignored DS (which is an awful tactic imo), and was unlucky in points. 
---
For example I don't think DS should have been nerfed but I also think NOED is fine
---
never played killer and I love NOED  
---
it makes people actually gtf out when exit gates are up  
---
makes the run for exit 10 times more exciting  
---
gives the killer a chance to down one or one more if he had a shit game
---
I mean, youre the asshole for tunneling because you were being looped and he's the asshole for being salty and disconnecting.
---
I was thinking about putting pig up a tier because she can have killer end game, same goes for Freddy, but I think she doesn't really have good chase potential and her power is mostly there to delay the game. 
---
I also explained why I positioned Clown so high in another comment! 
---
Thanks for liking it, means a lot, also thanks for contributing :)
---
I mean Freddy basically has an add-on that does that already. Not to mention there being a couple perks that would let you track survivors near instantly, as well as just being a lucky killer/unlucky survivor and bumping into each other instantly. Survivors would most likely have an equivalent of showing them the killer as well to help them avoid (or find the killer if that's what they want) the killer early game.
---
Keeping in mind this is an offering and is used to affect the first few seconds of a match and is in place of stuff like Mori's, map offerings, BP boosts, and etc. so it seems rather fair.
---
It's fake
---
"News"
---
Exactly this. He regularly doesn’t play very well because he spends time complaining about something or other then blames survivors. Also, again, never takes the DS hit even when it wouldn’t make a difference, making the end game harder for himself. 
---
True, but be realistic. Do you think an intelligent psychopath can design, prototype, and finally create his gear? Doc is smart but not *that* smart. The Entity “blessed” him with the Spark.
---
&gt;Legion, the only counterplay is to not be seen at any time during the match.
---
Same goes for Nurse, but everyone seems to be ok with that, something about "Nurse actually taking skill to use", whatever that means
---
In all seriousness tho, I don't understand that people are ok with nurse just because she requires skill. I understand that you can hide more easily from the nurse, but when she sees you and she has decent skill, she will get you within the first 30 seconds. Imagine in more serious games that a character is overpowered in the hands of a skilled person, that character would get nerfed, but in dead by daylight, I barely see people complaining about the Nurse. To me, she is an unfun killer to play as and an even more unfun killer to go against

It’s legion so, downvote and I’m gonna DC now.

You forgot the /s

If I find a less Skilled Survivor, than the others, I'll usually exploit that person to kill the others and then let him go.
---
Clown still can’t do anything against pallets. Billy still gets countered by vaults and pallets waste a bit of time too. The nurse doesn’t suffer from this.
---
I usually aim for dark clothing for Killers I don't usually play, but my Clown has a mix of the higher priced cosmetics. Though I'm kind of torn between the old set I used before Downtown Fair came out and the set up I have now.

what is the tea?
---
Well I am seeing it like this back when the game was based only on bloodpoints to pip we had games where the killer only had to max out their bloodpoints to pip so majority of the killers would be the "nice killer" and let whole bunches of survivors leave 0 kills and still pip. Yet survivors can do this very exact thing by not completing their objective which is actually a harder objective than the killer, but I think you should be guaranteed a pip if you escape period regardless if you botched the emblem system or not.
---
Maybe in a way that escape only helps and doesn't hurt you because right now if you leave too quickly and don't entertain the killer for a portion of time it can feel like you got penalised for escaping because you didn't meet pip requirements.
---
Screw the survivors. I'm hanging out with Amanda!
---
I don't know what you're talking about  .
---
It's always fun getting hate msgs. It means you're a badass + you can make them get ban (which happened more then once)
---
In all honesty the generator would terrify me more than anything as I’d probably get my hand caught in between some of the machinery or even worse my hair would get caught and pulled out really slowly as I scream and cry because my weave took me so long to perfect and I ain’t no Mönique Heart throwing that shift up into the rafters because my brown cow is stunning. 
---
You don't even have to run insidious for this to work.
---
You can get a 0k on killer and still pip a lot of people rank past their own skill level and just have unfun games where they’re constantly struggling
---
T. Baby killer
---
Thing about Leatherface is he's a brute. A retarded one but he's also got a chainsaw, eventually he'll get you. As for Freddy realistically he is just a crispy child molester with a sharp glove but since he occupies dreams he essentially becomes god so there's that. As for Pig I am not sure. Amanda sneaks around so she has an upper hand technically, and damn can she lunge far lol. 
---
I pretty much carried my scummy play style for the rest of the match and got a 4k, although they finished all generators and one guy could've escaped if he wasn't trying to save the others. They were pretty bad, but I'm not a great Huntress either.
---
U want a png of the dabbing leather face 
---
Pretty much. They do this after they dodge 5 lobbies in a row because someone had a P3 Face or cosmetics they bought from the store.

Yuh.

---
I dont even get the point of having a "main" in a game like this. The survivors are all just reskins . And while the killers are different, it's just not a competitive game like main eSports titles. Don't get me wrong. I. Fucking. Love. Dbd. It's just some of the language the community uses sometimes seems silly. 
---
Here’s my opinion. I’ve played since console launch. I’m nowhere near a Pro nor do I claim to be. I simply like to play (most of the time.)
---
Games are in the killers favor when it’s randoms most the time. I usually play solo,  and it’s a much more frustrating time due to players making the oddest choices.
---
SWF is usually what turns the tide against killers though. Usually these teams are capable of taking on even the most competent killers. Communication is extremely useful it in this game (stating killer location, ruin spots, gen placement, etc.) 
---
Honestly, this game needs one of two things. 1) SWF needs to be like Friday the 13th. In this game, when you chat near Freddy, your location is automatically revealed to killer, so you need to be cautious doing this. 2) Have a separate non ranked game mode for SWF. 
---
That’s right folks, I’m a karma whore!
---
These furries are getting out of hand. One day they snap and BAM. New killer

HahA YoU tOTaL NoOB gIT Gud lOL

In a day or 2 well see a post titled “why did i get banned”
---
I thought he went completely invisible when standing still, I must b retardo
---
Wow thanks on the contribution, you actually opened my eyes on Clown, I'd probably put him in B tier at this point, even tho he still is a damn good killer in my opinion. He also does have nearby map pressure, easily blocking gens with the toxins, survs scream when they get affected so he can switch targets, he's not that useless. 
---
Imo Hag is where she is because most survivors already know common hag trap spots (infinites, tighter spaces, near TL wall loops etc.) and as you fore-mentioned most players don't even utilize her full potential.
---
Wraith is pretty bad, bad chase potential, bad map pressure, no game slow down. In dire need of a buff.
---
I'll look through your profile on what you think about Freddy.
---
Thanks for contributing :)
---
I messed up big time, was thinking of his PTB when devs were testing thefeature!
---
I just started the game and every match I get some rank 10-15 survivors who write "gg ez" after the game while I'm still learning the controls lol.
---
Literally makes me want to stop playing the game. 
---

as a rank 1 killer and a rank 15 survivor, i can say i too am a diverse player between both and think that killers are weak and need a buff
---
I get that a lot in some of the games I play, that's why I turn off the game chat and other players mics
---
Main is refering to killer only, or survivor only, not which killer or survivor
---
He was. You did fine.
---
That's fine, it's my personal opinion, won't even acknowledge it, if you're going to criticize it might as well be constructive, not just "tier shit, git gud".
---
Haha alg
---
Yess! Thats exactly what I want!
---
My baaaaby girl! I love this so much.
---
Oh i get it. I guess you're right as in other games being a support main, or dps. I guess I've just never seen it used in the sense of choosing one of two roles. I play both. 
---
What minor today is going to know what White Chicks is
---
Np, you can probably find my tier list if you dig hard enough.
---
this but its monto and ruin
---
It’s frustrating when they don’t understand you want them to go, even when you smack a gen and  let them break free from you. It’s not as if the struggling makes much difference but I can see why people do it in hope.
---
David isn’t aggressive. What do you think WGLF is? David has few friends but will *die* for you. Fuck Jake. The guy went off the grid and is a loner. David is someone you want on your side.
---
So like even in our world, people can still sort of hear/feel what’s going on in the entity’s world? 
---
Little heads means that the killer has been equipped specifically for points.
---
Honestly I don't have a clue for most of the killers, these are just my best guesses. Please correct me so we can make an actual list.
---
Her ability is here to just prolong the game, I'll take Hill Billy for an example. 
---
Hill Billy has an ability to move really fast, break pallets really fast AND he gets to insta down survivors. That means his ability gains him map control and really good chase potential.
---
Amanda on the other side is mostly here to make the game longer. Sure she does have a stealth ability, but any better players when they realize it's pig will be on the lookout and probably won't be caught off guard. Sure you can get a hit on a player that isn't looking, but after that you have nothing to help you in the chase, only thing you can do is submit to loops and hope for that other hit and messup on the side of the survivor.
---
Her RBT are not there to kill in high ranks, they're just there to make a survivor waste time and get no progress done. She does have a really good end game, putting on bear traps with remember me and blood warden is really good. I feel like she is pretty balanced and deserves the spot she got :)
---
I didnt laugh until like the third time I saw this and then I laughed way too hard
---
This is the reason I made the comment, most people make a comment like this and then I realise they haven't played against an actual good Nurse yet. Turning around is one of the last things they'll get triked by, I'll admit, it feels good when you dodge a nurse this way, but I've seen enough good nurses to know that that doesn't work and even if you manage to trick her with it, it isn't very reliable. Most nurses will guess you'll backtrack, they'll teleport to a place where wether you chose to backtrack or continue running, they'll be able to get you with a very quick second blink, that is if you were out of range to begin with. Not to mention that a nurse can also teleport at the ground further being able to modify where they blink to.
---
&gt;Once she goes into her long cooldown you can just duck behind something.
---
Yes if you are fortunate anough to dodge her blink, you could do this, but many nurse will run shadowborn and monitor and abuse, making it pretty plausible for her to keep an eye on you and just teleport at you, knowing exactly where you hid.
---

Welcome to Reddit.
---
We all know it’s coming, the Omega Anti-Gen build. 
---
Coming Spring 2019!
---
Half the time I think they forget it’s your job to kill them, using a diverse range of methods, and vice versa. 
---
Got 1m bloodpoints saved, 7000 auric cells for whatever new cosmetics drop.
---
I’m ready to start vomiting over survivors, especially our new Thicc friend
---
Reality is weird once Eldritch gods like the entity become involved, so it’s a possibility 
---
It's not really a white chick movie. You should watchit it's hilarious. 
---
I love playing Spirit without addons, honestly (No offense) I think it comes down to a skill level then. If you dont use it for full duration, the recharge and duration arent a problem. Her 110 movespeed is paired with one of the best abilities in the game for map pressure and counter looping. She is incredibly strong and a lot of people dont feel that and it makes me sad. I guess thats a personal thing though.
---
I’m not sure why my main as well is so low. I know she doesn’t have instadown and her game is based off of slowing the game down, but imo she is bar far the most fun killer to play and have many options for builds due to being stealth like MM
---
Oh but Nurse heavily depends on Barbecue to continue pressuring, I don't think a killer needs any perk, but with the right one they become so much more deadly. With Nurse its easily BBQ so she can instantly start pressuring more, while Billy needs Bamboozle to get fast downs and go on to other survivors. 
---
Yeah agreed.
---
I rarely see anyone using blood warden when I play survivor. But when it works, it's the funniest perk ever.
---
I can see how they are panicking on the other side. It's worth using for moments like these. 
---
Ahahaha, calling NOED OP and (old) DS not OP. That's hilarious. 
---
100% agreed, people should just learn to counter NOED. If they nerf it, casuals on yellowranks will have a much easier time, but the people who are actually good can punish every mistake you make on a weaker tier killer even more.
---
Would not be fun to be forced to play the nurse in every game... For the them to play against a good nurse neither.
---
Oh don't worry, I need you alive for when the exit gates are powered.
---
 I love Rancor.
---
I’ve always though the entity has been very similar to a Lovecraft creation
---
How? You can slow turn it and it still works.
---
Leatherface without addons basically has no power
---
I've often lost survivors either because I chase after the noise I made or, more likely, see movement in the corner of my eye, swing and realise I just swung at the corn I moved out of the way myself
---
Oh no people that cannot are playing a game that requires aiming.
---
Currently 50% off on the online PlayStation store, 60% with PlayStation Plus. So if your friend's birthday before the end of the month, there ya go-
---
THIS IS AWESOME! ❤️❤️
---
Yup, that's why he's so low!
---
I feel that, especially since I'm a bit new to the game and I'm maining killers
---
Most people put her as a bad killer in general. Even with addons her most useful addons are her grey addons. Also her ability can be removed at 1 box so its very much so a RNG ability. At high ranks its not too hard to loop her either. Just comes down to skill and opinion i guess.
---
Getting murdered isn't supposed to be fair. 
---
Palming it usually works better for me but I’ve stopped trying that hard 😂
---
Game’s definitely balanced in favour of the survivors but hang in there, it gets easier somewhat. If you need tips on any particular killer I can help a little if it’s someone I’ve played a good amount. 
---
It’s not all survivors bullying killer, as you get better you’ll learn to mindgame and counter their own strategies. Ignore the toxic behaviour for now it’s an unfortunate plague on both sides
---
&gt; You asking that question shows that you don't get why people downvoted you in the first place. It is also the reason this post was made. Those randoms would also like to escape and if the first hooked person inidiately suicides, then ge not only prevented any chances of escaping for himself, but also for his teammates
---
That still doesn't answer why should I care about what others want in a solo queue. 
---
People don't care about me when they dip out as soon as the exit gates are open. They don't care when they bring the killer towards me on puporse with the assistance of Bond. They don't care when they unhook me in front of the killer.
---
fucking course she's ash, why wouldn't she be ash?
---
Yeah ikr haha
---
Everything has to be fair and balanced in a game whose premise is 4 v 1. I'm with you there 100%.
---
So the perk who fucks up a complete game(when you are on a weaker tier killer) which has literally not a single counter (Enduring doesn't really counter it) got nerfed to much? Explain?
---
I love playing Spirit too, but I realise she is heavily limited without addons. Shes like old Hag, super strong but held back.
---
*Mickey*
---
i use a bunch of cosmetics for doc but it usually boils down to p3 head or blight head on a suit skin or victorian skin with the victorian weapon if i’m using a suit body; black bandage head on the red and black trench coat with the blight weapon is a _perfect_ color combo and has been my recent favorite
---
*shrug*
---
Y'all it's Michael Jackson
---
So basically a DC that gives you blood points.
---
I like all of the proposed changes except bloodpoint gain. I feel that 100% is just too much. A solid 50% or even 75% would be good, but 100% just feels like a little too much in my opinion
---
EDIT: May as well just share it: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b0sgeq/reworked_my_tier_list_a_bit_added_where_i_feel/
---
without addons leatherface is even worse than freddy. At least freddy can stall the game
---
I run no mither sometimes and have fun doing so.  Iron will and tenacity a must with it though.  Not worrying about healing and this is not happening make you into a stealth gen destroyer if you do not get caught.  Being always exposed is difficult at times but it’s a fun build to run regardless.  Without iron will and tenacity I wont touch it though. Those combos are an absolute must.  
---
Play every game with nurse. Don't go easy on them. If they want to ruin your fun with matching taunting names, tbagging and red shirts, ruin theirs. 
---
How hasn’t this been removed? I had a situation almost exactly like this; scratched out the player’s name, posted the screenshot here, and it got removed for “salty after game chat”. Either apply the rule to none or everyone.
---
The salt at the end too haha priceless xD
---
I think that if you could see some real good spirit gameplay you might change your mind. Fungoose is playing spirit right now if you are up from watching a quick game of no addons.
---
I kind of already motivated why I think it isn't too much, but: killer already have a perk that pretty much guarentees them a 100% increase and they even get an extra strong effect with it. I feel like it would be balanced for a perk that gives you a disadvantage to give you double the bloodpoints. Not to mention that I'd like a bloodpoint gain buff in general
---
And this is relevant how? 
---
You said you would befriend the fastest.
---
Pretty much, if you play "nicely" unless someone's being annoying as fuck and only do it in response, it's better than doing it all the time going "ALL SURVIVORS ARE TOXIC SO I TUNNEL"
---
If you say it was never an issue, you are a)only playing toptier level nurse or b) not versing high skilled and coordinated swf groups. 
---
I've been to r1 killer every month i actively played so far and honestly, you can't really play Hag,Freddy etc. Against good people. Why? If you know what you are doing you can run a freddy or any lowtier killer around for min 2 gens, then ds and waste another gen. Game done. The killer has to camp to secure at least one kill and thats it. I honestly don't play any other killer than nurse on redrank anymore because i know i will go up against such bs and have no way to counter it. That was the big issue with DS, it was ment to be a second chance perk for new people, but it was way to strong in the hands of a good looper.
---
&gt;  Although if you think balance means Kills average 3-4 Kills/game then that would explain things
---
53 win rate for killers sin't unbalanced you can't get it to be perfectly 50/50. And if you think that it should be 50/50 I am done with you, there is no point talking to someone who doesn't understand balance. The Game is annoying but not unbalanced. Some maps favor killers and some favor survivor, that is just how it is. Iridescent Head are Ultra Rare add-ons, they are suppose to offer a lot of power. You still have to aim the hatchet which takes practice. And dodging hatchets is easy, its all about mind gaming, both as a killer and survivor. You seems to have no clue what balance is and that really shows. All you say is "this is unbalanced" you never bring up why, except for stats that doesn't even prove your point.
---
You damn legend. Adr. is fine tho 
---
Fuck man, this gets me every damn time.
---
Did you have a stroke at the end of that?
---
Looks awesome bro! Keep it up. Try it with some color if you can, I'd like to see that
---
Or Joe.
---
WAKE UP!!!!!
---
NO YOU WAKE UP!!!!!
---
It's Nea the Killer
---
I agree with you but it’s also the best feeling when you get a free kill because a claudette gets cocky near the exit gates...
---
Not bad, pretty funny. Keep it up
---
You mastermind, you incited exactly what you wish to see in your own comments! Dastardly, I applaud you.
---
Trapper can do it somewhat easily if you know how to play him well. You get 1000 for trapping someone and an extra 500 if you pick them up out of it, which if you're herding them right is easy enough. But you should always, of course, spam Trap Placement at the end to get as close to max as possible. 
---
i love how kate playing the guitar fits sOOOO well
---
I just feel like that would be too much BP. As much as I love having an absolute bunch of it, earning triple the normal amount every match just by running those two perks is a bit much and would take away from the grind.  
---
It's not a well-known fact, but yeah. Paired with the no bleeding, you could easily lose the killer, assuming the killer actually slugs you, which is unfortunately very unlikely.  
---
I basically mean that it wouldn't be good to give it too many effects, especially not ones that are too similar to other perks. If you already get the 9% from No Mither, why even bother with Resilience?  
---
I like the current system where you pretty much have to use perks in conjunction with No Mither. It gives purpose to having a build with the perk as its foundation, instead of having it just be the entire build.
---
HybridPanda just said on his stream that yesterday he was in McLean's stream. Someone asked McLean to comment on the japanese PS4 Twitter and McLean said "Well, we asked them to stop announcing things before we do, but they basically said 'this is our way of building hype to that effect. So it sounds like tomorrow. We will have to see.
---
Lmao Pig is WAY better than Trapper and Wraith chopping people with a pool noodle.  There's actually impact and them struggling.
---
I'm pretty sure that the games you sre describing is a minority of the games, also, it again shows the reason you sre being downvoted: you have no concideration for other people. Since there are a few people that screw you over, you think everyone is like that and thus it is ok to screw them over. This in turn actually makes you a part of the small portion of people that have other people say "they screwed me over, so I screw them over". I will probably get downvoted for saying this last bit, but: the community doesn't want you in dead by daylight, please leave the game so that you don't create more people like you
---
Poor horse
---
Naw Myers. Usually only get to rank 4 at most lmao at a certain point is becomes as I said... Annoying.
---
After seeing what high rank swfs are like I lost any interest in ranking up anymore lmao.
---
Eh so maybe your right if competive play is indeed unbalanced.
---
These days I play games more for fun then competively so it's easy forget that there's a whole other view on such things.

gotta remember that a lot of us console players are young teens and think they're hot shit. therefore if they escape it's because they were infinitely better than you and if they die it's because you played scummy /s

About this, I'd like to mention a match I recorded yesterday, I didn't have time to put it online and am not home at the moment, so can't link it or anything, but I got hit while vaulting trough a window, I crawled away imidiately, by the time the killer was at the other side of the building, he already lost me, this was the best No Mither moment I've had so far. I was on death hook, but because of this, I managed to get up, finish a gen and escape, thank you, No Mither + Tenacity 
---
Rank 1 Survivor and Killer here. I feel the game is balanced tbh, if not slightly killer-sided with these new changes. Decisive Strike did not need a nerf, imo. NOED seems fine to me.
---
Survivor mains and Killer mains are each bitching about the other side being too powerful, when in reality it's fairly balanced.
---
This is all my opinion.
---
Takes 7 seconds for him to be a normal killer. Ranks 10-20 he's great. Ranks 1-10 He's trash. His power doesn't help at all in a chase. You won't lose survivors easily? Cool. Can you beat pallets? Windows? Mind games? Range? No. No you can.g
---
That's an awesome cosplay but seeing as you now have that mask in person, how the hell does one see out of it?!
---
Bing bong
---
I've learned to only do it to people I really enjoyed playing against. It can be the difference between them getting angry (few too many bad matches in a row and it happens to all of us) and them enjoying themselves and trying another round. You always feel pretty happy when the killer does that
---
Right? I don't think that ever hasn't thrown me from a Chase. 
---
I recomend chosing something else than unbreakable. I did that at first too, but if you manage to get up with the unbreakable boost, you were probably also gonna get up with the regular No Mither. I think you'd get more use out of another perk. Still, you do you, try unbreakable all you like, it's far from useless on the build, but I'd prefer having something else in my kit than going all out on the tought that I'll be able to get up from the downed state myself.
---
I love using No Mither, I often feel more confident when using it. Hex totem that might be haunted grounds? Not like it will affect you. Michael stalking you? What's he going to do? You already go down in one hit, it's not like he'll suddenly be able to instantly ki- never mind that. Leatherface? Don't make me laugh, his power is useless on you. NOED? The hell is that? Why are all my teammates fleeing tho? *goes to hook, distracts killer and escapes unharmed while team resques hooked survivor*
---
He's great for discussing history and numbers, and what those numbers mean. But for balance mmm. I hate to say it but Tyde is not as good as he thinks he is (just like me haha). But killers like Tyde and I are a perfect example of one of the worst problems with this game: the rank system. I shouldn't be high rank lol, I'm not good. And yet, basically because I have enough hours in the game, I can climb without trying really
---
This’ll be easy

It probably should be given conditions, like getting a certain amount of hooks

Yes. All other killers have good characters and backstories. The clown has absolutely nothing to offer in either of those aspects. 
---
Even then I feel it's a bit much, but I understand your reasoning
---
Reduced stun time, and only triggers if you’re downed within 60 seconds of being unhooked. Instead of being a crutch second chance perk, they’re making it an anti-tunneling perk
---
Moreover you don’t start off as the obsession - if you hit your DS you become the obsession (So it changes mid match)

All other killers are decent in some way. He is not.

These are not the minority of the games, more like every game. When I tried to play differently and work as a team, it would happen again and I would have only myself to blame for being dumb. People in solo queue don't care about you and you shouldn't care about them. If people are playing SWF with 3 players, they don't care about the random.

THEN I'LL DIE DOING WHAT I LOVE.
---
Wait, so no more DS after I down someone and start carrying them to the hook? 
---
Why is pig and hag A tier? Why is wraith B tier? What the fuck is Hunteress doing down there? Which genius put doctor all the way down there.
---
I just like saving time as much as possible. It also effectively gives me more self-revivals, should I need them, but I'm more into the whole saving 6-7 seconds.

Someone’s toxic

Because cleansing totems is hard.

MVP to the 1%ers who do this

The main Problem i have with him(talking about a lerfect played freddy vs a perfect played swf) is 
---
a) the rng (sc after the pallets and hope for a sc to waste more time)
---
B)That his power doesn't really help him while in a chase, that puts him in such a loopable position and you have to rely on mindgames*not viable against toptier loopers imo*, which can be won but if fucked up the survivor can stun you and still get a sc to waste more time. Also it puts him in a disadvantage in key situations:instahooksaves, hatch, exit gates, adrenaline plays, instaheal plays.
---
Tldr: He is good against unexperienced people but will loose against a r1 swf most lf the time because it is really easy to waste the killers time.
---
Lmao, right next to a hook too! Been there, feels bad 😫
---
Nope. I know, I know. Save your tears of joy. You’ll need a full bucket to collect all the salty survivor tears. In all seriousness I really like the change
---
Nurse: Yeah... nerf legion am i rite guys?
---
Let's not pretend that a good portion of these "kids" aren't grown-ass men.
---
Or you get a Dwight that refuses to heal you because even though you had a trap on your head you didn’t save him until stage 2
---
I am so happy, this is beautiful. 
---
He's like freddy. Great against surviviors who can't loop or play properly. Rank 1-10 "gg ez baby killer git gud lmao"
---
lmao
---
I've only encountered Blood Warden once, and I hope I never encounter it again lol. I was literally at the exit game screaming WHAT?? OH MY GOD, NO!! and tried to bail to the inside of the map. But Spirit wasnt having that, hahah. The whole squad died when just moments before we were all about to live.
---
It is. Now early game momentum means something, and loops won’t last twice as long
---
Have you been living under a rock for the past month? 😂
---
I’m down when I get home from work. bloodyblackout18 
---
Yep :)
---
You obviously either dodge SWF teams or don't play at rank 1 killer often. Going against a team with 4 DS is pretty common. Adding an extra 20 seconds to a chase because you can hit a skill check is insane and was a total get out of jail free card being able to use it before you had even been hooked once.
