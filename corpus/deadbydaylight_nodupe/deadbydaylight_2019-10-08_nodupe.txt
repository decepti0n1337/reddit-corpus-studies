Bubba should be Naive and Misguided.

---
I mean, yes, they are, but that's kind of the point. Escaping shouldn't be easy 
---

---
The worst killer, Legion, has a kill rate of 50%
---
Even the worst killer is statistically likely to tie...
---
What movie is this and where can I watch it?
---
You can't equate you not laughing to something not being funny. I don't have a problem with the joke and the fact that it's still getting posted and upvoted means nobody else does either
---
These add-ons are going to be forever maligned if they don't also adjust the BP maximums when you take them. Earning deviousness at a slightly faster rate isn't really going to be worth crippling your power for if you could otherwise max it out anyway. In fact, you should be aiming to max it out anyway, and the add-ons just reward poor play.
---
Basically, hitting the cap usually means you wasted a (4000-5000 BP?) add-on and gave yourself a handicap for almost no reason.
---
Essentially the creator mentioned every film after the first one was just money grabbing. Same with the ‚Äúbrother‚Äù reveal - it was added to the original movie‚Äôs tv release to give it extra runtime.
---
Just realized megface has smeared lipstick...
---
ah yes, not like this change will completely gut her map pressure or patrolling ability, oh wait it does. There was almost never a time you would miss your first two blinks to get a hit (unless you were shit) the only times you would actually consistently use back2back double blinks was to traverse the map...
---
instead of nerfing every single killer into the ground why not re-balance all of them so that any one of them can be viable options for winning? I mean, is it unreasonable to want a balanced roster of killers who's abilities lend themselves to different playstyles all of which can get a 4 kill game, instead of everyone going spirit because that's the only way to win?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
further more, what was wrong with the nurse before? a slower movement speed, slower than survivors, meant she needed to rely entirely on her power to catch survivors, plus with a slight stun after each blink why do we need to wait for her blinks to recharge too? honestly the usefulness of this killer combined with the skill needed to properly utilize her made her feel pretty balanced to me.
---
If he starts chasing you, take him near a vault, if he revs his chainsaw? vault, literally nothing he can do about it. After negating that power, hes just an m1 killer, with no powers.
---
Undetectable status lasts only 16 seconds tho
---
Not far at all. It was fairly obvious from your reply. gg
---
Leatherface got down and dirty and then cut off her face
---
I'm very glad you didnt hurt yourself during that reach.
---
I think Legion should be broken up, Frank in Psychopaths and everyone else where Legion is now
---
Also the baby demo dog was shown to be able to be friendly with humans for candy
---
Gives an additional blink(s) but greatly increases exhaustion time?
---
You were right!
---
Bro you actually post about KSI, you're 12 get a life :) roflll
---

---
As a survivor, my biggest problem with self-care isn't efficiency, it's when people choose to self-heal in the corner of the map while no gens are getting done.
---
As a killer, my favorite thing about self-care is that people choose to self-heal in the corner of the map while no gens are getting done.
---
The hardest killers would be the lowest tiered ones, wouldn't they? It's harder to win as legion than nurse
---
Looks amazing
---
If we're comparing them at the height of their lore, Myers is objectively more evil than Freddy since he is the literal form of evil and is the only one that can defy the entity. Freddy does more evil things i suppose, but that doesnt knock Myers being evil itself.
---
Also I suppose, but Myers has no qualms killing children, he only spared one baby afaik and it was likely because it wasnt in his way or related to his obsession
---
I find the Torn Bookmarks LOS requirement a severe detriment.
---
Bring it on m8. DAVID KING IS GONNA LIVE FOREVA!
---
I ain't afraid of no floating sushi rolls
---
God I hate that.  I main survivor, and occasionally switch it up to killer to have chill games (i main spirit as killer...yeah, i know).
---
When I do play as spirit, though, I basically judge the way the survivors are playing.  So I have rules:
---
1.  If somebody pulls you off the hook in front of me, they're going down.  I will not ever chase the person pulled off the hook (unless they violated rule 3).
---
2.  If I'm constantly finding you not doing anything, you're going to die.
---
3.  If you teabag/flashlight click, don't be surprised if you get tunneled and camped.
---
That screaming addon honestly sounds trash. What‚Äôs even the point?
---
Common add ons will be like mini perks from now on. Just look at wraith!
---
Giving the nurse Stridor as an add on adds flavor to the teachable. She doesn't need the perk, but she can use and teach it
---
Whats with his facial expressions in general omegalul
---
Send feedback **after** playing the damn thing
---
And you're delusional if she's legion tier now, you're still able to blink over walls and you don't get pallet looped.
---
Susie mains (including me) prefer hot/cute over cool
---
Marlton is Dwight brother (Plot twist)
---
And it's a drag, a good player won't exactly be overwhelming, but can get the whole match mending, and then using self care and only then doing anything useful
---

The post says the recharge starts when the fatigue starts and I would assume it stops when you charge a blink. So essentially if you blink twice, 3 second fatigue, 1 blink ready right off the bat, wait 3 seconds for your second one if you need it.
---
If you only use 1 blink you come out the fatigue 1 second away from getting it back
---
Annnnnndddd disconnect
---
Why are you so good to me?
---
I'm not worthy
---
And with scratched mirror myers you just have to avoid literally ever map except the game, lery's, and hawkins. Its an addon. Use it with a coldwind offering.
---
Isn't it a DBD meme to mori TTV's? You know? Because they are self-advertising??
---
Honestly I wouldn't like these changes at all. The unique thing about Spirit is that you don't know what she's doing at all times. If this part of her was removed, she'd be the most generic killer in the game besides leatherface
---
If you're going to nerf spirit, maybe give her a brief window after exiting haunting where she can't do damage or get grabs, she can still lunge to get the distance but no hitboxes would come out until after that brief window.
---
To be fair I just looked at the comments and saw u lol
---
You can see her legs just fine. Those are thin leggings.
---
doc is the cutest though
---
Why does every new killer power need to have a cooldown? Nurse, spirit, ghostface, demogorgon, legion, clown, Freddy... Next the chainsaw killers will have a gas meter.
---
I dunno he doesnt seem *Aggitated*

          Dwight: ‚ÄúI wish I was in a locker‚Äù
---
Now, I'm not arguing that the Nurse changes are good, but I wanna address something. 
---
&gt;So apparently BHVR's answer to Nurse and Spirit being the only consistently viable killers at red ranks is not to buff the other killers, but to nerf them into the ground. Because mark my words, Spirit will be next.
---
Yeah, that's how games work dude. If you have one or two overpowered character compared to the other dozen or so, of course you try to nerf the OP ones. Why would you every try to bring every other character up when you can bring two of them down?
---
Again, not saying these are good changes, but it's clear Nurse does need some level of nerf.
---
We don‚Äôt have a dog. I think it was either a blanket or a rob
---
BP doesn't directly relate to rank
---
I have thousands of hours on BO2 and I'm so mad I never saw the resemblance before
---
Yes, corn, every killer's friend
---
You can stun the nurse with a well time pallet drop. And with how strong she was with 5 blinks, or Omega, you needed to high roll that stun to not go down every time.
---
I‚Äôm crying
---
Yet insta's still exist and not nerfed, The removal of 3 blink was far too much, 5 blink completely agree broken, 4 blink yea op as hell but theres still op addons via survivor, 3 blink was like a minor steroid compared to 4-5 blink and now its dead, and before you say thats good and all.......The overwhelming majority of her addons were GUTTED.
---
Gen speed is definitely not fine.
---
Dropping gen speed any more will just make playing survivor unbearable. It's already a massive plod to sit on a gen, if they make it any worse people just won't want to play.
---
That addon will be liked scratched mirror.
---
Except the opposite. You only use it with a coldwind offering instead of using it with a lery's
---
Honest opinion here. 
---
He sort of does have the potential to be a powerful killer at lower ranks but once you hit purples/red, you never see him. He‚Äôs sort of the laughing stock of the bunch now that Freddy‚Äôs viable. 
---
If you ask me, his potential strength lies in purely in Survivor mistakes. He does have opportunity there but survivors that are at least decent at looping and smart enough to not bunch together near a basement are easily able to stomp him. I think the fact that he has a power that is so dependent on survivor skill is a large part of what makes him a low-tier killer.
---
I'm not a nurse main. But this just spells out what's to be had with spirit next and it makes me sad.
---
And in the Never Sleep Again documentary Robert said that everything was sexual with Freddy and he lorded that power over people when he was alive. In the actor's mind and the original concept he was a pedophile. Just because it doesn't blast you in the face with it for 8 movies doesn't make it not true.
---
Defy the entity? By tombstoning without a mori?
---
sm√∂ll
---
I have to ask: are you lunging a lot? Just cause I had a similar problem when I started playing Killer until I realized I was only lunging. If you get right on a Survivor and just tap it, it works much better in those situations. 
---
It‚Äôs also a useful way to make Survivors toss pallets and get them out of play. :P
---
its adding 3 sec every time you use double blink for moving around the map, in an average game you prob use it  about 60 times, thats 180sec/3mins where you walk around not only slow as fuck at 3.85/s ms but also alot of it fatigued, and how much can a team of 4 survs do in 3 mins? well gen is 80 sec since this is 3 mins of nurse downtime where she cant really do anything thats 1 surv on each of 4 gens getting done and they could 3/4 man a 5th, so in a game with this added downtime you could literally do 5 gens and open an exit gate.
---
I use it on Jeff. Goes great with his breakdown.
---
Rifts? Yes and the Halloween event is tied to it.
---
You'll get your points to buy Halloween cosmetics in the free track of the battle pass.
---
Nice! maybe ill start playing nurse now since shes more balanced
---
Same goes for Billy and Trapper.
---
Except I'm hardwired to the router that's less then a foot away.
---
The plague, despite her power and uniqueness, is a dull killer inside and out, her reasoning, her attacks, shes just not scary.
---
But ... muh SWFs! 
---
Devs have also said they‚Äôre trying to balance out solo play and SWFs... which of course hasn‚Äôt happened.
---
You said the spirit again instead of the plague in your second paragraph
---
I guess they think his is easier. Personally I think rite of the jaws is a lot more difficult. At rank 8 survivors fall for the trap tricks a lot less.
---
Ever played against a good spirit? There's gonna be more of them. Way more. Good luck handling them, I guess. You'll need it.
---
Theres always a better offer for the former, the latter will not change their mind.
---
Not really. She‚Äôs got more than three. Tampered timer, crate of gears, rule set no2, jigsaw‚Äôs sketch, and straps combined with video tape.
---
Amanda‚Äôs Letter gives you close range wallhacks at the cost of your traps, it‚Äôs not even that good
---
i was obviously talking about 8k in each category
---
It's almost like humor is subjective!
---
Its her hope it feeds on
---
I assume they're just old, so they just haven't updated them yet.
---
They added a cooldown after her cooldown? She was already frustrating to play since she had to look at the ground anytime she used her power (that she's forced to use to traverse the map). Now she gets to be stuck in place staring at the ground. Then spend a couple seconds walking slower than survivors. Then she get's another chance to move/attack again. It sounds like her power is going to be a detriment to her at this point.
---
Breaking news : Self defense, now just as bad as murder. Rip Lisa
---
when you have a meltdown about how the sky is falling because you have to wait 3 more seconds after fatigue for a double blink.
---
Sorry that you can't auto win and get free hits that survivors couldn't do anything about anymore.
---
No I wait until I'm in range then they leave my vision and I can't hit them
---
Same,  I needa chill. Red ranks just stress me out hahah killers are too scary
---
F
---
I play killer sometimes, it's just the long queue times that keep me a mostly survivor main.
---
Literally says its officially untrue, if you want to believe he is that's fine, but the director and writing team decided that its false
---
Kinda, it by what I've seen looks like one but we have no clue how it works yet
---
There's no hyperbole here. None at all.
---
Insta saw and speed boost are pretty anoying on a Leatherface
---
But arent they different? it needs 2 people and the extra sound range really helps. Although the power level of discordance is indeed better, the play given by surveillance where you kick a gen and wait for someone to get back to it is something discordance cant do?
---
I run Corrupt Intervention to buy myself some room in the beginning and puke on gens, Ruin or PGTW to do some genny damage/slow the game, M&amp;A to be able to get closer to survivors and a bigger terror radius in chases since it pairs well with Infectious Fright. 
---
Plague has a really good slugging game and that‚Äôs usually what I go for. Get everyone infected, start downing people and chase the ones that scream. I have pretty good success rates with this in red ranks. Obviously remember to hook people if no one is revealed by IF. I usually bring an apple and the vomit effectiveness add-ons.
---
Hey, I‚Äôm sure Susie likes to bake something cute every now and then at least
---
Yeah completely agree. My main tactic revolves around the speed boost. Hit with deep wound, if you lose em, you lose em. Catch up if you do hit them, end the streak (don‚Äôt hit so you keep progress) and now your closer to the survivor. It works in almost every occurrence
---
Crate of gears only makes it like 2% harder at best, jigsaw's sketch never seems to work, and the straps and video tape should have some stronger add ons as well since they don't really do all that much. The letter allows you to get free hits on people who do generators/ gen grabs, works very well on lery's, the game, and hawkins
---
Take me away huntress
---
The trick to trapper dailies is to just drop them in random ass places.  Good players look for traps to be in places that make sense, so put them in places that don't really make sense.
---
It's like art is an interpretation or something.
---
Clutch saves.
---
This is what good players can do. #EPIC
---
This is what SWF think they are doing when they bait DS and head on plays. #NOTEPIC
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to see a new original character
---
Okay Susie might be the exception with that group
---
Finally the bad nurses can't rely on a broken killer
---
Unfortunate
---
Ok I agree. I remember looping a bubba to unhook someone in the basement but I still got downed because of getting to close even though I wasn‚Äôt remotely close by
---
The Entity doesn't care about personal morals, lore wise it will torture them until they relent and start killing because it's a better alternative to what they're being inflicted with
---
Its odd how long people complained that Nurse's power and shitty add on choices allow her to ignore a good amount of the mechanics in the game but now since she's getting nerfed its being used as an excuse that every other killer is weak and that instead of buffing them BHVR is nerfing Nurse.
---
I'm not saying that other killers aren't weak and that the Nurse rework is amazing but you cannot deny the impact Nurse has had since her release and how her status as basically THE top tier killer since then says something about her balance state. 
---
She isn't being nerfed/add-ons reworked because she's the only *good* killer, she's being reworked because her power and add-ons in its current state make her unbalancable.
---
owo
---
I fucking love this, you‚Äôve made my day
---
Pig is certainly fun no doubt
---
I've been thinking more and more that adding a third step is needed to lengthen games without it feeling boring. Right now it's just power gens &gt; open door, if they added in something else I think it could help a lot.
---
This only happens if im surv we cant find it if im killer its right in the open everyone finds it:(
---
They arent nerfing insta's i bet.
---
No, that isn't what it means.
---
The blink will look exactly the same as it used to to the Nurse. As it is right now she can swing the moment the blink ends and register a hit on the survivor before she visibly appears on the survivor's screen. Now she is going to be visible before the swing starts, so you can be physically able to react to it.
---
I don‚Äôt care if the survivors bring op addons I just get over it play the game and don‚Äôt constantly bitch about it
---
Okay, after a quick search, yes they WERE bugged but after spirit (long time ago) they were fixed. What I read was either someone spreading misinformation or an old Post that I didn't read the timestamp on
---
You and your girlfriend playing dbd together reminds me how one time a girlfriend farmed me and let me die on hook. I called them an idiot and got inv to a party and her boyfriend threatened to beat me up. Pretty funny
---
Not in this instance. Against really good survivors Nurse and Spirit are the only ones where you always have a chance, that makes all the other killers objectively underpowered.
---
It‚Äôs not a joke though. She needs to stop being nerfed. We can‚Äôt forget about her
---
Guess we know what plague and/or Nancy are into...
---
Ah that makes sense
---
I like it. The only reason im gonna play her is after the changes. Nurse was unreasonably overpowered. The balance changes makes her a real killer instead of a cheat code to win.
---
How did you achieve this?
---
Demogorgan and the spirit
---
If you teabagged at the end the comments would be much different
---
Yeah man bringing attention to a low tier killer who keeps getting unnecessary nerfs is getting old, you‚Äôre right. We should just forget about her and leave her to be nerfed into oblivion
---
[deleted]
---
Bruh
---
4k Resolution. It's not good.
---
More like final hide and seek.
---
Definitely makes me excited to use bag of gears and crate of gears to troll people with having an absurd crate time. Probably be better to use jigsaw's sketch though
---
It's available RIGHT NOW in the shrine of Secrets for the next 24 hours. So if you don't have enough iri shards start grinding tonight. I just bought it a couple days ago and literally just got it in the blood web for the Killer I'm currently levelling a minute ago and about to try it out first time. But I've watched videos of people running it and it is definitely good.
---
Shitpost?
---
Liar you posted two weeks ago about your YouTube
---
Myers should have is own tier... tier.... 3 exposed you die bye bye.
---
no but for real the dude is pure concentrated evil methodically ending lives to the best of his ability with seemingly no reactions otherwise.
---
pop goes the weasel
---
This is an amazing buff for Spirit.  Great job!
---
get lost u idiot
---
That‚Äôs not what it says at all.
---
Combine them, or use crate and tampered, both make a large amount of game overs by careless survivors
---
Yes you can, humor is an opinion, if your opinion is that it isn‚Äôt funny then that does mean it‚Äôs not funny, even if it‚Äôs just you.
---
You can fully have your own sense of humor and think something is funny, but I am also able to point out things I don‚Äôt find humorous.
---
Fuck nurse and all the people who play her for free wins.
---
I didn't say she'd be miles away, I'm saying that just going around some walls makes her have to go around too like every other killer but slower. She could be 1 blink distance away but as long as there's a high wall she can't do anything about it.
---
Fixing a bug is not a nerf, she shouldn't be faster than any other killer while carrying a survivor. Is she weak? Then write an actual good rework change instead of the same content
---
So what? Those survivors earn those points separately, they don't add up their earnings at the end of the match and each get the total sum. It doesn't take a mathematician to notice that survivors earn way less points than killers.
---
That 1 killer will earn more than any of the individual survivors in the match.
---
I took a hit for Bill to so he could finish opening the door, we were free to walk out so I left.
---
But of course Bill had to turn back into the killer to try to be rude to him and got downed and killed for it.
---
Not disappointed in the David and Meg, just Bill for being dumb.
---
Like he said, it‚Äôs just a phase!
---
Technically the nurse is a victim as well
---
Definitely Michael Myers no doubt. Spirit might be the best killer after Nurse's nerf. Other than that, Freddy, Ghostface and Demogorgon are also great options.
---
Yeah I was only referring to that one fix, my bad. Shouldn‚Äôt have used the term *nerf* if I was talking about a *fix*
---
Says you who's getting downvoted every comment cause you're so braindead lmao
---
Thinking Trapper has some good stuff actually.
---
Bill on a hook*
---
Think the only difference between him and Freddy is Myers kills and that‚Äôs it Freddy kills and is a chomo
---
Lol, people who never fought a pig are such cuties "oh I have a trap on my head, I'll finish this gen real quick" or "oh no, the gate is open and I just got a trap, better go get it off"
---
Advanced stupid it is, and guy didn't even have Dead Hard as far as I remember. So why he ran back into the killer is a giant question mark to me lmao
---
That‚Äôs a very large amount of hyperbole and over exaggeration you have there. First off, yes I‚Äôve played Nurse and quite a bit in my history of the game before setting her down.
---
 And what makes Nurse so overbearing for people is the formula for killer strength (Mobility, Lethality, Chase Potential, Perk/Addon Synergy) Nurse ranks beyond S Tier for all categories. There has to be a trade off somewhere and not taking her S scores down to D, but even to A is enough and gives people the ability to actually play against her instead of just wandering around to get slugged or jacking it in the corner to hope for hatch. Her chase potential is still fucking nuts, her lethality still circumnavigates pallets and windows and her addons actually open up silly, yet effective play styles. Oh no, she can‚Äôt Omni blink across the map with 3+ blinks anymore, the killer is dead! To say she‚Äôs gonna be unviable last rank ten severely shows not only how bandwagon you are on this overreaction train, but severely underestimates exactly how good a practiced nurse can be even with restriction.
---
block idiot
---
Are Freddy and Bubba coming to the switch version? If not why? Console limitations? Licensing issues? 
---
I noticed one of Bubba‚Äôs perks is in the shrine.
---
I mean, while I lean on the "he was a pedo" side, he undeniably was when he died. He 100% molested teenagers after his death.
---
XD WHAT  
---
Doctor is higher tier dude. Legion is bad, but def not worse than piggy. And wraith in the right hands can be solid. Most people just play wraith... so... so.. wrong. He can body block people into any kind of debris and uncloak while people are trying to get around him for easy kills. His uncloak beats out any loop with the speed boost. Wraith aint high tier, but he sure as fuck aint bottom dude.   
---
What ranks are you playing at?!?!
---
Idk what god swfs you're up against. I rarely see them.  Solo is totally broken. Team mates dont save you. Half of them are either the wrong rank or dont belong in that rank. The reason swf can be actually strong is bc it can guarentee you get 4 good survs that play like a team. With or without voice, my swf team has the same average outcome. Killers get away with plenty of wins against the solo surv circus show now anyways. And yall save all your pink sweaty killers for swf so I think you're okay.
---
Hope is a longer lasting speed boost which can help stall killers at endgame while teammates get the exits.
---
To be fair, there are alot of camping killers. Especially those wraithes going stealth mode and waiting at hooks
---
Unfortunately, a nerf to injured sounds while phasing seems the most likely, as the number one complaint about her is "I don't want to have to run Iron Will to stand a chance." Good Spirits can still track by footsteps, but it would also allow Survivors the opportunity to counterplay around it by walking/los'ing instead of running in a straight line and screaming.
---
I'm not particularly fond of the idea of Spirit nerfs, but if I'm tossing out predictions, I have no doubt sound while phasing will be the first thing to be touched.
---
Yeah guess i used the wrong term... but my point still stands. They struggle to connect people into a match together on ps4 as it is.
---
well she can be both technically she‚Äôs a victim to the plague but also misguided by the entity but who knows what the entity promised her maybe it promised her to return to her life cured if she sacrificed enough people for it
---
And console being shit has exactly what to do with Nurse ignoring all logic of the game lol
---
I had nearly 1000 hours on console before switching to PC
---
Lmao too bad you cant block yourself. You're dumb as shit.
---
 do you have bbq and chili?
---
As a console nurse main i think that this change will be good for nurse on console.  This gives me motivation to be better than i was previously because I am really add on dependent.  After the changes console nurse would still probably be one of the best choices IMO.
---
If there's a sound it's an intentional DC. If there's no sound, it's the game's problem.
---
My survivor daily replaced by killer after completing without getting any bloodpoint. It was a bug.
---
Yeah, thanks for discussing the point instead of a example, really helpful comment that made the post deeper
---
If you leave that loop he gets a hit on you? That's kinda the point of bloodlusting you know. If you leave the loop he hits you, if you stay he gains movement speed and gets a hit.
---
 Especially if you aren't within arm's reach of another loop.
---
For Licensed? Definitely Demogorgon and Myers. (Or maybe Leatherface for Barb and Chili)
---
For non licensed? Definitely Clown for Pop and Maybe Legion for Discordance? If not then probs Plague for corrupt intervention/infectious fright. Those two work like wonders. If you don‚Äôt have Hag, get her for obvious reasons.
---
No as stated I only have pig purchased, I've heard you should get meyers and leather face but I dont really want to go that route.
---
Put huntress in the incompetent category and move clown to serves human meat and I think you‚Äôre spot on!

Pedo scum lol the worst part it‚Äôs true
---
Yeah definitely. Of course, DBD will never get Jason because of the Friday the 13th video game anyway
---
Same reason I don't run borrowed time on bill, sometimes killers don't bother going for the person I save because they assume, well he's bill, he has borrowed time.
---
Steve now*
---
Because we're not your Asian friend and it's not an interesting story? What sort of reaction were you looking for?
---
That honestly sounds like a great add on and I wouldn‚Äôt mind to see it on some weaker killers like wraith or trapper.
---
thank you for not pasting survivor heads on this meme and calling it OC
---
I heard they were looking at Doctor. Can't wait for them to make his speed lock at 4.4 for 5 seconds after switching from Treatment.
---
What is
---
&gt;There is a reason why this game is 4v1, why the killer is faster and why there are mechanics like 3x hooking or healing or other stuff. Survivors are strong enough as it is, removing Bloodlust is not necessary.
---
You are supposed to play better than the survivor to down them, not get hand holded by the in-game mechanic to get a down on a better player. All bloodlust does is make the player braindead by incentivising to just hold W. 
---
Just break the pallet.
---
The custom faces
---
Lmao so salty
---
We can all dream I guess. I‚Äôve heard the concurrent player base for F13TG has dropped off significantly. Maybe that lawsuit will eventually get settled and we‚Äôll get him one day.

Yah, same thoughts

Yeah their pretty cool

You‚Äôre calling people ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù for downvoting him but aren‚Äôt you the one making an uproar over meaningless internet arrows? Okay 4chan Andy.
---
It's pretty good. Came out in 1974 and is similar to halloween
---
Im not arguing that, it just happens in game. The issue of being the same weapon or not is pretty pointless to me, but i do agree pig should insta down with ambush if the survivor is exposed
---
Well, that baby likely starved to death, so I'm not giving points there. It's more that Michael is ruthless, IMO. He will kill people for ANY reason they might impede his mission, but not for NO reason.
---
Although the comics depict him killing for fun and explicitly tormenting Loomis, so Comic Michael is probably safe to call pure evil.
---
That was it, thanks mate
---
That‚Äôs the main issue to me. Why shouldn‚Äôt her ambush instadown Exposed survivors? I can live without the secondary effects
---
Doing the smart thing to win =/= cheesing.
---
Well, plague hid her sickness when she learned her prayers weren‚Äôt working, basically then intentionally exposing the city to the sickness.
---
Maybe not ‚Äúmurder‚Äù but pretty close IMO.
---
Wha happun?
---
If one person rees, they're a scrublord. If a million people ree, Red Ranks belong to the Survivors.
---
Lara Croft as a survivor
---
I'd like for Spirit to be unable to see scratch marks during phase walk so that it's more reliant on mind-games / listening to survivors.
---
Just my opinion tho.
---
New or old?
---
I already said i agree with that, but again make a formal post on their forum instead of the same goddamn meme again
---
Yah she gonna be real shit now, I‚Äôve wasted time with her as well, :( BhVR always finds a way to fuck something up... anytime you see a nurse on console from now on will be to fuck around with and have a easy match. She easy enough now...
---
Sir Hillbert Billington, defender of the memes
---
I forsee a LOT of toxicity and a drop in Killer players, but the silver lining is that now Killers may get a general buff that improves their skill ceiling without Nurse upholding the averages at Rank 1.
---
Oh it doesn't stop there. I'm a rank 8. I had a match last night  against demogorgon. I was on a gen, one person got hooked, my teammates started to run around like chickens with their heads cut off around the hook. Keep in mind they were all rank 8-6. Needless to say the match didn't end well. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôve been playing a lot of ghost face recently, and am wondering what the best overall loadout is. Currently I‚Äôm running: whispers, thrilling tremors, bitter murmur, and noed. I‚Äôm about to switch thrilling tremors for bbq and chili once I unlock it. Any suggestions?
---
Michael doesn't give two shits. Probably not even one.
---
Yeah, I got to rank one once (as a survivor) and quit the game for about five months, got back in and was around rank 15, since then I've spread my time between killer and survivor and go from rank 15 on each after the reset to rank 10ish, a lot less nightmarish but still has its moments.
---

---
I'm Rod, and I like to party.
---
I haven‚Äôt been a part of the game for too too long, but it seems that they just do things on their own time and requesting stuff doesn‚Äôt do much unless it‚Äôs a game breaking issue like pre rework Legion. Freddy took a year to be reworked and weak and strong Killers are seemingly being ignored. Nobody asked for the Pig changes and no matter how much people complain about it they just seem to want to nerf her. Who was complaining that ambush inflicted those secondary effects?
---
the problem there is that because of the nature of the match rating system, it's unbalanced in the survivors favor as they get four votes against the killer's one.
---
which is why the killers get nerfed so often because survivors are the ones who make up the majority of the feedback.
---
DBD's battlepass.
---
You see, Nurse is top tier, yet she's not the most popular. Actually far from it. That tells something.
---
^^arf ^^arf ^^arf ^^arf *^^arf*
---
Well, Survivors outnumber Killers in a game 4:1. If I were a money-grubbing douche with no ability to plan for game longevity, I'd want the Survivors to be happy at any cost. And a lot of Survivor mains are bullies. (Some Killer mains are, too, but they're not the power role, nor are they the majority.)
---
So yeah, just make Survivors freely and infinitely able to abuse Killers and only worry about it once queues are eternal due to nobody playing Killer. Profit.
---
As a survivor main, oh god
---
They'd need to make a new animation for carrying and hooking. Chuckie is doll sized, but he still has the strength of a man. Not to mention, entity makes everyone stronger.
---
I‚Äôm interpreting it as she will appear before she actually blinks so the survivor has time to react. So you‚Äôll see where she blinks to before she actually teleports.
---
I‚Äôd like a Dead Rising chapter with Frank West as survivor and the Willamette Mall as the map. They could use one of the psychos as a killer as well, though I think it‚Äôd also be cool to see some featured as skins for current killers like the Clown as Adam the clown, the Trapper as the veteran, and the Legion as the cultists from the first game.
---
Nah, I'll take spirit and nurse over hillbilly any day. That nauseous map pressure, hitboxes, stupid auto-aim with chainsaw and backrevving is super not fun to play against.
---
I'd like to see Pinhead for a licensed killer.  Otherwise new original killers would be cool.
---
The skill ceiling on most characters gives me a neck cramp.
---
Only the SWF members would have slower speed or faster bloodlust. I don't think EVERY Killer will dodge SWFs once they're already in game. Many can spot them at spawn already.
---
No, that is not what it means. It would say that she'd show her landing location at the start of the blink if it meant that.
---
I‚Äôve only been playing a short while but is this actually a thing or just a meme
---
Next "addon" rework is doc. Im scared tbh
---
I personally love killers who sneak up and give me the spooks, the adrenaline makes the gameplay experience much more exciting
---
Restart the game? Does it persist afterwards?
---
Having teammates that are disadvantaged affects solo survivors as well
---
Yeah. Ive restarted it like 10 times
---
Which Pennywise though. New movie, or 90‚Äôs miniseries?
---
I like the ebony idea, a lot like how in deathgarden executions are significantly shortened during the endgame
---
Don‚Äôt do that. That gives them something to react to. Something to make their streams interesting. It hurts their pride a lot more if you hurt take them to the basement and they die on their first hook.
---
But they aren't disadvantaged. They're a SWF.
---
This is why I was a bit afraid of making that comment.
---
Yeah, Michael has indeed spared children before, but he is **the** personification of evil. Dr. Loomis didn't even considered Michael a person and John Carpenter described Michael as "a force of nature". Yes, Freddy is indeed a pedophile (in-game Freddy was taken from the 2010 reboot, where it is confirmed that he **IS** indeed a pedophile, something that was just insinuated but never confirmed in the other movies, iirc) and a horrible human being but I believe that saying that someone is the "personification of evil" would place them very high at a "Who is the evilest?" tier list, but this is where things start to get complicated. Michael is said to be the personification of evil but comparing his actions to Freddy, it indeed seems that Freddy is the worst of them, but this doesn't changes that Michael is, again, the personification of evil (sorry for repeating myself so much).
---
Basically... it gets complicated. A lot of stuff to take into account and it starts to get messy the more you "poke" at it. Are they evil? Yeah, for sure, but, imo, Michael is the "worst" of them. I'm not trying to say that what Freddy did isn't that "bad" compared to Michael btw, Freddy is, again, a horrible human being but between him and the LITERAL "personification of evil" (Again, sorry) I think that Michael scores higher than Freddy.
---
I'm sorry for overexting and repeating myself so much, I just wanted to seem as clear as possible, even if that made it look what I wrote redundant at some times.
---
some are like Spirit
---
And how does doing gens slower or getting caught sooner balance that"advantage" out?
---
500h phew
---
Otz has a video on it, but I'm going to say only look at Licensed killers as you can grind out originals. BBQ and Chili is basically mandatory, so Bubba's your first. If I were to buy someone, I'd get Michael between his perks and power, but Demo seems stronger and has Surge.
---
I think ita the whole difficulty tier list
---
Fuck yes! Love this, and the artist that made this!
---
Didn't know this, been wondering why 18 to 20 survivors have been showing up in my, 12 Survivor, matches. Good info.
---
I imagine most orphaned children don't hunt people for sport or kidnap and starve little girls by leashing them in a cabin
---
Anna is deranged. She might have some undiagnosed mental issues because her circumstances alone wouldn't turn most people into wanton killers
---
I would like the new movie pennywise, though a skin of the 90s miniseries would be nice for the people who like that version.
---
How does 7% faster for 2 minutes not considered making you stronger/giving you an advantage?
---
For the most part, I do like these changes.  There is only really 2 addon changes I would do, and one base stat change.
---
Torn Bookmark should just take Anxious Gasp's place.  +1 blink with such a large downside makes it a good match for a green addon, and the current Anxious Gasp setup is just really REALLY bad for a green addon.  Brown perhaps (Like most BP generator addons are/should be.  Hint, people won't use Dull Bracelet ever.), but not green.  Her replacing ultra-rare should be just a conditionless +1 blink.  Its a 7000 BP addon.  It should feel good to use, not make you worse at doing the one thing you as a killer are good at.
---
On the other note, her base move speed should increase to 100%.  You pulled a lot of power out of her ability to just use her blinks to patrol, so you should give her a bit back to her base stats to help make up for it, especially since she now will have to spend a lot more time using that base MS in all situations.
---
i'm sorry, leather faceis not a simpleton, that dude wears other peoples faces for fucking fun, that dude is hands down psychopath
---
Twitch entitlement and elitism is such a cancer to the gaming community
---
So, one playstyle is to run Nurses, wound as many as possible, and then sneak up on them as they're healing. You can tross Thanat, Sloppy Butcher, etc to synergize with that. 
---
Another is Surveillance+Surge. The surge goes off, effecting all the nearby gens with Surveillance. Use that to know when someone's on a gen, creep up and stab them in the ass. Best on indoor maps where gems are clustered tighter.
---
Another, just for Gideon, is All Hex ghostface. Similar to all hex spirit. Thrill tells you when someone's on a totem, you sneak up and yank them off.
---
Demogorgon is just living an eternal nightmare where it gets up from bed at 3 AM and tries to get bean for *sustenance* but he has to kill Survivors otherwise the Entity won't feed it.
---
A Billy‚Äôs guide to survivors: Turning corners doesn‚Äôt always work against billy if you are going against an experienced one. He can also counter many loops as well as shack if played right. Try not to hug the walls if he is around a corner. That‚Äôs all I have for today folks!
---
They're making the addon to see where you'll teleport Common.
---
Although they're also making Nurse worse.
---
My constructive criticism is: it's perfect
---
They‚Äôre both pretty sweet. I‚Äôd be cool with either.
---
Spirit at the bottom? She took a deal to kill her father because she was so angry. She is literally the embodiment of fury and wrath now.
---
Nurse and Nea, they came up together on the same chapter :(
---
He acts like your standard m1 killer for loops. If I‚Äôm honest  billy, while having high mobility, can be pretty weak against survivors that can loop good or put in a map not designed for his sprints. My best advice is to keep low and try to cut him from your line of sight. Urban Evasion helps and DH also when in chases. When he revs his saw don‚Äôt use pallets. He‚Äôll eat them and in some cases when survivors get cocky they‚Äôll get hit with it. That‚Äôs pretty much it. It honestly comes down to player skill and map (mostly the map for me).
---
Signed billy main
---
We wouldn't be having this discussion if SWF weren't at an advantage. They can do gens more consistently because voice chat will tell them when it's safe, so they should do them more slowly to even out this progress, or put the member looping the Killer for the others at greater risk.
---
This being one of the first slasher films I would love to see it
---
Yes you‚Äôre right! It completely GUTS her map pressure! A three second cooldown?! Old Freddy tier here we come!!!!
---
&gt;swf
---
You're getting downvoted but you're not wrong, Huntress's ultra rare is broken but that just means it should be nerfed, not that insta-heals are fair and balanced.
---
Comparing 4 insta-heals to ghost face pink addons is laughable, and not even in the same realm of balance.
---
It‚Äôs fun now there‚Äôs just one thing IT SYILL GIVES THE OBSESSION A MASSIVE HEALING BUFF EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TO IGNORE THME FOR THE PERK TO WORK like seriously its so stupid
---
Or you could... Ya know... Use your web browser...
---
It would be if the timer were MUCH longer. Within the 1s she has before fatigue hits, it's almost universally trash, unless you're against very cocky or oblivious players.
---
At what rank are you considered to be actually good at the game?
---
Especially when BP addons aren't post-game, so they just make you hit the 8k cap faster.
---
Get rid of the action speed buff for the obsession like seriously the perk makes you ignore the obsession BUT THE OBSESSION IS BUFFED
---
It's okay on its own, helps with mirror myers and ghostface for the grabs, but has the downsides of requiring you to take the 2 seconds to damage the generator and you won't get any audio cues of it triggering so you could completely miss it going yellow.
---
Surge and Surveillance have a good synergy though, and makes 2 perks that are alright on their own pretty good together
---
Have you ever considered?
---
People who main survivor:  ‚Äúnurse is broken, and I‚Äôm excited for the add-on changes to remove bullshit like omega blink and 5 blink‚Äù   
---
People who main Killer: "What the hell guys you killed nurse, why did you do that, there was nothing wrong with her before"
---
Mmmm... award winning chili 10/10
---
Imagine running into that in Macmillan's map. :O
---
For killers:
---
Pinhead or SCP-106 (Pulls you into the lament configuration/pocket dimension. I really, REALLY miss Old Freddy and I'd love another killer who has to pull you to a different dimension. 106 might just activate a bleedout meter when you're in the dimension and instead of hooking you 3 times, he has to keep pulling you in until you finally succumb and die.)
---
Jack Torrance (No idea for ability)
---
Dracula (He's public domain IIRC. Transforms into a vampire bat?)
---
Some kind of werewolf (Give those moonlight offerings a use again!)
---
Negan from Walking Dead. (Whistles. Ability I have no idea. Mori involves beating the survivors head to mush with Lucille.)
---
The Tyrant/Mr. X from Resident Evil. Nemesis would be great but too fast and "deadly" for DBD given his access to weapons. Loud footsteps as part of his terror radius similar to Huntress Humming. head-crush as his Mori.
---
I agree with you, but also bloodlust takes a long ass time to build up, and if a chase lasts long enough to let the killer get 1 bloodlust hit after 30-40 seconds without being forced into breaking a pallet or getting stunned the killer has basically already lost the game.
---
And how would you make trapper/wraith ‚Äúnurse tier‚Äù ?
---
Because Killers are the Power Role /s
---
We are judging them because we cannot even theory craft with such obvious drawbacks.
---
He has the Blessing of Otz.
---
I thought that being able to invite a friend while playing as The Legion would be cool, but you‚Äôd lose Feral frenzy, run at 105% speed and require 3 hits to down. Itd also be cool if each one got two perks with no duplicates between them.
---
Myers is a level of evil above everything, it's his entire schtick
---
Legion is bad, and Mathieu himself said that if you're having a hard time with Killer, just stop playing DbD for a week.
---
Your description of Wraith is word for word how I often describe Pig, and I'd add that Pig's dash attack is much more useful at smaller loops than Wraith's speed burst.
---
Damn now I want to join the legion on the thought of free mac n cheese
---
What the fuck???
---
Top tear should be DS survivors
---
I want Carl the cashier as a survivor 
---
And The Hollow Man
---
Jesus man that glare
---
You shouldn't have needed to log in. I got it while I had abandoned the game.
---
I keep seeing feng min with a purple level up shirt with a controller on it and the back says game over. Where do people get this from?!
---
Even Michael who is implied to be evil incarnate still isn't as evil as a pedophile with a stupid sweater
---
NO Clown I Wanted CHICKEN FINGERS not HUMAN FINGERS.
---
All those skills and techniques you gained while ranking up, just throw them out the window. They dont expect such simple plays at high ranks
---
Maybe uninstall and reinstall
---
I mean lets not jump the gun we have no idea what it means to not be able to blink to line of sight, windows, pallets, over generators/cars ect. There's a ton of objects you can clearly see over that we aren't exactly sure how the interaction will work.
---
That Legion could of joined in. But he shipped Ace and Nea so much lol.
---
I have, but I didn‚Äôt think anyone really thought nurse was balanced
---
Those would all be pretty sweet.
---
One word. Mori. Its a good feeling when you mori teabagging survivors
---
Wow today I just got a project on a comic book cover coincidence? I think not
---
That‚Äôs not true at all.
---
Devs mostly take feedback from the forums, the match rating system literally does nothing.
---
Pure evil methodically ending lives to the best of his ability? Why is he using a kitchen knife instead of a gun?
---
Spirit is based off Japanese horror films like the Grudge and the Ring. In such films the killer ghost girl is an innocent who was wronged and killed, as such they lash out at living as a twisted version of their former self
---
Plague killed scores of people through her actions as High Priestess. Hiding her illness with elaborate outfits, oils, perfumes, and incense made her church an epicenter for disease under the belief of health through prayer
---
When she realized her grievous mistake, she exiled herself in shame, still killing more as a cabal of devout followers came with her
---
She serves the Entity as she prayed to anything that would listen to give her and her followers respite in any way possible. Functional imortality in the fog was that respite, so she now serves it as repayment for answering her prayer
---
Just did that. Hoping it works cause its like a 4 hour re-installation
---
Myers should be above Freddy because he is the embodiment of evil.
---
Though nurse did need a small tweak, I would have preferred if all the other killers were made more viable, brought up closer to her lever. Only a handful right now can go against optimal survivors
---
Why not just add something to wglf to be on par with bbq instead of bringing bbq to wglf tier?
---
What if Clown could set bottles on interactables so that Survivors would trigger their effects by using them?
---
Although a few Killers now could trade in their heavy disadvantage addons for a pre-game "Style Select." Sniper or Ring Doc trades enough to be fair as always an option, some of Nurse's new addons might as well be playstyle toggles, and every "Power is worse; build BP faster" should be, so bottles would be another good addition to this.
---
I agree
---
Leatherface‚Äôs screaming is more like him being excited and not being able to express it since he can‚Äôt speak any known language.
---
I like this, high risk rewards are great
---
I figured it was more like pain or fear
---
Merge it with No One Left Behind.
---
Carl the Cashier should have come with the ghostface chapter, and we should never forgive his absence.
---
Hollow man could be cool.
---
Damn... shitty internet gang
---
You check out my post?
---
Killer: Wesker and Claire, Chris as duo survivors or James sunderland and pyramid head
---
Yeah how hard is it to just say ‚Äúyou fucking baby tutorial killer GG 2 EZ 4 me HAHAHAHAHAH‚Äù
---
\*pedo scum\*
---
Hell yeah
---
Hey, it‚Äôs my shitty picture. Good use
---
Right, so now that the nurse can't blink immediately after her fatigue period that means she can simply be outrun since being slower than survivors for 6 seconds means they have 6 seconds to make distance which is more than enough to get the distance of two blinks. Prepare to be looped for eternity.
---
Pig is the Blackbeard of the dbd community
---
Maybe if they can still attempt to break free, but each attempt takes longer.
---
Yeah. I especially like the P3 idea. That would look sweet.
---
Fear, maybe, mixed with excitement.
---
I feel like the consensus has rang in that NOED is a crutch perk and most killers rarely run it anymore. I got frustrated by a string of toxic swf games and ran it, but it ended up being against a team of randos that didn't work well together and I felt bad downing the sole remaining guy before he found hatch and let him have it.
---
That actually is a really good idea. Well done.
---
&gt;**MOST OF THE ADDONS GAVE HER A WEAKNESS WHICH WE FELT WASN'T UP TO OUR STANDARD**
---
I foresee Spirits
---
Please stop DCing immediately upon being downed for the first time.
---
Spirit got revenge after she died but I guess at that point you‚Äôre allowed so
---
Isn't the counter to insta heals to just run Franklin's?
---
I used to animate a while ago and decided to try and get back into it, thank you :)
---
Real talk tho: Isn't the whole point of being "punk" to rebel?
---
Rank doesn't determine if you're good, skill does, I've seen high ranking players be absolutely incompetent.
---
They pass it on each other depending who needs it to talk lol
---
Fuck having Carrie in the game, I want a playable car as a killer.
---
But then I‚Äôd have to close the game üôÄ
---
I‚Äôm getting some bleach vibe. The anime not the drink.
---
Oh, that's like...fatal. Gross.
---
Whenever i play nancy i litterally SPAWN next to them lmao
---
Anyone who was actually great with her base kit will hardly be affected. It's the baddies that are going to suffer and they know it which is why they're crying about it
---
Pumpkinhead and Ed Harley would be pretty sweet!!!
---
Dude... Pumpkinhead. I just rewatched that one yesterday after having not seen it for years. That‚Äôs a great idea. Instead of a heartbeat they could have the cicada sounds like Fredwards lullaby.
---
I feel like everyone is overreacting. We still have to wait until tomorrow to actually see if Nurse got majorly destroyed by the changes or not.
---
 The changes aren‚Äôt always necessarily as bad as they seem when you play the actual game instead of coming up with scenarios in your head. Plus, good Nurse players will likely still dominate, they just have to wait a bit more before downing everyone. As far as I can guess, these changes will simply make her skill cap higher and make her addons more viable.
---
The add ons are going to help her out. You can still use the old her if you use addons
---
Props to him for being a good killer and super chill. Nurse is really hard to master
---
I agree Freddy's addons are very crap. He has a few good ones (Fake Pallets, paint brush, ropes,) and the rest are just complete garbage or 3 addons that do the same thing. 
---
Old Freddy had better addon variety. Less Skillcheck dresses, blocks reducing dream transition. Freddy's slow even without addons was massive, and with them was crazy. Red Paint Brush + Monitor and Abuse gave you 0 Terror Radius. Class photo was amazing for harassing everyone. Pill Bottle was excellent for surprise gen grabs. The drawings were good for long range sleeps and often were better than blocks. (Why have a shorter dream transition when you can just initiate the transition from further away?) 
---
Changes I'd make to new Freddy would be making the dresses increase the failed skillcheck penalty even more. Brown would stay slightly, while the yellow and green moderately and considerably. Blocks should speed up the passive sleep cycle. (Maybe 5, 10, 15, 20 seconds off) 
---
Pill Bottle should reduce Freddy's lullaby radius. 
---
Class Photo could also give an extra effect of making survivors auras visible when they step on a dream snare.
---
The DBD community is way too toxic against everyone. We just don't have another game to move to until that Resident Evil spinoff comes out.
---
I honestly have a hard time believing you even knew how to install a game.

I honestly don't even know how I got to rank 1 with 200 hours. I get mindgamed so easily, and I only ever escape if I get a god-like team. Safety tips are too easy imo.
---
I hope so mate, I'm really nervous about the base kit change as I just started learning ps4 nurse this week, and I'm scared she's not gonna be great anymore. I really don't wanna stop using her and going to someone like billy or spirit, reason I picked her up in the first place is almost no one uses her on console and she's a toughie to learn. 
---
Idk just voicing my worry is all not much substance to my comment lol

It really do be like that sometimes

Yeah, they fucking do actually fuckhead. The majority of players aren't in Red ranks, and there's no "competitive" scene for DBD so fuck out of hear with that absolute nonsense
---
Dont give them any ideas...
---
There's really no right answer for this. Generally, if you are getting to red or purple ranks each season, then you are probably doing something right.
---
Nurse OP nerf Katarina
---
It's not that randoms aren't awful. That's a sympathetic problem, and probably WHY many Killer mains play Killer. It's that SWF are voice chatting, which gives them an advantage the game was not designed or patched to accomodate.
---
You get downvoted for saying it, and its effect isn't as massive as most types, but voice chatting technically is cheating. That's not really an issue until the SWFs are excessively toxic about their advantage, though.
---
No
---
I am not sure if you are bugged or this totem location can randomly spawn bugged. This location is 100% "cleanseable". Definitely a mystery.
---
&gt;Rank doesn't determine if you're good, skill does, I've seen high ranking players be absolutely incompetent.
---
What this guy said, I am an example, rank 5 who is only a week into this game. Still utterly garbage at most things, points are fairly simple to get when you focus unhooking and gens.
---
I know what you mean about original content. I think it‚Äôs probably easier to make licensed content. I say that with absolutely zero industry experience, but it seems like coming up with the idea is one of the biggest parts of the battle.  I‚Äôm sure licensed killers also probably lead to a surge of new players that are fans of that specific franchise.
---
Still, while some of them aren‚Äôt fun to play as/against, I‚Äôd say all of DBDs original killers are at least unanimously cool from a story/content standpoint.
---
You mispelt "nerfed off the face of the planet."
---
Yes, most of the community can agree that unless you're playing some of the "top killers" (Nurse and Spirit) that the game is pretty survivor-sided. There is also the fact that some killers are not balanced to be up-to-par with some of cast such as Leatherface, Trapper and Legion, imo of course.
---
If Behavior is content with some games having the effects of strong add on, why wouldn‚Äôt they be all the time?
---
You guys already got red-wedding'd. Not that it couldn't happen a second time with these gutless devs. "But wait.. there's more." Should be their slogan.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôd be sweet.
---
ok thanks
---
*Laughs in Spirit Main*
---
This is is the saddest thing, as a survivor main I actually LOVED playing against nurses. I thought they were challenging and predictable... I'm looking forward to the PTB because it may be the last few times I play against a Nurse for a looong time
---
Dr loomis isn‚Äôt omniscient though. That was his interpretation from working with Micheal as a psychiatrist.
---
A xenomorph would be sweet. Now that the DG is here, I don‚Äôt see why a xenomorph wouldn‚Äôt be allowed. They opened the floodgates on their ‚Äúonly humanoid killers‚Äù rule.
---
Thank God, I've been extremely drawn to the wraith and people constantly escape, pallets aren't really a problem (I'm not entirely stupid) and unusually have at least one escape.
---
If you do not hold the button to ambush all the way, she will be able to give out the grunt or squeal that she is using it. But if you hold the button to ambush, she will ambush. This can only happen if you are crouching.
---
I wouldnt put the nurse so low. Sure, she was the victim of shitty circumstance, but she went on an absolute murder spree of people who weren't responsible. It wasnt self defense like it was in the case of the Hag, or retribution like in the case of Hillbilly or Wraith, but just straight up snap insanity.
---
Honestly, I don't mind the changes... I just want more killers to be stronger (just not nurse-level strong). It really sucks when I'm forced to run the same set of perks just so I can have a good time.
---
The game is "balanced" on the idea that on average, 2 people should get killed in a match.
---
True, that could be a cool tie-in
---
Guess people I wont have to play 1v2 now
---
Don't DC, it's inconsiderate to your teammates. As Killer, it's a nuclear option, but even if you encounter a team so disgusting that spiting them is more important than anything else, you may want to consider playing it through for the BP and shards over being penalized.
---
When you hold the button, her power charges, which you can see represented in a bar that fills the longer you hold the button. Continue to hold the button, and she will being her dash, at which point hold the button down the entire duration of her dash, but also steer her forward or whatever direction you are aiming
---
Fuck yeah. The car drives slowly most of the movie anyway. It‚Äôs perfect.
---
It'll be the first killer capable of blinding survivors back.
---
No yeah props to him. I want to be a nurse main but being on Xbox is not a fun time. I adore nurse mains even if I get ass raped I still have fun with them.
---
100% true. See how they like it for a change.
---
I prayed that they would only touch her addons and not mess with her base kit. There was nothing even wrong with it.  All the veterans could successfully play nurse without addons, and that is what separated the good players from the bad ones. I‚Äôm not sure why she even needed a recharge mechanic when the fatigue was the recharge mechanic. So someone correct me if im wrong, she is gonna fatigue and I have to wait for a blink recharge as well? If so, then thats bullshit. 
---
When i first started this game, I was constantly bullied by toxic survivors by playing any other killer. Nurse was literally the only killer that I could turn too. I dont find enjoyment playing any other killer. I think this will cause some nurse mains to stop playing or uninstall perhaps.
---
That would be cool. The skins would also be sweet.
---
The Hag's trap set up speed was buffed to take 3 seconds less... and that one change instantly made her viable.
---
The Nurse gets a 3 second nerf to her power and you so boldly are "lolz, it's not going to matter much". 
---
Let me clue you survivor mains in on something - every fucking second matters for a killer's viability. Survivors aren't lit on fire and we can't cleanse you in 15 seconds. The Nurse actually requires skill to play, unlike cleansing totems.
---
I guess he could drag instead of carry.
---
Freddy is the worst because he is always trying to camp or take people to the hatch and then try to close it on them (If freddy does this to you, the proper move is to crawl away like you are stupid and he will just keep trying to take you back, troll the troll).
---
Wait what's happening with nurse?
---
What happened?
---
You're completely right, but there are still barriers there. Some people aren't comfortable with or don't like voice chatting with strangers, and some people aren't able to. Pings would be nice, but if you've played LoL, you know how those get spammed, too.
---
I think I'd sooner vote for SWF-specific nerfs or Killer enhancements like getting bloodlust sooner when chasing a member than adding Survivor communication for randoms if only because I can forsee Surv on Surv toxicity going up with comms.
---
Right, but when I hold the button, she inches forward a little bit and then stabs.
---
That would be really awesome
---
What nerfs is she gonna get?
---
He usually just grabs whatever is around that you could kill someone with, but a stabbing is intimate, drawn out and usually leads to more suffering than some gunshots would inflict. Also quiet to maximize his effectiveness and prolong his killing sprees.
---
Lmaooo me im sneaking around relying on spine chill I hate him so much
---
I‚Äôm in no way defending or disparaging the ‚Äúnerf yourself addons‚Äù, but it kind of tracks: Wraith has one that doesn‚Äôt suppress his TR, Trapper has one that doesn‚Äôt injure survivors when they step in traps, Billy/LF have one that doesn‚Äôt insta-down survivors with their chainsaws‚Äîall of these grant additional BP. Personally, I don‚Äôt bother with the gimicky addons like that, but that‚Äôs mostly cuz I just don‚Äôt play enough anymore to warrant needing that kind of a shakeup in my games.
---
They are in the game
---
Well they recently added newer places for hexes with the last two patches. Ive been finding them in the ass cracks of the maps now
---
the thing is not everyone wants to run a situational perk to counter the off chance they bring them, and they can just pick it back up after.
---
Can i get a link to said forum? Thanks
---
100% this. I have always loved Pumpkinhead.
---
So you have to use add ons to play as her. Pretty sure making a killer reliant on bp and add ons is a Nerf.
---
‚ÄúSo now we find the tables are turned. It is I who will become the best killer after Nurse dies, and you are my first sacrifice. Now you are nerfed into oblivion, helpless and alone.‚Äù
---
It's a hard altruism punish that baits novice players into playing with a null perk slot and then gives them a crutch if they allow Survivors to complete gens.
---
The annoyance of Nurse gone. Most people that used more than 2 blinks were shit or being dicks
---
You might like trapper. I find it very rewarding when survivors run right into a well-placed trap. Coming up with sneaky trap spots can be pretty fun.
---
As a killer main, I've seen some absolutely terrible plays, people think just because I'm a low level doesn't mean I know how to get out of a pallet loop. I main wraith so I usually body lock someone while uncloaking and hit them, then they try to pallet me but I just go "fuck it" and lunge at them. I usually hit them and they go down, break pallet, hook them, repeat.
---
nevermind just read patch notes
---
Why does bhvr have to ruin all the good things in this game
---
How the fuck can you handle that glare
---
I really hoped I wasn't. Itt's a fucking disgrace.
---
Why does everyone always automatically assume that‚Äôs all we‚Äôre talking about?
---
For real. Otzdarva always says dead heart and no0b always says deaddard, when I finally got the game I was confused looking for it
---
also there's a good chance the shape does not know how guns work since he's been in an institution his whole life unresponsive
---
Ive been saying all the same stuff pig needs a buff.
---
Lee &lt;3
---
I think the main reason people are upset is that Nurse with no addons was actually pretty balanced at the top level of play, with her addons being the issue. Nerfing her base power, even if it's only 3 seconds, is huge for the Nurse player. Why do you think so many killer animations have been sped up? Time means everything in this game.
---
Also, only a couple of her addons look good now, but a Killer shouldn't have to use addons all the time to be good, which unfortunately is no longer the case for Nurse. This will definitely bring her down a few notches, definitely not the best killer anymore. Maybe top 6 in the right hands.
---
I just want to get Spirit for Rancor so I can do my mori dailies...
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/
---
I didn't expect her addons to be better. They claimed the purpose of the changes was to reduce (remove) the power of Omega blink/3 blink. They claimed the only base kit changes she would receive are slight number changes. An entire new mechanic to further cripple a power with several huge drawbacks already isn't a number change. The addition of the cooldown period in this update is purposefully misleading at best and an outright lie at worst.
---
Only works rank 20-16 everywhere else is swf
---
She got reworked. Some say she got nerfed, some say she got buffed. 
---
I personally think she got nerfed, but she‚Äôs still pretty strong. I think now Spirit is the strongest killer followed by Nurse. 
---
Without a doubt, however, Prayer Beads Spirit is the strongest build on the game; since Omega Blink Nurse no longer exists
---
Timmy Turner, my name is *incoherent screeching*
---
I haven't really kept up with the whole Nurse nerf thing, have they said what changes are going to be made?
---
Best streamer ever
---
I know. At lest her addons are good. I‚Äôll have to play her to see how she feels.
---
has there been talk about buffing ashes perks form the devs? people may recognize me cause ive brought up the topic before. the only reason i care so much is i dont play a tons of survivor so i don't have teachables. i like Ash but playing him means using his perks. id imagine this is also an issue for new players who by Ash right out the gate.
---
She‚Äôs also the slowest character in the game.
---
Yeah, I don't have much hope of DbD getting better, really. The team seems to just hate...fun, even when it's already happening through bugs, just about.
---
It's too bad. I'd probably recommend this game to a friend if we could co-op Killers.
---
Honestly the changes seem so minor
---
Yeah, killers who are able to end chases quickly such as Nurse's blinking to their victims, or Spirits simply being able to bump into a survivor and down them are why they are great killers to play if you want to kill survivors more often. 
---
Wraith doesn't really have the tools like them to push to end chases quickly and tbh depends on survivors making mistakes to really capitalize on killing them.
---
But don't get me wrong, I'm a Trapper main myself! Us low tiers will get our glory in some of those games!
---
?
---
Depends on if the Killers are co-op or Vs.
---
If theyre going to nerf the nurses blink i think they should up her movement speed as a balance
---
I would suggest getting leather face as bbq and chilli makes getting BP so much easier.  That being said pure fun factor for me my top 3 are ghostface, legion and huntress.
---
\*slap\* RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I think she might be even worse to play against now?
---
she's gonna be unpredictable as hell
---
My best advice is to turn your camera around and pay attention to how he moves and how his red light moves (as with any killer). Always be mindful of Billy's ability to quickly turn corners with his chainsaw. Don't be afraid of dropping pallets against a good Billy or they will completely destroy you with their ability to curve around corners. A good Billy player will know that good survivors don't drop pallets when Billys/Bubbas start revving their chainsaw at a pallet. They often take advantage of this by "fake revving" the chainsaw at the pallet so that you don't drop the pallet, but quickly recover from "fake revving" and instadown you before you can do another loop.
---
Now I want the Trapper to be able to throw bear traps at survivors faces with a chain.
---
The whole point of Legion should have been that they're multiple weak Killers.
---
But it's still a 1:4 ratio.
---
Spirit should‚Äôve been tweaked instead of Nurse. Nurse basekit is fine, her add ons are not. Spirit basekit is not fine, and her addons sure as shit aren‚Äôt
---
Could always disallow stacking outside of Legion and Ghostface.
---
wow I can relate to this, when Im the last person standing and swf in discord be like "LOOK FOR THE HATCH" "THE KILLER IS RIGHT BEHIND YOU" I wanted to say "Shut up I'm trying my best TO LISTEN FOR THE WIND WITH ALL OF YOU SCREAMING INTO MY HEADSET"
---
In pretty sure the first season demogorgon wasn‚Äôt controlled by the mindflayer and they never showed anything that could hint at the new one being controlled, but it might be, we just don‚Äôt know atm
---
I'll never forget the day I first played Myers at rank 10. I knew it was gunna be bad but oof like birthing pains lol
---
So you want people to be tunneled man people always complain about tunneling but you want it to happen, that‚Äôs messed up and usually it‚Äôs only immersive rank 20‚Äôs who‚Äôll want to survive and be a douchebag than keep there teammates alive tbh
---
Don't see why Wraith would try to poison you? His story had nothing to do with choosing to murder.
---
Except the hag spending 3 seconds setting a trap doesn't result in them immediately  getting an unavoidable hit, it denies the loop youre on (if the hag didnt place it in a stupid spot.) Also The 3 seconds that it takes to fatigue will give you 1 blink charge so if youre close enough and good enough at aiming you can get a hit anyways. Except that it will actually take skill since you can't go "lol I hit you because my first blink landed within 5 meters and my second blink will put me on top of you no matter what you do"
---
Heck if I know. I've always hated that addons are single-use in the first place, instead of something you can level up and maintain by sacrificing lower level units, like Fallout equipment.
---
Good point. All around that area it starts to get case-by-case for me, so I clumped them probably not where they should be exactly. Yeah, she went nuts.
---
Unless you just like the fashion but then you're just a poser
---
didn't you see the nurse changes to her base kit?
---
Tad bit of screaming involved. Lots of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fucking gooooooooo‚Äù
---
Ya know, the usual
---
Yes but it's ridiculously inefficient to sit on 1 generator with multiple survivors. It's much better to split around the map and work on separate generators.
---
Nurse, spirit,............................................leatherface
---
If you are Freddy then yes!
---
After the bar for ambush is completed, you can use your movement keys/stick to move around!
---
His was the only one I forgot exactly his mental state, so he‚Äôs probably more evil than I gave him.
---
Plague would fix you very spicy chicken Tikka Masala, but the chicken contains salmonella, so you don't know if you're puking from the heat, or puking from the bacteria.
---
So nurse is even more useless on console ok got it
---
The worst is definitely between pig and leatherface
---
karma
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm going to rarely see nurses now
---
Clown would cough all over it.
---
With the pig, you can crouch and mind game a bit more though
---
Seems like a cool thing to do.
---
It doesn't matter what the fucking actor thought in his mind, only what the writer and director did.
---
I always saw Susie as someone who would try and bake a decent batch of cookies, but then stick a bag of chips in the microwave the next day.  Also said cookies would probably have way too much sugar and she probably accidentally used a bunch of salt. But at least she tries.
---
He was rich, so he probably never learned to cook for himself.
---
You sir, are not very FUCKING NICE.
---
Because you like the color/how it looks?
---
Except for that part where he killed a guy and made an axe out of his spine for additional homicides.
---
Eh, nurse was too extreme. You either couldn't hit shit, or killed everything damn near instantly. There was no middle ground.
---
Nurse is worst now lol
---
True
---
I rarely saw them on ps4 now itll be never. Maybe once a month
---
Nurse is pretty much getting deleted.
---
 [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/)
---
I'm sorry, but a survivor main saying that playing a killer isn't skillful is like a stripper calling a prostitute a slut.
---
Getting good at using a Nurse's blinks is more skillful than anything a survivor could ever do in this game.
---
sounds interesting
---
is it any good? im not usually into romantic comedy movies but according to wikipedia critics liked it
---
I think hillbilly is the product of his circumstance so either literally victim or shitty circumstances tier
---
After the Nurse rework the best is up in the air, imo, but there are a few obvious picks for worst: Bubba, Legion, and Wraith. I say that because their powers are all pretty bad for the chase, Bubba is especially sad due to how he has to be careful scraping edges if he wants to avoid an incredibly long fatigue time for missing. Legion's power makes it easy to get that first hit and find other survivors, but good survivors will know to scatter early and his power doesn't help end chases really. Then there's Wraith with a similar positive where getting the jump on survivors makes it possible to get a free hit, but that's all he has aside from moving around the map without beeing seen.
---
Speaking of Wraith, is he still affected by spine chill, object of obsession, and the like?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Spirit murdered her dad. She made a deal with the entity, came back as The Spirit, murdered her dad, went to the realm of the entity. Back before Spirit came out there was a teaser of her murdering who we can assume is her dad.
---

I envy you, playing against Demogorgons.

I haven't faced one in weeks.
---
Why masked megs those guys are usually tryhards the normal megs have no idea what there, doing masked megs or p3 rank 1 megs know what there doing (or there a rank 20 who bought an account to look cool) but you should trust one of those 2
---
Sir I regret to inform you I am the Demogorgon
---
TIL anyone not running a particular perk is a douchebag. I don't rescue with the killer near the hook and if they're going to camp I just do generators. I only play solo so you bet staying alive is my priority.
---
nah, nurse's problem is much more than her addons, I'll never understand why that's such a common meme, considering how it's so easy to 4k quickly with no addons at all on her.
---
Spirit's base kit been broken since they made her phasing sound non-directional, which they've since done every killer's ability sound/lullaby since.  She has addon issues a well.  Not a good or smart trend that she started.
---
Get used to it!
---
Cause he was insane, and no, not "additional homicides" cause he was never seen again after that. Wraith was a victim of circimstance, he wouldn't intentionally try to murder someone. Hell, its been confirmed that Wraith, and some others, are forced by the entity to kill survivors.
---
DISCORDINENECE
---
It's like weapons in titanfall, why pick a good one and play on easy mode when I could pick a BAD one and actually get good at the game?
---
Wow, this is awesome! Trapper looks so cool in the retro comics style!
---
There's a lack of jane in pain
---
Ya but... her father kinda chopped her and her mother into little fun sized bits...
---
This is where you just leave lobby
---
They totally are. The only nurse players getting fucked are those who have to blink 9 times before ever landing a hit, and those who used addons to make up for a lack of actual skill.
---
The main legion is not misguided
---
Doesn‚Äôt change what she is
---
A victim?
---
yea but that's nearly everyone with an item and a perk
---
A spirit brought to life through anger and wrath
---
In any case, at least he's got an IRON GRIP on the situation.
---
yep, i hooked up the bongo drums and went to town on some survivors
---
Nurse main here. 
---
Many people will hate and call you mad because ‚ÄúNuRsE bAsE kIt wAs ToO oP‚Äù but I think we nurse mains are just passionate about our killer. 
---
I remember when Pig was getting her End Game Collapse nerf, someone posted a meme along lines of...‚Äùwhen freddy got nerfed, I said nothing because i wasnt a freddy main...when legion got nerfed i said nothing because I wasnt a legion main...but when pig got nerfed, there was no one left to speak for me‚Äù 
---
And it hurts to say...but I think we have suffered the same fate.
---
So, like Identity V's Duo Hunters mode?
---
Haha na truth is I only use reddit while watching tv or scrolling in down times, I have never actually logged into the reddit website on computer üòÇ
---
I probably should of but I didn't see the message until the game was loading
---
Because she was attacked by her OWN DAD WHO KILLED HER MOM. I think that‚Äôs what makes her a victim.
---
Depends what the aoe is on that, if you can blink through a jungle gym and reveal all the immersed claudette in it it could be cool
---
Last will is nice on certain builds
---
Freddy dicing carrots with INHUMAN EFFICIENCY
---
Use all of them now

Paul rudd is a National treasure

He kills Kevin in h18/40 plus kills and eats dogs...

That is so awesome!

Just say fucking..
---
To be fair to 2018, the kid in question makes a very adult decision by threatening Michael with lethal force in self defense. So it‚Äôs not like he was a truly innocent child.
---
I don't want to jeopardize my fun so people I don't even know can get out.
---
Ghostface is easily my favorite killer, got him to Prestige 3 the same week he was released
---
Please tell me what's more efficient:
---
Sitting around bunched up with your teammates to do one gen in 30 seconds, being together with your teammates so it's easy for the killer to disrupt multiple targets at once.
---
Splitting around the map on separate generators and finishing 3 generators in 80 seconds. If the killer finds one of you the other 3 are not affected and can do gens in peace.
---
Pretty sure most people are either glad to hear of or, at the very least, not surprised by the nerfs. Not sure what the point of this post is.
---
This is some quality shit....
---
Like obviously this was inspired by the 60s batman comics which displayed this same posturing between the villain and batman.
---
But ya really well done, I'd love to see more trapper ones since because his traps are the most graphic power the in game not that its showed but if you look up bear trap wounds you'll see some shit, you can do ALOT with  it.
---
But amazing work forealslz
---
I'm just glad I wasn't insane, so often I get downed by a nurse who seems to still be mid blink and I didn't know if it was lag or not, turns out it was just broken as fuck add ons
---
I guess so. It just sucks to not be rewarded for your efforts. You barely even get any bloodpoints if you get chased all game cuz you max out boldness and get nothing out.
---
That‚Äôs crazy I‚Äôm going to go for the same thing dude
---
i wonder where it went, probably the entity kept it in the jar
---
I can see them changing her to have actual counterplay, which if done right can keep her strong.  The face base nurse exists and has counterplay is testament to that.
---
No, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù Nurse mains who dump on SwFs have taken many many hours to git gud. Not any random scrub is gonna 4k with basekit Nurse
---
And yes, Spirit is the actual problem. Besides touching Nurse addons, she should‚Äôve stayed the same. Spirit is not balanced even with basekit. Soundwhore with Stridor, and use BBQ, NOED, Ruin for an easy 4k if you even have a fragment of a brain
---
The thing is, Myers doesn't spare children or baby's. And I'm pretty sure he could kill a baby but it didn't interest him. Michael actually ignores people very frequently, such as when he's focused on one victim and others flee, or when he's in public. He's sane, in the sense that he's aware of his actions and reality, just utterly evil.
---
Did he mori you?
---
You have to look at the bottom corner? Did kindergarten not teach you how to count to 3?
---
Spirit has counter play. If survivors would play against her and not immediately give up and dc more people would know how to play against her.
---
I play killer too. And of course nobody likes toxic survivors, but I wasn't being toxic. And as killer, I don't tunnel people who are just trying to survive.
---
Reports go into a black hole of nothing. They admitted they don‚Äôt monitor it and they removed the ability to report via forums. There is zero rule enforcement. Besides you didn‚Äôt break any rules.
---
Yes
---
They blocked the 99% completion gate.
---
Sorry to hear that. Since I'm a potato survivor my loops are of just a few seconds. from my killer perspective I just ignore good loopers but those tbag scumbas I would camp them with enjoyment idc about the others
---
Franklin's isn't situational though. It counters all items. Insta-heals, keys, boxes, etc. If the survivors have items its always helpful to bring Franklin's. And if you know they have items (which you can clearly see before the game starts) and still refuse to bring Franklin's then you are accepting they might have insta-heals and have to deal with that. Even if they can pick it back up, any time spent going back for an item is time not on gens or healing.
---
Legion Mains: "First time?"
---
Now that would be a cool feature, being able to increase the bloodpoint cap for a category! Or alternatively they could increase the base cap for each category.
---
From Spirit‚Äôs lore: A dark Fog slowly veiled her eyes, but it could not subdue her rage. She would not rest--not yet. The darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.
---
An oath was made and Rin closed her eyes.
---
There‚Äôs still the other gate. Btw read the rest of my post if you haven‚Äôt, I made some edits.
---
You‚Äôre missing something
---
But in leatherface, the prequel you can see how he was raised. But after that he became stable while he was in the institution but after the betrayal at the end he just breaks.
---
I mean, a whole 6 seconds of survivors running away from you before you have a chance to catch up to them again, with 2.5 of that being extra slow fatigue time, and 3.5 where you're still slower than survivors, even more if you hit them. That shit adds up man. Nurse is getting gutted, just like Legion.
---
Lol look at the delusional kid that thinks everyone who disagrees with him is an entitled survivor
---
Sorry reddit user dickmcswaggin, you‚Äôre just going to have to get good :)
---
What about Wraith after being stunned?
---
Happy cake day!
---
How often to they balance for the higher ranked players?
---
I have succesfully made a meme that is so bad that a lot of people downvote it, and so bad that a lot of people upvote it. My mission has been accomplished.
---
I agree with this meme but Davids who use Sprint Burst are disgusting
---
why is this true
---
&gt; No, it‚Äôs not ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù Nurse mains who dump on SwFs have taken many many hours to git gud. Not any random scrub is gonna 4k with basekit Nurse
---
you shouldn't be near-guaranteed a 4k with any killer *regardless* of hours spent mastering them.
---
You do realize this subreddit is made up of more than one person with more than one opinion, right?
---
Couldn't find a list with Demo and GF and couldn't be bothered to search through them all
---
Its because Myers is evil personified. His raw evil is sometimes too much, and allows him to mori with Add-ons instead of just the mori offerings.
---
I had some guy named TheTallGrass do this to me. Afterward he started using racial slurs and asked me if I knew Ben Shapiro. Needless to say I got him banned.
---
^^
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Eh. Not often
---
Don't give them ideas, lol
---
Ghost Face's pink add-ons are worse than just running two cooldown recovery add ons. And when you're talking about 4 red rank survivors bringing instas you'll have a rough time winning with Pink addon Clown, Myers, Demogorgon, and even Freddy's pinks aren't game breaking.
---
you don't have to be gods. when I swf even with one person, at least two people escape. that communication is literally godly, especially since time is what the killer is really fighting.
---
If you are in a locker right as the other person is hooked, you should be fine.
---
And hot pockets
---
This sub has a hate boner for pug because he's "toxic"
---
The only bad thing about it is the totem spots wth man
---
I think you mean pot and not salt
---
Obviously Huntress. She can reload on her own. Plague can only hope the survivors donate her some ammo.
---
Bro, you're irrelevant so there was no need to respond. Don't devolve this into pettiness. I called out your repost which is the exact same image as last week. Glad you thought it was funny and got some karma. Get over it.
---
It took me like 5 times of watching this gif to realize that star is on the door and not in his hair... not my proudest moment.
---
I had a tier for people that were mentally handicapped imo
---
Is everyone forgetting that base kit nurse is still strong? Good nurses don't run addons.
---
Oh. I did not know. I enjoy his commentary
---
Set off Hag's traps as soon as she sets them so she doesn't have pressure
---
Wraith in himself is a meme and gets gen rushed to shit
---
Play immersed if you're the obsession against Black Box
---
Takes Myers over 3/4 of the game to go to tier 3 with those unless someone intentionally feeds you
---
Ghostface is a joke
---
How the hell are you supposed to see auras when your camera is fixed during traversal and why run that at all when BBQ and Nurse's exist and are just flat out better
---
Auras don't matter when you can just sit on gens and leave in under 3 minutes lol
---
Run Iron Will and Dead Hard if you're that concerned about Spirit
---
Slugging is boring as shit and unfun for either side, tunneling results in no gen pressure meaning more gens done quicker. Keys wouldn't be so bad if a Survivor couldn't pip off using one, or hell even depipped because they used one. Keys and instaheals wouldn't be so bad on their own, but them stacked on top of being able to sit on gens and leave in under 3 mins, DStrike, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable, Deliverance, and every exhaustion perk being great as hell really makes the game infinitely harder and sometimes impossible to win as Killer of everyone is playing meta shit. Playing scummy on the Killer side isn't hard, but it's not what Emblems rewards or gives any amount of BP, despite Survivors playing all sorts of different ways and getting rewarded for each one.
---
Especially if you're also running Breakdown. Bonus points if you're wearing the metalhead skin.
---
Ah thanks forgot about that. Still think she's a victim here but yeah... I mean she still had her mother and herself murdered by her dad and murdering him didnt appease her. The Entity promised her revenge and she accepted. The Entity is a really smart being damn, taking advantage of someone's rage to make them their "slave" in exchange for revenge. I get what you mean that she wouldnt be a victim tho
---
Next killer has to be slap chop gut.
---
Thank you for the rational answer. Check my response under stevencri's post. It further explains everything. Please give a response to that if possible. That clears my mind.
---
.
---
If you downed a survivor that should mean they made a misplay, you outplayed them or you have depleted their resource (pallets).
---
You shouldn't be rewarded for just brainlessly holding W and getting handheld by a game mechanic. It's bad game design and feels unrewarding. It's getting rewarded for making mistakes, kinda like pre-nerf DS and Mettle of men.
---
I don't think this nerf knocks the Nurse off top tier. Even with increased time in between blinks, she can still teleport through walls(except with one of her ultra rares), and cut survivors off. If anything, all this does is raise the skill ceiling for her.
---
Trying to save a teammate from a good camping Billy Or Cannibal is a Suicide Mission.
---
I'm disappointed bubba isn't in his own tier that says BBQ and chili.
---
I'd love to see a xenomorph, or something original that had speed. Not the same way they tried with legion, but I just like to go fast.
---
Does BHVR even use that ranking? ? If they do I wonder how badly the stats are skewed cause the few people who I know that use it just rate every loss 1/5
---
Keep on meme-ing!
---
I've been playing and everything recently but I wasn't sure how the nurse was going to be changed. Thanks for the response!
---
Bubba kills out of fear, in that he believes he will be hurt if anyone is there other than his family because they‚Äôll hurt him. This isn‚Äôt his fault, either. His family manipulated him into killing and doing things for them because he doesn‚Äôt think for himself and lets his family think for him.
---
I don't think the Billy was camping I'm just dumb
---
They shouldnt of touched her base power and only the addons that made her broken aka 5 blinks. The ultra rares are garbage and the rest is at best "eh". If anything the metal spoon is the best addon she got now...
---
I made an edit too. Check it out. I am aware there are TWO gates
---
If you are on WiFi then lag is a thing always you should think about switching to a wired Ethernet connection
---
Well if it ever happens Do Not Try you will probably Die Trying.
---
not really lol, those changes look actually good and why does the last door say Doctor?
---
We need a killer vs killer mode
---
It doesn't matter what the window into the character thinks? Robert was a part of more Nightmare movies than anyone other than maybe Bob Shay.
---
The killer isn't going to see you the instant they go on the book because the animation is still forcing the killer to look AT the hook as they're hooking.
---
Just stay in the locker as lon gas the bubble is there. That's roughly 4 seconds. 
---
Best to go for the locker when someone goes down.
---
*Sacrifice
---
I‚Äôm confused why tho, did they nerf her?
---
Legion can be ‚Äúpedo scum‚Äù if they sent each other nudes.
---
Also, it seems she is reporting on the official help website. Does that change anything? the only way to use picresize screenshots is to upload to there. By my knowledge you cant really report ingame or forums using screenshots (maybe forums.)
---
As pointed out, Myers is evil incarnate. He literally strangled a kid to death in the last movie without hesitation.
---
Why would someone say killer is OP? Maybe *some* are, like Nurse or Huntress, but even then they require tons of practice and skill to get to that point.
---
That‚Äôs the thing though, I didn‚Äôt fucking repost. I thought if this shit while masturbating, and stopped pre-nut just to make it so I didn‚Äôt forget. So like I said before (if you not a little bitch that is) I‚Äôll post a video of me making. I‚Äôd do that just for you.
---
Without any perks or items there is a 10% penalty for each extra survivor. So 2 survivors would take 44 seconds to finish a gen
---
Spirit does, Nurse does not.
---
I am the soul of this subreddit hehehehehehe
---
Sounds like some nice stuff. I particularly like when addons are designed to give temporary bonuses and buffs, or to meaningfully change the killer's moveset and such, rather than simply being stat increases.
---
Ideally, to my mind, all addons would be things like Scratched/Vanity Mirror - things that add some extra spice to the killer's gameplay but that come with their own downsides. I don't know what addons survivors would have in this case, there's not really much scope for unique and interesting stuff there if you ask me. I'd probably remove the addon system for survivors and have a more diverse baseline set of items to bring.
---
I‚Äôd be carful randomly going in party‚Äôs unless your using a vpn
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks!
---
Bruh idk bout that one
---
Where‚Äôd you come up with the 50% kill rate for Legion?
---
You‚Äôre one of the good ones, friend...
---
Killers should be stronger than survivors. Its a 1v4. One side should be stronger than the other by themselves but equal/stronger when together. Rn its the other way around. 80 seconds for a gen where almost no killers can end a chase in less than 40-50 seconds since there are so many second chances.
---
WhErE‚Äôs NeA?
---
Thanatophobia is plagues best perk in my opinion
---
Well the entity essentially is a god.
---
I don't keep up with the news. What changes are coming?
---
IIRC, the kid in the movie had a gun and was old enough to cause problems. Infants on the other hand literally can't do anything to Michael and there'd be no point to killing them.
---
I don't think it's a sign of being less evil. I think it just shows logic and method. Like yeah, peak evil would be the most typical "sadistic pleasure without conscience or reason", but it doesn't make what Michael does or represent any less evil. IMO, it can make his evil more apparent and makes him more terrifying. 
---
It shows thought and consideration instead of mindlessness. It proves either a choice to not conceptualize empathy and right/wrong, or it proves that he is missing an essential link in his mind that would be the last step in "maybe I shouldn't do this". 
---
Someone who meets all his specific, mental personal goals through murder and nothing else strikes me as still pretty evil.
---
But he was not the creator of the character therefore has no say whatsoever in who or what the character is or what motivates them.

---
Its only a PTB. Nothings set in stone yet. With enough player feedback and actual backend data, if her base power change is too much, im sure itll get changed or reverted. But her addons were long overdue for a proper nerf/rework. I dont think nurse is gonna be an instawin anymore, and thats great.
---
Oooooooh there we go
---
There's a lot of stuff you've put in there to make your scenarios obviously more efficient. Firstly, it's less than 30 seconds, about 24 if memory serves, and that's with 1 toolbox, if each of the 3 had a toolbox (like they do in your split up scenario) it'd be even less. You're also not accounting for Prove Thyself which makes it even more efficient to stack on gens. For SWF teams with builds to rush gens it's absolutely more efficient to stack.
---
Shes stupid unfun to play and play against anyways. Literally tunnel the cage every game or get 0k
---
The content I never knew I need

Thorn series is canon. The Halloween series just have different canons and timelines. There‚Äôs Thorn, Water, Zombie and 2018 canons.

Everything but Halloween and Halloween 2018 is not canon.

Oh geez. I want a lawyer!

Hey i typed that while struggling! xD

Used to watch him, don't anymore. He's alright at times, incredibly sensitive though. Often talks trash and resorts to insulting others post-game over literally nothing.
---
This makes me want them more now &lt;;
---
Right? Hag has the most awful backstory imo. At least spirit‚Äôs traumatic experience was over quickly. Poor Lisa suffered for days

It's probably the best slasher movie, and the only one that's actually scared me. Definitely check it out. Just make sure it's the '74 one.

Ok

Im out of the loop what happened

I have Meg and Claudette. But I don't see many Dweets or Jakes.

I'd pay $20.

This is great! I think with pretty much the same effort you could put a few more references in the background. Meathook, L walls, killer shack, stuff like that would be great!

Yea. Thats not great. I agree with you there

I thought tunneling is focusing on a player,,,?

I really need to üò©

Not really it‚Äôs kinda a weak build

Can you put the different people of the legion on there? Cause I'd put Susie on the "victims" category

Well... There will be times you learn where you just gotta leave the teammate when you have an exit lol. Tough decisions to be made sometimes üòÇ
---
You do realize the subreddit‚Äôs been flooded with negative feedback regarding the topic, right?
---
Until the PTB actually comes out and we see what we‚Äôre dealing with here in live matches, who knows what the consensus will be once it‚Äôs done anyway. 
---
But yes, I am fully aware that this subreddit has multiple people and they have different opinions. It‚Äôs a shitpost, dude, relax. (:
---
Pennywise confirmed?
---
Idk what killers you're getting that are rarely running it, but I want to go to there. I get NOED killers pretty often.

Was nurse corrupted? I thought working at an asylum as a cleaner for 20 years just made her mind snap?

Resident Ecil crossover.

Idk why people are freaking out about this, she is still gonna be Top tier. Everyone knew she was broken for ages. Def would have preferred a spirit nerf tho

that just sounds like the game to me dont be toxic to the killer and they wont be toxic to you
---
Most orphaned children also aren't alone in the woods growing up only knowing hunting with little to no schooling.

This seems fine?

Why does David look like he's from runescape?

Hotline Miami killer.

Sidney from Scream to accompany ghostface
---
Red ranks are 90% spirit these days until you actually come across someone good enough to have fun with trapper or leatherface builds
---
Killers who know how to mind game are going to be stronger than previously, at the very least.
---
Not at all, this is a typical end game build, pigs used to do this before the nerf bat.
---
 This really says a lot about our society.
---
Love when the player gets into character and does goofy stuff lol.
---
Yea, Billy is a simpleton, but he still could've been taught better and loved 
---
So I'd consider him under circumstances
---
OINKS FOR THE OINK GOD
---
nurse rework
---
It‚Äôs all about that punishment mode. He isn‚Äôt power walking when he‚Äôs in treatment because he is sad boy and walks slower in treatment because his leg needs treatment and he‚Äôs taking it easy compared to his rambunctious punishment mode.
---
Or if you're wraith you'll fake a cloak to make them burn it lmao
---
Wraith wouldn't poison it tf?
---
Does he actually make no sounds or are they just quieter?
---
I‚Äôd never say it myself, but if you‚Äôre the type of survivor to click a flashlight at a killer, i couldn‚Äôt give a shit if you killed yourself or how it affects any of your loved ones.
---
The ptb isn't even live yet my guy, we don't know the full extent of the nerf
---
Use vaults to force the M1
---
They did change her base kit
---
Thanks.
---
Who is the true camper?
---
The survivor who camps the hook waiting for the killer to leave or the killer who camps the hook because they know the survivor is there?
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the way your dressed?
---
I‚Äôd swap pig and trapper personally
---
Spireh nerf is absolutely next. Tru called that as well.

so what do bubba's chili addons do when they say acceleration
---
Cause RNG is out of control in this game.

But Freddy wears a Christmas sweater all year. And is also  a pedo that's also important 
---
Why is it even the shitty remake version anyway?

It was just a short test on live. They've been disabled.

Am I correct in understanding that a coop repaired generator gives you no points at all in the lightbringer category?

Did you mean to tell me this three times?

I see nothing wrong with wearing an ice cream parlor uniform to a twisted version of hide and seek where your life is on the line
---
I still think legion is the worst killer.
---
The pig and leather face have decent skills.
---
Legion runs slightly faster and loses the ability to down anyone.
---
This is honestly super dope. Make more and sell posters üíØ

That was a sponge bob meme ;)
---
I feel like bubba belongs in another category because in the movies it‚Äôs implied he was never taught anything other than to use his chainsaw and to obey his brother and his family
---
Great.....
---
I would run save the best for last, haunted grounds, ruin (or any perk to slow the game down), and play w/your food
---
Wouldn't surprise me. No one is safe from these fools. Won't do shit about SWFs though of course.
---
I knew when he got pessimistic about the Nurse that shit was about to hit the fan. He has inside info obviously. When he got like that everyone should have taken notice.
---
I mean technically he is shirtless
---
There's a good chance
---
Imagine trapper without trapper bag. Or ghostfsce without stalking speed add ons, or base kit wraith, base pig, base clown.
---
Its like mortal kombats new variation system. You get to choose what abilities you want to add on or replace to your base kit. It creates identity and variety. It also makes killers more enjoyable. The only killer i can play base kit with nothing at all is billy. I used him to get bloodpoints for other killers bc their base kit is just unproductive at high ranks.

I really love how you didn't just make a 2D version of the characters but really committed to that retro style. Dwoght doesn't really look like Dwight in terms of facials, but his face totally fits the vibe (and you can clearly tell who it is.) Same with trapper and his mask, it feels a little more malicious than the regular mask.
---
Fantastic job. Only critique: "Treacherous," not "trecherous"
---
Excited for literally anything else you do, but doing Nea as a killer would be great. Maybe she could be the mentor to the Legion gang or something, or the killer for them (since there are 4 of them to work with as faux survivors) but that's all up to you.

How is Freddy a pedo? I don't understand.
---
As an add-on less nurse since literally she got released (shout out to TheSwiftLegend), the add ons changes don‚Äôt phase me much. I‚Äôm interested to see how her base power performs in in the PTB before jumping to any real conclusions.
---
At face value, this is def going to be different. I actually had trouble TPing to the right places (TPing in place) prior to this nerf, but I swear i wasn‚Äôt TPing in place that often when I played her before...
---
Am i missing something?
---
They only nerfed the bonus blinks and Omega blinks.
---
She's just fine as long as they leave her base power alone.
---
God i hate remake freddy
---
I have ghost boi and he‚Äôs very fun, I was thinking of the p3 but I decided I would do that on a diff killer so I did it on Gordon.
---
Unfortunately poe's law got me here with the amount of people saying stuff like that seriously in nearly every thread
---
Lol
---
What did they change her kit to?
---
I run Small Game because I switched Self-care for Inner Strenght. I  can also find and cleanse Ruin early in the match.  And  this perk is  good  to  avoid  NOED. Best  map  to  hide  a  hex totem is Springwood. It has the best spots. Worst maps are the Macmillan State (easy to memorize spots) and Coldwing Farm (most of the times the hex will spawn in the cornfield).

wait, there will be a battlepass?
---
Demogorgon with mad grit. Can hear it across the entire map.
---
You need to have a charge to blink. Charges recharge over three seconds starting with fatigue after blinking. Nurse now has to wait before double blinking again
---
3 Viable killers in the game
---
Take one down, nerf it all around
---
2 viable killers in the game
---
...
---
Survivors are
---
Bruh she‚Äôs so slow how are you ever gonna catch up
---
Yeah I mean, I couldn't think of any other word but my point being is he could've just waited at the door and that would've been boring for both players. This is more interesting but I wouldn't blame a killer for just doing the best method.
---
I feel like everyone who says this isn't r1, or is just parroting some streamers.
---
It‚Äôll for sure be frustrating when you‚Äôre literally moving slower than the survivor and can‚Äôt blink to catch up
---
Shouldn't Nazi be capitalized? Or nah
---
I heard Julies ramen is to DIE for
---
No, they will not do Ru region server. And the distance between Britain and like Ukraine is like distance between 2 cities in Russia xD. Yet its a shame that small Europe have 2 servers, when whole Russia and post-USSR region aint got one.
---
Damn, it probably should be. Added.
---
For now wraith is affected by those perks, I have a feeling he might get undetectable at some point since they said they're consolidating stealth mechanics to that status, also wraiths power is far more useful than you're giving him credit for, he's been in a good spot since his buff and add-on rework, I'd say bubba deserves the worst spot, sure the chainsaw can one hit, if you ever land that one hit, basically unless you catch a survivor in a really bad spot you might as well forget the chainsaw
---
Which is funny because he was, from what I can see, in a good spot still. 3 injured and no gens yet.
---
Spirit has the best walk
---
So creepy when she chases you and her spasms and phasing in and out
---
Because that's the one they could license.
---
Okay so I haven't been playing long but from what I hear nurse and spirit are pretty much Unstoppable at rank 1. All I'm saying is if they get nerfed maybe people start using other killers and get better at them and learning techniques to make more Killers viable at rank one. I don't know that's just what I've gathered in the month that I've been playing.
---
You're actually dumb if you legitimately think that, she'll most likely still be top tier
---
And what did I lie about?
---
Coming with the Archives, yes.
---
I hope we get one for Ace
---
No, he was tought by his father who made him kile that
---
red head is a terrible add on for clown. once people know you have it theyll just juke you and buy them and their team tons of time. flask of bleach is hanslds down the best clown addon
---
Buff 11 or 12 other Killers instead of nerfing one or two so that people start using the others and get better at them, which one is easier? I don't know dude, I've only been playing like one month and I'm just basing this off of what I've read hearing on forums, that nurse and spirit are pretty much Unstoppable at rank one. I guess I don't know what viable means apparently.
---
R/unexpectedjojo
---
Shes gonna drop below spirit billy huntress, maybe even hag. The punishment is way worse than it should be. Putting a cd on a power like here is pointless. It ruins the whole point of her power. She's meant to be chase heavy. But she lacks in tracking to exchange. But its whatever. Shes gutted, spirits gonna be gutted next.
---
I‚Äôd be more afraid of ghostface if I didn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs a literal high schooler
---
What does blink accuracy mean in the nurse's addons?
---
Yep.
---
Super fair change. The fatigue was negligible.
---
Can‚Äôt say he didn‚Äôt warn you lol
---
Nobody expects it on a Claudette though!
---
Viable means that they're the only killers strong enough in the meta to get kills against survivors in the meta.
---
Basically if you play against a team of people who don't make mistakes. You can't actually do anything to stop them. I'm not saying most people in the game. I'm saying that at the top tier of rank 1 players who have thousands of hours. Nurse and Spirit are the only killers who can actually stand a chance.
---
They didn't leave her base power alone. She has to recharge her blinks one at a time after this change. So if you blink twice, you need to wait **n** seconds to blink once and **2n** seconds to blink twice again. With the base stats, it's 3 seconds of waiting per blink. So if you want your two blinks, that's 6 seconds of free time for the survivors.
---
Some of the add-on changes seem cool, though. And the add-ons were the only thing broken about her.
---
Most of the Mori's are bullshit too. 
---
Keys letting people through trap doors early and instaheal medkits are very game warping.
---
Tf? I didn't even know this was a thing ,that's honestly so fucking cool
---
Good point
---
If you are talking about promoting my youtube,I couldn't post any link on reddit because I am sa new account.So my links got automatically removed from reddit, or at least that is what I was told
---
As someone who has actually struggled with self eateem and suicide, being told to kill mysef on the game sucks, like, a lot. I play games as an escape from the struggles of the real world, where things go wrong and bad and make me want to end it all, even if it is just a stranger on the internet, trust me, it makes you actually want to when you're going through that rough patch, I'mnjust lucky I wasn't at my worst when I hot told that. I don't see it often which is good, but I've never been to the red ranks (Indon't really have enough time to play)
---
I‚Äôm guessing the demogorgon would go under simpletons or its own category
---
I love my loud boi, so satisfying hearing that screech of triumph after  a chase against a tough survivor
---
Wait so not only will they no longer activate if you use them during the endgame, but already active traps can just walk out?
---
Billy definitely isn't braindead, considering his perks. Tinkerer, if it was lore friendly, means he knows how to mess with gadgets and his chainsaw.
---
Interesting
---
Infinites aren't even in the game anymore.
---
TIL that the Switch isn't a console
---
It‚Äôs Ash so he gets out instantly
---
‚ÄúYou dare oppose me mortal?‚Äù How bout that?
---
How does that work??? When it's charging how are you supposed to keep up with survivors when you move slower than them?
---
Frank is on the Psycho level.
---
The others are Naive, yeah.
---
No you still have to do that. It's just that after you're finished doing that you have to wait longer before blinking again. Two cooldowns essentially
---
 just want shreded myers thats all
---
People are just too lazy to learn how to play against her. They would rather say she‚Äôs OP than actually taking the time to learn how to counter her. The only thing OP about her are her Prayer Beads. They should not be in the game imo. The rest of her is pretty balanced imo. 
---
I play a mean Spirit, and people are still able to juke me at red ranks. These people actually understand how the Spirit works and have taken the time to learn to counter her.
---
But it‚Äôs 2019 and people complain about anything that is remotely a challenge. They will just keep whining until they nerf her like they did Nurse. 
---
Remember, if a 4 man SWF with meta perks and insta heals isn‚Äôt able to easily bully a killer, then they are OP.
---
PTBs tomorrow. We'll see then. It doesn't sound good for her atm.
---
Pig should be underneath the coffin
---
Suns going low big guy

That was dope, whats up with these haters thoughüòÇüòÇ that tea bag was fine üëç
---
I find Myers and Freddy to be the most fun.  
---
If BBQ or Hex: Ruin every show up in the shrine you need to jump on that.  Have shards ready to go.
---
This is satisfying to watch. I love to t-bag a toxic killer. It just feel so amazing afterwards. Nice one! Keep putting toxic killers in their place whenever you can!
---
I understand why they did though, along with the longer range blinks. The thing is, Base nurse is super strong and doesn't need those kind of add-ons. Of course they had to gut her though, can't wait to see nothing but prayer beads spirits. Which is a shame, because I LIKE prayer beads spirit, it's fun, just not every game fun, kinda like scratched mirror myers
---
I‚Äôm very happy with the nurse rework. This meme is truly just to point out that people complain about certain killers being OP and needing a rework but when we finally get one they are upset and don‚Äôt want it. I love BHVR and all the work they‚Äôve put into making this game enjoyable. Let‚Äôs thank them now, THANK U BEAUTIFUL DEVS. We love u &lt;3
---
The reason they release the news at the same time is to try manipulate the community to handle the outrage. It's a marketing strategy
---
Ah my favorite time, when i get to do my adept achievements and I don't needing FUCKING HEX: RUIN.
---
Finally a meta shift, they need to keep it.
---
*I‚Äôm Laurie so I must have decisive*
---
They did not need to add the charge timer
---
Imagine having this opinion lol
---
By meta shift you mean, an injection of spirits?
---
Susie didn't even even stab the guy, she just held the knife and frank pushed it in for her because she was probably terrified.
---
Aye but wasn‚Äôt nurse just a tad bit overpowered? I mean ignoring any and all things survivors can use to get distance?
---
&gt; ‚ÄúYou dare oppose me mortal?
---
No, they didn't. It's going to severely hurt Nurse in higher ranks, did they even adjust the fatigue time for her to compensate?
---
What did Freddie do that was pedo? Never see his movies
---
Demo would be in its own category under the psychopath tier.
---
Nope. Just straight nerf. Pretty much need to wait 10 seconds per hit. If you're flawless and never miss.
---
he's just quieter
---
So I guess every survivor Nerf is killers bitching then right? Oh no of course not, killers are just the oppressed masses being bullied by everyone. Apparently you don't get the concept of balance, it's give and take and this was bound to happen eventually, theyve talked about this happening a long time ago, but most people just assumed it wouldn't happen because they're stupid. Also I use a controller on PC and have finished Every one of her achievements with relative ease, if you think she's actually that hard to play you're deluding yourself.
---
Not a long time as Hag or Trapper
---
Well, not true infinites, but there are still non-pallet loops in this game that are called ‚Äúinfinites‚Äù - window loops where a killer cannot mindgame and is forced to either entity block or give up a chase because of the extreme amount of timesink required to block said loop. Stuff like the Ironworks building window or the Shop Double window are considered ‚Äúinfinites‚Äù. Another example are ‚ÄúBL infinites‚Äù - infinites created by use of the Balanced Landing perk. The most popular examples of these ‚ÄúBL infinites‚Äù are the Myers house infinite and the tractor infinite.

Thats fine, maybe thell chnage her next, but atleast no more insta downs with 0 counter play, atleast spirit follows game mechanics, nurse ignores everything the game is
---
Yes. Which is why they should nerf what I had mentioned. They didn't need to completely ruin her like they did. The base kit nerf is too much.
---
It really doesn't take as much skill to point and teleport than you think brah
---
Yea that's why Spirit will be best killer if the changes go through.
---
Isn‚Äôt it just sort off assumed that the survivors probably have at least one of their perks if it‚Äôs semi-useful.
---
Current pallets are so garbage, I don't even get how he used it.
---
He wasn't dead stopped pixel perfect in the center of the pallet.
---
Dr. Samuel Loomis would argue that Michael Myers is PURE EVIL. üë¥üèª
---
You know it‚Äôs nice to have someone with a clear idea of what to expect give such level headed impressions without seeing anything. Hopefully we find someone like that.
---
I agree she needed a nerf. But they gutted her to shreds. She's not even going to be top tier with this nerf.
---
I tried to lump them into one but I guess they would be on different tiers. I‚Äôd have to reread the bio to know where Susie would go.
---
#rEmOvE BlOoDlUsT
---
What lol its a good play
---
That's not an infinite then, those are just god loops. Infinites are that, literally an infinite loop.
---
me when I'm unhooked 10 meters from ghostface and he goes after me instead of the one he just exposed
---
Easily. No question. Nurse will still be above mid tier probably but Billy and Freddy and maybe Hag will surpass her.
---
What if you can‚Äôt blink through corn because of line of sight (like Myers Stalk)?
---
If ghostface is anything to go by, Corn could block LoS
---
Old Red Paint Brush was better. Loved comboing that with M&amp;A on Lerys.
---
she readjusts her grip on the chain
---
Why is my comment getting automatically deleted from this thread?
---
sun?
---
Dedicated servers are no ready yet. Killers have tons of bugs and hitboxes are broken, also dh almost never worked. They will be released eventualy but not now.
---
She 100% needed a recharge mechanic, that's what you all claim she is gutted, but she needed that. She will just be harder to use, if you were not messing up your blinks you have nothing to worry about
---
Sorry this got downvoted, salty ass survivor mains giving you crap for assuming it got nerfed too hard when they don't know the effects either
---
Devs: Face camping doesn‚Äôt exi-
---
Leather face: ‚ÄúSup‚Äù :|
---
The DBD version of Freddy is based on the 2010 remake where he is a child molester. Also, in the original he is a child murderer and I don‚Äôt believe it is ever explicitly stated that he molested them also. Again, the DBD version is the one I base my placement on.
---
"She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie is disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man's throat."
---
how about you keep up with my rad tempo you slowpoke dorks, the longer you're hooked the slower we get outta this dive, ya dig?
---
Can you tell me more about Hag? She continues to eat people... at some point I feel like its a choice, but I don't know much beyond her bio.
---
Now they're nerfing nurse let's nerf the instaheal for survivors please.
---
He should go outside for a STRID OR he might get cranky
---
Wait what happened?
---
Lol yea feelsbadman I am with ya.
---
Honestly, I rarely see GOOD Nurses anymore. The only nurses I saw was low skill ones using her old op addons to compensate. I think a majority of old nurse players switched to spirit because it‚Äôs easier (IMO) and just as rewarding if not better. I feel like because of this the nerf isn‚Äôt a huge hit. Yea we might no see ANY nurses anymore. But I think as an old nurse main I‚Äôm okay with this change. But I except spirit to be nerfed soon. She‚Äôs sooo easy to play for how good she performs. Prayer beads fucking dumb btw. I NEVER lose with them on. (Red rank killer btw) no way to counter it unless you know you‚Äôre about to play against it.
---
As a Ghostface main i agree with everything you said. Uh, Dying light is another perk that i sometimes run
---
Mending isn't affected by thanat afaik, it's not considered healing
---
Life
---
Mind your own frickin business.
---
Freddy is certainly way stronger, I think another reason why is higher tier is just because he is really easy to use, so it's easier to get good results than let's say hillbilly, I've always considered hillbilly a tad overrated and viewed him at the bottom of S or top of A
---
Doesn‚Äôt even look like a SWF, the downed surv didn‚Äôt crawl closer to the locker anyways. Also that‚Äôs kind of the point of head on chief so gtfo if you‚Äôre that fragile
---
If you're a new killer, it's likely that people will escape more often than not, especially if you're being matched with more experienced people. I play mostly solo survivor, close to red ranks, and I probably escape 30% of the time. That number increases a lot if I am playing with at least one other person (maybe 60 - 70%).
---
&gt;If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
#This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
This thread just shows matchmaking working exactly like it is supposed to. When you titled "new ranking change is great and works well" I am not sure if you are being sarcastic or not considering the amount of people that complain about MM.
---
But that makes one of Nurse's achievements impossible
---
Yeah, it's easy to miss cause you have to specifically look at the shirts. It won't show in the outfits section.
---
Or not everything has to make perfect logical sense because it's a game and it needs balance
---
There's a difference between interesting new changes and a whole-ass basekit nerf disguised for months as an "add-on rework"
---
It wasnt even that big of a nerf. She's just not stupidly broken anymore. Check the link of the [patch notes](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/designer-notes-nurse-changes)
---
I have many strong opinions on some of your placements but then I remembered it's a meme
---
Yes, but Loomis wasn't being literal- at least, he couldn't be, unless he somehow had some uncanny insight into the supernatural, which we have no reason to believe. He was speaking as a disillusioned psychiatric specialist who couldn't make sense of his patient, speculating with metaphorical language on just what such a person could be. Michael being a force of nature wasn't a *literal* thing until later films. It was left much more mysterious in the original.
---
With the new pallet philosophy he is outdated. Loops are too small to curve which forces him to m1 at every loop. Making him weak.
---
Gimmie that DAD BOD
---
&gt;If you think the add-on rework wasn't coming with a nerf then idk what you were expecting
---
BHVR SPECIFICALLY said they will barely touch her power If they do at all. Yet the base power change is probably the biggest thing here.
---
Nah. The ratio would basically be 2 killers on two people while 6 survivors do what they want.
---
Moment of silence for the poor redditor that passed away while writing this.
---
What‚Äôs the hate with .ttv? I‚Äôm a console killer so I never see streamers, but why are they hated
---
Practice what you preach
---
Then SWF needs to follow.
---
Very well written post, I enjoyed reading it
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the plan
---
We must protect Dweetvid. Or is it Davight?
---
Yea, he's been more loopable for sure, he's always been loopable in my eyes though, he's still very strong though.
---
freddy lets the kids come in to get candy
---
Yes. It would allow people to get out what they have to say quickly instead of people messaging each other for days.
---
Because both are nerfs.
---
We are consistent do not nerf killer shit.
---
People have no clue what they want lol
---
They‚Äôll change it almost definitley
---
Lemme sweeten the deal then: Dead by Daylight Mortal Kombat style fighting game.
---
Demo is basically just an animal though, or you could argue they are controlled by the mind flayer which would put them in corrupted category or in the same sort of group where killers only kill because you could argue the mind flayer is similar to the entity.
---
‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù -The Freak
---
Tfw I got hit during my Dead Hard and I still got exhausted :(
---
Whether authorial intent actually matters vs. the content speaking for itself is actually very much in debate. Especially when it comes to film, this being a great example. The writing team says no, but the actor who made decisions about how to portray this character said yes. So if people watch the film and conclude Krueger is a pedo based on the way Englund decided to portray it, that's a perfectly reasonable interpretation, considering his performance is actually in the content of the film, whether the writers wanted it like that or not.
---
finally
---
What, that we‚Äôre in it?
---
Huntress needs her own category ‚Äútakes your candy‚Äù and bubba needs his own ‚Äúshares his candy with huntress‚Äù
---
I expected her to not get fucking Obliterated. I defended BHVR through this rework process bc I trusted they would follow through on their word that they'd be calculated with these nerfs and they let me down. 
---
Thanks BHVR. Last time I ever defend you guys.
---
They‚Äôre just trying to make themselves feel better by belittling you over a video game cause they‚Äôre losers. Move on to the next game and don‚Äôt let them get in your head.
---
From what I have experienced , some come with comms and friends and be toxic to the killer so being that common at times they bring mori
---
Agreed but the problem is they didn't do anything to adress the times when you couldn't hit anything. As it is now i think they lowered her skill cap but didn't change her skill floor (which is really high i think)
---
I love this
---
Wasn't Wraith just some dude who was tricked into committing crimes?
---
Otz has interesting builds with PWYF
---
Nah
---
Lol I don‚Äôt use addons man and I think the addons should change it‚Äôs the fucking 6 seconds of charge to get her two blinks back that I‚Äôm upset about
---
I'm not a fan of the power rework but I'll live- Really excited for the add-ons though!
---
Take a shower and wash some of that salt off dude. She‚Äôs still going to be a top tier killer in good hands. 
---
I look forward to the spirit nerf when it comes xo
---
You misspelled nerf
---
I feel like her purples and reds are two steps forward then one back. They penalize HER for some reason.
---
beat me to the comment lol. but yes that is in her story
---
I mean you could just loop them for 5 gens?
---
Isn't that why everyone said plague was garbage? You can just stay 1 shot the whole match and loop them all match to deny corrupt?
---
That'd basically be Ghost Face with power spam except ghost could hide terror radius.
---
Never said it wasn't. Dead hards will be a great counter, but if the Nurse is good enough to predict the movement, the dead hard was wasted.
---
&gt;Gen speed is fine 
---
Oh my sweet summer child.
---
It needs a nerf. Or a rarity change.
---
????? Who the fuck is saying she got buffed? That‚Äôs blatantly untrue
---
Actual game play does have a place but one of you is here EVERY time patch notes come out to say nobody is allowed to have an opinion, and 99% of the time, people are able to work out what's shit before it's up for testing.
---
A rather loud sound notification is played when a teammate cleanses, but you'd have to see the cleansing pool light go out in order to know where they did it
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be too sure she isn‚Äôt next, my brother
---
I'm pretty sure what they meant by that was that they weren't going to change it extremely like they did with Freddy. But I haven't seen their statements so I could be wrong.
---
That's if she has a perfect first blink, perfectly waits it out, and perfectly predicts the landing of their dead hard. It's definitely doable but it's more so a survivors ability to moae a mistake than it is hers to predict.
---
Also all skilled nurses use reaction not prediction. Prediction is unreliable.
---
Oh that's how I didn't detect a Micheal Myers and got pulled off a gen. I was too reliant on spine chill. I thought it went off when they are simply looking in your direction within a certain amount of meters. Is it terror radius based or something?
---
I just think it needs to be removed. It's unhealthy for the game.
---
Which Nurses have you been playing that ignore Dead Hard?
---
Yeah it's literally stated that Myers is like, *too* evil for the Entity, cause the Entity wants to toy with survivors, make them experience hope, suffering, the rush of victory and the crush of defeat, since it feeds off emotions and stuff. When it employed Myers it wasn't expecting him to walk up and literally just stab people to death without any sort of flair and the Entity is just like "Dude what the fuck". In terms of gameplay this is reflected in the fact that you can get 4 kills with very few or even without ever hooking anybody via add-ons.
---
So this is speculation but doesn‚Äôt that technically mean Myers would be the first non human killer and not demo? (I‚Äôm assuming not but idk)
---
"I'm a former pig main" usually implies that you're very familiar and have been playing awhile - saying that you're a former anything means you have a significant amount of experience with something, not that you just played as them before. I played wraith for a day once and played as no one else, am I am former wraith main? Then "And while I'm somewhat new", so you played pig like for 5 hours of in game time and dropped her, that makes you a former a pig main?
---
And it's a game. It should be fun. Yeah, learning and adapting to game mechanics are part of the fun, but there are thresholds to where it stops being viable or fun. Just because people are complaining doesn't automatically make them lazy people. Some changes are unfair and makes the game unfun. It's not about adapting, it's about keeping the game fun, and some changes make it less fun.
---
Yeah survivors complain too much. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprise if they nerfed her next
---
Prayer beads are undeniably aids, no counter play outside of Spine Chill, I‚Äôd argue that an aggressively OP add on is toxic and you should be able to recognize that, run it all you want, be prepared to be called out for running aids on a killer that could have 0 perks and add ones and still be top 20%, spirit and prayer beads need some work. -ghost face main
---
Michael could technically be put in the victim slot because hes possessed by a cursed spirit forcing him to do what he does
---
Dirty camper: leather face
---
Imagine wanting an add on to become an m1 killer
---
so is bubba, his family abuses him. in fact that they were an inspiration to RE7. i only saw the first movie though.

I don't even bother on PSN, but with Xbox I always send a gg as it's really simple and fast. With PC it's just much easier and faster to type on a keyboard pre and post game chat. I'm not against this, but I don't know if it will be worth it.
---
Nurse base kit was 100% fine, same with Spirit. Clown is bad.
---
Piggy 100% turns her house into a spooky Haunted House every Halloween.
---
I‚Äôve never really seen how Dead Hard is a useful perk. As a killer I can generally catch up to the survivor in relatively short time after they use it and then after I realize they have it I‚Äôm becoming better at removing it from their arsenal. I don‚Äôt think I would ever use this perk. In fact David is one of the few I haven‚Äôt even leveled up.
---
But the demodogs grow into demogorgons. If the demodogs are under the Flayer's control, I think the implication is the gorgons are too. Maybe not the Demogorgon from the first season (when the Mind Flayer seemingly wasn't quite as interested in the normal world) wasn't under its control but I think we're supposed to believe most are as long as they're in the Upside Down or are closely tied to it
---
Which raises the question of how tf the Entity got control of one. Did the Mind Flayer just hand one over? Did they have an exchange where the Trapper is hunting down Eleven for a demo? Or maybe the Entity just stole one amidst all the chaos
---
Not necessarily. I mean, you're welcome to prefer their interpretation, but there's plenty of argument for basing interpretation of something off of the *content* alone, without regard to ad hoc statements made by the author after or even before it reaches the public. 
---
No one can claim authorial intent trumps all like it's a fact when this issue is and has been [hotly debated for years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorial_intent). Ultimately it comes down to preference: do you prefer to base your interpretation of a piece of art on the art itself, or do you defer to outside statements by the author/creator about their intentions? The point isn't that you or Jaraxxus is right or wrong, only that it isn't as cut and dry as either of you are making it out to be.
---
Demo is obviously pedo scum with his scrotum face
---
will **Spasmodic Breath**  \+  **Matchbox**  work? Sounds fun
---
Oh shit I remember that video
---
**Authorial intent**
---
In literary theory and aesthetics, authorial intent refers to an author's intent as it is encoded in their work. Authorial intentionalism is the view, according to which an author's intentions should constrain the ways in which it is properly interpreted.

What killers can reliably stop a red rank 4man swf with tool kits, instaheals, and meta perks?
---
IIRC she gives them food but forget they need water and die dehydrated, but I might be wrong
---
Prayer beads spirit with a mori.
---
Insta-saw billy with a mori.
---
Iridescent head huntress, with again, a mori.
---
What a fucking relief
---
&gt;Nurse base kit was 100% fine, same with Spirit. Clown is bad.
---
Nurse has never been fine. Base Nurse wasn't as broken as add-on Nurse but that doesn't mean she was fine. Especially with certain players using Ruin + PGTW + whatever else you can think of on a character that ends chases instantly.
---
‚ÄúSpirit is too strong, let‚Äôs nerf the most reliable way to find survivors‚Äù
---
Thats the only one that matters and youre correct in that he's abused
---
Nurse without addons has counterplay.
---
We should add 5 more gens, that way the matches are fun and the killer can be a drooling baby that doesn't know how to put pressure on the map, because that's apparently the ideal scenario.
---
If you know what you're doing as killer, the gen speed is fine. If not then that's more on you.
---
Yep, 1 step at a time, theyve been needing buffs for quite a while but id be happier with a spirit rework. So i can finally play her. A no feedback power aint pretty. Im a killer main but after seeing how poeple destroy with spirit nurse makes me feel bad for using them, kinda feels like using a mori or 1 hit addons
---
Yeah I assumed someone would say that but I guess if somehow he kinda came to life in the movies like out of the blue with no childhood or anything then he might
---
She's an anti-vaxer.
---
Nurse base kit has counter play.
---
three seconds is like a whole gen dude
---
Im glad to see this change, and Im sure experienced nurse players wont have an issue with this.
---
Meh they‚Äôre trying dog
---
*Myers default dancing*
---
I wouldn't worry about that if Archives are good.
---
Isn't there supposed to be a web of challenges or something? I heard of one back when they were leaked it was something like "Trap a survivor as they vault a window".
---
If killers/survivors get forced challenges like this to unlock the archives charms/lore and progress on the rift/battle pass then people will be forced to play a variety of killers including this nerfed Nurse.
---
Having to play Trapper or not level up the new content would get people to play Trapper.
---
Variety would be at an all time high and the rumor is Archives will be on a 2 week drip feed so there will always be ones to do.
---
Guess we will see once the PTB starts. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
were you following company's uniform policy?
---
Unfortunately there really isn't much they can do beyond getting more people to play that are close to your ranks in your area. The system is doing the best it can to matchmake you and if there isn't anyone in your area near your rank, it expands the search. I can't see that getting any better when DS are implemented. The only way they can fix this is to allow crossplay which will only help consoles. 
---
I was playing BO4 today w/ rank 4 players and I'm a Prestige 5. There just isn't a good system in place to matchmake for most games.
---
What is changing for medkit?
---
You can only learn to play against her to a certain point lol, same reason nurse is getting nerfed, you ran run back on yourself and hope they‚Äôre bad but a good spirit is ridiculously unfun to play against once you‚Äôre injured, and even before with passive phasing allowing completely unpredictable mind games at times and no window animation is just as ridiculous, it‚Äôs not about bullying it‚Äôs about balance, killers should be stronger but that bar should be even between every killer but spirit is now the sole SS tier and is so far above other killers and so so so so far above survivors with good perks, which arent perfect either.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but you didn‚Äôt mention anything.
---
Are you confused?
---
&gt;spine chill
---
Throw Claude's scream in between the shuttle and the whale. It hurts.
---
Yes, Killers have more powerful tools and perks
---
And there are 4 survivors.
---
No matter which side you're on, you feel weaker than the opponent, because
---
Survivor perks &lt; Killer perks &lt; Survivor perks\*4
---
Instaheals (the 2-state ones) are legit broken and you can have 4 in a match, each one stealing over a minute of m1 killer's time.
---
Anything else?
---
Awesome
---
Good list. Interesting points. I would put pig higher; she had bad influences but she committed heinous acts while being of sound mind and body imo
---
I think Leatherface fits under Simpleton, Shitty Circumstances, Corrupted *and* Victim. His family? Evil as shit. Him? Not evil, just doesn't know any better, and every bad thing he does was taught to him by his family. Had he been born to a normal family, he... well, wouldn't have lead a normal life, but he'd at least (probably) be harmless.  
---
(A lot of that applies to Jason Voorhees, too, come to think of it)
---
I KNOW RIGHT!?
---
Remember when the huntress was first released and every time you got hit by a hatchet it sounded like a literal gunshot blowing out your eardrums?
---
how exactly would you go about nerfing SWF?
---
&gt;Undetectable for **16** seconds
---
115 for 60.
---
She becomes an M1 killer for 60 seconds.
---
This is not a good addon.
---
Omg you are totally right I thought this was a different post XD I'm so sorry. I made a reddit post talking about how she was overnerfed with her base kit changes.
---
#IM JUST TRYNA PLAY BUBBA
---
This lol
---
I wouldn‚Äôt like it honestly. I don‚Äôt really care what others have to say. Plus even if you were helpful or not, people in chat will most likely throw some salt. Whether it‚Äôs direct or indirectly at you. Half the time I‚Äôm sure people will ignore what‚Äôs been said and would rather find another match.
---
to be fair if I saw this as killer, I'd want to join in and dance with them.

This guys gets it

Counterplay is not the same thing as counter build.
---
I played for just under two hours tonight and deranked twice. It is not a good dbd day.

You‚Äôre assuming that is the case with every game? lol

You have to see you‚Äôre being annoying and arguing about evolved semantics, labels change, labels are different from person to person

Was it on PS4?

---
&gt;Nurse base kit has counter play.
---
k 
---
Thankfully devs disagree with this statement.
---
Swf is stupid and needs nerfed. Gen speed is debatable. I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair, but then again, you have Ruin. There‚Äôs literally no way to counter both the nurse and toxic swf groups. At the same time, gen speed doesn‚Äôt matter for me when I play killer. I main Billy. That level of map pressure helps with gens by itself. For killers who don‚Äôt really have any map pressure and you have other perks that are more important than things like ruin and overcharge, I honestly don‚Äôt have much of an argument.
---
If I recall correctly, there‚Äôs a huntress hex that eliminates skill check noise, and holy sh*t. I can do hex skill checks. I cannot do soundless skill checks. Personally, that hex is the bane of my existence.
---
I must say: it is an asymmetric game. You can‚Äôt really help stuff like that. I, personally, had no problem with how powerful the nurse was, because she takes a lot of time to master. I can respect something so hard to counter with that amount of time put into mastering it. 
---
Quite honestly, I do have a somewhat biased standpoint. I play a lot more survivor than killer, and I‚Äôm a bit spoiled with the fact that my killer main - Billy - is still pretty decent, but hasn‚Äôt been nerfed - at least not yet, to my knowledge - so I don‚Äôt really know the pain of it.
---
He is immune of spine chill at tier 1 IIRC
---
This huntress buff looks neat. She became the second best killer in the game!
---
and the top1 is getting nerfed!
---
Huntress S-tier confirmed
---
FWIW, the Russian words are pronounced "Tony Boltoon (Boltoon as in cartoon)", so I think it's just some dude's name
---
I'll try üò≠. I'm already a Myers/Spirit main so it shouldn't hurt me much, but still. Nurse is legendary.
---
Oooh I see. Useful info right here, thank you.
---
You totally did not get the point.
---
Yes. Running spine chill is a counter. But yiud need to know you're playing a prayer bead spirit ahead of time to change your build to counter them
---
Counterplay means using tactics or a strategy while in game to counter something.
---
While in game there's nothing you can do to stop them. At best you can Gen tap and give them free hits. Which is just as miserable.
---
Undetectable for 16 seconds after you hit a survivor.
---
It'll take 6 or 7 of those to lose the survivor you just hit.
---
PWYF would have 2 stacks at max because the addon requires a hit to trigger.
---
She becomes an objectively weaker Ghostface for 2 very rare addons
---
Probably corrupted then.
---
Hence why I said all this does is raise her skill ceiling. The Nurse as a killer is the quickest in closing that gap. Now all she needs is an even more skilled player to wield her with this nerf.
---
How do blood webs work? I am only level 8 but i see that passives keep repeating themselves every time i level up the blood web.
---
SWF is probably never getting nerfed. Punishing people who just want to play with their friends will kill this game.
---
I wanna see Bubba's mori as a fatality on The Nurse
---
They also unhook and hide straight away, making it so the only person you hear is the poor unhooked 
---
soul
---
&gt;Killers addons better than survivor addons
---
&gt;**Power role** better stuff than single **swarm role**
---
I think thats the intent for asymmetrical games.
---
So we‚Äôre just gonna pretend Myers isn‚Äôt out there Trick or Treating for fucking souls?
---
I always just assumed the Demodogs/gorgons were just wild animals in the Upside Down, but were being controlled at the needs of the Mind Flayer much like Will, Billy, and The Flayed were.

If you're playing on a TV, use game mode and turn off any useless functions that would cause lag. It also helps to plug the controller in and not use Bluetooth.
---
OH THANK FUCK PRAISE GOD DAMN CTHULHU I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN!
---
It keeps Nurse able to break and end chases easy with high enough skill but makes it so games vs Nurse isn't just hide and seek vs the best killer in the game. 
---
Now hopefully Billy running at you with a Saw will sound like it as it is hard to tell at all right now.
---
TIL the term "chomo"
---
What is PWYF if u dont mind me asking
---
Tunneling is mega toxic my guy, and tunneling isn‚Äôt even rewarding because you‚Äôre in a 1V4 so in all honesty you‚Äôre just being a cock
---
I'm saying that the qualifications for a viable killer are killers who can stand a chance against those teams without needing a Mori.
---
Any killer can do well against potato survivors, the measuring stick for a viable killer is how well they do against good coordinated survivors with good items.
---
And red ranks most games are against it at least decent survivors that can outplay anything clown, trapper, wraith, doctor, plague, leatherface, mike, pig, and legion bring to the table.
---
Loops take too long to get more than a few hooks in before the game is lost.
---
I don't expect survivors to play worse or handicap themselves and take it easy on bad Killers, I expect Behavior to balance bad Killers better and make them viable. I expect Behavior to fix their Maps.
---
Right now the only viable killers are spirit and nurse, any other killer will be lucky to get one kill and Five Hooks against a good Survivor team at Red ranks.
---
Shoutout to bing bong mains for being the only consistently nontoxic killer mains.
---
Sucks that the devs can't go halfway with a nerf instead of gutting a character. They could've just nerfed her add-ons and see how it goes. If things didn't change, then nerf her base mechanic. 
---
Even if she continues to be S tier, power bar makes any character less enjoyable to play as.
---
no it's pc
---
Am i one of the few people that really fucking love this? It's not like she's f tier because of it, it'll just take a lot more thinking than "lol blink at survivor"
---
Damn now I want to see art of this
---
Wrong. It lowers her skill ceiling and raises the difficulty in reaching the lowered ceiling.
---
Oh yeah then i agree with you lol i think i just misunderstood. The gorgons/dogs were definitely just there before, but then the Flayer came along and claimed them.
---
Maybe if they stopped nerfing her into the ground players wouldn't feel the need to mercilessly tunnel.
---
Yes you are the only one lol
---
wow, that's really cool man, good job
---
But wouldn‚Äôt you argue they both were mentally ill, and both decided to act on their impulses/ choose evil?
---
Nobody plays SWF. Your chances for fighting 4 of them is on the level of being hit by lightning in a field with trees and metal poles everywhere, it just won't happen. 
---
Survivors who do well can communicate with no words and coordinate as such. That's just game sense, knowledge and not grouping through SWF.
---
I mean, Freddy was literally so evil that satan (or some demons or whatever) reincarnated him to spread evil and diddle more children.
---
While Myers is evil incarnate, Freddy is literally re-incarnated evil. So they are even, but then you throw in Freddy is a diddler throws him a step above.
---
I dunno, she doesn't starve little girls to death on purpose, she wants to "save" them from the woods but since her brain age is that of a, like, 6 year old child she doesnt understand how to take care of kids. As for killing others, I thought it insinuated she ate them? Even if she didnt, wild animals of the same species fight all the time for various reasons, maybe shes just copying them because thats all she knows?
---
this new huntress rework is wild
---
Oh yea i def agree with that, But i think we should wait till the PTB/full release to complain. honestly i still think she will be top tier
---
But yea the devs really like nerfing things into the ground, they shouldnt do that honestly... other then spirit, i would love if she was made the worst killer in the game
---
Clown clearly has the most sex appeal I mean come on, he gives the greatest S U C C
---
I would say Nerfing Nurse (even though base Nurse is like 95% unaffected) is the first step to balancing the game majorly, the devs also mentioned they're looking at medkits so who knows that might mean insta heals or possibly a re-balancing to those as a whole.
---
Hypothetically lets say the Devs changed everything that needed to be changed that made rank 1 SWFs "an unstoppable powerhouse that destroys anyone not Nurse" and the game was perfectly balanced, the current Nurse we have now would have no place in that fantasy world of balance we're trying to go for and rightfully she needs to be tweaked.
---
I personally enjoy the devs in how they've been making killers lately; Legion, Plague, GhostFace, reworked Freddy, and Demogorgon were all created with the same concept in mind of stalling survivors in their own unique way as well as handling loops decently and aside from Legion I believe they have been doing a good job with it as 4/5 of those killers have potential to dominate matches but also have good enough counterplay to where it doesn't just feel like auto-lose for your average survivor.
---
people want balance and forget that killers need adjustments too, not just survivors if the game were to be balanced for everyone.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even know. But stuff like this is why I just have my messages set to friends only. Because whether you are in the right or wrong, people will always find something to complain about. Gets old real fast when playing DBD.
---
you can master nurse's ability in like 5 games lmaooooooo
---
Wasn't Freddy innocent and killed by mistake by the population? Always thought it was.
---
what was the point of no-blink nurse originally?
---
Lmao this is up there with the Demogorgan dancing.
---
Well what do you call it then
---
I was really hoping they would work on bringing killers up to the standards of the nurse. Really disheartening to see them bring down the potential power of the nurse instead.
---
Well the problem was she *did* specialize in map pressure, **and** downing people immediately. The nerf is great.
---
Everyone was talking about nurse nerf? this looks like a buff to me B) I might actually use addons on her now.
---
Play With Your Food. Teachable from Myers.
---
I would give all the swf a debuff when going in the match, like what idk...10% slower action speed? or 4% movement slow? It depends tho
---
Go read the notes. Some of her addons shange her move speed,  and give other kinds of advantages. Plus, you'll always have at least 1 blink recharged by the end of your fatigue
---
M1 nurse future main
---
i always found the nurse to be one of the easiest to go against. maybe the people i played with just sucked tho
---
I love seeing skillless LF mains get fucked out of a 4k.
---
It's super easy to do. The harder it is, the more bloodpoints you get.
---
Bottom tier should be: has a sign in their yard
---
But, while Myers is the "personification of evil" Freddy was literally raised from the dead by the most evil things in the word because he was just that evil.
---
So it really depends what you think is more evil: Evil embodying a human or a demon sent by evil itself.
---
It's different mythos so "evil" is different things in their respective worlds and it's hard to compare, but Freddy's actions put him ahead for me personally.
---
Docked mode is a mess fam
---
problem is, even killers don't want to use ruin all the time. But killers have to, else match would be over in 5 minutes. Also, huntress's lullaby is very hard to use since you need to have 5 hooks for it to reach its potential. And it's a hex perk. In a match, when you have 5 hooks, there would be 2 or 3 gens left only if the survivors are good enough and know what they were doing.
---
Google really is hard for some people
---
Thank you.
---
Oh my god someone finally gets this concept that counter-play=/=running the same perk every match because ‚Äújust n case I find prayer bead spirit or x killer that does this‚Äù I like running interesting perks and not iron will dead hard urban spine chill so that maybe I‚Äôll have a better time against x killer if I get them.
---
Thank you for saying it
---
I think you could bring Chucky to the game with Tiffany helping him. Chucky could choke/steer the survivor directing them with say a yo-yo. The hooks are lowered and Chucky steers thr survivor till they impale themselves into the hook. Then Tiffany cranks them up to the normal height. 
---
Problem solved.
---
Having a tiny killer would be terrifying. I'm all for it.
---
Chucky map would either be the good guy doll factory or the amusement park from childs play 3.
---
PLEASE use the goosebumps theme. Idk why that‚Äôs what popped into my head with it.
---
Iron will. Ever hear of it? It counters spirit pretty damn hard. Yall just a bunch of whiners.
---
I was really hoping the idea of calling a build ‚ÄúRacecar Nurse‚Äù would have been enough of an obvious meme name to actually signal ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm talking about a meme build for the sake of memeing the game‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhey this build seems viable and doesn‚Äôt at all contradict the normal playstyle of the character in a fun way like Scratched Mirror Myers or Mint Rag Hag‚Äù 
---
But thank you for reminding me that even with the heaviest sarcasm and obvious meme tag someone will have to attempt to put on their thonk cap and tell me my meme build is bad.
---
Laughts in basment Trapper!
---
He is still a psychopath.
---
Look at how he goes amount with his chainsaw.
---
That's the one thing I wish we had from PC.  I'd love post game chat.
---
Pog can be way more than average spooky
---
Appreciate it. Lol and yes I agree. I shouldn't need certain perks to play the game.
---
But it's not fun for the killer. Just like playing against nurse and spirit is not fun for the survivor. If it's not fun for 1 side, then it's probably slowly killing the game.
---
I think that they should bump her speed to 97% and reduce cooldown between blinks to 1.75s
---
Just a little idea
---
&gt;Become an undetectable 115 killer for 60 seconds
---
My bad, but the above sounds good and is powerful. I thought you misread the patch notes.
---
Unfortunately, as much as I'm a fan of this game, the results tend to speak against the Devs rather than for them. Dedicated servers got pushed back [they were worse than what we had now when they were testing them], Demogorgon got buffed for no apparent reason, they're trying to releasing a mobile version while leaving everything else in shambles, switch version is a complete disaster on release, frame rates on console hasn't been addressed yet, new Freddy re-work is completely unoriginal [stolen powers from other killers], nothing to fix DC's nor punishing people who DC, ranks still mean nothing after 3 years, it took them 3 years to make it so that you can join and leave games with your team rather than inviting them over and over, this game is 100% known for its toxicity and they've done nothing to address that, they're more concerned with pushing out skins for $$$ than anything else, hitboxes are still not correct 3 years after launch, unnecessary buffs/nerfs [pig keeps getting nerfed], this new patch seriously messed up the settings and caused a ton of havoc, reports do absolutely nothing, commends do absolutely nothing, and so on. 
---
There's literally so much more to talk about that the Devs haven't even touched on. It sucks because the Devs fix one thing, but leave other things as is. I know you can't fix everything overnight, and I'm not blaming the Devs for not fixing them sooner, but there comes a point where 'trying' simply isn't good enough anymore. A majority of my games end with the most horrific, vulgar, racist shit people can say in post-game chat. Are they trying to fix that? Are they trying to fix DC'ing? Devotion? Anything? It doesn't seem like it
---
Most of the time she isn't in my opinion though
---
Thanks I'll try that, sounds like it could definitely be part of the issue.
---
They just need to keep her base kit.
---
You can play with what you want but saying you're having fun why can't they is asking too much.  There is absolutely nothing remotely fun about versing Prayer Beads.  It is the most mindless addon for killer in the game and should have never been a thing.  Even most of the killer main streamers say the same thing about it.  Absolutely not justifying toxic post game chat or anything of the sort.  Just explaining to you that your fun will not translate to survivors when it comes to that loadout.
---
My one and only disagreement is the LOS requirement on the bookmark which would cripple her on some maps.
---
Most perks have different tiers, so you‚Äôre actually upgrading it every time it pops up.
---
That‚Äôs some really thick projection you got going on. But not every killer has map mobility to pressure multiple gens. Doing gens is pretty mind-numbingly easy and yes it‚Äôs on the killer to pressure gens, but in many often easy scenarios gens can be done very very quickly, especially for killer who need any prep time, or patrolling a large map. 
---
Like at this point, if I want to have a good game as Hag I either have to surrender 1.5 gens or start my first chase with 6+ traps in my pocket because if the map is too large I can‚Äôt go anywhere, but thank you for your commentary, my sweet summer child.
---
Pleanty of us who never use addons on nurse, some of these new addons seems interesting and will make for some great mindgames so seeing as in the nurse it self got no changes, people who never used addons in the first place will see it as a personal buff.
---
Dude, her base kit was undeniably nerfed
---
It's a meme. Just a thing people say when you wrote a lot
---
I think Myers totally embraces the "Boogeyman" archetype and didn't murder the baby in 2018 because it couldn't feel any terror before he killed it. It's more terrifying for the kid to grow up knowing it was in that situation
---
He's definitely up there with Freddy. I guess less evil cause no pedophilia, but judging from the continuity I like best (lol) which is just the original and 2018... he chose to be who he is. He wanted to be a monstrous predator that causes fear and pain from an early age and follows that goal obsessively
---
Spasmodic breath
---
Become a 115% movement speed killer with no power for 60 seconds after hitting a survivor after blinking
---
Feels good man
---
&gt;Why does bhvr have to ruin all the good things in this game
---
Nurse isn't good she is unhealthy for the game. I personally think more killers need to be buffed but Nurse has been number 1 since her release and the killer in 2nd place, no matter who they are, was always significantly behind her in terms of strength. The counterplay isn't there like there is for other killers.
---
The change isn't even as bad as people making it out to be, I think it's a good change.
---
he is an old killer and they haven't updated the dailys yet
---
Huh, I didn't actually knew that about Freddy. Pretty interesting.
---
And yeah, you raised a pretty interesting point. While both are indeed "evil" they are evil in their own accord and in their own dimension. I agree with you too that it is hard to compare things like that (like I said in my previous comment).
---
Basically, they both are evil but their evil is shown in different ways and in their own proper set.
---
Thanks for your opinion on this.
---
So again 2 perks are counterplay, if being forced to run strong perks is what you consider fun then that‚Äôs whack and you don‚Äôt play both sides
---
ok so are only the most recent level of bloodweb i am on the active perks?
---
An idea to buff rule no. 2 add-on you still can‚Äôt see jigsaw box‚Äôs when the trap is not active but when it activates you can only see jigsaw boxes in a 28 meter radius
---
I wouldnt say mindless... I definitely did not use prayer beads to their full extent when I first tried them. Over time I began to make note of how survivors react and adjust accordingly. Thanks tho. This is one of the only responses that answered my question in a way that made me understand.
---
Guys I really don't want to be this guy but if if I remember correctly, Wes Craven wanted to make Freddy Krueger a child molestor but cannon wise he ended up going with child murderer...so I wouldn't say it's right to put him as a pedophile...js
---
tbf she's not gonna really get a nerf but it's going to change it so it actually takes some skill instead of bots running 3 blink to get free 4ks because they can't catch anyone with 2
---
Till the doc daily is 30k, tho
---
Oh no. The killer that ignore walls, pallets, and windows will take 25 seconds to catch someone instead of 15. What a gutting. Unplayable, really.
---
/s if you couldn't tell.
---
To all the people saying "because it's easier to do," the doctor's daily is still 30k, and all you gotta do is hit 3 survivors with the shock therapy attack
---
We never complained \*\*She\*\* was OP
---
we complained her \*\*Add ons\*\* were OP
---
So why the hell are they touching her base kit?!?!
---
Weaker killer mains : Oh yeah, it's all coming together
---
Basically if you liked Nurse you will keep playing her no matter what, but if liked winning you're probably having a field day with PB Spirit right now
---
Nurse needed this nerf, they've been too OP since since.
---
Couldn't the Entity just boot Myers out of its realm then?
---
I don't think that the fact she does not kill them on purpose really makes things better, lol. She So mentally fucked up she barely thinks like a child. She's childish, yes, but I can't imagine six year old who thinks that chaining somebody in the basement with no food is saving them. Even the most primitive animals understand that young need to eat too. And I also don't think she ate anybody, she's just territorial as fuck. Many killers lost somebody, but I imagine her loss only pushed what was already there.
---
Against 4 stack Gen rush squads with 4 syringes on Haddonfield, yes it's pretty gutting.
---
The plague
---
The opening of the first Halloween movie is him murdering his sister as a child, which I think is comparable to the antichrist Damien growing in evil as he grows up in the Omen movies.
---
I don't think there's anything we, as a community, can do anymore. We state our complaints and what we want out of the game, and we get whatever they wanna give us
---
Cool
---
Can you explain why my comment was a yikes moment? You‚Äôre not giving me much info here.
---
Well rank 20 pigs don't know how to play so they tunnel the trapped man.
---
But know that unless you're purple ranks you know nothing about the Pig
---
Play during an event and you'll get it every single game lol but thanks for saying you only have 700hrs.
---
Didn't he killed his own father?
---
I always tried to run extra boxes, just to increase the search time and slow the game down.
---
I'm just calling the nerf on SWF. The solo queue players wouldn't have to worry about it. And if they are matched with a SWF, the communication factor of SWF is still too big.
---
The issue is I always get really unlucky and they find it on the first one
---
Problem is that with every nerf/,change to killer the hardcore top tier killers have always been like: "even if it's garbage at least I have Nurse for actually winning". Now that this massive pillar of reassurance for killers has been cracked (not broken yet) there aren't really a lot of killers nowadays you can turn to to save games outside of Spirit. If winning with the majority of the cast was consistently possible the Nurse changes wouldn't even have received more than a shrug. And for the people I'm already expecting like: Bud I made it to R1 with speed limiter Bubba no perks hurr durr" f*ck off you know that's not true. Nurse was one of the go to's when you saw that smug SWF, P3 Claudette with famous YTer names and needed a hard hitting and save killer.
---
You assume you get Nurse every game? If not why nerf her
---
But then everyone is one shot against a 115% movespeed killer.
---
Scary movie is gold
---
no, SWF is a problem. That's why high rank killers have been avoiding lobbies ever since they realize how powerful voice communication of SWF is.
---
We removed 5 AD to fix her, it's ok.
---
yeah I agree with that, I'm just proposing some ideas.
---
Victim of circumstance 
---
its all very  nuanced
---
I need to see this
---
Thats the type of addons i want instead of math addons that just adds numbers.
---
You can hear him from across the map. I'm more talking about the gameplay and not where they are from.
---
Fire Up honk honk
---
Leatherface for BBQ and Chili. It a very useful skill for its utility alone, but it also makes farming blood points for other killers easier too.
---
.....what about beans?
---
Whats worse. Killing in the spirit of Halloween spirit!
---
or Knives McPedo
---
I only saw addon changes?
---
Sure, ‚ÄúlAsT tImE I eVeR dEfeNd YoU gUyS‚Äù is super meaningful conversation.
---
Im actually gonna start playing her because of this. A lot of people dont use her because shes too strong and feels like a cheat code
---
Why we are at it remove killer ability to hit survivors wth it is so op
---
Sure, but literally until we‚Äôve tried it, appraisal is inherently incomplete and therefore drawing conclusions is useless
---
Figure it will allow you to blink though 2-3 rows of corn. It will be buggy as hell in any case as line of sight isn't exactly well done around soft cover of corn or bamboo.
---
U rite what was I thinking
---
Man its gonna be so weird seeing a nurse move as fast as an m1 killer, im excited for these
---
I played 6 surv games tonight and didn‚Äôt get any NOED. Only got two last Thursday when I played out of like 11 games

Naw, load in and DC

Then read it again.
---
Glad someone got the reference
---
And BHVR listening to crybabies from reddit yet again jesus fuck haha
---
I fucking love her aesthetic
---
*As killer*, reading comprehension is fun, yeah? I have over 1.4k in total.
---
Also, holy shit if you have more than 100 hours and are still kneejerking this hard about a change to the most broken killer in the game *that doesn't even fundamentally change her ability to ignore everything on the map* over some ridiculous Doomsday scenario I just feel embarrassed for you.
---
yeah I can understand your view, and I think having 6 gens having to be completed and 8 gens in total is a very creative idea. But that would mean they need complete map overhaul and resized, so it's not really possible.
---
But Calling someone a baby bc they're pissed at a Dev team for gutting their favorite character bc of low rank players who didn't wanna adapt is?
---
With more boxes and more traps, each down was an extra shot at it.  
---
On average, they'd spend enough time searching that you didn't need ruin.  
---
I hate RNG mechanics tho, I much prefer hard numbers
---
Have you seen what she looked like before the plague??? 10/10 would smash
---
Imagine having a quarter of my playtime trying to tell me how to play the game lol
---
That's because your ally spawned within sight of it.
---
Im surprised there was no mention of a pig nerf with the nurse changes  
---
A long list of nurse changes and at the bottom:  
---
"And oh, we reduced Pig movespeed by 5% btw"
---
Hol up there are Halloween comics? This I gotta find

Enjoy my friend.

---
Go for the basment!
---
The fact that they've changed the traps to only activate after the competition of a generator could give a massive boost to pigs viability.
---
All they'd need to do Is make her traps tick down much faster, that way getting one on your head impacts the whole team.
---
&gt;don't finish a gen to allow teammate to untrap themselves
---
&gt;do gens and potentially lose a teammate
---
My personal choice would be to give them enough time to find and use 1 - 1 1/2 boxes so that having careless team mates isn't a death sentace
---
I‚Äôm over here maining Billy and running iron will, not giving a sh*t.
---
Bless you kind Redditor
---
Unless this implies I‚Äôm eating huntress I don‚Äôt want the meal
---
But an infinite and God loop are two wholly different things in the same game. How am I being annoying when people are literally wrong as to what the new god loops are
---
Hol' up.. entity's a girl??
---
Ik I wasnt the only one thinking this!
---
nerfing SWF is a one way ticket to killing this game, fyi
---
Whats her new nerf??
---
Because you can get hatch without doing a god damn thing the whole match. It‚Äôs a little harder to get away with that and still get the gens done
---
I think that's why people are upset with these changes. Nurse is the most skill based thing in DBD, but as soon as you're good with her she will end games at 5 gens. More killers need to have the depth of practice that Nurse required. Spirit-Billy will be #1 after this nerf.
---
The torch passes onto the spirit now. In upcoming months, they‚Äôll call to nerf her.
---
Sad doc and bubba hours
---
I know right? How did he run up to a pallet and drop it on his side without getting hit? Whenever I do that and try and drop a pallet while staying on the same side I either get hit or have to completely stop to drop it
---
Remember that one time Otzdarva camped an Adam for a full minute because of this
---
Why? Just camp those type of idiots and enjoy them raging because they dont want to be bullied like they do with killers...
---
Just bring Iron Will. That‚Äôs what I do
---
My understanding is they do not increase maximum chainsaw movement speed, but rather cause him to reach that speed in a shorter amount of time during the attack
---
Is that noed? On huntress??
---
dude, ghostface and doc for sure give out full size candy bars, doc especially. he advocates for dental health.
---
Mindflayers are lawful evil, if the Demo is controlled by him it might be pure evil. Also, in d&amp;d demo is chaotic evil. Really evil.

You say that like the community is made up of one person with one opinion and that there aren't over a hundred thousand people in this sub all with different opinions, many of whom will post about their countering opinions when something happens they don't like.

I know one is in London and one is in Frankfurt, meaning the Russians will be connected mostly to Frankfurt (which is perfect for me as im living in Dusseldorf, bad for them)....right now i am aware if i‚Äôm playing with a soviet comrade because mlga indicator aint lying. i swear i was connected to a killer last night with 1780 ping...game crushed

Some movies show him sewing. Billy can sew and hunt, but mentally he is a lot like a child or a special needs kid. 
---
Been a while since I've seen the movies, but he's very naive and childlike from the ones j remember.
---
Thats exactly my point tho, what is the one single reason anyone sane would play killer over survivor? When its less fun, harder to rank up, generally just depressing. Its the one reason players have to play killer, and BHVR actually sees that for people to actually have matches they need some incentive to want to play killer
---
Iron Will is actually quite good against all killers, it really helps you to mindgame since the killer can‚Äôt hear where ur going when not in line of sight. I see more people using it nowadays and it really becoming meta
---
I'd put the leader of the Legion (Frank?) as a psychopath. The other 3 are definitely naive and misguided.
---
Why is it taking so long to find a game now? Is it because of survivor rank? Or was it due to the most recent update? My friends and I are waiting minutes only for an error to always occur and only being half of my party.
---
Need? Sorry I'm new
---
From Kazakhstan to Frankfurt ill have 100 ping, its going to be closest one to me. I hope they didnt force us to play on "asian"(South Eastern or Japan) servers with atleast 200 ping up to 400.
---
I nurse mained before I started playing clown (and I honestly probably play her more than clown to this day), but I think the changes seem fair. Is there any change to her base speed?
---
I think in the original DBD lore for Myers; he was the only being to seek out the entity and enter. Ask the others had to be courses into the Entity‚Äôs realm. 
---
He could be the only character that could leave when he wants as well; but he‚Äôs too busy having a good time. 
---
He is way past psycho, but not a pedo.
---
You don't ask for a link. You ask for [SAUCE](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557)
---
I don't get it. Was there an update nerfing Nurse?
---
The Groom from Outlast Whistleblower would be a cool killer.
---
It's for amusement of their viewers and a price for self-promotion
---
Perhaps, but when Myers actually does hook survivors, he‚Äôs a force to be reckon with. So maybe the Entity looks the others way at times since Myers has to eventually sacrifice at some point.
---
If I'm playing as Freddy, survivors in the dream world will be Oblivious, in that they will not be affected by perks that relate to them being in my terror radius
---
Does this also apply to Infectious Fright? As in, will nearby sleeping survivors scream when I down someone?
---
The Funse is unironically going to be fun to play against? WHAT?
---
Meanwhile 4DS a game are completely balanced and fair, nurse needed a small rework tho, playing nurse is mindless, you don't care about pallets, structures or loops while with other killer you need to plan each details.
---
nerfing doc would be like nerfing wraith
---
Most killers can do well with bbq and ruin tbh
---
Imo the worst thing about Spirit is her having collision with survivors while phasing.  
---
  
---
Aside from having to base the entire counterplay as Survivor on her being fucking stupid.
---
*uses perks and items for their intended use*
---
Toxic survivors always bullying helpless killers!!!!!@#$
---
I think she needs some milk..
---
But, unlike Freddy rework, it's essentially the same power, just on a bigger cooldown.
---
Well does he????
---
You had to be on the right tiles for that. Overall I agree and I loved competing with nurses on certain tiles, but some of them are just impossible to win on.
---
It's impossible to determine her exact age.  Devs haven't done enough lore about it yet.  
---
All we know is she takes the memories of survivors and killers alike to construct twisted realms based on the locales they once knew in life.  And the killers that don't go along with her demands are tortured and brutalized until they become complacent enough to do her bidding.  
---
Maybe Archives can shed some light on this but for now I've just assumed she's always existed since time immemorial.
---
Shredded and literally shredded. Interesting.
---
I just block random messages now, and play however I like. Much more fun.
---
I saw someone's concept a long while ago, but now I just want the Scooby Gang
---
Reliable? An M1 killer with absolutely no power seems like the opposite.
---
I can't, actually, not any official statement that relates to dedicated servers. There are promises of improving the temp ban system that is already in the game, but i can't find a statement about dedicated servers and disconnect penalties.
---
It also makes no sense, you can't tell whether a player disconnected on purpose by pulling the ethernet plug or killing the game process. And if using the "leave match" button is a bannable offense, they why would they keep it in? Sure, leaving every other match is bad sportsmanship, but your dog may need extinguishing that one time.
---
Both are good killers. I would choose Freddy if I don't feel like stalking and want to move from gen to gen. I use Ash as a survivor, however, I dont use any of his perks, so it's basically just a skin for me. Detective Tapp has some good perks I including stake out which can be used to counter a gen hex.
---
Freddy and Michael are both good. Personally I prefer Freddy in his current state. Michael is just fun to play though. Both have decent perks.
---
Ash has no good perks anymore since the MoM nerf so hes only worth if for the skin/voice lines.
---
I'd stick with your Meg/Tapp if I were you.
---
The devs giveth and the devs taketh away a moment of silence
---
If you think that Nurse and Spirit are the ONLY viable R1 killers then I got some bad news for you, son;
---
You're not that good at killer.
---
Which shouldn't be a thing. Freddy now doesn't necessarily need his power to win. With Nurse is is literally impossible to win without your power. You NEED to blink to get hits and secure downs. 
---
Her power is NOT a luxury, it is a necessity. And BHVR is treating it like a Luxury.
---
Ash is really loud, so unless you‚Äôre gonna use him just to use him maybe stick with the others. Over Freddy and Mikey... Freddy is strong af in his current state, but Myers is also.. well Myers. I‚Äôd say get both but if you had to pick, Freddy first.
---
And they call survivors entitled lol
---
So funny seeing them cry like I did when they nerfed mettle of man and removed the wake up bug
---
PTB is for bugs not for balancing, these nerfs are cemented.
---
More like, "and you hear a totem being cleansed."
---
The cleansing sounds carry far. It sounds like it is going on right next to me.
---
Gimme a second - gonna spit
---
I was with you until "Prayer beads are fine"
---
Haha, I thank you for that my friend!
---
Personally, I think they should just disable chat, as the community obviously can't handle it. Why would they allow someone who disconnected to speak their mind? They're obviously going to send you slurs. Sorry it happened to you.
---
That's your opinion on what makes a killer viable. 
---
For me, viable killers are those I can play and have fun with. Where I usually get 1 or 2 kills a game on average. Rarely whiff a full game, and ocassionally stomp a few 4-mans to the ground. 
---
Playing like this, I rarely get a game less than 20,000 base bp. I love dbd.
---
Wait what movies? This isnt leatherface if thats what youre thinking
---
Haha I wasnt sure if she was an ugly 20 year old or a 40 year old who never grew up
---
Seriously. This man makes like an hour long video everyday
---
Spirit is fine if they just remove collision during phasing and delete anal beads, imo.
---
I got a date with the spirit from using scoops ahoy
---
8 am in the morning i dont blame you. Unless your in america
---
Yeah, but only bad survivors mend into self care.
---
As they shouldnt the game is so broken the killer should be the power role and has NO POWER
---
In America, 1 AM here. Gotta get up in 5 hours lol
---
There is no way to implement this without it being problematic in one way or another.
---
Then again, they did just slap Oblivious onto Sleep for no reason at all, so what do I know.
---
I was waiting for this. Thanks Bhvr you cured my dbd addiction and i can finally uninstall this game.
---
pretty much the forums right now
---
Viable means they are usable at a competitive level of play. Not they're fun to play sometimes.
---
The entity said it‚Äôs my turn to use the Brain Cell
---
GG
---
Git gud
---
I had a .ttv Tapp one game as Hag. I never hooked him for the third time and just slugged him while chasing his other teammates. He DC'D after the 6th slug.
---
No bill and borrowed time?
---
Yeah they should just keep nurse being broken asf.
---
Maybe not if you want BP over ranks.
---
I am Nurse main from the beginnings of her time here.
---
Finally, they added cooldown to her power - it was such BS so I started to handicap myself (not using power for the map pressure, limit the period between blinks, etc.)
---
She hasn't lost power to end chases quickly, BUT she lost the power to kill everyone within a minute - 6 second CD will reduce her pressure considerably.
---
For the addons - well, meh. I still see no use for them. Ultrarares - what are these, lol. Not being able to jump behind a rock or autohaven's "walls" is just a good as speed limiter for chainsaws, lmao.
---
This is why I play wraith. Behavior doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about him so I don‚Äôt have to worry about nerfs.
---
Why are you turning this change into a survivor vs killer issue? This rework is helping people actually have fun going against the nurse and also gives the nurse very different play style depending on the add-on. They also changed stuff too for survivors FYI. Play the PTB first before you get mad over changes you don‚Äôt have experience with.
---
I worked hard for legacy nurse. It would be a shame if I can't show her off anymore. :(
---
I remember playing after the nerd and not knowing about it. Peeled around a window with my shield up and having it shredded almost immediately. That was a confusing and short match.
---
It's just a philosiphy they have for their game. Not really any other reason, just they don't want to. 
---
Not out of laziness or anything, but they don't want voice comms to be "forced" or such.
---
You forgot we have seen how Freddy socialize with other killers.
---
Nurses on purple/red ranks won't get affected by that nerf (they blink too good), and I barely see nurse on green ranks so 1/2 is always a tie for spirit/nurse.  
---
3 &amp; 4 - to Pig/Ghostface. Still hate it when they sneak up on me. Pig's RNG on trapbox also got me killed for a couple of games now so I'm starting to believe I'm cursed when I get her as the killer.   
---
But Myers... Oh man. He's either a 1 or a 17.
---
Dwight, Meg, and...... ???
---
WHAT THE REWORKING NURSE
---
Her add ons are getting changed and tested in the PTB tomorrow they actually look cool in my opinion
---
I really like the "sealed" lips if you get what I mean, would love if a killer would to have that
---
Tp?
---
Looks like someone hasnt been decisive striked 4 times, Prove Thyself full toolbox genrushed, Full Borrowed Time endgame hooksaved, nor been hit by Usyllis Balanced Landing Tech on farm! Trust me dude... Survivors can be some mean SOB's!
---
This statement is the byproduct of someone that has absolutely no clue what they are doing playing killer.  You need some YouTube killer vids in your life stat.  Plenty out there that can help anyone learn to play the role optimally.  I'd recommend NotOtzdarva and Truetalent personally.  They can knock the baby off any killer if they're willing to watch and learn from them.
---
Get ready to be downvoted to death.
---
You're forgetting about the occasional miss and dead hard. Which adds 10 seconds per attempt. Which is an 8th of 3 gens each time against an optimal team.
---
I don‚Äôt think those changes were that bad I mean the base power changed but I think they can adapt.
---
Pls dont tell me she's old. She's my main. I cant force a old woman run a killer for 5 gens üò¢
---
Shit man. I just like talking LOL. 
---
But yeah, I like this viewpoint too.
---
This is so true
---
I mean.. is this good tho? does that mean we are going to see more spirits?
---
If you look, you can see that he stops for a fraction of a second in order to drop the pallet. As for how he didn‚Äôt get hit, Bubba‚Äôs chainsaw was revved, and it‚Äôs only safe to let go of m2 when you know you‚Äôre about to hit a survivor, or if you‚Äôre canceling the attack. Quentin didn‚Äôt give Bubba enough time to react and hit him with the chainsaw so he dropped the pallet and got the stun.
---
Nurse is the only high skill ceiling thing in this goof off game. Try playing nurse in red ranks without dedicating time to her
---
Well..."just adapt"
---
Tiredasfbydaylight
---
Bro chill it aint even out yet
---
She is ugly, but she is in her 20's.
---
I mean.. the only thing I would change to spirit is make her woosh sound slightly louder for herself. That's it, so she has to predict more based on scratched marks
---
To me she's fine but that change would make less people cry about her. Idk.. people started crying about her recently while she was untouched after one month after release
---
Do you know where you can read the changes? I‚Äôve toyed around with nurse a few times and found her very enjoyable
---
Teleporting
---
Survivor equivalent has multiple requirements? You just have to unhook people OR take hits, you get rewarded for HELPING, just as you get rewarded as killer for KILLING.
---
Feel like a gotta defend Mr Rogers here. He only touched kids in the remake. He normally just murders them.
---
I‚Äôm learning digital drawing, but I‚Äôm not good at all... I can try to make this drawing digital tho, but I can‚Äôt promise anything
---
Wrong, that would be Bubba's speed limiter because you can't even use your chainsaw for mobility now, it's just a worse M1 you have to  charge for 6 seconds.
---
Power levels over 9000 if on L√©ry's
---
Lol nurse is still the best killer in the game.
---
Spirit isn't even 2 at base lmao.
---
Suppose it's good for dailies, too.
---
I'll be getting gud at a different game now. Bhvr only cares about survivors at this point
---
You can 360 with a controller and running backwards is way way easier.
---
getting chased by the chainsaw of bubba is kinda spooky tbh
---
Well we know Justin Trudeau is a bubba main then.
---
Pig isn't a psychopath? Or misguided?
---
Teleport homie
---
Basekit Nurse is fine. Just get rid of her add ons. She doesn't need em.
---
Why u do trapper like that :( he is innocent
---
That's called Dead
---
Doesn't bubba keep swinging after landing a hit, though?
---
I‚Äôm not used to colorize my drawings, but I‚Äôll try to make this drawing in digital so maybe I‚Äôll colorize it, you‚Äôll never know
---
Legion was nerfed into the ground without changing their base power. It is basically the same tweak, but it's only made it easier to play against what is still the worst (boring imo) killer in the game.
---
As a survivor, "Great, I'm gonna spend 5min just mending."
---
As legion, "At least this daily is a cake walk."
---
I don't have any concrete suggestions for legion, I just think if they can be made *even worse*, then the nurse can be tweaked to be a noticeably worse killer.
---
Teleporting (or just blinking). It‚Äôs actually quite a tilting experience when you blink in place and lose a shit ton of distance lol. 
---
My muscle memory w her is pretty good n I don‚Äôt know why it happens so much more than I‚Äôd like to now.
---
Freddy Mains: ‚ÄúFirst time?‚Äù
---
Does anyone know what the Med Kit changes are bringing to the table? I can't find anything on it from the dev's.
---
\&gt;"missed the point of the campaign"  
---
It was a shit campaign that missed the point of being punk. It was a shit campaign that used shit examples.  
---
\&gt;"then got mad"  
---
Nah, not mad. I'm actually glad I struck a nerve. Angering people is a good way to test their ability to question themselves.
---
Damn straight
---
Does she though ü§îü§îü§îü§î she is literally being controlled.
---
Not exactly sure what you mean, but if you buy a perk from the bloodweb, it'll be available to you on that character forever unless you prestige the character.
---
If you buy Lightweight in your first bloodweb, and see it again a few webs later, the more recent one will have slightly better stats. If you buy the more recent one, you'll always have those slightly better stats available (again, unless you prestige your character). As another person mentioned, there are three tiers to each perk, so you may see each perk up to three times in the bloodweb.
---
If this doesn't answer the question, let me know and I'll try to clear things up.
---
Otz we know it's you. Or not. Maybe just a fan.
---
ü§î
---
When demogorgon couldn‚Äôt even break pallets with a shred, people didn‚Äôt care. Just another killer to chuck down to a shit level, yet soon as nurse gets touched they‚Äôre crying, 3 second charge that starts soon as blink fatigue, that‚Äôs not bad, stops multiple blink nurses from being insane
---
You know she can't see you while phase walking and can't see blood right?
---
You talk about how she gives no information without taking into consideration how much information she don't have.
---
I mean.. there's a reason why nobody even mentioned her to be good until recently, when people started to get good with her. One month after her lunch was the last time they patched her phasing making her woosh not directional. That's it
---
Any good survivor that run iron will (that works with every killer to lose them, mind you) have no problem with her. Before saying " I shouldn't use a perk to counter her ", one, that perk counter several killers, nurse included. Second, many killers HAVE to bring specific perks to even be viable.. so..
---
You're fucking stupid
---
Copy paste from- [DoctorBowser](https://www.reddit.com/user/DoctorBowser/)
---
1 blink = 2 second fatigue, + 0.5 for a second blink, and 1 second for a missed attack. That's 3.5 seconds, meaning you'll already have your first blink up by the end of fatigue with the next being 2.5 seconds out. If you don't swing, it's still 0.5 and 3.5 seconds of waiting for both blinks to be ready. We'll have to see if the second blink will come up while just holding the first. Either way, it's not as big as people are making out to be. It seriously isn't.
---
And now you can use addons on Nurse without feeling like a complete scumbag. This removed all the broken things like 3 to 5 blinks (3 blinks now makes it so you can't blink through walls) and the range addons, leaving mostly just gimmicky or generally useful addons (and junk ultras like most killers). I'm looking forward to this
---
Idk what killers you‚Äôre getting but I usually die before I can find out if the killer is using NOED.
---
it makes it unavailable for 3 minutes i believe
---
r/upvoteroulette
---
I feel this. 500+ hours. Peaked at rank 9 killer, 12 survivor.
---
I feel like those two perks are a must. The time it takes to smack a gen is enough to lose any survivor worth their swf salt.
---
That being said, if a killer *"needs"* those perks to be viable, are they really viable?
---
I don't consider them that, especially since one perk is locked behind a paywall, and the other has to be grinded if you don't wanna pay. Or wait for the shrine to maybe help you out, ofc, but I wouldn't depend too much on that.
---
I do think nurse, spirit, and Billy are the only killers capable of safety pipping with no loadouts against the red ranks, but I haven't been a red rank killer in a few months, so I'm not sure now.
---
I don't think anyone disagree with that tbh. But, iron will doesn't counter just her but any killer with headphones giving less information to any killer, even against nurse and Billy works great
---
Before saying it's not okay to use a specific perk to counter like, almost every killer who can hear you, I'd like to make you consider that many killers have to run specific perks just to be viable.
---
As many people said when infinities were more prevalent, when old ds was a thing and so on.. adapt.
---
No, what does tp mean? Surely not toilet paper here lol
---
Oh gotcha
---
She does, because it happens in game. 
---
The Entity has been known to torture people into submission, but we don't see many signs of that. Meanwhile Trapper has mental spikes driven through his shoulder.
---
Yeah he's giving them a special kind of candy ;)
---
I approve of bubba blackface
---
_Megalovania theme starts playing_
---
Yeah...
---
*Finally* she requires skill...
---
#Dailies over daisies
---
It was honestly fucking ridiculous she broke the game for such a long time. Having clunky as fuck controls only works as a balancing tool until people get around your shitty controls, at which point she isn't balanced anymore.
---
If I may..
---
Add more time holding a button to do gens is a bad idea and boring as hell. Instead a secondary objective, kinda like dull totems are, would be better.
---
I don't know, maybe take an item that's located in point A to be transported to point B would be fine or something like that. Something more thrilling than holding a button since the gens are done way too fast rn and would be fun for both having something else to take into consideration too
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try it advice on best add ons
---
Very nice! Beautiful for a quick drawing.
---
I know right, How the fuck does my 1 GB of graphics memory bootcamp imac that crashes if I have chrome and dbd open stay dead silent running the game, but my xbox one sounds like it‚Äôs me in 4th grade trying to run the mile
---
It would help if they had a lot more story in between everything. I just kinda assume that the entity being what seems like almost omnipotent has more ways to corrupt then just torture.
---
There is an ultra-rare that makes her into an M1 killer. She loses one blink and has an increased speed of 4.6m/s
---
Sounds great advice on add ons?
---
2.5 sec fatigue vs 3 sec CD for each charge, if one blinks optimally they'll run out of charges. Of course we'll need to see how many charges she gets and if there's any additional conditions to her ability recharging. Still, quite an interesting rework considering she already has fatigue mechanic so this is just double dipping with an annoying mechanic...
---
As for add ons. I'm all in for just outright removing all of em. Nurse never needed the range or extra blinks.
---
Tbh, I think the changes would be a lot better with a simple line in the Changelog: 
---
‚Ä¢ Changed movement speed to (at least) Huntress' Speed
---
But nope! Cant wait for survivors bullying the nurse... the fucking nurse!
---
I cannot tell you how many 4 mans I've beaten over the years and I sure as shit am no god at this game.  They have an undeniable advantage with the constant communication no doubt but this does not make them invincible.  This mindset of yours is why you lose and will continue to lose every game against them before the game even loads in.  You're already conceding the game as unwinnable from the jump.  It is very rare where you will encounter a true depip squad of 4 insanely strong loopers.  There are typically multiple weak links.  They also tend to play insanely over altruistic and this often works to their detriment.  It sounds like you simply don't enjoy playing the game period but if you think you want to continue playing killer I would strongly recommend both of the YouTube channels mentioned.  Everything I learned about playing killer well came from those channels.  They really will help you out if you decide you're interested in learning and improving your play.
---
I honestly think doctor is a worse person than trapper and clown, i don't think he even had a reason to be evil, he just decided to be that way (same with ghostface, honestly).
---
Don‚Äôt listen to anyone else, buy the Halloween chapter (including Laurie Strode)
---
You don‚Äôt only get one of the most important survivor perks in the game (especially at your rank) Decisive Strike..
---
But you also get the single-handedly most loved killer in the game according to community statistics.
---
Myers is appreciated by both killer mains and survivor mains, and personally I love playing him whenever I feel like playing killer. His power is interesting and he has the most unique add-ons that will tremendously change his playstyle based on what you pick.
---
as an M1 killer I recommend combining the perks Enduring and Spirit fury/Bamboozle.
---
And BBQ and chili of course.
---
Freddy is stronger than Myers but he gets boring real fast. (I used to be a freddy main before his rework), and he has some very boring add-ons too.
---
Not to mention he‚Äôs uninteresting to play against too. (Requires minimal dedication to master)
---
Bruh Moment
---
I‚Äôm actually interested to see how Nurse plays now, Jenner‚Äôs Last Breath seems promising for mind games.
---
4.2*
---
Legion I gotta disagree on slightly, Susie was misguided. Frank was a psycho, so was July and they enjoyed it. Joey was just a tag along, he was their mate but wasn‚Äôt ever as bad as the July or Frank.
---
Her base power now has a charge system similiar to other killers. She gains one charge (blink) every 3seconds beginning with the fatique time.
---
Basically her map pressure got hit. Good nurses able to down people with 2 blinks will still stay fairly strong in chases.
---
*All low tier killers start default dancing on Nurse's motionless body*
---
We're all 
---
C l o w n s  xd
---
The rift and archives that they announced in the 3rd Anniversary stream. Should be coming to the PTB out later today.
---
It‚Äôs not that. It‚Äôs that he dishes all he wants but can‚Äôt take any form of criticism or backlash he faces from his often times frankly offensive statements. He bans people left and right if they don‚Äôt share an opinion with him, gets incredivly competitive and complains a lot about unnecessary stuff just to have an excuse as to why he‚Äôs losing.
---
I'm gonna level with you chief, everyone was expecting her addons to get touched.
---
Anyone saying these "small changes" to her base kit are fine are basically people who just want to bully Leatherfaces all day long and not have a challenging match.
---
Man I am gonna miss 5 blink deerstalker nurse with game offering
---
very informative suggestion.
---
This thread isnt about complaining and suggesting balance changes
---
Yo same im a rank 10 killer and i run legion for fun and every single time i drop a low kill count they send something saying im bad
---
What med kit changes?
---
Leatherface is #1 on my list with Spirit
---
I mean Leatherface is a fucking giant in-game and he can become nightmare fuel with 3 stacks of PWYF
---
Probably not
---
But then one person is behind you and breaks Night Shroud
---
They said all killers should have 4 commons, 5 uncommons, 5 rares, 4 very rares, and 2 ulrtas. Does that mean we should expect some Billy and leatherface addon changes?
---
Pfffft.
---
You either don't play the game or are blatantly lying. A crushing majority of survivors play in at least  a two person party.
---
NOED + Blood Warden
---
It‚Äôs such a relief

Not sure about the Xbox One, but the PS4 usually turns into a jet engine because the power supply gets really dusty. It isn't easy to get to for most people either. 
---
A lot think that it's the main cooling fan making the noise, but it isn't. After disassembling my PS4 and using compressed air to clean the power supply it's nearly silent. Doing the same to just the main fan made no noticeable change.
---
Pretty sure that The Clown is a nonce.
---
I like playing the victims, they destroy, HARD.
---
Yeah you just have to worry about being bullied by decent survivors lol
---
I would have to guess a Billy or Huntress.  
---
Maybe a Bubba did as well, but boy howdy would that be an embarrassing thing to admit on fhu's end.
---
Me:Reeeeeeeee
---
Clown technically has no power unless he uses add ons. Throwing a bottle slows him by the exact amount it slows survivors, for the same duration. And the add on's aren't so great.
---
I made by myself
---
Im looking forward to that new add on where it makes you tracer. It sounds like alot of fun
---
...wow, nea=entiti...*clap*...*clap* ...*clap*

No. Bad redditor. Nurse dead, it's what the hivemind says. You're not allowed to disagree.
---
&gt; everyone loves to bitch before they've even seen anything, literally read some text and start crying that nurse is dead
---
Welcome to reddit
---
A killer that blends in is useless against SWF or people that remember what their teammates look like or know where they are at all times
---
/ba dum tss/
---
I haven‚Äôt suggested a single thing in my post.  
---
I‚Äôm asking questions
---
I think that might be interesting, I definnitly see how it is a nerf. I usally skip the first par of patch notes because it's usally just bs about we listened to the comunity, hope these are good changes ect.
---
then the actuall changes are listed.
---
Darn tooten Bhavior making my lazy buttballs read text.
---
If it was just for me I won't change her either. Maybe the breads since people cry a lot about it but they don't take into consideration that is rare like bnp is.. but ok..
---
I use Iron Will because it‚Äôs amazing and I feel confident doing gens or whatever injured because of it. It‚Äôs really just an epic moment when I‚Äôm playing against a spirit.  Though I main Jane which feels needed,  iron will can make some great plays
---
I would be cucked out of my healing dailies if the entity would stop sucking them up and replacing them with hit survivors with surpise bell attacks
---
Nurse just got nerf?
---
You're probably right
---
First off, I'd recommend switching out one of your Exhaustion perks. I'd stick with Balanced Landing over Sprint Burst, but if you like to have the ability to quickly run away, maybe SB is preferred. You could use a perk like Spine Chill to give you an early warning when the killer is approaching, and then use Urban Evasion to sneak away.
---
Jeff might have the strongest perks of the 4 survivors, and the ones that suit you best.
---
Aftercare lets you see up to three other survivors who you've healed/unhooked, or who have healed/unhooked you. There's no distance range on the perk, so it's extremely strong in that respect, where other team aura perks all have effective ranges on them. If you are interacting with teammates often, it might be helpful to you.
---
Distortion is also a decent perk. It hides your aura from the killer the first three 3 times they would normally see it. If they have no aura reading perks, it ends up being a wasted perk, but a lot of killers run some kind of aura reading perks. Keep in mind that some killers may have perks or add ons that allow them to see your aura often, so the 3 instances may get used up very quickly.
---
Jane has a couple perks that may interest you as well. Poised hides your scratch marks for up to 10 seconds after a generator has been completed. You don't have to have touched the gen itself for the perk to work.
---
The other perk of hers is Solidarity. This one heals you up to 50% while you heal someone else.
---
Kate's perk Dance with Me is probably her most popular, but it's only really used for stealth builds. It hides scratch marks for number of seconds after performing a vault or leaving a locker quickly. It's often used with Lithe, Lightweight, and Quick and Quiet.
---
She also has a perk called Windows of Opportunity. This perk is pretty good for anyone learning how to plan their pathing through the map when being chased by the killer. It highlights all pallets and vaults within a certain radius. This probably isn't a perk that people run long term, but it's a good perk for people who want to improve the chase aspect of their game.
---
Kate's perks aren't regarded as being very strong. I'm a Kate main, and have rarely used any of them.
---
Adam has the best single perk of the four in my opinion, but it's just something I enjoy using. Deliverance allows you to unhook yourself if you perform a safe unhook on someone else before you get hooked. You'll be in the broken state for a bit afterwards (which means you can be healed for a while), but it's a great perk to split the killer's pressure on the map, and give your team more time to work on gens instead of coming in for the unhook. Note that if you don't get an unhook before you get hooked, the perk is completely useless, so use at your own risk.
---
Hopefully some of this is helpful for you. Good luck with your decision!
---
You're one of those lol...Doesnt taste so good when someone play like you, right?
---
*coughs* dbd forums
---
Ash and his perks are terribly useless.  Only buy him if you just legit love Bruce Campbell and wish to play as him in game.  This is a legit reason to still buy him if you choose.  The man is a legend bad perks or not.
---
Between the two killers they are both good and fun but if you want the strongest killer possible Freddy is legit unbelievably strong now.  Like bring him in against red rank swf's strong.  If you do pick him up I'll tell you that between the Dream Pallets and Snares the Pallets are more fun to use but the Snares are absolutely stronger.  They do work for you midchase and are quick and easy to set mid loop.
---
I wasn't replying to OP.
---
How exactly would Tommy's shotgun work? Would you be able to stun the killer, kill them, send them flying back a few feet...?
---
I agree with the add on change. I was hoping for some other things but I'm fine with what they had. I would've preferred no range add ons.
---
But I truly do think that the blink cool down will be the death of nurse.
---
She's slower than survivors so the distance they'll get every time will be insane.
---
We'll probably only see Spirit now after the changes they made to the nurse (I don't play Nurse at all. Just never liked her)
---
Urban evaded half way there and then sandbagged Dwight. I screamed too
---
 *"all killers should have 4 common, 5 uncommon, 5 rare, 4 very rare and 2¬†ultra rare¬†add-ons"*  
---
So are we getting two ultra rares for the chainsaw boys, and an additional ultra rare for doctor and huntress?
---
Spirit just looking at the sword: How did you get my katana????
---
Nurse: ¬∞-¬∞
---
Yeah dude. Believe it or not, I don‚Äôt base my opinions around the insistence of someone online.
---
What kind of benefits would we see in a DBD battle pass? I already bought almost every character :(
---
The deeper meaning behind this is that dbd becomes a still image with how the new event will fuck up my damn framerate
---
Ah shit, I didn't finish writing that one. One sec, I'll edit it.
---
That's because Nurse is the hardest killer to master in the game, but then you go against one P3 Nurse who predicts your every move and it's gg. Spirit is a high reward killer for little effort, but it's not hard to trick her when she's phasing so ot can be used to loose their time, after getting the hang of that it's just to be careful with spirits who fake it. Now an insta saw P3 Billy is scary af XD
---
Thanks
---
&gt;It isn't balance when one killer requires survivors to run a specific perk to have a legit chance against them at red ranks though.  I get that Iron Will is a nice perk and used to use it before I learned how to run a killer but it doesn't seem healthy to basically be required to run it either.  
---
&gt;
---
I also strongly disagree with killers needing to run specific perks to be viable.  Specific killers can shine with certain loadouts no doubt but ultimately there has never been more diversity in what perks you can run playing killer and still perform well. 
---
Disagree. Isn't to shine, it's to be viable or playable. Iron will would counter tons of people, like anyone who uses headphones, to juke them
---
Whatever, your opinion.. a wrong one since there's a reason you won't face wraith at rank 1 if not when planets are aligned..
---
Oh. Just read the changes.
---
They are horrible.
---
If the nurse didnt feel shitty enough to play already she def is gonna be now.
---
Seems like the killer from Alice Sweet alice.
---
I must disagree with billy. He litterly has a grilled cow leg and a grilled face as a cosmetic. I fell He could deliver some mean meat on the table.
---
Nurse... brain dead easy?
---
He has a lot of knowledge for someone who's been in an institute since he was six. He can start and drive a car and knows how a rifle works
---
I‚Äôm Claude and I must be doing gen
---
I get your reaction, because you really think camping is a tactic. I just do gens on other side of the map np. How to know if you run into one semi pro camper? Just try to unhook, if he is there and chases you, run away from the hook. If the chase is over after .5 secs, you found one xD
---
&gt;Nurse is the most skill based thing in DBD
---
I highly disagree.  One you master the muscle memory of blinks, looking somewhere and instantly being there isn‚Äôt at all skillful.  She doesn‚Äôt even use mind games, it‚Äôs just seeing how survivors play by doubling back, etc., and getting ahead of them.  M1 killers take much more skill than her.  Nurse just becomes insanely broken with skill, that‚Äôs the only difference.
---
This exactly , we need statistics more often from devs so we can say yes the survival rate is under 50%
---
Does sound pretty fun
---
I used to be a Spirit main and posted a response to a topic asking for help against Spirit. I mostly play survivor now, and play in purple and red ranks. Hopefully something in my response will help you out:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5jbgp/advanced_tactics_to_counter_spirit
---
Huntress is a hunter, she prepares a variety of meat. She just has an infatuation to killing people and stealing little girls because she has fucking childhood trauma, but sense she wasn't risen up to a point to realize that kids need to be fed, she just watches the girls die.
---
.....Plague's a mess so yeah. She was very humble when she wasn't infected, so she prob cooked for herself, but now that she is.....puke is the main course.
---
Nurse has more problems than her addons.  This shouldn‚Äôt even be controversial.
---
Bruh you literally think that someone who has the nickname ‚Äúvommy mommy‚Äù would make good food compared to the clowns mori nicknamed ‚Äúfinger licking good‚Äù
---
Me neither, I just don't cover my eyes and pretend in depth information doesn't exist.
---
The devs announced today that there would be med kit changes in the PTB starting Tuesday.
---
Looks like this thread has reached it's natural conclusion.  2/3rd's of it is just you parroting my words back to me and the final 1/3rd is you just telling me I'm wrong with no real reason provided.  Also as someone that's played tons of Rank 1 Wraith games over the years we will definitely have to disagree.  I must be the one player capable of realigning the galaxies?
---
You know sometimes it helps to take an intelligent assessment of a situation and realize when people are just acknowledging a fact rather than just being a "hive mind of drones"
---
But sure, reeeeeeeeeeeeeee nurse dead hurr durr
---
‚Äúlow rank players who didn‚Äôt wanna adapt‚Äù literally the only people I‚Äôve come into contact who understand the necessity of a Nurse nerf for the health of the game have thousands of hours and are consistently red rank, many killer mains.
---
You‚Äôre deeply out of touch if you believe your characterization.
---
You should make also the comics and not just the covers
---
The addon changes are, her base kit changes I don't agree with that at all.
---
This is the most badass lore of the entire game. Fuck I love the Myers-Entity relationship.
---
... You're a monster
---
I'm not feelin it
---
So it's all speculation then, tomorrow cant come soon enough lol
---
Congrats!
---
I think the skulls you are seeing are  on the prestige level indicator. Prestige 1 just has a roman numeral I, prestige 2 has II, and prestige 3 has III with a skull in front of it.
---
If that's not what you're seeing let me know, and I'll have another look.
---
I'm sad there's no piggy door
---
Every person save for a few that says "she isn't dead, these changes are good" is getting downvoted...
---
Wraith: (violently flossing on nurses corpse)
---
I thought it was only for hooks
---
Imagine being this sad
---
fr?  It‚Äôs either you don‚Äôt use iron will and you‚Äôre downed if they aren‚Äôt deaf, or you do but are revealed by her bodyblocking/grass/cornstalks or bloodlusted.  She really does not have any real counterplay unless the Spirit is deaf.
---
Meg is a bit of a screamer too.
---
Me and my friend got destroyed by a mirror myers on thompson house. Might've been mostly because the two randoms got downed in the house and my friend went in after them.
---
You have to get each perk 3 times to get its full effect
---
also, something you might need
---
Each character has their own 3 perks. Once you level them up to lvl 30, 35, 40 you get an option of unlocking it for other characters. It means they will be added to the **bloodweb pool** of others for you to get
---
Mate I think you got a little confused
---
Good. About time that broken ass killer got brought down a few notches.
---
Docco is niceo
---
Please explain what is being handed to survivors.
---
Thanks! With good headphones this is god tier perk for Spirit as i see
---
No... stop this
---
Bubba starts at 85% speed when he chainsaws and slowly accelerates to full speed over its duration
---
They make you reach the max speed quicker
---
Always add a movement speed when chainsawing add-on to them if you want to get the most out of them
---
Any if you play them smart enough.
---
I'm all for ptbing changes but I think it's important to voice our opinions clearly before we are stuck with something for another 3yrs. I respect your optimism for sure but I've spent a looooooooot of time learning nurse over the years and I play her addonless, and I'm confident in my opinion. Dead hards hurt enough already against her specifically now every dead hard is effectively an 8th of a gen for 3 gens against an optimal team. That's major painful to press space and just get that much progress for free.
---
Nice suggestion. Really insightful, thanks for making this very unique post.
---
It now takes some time for her full set of blinks to recharge. 3s per blink.
---
you forgot to add exhaustion addons and pinky finger
---
I dont see why a nurse needs to run an endgame build.
---
Also wtf save the best for last is awful on nurse
---
You can read each characters BIO and some stories in game. You can also find it on the Wiki
---
We'll also get some more lore-drops shortly
---
This bug is great when it happens to gens. 
---
They turn into a bright yellow/gold if they are finished.
---
If you stare into it, it feels like your are looking at the sun.
---
What I‚Äôm hoping is he following:
---
No collisions while fading 
---
Removing anal beads 
---
Making it so the phase sound is directional (like the PTB). This will make higher players be able to track the spirit in phase, while not really effecting her at lower ranks.
---
It's not nonsense, it's how every online game is tiered and balanced. 
---
DBD have tried balancing the game around casuals and average ranks and what we got was the Freddy nerf. It doesn't work. You cannot balance a game around players who do not fully understand the game mechanics, let alone the meta. Average statistics without a competitive mode mean nothing and the devs will not balance around them.
---
Additionally, the stats quoted were even more erroneous than that, since they were based on one players experience at unspecified ranks.
---
Why is everyone in the comments roasting you for using urban evasion
---
A killer who‚Äôs almost guaranteed a 4k like Nurse if they‚Äôre half decent 100% doesn‚Äôt just deserve a nerf, a nerf is necessary, 
---
And no, more than 3 killers are viable at high ranks.  How are there so many people who just want be handed kills on a silver platter who won‚Äôt take the time playing top tier killers like Hag and Freddy so obnoxiously out of touch with the game‚Äôs balance?
---
She needs to be nerfed so good thing its happening
---
Nope.
---
almost every DLC has shit perks for survivors anyway
---
Huntress on any outdooor map is viable too.
---
"Rework Freddy" "OMG Freddy OP!" "Dedicated Servers broken Devs!!" "Devs why you delay dedicated servers?" "Nurse rework now!" "Why did you rework Nurse?"
---
We can only hope. I don't mind that she's strong, but vsing her is genuinely frustrating for me...someone who's been playing since console launch.
---
He's like a walking ballsack flower with teeth
---
I feel bad every time, when i get a free hit only because i have bloodlust on badham, it really need to be removed in this partucular map(because its balanced for regular chase, not bloodlust).
---
So yeah, as a killer main i can say rEmOvE BlOoDlUsT on revorked maps.
---
You can't know for certain if the nerds are too much until the PTB releases, and even then you should probably give it a week before making such damning judgements.
---
It is, the sub is just being flooded by people mad they won‚Äôt get endless free kills with Nurse anymore.
---
No.
---
Got Merciless with Pig twice in a row when I was trying it out... Sadly she was only lvl 5. It's not that bad if you are not at a super high level.
---
Actual buffs incoming.
---
It's like saying that goth is about depression and smoking on the graveyard.
---
These styles are about music. You can be listen to punk, dress punk and also be a librarian. Not like you have to smash cars with a wooden plank cuz it seems like something Sex Pistols would do every monday.
---
What happened to nurse i haven‚Äôt played in a while what the hell happened
---
As a spirit player, I‚Äôm happy? But as a player in general, i suck at killer so regardless I‚Äôll still probs be bad xD. I get frustrated playing her too sometimes, especially when I mess up with my phase walk.
---
But surely this could only work the first time? Similarly to using prayer beads with Spirit to mind game survivors at a pallet.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Thanks. I think she's still good though.
---
I like the New Nurse, you can do some great meme builds with them
---
He is way more humanoid than Pennywise. He has a head, two feet and two arms. It has neither.
---
No... it‚Äôs definitely not.  and you have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.  The newest map, Hawkins, has that exact principle on its loops.  And it‚Äôs literally Billy‚Äôs best map rn.  But you just don‚Äôt know how to play billy, do you?
---
https://youtu.be/zbv-R-QwbUc
---
DO you mean Ghost Face?
---
Detection often refuses to work. 
---
If they are staring at you in the open for 20 seconds just to get exposed and still not get you out of it, they will most likely DC.
---
Plague's candy would probably give you food poisoning tho
---
That's pretty much what it is, yeah.
---
Imagine claiming Hawkins is the best Billy map yikes.
---
It's because they lied about it being a add on rework
---
It's the night he comes home after all
---
Its ok
---
He gets defeated for a lot of reasons and they were the only one who could defeat It, basically. Still, he is fucking powerful.
---
Also, the Demo is humanoid.
---
Well guess this starts the era of the Walking Nurses
---
Yeah rigged with deathtraps and fresh corpses
---
It states in the Clown‚Äòs bio that he consumes only alcohol and fast food, hence why he is obese.
---
Trying to heal potatoes is the cause of 95% of my deaths. I guess that makes me a potato too since I never learn lol.
---
Pennywise is not humanoid at all tbh. He can be EVERYTHING and the clownish appearance is there only to get closer to the kids.
---
I only got L1 Nurse, but I think she‚Äôll still probably be fairly good, and we don‚Äôt know exactly what will be released.
---
I wish standing still without using your power was considered an exploit like moonwalking
---
[Nurse Rework](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93557/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
It is, look at the video I linked.
---
But sure just demonstrate you don‚Äôt know how to play Billy some more.
---
&gt;6 second CD will reduce her pressure considerably
---
IIRC the timer starts as soon as she goes into fatigue, which (assuming they didn't change it) lasts 2.5 seconds if you blink twice. So really it's a 3.5 second cooldown
---
Couldn‚Äôt you be a little more creative than typing ‚Äúcrying baby‚Äù into Google and picking the first image?
---
Thank you
---
Imagine thinking I care about a single Billy who possibly wins a single game against a single team of 4 survivors that probably sucked anyway.
---
nah
---
As an Ash main, this is very true
---
I feel like the trapper is just going to swing the bear trap like a flail and hit Dwight with it.
---
You haven‚Äôt seen a single Saw movie when you think Amanda was just corrupted. She is fucking evil, far more than Kramer. She set traps to kill, rugged them all. She just wanted people to die and watch them die.
---
She can still literally teleport wherever she wants and hit you, just with a six second delay now. Don't really see how she conforms to basic design rules now.
---
Basically more cosmetics and stuff. It goes along with the archives
---
Are there any reasonable complaints with Billy? I'm not sure if we can expect a rework for any of the original characters if they aren't completely broken.
---
Wdym we are incompetent. I can perfecrly make omlettes and toast and Im sure Susie can bake great cookies
---
If you're asking about Emblems, No, it does not. You're "wasting" emblem points someone could've used
---
I don't understand. addon changes and every1 thinks Spirit is better? Or are there changes that I am not aware of yet
---
Then what is? Moonwalking with M1 killers? DBD isn't some esport with a huge skill ceiling, Nurse is all there is.
---
Yeah, but that's MK.
---
Is doing jumping jacks on the hook code for the killer is still near leave me for now or the killer left come save me?
---
Even in a big list of serial killers, pedos are singled out for being scum.
---
I'll probably get flack for saying this but I hope they nerf other top tier killers so they can do some sort of blanket survivor nerf or change some core game mechanics in the killers' favor.
---
I would absolutely love for something to be done about Ruin being borderline mandatory for most killers, but some of the highest tier killers often don't *need* ruin, so doing some sort of core game change to address generator speed would be insane for those killers.
---
The dude still literally wears peoples faces. That's pretty freaking psychotic
---
I don‚Äôt think you care about anything, you certainly don‚Äôt care about the validity of your statements since you‚Äôre objectively wrong and clearly misinterpreting the effects of the loop changes.
---
I think he had DS, you didn't get the grasp save event.
---
Or he was walking toward your generator without looking directly in it's direction. Some killers will strafe their way toward a spot to prevent spine chill.
---
Some people say instachainsaw is a bit broken because you cannot turn a loop trying to avoid the chainsaw and you need to drop the pallet early, resulting in the killer destroying the pallet with the chainsaw and so survivor doesn't have time to react
---
Imagine claiming people are objectively wrong with no proof other than one dudes one video of a single game after I discussed an entire map mechanics change to you.
---
If you were wearing the scoops ahoy hat I completely understand the killer's rage and anger.
---
You were taking away Steve's best feature and for that the mori is justified
---
heat up a cup of noodles
---
Michael isn't just fuckin turning off his porchlight
---
that motherfucker is out killing innocent people and enjoying his favorite holiday
---
She still breaks rules, but less often. And some of the rules she breaks are unique weaknesses rather than unique strengths (super slow movement speed). 
---
More importantly this will make her easier to balance, even if she still breaks basic design rules.
---
but probably not S-tier anymore
---
Blits be like: you like playing against insta heals? Well guess what now they got a boost to fly away forcing u to drop the chase
---
Nope, Hooks and Traps. Hangman‚Äôs also applies to bear traps as well and makes them come back sooner just like the hooks.
---
Doc gives fruit for Halloween, and evil not even The Entity can fathom.
---
Exactly! Make your character as flashy as possible. I just want to be the center of attention.
---
Don't forget Mike's add ons are bomb asf, so many different combinations and builds for him.
---
nobody ever said that was cheating lol
---
I never said it was.  Just because Nurse becomes broken with skill doesn‚Äôt make the muscle memory required for it skillful.  Certainly not more than Huntress (without a crosshair) or a clown using mind games to down people.  Nurse is looking somewhere, pressing a button, and instantly goes where she was looking.  Why does everyone act like her ability is complex?
---
bnp isn‚Äôt even close to the strength of prayer beads. maybe old bnp that did the entire gen
---
No. He‚Äôs right. The adding increases nurses  speed.
---
He's just standing there, **MENACINGLY**!!!!
---
They took everything from us!!!! How dare they
---
Lets start a revolution /s
---
All of em?
---
&gt; Friday the 13th: The Game"
---
For legal reasons, causes you to enter the trial as The Trapper with an empty loadout.
---
I died when I got to this.
---
There's some interesting ideas here, and with more polish this could be a really cool concept, even if it can't happen cuz of the lawsuit.
---
You already know the meta lol
---
I believe most people do it for both reasons. It's they're spastically doing it while another is being chased, they most likely want to be saved. If the killer hasn't been seen for ages and they're still on hook, that probably means the killer is still near.
---
Many player playing nurse and bhvr dont want lose customers.
---
\*Awakening plays\*
---
Tbh DH would still be a better option cuz why not get a second chance perk
---
Why does sprint burst and dead hard have cooldowns? Because balance and same goes for killer powers.
---
But like its not that broken i dont have a problem facing it if im not a potato i feel its more for just new players who are caught in the season reset but idk
---
"I hope pig will be the new SS tier by then"
---
and other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself
---
I feel like it‚Äôs implied she never actually got her revenge and her entity dangles it in front of her as a way to control her.
---
I changed it a little so it won't work on yourself anymore
---
You get called a cheater for using those kinds of addons all the time lol. Some people just cant read addons
---
&gt;upset about survivors crying about build
---
&gt;cries on reddit about crying survivors
---
nice

**Hello Devs.  I wanna play a game.  The game I'm playing is very similar to the one that you've been playing, as a community manager.  The game of offering hope to the desperate, hope that one day your game won't be a barely functional rage inducing hunk of shit, so long as the community keeps throwing money into a pit.  I think we can agree that your situation is desperate, so I offer you hope.  The price you pay, is that you must crawl into the same pit of broken mechanics and terrible balance that you force your customers into.  To right is a bathtub, under which is a hole filled with sharp, rusted, feces encrusted pieces of kitchen scales.  Gears, springs, screws, plates, everything you need to make a proper balancing mechanism.  The challenge, however, is that much like your game, most of the pieces are broken or come from different machines.  Only 1 complete set of functional pieces are in the pit, along with one guide to assembly.  Now, Devs, I'm sure you're asking yourself, "why should I care about making a scale?  What happens if I don't make it, or if I don't make it right?"  Well, just like the loyal community you poisoned with your negligence, whose blood was turned toxic through your apathy, I have poisoned you.  In half an hour, your motor skills will be crippled, and brain death will follow within the hour, but I have left the antidote in the room with you.  However, your body requires a VERY specific dosage to counteract the poison.  420 miligrams, to be precise.  Too low a dosage and the poison will shut down your central nervous system, too high a dosage and your blood will acidity will spike, melting your hardened veins and causing fatal internal bleeding.
---
Let the game balance... begin!**
---
By that point BVHR will have made it so looking at pig stuns her for 8 seconds
---
Because changing their minds isn't a thing?
---
buzzzzzzz the hive is buzzing
---
Try playing him on Hawkins. It's a blast!
---
the demogorgon can also kill animals
---
Spirit was already nearly as good as nurse.
---
Yea the longer you charge further you go
---
I mean just accept they are dumb and move on
---
Wait wouldnt hag also be in the talking about her tragic past thing cuz of her circumstances of literally being eaten alive slowly to where her flesh is literally mud and blood and only escaped and killed her captures cuz of how skinny she got and because of the entity
---
Well i dont think so cuz they probably just dont care how the other killers see them since they are just having fun
---
Rad shred is my favorite killer ability but man do i not like the portals
---
Ughhh her elbow makes me uncomfortable
---
The recharge time is too long but other than that im fine with it
---
If that gets decreases a bit nurse will move from ‚Äúin an own league‚Äù to S tier or A tier
---
&gt; Shes gonna drop below spirit billy huntress, maybe even hag. 
---
Not a chance.
---
So long as her power can stop her from being looped, which it still can, she will be good.
---
I've been accused of cheating for not getting blinded at pallets (I was using Lightborn).
---
I've been accused of using wall Hacks for downing a healing survivor on Haddonfield (I was using Nurses Calling).
---
I've been accused of cheating by coming out of nowhere with Old Freddy (I was using Monitor and Beast of Prey so no red stain).
---
Yes it does happen to others and it's absolutely hilarious to me whenever it does.
---
The other way around
---
"Every time, the girls would waste away and die of cold or starvation or sickness."
---
Just like most of the early DbD lore it says something without explaining it or the circumstances. 
---
Because Anna is obviously competent enough to clothe, wash, and feed herself as well as craft and maintain her home, her larder, and her weaponry I always assumed the children died inspite of Anna's best efforts. They died not because she didn't try or know how to take care of them but because she lived in a harsh environment and most of the children just couldn't survive there.
---
That said, the idea that Huntress just forgets or isn't aware that children need food and shelter to survive isn't contradicted by her lore, so it works as well as anything else.
---
I'd smash tho
---
From what I have been told it'll be tied to the quit button in the esc menu, not for task manager or pulling your plug. People will still be able to dc without consequence.
---
Self aware and Sprint burst after pallet stun is something I wanted for a very long time now. Self aware with Monitor  :0
---
Clown is best
---
I dont think i'd want whatever plague cooks up, stuffs contaminated, she probably doesn't even wash her hands
---
Obviously a "would try to poison it" not on purpose but she definitely would indirect poison the food with her plague
---
I mean I see Wraith as someone who came from a lower economic class but had a rich culture and a mother who always tried her best to provide for her families and I imagine him knowing how to cook amazing meals with stuff off a grocery store shelf.
---
I also think if you could calm Spirit down that she would be a decent chef.
---
Now I remember why I quit this game,braindead survivors trashtalking and calling nerfs,also fuck your shitty karma whore post
---
Where?
---
By that point BVHR will have made it so looking at the pig breaks her out of crouch stealth- hey wait a minute
---
Huntress and Freddy would get along...
---
They both forget to serve you real food (no food vs. dream food).
---
And they both like little girls.
---
I would %100 spend all my money to be able to make Michael pop'n'lock
---
Undetectable while crouched. 
---
It's already in the ability description,  probably coming next patch.
---
Everyone forgets the Huntress starved children when she kidnapped them
---
Nurse is shit in low ranks, literally is a free game most of the time lol
---
Considering that the Doctor ran a black site for the CIA I wouldn't doubt he used some form of rape as an interrogation method.
---
Well Phillip also murdered a mob boss in ironic fashion by shoving them into a car crusher after they slit the throat of someone he was trying to save, but yeah.
---
More or less he was just a guy that wanted to do a job and live his life without bothering other people.
---
She looks like she ate barbecue sauce and it stocked on her face and she is trying to get it out while it burns her eyes
---
I feel like it could be good the rework but i don‚Äôt like how some addons hinder the nurse but give her extra blood points and the dashing past a survivor just for blood points is eh and unlike billy or bubba its multiple items that hinder the nurse and reward extra Bloodpoints rather than just one other than that im looking forward to the rework
---
Too accurate
---
Do you use the chains or no. I do
---
Huntress
---
Nah I have mine p3 bloodied up
---
Um still no buffs to Plague's bloodpoint allocation? trash update. 
---
Hmm.. She's a totally different killer now. We'll see how this turns out, hopefully this isn't a repeat of Legi- _oh who am I kidding. sigh._
---
Other killers have it bad enough as it is with the 100% bp addons that do absolutely nothing for them an you're trying to tell me that she is going to have three of them? ü§°
---
who the hell thinks that HuntRESS is a man. He would have been called hunter.
---
Legion are a gang of modern Albertans - it's 7 eleven grub all the way.
---
instaheals are getting nerfed for sure
---
a lot of noobs lol
---
So... Scott playing Nurse when?
---
I'd just run to other door if he was just gonna stay at the exit.
---
Right?!
---
The Legion is probably quite sociable, I mean seriously its literally a group of friends
---
the Demogorgon is pretty much a pet, so makes sense it can't socialize
---
Id don't think anybody would be able to understand Adiris or Anna cause they speak languages none of the other killer do
---
I'm not against the changes, don't worry.
---
You're saying that Nurse was nerfed by SWF request like solo players are fine against her lol
---
Thank God. 3 years late but I'll take it. This bitch has always been an OP piece of shit.
---
I mean, it gets tiresome if it happens enough times in one night, but I only really have to experience it during rank reset. Bubba players in the red ranks are extremely rare.
---
Especially if you're playing on console. Red rank Nurse on PC is pretty deadly
---
I would add wraith and hag to the victims.
---
Hope that Bubba would get some love and finally receive his unique addons
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. 
---
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Spirit Fury/Enduring for sure
---
Her muscle memory is hard to gain. But so is hard to master Trapper, or Clown, or others.
---
Cheers.
---
must be fun not playing killer enough to know how cancerous it is
---
Blinks start charging during fatigue. 3 second recharge 0er blink means that after blinking twice you'll pretty much be able to blink again right away but only once unless you wait 3 more seconds.
---
Everyone knows women can't be tall/muscular.
---
Survivors when they see killer who is above c-tier be like: uNbALaNcEd, nErF, rUleBoOk
---
Nerfing the top killers first would be the way to do it. If they didn't, the game would become pretty unplayable for survivors during the transition period.
---
By nerfing the top killers first, the large majority of killers remain the same.
---
Spirit definitely hunts down the survivors so technically monto is correct Kappa
---
You act like every SWF is a super coordinated team. It isn't. Most SWF are the same randoms you'd face in solo, just playing together. SWF isn't a guaranteed loss, unless the survivors are really good at the game and at that point... are you supposed to win, anyway?
---
She'll still be plenty strong. Just not "objectively the strongest in the game, no room for argument."
---
Its kinda all she needs, enough to make her fair and fun.
---
She will still have just as much map pressure as billy at the very least.
---
BHVR be like "How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man?!"
---
Only good nurse is just gonna be a nurse without addons and even then they nerfed her base power so she‚Äôs gonna get knocked down a few pegs
---
Well at least more skill than before which is something.
---
Dude, have you met the Squadettes?
---
Yeah i nice comfortable middle ground needs to be at least %85-90 of the games balance of power.
---
Decent billys will fake the rev and then instadown you because you didnt use the pallet
---
Lol, cause I read the notes they dropped, it seems like a good nerf to help the balance issue.
---
My opinion is that it doesn‚Äôt read that bad, and I‚Äôm not gonna cry and complain about it until I test it out. 
---
My logic is, it‚Äôs better to try it out before you complain that they have ‚Äúkilled‚Äù the character. Your argument was dumb bud, good try tho. 
---
And I know it‚Äôs a meme, I was simply reply to a comment asking if it was really THAT bad, and no, it‚Äôs not, good nurses will overcome it easily. 
---
You are the one trying to ‚Äútroll‚Äù all the comments who say it‚Äôs not a bad nerf(not even doing a good job either) 
---
And it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúhumorous‚Äù to me, just the same recycled joke I‚Äôve seen all day today.
---
Yeah. I used to be a nurse main and she doesn‚Äôt get punished enough when doing badly. Once you get the distance of your blink in your muscle memory you are pretty much unstoppable thats why I stopped playing her because she is just too easy. Especially with infecious fright and a alug build.
---
Mission passed Respect +
---
That was the whole point which I even said in the video. I was getting the couching while playing. Listen to the tips from PieceontheChain while I play. Lol.
---
Jared Leto never did the Joker, just a awful clown mixed with tattoos
---
Yeah but I appreciate it nontheless. The PTB will show if it‚Äôs not enough.
---
Amanda isn‚Äôt corrupted she was a terrible person long before she came to dbd
---
3 second charge after a blink sounds rough tho.
---
The ultra one is 4.2
---
https://youtu.be/Zk_hBLWCKoI 
---
There you go bud
---
YES! all killer addons need to be this way basically, like wraiths are.  
---
Instead of boring ass addons that are "do X faster and Y slower" they need to be more like "X is now Z and Y is removed", i dream that all the killer addons get reworked this way like the wraith did.
---
Yea I stopped listening after he said unnerving was a better option than agitation and brutal strength
---
We've heard ramblings of leatherface reworks for a couple of patches now, leatherface has been getting weird unintentional changes and bugs to his abilities for about 4 patches now. Which shows that they've been internally changing stuff with him, the same thing happened to freddy for a few patches before his rework was announced. 
---
Don't know if it'll come out any time this year. Since I'm not sure if we'll see the midchapter go as  scheduled what with all the delays and the holiday seasons.
---
500 hours is quite a bit but still relatively small if you play both sides since it's almost 2 different games.
---
This. 
---
upvote.
---
Legion is badass. It always makes for a fun game, even if the killer doesn't get a sacrifice.
---
&gt; I'm saying that murder is infinitely worse than rape.
---
Have you been murdered and raped and can tell us, truthfully, which is worse? that's just your opinion. I'd personally say that rape is worse, you can't suffer when you're dead. Freddy is also a pedophile and went after children, who are at their most vulnerable/impressionable stage. Rape at that age could especially fuck a person up for life.
---
So she belongs with the psychopaths, got it.
---
Bubba was also mentioned to get an add on rework alongside Billy
---
If she believed in their redemption then yes I'd say misguided, but because of the misguidedness(?) Of John Kramer, she became corrupt and believe none able to be cured.
---
No theyll nerf her after the spirit.
---
I wanna die after this nerf
---
Less common of a problem, but keys also seriously need to be looked at. Instaheals basically resetting chase sucks, but the a key's a ability to instantly end the game with no way to stop it is pretty nutty.
---
Unhooks in terror radius when killer is visible nearby kicking gen and pallet.... calls it camping when they die and waits in lobby for trial to finish. Just laugh that shit off.
---
Okay so the Nurse nerf was needed.  
---
I am just sitting here and waiting for some survivor mains starting with the whole: "Actually, this is a buff to killers".
---
I don‚Äôt have any real issues with Billy but Spirit and Nurse were the only ones needing a nerf.
---
I suddenly feel bad about using the sultry red dress cosmetic.
---
"Amanda' starts with an A not an L
---
What a shame x
---
Fookin' dead 'ard m8
---
Myers would give you the best candy, I can feel it
---
Has a game on killer yesterday where I had to defend ruin from 3 survs while 1 guy popped 4 gens. They finally got it with 1 gen left, but then they all died coz they was all on death hook (Except the one on gens.)
---
The totem was in the middle of the cornfield and I had thrill.
---
Nope, archive is a story mode thingy, battle pass will come with it or somewhere around it. They call it "the rift" or something if I remember well.
---
We'll see
---
3 of the shittest killers wondering if they will be promoted now the general has fallen.  
---
Mikey: "lol"
---
LEATHER FACE IS BETTER FIGHT ME [BATTLE STANCES BOYS!](https://www.imgur.com/a/nJ4hRsd)
---
Also the one who 'dyes her hair crazy colours' has black hair.
---
I'll definitely take this info into consideration. Let me play around with it and maybe it'll be in another episode.
---
i imagine using 1 ful length blink to traverse half the map, maybe a third, then when flushing survivors out use the others, while blinking and shit the first one is already on the recharge.
---
BHVR got your back.
---
Bubba needs a slight power buff to be honest.
---
This is what you get on red ranks (on pc).  
---
Not every Nurse player is a god.  
---
I personally would rather face 10 good nurses than 5 good spirits. You can juke a Nurse way more easily.  
---
The whole problem with her was that multiple blink addons plus a short fatigue timer wouldn't punish a nurse "failing" her power enough.  
---
You would blink 2+ times, fatigue, blink 2+ times, fatigue, blink 2+ times, hit, fatigue and so on.  
---
Now you'll blink 2 times, fatigue, have to wait couple seconds and by then the survivor allready had enough time to reposition.  
---
Also you lose the whole aspect of map pressure by just using 4-6 blinks to blink arround the whole map within a short time span.  
---
I can't see how anyone would think that adding a 3second recharge per blink instead of being able to INSTANLY use it is just a "minor change/nerf".
---
This is like giving a killer -5% movement speed. It doesn't look like much, but it will make a killer drop his value by a lot.
---
U gotta aim better plus some addons make it easier
---
LoL every other game at rank 1 i play is vs 3 or 4 Man swf. 
---
And No i dont assume i check friend lists
---
Bubba will probably get a buff tho
---
I think most of the Legion outfits are going to share a common theme between the specific Legion member.
---
Joey's mask will always be cloth based
---
I'm assuming Susie is always going to have a skirt or dress.
---
 Frank and Julie are most likely going to look similar
---
Trying to make her not be better than every other killer by a mile? She doesnt need compensation, she was running rampant and should be toned down a notch to be in line with everyone
---
You will learn soon that killers are OP at low ranks, but a fucking joke at mid-high ranks, because survivors can follow a formula to calculate loops per pallet, people per gen, time on hook etc, with anything but dumbass survivors the game is and has always been pretty easy to dominate as a survivor.  
---
They have always been the true power role in the game.
---
It‚Äôs all about getting the right colour shoe polish
---
Do we have any patch notes on it to see for ourselves yet?
---
lol at rating the game.
---
Check the hot posts or the Facebook official Dead By Daylight page.
---
They will get there im sure, this wont be the last rework. 2020 will be a big year for DbD especially as then they can just stop joking around with deathgarden and divert their attention to their only source of income.
---
The battlepass is The Rift
---
Ladies and gentlemen, the Graeae in killer form
---
It is but also have alot factors that completely make bringing a key not worth it like am I going to die first? Can I find the hatch? Will we dominate the killer etc etc. Not downplaying keys at all just saying there's alot of factors at play with the key(it definitely does need tweaking though)
---
Greate use of this meme template.
---
F for the Nurse. Now she can rest in 5-blink-ebony-mori
---
With those 120hrs, you will still be a way better nurse then me.
---
I personaly feel this nerf whas needed, due to her being way to strong. I don‚Äôt have statistics to prove this. But I‚Äôm pretty sure she has the highest win/loss ratio or total kills of all red tier killers.
---
I once got called a hacker cause i moried ppl without burning an offering and had noed with 3 gens left
---
Some ppl are just dumb or don't want to see reality cause that would mean they have to improve
---
with one blink you can cover 6 seconds worth of distance a survivor makes.
---
Right? You bet them I'm coming for that ace booty after that, the little bitch.
---
First 2-3 times i played i thought there was only one killer , was too scared to actually notice the design of the Killers . She is my mom now .
---
If you still care, use your gas as a way to zone. Don‚Äôt hit the survivors, hit where you don‚Äôt want them to go or where they have to go. And brutal strength. People will drop pallets super often against clown to save them selves from a slow. Brutal strength helps a lot.
---
dead hard negated 1 blink from the nurse, if you dead hard against current nurse you survive until after the fatigue.
---
Favourite killers to play: Spirit (most success) and Hag (most fun jump scares). In lower ranks, I like to play Wraith as well.
---
Favourite killers to counter: Kind of all of them. All of them, but Freddy and the Plague. I do mostly enjoy Spirit and Hag though, considering I know how to play them and like to find out what I can/could do better.
---
HIVEMIND!
---
Landing a chainsaw with Bubba against a decent survivor is a crap shot.
---
thanks, 2 friends have this issue too. I'll tell them to try using a VPN.
---
As a red rank bubba, I can confirm red rank suvivors have no idea how to handle a bubba who doesn't facecamp and knows how to mindgame loops.
---
I know, he just forgot to point it out.
---
Did she recently get buffed? Or did people realize how good she is?
---
That would never happen though . BHVR wont work on a new effect , and for sure , wont get back all those voice actors to record the laughs .
---
Edward scissor hands.
---
I mean, considering how pig mains ejaculate from hearing the stun noise of their character, I don't think they would complain tbh.
---
Gen grabber should alreay have been nerfed
---
Scoops-my-ass steve im guessing?
---
Why are you implying fortnite is more toxic than DbD lol
---
I mean, human meat would taste different depending on the type of person.
---
&gt;I think all the supernatural lore that came later in the series
---
Um... It seems as if you didn't watch the 1978 film if you think the supernatural stuff came after...
---
Seems like you have a list to redo.
---
So absence of evidence is evidence of absence?
---
People who experience Freddy's repulsive method of crime have indeed gone on to live successful lives, education, career, romance, marriage, and successfully responded to therapy in their adult lives.
---
Name one person (any one person) who, after being murdered, went on to successfully respond to therapy, earn an education, have a successful career, and find romance.
---
Essentially we have two instances of being a victim crime, one (murder) results in the victim absolutely failing to be a productive member of society, absolute failing to recover in any fashion (psychologically or physically), absolutely failing to earn income, have or support a family, date or get married, take up hobbies, travel the world, or do anything at all that your average individual would consider "the top ten ways to enjoy life".
---
The other, though it does not always, *has* resulted in individuals who recover.
---
Brain death has a 100% failure rate to achieve recovery in every single instance of death in all of human history, our sample size as evidence is so massive as to be unarguable, and that means the burden of evidence is on you.
---
Clearly death is worse for your success.
---
Meh, Legion's for mass stabbings of survivors, not raking up kills. Unless people want to see Moris or NOED in play, they'll have to deal with few kills from Legion.
---
Going for the prestige is such a waste of blood points. Unless of course you have prestiged pretty much every character and don't know what else to do.
---
Cheers, found and liked the FB
---
wouldn't psychopaths be victims in a sense?
---
I like the add on changes but that blink resource thing is nerfing her a bit too much. At least make the timer 2 seconds instead of 3.
---
Side note: Why is it when they want to "balance" a killer they put a timer on their power. Couldn't they think of something different for nurse.
---
Huntress doesn't speak English though. Unless someone taught her?
---
I thought it was the pig mask, is that not in the porn you watch?
---
Ez 30k... but as a doctor main I never get dailies for the doctor.
---
I'm a spirit main and i'm not ashamed
---
What HAPPEND ? I am Not Up to Date with my favorite Killer Waifu......Please Explain
---
Demo for sure
---
Pig and Ghost Face discussing jumpscare tactics sounds great.
---
Me playing against spirit - me playung spirit
---
Basically, it happens, a lot, not ok lol
---
I love this ahahah
---
for me it‚Äôs more so that I just really enjoy 100%ing games. I am loving dbd (for the most part) at the moment and fully completing characters is one of me goals before I inevitably set it down (all perks for all characters, max prestige on everyone, all the achievements). just a fun hobby for me (:
---
It depends on *when* the survivor does it IMO.
---
We all know different survivors use it for different signals, and there is never going to be one single agreed upon definition, but here's mine:
---
If a survivor starts flapping their arms immediately, the Killer is doing something dangerous to potential rescuers (Hag traps, Trapper traps, Freddy traps/fake pallets, Demogorgon portal).
---
If the survivor randomly flaps their arms, there is a danger to another survivor, usually a potential rescuer (patrolling killer) that is not camping or proxying. This danger may also be the killer approaching a generator being worked on.
---
If the survivor continuously flaps their arms, they are being camped/proxied.
---
If the survivor repeats multiple 'Kobe' motions in a row, they are ready to be unhooked.
---
If a survivor is flapping their arms wildly as you approach, they are either warning you to be careful (traps present) again or warning other survivors off (to prevent wasting time); continue to approach unless they were flapping their arms before you got in close proximity, just be careful (generally only applies to once you are in LOS of the survivor).
---
And he didn't have it lol
---
Technically it should work out that way, but they could've buffed the weak ones.
---
Once Spirit is nerfed, coordinated SWF players are going to steamroll pretty much every killer.
---
Bold of you to assume Spirit got shit on Nurse
---
Jokerman said the S word
---
her core kit is very skill based but because of her ridiculous strength it doesn't really require much skill to play her decently, if you compare someone with 100 hours on nurse compared to someone with a 1000 (assuming they both have the same total killer hours) the difference really wouldn't be that big, now if you look at a huntress with 2000 hours compared to 100 you see a huge difference in core gameplay. nurses skill floor is probably the highest but her skill ceiling definitely isn't (minimum skill required to play them okay and point at which there's almost nothing else to learn)
---
I like
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the new Samination DBD parody video where Nurse complains about being nerfed
---
Billy is a victim of child abuse
---
Demogorgon or a Good nurse. Demo for busic and nurse for a challenge.
---
I mean if you're good at nurse that first hit is free, ghostface can get a free hit but he'll lose his stealth.
---
I agree it's definitely underwhelming for the addon rarity, but I mean compare nurse's add-ons to Ghost Face's, which are basically all the exact same concept just in different increments. I'd much rather have underwhelming add ons with totally unique gameplay in each than all the add ons doing the same thing.
---
Are you really that dumb? 
---
Good day bud, not even gonna waste time arguing with someone like you.
---
There are changes you are not aware of yet.
---
You forgot Claudette
---
It be worth it just to ahoy him.
---
&gt; generally all of the males  are 'quieter' 
---
Bill and Ash would like to have a word with you.
---
You caught him on the lower end of his chainsaw charge up time. Super skillful under pressure, or just lucky. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This doesn't help him in any way the cough itself can be heard fairly well as is and doesn't do much for him because you already get a scream when survivors first enter or get hit by gas
---
I doubt it honestly
---
Takes a pretty fucking evil sonnuva nun to Willingly diddle and kill children, idk if his dad was 1000 maniacs or Alice Cooper, not everyone can be just a victim of circumstance
---
Spirit has an audible sound while activating her power unless you're within her terror radius range (in which case you hear the heartbeat first), in both cases you know the Spirit is nearby and have ample warning (particularly if you know it's a Spirit). **Prayer Beads is an exception to this, naturally.**
---
All Killers have the same lunge distance, Spirit just has a brief fade-in after using her power that makes it look longer, her movement speed drops when her power ends and doesn't impact her lunge. Spirit also has a slower base movement speed, but the same lunge speed, making her acceleration look more dramatic.
---
When injured you're not going to be hiding from any Killer without Iron Will, get to a pallet, run Spine Chill, fast vault for noise notifications and then slow vault for trickery, her power has a lengthy enough cooldown and she moves slower without it.
---
Repair generators, she can't be everywhere at once, and you have an exhaustion perk (I hope) to gain a lot of initial distance.
---
Nurse now has a cooldown on her blinks plus all her addons got changed and some new ones
---
Yes, exactly.
---
I agree on the nurse changes, but now majority of killers will still be shit.   
---
And Nurse might join them.  
---
This doesn't fix any issues on the killers side of things.
---
Leatherface is a victim because he kills so that he doesn't disappoint his family
---
To play: Ghost Face. I like that he's more mobile than, say, Trapper, but still has a tactical side to his gameplay.
---
To counter: Myers. Notice him in time in Tier I, and you'll have a chance to escape!
---
I am sorry man, I've just had a series of very bad games.
---
Trapper is really tense cause ya never know where he‚Äôs trapped
---
The thing about Spirit is that survs can take a perk (Iron Will) which significantly hurts her.  Against a good nurse there is literally nothing you could do.
---
The Freddy pretty much walked right into getting head on'd and was punished for it. If a downed survivor is near a locker, just check the locker.
---
I love playing the Legion despite them being in a bad spot, but I enjoy the matches with my build that I'm running on them, Spirit and Myers are a lot of fun to me aswell.
---
I enjoy playing against almost every killer asides the Huntress, I don't consider her to be broken since every killer (even Bubba with Legion) can be scary if the killer is playing really well, but I just have the least ammount of fun getting a hatchet tossed into my back from a good Huntress and sent to hang on the hook with most things that would work against melee ranged killers just not having any impact against her.
---
After about 50 hrs of nurse, predicting Targets and downing them becomes something that your brain automatically decides  to do.
---
And this is why i main freddy ;p
---
an idea i had way back when, was that hex perks had a constant effect, immune to the cleansing, but had a more powerful effect that does get merked.
---
then, you could tag your hex back onto a dull totem, or you could build new totems / they regenerate slowly
---
Hardly a rework on the nurse herself she can still blink through walls only part that is changed now you actually have to learn how to blink effectively all tho I find it weird you get punished for blinking when that is the only way to chase as the Nurse
---
I don't play the game but why ? Did they nerf nurse ? Buff Spirit ?
---
&gt; She is my mom now
---
Same tbh
---
Lets hope they ditch the moneygrabbing battlepass idea and keep some integrity.
---
Battelpasses are poison. You want the content we are creating? Pay a subscription.
---
Wait, what happened ?
---
There are a lot of changes.  
---
But instead of being able to chain-blink arround like she's used to - now after each double blink she'll have to wait 3 seconds per blink charge to get her power back.  
---
So she loses all her map pressure and her kit of ending chases got gutted.
---
If you're a godlike nurse player that only needs 1 blink to hit 100% of the time - you won't feel much of a change. (But still feel how you've lost the map pressure).  
---
But for 99% of other nurse players she's now a huge amount of less forgiving.
---
The nurse rework is actually nice. The animation cancel on the current nurse literally gave her inf teleport. Putting it on charges and 3 second recharg means shes still strong but cant just spam it infinitely.
---
I think it‚Äôs because women on average fear rape over actual death.
---
Those edges are a massacre.
---
Also buff pig
---
I like playing trapper for those games where ppl step in every trap
---
Maybe they don¬¥t care to take a ride on an ocean of flavor
---
Too soon.....
---
here's the problem about your statements, it's true that if you get a perfectly streamlined swf and they're also pretty decent at looping then they'll win practically every game that isn't a nurse or a prayer beads spirit. that's how it works on paper, but in reality there's so many other things that make those expectations really unrealistic and there's plenty of people that prove that, for example scorpion, he's a pig main and can consistently achieve 4ks while playing a b tier killer with non meta perks. sure it's hard to rank up with shitty killers but far from impossible and killers will always have a higher skill ceiling than survivors unless you make them simply overpowered like pre nerf nurse and pb spirit
---
&gt;It's like a really slight change
---
Dude don't get me wrong. I welcome these changes.  
---
But changing her ability to instant-blink after being fatigued to:   
---
Every blink will need 3 seconds to re-charge isn't a "really slight change."  
---
You can't chain blink anymore. You lose all your map pressure.  
---
You can blink twice, then follow a survivor for 6 seconds while being slower than him, and then blink twice again.  
---
This is a huge nerf.  
---
I welcome it. But say it like it is, lol.
---
The only ones who believe nurse is going to be bad now after these changes are the same ones who think she is fine now. She will still be good. You just have to wait a couple seconds after fucking up your blink to blink again. Boo hoo.
---
I rly doubt she is going to be that nerfed to the point she is dead
---
I honestly hate it. Ive had games where we complete all 5 gens without ever being seen becuase the killer absolutely sucks. Then noed activates and fucks us because its a nurse that can camp the gates. 
---
Its basically a free 2 sacrifices for bad killers.
---
As long as you're having fun nothing else matters :)
---
Haha Russian swear word funni updoot
---
Just to stress the point, "slowly accelerates" doesn't accurately reflect the acceleration of his default saw. You *need* to use a movement speed add-on if you want to see *any* benefit from chilli... and doing so will prevent you from using his *far more terrifying and effective add-on combo -* Primer Bulb and Carburetor Tuning Guide, AKA the "instasaw".
---
Survivors DC no matter what.  
---
I stopped playing this game for a while, picked it up within the last BP event.  
---
On the sunday I've played out of 9 games every game had atleast 1 survivor that dc'd.  
---
And I only played Ghostface (because I still have the 103% BP cakes on him)
---
best mentality (:
---
She looks like a man..
---
It actually has one balanced landing spot. The big tree in the center you can climb up. Also the basement stairs.

It actually has two balanced landing spot. The big tree in the center you can climb up. Also the basement stairs.

Please no, just add other more interesting objectives for survivors to do that contribute opening up an escape route. No one wants to have to hold M1 longer anymore. BHVR needs to stop being lazy and actually implement such new unique mechanics.
---
I guess, the last time i was in a Team with an Masked Meg she not only showed the Killer where I was, but also Teamed up with her to kill me. Not all Masked Megs are like this sure. But that really frustrated me.
---
Nice, I've only 3 prestiged Dwight. Only want maybe one more character with all the perks for easy loadout switching.
---
That's what sucks about this. BHVR might improve things for the majority, but there are always people who worked hard for what they wanted and BHVR essentially devalues that with a change. For instance, I leveled Laurie just for DS, and then they nerfed it.
---
Honestly it doesn't make a difference.I always played with 87 ping with some small jumps to 110 and it was good except for huntress,where sometimes the hatchet started going about 0.2-0.4 secs later than usual
---
Hands down best comment of the week.
---
My bad you implied it.
---
Yeah Spirit also needs a slight tweak to have some counterplay.
---
I've played Hag since she came out. I don't know why some people see her as weak and but her in B tier.
---
She was so strong if you played her well before bit after her buff and addon rework she's just insane.
---
Well, typically I will let myself get healed if there is a survivor in my proximity and I will not heal if only one gen is left because I have adrenaline. I'd like to think that I know what I'm doing (most of the time) and I don't run to the furthest corner to heal there. With bond I can see if someone else is getting chased which means I can heal anywhere and if I don't know if it's safe I'll try to heal out of sight/at a pallet.
---
&gt; *Why does spirit..*
---
&gt; *Why is she the only killer in the game with...*
---
Only a dev can answer those questions for you. No one outside of the dev team is going to be privy to their internal design decisions.
---
&gt; *There‚Äôs no mindgaming a proper Spirit*
---
You can mindgame her by staying close to sources of noise, and can be made easier by taking Iron Will when you eventually get it. u/lespritdelescalier11's link has some good additional information on that.
---
Sorry for the noob question but what exactly happened?
---
I'm traveling and can't log in to the game.
---
The absolute meltdowns when dhe'll be functionally identical to current Nurse if you stack cooldown add-ons, since that cuts the cooldown in half, meaning it's only 0.5s of recharge after a double blink before you can blink again. Considering how strong current base Nurse is her achieving that power level with just an uncommon and rare add-on seems pretty fine to me.
---
If there's a delay, the big downside is that the survivors now are able to have reaction time to her. Before you could get in their general area, and short blink straight to them without a delay.
---
Thats really Bad. Well i Play Spirit instead
---
unless you are an SWF then you always feel powerful. The biggest problem with the game still is the huge difference between playing solo survivors (or 2 man swfs) compared to playing as 3 or 4 man swf. If at the very least the killer would know beforehand if he is facing swf teams and which teammembers joined together than it would be slightly better than it is now but overall swf still ruins the game. It's impossible to properly balance the game that way... If you don't want solo survivors to constantly die and feel hopeless then swf will always feel too powerful...
---
I wish they'd introduce a 5th perk slot for killers that's only usable when you face 3 or 4 man swf teams with certain anti-swf perks that otherwise aren't usable, that way you could balance solo and swf separately...
---
Watching streamers helped me immensely. I‚Äôve never watched any before, and am now a huge fan of Otzdarva, Hybrid Panda, and No0b3. 
---
This was helpful for two main reasons: seeing techniques modeled at a high skill level that other players commonly use, and becoming familiar with the thought process behind the actions that killers and survivors.
---
and with them their ultimate bane amd grand enemy... urban evasion claudettes
---
He understood what you were saying, but he was telling you that you're wrong about your assumption that Nurse can get bullied any more than before.
---
Good nurses will still stomp; bad nurses will still get stomped. Nothing new, just getting juked will be that much more impactful for bad nurses.
---
Spirit is Discount Nurse, but easier to play. People constantly downvoted and berated me for months on here back when I would say that Spirit was borderline broken because I have a friend who immediately switched to her when she launched and sunk hundreds of hours to the point survivors can't mindgame him anymore. There is just no opportunity for it. He knows when to end phasing early, when to fake and let the survivor move first so that he can predict where they are going. Playing against his Spirit was honestly much worse than playing against Nurse because no matter what you were going to go down.

which addons? the fking one where "hit a survivor to become a basic m1 killer with no ability for 60 sec"
---
Yea cuz there gonna add an licenced skin to a non licenced character.
---
Finally something Bubba beats the Hillbilly in.
---
Devs don't balance based on what you complain about, Just throwing that out there.
---
I can't wait for more half baked lore with more holes in it than swiss cheese and more vagueness than cafeteria mystery meat soup
---
do ya thing friend!
---
Probably something like the new bnp. When triggering the "insta" heal while healing. You have to perform 3 hard skill checks that heal you 25% each. It won't deplete the med kit anymore and if you stop during the "insta" heal, the add on gets lost.
---
i'm excited for it, but i also hope it doesn't retcon anything. i hate when games do that
---
Detective Tapp has entered the chat
---
this...
---
the game is impossible to balance if you can't balance swf and solo separately. We need changes to killers that are active once you face an SWF (like a 5th perk slot vs. 3 or 4 man swf) or nerfs to SWF groups (like: only half  of your team (rounded down) is allowed to bring an item)
---
As much as I'd love to see onslaught, It's OP as heck. But I love this concept. Seeing all the fucking Dwight's run scared because their pallets don't do anything would be gold
---
Forget that, I want to see the hag rip out and eat the liver of Freddy, the child diddler and killer.
---
I‚Äôm a whore for lore.
---
Isn't it kingfield üëÄ

I‚Äôm already tracer

---
I mean. I faced many prayer beads and I have no problem in most maps with grass
---
Only on those without it catches me the first time. I would be fine if they reworked the whole add on but it's so rare (like bnp, that was the example) that's not even a problem
---
in an average match you would use double blink about 60 times to get around the map aka outside of chases, with the new 3 sec recharge mechanic you would spend about 180 sec or 3 full mins walking at a 3.85m/s ms which is insanely slow, so idk, what can 4 survivors do in 3 free mins which will basically be nurse downtime?
---
They obviously dont play killer
---
And traps lol
---
But those add-ons are pretty scummy
---
To be fair...that luxury is completely broken and actually affords the Nurse luxuries that no other killers have.
---
Walls? Pallets? Different floors? What could those possibly be?
---
Now you're name calling the person you don't agree with. 
---
Please remember to treat others as you'd like to be treat, with respect. People are entitled to their views, even of you don't agree with them.
---
Also I am a girl and don't appreciate being called bud.
---
I mean hey it might be ok for tracking
---
I honestly hope they don‚Äôt include Lore in the PTB. 
---
Let the challenge part work for testing, but let all of us find the lore at the same time, whether we be on PC, PS4, Switch, or Xbox.
---
Ghostface. He can create some of the scariest moments in the game, or some of the funniest.
---
Well it's not playing like a bad survivor anymore if it benefits you now is it!
---
the non old route of Halloween that isn't canon anymore but still was when Stalky boy came to DbD had him as some kind of demonic entity
---
But the hatch wasn‚Äôt made by the entity? It was made by Vigo who made it out of the Fog.
---
That is a vast improvement.
---
Most survivors run DS. Even if you don't now most killers slug you if they think you do.
---
You now have 2 minutes immunity every game. If the killer misjudges the time you still get it.
---
If you keep it for endgame and aren't on ladt hook you are in godmode.
---
How is that worse?
---
Unfortunately it's all down to RNG - you'll either get lucky and all the perks you want will come up early, or you'll get unlucky and every L50 Bloodweb will have 3 of the perks you're refusing to buy.
---
The only ones that might be "worth" avoiding are unwanted teachables, although bear in mind you could end up with a perk drought from L35 to L40 - if you have two unwanted teachables then they'll clog up your Bloodweb until three perks start appearing.
---
What? That's not what it's written there. "Rather than immediately receiving all her blink charges following fatigue, she will instead¬†regain charges one at a time. Each charge takes three seconds¬†starting from the beginning of her fatigue."
---
So if she blinks twice she'll only get one blink back three seconds after three the fatigue ends, not half a second. And six seconds to be able to double blink again.
---
The shre voice actor or the stalker?
---
It's crazy how difficult noed is for solo but how easy it is to counter with swf, theres a huge gap for sure
---
Freddy was not a pedo u idiot. Watch old movies. Only in newest one he is shown this way. He was just children killer
---
Just realized how chill and cocky Bubba's black mask looks compared to previous masks.
---
You could really find a better example of the advantage swf has other than someone using head on and a flashlight
---
Y‚Äôall always forgetting that ghost face is most oftenly a teenager. 
---
He‚Äôs totally trick or treating. Probably killing people while doing it ( because the popularity of the costume) but still trick or treating
---
You're totally correct that more survivors run it than ever. I guess that is a huge downside, as the longer time goes on, the more people will have it, so it makes sense to remove the obsession part. Once again though, in many random lobbies, the players will not unhook you in endgame, and you're not always guaranteed to get BT working to make it to the exit gates after getting off. Both versions have their perks, and while this one is more balanced for the killer, (because what killer likes getting slammed randomly by survivors) it was a very cool perk in the beginning. Especially as if you were feeling bold, you could prolong the chase while other survivors do gens with dead hard and DS. (Used to be a great combo- prolong loops with DH, restart with DS)
---
You are only looking at default Nurse and not taking into account her add-ons that shorten the blink charge time.

Lmao that would be a fantastic nerf are u high, 3 seconds per blink capping out at three blinks
---
Because Claudette doesn't care
---
While I do agree that the spam of "pig bad plz buff" memes are annoying and need to get band I do think there's a point to be made about how she indeed needs a buff, and  your point about the devs being focused on bugs is pointless, as a game will die if there is too many bugs or just a quickly, if not quicker, if the game is dry and lacks new content

Ehhh I consider All members of Legion to be psychopaths except for maybe Suzie. She never wanted to kill anyone and was pressured into doing so.

---
It was hard enough on console, now I may just have to switch mains because she‚Äôll get destroyed so easily :(

I haven‚Äôt played dbd since spirits release. As a former rank 1 nurse spammer could someone explain what happened?

Bullseye. Pinpoint. Dead-on. 
---
EXACTLY what I wanted to say but couldn‚Äôt say it any better. 
---
Console Nurse main here. How the f@&amp;$ can console players try the PTB if I‚Äôm on console. Do our opinions even matter?? Did ANY Nurse main complain and ask for rework (console or PC)??? The hell with all add ons, tweak, remove, add, change whatever, but why f@&amp;$ with her base kit???? Do you have any idea what console Nurses have to go through to even begin getting hits and down. t-bagging, b‚Äôming. hundreds over hundreds of hours (without addons) to just get a grasp, and still get shit on by SWF‚Äôs. 
---
No one held our hands when we were newbies, why cater to new players now??? This will not maximize your profits nor bring in new players, as a matter if fact, this will deter old players from supporting your game, I just bought Demo yesterday even though I‚Äôm a Nurse main just to simply support the devs. Which dumb ass dev or exec took the decision?? On what basis did he/she base his/her decision on??
---
Here‚Äôs an idea bhvr, remove hooks so no one can get sacrificed. Then buff survivors to get a balanced game.
---
One of your reasons bhvr is that add-on reworking is not to mess with muscle memory. It‚Äôs MY f@&amp;$ing muscle memory which I will suffer from IF I use add-ons.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
Now I await for angry Polish people.

Wait I am polish. A NIECH CIƒò ,PANIE GOS'IE

Oop, damn I forgot I don‚Äôt really care bud, and I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúname call‚Äù I asked if you were dumb.
---
By your response I‚Äôve found out you are dumb, and please, remember, I didn‚Äôt ask for your respect and I don‚Äôt fucking care about receiving it. I never challenged your views besides that you shouldn‚Äôt be jumping down the devs throats when you haven‚Äôt even tried it.
---
But honestly your little ‚Äúphycological‚Äù approach is annoying and you‚Äôre not even right in your comments although you act like you are and I‚Äôm wrong while telling me not to judge others opinions, that‚Äôs hilarious.

And I call everyone bud, even in person, and I‚Äôm not really interested in if you like it or not, I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre a girl a boy or a fucking alien. 
---
Please stop pushing your opinions on me by telling me I shouldn‚Äôt call someone bud.
---
Thanks for understanding bud.
---
Wait what is, did they actually nerf nurse? Or just her addons
---
in the next 3 months it will be spirit passing on to Freddy.
---
I'm crying in the club right now. All a nurse wants to do is look after her patients while keeping great patience. Blink your last blink. üò•üò™üòìüò≠
---
Because Nurse isn't broken af at all ,right ?
---
Nurse on console or any killer that has tunnel vision
---
They gutted Nurse and they reworked her addons.  
---
She'll now have a lot of funny meme builds, but nurse itself is dead.
---
They already have exposed hard counter, No Mither!  Cant snuff you out before dead hard if you start with it
---
Why is Myers called The Shape?
---
Well they should buff her then
---
Theyre changing nurses addons, but also Nurse is just busted still anyway.
---
"play the game how I want you to"
---
So what's the joke here?
---
Literally any killer against my specific hitbox
---
That's not even close to true
---
&gt;Took the most skill
---
That is highly debatable. All you needed with Nurse was time and muscle memory, not exactly a testament to the most skill when other killers require mindgames, variety in movement, planning decisions, having to learn how to bait survivors into dropping pallets or making bad decisions.
---
What did Nurse require for skill? Prediction and practice holding M2. She was just a grind. Got nothing on Scorpio, a Pig player who has learned how to wall ride with the ambush attack and mindgame drops to counter Balanced Landing users lol
---
Ok I'm going to see this now can everybody stop using traps aren't meant to get kills anytime someone brings up a problem with the traps.
---
All pig players know this what they are annoyed about tends to be their options to use and play around with the traps were taken away.
---
Trust me it is not hard to create a build specifically designed to get bear trap kills. However nobody is asking for it to become easier to get kills.
---
One of the main advantages of endgame pig was that you didn't have to worry about any survivors with a trap as they couldn't leave and they can't waste time opening an exit gate this gave you a lot of time to apply pressure on to the people who didn't have traps whilst those who did had to get them off.
---
If anything Killers usually get nerfed after PTB because survivors haven't adjusted to killers yet and tend to still whine a lot...
---
Billy was the op/hate target #2 before Spirit hate came out of nowhere a few months ago. When that happened everyone stopped to care about him. Why idk, guess streamers start it and their communities parrot it and spreads it.
---
Honestly, we had it coming
---
Spirit is always to fun to play against. You can always tell the difference between a good and a bad spirit. Nurse just isn‚Äôt fun to play against, mostly because she has no counterplay. Glad they nerfed nurse.
---
Incoming Zubat video of a 4k in 5 minutes with new nurse
---
I loved last year's Hallowed Blight because of this. Lore and cutscenes!
---
He will probably get at least one ultra rare addon
---
The bottom green box. Also me.
---
It always happens because of trolls
---
Literally any experienced killer will do that no matter what survivor you are
---
Actually majorly concerned about this possibility. I like spirit, but Billy is still my main dude that I use to feed BP to everyone else. Even if all they do is change the rarity of Carburetor Tuning Guides or Thompson Gas Mix up to Very Rare or Ultra Rare, that'd mess me up good and screw up my BP farming.
---
He‚Äôs clearly never been yoinked
---
Yea so i think the good nurse players will probably have ultimately less consistent 4k‚Äôs than before, but this no where near kills her she still has the best skill in the game. There should have always been a cooldown on it and im glad they did this
---
Rules Set No. 2 not being a part of her base kit after all of this time is such a big oof
---
He is called The Shape because in the original Halloween movie (1976) and Halloween II (1981), he was credited as The Shape in the end credits.
---
How so?
---
Now shes being balanced as the blink being a power and less of... well... her.
---
That should make her easier on console.
---
The bastard son of a hundred maniacs
---
Battle pass emote: the middle finger.
---
Make it 'appen devs
---
I bet this dude tbags and flashlight clicks.
---
Why are perks not considered legitimate counterplay yet it's totally ok that killers are completely reliant on hex ruin?
---
The idea behind Myers is that he is pure evil in The Shape of a man. I believe it‚Äôs a from a quote from the movies but I‚Äôm not 100% sure on that.
---
That was what the character was credited as in the original 1978 movie. Nick Castle provided the body, or 'shape' of Michael Myers.
---
What that means is that whatever killer you main is going to be nerfed to oblivion. Either switch to playing survivor or uninstall.
---
Addons will only be for diversion.
---
Nure op. Nurse needs nerf, good riddance nurse most unbalanced character.
---
What about SWF completely destroying any need for aura reading perks and turning OoO from an annoyance to a killer destroying perk?
---
Nothing? Quiet? Ok.

I still don't understand your math. Their text states: "Rather than immediately receiving all her blink charges following fatigue, she will instead¬†regain charges one at a time. Each charge takes three seconds¬†starting from the beginning of her fatigue."
---
Since it's 3s to get a single blink back at base after double blinking, with -0.9s and -0.6s add-ons you get that one blink back after 1.5s, not 0.5s.
---
This comment needs more upvotes^
---
Ah yes what a relief that instead of addressing the issue behind why people played Nurse so much they just removed one of three killers who have literally any map pressure whatsoever because Behavior, instead of being dumb idiots who couldn't balance a game if it was on a seesaw, are actually secretly genius. Once they drive away all the killers they can turn the game into a campfire hentai game like they really want so they can fuck survivors hard as well. 
---
I want to be clear, I don't mind Nurse getting nerfed, what I mind that that they clearly didn't understand that the only reason people played her is because she's only one of three killers who can apply literally any map pressure with the generator speeds currently. Their response was not to deal with this issue as well but just to gut one of the only ones who could do it properly.
---
It's leading to a good idea, it's just not there yet. Just a question, what if it's only 2 or 3 people doing swf? Or 2 swfs?
---
Its not about spamming blinks its about map pressure. She just lost a fuck ton of it. Think clown. Yes he can end chases fast. But he has no map pressure to follow up with it. Nurse is not going to be anywhere near as good as billy and spirit.
---
That's nonsense. Blackbeard is still the best operator in the game because he can nullify 2-3 headshots. In a game where just 1 headshot means instant death, Blackbeard is the king of second chances.
---
His W/L and K/D ration on the top players is still massively above all other operators. Just look at Pengu lol
---
just like a good 4 man swf with instaheals and bnp is almost impossible and uncounterable... Only way to have a slight chance against a group like that was nurse and spirit. Any other killer and the killer is guaranteed to depip and have an extremely unfun match.
---
Count out three seconds in a chase with Nurse at base movement speed. It's not short.
---
Just horrible. They gutted sabateur so badly....
---
I also welcome this change.  
---
I am a killer main, but tbh I never enjoyed Nurses playstyle, because even hitting something "punished" you with a Line of Sight break / fatigue.  
---
I didn't like looking at the ground for 50% of the time.  
---
But the changes are gutting her really hard. I personally would even go as far and say that she will be jumping from S+ Tier to Low High Tier or High Mid Tier.  
---
What made Nurse so great was her power of ending chases quickly while also having really good map pressure/controll.  
---
Now she'll lose both.  
---
After your first double blink you'll fatigue and have to wait SIX seconds until you'll be able to double blink again.  
---
Within this time (after the fatigue) you'll be a killer which is slower than a survivor running.  
---
So if you need like 2-4 double blinks to get a hit off (which is common for everyone that isn't a 5k hrs god nurse) she becomes a mediocre killer on paper.  
---
Of course we'll have to see how it plays out on the PTB, but changing her power from: "No punishment after fatigue" to "six seconds recovery for 2 blinks aswell as still fatiguing" is a HUGE nerf to her.
---
Addon reworks
---
I don‚Äôt think she can speak bro. She‚Äôs turned feral.
---
Do you play on console? If you do I swear it's longer on PC
---
Better than Ledger that was just an angry dude dressed as Joker.
---
Spirit has had no major changes since release, she‚Äôs still just A tier
---
"Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you got stronger, right?"
---
Except that would be punishing solos, because why would randos give a shit you have a helmet on your head. So while you struggle to make sure you don't die they open the gates, start egc and now you're dead, simply because your teammates do not care about your survival, but themselves. Do you want even more SWF players? Because that is how you get them if you keep nerfing the solo experience.
---
Oh no poor sally, dethroned.
---
Well said i think itll play out alright for the girl
---
I saw this and decided to look over the changes. I don‚Äôt play Nurse (I‚Äôm a survivor main) but looking over her new add ons, I really like them. My favorite is probably the one where you blink past people and make them scream, sounds goofy/fun. I hope that killer mains and Nurse mains like them too.
---
You're heavily implying some
---
I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. They‚Äôre nerfing her base kit and playing on a controller and 30fps locked is hard enough. I don‚Äôt think the nurse being ‚ÄúThe Nurse‚Äù than ‚ÄúSpencer‚Äôs last breath‚Äùwill make her easier to play. Just means I‚Äôll still be moving slower than survivors and have to wait a total of 6 seconds to have a double blink to catch up.
---
They changed her add-ons to mostly useless things and gave her a 3 second cooldown to her blinks.
---
you caught me. how dare you?
---
Where do you get these numbers for her recharge time?
---
If that is the case then I am dying, I refuse to give up pepperoni pizza
---
Now if only they‚Äôd FINALLY start buffing lower tier killers
---
Wait what about Judith's
---
And it‚Äôs only on DBD
---
No, he was a child molester *and* murderer in the old movies.  Now he just molests them.
---
Well from your perspective, that sucks. You just wanna play the game and have fun (I assume). People DC'ing ruins your experience. 
---
And from my perspective, playing against spirit sucks, I just wanna have fun and play the game, but my last 30 games were all against spirit and I'm sick of getting killed in ways that feel unsatisfying. Playing against spirit generally ruins my experience, due to a number of reasons. A) a survivor(s) Dc's or suicides on 1st hook, B) Prayer Beads, C) I decided not to run Iron will for a game so bad luck I lose  
---
Don't get me wrong, both sides should be fun and balanced, but do you expect people to just be happy with dying to spirit all the time.
---
I'm not worried for Nurse mains, we're just gonna cry into gengrabber Spirit's schoolgirl uniform until they hopefully buff her back to reasonable levels
---
I don't disagree, why am I being downvoted? Maybe it's because I didn't make it clear what I meant.
---
The changes that are coming to Nurse on PTB are not going to make her a standard killer who breaks pallets and gets looped, she is still able to break the rules of the game that every other killer has to follow.
---
My personal opinion on how the killers rank as far as cuteness. :)
---
I'd say they buffed DS but gave it a slight condiction.

A hard nerf by Behavior. They removed nearly every add-on and changed some others. Some are good now but most are meme addons and the ones that increase the number of blinks are gone. The thing everyone's upset about though is that they added a 3 second cooldown between blinks, i.e you have to wait three seconds after you blink to get one blink back, and then three more to get the second one back.
---
you sound almost reasonable, downvoted
---
Pretty sure he means the changes are permanent for both sides. So if your SWF doesn‚Äôt have good communication it‚Äôs not gonna kill you but solo survivors still get their bonus. A full 4 stack doesn‚Äôt need the info so they either don‚Äôt use it or they can joke around more because they know when someone is going for the save.
---
When you see a stampede of bulls coming your way, you too will have a clear idea of what to expect, and will give level headed impressions. 
---
When you see that shit is about to hit the fan, you know how messy it will be, you don‚Äôt need clear ideas or level headed impressions.
---
You know what this is totally wrong I complain about any killer

‚ÄúFinally! I can play fun killers now!‚Äù

It‚Äôs a shitpost dammit

Imagine being me, wanting to occasionally use an iri head for the one hatchet sniping challenge.

I hope for your sanity and those around you that this is just the way you react ONLINE when you find someone with a different opinion who doesn't want to accept yours. 
---
It can't be nice for you to experience this level of being triggered. I feel for you.
---
Despite this I do respect your opinion, you are entitled to it.

Peace and love

After reading your conversation, I have a quick question. I'm not opining on which is worse, but am simply curious about your thoughts on another situation. 
---
What about rape ending in murder? Is that better than getting raped and left to survive, because you stop suffering? Again, I'm just curious about your thoughts on the matter. I'm not trying to make a point or anything. Thanks!
---
Either Mori or sacrifice each of the survivors 25 tines
---
Rite of the jaws can be the worst killer daily by far depending on survivors.
---
Ok, i am the only fucking unlucky person on the entire planet who gets only basement perk and shit addons
---
Fear The Powers.a
---
Demo, Sprit, and Pig belong in S!

The trapper is C rank. You clearly haven't seen Samination videos. https://youtu.be/GshKzNREMQg
---
Lhore.
---
No I mean this is just a blanket "Buff" so everyone is on the same level, then do blanket nerfs everywhere else. As it is, you can't balance survivors around either having or not having the information, since they may or may not have it (outside of BHVR's control), so if you ensure the survivors ALWAYS have the information, you can then nerf them elsewhere without screwing anyone over.
---
Excuse me, the demigorden is magnificent
---
Ye if you think spirit has counterplay then you are or frequently play against useless spirits. Im sorry u are by definition, wrong. I can go play spirit right now and EVERY. SINGLE. TIME... i use my phasewalk i will 100% of the time get a hit because i have the game sense(havelbro this aint @ u)
---
&gt; Its not about spamming blinks its about map pressure. She just lost a fuck ton of it. Think clown. 
---
There are only 2 people who have such high map pressure, Nurse and Billy.
---
Only nurse still has that pressure in indoor maps.
---
Spirit is arguably a better killer than billy because she doesn't suffer from looping. So "Think clown."
---
&gt;Nurse is not going to be anywhere near as good as billy and spirit.
---
Delusional, billy can be looped and only brings map pressure.
---
Spirit can't be looped but has less map pressure.
---
Nurse was superior at both, Now shes on par with spirit.
---
That's true, Wraith has some good add-ons. I was focusing more on base kit and how useful powers are in a chase.
---
Thank you for your answer. This is what I do more frequently, but in my experience, even in red ranks, the killer almost always leaves the hook, not without looking around a little while for the missing aura be did not see.
---
I use killers terror radius as a way of measuring if I I'm in the 40 meters (with some killers it's harder to do that either because they lack terror radius or because it's reduced).
---
Apart from the bloody outfits, is there any need to prestige? I‚Äôm on console if that‚Äôs at all is important?
---
She‚Äôs gonna be fine
---
I can already imagine Billy drifting around the neighbourhood for trick or treating, with all the turning add-ons
---
Do you put that purple crowbar up your ass everyday or only on special occasions?
---
Blinks are hard to do on controller &gt; new nurse relies on blinks for outplays and not general mobility.
---
I find it funny his ultra rare is "Wheel of Fortune but with the other addons"
---
my 4head can hear them fine
---
There is a magical feature called, scroll down.
---
When you don't wanna see something you can use this to make you feel better
---
I mean humans don't really conceptualize death when not at risk, this is why they tend to rate acts such as "rape" as more disturbing.
---
It's like the whole airplane vs. car debate.
---
You're more at risk driving a vehicle than you are flying in an airplane, but humans conceptualize death easier when at a great height and associate it in the context of airplanes and worst case scenarios more easily, so more people are afraid of flying than driving.
---
It's very possible to be more afraid of the thing you can conceptualize easier, even if it isn't the worst thing that could happen to you, this is why phobias tend to be nonsensical (like being afraid of spiders, for example) in general.
---
When 24 people die yearly (apparently in the UK) from champagne corks and only 6.6 people per 330 million (using US numbers) die from spiders in a year, are you more afraid of corked bottles than of spiders?
---
tier 3 lunge baby
---
"prayer beads are fine" bruh momento.  
---
also, my guy, maybe it's just me but I can hear footsteps perfectly fine
---
&gt;Most of the people who are asking for those things are genuinely people who just want more interactivity with the power
---
But that's not what I'm seeing. It's usually people just going "buff Pig, she deserves it, BHVR succs" or "ruleset no. 2 base fuck you". I've seen nothing but outrage and entitlement.
---
Killers be like: ‚ÄúbUt MuH nUrSe WaS bALaNcEd‚Äù
---
You better not be banging my bing bong boy.
---
Demogorgan for sure!
---
Shame on you, sweet nerevar.
---
Thank you for reminding me that subreddit exists. Time to wipe my memories again.
---
(Wait, what's 'wild' about learning languages in the first place?)
---
Billy without instasaw, also Demo is fun.
---
Devs are trying their best, but community will always complain.
---
That logic only works with a handful of killers though. Also, have you seen how incredibly unsafe 85% of the pallets are in the new map? Every killer can respect the pallets and just bloodlust everywhere now.
---
The main issue is several killers have weak kits and need buffs, and a lot of maps still have broken RNG in some spots. But general killer mechanics are pretty balanced right now, and I say that as a red rank killer.
---
The three seconds includes fatigue, which is already quite long. Sounds much worse than it is, she isn't dead.
---
Dont worry they suck. Big delay with big warning.
---
I don't think you understand what I'm saying when I said 'death penalty/rape penalty'. The death penalty is when someone is killed for their crimes, there's no such thing as a rape penalty. No one has ever been legally raped as a punishment. So why is it ok for the justice system to kill people as a punishment, but rape is off-limits? Even for rapists? 
---
&gt; even individuals mutilated from botched abortions still prefer being alive to being dead.
---
What the hell? Not only is that a really weird example, but I'm pretty sure not every mutilated person prefers life over death. There are plenty of cases of mutilated/defromed people wanting to die/committing suicide.
---
like i said, &gt;&gt;&gt;outside of chases&lt;&lt;&lt; you will be using double blink about 60 times, which means no picking up or hitting survs, i used 3 sec because you are waiting for 1 blink to recharge since the 1st of 2 charges during fatuige. So it still adds up. Unless they want to make nurse super addon reliant its a really over the top nerf.
---
Who knows maybe I'm just speaking for the people who I know play Pig as well as myself myself in general (Being a Pig main since release)
---
Don‚Äôt forget spirit can run stridor to counter iron will
---
not anyone with a flair such as yours
---
I‚Äôm a little worried. How will it work? Will it be like For Honor‚Äôs arcade mode? Is it just dailies with better rewards? I‚Äôm excited, but nervous on how it will turn out.
---
Without addons shes still the same nurse, but with cooldown on blinks.
---
Once you learn her yeah, she's giga-brainlet.
---
Let's start with, SWF is necessary, period.
---
About giving people the opportunity to communicate in-game, yeah, kinda like rainbow six siege or DotA. I won't mind, I won't use it and probably mute them all but can be a solution
---
I see many people that invites others to join a swf, even randoms of they see they are good. Happened to me too and it's kinda the same thing, but you cannot take swf away since was already established that they wanted it from the start
---
OoO is a double-sided sword.  
---
No aura reading perks? bruh, they might not be as usable but even then, gen pressure is a thing my guy.
---
Stop posting overused jokes. Big Pad hahahaha, good joke, big brain pig main amirite. Find new material.
---
Why is spirit better than nurse because last time I checked spirit can‚Äôt end games a minute after they start
---
I can smell the r17 survivor behind this comment
---
There will be free content with it too. Even if you don‚Äôt buy it, it will be an improvement.
---
I believe they said you can buy it with iridescent shards too.
---
Imagine maining Nurse and thinking she deserved to exist.
---
T. A Nurse player.
---
we spine chillin
---
Overused joke? I never seen someone post it here except me but ok. And by here I mean this sub
---
R1 on both sides.
---
But why would they do that? Don't you see the only way to balance the game is by making every good killer worse?
---
Pig is still viable to play though, her traps still slow the game down significantly enough to get kills.
---
For the usual Myers, it's essential that you get out of EW (Evil Withi 
---
n) 1 A.S.A.P......he then becomes a "normal" killer.  
---
HOWEVER, do realize that, while within EW1, your terror radius is next to nothing. If you encounter someone on a generator that is unaware of your presence - you may have a chance to snatch them right off of it for a free hook. Don't center your gameplay around this though - Survivors get more aware of their surroundings the more experience they get.   
---
In EW2, function as you would another M1 Killer. If you can score hits in a chase - great! If they manage to gain distance by looping - Stalk them as they keep it up until you are on the ***EDGE*** of getting EW3, like the other person stated. From here, only stalk when you are on a person's heels. EW3 will trigger immediately; this gives you a speed boost and a Devastating Lunge distance - enough to down this person, hook them, and look for more with a Full duration of it.
---
How about a speed lowering add on, but you can never get stuck/stunned on walls/rocks or someting?
---
Jezus im Polish And any of my friend never called my ,,Pan Gos'' even thou its my last name its just sounds so bizzare 2 me xD
---
Pretty bold of you to assume I don't already play against spirit every game and nothing else.
---
Except wasn't each of these met with significant community outcry?
---
"Something's wrong, I can feel it."
---
"Nerf the pig plz, just for me, oh and can you get rid of Billy, nurse, and spirit while your at it? No one plays as them anyways."
---
The biggest takeaways are:
---
They took away the add ons that gave her additional blinks. 
---
They added a cooldown so that after ‚Äúfatigue‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt get all (both) her blinks back right away. Three seconds after fatigue she gets one blink back, three seconds after that she gets the other blink. 
---
Nurse can still be good, but won‚Äôt be broken. No more five blinks fight after fatigue nonsense.
---
&gt; I would have preferred making her a 110% killer with one or two short blinks.
---
That's way worse than she currently is, in terms of skill needed to play and counterplay options
---
Collisions are bullshit
---
Why is it rewarding her for missing?
---
That's not how LF's chainsaw works though, I think he just gave it to him honestly
---
Isn't she 110?
---
Yeah she needs buffing but I've gotten so many 4 man's with that add-on even on the big maps like the farm
---
If its every single game sounds like an issue on your end
---
At least the bottle blinds them too.
---
I'm running no ruin killers atm because I want out of red ranks. 9/10 my first guy hooked will get to second phase because the fuckers are too greedy to get off the gens with their toolkits.
---
YES BHVR, all I wished was for Nurse to be ANOTHER WEAK M1 KILLER. ^please ^shoot ^me ^in ^the ^head
---
I really hope you dont actually take my flair seriously, as ive never used any of these, i always run nurse with no addons or mories or noed...
---
Just bought spirit and got 4k first game, no add one only 1 perk. Pretty OP
---
Now do the meme again but only with Pig. You all know it's true..
---
Trapper with schoolgirl outfit? That's new
---
Leatherface definitely doesn't belong in the "sipletons" category.
---
Thanks for the advice, man. :)
---
What will change besides addon again? I read designer notes and only saw addon changes... Sorry if I'm missing something here...
---
They're going to make Thompson's Mix and Carburettor Tuning Guide into Very Rare or worse, I know it :(
---
It's fookin Ded 'ard
---
But nursing nurse does not make spirit Sure she might be s tier but there are still ways to counter her and if you face only spirits brim a build that destroys spirits and be more stealthy
---
Nerfing
---
Ok let's break it down..
---
&gt;I played spirit a fucking lot. I know how it looks on both sides.
---
No sht, me too. Bad point since anyone can say the same if they play like me, or you I guess, both sides
---
&gt;You also totally ignored the point of this comment. it's a reply to my opinion, listing the usual complaints. I said that I LIKE playing against her, but only until I get injured.
---
She can't see you nor blood, but look at that. You're at a pallet. Spirit stops.
---
Yeah, and she's a 110% m/s killer. Yeah you're at a pallet and she stops, so you keep moving again juking too manipulating your scratch marks, something I always do and she hardly land a hit on me. 
---
She's slow and if you play both sides, even without the new perk, you know how your scratch marks looks and how to throw people off
---
&gt;Do you stay or walk away (cuz going toward her is death 90% of the time)?
---
Said before
---
&gt;Every good spirit will wait a moment before phasing to see what you do.
---
If you stay, she'll phase, get to you, bump into you and hit you
---
If you walk away, she'll see where you're going, phase in that direction, bump into you and hit you
---
Scratch marks manipulation. I mean, I do that already with normal killers, do it against somebody that can't see me is even easier. I usually look for a safeish area so if at the end of the phase she can chase me for a while and hit me I have a pallet before she can phase again
---
&gt;If you are injured, you might as well DC at this point. You are dead with no counterplay.
---
The speed difference between Spirit phasewalking and you walking regularly is too big for you to outplay her.
---
If you're injured and DC, you're a coward. Actually you're a coward if you dc period. Anyway if you think you have no counterplay when you can slow vault, throw a pallet and walk away to throw her off or use iron will, it's kinda silly
---
Especially when bhvr fucks up sounds every time.
---
&gt;and no. Iron Will is not a good perk. It's only good against Spirit and kinda good against Nurse. It's 100% worthless against the rest. I don't care that the other killers can hear me, they still have to get to me a fair way and they probably also see me. Stridor's existance also makes your point about it redundant.
---
Aaaaand there you go, you won't adapt and think iron will is garbage for no reason because the others have to loop so who cares right?
---
Stridor.. wow really? Okay let's explain this
---
Iron will makes your sounds while injured be muted. So, any killer with headphones, will also rely on sounds to figure out where you are when they can't see you, faking a vault, q&amp;q a locker and so on. So it's useful with EVERY killer, just because you won't change your loadout isn't an excuse.
---
Stridor. Nobody uses it since take an entire perk slot that is more useful for other detection perks, like bbq or nurse. It kinda counter iron will, true, but their grunt still pretty low and harder to detect even using stridor my dear
---
&gt;I spend most of the match injured and half of my build is spend for information perks. My build is: 
---
So you have a fixed build like I guessed.. you know you are often injured and still don't use iron will..
---
There are only 4 perk slots sure but you can take off adrenaline or bond for iron will. Isn't that difficult, especially when instead of bond you can just use your eyes. I used bond for a fair amount of time and I don't anymore because I expect where everyone is now
---
&gt;There are only 4 perks I can run. I can't counter everything and there's nothing in my build I could drop for a piece of shit of a perk that only works against one killer
---
Already debunked that works with one killer. Plus bond is way more useless compared to iron will that gives you an edge against everyone while bond just gives you an information that, if you're slightly experienced, you don't need.
---
I compare bond to window of opportunity, useful to learn, useless after that learning curve
---
You were in the wrong
---
The charge tome starts at the beginning of her fatigue not after. So its recharging while in fatigue.
---
Sure, you can do good with them, but if you put time and effort into any of the 3 top killers then you'll consistenly do better than any other killer.
---
I thought it's for 16 seconds but with a cooldown of 60 seconds.
---
No, my main problem with spirit is how unstoppable she is in certain situations. While she isn't overpowered if you consider her vs 4 other players. But 1 on 1, you are often left in no win situations as a survivor. At a loop or a bit of cover, against other killers you get some feedback, but against spirit you just have to guess which way to go. 
---
People say its a mindgame, but it isn't. Its a tracking game that the spirit is playing and you don't really any agency in these situations. Against competent spirit players, unless you have Iron will, you haven't got much chance. What happens is you go down in ways that feel unsatisfying, that feel inevitable and thats where a lot of the frustration and complaints come from.
---
It was funny how all the morons on this subreddit played her for 4 minutes on the PTB and then ran with complaints about her being too weak (admittedly that was before her slight recovery time buff), until they started getting murdered by actual decent killer players who were playing her on live, and they changed their tune pretty damn fast.
---
I had a game where some chick blinded me when my face was in a wall.
---
Harry Warden "The Miner" from My Bloody Valentine and The Collector "The Collector" from The Collector/The Collection would be awesome. 
---
   
---
The Creeper from Jeepers Creepers would be neat but I know some peoples stance on the director makes that the most unlikely.
---
So.... You were the troll all along!?! Provoking me on a post about grieving and laughing at me :'{
---
you're mad that a killer who has an unrelentless, map ignoring power is getting balanced so survivors actually stand a chance against her?
---
They might have waited long but they sure brought the heavy guns
---
I have friends who will dc on spirit. She is a problem
---
Read it again. Recharge starts at the beginning of fatigue, while fatigued you are recharging your next blink, once out of fatigue you have 0.5 seconds to wait to blink again or 3.5 seconds to blink twice.
---
Killer behaviour depends on the killer and situation - for example, mobile killers don't have to worry about being baited as much as a slower killer would.
---
If you're able to see the carried survivor then you can estimate your distance by the size of their model. This is a good skill to develop in general, especially if you're going to play as killer (because there's a sporting chance you'll be using Barbecue &amp; Chilli).
---
Just based off that im guessing you dont know what a mori does so let me just be helpful and tell you,
---
READ THE FUCKING DESCRIPTION
---
Blinks don‚Äôt recharge while nurse is fatigued
---
OoO is only double sided if you're bad or solo.
---
If you're a competent player you can run the killer for at least 5 minutes guaranteed. Killer ignores you? You're free to do gens and tell your teammates exactly where the killer is.
---
That's the problem, she is fine base kit as is, she is a chase heavy killer and needs her blinks because she is slower than survivors
---
Put me on the hook next to you then and I'll ask "first time?" as the spirit phases away
---
Their add ons are the same.
---
Not really. There's a slight increase in the quality of your add-ons, but even if you could notice it there's still the problem of not all higher-level add-ons being created equally.
---
Steve?
---
It just adds even more distance since you can't course correct if you fumble the blink or just straight up guess wrong. Jungle gyms will become even more hellish
---
Pull up the quick menu and look into the 'currently playing with' section.
---
If I'm remembering everything correctly...
---
It is basically Daily Rituals, but they are more difficult/specific (For example, one of the quests shown was "Catch 2 Survivors in Bear Traps as The Trapper shortly after they perform a vault.") but give out more rewards, like more Bloodpoints, lore entries and the aforementioned cinematics. It's also a sort of bloodweb progression system where beating a challenge will unlock more challenges. You can also unlock new cosmetic items called Charms that you can equip on both Survivors and Killers.
---
Now they just need to remove Spirits prayer beads then I will be a happy camper.
---
&gt; Nurse‚Äôs kit 100% was completely fine
---
Ignored every mechanic in the game survivors could use against killers.
---
Long Answer:
---
Supposedly it also slightly increases your chances of getting higher rarity addons and offerings, but people have experimented with it and the improve is insignificant if it even exists.
---
Short Answer:
---
If the killer is appearing online survivors can hold down the middle circle button and go to currently playing with.
---
If the killer isn't appearing offline they will show up there and if they have their messages public can get messages from survivors.
---
Personally, I won't be buying the Rift Pass. I'm fine with just doing the normal Archives quest.
---
rood
---
So now we're going from a killer that was in perfect balance while addonless and turning her into one that needs a crutch of using one and only useful line of perks. Nice.
---
I think they should remove injured sounds and leave collision in.
---
Ah yes because the game's balance would be thrown completely out of whack if a perk had a different name. It would be pandemonium! There would be panic in the streets as suddenly Legion and Plague become top tier with their new perk "Traumatophobia"!
---
Sounds great to be honest, increases the gap between good and bad Nurses, while Survivors also finally get properly rewarded for dodging her blinks instead of just surviving 5 seconds longer.
---
Even when I'm a Legacy 3 Nurse, I really appreciate this change. Haven't touched her for such a damn long time just because she felt absolutely unfair once a certain skill level has been reached. Maybe I might enjoy playing her once again without feeling like a total dick.
---
I don‚Äôt really see how.. Hangman‚Äôs has always done that... and is rarely ever used at that.
---
r/uselessnobody
---
Take my upvote you troll
---
they arent good killers, they're overpowered. Good is Billy, Freddy, Plague, GhostFace. Real nurse mains who dont use addons will probably enjoy the challenge of the cooldown. multi blink abusers that uses addons to make up for their mistakes are gonna go bye bye though.
---
Xenomorph killer with Ripley as a survivor
---
Yeah, such a rank 17 thing that tru3 talent, the biggest spirit main, said it is op
---
Director of the Jeepers Creepers films is a convicted child sexual abuser of a 12 year old.  So people don't want BHVR to give him money.     
---
I hear they're in talks of making a 3rd Collector film, which would be awesome.
---
It says they do
---
Hour? Lol more like 20 minutes
---
I‚Äôd say Michael is more ‚Äúpure evil‚Äù like he‚Äôd probably kill every last person on earth if he could. Freddy is more sadistic/cruel he won‚Äôt kill everyone, only the week and powerless when they‚Äôre most vulnerable and scared.
---
Im red rank playing mainly trapper, wraith, myers, ghostface. Spirit has higher occurence but variety is still there at ared ranks
---
I think it's just disgustingly lazy change. There is no skill you can master that can neutralize that particular handicap, it's a dumb cooldown. It will not hurt her chase, especially for veterans, as much as it will hurt her map pressure terribly
---
man i just said gen grabber spirit is op
---
Per Peanits, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cyq8lo/weekly_no_stupid_questions_thread_september_02/eyvzulg/):
---
&gt; *The rate match score doesn't do anything on its own, but it's used by our team to spot trends (e.g. Almost every time someone plays X killer on Y map, they give it a low score). It's just an extra way for us to get feedback from a wide range of people rather than the few who go to forums, Reddit, etc.*
---
it‚Äôs so aids
---
Pig main‚Äôs be like ‚Äúfirst time?‚Äù
---
Thats the best change of them all, and it was very very necessary.
---
Being able to blink through walls and close distance with your power is undoubtedly the most powerful ability a killer can have. With that in mind, it's just utterly dumb that the nurse can use the most powerful tool in the game, and if she messes up, she doesn't get punished, and she can just try again.
---
Finally, now you have to play well and not just brainlessly blink around the map with infinite blinks.
---
E.G. :
---
Legion misses 1 attack, his entire power is gone.
---
Nurse misses an attack after blinking 5 times -&gt; 3 second fatigue, then try again.
---
This is ridiculous, considering that the strength of their powers aren't even comparable.
---
&gt;!I do agree that her base movement speed could be increased if these nerfs go through though.!&lt;
---
I read all your research on nanotechnology really brilliant
---
I believe she is. The common complaint is that she's on Nurse's level, but takes way less skill. Basically, the pre-nerf Legion argument. Yeah, Spirit can be annoying, but really all they have to do is make survivors sound omni-directional to herself while she's phasing. Two-way street: her whooshing sound is omni directional, so cries of pain should be too.
---
I think the only difference is they slightly buffed her power recovery time. And that was actually shortly after they released her on live, come to think of it.
---
The only thing they changed was the voice. It used to be softer and ghostlier less Waluigi.
---
No amount of damage control will save that...
---
You can still tele through walls and all loops, she is still exceptionally powerful assuming you know how to aim. 
---
If anything the change to Nurse showing you where she is teleporting too is a bigger nerf but even then it doesn't change the fact that she removes all survivor counterplay outside of hiding or exhaustion perks. She likely won't even move out of S tier given that her ability, even forcefully limited to 2, is the best in the game. 
---
The main nerf from exhaustion is map presence which is a GOOD nerf as you shouldn't need more than 2 blinks to down a survivor as is.
---
What the hell happened that the Nurse isnt best killer?
---
I mean yea she still has loop denial. Not as strong as wraith but she has it. But how do you expect to body block people you cant catch? She is... painfully slow. I understand why, but she needs more in the way of slowing down the game. A means for either activating traps herself, or the traps just having some kind of timer that activates. They dont tick while shes in close proximity, so tunneling someone with a helmet wouldnt exactly work in her favor if this change were made. She could also just have the ability to put other traps on shit, like in the movies. Like put a trap on a certain vault location, or add a beartrap attachment that gives a skill check when you unhook someone with one on, requiring them to pass a skill check. Just all these little things that can really play into the theme and just slow the game down ever so slightly.
---
Tbh, I don't really like the original killers. There's just something about playing as a famous or super well designed character that really kills. I don't mind one every now and then, but I wouldn't really play Clown over Pennywise or Legion over Norman Bates.
---
battle pass? for a game you have to buy?
---
He had infectious fright (which makes people who get picked up the obsession btw) in the video- I am the guy who got saved and I don‚Äôt run DS lol
---
You have to press space of whatever button you use for skillchecks.

Oh yeah. All the coughing and throwing up survivors are doing basically gives you radar.
---
ah, I see. Thanks!
---
You need to press another button after starting the medkit animation, for me on Xbox it‚Äôs the same button you use for skill checks so I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs space on PC
---
Nerf the randomness of the beartrap buff her lunge and make her crouch instantly like the goat face
---
This man on 4chan lol
---
To be honest, Nurse mains will just keep playing like before.
---
It took me so long to find the spirits face üòÇ
---
Since xmas is coming up, lets throw in the Gingerdead Man for good measure
---
Slay queen slay
---
Nurse wasn‚Äôt ruined everyone is severely overreacting. Good Nurse players will still be good. The people who relied on quintuple blink or omega blink add-ons,
---
Please tell me you didn't end up using your mori or I would lose all my faith in humanity if you did.
---
This meme will age well.
---
11/10 Would upvote twice
---
read too many greentexts lately, lmao
---
Of course Ghostface the beta male would OD on Axe body spray XL.
---
Why is bubba there, he would be the kinda guy who pressed e and then proceeded to rev his chainsaw
---
honestly it‚Äôs just way too distracting imo lol
---
Ok, what about it?
---
It was more just eating because it was fed.  Not like it could fight back in slug mode
---
I knew Hag was a fucking Karen
---
I‚Äôm assuming, but who knows maybe bhvr will pull a sneaky on us
---
Infectious fright doesn‚Äôt change obsession. It makes people scream if they are near someone the killer downed.
---
wouldnt load for me ;-;
---
It's all good ‚úå
---
Oh wow you were serious this time
---
So I  have all 4 of them and can I just say how hard it was to get Jakes nobody plays him lol
---
The only OP killer is current nurse, which theyre toning down finally. I wish all killers would be on spirit/billy level
---
every kill your friends ever... feels so bad mang
---
Ok I‚Äôll let this slide but if you make one for there hotness, clown best be S tier
---
 Oh sick
---
It works pretty poorly to be honest...
---
More seriously, since the last update, you can be paired in a 6 rank range of your current rank, if I understood that correctly. Meaning, as rank 14, youcan be paired from 20 to 8 (extreme cases).
---
Ye
---
yes but just because someone has a highish rank doesn‚Äôt mean they are good. it‚Äôs the people who get to rank 1 in the first few days after rank reset you should be scared of.
---
Booster Myers Map was an absolute blessing.
---
You get that its nowhere near as simple as y'all are acting like it is right?
---
#**UNDERSTANDABLE, HAVE A NICE DAY**#
---
Congrats! I just hit rank 5 last night!
---
1st time outside in the night away from a safe house will always be the scariest shit
---
you're telling me the horror movie buff is only handing out regular candy bars? Not running a haunted house or some shit? BLASPHEMY
---
Spirit is fine, just get rid of prayer beads
---
Well yes, you definetly can. And that is by actually going for "risky" blinks. As in, attempt to get that Survivor in one Blink from a certain distance. I personally was always sick of Nurses that just abused her 1st blink to get as close as possible and just tapped M2 to get a free hit you literally couldnt juke thanks to this in pairing with her lunge range.
---
It will hurt her chase when you play against good Survivor that actually know how to mindgame and stealth against a Nurse. Many people just ain't aware of how to do so, so many Nurse's have absurdely easy chases. Instead of baiting directions once being out of her Line-Of-Sight, they just keep running and hope they won't get hit.
---
I actually think this rewards good Nurses aswell as good Survivors, while bad Nurses get punished really hard.
---
Those r dreads
---
the dedicated servers were always doomed to fail. Everyone loved freddy. The only people complaining are nurse mains who never learned a real killer XD
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear, they increased the sound plague pools are cleaning and her drinking from them again? Let loose the gong of death.
---
Blinking works the same as it did before: Charge it, chain it, fatgue. 
---
The change is that your blinks are now tied to a cooldown after use, 3 seconds for the first CD and 6 total for both if I'm understand right so you can no longer blink RIGHT after the foot staring animation if you used both blinks prior.
---
Against survivors changes nothing but forcing Nurse to walk after a double blink hit but it still allows her to blink after using the last one so you can still down in 2 blinks like before. It makes her map presence smaller which is a really change with the only other one I don't see anyone talking about is how there is now a visual effects showing where Nurse will end after her tele which may be slightly useful.
---
Russian nickname. Thats it
---
They actually stated quite some time ago, that they were considering some changes to her base kit too, but nothing had been decided on yet. And to be frank, this change was needed. A good nurse was straight up inescapable, she had too much pressure in  a chase.
---
Red ranks... That's your problem
---
Most people were already calling for Spirit nerfs before Nurse's changes were announced.
---
I get where you're coming from but Freddy also killed those kids he molested
---
Yes... She is?
---
I really like the charm idea.  I hope they have a piggy one :3   
---
~~fingers crossed for iri shards rift~~
---
Ultra Rares have a tendancy to either be useless gimmicks or part of their killer's most powerful build, though. What current ultra rares are there that you'd consider to be a good example of how they all should be?
---
I wish my Head On hitbox was that big.
---
Yes they do. Read the notes from yesterday my dude.
---
You right
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt think this will change her spot in the Meta all that much. Sure it‚Äôs a nerf but it‚Äôs really more of reworking Nurse to fit modern mechanics.
---
Maybe that should be an option or an addon, could be cool
---
You need to understand that at its core, this is a PC game, and on PC, good nurses were straight up oppressive. The changes both make her considerably easier to learn, and less obnoxious.
---
The only way I'd be ok with emotes is if I could also buttdance with survivors.
---
&gt;She can still ignore everything and deliver the big "no" to loops.
---
Yeah bc she's designed to. But now it's one missed blink and suddenly she's screwed
---
I want wraith to wrap his legs around my head
---
That's the undetectable addon they're gonna add

Will come back to this post in 3587 to see if it's true. :)
---
It probably isn't. :)
---
It''s a glitch/exploit, hackers are only on PC.
---
Nah, some of the add-ons are okay. The ones that give you Nurses Calling or Stridor on blink hits come to mind.
---
Sex
---
nah, its at 69 now
---
I disagree. Legion are just regular teens who happen to like murder, and other crime. They shouldn't be grouped with who they are
---
Nerfing swf is stupid. The game is based around  teamwork. But gens being done too fast i will agree with but have no idea how to fix them. I guess we just need more prominent gen slowing perks like ruin or more killers with heavier map pressure.
---
Fairly Odd Parents meme *and* Canada meme?
---
This started off my day well.
---
When you forget if you're still wiggling or on the hook
---
I like the idea but I think they change the killer to much, a major problem for nurse mains with add ons is that they lose all muscle memory
---
Seems fair to me
---
except ghostface is stealthy for the first hit, and the nurse is stealthy for the second one !
---
With Iron will, sprint burst, and spine chill
---
In an alternate reality wraith is god tier
---
something like trappers self-setting traps, mirror myers or hags shoe/hand that removes her teleport(yes i know, only 2 of these are ultra rare). keeps core gameplay but still changes how you play as and against the killer a lot. i get that even finding something like that thats fun for both sides is hard but that stuff is fun
---
Looking at the add-ons, the changes could actually make nurse a little easier for most console players.
---
Did you say this about the original Mettle of Man or did you just know it was broken already?
---
Can't wait for the folks to start crying again once the recognize that really good Nurses will keep whooping asses.
---
She had no bad side before. She could end chases instantly and for free, she could get across all maps in no time and she beats everyone that isn't using an exhaustion perk. 
---
At least now she won't be god tier at patrolling 5 gens for free.
---
I can hear footsteps yes... but all sounds are important to her
---
And what about stridor? Would it even work? Or force spirits to use stridor just for normal sounds again? 
---
Spirit doesn‚Äôt need her base power nerfed at all...
---
Did you see how they changed the power?
---
Thank you! If the challenges are like that, they shouldn‚Äôt be *too* bad. Now I‚Äôm all hype!
---
Nurse base isn‚Äôt overpowered LUL.
---
I really hope you just forgot your /s at the end of your comments cause I find it hard to believe you are this delusional. 
---
oh man nurse mains are funny individuals.
---
Still not as OP as the average survivor
---
No longer spam double blink, the cooldown is the same length as the feetsies animation so you only waste 3 seconds in control after a double blink in which she has to wait. 
---
So it means next to nothing in chases and hurts her map presence most.
---
Plus she can still be OP on console
---
Jokers trick
---
So can someone explain how exactly they nerfed the nurse? Or at least send me in the right direction of an article bc i don‚Äôt know where to go for information on this game
---
Agreed. I know this community dislikes Noob3 but I really like him. Recently, I've actually enjoyed him more than ever. Seems more chill and relatable.
---
Sure, but how many times would a PC player get a message after their beef on the postgame chat?
---
The base kit nerfs aren't even that bad
---
You typed ‚Äúmeme‚Äù five times in two sentences.
---
this doesn't make any sense should it be the other way around !? and again playing with your friends isn't toxic. LOL it is op than solo queue BUT NOT toxic and you should not do it
---
I think your mom might be able to help
---
Rule Set should just be base tbh
---
I'm a console player, I've never seen non-baby nurse, and I rarely see huntress
---
I love playing basement chest guardian. I don't have insidious but I like that survivors can find me in the basement quickly and they'll run around all silly until they realize I'm trying to protect the chest. If anyone touches it or manages to open it they get basement hooked.
---
Same
---
Spirit is worse than nurse as it‚Äôs a pure guessing game of we‚Äôre shel be. At least the nurse you have a chance to dodge her attacks.
---
I feel like I have to run it since I mostly play Bill and if I don‚Äôt have it on, the killer can hear his damn coughing across the whole map.
---
Im sorry but yall heard of walking if you hear her phase walking. Its so easy to counter spirit
---
I also wanna throw discord in there, cause it's helped a good bit, too. Just if anyone is still reading ;)
---
If they left her in this state then she probably won't be that viable no more at high rank but they will probably make some changes when everyone realizes she sucks when the ptb is out.
---
Please reply to this comment so I can give you second upvote.
---
Anna doesnt even speak tho.
---
Except for Plague. She'd only serve barf
---
Insidious + iridescent button on Legion. Now you don't hear me, now I'm effing everywhere.
---
As survivor I tail killers, trying to stay right behind their back without them noticing.
---
True, but this was also the case with Freddy, It‚Äôs just a new thing and most nurse mains that I know often don‚Äôt use addons and I know they‚Äôre very excited to try something new
---
Agreed (yes, the name is Frank)
---
Yep, been there
---
&gt;The only way you're getting fucked by this nerf is if you need to use 3-9 blinks to land a hit in order to compensate for your lack of skill.
---
Lemme do some math for you real quick. 
---
Her base fatigue stun after 2 blinks is 2.5 seconds. A survivor runs at 4 m/s meaning that in that 2.5 seconds, they will cover about 9 meters. Now if you opt to wait the .5 second for one blink, the distance becomes 11 meters and the Survivior will probably widen that gap further while running if you charge that blink. 
---
Now let's say you deign to wait for your second blink to come back. Now you have to wait 3.5 seconds after your 2.5 second fatigue. In 3.5 seconds a survivor running at 4m/s will cover 14 meters. So 14+9=23. 
---
Nurses initial blink only carries her 20 meters. Meaning you will need a fully charged blink AND a full chainblink to have a hope at covering this gap since Surviviors will still be running while you are charging a blink. 
---
This gets worse when you account for exhaustion perks. Let's say someone sprint bursts right when her fatigue starts. Over 3 seconds they will immediately cover 18 meters, plus another 12 from the remaining 3 seconds if Nurse waits for her second blink, which brings that up to 30 meters, where Nurse cannot catch a survivor WITHOUT more blinks. 
---
You wanna know why I'm saying this nerf is awful? Because it is. It was an unnecessary, hamfisted nerf that needlessly cripples her. Nurse is the hardest killer in the game, but she should be the hardest bc of the skill required, not the constraints on her. If they wanted to, as they describe, offer a longer window of opportunity to escape her, they can and should have increased her fatigue stun to 3.5 seconds. That gives Surviviors time to cover 14 meters instead of the original 9, which can make the difference between juking her and getting downed. 
---
And this nerf gets even more smelly when you look at some of these add-ons but I'll focus on one in particular: Campbells. Campbells was reworked so that if you fully charge ur blink, you will automatically blink again when you come out of your blink. Who tf thinks that this is a good idea? Now that her blinks are a precious resource she can't be going around blasting her second blink like it means nothing. 
---
Oh and as for this. 
---
&gt;The fucking changes aren't even on the PTB yet so what the fuck are you crying about?
---
I didn't need the PTB to know the hot off the rework Decisive strike was gonna be awful. I didn't need the PTB to know that Mettle of Man was going to be gamebreaking. Experienced players don't need to test every single change to know that it's an awful one. If they nerfed Adrenaline so that you didn't instaheal and you didn't get the speed boost if you were hooked or being carried, and they made it stop ignoring exhaustion, I highly doubt you would say "it's just the PTB bruh let's just test the changes and stop crying"
---
A year ago, in her PTB, almost everyone was saying about Spirit that she is the worst killer in the game and now, she is considered the best. How much things can change.
---
Mori all Steves so you don't have to hear their scream.
---
I think they should add a tier system for debuffs 
---
For example:
---
2 player swf -they stay normal 
---
3 player swf - can only bring 3 perks (and maybe 1 less addon to items). OR. cause them to have a slower gen time
---
4 player swf- can have 2 perks each (maybe no add ons) OR. Cause them to have even slower gen time 
---
Solos would stay the same and swf would have a little nerf so killers of all types won‚Äôt be massacred
---
just don't get injured ez /s
---
‚ÄòReduce their gen speed per party member‚Äô
---
Kek
---
This is exciting. Can't wait for this to be fully implemented. Hopefully all of it makes it!
---
&gt; she is still exceptionally powerful assuming you know how to aim.
---
If you have to wait 6 seconds after each double-blink it shrinks her power by a lot.
---
&gt; She likely won't even move out of S tier given that her ability, even forcefully limited to 2, is the best in the game.
---
Lets see about that.
---
I really hate the use of "SS tier" There is already a term for what that is, it is S tier. That describes something that is so far above everything else in the game that it makes all other choices irrelevant. And as good as spirit is, she is not the nurse, and she is not so good as to make other killers irrelevant.
---
I like playing spirits the most. Prayer beads can suck my nuts but getting into mind game battles with spirits is my favorite.
---
Ghostface is easily my least favorite. Free hit thirsty mother fucker lol
---
&gt;I think the nerf to the base power is beyond what the dev team outlined
---
It is beyond what they outlined. People didn't like this Nurse rework as a concept because they were afraid BHVR was gonna Legion the Nurse. I tried to defend them and said that Nurse needs these changes. And it's true that she needs changes, and some (I repeat, SOME) of the add-on reworks are good. But that base power nerf is what changed the entire ballfield.
---
https://youtu.be/WH9XdpMzH_E
---
You were saying...
---
It's not clear what exactly the entity can do, but I think it steals the soul of the person or thing in this case and copys thier would be form.
---
 It would explain why killers like Freddy's powers are "Modified", it's leading the reporting survivors to believe its only doing this because it has a choice to when in actually it is putting a front on to cover it from having a limited power.
---
 Afterall if my memory serves me correctly it can't control the Hatch and its not explained why Hatch is there, and we only have knowledge in the form of memos left by survivors who themselves don't truly understand what it can do only what it seems to have done.
---
Yeeaaahh no. Plague would serve you vomit, so she belongs in poison tier. Spirit probably would make you a good traditional Japanese bento, unless she has a grudge against you. So bump her up to feast tier.
---
Exactly. People don't seem to get this.
---
Honestly, I think the console PC gap between nurses will be smaller now
---
I can't tell if you're joking but a mori is a single use perk that allows you to kill survivors, instead of hooking and waiting a while for them to get sacrificed.
---
That would be true if they buffed her speed but she's still slower than survivors.
---
But if he's out, won't his porchlight be off?
---
I actually started to see more Spirits playing without add-ons or just with common add-ons and dominate chases and applying pressure without problems.
---
&gt;if she hits someone after blinking, she goes up to 4.6m/s for one minute.
---
Caveat is that for this one minute she loses her ability to blink.
---
There's a whole movie series dedicated to what he does on Halloween.
---
But... If I‚Äôm close enough to hear you anyway, you won‚Äôt be able to hide from me with any killer
---
And once again. If they nerfed sound it wouldn‚Äôt change that. Because every spirit would use stridor as a must have...  then you would STILL be forced to run iron will...  so I don‚Äôt see how nerfing her sounds help you
---
He's definitely no saint...
---
Not funny .didn't laught
---
Aren't we all?
---
This implies that the survs only do gens and leave their teammates on hook. It also implies that the nurse player isn't good in the first place. Chases last less than 20 seconds with nurse as of now, a 30 second chase is way above average in high ranks. Any killer without instadown capabilities closing a chase in sub 30 is pretty good.
---
Dead by daylight story mode is the thing I‚Äôm most excited for, cannot wait to dive Into the lore of this game
---
Decent Montage, I'd guess the Ghostface was camping you cause of OoO (which many killers hate)
---
Lmao cmon. Shes not that shit on console
---
Could be good with infectious fright as well, i wonder if the screams would count as bloodpoints, i know it shouldnt but this game is wonky as all hell at times.
---
Isn't that literally everything; it becomes second nature? IIRC, learning a skill is something like:
---
Unconscious value: you don't see value in a skill
---
Conscious value: You can see the value of a skill. 
---
Conscious skill: you're getting good at skill, but it takes a lot of focus
---
Unconscious Skill: your practice has made your skill second nature. 
---
Also, predicting survivors is a lot harder the higher their rank, and breaking line of sight can easily become a guessing game of where to go next. Unless you can read minds. Jk... unless?
---
Thank you for saying it. People are acting like she's going to be the worst killer in the game after this update.
---
That woman who transforms in Micheal Jackson is the scariest thing ever
---
Same age as the entity
---
But you can see that he stunned the killer
---
Owner of the #AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Too bad extra blinks is shitty unless u only played that anyway, since extra blinks means fucked up muscle memory
---
From my opinion, Survivor Stereotypes would be..
---
Dwight:Always hides in the locker and is an absolute baby at the game.
---
Meg:Gotta go fast, always getting killed or accidentally sandbagging or trying to loop the killer. Generally fails at objective and common sense.
---
Claudette:Absolutely Non existent the entire game and is toxic as hell.
---
Jake:Sabotaging the hooks and trying to be a team player.
---
Nea:The Embodient Of Toxicity, But always a slippery fucker sometimes.
---
Laurie:Usually is very altruistic and good at stalling the killer for extended periods of time along with stabby stabby decisive strike.
---
Ace:Always check the basement for him, he might be looting them chests.
---
Bill:An absolute lad who will either carry the team or die trying to save you from the hook near the endgame.
---
Feng:I actually have no idea what her stereotype is.
---
David:So altruistic that it actually hurts to be saved by him.
---
Quentin:The OG at being a boss, being the rarest Pok√©mon to catch.
---
David:The absolute objective gen jockey, always doing gens and is generally good at saving people and stalling. But is usually always found first cause he‚Äôs doing OBJECTIVES.
---
Kate:Sexy bitch But usually panics or is ready to lay down all the pallets.
---
Adam:DC‚Äôs as soon as he is found first or tries to get his deliverance fast as HUMANLY possible even if it risks his life or yours. Also throws a lot of pebbles.
---
Jeff:He is the true Jesus, he will fight and kick to save everyone as he is Jesus.
---
Jane:Damn is she a thicc ass kiwi you‚Äôd just suck on all day.
---
Ash J. Williams:Hail to the king, baby. Usually either the most altruistic, objective, or bold motherfucker combined to try and do it. 
---
Nancy:Where did NOED go?
---
Steve:Currently at some form of baby status but is definitely going to try to be a hero for all.
---
But you can see the obsession changed upon the killer being stunned. He must have stunned him at the same frame that he was stunned by DS.
---
Head on by far. It is such a meme to use and its even funnier in a SWF
---
Don't give me ideas or else we're getting All-Star themed montage where all the clips are swamp instead of a Halloween special
---
I wasn't really talking about the nurse hate, I'm rather about, why do people want to hurt my the spirit? What is so broken about her? I know why nurse is broken on PC, but spirit? Is it her movement speed? Or invisibility? Or something?
---
I hope they buff low tier killers and leave top tier as-is.
---
Top killers don't need nerfs. Nurse needed add-on changes not a rework. They're doing ham fisted nerfs on nurse and it's extremely disappointing.
---
Her add-ons are not fine. I give you an example:
---
Wraith has add-ons that increase movement speed while cloacked but decrease the movement speed after uncloacking.
---
Spirit has add-ons that increase movement speed while phasing, but she doesn't have a debuff for that and she is stronger than Wraith.
---
Her add-ons make her op, especially Prayer Beads.
---
That's why when I play with friends I don't talk about the game. They try to be all tactical and I just joke around. Most of the reason is because I love watching a Pig crouch towards my friend and listening to the impending screams.
---
This still means that the Killer is spending one perk slot on Stridor instead of something else. And honestly if someone wants to use Stridor that's fine. I just think that it's horrible design for almost the entire counterplay to a Killer being "run this perk or get cucked."
---
For the record I'm not just saying disable Spirit's sound while phasing entirely. I'm not going to elaborate entirely on my point-of-view on Spirit in a meme lol. I think that Spirit should be affected by the Deafened status effect (Hag's Disfigured Ear addon's effect) while phasing, and Prayer Beads could be reworked to allow Spirit to hear while phasing.
---
However there are a few options to buff Spirit to compensate for the nerf. An idea I saw awhile ago is that Spirit could be able to see bloodstains on base (IE Father's Glasses), as this fits her character theme a lot more. Spirit is meant to be unable to see you but track your tracks on the ground to chase you. She isn't meant to be able to hear you in an alternate dimension and then appear behind you. While I think this has a lot more counterplay than hearing pained grunts (you can try to hide blood in tall grass or try to fake the Killer out with your bloodstains) I do realize that this does sort of bring us to a ground zero where nothing is accomplished. With that in mind I also think that 115% movement is honestly fine for Spirit if her power was nerfed so heavily.

Again: I just think that Spirit is very poorly balanced in the sense that her entire counterplay relies on running a teachable perk from a Survivor who has really bad teachables. (Talking about Calm Spirit and Sabo's balance is a discussion for another time, and Iron Will *is* Jake's first teachable so I guess it's okay.) I honestly prefer playing against Nurse far more than Spirit because it's a conflict of skill when you're trying to mindgame to dodge a Nurse's blinks as she tries to hit you. But there's zero counterplay to Spirit. You get hit because it'll eventually happen even if the Killer is an utter potato, and then they phase and follow your voice before hitting you for free with beyond Sprint Burst speed.
---
Ai no problem przyjacielu *mr√≥g mr√≥g*
---
What do I need to chill about? I thought I was being rather level headed about the entire thing, just saying it's silly how people are up in arms about a short timer. In all honesty, these changes make me want to actually play nurse, and I play on PS4.
---
The problem with this nerf is that on the good nurses that land 3/4 of their blinks, it has very little effect at all. The only real impact is that they take longer to cross the map when patrolling and looking for people. But the bad nurses who aren't as good at nailing those precise blinks are the ones who were already getting stomped and now will get beaten even worse. This nerf didn't really weaken the nurse, it just widened the gap between good and bad nurses.
---
can i get a killer version?
---
Ok so the best nurse will be good. Where does that leave the average nurse? They'll be fucking laughable. That's what's wrong with these nerfs.
---
I get it that thats a joke but he was tunneling cant blame me
---
Ahahahahahaa poor doggy
---
Which killers would you like to see?
---
It feels so good to get an unbreakabill off and recover a game or at least try to, we need more general counterplay to slug builds. But for killer it‚Äôs Devour, this one is a bit less fun for everyone else involved but that first Exposed hit is great because I know the ‚ÄúOh Fuck‚Äù reaction well
---
I've recently fell in love with tenacity. Killers are terrified of DS so I'm just gonna scoot my happy ass around. 
---
For killer it's taranaphobia** I just found out about this perk and love it
---
I personally think the Spirit is more fun to play and you can play her without ruin and add-ons and still have a good shot at winning which is a plus. The Plague is alright too, she isn't as strong as the Spirit but she can be quite fun as well. Both of them have good perks too.
---
This is like one of the only perks I don't have, but I want is so much it looks like so much fun to use!
---
We need more people like this than the flashlight/t-bagging survivors
---
No one competes with Wraith for S tier but I was good to Amanda. There's an argument for Demo, but the way his face opens up ruins it. The Spirit just annoys me with her WAH!
---
Honestly, i'm coming from Dark Souls and i miss the gestures when i'm playing dbd.
---
How often i wanted to wave to another survivor or have like a "thanks" gesture, or just fool around  with tose gestures üòÑ
---
first time i've seen anyone actually good at the game on reddit, usually immersed, console player or both
---
Head On with Quick and Quiet and any two perks. Off meta, usually effective, just good old family fun
---
Ghostface be like: "Ehy there kids, what's your favourite scary movie?"
---
While handing them candies, of course.
---
Its so fun to use. It was in shrine a few weeks ago and a few of my friends who are newer to the game picked it up and we are having a blast with it
---
Its not like me and my friends are 4 player swf full on try hard toxic survivors we just mess oround and do the objective, I do agree with you
---
ST S2 Spoiler ahead.
---
Aren't you forgetting when Will, influenced by the mind flayer, lead a squad of trained soldiers to their deaths via demodogs?
---
They are 100% in cahoots.
---
yeah
---
I would its implying that you could blink through anything you could normally walk through. So that its more like Billy's Chainsaw Sprint and less like stalking.
---
*I hope*
---
Jump Scare Myers is my favorite! Hope they do this with more killer addons
---
Just no
---
Minor, did you even read them?
---
3 second cooldown per blink that starts after fatigue? That's minor to you? Are you nuts?
---
*cries in F12*
---
Ace is a top tier because he's incredibly quiet.
---
Agreed
---
Ngl i do this one all the time
---
Had this yesterday aswell. Ich think this perk is seriously underrated.
---
Every kid is overreacting now, chages are not even out yet lol
---
I laughed way to hard at that Freddy at the 40 second mark, take the upvotes sir
---
We‚Äôll make it is my favourite by far. Saves so much time for 2 survivors off an unhook and means the unhook person has more of a chance. I wish more people ran it tbh
---
Plague is probably incapable of socialization
---
Zero counter play to spirit? How does anyone survive against her then?
---
The issue is people not wanting to change their play style to fit spirit
---
Stop being so bold against her and play immersed. 
---
But if you buff her with a nerf like that, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have an issue.
---
I think that scene was explained as less about Michael not being cold blooded enough to kill a baby and it was more about Michael just deciding he didn't feel like it at the moment.
---
Yes i use devour hope quite a bit too, I like how it really mixes things up and keeps people on their toes. at higher ranks i tend to get my totem cleansed before i can use it though :(
---
"In upcoming months" They're calling for it now haha
---
&gt;all killers should have 4 common, 5 uncommon, 5 rare, 4 very rare and 2¬†ultra rare¬†add-ons
---
Cannibal: *cries in ignored*
---
Okay cmon, legion was unfun and so exploitable, don‚Äôt drag that in here, he‚Äôs still fun to play, he was never very good, just so goddamn annoying
---
You probably didn't see her rule34. She has a loooong sausage down there
---
Spirit needs a nerf because like nurse she has low counterplay, in a healthy state shes not too bad to deal with but when injured its basically impossible because she can see your scratch marks AND hear you.
---
Iron will is supposed to counter her but that gets thrown out the window when she can take stridor which completely negates ironwill.
---
yeah I saw it in the shrine an tried to earn enough to get it but I just didn't have enough time to play that week, ah well, heres hoping it comes back again!
---
On my experience they are mostly toxic so I keep my moris and hiridescent head and infantry belts, and i only throw the axe when they start tbaging or being toxic in general , so then when the match end or they dc i watch their streams and watch them cry

---
Everyone thinks Spirit is balanced until they go up against a good one with dumb strong addons..everyone at red ranks know how broken she is
---
They have tier lists with GF and demogorgon in them. Just search the website for "DBD killer tier list"
---
Damn i dont have tenacity but i do run unbreakable sometimes. Would love to test tenacity out might be more useful
---
Console right here
---
shape, pig, huntress and doc flossing in front of basement stairs. the survivors need to know to stay down there.
---
Yes, the fatigue did balance her, but there is no argument against the fact that she was extremely overpowered to the point where a decent nurse player could decimate an entire team within a few minutes of the match starting. She will still more than likely be a top tier, if not the top tier, killer in the game. These changes simply make it so that the matches will go on for a bit longer instead of ending within five minutes or so.
---
Would be alot cooler if you weren't a fat racist.
---
Ok i must be dumb, but i always thought omega blink nurse is a nurse with 5 blinks
---
I was like oh that‚Äôs kinda cool, hanging from chains... THEYRE AROUND THE MAP!!!!!! Gonna be sweet, can‚Äôt wait to play against a spirit and right when I spawn in see a charm that‚Äôs just giving me the middle finger so I can start my game off right
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
About wah
---
That‚Äôs a good question that I don‚Äôt have the answer too unfortunately.
---
game is based on teamwork WITHOUT COMMUNICATION, that's why it doesn't have a ingame chat.
---
I understand both perspectives bit im not playing to get rank one im playing for fun so if you still believe spirit ill take your word for it
---
Well its not that its the problem that the weaker killers have to rely on survivors to make mistakes the nurse is strong because she has map pressure and the ability to end chases quickly. I believe its the map pressure which is one of the reason it makes nurse so powerful is she is able to put tons of pressure on survivors. Map pressure is need to stop gens and other things from being done. Which is why don‚Äôt nerf her into the ground but buff other killer universal things
---
sry
---
Lmao
---
* Bandwagon meme (memes which attempt to ride off the success of another post on /r/deadbydaylight without making significant changes).
---
The op addons for nurse aren't the extra blinks, it's the range ones. I don't want to go into but long story short it covers her only weakness: big maps
---
Time to become a survivor main again. Seeing as how easy it is nowadays. And if something is remotely difficult, we can just complain about it until they nerf it
---
Meanwhile console nurse mains are fucked
---
And I‚Äôm afraid of nurse... well not anymore, I just laugh and pallet drop and pretend imma vault but instead run the other direction cause they never figure it out from my experience.
---
I want the big bad to have a chance, ya know?
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
its fine as is.
---
What IS the problem? Streamers trying to play the game in the way that looks fun and engaging to their viewers?
---
What‚Äôs JJBA stand for?
---
&gt;If a 2 blink nurse can't hit you, she probably won't hit you either with 5.
---
hmmmm...
---
1) If you think that sounds manly... lmao
---
2) It seems not a single other person has had this issue apart from you.
---
When you're done with every killer, be sure to do The Crapper as well. Think of him as DBD's equivalent of Spider-Pig.
---
People calling her weak back then hadn‚Äôt learnt how to play her effectively, I guess. Now people know what perks and add-ons are meta to run on her and she‚Äôs become very strong, if not one of the strongest killers out there.
---
That's so cute and extremely relatable, as a killer main lol. If one of the survivors is clearly several ranks below mine (because of bad matchmaking or SWF) then I will give them hatch, and without fail they'll wiggle free and run the opposite direction every time.
---
How about another upvote
---
Oh I'm not refering to complaints about old region, I'm referring to complaints about CURRENT legion.
---
Yep.when I got spirit I only bought pack for diversion perk on survivor. I didnt even know at the time that she was top tier. I only started playing her cause she was the first killer I bought so I felt the need to main her
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call we‚Äôll make it situational. Your practically guaranteed to get it at least one time
---
You do realize it has to be up for it to be a white power symbol or to a side i think but its also an üëåüèº ok hand which is a meme you dummie
---
Dude, I had the exact same thought the other day but was too lazy to make a thread about it.
---
I also started playing shortly after Spirit came along and immediately loved everything about her, from the character design to her lore and of course her gameplay. Back then no one talked about how OP she is, now suddenly she is, despite the fact that she **wasn't** really buffed. I guess whining about Nurse got old, even for survivors, so they needed someone new to blame for their own mistakes.
---
Must have eaten too many gates today and she‚Äôs full in the objective category
---
it's not just the crouch, you have no red stain, and also if you used night shroud correctly, most of the time you should get the jump on survivors for a free first hit, which in some cases can just end the encounter right there if they're exposed or still injured.
---
Also if you can never hit a survivor even once as a standard killer, the problem lies with you Plague has great snowballing as she makes everything unsafe to do and has a sort of catch 22 system if you do or don't cleanse. Of course that banks on you winning at least 1 chase yourself, which I guess can be hard for some people.
---
I think many people are blowing this out of proportion with the whole ‚ÄúRIP Nurse F tier now‚Äù stuff. The PTB hasn‚Äôt even come out yet, and it she really is unplayable, then there‚Äôs still time for her to be fixed. But based on what we know now, here are my two cents:
---
* The charge timer thing won‚Äôt be bad for people who know how to actually play the Nurse. Her fatigue after a double blink is 2.5 seconds. The new charge timer starts at the beginning of fatigue, and it takes 3 seconds to charge up a new blink. So if the 3 second timer starts at the beginning of the 2.5 second fatigue, then there‚Äôs only an extra .5 second to wait before you can do another single blink. That‚Äôs all accurate Nurses really need to close a chase. 
---
* I‚Äôm glad they got rid of the Omega blink because it was ridiculous; survivors might as well just hook themselves at that point. Plus, it allowed people to just spam the blink until they hit instead of actually timing and aiming blinks. 
---
* Some of the new add-ons are gimmicky, but some of the others are good. 
---
* Do I think Nurse will still be an insta-win killer after this? Probably not. Will she be Legion or old Freddy tier? No. She still ignores basic mechanics like palettes, windows, and walls. 
---
* Also, nerfing the Nurse does not automatically make Spirit S or SS tier.
---
Funny part is that they don't even play Pig. She is actually pretty strong, i've got 4k at red ranks without perks and addons.
---
She has a natural thing to slow down generators(traps), even if they get off the trap at the first try, they still waste time going for the box.
---
She is a short killer, mindgames work so damn well with her.
---
She can turn off her terror radius whenever she wants without giving any hint(unlicke Wraith) and thats really strong.
---
Oh no. A killer is in the power role. The horror!
---
Preach it my brother!
---
Thx, thought it had good meme template potential, all credits to you
---
Nurse was never changed in the entirety of dbds lifecycle
---
&gt;Haha disagreeing with someone is cancel culture.
---
Your points are correct but calling someone an idiot for their opinion isn't cancel culture my dude.
---
finally a map to counter blendettes
---
I feel this, man. I hate the chainsaw killersüòÇ
---
yes
---
You make lots of assumptions which leads to you making improper arguments. Yes, I will eventually get the down as Plague. But by then, a gen will pop.
---
When I got my Adept Bill achievement, I got it by using Unbreakable against a Wraith that slugged me.  Felt so good unlocking the gate and bolting.
---
And let me guess - they didn‚Äôt even speed up her walking to compensate.
---
Bing Bong Wraith. Play with Bone Clapper/Ghost and just bing bong non stop for the whole trial. I do still try to hook/kill but I don't take it too seriously and will usually let the last person go. Mainly I just try to drive them crazy. End chat is just a series of "BING. BONG. BING. BONG. BING. BING. BONG." until I disconnect.
---
But the first one happens in a BLINK of an eye, hes gonna run and say 'oh shit oh shit shes gonna blink again' and then youre suddenly infront of him 'oh fuck!' as he remembered from the hook
---
Oink!
---
Rightfully so
---
the fuck
---
Ya...pretty sure they are randomly doing the ok sign as a meme during a time when there is a rapid rise in its usage as a hate. And it doesn't have to be up. People are subtly putting in alot of pictures where they can.
---
Lol you‚Äôre one of those people that actually believe it‚Äôs a hate symbol. Probably also think Pepe the frog is a hate symbol too LMFAO
---
Even better is when they get the party hat off, get downed+trapped+hooked again, then run right back to the same box and get the second party hat off.
---
I never said I mistook her but plenty have and I'm just answering why that might be no need to get triggered over a fictional character..
---
To this day I‚Äôve only escaped through exit doors against a handful of spirits, and I don‚Äôt consider myself a bad player or even above immersing and hidin all game but you‚Äôll get found eventually it‚Äôs just the game and there‚Äôs not much you can do after, I‚Äôve only encountered one good console nurse and she DCd because despite her getting good pressure we slammed gens pretty hard that game, and she quit and told me I‚Äôm a bitch of rn rushing a nurse and I should never do that, like I control my 3 other teammates and what they‚Äôre doing. real messages from a real person still have them.
---
Oh then carry on, I think he‚Äôs weak but really fun to play, not always so much against but often he‚Äôs a free escape so no complaints
---
Plsying Nurse on console? Last time i tried it looked like a slideshow, good luck.
---
Can we please only do these in the subreddit now?
---
Thanks anyways
---
Yes i am doing it as a meme thank you very much good day to you sir
---
I don‚Äôt... what? At what part of that was I triggered?
---
That's just the new survivor perk, it open the exit gate at 50% speed from a distance of 5/10/15 meters from the lever
---
Shit i didnt reply i just commented
---
The Demo is humanoid...
---
Tru
---
Yep!  I still play her a good bit more, but she will always hold a special spot for me as the big reason I got started in dbd.
---
Slicey dicey said the FNV stealth suit equipped to a literal ghost.
---
Fair enough, I didn't think about that
---
Target Practice! ~ Huntress mains everywhere.
---
Ouu le petit cochon
---
Whatever, if it helps me win, I'll do that.
---
Don't @ me, I don't want to waste my time.
---
What a pathetic cunt
---
Absolutely not
---
Big maps make all killers suffer
---
Now she can join the rest while they work on the underlying issue here, the maps.
---
Oh you're right! It was hillbilly's that has the charge up.
---
Yeah. I find it hilarious that people still DC against Legion to this day.
---
I remember once I saw someone complaining on Reddit that they don't like Legion because they can move around the map fast and force you to spend time mending after being hit by their power. Someone then quite aptly replied "So you don't like them because they have a power?"
---
Honestly compared to the likes of Hillbilly, Huntress, or even Doctor or Wraith "can move fast and make you spend some time after being injured to 'Self Care'" is nothing.
---
There's a reason Legion is considered bottom tier lol. But I mean I even see people DC against Leatherface because "iNsTaDoWn Op!"
---
After getting the achievements for red ranks I stopped trying as hard, mid purple is where I like to hang out, some sweats, some potatoes like me, and I feel hex‚Äôs should have a ‚Äúafter broken‚Äù effect because so often you can have ruin or devour break instantly or at least really early and be down perk slots because of it, maybe just a blanket buff about hex‚Äôs or totems in general, but idk what it would be
---
No more or less human than the xenomorph...
---
I haven't played too much nurse but I was always a two blink fan with the brown spoon and the yellow clock addon
---
Gj dude. Good luck with trapper.
---
Honestly... An overheat mechanic might be interesting on Billy? Some of the add-ons he has make him have the ability to do the longest chainsaw sprints known to mankind, literally circling most maps multiple times with ease before stopping to chase someone. I'm not saying to give it to him every time he stops chainsawing at all, but to make it like, after long stretches of time where you're running in circles, have it slowly build over time? Maybe? Might be an interesting mechanic.
---
I don't see why Bubba would need one, his power takes more time to charge up in most instances and is less accurate than nurse. And you don't get the benefit of being an Olympic runner for a long time.
---
Wraith honestly wouldn't need one either. The way that his power work as of now, there would be no reason to make it timered. If they did that, he would be a bit more similar to the Spirit in that regard. Giving him a timer would probably have them limit how long he could stay invisible, and as he isn't incredibly fast without addons when invisible, they would probably buff his speed. It would simply make him closer to the Spirit. Not exactly the same, but closer.
---
Currently rank 7. Have played spirit like... 15-25 times over all. Have never fucking won against the bitch.
---
Meanwhile, I could loop the nurse easy as hell. 
---
They nerfed the wrong killer. Nurses nerf doesn't even really make much sense.
---
I mean it's reddit
---
You make myers tier 3 last .6 seconds longer everyone cries OP plz nerf
---
And not a tea bag or a flash light click in sight, I'm proud and I wish more players were like this. 
---
Except for that point, but he deserved that one
---
Then why get defensive and make things up when many people have had this ''issue'' it's not an attack it's just how some people have perceived her which is understandable as she's very manly.
---
Nice
---
True enough.  It literally wasnt until recently that I even considered her prayer beads power (mostly because I almost never got them) and always went more for power recovery and speed, but I can see how DEVESTATING she can be.  Weirdly, of all the times i was a survivor, only faced her once.
---
Honestly my biggest annoyance of nurse was people could hide from me easily. Spirit is hard to hide from.
---
While you're right, iirc that scene wasn't supposed to have a baby in it at all. There was supposed to be a man asleep (probably drunk) on the couch, but he never showed up to film that day, so they improvised a baby for, what I assume, shock value. Which actually adds to your point, Michael doesn't see any difference between a baby and a man (or dog, woman, cat, etc.). If it's in his warpath, he'll kill it, end of story.
---
yes, I forget the killer is shit if they can't kill everyone before 1 gen pops.
---
She needs to have a vaulting animation, for one, it‚Äôs so stupid that there‚Äôs NO way to tell if she‚Äôs vaulting or phasing or mindgaming you all at once, that would make chases more fair.
---
The spirit is just annoying to play against at this point.
---
I play duos with one of my buddies, he‚Äôs pretty good at rank 4 and I‚Äôm the living embodiment of trash stuck at rank 10/11 for about 2 weeks, we have recently tried getting some other friends to play DBD because it‚Äôs better to have 0 hour friends on SWF than play with randoms, we are by no means a good SWF
---
Whats happened?
---
Between sets of blinks or *each* blink??
---
Honestly I‚Äôd rather they just removed 3-5 blink addon altogether than what they did to my poor girl.
---
I can imagine hillbilly giving you a dead rat on a plate and looking all cute and proud about getting something for you. You then gotta eat it bcs you feel bad for him and he is a cutie!
---
Who would destroy Canada? Canadians are too nice to destroy! Even Legion apologizes after stabbing survivors.
---
No she isn‚Äôt.
---
This sums it up perfectly!
---
You think spirit deserves S tier in general? She‚Äôs A with Huntress. Then Hillbilly and Nurse were S, now it‚Äôs just hillbilly I guess.
---
&gt; I prayed that they would only touch her addons and not mess with her base kit
---
For that to happen, someone at BHVR would be required to understand that Nurse is too powerful to begin with, and why she is powerful.
---
This update is three years too late and is for survivors. It is not at all a well thought out or planned update. This is a completely reactionary "rework" to quell newcomers upset at Nurse.
---
 
---
For the past few months, we have been reviewing the Nurse and her add-ons. We are pleased to say that these changes will be available in the upcoming mid-chapter update, and we would like to take a moment to share some insight into thought process behind them.¬†
---
There were several things we wanted to address when revisiting the Nurse. First, all killers should have 4 common, 5 uncommon, 5 rare, 4 very rare and 2¬†ultra rare¬†add-ons- the Nurse previously did not meet this condition as she was created before this standard was put in place. Many of her add-ons also had downsides or effects that hindered players' muscle memory, causing them to be very rarely used. Others had unintended side effects that made them much stronger than intended (notably the range add-ons which in turn granted reappearance speed, sometimes referred to as "omega blink"). We wanted to bring these add-ons up to our recent standards and introduce new and fun effects for players to experiment with.¬†
---
In the process, we‚Äôve also made¬†a few adjustments made to her base power.¬†Previously, the¬†Nurse could double blink, go through fatigue, then immediately double blink again.¬†This did not leave the Survivors with much of an opportunity to break line of sight. A recharge mechanic for blink charges has been added to limit how quickly she can perform multiple blinks. Rather than immediately receiving all her blink charges following fatigue, she will instead¬†regain charges one at a time. Each charge takes three seconds¬†*starting from the beginning of her fatigue*. This time can be reduced through add-ons.¬†
---
The timing¬†of¬†the visual effects for the blink reappearance¬†have¬†been adjusted so that the Nurse becomes¬†visible just before the end of the blink. This allows¬†players to react appropriately and avoid situations where¬†they¬†are hit or blocked by the collision of the Nurse before they can see her.¬†
---
We have removed the ‚Äúblink accuracy‚Äù stat. Blink accuracy¬†stat was functional, but its values were so small that its effect was hard to notice. Blink accuracy would place you randomly around the position you blinked to.¬†
---
## NEW ADD-ONS¬†
---
Every single Nurse add-on has been altered in some way. The new effects of the add-ons are the following:¬†
---
Common¬†
---
**White Nit Comb** 
---
* Decreases the length of blink attack lunges by 50% (0.15 seconds). Increases blood point rewards for blink attack score events by 100%.¬†
---
**Metal Spoon** 
---
* Hitting a Survivor with a blink attack causes their sounds of pain to be moderately louder for 60 seconds.¬†
---
**Wooden Horse** 
---
* Reduces extra fatigue from missed blink attacks by 50% (0.5 seconds).¬†
---
**Plaid Flannel** 
---
* Rarity changed from Very Rare to Common. The blink indicator placement has been¬†improved, and¬†will now stay visible until the Nurse has reached her destination (it was previously not visible while blinking).¬†
---
Uncommon¬†
---
**Dull Bracelet** 
---
* Decreases maximum blink distance by 20% (4 meters). Increases Blood point rewards for precise blink score events by 100%.¬†
---
**Bad Man Keepsake** 
---
* Rarity changed from Common to Uncommon. Hitting a Survivor with a blink attack causes their aura to be revealed when healing or being healed within a¬†28 meter¬†range for 60 seconds.¬†
---
**Catatonic Boy's Treasure** 
---
* Reduces extra fatigue from chain blinks by 100% (0.5 seconds).¬†
---
**Dark Cincture** 
---
* Decreases blink recharge time by 20% (0.6 seconds).¬†
---
**Pocket Watch** 
---
* Increases the duration of the chain blink window by 13% (0.2 seconds).¬†
---
Rare¬†
---
**Anxious Gasp** 
---
* Blinking past a survivor causes them to scream and awards 200 blood points in the devious category for terrifying them.¬†
---
**Spasmodic Breath** 
---
* Hitting a survivor with a successful blink attack disables the ability to blink and increases The Nurse's base movement speed to 4.6 m/s for 60 seconds.¬†
---
**Ataxic Respiration** 
---
* Reduces base blink fatigue duration by 12.5% (0.25 seconds).¬†
---
**Fragile Wheeze** 
---
* Decreases blink recharge time by 30% (0.9 seconds).¬†
---
**Heavy Panting** 
---

---
Very Rare¬†
---
**"Bad Man's" Last Breath** 
---
* Hitting a survivor with a successful blink attack grants The Nurse the Undetectable status for 16¬†seconds.This¬†effect may be only triggered once every 60 seconds.¬†
---
**Campbell's Last Breath** 
---
* After reappearing from a fully charged blink, The Nurse immediately blinks at half charge in the direction she is currently facing.¬†
---
**Kavanagh's Last Breath** 
---
* Increases maximum blink range by 30% (6 meters) and increases maximum blink charge time by 30% (0.6 seconds).¬†
---

* After blinking, allows the Nurse to immediately blink back to her original position by pressing the Secondary Power Button. Requires a blink charge and must be triggered during the chain blink window.¬†
---
Ultra Rare¬†
---
**Matchbox**

* Rarity changed from Common to Ultra Rare. Removes 1 blink charge. Increases base movement speed to 4.2 m/s.¬†

**Torn Bookmark**

* Rarity changed from Common to Ultra Rare. Adds 1 blink charge. The Nurse can no longer blink to locations not in her line of sight.¬†
---
All¬†these changes are available to test starting tomorrow on the Player Test Build and will be included in the following mid-chapter update. We look forward to hearing what you think!¬†
---
If you wiggle, you die. 'dems da rules.
---
Pretty sure it's each blink
---
That would make him worse..terror radius doesn't matter when you are in a chase and 1 bottle every 30 seconds is ridiculouss since survivors can still drop a pallet and run to the next one, you'll get looped hard..
---
1 more bottle and a faster reload time would be enough for Clown

Dude you're referencing films that no one considers canon. Good luck with that.

‚ÄúAll survivor counter play except hiding or exhaustion perks‚Äù so you mean just looping? Cause those are the only three methods of counter play I can think of...

I actually hate play as Spirit, same as i hate play Nurse years ago when i only start practice her, in terms of mechanics and everything else, but dude, when almost every game you face vs SWF group, when you play Trapper or Wraith, and once you down first survivor there are 2-3 gens are gone, and as soon as you down that first survivor he's teammates rush right in front of you with flashlights and bodyblocks, and game turns in complete shitshow, so after such experience you dont have other choice and play Nurse or Spirit. When BHVR made other killers competitive on red ranks, people stop play only Nurse/Spirit or whatever in meta right now
---
Bro don't you DARE disrespect the new vroom vroom nurse meta
---
I hate when they avoid it by hitting you down then waiting till it's gone to pick you up -.-
---
reddit killers think shes low tier actually.
---
It starts when fatigue starts, if I understood correctly. So if you blinked once and start fatigue, it begins the timer to regain that blink, if you blinked twice, when fatigue starts the timer to regain the first blink starts, after you regain that the timer for regaining the second blink starts.
---
Is that the pink addon?
---
Wow
---
They made it so she now has a recharge timer and can't blink until it refills. Basically she can't blink as often anymore.
---
So you do have the power to blink and move around the map and then you get a normal chase? 
---
To me it sounds like a really good version of someone like Huntress. Get one near guaranteed hit and then continue a normal chase.
---
PC, but try to verify integrity of game files anyway
---
I like doing that shy thing too but on spirit
---
I call it "Boo spirit" like the boo from mario
---
I'll stand in a corner within hearing distance of a gen or totem, like I'm a witch from left4dead
---
If I hear them touch the gen / totem I grab them since they can't hear me phase
---
Or I'll do another version of it where I freak out and hit them with my katana and run the fuck away to another corner until I hear noise again
---
To do what?
---
Steveo too.
---
They made it so she can't blink as often and has a recharge time. She can't blink so quickly and so efficiently
---
everytime you get fatigue your ability has a cooldown of 3 seconds for every chain blink you made.so its 6 seconds after 2 blinks. 9 if u use the pink addon with 3 blinks
---
Ok i understand now, i never really see nurse on console. I guess she was strong on pc or somthing?
---
That's funny.
---
I think its really cool how when killers DC I lose all my potential BP‚Äôs plus my items, add-ons and offerings. But when I DC, they get a quitter bonus. 
---
Its really cool.
---
My guess is insta-saw Billy will be removed or moved to needing an ultra rare and a very rare.
---
Lmfao
---
Stip wraithism
---
Imagine hooking the last survivor and bustin out this as they bleed out on the hook
---
It's too early to tell if it's gonna be bad, good or balanced
---
At least Nurse requires 20x more skill than hillbilly
---
I'm talking about the effect not the name genius
---
If you play football with your friends you're just a fucking ronaldo wannabe
---
Not skillful you're up against shit killers and you think it makes you the shit but what ever homie
---
Sit in a locker with pizza dwight and head on until the crows show up and the killer comes over.
---
I hope it's like other passes where you level it up and can purchase it after if you want.
---
The queen is dead! Long live the queen!
---
Ooohh I like
---
Yeah, he's the least influenced and controlled of all the killers. It's just that his natural curiosity and passivity makes him seem to have less agency than he actually does.
---
Survivors: Omg Nurse &amp; Spirit so OP, plz nerf
---
Devs: Nerfs every other update
---
Survivors: The game is catered to killers
---
Idk how long you've played, but about a year ago the killer could kind of tell based on when players join. If 3 or 4 people popped into a lobby simultaneously, then you knew jt was a SWF.
---
BHVR actually added a second or two of randomization to when survivors join, so that killers cant tell anymore, because there was a HUGE problem with killers dodging lobbies
---
Good Spirit and Nurse players have literally no counter-play. It's not about mindlessly looping, if they're good at their character you just lose.
---
Way to strong! Now people are crying on reddit cause they won‚Äôt be able to keep their killer rank without her OP skill/addons.
---
Yes.
---
There was really no need to change the nurse. As a survivor main, I vote other survivors shut up about "wE nEeD mOrE baLanCE"  because it's not fun to have an abundance of C tier killers.
---
Her recharge starts at the beginning of fatigue. So after you blink you wait 0.5 seconds to get your next blink back. One addon to reduce recharge time will net you your next blink during fatigue. If you want both blinks back together you wait 3.5 seconds. With both addons this is down to 2 seconds. No one seems to be doing the correct math and are just crying that the sky is falling.
---
Here's where your argument completely falls apart; these streamers are NOT promoting the game, they are promoting themselves. The only people that will see their .ttv profile are the people they meet in-game, and guess what those people have already bought the game and are playing it. 
---
On top of that, putting .ttv in your name is so blatantly self promoting that it shows you're desperate for attention. That's pathetic. The streamers that are popular for DbD (or any game for that matter) are the ones that are truly passionate about their game and are legit good content creators. Not the ones that see a game as a boosting tool for their own ego.
---
So yeah, pride is a sin. And if you defend this kind of behavior, you are part of the problem in my opinion.
---
I mean, you‚Äôre wrong and I have the experience that tells me as much. I play this game a lot. I know how to counter them.
---
This addon makes her legion.
---
Legion is not a good killer.
---
Or she can tactically collide into you and know where you are
---
He‚Äôs so short the Entity felt sorry and raised him up a bit (and he‚Äôs STILL fairly short).
---
This timer will reward people further and fuck people harder for missing
---
I know it's not ideal, but one of her ultra rare ups her move speed to 4.2m/s
---
Huntress! (but only if the map is fair for her)
---
Oh, I did a stalker Susie once. Just following the chosen survivor everywhere without harming them. If they get too far away, use Frenzy to catch up.
---
Because daily rituals are outdated as hell. The ones for Trapper and Hillbilly are 25k too, lower than the standard 30k for most killers.
---
As long as you don't tunnel or camp cos it's pretty much a death certificate when a spirit does .-.
---
All I usually get is salt
---
All of these clips were at red ranks, regardless of the skill level of the killers, the attempt of the video is fun not a demonstration of my skill. 
---
Hence the clips where I get instahealed into a down, I window juke a freddy and then spin in place just to get mori'd, and where I get random firecracker saves. 
---
You're making points that don't make sense.
---
Instasaw. That‚Äôs it
---
Well obviously you can't compare such a tiny change with a entire rework, but yeah, I get what you mean.
---
Stp right there criminal scum
---
society once again oppressing us, rise up Wraith mains
---
I've gotten more encouragement than salt, which I found unexpected but nice.
---
Somebody is projecting...
---
Bahaha you piece of shit, I love it. Are you taking apprentices?
---
I bought Bubba recently, and it's the first time I feel like I'm reliably winning as killer. (I run Iron Grasp, Territorial Imperative, BBQ, Lullaby)
---
Why do people consider this character underpowered? Am I just playing at too low a skill tier to see it?
---
 O h   Y e s
---
During reset I try my absolute best to recognize the weaker survivors from the good ones, so I can give them a bit of an extended chase, maybe leave them on the ground if they‚Äôre on 3rd hook. Rank reset for me as a killer is quite relaxing, so I try to give the same experience to those lower ranked survivors.
---
Thank you tall women
---
Even though it tells them when they get pulled off
---
I enjoyed this. You should do more mate.
---
This is dope!
---
You dare insult the one true god? May Ace, all glory be unto his name, curse you with brown med-kits and tool boxes
---
Most of the time ghost face killers camp because of their power
---
I never asked for a nerf, but I'm not totally complaining against it now that I know what's coming.
---
Just as long as she stays at the top and towers over Spirit. Fuck Spirit.
---
Thanks!
---
and thats exactly the type of Nurse i was talking about :)
---
wat
---
Seems like Feng Min‚Äôs have a tendency to kill themselves on the hook, but maybe it‚Äôs just me lol
---
The community used to be a lot worse, its definitely more supportive now.
---
It‚Äôs a kyf meme
---
:&gt;
---
Here's where YOUR argument completely falls apart. The way streamers grow their viewerbase is by building a community around them. Members of that community tend to watch them not only when they play their favorite game but also when they play variety. That's where the promotion aspect comes in, communities being exposed to different games and being soft-peer-pressured to join in on the fun.
---
Also, it's so funny how you demand that people don't promote themselves. You're probably one of those halfwits who think that self-linking rules on big subreddits are reasonable. OF COURSE THEY WANT ATTENTION IT'S THE POINT OF BEING A STREAMER.
---
It is not "streamers are using the game to boost their own ego". It's a symbiotic relationship between gamedevs and streamers that have been proven to work extremely well in many cases, like recently with Apex Legends.
---
You know what else is a deadly sin? Envy. Something you seem to be full of to me.
---
Ok, gonna sound like an asshole, but jumpscare Prayer Beads Spirit
---
Never go for kills, I just put on Discordance and Tinkerer and appear next to the group to jumpscare them and make them run away
---
It causes an instant injury on anyone who looks at the totem due to necking damage
---
Very nice :)
---
so he is getting 1 new add-on they say there should be 20 he has 19, just change the raritys and add one more
---
Billy needs no nerfs
---
i personally always do my best to 1-2 hook any1 with object or mori them if i have it asap
---
That‚Äôs not similar at all. Halloween starts a new timeline every other movie.
---
When SWF you are matched with a killer that is +/- 6 ranks from your highest ranked SWF.
---
'Member broken L loops with 2 pallets? 
---
I guess i cant talk cuz i main Hag and she is secret OP, but you're so right dude. I've seen my friends get SALTY at a 2k. Really, most maps are survivor advantage leaning, but nearly all of those loops can be countered by committing to chase and just m1ing. The only exceptions i can immediately think of are Ironworks loop, a couple Haddonfield loops, and the Isolation Tank in hawkins. Not to mention that almost every single non m1-able loop requires the surv to have Balanced.
---
I play on ps4 and every time I get bloodlust my screen freezes for like 2-3 seconds is there anyway to stop this ?
---
No, it would all need to happen at once. The way you're suggesting would make the game unplayable for killers during the transition period
---
The ambush add-ons help deal with pallet loops but otherwise yeah, I agree
---
Spirit is already really strong, she's been better than the Nurse since release easily.
---
Looks great. I hope console can get something like these custom icons, so I miss my pc, too poor to fix
---
I loved this! Made me smile but now I expect more vids like this one!
---
I hear you, but most SWF do communicate somewhat, even if they're goofing around. Even confirmation that he's chasing someone else saves so much time.
---
The stomping, the growl as they anticipate a pounce, the badass music; everything about being chased by the demo is fantastic. He's my favorite killer to play against at the moment
---
the update isnt even out, and people are already crying for nurse even tho they havent play her...
---
They buffing or nerfing?
---
Ohohohohho. New Meta dropping in.
---
Iron Will
---
Urban Evasion
---
Sprint Burst 
---
DS
---
buff addons and nerf base kit ( or at least thats what it looks like)
---
I 100% agree. As it is I hate this nerf but if they'd done something like that or were at least moving toward it I'd be all for it. As it stands it just seems like it's punishing high rank killers even more by removing one of the only viable high rank killers
---
There is counterplay, im pretty sure more people would complain if there wasnt, there is also counterplay for present nurse, and dont tell me im garbage, rank 1 both sides
---
Well she did need a bit of a nerf, if they don‚Äôt fuck up to much it should be good
---
They are in cahoots in season 2, but the demogorgons existed in the Upside Down before the Flayer took control of the dimension. It started to take control and dominate the inhabitants of the Upside Down...
---
‚Äúoh yeah like the germans‚Äù - steve
---
You want the legion to teleport?!?
---
Your circle paints over where the other numbers are/would be.
---
What you mean with little mobility ? He might be a thicc boi but hes still a 115% /4,6 m/s speed killer like any other m1 killer
---
I mean Spirit is Much easier than Nurse was. Oh boy this is going to be a tough survivor que.
---
Some of you guys are cool. Don‚Äôt play Killer tomorrow
---
I don't understand Ghostface - if I look at him, and reveal him, why is he still able to put me into the exposed state?  Isn't revealing him supposed to break him out of his ability?
---
There isn't counterplay for Nurse, counterplay against her is stealth which is no longer a thing, especially when she takes whisper. The only way to play against Nurse is to lose line of sight and thats almost impossible on open maps.
---
If you aren't going to list any spirit counterplays then there isn't any because thats the truth.
---
General consensus is that you shouldn't heal against plague, which means all 4 survivors are usually injured, so thana is pretty good on her
---
Ok, u can tell your friends instead of subreddits
---
Fair enough, everyone has their differences in the exact rankings. The salient point being there are enough viable killers - not 90% trash as the comment above states
---
Lmaoooooo survivors get nerds patch after patch?!?! You don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about üòÇ
---
wholesome
---
Then guess what, you're literally only getting Hillbilly and if they nerf him down then the game will die at high ranks. I guarantee people aren't playing these killers because they like them, it's because literally nobody else is viable against SWF at high rank.
---
So *these* are the Dwights I go against when I play killer
---
Yes yes typos I see them, spare me the bravado and do something else.
---
I came across that once and it made me so mad. Let it be known I don‚Äôt actually get mad at this game, believe it or not i enjoy it and have fun playing it. It was probably the first game I ever tried super hard as a survivor. We got the last gen done and I found the killer and forced a loop for close to two minutes so the two other survivors got out. He eventually got me but it made me feel so satisfied knowing he couldn‚Äôt get the others because of me
---
Ash just dies first every time
---
Looks like they're trying to make the Nurse play balanced between PC and console, now nobody is going to use her on PC too!
---
All three should have slowly turned towards you. That'd been a perfect ending.
---
yawn. old joke
---
I didn't say he needed it, I simply said the mechanic would be interesting.
---
Groovy
---
As are you friend
---
You still need to learn timing to get saves with it ... the killer can look up if you are late or you just blind him if early ... flashlights are easier to learn cuz you get more than one chance.
---
Do you even read patch notes? Totems are harder to find = Survivor nerf. Vaults got nerfed = Survivor nerf. Map changes to remove some survivor favoured maps = Survivor nerf. More unsafe pallets, less safe pallets = Survivor nerf.
---
Lmao go read them and come back.
---
Is she out on ptb already?
---
why isn‚Äôt Claudette with Ace?
---
Bro I'm over here jamming while watching a dwight bully some killers
---
Why no Dr. Zomboss killer?
---
This is actually amazing! Good job you two
---
It was at that moment he realized he fucked up
---
Not sure. Xbox dude here. I do believe the PTB will be out soon or is out, but a lot of people are talking about the change since the devs revealed it in a post
---
You have to look at him for a full 2.5 seconds, it doesn't instantly break. He also needs to be in the middle portion of the screen and not on the edges. Jump into a custom game with someone and test it til you start to get it down.
---
His power has more utility when not camping imo. If you're good with it, you can expose someone by abusing object line of sight and they cant break you out unless they sacrifice a health state. Which essentially makes them 1 shotable since they're now injured.
---
You can still double blink, hit a survivor and then immediately blink at least once right? The only significant thing I see from base Nurse is you can't immediately double blink after double blinking again and even then only by a few seconds. Not to mention she has add-ons that reduce this now.
---
From what I'm seeing is that if you were a good Nurse before, this largely won't affect you at all. That's not to mention the add-ons that make her a default speed killer and the other debuff add-ons she has at her disposal now either.
---
I just think people shouldn't be crying about it until the PTB is out and even then anything can be tweaked until the actual release a couple weeks from now.
---
I'm glad I stopped trying to play nurse on console, and stuck with spirit.
---
I actually really like this idea.
---
Buff pretty much everyone at this point honestly. Pig, Doc, Trapper, Wraith, Clown, Bubba, they all need to be made like... Even remotely viable
---
This looks like a salty survivor post.
---
Well, BHVR has been saying they want to look at/change billy add-ons since that awful void of time that was the MixTape Legion days. At least they've said they will never touch base billy.
---
She's not bad exactly just not ad good lmao
---
We did it boys!
---
Go visit a therapist.
---
Here's the link to my first one: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8gpw7/baby_dweet_montage_repost_with_a_better_edit/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
These are honestly so fun to do, but going for these stupid plays usually results on me getting downed üòÖ
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it specifically on huntress?
---
No no, the breaking works fine, it's just that I still get exposed and insta-downed.  Like, I spot ghostface stalking me.  I turn to face him.  I hear the "you're revealing Ghostface" sounds.  He flashes white and breaks out of his stealth power as he's rushing me.  I'm exposed, hit, and downed.
---
Shouldn't him flashing white have cancelled him filling the stalk meter?  Or did he already fill it up before I revealed him and it's just the timing that makes it look like its not working?
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll make her much less of a threat. I think it‚Äôs gonna play like ash losing her acog in rainbow six siege. It‚Äôs just gonna weed out/discourage the lesser nurse players
---
Takes one to think they know one.
---
Not all Heroes wear capes.
---
Give huntress an Iri reload speed addon!!! 
---
Fleshy Grips
---
-Considerably increases reload speed at a locker
---
-When grabbing a survivor out of a locker, refill your hatchets
---
I have another one before this: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8gpw7/baby_dweet_montage_repost_with_a_better_edit/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Only recently started doing these montages and it seems like people like them
---
Except she can still blink...lol so now wraith speed with the ability to blink around...sounds strong enough to me.
---
Nah Im one of those "I play both" people just fucking around
---
Sounds about right, dbd community is toxic as hell best of times.
---
Why the downvotes?
---
How was she nerfed besides the 3 blink nerf?
---
As I said depending on survivors.
---
Usually when I wanna do this daily I end up facing a 4 man swf with OoO who just follow me around, disarming all my traps and teabagging me from the distance.
---
Now talk about spooky
---
Looks like I‚Äôm using the rest of my omegablink add ons and going back to Hag.
---
Take my updoot, probably the best I've seen tbh
---
Nurse was only ever op in the right hands like all other good killers
---
Wait how did nurse get reworked, i haven't been on for a while so I wouldn't know
---
The only possible clue to her age is her ultra-rare Waterlogged Shoe add-on, which is described as a "child's shoe" .
---
Assert your dominance with Godtier Dwight.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df0m2x/what_killer_should_i_buy_besides_pig_ghost_face/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Cooldown for blinks after fatigue
---
I personally think his power can be fine, it's just that most of his add-ons are a waste or hindrance to it (Award Winning Chili)
---
I like Second Wind.
---
Idk it‚Äôd kinda promote bad play. Since most people run BT, you‚Äôll get everyone and their grandma rushing hook to get stacks. Meanwhile no one is doing gens and everyone is gonna act really stupid when it comes to saving other survivors. Survivors can also get an easy af protection hit after an unhook too. If they did use safe unhooks they‚Äôd have to bump up the number to 4 or lose the protection hits.
---
Orrrrrrr the devs could rework it and we‚Äôd all stop walking on eggshells trying to come up with buffs for a fundamentally broken designed perk.
---
Why does piggy looks like the spirit at this post? some kind of trap decoy to avoid more nerfs?
---
This post is dumb as shit
---
the blood vessel
---
I'm kinda new to the game and only have Claudette at a decent level so far. Empathy is a great perk in solo, everyone's a lot braver at full health.
---
That would kill swf, which would kill the game.
---
Holy shit the constant stunning of Freddy in that one section made me choke on my water. A+, quality content coming from a killer main.
---
All they really need to do for huntress is give her an ultra rare that fills her hatchets when grabbing a surv out of a locker with +50% reload speed. Maybe give her a Rare versiom of Glowing Concotion, and add a new very rare handle for faster hatchet tossing?
---
This is so sad can we nerf the pig
---
Coxcombed Clapper removes the noise made by his bell when he cloaks/uncloaks and The Ghost causes his terror radius and red stain to remain suppressed for 6 seconds after uncloaking.
---
No u
---
Why
---
Totem spots are still bullshit as ever, the vaults mean nothing if you know how to properly vault from the correct angle, maps got chnages because survivors had endless and constant loops on too many maps, and a truly good survivor doesn‚Äôt need too many pallets, they only need one or two. Sounds like you just need to get better ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Is it taboo to say Claudette is an OP survivor base because she's black? Is this something you guys also find? I've been wondering how they can fix this without coming off insensitive, how would you guys feel if she was aged up and given pearly gray hair?
---
*Squeaky voice* CAN I GET ONE TOO PLZ?!
---
what happened with insta heals?
---
More like I play "both"
---
No, bad meme, remove bad meme bad meme bad meme

What did you just say about the hideo kojima produced hideo kojima series Metal Gear?
---
Yes :3
---
Idk people don't like Freddy mabey.
---
I swear man he scares me everytime
---
Love the style, i hope you draw more for the sub :)
---
You've gotta have better stuff to do with your life than bait people for no reason. 
---
But hey, maybe I'm giving you too much credit? 
---
^ see that's you.
---
Oh. Thank you. I remembered Bone Clapper and suspected it might have been like that. Guessing it‚Äôs a higher rarity?
---
Her blink has a cooldown/charge now. It‚Äôs awful. You clearly don‚Äôt play nurse.
---
&gt;Trapper-sans-bag position without them.
---
Isn't that kinda regarded as low tier? 
---
&gt;This is a pretty light nerf which can be almost completely undone by running two low rarity add-ons that move her to the base state that Nurse players said was an ideal spot
---
Do you not hear yourself? By your logic she becomes the same add-on dependent killer that Legion, Plague, Ghostface, Myers, Trapper, and Wraith are. That ISN'T a "pretty light nerf" I've already explained the math but here lemme do it again. 
---
In your 3 seconds waiting for your first blink to recharge, a survivor will cover 12 meters. In your 3 seconds waiting for another blink the Survivior will cover 24 meters. By the time your second blink has returned, it becomes borderline wishful thinking that you'll catch them, since you'll need a full charged Blink and chain blink to close that gap. And by the time that happens, they'll be putting even more distance between yourself and them. 
---
You are correct that the Nerf doesn't seem that drastic. But you need to apply the math to the situation. And when you do you'll see why this base power change has all the negative feedback despite lack of toying around with it. 
---
Nurse needs her base power to win the game. It isn't a luxury like it is for other killers, it's a necessity. She literally cannot win without her power. Because of that, her power did not need nerfed without some kind of compensation to her base stats.
---
I think IDV limits group size above a certain rank. Even with comms, 2-man SWF isn't that bad.
---
They changed the purple instant heal to "15 sec endurance" and the red instant heal to "heals one health state over 8 seconds"
---
Nah she's actually pretty difficult to learn and master. Once you do however, you'll start to body everyone.
---
There's a difference in growing a viewerbase and just flat out self-plugging. You don't have to name yourself after your channel to play more than 1 game. If you're a good content creator and people like you for your personality, they will likely watch anything you make. Not because you put your online handle in your profile.
---
Not to mention the streamers that gather their friends to boost themselves (SWF), bully other players, or just straight up exploit bugs or glitches. To make their content "entertaining for their viewers". That kind of attention whoring is a whole other level of low.
---
So yeah, twitchies fully deserve to get a mori. They think they're the hottest shit, but they aren't and need to be put in their place.
---
Fear whatever happens to him is well deserved? i'll be here eating bloody popcorn while im waiting for some love for piggy and legion (and maybe the huntress, we all can dream).
---
If you want I can send over some pictures of me and my friends!
---
Yep. Attack the survivor rescuing before the save is done and bam, no Borrowed Time.
---
It's an ultra rare addon.
---
How would it kill them? They are at an advantage, this would just lower that a bit...
---
This game wasn‚Äôt built with swf in mind. Then they add it and balance goes to hell.
---
This is the only way I know that would balance everything. Keeping soloes good, keeping swf good but nerfed a bit, and keeping killers good 
---
If you have another idea please share
---
That seems about right.
---
Ace in the Hole, definitely.
---
Yep. I'm not very good, but whenever I play Spirit, I get 4k. I don't even understand how I do it, but I'm not complaining.
---
That point that fucking gold; he looked like he was scolding a dog who just peed on the rug or something. ‚ÄúNO, bad boy, bad!‚Äù
---
Now that's a good cosplay!
---
Perfect way for you to honor my main :D
---
115% was in Beta and earlier. Not in the actual release of the game.
---
They adjusted her Auto aim. But there were no direct changes to herself. Nerfs/Buffs.
---
I am ready for this.
---
I'm just imagining the survivors as they are running out shouting those speech bubbles.
---
Y'all really out here making me tear up thank you &lt;3
---
His chainsaw is his only ability and it slows him down slower than survivors and he struggles to hit them with it because he‚Äôs so slow. That‚Äôs from my understanding. He also doesn‚Äôt have anything to win a chase with other than bloodlust.
---
That's how it felt lol
---
She probably won‚Äôt be fine tbh, it normally takes 2 blinks to hit someone then the survivor get a 150% movement speed for 3 seconds while the nurse has a 95% movement speed, meaning they can easily break line of sight, all the while the Nurse has to wait six seconds for her blinks, she then uses those two blinks only to still be behind the survivor and having to wait another six seconds to blink on to them again and by that time they‚Äôre probably gone. I like the add on changes but honestly, Nurse is probably dead now.
---
Her name is literally feminine
---
Spirit lacking a vault animation is insult to injury tbh. One of the big issues I have with Spirit is that she has built-in mindgames along with such a strong power. ~~This is also why Spirit would still be fine if she was nerfed.~~
---
The lack of a vaulting animation honestly just feels lazy to me because she does have a vaulting animation in first person. It feels like they just didn't want to animate a vault for her and justified it with "it's part of her power." Yeah I understand that sometimes visuals need to exist for mechanics (IE so you know that you're vaulting) and other Killers have first person animations that don't look like their third person animations. (Notably Demogorgon's vault.) But there's a big difference between a mismatched animation and literally no animation.
---
Honestly as a spirit main myself I do agree prayer beads I pretty broken but I‚Äôve been looking at other complaints and one was she needs a vault animation because it‚Äôs not fair but she is literally the mind game queen so that‚Äôs a pretty dumb point and nerfing spirits ability just won‚Äôt work simply because if you nerf it she isn‚Äôt spirit and I just don‚Äôt understand what you could do to nerf prayer beads maybe make it ultra rare and make fathers glasses very rare but people will still complain because they don‚Äôt have quick reaction time and don‚Äôt run spine chill so I just don‚Äôt think they could do much
---
\-Hatches trows destroys downed pallets, after breaking a pallet you get a speed boost for 8 seconds.
---
\-You can carry 1 less hatchet.
---
I am happy and delighted with her addons being changed and nerfed. But not so much about her base kit. The pinnacle is just 1 addon though. Her new red one where she just becomes a mk1 killer. Like wtf
---
I guess that makes enough sense. He still feels more than powerful enough where I'm at, but around rank 10 you don't see a lot of god chasers.
---
It‚Äôs a known thing to the point of being a meme. Claudettes in bloody it dark clothes are referred to as Blendettes because they disappear in tall grass and the scenery, especially McMilain.
---
4 man swf:
---
Person 1: Hey I see the killer he's coming at me, everyone hop on gens and I'll loop
---
3 people doing gens and presuming they're a good survivor, you'll probably waste a lot of time.
---
As opposed to, with a non SWF game:
---
Person 1: Being chased
---
Person 2/3: Hiding in a locker/crouching because they hear a heartbeat, or crouching nearby to get WGLF stacks
---
Person 4: Looting crates/breaking totems/POSSIBLY doing gens
---
I forgot that the Halloween 4 mask looks like my dead uncles corpse
---
In some situations or on some maps it's about all you can do with his power, just negate BT and hope to get a kill. Usually only on really bad maps like Purgation or Torment Creek is that acceptable though, as well as all the gens being done.
---
*Bloodlusting nurse*
---
I don't get it personally
---
I haven‚Äôt played since before they added Ghostface. What the fuck happened?
---
Fat Kappa. Nurse just gave Huntress something from her "special medicine cabinet" 
---
Hint: the medicine is military grade morphine
---
You probably could have gotten downed and used DS.
---
Mad grit is pretty fun when some cocky swf group tries to go for a body block they can't get.
---
Excuse me, demo-dog is adorable.
---
When his mouth is closed, he looks like a disformed puppy 
---
When he opens his mouth, he looks like a flower.....
---
Actually, take that one back.
---
Anybody who doesn‚Äôt wear ships ahoy Steve or is an insult to the dead by daylight community and I really need to say anybody who mains Steve with it is a cunt
---
What perk is OoO? Fairly new to this game
---
Or you know, buff the killers who were struggling instead of leaving them struggling.
---
Problem with that, you cant play against a good nurse, and the fact that you‚Äôre on console means you havent gone against a good nurse. Im sick of people who oppose healthy changes to the game
---
Bill exists
---
COUGH COUGH COUGH COUGH COUGH.
---
I love CowsIAm
---
i mean to be fair, spirit's strongest build can pretty much only be countered by a perk that is literally only good against that build specifically. even against other spirit builds, it's a pretty bad perk. if you don't have spine chill, prayer beads is really unfun and unfair to go against.
---
her base kit shouldn't be nerfed though, all you really need to beat non-prayer beads spirit is iron will (which, unlike spine chill, is a fantastic perk in general) and a brain. hopefully, they'll learn that often it's just the add-ons that's the issue from what they're doing to nurse.
---
Boil over? I tested that in a private game and it literally did 0 difference.
---
Lmao noone used nurse on console in the first place, it already was only billies and spirits
---
Especially with the new cosmetic Clown is getting.. makes me want to play him.
---
Then I remind myself that it's not worth the emotional pain.
---
Awww, you made both of my dreams come true! Now i wish for more wishes!
---
What
---
No way you can juke the best nurse a few times and if she has three blinks your screwed
---
That sounds so stupid.
---
I have played Billy until level 50 and I never realized that he didn't have a single ultra-rare addon
---
Miss less blinks. The only thing that's changing is that your chases will be over is 12 seconds instead of 6.
---
Wait did they change her base kit too? Oh shit I missed that.
---
Isn't the cooldown like 2 seconds?
---
Anybody who mains Steve without scoops ahoy is a cunt
---
That ds plus head on stun on freedy was way too fucking funny, poor killer lmao.
---
At 2:27 I should have slow entered the locker to bait the DS, but I thought I could save it for my second hook. Though my team just ignored the second camp and did all the gens, which is the correct play instead of saving me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Like a few messages would go a long way. "I'm going for the unhook", "The killer's chasing me!", "I'm working on a gen", and "okay".
---
It's much more information than currently, so survivors would have to be given a nerf to compensate, but SWF already HAVE this info.
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but I fucking love this
---
I literally only played nurse but this has put me off so much
---
She has a TINY hit box tho. I always complain about not being able to hit the thicc.
---
That's because it is fucking stupid. 
---
They called this an add-on rework. It was a lazy rework covering a ham fisted nerf. 
---
F in the chat for Nurse. Killers lost the only consistent answer against the sweatfest survivors today
---
I'm glad the devs are finally nerfing her tbh. Hopefully they look at Spirit and Hillbilly next.
---
No I want his power to be completely rebuilt from the ground up, the way they did with Freddy
---
Teach me your ways!
---
&gt; maybe the people i played with just sucked tho
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
I mean there is the option of gun, but you're right, not the most original concept
---
Oh ok I haven't seen enough normal Steve's yet to know
---
Not really sure how I feel about all of this yet. I‚Äôll play with the changes and see how she feels.
---
Goodbye fren
---
God forbid you don't make a post crying about something.
---
Not at all
---
Billy?
---
3 seconds
---
that's totally not true nurse destroy solo and SWF. and with her nurse, she isn't that dead it is only if you are a bad nurse you need actually to get gud at her now.
---
No IMO but yeah normal Steve‚Äôs now that I think about it our sandbagging cunts
---
3 seconds per blink
---
yeeeaaaah. too painfully true
---
I really hope they take away billys chainsaw
---
Love it already
---
It was a nice two years with some bad issues but this is pushing me over the top. Still waiting on that console optimization too lol
---
I will say. I am very excited to use updated plaid flannel and the ultra rare that makes you walk fast. It will make getting the adept nurse on my console edition MUCH easier.
---
*sad asthmatic coughing*
---
Not a complain post, simply a meme fellas
---
I can't do this for any length of time, it kills my neck.
---
Now you have to actually be good! No more omega blinks for you!
---
Yeah, I have the thing where I have a few disorders up my ass, I meant offerings but couldn't find the word for it.
---
Object of obsession
---
No you can see that there isn't enough space for the numbers to be AND have a decent space between each category.
---
You can see that the space between the cristals and bloodpoints is the same than the real money thingy and the cristals
---
I've heard the 10th on a couple of speculative youtube videos. But can't for the life of me find it confirmed anywhere.
---
I want bubba to have iridescent marks need even more fast nascar bubba
---
You really think this will only add 8 seconds? What this‚Äôll do is make it so survivors have time to use their 150% movement speed to get away in those 8 seconds, meaning that even if the nurse blinks 100% accurately they still won‚Äôt catch up as the survivor will be out of their double blink range aka not even worth chasing anymore as the time it will take to get back to them isn‚Äôt worth it. You know how people meme about how once you get hit by legion you book it to the other side of the map? That‚Äôll basically be Nurse, the only difference being Nurse has a 95% base movement speed.
---
The quota is 4 common, 5 uncommon, 5 rare, 4 very rare, and 2 ultra rare add-ons.
---
I'm hoping the add-on changes are mostly positive for them, especially poor Bubba who needs some love.
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Object\_of\_Obsession](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Object_of_Obsession)
---
Literally don't give a *single* fuck about Prayer Beads as long as Mother-Daughter Ring's in the game.
---
tbh I've never had a problem with Prayer Beads but I also hard run Spine Chill basically 24/7 so I realize I'm the exception to the rule.
---
To be exact it isn't the first time nurse gets some bigger changes. The first ones were the change of her 3 blinks to 2 and movement speed adjustment and her second one were allowing her to blink onto different height levels. I know it is a meme but it isn't entirely accurate
---
Your parents not give you enough attention as a kid?
---
It okay. I‚Äôm sorry if I came off as aggressive. I can relate to that since all of my survivor games were trash as well living that solo survivor life, tunneling killers, and mori‚Äôs. Followed with wait times seeming like forever as killer. This game is great at bringing emotions out of people
---
This. You can't play hag like you do other killers. You don't chase survivors, you set traps and ambush them (unless you're doing bodyblocker hag, which is also really good if you know where to put traps).
---
Her 'mindgames' consist on standing still, literally anyone can do that, doesnt require skill or practice, and even if the survivor wins the 50/50 you can in fact go into phase and catch him anyway. Thats the most annoying aspect for me, it doesnt matter if you are making the better decisions, if you are winning the chases, one phase walk on a good headphone set its a free hit, there are no normal fundamentals  of dbd chasing mechanics which i find is lowering the skill ceiling overall of killer gameplay. People want easy games, they dont actually want to be skilled at the game, so while they allow players to have a shortcut to victory people will play spirit as much as they do currently.
---
What..? The nurse was never released in beta. The only character in the beta was trapper. When nurse was released she was 115% with 3 blinks.
---
Never used addons or offering apart from pudding
---
Thanks for answering me! I'm not sure how useful it is to compare two heinous acts like that. I'm happy to consider them both absolutely horrible and leave it at that, personally. Lol
---
Yeah its nice using 2 perks that work together well. Not so situational but i use dance with me and lithe together and disappear cause im not the best at looping
---
Isn't the whole point of Feng's character to be a lone wolf only really cares about herself.
---
Perk like technician actively punish you for working with people.
---
Alert let you know when the killer is breaking something typically when they're in a chase so you know the stick away from that area.
---
Lithe is an exhaustion perk which means it's kind of selfish in fact the most debatably altruistic exhaustion perk is head on.
---
Also the lore on her and Devs outright referred to her as a lone wolf.
---
I'm a Feng Min main and I could tell you based on her perks alone she is probably a very terrible teammate more so if you include her lore.
---
I just went up against a SM Myers (loving the dedication some players are having toward an authentic Halloween BTW) :/ he was running alongside me for I don't know how long before I noticed...my skin is still crawling.
---
Can you sauce me up on that?
---
Honestly they only gave me attention when they were alive ASSHOLE
---
Joey gives you a frozen hot pocket and calls you a loser
---
She was not laughing
---
Please tell me you DID use your mori!
---
I‚Äôm taking that as a no
---
https://www.facebook.com/groups/deadbydaylight/permalink/2579476298775208/
---
Most killers get pretty weak at red ranks lol
---
You activated my Trap Card "Balanced Landing!"
---
Take that as a no U
---
Shit that‚Äôs true
---
I‚Äôm not opposed to balancing the game. I‚Äôm just sick that devs keep nerfing killers and not swf. If they nerfed swf, I would be 100% ok with them nerfing Nurse and Spirit. There‚Äôs a reason why you only see Nurse, Spirit, and Billy at red ranks. 
---
You have obviously never gone against sweaty red rank teams. You either play Spirit/Billy/Nurse, or you get bullied. No matter how well you play, you have to hope they make a significant mistake for you to have a chance to win. With these killers, you can afford to make more mistakes. It Just sucks that there‚Äôs one less killer to counter them. 
---
I‚Äôm not even asking for much. Just make it so that if they are in a swf team, gens take 20 seconds longer to be completed. That‚Äôs it. Make rework some broken maps and you can do whatever you want with Nurse
---
Nice job!!
---
I played with a doctor who used shock 90% of the time.
---
O hooks 5 Gens, all escape
---
I played one with a doctor who used shock 0% of the time
---
0 hooks, 5 gens, all escape.
---
The doctor is bullshit
---
Just admit you got stomped by a spirit and be on your way, seeing these constant posts about it in my feed is just beating a dead horse by this point.
---
Then you‚Äôll be fine. Stop bitching
---
Allright
---
Nope  100% deserved
---
Was not expecting for them to give love to the other medkit addons, thought that they were just gonna balance the instaheals and be done with them. Nice to see we got some goodies out of it.
---
console?
---
No that‚Äôs nea
---
Goddamn, as a Legion player, seeing how you completely outplayed them hurts inside
---
Am I the only one that loves insta heals I love how survivors bring them over flashlights and toolboxs because there way stronger then an insta heal. Now everyone will take flashlights instead.
---
Bad take
---
What are the killers gonna cry about now with the insta heals gone?
---
I still don't think it's worth a perk slot, why gamble that it's going to work instead of choosing a perk that WILL work
---
I main Ash so iron will is a must to keep his loud ass hollering and sniveling to a minimum.
---
Nice montage, make more. :D
---
if they wiggle at all they get hooked.  If they don't wiggle they get the hatch.
---
And keys both unfairly shorten the game.
---
It makes no sense. The Nurse was the one thing killers had against experienced survivors. And then they nerf her into ground because redditors complained.
---
Don't touch my bones, tapp!
---
Pig is Undetectable?!
---
Is this...a Pig buff?
---
She's great at running the killer around and letting everyone complete gens
---
Hex marriage?
---
It's gonna be fast regardless, the game is designed that way
---
why is your perks yellow?
---
I already said that I know not all swf are that way
---
But it‚Äôs ignorant to say they aren‚Äôt there.  And they aren‚Äôt that rare either.
---
It‚Äôs really not worth discussing here though... we won‚Äôt reach an agreement, so whatever.  Agree to disagree
---
Can we rework Morris now I think they are just as bad
---
I do agree with this, but can we just slide Legion into a C tier?
---
Gold perks?
---
Some good stuff here! No more insta heals, survivors finally getting BP for a teammate DCing, and the Undetectable status for the stealthy killers. The charm thing sounds interesting; I‚Äôm very curious to see how that‚Äôll work.
---
It was a much welcome change. Hopefully it'll mean more people will scavenge for totems, it along with other anti totem perks like inner strength end up making perks like noed become less of a problem for most people.
---
I made that comment ironically if that counts.
---
Excuse me, but bubba is a big cute baby
---
Moris need some sort of skill check/quick time event to them or something
---
Finally we get points for wiggling on the killers shoulders. Now he gave a reason to damage our controls lol.
---
yes rejoice
---
Yeah, we played for a few hours had a blast!
---
I love how accurate your description is! I was getting a puke daily on Plague and had a Jake that kinda didn't understand what me standing in front of a hooked dude letting him wiggle meant. He ran off and I looked at the hooked guy, his scratch marks, back at the hooked guy, and then chased and killed the Jake. The hooked guy got the message, I think 360 vomit was the key.
---
Sorry that's just a bug, it was supposed to be a nerf.
---
&gt;Added a new Survivor score event for wiggling in the Killer's grasp. 25 Bloodpoints per second.
---
Added a new Survivor score event for dropping a pallet while in a chase. 200 Bloodpoints.
---
Added a new Survivor score event for fast vaulting while in a chase. 100 Bloodpoints.
---
Added a new Survivor score event when other Survivors in the trial disconnect. 600 Bloodpoints.
---
Lovely
---
It's only a gamble if survs literally spawn on it, which is rare.
---
Otherwise it will slow the game down even if they find it. A lot of survs just jump on the first gen they see.
---
All slowdown perks are kinda situational but ruin is going to slow down the game, at least a little.
---
Thing like thantatobia and dying light are good but they require you to get pressure early or lose quickly.
---
Custom perk icons, you can find a tutorial and a bunch of custom ones at r/perkbydaylight
---
detective's hunch sounds really fun now, throw on open handed and a map for the meme and you'll know where everything is after the first gen
---
Yeah being able to instaly nullify the killers time investment into chasing and downing people was pretty bonkers. Its a nice and welcome change.
---
Keys and maps having pallets and windows.
---
i mean it's good and all until one post game lobby isn't edited out and you see that the rank of the killer who swung into every single window is a rank 16..
---
This was absolutely needed, now they can simply heal quicker then r offer protection when needed instead of just magically extending the chase by another full cycle.
---
You can check r/perkbydaylight on how to do it and which packs people have created
---
get a second monitor and watch the streams
---
People on Twitter were saying they should Nerf NOED if they were going to nerf InstaHeals
---
Like the only thing you have to do is cleanse Totems and you don‚Äôt even have to worry about it.
---
And do they not realize the devs have been putting in perks/updating perks that ENCOURAGE and REWARD doing totems lol
---
Jimmy neutron dlc when?
---
My hag keeps freezing for 1 or 2 seconds after I place a trap. Dose anyone else have this happen?
---
time to bring out my friend Boil over.
---
Nah. literally so much has already been taken away from survivors due to killers crying
---
Naw Mori's will probably get a buff to kill anyone instantly after 1 hit. also I expect a killer speedboost soon
---
Insta heals are gone but yet killers still have their noed with the speed boost as well as their mori‚Äôs.
---
&gt;Updated certain Killer powers with the Undetectable status effect: The Shape in Tier I of Evil Within, The Pig while in crouch mode, The Wraith while Cloaked, The Ghost Face while in Night Shroud.
---
**STEALTH MAINS RISE UP!**
---
He will most likely be camped (Wich is fair in my opinion), so it's your call. If you have a perk that could save you after unhooking, you should go for the save, better if you also have Borrowed Time, so both of you have a bigger chance to escape.
---
But if the killer have No One Escapes Death (NOED) I would advise you to escape, as you said you're a new player and you would be downed with one hit.
---
I personally think that there is not a right or wrong answer here, but the feeling of saving the last hooked teammate and escaping together is awesome (and also more bloodpoints).
---
I'm a survivor main.
---
You wanna make the killer think you're gonna be one place but then don't be in that place. There are some pretty ridiculous loops to be sure but if you can create distance and waste a killer's time without needing a pallet or window, you're way ahead of the game.  
---
When I play survivor I am constantly thinking about how to break the killer's line of sight. Because survivors can see around corners, you can still see them even though they can't see you. Use this to your advantage - walk around an obstacle, confirm for yourself that they are headed to the other side of that obstacle to cut you off, and then turn around and go the other direction.  
---
It's all about keeping the killer in view, anticipating what they think you'll do, and not doing that. It's really difficult to just keep saying that over and over in a different way. It might help to play a lot as killer just to get a better understanding of what their limitations are.
---
I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt win at all with other killers. You could 4k with Wraith at red ranks if everything works out.
---
I‚Äôm just saying that red rank swf= omega blink nurse. I have actually wanted Nurse to be nerfed for a long time since I know she‚Äôs annoying to go against and sometimes impossible. Especially if you play solo. The problem is that I assumed they would nerf both Nurse and SWF at the same time. 
---
Good SWF and Omega Blink Nurse have the same problem. And that is that it doesn‚Äôt matter how well you play, you‚Äôre likely going to lose. And that‚Äôs frustrating. Knowing that the outcome of the game isn‚Äôt determined by your ability, but rather things that are out of your control
---
I main Ghostface and I‚Äôm pretty good with him. But when I go against these teams I‚Äôm lucky to get 1 kill. THAT‚ÄôS how you know something is wrong with the game‚Äôs balance. They body block. Insta-heal. Use Haddonfield offering while equipping Balanced Landing. Force you to take the DS. Etc. And to top it off, they T-Bag at the exit and send you messages calling you trash killer. 
---
The reason why I‚Äôm angry with these changes, even though I don‚Äôt play Nurse, is because it gives me less hope that the devs will ever fix this. To me this proves that they aren‚Äôt aware of the real issues with this game.
---
But hey, at least they got one more killer they can bully. Next up is Billy. Devs already said they were going to tweak him
---
I saw medkits getting increased healing speed and was not happy, then I saw removal of the insta heals. This is a pretty good trade off.
---
Probably never, since we can't handle the neutron style.
---
who's "we"?
---
Hawt diggity dawg, my dude, if that ain't a clear camp n' tunnel I dunno what is. Even added the flair of ignoring the other guy trying to distract him from you.
---
I mean, instaheals have been a problem for a while now, so its reaaaally good that they are gone.
---
I am mostly annoyed at her base power now. Some of her addons just make little sense to me e.g the one where you just become a m1 killer basically losing your power. It was the omega blinks and 5 blink nurses that made her overpowered. Not base blinks. The thing that killed nurse is stealth. If she cant find or see survivors she is going to have a hard time, but survivors are just used to pallet looping. It just made the game more interesting.
---
I later had a hag that let me and another survivor escape when our two teammates DC'ed, and the fact she did little spins right next to us finally clued me in lol
---
Dude you need to say you got this off of cowsiam or you are plagiarizing and that can most likely get you banned off this community
---
You cant fairly nerf swf dude. The power of communication outweighs any other nerf you give them
---
Guess I'll need to play a bit more. Even though I got Claudette to level 50, I legit feel like I don't know anything about playing the game
---
We got a buff!!! Pig got a buff!!!
---
Got a youtube link? Upload it if you haven't already
---
haha me
---
Killers can always burn the Lerys offering if they don't want pallets and windows D:
---
Thats my strategy if I play against people and I think that they know how the game works. However sometimes you play against people and you realize that they seem to be new to the game. If thats the case I will got to my two times wiggle plan. (Btw. same goes for the killer, if I play against a killer who hasn't hooked anyone and theres only one gen left, they will atleast get to kill me).
---
Pig mains be like "One more nerf and I get to pass to the survivor's side, maybe its for the best."
---
I hate everything about this undetectable change. Already hated going against Ghost Face to begin with, now perks like Spine Chill are useless against him.
---
All of these were at red ranks with killers either at purple or red rank. Rank doesn't matter, but to get to that point you have to have some level of competency. The goal to getting killers to swing is to really sell the fact that you're vaulting. 
---
Obviously I have countless unrecorded situations where I try to fake window vault and I get downed cause the killer learned or already knows. 
---
You can believe what you want but either way it was fun making thos montage
---
Base blinks she was broke too if the nurse was good. Her base power is the same but nerfed slightly. 3 seconds for a blink to recharge isnt very long at all
---
I feel the medkit should not get used up as killers will see that and pick the survivor up right away
---
nurse nerf, nice
---
Should have put a comma I suppose
---
I'm not seeing Nea on this list?
---
Holy crap could you imagine
---
Devs say they won't change it because it's meant to be hard mode
---
New survivor's score events!! YE!!!
---
You realise how OP that would be right?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs true. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm disappointed they essentially got rid of one of the three killers that can counter them.
---
I‚Äôll just main survivor from now on. It‚Äôs less frustrating
---
I don't know why it doesn't get more respect.  I love this perk.  Pretty much cancels all survivor mindgames after fast vaulting.
---
doctor is the next one
---
It nullifies BT regardless of level as there will be no terror radius to be in while unhooked.
---
But the nurse has wipe animation, and fatigue and a 3 second blink cooldown, so you have plenty of time to run.
---
ah a mori never looked so good
---
i just hook them if they wiggle and then tell them in post game chat if they hadn't wiggled I would have given them the hatch
---
Good perk on nurse
---

The medkit changes are very interesting. Now they heal others faster, while the E-Medkit is better for self heals, and Ranger Kit just holds lots of charges in general. 
---
As for the instaheal changes, I'm not sure how I feel. I'll have to try them out, but it seems interesting nonetheless.
---
If they nerf keys, I‚Äôm done with this game. They‚Äôve already nerfed BNP, Exhaustion, Mettle Of Man, now insta heals? Lol I remember when dbd promised ‚Äúbatshit crazy perks, items, addons‚Äù with new chapters, but they lost their balls.
---
Instead of making counters, they just water shit down til it‚Äôs useless. It‚Äôs boring.
---
Let me press F on the world's smallest keyboard for you.
---
shes still gonna be really powerful, its more of a rework than a nerf. some of her uncommon addons are super powerful and she now walks at a normal speed so ontop of the blinks she can also just play as a normal m1 killer. i still agree that survivors are op right now tho.
---
3 seconds for each blink starting at the beginning of fatigue.
---
&gt; And do they not realize the devs have been putting in perks/updating perks that ENCOURAGE and REWARD doing totems lol
---
Yups. They've been putting more perks and more rewards for cleansing.  Noed really shouldn't be a problem even in random situations where only one or two people scavenge for totems.
---
And they finally are addressing insta heals! Big changes coming, I just hope they don‚Äôt break the game.
---
spine chill is still gonna work. undetectable only blocks auras
---
Finally survivor chase points increase! Thank fuck! It's very long overdue.
---
INSTAHEALS ARE GONE BOIS
---
90% of the time, insta heals are used on tunneling killers. It wasn‚Äôt needed, it‚Äôs just more killer belly rubbing.
---
Fucking deserved, I would have laughed my ass off if I was that guy.
---
Yeah that works too.
---
I thought it was Quentin...
---
Still need to get rid of/rework Moris and keys
---
Not tried that yet but i used urban evasion with it which was nice. Get away quick and hard to track with lithe and dance with me and when the 3 seconds is up go straight to crouch and moving wuick
---
NOED. Moris. Prayer Beads. Tombstones.
---
But survivor's ultra rares can't be good.
---
Which is how it should be. It's literally the worst as a stealth killer to have people know when you're looking at them.
---
ü§°
---
Hopefully all or most of those new score events are in the Survival category. There's still so few scoring events for it.
---
Fair enough. I think I know everything now, thanks for the help
---
They have been catering to the killers a lot lately
---
Spine chill also won't work against her!
---
Yep my point exactly but still a lot of people dont notice it
---
‚Ä™@DeadByBHVR Please don‚Äôt remove instaheals! Styptic and anti-hemorrhage are two of the rarest items on the bloodweb and that‚Äôs if you come across them and not one of the rare/ultra-rare parts for flashlight, toolbox, key or map.....‚Ä¨
---
Won‚Äôt be long till they get rid of keys lol
---
Omega blink is double range addons.
---
You literally got obsession right after you got off the killer, why are you lying?
---
That‚Äôs what ya get for playing the rude grill
---
Get out of here YoshiP you're drunk.
---
nah cause DS proves that skill checks aren‚Äôt hard to hit, rework so it takes 2 hooks or something like that
---
I dont think my editing is YouTube upload worthy, I'm a little clunky on the edits and I dont even have after effects, I'm using Sony Vegas which feels like nails on a chalk board trying to edit with
---
The latter is very likely - inexperienced or overly altruistic survivors will suffer against almost any killer.
---
Bubba is considered underpowered because he has no map pressure, and no real way to generate it with this power.
---
Mobile killers pressure by their presence, trap killers pressure by constantly forcing interaction, stalk killers pressure by paranoia and fast hooks, but Bubba has nothing going for him.
---
Bubba has a very powerful basement/hook game, in that it's very hard to take something from him, but that won't stop survivors doing gens.
---
This changes if you load him up with instasaw (Primer Bulb and Carburetor Tuning Guide) and Play with your Food, because suddenly he becomes a 130%  movement speed killer with an instadown. The additional speed means he can physically pressure a larger area than just his basement, and can make a mockery of most loops. Really worth looking into because there is nothing as salty as a high-end SWF that just got wrecked by Bubba.
---
The only thing I'm confused about is why they're going to the hatch if the timer has started
---
Wait what she gona have a meter to her power?
---
Oh is it? Damn then that's not a good very rare add on. I thought it was just a base speed increase for 60 secs. They should add that she CAN blink too. That give it atleast a bit more power or scrap the add on completely and do something else
---
I am not experiencing this on my PS4 - is your fan kicking in when this happens?
---
It is factually a significant nerf. It is not a buff or a change, she is being made actively worse by the change.
---
It's significant because it makes the best killer in the game worse, and hits every aspect of the killer that made her good in the first place.
---
So her cooldown is pretty much 2 seconds?  Nurse main
---
If I lost but I saw that at the exit gate I'd be happy
---
I know lol, that happened to me only once and I was quite pissed back then. Trapper is still fun to play for me.
---
To me though the medkit should not be used up on use though cause it sorta makes it impossible to get that save since killers will see it break and just pick them up right away
---
you can play whatever you want but no one said anything about winning
---
I love legion. I'm a Frank main on PS4. I usually play on Xbox but I don't have legion on it. Only reason I am a Frank main is because I'm not giving BHVR money for a skin that's gonna bring salty messages to me.
---
As an Ash main, groovy. But all his perks are trash.
---
2 seconds per blink. You will need to wait 4 seconds to use your second blink.
---
Increased Dull Key's channeling to 20 seconds.
---
Removed Skeleton and Dull Key's ability to open hatch.
---
Don‚Äôt threaten us with a good time! Entity Pleased
---
Not a bad idea but they need to remove the yellow mori in that case and maybe make the green more common.
---
For all those trying to argue Myers is not pure evil, here is a quote from Dr. Loomis from the 1978 OG Halloween (the one our Mike is based off of afaik) keep in mind Loomis is the only one who knows Micheal well and we are meant to take his word as truth regarding Micheal. Everything he says that can be proven true is, so we have no reason to assume anything he says is wrong.
---
"I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil."
---
Pure and simple evil. That is Micheal Myers.
---
Bow that we are finally seeing something done to Nurse to make her less powerful, what can the dev's do to Spirit's Prayer Beads add-on to make it less op?
---
wow yeah that's important. does it still disappear in the ptb right now?
---
I never see Feng Mins do this. I main her and if I fail a skill check I either A) hide behind the closest debris for like 5 seconds bc I hear the killer nearby or B) keep working on the gen because DBD didn‚Äôt raise no bitch. 
---
I usually see Megs sprint burst away or a Claudette who will just ditch and never come back.
---
Noed is countable by doing bones it's fine the way it is
---
Moris do need a nerf but I think Cypress and ivory are fine the way they are it's just the ebony that is a massive problem.
---
Prayer beads needs to be reworked 
---
Considering tombstone is needed to get an achievement I don't think they're going to change it unless they change the achievement
---
dude... you havent played her and you ask for changes?!?!?!?!?!??! wtf!!
---
This is what we call the Cuckmaster Dwight build lol
---
Oh boo hoo you cant instaheal anymore the humanity.
---
The key word in that sentence was "if". Nurse can only be good if they can read/predict what the survivor is doing. Also the recharge for a blink is quite a big thing in this game. Time is everything to a killer in this game. Basically their health bar. At more time passes more gens are done etc. 3 seconds by itself does not mean much but as it adds up it becomes really noticeable especially since the blink is the main way for nurse to make it across the map and her still being slower than a running survivor kinda just doesnt make sense after this patch.
---
I‚Äôm not sure ik it was in the changes and if that really does happen it‚Äôs sorta worthless for saves for a pink add on
---
Ngl for multiple days in a row and this is on console whenever I played nurse I always got autohaven wreckers, similar bug?
---
Cut it out.
---
I don't really play legion much tbh im more of a pig/doctor/bubba main
---
You‚Äôre acting like BNF and Mettle of Man weren‚Äôt OP
---
and I‚Äôm not saying that Killers don‚Äôt have OP things either
---
Thank you very much!
---
Wut? I mean I don't know how they'll make pennywise if they end up adding it but I was referring to the clown form when I said he was humanoid
---
The yellow Mori is the most balanced cause it‚Äôs a the end of the game and it can stay.  The green mori should be you can kill one player after getting at least 5 hooks or something like that, not sure about the ebony
---
Moris are next imo, it‚Äôs just a matter of time.
---
I haven't removed they made them more balanced this way you can't completely reset a killer's progress for free
---
No I mean we only lost our last Ultra Rare. At least all killer Ultra Rares suck!
---
Oh, wait...
---
ahh ok.  Yeah on PC if killer dc's you keep your stuff.
---
joking but it is coming.  On the plus side, playing killer has never been easier. Almost a joke most matches and ive been playing since 2016.  So ive been my fair share of ups and downs.
---
I hope you‚Äôre joking üòÇ
---
I'm not sure. Presumably other aura-reading perks too like Dark Sense? 
---
I'm guessing it doesn't affect Spine Chill.
---

---
+ Content - New cosmetic type: Charms. Maximum of three (3) attach to a Survivor‚Äôs waist, or on a Killer‚Äôs hook in the environment. Customization UI has been updated to reflect this.
---
OMG. What are these? Are we getting minipets (charms) already? I just joked about that when I saw that they had cute rats on the hooks in Hawkins Power and Light Labs...
---
The instant heal one is not bad, they should prob nerf moris somehow though as they are pretty much as bad. And maybe make it so the medkit does not break when using the pink add on
---
Now that insta heals are gone, can we do the same to moris?
---
&gt; Styptic Agent: Applies the Endurance status effect for 15 seconds on use. Use with secondary action. Depletes Med-Kit on use.
---
&gt;Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe: Heals Survivor passively over 8 seconds. Time is modified by perks and add-ons that affect healing speeds. The effect is cancelled if the Survivor changes health state or picked up. Depletes Med-kit on use.
---
Thank god. These are actually reasonable now and not complete bs.
---
&gt;Mettle of Man: Made it so the perk can be activated and triggered more than once.
---
Ah yes. Now I can lose the game even harder trying to get mettle of man to work.
---
No man, killers need a buff. Probably something like 5 killers vs 1 survivor would be more fair of a game mode
---
Woah, for real? I am a Pig main and I did not realize that. That is a HUGE buff. No more crabwalking at gens in case survivors have spine chill active.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Its hard enough to get it to work once lol.
---
You‚Äôre speaking of people in general, when I‚Äôm specifically talking about women. Women in America are more likely to die from heart failure due to simply too much eating much more than they are to even encounter rape, let alone die from the assault. 
---
It‚Äôs still irrational that the general consensus of thinking among them is ‚Äúact that is under 3% likely to happen, that is even significantly less likely to end in actual death &gt; acts that are far more likely to happen in everyday life that absolutely result in death‚Äù. 
---
What‚Äôs worse than dying? Apparently the very thought of being attacked sexually by a unwanted, dare I say, unattractive male to them.
---
True but I‚Äôm a p2 rank 12 Claudette and yet I know what I‚Äôm doing so I actually commit to gens and loop the killer the problem is with me ranking down is I loop the killer the entire match. My point is that not everybody is good in green ranks
---
Yeah it means you'll actually have to use them strategically instead of just spamming them left and right
---
I meant little as in comparison to Billy, spirit or nurse
---
Basically worthless buff considering the problem with MoM is that you can't get it to pop off in the first place
---
I'd pretend to feel bad for clout, but then I remember all the awful games i've had with omega blink nurses.
---
Pff it can barely get used once. Good luck even dreaming of using it multiple times
---
Honestly, I would rather go up against nurse. Nurse requires skill to perform well, unlike the spirit. Sorry spirit mains, but you know it's true.
---
Nerf killers!? The blasphemy! THEY NEED MOAR BUFFS!
---
If your defending instaheals i dunno what to say
---
It's literally the worst as a stealth survivor to have multiple killers with add-ons that literally just reveal my aura.
---
It may well be the timing - remember, this is a game where a seemingly safe grab is downgraded mid-animation to only being a hit.
---
Might be worth creating a KYF to confirm what's happening on each other's screen whenever he flashes - maybe they're only revealed when the flashing ends? Maybe u/int3r4ct has tested?
---
Its not the same interaction for everyone, im not saying i could 100% of the time, but I, personally, think that I could juke the best nurse 2-3 times before getting downed, which is not that much, but it can save a bit of time.
---
Yeah, they should definitely change that.
---
Its really cool on console how that doesnt happen
---
neither of those are actually quite as bad, moris certainly need to be tweaked. But keys... maybe some slight changes?
---
If you know what you're doing you can 4k as any killer.
---
Did he camp/tunnel anyone else after you, or was it random after that? Cause I've played against a few Ghosts that facecamp one by one to win. And who knows what goes on in their minds, maybe he has PTSD of other Dweets bullying him
---
Thanks, this helps alot!
---
Might be, but in my case nurse is just an example. It happens with any other killer, but this post probably won't be much upvoted sadly. This is the kind of issue that should be fixed asap, and what is more, I wonder how this is even possible to happen?
---
Mettle of man was broken there was no way they could add counters without reworking the perk.
---
Insta heals were justifiable as well you could practically remove a Killer's progress for freeze which was not fun.
---
I will agree they went overboard bnp
---
As for exhaustion they did that because the point was for you to lose the killer not drag them on an endless chase
---
Aww, what a nice compliment! Practice! I‚Äôve been drawing on and off for 25+ years!
---
She doesn't have any cool teeth though. I guess that's a fair nerf...
---
One thing that just sprang to mind, so I haven't given a lot of thought to it, is to slow her phasing movement speed a lot while phasing. Her mobility is one of her strongest points, and reducing that is (in my opinion) a fair trade for basically being undetectable while phasing except against Spine Chill.
---
But again, I haven't really given much thought to that so some may disagree/have other suggestions.
---
Hopefully they do otherwise 20 bucks seem a little much
---
Bloodlust is a outdated mechanic in modern context, and if BHVR were rework the ancient atrociously safe loops and made them more manageable for killers to deal with, Bloodlust would be a huge issue. Bloodlust, in the context of unsafe loops, is not a fair mechanic as if you can‚Äôt work around a unsafe loop you can just wait to get a 5%/10%/15% speed bonus and just outrun the survivor on the loop. It encourages a mindless behavior to just wait to get stacks and get a hit when with patience and practice you can achieve more effective results. I play a lot of killer &amp; survivor, and never have I ever had fun with bloodlusting as it‚Äôs called. Like what argument is there for bloodlust outside of the context of broken/safe loops? In the modern design philosophy of DBD, bloodlust should simply not exist.
---
He really really does. Maybe they could just remove/lessen the penalties on the chili and make the chili actually have a noticable positive effect as a bandiad fix before giving him the Freddy treatment
---
Unruly toddler may be the most apt description of survivors that I've ever heard
---
Rifts cost 1,000 auric cells, and you can get 1,000 auric cells on the Premium track.
---
Link?
---
Dude that build is ridiculous what makes you think he‚Äôs bad just bc he said the build should‚Äôve been nerfed
---
Instaheals are whack, glad they are gone.
---
Now hopefully we can get Mori‚Äôs and NOED changed too.
---
I think I've only ever faced one ghost face that didn't face camp. He was always my least favorite killer to play against starting out because they'd always face camp but once I started ranking up they started getting dunked on more often
---
I felt the same way when I started playing, but I could already use some end game perks because I was playing in my friend's account for a few days and he taught me the basics.
---
Focus on unlocking the perks you think are useful, watch some content if you want to speed up the process (look for the channel "not Otzdarva" on YouTube) and if you're like me and doesn't have money to spend on the DLCs keep an eye on the Shrine, it can offer good perks sometimes (either from free or paid characters), the last few weeks it of offered great paid perks both to Survivors and killers.
---
Good work and thanks for the inspo to keep my cosplay project alive. Currently working on a Leatherboi one myself.
---
r/technicalythetruth
---
Killers HATE him. Click here to find out why.
---
Cmon now man
---
Nice! Keep going cx!
---
Bro you're work is great, you're being to hard on yourself. You'll never know how your work will be received on youtube till you try. Even if one guy like me enjoys it then you've already done a pretty good job so far
---
Not gonna lie you're a bit behind lol
---
Mettle of Man was buffed in the same way that Left Behind after the end game collapse. It's still useless, but more appetising. Seriously, the problem is that MoM is too hard to activate and they made that it ca be activated more than once?
---
If say the Friday the 13th game has worse facial animations. Not to mention the legal debates.
---
Imagine being so sad that you need to leave a comment like that on reddit.
---
I may be confused about this. I saw other replies saying Spine Chill wouldn't work, then some saying it would. So I don't know at this point. If it's just auras, that's a fine change IMO.
---
LMAO YOU DIDNT SAVE
---
Good point. I got decisive strike from the shrine
---
It's $10
---
yea. even before this nerf i enjoyed playing against good nurse more than spirit. spirit feals cheap whenever i die. doesnt really feel like i ever had a chance sometimes
---
However  mettle of man required no skill if if a survivor is able to juke my ass for a long time that is my fault for not leaving however if a survivor gets bailed out because of a perk and gets to extend the chase they should have lost that is unfair.
---
 Also sadly there was no way to counter MoM more than half the roster meaning that you just had to accept it that's not good game design whether you like it or not.
---
No it is not a smart idea to load the game with op perks because that leads to frustration on both sides. For example despite the fact that no one escapes death has a counter and can be taken out of play before it activates people still have a problem with it because of the power boost that is undeserved.
---
No one likes to feel cheated out of a win and no it breaks up the meta not an excuse to have bad game design elements.
---
Wastes way too much time. No one does that.
---
Shit guess the leak changed in the files it was 2000 cells good news
---
I could care less makes it easier to go against as a survivor
---
Did u forget the horn on backwater swamp. It always gets me.
---
What if they made it so the totem is in the crate and you have to drop the pallet to cleanse.
---
On one of the pictures there's something that says the alchemist, new killer or?
---
Fuck ok I‚Äôm down with that the files had it for 20 so they must have changed there minds about it
---
The only Nurse mains that are crying are the ones who abuse her overpowered add ons. The rest aren‚Äôt worried about it.
---
What happened? Nerf?
---
Bubba Sawyer needs a full deep masage Krueger spa day rework to get him up to snuff
---
I'll make sure to upload the halloween special I'm planning on to youtube. I have to grind out a bunch of clips before then and I still have to figure out a song to put it to. Who knows if it'll gain traction or not!
---
The urge to teabag is... irresistible for some.
---
1,100 cells is 10 dollars in the US. So at least for US customers the pass will cost slightly less than 10 dollars.
---
Pig mains thank you!!
---
It's 10 bucks not 20 and throughout completing it you practically get your auric cells back anyway
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand how both weren‚Äôt fixed at the same time. Now there‚Äôs like nothing to balance out the toxicity from both sides.
---
It no longer works on stealth killers. (Cloaked Wraith, Shrouded Ghostface, Crouched Pig, T1 Myers)
---
Damn, with the undetectable changes for the Pig does it mean Spinechill won‚Äôt work on her when she‚Äôs crouched anymore?
---
Make this happen please
---
so basically, it‚Äôs a battle pass with progressive challenges. it sounds overly complicated, but maybe I‚Äôm just not reading well. :p all I wanna know is, will all non licensed characters get cosmetics?
---
They‚Äôre probably gonna make Billy refill his chainsaw with gas. 
---
But down worry, he can still instadown. He just cant continuously rev his chainsaw like he used too 
---
I don‚Äôt know if anyone‚Äôs calling her ‚Äúbad‚Äù. She‚Äôs just not nearly as powerful as she was.
---
Alright, you know what.
---
I can dig it, this sounds cool
---
I can tell by your ghostface flair you are obviously not biased in any sort of way.
---
Why is it okay for survivors stealth to be nerfed so hard but yet the moment a survivor uses something like dark sense, premonintion, or spine chill it needs to be addressed? This perks are mid if only mid-high tier at best.
---
I will admit on this one thing. OoO on a survivor who knows how to loop is obnoxious. But other then that? All the other perks were fine.
---
All these perks for killer detection are gonna go the way of vigil.
---
F for my girl. She's been treating my depression since.... I've lost track tbh.
---
Everyone : cool
---
Nurse main : OMG SHE WILL BE UNPLAYABLE
---
Only her bullshit add ons were nerfed, now they are actually kinda fun. And a 3 seconds per blink cooldown isn't a big of a deal since it starts during the fatigue so the first token is given and then you just need to wait 3 fucking seconds.
---
So calm down
---
at least there is 2
---
without addons, nurse is still the same lmao
---
Why are they so afraid of just buffing perks? Why can't they give off-meta perks like Detective's Hunch a real buff? Give it an action speed increase on revealed objectives or something. This change is good, but it is far from enough to make the perk worthwhile.
---
Also the Mettle of man "buff" is completely pointless. If the devs actually played their own game, they would know that it is really difficult and borderline "throwing the game" to even get the perk to activate in the first place. Getting it to work twice in one game? Literally impossible.
---
the only thing I want is disconnects to be punished with temporary bans. seeing even the bigger twitch streamers DC on stream just encourages people to just DC if it's not an easy win. please devs
---
Just watched a Nurse game.  Not a whole lot has changed base blink wise.  She's as broken as ever.  
---
Battlepass and Archives are neat!   Gonna be a lot of grinding!!!  I'm excited!
---
I feel offended as a P3 Legion. I play him often in purple ranks and always get around a 3k sometimes I get unlucky and get a 2k but that's usually because I didn't  play well or didn't make a smart choice. (Btw I'm not mad, this isn't a hate comment. Just saying I like legion and can play well with him. Also I haven't made it to red ranks yet so idk how that is.)
---
My idea was similar to Iri Button. While phasing, her husk is mapwide so survivors won't hear the woosh sound and they will need to choose: keep doing the gen and fear a grab or stop what they are doing and losing time.
---
But it‚Äôs not op. Why would they nerf him if he‚Äôs not op. 
---
It‚Äôs like when they nerfed Wraith. They made a bad killer even worse. I don‚Äôt understand devs man
---
Nope, Nurse is just fine.    You guys are major alarmists.   Watch these Nurse games now, nothing major has really changed.
---
I think there is a distinction to be made between enjoying punk music/punk aesthetic and actually being punk. Punk is a lifestyle choice, and it spawned a genre of music and a fashion style, but the lifestyle came first.
---
Wounded Healer trophy being broken and unobtainable still not a recognized issue. u/peanits
---
I would just like to point out, at this exact moment, there are about 3 threads every 10 minutes, from survivor mains, complaining that they finally changed instant heal medkits, despite the fact that medkits as a whole actually just got buffed, heavily.
---
Kinda ish. ? They work in 8 seconds . A survivor could probably used if after getting hit and gain enough distance to still heal after that.   Itll just change the style of when you use it from using it stupidly in front of killer to actually calculating when to use it .
---
As your friendly neighborhood Sawyer main, I salute thee
---
The syringe effect is cancelled if the Survivor changes health state or picked up.
---
Ya I edited the comment I fucked up lol. It was 20 in the files but they must have changed it
---
Good point. This Amanda is probably 1 or 2 steps higher on the evil. I still feel like she‚Äôs below the torturers...unless we‚Äôre factoring in the impossible jigsaw traps. While usually quick, they can be tortuous. Still, I feel like someone like the clown that keeps people as victims until he‚Äôs done is way worse.
---
So cringey lmao
---
Aaaaaand Pig got buffed :'D
---
Reinforced hull please
---
That‚Äôs because she‚Äôs the entity
---
That‚Äôs right! Fuck BhVR and the moron devs who thought nerfing mettle of man to protection hits only was actually going to work, since most the time they don‚Äôt even register! 
---
Then they throw us a bone covered in shit saying here you can use it twice! 
---
It‚Äôs confirmed now all 3 of ash‚Äôs perks are straight shit thanks to the incompetent devs at BhVR Interactive!!!
---
Players: MoM condition is too hard to activate.
---
Devs: Let's make it twice.
---
MoM got the same buff of Left Behind after end game collapse: still useless, but more appetising.
---
Nice.
---
They mentioned Doctor, Hillbilly, Bubba, and Legion are all being looked at along with Nurse. Though Legion might get a bit more I think.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they do Bubba and Hillbilly together since they have nearly identical add-ons.
---
Huntress might get looked at down the line since she doesn't fit the criteria either.
---
Ok...care to tell me what it is tho? Last ptb I know of is before Stranger Things went live
---
I don't get it
---
Excuse me!? Softboy Sawyer should be SS tier
---
did someone leave in offering screen?
---
+1
---
# NIGERUNDAYO!
---
Why would Spine Chill be useless? It doesnt care about aura reading
---
Insta heals being gone is making you stop playing survivor? How many fucking insta heals did you get?
---
Nothing wrong with showing sympathy for those less fortunate.
---
The archives and the rift are seperate, but connected. The archive tomes, are permanent, these are where these  specific challenges live, you can take your time. Rifts are seasonal, and less based on specific challenges, and more on rift shards. Rift shards are acquired from normal play, along with exp, and are boosted by the same daily rules as exp. Rift shards can also be acquired by doing challenges in the current tome, so while doing those challenges would help you, they arent explicitely necesary.
---
You clearly have not seen the ancient classic that is Shrek is Love
---
Did they unbreak MoM?
---
I'm a little late, but I used to watch him a lot when he only really played at rank 1 before queue times became awful, and trust me he still 4k'd easily 99.5% of games. I don't think I've ever seen anyone open the exit gates on him in the past year I've been watching. He said it's happened a couple times though.
---
Yes, PGTW is a reward for hooking and winning chases. I'm not sure why that's bad? You can't just have a free slow down without doing anything. We're just talking about slowdowns here by the way, and not the state of lower tier killers, that's another issue entirely.  It's a VERY good perk now and I'm not sure how you could argue otherwise.   
---
Again, just increasing gen speed is really not healthy for the game now they've buffed several slow down perks. Encouraging additional objectives is healthy. Even adding additional objectives would be great. But I don't think holding m1 on a gen for longer than survivors currently do is exciting or riveting gameplay.
---
Gotta disagree that there's counterplay to Spirit than a killer who can literally phase through terrain at Mach 10.
---
Dwight, you are a madman and a hero and I love you.
---
Myers is smiling in the distance while touching himself and stairing at you....
---
Change Tombstone with Iri Heads. Tombostone is balanced, you are supposed to lose line of sight with Myers. Also he needs a lot of evil and he is slower.
---
Iri Heads are the problem here.
---
Where did you see 20 dollars. I only saw 10
---
And here you are with your mascara running cause for some reason this nonexistent problem gets to *you*.
---
Insta heals were completely frustrating if you were an M1 killer and got a downed survivor healed to full in front of you. It completely killed your pressure. I felt dirty whenever I successfully used a syringe on a team mate. 
---
As for iri heads, I [wouldn‚Äôt worry](https://clips.twitch.tv/TsundereScrumptiousPangolinTheRinger) about them for too much longer.
---
This whole community is full of crybabies. Survivors and killers. Survivors cry about NOED and other bullshit. Killers cried about DS and other bullshit. Mfs just love to complain
---
Sure she was she used to have 3 blinks by default instead of two
---
So you'd rather risk letting a survivor get off your shoulder after a who knows how long chase, because checking a locker for 3 seconds wastes too much time? I think you have your priorities mixed up
---
A smart nurse using the addon would blink attack someone going for rescue and let them save the hooked person and down the now no borrowed time survivor alot of killers with stealth can do this
---
It's pretty complicated but it has 2 parts. 
---
The Tomes are series of challenges with rewards, including new lore bits, and more will get added as the game goes on. They will always be available. 
---
The Rift is the Battle Pass that only stays for 70 days and can be completed just by playing the game. You can pay 1,000 auric cells for the premium track.
---
Survivors now d/c when they fail a skill check
---
To be fair, the game is very survivor sided. Especially at the high ranks. So it's no wonder they needed more survivor nerfs than killer nerfs.
---
My favorite is Leatherface even though he's low tier because he's simple, carefree fun. Even if everyone escapes the chainsaw frenzy paired with BBQ can still get me good bloodpoints regardless. Bubba is just cruise control mode and that's why I main him
---
Aww, you face camp with you get tbagged too?):
---
Nurse nerf removed insta heals added archives changed a few perks
---
Distortion is pretty bad tho, the 3 tokens barely last, also i wish it countered discordance..
---
The default screen when you get into the Archives is an animation of an old man holding the Rift device (can't remember the name). Possibly the Alchemist. [Vigo](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Vigo) could potentially be the Alchemist as well.
---
ah, thank you. idk if it‚Äôs just me but the way the wrote it was confusing.
---
As a Quentin main, I can agree with that.
---
I would actually love to see that kind of interactions xD
---
props.
---
I like too
---
Do you move faster with urban evasion as opposed to walking?
---
ok you are really ignoring the fact she has the same base speed as a survivor now as she cant spam blinks anymore its going to be impossible to keep pressuring the genz 
---
on top of that if you miss your blinks survivors are guarantee to escape 
---
the way i see it,they just made the hardest most frustrating killer in game even more harder and frustrating 
---
if before i'd play her only to get my dailys, now i will avoid playing her at all cost .
---
&gt; Again, assuming that the changes work exactly how they‚Äôre described, the only people who will really be hurting are those who relied on the massive blink add-ons to play the Nurse. 
---
we can all agree on one thing ,her addons were busted ,so if the idea is to "hurt" people who were abusing her addons why not just nerf the addons ?
---
Quentin's a gremlin.
---
Maybe. I don‚Äôt know though. Even that first scene of him as a clown kid after murdering his sister seemed like a kid not playing with a full deck. I can believe every card left in his deck IS evil, but he seems off. Like wearing a mask in broad daylight while obsessively staring at his sister and never saying a word...it just strikes me as not fully functioning.
---
Me as a Dwight
---
There's nothing wrong with pointing at a hook after the gate is opened and you know everyone can escape.
---
oh I forgot to change that part ya I thought it was 20 because they gave ppl like 20000 cels for ptb in the files so a lot of ppl assumed it was 20
---
If it works like other effects that remove terror radius, it won‚Äòt. Atleast when I used Dark devotion the people would still get bt no matter where the obsession was
---
He is right. More fatigue is a great disadvantage. Also, because the instant-blink distance you move is cut with consecutive blinks, 5 blink nurse is not worth it much...
---
Are there ones better than others I haven‚Äôt looked to far in
---
so they both give cosmetics then, no? or does the time just give bp and lore?
---
its not live on ps4. is it on steam only atm
---
I thought so as it‚Äôs going to be constant chases
---
Played against a billy who disconnected as soon as he found out the map was the underground complex.
---
rift rewards are also pretty much purely cosmetic, while archives can reward you with bloodpoints and whatnot.
---
I can definitely see why some might read it as her shoe, but I'm admittedly unconvinced, just because so much of her loadout is stuff she found in the bog.
---
Rename myself "Dont touch my chest senpai &gt;///&gt;" be ghostface with insidious,montorousshrine in the basement and watch my chest only attack if someone opens the chest and then make sure they die for touching my chest
---
That's what I thought but after I did it once, the killer got mad at me and thought I was BM'ing :(
---
... So the perk used to detect stealth doesn't do its 1 fucking job?
---
Fuck BHVR. I'm fucking done
---
Yeah at the end of each level there is a charm.
---
Those are the real heroes
---
Left behind has one use now, whenever you're bringing a key and the last man standing, no need to rush for the hatch as the killer will find it and then patrol the gates! Before it literally had 0 use so it's better than nothing
---
Medkits shouldn‚Äôt be depleted when you use the syringe if you‚Äôre gonna take away the insta heal.
---
I‚Äôve found that Swf are what mostly make the community bad. People tend to be nicer when they are playing by themselves from my experience.
---
Clown is the mehest meh. I dunno what you‚Äôd do about him.
---
I disagree. Wraith is just mediocre, so way better than Larry
---
Oh ok I just got worried for a second
---
I did that once and they had blood warden, got others killed because of it so I won't do it unless everyone is out
---
I sometimes do that to obviously very new killers who haven't gotten a single kill (or even a hook) and they're getting bullied. I see it as the survivor version of the killer giving the last guy hatch.
---
It's not toxic.
---
If they rework Moris and keys next I‚Äôll be totally fine with that.
---
God damn it back to premonition I guess
---
I did leave off Iridescent Head, however, tombstone piece will still end the game fairly handedly by eliminating a survivor with little effort. Probably at least 2.
---
With level 3, yes, I believe level 2 is either the same speed or barely faster, and level 1 is slower than walking. (Fixated notwithstanding)
---
i find it odd they give them so much cells for the ptb though unless it was going to be 20 but they changed there minds
---
Only people who use the word cringe/cringy unironically are cringy
---
But undetected states that it removes the terror radius just like Freddy's dream world.
---
Cant say I blame him but at the same time disconnecting is the cowards way out in my mind. I just played 2 treatment theater games in a row with billy and it was hell but I still played.
---
B-b-but EFFORT???? Poor survivors have to do something other than mindlessly afking at generators during a game?
---
The sun rises in the morning, survivors are crying about something, and other things that never change.
---
This really true? If it is this means I can play Doctor and get The Game consistently and torment people with Dr. Worldwide for free.
---
ITT: Assuming that Nurse is completely destroyed without even playing her yet.
---
I know she has the same base speed as a survivor, but a good Nurse doesn‚Äôt need to spam the blink button in order to be a force to be reckoned with regarding map pressure and chases. 
---
And missing blinks has always been a way to lose survivors in chases, that hasn‚Äôt changed. It just forces people to actually think and plan and use their blinks in smarter ways rather than just using as many blinks as possible.
---
You forgot the best killer. Nea
---
I'm glad the huntress is high up I mean who wouldn't want to hug huntress and cuddle with her?
---
You did great! own it!  
---
We shouldnt shun peoples art ever.
---
Pfft. No killer Ultra Rare will EVER get nerfed. It happened ONCE. Meanwhile BHVR has now made all 3 Survivor Ultra Rares pointless
---
I don't understand your point. Bubba can 100% his chainsaw and let go whenever he feels like it.
---
My thought is I want the real mother to sit on my face. I realize this isn't conductive to the discussion at hand but you asked.

---
Ye, it baffles me too because moris are even more of a game changer than insta heals. Removing (or tweaking) them at the same time would even reduce outrage from both sides.
---
In her spider form or her fake human form?
---
Nooo one of my go to perks...using it while I can I guess then change to either alert or premonition
---
ASH MAINS RISE UP
---
Is undetectable supposed to effect spine chill and premonition? Because it does as of right now.
---
Might be! I'm honestly not sure.
---
BHVR is buffing killers by nerfing survivors
---
I take it progression in this will be reset after the PTB right.
---
Is PTB ever on consoles?
---
I mean, saying shes the same is quite incorrect. BUT people are whining a bit hard about the changes, she's still a top tier, and is now easier to learn.
---
I may use insta heals a little differently, the only time I would ever use it in the killers face is if they were hardcore tunneling a teammate or we are standing in front of an exit otherwise it‚Äôs a waste because most of the time they just get injured again within 5 seconds. But I mainly use them on slugged survivors, or on myself if I‚Äôm on last hook and am being chased. I feel no pity for you if you slug someone and leave them to chase/find someone else. Don‚Äôt slug &amp; I wouldn‚Äôt have the chance to Instaheal.
---
Only downsides of nurse was her bad tracking and vision during exhaustion but like... she comes with nurse's calling.
---
I think I'm going mad. I read that sentence some ten times and I read the "beginning" part wrong. Damn.
---
THEY MURDERED MY FAVORITE ADDON.
---
But the Styptic is kind of cool.  DOES NOT MEAN I FORGIVE THEM FOR KILL MY INSTA HEAL.
---
Yeah, that's young Claudette. We saw a preview of her in the stream they revealed the Archives.
---
I'm gonna take a guess and say the guy on the right is Evan MacMillan aka The Trapper before the Entity.
---
Ah my bad, do you know when the patch will be fully out?
---
And Macmillan before he became the trapper. Seems like with the archives they are going to be working their way forward.
---
I wanna join need to get better
---
Also what appears to be Pre-Killer Evan on the right.
---
That's the spirit!
---
She's absolutely still top tier.   The addons are pretty good too.
---
ITT: All the nurse/killer mains complaining the game isn't easy enough for them
---
Or better ‚Äî remove all survivors sounds except injured.
---
So, now the headphones won‚Äôt give unfair advantage to Spirit players, and to get downed you will need to first get hit by 110% killer... It will give counter play
---
Tombstone head isn‚Äôt even that good unless considering how long it takes to charge. It kind of feels like bullshit to get instantly killed cause your team fed him stalk, but it‚Äôs not on the same level as prayer beads. Iri heads on the other hand, are annoying as hell.
---
Nope
---
I think it just tanks a hit. I'm guessing it'll be used at the part of the loop where you're going to take a hit. So at some point during that final loop pop it and don't lose a health state when hit.
---
The killer loses bloodlust and has to go through the attack cooldown. Loop starts again.
---
*soon, he will join the spirits*
---
Are the charms we saw in the original Ghostface leaks going to be the charms we get in the midchapter? I hope they‚Äôre just placeholders because getting a little potted plant cosmetic is kind of a lame reward.
---
Left behind has been massively buffed. I escape via hatch all the time now cause I have a key
---
Only a matter of time til killers cry about it though
---
BHVR should add a hook behind the killer in the load out screenb so we can see the charms.
---
While I don't think it's necessary, I'm afraid that if they're going to "change" Billy, his power will probably be put on a short cooldown as well, similar to Nurse's power after the changes.
---
That‚Äôs just not correct. The 2.5 sec already exists on the Nurse; that‚Äôs her current fatigue time and she can most certainly catch a survivor with the current time. Since her recharge starts AT THE BEGINNING of the fatigue and takes 3 seconds for one blink, it‚Äôs literally a half a second extra and good Nurses can close a chase with one more blink. Plus, the add-ons reduce the charge time.
---
It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt like the rework, but saying that it‚Äôs now impossible for Nurses to catch anyone just makes no sense.
---
Wait a minute... Isn't Jane the Killer cause she distracts the survivors with her thiccness?

What happened with Spine Chill?
---
That would completely fuck over everyone else and be extremely toxic.
---
&gt;he looked like he was scolding a dog who just peed on the rug or something
---
lmao yeah that looked exactly like that that was hilarious
---
He was getting camped in the basement. GF deserved that point
---
It takes up to 32 seconds without sloppy. Look at the alternatives.
---
Bond: Go up to teammate and let‚Äôem rub your butt
---
Inner Strength: Do a totem then hop in a locker for 8 seconds, rinse and repeat up to  f i v e  t i m e s
---
Medkit: Does the same thing but heals faster
---
Adrenaline: Rush last couple gens...profit
---
Ah yes, finally, the tier list ***I*** follow.
---
Should we tell painreliever?
---
Lol, effort? Right. Mori is way worse and requires 0 effort
---
Still not as bs as before, I‚Äôll take it
---
I disagree, and I'm a ghostface main. Spine chill is an off-meta perk, and it's just one perk. It's ridiculous that almost all killer mains moan and complain that every game is just dead hard and decisive strike when the other survivor perks aren't good. Very few players are going to be affected by nerfing spine chill but they're just going to take the same perks every survivors takes now, which is boring.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I usually have a headset on it‚Äôs just usually like a frame rate drop it mostly happens if I lunge right as I get bloodlust
---
This is a silly statement man.  Truetalent is a very solid killer and has a lot to teach developing killers.  Some people just like to hate on him to do it.  
---
I like them both for different reasons.  Otz is the stronger player and narrates every single decision he makes as he makes them.  He simply doesn't have that many vids and a lot of his tactics are for advanced players that already know the fundamentals of playing killer.
---
True on the other hand I like because he also goes out if his way to explain mindgames and counters and is better for teaching the fundamentals that can be emulated by newer killers as well as the staggering amount of content he generates daily.  He posts up to 10 vids daily to his channel.  Also for those wanting to learn how to play survivor as well as killer he is a much better survivor than Otz.  He can teach looping whereas Otz plays immersed and is really just strong in the killer role.  Both have a lot to teach players.
---
Why is empathy not better if not the same as bond
---
Did you see the total nerf to Nurse and her add-ons? http://imgur.com/a/vtBIUea
---
Stealth killers are getting Undetectable in the new patch. 
---
Nothing is happening to the perk directly, but now T1 Myers, Crouching Pig, Shrouded GF, and cloaked Bing Bong will no longer trigger it.
---
Wait are they all in order?  So Trapper is best top tier and Ghost is bottom top tier.  Got it.
---
I didn't know there were two types. Honestly with how much of a pain it is to get those hits it should just count both of 'em.
---
looks like the streamer was a bitch who dc even though they had a mori
---
The injured sounds are the problem, not the breathing.
---
&gt;I feel like it could be good the rework but i don‚Äôt like how some addons hinder the nurse but give her extra blood points and the dashing past a survivor just for blood points is eh and unlike billy or bubba its multiple items that hinder the nurse and reward extra Bloodpoints rather than just one other than that im looking forward to the rework
---
Eh the whole looking at the floor was intended to be part of her counter play where if you failed to hit them you were punished so they had a chance to break line of sight.
---
Or mori's...
---
Wasn't there a wallpaper full of the killers with teeth like this, does anyone know where it is?
---
It does not. It only blocks aura reading. Blocking Spine Chill and Premonition would be overkill since that is what those perks are designed to do- detect killers as they approach. They don't show you exactly where they are so there's a fair bit of guesswork involved.
---
Spine chill doesn't reveal auras though. And Undetectable does not stop line of sight?
---
It reveals killer location, its nowhere near as bad as nurse.
---
Well then there‚Äôs a bug that needs fixing.
---
The game is survivor sided against swf. Completely think that killer stuff like Moris and prayer beads needs balancing, but insta heals and bnps were equally unfun to play against.
---
If you think instaheals were fine, you're probably a surv opt and get clapped as soon as you make it out of brown ranks as killer.
---
Based
---
Never worked on t1 Myers
---
he's right but he shouldn't say it
---
I said after the end game collapse. The 75% speed, remember?
---
I believe legion belongs in the D- section
---
Thanks ill need it probably.
---
Damn, you got access to the good stuff in fairy land, don‚Äôt you?
---
Totems are much harder to find, the vault change did everything do you even play survivor? Loads of vaults because medium vaults at best because you could no longer do 45 degree angle vaults or touch the vault and fast vault.
---
Sounds like you need to get your head out of your ass and read the patch notes lmao.
---
I said after the end game collapse. The 75%, remember?
---
Hahahahah you stupid fuckin cunt, object of obsession is getting a nerf on 3.3.0 by making all stealth killers undetectable xD
---
The recharge starts at the beginning of the fatigue, so if your fatigue lasts 2-3 seconds by the time it ends you pretty much have a blink ready, so total you‚Äôre probably waiting 4 seconds total for 2 blinks. If you run addons it‚Äôll be even shorter. def agree she‚Äôs not broken or destroyed
---
Got to have a tea bag in
---
I think the list is implying she'd remember to feed you.
---
Not disagreeing with you, but I'm gonna have to call BS on 30 consecutive spirit games.

People play meme builds for fun. Not every game has to be adrenaline, balanced landing, iron will, and d strike.
---
Most meta surv perks are pretty much free. You don't have to do anything special to use Dead Hard, Lithe, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline.
---
It's almost like she doesn't instantly win the game anymore, or some weird shit like that.
---
Sad times üò™
---
You heard the genie, Maple boy
---
I mean moris are kinda bs sometimes but sometimes a killer ha just gotta put a cocky swf in there place when they see those those flashlights and toolboxes. Or when you see that TTV

Pls dont crucify me for asking, so she is still good? Im a learning console nurse so ive been more worried then most lol bc over there shes not as highly used
---
Empathy only works on injured survivors. Bond does everyone regardless of state. Plus the range on Bond is so good that if you don‚Äôt notice a survivor in your radius they‚Äôre probably being chased, thus removing the purpose of Empathy. It‚Äôs like Babysitter and BT, they‚Äôre both good, but once you unlock BT there‚Äôs really no point in turning back unless you wanna spice things up.
---
I‚Äôm a purple rank killer and a red rank survivor. 
---
Insta heals may not have been fine but there are plenty other things that should‚Äôve gone down with them like Moris and keys. But those got ignored. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt care much for insta heals going down but moris should also go down in that case
---
Oh look they gave GhostFace more stealth capabilities with adding undetectable to his arsenal while in night shroud, guess what all the asshole dickheads on PS4 are gonna do with that????

---
It's almost like you instantly win the game because you spent hundreds of hours learning to blink accurately *thunk*
---
"Scary Movie Ghost Face" 
---
Basically consists of 'working' on gens and being friendly like a Survivor Pig, usually bring some party streamers to help everyone get some extra blood points
---
Nope. What is the point of sounds then? Either you make omni direction survivors sounds have radius so small, that she will collide with them, or too big for her to even know how to land a hit...
---
Either way, you either make Spirit even more precise, or handicap her, turning into blind AND deaf killer. Then, the complaint will be that spirit‚Äôs power is super unreliable, and it is a guess. 
---
Ironically, this time the tables would turn and now spirits are the ones that flip the coin.
---
My idea to rework her is following ‚Äî- remove ALL sounds the survivors make until injured. Thereby, she either will have to play around scratch marks, leaving the outplay window to slow-vault/back step.... or she will have to land the first hit (remember, she is 110% ms killer), and then secure it with her power. 
---
So, she other takes her chances, but burns her power to get a first hit... AND has to chase you again.... Or chases you for the first hit as any other killer, and then secures the down. 
---
Also, the quality of your headset will not give you unfair advantage, which will be neat too. 
---
What do you say?
---
Empathy is better than bond imo. Being able to see your teammates in chase across the map is beyond helpful. And you can also see if they're leading the killer right towards you.
---
Yeah Nurse is literally the same. Most people didn't even use add-ons anyway because of muscle memory so this is a welcome change that might even get more people to try Nurse.
---
Tied between Diversion and Windows of Opportunity. I used to have both as "core" perks, but I've slowly branched away.
---
Diversion is just fantastic overall. Helps against Spirit, but also is sometimes the funniest perk to use when the Killer snaps their neck to look at the notification and *immediately* investigate. There's nothing I love more than keeping a killer occupied by throwing rocks around. It can be super clutch in the end game if I kept a charge, too!
---
I've also accidentally revealed my friends by unknowingly throwing pebbles in their direction.
---
Windows was like my "functionality" perk. Usually, I'm on the stealthier side, so I don't usually have firsthand knowledge about which pallets are already thrown. Windows really helped a lot in that regard.
---
Windows was also fantastic because it has a 20m aura reading range. What else is 20m? Diversion Tier 3. I can both throw the pebble purposely at a vault spot, making it more believable... or use it to kind of feel out how far 20m is. Windows also helped quickly identify where line of sight breaks are and could help in indoor maps as to which turn to take.
---
I mean... now you've said it...
---
she just won't be fun to play. it's so retarded to have to wait for your power when ur movement  speed is so slow that u can't even keep up with survivors.
---
Ah nice you get enough Auric Cells from completing the pass to buy the next one good.
---
Glad to see BHVR doing the good Battle Pass method
---
Oh yes we can earn more blood points as survivors now :3
---
I've been saying for awhile that cases are under-rewarded
---
This real?
---
They still should be looked at just like instant heals. My only prob with the pink instant is it still uses the medkit up it honestly should not do that as if it does the killer will know what‚Äôs up right away and you have no way of counter play
---
It doesn't matter. If you are a dedicated player then you are going to want everything it has to offer. That means the latest features and content that they are developing (for the player base who bought the game), not the free shit they dump on you to make them look generous and justify a terrible business model.
---
I'm sorry but if you can't see how bad it is, then I'm going to assume you are under 16. It was an awful thing for fortnite, and it has been a disgusting money grab for literally every company that has followed suit - Apex, Rocket league, etc...
---
It will generally make me question wanting to continue on DBD. 
---
i.e... So I end up buying the battlepass because I want to get the most out of one of my favourite games. Then what - I'm suddenly on a constant subscription to play it. If you decide not to, you get marginalised to the 'free content' and are made to look either like a new player or poor.
---
When they release new patches, do you call that free content? No because you have already bought the game. They already have a business model as well - that works. They have just realised that this is a way to make even more money, same as rocket league.
---
It truly is disgusting and I thought better of a small outfit such as BHVR. It may not be P2W but in my opinion, expression and customisation are key elements to having fun in a game. You put these behind a paywall and - Fuck you.
---
Yea Yamaoka's Estate is actually the size of Texas. I don't think they will address that though, giant maps are survivor favorites.  Hawkins showed the team is very capable of great map design so hopefully they just stop adding GTA sized maps and improve the rng odds for balanced maps
---
Then I guess it‚Äôs time to remove Mori‚Äôs as well. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But bond has a 20m range? Empathy has 128m
---
please bvhr God's I'd nut
---
*obligatory Thanos reality joke*
---
Just do the numbers and youll realize. I literally showed you an example where self-caring gave you 11% more gen progress
---
Yep! Found in the game files of the PTB
---
I'm not the best by any means but don't have a problem helping. You play on ps4?
---
WGLF need an additional function. Maybe a temporary speed boost for the person you unhook?
---
I guess it will need to be tested, but the consensus seems to be that Undetecable will affect Spine Chill now. 
---
Its a great change for stuff like Object of Obsession tho
---
Tombstone is fine in isolation tho. It literally makes you so fucking slow you will get looped forever and ever and you have to stare at people for nearly 30 seconds. When the average game lasts 5-10 minutes staring at people for 30 seconds takes a minimum of 5% of the whole game, and thats if you get people stupid enough to feed myers his tier 3.
---
The bullshit is when it gets comboed with play with your food for the 9% speed increase and he can still get bloodlust on top of that.
---
Literally just nerf tombstone to set his MAX movement speed to 105% and prevent bloodlust and its fine.
---
I will admit it feels shit to play against but it definately is not broken
---
You double posted.
---
That makes a lot of sense, those badges always looked awesome on the character data screen. Made you feel so good when you beat a gym leader
---
At level 3 you move at the same speed as walking. It only looks faster because you're closer to the ground.
---
Not quite. The emergency medkit used to have 24 charges (one heal). Now it has 16 (one heal) *and* heals you faster. It's actually a little better for healing yourself now.
---
I read it 5 times but couldn't understand the meaning, sorry
---
*Insert gordan ramsey meme
---
Finally, some fucking good tier lists
---
It feels unfair based in the ratio of players, like in my mind it would be a good balance of winning to losing slightly favoured by survivors considering there's 4 of them to 1 killer. It feels like with the amount of loss there is the game feels disappointing and frustrating more often than not
---
That was so big brain
---
Theres a post from Not_queen saying its only auras, I was incorrect
---
Oh, I didnt think about that. I do agree with you
---
*Well, that was idiotic...*
---
What are you playing on?
---
Real talk I think the DS and BT charges were ultimately good changes.
---
This is so important. People play the best rated charavters in a tier because they're usually easy to play and/or extremely powerful. You should be chposing who you enjoy playing as the most, and gitting gud with that character. That goes for DBD, DB FoghterZ, Tekken, Mortal Kombat, etc.
---
Gee It's like if the Wraith's "bing bongs" are a sort of drawback? Maybe a sort of way for survivors to have counter play?
---
But we can't have that now can we? /s
---
Ya it‚Äôs starts when the mid patch comes out
---
That would be hilarious for old players who came back and haven't kept up. Flee the pig working on the gen, and run into the real killer.
---
This isnt actually news?
---
It's a hefty chonk of an update.
---
Well no shit
---
They can stop making event cosmetics and battle pass cosmetics available in the store? There‚Äôs no point is wanting to play during the event or even progress the battle pass knowing I can just buy them later and they‚Äôre not exclusive.
---
thank god
---
A delay to unhook indication for the killer would also be nice.
---
I love how all the comments are from this video and yet they fit the situation described in this meme so perfectly
---
Change them sure, same as was done to instants.
---
You realise though it works similar to other Battle Passes? You pay 1000 Auric Cells for the Premium track, then you are able to earn enough Auric Cells from that track to buy the next Battle Pass without having to spend anything more. So realistically it‚Äôs a one time purchase and so long as you complete the pass the next one will be free.
---
Separate. Nothing on the PTB transfers back to the live game, it's purely for testing.
---
I definitely dont like the nurse rework, the fun of playing her is just flying around the map and landing blinks. If I have to wait 6 seconds for 2 blinks, the nurse can't do that anymore
---
the reworks means that nurse had a downgrade or that now requires a lot more skill to be good?
---
Locking shit behind a paywall is how you get kids to sink money relentlessly into things like this. Most of you aren‚Äôt getting the point here. People bitch nonstop about them fixing parts of this game, making improvements blah blah, and you‚Äôre gonna defend a pointless charm? Seems like a good focus of resources /s.
---
Wish people would understand it's not camping if you get downed going for an unhook. It's only camping if you actively wait around the hook.
---
Spine Chill and Premonition were stated to still work on stealth killers except Tier 1 Myers, but that's because T1 Myers has always been immune to detection. Only aura reading is blocked by Undetectable.
---
BHVR Peanits commented here about that.
---
yea i expected her to get that undetectable status so glad to see it come to fruition.
---
Awwwwww
---
Literally free cosmetics that do nothing but cool customization.  Why are you the way you are
---
So that makes legion the only official killer without a hallowed blight cosmetic, poor fellas.
---
I'll gladly give up keys if mori can only replace death hook
---
Piss off, it only happened every now and then.
---
Keys and moris are next. I also think some of y'all should actually look at the medkit changes, because medkits as a whole got buffed pretty substantially, and the purple and pink addons are still both very good.
---
Depending on the addons you can get gen grabs very easily on haddonfield as bingbong boy
---
BT is way stronger than ever before tho... with the deep wound changes
---
We need Scary Movie Ghost Face cosmetics now.
---
Is anyone out here getting Mettle of Man at all‚Äîlet alone more than once?
---
Huntress is a friend, she's always been a good friend of mine
---
They very much were.
---
Undetectable only works on Aura reading perks. Spine Chill is unaffected, theres a post from not_queen confirming.
---
I'm not sure what they have in mind for Moris, but a few changes I would want are...
---
* Cannot be used in the first 180 seconds of a trial.
---
* Ebony Mori has a cooldown of 120 seconds between Kills.
---
* Add *Obedient* status effect when a Mori is in play to show when a Kill cannot be performed. (Only visible to the Killer)
---
You can unlock auric cells, so you don't need to pay again iirc.
---
2.5 sec for 2 blinks ,now its 6 sec for 2 blinks ,you have more than double the time to escape nurse
---
and its 1 sec extra for a blink 
---
using only 1 blink gives you 2 sec fatigue ,using 2 blinks gives you 2.5 sec fatigue  ,now its 3 sec for 1 blink and 6 sec for 2 blinks
---
Lol, you can't even respond with anything other than an insult that not even a CHILD would use.
---
Good fucking god, dude, if you're going to respond with an insult at least make it a good one!
---
You're always going to play your best with what you enjoy.
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
---
I like the ‚Äú*Woke up in New York City*‚Äù while you grab the clock to *wake up* from Freddy‚Äôs dream lol
---
I suppose so, still nice to see.
---
Well we dont know his motivations or why he's so obsessed with Laurie (though some version explained it as being a curse) but dr. Loomis stated that Micheal can talk, he just chooses not to. I believe Micheal is a supernatural being in all Halloween versions (the amount of physical strength and knowledge he has is not normal for a person locked up since he was 6) and his mind does not function like a normal human being. He considers consequences, he knows how people act and react to things and he can outsmart people. Micheal Myers is a being that cannot be understood.
---
Nothing wrong with it but as killer I don‚Äôt like sympathy kills honestly cause if I did not get you legit then I don‚Äôt desert that pip or safety if it comes to that
---
The absolute madmen, they actually did it
---
Is this actually a Micheal skin?
---
Yes this tier list is 10000% correct
---
NO WAY
---
As long as you verse bad survivors.
---
Does anyone have details on how Undetectable and Borrowed Time work with each other?
---
Is BT still 100% based on terror radius? inViSiBlE CamPiNg
---
Just change name to Mori Me, someone will oblige.
---
all of those things were broken
---
and keys are horseshit too
---
&gt; Mori is way worse and requires 0 effort.
---
except hooking people.
---
NO EFFORT AT ALL
---
Dead By Daylight is horror-themed but by no means a horror game. Nothing is scary unless you're new to the game.
---
It's actually more toxic right now because a survivor opens the hatch and leaves, the killer can shut the hatch and force EGC, easily setting up a chance to catch the survivors who were left behind. 
---
If keys only allow the user to get out, the hatch would still be closed after and the killer couldn't force EGC. Also, it would prevent 3 survivors from getting out just because one person brought a key.
---
Yes that‚Äôs if you play for that. But there‚Äôs a purchase tiers option. I‚Äôve been through enough games with this crap to know a large percentage of people aren‚Äôt just gonna play to earn. There gonna dump money into unlocking everything which are irrelevant items that aren‚Äôt needed. Earning the charms through the challenges.. cool.. fine with that. But filling up the premium with a fuck ton of charms is not productive in any way.. that‚Äôs a cash grab at item hungry people.
---
Is this real?
---
Her base kit is definitely broken.  I will never understand how people act like it‚Äôs only addons that are the issue with her, apparently they‚Äôve never learned to play no addon nurse or never played against one.
---
They did in the original video
---
Is this a skin or?
---
its 10 dollars, for a month and a half pass, that seems pretty easy to climb, and pays for the next month out of itself? Its also purely cosmetic. Cosmetic paywalls, and normal paywalls are two VEEEEERY different things.
---
How are they not options? A yellow medkit with two charge add-ons can get you at least 2.5 heals which is more than enough especially if you‚Äôre running Adrenaline (everyone does let‚Äôs be real). Inner Strength can get you at least 2 or 3 unless some other teammates have it too. Bond always works unless you‚Äôre last alive in which case you should be searching for hatch not healing. Adrenaline is the only one that‚Äôs situational since you need the gens to be done but it‚Äôs so incredibly powerful that it makes up for it‚Äôs shortcomings.
---
they've done a number of healing buffs that survivor mains ignore with all their hearts
---
ok great! Thank you!
---
Yup.
---
Real.
---
Whoever is talking in the video literally says they have ‚ÄúD‚Äù.
---
Also the head on was just a tad too early IMHO.
---
OK, but TBH Totems in the hospital are really hard to find!
---
Except Nancy wiggled out so you basically just traded and only got 1 hook.
---
Where can you read about this? I just read through all the lore on their website and it didn't mention this.
---
I only serve bento, unless I have a grudge against you. No poison, but you'll get a lot of sass if you complain about my skills. Everyone knows Japanese University students are amazing cooks.
---
Holy shit! The original ghostface costume!!! Yessss!!
---
Not to mention: who the fucks uses OoO? I used it for a while, but eventually, like, nah
---
Literally not all free. That‚Äôs the point.
---
Because mori animations are one of the better means of marketing a horror game and help to make each killer unique. Look at how much buzz was generated when people hit their first look at Demo‚Äôs mori. 
---
The game is a product, and mori‚Äôs are a business decision. Not everything devs do is made out of some sort of spite against one part of their player base, you know.
---
I'm sorry but have you ever had an entire swf insta heal the guy u slugged for half a second and defend them with ur life while also opening the door at the same time
---
s o m e t i m e s  
---
consistency is *key* here when it comes to good perks
---
It still happens sometimes even if I don‚Äôt lunge right when it happens I think it‚Äôs the way your screen does the motion blur that causes the problem I‚Äôve tried to find a way to turn it off but couldn‚Äôt
---
What else would it be?
---
Are the outfits from the battle pass exclusive?
---
Please don't be in battle pass, please don't be in battle pass...
---
Naw mate, imagine a Gargantuar roaming around the map. That would be fucked.
---
HOLY SHIT IS THAT CLASSIC GHOSTFACE!!!!
---
LAURIE!!!!!!!!!! MYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ORIGINAL GHOSTFACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! did u see tapp's new outfit too? holy shit im so excited (btw bro, tag spoilers)
---
So? There wasn‚Äôt a hook close enough from what I can see. I‚Äôd take that.
---
Oh my god these are great.
---
HOLY SHIT THEY DONE IT!!!
---
God damnit my wallet is pissed but I don‚Äôt care I need that micheal skin
---
Ah. Gifs that end too soon, then.
---
HD is best qu7eality
---
Most killers do not have insta down add ons and I don‚Äôt foresee the ones that currently exist lasting much longer. 
---
Thankfully it won‚Äôt be an issue for me again because Behaviour seems to agree that instas were busted. :)
---
ikr
---
I intentionally ran across the whole map just to get that clip for that part, so thank you for noticing üòÅ
---
I'm not particularly enthusiastic about the reward differences between the free and premium paths of the Rift.
---
Bat backpack Steve! Hell yeah!
---
Dammit, now I need to buy another pig skin.
---
I love the memeing going on lol 
---
Nice detail on how its a spirit talking about their girl (nurse) haha
---
Wraith just wanted a normal job crushing cars, now he crushes people
---
Actually, it would be better if it was in the pass,since the pass costs 1000 cells, and all these skins are probably gonna cost way over that so y'knowww.
---
My money...
---
Nevermind, the hospital gown is him
---
lol no i didn't. i got like 150k bp. :)
---
GAMERS RISE UP
---
oh my god, myers cosmetic!
---
oh my god babysitter steve!
---
OH MY GOD CLASSIC GHOSTFACE WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Good ridence those insta helas took them long enough, fun fact it isnt fun to watch someone erase ur progress on a survivor's health state in front of you
---
Fatigue and charge are different though. Her fatigue is staying at 2.5 seconds, but now the charge thing (3 seconds) exists and happens at the same time as the fatigue.
---
Tunneling and camping are for cowards! Jk but really, I try really hard not to. It's unfair and hurts the killer in the long run.
---
I would like to see none and have the battlepass removed.
---
You shouldn't be forced to pay for exclusives.
---
Earning exclusives is fine, paying for non exclusives is fine, it's when you combine them that it becomes a problem.
---
Wait the one on the far left is Myers? I don't recognize that outfit from anywhere. Was it from Halloween 2 in the hospital?
---
FunWorld owns classic ghostface. This doesn't mean they got the scream license.
---
IS THIS REAL
---
I'd rather buy the skin than buy the ability to earn the skin. Plus i don't want the time pressure of when I can get it, y'knowwww?
---
No way they'll have these in the battle pass lol
---
Good to hear!
---
Console runs 60fps..
---
You have to mend yourself after it? Not worth losing a whole medkit over.
---
I know, I‚Äôm just curious to see what they look like.
---
No devs are bad and I have a better understanding, we can‚Äôt have you fix one but not the other at the exact same time despite me having no indication of the balancing process internally /s
---
You never know, the Nurse Hallowed Blight one is.
---
Yeah, how dare the survivors not want to get an instant loss because there is no counterplay to a blatantly broken killer
---
Actually I don't think it's that bad.
---
At least try to act serious if you want literally anybody to care about and take you seriously.
---
EGC isn‚Äôt a problem because that gets triggered regardless. It actually saves you from doing gens which is only beneficial to the team, not toxic at all.
---
If it‚Äôs changed to one person, it will only benefit one person every time. And you would still have to do gens at an extreme disadvantage as you would have to lose 1-2 survivors already for hatch to spawn.
---
Some events like the 3 year anniversary and chinese new year give firecrackers in the blood web. They can be thrown down at anytime and they blind like a flashlight. 
---
The only difference is the firecracker effects a radius that is fairly small, so you have to bait the killer into hitting you at the hook in order to get him stuck in that radius.
---
Trying to throw it anywhere else would require super precise timing and is far more impressive than anything I can do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs soon and not a long ptb
---
Why do i ear „Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥„Ç¥?
---
I kinda feel like exhaustion addons for clown doc and maybe huntress should be higher rarity than yellow/green, for how much they fuck the survivors. ‚ÄòCourse I‚Äôm a survivor main so I am biased.
---
&gt; than buy the ability to earn the skin.
---
As well as a number of other skins
---
whining about battle pass is so stupid
---
I always hear complaints about the quieter bonus as a killer main I can tell you first hand it isn't all sunshine and rainbows since you  are probably still going to depip since you loose out on so much potential score events like chases, hooks, and sacrifices also on top of that you are probably going to steam roll the other 3 survivors left in the match meaning you probably won't even get the full 3 hooks off on all of them.
---
During farming season "hmm, they also happened to drop me off at a generator near where my friends were. Nah, better run away!"
---
My psn name is the same as my user name on here.
---
you should want your hooks to look cute because it's fun
---
stop being boring
---
These are licensed cosmetics though so they'll want money for them
---
&gt;Big maps make all killers suffer
---
Billy could give less than 2 fucks about big maps. Dude can literally keep strong gate pressure on the biggest map if the gates are on opposite ends. Other killers? Sure. Not billy.
---
You had me at cinematics
---
yes far left. just the clothes he had while in the asylum
---
I‚Äôm fine with paying for cosmetics. I own 3 copy‚Äôs of this game. Never had an issue supporting a company I like. But when they add un needed filler with an option to buy tiers just to get to good items that‚Äôs stingy. This is the exact thing almost every other game has done that killed a large portion of their base in the last few years. Unneeded items instead of anything of value in the paid section. Like music fuck anything. Things of worth. You already get charms from challenges, why put it in the premium.
---
There already is, and has been for a few months now. 
---
What you should ask for is a more harsh system, because the current one is a joke (You have to quit 35% of your matches in a month, with X matches played, to be eligible for a DC-based ban.)
---
they turned off dedicated servers for PC, it's back to killer being host.
---
wait bill is getting a cosmetic
---
So many
---
Posting the notes here for the firewalled people broke Reddit's character limit. ***Twice.***
---
Perhaps it's a good thing I can't get to the Archives post, haha.
---
Oh that's even better! I've always wanted to know more about the story. I'm excited.
---
What if...what if I smoke my greens...
---
Lol, you cant even respond with anything other than an insult that not even a child would use. Good fucking god, dude, if youre going to respond an insult at least make it a good SHUT UP!
---
Maybe. There are cosmetic pieces for characters in the store that are part of a collection, and not a outfit so maybe they are completing the outfits?
---
.... Yes.. we do know what the charms are -_-
---
Yes annoying but 4 man with purple flashlights is worse.
---
GHOSTFACE MAIN POPULATION RISES BY 1000%
---
Kindred not going to work with crouching Pig when she's camping, I guess?
---
I see spirit needs rework, but i actually don't think the Nurses that bad.
---
Nope cause fun world owns the costume as well plus i don‚Äôt really want them to add scream
---
I'm just sick and tired of 90% of the Survivors population being fucked over because A, most killers suck and B, 10% of Survivors are unkillable
---
What do you mean about his ability to quickly turn corners? I'm just started to play him recently and I'm trying to learn how best to chase people.
---
Fun fact it isn't fun to get morid after you got camped (but no one is doing something about moris)
---
Id say you should just escape. If a lot of people do what you're doing it could skew the data that the devs see and don't give these killers the buffs they need.
---
So, so many times. I'll even walk right up to a hook solely so I can do a "No" head-shake in front of it hoping it'll communicate what I'm doing if they're wiggling. They've gotten the message a few times but most keep wiggling.
---
You can get easy protection points on getting hit when their carrying a survivor
---
The issue I have is you don‚Äôt need to play.. you can pay for everything. Just like every other FPS has done in the last few years.
---
Holy moly that is brutal
---
Well, the pass has been made so that you can get every reward even if you only play an hour a day, so there isn't exactly going to be too much pressure. Plus, they'll be on the store after their duration on the rift. So, like, there is nothing to worry about, there is no time pressure at all.
---
No, I mean how they actually look.
---
Would be a cool idea
---
Nah throwing a temper tantrum is much easier.
---
i mean if you saw my in-game username yeah it'd be expected jojo's all the way.   
---
my username on everything but reddit is Star Quacknum.
---
We skipping shirtless Myers and going straight to feet pics.
---
Tombstone isn't toxic. It guarantees that the killer deranks. And it can be countered by lockers. And it can be avoided if you complete the gens fast because it takes so damn long to charge up. And it gets countered by forcing the killer to lunge or they'll down you and can't mori you. 
---
If you whine about Tombstone, you're a dumbass who can't play right. With both pink addons, Myers has to *completely drain* 3 different survivors to get to Tier 3. And he starts out slower than Nurse. So if you let him drain all Evil Within out of you, then you deserve to get mori'd.
---
Tombstone piece only gives enough Tier 3 to mori 1 person then sends you back to tier 2. You have to drain a survivor completely then mori them, then do that again 3 times to have enough to mori everyone. And if even 1 person loops him for the 60 second Tier 3 duration, he automatically fails to get a 4 man mori. So again, if you let him completely drain you and then let him catch you in Tier 3, you fucked up *twice* so you deserve to get mori'd. 
---
NOED is just a joke. If you cry about that, you suck. Period. They reward 1000 points to cleanse a dull totem. 4 dull totem cleanses would be half of the total boldness category. Not to mention they're buffing Detective's Hunch to reveal stuff even if you don't complete the gen yourself. Also, Inner Strength gives incentive to cleanse. So if you're still whining about NOED, just stop. Honestly just stop.
---
I'd say it seems fair however there's still things like Keys for Survivors that literally make them win the game quicker just like Mori's currently. The big difference is that if you have 4 gens done and the Killer has killed one survivor, all other survivors can escape through the hatch if someone opens it, and that is objectively worse.
---
So while yes I really like it, it's only really applicable if Keys are either removed or changed so that only one survivor can escape per key, or something to that effect. This is more feedback than ripping your head off (sorry to disappoint), but that's currently how I feel with it in the current "balance" of the game. 
---
If keys were one person only or something like a max of 1 can escape with a Key per game then yeah it'd be fine but otherwise, right know, it wouldn't be good in my opinion.
---
Found it. If anyone else is looking for the link it‚Äôs [here.](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/welcome-to-the-archives?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
The cosmetics in rift aren't in store. You have to go through a paid for rift for said cosmetics.
---
Not really, it makes their moves way more predictable and allows for much easier map pressure.
---
I know it shouldn‚Äòt man, just with personal experience it has, I hope it gets fixed
---
I find it fun to have to go for challenges and it gives me incentive to play the game besides just grinding Bloodpoints, even if they are unneeded filler it‚Äôs fun to mess around with all the cosmetics I earn.  Once again it‚Äôs entirely optional and they will still constantly release new cosmetics outside of the pass
---
I dunno I think doing everything at once would have a greater chance of fucking something up. Like if they do nurse first, see where she is after the changes. Oh they're too much or not enough let's tweak it...ok I think she's good now, let's move onto spirit...then billy...ok these killers have been brought down but are still good, now let's make the core game changes.
---
If they do everything at once it's just a lot to balance at once so I think doing it in small bits makes more sense imo
---
Spirit
---
Oh the irony
---
Shouldn't be too long right? Since it needs to be released for the Withering Blight event, and that's gotta start a solid amount of time before actual Halloween
---
Probably Pig because her addons mostly suck anyway
---
Because they didn‚Äôt need to add the pass! They have a challenge system to earn bs like charms. The new cosmetics can be paid like they always were. Putting stuff behind a premium pass and filling that pass with other nonsense so you need to go through that many tiers is a cash grab.
---
haha that Jake one beard boye
---
I might be wrong but I think I heard that there will be ones like in the store with some differences to make them unique still.
---
Michael????????? Michael??
---
&gt; countered using stealth
---
Good thing this game has no aura perks or detection perks.
---
it‚Äôs not a ‚Äúmind game‚Äù lol it‚Äôs a totally unpredictable 30% chance guess.
---
she can either be vaulting, phasing, or neither, instead waiting to psyche you out, and there‚Äôs absolutely 0 way to tell what she‚Äôs doing.
---
I would not call that a mindgame at all, a mindgame implies they‚Äôre trying to actually outsmart you in some way but this is just guessing
---
Re-commenting because I misread your post. I think we disagree with it for different reasons, but regardless at least we agree it's no bueno.
---
Nobody:
---
BHVR: Let's give them shirtless legion this time.
---
I still recon she‚Äôll compete with billy for number 2 spot.
---
I've tried that but honestly it feels like it doesn't register most of the time. I'll go all the way to the dying state for somebody and only leave with 1 stack if I'm lucky.
---
i mean when i transferred from xbox to pc my purchases weren't transferred over or progression.
---
Nurse without add-on doesn't look much different. By the time you are out of fatigue, you got your 2 blinks back. This can even change with add-ons to get them back even faster.
---
Oh my fucking god classic ghostface!!!
---
I took a closer look at the archives. This is actually fucking awesome and I would pay.
---
This is happening to me every game. I can‚Äôt even use m1 to do a generator.
---
I didn't know, calm down lol
---
How do you play Ghostface on an open map like Autohaven or Coldwind?
---
Then I don‚Äôt see the need to nerf insta heals, hell, even bring back old BNP, if one of the most broken aspects of the game is a marketing point.
---
They still at least get something for it. Where as I lose everything. Thats my point.
---
The perk is making it easier to level up and youre going to want Dead Hard regardless, I dont see the issue
---
#uwu
---
Theres times I just go around spamming shock and not worrying about hooking people. Sometimes its just fun to troll.
---
&gt; Because they didn‚Äôt need to add the pass!
---
But how is it actually bad? You don't really have any reason. For people who really care about cosmetics, this would lower the potential overall cost
---
and again, you'll still get shit for free because of the free pass
---
i don't know in what world giving out cosmetics in a free pass is a cash grab, but aight
---
I was just going to say the exact same thing. Holy FUCK is that sound effect loud when you go to the bloodweb. I don't think anything in the game is anywhere near being as loud as this. I always mute my sound when I go to use my points because of how aggressive the damn thing is.
---
An attempt on my life has left me scarred and Disconnected
---
My wallet is going to be empty...also Nurse has a hallowed blight skin not in the banner? Part of the archives?
---
They look like the same keychain bs they did with COD. They didn‚Äôt need to fill the premium tiers with that stuff when they have a free tier system empty atm and the ability to earn them through challenges anyways. Filling a premium with random items is just a way to get people to buy up tiers in order to get the cosmetics they won‚Äôt add in the store that you should have been able to buy outright.
---
Ok cool, that's you. I made the comment even for the others 2k posts about it and about spirit too
---
Was meant for others too not specifically for you üòä don't take it as an attack towards you
---
Not only. It also coordinates the team movement. Meaning there are always people on decoding, people who rescue etc. in the right hands, this type of coordination leaves little to no time for the killer, not to mention making all aura-revealing perks useless, and trashing upon all stealth killers.
---
The dedicated servers are insanely laggy on PTB, I would love to try the nurse but you get teleported backwards every time you go into fatigue, chain blink window is sometimes shorter than it should be. Not 100% sure if it's pure lag or if the teleporting thing is just a nurse bug, but I tried 2 games and it happens literally every blink.
---
I don‚Äôt like how we got Hospital Myers before H2018 Myers. I know it‚Äôs licensing stuff- it‚Äôll have been easier to get stuff from the first movie, but still.
---
I really think y'all should stop posting these without actually getting used to the changes.
---
"Enters Tier 3"
---
A massive erection shows under the gown, lifting it
---
In the archives notes they said that recolors of existing skins will be among the challenge rewards so at least you won't have to pay for it.
---
And I can't wait to spend all this money on characters I've never played! (That's not sarcasm, I have 0 hours on kate and still instabought her biker skin)
---
When the killer is Undetectabke, you cannot perceive their terror radius, meaning BT will not work. Just like with freddy vs sleeping survivors, if a killer is undetectable you cannot use BT if they are nearby.
---
Thats a pretty good guess, heres hoping!
---
&gt; PTB Kate
---
How?!
---
OP is such a fucking infant
---
Even better
---
No, they specifically said it was an ad on rework
---
That was very entertaining
---
I was hypedfor classic GhostFace until I realised we're going to have to cough up cells for the same mask as the default but with less dirt.
---
I think this guy has to be a troll at this point, there is no way someone can be this dense unless he‚Äôs a kid or something
---
"The Nurse was also ~~balanced~~ **murdered** in this update, so it's not exactly one sided."
---
Y'all took a high skill cap killer that rewarded massive levels of practice with an extremely high skill ceiling, and instead of just dealing with the two issues (+blink addons and range addons), y'all knee-jerked and... well, it's just disgusting.
---
Not only do balance changes take so, so long to even be implemented from a lethargic team, they completely miss the mark on what the issues with individual killers are.
---
I'm genuinely curious how old you are
---
Anyone elses save file super outdated on the ptb?    It is using a save from like 2 weeks ago when I had my nancy at level 13.   on main game she is now 50 with all perks
---
Kinda wanted to use nanc
---
I mean if there is a killer that should have meme add-ons it should be someone like Nurse.
---
3 sec per blink ,and considering the fact she has the same speed as a survivor ,survivors gonna have a really easy time escaping her considering that all it takes is breaking line of sight with her
---
dedicated servers arent currently on. This is caused by your killer's internet.
---
Wonder if ebony mori's may be changed next update?
---
Then I guess I have more mediocre perks to look forward to instead of something actually exciting ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Their cosmetic game has definitely improved lately, these are dope.
---
Am I the only one who finds GhostFace low tier?
---
I play on console so I don‚Äôt run into many nurse players but I don‚Äôt see the big deal to be honest. It sounds like they‚Äôre making her more balanced instead of OP
---
That Demogorgon just looking at you like "sup" then leaving Lmao
---
and there's also a free pass as well.
---
OP is mad that some people may decide to spend money as he gets free shit
---
what a child
---
Nice down but what happened after she wiggled out??
---
At the very start of his chainsaw sprint he has the ability to turn very sharply. This can be used to take corners at certain loops and hit survivors.
---
It'll be so much easier to butt fuck survivors without pants in the way
---
Nah he's just one of the resident complainers.
---
then don't buy it and use the free pass and let people who think they're neat use the premium and don't screech at them like an unhinged banshee
---
* Screenshots highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
&gt;I own 3 copy's of this game
---
Opinion disregarded
---
Should have mentioned killer had 80-120 ping and I‚Äôm consoleüòì
---
Step 1: buy the game
---
Step 2: have to buy characters
---
Step 3: have a shop with skins
---
Step 4: pay for the opportunity to grind skins.
---
Nice. At least usually games trying to milk you this much are usually free to play.
---
Freddy
---
Billy. Just M2 everybody and win. Plus as a survivor main whenever I play Billy I have no add-ons anyways lol
---
I blinked and hit her again. cx
---
Turn off auto adjust. That may help. I did and it seemed to help me
---
After saying "off meta" to describe iron will while you run bond just made this entire wall of text not worth of reading.. especially when you're defending him without being in his head, are you?
---
Iron will is way more meta than bond, come on now
---
&gt; Forcing you to play if you want an exclusive item though? Fuck off.
---
are you 12
---
What battlepass
---
I figured but had to ask lol I wanted to keep watching that. Again nice down though
---
But the green kit had 25% decreased charge consumption,adding up to 30 charges. That allowed you to heal yourself twice if you hit 2 great skillchecks
---
Everything that‚Äôs in the pass could be put in the challenges. Any of the good cosmetics are behind a load of pointless charms you should already be earning elsewhere. And they added the option to pay through the whole thing by buying tiers, the tiers which are filled with the same items you‚Äôre already earning through challenges. That‚Äôs how!
---
It's actually really strong. It looks like they scream if you precise blnk near them too.
---
The stuff is just cosmetics so i don't really care too much BUT the game currently, with all DLC costs +100 bucks and it keeps on getting F2P monetization... A bit greedy IMO.
---
Yes, it is a joke. A meme perk to be more specific. Same reason why people play no blink Nurse or Burger King Myers.
---
No spine chill still works. It blocks other aura reading perks, the only thing that spine chill doesn't detect is T1 myers.
---
you do not get a stack if you are hurt btw
---
Hmmm I have no sense of humor and want attention, I got an idea! ‚ÄúNobody, absolutely nobody:‚Äù hahaha now I‚Äôm funny please give me validation!
---
Don‚Äôt worry. They‚Äôll nerf spirit next.
---
Is that Day of the Dead Julie?!
---
It was better to just use the first blink for mobility and you pretty much regain that in fatigue, I don't see your problem.
---
A battlepass LMAO clap clap
---
My opinion doesn‚Äôt count because I have this game on 3 different platforms?! Lol. K then.
---
....the nerf literally is not that bad, it will most definitely still be an issue for killers who found the original insta heal to be an issue. If you couldn‚Äôt even process the survivor was up &amp; had already bailed by the time you got back then I highly doubt you‚Äôll do any better against the new ones. People are just going to adapt and figure out how best to use these new 8second heals + the purple one now has BT built in, I‚Äôm honestly astonished they did that and can‚Äôt wait for all the complaints. 
---
‚ÄòMost killers‚Äô can be considered an understatement but my point is Trapper, Clown &amp; Huntress all have instant down add-ons &amp; the killers (some to clarify for you) that don‚Äôt have it in add ons have it built in as a power + the multiple perks for Exposed + ridiculously unfair things like infinite tier 3 Meyers still exist in this game. All things will change though, in due time.
---
Aah excellent now I can classify the neighborhood I live in.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call this a rework at all. It‚Äôs. Straight up burial.
---
really? i think playing and doing the challenges is more fun than just buying them.
---
Freddy.
---
Did the devs intentionally f\*cked up Jake's default bearded face to sell this bearded face?
---
I don‚Äôt run bond, I didn‚Äôt say I did, I said it‚Äôs strong and I don‚Äôt know where my teammates are. Iron Will is more meta because it is one of the only counters to a single killer, does it work on all of them? Yup. So does head on, doesn‚Äôt make it a ‚Äúgood‚Äù perk. Spirit is not balanced
---
Yes we‚Äôre getting season 2 steve
---
Old enough to know only kids and teens enjoy this kinda nonsense.
---
You're way too mad about this lmfao
---
they have to make money somehow and, again, because you ignore this *so hard*: **there is a free pass**
---
the base game is really cheap (except on Switch) and it gets given out for free more often than any game I have ever seen and essentially all of the main content can be acquired for free
---
This is news to me. Thanks for the info!
---
Here's hoping the back isn't closed all the way
---
I would if I could get into a game!
---
Lmao true
---
they are timed exclusives they will go for sale within 6 months. plus if you beat the pass you get next one for free
---
You are 100 percent in high school.
---
Is it a known issues that Medic on PS4 only pops if you do 100 heals in a single match? It‚Äôs the last trophy I need for the platinum and it‚Äôs never popped for me,
---
Are the devs going to implement some kind of leaver penalty at some point? Genuinely would like to know.
---
Spine chill still works, dev has stated so twice ITT
---
You can't m2 everyone with fucking billy. You do realize loops exist right? Curving isn't even viable without add ons. So basically if you  face good survivors you're a m1 killer.
---
If you get to the final tier you earn back 1000 auric cells. So roughly 1hr a day and you‚Äôll get your money back for the premium pass. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too bad actually.
---
I like how he has a metal pipe and screwdriver as weapon skins. Did he actually use those in the movies? I think he did actually use a screwdriver at one point in Halloween 2 but I might be thinking of another movie.
---
I have used Pharmacy some time ago and I can say that if you can hit 2 or 3 great skill checks, you can get a 2nd heal out of it
---
the pass is better than I thought it was going to be 10 bucks and if you beat it you get the cells back. I do find it weird that a paid game like this does have it but like I said its not bad and you end up earning 20000 worth of cell skins
---
You're bitching about a one-time $10 purchase that will introduce more cosmetics in one season than we've received over the course of 2 chapters, yet you've happily spent at least 4x that on 3 copies of the game.
---
Were you born stupid or was it an acquired thing?
---
How could you say something so brave yet so controversial?
---
I'm shocked that you ever thought that was a remote possibility.
---
"MoM is too hard to proc"
---
"Well here. Now it can proc multiple times per game."
---
"No but the problem was..."
---
"Now take it and be happy while we think up the newest pig nerf"
---
Were you playing against a legion yesterday? I swear I was in a game with that name
---
Also, make more of these. This was great
---
They will cost more ye dumb dumb
---
As a solo survivor, it's not up to me whether or not he gets to pull off a tombstone. Because there 3 other teammates who are highly likely to feed him.
---
Same for piece, someone else can feed him, and then he leaves them and catches me off guard and has the chance to mori me even if I didn't make a mistake.
---
NOED is still not fun to go against. Neither was Mettle of Man before its nerf. It rewards you for letting the other person do their objective. If they could at least just remove NOED's Speed buff, it wouldn't be as bad. And no, Inner Strength gives me no more incentive to cleanse dull totems as before. The perk is mediocre from my experience. I still cleanse dull totems, but I'm solo. I've played games where I went and cleansed 5 dull totems by myself, with Small Game and that's a whole one less survivor on gens for a perk they *might* have.
---
And just because they're not broken, doesn't make them fun to go against. Even if you're not on the receiving end of the tombstone piece, it's now a 3v1 game, faster than if he had to actually hook the person, and it'll probably be 2v1 shortly after. I've had games lost only because we lost one survivor early.
---
If the hatch spawns, it means most, if not all of the gens are done. Either that, or most, if not all survivors are dead. Either way, you aren't hurt too bad by a teammate escaping via hatch.
---
And depending on the distance between gates, survivors can automatically lose via EGC.
---
But as keys are in their current state, they can swing an expected 4K into a 2K because of the hatch spawning. This is insanely stupid. Aside from Instaheals and moris, very few things have such a large impact on the other side with very little control. And instaheals are being changed to lessen this ridiculous impact.
---
Lmfao! You‚Äôd 100% be a dumbass.
---
It‚Äôs not even a month, it‚Äôs for 70 days. So you pay 1000 cells for 70 days and if you can complete the rift, like you said, you get the payment for the next rift pass. That‚Äôs how I understand it. Unless something changes of course.
---
DBD is one of the least monetized games out there. Most DLC you can get by playing the game and BHVR isn‚Äôt a AAA studio so they need to sell cosmetics and licensed characters to make money and update the game. A $10 premium battle pass is, again, only cosmetics so you don‚Äôt have to buy it if you‚Äôre gonna complain about the game being ‚Äúmoney hungry‚Äù
---
Nurse and Spirit ovbiously. If the tournament doesn't specify any limit to the amount of times you can play a killer, its pretty much a nurse only tourney. Only way you can get more than 1 kill anyway as well..
---
Spine chill still works. Only thing spine chill doesn't detect is T1 myers
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if they will cost more? It‚Äôs still the fact that you can buy them at all, you disrespectful dumb dumb.
---
I read that in another thread as well. Seems silly that both wouldn't count.
---
He's upset because mommy said he can't use her credit card anymore
---
"Our goal is that¬†everybody has access to the amazing content the team has created" yeah a battle pass...
---
Yup.. just totally not a player at all.
---
The base game on all platforms except the Switch is really cheap and is given away for free pretty frequently
---
almost all of the important, primary content can be acquired for free
---
they have regular events where you easily earn cosmetic rewards
---
a good number of cosmetics can be grinded out
---
stop crying
---
also there is a free pass to placate children like you
---
Shut the fuck up
---
Also deal lol make em have no effect in game, strictly animation for death hook
---
More for free!
---
its in the free version of the battle pass
---
It‚Äôs not JUST a 10$ purchase smh. THATS what I‚Äôm complaining about Jesus Christ.
---
slight error on my part, its actually 3 months.

&gt; All 1,000 Auric Cells can be earned back (plus other rewards) as players progress through The Rift.  
---
And there it is, the one feature I loved on the Fortnite Battle Pass I really hoped they‚Äôd bring to DBD. I love that I can buy it once, then re-earn it for free!
---
it is in the free version
---
&gt; You could do bones
---
Thanks for all the responses, u/Peanits, and props to the team for the constant updates.
---
Here's my silly feedback: Why not reduce MoM to two protection hits instead of three? Two is a slog. Three is impossible.
---
The archives honestly sounds so exciting to me, an extra progression system. I love the idea behind it and I‚Äôll definitely be buying up that Premium Pass the first time it rolls around.
---
You act as if battle passes in every game that has one aren't riddled with useless shit too.
---
I think charms are cute and I'm down for any additions to survivor and killer customization
---
Also, if people want to purchase tiers instead of earning them by playing, that's their own prerogative and really doesn't affect you in any way whatsoever.
---
If that‚Äôs the case, then they can change it
---
wow you sure got me
---
Yeah, I didn't mean to get so defensive. I just feel SWF counters most stuff but it's at least a fun thought.
---
Laurie, Nancy, Ghostface, Jane, Amanda, Michael MY WALLET
---
What's the problem with letting people buy them afterwards?
---
If they don't pay for and then Unlock them with the battle pass, they'll end up being more expensive anyway. There could also be situations where players pay for the battle pass but for some reason, don't have the time to unlock everything they wanted, so they'll have to pay again anyway.
---
Who cares who has what cosmetics anyway? They don't affect gameplay, they are just a fun way for the devs to make extra cash
---
I think it was actually they added 5 AD to buff her after all the nerfs.  
---
I can't remember exactly, I know it was 5 ad, one way or the other. Then after that 5 AD became a meme
---
80% of these dodges are pure luck üòÖ
---
Salty lips only gives 3% extra luck and luck doesn't affect chests.
---
it literally does not affect you 
---
enjoy your **free pass**
---
Okay you ü§°
---
Why do you care about being unique?
---
What if I really like a cosmetic but I didn‚Äôt have the battlepass?
---
And anyways you have a few months of exclusiveness so that should ‚Äúfix‚Äù it.
---
The point here is to get good cosmetics at low price and later at high price.
---
well, they gotta pay employees, maintain servers, and keep creating content somehow. And it's not p2w either.
---
Sure, as long as we bring back mori‚Äôs that don‚Äôt require a killer hook you first. We can make false-equivalencies all day.
---
Both moris and keys just make games go too quick
---
Disagree with Object and Bond. Bond I would put in A Tier. But Object just got an indirect nerf because of pig, ghostface, and wraith getting undetectable in their stealth.
---
ya agreed
---
Bubbas weakness is the lack of good addons. Sure, he has a few good ones like charge time and speed, but most of them are useless.
---
Luck has nothing to do with chests, only hook yeets, and lips doesnt apply a very massive increase.
---
This happens so fucking much
---
Even if you use every Ace perk + slippery meat and full Luck offerings, you still have a high chance of failure of unhooking yourself
---
it's not that bad
---
Possibly, I dont recall matches as I play so many of them, but I try my best to make matches fun while also trying to stay alive. Thank you for the feedback though :)))
---
It‚Äôs scummy, that‚Äôs my point. And I‚Äôm not acting like other passes don‚Äôt do this shit.. I‚Äôm exactly complaining that the passes ARE like this bs.. and people have been complaint about this bs for years on years now. DBD is just the next in line to be tainted by child marketing.
---
What if I want be a survivor?
---
You can still move while the second blink is charging and the first blink will charge up during the existing stun. You don't lose any ground from this (nurse is basically survivor speed) you just can't make any up whilst charging
---
This sounds like a 13 year old yelling "I WANT FREE SHIT RIGHT NOW MAMA I WANT IT FREE NO EFFORT GIMME GIMME I WANT IT NOW" 
---
If you don't want to earn the shit they made then don't earn it.
---
If you don't want to pay for the shit they made then don't pay.
---
Is r/gamingcirclejerk leaking or something?
---
I was using it + better together + prove thyself, now I can get rid of both and use Detective + sprint burst + fixated + iron will, FINALLY!!! Also 10 secs instead of 5 is fucking amazin, I'm so happy right now
---
Too bad she is getting nerfed so barely anyone on console will get it
---
Oh, totally. No doubt about that.
---
This post is so cringe. 
---
Brought to you by a killer with the message:
---
&gt;if we constantly try to make this game one sided or simply unfun for either side then this game will simply die, let's all stop playing killer on the day the nurse nerf is released
---
Meanwhile Nurse existed and Spirit exists. Controversial much?
---
aw, you used to be able to get two heals with it if you ran it with botany knowledge too and I loved it...my Quentin build :(
---
I often see Claudettes fall into their stereotype of being selfish and immersed but I have seen a ton of really awesome Claudettes who are badasses running the killer around like they ain‚Äôt shit. I think who you main shouldn‚Äôt really define your play style, I love Feng Min cause she‚Äôs the cutest girl ever and I don‚Äôt even use her initial perks (except lithe sometimes)
---
Two comments below this, Peanits says it doesn't affect Spine Chill
---
I mean honestly this is like a slap to the face.
---
Then when you complain they smack you on the other cheek and say "at least the first one doesn't hurt so bad now huh?"
---
I've been watching streams for the last bit, and Nurse is definitely not dead. Yeah, you'll no longer have to deal with so many blinks, omega, etc, but her base kit is still extremely dangerous even with the recharge time (which hasn't factored in on any of the games I've watched so far)
---
It‚Äôs an extra perk for people actually playing the game during that time frame and putting in the work. No other game with a battlepass makes it so you can buy the battlepass skins in the store afterwards. That defeats the purpose of playing during that time. They‚Äôre supposed to be rewards for completing the limited time missions and playing the game. You have 70 days to complete the battlepass, that‚Äôs not extremely hard and it‚Äôs quite a while. 
---
It‚Äôs not about the cosmetic itself. I would say it about basically anything that you get in the battlepass. It‚Äôs a reward exclusive to those who actually play and not just people with money. At least make a different variation or something.
---
doesn't mean anything. you still get killer stun points if you fuck up a pallet save
---
How the turntables.
---
I kinda liked playing as old Freddy since it would counter flashlights and bodyblocking.
---
Oh sure, lets just have every survivor spawn in dying state while we‚Äôre at it. I mean, might as well at this point.
---
Broken and OP is still Broken and OP, and none of those compare to the current state of ebony ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You ain‚Äôt from round these parts are ya?
---
Now maybe they can retcon the lore completely. Make it Billy under the mask and change the addon descriptions.
---
Omfg those David and Jane ones look amazing holy shit. Weren't those like Dia de los muertos or some shit like that?
---
Good reference.
---
Candyman for killer
---
Herbert West for survivor
---
It does. It depends on how the killer DCs and this is true on all platforms
---
I was about to comment that. OoO should drop a tier but I‚Äôm firm in my spot of Bond. Probably the most versatile perk for survivors.
---
Amanda never disappoints us with her badass cosmetics
---
you have a full stick up your ass and it's time to go to the emergency room and get it removed
---
I‚Äôve said numerous times now, I don‚Äôt care about having to pay for shit. I care.. when stuff I‚Äôd like to get is locked behind a shit ton of nonsense that they just changed colours of and gave you no option to avoid.
---
Not at all.  I've done it before when the killer played really fair but didn't get kills.
---
;)
---
It‚Äôs official: Do bones
---
LAUIRE???! My heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Ok, insta no more and that's nice, can we now get a nerf to mori too? They are serious bullshit right now
---
Myers getting Undetectable in Tier 1 is a pretty solid buff. For Scratched Mirror builds he no longer needs Monitor and Abuse because Undetectable removes your terror radius anyways.
---
I think Spine Chill is overrated anyways.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure its from Halloween 4
---
Then buy the battlepass? There‚Äôs two tracks. Free and premium. Premium is only $10. What‚Äôs the point of buying a cosmetic you didn‚Äôt rightfully earn? That‚Äôs like competing in a race and earning a medal, but instead you drive to the finish line and pick yours up and not actually race.
---
Tbh if they made it so you couldn't use other add ons to add more hatchets when using irridescent heads it wouldn't be so bad. Trying to dodge 3 insta-downs is a nightmare
---
I seriously wonder which masochist likes to get bullied with Bubba on red ranks.
---
Coming from ‚ÄúThe fisting queen‚Äù I‚Äôm inclined to ignore the fuck out of your comment. Just like you could have ignored my damn post if complaining about a scummy tactic offended you.
---
He‚Äôs still shirtless! LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GO!
---
Yeah was gonna but clown but Nancy here I come
---
All really exciting! I love the new pig cosmetics too!
---
Thanks I think I might need it. Trapper is a personal favorite though so hopefully it‚Äôll be fun.
---
Unlike Nurse. RIP
---
Yep. Not even going to try to play anymore today, feels fucking awful.
---
&gt;Iron Will is more meta because it is one of the only counters to a single killer, does it work on all of them? Yup.
---
You just countered your own argument. Well played. It's more meta exactly for that
---
&gt;So does head on, doesn‚Äôt make it a ‚Äúgood‚Äù perk. Spirit is not balanced
---
Head on isn't as meta as iron will. Not even close. So after this easily debunkable argument which you destroyed yourself "therefore spirit op". Even if she wasn't a problem until recently, when sheeple started to cry about her altogether..
---
I already explained before how easily you can play around. I suggest the same thing I did for the person before, adapt. Also read how I counter most Spirits above
---
I..is that too left a Frank skin by any chance?
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt expecting DBD mobile to be free.

See Depth. All limited time items obtained during events can be sold on the steam market after the fact.  They could make them not marketable/trade-able indefinitely, but instead after a certain amount of time, players can choose to sell those items.
---
Honestly I don't think it's that big of a deal if people pay for the battle pass and/or pay for the items afterwards. It doesn't affect me.
---
But this is all just my opinion.
---
That doc swing would hit me :/
---
Thanks the one game where I did so far the actually killed themselves.
---
Shame I can‚Äôt use botany with a green medkits with max charges for 5 heals anymore
---
You don‚Äôt really get the point of this pass do you man.
---
Its to get cheaper cosmetics at like 200% the reduced price.
---
Oh my God, I need the Jane one!
---
Whispers and working eyeballs/eardrums are perfectly sufficient stealth counters for Nurse
---
On console Spirit is the best killer. So it‚Äôs typical that you‚Äôll run into spirits consistently in red rank on console.
---
No they put it in on purpose
---
It's the basement for you and your friends.
---
They didn‚Äôt buff any killer perk, buffed survivor perks, scoring events, and made instaheals less annoying to go against. 
---
And they said Mori‚Äôs already need to be looked at too so I don‚Äôt really get what you‚Äôre up in arms about.
---
Correct
---
Same issue here. Xbox player. Games just end suddenly and kick me back to the menu, it‚Äôs happening to others I play with too.
---
While a penalty system would be nice it just won‚Äôt ever be doable with the potato performance of this game sometimes. I imagine DC‚Äôs by no fault of our own will be widespread when dedicated servers come
---
Is there anything different about the GF mask?
---
OP is not wrong, they are changing the product which was already in use so existing customers have rights to complain about these changes.
---
Of this battlepass? I understand it completely, man. I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt agree with it. Y‚Äôall are allowed to disagree with my opinion, man.
---
I play on xbox and I'm getting the same thing as you
---
Nurse change was not bad
---
ahhhhhhhhhhh
---
just when i start to level my quentin i have a reason to play Steve again, he looks so fucking good.
---
This is my thought about brand new parts.
---
As pointed out, big thanks to the community at /r/leaksbydaylight for this as well as their amazing discord chat.
---
Seriously, you guys are beyond amazing and I will never stop being grateful to the hard work you do!
---
I‚Äôd like the Devs to make a boatload of profit off of skins and continue supporting this game for years to come.
---
So I can't find any details period specifying what proposed changes they are going to make to insta heals do you know what they are?
---
You sure?
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure FunWorld has the rights to the whole OG GF costume, so I don‚Äôt think DbD has the rights to Scream yet.
---
I have seen someone actually get this perk to activate once since they nerfed it. The perk didnt help him much as he was only survivor left when it activated. It's a dead perk now and will still be a dead perk be after its buff.
---
You can still play the game the same way without them
---
The last paragraph you wrote (I have no idea how to quote text) is exactly why I get nervous when I hear the devs are gunna tweak things. I‚Äôm gunna make a prediction that they‚Äôll fuck up the ‚Äòlooping rework‚Äô by making every pallet unsafe like on Hawkins Lab and it‚Äôll be the start of what kills the game.
---
New Steve cosmetic? Love the shades but no face bandana. Literally unplayable.
---
Just playing BHVR. 
---
Alright, let me just find my wallet here...
---
i hope you're this passionate about things in the world that actually matter
---
Literally what I said. You want free shit without earning it. This is literally THE SAME as unlocking perks to add to other DBD characters. Add ons, skins, everything is literally either earn it with game play or pay for it. What you're really saying is WAH I WANT FREE SHIT RIGHT NOW MAMA I DONT WANT TO WORK FOR IT I DONT WANT TO EARN IT I DONT WANT TO PAY FOR IT GIVE ME FREE SHIT RIGHT NOW. This is gamingcirclejerk material right here. The self entitled "BECAUSE I PLAY THE GAME" air around you is palpable.
---
We can go full on Ghostface bois, and he‚Äôs getting undetectable. All is right in the world.
---
you realize its supposed to be Zoey right? thats why they talk about her backstory in the cosmetic descriptions
---
You think it‚Äôs just a coincidence that the skin based off zoey from L4D looks like zoey for L4D?
---
ahhh now do I use Scoops Ahoy or this?! :(
---
Styptic Agent: Applies the Endurance status effect for 15 seconds on use. Use with secondary action. Depletes Med-Kit on use.
---
Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe: Heals Survivor passively over 8 seconds. Time is modified by perks and add-ons that affect healing speeds. The effect is cancelled if the Survivor changes health state or picked up. Depletes Med-kit on use.
---
Unless the killer slugs to be toxic, pure face camps, or tunnels a poor survivor with no chance of escape ill always send them a GG and make jokes to them about the match.
---
Yesterday I went against a Demogorgon who had an awful game, killed one then I lead him on a chase for three gens and a gate to be opened and escaped. Nea trolling him at some lockers. Sent him a nice message to discuss the chase and how next time in that situation he should know when to call quits etc.
---
The game doesn‚Äôt have to be toxic, we just make it toxic for some Ungodly reason
---
what?
---
Trust me, I already checked out a long time ago, last time I played was 1 year ago. This post is nothing more than a joke at how killers are the only ones being limited by BEHAVIOR. However, I do agree that no one enjoyed playing against and as a nurse whether are they good at playing nurse or not yet it's something that everyone has to deal with, why? Because nurse is the only "good" killer, sure she can be broken with 5 blinks, but that's more of a problem with addons instead of the killer's original power, so to go nerfing the power instead of removing the addons is simply cancer. If you can't take a shitpost with a grain of salt then YOU need to check out of the internet, especially reddit.
---
And that‚Äôs fine for you. But if I‚Äôm putting in over 40 hours on a game to progress in the battlepass or events, then I‚Äôd like something to show for it and not something anyone can pick up if they have extra money laying around. I understand they are thinking about money, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm allowed my opinion too.
---
Losing a survivor makes a huge difference when it comes to completing gens. That‚Äôs generally why once you eliminate someone to begin with, it starts to snowball into getting everyone else. 
---
Also your point is nonsense. If you were going to lose due to EGC, you were going to lose regardless. The only factor that is eliminated is you no longer need to do gens, which increases your chance of survival.
---
Scratched Mirror Myers is nothing like non insta billy. That‚Äôs just like Trapper‚Äôs padded jaws and the beast for wraith: it‚Äôs for BP farming. Scratched mirror or Scarred hand gag is for playing the killer differently.
---
No, indeed
---
lol yes, there is a bunch of left 4 dead skins on dbd. I think Claudette,jake and David has one each
---
F O O T   F E T I S H   M Y E R S! On a real note I‚Äôm gonna buy all of them
---
I can't tell if this is a shitpost or not but it is literally a Zoey outfit. L4D outfits got added when they made Bill a Survivor.
---
I plan on using the bat backpack body and the scoops ahoy head!
---
So, remove the addons. Not nerf the power that makes nurse the only balanced killer in the game.
---
I said ebonies are fine because of ther ultra rare nature and unless you happen to farm the shit out of ur bloodweb its a treat i don't think deserves to be butchered
---
Have I got a Detectives Hunch for you!
---
Does this mean safer cross play between console and PC?
---
Is that Jane getting another cosmetic before Adam?
---
REJOICE !
---
The only nice comment I have received, this subreddit can't take a joke, lmao.
---
AHHH THATS HOT
---
You are a massive fucking buffoon, or a troll,
---
Personally I don't use moris unless it's a daily, so I don't know how reliable I am even as a killer main. Regardless I would like it to work that way and for yellow moris to be baseline to all matches
---
BUT NO 2018 MYERS FUCK
---
I mean hospital gown Myers though.
---
been on the ptb a while, honestly not sure if she's not still SS Tier
---
Someone also told me about this streamer. I don't know how lowkey Pig might be for him as she may be her main since day one. In any kind of maniere, a killer can be strong in the right hands. Like a very good Clown streamer might main him so hard he could say Clown is strong and doesn't need buffs (tho he needs), and that would make equal situation. But believe me or not, there's still a lot of killers in DbD that all offers a different power and gameplay design. Majority of them are superior to Pig in strengh, and the many tweaks she received made her even more weak times after times. So to make her as viable as any other killers, she still needs one/some buff to give her the power role back over swf at rank 1, and give her the love she truly diserves.
---
This gives more wiggle room for perk builds!
---
Look, I don‚Äôt especially care about mori‚Äôs or instant heals. I don‚Äôt use them, I don‚Äôt care when others use them. But mori‚Äôs were nerfed from what they used to be, and instant-heals haven‚Äôt been changed at all since launch besides an increase in their rarities. Now they‚Äôve been nerfed too, it‚Äôs all a part of the ongoing process. Also, bobody is saying anything about the random perks you‚Äôre whining about to try and make me sound unreasonable, so why bring them up? If you wanna talk about mori‚Äôs and instant heals, talk about mori‚Äôs and instant heals.
---
Uhhh what
---
I stopped believing it would actually happen. Dreams really do come true. :')
---
Are they in survival category?? Please?? If they are boldness it is a useless change imo as that one is pretty easy to max already
---
Right. Going against the same killer gets boring. Play anyone. Or everyone.
---
YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
ah yes i too am a functional human and i have conversations all the time
---
I actually... really like these nurse changes. What's wrong with me
---
YOOOOO
---
Semi-shitpost.
---
Jane is a hispanic character and they're doing Day of the Dead cosmetics so it does make sense she would get one.
---
I‚Äôve gotten spirit a couple times in the last few days. :/
---
He was wearing his hospital clothes in the first movie before he killed a mechanic or whoever the dude was wearing the outfit he wears.
---
That‚Äôs what I get when I read lehions lore. Just a bunch of angsty teens and finally jumped into killing purely by trying to protect his friend.
---
I just wish I could prestige the black robe :(
---
But hey, this is true to the movie lore so it's all I EVER WANTED!!!!!!!!!!
---
It does not defeat it? With the battle pass you get 20000 worth of cell cosmetics for 10 bucks and if you beat the pass you get your 1000 cells back so getting all of them free
---
No joke, it's almost, ALMOST worthless to even use those traps sometimes
---
If a games going well, I‚Äôll only Mori on death hook anyway, feels mean otherwise
---
I played with you the doc game. I was dying when you were moonwalking. Sorry I played like shit tho.
---
I love Bond. Don't get me wrong. But not that much lol. But it's your tier list so carry on
---
well, as much as I like battle pass cosmetics being exclusive, it‚Äôs because they want to make money. the battle pass only costs (I think) 1k shards and I think u get 20k worth of cosmetics, so it‚Äôs a better deal than buying them outright. tbh, with dbd already being a paid game with dlc, I think they should be exclusive. but this is how game devs work in 2019.
---
We don‚Äôt see it but there‚Äôs no doubt that‚Äôs what he would have been wearing since he changed his outfit after escaping. I‚Äôve only seen the original and the 2018 sequel but it still makes sense.
---
Spine Chill and Premonition are not affected by the update. So this is wrong.
---
They just need to make it so the medkit does not break honestly
---
I'll let you guess which one I am. Considering the entire post was a joke to trigger survivor mains to begin with.
---
Dunno why people are surprised they've done this literally every year.
---
In my opinion if it‚Äôs in the boldness category and you were already good in a chase it will just help you hit the cap faster. Still great though since you may not have gotten chased a lot and this helps you get rewarded more
---
Ugh, don't remind me, that is easily the worst part of the traps. I swear the game is always rigged in favor of the survivors
---
Those treats show up every bloodweb just about once you're P3.  They aren't nearly as rare as you think.
---
This whole post is incorrect. Spin Chill and Premonition are not affected.
---
I know, but it would be wrong to leave her out of a day of the dead collection.
---
Hopefully Adam gets more soon. Hell, hopefully ALL get more soon lol.
---
No tea bagging or flashlights. But it still shows off skill. Very cool!
---
Ooh boohoo, let me press F on the worlds smallest keyboard
---
Nothing happened.
---
Yeah. It doesn't change base Myers much, but buffing a fun, if gimmicky, add-on is cool.
---
Because they dont really want to do exclusive cosmetics anymore, which is a good stance. The benefit of the battle pass here, is that you can get them earlier, and for cheaper, plus, this pass offers enough cells to pay for the next one.
---
Yup did you even read my comment
---
If they change moris then they better make them cost a hell of a lot less than 7k BP in my bloodweb.
---
Except, buguer king Myers is was more fun to play than no blink nurse.
---
The side that the player finds useful and the side that‚Äôs pretty
---
Running out of Licensed characters without cosmetics.
---
Where is my grandpa Bill cosmetic at BHVR?
---
PLEASE for the love of god remove missions with Unhooking and Cleansing / searching chests etc. Keep it simple.... Trust me. If u gonna do that at some point most people will be at the same mission (yes i know u can choose a different one) but EVERYONE will run over the map and try to find what they have to do (for example get totems).  Stuff like this never worked in other games (RL/LOL)
---
LOL
---
The last time they said that was the trapper/Hag rework. For perspective on how long it‚Äôs been in the works. Don‚Äôt hold your breath.
---
"We want to maintain a level of fairness..."
---
That‚Äôs true. He is seen with it in Halloween 4, with bandages on his face too. I hope they add that, otherwise it‚Äôll be weird with the mask.
---
And honestly, I think console players got this game for free like I did (August free game last year). And it was free again when stranger things chapters released, right?
---
Wait really?
---
Yes, did you?
---
Ur comment has nothing to do with my post but ok
---
Not having to bring a survivor to a hook, and being able to avoid DS altogether is pretty strong. Mori's after 2 hooks would still be powerful, but they wouldn't be the game-breaking terror that they are now.
---
I've usually found that if you smack them down a few times they give up
---
It does but I guess we have to agree to disagree
---
Fuck I didn't see the shit post tag, you got me good.
---
I'm ignoring you now. You're just a troll
---
Looks OP, better nerf before it hits love servers.
---
Why are you so sweaty and toxic? Just throw yourself away.
---
No, not at all. I‚Äôm talking about the cosmetics coming to the shop and you‚Äôre talking about how much cells you get. ????
---
40% of gen is a big deal in the late game
---
Yeah you can still escape without ultra rares amirite? Most killers cant really do well without exposal addons or perks. I have never used syringes and i still escape pretty much every  second game in rank 4
---
Some screenshots on the blog
---
I've done that onc after running into a swf I played with a few games ago that tebagged every pallet drop, flashlight click spammed, butt dance at gate and won't leave till you Chase them out. Picked nurse and demolished them second time and took last guy to hatch just to hook him in front of it
---
They are very similar in design which fit in with Frank and Julie theme.
---
Joey has cloth mask and Karambits
---
Susie has skirts/dresses and improvised weapons 
---
Frank and Julie have a couple wear similar things theme and hunting knives
---
thats actually not true, the last time they mentioned it was just a couple months ago, nurse was specified to be first in line, followed by doctor.
---
Yeah well its still the point. They either need to make more ultra rares for survivors or make all the killer URs crap
---
Check out Peanits comments at the top of the Official Update Thread
---
Open Handed works with Detective's Hunch?
---
As it is now its an early way to kill somebody early, survivors have keys which are wasted to escape early. It's a fair trade
---
Is it just me, or did this subreddit just *all of a sudden,* start hating spirit? Granted, there was always a few things to complain about with the spirit (prayer beads being a hot topic), but I remember people hating on spirit way less in the past.
---
Yeah. They're going to play Ghostface and enjoy the killer they bought without getting absolutely dicked by OoO. What a tragedy.
---
Wait, its mike
---
Still no fix for trapper having to walk around his trap immediately after placing it?
---
Wtf why
---
Pretty sure that's the new lore based character named the observer
---
If you never used them are they really ever Rip?
---
Guess I am one of the few who prefer new ghostface's leather costume over his original.
---
Legion can have the shirtless cosmetic, we got bare feet Myers now üòé
---
Both should count, should be lowered to 2 required, but can still only proc one time per game.
---
That would be 1 million times better than it is now or prenerf imo
---
I'd purchase it day one.
---
Will any cosmetics/ auric cells gained from PTB archives carry over or would you just be wasting 10$ by trying the Rift out in PTB?
---
And it might be that you can even eventually earn 1000 on the free track over multiple seasons, so no need to pay!
---
He reminds me of the bug guy from men in black
---
Holy shit, this is amazing! People been wanting that Steven skin for quite a while now, the one on the far left is apparently a Michael skin which is unexpected but a great surprise and oh my Entity, is that the original Ghostface costume?? That's wonderful!
---
And again this game gets more lovely cosmetics.
---
Exactly. I have nothing against keys. And I have nothing against mori‚Äôs. I play both killer and survivor and I don‚Äôt mind either of these things, people need to stop bitching.
---
Who is forcing you to pay for anything?
---
That would be nice. So far I've only got the Facebook groups to post to. Just trying to start getting some.views and I know people are interested in see if new streamers that aren't all the same go to ones like Otz, True, Zubat, etc.
---
isnt that true for all the survivors who cry about her without playing her or any killer whatsoever?
---
imagine observing a toxic SWF teabagging and clicking flashlights at leatherface
---
"Have you watched any footage of an actual good killer streamer playing her?" LOL Even new survivors can abuse every mechanic that can be used to escape a killer. Windows, Pallets and even walls or floor levels. You gotta be trolling.
---
Oh, c'mon dude. This post was flaired as a shitpost for a reason, take a hint or take a hike off reddit brother.
---
Those way better survivors don't do anything to teach their viewers how to loop or run tiles though.  They just meme and try to entertain while doing it.  True will sit at a jungle gym vs. T wall etc... and show you where to stand and how to react to loop it efficiently.
---
I've watched so many vids of his over the years he is absolutely better as killer than you are giving him credit for.  He plays all of them and I've seen him to rank 1 no perks no addon seasons.  I don't always agree with his views but he's on point a lot more than he isn't with a lot of what he says regarding game balance.  In my experience there are usually two large groups of players that despise him.  The babykillers who run NOED hate him for ripping on the use of the biggest crutch perk left in the game.  And the toxic survivors that exclusively play swf 4 mans hate him for accurately describing the insane ingame advantage they have on comms.
---
I hope they are all survival. Boldness is already fairly easy to max
---
Killing the nurse just means making spirit played twice as much
---
All youre saying sounds extremely toxic
---
I wont comment on sweaty or toxic, but the devs did hand them a mobile insidious so certain players use it in that regard. Plus it counters borrowed time until you're broken out.
---
I have conflicted feelings about this comemnt
---
I dont t√∫nel ds is not a problem for me and bring a survivor to a hook is like ten seconds nobody will buy a mori again
---
I think so,  with all these consoles I‚Äôm sure bhvr knows that people will want to cross save
---
ACTUAL CANNIBAL SHIA LABEOUF
---
Where does it say that?
---
Ajay! We love this bitch.
---
Yes homo
---
**ez**
---
What do you think about the rest of the list?
---
Except that all the Battle Pass content will be available to purchase from the store later, so everyone wins?  If random people want to purchase levels to get keychains that you don't care about, what do you care?  More money for the devs to put into the game.
---
kekW
---
I feel like it‚Äôs too late. The more stuff they change and add the harder it gets to make it all work together and how to not get everyone mad who has bought skins on more than one platform.
---
But I also thought it was too late to get dedicated servers so who knows.
---
I think we can finally, *unironically*, say that **they've done a pretty good job so far.**
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to see more Mori‚Äôs in the web and new mori animations added to the game.  
---
Requiring two hooks helps balance it out.  Being able to mori the first survivor unhooked is somewhat broken atm.
---
Don‚Äôt buy them if you don‚Äôt want them?
---
While I am thrilled about Ghostface
---
The fuck is up with Pig. That looks like Bebop, not Saw killer.
---
Dbd is pretty balanced it‚Äôs just matchmaking
---
Or if you brought bandages (brown addon) now you need the green one for 2 heals.
---
Definitely a nerf.
---
But hey all other medkits were buffed so i guess its fine?
---
Basically;  [&lt;3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnIFvqADpdA)
---
Or like making unhooking longer! Where the entity has a hold on them and it takes a little bit longer to unhook.
---
Yaaaas! We have no choice but to stan
---
Mine is zimm_zimm_zala_bim
---
There‚Äôs people that are dying Kim
---
Thats what happens when they are left over scavenger models from Deathgarden
---
Nope, it's clearly on the Premium part of the battle pass on the screenshots they gave us.
---

David looks like he just gave Jake a blowjob.
---
If they wiggle, stand still and shake "no" for 2 seconds. IF they keep doing it, go to the hook and hook them, otherwise take them to hatch.
---
Bunny mommy is better than vomi mommy.
---
&gt;Only unopened chest auras and items dropped on the ground will be revealed to the perk owner. 
---
Only unopened chests. So if someone loots basement, and I'm running killer to killer shack, it will look safe...
---
Bad change. Use your eyes and you can see it's already looted, no need to hide it.
---
Yeah I guess definitely could have been worse.  It could have been just another straight survivor nerf with nothing ceded by the other side.  Fair enough point.
---
This is the only DLC I care about.
---
Somebody just posted a video on this sub a couple days ago showing themselves playing at Steve with this glitch for the entire match. They were just zooming all around the map. It is a glitch, not a hack.
---
RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS
---
Agreed !! :)
---
Nah. But I'm pretty sure the survivors would love it if killers walked into pallet stuns and opened the gates for them every game.
---
Agreed. At this point, they should just pull a Destiny 2. The game already has FTP monetization, might as well actually make it FTP to bring in those extra players.
---
Drop D Flat
---
It's very simple, all power chords.
---
I'm loving a lot of the new changes but this invisible nurse bug needs to be fixed
---
Found the rank 20.
---
don't fucking tell me 3 person games are a thing again
---
I‚Äôd like to see more common mories but they shouldn‚Äôt have a great affect on the balance of the game
---
* Nerf moris to require two hooks
---
* Increase Mori offerings in the bloodweb (feel free to replace fog offerings)
---
* Add new mori animations to the game for every killer
---
Definitely. And I know it goes against rules. I rarely ever post I'm streaming here but I figured I would once today just to see if I'd get some views from it
---
Who said I was?
---
I had the same problem. For me it was a matter of time, but idk what it's like for you
---
I have another 20 dollar motorcycle to sell you. It also blinks.
---
Yeah just take your time.
---
We'll just be waiting 3 years for you guys to finally address those things :)
---
Yes I get that. But why would they put the cosmetics that are in the pass in the shop? It would make a lot more sense if they left it so you had to grind the battle pass to get exclusive cosmetics.
---
Fjuck yeah.
---
Tell me about "IT IS COSMETIC ONLY". Cosmetic matters, if it does not matter for you - go walk naked outside. What? Do not want? Cosmetics matters. I want to my character look the way I like. Stop this bull shit about "it is cosmetic only" - hearing it today is just ridiculous.
---
Or how about cost of the full game? Buying game itself + all DLC will take you over $80, not saying it is partially P2W because you can't do your best in the game without perks which is paywalled until they appear in shrine. And amount of grind in this game? Sure, they allowed you to get 2 perks now per blood web which is improvement. But still you will have to grind more.
---
You know, I love this game and play it a lot. I am donating and spent may be more than $200 in it. But I am not blind to realize that the game becomes greedier and greedier over time.
---
I got about 5 in a row as well... and 4 of those games on the swamp :(((
---
It just doesn't look like Ghostface save you know the face. It looks like someone decided they were remaking Scream and need to fix something that wasn't broke. 
---
Hell, Ghostface in general is my biggest disappointment in DbD DLC. I wanted him because of the movie franchise. Not because I thought he was cool looking. 
---
At least with the OG look there's something that resembles the Ghostface I know about him. And not just the ''He's Michael but he crouches like Pig!" mish mash we got in a killer that could've been REALLY original.
---
Everytime I see OoO as an acronym I always think of spooky ghosts
---
Survivors who get borrowed timed can mend themselves without the need for self care or a kit.
---
I see no problem with this image.
---
I saw it, and figured, I‚Äôm just making a joke that minipets can‚Äôt be far behind and I want that OG distract pig or a baby croc, please and thank you! New stuff looks great! Thanks for your team‚Äôs efforts!
---
Yep that‚Äôs understandable. Don‚Äôt know if nurse balances have come out yet, but I can only watch some, streamers highlights of DBD and from what I‚Äôve watched they never really encounter nurse (of course they may just not be uploading those games). So it seems strange to me that 9 out of 10 games is against spirit.
---
Demogorgon and trapper should switch in my opinion. And I play those two a LOT.
---
Looks very nice
---
I don‚Äôt like this sort of video. Just disorienting and boring.
---
NEXT
---
This post.
---
I see your NASCAR bubba, and I raise you literally instasaw bubba: charge time .5 seconds with 110% speed normal movement
---
It's all good, I dont take the game seriously enough to care about losing or to care about teammates not playing perfect :)
---
Change it to ultra rare, or give it a negative effect
---
next patch bellow D tier:
---
Except Nurse.
---
Thanks, I came up with it myself.
---
Colour me impressed no flashlights or bagging in sight, well done you
---
It‚Äôs the observer the eye is a dead give away
---
That‚Äôs literally not at all what‚Äôs happening
---
There‚Äôs actually lots of survivors who explain what they are doing and why they are doing it. Also, I belong in neither of those groups so you‚Äôre wrong
---
Okay well, its happening now? So I'm not sure what the relevance is.
---
I can understand that. I personally love the new look because I think it's just well designed but I can see where you're coming from.
---
Nurse main here, gonna spam spirit now
---
It takes them **years** to fix broken killer shit 
---
Mettle of man literally got nerfed within a week after release, but prayer beads, moris, and iridescent heads are still left untouched
---
From one of Baker's Journals:
---
&gt;I have spent two days in this derelict library. **The archives** are somewhat unorganised, but I have managed to learn more about the town of Weeks. I get this eerie feeling as I sit in that basement, but I feel a need to learn more. I have come too far now.
---
I want to see Legion's power be more combo based, like starting out with a lower speed and accelerating/extending with every unique vault/hit until you become a literal speed demon.
---
Mori‚Äôs are for dailies, death hooks or new releases. I‚Äôd rather play the game than ruin the game for the survivors and myself. If instaheals get nerfed so should mori‚Äôs.
---
Yes. Completely negating the skill of the other four players in the game and making everything they've done irrelevant.
---
I really like your art style. Its awesome
---
Check my post history I'm a killer and survivor switch. I have juat been bitching about the survivor changes because I play solo most of the time.
---
Which these changes affects the most.
---
Seems like you dont ever play survivor so maybe you are not tbe best to talk about thier problems or grievances?
---
OHMIGOD THE NANCY JACKET. BUY
---
Brand new parts are still ultra rare despite being one of the weaker addons lol
---
You won‚Äôt see a whole lot of nurse games uploaded on YouTube from survivor POV since most of those games a nurse will just wax the entire team in a couple minutes. Red tank Nurses on PC are playing a different game.
---
????Are you comparing real life clothes to bunch of fking pixels????
---
Stop with this bullshit that game devs get greedier and greedier - video games cost a lot more to produce today than 10 years ago, so ofc they must find a way to make more money than 10 years ago.
---
Ah yes, another Omega Dweet of culture.
---
It‚Äôs a video of me 360ing a killer and then getting hatch.     It was pretty exciting for me. I know that it doesn‚Äôt translate to the video but you don‚Äôt have to be an ass about it
---
Oh my fucking god, same. At least be a little original if you're going to do a joke like that, you know what I mean?
---
Operation rake in the lake
---
Obviously they had ghostface otherwise he wouldn't be in the game. The reason why he looks different in the game is because Funworld let BHVR make their own version of Ghostface.
---
Did you play against the hag last night? I was the killer and had a dwight that had this exact play style
---
It's **way** cheaper to grind them out of the pass then it will be to buy it from the store.
---
Meh 360ing isn‚Äôt all that impressive though as any actual good killer won‚Äôt fall for it and you‚Äôll just end up on your ass.
---
missing THX sound
---
Ok, that one kinda made me chuckle, but you can do better! I know you can! Come on, drop some insults about my family or my choice of charecter or sHuT uP!
---
HOLY SHIT please let this be real I NEED IT
---
I hate this argument. You all act like I'm complaining because it costs something. I'm a grown ass man with disposable income and a pretty large budget for my main hobby, which is PC gaming.
---
My problem with this battle pass is this:
---
1. I own every single skin in the game. Now I have to buy something so that I can GRIND skins. I can't even buy them straight up, which is what I would do. Additionally, this is time limited. Meaning that if I don't play enough within a limited amount of time I get cheated out of skins forever. Sometimes I get month-long business trips. I'm fucked then.
---
2. They're trying to force people to log on more every day to grind more, hoping that it'll end up with them buying more killers/survivors.
---
3. This kind of predatory milking tactic is something I would expect from a free to play game, not for a game that charges you an entry fee AND charges you for characters in the game.
---
No, you don't have to buy it, but no one should be praising them for asking for money. 
---
The reason I stopped playing Warframe is that they added some battle pass crap like this and being forced to log on even when I didn't want to burned me out.
---
My point is, why would they even put them in the shop anyways? They should be exclusive to the battle pass
---
That‚Äôs very clearly Claudette
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs purpose is to close the gap so chases don‚Äôt last 5+ minutes. So what killers mostly get their hits from it, If it was no longer a thing killers probably would never get hits on good survivors. I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt remove it, but tweak the speed increase a little.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Just tired of the all changes while the solo survivor experience is left in the dust
---
Bugs are more important than a killer being weak. If you think having a 0.1 meter speed difference between killers makes pig "even worse" i just wont even argue anymore
---
[GoodB ye](https://youtu.be/miZHa7ZC6Z0)
---
We found a narcissist boys
---
A rank 1 survivor in lobbies of rank 15 killers lmao
---
This isn't about how *you* play.
---
3rd year anniversary and Chinese new year. I'm not sure if there were other events that gave them out as I started playing around the end of the Christmas event last year
---
Look at him here lol https://youtu.be/YEkBk5Mm0lc
---
I never said it was impressive.    Also just to say.  I‚Äôm rank 11 and the killer was 12 so it wasn‚Äôt that bad of a killer. Also you can see that he got the 3k so he had to be decent
---
It looks like a big chubby cheeked ghost!
---
Do it or you hate fun
---
Care to share those survivor streamers with the rest of the class?  I'm genuinely curious.  I know you're not going to hit me with Monto, Noob or Puppers because none of them teach while doing it just memes and entertainment.  Hit us with some of your survivor recommendations if you got some good ones I'd genuinely like to know for the next time beginner survivors post to this sub looking for loop advice.  I definitely will agree to disagree with you downplaying True the people that watch consistently can clearly see the guy is a very solid killer but your survivor point could be interesting if you have recommendations to back it up.
---
Nah, I‚Äôve noticed a lot of killers at higher ranks aren‚Äôt that great tbf. A lot of bad players about in general.
---
Don‚Äôt get so defensive, 360ing just isn‚Äôt that impressive

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df3j0z/if_you_could_change_one_thing_for_each_killerbe/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The first one probably just had the daily and didn‚Äôt care for the pip lmao
---
Id say this is one of the most fair varients of a battle pass because, the cosmetics you get won't be rare and exclusive, but for only 1000 auric cells and grinding the game you get all them for free plus enough to buy the next one.
---
Other examples of battle passes are a lot worse. Think of it like this though, it's optional and all cosmetic. Hope this changes your thoughts some.
---
Yup, lot of other cool things like hospital myers and tunnel Steve.
---
They tried it and it was just barely viable, not even remotely busted.
---
Downing people is map pressure. 
---
It makes people go off gens.
---
I believe Dimension Films owns the rights to the cloak, FunWorld owns the rights to the mask. I could be wrong, though.
---
Yeah it's mostly a good meme, most, if the time they all get broken pretty quickly ;~; but when they don't BOY is it a fun time
---
None of those I was going to mention actually. Ussylis, Ayrun (AaronPlaysTV) to name two educational + entertaining ones. Then there‚Äôs Zubat who doesn‚Äôt always explain his actions but knows more about balance than anyone else so he‚Äôll comment on that after a series of actions.
---
My idea would be to add an animation to unlocking (maybe 5-10 seconds long or so). That way the survivor must be more strategic and can‚Äôt just t-bag on the hatch until the killer comes.
---
You clearly didn't play it then. It was basically a straight buff since they made it work against all killers and not just M1. MoM has far too stong of an effect to be consistent.
---
Yeah when I decide to give hatch and the survivor wiggles and I keep shaking my head no and swinging at the air while avoiding hooks, their incompetency just earned them death lol
---
Especially when it's the first person on the hook .-.
---
That's something I've been wondering about too... Can't think of a single reason
---
Exactly lol. I actually WANT to support this game. Unfortunately I'm picky about cosmetics and my characters, so aside from DLC I don't spend much. I welcome a new way to support a game in which i've gotten WAY more than my moneys worth.
---
I also hate the 'good focus of resources' shit that people keep saying. Like...do people not realize that different departments focus on different things? You can't just throw every dev in the building on one issue and it magically gets fixed faster. That's not how any of this works lmao.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why chests are still not affected by luck offerings, it gives a reason to use them to try and get better items / add-ons
---
Keep in mind that Ghostface completely lacks mobility and is at his strongest when sneaking up on people that are healing. It's just a bad play to cross most maps in many situations. You lose your pressure, might get broken out of stealth on the way, and might have to initate a chase from scratch rather than with a free hit or exposed effect from stalking. I don't tunnel people off the hook, but I'll smack or expose the unhooker if I'm in the area and get a Nurse's Calling proc.  It's 100x more efficient than wandering the map with an M1 killer.
---
I can't tell you what I'm thinking right now.
---
Buying it in the shop is no different than buying it in the pass except you have to earn it, but since you earn it you also earn a bunch of other rewards too.
---
Couldn't find you
---
No, but if you play her you‚Äôre probably gonna get the L.
---
Im not drunk I swear
---
Hmm, but you don't really get them free though, right? You're still paying the price to get the battle pass. Sure, if you finish it and then the buy the next one with the Auric Cells you earned through BP1, you won't need to pay any additional cost, but you'll still have payed the initial battle pass price tag to get the auric cells form the BP in the first place.
---
Nurse is still better. She can traverse the map way better and gets downs quicker. You guys are being drama queens.

Everything that you can buy with money in dbd is skin, you paid for the game, you have the game, if you wanna look fancy, pay, that's how stuff should work, if you want perks you can buy them with shards in the shrine (the dlc ones) or buy the killer/survivor with 9k of it

Gives her speed of a normal killer too

I‚Äôm not good at 360s so what I do is just start going left, then when they swing, turn right till I‚Äôm clear.

I like hiding behind those barrels of fire too lol.

The song lmaoo
---
You clearly never heard the eardrum shattering sound that is the dokkan battle opening SE.
---
Then what does this undetectable thing mean
---
Nah, it's probably the hospital gown from H4. Laurie's is the dress she wore at the start of Halloween, if/when we get Old Myers we'll probably also get Old Laurie at the same time
---
I wouldn't eat anything Plague gave me
---
Then she's fucked. These developers obviously don't know what a slight nerf is.
---
New status effect?
---
This is a DBD Thread...
---
Premonition does? or is it changed
---
Don't worry, spirit will definitely get nerfed aswell.
---
I don‚Äôt play much nurse but from watching the PTB you can see her first blink is back as soon as her fatigue is ending so 3 seconds after that and you‚Äôre back to 2 blinks. I feel like most nurse mains will adjust really quick
---
YES!
---
YEEESSSS!
---
WWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZUUUP?!
---
I didn't think people would take a meme do seriously. I'm sure you could say it is a variation of many childhood games, but I was saying freeze tag because of the killer is "It" and then you get hit and hooked and can't do anything until you are unhooked.
---
Fair enough, but let's be honest it's 10 dollars and I can't speak for everyone but I know many people have 10 dollars lying around it they want to participate in the rift. I personally am excited because it'll give me new ways to play the game while also giving me rewards. (not to mention the best Claudette cosmetic yet is in there Imo)
---
It's obviously not. Being able to bypass DS, not using up a hook, saving time from the pick up, walking and placing them on the hook -anywhere- is still very strong. Right now Mori's are disproportionately powerful, but I think they have a place in the game except that they need to be adjusted just like instant-heal was.
---
NEW LEGION COSMETICS
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
This is too real lmao
---
LAURIE LOOKS SO CUTe omgggggv
---
Why must you do this to my wallet BHVR hgggggn
---
I know, its an inside joke for ppl that play it. Its a very loud fucking sound effect.
---
The videos and memes of it make me laugh to tears especially the 'Superma'am' one xD
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/FurtiveLittleHorseradishMau5](https://clips.twitch.tv/FurtiveLittleHorseradishMau5) And another one
---
I hope they change her lobby idle animation a bit, because as of right now, the RBT they gave her clips through her leg 90% of the time.
---
lol can we stop calling each other dumb dumbs I feel like i'm moderating a preschool
---
I think she's going to be usurped by Billy with Rin on his shoulders.
---
OP is unclear in his explanation. The devs have revealed that the paid track costs 1000 auric cells. Hopefully they will also include an iri shard payment option
---
There is a learning curve, but after that, Nurse was OP. 
---
‚ÄúIn the right hands like all other killers‚Äù ignores the actual complaints people are making. You are choosing to just dismiss the actual issues.
---
Finally a tier list I can get behind!!
---
Have you been hurt my friend?
---
This is fucking glorious
---
3 things
---
-No terror radius 
---
-No red stain
---
(Most of them already had these two)
---
-Auras can not be revealed
---
So this now affects things like Object of Obsession and Dark Sense.
---
I'll be sure to check out the first two to see if you got something there.  Always looking for recommendations when I see players pop on here asking for looping advice.  
---
You lost me with Zubat though.  He is an amazing killer but a so so survivor from what I've seen.  Also I'm genuinely surprised you're a fan of him given your opinions on True.  Zubat is considerably more entitled as a killer than anything True says.  I've seen Zubat say some wild shit about survivors.  He feels like a pretty biased killer main when I watch him.  Again in awe of his huntress play but I don't put much stock into his balance views.
---
Do you have a link?
---
I think you definitely should, the editing can improve as you go (they're really funny and charming already). They'd be well received and you could eventually make some money out of them!!
---
Getting back in the locker after the DS.  Beautiful.
---
Charms will be visible from across the map making you a huge target calling it now.
---
._.
---
I'm a Ghost Face main....
---
Guess I have to live in a trashcan now....
---
Each blink cools down individually, nerfing base blink range, and a bunch of useless add ons. Some of which mimic her perks. I don't think she's going to be dumpstered, but expect to see a lot more spirits. 
---
Until she gets nerfed too.
---
Ash: *gets a cool skin with a jacket*
---
Amanda : hold my traps
---
I‚Äôm just glad survivors who dc will now cough up the blood points for me.  Also, all those new bp scenarios.  Pretty good job so far.
---
You got me
---
Yeah that's exactly why i think it is not a big deal
---
They're evolving
---
So basically, Wraith and Pig won‚Äôt be bullied by OoO anymore, but Spine Chill and Premonition still have their effects? That‚Äôs a welcome change!
---
Don't waste your time at this point. Unless you're already a god tier nurse, this "change" is terrible. You're better off with Spirit or Billy. Until they nerf them too.
---
Oh but I do
---
Being able to bypass DS (on third hook only) is not a big enough benefit for that much of a nerf. You can bypass DS by slugging or just not tunnelling, which is optimal play anyway most of the time anyway. The primary reason mori's are good is for the quick kill. The animation is very long, frequently it takes longer than taking them to the nearest hook would have. Not using a hook is such a situational benefit it's hardly worth mentioning, especially because basement hooks don't break. Unless survivors are sabotaging hooks, you can almost always reach one in time, even after breaking three yourself with sacrifices.

This is true...the devs stated during the anniversary stream that they themselves wanted to give ghostface an original twist
---
I remember the first time I went against Hag. I literally shit bricks
---
Thank you for your reply! I wholeheartedly dislike this change. Nurse was really fun to play now she seems to be a shadow of herself. :(
---
I believe there‚Äôs a free pass and a paid pass coming.
---
I mean why don‚Äôt you want a battlepass? You don‚Äôt have to buy it, it just gives cosmetics to those who want to buy it. What‚Äôs the matter?
---
More EXP and cosmetics are never a bad thing. Also they aren‚Äôt mandatory to play the game, so really what difference would one make?

It's a perk that screws both the survivor and the killer over in a sense, only benefitting people who play as a group (SWF) since the Object person uses the perk to tell everyone where you are all the time. Takes the point and the fun out of playing stealth killers and toxic players always like teabagging and bm'ing while looking at you with it
---
These look amazing! Say what you want about the devs but they're really giving us what we want lately.
---
oh fuck this changes my entire opinion, i thought it was a basically a whole map mapping if a gen popped opposite of you lmao
---
Battlepass BAD, Rewards BAD. You go gamer!
---
"I don't want to pay for cosmetics and I also don't want a way for people to pay to get cosmetics"
---

---
Well, looks like I‚Äôm a Nancy main now
---
It looks good but you can't beat OG
---
The best way to use them is to bait the hit, killers have the huge speed reduction when in the successful hit animation. So if you drop it at the right spot, you can almost guarantee it. That wraith played it correctly but he was just a little to close to the firecracker. 
---
I ran out of firecrackers so I could do anymore üò§
---
Re-posting since it originally wanted to make the ratio of the photo 2:3 and destroyed the quality of it too.
---
Don‚Äôt thank me for telling the truth:)
---
but that's the thing, you buy the battlepass adn new updates but if they don't fix the problems now. Who knows what problems the pass will bring
---
BUG FIXES
---
KEYS
---
Keys now take 15 seconds after use to unlock black locks.
---
Hmm ‚Äò_‚Äô
---
I think it‚Äôs because you use the same button to do a kill with that add on so they do that to prevent you from stalking someone on accident and slowing down instead of getting the kill
---
Yeah, a lot of people say it's not a bad change but honestly I think the cooldown is going to kill her viability. If they'd also fixed the map pressure problem, i.e it's impossible on other killers, I'd be a lot more cool with it but I think this is going to turn high ranks into a Billy-fest
---
His name is hookie.

Spine Chill and Premonition don‚Äôt work on Tier 1 Myers. Is he just special that way?
---
I didn't see any Huntress nerfs
---
The toxic ghost face mains well deserved
---
Did you just not play when Ash came out? It's not a dead hard. You ignore a hit, get a speed boost to get you to the next safe loop, and get 3 hits in a chase (and can pair actual dead hard with it). It was need because literally every single survivor ran it literally every single game because it was that broken. It had no real downside. If the unhook adding stacks was fine then they probably would have added it in when they did the rework. Their testing clearly showed it was still too good.
---
THERE IS A LEGION SKIN?! *dances happily*
---
"Pallets should be removed"
---
*0.9 hours on record*
---
Wtf is a rift pass
---
You're incorrect. Funworld owns the license for the mask, not the character of Ghostface as seen in Scream. BHVR's version of the character looks the way it does to make it legally distinct from the character from the films.
---
Bringing in the classic look means one of two things: either BHVR now has the Scream liscense, or their lawyers have determined that they have taken enough steps to distinguish the character that it is safe to have an alternate skin look like the classic version of the character.
---
g o d a m n. how is this spoiled lol? I just think battle pass items should inherently be exclusive, as it makes the grind / working for them more satisfying. I‚Äôm not saying bvhr is overly greedy or anything, just saying that they want to make money, answering op‚Äôs question. and at the end of the day I‚Äôm not wrong, they are a company. they want to make profit.
---
&gt;Are you forgetting that there are countless DLC, including licensed ones(which can only be purchased through actual money, and not playing time)?
---
So... How do you expect they to pay for their contract? Dbd give you the perks sometimes, do you expect what?
---
&gt;The shrine is also completely RNG based, and uses the same currency as the earnable skins
---
Yes! Because shrine is a help to people that can't afford to buy killers/survivor, you shouldn't relly on it because DEVS NEED MONEY, THEY HAVE A JOB.
---
&gt;So I can pick one, but the other one will have to wait a long time for me to be able to afford it again
---
Or you know... Play the game and actually farm shards so you can buy every single perk on shrine,  if you don't wanna spend money on dbd, at least grind it.
---
&gt;having a couple rare exceptions here and there. 
---
So you mean that sometimes you can Just don't buy a killer/survivor because the shrine already gave the it's Best perk? Huh
---
&gt;Also, the earnable killers/survivors is extremely steep. I can either pay the $12(AUD) and get the DLC, or I can grind for hours upon hours upon, you guessed it, even more hours so I can get them in game,
---
That! This is your problem, I work 5 hours a day and study 4, my free time is around 4 hours, so I can't grind stuff, then I use money to get them faster, that's a trade, Me being able to buy Hag and get Ruin fast don't make me better than you having to grind her and get Ruin, I don't have time, so I buy time, there's no vantage in spending real money in dbd, money = less time grinding, it's not like I can buy tier 4 perks with money, no, DEVS HAVE TO MAKE MONEY.
---
&gt;Sounds kinda bullshit to me
---
One day you will work and will be like "Instead of buying this big mc donald, I'll buy Michael myers because I'm not a fan of grinding" and then you will understand how stupid you sound. Don't forget DEVS NEED TO MAKE MONEY
---
Would it just make DS even more mandatory if  it was usable to cancel a mori animation with/without the 1 hook requirement? Would make a cool new animation too.
---
Well if you‚Äôve played other games that have battle passes, the battle pass doesn‚Äôt affect the already existing gameplay. For example; on Fortnite, you‚Äôre only receiving cosmetics and skins for weapons and what not, neither the cosmetics or the skins for guns affect the overall game. A battlepass wouldn‚Äôt bring any bugs unless it was a bug that affected a cosmetic with something like a clipping issue.
---
No. Not a legion skin. Multiple. Legion skins!
---
It's not a good reason to nerf red mori's? Correct. However, this guy is notorious for asking for mori's to be flat out removed from the game, and the reasons in my comment is a good reason to not flat out remove mori's from the game.
---
 It's their money so don't worry how they spend it.
---
Basically the battle pass added in the Archives update, viewable in the PTB.
---
You recover the first blink by the time fatigue is over. You have to wait 3 seconds to double blink again. That is all.
---
It's really not as awful as you are making it out to be.
---
The Observer simply watched, as the survivors taunted and mocked the killer, before forgetting that the killer had NOED. One of them was hooked, and as the others fled to try and teabag at the exit gates, they found it blocked by Blood Warden.
---
The Observer simply smiled. The bloodbath soon began, and sacrifices were made.
---
As the killer and survivors stalked back to their starting points, faint voices could be heard in the back of the Observer‚Äôs mind:
---
*‚ÄùBRO SPIRIT IS SO OP. WTF BEHAVIOR, FUCK U TRASH KILLER‚Äù*
---
The Observer did not know who this ‚ÄúBehavior‚Äù was, perhaps it was another name for the Entity, and another reason to tempt the hands of the uncaring benevolent force that watched over them all, a moment of respite and rebellion against the watchful eye of some guardian of pain.
---
Or maybe they were just salty.
---
The entire implementation of the 'battle pass' is UI based - a completely separate team from those that fix gameplay issues. So none, would be the answer to your inquiry.
---
When does this come out on console
---
He 100% camped because of object of obsession. If I'm ghostface and there's someone running it, I'll do everything I can to eliminate them as soon as possible, otherwise they invalidate my power, and if they're in a group I'm useless.
---
I had a bug where the chase music was on all the game, plus i had the spirit hearth on my ear while she was miles away.
---
Also it is me or the survivor camera feels weird? kinda a bit lower than before? i've noticed that is hard to open the gates while looking behind, the survivor body cover a lot more of the screen and kinda blocks more vision than before, you cant see so often through them.
---
Buckle up fellow Ashleys, we are about to see the killer on the flip flop after testing their mettle!
---
I agree with the person above and second their opinion that you might enjoy Jeff's perks best. If you like helping teammates, aftercare is really good. Not only do you see their aura after a rescue/heal, but they see your aura too! It's very helpful especially if you are a solo survivor. You can see your teammate on a gen, being chased, or opening an exit gate amongst other things and then use that information to be the most help to your team. Very good perk, highly underrated.
---
Alright I love this skin
---
I‚Äôve never played a game where I didn‚Äôt get max boldness points.
---
I always thought they were the easiest points to get, but now I guess I‚Äôll max them out even faster now.
---
Most games don't even have the option to get dlc for free. This game does and on top of that, the amount of times this game has been discounted is insane, and some got it for free! I don't understand your grievances.
---
if you‚Äôve seen the dbd custom game mode in overwatch (which actually is what got me into dbd), tracer usually is the nurse character.
---
Ahhh. I see it now
---
the skins being on store after the Bp is over is confirmed? And do we know if we can use shards on those cosmetics once they come out?
---
One I actually want could be a Leatherface addon that works like Tombstone. Chainsaw is extremely hard to hit (longer charge time, sparks and flames flying out to signify the danger, auto-tantrum if you miss, etc.) but if you do manage to connect you mori the survivor.
---
The nerf is for nurse, made a math post about it, some data is probably wrong but oh well at least it's somewhat close.
---
Okay facecamping demogodgon. The rework on Nurse was very much needed &amp; she‚Äôs still so fucking good. She‚Äôs been the same for 3 years &amp; most dedicated Nurse mains have admitted they rarely ever get less than a 4K even w/ a really great group of survivors who have learned to ‚Äòadapt and overcome.‚Äô 
---
Now nurse players can adapt &amp; overcome this new change. (&amp; probably still wreck survivors)
---
Between 1-2 weeks when this midchapter is pushed to live.
---
I fully support this.
---
funny ocmedy fummy nfunyn
---
Dude this is insane! If you made posters of these I‚Äôd buy it, honestly
---
If it makes you feel better, I think the changes are in the right direction. I just don‚Äôt think it should deplete the item anymore. Also not a fan of how they changed emergency kits. Botany+Pharmacy was a good off-meta combo to get two quick self heals while also normally healing other survivors faster so you didn‚Äôt need a med-kit for them to be up quicker. Now it‚Äôs just a one faster heal albeit I haven‚Äôt seen the speed but two perks just to heal fast once with a kit kinda feels lame- no longer a nice combo :(
---
I love this do you have a yt channel?
---
RIP Nurse, you will be missed.
---
During the Hallowed Blight event! Should be starting this month!
---
Lol I bet that I could still loop for 5 gens and If I would die in the end I would still depip. Well maybe in another 3 years BHVR will understand where skill is in their own game
---
So about 2 weeks into the event and is there like a free version and a purchasable version
---
I thought boldness was very easy to max too, but ive seen other people say it‚Äôs hard to get points in. But I personally always max out boldness each game
---
Hope they nerf Insta heals and Dead hard then, Why should survivors be able to take in Free second chances if they are just going to nerf every killer
---
But how is it fun to have skins that you can't buy anymore later? If they made something to get an extra killer or survivor then i would understand a little but the battlepass is not something that belongs in this game.
---
I can share my vision on it and you yours. I just think that this game doesn't need a battlepass because its not that kind of game.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but a lot of the cosmetics that are only Auric Cells only are horrible imo (Claudette and Meg‚Äôs) like they aren‚Äôt even remotely decent looking to me
---
I honestly agree with you,  I can't aim for shit
---
No you fool, bed sheet Myers is the holy grail and canon.
---
"Most rewards will be exclusively available via The Archives for a period of time and released into the Store at least 6 months after their Rift has ended. More information will be provided at a later date."
---
This is what was said on the forum page about the archives.
---
Toxic survivor mentality.
---
Pointing at the killer to tease him is toxic af
---
OMFGG STEVE AND GHOSTFACE OMG INSTA BUY THANK YOU BHVR
---
They didn't nerf Huntress what do you mean?
---
You gain back the first blink by the time fatigue ends. You have to wait 3 seconds to double blink again, that is all.
---
It's really not that bad. If you are good at aiming your blinks you will often even not use the 2nd blink and just blink on top of them.
---
*Gotta pop dem gens!*
---
No idea. I know the dropped item change is probably to make it a "Soft counter" to Franklin's.
---
When you play by yourself you see it from a less bias perspective. Swf is what makes most killers bad and it gets people to play more so you can't touch it.
---
Sounds like the game just glitched out. You just equip the offering and you‚Äôll spawn as that killer. You won‚Äôt have any add ons or perks tho.
---
Yes, there is a free track and a paid track.
---
Because skins like that are nice for players who don‚Äôt mind to put a little more money into a game they enjoy playing?? Believe it or not, its nice having a somewhat exclusive skin. I am not a fan of battlepasses either, but it is not the worst thing they can do to the game.
---
I miss the Switch to killer/survivor button on the lobby... Really unnecessary change
---
As long as you are fairly good at chases and can get a couple pallet stuns its maxed for sure. Not to even mention totems and such
---
Micheal's hospital gown doesn't have a backside and hears someone else breathing heavy...
---
Seriously the nobody meme became fucking stupid the moment everyone started using it for the opposite effect: by putting prompts in the meme. It's meant to be showing something that just seems to happen out of nowhere, but by adding in any form of prompt, the meme is dead. It's honestly stupid, and in no way funny, it adds nothing to the joke.
---
I have no clue what that is. Is that person? This is a video my friend sent me from a game we played last night.
---
Franklin‚Äôs exists :P
---
Well shit. They actually made the archive pass fair...
---
NGL I didn't expect that.
---
Props to BHVR, thought they'd try to roll us... like many other companies do nowadays.
---
Omg, please teach me your ways xD
---
Bloodpoints and Emblem system are not tied to each other. They are separate, with separate scoring events that contribute differently.
---
And skins bring absolutely no tactical advantage and are purely cosmetic. People seem to forget that.
---
Off to hang myself.
---
i'm the friend, and he just wants to have bhvr try to fix some of the issue's with the game rather than adding new things witch don't really do mutch besides give you a shiny thing.
---
i  myself don't have any problems with cosmetics but still i'd rather like to see some bug fixes
---
No, she's still slower than survivors. There are add ons that make her faster but they have their own restrictions.
---
I remember him mentioning this so I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs pretty stoked, as am I!
---
This is amazing.  I laughed out loud a couple times
---
Trans Rights are human rights. Don‚Äôt be a jerk
---
No, it's not the worst thing but why already have a shop that's not bad and add something in my mind completly useless like a battlepass
---
He just vibing bro
---
Yup, me especially.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
So you're not gonna play her anymore because you now have to wait 3 seconds before you can phase through all obstacles?
---
all you myers foot fetishists out there..... this one‚Äôs for you

No it isn't. Go find the gameplay and link it then.
---
When are these gonna come out?
---
Demos good if you already know where it is, but you can't see shit while teleporting so if you don't know where it is yet he's not as good as billy/spirit/nurse imo.
---
&gt;Did you just not play when Ash came out? 
---
I did, though that's not what we're talking about. We're talking about the PTB version that triggered on safe unhooks instead of basic attacks. 
---
&gt;It's not a dead hard. You ignore a hit, get a speed boost to get you to the next safe loop, and get 3 hits in a chase 
---
You might want to read what Dead Hard does.
---
&gt;It had no real downside. 
---
Other than not being manual, it *only* had downsides compared to Dead Hard.
---
&gt;If the unhook adding stacks was fine then they probably would have added it in when they did the rework. Their testing clearly showed it was still too good.
---
Yep. Totally. Just like their "testing" showed Freddy was too good when he got his nerfs. They didn't keep the change because it didn't stop bad killers from whining about it, not because the perk was actually strong. When bad players start leaving negative feedback in mass like that, BHVR doesn't test for what makes something balanced, they test for what makes people shut up and stop hurting sales.

what do you mean

---
DBD: **‚ÄúYO DID YOU KNOW THE KILLER HAS TINKERER AND HE‚ÄôS COMIN‚Äô FOR YOU???‚Äù**
---
Exactly, Danny "Jed Olsen" Johnson is an original character that uses the Ghostface identity.
---
Not really, if one surv brings Up the Ante + Salty Lips, it gives all survivor 15% of unhook each attempt, which is 40% across all three attempts.
---
If you bring Slippery Meat with that, it jumps to 63% chance to escape over the 6 attempts. And that‚Äôs for only one survivor bringing these perks.
---
If all survivors brings Salty Lips + Up the Ante (as a SFW for example), it‚Äôs a whopping 52% to escape on each attempt, which is 89% over three attempts and a 99% percent chance over 6 attempts
---
I don‚Äôt quite follow with the new Undetectable changes, how does this actually change anything for The Pig?
---
yesss
---
No, no progression from ptb carries over to live servers.
---
Fucks sake that was quick
---
After missed Ambush Attack, Amanda now suffers a fatigue and her visibility is greatly reduced (similar to Nurse's fatigue)
---
Yes, and it is satisfying af.
---
Ahh good old Wilfred

Let me guess nurse skin is paid
---
No I'm saying having the animation to advertise is with is not a good reason to keep moris. Like I said they could just let you more the last guy as a reward for getting 4 kills instead of letting you kill people early.
---
For starters, make it so that survivors than are affected by the Clown's gas can only slow vault. That makes him alot more dangerous at loops. The fact that you can currently throw down a pallet and slide 10 times over it even while you are in the gas cloud is stupid
---
Billy, LF, Huntress, Doctor
---
I don‚Äôt think any killer perks need to be changed aside from obvious meme perks like Insidious or Monsterous Shrine.
---
Skins of the battle pass will be available in the shop later, so that‚Äôs one less argument here.
---
A battlepass is good, it brings more value for less money than what we have right now, and doesn‚Äôt impact gameplay.

I'm going to go back to maining Laurie. I hope there's a bandaged head cosmetic for Myers. That would be perfect.
---
I just played Doc for a daily. I‚Äôm rank 13 and my Doc is only lvl 2 so I didn‚Äôt put on perks since my daily was just to shock 4 survivors. I proceeded to hook everyone twice and then slug so they could do gens and get heal points, chased them but never downed them again and NO ONE HEALED EACH OTHER. The 2 I slugged and walked away but they bled out. Then I decided to just find the hatch and let one live. Found the hatch, downed one and bled out. The remaining Meg kept running from me so I knocked her and walked her to the hatch and let her wiggle free. She ran away. So I closed the hatch and sat in a corner for the EGC as she hid somewhere and never opened a gate and died. They all probably think I was playing like a dick even though I was actually just trying to get everyone BP

If they rework his addons he gets two, they want to standardize it

DBDs monetization is not godawful lol. I've said it many times before in other games and I'll say it again.

BHVR needs to pay its employees. They need money for server upkeep. They need money to keep pumping out content or getting more licensed characters.

If you don't have the money, they offer a way for you to obtain characters for free via shards. You can't expect the game to last just by players buying the game without a form of further income. 
---
They could've made the game p2w and lock stronger perks behind legitimate paywalls, or taken the subscription path like MMOs like FFXIV. Instead they're profiting from OPTIONAL in game skins that don't affect the base game whatsoever. 
---
Honestly it's pretty entitled for players to complain about having to buy things that you don't actually need to play. What, you expect devs to keep making content and give it to you for free? You're making a one time purchase for the game + DLCs and you expect that money to fund the game forever?
---
Certified bruh moment
---
Eh idk man nurse will for sure be a bit more balanced but spirit has counter play and can be mindgames at loops... nurse doesn't.
---
As an editor, I feel that üòî‚úåÔ∏è
---
They‚Äôve been a thing longer then that. Maybe around that time was when they started picking up
---
Laurie's face looks different, more akin to Jamie Lee Curtis... Are they reworking her along with Quentin?
---
Loving all the dbd memes lately
---
They are not the same team at all. Maybe you are not experienced in this, but video game developers have specialties. For the battlepass, it is the creative team and User Interface team, not balance team nor gameplay, netcode, or bug fixing team. 
---
They are working on the various bugs and dedicated server, but it is another team.
---
And honestly, bugs are not much of an issue right now, yeah hitboxes can be weird sometimes, but it is most of the time because the survivor‚Äôs been greedy, and would have hit anyway. And dedicated servers are coming, it takes time.
---
So is camping... Tadaaa
---
Maybe a pallet medium should be a thing for gassed survivors.
---
Most games with a battle pass system do this, thankfully. I'm glad that BHVR was no different.
---
&gt;The pass costs 1k auric cells and you get 1k cells back if you complete the pass, so if you keep playing you can get future passes even tho you've only paid for one.
---
Seems pretty nutty, tons of value.
---
They said Mori‚Äôs are gonna get looked at separately.
---
Everyone gets awesome new skins, then there's Meg and Billy who get recolors lmao.
---
And who is the hospital gown for? Laurie?
---
She wont be detected by aura reading perks while crouched. Then it's just a QoL change that tells you your terror radius and stain are gone
---
That‚Äôs exactly that. The guy is pissed at absolutely nothing. They would have named it other than battle pass or season pass and he would have been fine with it.
---
The basement camping and tunneling wasn't?
---
Alright kiddo. Time for bed.
---
And face camping someone is toxic af, it‚Äôs just an eye for an eye.
---
I guess you could do all 4 members of Legion blighted differently to make them all unique and cool but I mean that takes a lot of effort.
---
I can start one if people really love this stuff
---
Dead Hard is a 3 meter dash. MoM moves you like 20. It's clear you just want to have it the overpowered perk back so I'll drop the conversation since nobody will change their mind. Until they change the effect it needs to stay bad since it so gamechanging.
---
Yes but I normally bring Franklins when I see a survivor with a key in my lobby. *angry survivor downvotes incoming*
---
Nothing, make prayer beads ultra rare
---
Yesssssss another pig skin
---
R/Woooosh
---
When is hallowed blight event?
---
It's the reason BHVR are keeping them. At least, the best reason I can think for why they keep them. And it is a good reason from a marketing standpoint. That's all I'm saying here, that they keep them for marketing reasons.
---
Who even are you and what on earth are you talking about
---
Xbox, but I haven't had this problem up until recently
---
Fair play, as long as you dont have tunnel vision like the killer I just went against. Pisses me off.
---
Confirm this RN
---
Nope, thats a legit playing strategy
---
Only Myers tier one can beat Spine Chill. 
---
Others (Ghostface, Wraith to name a few) can‚Äôt trump it.
---
dude this is awesome
---
I've always wondered how people like playing nurse. It was so annoying to me having your character constantly look down lol
---
This is what I always thought. It should work like WGLF.
---
How do you guys feel about Styptic Agent? I feel like its gotten more powerful
---
https://youtu.be/xhMwi7mFa7g
---
Thanks! Yeah, console doesn't get to customize as much unfortunately.
---
Oh, what a suuuurprise..
---
Time out, Legion is definitely at least an A, especially Susie and Joey. Have you seen them? They‚Äôre babies, adorable. You just want to pinch their cheeks and carry them around in your pockets and give them cuddles, and when they get 4ks you want to tell them what a great job they did, and when they get gen-rushed you want to tell them it‚Äôs okay and buy them ice cream.
---
Ok, but right now in PTB they can, I wanna know if it's a bug or a feature.
---
Did this Demogorgon just dab on me?
---
Its in the premium track of the Rift. So you gotta cough up that dough.
---
Revert prayer beads back to what they did before, reduce the sounds radius while she‚Äôs phasing so she can get closer to survivor before they hear her coming. I don‚Äôt get why they buffed it so much.
---
What a cute comic, I love it!
---
It‚Äôs not that bad.
---
I don‚Äôt have every character unlocked and haven‚Äôt had a chance to look into the new battle pass system, but will I be affected with challenges that require DLC killers/survivors? Like are there challenges that need certain characters?
---
I still jump because of how high I have the volume on to hear the footsteps and heartbeat and whatnot. Hearing that quiet theme as survivor with almost complete silence just to suddenly have her pop out of the ground, screaming and jerking my camera away from where I was looking never fails to make me jump, and piss me off.
---
Oh yeah my bad 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/
---
I hadn‚Äôt read this part of the PTB, apparently now Wraith, Pig And Ghostface will be granted the same status as Tier 1 Myers
---
I always get salt, even from those who I literally grant an escape because their team was bad or toxic. 
---
That is why I have made my mission to always encourage baby killers to not feel bad and counter cunty reactions from fellow survivors.
---
People need to stop antagonizing the person behind the killer they played against. That is a person whose heart you are crushing. Just don't.
---
On paper maybe not, but them 3 seconds per blink is going to add up and that's going to hurt the most. Time is he killers health bar
---
I was in the same boat as  you when they announced it. But after looking at it, its really fairly priced and has way more things than you would expect in it. On top of that, if you grind, you get your money back as well.  
---
The archives actually add good stuff as well and should help with the bloodpoint grind. They put daily challenges to shame tbh.
---
I knew he skipped leg day
---
So they made Spine chill a dead perk, what a great idea!
---
*Sweats seeing the new David King tank top even though I've seen him shirtless 500 times already*
---
If you're a toxic coward, yeah.
---
The demogorgon is spreading to the other killers
---
Everyone gets some free Auric Cells on the PTB to test it out. They do not transfer back to live.
---
Spooky Legion? Yes please
---
Wait what?
---
My argument is, if they just nerfed the add ons (in the right way, not this joke that they call rework) I would be fine with it but they also made a charge time that wasn't needed at all
---
You know what would've been a good Nerf? Delete Omega blink, make her fatigue a bit longer. That's it, that was what she needed. But they just went wild and made her add ons be additional nerfs, but more BP!!!1!11!! And make her base kit worse. You make 2 blinks, 6s cool down while they outrun you and disappear..
---
Show me your vibing license. Immediently.
---
at school and the forums are blocked what it say?
---
How am I a coward, I am not running away
---
You're joking, and it's not funny
---
Wait, so it's slower if you have more people? The loading tip literally says that actions are performed faster if performed cooperatively. So is that a blatant lie, as you get slowed down for working cooperatively?
---
I heard hes getting some pretty good cosmetics in the archives
---
i don't believe any cosmetic can be bloodied from prestige. prestige items are their own cosmetic.
---
You are an amazing toxic dweet
---
Shut it nerd
---
First game I ever played was a custom match... my friend went hag and I had like 80 million heart attacks that game... still hate her.
---
Yeah, I know that's more of a pipe dream than anything. And I know the licenses are different, but it's not exactly a one-or-the-other scenario.
---
its also locked until its live and it is a ptb so things could change I really doubt it will be like that on release but we will see
---
But it can be used while broken meaning you can use it vs plague, Legion on serten builds, billy and bubba cant just chainsaw you, use it aggensed NOED, with no mither (thats stretching it thoe). Sure you cant heal a healthstate so for selfless uses, it got a nerf but for selfish uses.. Its stronger then ever as it has no counterplay, now.
---
And pointing at someone makes them angry, and when you‚Äôre angry you mess up. So sure, facecamping is a legitimate strategy - but so is pointing.
---
These cosmetics confirm to me that they still only have the rights to the original film and none of the sequels
---
Yeah but no one was complaining about ‚Äúaverage nurses‚Äù, they were complaining about the good ones.
---
There are so many other killers for the average person to play and have success with, those that love Nurse and will master her will still be good, they just won‚Äôt be unbeatable.
---
right, and never mind the fact that NOED exists because most killers have little chance of preventing then gens from getting done at decent ranks.
---
im just going to hope that it is just like that on ptb after all they can change that at anytime
---
man for some reason I thought it started the 10th. now I‚Äôm unfairly disappointed lmao.
---
When the cooldowns longer then the ram
---
Legion would probably cook ramen noodles
---
Who else is hyped for all the sick new cosmetics, BHVR nailed it this time!
---
My comment is literaly a copypasta. Look up "Alex19 isnt so great"
---
Demogorgon IS good boy he deserves More Ryan that
---
See? The toxic survivor mentality
---
Cool cool. As someone who‚Äôs always ran one of those two perks, I always poss myself when I discover its Myers. 
---
A 0 terror radius Myers would be nice, not needing M&amp;A as a required slot (at least for scratched mirror) would be nice.
---
use Screencap or don't post its nearly impossible to see on screen
---
I've been rank 1 at both sides and I'm an alright killer and meh survivor
---
Is the one on the very left the Myers cosmetic? I can't see it that well
---
Holy shit a Myers cosmetic. Now if only they could give us the Halloween 2018 mask but i'm glad to get even anything from them.
---
In that case pointing is a good way to rile up and sike out a killer, get in their head and make them overthink or focus on you to help other survivors do gens.
---
That's an odd way to spell Hag imo.
---
TL;DR
---
Putrid Serum, instead of being obtained from draining Cankers or hooking Survivors on special hooks, can only be obtained via the free version of the Rift. There will also be special challenges in the Tome to unlock new Withering Blight related lore.
---
The event will start on October 22nd and ends November 1st. This also means the Archives will either be on the live servers on the 22nd or sometime before then.
---
You are.
---
I see this as a great opportunity for murder
---
I did it on purpose to obscure names.  Point is, I tried and it didn't count.
---
topless Michael
---
Gotcha. Well if that‚Äôs the case (being supernatural) then I could fully understand him being completely full of evil and acting that way, because his behavior is very alien to me/very different from a normal human being.
---
As a baby Dwight, this was inspirational.
---
nea but with good hair
---
I think you misunderstood what my comment was. Here: https://youtu.be/HbRi-pZ2lb0
---
I‚Äôm so happy right now, Legion is finally getting a skin that isn‚Äôt for Joey üò≠
---
Everyone downvoting me are toxic swf groups
---
Only going to respond to the battle pass part of your post. 
---
The battle pass should only take an hour a day to grind out completely. And guess what? If you don't like the battle pass, that's great news cause that means you don't have to buy it! If all you want is the nurse skin, itll be available in about 6 months in the shop. That's awesome. I don't know of any other pass that lets you get the cosmetics after it's over. The battle pass just lets you get what you want cheaper and earlier in exchange for a grind. Sounds really really fair to me. I'm very impressed with BHVR. They listened to our concerns and made this as fair as possible while still giving themselves a way to pay their employees
---
When r they getting released?
---
Holy fuck! This game just keeps getting better and better, literally everything coming out since Ghostface is just making me love it more and more, between him, Stranger Things, the Archives, now these cosmetics. They're just on a roll.
---
This does seem to confirm to me that the devs still only have the rights to the original Halloween film and none of the sequels, though I'm just happy to get any cosmetics at all. I can't imagine Michael walking around in that though lmao.
---
Literally every player was crying that this game didn't have dedicated servers yet
---
One, if not the best, post I've seen here. Good job mate
---
‚Ä¢ Event: 22 Oct - 1 Nov
---
‚Ä¢ Bringing back the offerings and items from previous hallowed blight event
---
‚Ä¢ Serum/putrid cosmetic
---
Understandable why it feels unfair, but in my experience, the main problem with Iri Heads is when people bring Infantry Belt along so now they can carry 3 ranged instadowns. If its just one, you can potentially juke her, make her miss, and then she either has to continue the chase as a 110% killer without her ability, or drop it to restock, giving you time to get away and hide. 
---
If its 3, she can fuck up twice and not get punished for it, and she is also gonna be more likely to spam instadown hatchets at every opportunity (BBQ procs, she sees a survivor across the map, she might hesitate to go for the shot if she only has 1 hatchet, but she'll probs go for it if she has 3). 
---
IMO not allowing her to pick a 2nd addon if she has Iri Heads as her 1st will make it significantly more balanced. It will still be very strong, but if she can't combine it with any of her other addons, it will be significantly harder to use. You get a single hatchet, and you gotta make it count. High risk, high reward.
---
No it is still faster, just not as efficient. 1 survivor takes 80 seconds to complete a gen, so you would expect 2 survivors would take 40 seconds. But there's a ~10% penalty for 2 survivors, which means it takes ~44 seconds to complete a generator with 2 survivors
---
Cuz you're scared they'll get away 
---
Coward
---
I've been doing it only once Ruin goes down, seems to balance out gen speed after that.
---
Video games are fucking expensive to make. I am honestly shocked at how cheap the DLC for this game is. You have no obligation to buy any of it, plus, you can still use 80 percent of the content added in DLCs for free. You can get all 6 perks through the shrine, and you can still play the new map, and play against the new killer or survivor. The only thing you're really paying for is to play as the new killer, since survivors are basically all the same.
---
Like, you can buy two drinks from starbucks, or buy Freddy fucking Kreuger.
---
Yeah, that's the reason why.
---
Somebody stuck at rank 20 im at 5 haevnt seen any campers
---
You're not alone buddy.
---
But hey, we got a new "stealthy" mask.
---
&gt; The event will start on October 22nd and ends November 1st
---
Damn, I really thought it would start earlier. :/
---
I'd like a floral mint recolour of Hag's red dress in the rift, as a slight nod to her mint rag description
---
Chill dude, just an opinion. You have yours, I have mine.
---
awful idea. Might as well just slug everyone and leave them to bleed out on the ground instead of hooking then.
---
Territorial imperative? Both Thana and fire up are still underwhelming. I'm all ears is nothing special, the two perks mentioned by you, Predator is still garbage. There's plenty.
---
We are happy to celebrate the most horrific time of the year, where the stench of rotting Pustula Plants fills the air across the Entity‚Äôs realm. Soon, the Withering Blight event will be upon us, and we don‚Äôt want you to go unprepared. 
---
**CLASSICS TRICKS**
---
In addition to spooky campfire decorations, some staples of past Halloween events have returned, including: 
---
* The Will O' Wisp flashlight 
---
* The All Hallows' Eve Lunchbox 
---
* The Pustula Petals offering 
---
You can find these limited time items scattered throughout newly generated Bloodwebs and in chests for the duration of the event. You will keep any leftover items and be able to use them year round, but be warned: Any unused Pustula Petals will stay in your inventory, but will not be useable after the event period. 
---
Following feedback from the Hallowed Blight event last year, Pustula Petals will instead create a pair of event Hooks and Generators for each Offering used. Survivors who burn one of these Offerings will receive bonus Bloodpoints whenever an event Generator is powered, and Killers receive a bonus each time a Survivor is hooked on a special event Hook. If you don‚Äôt burn an Offering, you‚Äôll still receive some bonus Bloodpoints, but not as many as those who do. 
---
**BRAND NEW TREATS**
---
The Withering Blight event is woven into The Archives (for an overview of what The Archives hold, click here). By completing challenges and progressing through the current Rift, you‚Äôll be rewarded with Putrid Serum. These Putrid Serum can then be exchanged for cosmetics from either the Hallowed Blight or Hallowed Catalyst collections. 
---
Putrid Serum is only available in the free track of The Rift. A total of 60 Putrid Serum are available this year, allowing you to earn up to 6 Hallowed cosmetics (or two full outfits). 
---
**SCARY STORIES**
---
What‚Äôs a Halloween event without a spooky tale? Complete specially marked nodes in the first Tome to unlock new lore continuing from last year‚Äôs Hallowed Blight event (for an overview of last year‚Äôs stories, click here). Collect all Memory Entries to unlock a special animatic, revealing the next steps in the story. As with any other lore in The Archives, you will be able to collect and complete the story any time, even after The Rift closes. 
---
The Withering Blight event runs from October 22nd - November 1st. Act fast, the Pustula Plants only appear once a year and when they‚Äôre gone, they‚Äôre gone.
---
It was about 2 months before MoM got nerfed.
---
Yes, the recolors are from premium section of the progression bar.
---
Maybe some classic Freddy skins
---
I hope we get some Christmas sweaters for licensed survivors this year
---
They were already recently. Pretty much daily
---
Thanks for the clear response. The way the tip is worded, it sounded like 2 survivors should be able to do a gen in less than 40 seconds. Now that I know that, I'm less inclined to be on the same gen as other players...
---
unless I read this wrong look at this https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93854/news-withering-blight-event-overview#latest
---
Although, given the existence of some of the stuff from the beta (Furtive Chase being Simple Formula, I‚Äôm All Ears being Slasher Senses, and the Mori using a cellphone instead of a camera), as well as the existing blade wipe animation, it seems like they really wanted the Scream license.
---
the Miner is the official Chinese name for Prospector before the changed it. And also there‚Äôs gonna be a supposedly new map based on Prospector‚Äôs storyline, Named ‚Äòthe Golden Cave‚Äô (idk if they‚Äôll change it)
---
except is Myers going to be vulnerable to Spine Chill in tier 1 now?
---
And they could still keep his spine chill immunity on top of undetectable. I haven't seen confirmation they're taking it away.
---
eh go fuck yourself bitch.
---
More horror oriented cosmetics and less cute/silly stuff.
---
Please keep on doing this
---
They don‚Äôt get anything for that though. And theres tenacity and unbreakable
---
Bro i always think the little shit floating in the air when I play Freddy is a survivor. It makes it so hard to spot pple from a distance.
---
I think people vastly underestimate how much of an effect the cooldown has on blink timings. It starts at the beginning of fatigue so you'll almost always have 1 blink recharged by the time fatigue ends, and from there it's only another 3 seconds to the next blink. 
---
Thats definitely not losing much map pressure. It's just a slight change to prevent survivor frustrations of being instantly caught without any time to react. The time to recharge your blink still even goes up while charging it, which takes about 1 second. So in practice you only have a 2 second cooldown between blinks.
---
Please remember to give them pats.
---
It was just a joke lol and it's like... an indirect slight buff that does almost nothing if I'm right? Sooooo still not what people are looking for lol
---
I think no, but im not sure if the progress of your rift will restart
---
Oh, well that definitely makes things different. I was under the assumption that these were original lore killers. Iyo, how was the reboot movie? I never saw it because just didn't have the time.
---
Okay you know what? I'm gonna reply like a survivor main back then when infinities were a thing since you're too triggered to have a normal conversation:
---
Adapt!
---
&gt;So in practice you only have a 2 second cooldown between blinks.
---
Which is a huge nerf to her.  
---
This won't make her "trash tier" or something, but going from "no cooldown at all" to "arround 2 seconds'ish" is big.  
---
Especially if you use like 30-50 blinks per game. It adds up.
---
From what I've read, it wasn't originally created as one, but people have adopted the acronym provided above due to how accurately &amp; easily it explains the term.
---
Why don‚Äôt they let progress transfer over? Do you know?
---
Nurse has never been as outstanding on console as she is on pc
---
That's pretty neat, nicely done. Still don't know why I got downvoted though. XD
---
Oh awesome! He needed that so much! This‚Äôll make him an S tier killer. I wonder if the Demogorgon will get Surveillance Camera ü§î
---
It does help at least a bit, and people also overreact about all the pig nerfs anyway
---
She can be good, yeah, but not better than a good Spirit, Billy, or Freddy.
---
For me one moment that brings tension is trying tk both ibserve my surroundings and focus on checks. While on the hook id like to feel it as well. No struggle would just make it feel worse.
---
Not at all; it‚Äôs a legitimate tactic.
---
Nah.
---
Imagine getting hit with a pallet as you watch the Claudette fucking nae nae as you get up
---
I‚Äôm really excited for the lore; the world of DBD has always really fascinated me
---
running balanced landing on david may be clever, but the actual big brains are those who use unbreakable with no ds on laurie
---
Yea, and just make them not able to see the aura of boxes until the trap is on, maybe not even able to interact with them. Maybe they can also only see the aura of a single box at a time
---
I am honestly so happy seeing that Laurie Skin with the skirt with the more movie-accurate hair (Which I will be using on all her sets. Sorry Kate, back to maining Laurie)
---
Yeah I only heard that on reddit, I tend to ignore stuff on Reddit like that because its usually just Pure Over-speculation. Like I always say, best to wait for Leaks by Daylight or the Devs to make an official statement!
---
I'm not familiar with ghostface or his mythos. What's the difference between his original outfit and the one he has ingame now?
---
I honestly dont even play pig. It's just a common meme I thought it would be funny to reference.
---
I think you are looking a bit too deep into this whole thing lol
---
I think its hard to say as a survivor because there isnt much we have the ability to do. Most I've done is ask the killer to hook me if they've played well but everyone escaped
---
I think the gown is the closest thing we'll get to a Shirtless Myers skin.
---
Sauce?
---
So, I was just being sarcastic, but you being uplifting is by far the most wholesome I've seen all day, thank you &lt;3
---
Nurse is nerfed. There is no  way to say shes not nerfed. However, its just a matter of time to see how big the nerfs acaullty are to her.
---
Praobly am
---
HOLY SHIT
---
It definitely has an effect but it's nowhere near a "huge nerf" or "lose all your map pressure."  
---
I was probably wrong in calling it a "slight change" but I don't think Nurse will be going anywhere Meta wise with these changes.
---
I don't think I've seen a lot of toxicity at all. Personally I've had mostly great experiences with the community. Really just the people who DC.
---
The joke is that the first one is the actual wrong amd the secomd is tje actual right
---
So reworking is a bad thing and we should not have a rework to these character
---
Legion's model is from Deathgarden???
---
Nothing too wholesome.. honestly I just don‚Äôt tbag, I run out the gates instead of waiting there. If I know I‚Äôm gonna get caught I stop and just let the killer hit me. I just try my best to not be a dick lol
---
Honestly this post was too good a shitpost for reddit.
---
Honestly, my the most wholesome thing a survivor can do if I had a shit game is just leave, no teabagging at the gate, I don't need you to give me a free hit, just leave so I can regroup and figure out how I just fucked up üòÇ
---
i got downvoted by ppl saying they are wrong lol
---
(S)he probably refers to the spelling of her name, The HuntRESS. Her name already tells you she's a woman.
---
If a killer is actually going to get upset because they got pointed at...? Maybe they need to take a break from the game
---
I was referencing to the pricing of the added cosmetics. The DLC is indeed quite cheap.
---
Being able to see one box at a time seems a bit much. But I agree with the rest. Granted this would all have to be tested first.
---
Look at this billy boi with NINE UNCOMMONS WHAT THE HELL DBD
---
Now the eternal dilemma after the first totem, should I go ahead and cleanse the second one or save it for healing later.
---
Do you play killer? I find at least once a game I get a survivor who teabags at every pallet drop, flashlight clicks at exit, all that kinda stuff. Very frustrating when playing off meta killers.
---
Off*
---
How about Fairy Godmother's Holding Out for a Hero? ;)
---
hmm yeah that is true. its honestly the only map i have trouble with finding totems on.
---
Then heal the person off the hook if there is time, it would take less time than running off and taking longer to heal them
---
Just make speed limiter and long guide bar common addons and add-ons and add from there
---
See and thats not even very wholesome, I just feel like survivors cant really be outwardly polite to the killer but mainly they can do it for other survivors. Survivor on survivor toxicity is a whole other topic though lol.
---
You‚Äôre talking to me like I‚Äôve ever held this opinions, I literally already said in this thread gens need a rework. I think even in its current state DS is too strong. And the same goes for what infinite‚Äôs are left, I literally don‚Äôt know who the fuck you think you‚Äôre talking to but you don‚Äôt know me bro, but keep making these assumptions, I‚Äôm literally arguing that there‚Äôs problems on both sides that need to be fixed, spirits kit and add one just happened to be part of that, but you‚Äôre too stupid to pick up what I‚Äôm putting down
---
She should‚Äôve been nerfed instead of Nurse change my mind
---
I hope so, Pig could for sure use the buff but Spine Chill is one of my favorite off-meta perks and it's already pretty mediocre so I hope it doesn't get any weaker.
---
Dev confirmed that spine chill will work! False alarm.
---
Booo hooo Nurse is having a slight cooldown now we will take more 0.423 seconds to down someone
---
To be fair, most people aren't exactly gonna put their toxic moments in the video (except for some..)
---
ELI5 how Spirit is top tier?
---
saying for the third time. I did not deny that she is nerfed. Please stop repeating it. All streamers I watch and the majority in their as well as me and one of my friends who mains nurse all say that she is still undoubtable #1 Killer
---
Do you get the serum if you buy the premium pass?
---
So teachable add ons are a thing now?
---
this is happening to me constantly and I'm only purple rank. if I loop for a decent amount of time, I'm immediately tunneled and camped.
---
You cant buy it with serum
---
The tension that doesn't exist currently?
---
That Day of the Dead Jane skin is kinda dumb tbh, way to theme-y in my opinion
---
That is fair, but setting a good example is also a good thing
---
And the items will still be available, albeit six months after each pass has finished.
---
I want my bunny feng ! -,-#
---
Nah I think now she just holds her traps during all her idle lobby animations though
---
She basically moved at her normal speed and the entire map heard you whooshing when using your power
---
Nurse doesnt play dbd she plays nurse. she ignores all game mechanics. And she still does not tbh shes just less effective thankfully
---
Another great perk murdered by devs... what the fuckkk
---
I mean, they axed nurse in the same patch and you still want more?
---
Even more helpless? You say that like killers are significantly better
---
Why are SOME LOW RANK Ghostface players so campy, sweaty, and toxic?
---
FTFY
---
I mean that's kinda what the first hook is.
---
I just don't look around when struggling, Whats the point anyway?
---
Nah, it‚Äôs Myers when he breaks out of Smith‚Äôs Grove at the start of the original.
---
Wait does this mean either Quick and Quiet or this perk counters the other?
---
I personally hate that one, like why would you where that trying to survive against a bunch of killers?
---
Yo cant wait for season 2 its coming out 2020 cant wait
---
I feel this way with Cannibal üòê
---
Or just remove her prayer beads addon, problem solved.
---
That's probably for the best. You should stay out of balance discussions until you've played both sides.
---
it is an event skin though??? weird
---
Thats literally what my original point was.. don‚Äôt fucking self-care/medkit heal right as I unhook you. This isn‚Äôt a hard concept to understand.
---
you made the most biased comment about the division of opinions I've seen in my life
---
I'm Mexican so I can't help but to love it I guess
---
They will be released into the normal shrine after 6 months of the rift release, it says it right there.
---
This comment sounds oddly biased lol
---
Respectable.
---
I didn‚Äôt know being that God damned cheeky was even a part of this game.
---
I don't think he agreed to the name they gave him.
---
Ghostface is fun as hell and quite versatile tbh. Loved him instantly
---
You can‚Äôt see auras in phasing, you can see it while walking and then phase over tho
---
Well that wouldn‚Äôt be very cash money of her
---
Sorry for no good grammar
---
I don't think you can use it to self heal from being downed, it was probably about someone else running up to you to heal with addon.
---
FUCK! I'm a solo survivor and I honestly rely on this perk since my team can't inform me what the killers doing.
---
BHVR is just fucking solo survivors with these changes.
---
It still gets me. I hate the frickin hag and her traps üòë
---
I wouldn't mind one or two more boldness sources, it's very feast or famine for me and in games where I don't hit 8K boldness I usually barely get a thousand points just from being in the terror radius. Also getting 8K boldness pts usually means getting chased most of the game and not getting any objective points, and vice versa for safe games where you just do gens the whole time and get no boldness BP, so some changes to even that out would be nice.
---
It‚Äôs all good
---
Give him the ability to teleport to the top of the basement stairs, but only if nobody is in the basement.
---
Replace basement stairs with hooks, if it's too weak.
---
Replace hooks with the survivors, if it's too weak.
---
Replace survivors with "Tele grab survivor off gens and telehook them into the shadow realm" if too weak.
---
thank you for stolen the image from my post on leaksbydaylight without mentioning the source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/df2akj/new\_skins\_for\_myers\_laurie\_strode\_nancy\_steve/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/df2akj/new_skins_for_myers_laurie_strode_nancy_steve/)
---
I could run you any given day guaranteed. You're just a typical nobody on reddit who will protect the integrity of this game with your life. A true white knight.
---
I wouldn't think so, lockers block bbq&amp;chill, and survivors aura reading (bond, empathy)
---
Well hello there Evan papi.
---
Actually Ghostface doesn't have a Blight skin either, and he's arguably BHVR's creation, just the mask is licensed, so technically he could have a Blight skin, just probably not a mask.
---
Yeah sure
---
I do but not often. Yeah I get it.
---
Negative, lockers block all aura readings
---
That's so odd! She definitely didn't have tracks leading her to me, and definitely didn't see me go in (knocked someone else near  me). Maybe good intuition!
---
fun thing: i did that with the plague and i actually hat a merciless, but achievements were bugged so... yeah. here i am.
---
Feels so good when they rely on it but it gets cleansed right before they hit someone or doesn‚Äôt spawn at all
---
Can you make the pic smaller? I can still tell which character's which.
---
What's this KEKW bullshit?
---
they definitely didn't do enough for all of reddit to be complaining about it tbh
---
I mean maybe but the devs straight up confirmed a long time ago that the deal they made was only for the first one so they‚Äôd have to alter/make new agreements
---
That's exactly the problem I'm talking about. Like the guy above said, an overall adjustment to the game is needed. Right now, survivors finishing gens is absurdly fast, and it makes Ruin feel mandatory. The top three killers at the moment are able to deal with it while most killers struggle.
---
The problem is that if we overall Nerf survivors with the current state of the game, those top three killers would become oppressive. So, adjusting them first with the full intent of shifting the game away from survivors afterward.
---
I see, must've had good intuition then!
---
Baby dweets are growing up and it making my eyes tear up
---
Write the source! @r/leaksbydaylight

Did someone have a bad time with nurse?
---
PRETTY LADY LEATHERFACE OR WE RIOT
---
Im a simple man, I see Otz, I upvote
---
They're probably just mad that they couldn't get you when they wanted.
---
It shouldnt exsist to be honest, it completley negates half the killers abilities. whispers for killers shouldnt exsist either now tbh now the closing hatch system has been implemented
---
Just run OoO instead, unless killers T1 Myers ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt find it on there, actually I found this myself
---
Loving the attention to detail üëå
---
There are no perks that give you extra vault speed
---
I complain about this game regularly lmao you are just a moron who needs to find a different game.
---
You read the new patch?
---
The one in the picture up there is the original, it's basically just a cheap Halloween costume that the original Ghostface from Scream used to kill people called Father Dread. The current one still uses the costume mask but his outfit is a bloodproof rain coat and hood more suited to keeping blood off the clothes and is significantly better for killing and mobility. The major functional difference is that the original killer(s) were edgy horror movie fans who didn't know what the fuck they were doing except that they watched a lot of Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween and based their killing off of that and only ever killed one other person before the movies. The DBD Ghostface is an actual seasoned serial killer who's perfected the craft of murder so he wears a more appropriate outfit
---
Spine chill and resilience does
---
I'm feeling Bloater's vibes from this.
---
Believe me I abused my fair share of that busted perk. I didn't play a single game on ptb without having it proc as survivor. Try not to be so condescending if you want to have balance discussions in the future.
---
I truly want to believe that it's some sort of strategy...to ease my agitation lol. like maybe if you loop for this amount of time, I have to get rid of you just in case? idk, I just wish it didn't happen almost every game. if I was toxic and teabagging at every stun and loop, I would get it.
---
I wanted to suc out sum plant juice. That was my favorite element from last year.
---
Why? They aren't directional and terror radius is, it only helped a but against stealth killers since spine chill don't give direction, only that he is looking at you
---
You‚Äôre not the only one, I too think his power while strong is weak where it isn‚Äôt like The Hag who has negatives towards her counters. Maybe if it way to stop stalking is if you break line of site, and Ghostface was able to put up traps that cause the survivor to decrease will therefore making it harder to complete objectives and tasks and the only way to do get rid of decreased will is to complete them with other survivors therefore which makes Ghostface stalking more useful, then that could work.
---
Designing a killer to be "perfectly balanced"[give me a break, Nurse could win without perks, let alone addons] while addonless but broken as shit with addons in a game where everyone uses addons every match is completely daft and absurd.
---
I like the suggestions people have made for 2 hook requirements, but if red moris remain in their current state then they should be locked to a certain number of bloodwebs or prestiges so that they're much less plentiful. I also think having the ebony mori just be killing 2 survivors would be better.
---
Maybe. Its WAY too early to tell if shes going to be the best killer or not, which is my point. 
---
People need to stop saying shes shit or good until at lesat a few days passes, so nurse mains and such can adjust to her changes since nurse is extrelmly hard. Thats all im saying, we need to give it time
---
no they don't, the devs have said they do not affect vault speed and they only affect any action that includes holding m1
---
troll
---
If I'm a killer, I usually try to farm if someone DCs. If not that, I give the hatch to the last survivor. Unfortunately, some of them can't take the hint, and they disconnect when I try to carry them to the hatch.
---
I mean spine chill shouldn‚Äôt work against stealth killers, it literally takes away certain killers ‚Äúpowers‚Äù completely. It just went from being really good and in my opinion op, to what it should always have been.
---
Where devs said it?
---
The one he has rn in the game is pretty different from the original. The ingame one looks more like something wore by a ninja, while the original one is much more simpler and scarier.
---
Because it will be more expensive than the pass when it comes to the shop for just that one cosmetic.
---
I haven‚Äôt but I‚Äôm gonna guess, Tracer is Nurse, Sombra is Wraith, Junkrat is Trapper, Genji is Billy, Phara is Huntress, I can‚Äôt think of the others.
---
I think you mean now it's one missed blink and by the time the fatigue is over she has another blink, two with good add-ons.
---
Look my guy, I‚Äôm not saying hag isn‚Äôt fun boy if she‚Äôs kinda brain dead.
---
on stream
---
All Davids Have Dead Hard
---
If it was a legion their killer instinct will still show if you are in a locker though I believe.
---
Especially compared to killer where you're constantly given BP for chases starting/stopping and actions. 1k for a pallette stun is nice but many killers simply respect them too much to ever get stunned.
---
Oh, so maybe then?
---
Bruh you stole my IG clip
---
I don‚Äôt leave exit gates unless I‚Äôm sure all my teammates can make it out or can‚Äôt be saved. Or if I have a feeling of Bloodwarden incoming. But if you‚Äôre waiting just to wait you‚Äôre a dick
---
Bruh, you stole my edit.
---
If I run into the rare nice killer, I'll let him kill me in the basement 'cause teabagging a thank you would come across the wrong way. Also, I've literally gotten myself killed to get my teammates a win - unless I need to get out for a daily. XD

Agreed, plus it's not a good strategy. 2 minutes on the hook is enough time for the other 3 to get 3 - 4 gens done with the right items.
---
Why should plunderes not show opened chest, this could make people looking for the 3 garentied chest in game waste a lot of time if they don't realise someone opened one already
---
I mean it's same for the killers too, you can get 4k early and be punished for that on the higher ranks.
---
Passive Phasing is changed to being a usuable part of her power instead of something that just randomly happens. (Like how Fred has Snares/Pallets and a Teleport, Demo has Shred and Portals, etc...)
---
Spirit now sees blood trails while using Yamaoka's Haunting.
---
Spirit now goes through Survivor's Hitboxes instead of bumping into them when using Yamaoka's Haunting.
---
Grunts of pain from injured Survivors are no longer directional while Spirit's uses Yamaoka's Haunting.
---
Juniper Bonsai &amp; Dried Cherry Blossom are changed to accommodate Passive Phasing becoming a usable part of her power.
---
Father's Glasses are changed to accommodate Spirit normally seeing blood trails in Yamaoka's Haunting.
---
Prayer Beads Bracelet and Mother-Daughter Ring swap rarities.
---
Prayer Beads Bracelet gets Moderately decreases Yamaoka's Haunting power recovery.
---
Oh thank god, about time
---
Hahaha nurse nerfed
---
I can't wait for this event. I want Clown's outfit so badly.
---
Of course, and then I'll be mad and go back to playing hag for another 12 days.
---
Ive never cared about spine chill honestly, usually very scittish survivors run it and thus end up being easy win games anyway.
---
I guess my issue is with people who have trouble making coherent thoughts. I'm actually a pretty nice guy, just put some thought into what you say.
---
The op was acting like a petulant child, so I treated him as such. You came in to support him but seemed otherwise intelligent so I treated you with a degree of respect, until you descended into the same petulance as the op.
---
Those are all amazing skins. So much for saving my money
---
Maybe this means classic Freddy has more of a chance to become reality?
---
I believe I said have a good one. Take care!
---
We need the ghost face mask with the tongue out to perfect his cosmetics now

What are you even talking about...

Don‚Äôt act like your much better yourself

that's one hell of a myers buff, now i don't need to take monitor and abuse to be sneaky beaky.

Who's the red one and the last one

Just buff the survivors too i want to be invisible!
---
What are these? Costumes made for ants?

I loved it too, but it did have some unfortunate side effects. The event got in the way of people who just wanted to play the game normally, or for those who already finished it. People would also succ plants and then die ASAP just to make quick progress.

I totally hear you. I love Huntress and her design but I just can not play her well. I still instabought her Mama Bear cosmetic.
---
He's ok not the worst and really good on a 3 gen stray he has no control over his portals after he places them and shred is a hit or miss
---
There are two types of players that use it
---
New players who use it like: "if it lights up ever, run/hide"
---
experienced people who can use it similarly to what Killers with Whispers do and use it for efficiency
---
doubt it, Hillbilly still needs the addon rework, assuming Leatherface would be done during due to p much near identical addon set.
---
ah i see, thank you
---
You seem to have forgotten Kate's PTB hook scream
---
And nice survivors exist. I'm a rank 15 killer on ps4 and I couldn't find a Feng who was both working on gens and hiding perfectly. I pm'd them and asked them where their masterful hiding spot was, and I was just next to a pile of planks. The Feng congratulated me for my trap placement and we then went on our separate ways. I still find it weird to find friendly players on console
---
Honestly the only nerf I think they should give her is not letting her bump into survivors
---
You didn't actually, you just edited your post to include an actual argument after posting in order to make me look like a fool, nice one.
---
However, I must agree that this conversation has reached its end. Thank you for the entertainment and have a good one as well. :)
---
Is that part 4 myers where he's burned or part 1 when he escapes the asylum or Halloween 2018 asylum myers
---
So the SoS will be clogged with perks we might already have even more, just for the challenges? Ok, BHVR....
---
More money generating additions to the game including a fucking battle pass...but 3 1/4 years later we are still playing ONE mode.

A game that has the license to 3 of the most iconic horror monsters of the last 30 years and they cant come up with anything else to do with them.
---
"Its something we are thinking about/looking into" BHVR answer incoming.
---
I'm sorry peanits
---
Yeah, no, spirit is a desperate need of a nerf.
---
there should be a few more rewards on the free track, currently I think there are very few rewards on there. I understand why it‚Äôs very little though, it‚Äôs *free* stuff.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df587g/why_is_the_nurse_not_op_anymore/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Literally only ever happened to Freddy and no other killer
---
Returning player. I stopped playing shortly before clown got released
---
Also a recall add-on? Hmmm....
---
Why? You have to dodge 5+ regular ones anyway which is more than enough to down someone. Maybe I‚Äôm biased but I play plenty of survivor too and I don‚Äôt come across enough insta down huntresses to complain and when I do I just play to the best of my ability, it‚Äôs one game out of a ton that I‚Äôm going to play in my session.
---
Nurse: *Laughs in Wheeze*
---
HONK!
---
Lol dude, good luck playing like that against a half decent spirit, most people run whispers or bbq for a reason. And the issue isn't no counterplay, its the lack of good or effective counterplay. "Just run Iron Will 5head," isn't a good argument, and having to run a perk just because it might be a certain killer is dumb as hell. The only consistent mindgame is fast vaulting a window then slow vaulting back through, but in all reality, if you're at a dead zone or a shit loop (4-walls/t-l walls), you're fucked regardless of what you do. I do massively change my playstlye against spirit, same way i massively change it  against huntress or demo, with their ranged attacks requiring different pathing. But in the end, playing immersed against any killer is a terrible idea. Bang gens as fast as possible and split up, don't be afraid to pressure gens with the killer nearby. Of course play a bit safer if on death hook or injured, but don't advise people to play immersed, I need less games where no gens get done while I'm chased for minutes.
---
Everything .\_. Except the mask.
---
i dont run ruin
---
uh oh, devs did an oopsy
---
I just started playing as killer and I purchased her among a few others. she's doesn't seem op unless you have leveled up most of the killers and have a lot of perk options. I only have a few teachables so far for killer, so I'm definitely not always dropping 4k's, even with spirit.
---
That would be neat too, but then people would be even more toxic than now just to ensure they rank up and can have the cosmetic lol it would be a toxic bloodbath.
---
So insta-heals are dead?
---
I need my pretty lady bubba though
---
Good nurses will stay good but imo it's still an over the top nerf. It's not game breaking but too extreme. The new addons they gave her suck, if they were going to nerf her base kit as well they should've atleast replaced her old OP addons with new strong but fair ones
---
Plague, either she has survivors constantly injured or they decide to give her and unlimited stream of hatchets for a period of time, and she‚Äôs not super slow like huntress so it‚Äôs not like if you don‚Äôt cleanse it‚Äôs any easier.
---
Because there‚Äôs no time as killer.  If you go into a game with any chill, the game might be over before it starts.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt care about kills and avoid tunneling.  I‚Äôm just here for the BP.
---
Could also be a new character, like ‚ÄúThe Observer‚Äù
---
You haven't made it past rank 7 if that's what you think
---
Yeah I'm pretty sure i heard somewhere that they're going to do something to legion
---
When does Amanda wear that?
---
May be related to Vigo. Notice that the trapper is being called by his full name here, instead of his killer title.
---
Odd bulb says hi.
---
I feel like it‚Äôs way less optimal to be toxic honestly, at least coming from a survivor main
---
Borrowed Time, a perk that activated when a survivor unhooks you in the killers terror radius, the unhooker must have the perk so you can get the endurance effect
---
Hope you had calm spirit
---
I'm a little late, but... I don't really like playing survivor, I just feel like I always get teammates that don't care if I die, so I usually stick to playing killer. I like to play most of the killers I have unlocked every so often, but I usually play wraith or doctor, probably wraith more. I get a lot of flak for playing doctor, but I understand the whole screaming thing is kinda annoying. But I get a WHOLE lot more a whole lot more often while playing wraith. So that's where my question comes in... Why do people hate playing against wraith so much? Or, why do people hate "wraith mains" so much?
---
6 seconds to get 2 charges back, starting from the fatigue. Normal fatigue is 2 seconds after 1 blink, which means that you have to wait 1 second extra to use another blink, 2.5 seconds fatigue after 2 blinks which means you can get 1 blink back after 0.5 seconds. (I dont know if you gain blink charge whilst blinking but if you do there is like a slight delay). This charge gives a fighting chance for survivors as before it was way too easy as they couldn't even break LOS
---
i think thats the lore for the hallowed blight event
---
Is the far left supposed to be hopper's hospital gown from season 2?
---
AAAA THANK YOU!!
---
YES MY LAURIE ISNT RESRICTED!
---
MYERS on the other hand Ill have to see in game first...
---
I like to send a nice message after the game if they played well, saying gg and letting them know what I enjoyed. E.g. you got some really excellent chainsaw hits, nice loops, well done on getting your team mate out, good mind games, and so on.
---
It‚Äôs fine to stream but to self advertise in the game you are playing is kind of dumb. Also it‚Äôs just a meme about TTV people getting mori‚Äôd
---
&gt; Pustula Petals will instead create a pair of event Hooks and Generators for each Offering used
---
I get why people complained about last year even tho I disagree but god this is boring. Completely and totally uninteresting. At least something like the lanterns from chinese new year could have been done
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
Why she DC?
---
I saw that Ghostface skin...
---
I need new sheets.
---
You know that gens can be done through ruin, right?
---
The Nurse skin? No. Premium. Check the premium track in the screenshot. You'll see the head cosmetics for her there.
---
Nope got morried
---
I think Myers would occupy his own tier. He is beyond just a psycho or sadist. He is the embodiment of evil. 
---
On the scale of evil he is past the entity. At least the entity derived pleasure and entertainment from the trial. Myers is just out to murder. No games. No emotion. No enjoyment. Pure unadulterated evil menace
---
Like any killer, he *could* be deadly in proper hands -  but as a stand-alone, he‚Äôs not the best. 
---
His portals can be seen very easily, especially compared to the Hag‚Äôs similar but far superior porting ability. Also unlike the Hag, they‚Äôre not very fast. They can help traverse the map but if they‚Äôre placed too obviously, survivors will just destroy them. It pays to put them a little bit out of the way so survivors either A) don‚Äôt waste time and break them, or B) take extra time to get rid of them. When Demo first arrived, I saw lots of people trying to put it too close to gens or gates and the portals would just get removed.
---
Shred is a decent ability, but again, not as good as Billy‚Äôs saw (insta down + unlimited dash) or Huntress‚Äô hatchet throw (much better range), both having similar ranged abilities. One thing it has over Huntress is it can shred pallets, but can‚Äôt go over them/through windows like the hatchet can. It‚Äôs not an insta-down so unless you‚Äôre doing it on an injured survivor, you‚Äôre probably wasting time unless you‚Äôre really good at it. It‚Äôs pretty easy to dodge IMO but like most other abilities, it can be circumstantial. 
---
He‚Äôs a mid-to-low tier killer IMO. Not the worst but he‚Äôs only alright. Generally, I breathe a sigh of relief when I hear Demo as the game is starting.
---
Shut it don't make me bring a Ebony Mori
---
Even better than I thought, I keep hearing it‚Äôs meta so I‚Äôm gonna need to get it asap.  Can it get it by simply leveling my Main or do I need to level Bill?
---
That‚Äôs strange they decided to make only hers paid although in it is the ptb so it could change at anytime. Either way I‚Äôm getting the paid pass but still sad
---
I was literally about to comment this. beat me to it. upvote.
---
don‚Äôt tell me what to do
---
Styptic got a buff tbh.
---
Undetectable doesn‚Äôt affect premonition and spine chill, the only killer immune to those perks is Mike at T1
---
my wallet can't handle this!!!
---
Bruh all cosmetics are paid stop complaining
---
Thank god
---
Oh okay sorry sir
---
It's honestly not that much different from standard gameplay tho
---
people hook suicide a lot. people go afk a lot. people just fuck around to fuck around a lot.
---
at least hallowed blight had something fun and different attached
---
I'd say use up the syringes but keep the styptics. Styptics are getting buffed.
---
You should have expected that honestly
---
Its debuff is that your footsteps go from a pitter patter to THOMP THOMP THOMP THORMP THUMP THEEMP
---
As a year+ survivor main who became a killer main I avoid killing and focus on 8 hooks.  Same entertaining chases, great practice and plenty of bloodpoints...and I get a surprising amount of nice PMs.
---
it just doesn't come off that way sadly to a killer. teabagging is considered super disrespectful in general soooooo you can understand why killers get mad when you do it at them. lol
---
Some aren't it's just the playstyle
---
Fun stuff, nice work. That‚Äôs not facecamping though lol.
---
How did you change your perk colors
---
Lithe+Hope and Borrowed Time from the unhook
---
Yeah I‚Äôll just use normal hooks thank you very much
---
Lithe, dance with me, lightweight
---
Dammit I wanted to comment this!
---
They absolutely are, they are a catrin and a catrina
---
And I will bring it with the legion
---
&gt;If you're a killer main please dont comment
---
Didn't know this turned to North Korea.
---
Ya does seem ok I am still not a big fan of a paid game getting a season pass but it does seem nice and being able to earn them back to get the next free is a nice touch
---
*ohh really???*
---
You get keys. Once they nerf keys then we can talk about nerfing moris.
---
People still would be though. You see how the bloodhunt was. Killers were putting on the most OP builds and games were lasting half the making of time even though it would be more beneficial to work together and farm.
---
"HI MY NAME IS CATRINA"
---
‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre a killer main, don‚Äôt comment‚Äù yeah, that‚Äôs how you get the community on your side, tell half of em to fuck right off
---
Can‚Äôt speak to the games you played in or what that guy was doing, but I‚Äôll tunnel sometimes. If I notice one survivor is aces at looping me, blinding, great heal perks, etc. then I‚Äôm going to make a point to take them out. Face camping is dumb and I‚Äôll only proxy if I know the whole squad is swarming to unhook. 
---
But I got a choice between the skilled player who is causing me problems vs someone else? I‚Äôm gonna get the former. It‚Äôs not personal, I‚Äôm not mad at them. It‚Äôs just business - you‚Äôre really good, so I want to kill you ASAP.
---
Stop making excuses for yourself about the other person's playstyle. It might not seem toxic, but it creates a divide between killers and survivors which can make good sportsmanship impossible. Not only that excuses for your loss only serves as hindering to your skill growth.
---
Exactly this survivor is asking people to stop playing spirit but there‚Äôs nothing about spirit that‚Äôs toxic or should induce rage survivors may want to and do dc If they face a spirit and killers might want to dc if they get d striked that does not make them toxic
---
I had someone add me while playing as survivor in their group. I think they were trying to help? they told me "So if you  hilw a piping son the best is nir you"
---
no, no. thank them for blessing us with several amazing cosmetics.
---
Totally agree. Something similar to chinese new year would have been cool
---
Because i dont give a fuck about what killer mains have to say
---
I'm gonna play spirit and bring a mori just for you :)
---
aww hell yeah
---
You have to get the teachable from bill if you didn‚Äôt have it before
---
There is nothing scary or exciting about being on the hook.
---
I don't like having my lives, which is essentially what each hook phase is, dependent on me smashing my keyboard and hoping that there is not a lag spike.
---
&gt;Would you rather play a horror game where you don‚Äôt have to do anything? Or one that you actually have to put some kind of effort?
---
Yeah there is so much hard work in smashing your space bar, That takes real skill... Only the best players survive the struggle phase of the hook right?
---
Are you kidding me?
---
Yes, let‚Äôs balance the game by telling killer mains their opinions don‚Äôt matter. Fuck em
---
my wallet is crying
---
Why wouldn't it, it's an aura reading perk with a defined range.
---
I was randomly searching for some legion build's people favor and came across this week old post and I see nobody responded, so I took the time.  Legion has a 32m default terror radius, Distressing lvl 3 is 26% increase (+8.32m), M&amp;A is 8 meter increase in chase.  So legion with lvl 3 distressing new radius is 40.32m and with M&amp;A **while in chase** its a 40m radius.  Essentially, they do the same as the math shows (**while in chase** and assuming you **wait** to pop feral frenzy until the chase begins therefore triggering your monitor radius increase) therefore M&amp;A imo is the logical choice since it **also** offers you the reduced radius while maneuvering the map outside of a chase to cut the chase time down when they realize you are approaching.  All you are sacrificing for the M&amp;A extra benefit is the 0.32m extra radius that comes with distressing  - **but if you choose to play where you pop feral frenzy early prior to initiating a chase** then imo distressing is the way to go to guarantee your larger radius (I don't know for sure if the game can recognize and initiate a chase event while feral frenzy is active in regards to weather it will or will not trigger M&amp;A increased radius)
---
Then don‚Äôt fucking buy it you stale cumsock
---
Iron will
---
As a console player, the first time I played huntress I thought she was impossible to play.  Now I think her PC tier is spot on.
---
Yall r,,,,, prepptty,,,,,,
---
I already took it back.
---
Yeah, sometimes when the killer tries to farm I do a T-bag to let them know I'm on board. I feel like a few of them get offended by it though :(
---
BHVR nerf all killers pls trapper too pwrful
---
Mother of god there‚Äôs finally more licensed cosmetics we have been blessed this day
---
Prayer beads aside, the main issue with Spirit is that the "mind game" her kit enables isn't a mind game in some situations; it's more of a guessing game. Let's say the survivor puts down a pallet at a loop, the Spirit stays on the other side and the survivor now has to guess whether the Spirit is phasing or baiting it. Guess wrong and you take a hit.
---
It's not very fun. Personally I don't have any problems with her phase walk, but the aformentioned scenario makes it extremely frustrating to go up against a Spirit, simply because the counter play is limited. If there's grass nearby you can look for movement but in a heated chase, paying attention to such a minor detail isn't always feasible. 
---
So yeah, that's why people want her nerfed although some dislike her phase walk in general, while others only dislike it in certain situations.
---
i dc spirit if i go down or a teammate gets hooked before a gen gets popped so good luck with that
---
Nah, Genji is Myers. His dragon blade is an insta-down. Sometimes Genji pops up as a survivor instead and his swift strike (sprint burst) + wall climb make him good at looping. 
---
Sombra - yup, wraith 
---
Tracer- Nurse!
---
Moira - Spirit 
---
Lucio - Legion
---
Rein - hillbilly
---
does the ghostface skin have the weird flowy ribbons? cuz if not thats gonna be a must have
---
Wait what happened to her I‚Äôve been out of the loop
---
The pigs a woman
---
I just hope Ghostface players get the cosmetic. I will be fun to play against him now that he actually looks like he's supposed to.
---
r/whooosh
---
Except that premonition and spine chill are 100% useless against Myers. Why is this allowed for one but not the other?
---
Ok. Spirit needed a small nerf, since her power is extremely easy to use and learn, while being the 2nd best killer with that nonexistent learning curve.
---
Excuse you wraith wouldnt try to poison anyone
---
clown is shitty circumstances and legion is psychopath
---
This explains alot
---
Those are programming issues, art and design teams are 100% separate
---
Is that^made with mematic
---
your typical survivor main... instead of adapt and learn how to beat the killer just DC...
---
YES OG GHOSTFACE AND STEVE!!!
---
spirit bad
---
I NEED ALL OF THEM NOW
---
Sorry, man. I can explain it to you but I can't understand it to you.
---
The new Battle Pass system, pay 10 bucks to earn rewards by leveling up and challenges
---
Honestly I didn't know this was even a thing. I would guess that less observant players and people who are bad at escaping the killer don't like that he can just appear and get a free hit on you with hardly any warning. But play whoever you want. Most people won't care who you play, and if they do, it's probably because they lost. I would even say that Wraith is one of the weakest killers in the game (at high ranks anyway) because he has no way to end chases quickly besides simply chasing the survivor until they make a mistake or run out of pallets.
---
ME FIRST
---
There will always be a best killer. There will always be metas. We can‚Äôt just constantly call for a nerf of whatever the opposing teams strongest asset is
---
Ah alright I saw that I take back the stale part then, you is just Regular cumsock now
---
Not sure if you're assuming I disconnected or not, if not my bad. 
---
Though if you are, I meant "I left right after I died" as in I left the lobby once the whole death animation played out.
---
I didn't make it. I paid someone else to do it so idk
---
When he gets EW3 something gets exposed and it becomes extra scary.
---
Very nice. I posted thinking it was going to be a shit bp. But they did good. I shouldn't have doubted them.
---
I finally got to rank 1 survivor for the first time last week only playing solo every match.
---
It was hell, but felt like something I needed to accomplish,  if for no reason other than to prove myself I could do it.
---
So yeah this resonated with me lol
---
r/perkbydaylight has an entire tutorial that is pretty easy to follow, it also is a place for people to make and share their own perk packs that you can download.
---
Time to hang myself!
---
It's really hard to activate MoM even once in a match.
---
BHVR: you can now activate MoM multiple times in match.
---
Big brain buff.
---
Nurse and spirit have a specific way of playing that is boring. I want to play against a killer that i can actually use pallets and run structures against. Not just feel like every mechanic becomes useless because nurse can go through walls and if spirit gets lucky she wins
---
Dude the killer straight SNATCHED her
---
They actually just leaked that Frank and Julie are getting matching Dia de Los muertos skins! So they‚Äôre probably always going to have matching skins - since they‚Äôre one of the only two canon couples.
---
Is this just on PC or am I just blind? Didn't see it when I played today
---
Get this on r/Oinkers_ ASAP! We ned this there!
---
Awesome thanks mate
---
No. I played killer, if you couldn't do well against good survivors with a killer other than nurse you were just a bad killer.
---
&gt; The Nurse was the one thing killers had against experienced survivors.
---
That is the dumbest take I have seen. Have you heard of spirit? Hillbilly? Skill?
---
can we have an alternate game mode where it's just succing plant juice
---
Uhh
---
Everybody gangsta, 'til the nurse start walkin'
---
I hope so
---
Ah, ok, that makes sense.
---

Just kidding 8), it's Livin' La Vida Loca by Ricky Martin
---
Once Spirit gets better ‚ÄúTIME TO NERF BILLY‚Äù this shit won‚Äôt stop but while people complain luckily BHVR know how to balance so when they nerf they also buff other killers at the same time or close or nerf survivors so don‚Äôt worry ‚Äúkiller mains‚Äù this guy is just wasting his breath.
---
Classic ghostface!? I don't even play him and I'll take 10!
---
I‚Äôm a pretty casual player so maybe I just don‚Äôt see the point in complaining about it. If I come across these things I suck it up and play the game the best I can and move on. A lot of the ‚Äúissues‚Äù people complain about I don‚Äôt really see as issues so maybe I just don‚Äôt understand
---
Yep
---
Here is the issue with the nerf a lot of the add-ons  weaken her power but give blood points some of the worst add-ons in the game like padded jaws and speed limiter some of the most useless add-ons in the game. Also, survivors know where she will blink before she will, its only .3 seconds but in dbd it will make a difference. Another thing is it will be very hard for her to catch up to survivors she already moves slower than survivors so the distance between the bling the survivor will be gone, and with perks like balanced landing lithe and, sprint burst will not let her catch up to survivors with multiple blinks. I don't like the fact there making such a dramatic change to her because people don't know/like how to play against killers who aren't standard like nurse and spirit so the fact there reworking her blinks to have a cool down is something I don't like. I would of just increased fatigue by .3 seconds for each blink
---
You must level Bill up to, think 40. 
---
If you were playing on console up until the Freddy re-work, all 3 of his perks were unassigned and just appeared in the blood web. Since the Freddy rework came out and Bill with the Left 4 Dead cosmetics came with it, the perks were reassigned to Bill meaning you had to unlock it through his blood web if you didn't already have it on a survivor
---
If you took the time to read you‚Äôd know this guy was trying to bring awareness to it so that BHVR fixes it faster
---
WHEN DO THEY COME OUT
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to adapt or learn a new playstyle, so let‚Äôs just nerf the killer into irrelevance so I don‚Äôt have to deal with them‚Äù FeelsRank20Man
---
The queue times are long enough already, I highly doubt they‚Äôll ever split the player base. Iirc in one of the older dev streams they even said that any alternate modes they did would just be for events anyways and then be back to normal
---
Wish there was more of a variety of gestures you could use in game. Would be cool.
---
"Gutted" She will still be good lmao. A good nurse will just be rewarded for actually being good and not just spamming blinks
---
What does OoO mean?
---
More r/Oinkers_ :D
---
Those are not the original Ghostface robes, but they are close.
---
Well with the nurse ‚Äúrework‚Äù I can‚Äôt blame you
---
can we talk about how abemic legion is and how they can still carry jeff?
---
Fine. What is more exciting? Playing a shooter game where it auto aims and takes no effort? Or would it be more exciting to aim for yourself and actually put in some effort?
---
HEY MAAA
---
Enitiy in the flesh?
---
wtf are you talking about?
---
They should be coming with the new update on October 22nd. 
---
However they might come out over time. We‚Äôll get them by Christmas for sure.
---
Stop complaining
---
Thicc for Jane
---
Yes billy is strong. But at least hes not bullshit to play against that makes the game boring because he ignores all mechanics of the game
---
Something something ENTITY MAGIC
---
Does Q&amp;Q counter this?
---
And also I think it wouldn't fit in Dbd
---
Broken part of nurse was addons, omega blinks and extra blinks are the most notorious. No nurse that was competent needed these add ons, they were the actual broken part that needed addressed and what most people wanted to be addressed. Now the basekit nerfs (The changing of nurses blink to a charge based power) they were uncalled for and they really just gut her gameplay. She still is slower than survivors when running (97% I think). This means that she has to blink onto survivors 100% of the time if she wants to be unaffected by this. Now that is clearly impossible with factors that include LOS breakers, areas in certain maps that have invisible barriers for nurse blinks etc. Now if we take into account of this 3 second charge per blink. 6 seconds will be needed every double blink, this is also included with fatigue. If you use a blink and an attack misses then you are punished harshly for it. If you use a blink you are forced to walk at the speed which is slower than survivors making keeping chasing and patrolling the map much more difficult. A popular survivor perk especially in red ranks is dead hard, that perk is going to ruin this new nurse, she is forced to use blinks and the survivor gets a guaranteed extended chase. With all this time being wasted, gens are going to be done with little to no pressure, I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to do a gen but I pretty sure a decent chunk can and will be completed with no fear from nurse. It's just not needed especially if nurse is still slower than base survivors.
---
Why are his perks yellow?
---
Sure,but sometimes one gen is popped after another because the killer is focused in one player instead of putting map pressure. I mean,in 3 of my games I got tunneled with no gens been done and in 2 of those with Ruin still active. I was being chased for 2 minutes while my teammates searched for the totem and when they unhooked me, killer avoids everyone to get me again with no gens being done. I really want to DC in those situations but I don't and for what? For 5k BP? I mean, come on. I understand tunneling in green/yellow ranks and without Ruin. But in red ranks, WITH Ruin still active? That's like stating you are a noob.
---
If it‚Äôs so easy why are you complaining like a little bitch?
---
He's a big dude!
---
Honestly, I always thought her having like 105% movement speed with one blink would of been interesting way to change her.
---
Maybe the nurse goats will still shred but almost nobody else will do good
---
"wait, but if YOU'RE Michael, and YOU'RE michael, and IM michael, who's hunting the dweet?"
---
A bug where if you use a specific accessory I‚Äôm assuming it will be purple rarity and have the colour green on the charm if the survivor has MoM Active is asleep and has 2 stacks of distortion blinds Freddy with the Halloween flashlight with sapphire lens and yellow battery add-on and then Freddy hits them and then the last gen is complete giving the survivor adrenaline health and Freddy noed after dream snaring the survivor and downing them will cause the game to crash on the underground lab map
---
It‚Äôs in the PTB for testing starting on PC today so it will probably be live two weeks from today, gonna be a long couple weeks
---
‚ÄúBuenos Dias fuckboy!‚Äù
---
Same PS4 nurse main here hopefully it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems
---
First of all, clear some of those discord notifications. 
---
Second I feel it's more likely to be an npc like the dude sitting in the chair in the rift, but you might be right
---
It will either be different in some small way, or just a cheaper two piece cosmetic. Either way just don't buy it lol.
---
Ah, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the info!
---
Mori's were already nerfed. You used to not even have to hook someone.
---
Going against the demogorgon is an instant 8K boldness I've found
---
God... I love this community and their memes
---
Lol don‚Äôt say good nurses aren‚Äôt on console man
---
On the forums they said 22nd of october
---
Then getting the killer mad so he hits too soon due to anger and anxiety sounds like a nice strategy too...
---
Shrek 5 mmmm
---
It only lasts about a minute and its to discourage "tunneling" or otherwise unsafe hook rescues in front of or around the killer.
---
Same as Deciesive Strike as you need to be put in dying state so long after being unhooked for it to activate. Its also built to discourage "tunneling" however killers will often slug or dribble to avoid to stun.
---
Why does everyone say if you don't like it don't buy it, that's not the fucking problem.
---
Why can't I just buy all the skins in the store? Why is it that I need to pay in order to be able to grind? That's ridiculous. I don't understand how people are supporting this shit.
---
You pay for the game, you pay for fucking characters, you pay for skins and now you pay in order to have the honor to be able to grind more. Bhvr is quad-dipping and some of you are just bending over waiting to take it.
---
You actually can't use it while broken, as you can't start the healing action when broken. but it is definitely good against billy/bubba, especially if you 99% the heal then pop the styptic and finish the heal with self-care.
---
Ruin, Thanatophobia, Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher. Note: Don't stalk with this build.
---
Come on, I want new Joe and Susie, idgaf about Frank and Julie :‚Äô(
---
I highly, highly doubt she'll stop being the best killer in the game in the hands of actually good killer players.
---
And even if she does, why does she deserve to be in a tier of her own anyway? It only makes sense to bring her in line with the other good killers.
---
&gt; Putrid Serum is only available in the free track of The Rift.
---
Ex-fucking-scuse you BHVR? We BOUGHT the game, and you're adding in a PAID, unoriginal, Battlepass? Jesus fucking christ.
---
*crit noises*
---
My A and D are about to get fucked
---
Yes, that is my point. A nurse without add-ons is still going to be nowhere near the position 90% of the killer cast is in without addons. 
---
Your maths is wrong so it all falls apart. The nurse is only stationary for her 2.5s of fatigue. So it goes as follows - the survivor gains 10m of distance from the nurse during her fatigue. During the 3.5s it will take from that point to recharge both blinks the survivor will only gain another 0.525m, as the Nurse is able to walk as usual, making the Survivor's total extra distance at that point 10.525m, which is well within the range of a single blink, never mind two, and far far away from the 24m you said.  WM1ing is still nowhere near an effective answer to her in this state.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people are complaining all you gotta do is play and you get free stuff don‚Äôt have to buy premium
---
Shutbup
---
Is that another pig/ wraith main i see?? Now if you also main Plague i think i found my alt account in the wild or something
---
He was face camping me all the way up until that point since I was on the verge of second state. If I were to include the minute of him facecamping me, the montage wouldn't be too interesting, now would it?
---
I don't try to lie in these clips about what's happening, I just have fun things happen and try to make them enjoyable :P
---
They‚Äôre as rare as a rainbow colored flying semitruck
---
I like running Thrilling Tremors, Pop Goes The Weasel, Enduring and Shadowborn
---
Thrilling and Pop for generator regression, Enduring for disrespecting pallets and helping to get them out of the game ASAP and Shadowborn is just a personal favourite of mine. I like the extra FoV but you can swap it out with perks that help with stealth or game slowdown.
---
I just use $12.99 Sony earphones lmao
---
Granted I don't have Spirit
---
Yess best Steve, but kinda sad he doesnt have red face bandana and those yellow swimming googles :/
---
Actually true. I just want to play how i want to play. Not be limited because of a bullshit killer
---
Pantsless Myers &gt; Shirtless Myers
---
Keep moris because the animations are amazing and one of the best parts of a new killer BUT ebony mori is just ridiculous imo. If you just took out the ebony I'd be perfectly happy.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM8ukJtZUtY&amp;t=18s
---
You ask and you shall receive
---
Yeah, I'm still kinda new to the game and it took me a while to figure out that you could emote lol.
---
Ah I was! My bad, I misread and thought you meant you left/disconnected because of the killers bullshit.
---
I guess I‚Äôm a rainbow flying semi truck then lol it‚Äôs always funny watching the swf start freaking out because they can‚Äôt bully me
---
No. I am try to say it annoying and hyporcital for killers to have these powerful add-ons and perks yet it's only survivors getting nerfed.
---
Such as this PTB change to instaheals yet iridescent heads, prayer beads, and the like were not even mentioned.
---
Somehow BNP is still an ultra rare even though the effect is quite underwhelming.
---
A instaheal can only be used once per match. If we follow that logic should hillbilly or leatherface lose thier instadowns which can be used to thier hearts content? The awnser is **NO**
---
Typical Killer main. After almost a year and a half of constant survivor nerfs you still complain! What else can be done? Ruin becomes included in all killers base kits? Loops being blocked after vaulting once? What will it take for you to realize survivors play this game as well?
---
Giving my opinions on dumb mechanics = complaining like a little bitch. Okay dude.
---
Keep telling yourself that your a super good player because you survived the struggle phase, fucking loser.
---
Didn't see the details, but the link said that you can earn what Auric Cells spent on the Rift Pass can be earn back. Also don't know if you can make a profit and earn more than the original 1,000 ($10), but we'll just have to see in the PTB. It even details that it should take roughly 80 hours to complete a Rift if you play both Killer and Survivor.
---
In short- $10 entree fee for the 1,000 AC will get you access to everything in the Rift. And it is possible to never pay any more than that starter $10 if you happen to put enough time into the game and play both roles over the 70 days a Rift is active. Giving you unlimited access to the Rift, unless you use the AC gained from the Rift for something else that is.
---
Because she breaks the core mechanics of the game, not because shes easy. Pallets, windows, general vaults, high points, low points. All of them go out the window, she can be wherever she wants, whenever she wants.  
---
You're injured? You better heal, or get healed. Oh wait, but this person who can hit you from anywhere can see where you are if you are healing, so now she can just teleport to you and bonk ya.   
---
Just running from her? That sounds like a plan... oh wait, shes already just on me now. Well thats okay! Ill 360 when she goes for her teleport! Oh... she did it twice and it didnt matter...  
---
Is there skill to using her properly? Sure. Shes pretty easy for a decent player to get good with, but as will all killers she still requires effort. However shes good because she breaks everything survivors are suppose to have to protect them, not because shes unique or complex in her design. That is why she isn't a real killer in my mind, because she doesn't play like any other killer in the ways of mechanics and environmental interaction. Like if you played COD, with your destiny character. It just doesn't fit the bill
---
I havent played the plague yet. I saw the plague and thought it was intresting but never got to it. Do you play pig or wraith more?
---
You can‚Äôt ask for killers to be nerfed just because you don‚Äôt like playing against them, that‚Äôs not balance. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being a casual, but you shouldn‚Äôt expect the game to be tailored to your preferences, that‚Äôs not how you achieve balance
---
It really is as simple as that though don't fucking buy it and if enough people don't they won't making another one. Buuuut if they make money off it they'll keep doing it because people got it and liked it and if more people want it then not then you better get used to it cause it'll become a permanent feature. And anyways a lot of people were saying they'd be in the store eventually anyways so if that's true you could quit your bitching
---
IS that the new hook for chuckie? Its nice that the entity reduced them so he could reach.
---
You know what they say about guys with big hands
---
This clip gives me hope
---
I get ears exploded everytime and I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
Now david has a different patern for his cargo pants for each map
---
Otz will never not come up with 200 iq plays
---
&gt; Fine. What is more exciting? Playing a shooter game where it auto aims and takes no effort?
---
Your examples are shit.
---
It would be like a shooter making you spam spacebar to respawn - Dumb.
---
Every survivor knows spirit is too strong. Hence why i said for killer mains to not comment
---
*Curb your logic theme plays in the background*
---
Giving my opinion on good mechanic that is competent fine = fucking looser? Okay dude
---
he has yaoi hands
---
Can they make it to where WGLF gives a stack for healing. Still have to play super aggressive to get stacks. And still encourages farming of the hook.
---
Huntress already has to endure splinters in her feet from breaking pallets. But at least she grew up without shoes and can handle it.
---
Shape doesn't know what hell he is about to get into.
---
Couple questions.
---
Why do his items look all weird? Did the Demogorgon reach down to pick something up...?
---
And also: I swear I saw a new map in there. Have they added one recently?
---
Hope the butt flap is undone
---
Holy shit these devs are the best!
---
Most of the time if I know there's an injured survivor around and they suddenly get healed I typically check lockers.
---
Yeah when injured survivors disappear the scratch marks go away and then they get healed literally 8 seconds after it's really obvious what they're going for
---
Do we even know if Nurse's blight set is included with the rest? I mean she's not on the official art, wasn't in with the rest of leaked skins and killers still having five skins while survivors having only one is straight up unfair.
---
&gt; Giving my opinion on good mechanic that is competent fine
---
Devs disagree with you and are adressing it, so you can think what you want.
---
Your a loser because you got mad over something so trivial :)
---
Pretty sure it's a free hallowed blight skin
---
Source?  I usually go to the official Wiki and don't see anything there, not sure where else to look.
---
My point exactly! But until they do, put hook saves and protection hits as a way to get tokens and leave it to a 1 time use only. Yes I agree with you there that it needed a change but come on not nerfed into the ground like they did and them knowing protection hits are still broke, I was doing a hook save the other day and took 2 hits and my WGLF did not count it and I was touch the guy.
---
Ghostface is my favorite mori to get I‚Äôm never even mad
---
*A year later:* **PTB OVER**
---
Ruin, Nurses, Thanataphobia, Sloppy Butcher
---
Addons: both addons to increase power regeneration
---
Use your stealth on cooldown because it comes back super quickly. Goal of this build is to keep everybody injured. Fuck the stalk, it's not worth your time. Sneak up on people and smack them once for free. If they go to a strong loop, either stay long enough to break the pallet or just straight up leave them. If they go for an unsafe loop, go for the down. Once you have everyone injured it becomes insanely unsafe for them to stay injured because at any time you can walk around the corner and down them. If they try to heal in a relevant place, you can find them with Nurses, sneak up and down them. 
---
After about 30 hours with him at red ranks this build most consistently gives me the best results. Works even better than Enduring, Spirit Fury because if you pull it off right you barely have to chase anyone. If the survivor doesnt bring either a medkit or self care they're basically fucked. This build (more of just ghostface as a whole) gets destroyed by object of obsession and/ or Spine Chill so you're going to want to avoid the object until you have good pressure up and have the time to chase him.
---
It's all good, I honestly used to dc out of matches that were pretty much loses. But those matches are honestly the best possible chance I have of getting these clips.
---
Now I just play these matches out since dc'ing hurts both survivors and killers more than me just staying and getting myself into bad positions on purpose. If I'm facing a killer while my 2 teammates are being immersed and doing nothing, I might as well play stupid and hope that something cool happens!
---
Oic. Didn‚Äôt think you were lying I‚Äôve just been accused of facecamping when I was just camping (which I consider justified in some situations as long as you give them metaphorical room to breath). 
---
I didn‚Äôt realize you had edited the facecamping out. I understand why you would for presentation as I really enjoyed your video but I was scratching my head like, ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a basement camp?‚Äù lol.
---
Myers: it‚Äôs pretty drafty in here
---
You put ugly leather daddy in top tier, but not Ghosty boy?
---
You‚Äôre on to something here

I probably play more Survivor than Killer these days and even I'm telling you, Spirit is fine. There's only a couple goofy abuses, and just about every killer has several of those. If you've been seeing too much Spirit with Prayer Beads lately, just bring Spine Chill. Maybe also Lightweight and/or Iron Will. That's all you really need to make a Spirit main cry.
---
And to everyone who only plays either Survivor or Killer instead of actually doing both full time: I do not recognize your opinions, for they are guaranteed to be biased.
---
Myers should has his own tier
---
Fair enough - I'll remember for next time :)
---
It's an abbreviation for Object of Obsession :)
---
**Equipping both Nurse Movement Speed add-ons WILL glitch your match out.**
---
Equipping the Matchbox and Spasmodic Breath together will cause your movement to sputter/lag out, until you freeze in place unable to move for the rest of the trial.
---
Just so everybody knows not to try and combo those together.
---
she's too big
---
I mean my name is a slight give away, but im a die hard rank 1 pig with Plague being my main secondary and Wraith is my other secondary. Pig is just my favorite killer as a whole, even before i got into dbd since Saw is for both ironic and unironic reasons, is my favorite movie franchise. The skins she has been getting are dope and if anyone needs advice on how to play her better, there is a streamer called Scorpionz that has the best tips that helped me the most with her!
---
I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt mind, penis-muncher.
---
You are correct. My bad. I just dont think its bad like some people are making it out to be. I wouldnt even call it a nerf.
---
Survivors mains don‚Äôt make the decisions. We all do. If Spirit is overpowered, killers will know it too. Believe it or not, we all care about balance (most of us anyways), you need both sides to make a decision like who needs nerfed/buffed. And as a side note, the only real change that spirit needs is to lose collision while phasing, there doesn‚Äôt need to be any significant nerf
---
I have custom perk icons that I found at r/perkbydaylight 
---
You have to be on PC in order to do it
---
Its one of the few battle passes in a game I think i'm getting it looks interesting and is nice since i only pay ten dollars for a handful of cosmetics and do it again later and get even more one of the best decisions in the game BHVR has made.
---
Likely the same guy that made the Hallowed Blight serum leading to the name of Alchemist.
---
hmm
---
That puts you on par with classics such as bloons tower defence and that one where you played as a sentient zombie with turn based combat. Congratulations!
---
Its almost like they need to test the servers with a lot of people on them to see if they function..?
---
any reason why i see it as a way to reward playing the game
---
The fact Freddy got buffed and is now considered one of the stronger killers if not a contender for one of the top 5... Maybe you shouldn't act so sanctimonious?
---
Didn‚Äôt they also put a cool down on her blinks
---
Phasing gives you good map pressure and mindgames. Survivors cant mindgame as well against killers they cant see
---
He's so... Human comapared to the others, i mean
---
Trapper is a fucken wall of muscles and metal hooks
---
Plague is literally melting
---
Doctor has wires and metal through his body
---
Hag and spirit are almost 100% dead bodies, maybe not hag she's more of an wendigo
---
And legion is... Dude/girl with small knife... Same with ghostface
---
Hmm. I think i know you. Somewhere... your name is amazing yet familiar.
---
Sweet, so I should be able to finish it in about 2 1/2 Weeks. I play this game way too much, I'm totally addicted.
---
Yes, but there'll be an at least 6 months delay (which I think is fair if you ask me)
---
So wait, when does it come out? I‚Äôm kinda stupid.
---
I never said that you ducking dumb ass. I said struggling to accomplish something during the STRUGGLE faze. And I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have the same opinion as the devs, that‚Äôs clearly a sin that must be punished.
---
I've been rank 1 for 15 months straight now. Facing a Good rank 1 nurse means instant depip. She will never need more than 8 blinks to Down you. That apprx. 25-40 seconds of chase. TOPS.
---
Which means that every 30-45 seconds one Person is on the hook.
---
This means healing+saving+running to the hook is LONGER than for her to fuck someone up. No Chance to do something. Great fun.
---
Even the changes wont do much to her in that regard
---
it‚Äôs to carry his massive peen
---
Thanks for all the info! We'll investigate it.
---
Bah
---
It is not considered an event skin.
---
Killing the game? Yeah, definitely
---
I've only been playing a month myself and the biggest thing I've learned is to not be afraid to give up on chases quickly. I'm not good at shutting down looping survivors so if they do it twice I generally just give up and go start patrolling the generators. 8 times out of 10 I find them out in the open later and get them a lot easier without having wasted my time chasing them in the first place.
---
Some people will complain about everything. They'll complain about losing, they'll complain about winning. It's best to just ignore this kind of person.
---
Why does Meg always get the same boring type of cosmetics?
---
Oh my god Matthieu wasn't lying to my roommate and I at NYCC.........we asked about shirtless Meyers, he laughed and said they had something better.........we thought he was kidding about pantless Meyers.....we were fools
---
So I can‚Äôt use the extra pustula petals I have from last year??? If that‚Äôs the case then refund me my blood points since I had to buy extras in order to level up my survivors during the event... 
---
To bad they weren‚Äôt sticking to the same theme was nice to have a side objective but people in this community Always find a way to fuck up something fun and force the devs hand into making it dull...
---
I don't always get face camped, but I also find Ghostface hard to versus.  I find Pig a lot easier to counter, and she can't expose you with stalking.  I still haven't bought Ghostface; I feel like playing a few matches as him might help me counter him, but I also find his mechanics kind of cheesy so I'm reluctant to even try him out. :/
---
Did not know that was a thing and Im super happy it's going to be implemented
---
Mori should be on death hook imo especially with these new medkit changes. Nothing like being camped, tunnelled then moried off your first hook after waiting 10 minutes for a game.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/df61s9/new_ptb_glitch_he_was_like_that_all_game/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I think it‚Äôs really shitty they made this as bait to get us to buy it. I‚Äôm buying it either way because I want to support them - because they *really* outdid themselves this October. I mean, 5 bad-ass hallowed blight skins, a plague hallowed blight skin i guess, Halloween chapter outfits, Saw chapter outfits, and to top it all off Day of the Dead outfits I never knew I wanted. But still it‚Äôs really shitty that they locked nurse behind a pay wall.
---
Don't tbag because it comes off wrong if you want to show you're being to a killer walk up to them slowly then get close for a hug. *please I'm lonely*
---
I should also note just in case if this can be any help.
---
The player who's suffering the desync can interact with anything within his area but anything out of where he originally is does not work causing stutters,
---
Worse one i believe is my friends also said they got stuck in me, and occasionally couldn't damage me where the afk me was standing.
---
Hopefully this help you understand if its anything else internally!
---
Good luck finding out if its an issue or just my game being special for some reason!
---
Crouching in the open areas near cars to sneak between big obstructions is what I do, even if I don't know if there's a survivor within sight.
---
I think it's just so you can properly test the rift
---
r/outside
---
\*That's the Rin Yamaoka
---
They‚Äôre not out of killers, we get a new one every 3 months. So we‚Äôd have 5 by next Halloween.
---
yeah but once you get used to use clues around you (footsteps, pain grunts, grass or crows) it's very easy to follow survivors.  
---
Uninjured there is some counterplay, but once you've been injured it's basicly a free down. Thats why I used Iron Will for the longest time, until they changed Stridor and stomped Iron Will with it. Now I see a lot of Spirits running Stridor in red ranks (some, but not all). Which makes it not really worth to use a perk to counter her, while a good amount of spirits use the counter to that.  
---
Bought her, level'd her up, played a few games and never touched her again. It was so easy to apply pressure &amp; end chases quick. Unlike nurse, picked her up and she was pretty hard to get used to, prediciting movements and get the timing for blinks right etc.
---
This sparks joy.
---
I'm agreeing that they shouldnt be nerfed.
---
It‚Äôs been like this for me since the stranger things update
---
\&gt;plague  
---
\&gt;good  
---
pick one. Survivors should not be able to nullify a main part of a killer's power. This doesn't apply to Ghostface, since his recharges and doesn't rely on survivors doing X thing to use.
---
how did you hide the UI?
---
Spent over a million blood points leveling since then too. At least. Can't even get the offering lmfao. It's like they don't even want people to see it. I'll get Coldwind Farm another 13 times. God forbid they make the map offering a little easier to get for the first week or something.
---
stop telling me to do rational things
---
KKonaW
---
Are you 12 or just an asshole with a god complex?
---
I remember when we had the excuse "maybe he's not level 15 yet?"
---
I don‚Äôt even play survivor and I want that David skin, it looks so good.
---
GIVE ME PRETTY LADY LEATHERFACE
---
No idea, still waiting for a Lobby to check lmao
---
Is the test out the rift. the Rift itself 1000 and I'm guessing the other 1000 is to buy some tiers
---
How can I work on Gens with fellow Survivors chums with big Trap in hand? üêñ
---
I had this happen too literally a few minutes ago on PTB (In a public match, not custom). I nearly shit my pants it was so fucking spooky. Billy was completely motionless and me and a Dwight kept getting downed out of nowhere working on a gen with no terror radius. 
---
For a bit I thought we either had a cheater, (Yes, some hacks still exist in DBD IIRC but they're extremely rare) or a lagswitcher. That, or some kind of god iri head huntress who was sniping people outside of humming range.
---
Eventually I hear Billy's chainsaw.
---
When we found Billy, he was standing there. Facing a wall. He swings and I go down. After a few minutes of people randomly going down from an invisible killer, he yeeted me off the exit gate handle. It was so creepy.
---
I just realized Dwight is tall af,and Freddy is short as hell
---
It would be nice to test gameplay against her and not have her go invisible.
---
Double bloodpoints
---
but i want ice cream :(
---
Let's not make any waves in here.
---
It is super cute I love it
---
Ok, I am gonna talk with the staff for that
---
They say it's ok
---
So you're saying there's a chance.
---
Lmao, it‚Äôs YOUR fault for not knowing what he‚Äôs talking about, dude. You came to this thread.
---
She starts spewing green pea soup, get the hell out!
---
We had this happen in a public match. I asked the killer just now and he said his FPS is uncapped.
---
I would make them be a horrific amalgamation of them all combined personally.
---
Yeah apparently it only affects Aura reading perks so spine chill will still work.
---
/&gt;Survivor mains yesterday    
---
YES!!! SUCK IT KILLERS
---
/&gt;Survivor mains today    
---
WAAAAA~ HOW DARE THEY GET RID OF INSTAHEALS WAAAAA~
---
God, survivor mains really are the most entitled, whiny babies.
---
The red stain itself is the killer
---
As Jeff\_BHVR said that killer could have framerate uncapped, But with my case with all of my friends here, nither of us had framerate uncapped, we were all at 60 fps and i was being effected for some strange reason.
---
Your living the life my guy! ;)
---
You can, they make event generators and event hooks spawn. It says it on the post.
---
It's a charm. If you hover over it you can see that it's a killer &amp; survivor charn
---
idk somewhere in between
---
Calm spirit   Deliverance.  Wake Up.   Leader
---
Damn! That Steve outfit will make me a Steve main, for sure! Finally!!!!!!!!
---
OG GHostface is legit as fuck too!
---
I almost exclusively play him and ive almost gotten him to red ranks, hes not bad by a mile, people who play him like a normal killer get destroyed tho
---
Pig mains rise up!!
---
*Next chapter: The Hook*
---
If you can't juke a Spirit, then that's your problem and get good. Simple as that.
---
Oh my god, a three second charge perk blink, how will she survive? I mean, she basically can‚Äôt blink anymore. She can‚Äôt ignore walls and pallets anymore, she‚Äôs useless! Behaviour interactive studious have gone too far, I‚Äôm writing a formal complaint. Why would they nerf the most powerful killer despite the fact that we specifically asked for it for years? Disgusting.
---
Who is that in the top right?
---
I'd kinda hope they give billy and bubba different add ons (even if they just change the name and icon but keep the same effect) because it always bugged me that they shared so many. Each killer is supposed to be different but here you had 2 killers that can run identical add ons
---
Wake up but 4 times
---
Michael is BUFFED
---
I was watching this stream earlier too. Missed this moment, thanks for sharing!
---
Monto, Noob3, TrU3ta1ent, Ussylis, etc. Just type in Dead By Daylight and check out different guys and learn what you can.
---
I was in this match and it was so fucking creepy. I have some footage too.
---
An ¬£80 game and a ton more cosmetics and they still want us to pay for a premium battle pass.
---
meh :(
---
Oh, I am *terribly* sorry. I thought you were someone else from a different argument.
---
‚ÄúGimme your wallet‚Äù

I just made the account too :P
---
No Dying Light? DL+Thanatos works good.
---
Nurse now has charges like tracer from overwatch which take 3 seconds to replenish each one
---
I say watch ortzdarva, fungoose and PainReliver
---
i'll have 2 days before i travel... big oof... big farming night ahead of me on the 22nd and 23rd Dx
---
Biggest excuse I've been hearing lately is, "It's easier when it's 3v1." Most killers don't care whether YOU have a fun game. And most of them are far more toxic than most survivors.
---
I remember my first game against hag. Activated a trap and got camped in the basement.  Good times
---
No it‚Äôs that compared to spirit, nurse is more fun to play against even though she isn‚Äôt very fun to play against.
---
‚ÄúI havent seen one survivor use it since it got nerfed.‚Äù
---
I kind of implied that I do play killer.  
---
Thanks for playing, try again.
---
The biggest reason we‚Äôre getting The Archives/BattlePass/Future Content is through the micro transactions. It‚Äôs what helps keep the game alive. 
---
Yeah, the game isn‚Äôt free, but it‚Äôs relatively cheap considering the long life this game has been able to uphold. You aren‚Äôt being FORCED to buy anything anyways.
---
I play mostly survivor, but for killer main nurse. Obviously I'm going to hold off judging until I play, but I'm afraid the base kit change will make it really difficult for her to move across the map.
---
No, no, and no.
---
‚Äúshit PC‚Äù dude did your girlfriend just break up with your or something lmao calm down.
---
Scream and Ghostface are different properties.
---
playing survivor is 90 percent holding down one button
---
but aight
---
Theres a reason it was nerfed. 90% of perks dont get used and you want one of the most op ones to stay meta.
---
I played back during the toxic times, quit for other reasons (The ping, busted meta, lag, and general glitchiness), then came back a year later. I was so disappointed that survivors werent complaining, I started hunting the salt. I straight up ran insta-saw billy with and Ebony, and got GG‚Äôs after, I was confused xD
---
Does Behavior even play their own game? I feel like I wasted my money on Ash
---
Unfortunately I'm not sure about that one. I've seen people say it both does and does not, and it's not something I've tested
---
Probably lol
---
It's hard for them to find gloves?
---
Speaking about the pass is it 1000 auric cells or 2000 bc in the PTB ive seen its 1000 but I could've sworn they said it was 2000, genuine question!
---
Because money
---
Depends on the range. Could mean so you find survivors you woulda otherwise missed like in the corn or swamp.
---
I played with you earlier. I don't know if you were in the same lobby as me against the nurse, but she was invisible except for a red stain, and after 2 hooks she wasn't able to hook anyone again and quit.
---
what is this pig outfit? i don‚Äôt recognize it at all
---
Found the Killer main.
---
Hawkins has extremely bad loops where it's easy to destroy the Survivor. It's a Killer-sided map.
---
Makes sense you'd think Hawkins is "great map design" tho, Killer main.
---
1. Yes he is considered low tier. Lower rank he's viable, like every single killer, but in higher ranks he will absolutely struggle.
---
2. No, he has a shimmer. You can see him fairly easily. However if he stands still, he becomes completely invisible.
---
3. meh that's something you'd have to actually test. I don't think so because he still has to uncloak and you can hear his bell, but maybe with the right addons.
---
It's in the announcement as soon as you open the PTB
---
cosmetic advantage as it doesnt have the floating straps
---
Rewards for completing challenges are rift fragments and some bloodpoints. Rift fragments level up the rift and give you stuff like charms on the free track and cells and cosmetics on the paid track.
---
An hour a day on average seems fair.
---
You noticed the /s, right?
---
really hope his ass is visible on the back
---
PTB is live right now so you can see it all live.
---
The challenges range from healing people twice, or doing 2 gens, sacrificing 2 people etc. to Trapping people after they vault. And then the for mastery (the last challenge) they give you a challenge to do with a specific perk build.
---
Free Rift rewards are little charm trinkets and few meh to okay skins. Free ones are like 1 in 5-7 tiers, while in paid Rift you get 1-3  per tier.
---
Plus, if you buy the paid pass and get to tier 70 you get your money (1000 auric cells) back. They return it every 2-4 tiers by 25-50 increments in the paid tiers, so if you keep getting tier 70 every rift you can technically only pay once and that's it, the rest will be free.
---
Otzdarva is really good, Monto explains his perks and why he uses them so that's always good for beginners, TrueTalent.
---
I just dumped about a million bloodpoints into Spirit for Haunted Ground so be on the lookout for that.
---
Fungoose and Otzdarva are educational first streamers. Both have youtube and twitch content. I think Otz is more killer focused, while Fungoose is about 50/50.
---
premium? jesus christ I hope its not the majority, that would be a major rip off if so
---
JEFF IS LOVE, JEFF IS LIFE
---
all the better to choke me with
---
You bought the base game, if they‚Äôre still turning out new content it‚Äôs only fair to pay for said content. If you don‚Äôt want to spend money on new skins and killers/survivors then don‚Äôt. They still afford you the opportunity to unlock their skills with BS and you can still face the DLC killers and survivors. Not to mention they keep working to balance the game which you already payed for. And none of the content they‚Äôre coming out with is a make or break for a play style, it‚Äôs optional, we should be happy they‚Äôre still receptive to their community and still putting out content. Have an awesome day.
---
Why even take the bait?
---
ok ill put it simply. Running from killer = exciting. Chasing survivor as killer = boring
---
Or Vigo.
---
Is the standing still part of the ability useable in any way? I seem to get the idea that any second spent not looking for the survivors is a second wasted but it seems like a neat thing to have.
---
it was really really dark, which I felt didn't hit the right targets with a Halloween slasher movie. It was good, but like most remakes, put literally any killer there instead of Michael Myers and it works.
---
Ah, the way I usually avoid it is if I see them drop the cracker before I hit them I try to turn around towards a wall as quickly as possible. It usually works.
---
Considering it was part of a DLC that isnt free, yeah it kinda sucks that they nerfed it since people had to buy Ash. 
---
The only reason I see it was nerfed is bc of entitled killer mains who think they deserve 4k every game and cry when things dont go their way.
---
Now I know what your next argument will be so I have a question for you. 
---
Can you name 1 killer perk that you consider to be strong/meta that has been nerfed lately??
---
So they‚Äôve said some challenges will require the use of specific perks... is it possible that some of these challenges will be using specific perks on specific characters? That would really be a buzzkill, especially on survivor side....
---
Thanks. How much are the BP reward amounts?
---
Idk if I read it right but it seems like the purple one stage will give you a speed boost over 15 seconds. That might actually be better because you might be able to to not only prolong a chase but lose a killer completely.
---
This is why I bring mori! Lol this is great man I hope I can get that good at jukes.
---
It's my turn to be the killer dangnabbit!
---
This sounds amazing! 
---
I can‚Äôt wait! Thank you, Behavior, for this gift to all us lore nerds !
---
But what about the New nurse? Still viable For this tourney?
---
I played nancy just to get her teachables for Steve but with this cosmetic I might just full commit to Nancy. Also, new stranger things AND Halloween cosmetics?!? That's a hella win FOR BHVR and loss for my wallet lmao
---
Can we at least get that disgusting squelching noise from the canker plants on the generators for the event?
---
All these skins are lit. üî•
---
Btw. How do you play GF on big open maps like the farm and wreckers?
---
David clown skin
---
Just what every David mains need
---
Discordance, Blood Warden, Solidarity, Buckle Up
---
Noup. I'm all ears still showing aura
---
Yes. Mostly at endgame, I'd say. 
---
Let's say 1 survivor is left, hatch is open. You found the hatch, but have no clue where the survivor is. You can stand completely invisible on the hatch, and once the survivor runs up, you close it without them ever expecting it (you can close the hatch in cloak). This is the most useful situation it's used in I'm pretty sure.
---
what. no. survivor is 90 percent holding one button
---
Your mistake was using the word ‚Äúrequired‚Äù cause the rift pass is NOT required at all. You can still play the game just fine without having to spend any extra money. Everything is simply cosmetics only and doesn‚Äôt effect the main game. It‚Äôs a choice left up to the player and considering you spend $10 that you can earn back for simply playing the game and have 70 days to do it. Won‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs really bad until like December.
---
Derpy things survivors do: Dead Hard face first into walls. Trying to loop unsafe pallets. Missing every skill check. Baiting killer to the rest of their team. T-bagging and taunting before being instantly downed. Cleansing vs Plague then accusing hacks when she gets a free corrupt proc and goes wild. Getting in on Mori animations. Wasting pallets in utterly ridiculous ways.
---
The list could go on I'm sure.
---
Lol, see above.
---
Oh that sounds absolutely cruel i have to try it out
---
I hate when people mention reddit karma to others. It makes me want to downvote
---
Legit happened to me yesterday. I wiggled and they hit to hook twice but I didnt get the memo so they sacrificed me. Said they were gonna give me hatch but I struggled instead
---
They gave 2000 to make it so you go through the Pass faster I believe but it's 1000 I'm pretty sure
---
It‚Äôs a 1000!
---
nice projection buddy
---
I have yet to do it myself, but I've seen some clips of it and it is definitely cruel lol.
---
Jane
---
I mean, I AM the best
---
Never mind I missed that part of the thread, but I think the point can still stand, if you‚Äôre really really comfortable with her power you‚Äôll still be winning games
---
&gt;Can you name 1 killer perk that you consider to be strong/meta that has been nerfed lately??
---
Irrelevant, if they were as OP as Mettle of a man they should be nerfed. The only meta perks for killer are basically Ruin and BBQ and you can swap those off depending on the build. Literally every survivor ran MoM when it was good.
---
But then the other 10% of the time makes it more exciting then all of playing killer combined
---
Best DBD montage
---
haha its the same at my school :(((
---
&gt; ‚ÄúI havent seen one survivor use it since it got nerfed.‚Äù
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I kind of implied that I do play killer. 
---
do you think that survivors don't see other survivors perks lmao
---
Is the 2017 Halloween event music coming back? By far the best menu music :)
---
Does my progress in "the rift" carry on to live servers?
---
Is this actually a new skin?
---
new UR addon: billy can grind on railings to earn BPs
---
The hooker
---
can anyone explain what the objectives are for this event? i dont get it. do we just have to play normally lol. no objectives like with the lunar new year event?
---
You are strong in the ways of hitbox fuckery
---
Uh....dude? It's salt.
---
Hol up
---
The Halloween trailer is my favorite. I wish they would make them random as well.
---
You just sound extremely salty.. who would upvote this? 
---
Don‚Äôt take the bait from survivors who are obviously baiting.
---
i think so, saw it on dead by daylight leaks on twitter
---
please be aftercare please be aftercare please be aftercare
---
Similar experience here. A little bit of salt is an essential part of the DBD experience.
---
I remember that. Just had a game with a spirit with a global TR. She wasn't using Tinkerer but had Prayer Beads.
---
Hallowed blight nurse got one In battle pass
---
The day of the Dead ones seen unnecessary, but how can I bitch with all these new licensed ones like damn
---
More friendly animal masks for huntress, mime Clown, business suit for trapper, a group Legion cosmetic, and most importantly power cosmetics.
---
So that's why I get jumped by Ghostface 80% even with Dance with Me and Lithe.. Thanks
---
How many of these vials one can acquire from the rifts?
---
Yeah I personally dont think we will see too much of a difference with the base kit. A lot of people are thinking it's the end of nurse. I personally dont think so, itll just take some getting used to. Wont be able to fully judge though until the update goes into the live version, dont feel like downloading the ptb for nurse/archives. Lol
---
&gt; Can you name 1 killer perk that you consider to be strong/meta that has been nerfed lately??
---
I can name a couple *entire killers* who have been nerfed. does that count?
---
&gt; The only reason I see it was nerfed is bc of entitled killer mains who think they deserve 4k every game and cry when things dont go their way.
---
you're entitled to your feelings, but having a perk where you get endurance with no downside by doing jack shit is broken, and *extremely* OP when stacked
---
how the fuck could anyone have ever won against an swf all with MoM and instas? you couldn't
---
You spend $10 (1000 auric cells) on the battle pass, in the span of 70 days, if you play consistently, you gain 1000 auric cells from the battle pass meaning you can buy the next battle pass for free. If you‚Äôre not playing the game enough to feel like the battle pass is worth it then just don‚Äôt buy it, you‚Äôll still get some stuff from the free version of it.
---
Aye plus we got 3 new weapons for him a screw driver new knife and a pipe
---
After feedback they went back to special gens?
---
Who didn‚Äôt like the canker things last year cmon.
---
I love how later on they totally proved that they don't play killer. they could barely help screeching lmao
---
I think they mean glowing skin like ones that the Wraith and Huntress currently have in store. Many of the other killers are getting them in the upcoming event.
---
Here‚Äôs hoping the day of the dead collection is a hint towards a Mexican killer
---
She was pretty laggy, so it was probably just an internet dc
---
Ohhh ok thanks.
---
I want to see the charms actually do something
---
Don‚Äôt forget kindred!
---
It gives you Endurance which is like Borrowed Time.
---
imagine thinking this lmao
---
have you ever considered that maybe you're just a boring killer?
---
Definitely not 2018 Myers, since that's a jumpsuit and not a gown.
---
It appears to be an amalgamation of 1 and 4, much as Amanda's Test Subject skin is a combination of Saw 1 and 3. My reasoning for this is that one of Myers' new weapons appears to be the bar he impaled the mechanic with in Halloween 4, while wearing a gown.

---
This comment was made when I thought only the double blink would recharge, not each individual blink charge. Definitely not an 8 second addition and a bigger nerf than I realized.
---
I love how you did it! Very good job.
---
perk 1: life's hard enough: when near other survivors their cries are 50/60/75% quieter 
---
"life's hard enough as it is you don't want to cry anymore" - vince
---
perk 2: you can't open it up it's worthless: when you're in a locker hold control to make you invisible to the killer when they open it (this perk can only be used once per trial)
---
"forget about it, it's worthless" - vince
---
perk 3: stop having a boring life: you live for the thrills, when in a chase with the killer for 40/30/20 seconds you gain a token, each token increases bloodpoint gain by 25% and 4% for your teammates 
---
"what an amazing offer" - the entity
---
What? Hag went from nothing to one of the 3 queens of DBD. Spirit on her initial release wasn't as strong as she is now. Both Wraith and Trapper were made better, even if it wasn't enough.
---
Hell Doctor right now was a result of his first rework back in 1.6.2. The random skill check location wasn't originally part of his base kit, there used to be a speed penalty when changing stances, and it shock therapy used to not block actions when you hit some one with it.
---
Ahhh interesting. Does it make you have to mend yourself if you get hit? Cause borrowed time doesn‚Äôt have anything about endurance status effect.
---
Blue hair Susie is life
---
You can give yourself the BT though.
---
cool so only a week for the event? can we have an event for more than a week pls
---
It's a sign, dont touch the nurse
---
Put the yellow mori in every game as base kit for lols. Remove the game changing nonsense of the red / green moris
---
Me too
---
Song: spooky scary skeletons ;)
---
See id say this was a great render but why in the H E double hockey sticks have that giant ass watermark blocking it? Seriously make it tinier or just rotate it and put it somewhere else

---
or are you just playing dumb?

I'm explaining why your comment doesn't imply you play killer, because someone who only plays survivor could say that exact same thing
---
I hope they do this.

ohhh you just suck

---
I don't know if nurse even was a nerf. It's definitely a nerf to omega blink, no-addons and the multi-blinks, but she has some really powerful add-ons now that don't require you to relearn her blinks.
---
Catatonic Boy's Treasure and Metal Spoon both seem pretty good, and while it looks like a meme bloodpoint one I could see Anxious Gasp be used in builds that don't have any detection perks (if you hate yourself enough to play nurse without one)
---
Me kicking a pallet: üò´ü•¥
---
Your point about less observant players makes a lot of sense. I could definitely see people getting pissed that they couldn't tell I was sneaking up on them.
---
There is a perk called all ears. Maybe they were using that?

---
Gah. The shirt is too long. I want my sexy Myers
---
Ah because i put the first part as getting outrun you assume thats what happens a lot. I dont play killer often so when i do its at like yellow ranks where i 4k every game.
---
You've never seen a good nurse? I play on ps4 and have seen some truly terrifying nurses. I promise they exist.
---
Naa, just 3 seconds in total to get the 2 blink... not a big deal.
---
And also her add-ons were buffed overall in my opinion outside the two THAT builds that nobody really ran that often anyway. 
---
I don't know about you guys but that Catatonic Boy's Treasure and Metal Spoon both seem pretty spicy.

PLEASE get better PS4 servers. I couldn‚Äôt play at all during the last one.
---
Most broken patch yet?  I just had a game with an unreal desync with Nurse.  Literally every hit on a survivor came from 20 ft away and she was unable to hook most of the time.

Was her base walking speed increased?

---
Because you said that particular quote of yours implies you play killer when it doesn't at all, because a person who only plays survivor can say the same thing because survivors are aware of other survivors perks
---
I can feel your little brain overheating btw
---
hex: devour hope, make your choice, left behind, saboteur
---
Tbh, it will be **VERY** weird to see a Myers with a different cosmetic. 
---
I'm so used to his normal looks it will be weird seeing him stalking me suddenly half naked. But I'm fucking here for it.
---
Time is not on your side as a killer and the recharge also pauses as you charge a blink. Also it's 3 second recharge per blink so it takes about 1 second after fatigue before you can blink once and you gotta wait 3 more seconds to be back at full strength.
---
Are you planning on replying to anyone else who totally proved you wrong, or nah? Just gonna ignore it?
---
This was already on r/leaksbydaylight and without the big ass watermark
---
You get a sense for trap placement over time, the basics of course is to place them at loops near the pallets or vaults (Quick note, at first stay away from the addons that increase trap range and Rusty Shackles as these change your trap placement). Key travel paths are great but a little harder to identify, look for natural choke points generated by map randomisation, direct lines between key locations like gens and unique map structures etc (these are more effective with the aforementioned trap range increase addons, but still work at base). Really important is to not spread yourself too thin, choose a decent portion of the map and trap it up and don't pay much attention to the rest.
---
Perks are great, no issue there.
---
Check the PS4 store
---
Verify your liscences mate you should be fine.
---
But you brought shadow dance addons right?
---
She is still top tier, just less braindead and with more build options
---
Myers with tombstone and vanity mirror. For extra spice stay in evil within 1.
---
As a Bubba main and an Amanda stan, I feed off nerfs to fuel my low tier existence
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Yeah, that's what I said! Sodium Chloride.
---
Why Laurie? WHY?

From what I know, yes

Yeah but he was a bit of an asshole like his dad

If "never touched" means "never used any add-ons or game slowing perks in red ranks" then you're right.

---
As I said my calculations were a rough estimate, though they shouldn't be *that* far off. Im guessing further levels of the Tome (II, III, IV) have harder challenges with higher fragment rewards, then. That wouldn't surprise me. I assumed all were the same for the sake of simplicity, but of course that can be incorrect since we have yet to see the other levels.
---
So you‚Äôre gonna take it out on other survivors just because of a reddit post? Makes sense.
---
Killers that disobey physics &gt; killers that obey physics.
---
I'm... Not very enthusiastic about the length of the event. Will that *really* be enough time for people to level up the Rift enough to get all the Serum?
---
Slick coat, cool floating fabric, sweet knife, awesome mask. You ghosted ghoasty boi hard.
---
Hellllllllllllllll no. Shit was obnoxious as hell for anyone playing an m1 killer.
---
Speaking of Undetectable and those specific perks, has there been any thought on changing Insidious since the game now punishes the very thing Insidious was created to do? Changing the perk to make the Killer immune to/trigger at reduced distances and for less time would probably be the best thing to do for it.
---
You bought 5 nodes before picking up a perk and the entity consumed the one you wanted? If so, the error is you.
---
Technically the Hag already uses her hands. Sure its not punching but its still hands and still new hand cosmetics.
---
You should get green tripe it's really good if you want more pressure with your portals
---
No but she has 2 addons one where she blink-hits a survivor she gets 115% movement speed for 60 sec and the other who makes her 110% fast
---
How did I get caught being full of shit? I play killer and survivor. Im not a main like you clearly are.  Losers like you are what hold this toxic community in its place honestly. Please dont tell me, with all of your comments here, that you‚Äôre not the least bit self-righteous. Does acting the way you are on this thread give you the strength to go on? Lmao
---
I don't think you understand good sir I need the BIG PUNCH
---
I hate how I cant save this I have a friend that mains dwight and he plays just like this
---
This is me still when I see it. This is me 10min into a Hag match after getting scared multiple times all match
---
Otz and Sally proving that you can still end someone‚Äôs whole career after a nerf.
---
Low ranks means red rank right?
---
Demo addons
---
oh so you never played killer ,good to know
---
No like. I get it. But, hear me out, why don't we just change the Hat's attacks to punches and her Mori to literally beating the pulp out of survivors.
---
Maybe it is me and I find him useless atm, have no problem with any other killer but him his lunge is fucking slow as shit
---
Oh. You meant low as in Numerical value. Not Skill. I see now.
---
Please just remove Ebony Moris. It's game breaking and the number 1 cause of getting survivors to DC during a load screen.
---
At least just make it so each survivor has to be hooked twice first. Simple.
---
Checked out the PTB, Nurse is immune to spine chill after hitting someone.
---
Pig is immune.
---
Wraith is immune.
---
Demogorgon is still immune despite having reported it during that PTB.
---
Spine chill is 100% not working with undetectable.
---
Amen
---
I'm wondering the same..
---
"Pog" is an emote you can only see if you install the BetterTTV or FrankerFaceZ extension on your browser. It's bascially PogChamp but zoomed in on the mouth.
---
You could link it to him, but at the moment you could bookmark/ "save" it for anytime you can show him
---
That's what I said! Sodium chloride.
---
Yes when it gets to the purple and red ranks he completely useless his attacks his 90% dodgeable its crazy
---
lol, nice conclusion
---
Legions add-ons are getting changed after Nurses, which is good.
---
He was probably shirtless under those sheets
---
Ah a man of culture

No dude, it's salt. If you don't know what salt is, maybe mop duty is too complicated for you.

Enduring,Spirit Fury, since ghostface is just a m1 killer that can sometimes mindgame it means he's gonna eat alot of pallets so having those 2 will make your life easier, Nurses Calling works pretty well on him too. So basically just run a m1 killer build

Goddamit he's up again, I took care of him last time can someone else please feed him?  He likes his formula slightly room temperature as he's teething and the cold bothers his little teeth.  Afterwards be sure to burp thoroughly and remember to turn on his Spongebob Mobile.  He loves that thing.

Groups just create circlejerks. I've been in groups where people shat on randoms in games and then shun others for doing so when they weren't playing with the group. A lack of individuality breeds this maybe idfk.

Wtf are you calling me an idiot for? The DBD version is based off of the 2010 remake where he is indeed a pedophile

**Normal Game**: That's ok

Played Nurse, actually not that bad, but addon reliant to be as good as she used to be :/
---
And may the fog be kind to you as well

But our boy is getting his OG outfit, so he‚Äôs good

Really good headphones. I hear rusty creak of the locker

I wonder if he'll have the bandages on his face or not

Agreed except I think he belongs in a tier with the others who kill without emotion.

Ghostface took a vacation to the upside-down

Are you talking about the nurse changes? Those are only on the ptb which is on the ptb

Does it work on reddit? I see so many people comment it on r/LivestreamFail  and I‚Äôm just cringing how they write it out
---
I think. Wasn‚Äôt there an update today? I was looking at Aaron‚Äôs recent video but the ptb isn‚Äôt showing up on my game
---
Point for like your skin, follow me for chase me, T-bag for hello, heal me and thanks
---
No, because the auric cell rewards are in the Premium track of the Rift which you have to pay to enter. If you finish them all, you‚Äôll get the same amount back that it cost to enter it
---
Nancy.
---
She reminds me of the little girl from the movie 'us'
---
It went from a top survivor perk to trash in an instant lol
---
Nice SNL reference, OP. Lol
---
I honestly don't blame you, I've recently played a ton (like a fuck ton) of huntress and OoO absolutely breaks huntress (especially on the badham and haddonfield fences)
---
No, nothing in the PTB does. It‚Äôs just for testing, you‚Äôll have to buy access to the Premium Track when it goes live
---
Wraith looks like an absolute witch doctor I love it. Also love that smiths grove Myers skin
---
Ptb(player test build) is only for pc
---
I‚Äôve had only my friend experience this a handful of times, and we play on console. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs most likely a bug that has yet to be fixed.
---
Ohh. Thanks for the clarification. I would‚Äôve been waiting all day.
---
Wtf
---
have... have you guys not noticed the paid skins before
---
Balanced Landing, Autodidact, Dying Light, Shadowborn.
---
But what about the archives?
---
What are you getting at? I've watched the movie, I didn't like it but I liked the way mikey looked. Please explain what's "confusing".
---
Dude i wanna smooch them both
---
All time favourite post. Ever.
---
3 seconds for a nerf can make the killer being high tier at worst, rn nurse I think still the best killer
---
No, you'd have to get another extension called "Global Twitch Emotes" for that to work. Don't worry I'm cringing too but I think that's just how the internet operates these days.
---
You know it‚Äôd be kind of dumb to sue a game company, as they require money to keep the game running as well as the servers. Yes they should be supporting color blind people buts thats a little drastic isn‚Äôt it?
---
Now Myers will be the one getting stalked
---
Is she still slower than survivors though? Or did BHVR actually give her a bone to work with?
---
Not funny
---
Didn‚Äôt laugh
---
i'm not making it out to be awful at all. That's your own interpretation but it is a small nerf nonetheless.
---
Part of their settlement would probably be instituting a color blind mode.
---
Agreed, probably why I didn't enjoy it. Halloween to me is more about mikey rather than what he does.
---
We may not have gotten him shirtless but we got his glistening thighs and I think we should see this as an absolute win
---
Seems for the most part pretty spot on.
---
At least link the clip of DK you slacker
---
Lol, is that supposed to be an insult? Every map has bad loops, it's up to you to use the good ones, durr. Hawkins is absolutely a great map. The huge maps are so boring. Doo doo head
---
Not Stonks.
---
Lmao the woke up party was good
---
I gave him a spin today, should I be concerned that all the hooks on the map had turned into t-posing killers?
---
Iron Will's always been meta though, hasn't it? Spirit compounds that yes but it's still powerful against most killers except plague
---
Yes, a little exaggerated, I had a couple Myers games in there. But I have a spreadsheet where I track my games, escapes, deaths, what killers I face etc. 
---
Since last Friday, Spirit has by far been the most common killer I‚Äôve faced, making up about 60% of my games. Occasionally I‚Äôll get Myers, Ghostface, Legion or a pig.
---
Yeah basically stalking them saves you having to hit them once. But stalking them a) wastes time b) alerts them that youre there c) doesnt give you a thanataphobia stack and d) doesnt make them heal. Not to mention that if they manage to loop you the whole time theyre exposed then the whole thing was pointless anyway. Why not just abuse the fact that you can play him exactly like wraith without having to go through the bing bongs?
---
Instead of Nurses you could run any tracking perk to help find survivors a little easier. Nurses is the best because everytime it goes off when you're in stealth it's literally a free down. But things like Surveilance, Discordance would synergize really well because they make it easier to find people on gens. If nothing else just going with Dying Light or Pop Goes the Weasel for more slowdown is still pretty good. I'd avoid Brutal Strength, Bamboozle or things like that because the whole point of the build is to avoid extended chases as much as possible.
---
How do you identify your obsession? Are you just supposed to memorize names jn the lobby?
---
Shouldn't it be change Za Worldo?
---
It‚Äôs how the entity rewords them one Raman cup for each dead survivor
---
They are nerfing her slightly but she will still be the top killer. Basically instead of just the exhaustion looking down and then immediately having 2 blinks, they have the exhaustion then a time period where each blink is able to be used again. 3 seconds per blink is what I‚Äôve heard. So after your exhaustion you‚Äôd have to wait 6 seconds for your 2 blinks to be available. 3 seconds for one blink to be available. Add ons obviously 9 seconds or 12 seconds etc. If I understood that wrong and someone can correct me, feel feee to do so.
---
Not true. The point of the cosmetics is to horrifically transform the killer. You could turn Legion into whatever
---
Right??? It did look like he knew what he was doing! LMFAO!!!!
---
Yeah but it wasn't her base kit that was the problem. Against a bade kit nurse you can counter her if you know how to play her. Like how to be unpredictable which includes how to use jungle gyms to keep the nurse guessing where you were going, how to fake vaults and how to change up the way you run so she can't predict you. I'm leaving certain tricks out because they sound stupid except they work and don't feel like having my comment be disregarded because of it.
---
Her problem was her add-ons like multiple blinks, which didn't punish nurses when they messed up, or omega blink which made it impossible to prepare yourself with a chase with nurse because she could blink across the map. Her add-ons definitely needed change.
---
The problem is with her base kit change. her base kit change basically will make it impossible to down a good survivor no matter how good the nurse is. The cool down makes it so if you're tryna catch up to a survivor you can't. By the time she gets catches up at least 30 seconds will go by and if the survivor is any decent and able to juke you hell be able to get enough distance to start the cycle again. And you do get a hit hell get the speed boost and and itll be even worse. 
---
What they should do is keep the base kit the same, but instead of add-ons that make nurse stronger, they should make the add-ons just change how the nurses power works or changes her playstyle. 
---
I'm saying this as an ex nurse main and a 1 year survivor main. Literally nurse is my favorite killer to go against because she makes it feel like a different game, things that are safe against certain killers are unsafe against her, and things that are mindgameable against other killers are strong against her (if you can consistently mindfuck her).
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zQawXvCd-fs
---
Also, the time required to complete the battle pass isn't half bad either. They said about 80 hours max if you complete the lore challenges.
---
Yall remember when you could tell what killer it was by the hook decal.
---
Right, nurses basekit was fine. It was her add-ons that broke her.
---
It‚Äôs all said here, just scroll to the bottom.

It's based off Daniel Rigg. He wears a Pig Mask for a bit in SAW 4. The short hair is super cute though oh my god
---
Thana and Fire Up are combo piece perks. The reason why they‚Äôre underwhelming on their own is because with other perks that do a similar job, you get a much greater effect. For Thana, running sloppy butcher, new Dying Light, running it with Freddy or Plague and their natural slowdown effects, Legion with their inherent ‚Äúalways injured‚Äù effects only enhance its effect and supplement other stronger perks like Pop or Ruin or even lullaby. 
---
Fire Up is special because at best it‚Äôs a discount Bamboozle and Brutal Strength and there‚Äôs less that it has synergy with but unless you give it a brand new effect, it can‚Äôt be straight buffed. It‚Äôll outclass both intensely. 
---
I‚Äôm all ears is what it is. It is a niche perk that can help you in chases on some walls or track survivors who scatter. It can‚Äôt exactly be buffed outside of a duration increase/Cooldown reduction so unless it too got a brand new effect, it‚Äôs fine rather than it being bloated. 
---
Predator is pretty ass. One of the vast tracking perks that‚Äôs okay on a good day and hilariously unsynergstic on a bad day. Again this is a ‚Äúeither give it a new effect or bloat it to step on another perk‚Äôs area‚Äù kinda perk. Not much you can do with it. Tbh all of Wraith‚Äôs perks are very okay. Nothing special or write home worthy but they do their own job so it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre in dire need. Now Insidious and Shrine. Those are actually terrible and if I had to pick a killer perk to even focus on reworking I‚Äôd start from the bottom and come up.
---
Lol i love the idea of a poor man's prayer beads yoinking build
---
So true.
---
Wheres my Quentin skin
---
I found the ma'am.
---
I mean all people of all genders work that way when it comes to what they can conceptualize, our brains aren't any different in most psychological respects.
---
1. Wraith can dominate in low ranks, but he becomes completely unviable in green ranks or higher.
---
2. Only when standing still
---
3. The Wraith needs buffs but I don‚Äôt think that would be the way to do it
---
Thats only pc atm kinda like demo. The full release will probably be out on the 22nd oct because dbd confirmed halloween event is coming out 22nd. BUMMER for me too im ps4
---
i'd repeat what i just said but that is pointless
---
You have a lot of potential - just work on learning how to accurately draw boobs ... please
---
Nurse was made back in the day when the game was so extremely survivor sided that she was the killer created to counter that. As the game has become more balanced, she has become more powerful. Will be interesting to see how this goes. She will still be the top killer in my opinion.
---
Can we wait before we even get ample testing with PBE before people throw around stuff like "she's gutted" "she's bottom tier now", I mean lets be realistic, this change isn't suddenly making Nurse worse than Bubba or Wraith. It just makes it so she isn't completely unbeatable now.
---
Wtf toxic
---
Tryhards who play killer so they can ruin the game for others, you mean by playing killers that can actually kill survivors and don‚Äôt rely on them being retards?

And to alter or make new agreements they‚Äôd have to deal with the same people for 4 &amp; 5 stuff as the people they deal with in regards to the stuff that‚Äôs already in the game.
---
Fact: they deal with the company that controls 4&amp;5. They do not deal with Universal (2, 3 and ‚Äò18) or Miramax (6, 7 &amp; 8) or the Weinstein Company (the Zombie films) so stuff from 4 &amp; 5 is inherently more accessible  than the other entries.

Again: they got the rights from 1 from the same people who own 4 &amp; 5.

Straight to the point I see!

ye, I know.

guys lets be honest nurse is still good after the rework
---
Nurse originally had 3 blinks on release, not sure when that got changed but when I started playing again (spirit release) she had 2

Yes, she's still slower at base. There are add ons that increase her movement speed though.
---
So many players just mindlessly approach killers the same way instead of tailoring a playstyle around their kit.  These are the same people that convinced the community Hag was trash tier for the longest time.
---
If you want to go fast use hillbilly with doom and death engravings on autohaven, coldwind
---
I see a lot of people saying that the struggle mechanic isnt fun or call it annoying, but I think that is the wrong mindset to have. I definitely understand how it could be unfun, but spamming X (on PS4) while shouting at my squad that i cant hold on much longer can be one of the most intense moments in the game for me. 
---
Id recommend immersing yourself in the game a little more if you really dislike the mechanic, such as seeing it as your punishment from the entity for being hooked, and the fact that its only using one claw to attack you is just the entity feeding off of your hope even further! You struggle with hand cramps as your character struggles with fending off a spider claw. 
---
If this still doesnt help you enjoy the mechanic, its no big deal, personal opinions are something we all have. I just hope this helps some people see the great design behind this mechanic, and use it to immerse themselves in the realm of the entity even further
---
Michael, he gets his own chase music, his prestige stuff looks awesome, he's pretty easy to play while being fun and effective too and well it's fucking Michael myers
---
Wasn‚Äôt GF undetectable in stalk mode anyway? They‚Äôre just now adding an indicator onscreen is what I gathered from that.
---
Left behind op with a key though
---
Ooh yuck. I thought the point of the changes were to change The fact that her base kit was trash and add ons broke her.
---
Agreed. I don't get this sub one day I'm browsing through and its everyone complaining about killers being OP and nurse and spirit need nerfed and then boom nurse gets nurfed and it's people complaining about her getting nurfed. I think people only come on here to complain which explains why you only ever see one side. They fixed the issue everyone was complaining about of her having too many blinks
---
No, most of them are completely new outfits. There are like 2 or 3 recolors.
---
I think it does if you look in the bottom right, there's like a frazzled strip of cloth. It might just be the fuzzy image though.
---
The uniboob.
---
But where‚Äôs Quentin??
---
What would the benefit of waiting to be pulled out if you have the same speed debuff as just wading through it?
---
I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôre going to give his chainsaw a time limit or something along the lines of that so you can‚Äôt infinitely loop the map without Cooldown
---
Too good. I'd face camp the crap out of you!
---
Don't have to sue for money
---
or allow it to get charges with safe saves like We're Gonna Live Forever
---
It's really not that bad, keep in mind that the challenges you do (which are like "kick 3 generators") also help with progression.
---
The channels Not Otzdarva and PainReliever are two of my favorite players. Otz has big brain and PainReliever is good at the game
---
Don't feed the troll, mate.
---
We need shaggy as a survivor
---
Otz is fucking *Big Brain*
---
Alright, in that case I apologize. I got a different impression from your message.
---
When you chase them the bones around their name start shaking. Also if you hit pause you can see their usernames and who they are playing so that can be helpful.
---
Spirit/myers/pig
---
Probably vigo
---
Oof, gotcha. How much playtime, roughly, would it take to get your cells back? Or is there no way to tell yet?
---
When does it start for console, XBox specifically?
---
Chapter 14 there is supposed to be some sort of map rework so here's hoping.
---
So you'd rather pay $30 for three different skins than pay $10 for 20,000 auric cells worth of skins, etc? I will never understand this mindset. The Rift is an inconsequential addition to a great game. If rewards people who want more to do than just the same thing every day.
---
I've been maining Myers until last night; I played Spirit for the first time, and holy fuck is she good! Easy 4K in less than 5 minutes with no perks or add-ons. 
---
Legion's look is very cool, but they are weak killers. Very weak. It's worth a try though! I'd say just play a few and see who you like the best.
---
Also, this guy does "Entity Education" videos, where he covers every killer, in great detail! I recommend checking him out!!!
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo4SN-APijdk8Fve6rZvjWg
---
Idk if it‚Äôs just me but the styptic looks way better than the syringe. Styptic gives borrowed time but the syringe is just kinda meh. It didn‚Äôt say anywhere that it still does 2 health states it just says it passively heals you. Styptic looks better unless I read it wrong
---
Wading through it causes a stronger speed debuff while being pulled out causes it to be smaller
---
It's so obvious, survivors wont think to look there! It's the perfect plan!
---
They‚Äôll probably do a new one for the event
---
I would mori you for not using scoops ahoy Steve, standard Steve is violating company policy and needs to be punished
---
Because we just got one.
---
Ghostface and demogorgon, ghostface for stealthy gameplay and mind games (and sweet cosmetics) for the demogorgon fun abilities and generally good
---
I mean it was warranted. MoM was completely busted. Any perk that is run 100% of the time by 100% of players should rightfully be thrown in the trash.
---
Are the numbers randomly generated? Because 7 seconds wtf. I had one for nurse that was 180 seconds and it was 45,000 blood points.
---
I also had a Trapper ritual with one-third the amount of beartraps needed, and it gave double what's in your picture.
---
Huntress, pig, Fred, Mike, good boy, and ghost face
---
Seriously? LOL!
---
but... but Ghostface;-;
---
Ghostface isn't the fastest, but his ability to drop to 0 terror radius and no red stain mid chase is invaluable.
---
Since these are so old they may have glitched. I assume these are how the daily‚Äôs used to work with that piss poor blood points.
---
Her rework wasn‚Äôt necessary at all. She was fine the way she was.
---
It's on both sides dude calm down. Its killers right now because of the nurse nerf. The community as a whole is bitchy which kinda sucks but its understandable sometimes games are literally out of your control and it doesn't matter how well you play.
---
What does Myers do exactly? The wiki says something about obsessions.
---
Wait... so are these contained within the ‚Äúpass,‚Äù or are these upcoming shop skins purchasable for cells?
---
I'm a rare Plague main. She's pretty fun to play, for me at least
---
When I play GhostFace and someone has OoO I seriously just feel like the game is over for me, 10x moreso if it seems like they're SWF. That perk specifically destroys him, but hopefully the PBE changes go though to live so it wont work on him in night shroud.
---
ye cause nurse and instaheals were the most loved mechanic in the game lol
---
My only real concern is the timeframe. 11 days is pretty tight for an even to earn everything. Hopefully I can get a lot of games in through the weekend and off work but even if I had full time like a streamer, I think it‚Äôs gonna be a short timeframe.
---
I could get behind that too
---
I run Dying Light, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, and Thrilling Tremors. When I get Surge on Ghostface I‚Äôll be replacing Sloppy with that, because I‚Äôve heard that Surge is actually really good on the slew they bois
---
just like isntaheal now means nothing. and bnp means nothing. i don't mean these are/were not op, but it could happen to ebony too.
---
I was very confused for a second and thought dwigh just deadass capped ghostface
---
Uphill both ways. In the blistering cold.
---
This is just too adorable im sorry.
---
How the hell are we gonna get the serum in such a short time
---
Wraith, Doctor, and Ghostface
---
Demo too, and Hag to a lesser extent (unless you use mint rag) and Freddy til the gens are done. Seeing as Freddy and Demo are effectively the 2 newest killers and they both address mobility issues others killers have, I think that is a sign the Devs are now more conscious of that aspect of designing well rounded killers.
---
Lots of legions should upvote this idea
---
OG GHOSTFACE NANCY AND STEVE IN THEIR KICKASS OUTFITS LAURIE KSJRHRH
---
Aw *fuck* yeah.
---
Well how do you play him? I feel it's easier to help someone if they say what they do when playing the killer. Do you place portals on generators? Do you use your lunge in open areas? Etc etc
---
They are giving reworks for Mori‚Äôs more time. They have to find some comfortable mix that also doesn‚Äôt allow the survivors to get windmilled on first hook but also doesn‚Äôt devalue the bloodpoints you spend for your Mori. Especially the yellow ones that are just a waste.

Very smart. Thank you. The game was unplayable last year's event.

Does the same apply to all killer perks that are run by killers 100% of the time?
---
Steve is 8 ft tall
---
This happened to me the other day. I was playing trapper, and someone sprung a bear trap. I ran to it immediately, and saw the survivor just get off it by himself. I chased him around a circle a bit, but there was no LOS, as it was a huge wall. I saw the scratches so I thought I was chasing him still. Then I saw him get healed at the bottom left. Found out he was literally across the map. Rank 20 killer :(
---
Purple is gonna be better than pink is seems but we need to see the full usability.
---
I mean I think Spirit is a perfectly fine Killer to play against... if she's not using Prayer Beads. Gen-Grabber spirit definitely needs looking at, but I think changing her base power might be a touch too ar.
---
High rank games are in the survivors advantage rn. You're over reacting. Calm down and make a concise point against the nerf and people might take you seriously. Sarcasm at the level of an 8 year old isn't going to get you anything.

Occasionally I'll bust out some meme games.  My favorite is probably Chest Protector Bubba.  I only down you if you touch my chest.  You're free to meme around with me in the basement otherwise.  Anyone hooked after trying to touch my things (MY CHEST!) is the only person I kill.  Anyone downed attempting to save this little chest thief is carried upstairs and dropped to be picked up and frolic with their friends.  Post game I have received some of the most wholesome chats of my DBD tenure doing these memes.  I've had swf's messaging me laughing hysterically thanking me for the game telling me I made their night with that shit.
---
???????????
---
I agree, it should get the BNP treatment and just destroy the add-on
---
I just need to know if there will be any cosmetics 100% locked behind PAID tier Rifr progression that will be unattainable when the Rift ends.
---
300 IQ
---
Yeah man you didn‚Äôt know on reddit if you disagree with something you obviously don‚Äôt play the side
---
I don't own any of the DLC, so I've been using The Wraith 99% of the time when I play killers. He's definitely not the best, but he is absolutely number 1 in terms of having fun by yourself. You can just ring your bell and fuck with survivors over and over.
---
If I had access, some of the DLC characters I'd love to try are def The Pig, Legion, and demo doggo.
---
it's max 25% tho
---
Exactly
---
Billy. 
---
Zoom zoom.
---
Decisive is that way. So is BBQ and Ruin. Unless they‚Äôre trying something new.
---
So the Bottle and the Syringe are useless now? Survivors can't have good addons, ffs.
---
Head On is just so fun to use tho lol
---
Name one. Ruin doesn't count, as it isn't anywhere *near* as powerful as MoM was. And BBQ is only used for bloodpoints. NOED can be countered by not ignoring totems. There is no killer perk in the game that was *anywhere* as close to being as busted as Pre-Nerf MOM.
---
Ayy I was in that game
---
Not the commenter but Myers is able to stalk victims to point where he can one shot them(tier 1 is when you start out and you're slower then usual, tier 2 is achieved by stalking someone making you move faster and have a red stain and for tier 3 you get the instadown effect for 60ish seconds)
---
Tenacity has been on the shrine loads of times, so I'll say that.
---
For the others, I guess I'll say Bamboozle, Brutal Strength, and Technician.
---
I don't know what exactly it is but even noobs nearly kill everyone. It's more annoying if they camp or tunnel because then it's like going from difficult to near impossible.
---
Okay I edited the post reread agian
---
Why did you run past the jungle gym into a dead zone? The 360 was nice and all but you wouldn‚Äôt have had to in the first place if you got to a place you could loop
---
I'm fine with Decisive, personally. It's easily countered by just... not picking the person up. MoM had no counterplay to it, as it protected survivors from the one thing the killer *has* to do to win the game. The only way to stop MoM when it was stacked was to grab someone off a Gen, Locker, Save, or Vault, which don't happen reliably.
---
I am of the confused can someone please explain
---
I‚Äôd love to see a doctor rework that added a bunch more madness effects
---
Illusory doctors that run at you. Maybe a rare add on that allows the doctor to send an illusory doctor like Mirage in Apex Legends
---
A fake generator spawns on the map, and every 60 seconds it disappears while another fake generator spawns somewhere else. The fake generator can never be completed, and any progress put into the fake generator is lost the moment it vanishes
---
Illusory pallets as part of his base kit
---
Illusory Hex totems
---
And so on. It could be that these are all part of his base kit, or these are all their own addons. To balance out these being base kit, there might be additional levels of madness, and there might be a mechanic for survivors to decrease their madness level over and over (decay over time, madness steadily goes away when hiding in lockers, survivors can Snap Out Of It over and over, killer objects in the map similar to Freddy‚Äôs alarm clocks that can reduce survivor madness, things like that)
---
His power has three tiers. Tier 1: undetectable status effect meaning you have no terror radius, which is the heartbeat that survivors hear, slower movement speed, reduced lunge(where you hold down the attack button to gain a quick burst of speed and then hit). Tier 2: Moderately decreased terror radius (I think its 16 metres iirc), normal movement speed, normal lunge. Tier 3: lasts 60 seconds by default(can be increased by add ons), survivors suffer from the exposed status effect(so you can one shot them from any health state, healthy or injured), greatly increased lunge (I have curved corners with this thing I'm telling you  it's crazy), tier 3 reverts to tier 2 after its run out. To go up the tiers you must stalk the survivors by holding down the power button while looking at them, it also gives them a slight outline so can be used as a tiny bit of help when tracking but is mainly for getting up tiers.
---
The madlad the legend
---
No. They should have either made it 2 tokens to activate in its current state, or made it so safe hook rescues count towards it but maybe made it 4 tokens. 
---
Original MoM was annoying af.
---
This was literally me an hour ago with a claudette and me just trying to be a friendly pig to a toxic flashlight flickering rank 19

"Yeah, it's suffering time"
---
That‚Äôs okay, it was a very minor mistake and I understood what you meant! Your actual description was completely correct though, so there‚Äôs always good news.
---
Ye, you've just gotta play normally but complete the event gen or hook on the event hooks to get the serum
---
I've seen plenty of good players escape against Spirits before, both from survivor and killer side of things. Yes she takes more effort to play around, but people like to complain about her because she's more mind-gamey than other killers. With Nurse you can see her charging blink, with Huntress you can see her winding up her hatchets. With Spirit, you can hear her phase walk. 
---
I think she's perfectly fine without prayer beads. IMO Prayer Beads should only *reduce* the noise her phase walk makes, not remove it completely.
---
as if the pig didnt have enough nerfs already, next nerf gonna require the pig to hit survivors 4 times to down someone
---
Was just in a game with three stack survive with friends, all with insta heal on haddonfield. As wraith btw.
---
Bullshit how console gets This nerf. The learning curve with nurse is so high. I‚Äôm especially salty because I sunk so much time to master her on console and now she‚Äôs getting worse? Super lame
---
That would be awesome. Give her white eyes like spirit and maybe alter the RBT so that it looks a little more visually pleasing/she cant ever take it off. 
---
But...will this interfere with Piggy's S-tier stun noise?
---
I was trying to finish the game as fast as possible because it was like 1 at night and I was really tired so I wasn‚Äôt caring that much on if I died or escaped
---
They also said 80% of cosmetics would be available through playing, but didn't mention that it would end up so that of the good-looking cosmetics, only around 30-40% are. So chances are all the best stuff will be locked in the Rift. And then I guess at some point hit the stores, at a probably even higher price point.
---
Note: I don't care so much about cosmetics. In fact, I find that all the work and resources that have been put into cosmetics are in a stark, disappointing contrast to the gameplay-improving and refreshing efforts, of which there are very little. And now they want to go into cosmetic overdrive, and also expand majorly upon the lore. When they seemingly can't even manage to make dedicated servers work, which I am by now at a point of just hoping won't make the game worse, since I have given up hope they could make it better. After all this, I doubt that BHVR will touch servers again once they've made them run kind of acceptably well, fearing another fiasco. And that would mean they will never take advantage of the actual upsides servers could bring with them (first and foremost getting rid of the host latency advantage, having server-side hit detection/validation, and lag compensation), and it will be at best equal to P2P.
---
Such insane requests for cosmetics. Why not give her an orange cone on her head that squeaks so survivors know she‚Äôs coming. Be realistic please.
---
It technically is.
---
I've said it before but Ghost Face having abilities that "copy" popular killers is actually accurate to the character we see in the Scream movies.
---
Now if only the Pig could be good.
---
This is in fact not the case when they‚Äôre all by the exit gates
---
Legit same, They shouldnt touch her base kit, I personally think I have spent between 15-20mill bloodpoints on murse
---
Mix of each.
---
holy shit.
---
Is steam in offline mode?
---
100 percent dude I‚Äôm P3 nurse on ps4 and still leveling her
---
Did you read the patch notes? The thing that nurse players are complaining about is not the addons, honestly I think the addons are a welcome change.
---
The problem (and this has been tested by streamers already) is that she literally cannot keep up with survivors with the new cooldown system if they run in a straight line away from her after she either hits them or misses them. With this is also a complete loss of map pressure.
---
Honestly she did need a nerf and the addon change is welcome, but the recharge bit is what is going to kill her if it isn't at least tweaked. 
---
H
---
Ghostface when you use stalk and get hits gives a lot of points and Demogorgon's shred gives a lot as well. Any killer that you can effectively prevent a rushed game with can give you near max points. BBQ can double your bp every match. Its important to try to chase, hook and break pallets/kick gens as much as possible to maximize gains.

Trapper, It's not high tier but it's hella fun

Looks like Freddy almost morphs into Slenderman when he steps on the trap, leaked new killer maybe?

Two hours in the lobby, still no news ü•∫
---
Now that you mention it, I have been able to 4% quite a bit lately. Like...every time I try. I thought it was weird, but wrote it off as luck.
---
Ya, there's a lot more than "MKB" that will cause issues if there is PC/Console crossplay.
---
I agree it was extremely powerful. But now it‚Äôs bugged so it‚Äôs a tough one. Maybe make it like three safe unhooks or something? Idk.
---
That's just how some people want to play the game. It's just as bad as teabagging survivors with insta heals or keys because that cuts the Playtime down for the Killer. Neither one of those things have a counter besides Franklin's and stuff like ruin but it's pretty much nullified because it's more than likely going to spawn on a generator or a hill. It's also completely countered by good survivors that hit skill checks..
---
Yesterday I was trying to learn Friday because I barely ever play this killer. I get the Family Residence map and despite the first Survivor I down suiciding on the hook... They got 4 generators done with ruin in about 3 minutes. They were in a group chat together and had spine chill in combination with prove thyself.
---
My point is both sides play scummy. You have to deal with killers that tunnel just like we have to deal with survivors that decide the map or coordinate an entire group to bully you.
---
If you get tunnels that just means your team gets to do generators uninterrupted and that you should buy them as much time as you can. Get your boldness and evader points. Don't let it bother you so much. There's a reason people keep doing it
---
Right click on Dbd in steam, hit properties, local files, verify integrity of game files. Should take only a couple minutes. That's what fixed the issue for me
---
Colour blindness isn't a part of the ADA. If it were, there are a lot more important things to rectify before we worry about a videogame.
---
Moris=swf unfun for the other side gamebreaking and an instawin if they are good
---
Holy hell I‚Äôm definitely gonna get the classic GhostFace and the Nancy. Also the Laurie and Michael. Still gonna stick with the Scoops Ahoy Steve but maybe I might get his. But HELL YEAH all of these look extremely cool.
---
Good one...I almost slip thah GhostFace is a big (unlimited insta-down) error
---
David and Jake's hilarious adventures
---
That‚Äôs beautiful.

Got every perk for her on xbox, have spent real money on her cosmetics to support the game and they do this, fun

I think I‚Äôm the only one, but Yes _ICONIC_ Nancy Wheeler *Red Coat* love it!
---
I've just been insulted like hell on my last game as Ghost Face, the last guy that was injured leaved the exit gate to pick up a chest so I sneaked inside a waited for him to come back just like 20sec. 
---
I guess this is the biggest screamer he ever seen on the game, and called me a camper... I'm just using my power as an advantage for Entity's sake !

I‚Äôm new to DBD so I haven‚Äôt heard about a potential battle pass, what would it consist of ?

---
I WANTED THE STEVE ONE SINCE THE BEGINNING
---
Where is this from?
---
Oh cool thanks.
---
This :(
---
There's nothing accurate about it at all, but go off I guess. Nothing about Ghostface in the movies was stealthy. He was not a stealthy killer. He was a clumsy chaser who taunted and played with his victims.
---
None of that is reflected in DbD Ghostface.
---
Is this glitch really back?
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs very helpful.
---
Shock therapy*
---
I get that they‚Äôre trying to make money. But I‚Äôm not sure this was the way to do it. I like the new charms and special cosmetics but I feel like you should need to do a bunch of rift quests to get them not get ‚Äúrift fragments‚Äù and get things in order that they made them on the pass. Plus the free pass is just pathetic
---
Its different with Bill because there is practically nothing they can do with the character now.
---
Bill is canonically dead
---
Bill's VA is canonically dead

Just give up majority rights to Bill if you aren't doing anything with him please.

Look up Truetalent on YouTube, he just put a video up about challenges and the "battle pass"
---
You can apparently earn back your 1000 Auric Cells before the next Rift goes live.
---
Besides which, it's less expensive than ONE outfit.
---
Damn, that's unfortunate.  I've also noticed that running "forward" can be a little more finicky on analog stick than it would be WASD.  I often look backwards while running, which requires me to spin the stick in the opposite direction.  Having to reorient the camera and get the analog back to the up position takes just a little more time than a swipe of the mouse and a press of W wouldn't.  I'm wondering whether I should even bother running it or go with lithe instead.
---
Thank you for the response :)

I love this game, but totally feel out of the loop because everyone seems to know everything except me.

What a idiot
---
Are these available for purchase, or just through the rift track?
---
At this point nothing will work except a full rework of the game that will ACTUALLY punish the 10% of good Survivors, and NOT fuck over everyone else
---
well thats boring
---
I mean you don't have to buy it plus they wouldn't be able to make all the killers and survivors free as most are licensed meaning it'd be very hard for them to make them free,  the pass also make it so the cosmetics will eventually allow everyone to get them(I think) and if you buy it you should be able to keep getting it right? I personally feel it's fine considering how cheap and optional the pass is and how cheap the game is (plus of how many discounts they do on their dlcs)
---
Entity: "Fine I'll do it myself"
---
The reason i made this post is because it happened to me a couple hours ago but we still had a gen left and they were all downed back to back in 10 seconds
---
Dude go outside
---
Yeah I think it must be a hidden change. Maybe for people that hook suicide a lot
---
Didn‚Äôt you start your comment chain by saying I was entitled?
---
No just no, #1 licensed killers could never be free as they‚Äôd lose money, #2 battle pass is all cosmetics for unlicensed survivors and killer that people have saved up iridescent shards to earn. Just play the game and earn them, I‚Äôve bought all unlicensed killers and survivors with iridescent shards. It‚Äôs already and enough they‚Äôre giving away old skins like the huntress mask on the free pass
---
Yeah
---
Heeeyyy, Quentin main speaking. Let's riot!
---
My art looked EXACTLY like this at some point, it's almost uncanny.
---
Keep practicing, the only way you can go is up!!
---
Oh sorry, forgot to update. Doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs an In-Game feature.
---
Killers think dr is weak now? Everybody hated dr mains when he came out. He was pretty damn good too. Do killers all just give up too easily and play spirit now?
---
fans
---
How is it pathetic, you get free cosmetics.
---
Hahaha, I'm new to posting on Reddit hahaha. There was supposed two images, one of the mask that comes with Ghostface and the one they're selling with the new Ghostface outfit. The mask that comes with Ghostface is a little off white and has some blood on it the one above is the mask with the new outfit
---
I wasn't the person in the first reply.
---
He‚Äôs so fun to watch
---
That's lame as fuck but oh well I guess lol what can ya do
---
Omg the Halloween cosmetics!! I‚Äôm so happy I can‚Äôt wait to get them! &lt;3
---
A very well thought out and logical counter argument. I see how I was in the wrong. Thank you. /s
---
yeah, i have no clue
---
Reminder that the chille add ons do literally nothing
---
Oh, well then I‚Äôm embarrassed.
---
Finally someone intelligent, couldn‚Äôt have said it any better
---
If that's the case....it's a welcomed change! Nothing worse than hanging on a hook while everyone else is ducking behind trees!!! It's basically free Deliverance!  ü§£
---
I honestly think the chances of finding a key or unhooking yourself directly correlates to the number of hooked/dead survivors. If I ever get all 4 down somehow, there's always a non-deliverance kobe. I also have a lot more survivors find keys in chests when it's just down to one or two.

Fortnite when it has a cosmetic battlepass: This is fine.
---
Apex Legends when it has a cosmetic battlepass: This is fine.
---
Call of Duty when it (used to) have a cosmetic battlepass: This is fine.
---
Dead by Daylight when it has a cosmetic battlepass: REEEEEEEEEEE STINGY MICROTRANSACTIONS IN A FULL PRICED GAME
---
HOLY FUCKING SHIT
---
Nah man headless Myers
---
Maybe it's just that my computer monitor is way smaller, but docked, my switch plays waaaay better on the monitor than it does on my big TV. Maybe it's size or refresh rate or something. Like it runs pretty damn smooth on my monitor
---
You can pay $10 for the pass a single time then get your 1000 auric cells back from the pass and "recycle" it to continuously buy newer passes while still only paying that initial $10. They even said they created it around the average of 1 hour per day so it doesn't sound like getting back those 1000 cells will be a massive effort either. Including ~$90 worth of DLCs across a pass that players can effectively pay $10 for would be a horrendous business decision, on top of that from what I've seen the pass is entirely cosmetics so you really don't lose anything by not buying it. It's not like they're putting exclusive perks in the pass that you miss out on by not buying it, you just don't get some cosmetics which have zero effect on actual gameplay.

You know that ghost face was PISSED

yeah, i wasted points on instaheals, bnps, odd bulbs and stuff, so don't give me this "killers wasted like 100 000 bp on moris" stuff.

Yeah like over 70% of this game's content is paywalled and people are bitching about paying $10 for some cosmetics *and your $10 back?*
---
This meme is honestly how it be sometimes. "Battlepass bad cause Fortnite bad."
---
fantastic video, our baby's all grown up &lt;3
---
Spine Chill and by extension Premenition SHOULD work on undetectable while they are useless against tier 1 Mikey.
---
Plus Mikey has tier 2 and 3 for lethality. He's still better despite weaker stealth IMO.
---
Yep :)
---
skReEeEeEeeEeEe
---
*LOUD FLESHY DIGGING SOUND*
---
Unlikely. They made the recharge start as soon as Nurse starts the fatigue animation so you'll have nearly 2 blinks by the time you would be able to blink again regardless.
---
I know but I mean internally not externally.
---
Are you playing with uncapped FPS?
---
Yea I'm praying they don't charge for very very slight difference with the mask but it's most likely as you stated they just made ashes pants slightly lighter and Adam has one that's makes his hair slightly shorter or taller I believe idk
---
Aww is the neckbearded troglodyte angry? Suck my nuts bitch ;) you're still a whiny little bitchboy.
---
Idk
---
Any killer really, if you aren‚Äôt great maybe someone like doc as you can easily get 20k without getting a hit
---
Ah i see
---
Love otz
---
That was one of the greatest cinematic experience I have ever been a part of
---
Good stuff all, but... could the Fredster get another costume at some point? :(
---
Freddy is missing too. No idea why
---
Thanks for agreeing with me. It looks way too traditional.  I would have been happier if it was more like David's. Her skirt looks way too traditional
---
KOCCHI WO MIRO

Licensing issues.

Yeah I'm stupid hahaha
---
What part? The cosmetic part or the playing the game part?
---
The thing was I play on cloud gaming so I was curious , might have to report this to nvidia
---
It's probably because us Ghostface mains can tbag the toxic survivors back lmao
---
That sucks. He looked like the most unique looking character(Nightmare on Elm Street).
---
I had to apologise to a player once as I opened a locker to restock and found them in theft. No clue they were there at all. 
---
Of course I hooked them and they died but the last guy got the hatch so karma does come around eventually!
---
This spoke to me
---
did it ever occur to you he tunneled *because* of the body blocking?
---
Nah it was an honest mistake. Don‚Äôt sweat it.
---
It went from 4 digits, to 6 digits. Genuinely there were insane ones for a while for like 120k. But then they ruined it with the current ones
---
what? are you really complaining that the shitty stealth killers that have needed this buff for AGES don't deserve it simply because it would make Myers less unique?
---
jesus fuck man this community BAFFLES me sometimes.
---
you see the irony is you don't get why this is funny
---
Better her than the survivors. I favor this idea.
---
I'd disagree with that. I think if they had it so Left Behind had a higher gen repair speed as it's buff instead of the different function it has now, it would be on par with this change. While Left Behind gives a different, more useful benefit, this buff gives pretty much nothing to MoM. 
---
The problem with the perk since the nerf has always been how hard it is to activate and how much it supports poor play. In fact, this "buff" just seems to encourage even more poor play! It's a disappointing change to a disappointing perk.
---
I can‚Äôt see it, can you highlight it please.
---
Name one perk but these two perks dont count because I said they dont.
---
NOED, because the survivors 99% of the time aren‚Äôt gunna cleanse ALL of the totems
---
So it only blocks auras yet it doesnt block detection perks? I gotta double check that tomorrow.
---
Eh, i still consider him a better killer than the two gameplaywise, but walking around in tier 2 with 8 or better yet 6 meter terror radius while the survivor can see me until im literally next to him is quite annoying. One would think they game the undetectable to wraith simply cos he could be seen from anywhere while stealthed. 
---
The only difference being that michael doesnt need to ring a bell and can perhaps instadown if he has saved up enough stalk and can get close enough, which doesnt happen by surprise mind you since, once again, the survivor can definetly see you coming.
---
Temple of purgation as well with a classic Myers kill
---
^(I find using a PC helps)
---
But... Quentin..?
---
Even us Quentin mains don't use Pharmacy so eh. Still a moronic nerf.
---
Sorry if I came off as an ass but you definitely should have worded that better
---
You get recolored versions of already existing cosmetics, and very few of them
---
And zombie
---
Blue is pleb free version.
---
You should probably ask at r/pcmasterrace because it's not the game's fault for your pc overheating.
---
I think Ruin absolutely counts. I don't think it needs to be dumpstered but it being one of the most popular killer perks definitely shows there needs to be change of some kind. Gen speed for example.
---
No. I applause the devs for giving buffs to the lower tier killer which they obviously need. The title is a question about the status of the detection perks and the text is more of my problem with the fact that while im sure the wraith, pig and ghostface are in a good place right now, michael still suffers from OoO immensely.
---
Well, there goes most of my apprehension on this. Warframe recently implemented a system that has limited time rewards that require weeks of commitment to obtain. Its 100% free, it just has a time limit. I hate it with every fiber of my being. I like knowing that I can get what I want when I want it down the line.
---
well this just sound omega-dumb. You know the spirit cost them around 30,000 dollars to develop from the facial rig alone, right??? It's called "I need money so I don't starve" chief.
---
Its so weird, his original outfit is so memorable, unique and (obviously) fits the character well, but then new ghostface is like, exactly what I'd want a Scream remake to be, horror satire with an actually incredibly dangerous and scary looking killer who also has a sense of humor.
---
My man congrats on the red ranks!
---
It allows you to blink then blink backwards to your original spot if you activate it in the blink time frame. He sat next to the gen and blinked then used the addon to blink back to the gen and grab the Nea.
---
Is that really it ? That just seems way too strong honestly have to sacrifice my teammate to save myself. It wasn't fun at all not because he was better or I was losing just because I felt like I had no chance in hell
---
Nothing wrong with Fortnite.
---
It's just cosmetics dude
---
Finally, a cosmetic for my boi Michael.
---
&gt;I can name a couple *entire killers* who have been nerfed. does that count? I can also name numerous survivor buffs
---
Very interested in seeing what survivor buffs you name. I sure cant think of anything.
---
&gt;how the fuck could anyone have ever won against an swf all with MoM and instas? you couldn't
---
why do you have to include instas+swf on top of that? You are trying to argue that MoM is OP but then include the stipulation of a *SWF* AND *instaheals* on top of that. Its like if I tried to prove how Nurse is OP by saying ‚Äúhow are you supposed to win against an omega blink rank 1 nurse with an ebony mori and your teammates are rank 21???‚Äù.  You‚Äôd probably get steamrolled harder by a SWF with instaheals if they didnt run MoM and ran a better perk.
---
There were numerous killers who had no problem with MoM. All MoM did was make the worst killers even worse.
---
It didnt work against Nurse, Huntress or Billy. Against Hag and Spirit it barely even mattered because they end chases incredibly quickly with their power. Killers like Myers and Plague could reduce the amount of stacks you got with their power and prevent you from getting 3 MoM stacks. ANY killer could use an instant down perk like Haunted Grounds or MYC to reduce the amount of stacks you got. 
---
Yeah, MoM was string when you had multiple instaheals against a wraith and got found first and got borrowed time saved and then got a free hit and then adrenalined or whatever fantasy people act like happened every match. If you had no interaction with the killer for the majority of the match then get two tapped down, the perk did nothing for you. It really wasnt the most OP perk to ever exist, old DS was far far worse. 
---
It was just piss poor design (make the worst killers even worse) and an obvious cash grab to sell a licensed character and make a quick buck.
---
In the same way it never went, it‚Äôs only really kyf and if someone was to do it in online they would get band
---
Aw man now I have nothing to nut on :(
---
*Bob the builder*
---
I remember in one of the movies when he had the hospital gown they showed his face a little and instead of the mask he had some sort of wrappings around it, part 4 I think.
---
His trailer too, damn that was short and sweet
---
Yeah I know what you mean, I've had a similar situation with a Demogorgon today as well, they also had a mori so we all went down like flies
---
If this is OP then great montage! Should do some more!
---
He can't teleport for a time after teleporting, you had to bait a teleport then remove a portal or start repairing a gen
---
This is a complete lie. The majority of reworks are buffs (trapper, wraith, hag, freddy, etc). They are absolutely not about to nerf doctor and you're insane if you think they are.
---
Should be fun to play killer in the coming weeks as everyone is offloading their soon to be worse instaheals.
---
YES! YES!
---
Genius. I really like these add ons. Way better than everything being a direct number upgrade
---
Is that the scorpion from mortal combat perk?
---
"GET OVERHERE!!"
---
Clean off your CPU and heatsink, apply new thermal paste. Works like a charm for me.
---
Right so quick question, do you think it's acceptable for red rank killers (Ranks 1-3, 4 is not red ranks, it's Purple Ranks+) to be shat on by SWFs and their only option being Spirit?
---
Don't try to come at me with the BS that Nurse will still have a chance, she will not. Part of what made the Nurse formidable is being able to get right back on Survivors ass after the Fatigue, now it doesn't exist.
---
So this is totally fair right? Making red ranks who want a chance against all survivor teams must play Spirit? This is balance to you? It's disgusting. Base Nurse with no addons was fine, that's what actual Nurse's used, Omegablink was OP and no one disputes that. The preview of those addons a few days ago was a ruse, got people happy about their being good addons for Nurse, but deep down I knew they touched her base power, and now look at it... Spirit's only now. And this community REALLY hates Spirit more than Nurse in the LIVE game. Killer gameplay is on Borrowed Time if this charge system stays.
---
Thank god I didn‚Äôt spend my 10 bucks on the devil cosmetic!
---
Hi!
---
I made a fan rearrangement of the huntress‚Äô lullaby a while ago but back then I didn‚Äôt know this subreddit. (It got some attention still).
---
I hope you like it. ^^
---
I would love if they just added variations of Coraline to already existing DBD characters. Like Nea could have the cute raincoat and boots and short blue hair, maybe the little coraline doll strapped to her back. And maybe Jake could have a Wybie skin, the bushy hair, and a slingshot on his waist. Although it would be hard getting Wybie's signature head tilt lol. As my favorite childhood movie, I would love it. Just some ideas though ‚ò∫
---
I really hope that when I am carrying a survivor as Michael if anyone is following me the gown just flies up and exposes his cheeks.
---
I was on a cruise for the entirety of the blood hunt, but it's looking like I'll have an entire week off work during this next event!
---
Very well done :)
---
I completely agree. It's exactly why I think gens should get looked at and Ruin could be changed to compensate. I think whatever can make Ruin not a complete necessity is the way to go about it.
---
Thank you :3
---
i mean you are testing out bugs lol
---
nice man! :D hoping i can at least just get Jakes chest and pants... anything after that and its just gravy for me xD
---
so many clowns on this subreddit. I actually have no idea how he could come to that conclusion. I could make someone who never played this game spend 5 minutes scrolling through hot and they‚Äôd take notice of the insane bias.
---
Correct, people would grab a lamp and go immersed for infinite bloodpoints. The lantern gave like 500 bp every so often as long as you held it, so people were just avoiding the killer until they dc
---
there is nothing you could have done. 2 gens left with only 2 survivors is pretty much gg for any killer. It's not impossible but really difficult for you both to escape.
---
Those are both awesome ideas!
---
&gt; You can hear huntress coming a mile away
---
To be fair, she can also hit you from a mile away.
---
Set a custom fan curve on your gpu with msi afterburner.
---
Fucking hell, is that a laurie strode cosmetic i see? What the fuck? Im i alive right now?
---
Damm, that's really good! Only complaint is that it isn't longer :)
---
Correct, it's just hard to test any of the balance changes and battle pass stuff when things this game breaking are happening. I am thankful that they have a PTB for these exact instances though!
---
But then she wouldn t be pig
---
My rule Is If they wiggle after I pass a hook they die. Simple as that. How can u not tell that I'm helping you, I literally passed like 3 hooks.
---
ARISEEE!
---
Well it's such minor buff because all of them(but Myers) still get effected by spine chill and premonition meaning  they will still be easily detected(that's what I believe they said)
---
