I think its the rng thing

you need to hook a different for the first time. hooking the same survivor won't get you another stack

OMG UR A CAMPUR STOP CAMPING /s

Oh my dude that‚Äôs nothing. I was playing huntress on the chapel when I found someone within 30 seconds and downed them. They DC‚Äôd then their friend added me. Their friend demanded proof I wasn‚Äôt lag switching by me recording my gameplay and sending it to them. They then later reported me for lag switching.
---
Bruh
---
he gon snack Scooby later
---
Same thing happened to me. It only happened once but I had DS and a claudette flashlight saved me but I also hit DS at the same time, so I thought I wasted it, but when the killer picked me back up after downing me later on in the game, it did that.
---
The bigger the mound the more termites to eat the pallets. I like it.
---
;{
---
Dont say sorry. Its necessary.
---
I found a survivor when I was on the chapel playing as huntress. I downed him in 30 seconds using the old hatchet and hit tactic. He instantly DC‚Äôed. His friend then added me, demanding that I record my gameplay and send it to him or he would report me for ‚Äúlag switching‚Äù. Funniest shit

---
Ruin isnt so much toxic as it is annoying. It's not fun for the survivors, just a minor inconvenience, and it isn't  engaging for the killers, they just run it and ignore it
---
Wasted that pallet, good thing your team didn‚Äôt need it
---
I also don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm looking at or supposed to understand from this lol
---
i wish to sell this ***bicycleOO***
---
So each team will have 1 killer and 4 survivors. When two team go against each other they get the other team's killer 
---
So if your Team A's killer you will go against Team B's survivors.
---
There are 6 rounds total. 3 rounds with Team A killing Team B and 3 rounds of Team B killing Team A.
---
Survivors can earn points by escaping (one point per escape) and killers get a point per kill. If you have anyother questions feel free to ask
---
"Hi welcome to Dead By Dumb Shit how may I help you"
---
...ok
---
then that's weird, never happened to me tho
---
Self care, spine chill and urban... that's when I know I'm gonna end up doing 3 gens by myself and running the killer, only to get hooked and die because my teammates flup.out when they hear a heartbeat
---
It's a perk that's called "Hex: No One Escapes Death". It allows you to move faster and down survivors in one hit once all generators are complete. Hex means that for the perk to work, a dull totem must be lit. NOED is a special case because it activates later on in the game, so if there are no dull totems left, it won't activate at all, whereas other Hex perks like "Hex: Ruin" are active since the beginning of the trial, until destroyed of course.

As killer main, i love Endgame Collapse it was fucking annoying constantly having hatch standoffs.
---
Thank you!
---
I pick Michael
---
Dm me, there are DBD comp discords already. you should talk with the host/teams
---
You can counter it, use lightborn or knock those flashlights out of their hands with Franklin's! Also if you dont wanna rely on perks you can start learning little tricks to counter it. When you are at a pallet and you know you are about to get blinded, fake breaking the pallet, you can do this by standing still, then immediately look up and then break the pallet, you may still get blinded but it may drain quite a bit more of their flashlight. Same can be done at windows. Sometimes it's good to fake a break or vault anyway. Also if you know you are gonna get blinded take a look at what's beyond the pallet and try to memorialize the path you need to take, or try to follow their sounds. It's not easy but your gonna get tons of practice as you rank up ;)
---
dude
---
all these pig players are so weird wtf
---
My wait times aint even that bad anymore
---
I don‚Äôt DC at all. Yeah it sucks to get facecamped to death but at least I can help my teammates because they can do gens while the killer is busy humping me on the hook. If 2 People DC I just make noise to alert the killer to my position and then see if he wants to farm or just get it over with either way I at least get some bloodpoints out of it. It‚Äôs annoying to get hooked in the first 20 seconds of the game, but that does not mean you should give up, you might be able to avoid getting hooked again for the next few gens. I think you fuck over the other survivors so bad when you do that. The only time where I literally do not care is when the Killer has everyone slugged on the ground and is not hooking anyone and it‚Äôs obvious nobody has Unbreakable or No Mither bc then it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
This on PS4?
---
They do need to fix the grab mechanic for generators and hooks. You can‚Äôt grab people out of the hatch anymore since the EGC update.

My people :,)

I especially love that idea for the Trapper, really gruesome

They patched the wake up bug, but fucked every other perk.

hwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

it used to be that way but they changed it a little while ago, so now its level 1 goes up to 2 stacks, level 3 goes up to 3 stacks and level 3 goes all the way to 4 stacks

I would have loved either Sidney or Gale

I don't understand it either.

Are they saying I'm a bad killer because I didn't let the survivors who literally ran into my chainsaw get away and win the game?
---
Yeah the Scream series is brilliant.
---
Im a big fan.
---
I struggle with depression and anxiety and just want something to take my mind off the constant pain. Huge fan of horror films, but maybe this game just isn't for me if that's the standard behavior

Any game. Literally every single one. A bigger following means the game will get more money which means it will get more development. I'm an old monster hunter vet and when world was announced I was ecstatic they were mainstreaming it. Yeah it sucks that all these newbies think their good and try to tell us vets how to play but we wont be seeing any Japan only releases for world.
---
And I get body blocked and sandbagged by survivors. The rest either suicide or dc. I don't want to wait 20 minutes to make a killer lobby and even then its usually a bugged lobby that will only have a max of 3.
---
It's fine bbq &amp; boring needs nerfing. I don't mind the killer having more than 5 seconds to see everyone on the map but it seems a bit extreme to have that ability and get extra blood points when killers already get more than survivors.
---
But everyone just thinks I'm salty. Sure, but they've ruined my favorite game and the toxicitiy has finally done me in I think. I regret joining this stupid twitch challenge. I know I haven't done well and I'm pretty sure only 1st place is getting a reward anyway.
---
I take such good selfies lol
---
;-; üê∑
---
What would be your thoughts if the escape rates remained constant or even fell because of the limited SWF in the experimental build?
---
Well people don't like seeing their character get killed so it pisses them off. Just close off your chat if you don't like hate mail.
---
They are new / learning
---
Cool?
---
Same. So many people are, it‚Äôs kinda surprising they didn‚Äôt dedicate an entire chapter to it; a lot of people would‚Äôve been thrilled
---
It's weird. whenever I play survivor, everyone loves each other. But whenever I play killer, I get called racial slurs.
---
\&gt;20 seconds of use
---
\&gt;takes 1\~2 seconds of channeling to use
---
\&gt;this channeling counts as use time
---
very cool behavior thank you
---
Toxic Jager main
---
Does not work all the time, sadly.
---
&gt;when you‚Äôre the last one left and you have to find a strategy to escape without being caught. 
---
Tbh, I didn't really enjoy hiding for 5 minutes until the killer got bored and alt-tabbed while I went to a gate.
---
you never touch r6s huh?
---
I appreciate the honesty
---
No sadly, We all wish for that tho
---
Usually what happens is all the survivors tbag at the exit and when I try hitting them they just instantly leave before I get a hit
---
&gt; It's fine bbq &amp; boring needs nerfing. I don't mind the killer having more than 5 seconds to see everyone on the map but it seems a bit extreme to have that ability and get extra blood points when killers already get more than survivors.
---
&gt; 
---
lol wut 
---
The main reason I run BBQ is because of extra BP since more often than not, survivors counter it by hiding in lockers. 
---
Survivors fail to realize that the aura reading in the distance is beneficial for them (even the devs said this). If the killer is playing "fairly", he will leave the hook area immediately since he has a next target, creating an opportunity to make a save.
---
depends you got hex ruin? cuz its needed for him
---
Gives me the big sad, maybe it could be put into an update.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why the weirdest of posts always mention playing pig, or pig in some way. 
---
I blame that pig main that got banned a while back.

Hey 600 bp is 600 bp
---
This is BEAUTIFUL. Thank you!!!!
---
Agree
---
That‚Äôs true, but it‚Äôs a fairly bad perk on spirit, it‚Äôs the equivalent to overcharge freddy and bamboozle nurse
---
Well if ALL of the survivors made it to the exit gate, don‚Äôt you think you MIGHT‚ÄôVE deserved it.
---
Nope
---
Killers can't use any of those perks.
---
get it cuz when you placing down traps at the beginning it takes time
---
I was already trying to get it because it is very good lol
---
Just an exaggeration it's usually just one or two on a bad game
---
As trapper, you always want to know the popular looping areas. Usually the main building of each map should have a trap on it. For instance, the pig slaughter house has one window that almost every survivor has to use to effectivelt loop there, so I trap that window and get a lot of kills because of it. While sheds are super obvious trap areas, they can be good for trapping as well. 
---
At the beginning of a trapper match, I recommend setting a minimum of 4-5 traps before you even start looking for survivors. Even if you see one, ignore them. Not setting traps at the beginning will be an automatic lose for you.
---
Too true lol
---
A little explanation, I pulled someone off the exit gate as the timer ran out and they pretty much got morried inside me while i was able to walk around. I was told from the survivor involved his perspective was also interesting.
---
That‚Äôs not even the worst part about windows. If the killer lags, you teleport back and have to rehop the window.
---
DUDE WHY ARE YOU DOING THE GEN HE IS LITERALLY HOOKED RIGHT THERE OMG
---
Too be fair he really struggles with gen rushing.
---
I thought six pack David King was best looking.
---
I understand, man. Not everyone plays this game for salt and people's behaviour can really soil enjoyment. Unfortunately some gamers take games way too personally and forget this stuff is just for fun.
---
Sorry you get a lot of grief, you aren't alone. All I can suggest is avoid chat and just play the game for your own enjoyment.
---
Lmao nice
---
What I did was play surviver until I could get some good perks through the shrine watch and play as doctor cause hes great for farming BP
---
Legion or nea?
---
Legion
---
Yeah, but what you have to realize is that it's consistent. It's not like the survivors don't know you can hit them on the other side if they're directly in front of it. They don't even have to be in the hopping animation. If they're that close to the window on the other side, you can hit them through it.

How‚Äôs that being a smart ass ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
Honestly what people should do when and if Noed comes into play
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A: If a survivor is hooked and not dead, determine if it is safe to unhook or go look for the bloody totem! B: Open the gate and leave. 9/10 times the Killer will hang near the hook to get more kills.
---
Cleanse dull totems during the game, and if Noed still procs, either save them or your own skin.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I HATE NOED. Ruin I can burn through, but NOED is tough because the dull totems are REALLY hard to find. But I don‚Äôt spam ppl and tell them to kill themselves over a game. That‚Äôs immature and ridiculous. I‚Äôm so sorry that this happened and again on behalf of all survivor mains WE DO NOT CLAIM THEM. God bless you!!!
---
Thanks man I really appreciate that.
---
Why do you think she‚Äôs selling it?
---
I like the reference but Za Warudo would be more fitting, if it was King Crimson the pallet would have been broken and he would have swung after he reappeared. While Za Warudo can attack in the time freeze
---
Thank you
---
I‚Äôm relatively new to the game and I‚Äôve been trying to memorize the  routes on each map
---
I feel that preminition randomly procs for me when I turn to look around really often, and I have no clue where the killer is because I snapped my camera 90 degrees to look at something
---
I wish you Had 0
---
really good advice, i dont play trapper but if i go against a trapper and he's already chasing within the first 30 seconds i know it's about to be an easy game
---
You're welcome, I hope things get brighter for you in future. 
---
Hope you can enjoy the game, too. :)
---
‚ÄúHonestly I don‚Äôt know why killers complain about decisive strike. It‚Äôs 100% counterable by just juggling the survivor. Honestly just get off your ass and learn to juggle.‚Äù You realize how stupid you sound now? Probably not I‚Äôm just waiting breath arguing with someone too dumb to realize how idiotic he sounds because he can‚Äôt even realize NOED is a bullshit perk.
---
Well I would say that he isn‚Äôt wrong and that insta heal is OP 
---
but then I saw him running prayer beads lmaooooooooo
---
Oh okay lol, yeah when that happens to me I just point the camera down like I‚Äôm sad

Was curious if it was a bug.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs the weird ‚Äúoinker‚Äù cult that he made
---
For me its the complete opposite, I hate paying survivor
---
4 useless reports, poor support team.
---
They need to just teleport survivors away once they're unhooked 
---
Or no more dying on first or second hook. Killer wants to camp then let them. They'll be there all game
---
Any new game modes would probably be awesome. I think an infinite mode would be cool. Where survivors spawn in and try to get as many points as possible while the killer just runs around and murders everyone to his hearts content. Could make it have timed events where the killer gets noed or ruin or whatever.
---
&gt;Was curious if it was a bug.
---
So were the other 100 threads but nobody ever bother to search before adding more threads to the pile.

Negative? Damn son, you're never gonna pay that back off to the Entity...

You‚Äôre must just be a joy to have around
---
That isn't even the best toolbox to use for getting gens done asap. You always use commodious. Always.
---
Thanks for the legion tip! I‚Äôm saving my shards to get him
---
Vommy Mommy. I'm never gonna read anything more hilarious in my whole life.
---
There should be some sort of system that allows you to retain your addons when a survivor DC's, because there are far too many games where you wait 10-45 minutes, get into a game, smoke someone, and then they DC and it kicks off the domino DC chain.
---
Maybe it's just me being overly salty about how a survivor can DC and keep their item and addons for practically no downside.
---
And if you‚Äôre on console, I‚Äôm pretty sure both consoles have options to turn off messages from anyone you aren‚Äôt friends with.
---
Sorry about the delay.
---
Yeah it does...for the very, very start of the movie. If you were hoping he's in the whole thing, you'll be pretty disappointed.
---
It's a game no one actually gives a shit about what you run cause we all run the beat perks.
---
However having no ed make a winning game turn to a losing one because you completed the objective safely isnt fun in anyway so who isnt gunna feel cheated?
---
Absolutely, it's why I have mine equipped with Dying Light. I'm just saying that, at base kit or leaning on his perks, he's just not terribly great at what he is supposed to be doing.
---
I mean, if you get Dying Light activated, and have that add-on that slows them down even more when they're asleep more than once, it just KILLS any momentum they have going. I've managed to turn a 4 gens done game into a 4K win before.
---
Man you do come up with some of the most stupid shit keep going my Discord group is have a fun time laughing at your stupidity
---
oh yeah, that‚Äôs definitely bad. but survivors tea bag all the time so it balances it out to me. toxic people will be toxic no matter what animations and perks they have.

Oh wait you said you want xd

Yea sure
---
Im gonna let one survivor live at the end of a trial, only one may live. Unless they player is annoying me. Like just blinding me throughout the entire game.

It seems like a lot of survivor perks are randomly broken for some matches. I wonder if the same is happening with killer perks?

I dont wanna waste actual money for damn cosmetics though

Type of Bug: in game
---
Description: Not able to wiggle, heal myself, use emotes, or escape through the exit gates. I was facing a Ghostface who had his three teachable perks, I was running my regular build (Adrenaline, Self care, Urban evasion, and bond). 
---
I was downed shortly after finding a purple medkit in the basement, and discovered that I couldn't wiggle. As I had heard about this bug before, I purposely kept running into the killer, hoping he would hook me, i tried to even show him that I couldn't heal, but he either thought i was trying something or he was trying to pity me, so he would down me but leave me. Others could heal me, but my heal bar would not show any progress. (Not sure if it was the same on their screen or not, no one stuck around for the end game chat). At the end game, I was injured but I couldnt leave through the gate (i ran through where the trigger should be several times, nothing happened). Not sure how to replicate
---
Hey m8 it's only a waste if they're killer cosmetics :^)
---
Laurie for DS
---
Deliverance is great but once you're found first, you just wasted a perk slot + it works most of the time with DS since some killers tend to tunnel you if you unhook yourself
---
What level is your bbq and chilli because it will only give you 2 stacks which equal up to 50% more bloodpoints
---
Man that sucks:( thanks
---
I think totems might broken, I was running ruin, huntress‚Äô lullaby, and noed and someone would break a totem and none of them would go away.
---
If youre good at tracking survivors scratch Marks and sound govget spirit
---
If not amanda is good too
---
Doesn't scratch mark perk worsen the scratches?
---
Part of me wondered who would have to original if anyone and trapper is a great idea!
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Oddly enough, both have what most consider 1 good perk (decisive strike and deliverance) 1 meme perk (object of obsession and diversion), and 1 useless perk (sole survivor and autodidact). For that reason, I‚Äôd say its tricky picking between them. 
---
That being said, I think both Decisive Strike and Deliverance are useful perks but highly situational and they both can easily be a waste of a slot if not needed. I prefer DS over Deliverance if I had to choose though a lot of Laurie mains (not all, people!) are toxic so it may cause killers to play harder vs you. Adam‚Äôs got a much better look to his model though and a sweet haircut if that matters to you. 
---
Overall I consider them fairly equal to each other so it‚Äôs not an easy yes-no choice. If you only care about perks, I‚Äôd probably say Laurie. If you want to play the new survivor, go with Adam and be an altruistic hero for the team.
---
Tractor tech ftw works with all 115% killers

I want the Demogorgon to be added.
---
Spirits stun noise is more like a waluigi wah.
---
Some gotta learn the hard way. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
What's a Splinter?
---
generally it‚Äôs something you learn from trial and error and muscle memory
---
understanding the map as to where pallets and vaults are and knowing when to shock to prevent said pallet drops and vaults are extremely important and makes the difference between winning and losing at higher ranks
---
that being said the best addons i can recommend for beginners are the moldy electrode and restraint classes iii or ii
---
don‚Äôt shock randomly and all the time when you can just get the hit instead 
---
hope that helps!
---
Get Laurie. 
---
Adam can be bought with shards, Laurie cannot.
---
Taste Their Fear sounds like a budget Whispers and Enduring. 
---
Timeless Fear sounds pretty useless but would be great on my Doctor build for extra annoyance.
---
I just... don't feel comfortable with adding a real life killer to a game. It feels kinda like we're glorifying them.
---
Actually, any killer defined as tall has the camera placed in their chest. You can see it in the beginning of the match, or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvIebo22je4). No clue why when they could just place it in their head.
---
Shut up Jew its just another post crying about the same shit
---
How about we don‚Äôt buff survivors and give them passives.
---
dude you are bullying rank 20 surv with a noed mori combo, what a dick you are
---
You do know that you CAN'T grab survivors from the hatch jumping animation anymore, right? Hatch is now on a first come first served basis. You either close the hatch as killer or jump in as survivor, nothing in between.  
---
And the hand animation with the swinging is because of net latency, so I can't really help you there.

Don‚Äôt be a baby. Words do not carry the newton‚Äôs per square inch to break bones.
---
Every SINGLE time I see a hex with no ruin up I decide its haunted ground and its goddamn Devour Hope
---
LCD should be LSD
---
Oooohhh alright thanks
---
I can't express how much I love this
---
Thats super cool, good job!
---
Buzzz 
---
Now I wanna know what it runs on. Lol
---
I dont hear it. Am I just fuckin stupid
---
Lmfao the in-game reports don‚Äôt even do anything
---
because they want to save the pallet and find another one further
---
Oh it totally works!! I sang the title to that tune for sure!!!
---
I'm garbage at hitting Great skillchecks consistently, even after a year and a half. It's just neat to have
---
They were terrible, he has no business directing, some people might like his style. Now for his concerts that son of bitch will blow you away! Best performance next to Five Finger Death Punch!
---
No no ofc no hard feelings my friend, just thought that it wouldn‚Äôt be cool if you got loads of attention while using someone elses content without giving cred, but you seem like a noble so well have a good weekend my dude
---
Looks like she was just giving the killer extra hit points. A lot of survivors do that by waiting to get hit at the gate. It's a good deed
---
Do lag switchers get banned?
---
Well what does that mean if I like them?
---
CAMPER

I agree. You should not be able to ¬´¬†play¬†¬ª real life serial killers. It‚Äôs glorifying them. It‚Äôs disrespectful to the victims, the families. I would definitely not be comfortable with the idea that real life killers are used to make money in the game.
---
The Boogyman.
---
&gt;Lmfao the in-game reports don‚Äôt even do anything
---
They do but not in this case (Disconnects).
---
Sorry let me reword this,
---
Everyone has there likes and dislikes, or per say style of things and he just is not my cup of tea when it comes to film, now other people might like his films and there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone is different, and I don‚Äôt knock people for liking something If don‚Äôt, unless it‚Äôs face camping lol
---
Why is plag too high ?
---
I agree with Stake Out being a nice perk to run; but after you get skill-checks down, it's worthless.
---
Fair.
---
I think that'd be good in most cases. Although sometimes a killer is being extremely toxic or using exploits and then you're basically rewarding them with pts. But in most cases of DCing, I think this is fine
---
If you aren't getting any more perks, you got all available perks.
---
Oh yeah, the money thing too. I didn't even think of that. Yeah, the devs definitely shouldn't profit off of real life killers (and by extension, said killers' murders/their victims' deaths).
---
Blood, a renewable energy!
---
I think map-based powers (traps) might be too strong in games like those without any adjustments
---
My wait time on survivor is usually pretty fast when i‚Äôm playing with friends, but with killer it‚Äôs like 30 mins
---
Nobody:
---
Survivor Main: *Bashes micropenis on the control key while they and three friends are screaming the killer‚Äôs position on comms every second of the game*
---
LMAO probably not the best idea to leave in you almost RQing because you fucked up
---
PLAG HAS A HAT
---
It's more of a headdress but whatever
---
Good bye friend *looks down in trousers * It was nice knowing you buddy
---
It's time to play *looks at camera*
---
Dead by Democracy
---
I mean shit
---
Nea Karlsson, you should learn about balanced landing and urban evasion
---
Hat
---
I'll feel bad about Prayer beads when Insta-Heals and Purple/Red keys also get nerfed.
---
The only tier list that truly matters
---
I'm curious as to how you killed 3 people and still did not finish your ritual
---
God, I can just *see* that. I can *see* that.
---
b i k e
---
1. Doing this for the DBD community
---
2. We plan to have a reward of some sort but are working out the details on it.
---
3. I don't know what post you are referring to but even so what part of this requires trust. You play a game. I'm not asking for account details or something like that
---
Hat!!! :)
---
What's worse is the people who stop struggling because you don't immediately unhook them right in front of the killer. Like do you wanna die or do you wanna get away?
---
I got that and a double pip as survivor after dying after playing doctor with an ebony mori and getting the 4k and double pip.
---
Said double pip stayed.
---
Plague has a H A T, and i can argue that Pig has a semi hat
---
He has a beautiful smile
---
Could I be experiencing a glitch?
---
Like I said, Hex:Ruin has deff been unlocked, and my spirit has no more perks appearing in the bloodweb, It seems like this isn‚Äôt supposed to happen. Any suggestions?
---
Bond is a useful perk that I haven't seen many use
---
Finally.
---
Reminds me of the time a Killer told me I was using toxic crutch perks while I was trying to get my Dwight adept.
---
I didn't quit. Just raged a little :D
---
I'm on ps4 can I get them? Probably not
---
"David proves that only he has any sense of taste."
---
Is the sport the only killer to hit gens with her sword
---
She has a surprise
---
I‚Äôm not hearing it
---
Classic survivor, doesn't even know what toxic means.
---
not reliably. even in the hands of an amazing player, freddy can't kill players who know how to fight him, at least without using some purple/red addons. Leigon is just awful, and Wraith can camp, but not much else. Using their power is almost as much of a hindrance as it is a benefit. They rely on the survivors to make mistakes, and if they don't, then its over.
---
Thank you! And here you go. :)
---

Plague and hag aswell.
---
Ohh yea I don‚Äôt have plague yet and I don‚Äôt like hag  so I don‚Äôt play her much
---
DEATH!
---
Good job ***again***!
---
I'd also probably get a very dark DBD "wallpaper" image to spruce up the appearance of the black background (*not too bright, as the black looks good, but slightly boring*), perhaps making the different items a menu up top, or side bar,
---
*softly* I was the dumbass all along :o
---
I wish small game would get a buff and instead of just an audio cue it would show the aura of the totem and audio.
---
But they haven‚Äôt released the results...
---
I thought it was cool, then I turned on the sound and heard the chase music. You sir. Are going places. Would love to see the final product. Props man.
---
Can we change that last one to ‚Äúmore bologna than pepperoni‚Äô
---
Dude, that Rank 4 with no perks? I'd be super disappointed too seeing all of those DCs.
---
From how I understand it: This streamer was an idiot and got hooked in basement and bitched about basement hooking. 
---
Later, someone in the streamer's chat asked him how to stop getting hooked in basement, and the streamer replied "Just stay away from the basement." 
---
Basically OP's video is poking fun at the streamer for being a hypocrite. Bitching about basement hooking, but later telling a viewer that basement is easy to counter.
---
Quick &amp; Quiet. It allows me to jump into lockers at the very last second (which has saved my butt a lot of times, when I wasn't quite close enough to get into the locker slowly before another survivor got hooked) to avoid BBQ+C. 
---
I used to use it to vault over stuff quickly to save time getting places before Lithe got changed to proc on every fast vault, not just in chases. I still like vaulting silently over stuff in chases, though.
---
Aw looks like he hugging her in thumbnail
---
When the Killer is in 3,6,9,12 meter range you can see the killers aura
---
Springtrap as the killer and Micheal Afton as the survivor. It'd bd weird, but done right it could be pretty good.
---
(Que Downvotes.)
---
Don't feel bad, Myers mori is probably the best in the game IMO.
---
That'll make the perk op
---
But what about barbecue and chili?
---
Nice post, Fred.
---
He has a big heart, so its okay
---
I've never experienced anything like this. Try unlocking another killer teachable and see if that changes anything.  
---
You can also try submitting a ticket [here](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
---
Someones new here (yea it fucking sucks and for some reason its been 3 years and no proper party system)
---
You will until Dedicated servers which were said to release summer of 2019 come out
---
For now, yes, but the devs have been working on a system that works around that(according to the [Year 4 Roadmap](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D77W0S2WsAEkudU.jpg:large))
---
Like permanently?? Lol what an idea.
---
If I streamed I would invite you to watch lol. Hes all ive been playing the past 3 weeks.
---
Yeah I wish it didn‚Äôt have a range as to looking wise as in the 45¬∞ cone
---
Another caption that would of worked:
---
When everyone in the game calls you toxic becouse of the perks you bring Yet they say it was a coincidence that a 7 got into a game of 16's at the same time
---
It's fun to get one to "loop" you early to take out most of the pallets  on one side.
---
Okay, again, who runs spirt fury without enduring. And you only need one hex between ruin or noed.
---
Wait is this real?
---
And dead hard, adrenaline gamers should never run urban
---
Holy fuck, please kill me in all those ways üòç
---
 Dance with me lowered cool down 
---
Boil over
---
We‚Äôll make it
---
Better question why would you run noed on spirit. If you are competent spirit player probably around 80% of your matches not reaching endgame. Instead of noed and spirit fury run monitor and abuse + nurses calling and you be sniping survivors left and right.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs not my original artwork, saw it somewhere and saved it.
---
I‚Äôm not sure where it originally came from
---
What would you like to see done to boil over and we‚Äôll make it?
---
Lmao understandable I would have shared it too. I will be sharing on Ps4
---
Remove kindred, turn it into a base power survivors have, need it so it‚Äôs not overpowered
---
I think if **Beast of Prey** just removed the red stain altogether it would still only be "good" while having a significant buff. 
---
It would be nice if **Up The Ante** was just reworked altogether to be more of a gambling perk. Maybe giving Great skill checks an extra progress boost while causing Good skill checks to suffer a slight penalty or even get treated like missed checks. Missed skill checks could show the killer your aura for a few seconds. If you're confident, it could shave a decent 10-15% off a gen. If you make a mistake, the consequences are a lot worse than normal. 
---
**Shadowborn** is one of my favorite perks for its quality of life improvements. I just wish it gave something a little more impactful on gameplay, like possibly causing survivors to appear brighter against the environment or giving you a UI notice when a survivor in close proximity has been looking your direction for a few seconds.
---
I think **Monstrous Shrine** should be reworked to mark a specific set of 2 or 3 hooks. The marked hooks give a point boost to the killer and survivors who rescue others from them. Then, give the hook extra progression speed when you are outside a certain radius from it, along with extra unhook time. It's anti-camping, gives points to everyone, and encourages survivors to prioritize unhooks more. 
---
It would be nice if **Coulrophobia**, **Unnerving Presence**, and **Overwhelming Presence** got the same treatment as the survivor AOE perks, making them last for about 15 seconds after they leave the killer's terror radius. 
---
I think **Wake Up** should be a 20-25% gate-opening buff since you're dedicating a whole slot to it. 
---
I'd make **Hex: No One Escapes Death** give you tokens equal to the number of dull totems on the map. Each hit expends a token, and when you run out of tokens the speed buff and Exposed status ends. That way if survivors cleansed all but one totem, the killer only gets one free down. It would make the perk more fair at least. 
---
**Pop Goes The Weasel** should make the gen shoot confetti when the killer kicks it.
---
God damn one hit killers XD
---
I saw the post too, but I wasn't going to say anything. Butlike you took me there lmao
---
Not just a hat. A Fedora hat, the best hat next to cowboy hats.
---
Wow better tea bag because you completely outplayed that killer with your ability to hit a skillcheck.
---
I 100% agree with al of these
---
Oh. O_O I've never seen it before.
---
I hope you reported the killer and send this video to bhvr.
---
Lmao
---
Boil over struggling effects as of right now is actually increased swerving. It needs to be faster wiggling or put the two together because there is no incentive to get it.
---
We‚Äôll make it is only used by selfless players. We need a way for it to benefit these team players. These players are using up a perk slot to help others, but those selfish players are too busy running MoM, selfcare, urban evasion, and adrenaline.
---
Tell that to console players, the scratch marks just vanish with Lightweight :(
---
I‚Äôm talking about the other scenario where the killer isn‚Äôt near. They‚Äôre just afraid to unhook because he might come back and they‚Äôre afraid he‚Äôll go for them. They have to make sure he‚Äôs 100 miles away twiddling his thumbs before they get the unhook.
---
Gay friends can be very sassy and indecisive. Try feeding them a snack of compliments before asking what they want to eat.
---
I agree
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the person you should ask. I believe it wouldn‚Äôt be possible.
---
Gay friends already know what‚Äôs for breakfast the next morning
---
Only listen to the loud guitar riffs, ignore the background music. Also it's much slower than the usual song like "Ha. P. Birth. Day....To.....Yoooou" if that helps lol
---
Doctor is pretty fun madness stops healing, gen rush and hiding (until snap out of it) 
---
The shock stops looping and losing track of survivors (unless they have calm spirit) 
---
Add that with distressing (bigger tr + bigger shock radius) , nurses calling (see healing) and one of the perks that slow down actions when in your terror radius and I think your good for progress/healing stomping
---
Platform:  PS4
---
Type of Bug:  Ingame
---
Description: Unable to heal an unbroken injured survivor, or unable to be healed as an unbroken injured survivor. Bug occurs seemingly at random after getting injured, and fixes itself after the survivor is hooked. The prompt to be able to heal someone does not show and the action cant be performed. The bugged survivor is able to heal themselves with a perk or item.
---
Steps to reproduce: As the survivor, get hit once by the killer to enter injured state. Inability to heal happens at random.
---
Expected result: You should be able to heal other injured players, or others should be able to heal you.
---
Actual result: Sometimes, healing is not an option.
---
Reproduction rate: 30%
---
That's the most disgusting thing ever. Imagine that... A Leatherboi
---
Killers who are afraid of the dark
---
Stake Out is literally useless if you can consistently hit great skill checks, which most good players can. And it's still pretty garbage even if you can't...
---
Object Of Obsession, Play With Your Food, Kindred, Dance With Me, Hex: The Third Seal, Knock Out, Hope, Bond, Whispers... It depends on who you ask, but people in general don't think much of these perks, or use them much, yet they can be highly impactful.
---
I imagine most killer mains on reddit is thinking like you.
---
Fuck splinters, I have all the killers so it should disable those. I hate buying 7000 point boxes only to have a middle finger in my face.
---
It will always be brunch.
---
I hear it now, thank you
---
Decisive Strike: don't tunnel
---
Dead Hard: bait it out
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tunnel‚Äù is how you counter Decisive. I put the ‚Äú‚Äù around it because there‚Äôs pretty much no real way to counter it. 
---
If they use dead hard correctly, you can‚Äôt really counter that either. But if you catch them in an open area, they‚Äôll usually dead hard just to see if they can get away with something. So wait.
---
More like gets 4K 15 games in a row, but oh no they lost one game against swf group, better come to complain on reddit how toxic they are and game is imbalanced and unfair to killer mains.
---
Play alone and get better. 
---
If not, make some friends in the lobby.
---
No one left behind. It's complete ass. Not sure what to do with it tbh.
---
Well for ds just don't tunnel or if you have no choice just see if you're close enough to a hook just dribble him too it and do for dead hard just get close enough to where you don't have to lunge to get a hit or wait till they use it
---
i play it mainly on ps4, i never really see the same person in the same lobby and id say the player pool for ps4 is a pretty good size, although match making can take a while sometimes.
---
Why would I ask that question I'm so dumbü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
 Are you teling me there's no LFG reddit I don't like playing on my own like I just said, I'm sick of playing solo with randoms
---
You cant dribble anymore
---
That‚Äôs what happens when you tease the entity lol
---
Once you hook someone and they're freed, DS activates for 1 minute. If they are picked up during that minute, they get the skill check to stun you. Basically just don't pick them up for a minute after they're freed and DS deactivates.
---
For Dead Hard, just get right behind them and DON'T swing. Everyone will just waste it the moment you get into hitting distance.
---
Any recommendations of which dlc I should buy first?
---
Do the totems no NOED just like wait a minute and no DS or Borrowed Time. And there is 4 survivors to 1 killer
---
Listen boss, if you don‚Äôt like playing on your own, yet find yourself playing on your own, there‚Äôs not much for me to tell you. 
---
I‚Äôm gonna assume you‚Äôre either low rank, or just can‚Äôt play games by yourself if you have a reliance on people. 
---
The LFG sub is dead based on various other posts here. You could read the sidebar or use the search for this sub.
---
I bring rancor into games and I spare the survivor if they were solo queuing only to turn up with 2/4 of them smurfing. God I hate being in the 17-14 skill ratio
---
Make them two killers at once Tiffany and Chucky
---
trapper should kill them with a bear trap to the head
---
because youre not close enough and im trying to waste your time
---
Try the base game before buying dlc
---
Decisive Strike is a Obsession Perk, meaning anyone with the perk has a greater chance of being the obsession. Keep in mind that not every obsession will have DS, there are other Obsession Perks. Treat every obsession as if they have DS (dont tunnel, etc) because at the higher ranks chances are they do. 
---
Dead Hard is a different beast. There isnt really any counterplay aside from trying to mind game them into blowing it early. If you look to the side and back infront of you in a swinging motion you can sometimes bait them into thinking you *are* swinging, but thats about it. Alot of times newer players with DH will use it when you within swinging distance. Walk right up to their back (close enough to be touching them) and they might try and use it to get away.
---
Shadowborn could instead of what it does right now, could buff killer aura reading perks by a small anount. Kind of like Open Handed.
---
By the way, Open Handed being on a survivor, Ace, without aura reading bothers me. It should make aura reading perks for survivors two-way.
---
PS4 community is pretty chill.
---
Queues depends on your rank, but there are enough people playing Imo
---
Windows of Opportunity. I fucking love that perk. Maybe once I get really used to maps and pallet spawns it‚Äôll become redundant, but the information it gives me is so valuable in chases
---
*laughs in myers*
---
hes stalking you the entire time you do this, fool, ya fool
---
They‚Äôll make Tiffany dlc or sum shit lol but if they could focus on chuck himself there could be potential like having a mechanic with the spirit of demballa (voodoo curse) or make it into some kinda perk
---
I wouldn't say chill exactly just have a less chance of getting hatemail or trashtalked and a bit more kind mail.
---
You should get Cannibal for BBQ.
---
It makes farming bloodpoins a breeze
---
Well, there is no chat at the end of the match, so the person needs to go to your profile to trash talk you
---
Empathy, some say Bond is superior, but Empathy gives so much awareness that Bond doesn't.
---
Teammate gets hit? Ah, killer is across the map, plenty of time to work on gen.
---
Teammate seems to not have Self Care and running around like mad? I can help with that.
---
Sometimes injured people will open gates, giving awareness of it's location and progress.
---
Hahaha fuck
---
Doctor has a cap
---
I would very much be okay with this! But I think the BPs would need to be very substantial as you can spend the whole game on the hook...
---
It‚Äôd be hard to see his tiny midget ass
---
Hell yeah best stalker...maybe overthrow GF lol
---
Love love love it
---
Billy has multiple hats in different skins
---
No Mither. Buff it so it has built in Iron Will, start the round non injured so the killer doesn‚Äôt know you have No Mither, cannot be healed after injured. Hide the No Mither no heal sign on the icon so killer doesn‚Äôt know you have it, gives you a chance to pick yourself up if killer goes slugging.
---
Where‚Äôs that guy who said you can get banned for farming and should just play games like *this* normally?
---
Nobody: 
---
Killer mains: salt
---
Haha
---
Haha true
---
Yeah exactly, I hate how the perk is grayed out in both scenarios when simply the condition isn't met like the devour hope example I gave or when the perk is completely unusable.
---
But looping is a thing?
---
hopefully not as OP as GF i just wanna hear chuckys laugh when he hooks people or something haha
---
Would have probably dropped him either way
---
Imagine the hooks being tiny too. So instead of hooking you in the shoulder he hooks your leg.
---
Pretty sure there's a looking for players sub if you look at the info page for this Reddit. You could also try the dead by daylight forum site, there's probably something similar there.
---
yes, but the amount of time you can play a pallet is going to be roughly the same. you can waste extra time by running farther before having to play a pallet.
---
in the concept art you can see the side of his head. Looks kinda like a younger JJ Jameson
---
... Your missing the point...
---
Your fun as a survivor can be COMPLEATLY DIFFERENT to a killers mindset of fun.
---
If a survivor likes stealthy builds then they will like stealthy perks, if a killer likes gen stomping then they will like perks that slow gens
---
If YOU like solo perks that help you, you will like perks that refrain from you getting noticed And perks that can work as a plan B
---
If the killer like downing/killing the survivors then they will like "sweaty" perks 
---
seriously when haven't you known this?
---
LMAO
---
I could see him dragging the survivors to a hook and then laughing as he runs off to another generator screaming ‚ÄúAWAAAAAKE!‚Äù üòÇ
---
basically me
---
never too late to start! ;)
---
im sure you, a perfect human would never indulge in such plebian activities
---
GAS GAS GAS gotta step on the gas
---
You‚Äôre not dumb it‚Äôs always good to ask just in case. I‚Äôd probably use google to look more into it.
---
Tuning guide + Primer/Thompson‚Äôs Mix is instasaw. Yes.
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
I brought out the good china and everyone died before we even got to eat off it.

Hi, new person! NOED is a killer perk, it stands for "No One Escapes Death" (too much to type out each time, right?) and what it does is basically bump up the killer's speed and applies the Exposed status to survivors until either the trial is over or its totem (see below for that) has been cleansed; the Exposed status name is kind of misleading because it doesn't mean the killer can see where the survivors are, it means if the killer hits a survivor while they're Exposed then they go down in one hit instead of two. In the case of NOED, survivors won't know that they're Exposed unless one of them gets oneshot and then all of them can see that NOED is active (although they might be able to guess that without being hit if they see the killer is moving faster than normal).
---
NOED only kicks in if all the generators have been finished by the survivors (meaning they can go activate the exit gates to escape) AND the survivors haven't already cleansed all the dull/unlit totems on the map. It's meant to be sort of a last chance for killers to put some folks up on hooks before they all escape, and it's incentive for survivors to cleanse any dull totems they see before it might activate.
---
The part about totems is important because NOED is a hex perk. Hex perks are kept active through lit totems (these are the ones that look like a little fire is under the skull and bones to signal that a hex perk is attached to it) and survivors can cleanse them to either end the effect tied to that hex perk or if they're unlucky enough to cleanse Haunted Ground (another hex perk) then they accidentally trigger its effects. The killer can see on their map where all their hex totems are, but neither they nor the survivors can tell WHICH hex perk is associated with WHICH hex totem.
---
Dull/unlit totems will spawn on the map for every trial even if the killer doesn't equip any hex perks, and the fact that they're unlit signals to the survivors that they don't contain an ACTIVE hex perk. Survivors should still cleanse dull totems whenever they come across them even though they're not disabling one of the killer's active perks, because hey it's free points and more importantly you won't know until it's too late if the killer equipped NOED; also, since Haunted Ground and Thrill of the Hunt - both hex perks that are designed to work against survivors who cleanse every hex totem they see - won't go off for cleansing dull totems, there's less risk to cleansing dull totems than hex totems. If they haven't cleansed all the dull totems and the generators are activated, NOED activates in one of the remaining dull totems, turns it into a lit totem, and at THAT point survivors either have to GTFO or go find and cleanse the lit totem now containing NOED to stop its effects and be able to stay in the game a little longer (like if their teammate's been downed and they want to go rescue them without wanting to risk dealing with a NOED killer).
---
I meant to include this as your link for a full answer with just a small addition of need-to-know info you might need, but I ended up writing more than I thought, haha. You can still read up on the official info here: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death
---
I'd also recommend looking around that site for more info to help you, but if you have any questions about anything specific you can ask us here. Good luck out in the fog!
---
Get this it only happens when the gates are open if you are actively looping and messing with a killer while the gates are open you kinda deserve to be taken by the entity
---
This is why when you ask everyone to use BP/XP gain offerings during this event, you need to Specify "Gateau's" and not just say "Cake's"!
---
The people who downvoted are saying that. flashlight Meg / insta heal claudette are Not toxic
---
Same goes with you assholes that smurf and claim that "oh he is just helping me rank up" just fuck off
---
Excuse me... HA. Legion can get you into deep wounds thennnnn? The power doesn't help in chase at all once the first hit is there
---
I like hate mail, I enjoy receiving it on mortal Kombat
---
Nurse not top spot? Uhh what ever you say buddy
---
Michel tires up
---
Thank you u/WhaleBubbler, very cool.
---
She‚Äôs literally at the highest tier lol
---
She‚Äôs behind Spirit
---
Wouldn't Primer + Thompson's Mix also be instasaw since they technically both reduce charge time by the same amount? 
---
I thought only Tuning Guide + Primer Bulb was Instasaw and Tuning + Thompson's Mix was "Best All Around Billy" since your charge time isn't as fast as it could be (instead of tuning guide + primer) but you get fast charge and good cooldown + a quieter saw + reduced bump penalty.
---
I tried posting there before but got an error telling me I wasn't allowed to post.
---
Put Plauge in B tier and put LF in F tier and that‚Äôs pretty much my list
---
Appreciate the encouragement. But I work too much and am tired alot lol.
---
Why replace everything except super suit with noed

I want Randy as a survivor he‚Äôs my boi
---
1. Legion is a standard killer that gets looped like the rest so they are not good
---
2.How is Nurse BELOW hillbilly?
---
3.I don't see plague in s tier, she is an M1 killer when it comes down to it and a pallet stun removes her corrupt purge which is just stupid
---
4. Trapper is worse than Leatherface I think because without traps trapper is the most standard killer while LF can shred pallets at least
---
Not exactly. Instasaw Billy is fast charge PLUS fast cooldown. Primer plus Thompson‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt give the best cooldown.
---
Holy shit, it's in the original style of the show, they're good
---
Takes away a lot of skill from it
---
...congrats?

ez report ez ban

I stopped using the perk because of this.

Rancor and endgame - PS4

---
Yup, literally ever killer is toxic. There are nowneout there like me who just enjoy the game /s

Seriously though fuck those guys, they're why I never play survivor

Pretty much no

It used to be better, sadly it got nerfed pretty hard. If someone is in the dream state, they already double the exit gate opening time, so I guess it could okay on Freddy?

Being so good the killer has to tunnel and camp you cause he fears your power.

I think it is already fixed check the ingame bug report

Not to mention he can t-bag

Someone has thin skin
---
I dont blame them honestly, too many killers play super sweaty these days, noone wants to have to deal with bullshit anymore, yeah survivors do it too, but its nowhere near as prevalant as campers, tunnellers, sweaty builds, etc.
---
I dont play against anyone who runs anything sweaty anymore, nor do I run anything sweaty when I play as killer, I dont even bring items when I play survivor, and most of my perks are just utility perks that get rid of annoyances or make my gameplay a bit more friendly, Urban so hags cant fuck me over, iron will so I dont whimper like a bitch, dead hard for nurse, and the 4th perk changes depending on what I feel like saying fuck you to, DS for tunnelling, BT for camping, small game for NOED, etc
---
pathetic bullcrap community who the fuck do you think you are downvoting my other post bunch of cunts
---
Default speed is 20 seconds, dream state speed is 30 seconds, default + RM speed is 36 seconds, dream state + RM speed is 54 seconds.

They said they fixed it in the patch notes but I just faced him today and it's not fixed.

Definitely right about that

Most likely not because ps4 can't use mods why does people use it and get cautious that they might get banned but it's just a filter?
---
Legit haven't played Survivor in a month because of teammates frustrating me. Because I missed two season resets... I was all the way back to Grey ranks. Rank 17. I had teammates who would throw down pallets around a generator before starting to work on it. They would also sabotage hooks 100%
---
Incidius lol
---

---
Is there anywhere where I can get a crash course on this game? The new player guide on here doesnt work
---
Jeepers creepers or candy man
---
DS hits during the pick-up animation. It's impossible to dribble now.
---
When you swing, but miss.
---
&gt; Decisive Strike is an Obsession Perk, meaning anyone with the perk has a greater chance of being the obsession. Keep in mind that not every obsession will have DS, there are other Obsession Perks. Treat every obsession as if they have DS (dont tunnel, etc) because at the higher ranks chances are they do.
---
Actually I'm not sure if that's the case.
---
[Thanks to the bullshit way DS "Fakes" the first obsession] you can rest assured the Obsession NEVER has DS unless he's also running OoO or Mettle, or all four survivors are running DS.
---
Because of this, you can reliably tunnel the shit out of the obsession since they'll never have DS. Just treat all the non-obsessions as if they have DS though. 
---
I've been tunneling the obsession like crazy. DS's fake obsession is a doubleplusungood aspect for the game because it fucks over one random player by painting a bullseye on his back + if the killer is running Dying Light you have to worry because it can be unexpected cucked even if only one player has DS, they're never the obsession and can snatch your Dying Light away from you. 
---
I learned this the hard way after being tombstoned by a Dying Light Myers with a tombstone piece and judith's journal. Micheal blew his load (Judith's Journal gives you insanely fast stalking on the obsession) and tombstoned me about 30 seconds into the match with 5 gens left because Laurie's DS was totally worth getting me killed. The worst/best part was after Laurie hit the DS shortly after, Myers ragequit.
---
You don't need to remember them all. The game meta makes so few perks are more used than others. I'm new to killer, and the only survivor perks I really care for in the trials are the exaustion ones and decisive strike. Sure having a better knowledge of all the perks can be really useful, but a basic knowledge can already take you far.
---
I feel like the doc would give me the most powerful orgasm ive ever had. So I choose doc.
---
Just play Clown. You can hard-counter Dead Hard with his Solvent Jug add-on :), and you can throw a bottle at a slugged survivor before picking them up, so that they get slowed down if they free themselves with Decisive Strike.
---
You can also make sure to immediately down an unhooked survivor so that they go down under the hook, then being able to rehook them before DS registers. :))
---

---
An alternative would be having your friends join the lobby as soon as you open it, instead of sending out invites and creating that annoying spam on steam chat.
---
I mean why not? Its basically useless otherwise.
---
No people are just pulling more dirty tricks ie NOED
---
Literally everyone who comes up with the idea of a new Mori thinks of those. That's like taking credit for the idea of wiping your ass after taking a shit.
---
yesterday i sacrificed all 4 survivors and said gg after but then a survivor replied that my most played game on steam was wallpaper engine and that he would find me and slit my throat. Ah dead by daylight at its finest
---
From my experience with SFV and Dbfz, the matchmaking kinda of reduces this brutality. Also since they are 1v1 the matchmaking is way easier.
---
Chill overall just if you go against a swf and do poorly as killer you may get someone messaging you ez type stuff, or something along those lines.  Or the opposite if the killer camps/tunnels you (or plays toxicish I guess?) Sometimes they will message you hoping you be mad at them so they message ez type stuff. 
---
But more often I get kind messages
---
I actually think that We'll Make It is perfect the way it is. Yeah, it's a perk that is focused on helping others, but keeping other survivors alive for longer helps everyone, not just them.
---
Dream state actually makes it 40 seconds, and with full-stack RN, 72 seconds.
---
Remember Me is unfortunately not good on any killer anymore. 16 seconds is just not enough.

How about something like.. when the owner of We'll make it activates this skill, the affected teammate gains a stackable mini We'll make it that has the effect of 1/2 of the owner's current skill level. This would benefit not only the helper, but his team.
---
Billy can have a hat
---
Perk 1 needs some tweaking but I don't think it works very well as a concept. Perk 2 is a big nope because bloodlust is already the catchup mechanic. Perk 3 works to a pretty nice extent but you may as well just run Brutal Strength, since it does just fine and you don't even need the momentum of survs healing eachother.
---
True. I‚Äôm going to have to really look into how I want to build him. I‚Äôve gotten so used to using Ruin and I want to stray away from it but still be able to successfully slow the game down and maximize my BPs. I don‚Äôt need a 4K every game but I do want those delicious BPs.
---
that is the coolest!
---
Without ruin this happens tho
---
Yeah, if the killer isn't near and you don't unhook, why are you even playing? He might come back, sure, but you're sure as hell not going to get far if you can't/won't help your team.
---
Now i could be wrong, but i think he tried to make it apparent that you‚Äôre ‚Äútrash‚Äù
---
Pig was a junkie so it‚Äôs likely. Ghostface was a photographer who no one suspected to be the killer, so I think it‚Äôs safe to say that he was probably handsome.
---
My nasty pizzaface boy is finally in the top tier where he belongs :')
---
They‚Äôre probably being greedy as shit and don‚Äôt wanna burn an important pallet just to get cucked by the shotty hitboxes in the game. Lol
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
It's dumb, but not toxic.
---
Agreed
---
I like to combine Dark Sense with Poised and I feel like I become invisible after I complete a gen; I know where the killer is and they have no way to track me for a few seconds
---
yes, devs have said so
---
This was sarcasm right?
---
Clown skin with hat is best hat
---
Perk 1 I like simply because it's like sacrifice one gen to help slow the game down so they can't rush as fast.
---
Perk 2 Bloodlust is fine until the survivor loops you around a massive survivor-sided loop for a minute straight and bloodlust barely helps.
---
And Perk 3. I see the point there, do you have any recommendations?
---
He is Michelin man. He sells tires :)
---
I've been enjoying it on ps4 since last summer when it was a ps+ game. 
---
I would have never given this game a second glance before trying it free, but since then I've put so many hours into it that I've bought some of the DLCs with money to support the devs.
---
Survivor waiting times have during periods been brutal (in December and January I think, I recall sitting for 15+ minutes) but for the last few months they've been moderately better (maybe 2-3 minute waits). And killer waiting is almost non-existent, I don't think I've ever waited longer than a minute to hit a lobby
---
Fun af lots of salty survivors that bitch and complain when you don't follow  Thier rules.
---
#MichaelTiresUp
---
Why does claude have urban? What a neeeeerd
---
Thank you F_inTheChat very cool
---
I audibly laughed at that
---
They have no choice but to do gens while you're chasing someone though. Wouldnt call it rushing. But its a drastic percentage, hence me saying it should be tweaked. Also need to consider perks like dying light or thanatophobia (which I think is getting buffed soon, iirc). And yeah but you should typically not be chasing a surv for that long anyways. Break things off that are rough chases. And I've got nothing for perk 3, brutal strength and fire up already do similar stuff. Cant help ya there.
---
Hit the locker and then spam space and either you'll chainsaw them or pull them out.
---
The hell was the rank 4  doing? ü§® no perks?
---
Where's the mind game ?
---
Hehe :)
---
More gamodes would cause insane waitimg time. The playerbase is too small.
---
Doctor and plague: kind of a hat but not cool enough
---
Hit em‚Äô with that ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù and be on your way.
---
I feel like perk 1 is just kind of weird and would only really ever see play in gimmick builds.
---
Perk 2 would be incredibly OP, making looping for the survivor next to impossible for extended periods of time with absolutely no way to counter it and requires no skill on the part of the killer. Slowing survivor movement speed is much more impactful than you might realize, but there is a reason why no perks apply a hindered effect and no killers can even apply it except for the Hag with Waterlogged Shoe, Huntress with Yew Seed Brew and the Clown.
---
Brutal Strength already increases *all* break actions by 20%. Perk 3 increase a few by 15%. There is literally never a reason to run your perk over Brutal Strength. It would either have to break speed by substantially more, or effect a greater number of actions.
---
For DS. after downing a recently hooked survivor just slug them and wait 1 minute. 
---
Dead hard is just baiting it out. If theyre in the open and you are right behind them just wait and swing.
---
Probably thought doing SWF with players that low in rank would result in a noob killer
---
That's always made me laugh.
---
NOED: A perk tied to totems, takes up a perk slot, and can be prevented entirely, thus it's punishing ignoring your secondary objective.
---
"Noob killer needs NOED. L2P without a perk that rewards failiure!"
---
old MoM: A perk that LITERALLY just rewards failing, and completely shits on weaker killers while doing nearly nothing to stronger ones.
---
"It's perfectly balanced! Why's everyone only playing Nurse/Billy/Huntress?!"
---
GIVE ME A BUCKET AND I‚ÄôLL SHOW YOU A BUCKET
---
Well, it's obviously because she's furious NOED didnt proc.
---
Ya especially because killers like nurse would have super long wait times because no one wants to play against her
---
&gt;No hat
---
&gt;Plague
---
???
---
Captain Marvel apparently. :P
---
They can‚Äôt choose the killer? Just give make it less likely to play against certain ones, In the last few sessions i vs‚Äôd Ghost face, Probably 10 out of my 14 games and he‚Äôs annoying and boring. I‚Äôd much rather play against a plague but the next ones always fall on Michael myers or Spirit with a few well needed variations in the 4 games I don‚Äôt face another Ghost face
---
This the most survivor main post I have ever read
---
Michel Myers, here to fix your tires!
---
GREATER GOOD? - GET - GOOD! *Entity displeased.*
---
Quality shitpost.
---

---
I forgot to add that there would essentially be a +35% to blood points earned when facing a widely vetoed character (Killer And Survivor)
---
The true strength of Trapper is not his traps, but his ability to make the Survivors play like fucking morons and avoid all vaults.
---
Sweating- Outplaying the survivors to the point where they can't do objective, make saves, or get hatch.
---
Imagine loading into a game and the killer already kilt u hahaha
---
Basically.
---
I actually don‚Äôt mind Nurse, I‚Äôm sure the variations would vary from Nightmare and wraith to Ghost face and MM
---
THE PURPLE ONE IS A FUCKIN BRACELET
---
i am very angry
---
Not added.... Sweating and tryhards exist on both sides.
---
No to passives as it'd make everyone only use a few Survivors because their passives are much better than others. (Repair speed, vault speed, exhaustion recovery, etc.)
---
So what you are saying is "Nurse players should not be able to find a match"
---
It‚Äôs only a preference lol You could still pick that character if you wanted to
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone I‚Äôve played with hates several characters that are not Nurse (Including me)
---
No unfortunately
---
As someone who plays trapper I can confirm this, people avoid the shack too which is nice
---
He seems pretty inspired from that Gacy killer an his clown persona mashed into one.
---
A Ripper inspiration would be fine with me, but like you I dont want Actual Jack the Ripper in the game.
---
Bro these are my teammates at red ranks. Survivors will be stupid at all ranks tbh
---
You need to play a different game.
---
Nothing tbh. It only effects it very slightly so it's unnoticeable
---
nah, i just think he's cute
---
You should already be getting 5k points if the killer DCs....
---
He's really good for bloodpoints and finding survivors provided they don't have calm spirit or hide in lockers; but he's really meh
---
Idk why so many people don't want him lmao.
---
Got anymore of them **pixels**
---
Apparently people are suffering long queue times  and it‚Äôs probably their connection or the servers.  But I know that much lol It isn‚Äôt that I dislike him because i see him a lot.(but I totally dislike him) And I don‚Äôt know anyone that ‚ÄúMains‚Äù a killer, Sure some people prefer to use ‚ÄúThis‚Äù character or ‚ÄúThat‚Äù character but it‚Äôs Highly unlikely that everyone will set their preferences to avoid 2 of the same characters. From what I‚Äôm seeing the majority wouldn‚Äôt as they use those characters (Unless their hypocrites)
---
You do get points
---
Exactly, horror icon not matter what the size. People talk big shit until they get their ankles cut.
---
Add make your choice to that list. A perk that simultaneously rewards both not camping and not tunneling and is good enough to see general useage.
---
It's pretty usefull in slugging situations. But there are better perks than for that than buckle up.
---
You wouldn‚Äôt be paired with survivors that set their preferences to avoid those characters
---
\&gt;  The Character option is essentially to give the killers the ability to vote as well which has less of an effect as the perks are teachable.   
---
You... you do realize that you basically just admitted that this whole system is designed in the survivors favor... right? No one should get to \*choose\* what they play against. The uncertainty of which killer youre facing and which survivor has what is a core part of the game, and in my opinion, part of the fun.
---
Your ‚Äúoutstanding mindgame‚Äù is crouching in a corner?
---
"being against Freddy" big sad
---
I got 3 sacrifices first game i ever played lol. Almost all 4 but the last person jumped into the hatch before i could hit them a 2nd time.
---
No? Not everyone has level 40 characters with everyones teachable perks for every character. There‚Äôs just a possibility that a character could have that perk and since Survivors lack a ‚Äúmain skill‚Äù it would be less effective. And That‚Äôs fine, But for a lot of people, Not including the dozen of killer meta mains? Here would benefit from this. You wouldn‚Äôt have to set a preference so this doesn‚Äôt even affect you ._.
---
As a solo player who got tired of struggling because of inexperienced teammates, run Deliverance + Decisive Strike. It is not guaranteed that you will escape the trial but you will punish the killer.
---
Same here! Makes the game almost unplayable. No idea if the killer is close or not since it's just a heartbeat and no music. Also on the killer side chase music doesn't play so I'm not always sure if the chase was broken or not. Definitely needs to be looked at!
---
No one dodges Nurse from the lobby lol No one knows it‚Äôs a nurse until the game begins, Maybe we should make a post regarding the servers dbd uses because this is coming up a lot (Long search times as X killer)  but it‚Äôs a mixed bag, The idea is that those killers would play vs the survivors that set their preferences around a different killer, Where Someone set theirs as Freddy and Nurse, Someone else set Freddy and Spirit, thus Nurse would potentially get those survivors while Spirit would get the other. (The Same concept applies to freddy)
---
Beware man, survivor mains are awake and stalking the forum
---
GF is better than Myers? How many hours do you have in game? 20?
---
Prestiging is almost not worth it, unless you just want the bloody cosmetics or if you just want to say you did it. The changes in better item generation are basically non-existent so its totally up to you if you want to do it or not. Not required for good items by any means.
---
Therapist: "Meng Fin isn't real, she can't hurt you."
---
Meng Fin:
---
You wouldn‚Äôt match those players if they set their preferences to avoid ‚ÄúYour character‚Äù
---
Yeah killers and perks are two different things. Each killer has their own loadout and power that makes them stand out. If I ban a killer, im banning an entire kit. If I ban a survivor anywhere past rank 10 im literally just banning cosmetics.
---
Did you read? Its what character you ‚ÄúHate‚Äù not which ones do you ‚Äúsuck against‚Äù.
---
IM SORRY :(
---
Bond is actually the best survivor perk in my opinion
---
technically spirit has bandages on that counts
---
As a killer, I strongly suggest you stay near the hook. I definitely won't return there knowing that at least half of my opponents are there. I'll definitely continue looking for the two other immersed players while you heal and do gens.
---
Excuse you., And Nurse isn‚Äôt as hated as you would seem to think, I‚Äôm sure there will be variations of who votes to avoid what. She would get the people that hate Spirit and billy
---
Huntress‚Äô temper tantrum is actually adorable.
---
Wow... He full on deleted his account from that.
---
If stealthy survivors are something you struggle with or you just want to be able to track a bit better I'd say he's worth your time. Walking around in Treatment Mode is more helpful than people give it credit for and the add-ons make him a very versatile killer who can cause survivors to be annoyed as well. 
---
But if nothing else Doc gives a shit ton of Bloodpoints!
---
Np! Prestiging is fine, it's just not what it says on the tin lol
---
I use bond (best survivor perk, it has 101 uses), iron will, alert (bc when you know all maps you can see what pallets are being destroyed, so you don't want to get chased there), and balanced landing
---
What's stopping someone for swapping to the parties avoided killer? A fucking 50% BP loss lol. What's stopping someone from swapping a killer's avoided survivor? Nothing, because they won't even have to. They can literally just use that survivors perks on anyone else.
---
Um yeah 1.ignore the rank it‚Äôs meaningless 2.try killer if your sick of campers or 3.play with borrowed time and decisive strike
---
Bond is ok but I play a lot of swf so communication is king for me balanced I love and alert is an interesting choice tbh
---
Wow, to be nine again.
---
Maybe play immersed and let others be found and chased first if you're not confident in looping the killer yourself? Kindred and Decisive Strike are the way to go for campers. Kindred will let others know you're being camped and they can do gens first. Then when they save you and killer goes for you again, Decisive Strike and escape.
---
Wow howdy stranger didn‚Äôt expect to see you here
---
Well trolls gonna troll, What‚Äôs a -50% to a troll? Lol and Because the game only has a ranked mode for whatever reason, The annoying competitive people and the guys who play for fun are stuck in the same boat. This would work better in a casual MM but if that were available ranked would definitely be dead
---
The reason is the killer can now close the hatch. This is to prevent the annoying standoffs.
---
I had a nurse who farmed with us so why wouldn‚Äôt a nurse farm also?
---
You haven‚Äôt been downvoted to oblivion yet, I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs not that unpopular
---
They hate us cuz they anus
---
This is the kind of content I like to see
---
Buckle up is pretty bad unless you against slugging killer and that ace perk (I dont know the name: up the anty?) is really useless.
---
I really freaking love all of those ideas, but the one for the Wraith with crushing their head with his foot probably wouldn't even look all that great, since they're not into doing extreme gore, so definitely the bell would suit better (I know they show the Hag ripping out organs but it's low detail, and I don't think it even leaves the wounds behind, which would be cool if it did)
---
I would like to hear your ideas on how to implement chucky, like his power and how to reconcile his height difference
---
DS - Keep track of who you most recently unhooked, don't pick them up for a while. You can knock them down, just don't try to hook them.
---
Dead Hard - Walk up behind them and delay your attack by a few seconds. They will use DH, if they have it, to avoid the attack they believe is coming.
---
Was there salt in post game?
---
Similar, not the same. here is basically what MLGA did:
---
&gt;MLGA is a 3rd party tool that was initially made to allow you to check the ping to the killer or survivors you are connected to. At some point a "flagging" functionality was added to it, which allows you to flag a killer (or survivors) as "blocked" or "loved". It keeps track of the IP the player was using at the time. Next time you encounter that player, it will display "blocked" or "loved" if you have previously flagged them as such.
---
So if you "blocked" someone for being a good Nurse and if you encountered them again (which was possible at high ranks) you could just leave to avoid playing against a good nurse. If everyone did this against good nurses what happens? The killer has a difficult time getting a match because they're constantly avoided.
---
Now if everyone decided they would not like to play against the Nurse due to her potential to steamroll Survivors what happens? The chance to being matched with Nurses is much less likely and if the Killer decides they want to use Nurse anyways they're getting A 50% PENALTY which isn't fun in a grind heavy game such as DBD because it's much less effort to avoid something then try to improve against it.
---
&gt;The idea is that those killers would play vs the survivors that set their preferences around a different killer
---
In theory yes, in actuality this just lets Survivors filter out whatever they want without penalty (Survivors are just skins and can all loop a Killer the same) and at each rank where certain Killers are more common and viable and would be more expected you're forcing Killers to use something else or be severely punished for no reason.
---
Holy fuc
---
Nurses and Spirits will be sitting in lobby for an eternity then. It's understandable to lose against strong killers, but giving players the ability to cut them out of the game altogether is too much. It's like if killers could choose perks or items they want to avoid and never have to play against, DS, Adrenaline, Flashlights and Instaheals go straight out the window.
---
OP. I came back to ask how long have you been playing DBD?
---
I just hate when you say gg and you get hit with the "mmmmmmmm nah"
---
Oh man that has *got* to suck. Especially if you were hoping to just test Michael to see if you wanted to buy him
---
About 80% of them are useless tho. But thats just me.
---
no cap
---
Pig has 4 hats she gives away.
---
Survivors would of course try to avoid or "dislike" the strong killers because chances of winning against them are slim.
---
Strongest killers in game so far?
---
Nurse, Spirit/Billy.
---
Given the ability to "blacklist" certain killers they don't want to play against, who do you think 99% of survivors will pick?
---
The Freddy they can easily outrun and outplay? The Plague where it's as easy as not cleansing?
---
Of course everyone'd pick the same 2-3 killers that're extremely strong, and when that happens, Nurse, Spirit and Billy players will be sitting in lobby for hours and get no one, except probably rank 20s that don't know anything about the game.
---
Doc. That sounds kinky as fuck, right up my alley.
---
Great meme format
---
I‚Äôm curcimsuised so myers won‚Äôt touch me (reverse uno card )
---
Nope just survivors hitting great skill checks or pushing through e
---
I think if they ever were to do a Chucky/Child‚Äôs Play chapter they could only go about it in 2 ways.
---
A. Human Tiffany with Chucky as the ability
---
B. Voodoo enhanced Chucky (which would be ideal if they could work around financial constraints for new animations) 
---
You could have the killer be Tiffany and they could call her The Bride or some shit like that. The ability could be to briefly control Chucky in 3rd person possibly. He could crawl under pallets and move faster than base killer speed. Being stunned could break him out and it could also have a timer/cooldown. They could call the ability Revenge of Chucky.
---
As for just Chucky I feel like if they went that route the only issue would be the POV. as they clearly can‚Äôt have a killer fully in 3rd person. As for picking up he could use voodoo energy to levitate them somewhat like The Nurse (DS might be confusing as it describes you as stabbing the shoulder but whatever). He could call down lightning to break pallets. Not quite sure what his ability could be but they could do a million different things so that‚Äôs not an issue. He could control a voodoo doll or lunge on you idk. I‚Äôd like to see it involve voodoo more so but I‚Äôd be happy with whatever. I like alliterations so I‚Äôd call it like Damballa‚Äôs Due or something of the sort.
---
 
---
I have many more ideas but I tried to keep it somewhat brief.
---
depend of the killer, depend of the map and depend if it's a swf or a solo team.
---
I saw a concept where he would possess the survivor he downs and makes them hook themselves, and would return to the doll wherever it was left.
---
So what‚Äôs the point of Ruin then? I thought the idea of totem perks were that they would be particularly powerful but at the risk of them being destroyed. If survivors can just burn though generators regardless of Ruin then why isn‚Äôt it just a standard perk?
---
Ruin only works when all survivors go looking for the totem, this means zero progress is being done. The effect itself is RNG so most of the time it barely prevents gens from getting progressed. 
---
When you face a team that knows this, you can keep your totem.
---
"Farming is a bannable offense" says 1/100 people playing the game, believing his 1 report could end your whole career in DbD.

"TECHHNICKSHAN"
---
Thanks! Multitasking atm, It was a mix up due to reiterating mid-way. And Your statement stands in your head, There ARE variations of the ‚Äúlist‚Äù, You can look for similar comments as proof and we probably have different ideas as to who we‚Äôd avoid if anyone which also defeats your statement....again. You people are assuming if one party avoids. Character the entire community will do the exact same thing. That‚Äôs fucking stupid to worry about/mention as a possible con to put it bluntly.
---
The reason people don‚Äôt rate him high is because at the highest level of play, he has no way to beat the chase against better players so he‚Äôll get looped to death and he struggles hard. That‚Äôs why billy, nurse, and spirit are so good - they can pressure the map with their high mobility as well as being strong in the chase.
---
I think he‚Äôs fine for most players, however. He‚Äôs excellent at finding survivors and his madness skillchecks are harder for the average player. He‚Äôs super annoying to play against since you‚Äôll be in madness often against a good doctor and his terror radius is huge considering that distressing is a good perk on him.
---
Also, he tends to like perks that happen to give bloodpoints, like distressing, so you can farm with him. Tbh it feels good going braindead and playing doctor with distressing and bbq and getting 70k points per game
---
The only tier chart freddy ranked 'S' in
---
You're right. I always get Leader and Prove Thyself confused.
---
Mori is something that shouldnt even be in a game so i doubt they will add new features
---
Salty
---
Instant DC, even if she farms
---
Yes every negative opinion about something is being salty.
---
That's the most hilarious shit I've ever seen lmao
---
I'd have his terror radius the footsteps from the movies with no direction. His power would be to teleport to random good guy boxes around the map. As for the hooking he would just drag the survivors to the hook and levitate them up like Nurse does. Breaking pallets he could just stab them twice instead of the stomps. I play pig and Ghostface crouching just fine and he is the same size as they are crouching. Chucky isn't that small in the movies. Tiffany would be a skin like they did with legion. He'd be fun as Hell and with the teleport map pressure and mind game potential he'd be a good killer.
---
Survivors have it way worse. You can't hear Terror radius or the chase music. They messed up sound with the Ghostface patch
---
Oh I'm not denying that the perk was already bad before the endgame collapse now it's even more useless.
---
Since there's no longer a gen requirement there's no point in doing generators
---
You either just find the hatch or wait by an exit  gate for the killer to close the hatch.
---
Honestly I can't really think of a good change that could be done to it that would still be balanced
---
I still don't understand why either. She was a young adult who got home from work, which was a restaurant. Not to mention, she rode a bike on the way home. Why is a bunch of bandages her outfit?
---
I copied tru3ta1ent‚Äôs survivor build from his stream and I love it. Dead hard/Decisive Strike/Adrenaline/We‚Äôll make it (bringing a medkit). It‚Äôs just three S tier perks that are always impactful, and I started to love we‚Äôll make it. It saves you a few seconds of healing after unhooks, making it far safer since the killer has less time to come back. If I don‚Äôt bring a medkit, I swap it for Borrowed Time, since it has the same role of allowing you to unhook
---
No problem. I‚Äôve been sitting on some of these ideas for some time and never got around to making a formal post mostly because people, primarily on this sub, despise the idea of him being added but you seemed genuinely interested. The idea of him in the corn maps was one of the main reasons I pointed out that POV would be an issue for just Chucky. I truthfully do hate them and I hope they get reworked soon. They did point out they would be reworking old maps this year on the roadmap so there‚Äôs hope.
---
*SIGGGGGGGGGGH*
---
Huntress
---
you know you can choose you friends, contrary to your family ?
---
"What was that?"
---
"*EVERYONE RUN! HE PUT THEME MUSIC ON HIS KNIFE!*"
---
Find me 2 tier lists from reputable DbD players that have anything other than Nurse/Spirit/Billy as the top killers (which everyone would obviously avoid if given the ability to do so). It's not "one party" that avoids a certain killer. If everyone could, they would choose not to have to play against top tier killers for obvious reasons. You have it backwards. Just because "one party" or pretty much YOU don't want to play a certain killer, doesn't mean the entire community should have an option to not play against that killer or any killer for that matter, because I'll bet you 99% of players WILL pick the same few killers to avoid, because if they haven't already heard of the top tier killers from reputable Youtubers/Streamers, they'd have lost hundreds if not thousands of games against those killers and feel absolutely hopeless against those killers.
---
The doors are powered by the gens, they arent opened yet
---
He‚Äôs got something those other killers don‚Äôt have. The power of **voodoo**.
---
The greedy fuck wanting 100% for himself instead of 103% for everyone.
---
I despise corn maps because I can‚Äôt see anything when playing Hag, and I think that would only get worse as we go shorter. I would like to say that I am not for or against chucky at the moment. I would want to see how BHVR approaches it and judge that. Unfortunately I see a lot of creative ideas on this sub that just won‚Äôt make it, but hopefully some of them do. I really want to see a mariner killer, in much the same way you want to see chucky. 
---
Any thoughts on chucky specific perks?
---
I don‚Äôt think the perk is fixable tbh, I can‚Äôt think of anything else that it could do if you‚Äôre alone that makes me want to take it.
---
Also, 10-15-20% would mean at one killed survivor means you‚Äôre at huntress/hag speed and at three you‚Äôre faster than most killers lol
---
But if you do that then you're a camping tunneler and ThAt's sO ToXiCcC
---
The mask comes off as Myers has his day ruined by immesurable disappointment.
---
I used the silent bell add on
---
Many DC‚Äôs
---
Are you saying my elephant noises aren't good enough for you? I worked really hard on that!
---
We all know survivors teabag at any kind of a killer
---
No I mean repair speed.. the dude is old he can‚Äôt run
---
sometimes i get no skill checks on a whole gen D:
---
plus, latency, my guy. you seem to have a good one so greats are easy in your games.
---
i also suffer of this so i just stopped using Ruin and started playing mostly Spirit. needless to say when i play Doctor... i don't play him anymore =\ they still hit greats with Madness.
---
Post game chat should be survivor only. Fuck all this toxic shit.
---
But I gave a very balanced change which is grants repair or action speed for each survivor that‚Äôs hooked or killed
---
Thanks for them tips my man.
---
Excuse you. The whole problem here is that some characters will have (In your mindset) - Extraordinarily Long Wait Times that never end -, Which is under impression that the majority of players will avoid one particular killer more than others (Which is plausible but not realistic). I don‚Äôt need to find an opinion from some random dbd player because they don‚Äôt account for the majority you idiot. Calm down. Read. Think. Reply. Not the other way around
---
There is a huge differential between getting an extra hit and making all of your opponents one shot and getting a speed boost and i think you're downplaying that maybe just a tad.
---
Well your change is alright keep in mind it's very possible that all 4 survivors can be running this.
---
Which can make it a royal pain in the ass to deal with when multiple people are getting the boost at once
---
Spirits the only high rank killer I do well with but it gets boring as hell playing her constantly. I just wish there was a more reliable way of slowing the game down with weaker killers who have to deal with loops.
---
There is
---
I think this guy is trying to shitpost. No way is this serious üòÇ
---
Huntress would dig it, she sends so many hatchets into trees it's almost abuse.
---
You do realise that this majority you speak of don't agree with this either yes? Every single comment thread you try to convince the community why this would be a good idea, and you get downvoted into oblivion because of how obviously stupid this idea sounds. Maybe get yourself out of rank 20 before you actually start telling actual high ranked survivors/killers what'll be good for the game.
---
I can‚Äôt say I was gifted with the ability to come up with good perks like many other people in this sub lol. I think it would be good if they gave him some Hex and Obsession perks. Makes sense because the whole voodoo aspect and his main goal in most of the films being to possess a specific individual.
---
That's a shame then.
---
Clips like this make me wish console had post game chat lol. That nea had to of been salty
---
How did it take you all this long
---
This is amazing!
---
You can't hit survivors it's toxic and unfair
---
I mean... That doesn't really change anything though? Yeah killer is better to play than ever before but that doesn't mean you still have any real control if you're not Nurse. Survivors always have the advantage against anything but an omegablink Nurse if they're good enough and try hard enough. Groups that are good enough to count as unbeatable though are rare, and this game will never be balanced to remove them, but it is objectively true. 
---
Also they need to rework a lot more maps, because that's where the biggest amounts of bullshit come from.
---
As a survivor sided player, it's not very enjoyable getting lumped in with every "survivor mains *insert flavor of the week complaint*"
---
Let's not start doing the same.
---
I vote Pig.
---
Because she's a spirit with probably no clothes on but game doesn't wanna show us them japanese tiddies?
---
Cant instaheal when you get pulled off the gen lol
---
We got one single Hag tiddy tho.... Why no Rin tiddy? &lt;.&lt; lol Not knocking her design either, it looks cool overall, but paired with her backstory, it is just a bit odd.
---
No? It's supposed to make it larger. Such as on spirit where you don't hear her phasing if you're in her terror radius benefits from having a larger one. Same with people using say overwhelming presence or unnerving. Just some examples.
---
As discussed hundreds of times , survive with friends makes this impossible
---
Are you using 5.1 or 7.1 sound?
---
Salty killer main...
---
Each gets affected by 1 of them abilities
---
If the killer commits to camping a surv they should lose at least 3 gens. Also if they don't have a 1-shot you can save if you're ready to take a hit for the other surv.
---
Thank you for telling me
---
The reddit community are definitely the minority actually, In most cases they are, Since everyone else are too busy playing the game or looking for memes because they don‚Äôt care about it that much to get involved while the ‚Äúcompetitive players‚Äù that wouldn‚Äôt break even in an actual competitive game adds to the toxicity because the game isn‚Äôt meant to be competitive, It just has ‚ÄúRanks‚Äù probably at the request of people like you. Additionally it‚Äôs essentially mob mentality, The majority of the comments were mislead because they misinterpreted something and immediately downvote it which is essentially another day on Reddit. It means very little, Especially when the only ‚Äúcounter points‚Äù are ‚ÄúEvEry oNe iS gOnnA bAn mY nUrSE aNd I dOn‚Äôt liKe iT‚Äù to turn it into a meme. Mob mentality is a tragic thing
---
How in the hell would you implement Chucky in DBD anyways?
---
Hag tiddy not visible in game tho. Judging by how visible Rin's bum is, if they showed tiddies, mmmmm mm
---
Play who you like.
---
This is the most satisfying part of being a killer
---
I wouldnt know since all my in game music has bwen bugged since the ghostface update üôÉ
---
Every killer has ruin in every match I play, so I got to practice a lot to hit those ruin skill checks. If ruin isn't destroyed, I'm OK with it because I can still repair the gen. Unfortunately with the survivors I get paired up with, they are allergic to generators until the hex totem is destroyed.
---
Yeah. It's better to disable the weak ones. The problem lies somewhere around the fact there usually isnt many weaker ones.
---
2016 was a wild time... the bloodpoint bug was great too wher eyou could literally Bing Bong a hooked person forever... and still do it after they died for points (beyond the Max cap)
---
Could in theory Bing Bong up infinite blood points on wraith for about 2 days before it was fixed
---
tires up
---
Yea this totally wasn't on the front page or anything and this totally isn't stolen.
---
yeah..... not happening :D
---
Bottom right corner next to your perks will be an icon if your unhooker has the perk
---
Since almost every killer and their moms are running Hex Ruin, survivors get more used to hitting Great Skill Checks / Hex Skill Checks. 
---
Soooo, thanks to Hex Ruin, I hit Great Skill Checks / Hex Checks at roughly 80% now. I appreciate!
---
Every killer uses ruin everygame, survivors at high ranks dont care about it anymore, just work through it.
---
This happened to me yesterday but luckily the killer wasn't near. All the others survivors already had spawned and they were doing a gen next to me.
---
My ping was 80ish if I remember right and never had loading issues since the game is on SSD.
---
Wtf killer is that? I‚Äôve never seen that in all my time on xbox
---
Should‚Äôve looped him properly.
---
Wraith bing bongs on the survivors head.
---
Well they aren't as good in red ranks but they're still usable
---
So what are high rank killers to do then other than play Nurse, Spirit or Billy? It gets boring playing the same ones over and over but to stand a decent chance at winning a match you need to use them.
---
Just enjoy yourself man. I mean Wraith, just have fun.
---
max durations add ons, or button. try not to miss your frenzy (duh) and they have normal speed and terror radius. since you don't have all the dlc you can't use bbq and chilli which is (in my opinion) one of the best perks for killers in the game (unless you DO have leather face) all I can say now is just to practice
---
If you‚Äôre going to go nitpicking through random things at least give your opinions on the things you skip over. 
---
Your first ‚Äúpoint‚Äù mentions several characters, You can only ‚Äúavoid‚Äù 2 and That‚Äôs definitely not what you‚Äôd probably face, just useless speculation with no point behind it. It sides with my suggestion because you probably ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt apply your statement to any other character and realize there are multiple killers that fit in this scenario‚Äù .  
---
Random quote followed by what i can only assume pure stupidity? ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be forced‚Äù, - References that they will receive a blood point penalty but fails to mention anywhere where i am literally taking away their ability to choose a character. Additionally this is completely ignoring the fact that you wouldn‚Äôt normally be matched with a Killer you‚Äôre avoiding. Did you even read?
---
Longer wait times are not really applicable since the servers routinely have long waiting times and this is under the assumption that the majority of players are vetoing the same character which isn‚Äôt realistic...for the 3rd time? Lastly why don‚Äôt you try that and get downvoted because everyone things they‚Äôre all nerfs and refuse to remove the downvote because ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt have to‚Äù
---
I hate sprint bursts that come out of no where. I had a guy save it then he ran into a tile broke sight and stood still. I found him and he zoomed off.
---
It was a bit hard to hear at first for me too, start at 0:26 and you should hear the guitar strum the "happy birthday dear (name)" part of the song.
---
I mean ruin still works against a good chunk of high rank survivors and it still slows them down a little. But really you'll still have a good chance of killing two people with other killers. 
---
I stopped running ruin on most killers tbh, ruin should be a benefit you feel on slower killers, if you run it on nurse its not gonna feel like anything on wraith.
---
actually I do have Leatherface, my big brother is really nice lol, I figured BBQ would be good on Legion to chain. thank you for the help!
---
I know it is like... a totally late reply lol, but I just had a tiny idea.
---
Tatum's symbol for her perk is of course a doggy door \[possibly with her trying to fit herself through it lol.\]
---
Sasha's would be a radio tower.
---
And Helen's can be the tiara she had!
---
Chucky seriously? Why would people want a midget as a killer
---
his powe itself is meh. It really only helps with finding survivors, which it does do really well, but not much to help in chases. He does however have dome of the best addons(that arent broken) in the game
---
Don't disrespect vommy mommy
---
You can go ahead and delete now. *shudders*
---
Would not necessarily call it nerfs. 
---
Yea the addons got tweaked a bit, but stalking while leaning being twice as fast in general now plus the removal of the proximity noise thingy at least on paper outweigh the addon tweaks i think.
---
Then again i dont play ghostface, don't know what Ghostface players think of the changes.
---
Selfcare is pity perk. You took a hit and shitty player needs to heal up. 
---
Dead Hard is a pity perk, you are so bad you would go down but you can skip one hit to feel better about yourself. 
---
Decisive strike is a pity perk. You were downed. Again. Have some pity and try again. 
---
I can go on if needed. 
---
NOED is good for a killer with a slow early game (such as Shape). When you get gen rushed for not having ruin, you still got NOED. Also unlike in your scenario, if you have killed 2 already and NOED pops you can secure 3rd and maybe 4th. It‚Äôs not just for ‚ÄùaT LEaSt YoU cAn GeT oNe KilL‚Äù. 
---
Just because you are too stupid not to counter it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a pity perk.

Think about it. We have nerfed so much of the survivor's kit that *adrenaline*, fucking *adrenaline*, is now at the top of things to complain about.
---
First game as survivor: DC's LMAO üòÇ
---
Okay, so, I've only starting playing a couple days ago and see this "Nurse is OP" stuff and have one question:
---
Is that a meme? When I tried her, she was super slow and her blink ability was not even close to what I was expecting. The range wouldn't even clear an obstacle and you look down after using it, letting whoever you were chasing get away. Am I just missing out on strats or is she the meme-tier character of the game?
---
bamboozled my dude you learned the hard way [üòÇ](https://emojipedia.org/face-with-tears-of-joy/)
---
frenzy ruins it yes. and iron maiden is only good on huntress and doctor. huntress because she can get hatchets faster and doctor because people hide in lockers to escape his madness inflicting terror radius
---
Nurse, best killer in the game but console framerate fucks her over auite badly, so not a lot of people play her
---
yeah but you can have a rough idea of where stuff spawn's on each map
---
Now this right here is exactly what I was possibly looking for lol. Thank you for this. It completely makes sense now. I‚Äôm definitely aware of the fact that people act a certain way with certain people but I was not aware of the term code switching. I‚Äôll check it out.

---
Oh noice didn't realise that.
---
Wow, so survs ARE dumb after all.
---
When you have the tombstone price and fuck the guy who's been t bagging you up
---
I just love how, me absolutely destroying you, and you not liking it, equals me being trash.
---
"No need for NOED, just bring Mori instead"
---
Complaining about BT, are you one of those salty tunnelers?
---
I feel like the only meta perk people dont consider overly BM is self care, I dont hear too many people bitching about it, but it's also not quite as stupid strong as it once was either
---
The second you get into evil within 3 with tombstone, they survivors are fucked.
---
Oh no, I‚Äôm definitely not one of those. In fact, I believe The Office never saw a reboot because of this very fact. No one can take a joke anymore and it‚Äôs ruining comedy. Someone else commented and explained to me so now I have more context of this video. Some comedians portraying how Obama would seemingly ‚Äúcode switch‚Äù or in other words act one towards certain people and another to others.
---
I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm aware that Peele is a bit left leaning so I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was a comical piece just to be comedy or a comical piece that had some sort of message or deeper meaning or something I don‚Äôt know. But like I said, I asked a question and it eventually was answered so no drama here. I know his partner Key did a substitute teacher video that was pretty funny. That‚Äôs about all I know as far as their material goes.
---
For real delete this. So what that they rushed together?
---
No name shame please, if you can cover names would be great .
---
And yes idiots rush to unhook survivor in first 2 sec I know many idiot do that they can‚Äôt wait to make sure that the killer left.
---
There are plenty of meta perks outside of NOED. I don't ever run it because I don't like the perk. It certainly isn't needed.
---
You have to report in game, send a ticket with CONCRETE proof of the lag switch and post game pictures to prove the lag switcher is the person you reported. It has to look completely intentional otherwise BHVR will tell you "we can't ban people for their net's performance"
---
Maybe not the best but Bond is highly underrated by almost everyone. I routinely hear OhTofu talking about how much he loves it lately
---
Typical salty survivor delusion. Probably should black out his name tho.
---
You will need more than a couple days playing DbD to learn how to chase and not lose survivors.
---
Lmao I'm pretty new to killer üòÇ but yeah I guess I should have thrown an /s in there.
---
why tf my tire so up?
---
Bond is really great for solo queue in particular.
---
No I'm a survivor main. I recently encounter a teammate with adrenaline bt deadhard and instaheal and he complained about NOED lol
---
Rarely.  Even with obvious video evidence.
---
I'm a green killer though. This is my first rank reset playing as one.
---
In a survivor main too :(
---
Hillbilly could be a cheesey pizza?
---
gg ez
---
In not complaining I was trying to make a point about survivors that complain about NOED as they have cruch perks and item
---
I've never needed one before. I have like 30 and I just figured if they were gonna try their best I should too. And that's not noed lol that's a Mori.
---
Hehe
---
She inhaled too much clown gas
---
Dead hard: easily baited
---
BT: just don't tunnel 4Head
---
Adrenaline: ok yeah maybe could be slightly nerfed but still isn't ridiculously OP, it's a reward for doing the objective
---
Instaheal: it's one add on that gets used, and yeah I guess is probably too strong but once used they're in a weak position/franklins
---
Flashlight: face wall/look down/franklins
---
NOED:  a reward for failing your objective that helps you pass it in two different, very strong ways and is countered by survivors going out of their way and wasting time for something that may not exist
---
I'm not saying NOED is OP because just do totems lmao (although I do still hate it as I am fairly new so don't know most totem spawns) but there really isn't much of an argument here.
---
It‚Äôs usually lag or an exhaustion perk bugging when you see that
---
Those who can't count to five, deserve to die üëç
---
Ah ok, I‚Äôve levelled Claudette to level 18, I‚Äôll try get her teachables. Thanks for the advice
---
I'm a survivor main too and I recently got a teammate that complained about NOED when he had all cruch perks and items
---
There are like a handful of nurses that are so good you have no chance to win. The wprat thing to happen is you die in a videogame get over it
---
only tier list i care about
---
What system did you recorded that on?
---
Lord knows what would happen if you played the Reverse card in Uno against that guy..
---
Ive been playing for a week. Although its fun, getting rekt by some next level killer isnt much fun
---
I'm not survivor main
---
The other thing that I read really a lot is: "lol you use Noed on *nameofthekilleryouplayed* git gud". But I feel like this perk war is more a killers thing. I mean playing both sides after 1000+ hours it looks like this to me
---
I dont mind dying in a fun game against a fun killer, also dang people got offended for that, aight then. And yea I get that everything cant be perfect and always fun.
---
There is not a single perk that is more crutch than NOED.
---
Yeah, if you run all crutch perks then you can't really complain but otherwise it's debatable. Like I run spine chill, lithe, self care and either WGLF or adrenaline (normally WGLF) so my build isn't too crutch focused
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt remember a clusterfuck involving Donald Trump.
---
Oh boy where‚Äôve you been over the past... decade?
---
If you wanted a smaller terror radius you just wouldn't use the perk right
---
Just to be clear I am NOT complaining. I'm trying to make a point. Survivors tend to be toxic and use cruch perks and items but they complain about NOED. I am a survivor main too btw
---
I have to admit it's sometimes surprisingly difficult to keep track of how many totems have been destroyed since you're not the only one doing it 90% of the time.
---
Thats what you get for playing swf
---
That NOED change is exactly the thing I've been looking for
---
Surprised you did that, in the biggest map, without ruin, what where they doing letting you kill them ?
---
Yeah, that's not a perk that can be removed from the game by good players by just spending 15-30 seconds doing totems each, it's an unavoidable offering that cuts required hooks in 3.
---
It doesn‚Äôt change your rank. It ‚Äúcopies‚Äù your progress from the last match, but that‚Äôs only a visual bug. You either lie or have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
To prove that, play a match as a killer and then play a survivor game with a friend and ask him to DC while the match is loading. You‚Äôll see... killer emblems on your survivor
---
I find if i dont let go on first gen i get almost no skillchecks

Same. It's rare for me to meet people who aren't selfish...
---
On console anyway, due to the frame-rate improvements, great skill checks are night and day easier to land,
---
lmao I just saw those downvotes, what is wrong with people. Bond is a better selfcare, it has SO MUCH different uses, more you use it, more uses you find it has, it's even good in SWF, it just gives you so much vital information that can change the match if you use it correctly
---
Surprisingly when the extended blood hunt and anniversary event were both active almost every nurse I encountered wanted to farm.
---
He's serious he actually downvoted me
---
Then you should be talking about what's over or underrated unless you've played against experienced survivors. Otherwise the statement doesn't mean anything, especially if you are playing with a Mori. I agree that the perk is overrated, I didn't even run it back when I played enough to maintain rank 1 on killer.
---
The plague is/was literally an ancient pagan priestess who dedicated her life to Enki and Nergal. Pretty religious to me...
---
I‚Äôve been running the typical M1 killer build, Enduring fury, BBQ and Ruin,
---
I was slightly miffed when he fucked yo ghostfaces lore I mean not even right at all like so far left he was going right
---
Preferance.
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, Enduring and Spirit Fury.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel and/or Surveillance are also good choices.
---
buy a pair and stol using "unpopular opinion" when you want to express something.
---
Honestly it wasn‚Äôt my initial thought to unhook. What I was thinking in my head was that I was already gonna get hooked so might as well take away that hook near the gate and see if I could wiggle out otherwise I would‚Äôve been dead on hook. To my surprise it worked out well and kind of toxic in my mind lol üòÇ
---
If you want to get specific, either Iraq or Armenia. She was born in what‚Äôs now Iraq but died in Armenia
---
I've not long woken up from a night out drinking and and this made me giggle uncontrollably
---
OMG Freedy has a hat! 2 OP PLZ NERF!
---
This is a good idea, but I would get rid of the generators because the killer is eventually going to be revealed and it‚Äôs basically going to be the same thing as a regular game. 
---
I would make it more like roblox‚Äôs murder mystery and include a weapon for one survivor that can kill the killer. The killer would be given an insta kill ability when ever he gets close to a survivor, so it‚Äôs well balanced.
---
I died xD  
---
For me Ghostface sounds as if he just jerked off
---
Leatherface‚Äôs pretty lady outfit (at least in mortal kombat) is great! And I enjoy santa clown
---
ah well my night ended vsing a 7 blink no fatigue nurse who had the first person down within 3 seconds in one hit to a Billy that just straight up walked through walls on lery's. both games were over within 3 minutes with 4k... I really don't get the fun of cheating
---
r/dadbydaylight
---
Hopefully they realize that the main issue with this game balance wise is that gens go by too fast. Of course there are situations I‚Äôve experienced where it feels like they go by painfully slow such as when you‚Äôre with low ranks or people DC‚Äôd/died too early, which isn‚Äôt as much of an issue now as it was before since the hatch opens regardless of how many gens are complete.
---
He has probably the most scary stun sound in the game
---
WwwweeeeeEEEEeeeeEEEEEEEEEeeeeEEEeeeeeREEEEEEEEEE
---
I think hed be sick if they could figure out a way to make it work, but we all know they struggle to make things that work properly.
---
I think you could actually make this list properly if you cared about doing it right and not just shitposting. there are some great designs and some bad ones in the game
---
I still can‚Äôt quite figure it out... I think it was a inexperienced swf group because they were all working on the same couple generators. Every time I hooked one of them, all three would come for the save instead of one going by themself and the two others work on a gen. It was very strange!
---
Spirit's stun sound fits the second category, Hag sounds not too good :D  
---
  
---
Why dou you sound like an airpump?  
---
WAAAAH  
---
I take it back, I take it back!
---
It is a shitpost but I also agree with it, legion is the only design I don‚Äôt like while I love the rest
---
But it wasn't like that before, the car was always at the back
---
For the future, when creating a meme post, use "image &amp; video" next time
---
If they're smart about when they pop their frenzy and their disciplined with their swing it is a gimme hit.  I've 360'd legions too to counter their ability but that speaks more about the mistake they made with their swing than it does the juke I did.
---
What perk is that at the bottom?
---
I mean insta heals are pretty unavoidable as well. But like I said it made for a really fun game. I had to hit each of them about 5 times to complete a Mori on them. 
---
I'd say with their strong builds and smart play as well as their add-ons and communication, my Mori evened the game out. If I would get close to getting a kill someone else would be there to take a hit or insta heal.
---
Honestly though it was a blast. It was like playing the game to the best of it's capabilities. Usually either one side is super good or the other is. But it was evenly matched. 
---
We all used the "OP" items and it made for an interesting game. That was my take away.
---
Remember the wikia is fan edited, I think they‚Äôre basing her race on her hair (which is dreaded) but given the conditions she nearly died in and how long she was there, her hair would probably be extremely matted created a dread-like style.
---
if  you're solo, you want to confirm seeing all 5 destroyed. you can predict where the rest is basing on ones you've destroyed, as they rarely spawn close to eachother
---
Trapper mori: *rotates 90 degrees*
---
Congratulations you have acquired a wraith mori
---
Thanks, it's posts like this that will prevent Ghostface being buffed to an almost playable or fun state.
---
Hey, now hold up a second...
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs because of her hair, it‚Äôs probably because she uses vodun which was made in Africa.
---
Plague and Ghostface belong in what the fuck.
---
Ever since the abortion of original Legion they're too scared to make a power that isn't "beg on your hands and knees for the survivors to let you have a power."
---
Nice work
---
Wholesome piggy giving hats &lt;3
---
Too perfect are you farming with survivors?
---
Each guitar stroke is correct in pitch but not timing. Follow along the strokes with each syllable and there you have it.
---
Cool, what rank ?
---
Don't give them ideas for more monetization.
---
You simply got out-gamered. Totally wasn‚Äôt a lagswitch or anything
---
Or I, myself did 4 totems and trusted my 3 other teammates that atleast one of them would be sane enough to do 1.
---
Nope, after being untouched whole game, I will be the one taking a hit after 5th gen. And, while I hope one of two survivors, which I safely unhooked (by sacrificing time that I could have invested in finding the 5th), will nonchalantly start the EGC and walk out hand in hand with the 3rd gen rushing douche. 
---
Let the idiot who was concerned about others die.
---
Thanks for the explanation. I honestly learned a lot thanks to this comment.
---
That was my INTENDED point. I just came in *a bit* too aggressively.
---
This,,, isn‚Äôt toxic??? Just stupid. Very, very stupid.
---
Cheats
---
Wdym resilience gives bonus when you‚Äôre injured.. you described what it exactly does currently
---
Easy, you just need to get farmed without BT
---
Ps4's unbreakable (Bill's perks have different pictures on PS4 and he's not in the game, so they appear on the bloodwebs of all survs randomly)
---
He's garbage unfortunately. Such a wasted potential...
---
"We've been planning this escape for five gens"
---
I believe it‚Äôs about what they look like and not design of the power.
---
Last time i played against a Michael Myers he didn't used the Ruin perk but every survivor was cursed with Ruin.
---
And ofc it's a Dwight
---
How can you git gud against something that ignores pallets,walls and floors ?
---
That could have been third seal or devourer hope too.
---
Legion should have his own tier but...                             ***H A T***
---
4K's are too easy until you get to good ranks, red ranks without huntress spirit nurse or hillbilly is unplayable.
---
As somebody who used to play only survivor, I can confirm survivors have more toxic tendencies and if anybody should be prohibited from using post game chat, it should be survivors who have been flagged for toxic behavior or something ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Early you down the more likely the dc
---
This is nice. I like this.
---
They haven't publicly stated, but they've made enough statements about how they want survivors to do more than just gens to think that they're not accounting for doing five totems in whatever they're balancing.
---
The only problem that i can notice is that the chin is way higher than it is normally.
---
the Dream Witch will be also cool, both of them have interesting powers which will be fun to play against as a survivors
---
He's too dangerous to be kept alive!
---
I main Jeff and this is a dream for me. XD. instead I got open a gate with tapp.
---
What a tight bugger he was. Wait... Did I just assume gender?
---
üòÇ
---
He could just be a newer player you know?
---
I've done this multiple times all you really have to do is get then hooked for enough times, the other stuff comes naturally
---
Insta-hatchets were never nerfed and the only thing op about survivor is the countless jungle gyms and infinites on every map. Also being able to zoom across the map as spirit with no warning to survivors (that can be yoinked off of totems and gens) isn't overpowered... sure.
---
Currently sitting at Rank 8
---
no ?
---
If it's my 2x BP I'm playing normally, if it's someone else's I'll go easy on them. If I have one and they do too, I'll go extremely easy on them (2 hooks each, maybe a few extra downs). If there's 3+ in play I farm.
---
The "cursed" status effect is the same for all effects.
---
Where‚Äôs ghost face?
---
he said cursed with ruin moron
---
Sometimes it backfires because you get to see how many stupid things your teammates are doing.
---
Like youre running the killer around the map and see a random teammate at 30 meters hiding in a locker because reasons, while another teammate has been following you for 3 entire minutes for the EPIC FLASHLIGH SAVE (gone wrong, mistimed, still 5 gens left)
---
And thats when you go back and play killer.
---
I still love Bond tho
---
The post wasn't made to brag about my ultra mlg win, it was to show that survivors who literally throw themselves at my chainsaw, and then disconnect can somehow cause me to lose rank.
---
Not all game mechanics are perfect, and you'd be absolutely ignorant to stand behind this particular one considering I almost gaurentee you have nothing to do with the game's development. 
---
If you believe the survivors in this particular situation weren't the cause of the problem, then I'm going to assume you're just as bad as the people I were versing.
---
And for you to imply I have to play at a level below my means to account for trash survivors like yourself - suggests to me you need to read the rules more than I do.
---
It looks the same as all the other ones.
---
r/woooosh
---
Luckily dedicated servers are coming in 2-3 months.
---
Hmm, I feel the exact opposite. Whenever I get a really good survivor I'd actually try to have them escape, rarely you see very good survivors nowadays.
---
Enjoy deranking because you don't understand the game., mate.
---
Either way, such kinds of posts are becoming really annoying and repetitive, most of them happen at low ranks anyway where most of the survivors are bad and can't even bm without making mistakes. At least post something from a tournament where a mistake like this would cost the team a high amount of money.
---
I use her at red ranks, just run Than and force the clense.
---
I think it's called a lag switch
---
I'm a simple man, I see cat, I upvote.
---
I kept thinking of Roadhog.
---
I love how you get downvoted for this.
---
Honestly and not joking. I dont DC everytime I play against a Nurse, if that happens and she is good I just farm my teammates so I can easily black pip, and so that horrendous match can end.
---
username checks out
---
Xbox: Insanely long amount of time to even get into a killer lobby. Been like this for a while now....
---
Also great to know you are one of those that insult people who did nothing to them, that's so DbD.
---
Unfortunately....
---
Enjoy disconnecting on killers when the game gets too hard for you.
---
I figured it out a few days ago but only managed to post it yesterday :)
---
Literally ever single person I've seen suggest a different mori for trapper, wants him to crush the survivor's head in a bear trap. 
---
You're not special
---
you can't play as killer anymore now...
---
Chucky is an idea i'd like to see in the game, but it's almost certainly not gonna happen. He's too small and with fog he'd be impossible to play against
---
i actually was really surprised when my noed didnt activate that one match
---
"Looks like a child"
---
In what fucking world?
---
They meant a counter, literally
---
I don't see anything special goin on here...
---
Eh, No Mither can have a pretty decent job in the sense that it prevents you from acting stupid.
---
It's also pretty handy if you run it with Iron Will, ultimate ninja
---
Ruin =/= NOED
---
To be honest i stopped picking up the first downed survivor cause they usually dc lmao
---
Good for you
---
You don't need a perk to detect totems if you know totem spots in the maps, it's pretty easy to memorize them
---
I play at rank \~8 survivor usually, and it's insane how many rank 5s and below I see who are like this. So many people would rather spend three minutes urban evasioning to the corner of the map and using self-care, instead of getting fully healed in 8 seconds at the hook.
---
Dude, this is amazing!!! Great job man!
---
Now chase people around your neighbourhood with this knife
---
Vomit mommy wear crown
---
once you gauge the range of your blink the counterplay survivors have to you is basically "disconnect" or "hope you miss". nurse sorta plays fundamentally different as you won't be doing any chasing since your blink does that for you so she's not really good to start playing killer with, but don't take that as "she's bad" at ALL.
---
Toxic jake doing gen right by the hooked person
---
I'mma report his ass
---
What system are you on? 
---
Matchmaking is fine for me now on PS4.
---
THE PLAGGGGG DUUUDEEEE
---
I wonder why.
---
I'll clarify, it does the action speed boosts like resilience except when you're the last person instead of injured.  So it can speed up cleansing, exit gates, looting, and vaulting. Still kinda garbage but it's usable now.
---
I personally think Ghostface is better
---
You can't say that iam wrong
---
i returned after a long pause and the most questionable change to me is that the hatch hopens on 0 done generators?
---
NOTE TO DEVELOPERS:
---
It seems that any actions done right at the same time the endgame collapse kills the survivor will break the game in some way. 
---
On this occasion, I mori'd the last survivor at the same time the timer had run out. The audio cue of the endgame collapse kill appears, but the Mori was successfully activated (rather than the Entity kill). 
---
On another game, I was the Wraith and picked the last survivor up from the ground (while they're crawling to the exit) at the same time the timer run out. It automatically dropped the survivor, as it should, but didn't activate the Entity kill. The survivor died on the spot. The Endgame Collapse then disappeared leaving me locked into the map until I had to quit out of the game.
---
The last video I watched from his plague was just bad survivors.
---
The ones from before. He has like 3 recently
---
I have a question.
---
Why don't cosplayers use a real knife instead of a fake one?
---
This Wraith is NOT ok
---
Myers with a well timed EW3 can snowball a game much easier than GF. Only thing he really has over him is a lower profile and ability to turn off his RS.
---
Adiris and Myers deserve to at least be in the semi-thicc catagory
---
That‚Äôs what I mean he posted one today.
---
I saw the one from today. He has posted a few these past 3 days. Check those out. I think he might've gone against potato in one of them
---
Felt cute, might put on iridescent king with a mori later, idk
---
When did i say anything about survivors being op? Which besides coordinated SWF Groups, i do not think survivors are op
---
True Infinites do not exist anymore.
---
Insta-hatchets have been nerfed, they did not always reduce the amount you can carry by 4, only by 2 meaning you could carry 5 with an Infantry Belt. (Patch 1.7.2 if you want to check yourself)
---
Back to the Prayer Beads. Until I actually play against it myself i will  refrain from calling it op. And even if i would personally deem it an op addon, i'm not gonna judge if people want to use it.
---
of course its a fucking leatherface
---
I did find this post from devianart‚Äî&gt; https://www.deviantart.com/notrightinthehead74/art/Michael-Myers-Scooby-Doo-769309068
---
As a survivor, you should just stay at the hook because I‚Äôll promise you, as long as the killer isn‚Äôt in the immediate area, they‚Äôre actually losing pressure unless you two are the last survivors up. It‚Äôs more beneficial for a killer to pressure other generators because half the team isn‚Äôt on one. Also if you‚Äôre that concerned, bring Breakdown and see where the killer is. 
---
As a killer, best advice: stay by the hook and heal. If I‚Äôm far away, I won‚Äôt even bother doubling back, or if I am coming back I‚Äôm actually not going to the actually hook, I‚Äôm predicting where you two ran off. Bee lining the hook to find no one there will give people enough time to hide.
---
you can‚Äôt get worse than that
---
Not to dick ride him, though I gladly would, he‚Äôs good with every killer at red ranks, I‚Äôll have to keep trying her, I don‚Äôt have Thana on her yet.
---
You forgot Clown has a collection of hats, including the best one: smoll hat  [https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight\_gamepedia\_en/4/48/GK\_Head006.png?version=2a01719ca69b5d84a79de2d5d216ab55](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/deadbydaylight_gamepedia_en/4/48/GK_Head006.png?version=2a01719ca69b5d84a79de2d5d216ab55)
---
PC, and in case you were wondering I have a good internet connection too.
---
No like Im explaining how that was "toxic". Sorry it was super late and I didnt explain it well. If theres an easy down, chasing someone else instead, ignoring the easier down, is considered tunneling
---
I had a survivor fail a Skillcheck and instantly DC. FeelsBadMan.
---
For some people it‚Äôs because fake weapons are easier to do, you don‚Äôt have to worry about the blade or if you want to cosplay at a convention you are not allowed to bring real weapons.
---
So no hat? I‚Äôm boutta head out
---
Wait is this supposed to be judging lore, power or cosmetic?
---
that is incredibly unlucky then
---
Stay hidden in them shadows and run some Mist offerings.
---
You‚Äôve gotta give Legion some recognition, he‚Äôs the only one that looks like a stereotypical murderer.
---
How dare you Anna is big russian THICC
---
if you see a cop arresting a man who stole a purse, and the purse is just sitting on the side of the road and you snatch it, you are still committing theft. If a bug makes itself available and you choose to abuse it, thats still breaking the rules of the game, the opportunity just presented itself to you to do it easily
---
I farmed the recent double BP as Nurse before queues got fucked :) 
---
I play normally  'til i 2 hook everyone, no camping or tunneling to maximize BP gains ^(and because both tactics are boring af and not viable at high ranks anyways) and then just farm with em and max whatever category i'm lacking in.
---
I don't.
---
Here's the reason Ruin is essential at red ranks:
---
At the start of a match, there's nothing to stop Survivors from working on generators. As such, they can easily get 2 generators repaired by the time you get the first down (unless you get a lucky 1-shot).
---
At this point, the Survivors have so much momentum that it can be hard to recover before all the gens are done. Especially against organised Survivors.
---
Ruin, even when cleansed early, slows this early game momentum. As such, you'll likely only lose one generator for you first hook.
---
I thought all memes went under the Shitpost flair, no?
---
I'm not talking about the flair
---
Ah, I see
---
This
---
I‚Äôve gotten ‚Äúteleport then hit someone with the hag‚Äù 3 fucking days in a row. Played one game and killed every survivor without them setting off a single trap.
---
why does anyone want to cheat to win? whats the fun about that? Dude he's prob some nerd that lives inside his moms house while he's 34 years old.
---
I cant tell if OP's kid did it, or if Op did it and is embarrassed to say it
---
If you don't go back to the hook: one survivor injured, one surivovr healing him, one survivor being chased, **one  survivor doing gen**.
---
If you go back to the hook and chase the rescuer: one survivor being chased, one survivor looking for healing (or possibly doing gen), **two survivors doing gens**.
---
If you go back to the hook and tunnel the unhooked person: one survivor being chased, **three survivors doing gens**.
---
Welp atleast the proxy sounds gone.
---
Ace in the Hole and Plunderer‚Äôs Instinct is the best load out. Nothing comes close
---
Where is spirit???
---
Like said, rank 4 was probably playing this one of this fellas. It happens to me (1) when I play with my brother (18).
---
Yea fair enough a very valid point, however I feel their needs to be a more features around the characters, so maybe a new system when you prestige
---
Sure but it's a very obvious meme.
---
And that's fine as long as the words "gen rush" don't come out of your mouth. Where are the other two survivors? Working on a generator completely uncontested due to lack of gen pressure. Why bad gen pressure? You keep going back to the hook to chase the same two survivors. One of those survivors fully knowing where they have been so they know where pallets should be to loop that much longer.
---
So effective? Questionable. Against low rank survivors sure but not against good ones.
---
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs drive thru..
---
Some made a very cool mori version for the Trapper here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8sfiie/im\_a\_trapper\_main\_so\_i\_decided\_to\_make\_the\_mori/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/8sfiie/im_a_trapper_main_so_i_decided_to_make_the_mori/)
---
Well this is sort of a moot point as GF keeps his stalk meter but survivors don't. If they are 'abusing' cover to reveal you then move towards them with your own cover. Besides, he is supposed to stalk secretly not in front of them.
---
Warrior sleep. You've earned your well deserved rest
---
/s
---
I didn't mean stalking during the chase.
---
Last game i actually crouched on the edge of map, as stealthly as i can, looking for them survivors.
---
And one of them revealed me from behind the cover. I tried to stalk in order to see the white outline of this surv. But i couldn't, cuz' there was NO direct line of sight between us(((
---
Shitpost no goldenpost yes
---
Could you please be more specific about the perks, I‚Äôd like to know what you disagree with. I also understand your thoughts about including a knock off version, I just thought it would be more interesting to include the real deal
---
Oh that sucks. The one I get the most on console is the nurse and I just ignore it unless it's a Mori.

I've got a nice trapper daily now though. Catch 4 people in beartraps. I love playing as trapper so it's all good.

I don't like doing this, but I have to inform you, that what you are doing is violating the creative commons license under which Gamepedia operates, since you take several text strings from the Dead by Daylight Wiki without acknowledging it as your source. Either add the proper credits or remove the information you plagiarised.
---
*gets downvoted* 
---
Even tho its basically the story behind the video
---
There‚Äôs just a lot of suggestiveness to her character and none of its really prove-able, so it‚Äôs not really worth arguing over. It could just be a triangle because it‚Äôs quick and easy and because the Devs like to make up mythical/foreign stuff instead of trying to reference actual things (which is smarter to do) so a triangle is pretty offenseless. 
---
She could be from America and from Louisiana because her name is Lisa Sherwood, her map is swamp based, and she practices voodoo which is historically significant there. 
---
She could be from West Africa where voodoo is popular, and packed with dense Forrests and villages (as per her lore) 
---
She could be from New York
---
All fancannons are equal and valid
---
Yeah but these red ranks are garbage most of the time
---
Because his games just become a mending simulator since he is able to get first hits on multiple survivors really easily but can only commit to one chase meaning other survivors have to mend and heal (if they don‚Äôt want to be one hit the whole game). It‚Äôs just unfun to hold down one button for however long because the killer decided to chase you for 2 seconds and go after someone else instead. I don‚Äôt think the legion rework really did anything to fix how unfun he was to play against in my opinion. That being said, playing as him is decent. His gen pressure makes him very viable in high ranks

Maybe just lack of better options, as noed is a general perk. And in lower ranks people are way to careless and altruistic, so noed can turn a shitty game in a win.

2. Puking with Corrupt Purge sometimes crashes the game. Reproduced several times happenes most often when used near an open exit gate
---
3. Healing, Mending and Wake up prompts were not showing up, leaving us unable to heal for the entire game. Happens regularly 
---
4. Game audio volume would fluctuate between very loud and barely audible in between games
---
5. Some female survivors (Meg and Feng) occasionally made male struggle sounds whole being carried. Happened several times
---
6. After playing for a few hours the framerate would noticibly drop in all aspects of the game including the bloodweb and store. Reseting the game solved the issue. Happened 3 times
---
7. Maybe not a bug, but noticing a huge influx of incredibly laggy players, even when the ping is green in the lobby (im rank 6 so its likely not new gamepass players)
---
8. Springwood, Ormond, Temple, and all Coldwind maps had flickering ground textures at points.
---
9. Fast vaulting over certain pallets on autohaven would place you back on the side you came from. Mostly seemed to be pallats away from jungle gyms and t-walls, morseo the ones between rocks.
---
10. Fireworks are broken. Ive been blinding when they were thrown behind me, not blinded when they are in front of me, had nothing happen at all, had them say they blind when they didnt, and had them blind from super far away.
---
(Sorry if i did this wrong its my first time posting bugs here)
---
I don't really like them either, I just like puns.
---
I use both your "also choices" + bbq + enduring since most of my games I lose the ruin in 10 secs
---
is ruined.
---
just reroll them
---
True
---
Your right
---
No point in arguing with the same person prrtending to be 2 different people
---
Bad luck to yout "community"
---
I do not want a doll in the game. Sorry, but the community does not need this.
---
It doesn't eliminate his anti-stealth, though. I feel killers need more offensive tools to deal with chases rather than tools to deal with finding survivors.
---
Besides, finding survivors isn't the issue as much as catching them is.
---
I do obviously. Just saying I‚Äôll get that one again tomorrow more than likely.
---
Apparently, you can only get them from Saw Con
---
It‚Äôs their souls. It‚Äôs believed in the occult that souls contain very strong emotions when they die. So when the survivor dies on hook the entity absorbs all their emotions and spits it back out.
---
TLDR; the survivors soul is full of emotions and basically functions like the can of cola your mom keeps taking sips from and then puts back in the fridge.
---
I know why do people want him??
---
Overused meme
---
Solid 3-5 min
---
Kindred is by far my favorite solo perk, even more than Self-Care. It lets teammates know who is the closest to the hook and can guilt-trip them into saving when they otherwise wouldn‚Äôt, and also lets the far away teammates on a gen know that they can continue as normal.
---
You know you can actually put effort in memes tight?
---
Momma huntress, pls crush me
---
I mean that's true and all...
---
But why up ?
---
These balls
---
Nah there‚Äôs nothing wrong with spirit. Nurse on the other hand, that‚Äôs not a fun time.
---
This sure was never posted before
---
You know good memes are original ones right?

Nope haha. Try again.

is it like bill's stance?
---
It was sarcasm.

Just got jump Force and it do be like that
---
It was sarcasm. She walked right passed me.
---
depends on the distance to killer whether its better to keep running or start looping
---
"You see how fun it is when the killer is trying to kill you!"
---
Um... Yeah.
---
Clown has a hat in one of his costumes.
---
and he also played david, the baldest character you know, that straves for troubles
---
Y‚Äôall are the reason why this game will die. Weh weh weh nerf the killer even more weh weh weh. Stfu and play the game. Killers legit get bullied by survivors and you want to make them stronger? It‚Äôs a fucking killer game and y‚Äôall think the survivors should be stronger?
---
Because it‚Äôs the entities dimension, it‚Äôs in control. The entity is Essentially an old god and the books are it‚Äôs alter, that‚Äôs why you sacrifice a survivor rather than just straight up kill them.
---
Even with a EM or any morri, the killer is giving you permission to kill the survivors rather than sacrifice them. This is shown in only one killer. Mr Myers gets fuck all BP and actually De-ranks with tuft and tomb stone.
---
As a PC player, there are three killer dailies that I will always reroll: trapper, hag, and pig. The dailies I look forward to are nurse and billy.
---
Rank 16 and sometimes it's 2-3 and other times it's like 10 mins yesterday I waited for like 15 mins no joke.
---
I don't get it.
---
At least we got firecrackers again
---
Perosnally, I have a much more difficult time with Myers than Ghostface.
---
Points is one thing. Im talking about kills. 
---
If they are running and just dc then whatever but if they are in the dying state, or especially hooked it should just count as a death. 
---
This post was made in frustration while I was playing as a killer I'm not fully comfortable with. I was already working for those points just to get the ritual and in every game the ones that died on a hook disconnected while there character was being offered to the entity after their time ran out on the hook. The game needs to count the kill as soon as that time runs out, not after the hook breaks.
---
Because of this I needed to play additional rounds as this same killer just to "complete (x) sacrifices on a hook". Their team mates didn't come for them so in bitter rage they quit the match. 
---
I got points but the ritual showed no progress so I had to go back in with that killer again.
---
And not only brains, too!
---
I like a challenge. Also you dont know if they are a good nurse and even if they are thats still no excuse.
---
The swamps seem tiny these days since they shrunk them both.
---
They don‚Äôt posted comments on my profile so I kind of respect them
---
Oh okay I see your point. In that case I agree.
---
A good idea but would be another stalker killer.
---
In my games usually other people bring escape cakes or other personal blood point boosters

---
Finally, some culture.
---
Yes! But it shears off an immense amount of time, since there are so many totem spots on different maps. You can spend 2 and a half minutes looking for Ruin with Small Game instead of 10 going by "memory". Case and point: Lery's, Swamp maps.
---
Im 90% sure youre suppose to blur ourr the names.
---
*Did I really?*
---
This was literally perfect killer gameplay. 
---
It was the survivors who failed.
---
Just like you.
---
For that perk set, yup! I even switch out BBQ for Nurse's Calling at times because that combos w/ sloppy butcher really well. However I've seen Enduring, Spirit Fury, Save the Best for Last, Hex: Ruin build. And I've seen Legion w/ BBQ, Nurses Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Hex: Ruin. It really depends!
---
actually the person above me posted after me.  and didn‚Äôt you also ruin it by not saying the final line of the song.
---
We don't know how much like pepperoni those killers look, but we know Plague is at least 50%. Since Freddy is 100% Pepperoni and the closet value we know is 50% which IMO would mean that Plague is the second most pepperoni killer.
---
so it should be influenced by my playstyle more than other characters are? that helps a lot, thank you!
---
who is this guy
---
Absolutely! How you play the game is how you should run your perks :) Just keep in mind some perks are more viable than others
---
For real they need to flip the sides on the meme and then it would work but as is it doesn‚Äôt make any sense. This is like some Japanese hentai book or some shit where you read right to left.
---
Alright, will do! much appreciated!
---
Vommy Mommy uwu
---
I stopped using the perk because of this, but also because the killer ALWAYS comes right back no matter how long I left the survivor on the hook.
---
In my final match of the night I did earn iridesense on all 4 categories despite 1 disconnect, again, after their time in the struggle state ran out so they disconnected from the match. I earned a quitter bonus but the game didn't count it as a death, something i had to deal with in 4 previous matches as it doesnt count the death until the hook breaks apart. 
---
I already had enough kills on the hook for the ritual before that. It was also the best I have ever played with that killer since I bought him and I did earn the Adept achievement (with level 1 perks too) so that was a great final match. 
---
The dc did not affect the scoring at the end of the match and I still earned all my points and the achievement. 
---
The kill needs to count as soon as that bar drains from struggle
---
Etiquette guide: If you were winning  the game you are not the one to decide if it was GG

A game is only GG if it was enjoyable to those who lost it as well.

Kid for sure lol

You CAN however get mad when you run through the gates but can't escape. That shit is annoying as fuck
---
Honestly reminds me of the Very High ELO days of LoL having to wait 30-1 hour just to get into champ select

It also works for Legion because if they‚Äôre in the terror radius, you can see them while frenzied.

Nokia 6610

can't relate, i'm a cunt from ps4

It's not their choice to choose what level killer they go against. It's the match making that does that. Cant blame survivors for wanting to play with their friends.

And that's why the "just cleanse totems" counter is stupid. Unless you personally cleanse all five totems, or find the reminisce of any you haven't personally cleansed, it's just luck.
---
The event is pretty damn generous if you count all the bloodpoints you get from these cakes, although i really fucking hate BHVR for being lazy fuckers not adding map\\surv in 3.0 and not adding ANY actual even to the game too, i just feel like 3.0 should have been either this teased so-called battle pass or something else as huge, but no , its just a regular superlazy chapter. And freddy is still sleeping too, so i would say you are right, FEELSFUCKINGBAD aka I tHiNk We DiD a PrEtTy GoOd JoB sO fAr
---
Hell yeah! I like the muscle definition
---
I mean just because the game is about a killer doesn‚Äôt mean killer should be broken however I agree with you. I think survivors in mid tier and red ranks just make the game impossible for killer unless you use certain add-ons the game revolves around teamwork with randoms without any form of communication other than hand signals so when you throw in premade teams with discord where loads of information are being shared that usually aren‚Äôt in a game the game becomes very very survivor favored.
---
I'd love a Killer from the future! I hope we get to see one this year.
---
Do gruesome gateaus still spawn in bloodwebs?
---
they are shit man, why do you vouch for them at all
---
The game keeps giving me killer dailies when I don't want to put myself through it's awful queue time
---
You think survivors bullying the killer is bad now? Did you play in the first year of the games release? Playing killers is braindead easy and there is no excuse not to win 90 percent of your matches.
---
I mean, you either run little game or know totem spawns, NOeD can be easily countered. Now imagine a scenario where all the gates a re open, a survivor gets hooked near the exit gates, his teammates unhook him, he gets hit but they have BT, you hit him once more but the is now right in front of the exit gates and the endgame collapse just started, you eithe pick him up and get hit by DS or let him crawl away, no in-between. That's how great swf rule the game. Go check one of Tru3's videos, that's exactly what happens in the match, he only gets one guy killed, a teabag at the exits and a black pip.
---
It's a cool event but nobody fucking burns them cuz they don't expire (which seems highly dubious, BHVR is rarely that nice)
---
What exactly am I looking at
---
He wouldn‚Äôt carry survivors, he would pull them from their hair. And he wouldn‚Äôt hook them, he would throw them up

---
wait, those offerings will remain?
---
Seeing lots of people saying this is cheating. I‚Äôm pretty sure you just loaded into the match slower and he assumed you were AFK. For me, this used to happen every single session - survivor or killer. [This old vid is a good example.](https://youtu.be/Tae9UA3AuE8) I was fortunate this Billy took pity on me and hesitated.
---
You mean those map decorations?
---
Give him a fucking chance Heather.
---
I just wanna know how long you playedüòÇ you wouldn‚Äôt be complaining so much about those mean old survivors xD, if you had played back when it first came out. FYI I do play Killer. More than survivor because of how easy it is. As a result I‚Äôm a rank 2 Pig/Nurse main.
---
What new item? 
---
Its the same with a slightly different icon
---
They were NOT in a SWF. All solo.
---
And before someone accuses me of bragging, I have to point out that I in fact depipped in that match. They looped and genrushed me hard and I only got 1 or 2 hooks before the gens were done. The only reason I got them is because I proxy camped hooks after they opened the gates and exploited their extreme cockiness (obsession literally ran at me after unhook to get downed because he wanted to use his DS on me) and altruistic greed. So basically I played absolutely dreadfully, it's just that they were really stupid even if way above my skill level.
---
Myers because he can't be knocked out of his power and he can stalk multiple survivors
---
Glad to hear it. I kind of sounded like a whiny bitch probably, and they are still WAY better then f13\\ lastyear gamedevs, but they have a space to grow thats for sure. I perfectly understand that its all about money for them, so they want to make them in a least effortless way, but players suffer by this approach.
---
At least we get it back? The point is we get new stuff. It‚Äôs better than nothing for the 3 year anniversary
---
why is EVERY survivor so toxic? I am rank 1 killer and survivor and can say that 90% of survivors are fucking assholes whose intent is to try to ruin another persons game. Killers...maybe 50%
---
2 killers
---
oh snap, thats really helpful. thank you.
---
Wanna contact BHVR for it?
---
the point is its not new. its the same thing we get for every event.
---
The Offering is nice, but thats all
---
There comes a certain point where if you don't play a killer, than you will never play that killer. I neglected playing the Huntress and Wraith for so long that if I wanted to play them I'd have to play a killer that I'm not good at, with no decent perks, one perk slot, no add-ons, no offerings, against high level survivors.
---
Oh God I thought you were joking!
---
I honestly am not sure, on here I read they "will remain, but will not appear in more bloodweb" so... Yes? And with no one burning them I feel confirms that. I hope I'm wrong I'd laugh to see everyone sitting on 30 useless cakes cuz they were greedy
---
Well the matchmaking needs to be fixed but otherwise what else can they do? If they limit or remove swf a lot of people will quit playing, myself included as I only really like playing survivor with friends, cause fandoms are idiots lol
---
:\^) &lt;3
---
Survivors not having a way of knowing totems left is a balance. Hex perks are useless after totems are gone. So it is a balance. Its meant to extend the game longer. If you are really a killer main, you will understand why it is fair.
---
If you‚Äôre on console, she‚Äôs much worse than on PC
---
Huge terror radius always is the most difficult for me to play against. But what matters most really I think is how well you bbn use your socks. What would I know tho I'm just a bing bong boi main.
---
What‚Äôs NOED
---
*im fucking serious I don‚Äôt know what that is*
---
add a couch and you would have the greatest meme.
---
There is no problem. The only problem is the match making and your lack of experience. 
---
Quit putting such a huge amount of importance in rank. Rank doesn't mean shit in this game. With the way you people on Reddit complain about it you wouldn't be able to tell that it doesn't mean anything but it really doesn't mean a damn thing. You can de-rank on purpose, you can boost, you can completely ignore playing one side of the spectrum for 3 to 4 months and have a fully maxed out killer at rank 20. You can do the same for survivor. You can stay at 1 particular rank for as long as you want if you want to, until rank reset on the 13th of every month. Rank doesn't mean a single fucking thing.
---
lol
---
There are a lot more than two builds for the Doctor. Since you don't have to rely on tracking perks, him being the only killer who's ability is reliant on his terror radius, and being the best killer for perks like Unnerving Presence and Coulrophobia he has more build options than any other killer.
---
‚ÄúTunnel man, you hard‚Äù
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve quite slept off my booze from last night.
---
I had a game where the killer had to be cheating, they were teleporting so much. She kept just like blinking in and out of existence, then be right on you and whacked you. At least the entity had mercy though and gave her an asthma attack after every hit
---
You and the low effort meme did lmao
---
But the Doctors ability already does that. It's like running Spirit Fury on the Nurse. If his ability already tells you the survivor's location, why would you need a perk that tells you the survivor's location? It's just redundant.
---
Cough,Legion,cough...
---
Well Done. A spectacular display of power.
---
I want this so bad!
---
What? You still do
---
Its an extra hint of where they are. The survivors arent screaming constantly
---
Or when your gen is just about finished and you hear a heartbeat. .
---
Risk it for a biscui- now I'm dead.
---
Hang on... I'm sorry... what's a pallet? Hmm? Also, can you go through stuff? Because I can.
---
And let me guess, you probably de-pipped?
---
Leatherface screaming inaudibily:  
---
Morgan Freeman: Bubba always knew he was better than the rest of his kin'd admit, and now he'd prove it. "I'm about to perform what's referred to as a pro gamer move" I remember him saying
---
I remember that for a month after Clown came out, almost everyone was saying Clown was mid-high tier killer that could end chases really quick. Basically on the same level as present-day Hag. Glad to see people have realized he's not that good of a killer
---
It‚Äôs KYF
---
I read it like that too at first
---
Try playing as leather face and chainsawing survivors. They DC the moment that blade so much as grazes them.
---
Sometimes the survivor is just toxic, and moves slower to taunt you.
---
Ohh I am *SOOO* sorry the devs dared to ask you to experience the map! How dare they??
---
Yeah, fuck the game map for that
---
This would definitely be an interesting addition to DBD
---
I usually assume theres a line drawn between face camping and just camping. Either one usually gives enough time for at least 1 gen should be getting done or else all 3 of the other Claudettes are going for loot boxes. If not they are swarming/sneaky swarming.
---
Thats usually my line of reasoning.
---
They scream often enough that you shouldn't lose track of them if you have eyes.
---
Against good survivors, even with being injured all game, the plague should only be able to kill one survivor, if that, if the survivors don't cleanse themselves. Her chamces drop a lot lower if the survivors are a swf group too but that applies to a lot of killers.
---
Use Sloppy Butcher with Bloodhound and you will never lose anyone again.
---
I know this, but its part of the build. If youre gonna not let them hide, every perk has to be part of it
---
Bond can replace Self-Care tho
---
You know that you can lag switching in the game? Which he basically did.
---
r/dontdeadopeninside
---
Yeah still bannable
---
You
---
I made this under 2 min it might be possible
---
Get Quentin because Quentin mains have large pp
---
What makes you so sure that it wasnt a genuine lag?
---
Red ranks would probably only ban nurse, that's currently the only killer that can't be countered, it's quite unfair. But what if the game tried to find a game matching your preferences, and then if it doesn't suceed, you go to a regular game? That would be more balanced
---
I was thinking of combining that too, Dark Sense is already a pretty good perk especially after you conplete the last gen and the killer possibly has NOED.
---
yeesss
---
For me it‚Äôs usually Claudette
---
I have tought about small killers as well (Gremlins for DBD)
---
So my ideas for a small killer would be:
---
1.- Some kind of periscope (with gremlins it could be an actual periscope) so you can rise it and see from even higher than normal killers would, hell, it could give them 3rd person view with the downfall of being more visible and be able to switch to normal POV to be harder to see.
---
2.- For picking up, they don't need to pick them up. they could drag survivors from the neck, either in a headlock (gremlins arms, can actually round a person's neck) or by the neck with one hand.
---
for hooking: CHucky can use magic like the nurse, others could climb the hook.
---
For breaking pallet: well, its simple: just hit them, they can do that.
---
Other option would be to jump on them or jump and karate chop them.
---
were
---
That‚Äôs fair
---
Hi Carl!!!
---
Welp, legends say that Dwight is still missing until now.
---
Because of length of how long that lag was.
---
It was like 3-5s lag because he destroyed pallet &amp; stabbed him.
---
If his ping was that high I think that you would already notice that while he was running in Killer Shack but you didn't see any rollbacks not even single thing that you could say that he is just lagging
---
Downvoted for truth, JUST LET ME DREAM....
---
A survivor shouldn't have to look behind every stupid fucking crate on the map to counter a perk the killer might not even be using.
---
How so
---
Riperoni
---
More immersed than toxic
---
Okay but he specifically asked for the "best" build, not the "most fun" or "best gimmick build".
---
But the extra *3%*!!!
---
Lots of blown Generators. Pop Pop is the sound made when that happens.
---
It is the best. They literally cant even hide for a few seconds. Try the build, and tell me it isnt amazing
---
Actually that you said is pretty much a good reason of why he could be in.
---
For killer mains or people who play killer regularly one of the things we would dread about small killers is finding survivors. In places like the cornfields or the swamp maps, small killers suffer a lot, let alone crouching with killers like the pig. so it kinda makes it balanced if survivors would actually have a hard time locating the killer that also has troubles finding them.
---
&gt; Nobody DCs because it of being Spirit.
---
Literally everyone at high ranks dreads playing against a Spirit. They're like the "soft nurse" pick, since you don't actually have to be good at chases to down people.
---
No need to pick up, they can just drag them from the neck.
---
For hooking CHucky can easily pull a nurse and use magic to hook them.
---
These are nice changes I think. It'd make having M&amp;A (which is his own teachable) not a bad idea. Plus his base shock attack range is so short that usually I'm better off just hitting them instead
---
It takes a year to find a lobby as killer
---
On the bright side, if a Doctor wastes time trying to put you into madness 3, it makes the chase last 2x longer and usually gives you enough info to extract what kind of mindgames work against the killer you're up against.
---
Just so you know, I do not care enough to even read that.
---
Regardless of what you said, I'll reiterate what I said - I played perfectly, the survivors fucked up.
---
I wish I had an excuse but I was just too lazy to make enough space for the word to fit between them lol
---
Aw shit here we go again *unzips*
---
You must be new; welcome to the club.
---
The entire point of the Doctor is that they can't hide. That's all the Doctor does. Again it's like running Enduring Spirit Fury on the Nurse because then she doesn't just counter pallets, now she super counters pallets!
---
It would be a 75% break speed???
---
Yep
---
As a survivor, i can hide from the doctor, you literally need to be outside of his terror radius
---
Not if they dont dc from being picked up, they dont always dc immediately after being downed
---
What‚Äôs wrong with all of you? Stake out completely ruins games. Your ruin is completely useless at that point! It should be removed from the game.
---
/s^
---
They can't even figure out how to do an event without it being fucked every single time, how do you think they could pull off this?
---
Yeah You are right Devs should be very clear to Survs about Killer Perks and reveal them during loading screen. Simple! Right?
---
I don‚Äôt make the system.
---
New to me :)
---
So basically, infected.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of try hards as you start climbing the ranks on ps4
---
I can already imagine what the post game chat will be

Yeah she was not happy ü§£
---
Yeah, I'm not saying its hard, it's just so boring. At least for me.
---
A new gamemode is bound to happen someday, just keep hope.
---
*joke*
---
*ur head*
---
my everything
---
This sounds extremely cool, but being Behaviour, this isn probably never going to happen
---
why
---
Oh sorry, my bad. I thought it worked on a token system where you spend one token to break a pallet 15% faster. In that case it's worthless. You are never going even close to five stacks before having to break a pallet and even then it only lasts for that pallet. Enduring Spirit Fury does the same thing but better.
---
They are still going to be switching target to the rescuer each time though.
---
Yay!
---
I think it's supposed to be similar to the drake meme.
---
The Nun from the conjuring universe üôè
---
Adiris is not thicc, she is SICC. Bitch nasty af boiiiii
---
You sly dog
---
Spies from the Shadows only works up to 36 meters, just barely outside of his default terror radius, and inside his terror radius with Distressing.
---
Everytime it happens, I hit the damn invert controls button on my controller. (Touchpad on ps4)
---
From what I seen ppl talk about yes.
---
No point just hope dedicated servers come sooner
---
Appreciate the support though!
---
I do
---
I'm rank 16 and it takes 2-3 then other times 5-10 mins
---
Damn, thanks
---
Very based and redpilled
---
That‚Äôs not true at all. If you‚Äôre running calm spirit you can sneak around since you stay calm in madness
---
I just see a normal dbd map ?
---
Oh hey it's Blood Lodge
---
I'm having issues finding a killer lobby right now. upwards of 5 minute queues
---
It's already been pointed out plenty but I'm gonna add to it... OFCOURSE it's a leatherface! O don't understand why it's so often leatherface.
---
Yeah, i never see them anymore. Even at purple ranks i barely see leatherfaces. Good meme!
---
Shoulda jumped out immediatly, the fool
---
please don't go
---
Same
---
Switch to a different killer.
---
They ruined Legion a while back.
---
Are you just dumb or something? The problem isn't knowing if they have NOED or not that, just part of it. Even if they made it so that using NOED will cause the killer to constantly scream "I HAVE NOED, I HAVE NOED, I HAVE NOED" globally the survivor would *still* have to run around looking for every fucking totem.
---
&gt; I played perfectly, the survivors fucked up.
---
No, you camped the hook and fucked yourself. Just because the survivors fucked up doesn't mean you didn't fuck up too.
---
New map confirmed
---
I thought this was fixed
---
that‚Äôs not the point of the post. my entire plan was maining Trapper until I got the Legion. I‚Äôm completely fine with learning tougher characters, because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs fun in games. believe me, it‚Äôd certainly be easier maining someone like the Hillbilly, but there‚Äôs also no fun in playing a character that doesn‚Äôt even have a learning curve
---
The point is to slow the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT
---
That's a kill shot!
---
THAT'S A KILL SHOT!
---
I got lag switched one game against ghostface. I was SWF and got 3 gens done right off the bat no issues or anything then next thing you know it‚Äôs lagging so bad that I‚Äôm randomly going down and on the hook without seeing the killer till I was on the hook üòÇ  it was fucking ridiculous
---
Rank 13 here, it's not.
---
You can easily get 25 grabs by farming. Huntress trophy is bugged on PS4 i think.
---
wait what
---
Direspectful survivors take them off :(
---
Pepperoni pizza face is the new meta.
---
Damn it, Mclovin!
---
sadly no
---
I always see him being recommended and I wonder, have you actually considered how ridiculous and stupid playing against chucky would be? I mean even as a horror icon he's fucking dumb, any survivor could punt him outof bounds in the entity's realm. 
---
He works in the movies because he's a trickster. Not a stalker like Myers or Ghostface. A 2 foot killer would be hilarious, stupid, and out of place. In real life and the game.
---
The thing is it doesn‚Äôt feel satisfying to get it by farming and I doubt the devs intended for killers to farm lmao.
---
Best thing to do (only if you know for a fact you won that game) is to just hit em with a "ez game uwu" Not sure why. But people seem to lose their shit if you put that face in chat.
---
Also if the huntress trophy is bugged then rip my 100% I guess.
---
me: struggling on a hook. 
---
random survivor: cleanses dull totem.
---
They're still REALLY loud.
---
Be thankful he did something lmao. He could have done fucking nothing. Maybe that's all he had and wanted to contribute.
---
IN THE LOCKER
---
Holy crap the best luck I‚Äôve ever seen in this game, and I‚Äôve seen crazy shit
---
Doc is unfortunately pretty bad at the moment, his shock doesn‚Äôt come out fast enough and at a good enough range to prevent looping and half the time doesn‚Äôt even prevent window vaults.  It also has this weird annoying delay after charging it that makes it even less consistent to hit people with.  His madness takes too little time to break out of to make it worth the time to get people in it by walking around and shocking them.  I love my doctor on the game though, his terror radius covers the whole map when using calm and distressing.
---
Yes, until the 2nd
---
No lmao
---
Are you holding a camera to the monitor? Looks like this is staged tbh
---
Thank you for the contagious laughter. I‚Äôm not sure why but the fact that it‚Äôs a Dwight is just cracking me up.
---
i dont even main jeff
---
Yeah, they won‚Äôt just vanish from your inventory. They just won‚Äôt spawn any more
---
But you‚Äôre at least getting two for one! As a survivor main, I‚Äôm sick of getting all the killer ones then having to switch it out... for another killer one that needs a mori this time..
---
"Hey killer, why you keep trying to kill me?" 
---
"Oh you're right, let me let you live then."
---
As a Freddy player I love it when people don‚Äôt run Self Care, makes things easier.
---
Hell fucking yeah  Republic Commando memes!
---
Hat.
---
Only certified doctor mains get this
---
Hat! :/
---
Yeah that's how people tend to feel about Spirit
---
People who play long enough tend to enjoy the chases/ mindgames, and the way Spirit plays at the moment there are no mindgames at play really

The unhooking one is easy. You will literally unhook 50 times just playing the game normal. You‚Äôll likely unhook at least once a match, maybe even twice
---
*crying ensues*

I'm at the point in this game where I'll pay 20k bp to not farm, that shit is so boring

Just change the animation for DS to where halfway through levitating the survivor, they kick him in the face.

Imagine banning people for memeing around in a game mode that effects no one.
---
HATTTTTTT
---
Hat hat hat
---
If a survivor team plays well and you hold your weight, even if all of them escape, everyone pretty much earn as much as a farm. All while actually playing the game too. You just have to make some effort to not let people go through 2 hook states in one go, or die till end for instance.

Man, I avoid the trapper ones like the plague, everyone I play against notices traps instantly or just never goes near that area
---
Her "hat" covers her whole face, therefore it's a mask. Btw Billy has a hat
---
The player is clearly in the escape area, pretty good job so far
---
I only got 1 farm game in total because 2 people dc'd because of Legion.

It's not worth it, wait times are still pretty long.

Ah okay, thanks

You forgot the best part.

Thats the spirit

Spoiler alert: they all had each other added.

Do you have a link or screenshot of this rule?
---
110% agree
---
I completely don't get it but I approve it
---
Dont disrespect my pizza face list
---
&gt; Am I just missing out on strats or is she the meme-tier character of the game?
---
I wish I could link the recent clip of Zubat using omegablink nurse, but it demonstrated hilariously how stupid broken nurse is. It's like she wasn't designed with DBD in mind.
---
That's not to say everyone can play nurse as well as Zubat, and she is unweildy if you're not good at the game. But on the highest level, vs a perkless nurse, the only meta to combating her is running to the farthest corner of the map so people can do a gen on the other side. With add-ons she's literally unbeatable.
---
25 grabs? just play prayer beads Spirit or scratched mirror Myers
---
50 heals while you injured? run No Mither with Emphaty and Autodidact/Botany Knowledge
---
50 self unhooks? Deliverance is a freakin' curse perk because it's 100% guaranteed you're found first, all i can say is to play very immersed until someone's hooked
---
i can agree that Huntress trophy is kinda hard since not everyone is skilled enough with Huntress
---
the trophy that bothers me most is "from the void she kills" 'cause i tried to get it so many times and failed
---
whatever, you aren't supposed to get trophies with ease since most of them requires time and patience
---
Well...
---
Sprit is S tier and is a really good killer
---
GhostFace is B/C tier, but I'm having a ton of fun playing him.
---
Legion is unfun to play and unfun to play against.
---
Wow the more you know, always hated these things.
---
Im new to DbD what do the totems do?
---
And H A T tier list
---
What joke?
---
*survivor standing behind downed pallet waiting for me to try to break it or go around*
---
*Me repeatedly shocking them and watching their madness level skyrocket*
---
The real mvp
---
‚ÄúBeing stupid‚Äù or trying to save a teammate? Hahaha
---
I‚Äôd recommend thanatophobia+sloppy butcher, hex: ruin, and then one perk to locate survivors (discordance, nurse's calling, or bbq &amp; chili). Decent survivors won‚Äôt have two people on a gen once they see Legion, but it still does happen in games.
---
OR, you see him coming from half a mile away, don‚Äôt get shocked, and move on without a single bullet hole.
---
She is way different than any other killer. With the right perks, addons and control of her abilities you'll be pretty much unstoppable. There's literally no counter play to her so it all depends on you. Pallets and windows doesn't mean a shit because you go straight through them. You need to practise Nurse becausr she's very difficult at first, but she's easily the best killer in the game.
---
It actually is, makes the horror game a bit scary for once.
---
Honestly, that'd definitely help out the game and prevent people from DC'ing right away. 
---
When the killer's offering is secret most survivors *know* that it's probably a mori.
---
UWU
---
so across all of the tips I‚Äôve gotten: I should be running mostly perks to help chain with Frenzy and further slow the game down?
---
They can be used for perks called "Hex"
---
If they're lit up destroying them will disable the hex perk the killer is using. If it's not lit up you can still destroy it but it will only grant blood points.
---
Left Behind is garbage, sure, but Sole Survivor is used to counter BBQ and chilli LMAO xD
---
You have most likely screwed over hundreds of players by dc against nurse. Stop playing victim lmao
---
Welp I cant find it so Im wrong my bad OP.
---
Not realy infected. He just goes crazy. He snaps. No virus or plague, just madness from dieing over and over and over
---
I fresh to playing killer and never realized a perfect game was so sought after. I think I got one with hag when I first started at rank 18.
---
I don't even. You are a blessed soul. We will remember the Freeman. We are coterminous.
---
OMAE WA
---
Micheal stop this isn‚Äôt fair you‚Äôre tearing this family apart, the kids are scared
---
not from a jedi tho
---
And suddenly I wanna go grab some models.
---
Yes. More time survivors have to spend mending and healing the more time you have to find and kill them. Some survivors won‚Äôt heal against Legion, but thanatophobia makes sure they do or get slowed down anyway.
---
My best bet for grabbing is little Pig gen-plucks.
---
Yeah just take the L man. You're not fooling anyone into believing you. NOED is no where near a bullshit perk.
---
alright, that helps a bunch! thank you!
---
Rip your 100% bc they keep adding every expansion. So unless you buy every dlc untill the game ends, good luck.
---
Also don‚Äôt forget Micheal Myers‚Äô ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt quit, please don‚Äôt quit, PLEASE don‚Äôt quit... FUCK!‚Äù achievement, which requires every last survivor to not only be a good sport that doesn‚Äôt quit and doesn‚Äôt hide in a locker just to spoil your game, but also requires them to be very bad at this game so that they don‚Äôt finish the game before you can SLOWLY build your stalk up, and also requires you to know where the hatch is in advance or just pray that it spawns next to you when the second to last person is killed (and now with EGC you‚Äôd have to also pray the exits spawned within LoS of one another otherwise your slowly waddling ass is screwed).
---
Yeah but what does it have with Spirit? Shes not pizza at all
---
I main Legion, and let me tell you, he is hard to learn and even harder to master. Once you get him down pat, its really fun to play. While his ability needs some tweaks in my eyes, hes a solid killer if you play him right
---
Babushka de best
---
It didn't affect anything, I was just confused.
---
No, there was never a Halloween crossover, just an internet fun time. There are more photos that create a simple story but I've never seen this one before.
---
I fucking love doing this with billy
---
I bet that after game chat was super toxic
---
I thought their power was super cool when I heard about it but it seems like it's really ineffective. I can totally see how insane spirit would be but I've heard she's super hard to learn. Honestly, ghostface just looks really fun, and I was a big fan of the scream movies, but I don't want to get him if they've made him total shit. Can you explain his power to me a bit?
---
doit
---
Yeah, I got some mean comments left on my profile from this lobby as well. 
---
This isn't even the whole chat log. Lots of spamming. :)
---
I think this is referring to people that sit there and t-bag
---
Of course I‚Äôm not fooling anyone because it‚Äôs not a trick. This sub is just full of killer mains and bad ones at that. What‚Äôs worse is it‚Äôs an echo chamber.
---
they're\*
---
That's honestly the first positive thing I've heard about him in a VERY long time lol
---
Sorry to say but if the killer has Noed, you lack BT, your Teammate doesn't have DS or the killer is saving his kill and you decided to suicide dive face first into his cleaver there is no other expression to use other than "being stupid".
---
I do love smacking Meg, then playing Green Hill Zone in my head as she takes off at Sonic speed.
---
Yea its confusing, i had the sacrifice icon on the still livong suvivor and the one who died just kept the hooked icon.
---
If by Billy you mean Leatherface your doing yourself a disservice BBQ and Chili is the best killer perk for BP gain.
---
We either need more secret offerings or actually make secret offerings secret aka: they don't appear on the offering screen because most of the time you know it's a mori or Survivors are going to start together.
---
I mean, you've literally done nothing but insult people instead of actually telling people why you think NOED is overpowered.
---
Nice, just wait until you hit the BP cap. That‚Äôs a good feeling, especially before a DLC is about to drop.
---
 Say Goat face its not OP its just dumb  
---
\* 1 hit kill ? yes, plus only need few seconds to charge in the oppositte of Michael Mayers that takes the whole match, (you could say its a Legion with 1 hit kill like Mayers withouth the cooldowns and disadvantages of both + survivors skills like Nea or Meg)  
---
\*run more than all survivors and all killers, yes the base speed its average but on chase run more than Meg on sprint and Legion toguethers  
---
\*stalking with not terror radious ?? yes  
---
\*weapon lunge that dont fits to his weapon size like Freddy ?? yes  
---
\*Aura reading like leather face BBQ and chile or Nurse reading auras?? yes  
---
\*run when crouched like Nea or the Pig ?? yes  
---
\*hard to spot because black clothes ? yes  
---
\*Blocking the main target of suvivors(engines) like the hag with "Ruin" ?? yes  
---
\*Only need teleport like the Nurse to be perfect right ??  
---
Oh so we need to learn how to break his camouflage? why ? LOL he isnt invisible he dont give a \*\*\*\* that you look at him, he will run to you, and oneshot you in 5 seconds, you can look at him all you want lol.  
---
whats your problem ?? dont want play other thing than ghost face right  ?? thats why you came here to complain because all other killers are underpowered compared to him and you cant do anything with them right ??, because its a p2w OP char ?? then dont play the game, you think i say this cuz i m survivor?? i m not, i play as killer when i m alone and survivor when i m with friends, and its annoying for both as survivor cuz its game breaking, and as killer makes me repent i spent my money on buy other killers like Mayers, i bought Michael Mayers and i needs 10 mins to do what Ghost face do in 10 seconds, so i want a refund or a BIG NERF to ghostface, do you really get fun waiting 5 mins to start a match and when its start 3 ppl DC in the moment see you and the one that didnt DC die in less than 10 seconds ?? its that fun ?? you get lots of blood points when all survivors DC because the killer its broken and its breaking the game??
---
It's for unhooking yourself, not others.
---
I did that in the first comment and the rest of the comments have been nothing but replies hurling insults at me telling me I‚Äôm stupid for having an opinion on a perk, so yes you‚Äôd be correct in saying that all my replies after the first aren‚Äôt defending the perk so much as replying in kind to the comments.
---
I mean, for the most part it‚Äôs always like this when the first survivor is found as soon the game starts.
---
wish i only had a few toxic survivors
---
&gt; Especially against organised Survivors
---
they don't have anything to do with the balance of the game. It's like saying Eboni mori is balanced.
---
an organized team isn't the point of the game. You lose against them, and it's normal.
---
How is that growing a pair? I believed I had to unpopular opinion so I stated that. Calm your tits dude
---
Spirit is great if you master her.
---
Leatherface for BBQ&amp;Chili so you don't have to wait years for it to appear on the SOS
---
Yess I have heard that that perk is amazing, but I just don't like him as much as the other killers. I'll definitely try to pick up that perk if I can with iredecent shards though.
---
So, after all that practicing and hours of practicing on the nurses side, your going to fuck her up, and others, because of your personal preference? You don't even know if she's a god nurse
---
He's also not as bad as people make him out to be.
---
Put chainsaw sprint and reach on that bad boy and you'll see survivors dropping with a pikachu face left and right.
---
It's also so dbd to dc when something doesn't go your way
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
And they say Leatherface is a weak killer...
---
Again doing this for the DBD community as a whole and no one has to ask for me to want to do something like this. As for your other comment I assume you are talking about my gameshare posts. I'm not getting free stuff from those by the way. It's a trade not a giveaway. I am also not working alone so you don't have to worry about me being the one in charge of the prize.
---
It's obvious that you do not want to be a part of this so I ask that you no longer respond this is the last time I will respond to you.
---
Yes, the Nurse is boring to face, even if she sucks, I prefer an excellent Billy over a no blink Nurse
---
Oi i just prestiged my feng so i dont have anything else to play except meg k? :D
---
It‚Äôs the Golden Rule at this point. 
---
Every Leatherface has NOED. No exceptions.
---

The sky is blue

Doing gens,
---
How about you?
---
But they don't have swords!
---
Wtf lol?  Hey I know ... lets all run to the basement together!
---
I wish Plague was a little more effective,  she's so unique with the vomiting in people that I'd like to give her a try.  
---
I just don't want to spend money on a killer that's not as good as the ones I already have.
---
I would be down for that but if we need to put that much more work in him, I think it would be better just to leave him out. A killer that has a lot done to them like what people want from Chucky would definitely have a lot of glitchces and bugs, which might not all be fixed in the PTB, or could lead to others bugs, as we have seen. Maybe qhen BHVR gets better at making a game with less bugs I'd say go for it, but for now, with how buggy the game is a lot of the time, I say no.
---
sprint burst has to be the most predictable perk in this game
---
Frank used to sit in the chair next to nurse, now he can be found in the dumbster out back with several  ~~nerf~~ stab wounds. There can only be one killer who ignores pallets and frank didnt have a cape so he deserved it!
---
In my view I think all the killers would just be confused and stand and look at the survivor for a moment. Then it‚Äôs back to hitting them again.
---
Just keeping do gens and such. Get a pip out of your rank. Higher the rank, the less chance of campers
---
I love your comment thank you stranger
---
Well it's stated in the lore that The Entity doesn't understand exactly how the world works/looks, so it just tries to copy everything it sees as best as we can. Hence the Entity Horse and weird other map stuff

LOL. I upload a video. This happen to me and my friend with ghostface and trapper as the killers on ps4.
---
It should be Claudette,  shes always taking so much abuse from everyone.
---
Oh. OH. How the fuck do you do that???
---
yeah theyre gonna do some bad things to my girl. prolly gonna be a worse nerf than mettle got, the better something is the worse they make it
---
It wouldn't work and tbh I'd rather see BHVR work on other things than watch them try and fail to balance a killer like Chucky for over a year.
---
oh yeah lemme just do the fun run and ignore the gens, teammates and being zoned by the killer
---
My head hurts already.
---
The tunnel man is hard, you say ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I am a rank 11 killer and I wait about 3 minutes for a lobby.It's not bad but it's not great either.Dedicated servers can't come soon enough
---
Temƒça-kun
---
I really think Doc just needs a buff to the base shock range/or remove the 110% ms in treatment mode. He has a all these interesting add ons but you have to bring an electorde if you plan on using shock therapy at all. Like a lot of the other killers outside the top tier, he feels gimped for the sake of being gimped. 
---
Granted, nullying stealth is a strength in and of itself, but he is still woefully weak against good survivors.
---
I appreciate the detail to full pass, heres hoping doc gets some love. Good work. 
---
Also, WHY THE FUCK DID THE DEVS CRANK THE SHOCK SCREAM VOLUME. Its fucking earsplitting and makes a killer thats already not very fun to play against that much more intolerable.
---
It was so well hidden that the meme might be too subtle.
---
Rank 11 and usually about 3 minutes
---
Well, why do you find her boring?
---
Yeah he really does
---
&gt;an organized team isn't the point of the game. You lose against them, and it's normal.
---
What the fuck is the balance of this game
---
Y‚Äôall really haven‚Äôt played much if you think you can‚Äôt save someone during NOED but ok go ahead and downvote lol.
---
Keep lying to proplr and yourself
---
That sure is working out for you and now that you are getting call out you get salty
---
That's what I thought,  how would they be any different from Legion?
---
You should really be level 5 at least after a few days of playing
---
*happy wraith nosies*
---
Yikes.
---
People shit on him before they take the time to learn him and his play style. They want to be able to pick him up in minutes instead of taking the time to learn how to use him. I play both ps4 and pc so i know that its consistant across the platforms
---
It's the best when survivors teabag at the exit and then get caught and killed
---
Exit.
---
I wish...
---
Your first comment was extremely passive aggressive and the rest just became insulting.
---
NOED is not a broken perk. Its counters literally render it useless. Get all the totems? Might as well not have brought in a perk. Get out before the killer finds you? Didn't work. Only secures one kill out of four? Most likely depipped and three others got out.
---
Complaining about NOED is similar to complaining about camping. All they do is teach killers bad habits and they very rarely get rewarded for it unless you're playing at high ranks where survivors are new/bad and don't know what to do.
---
Main Spirit.
---
People have straight up told me they dc'd because I was Spirit.
---
Haha right. I can imagen her just blowing up on the others and the killer just stood and starts backing away like (damn that bitch is crazy)
---
That ain‚Äôt lag, he‚Äôs hacking the game. Send this too BHVR support and they‚Äôll punish him.
---
To be fair, he kind of needs it.
---
Honestly, I think *all* offerings should be secret except to the one who brought it in. The number of offerings that are "secret" are so few and far between you know exactly what it is for either side. we also need more variety as to what the offerings can do, only about one in five offerings actually affect gameplay.
---
Oh yeah, shit.
---
No, just sharing art.
---
Luck. Deliverance. Perseverance. Lol.
---
&gt;!Don't mind it, I thought people would go "You were the chosen one !"!&lt;
---
Killer queue takes forever even at Rank 15 PS4. Thats normal.
---
Whats weird is I always get 3 survivors RIGHT AWAY but a fourth one never joins, and when she joins another one leaves, and we're stuck with 3 survivors. This happens everytime I create a lobby.
---
There is no benefit from this. Why would you want to make queue times longer than they already are?
---
Scorch!!!
---
In my honest and humble   o p i n i o n, I prefer the traditional chases, a killer running behind the survivor in a more realistic way I guess. I can see why people like the Nurse though, I just don't like her at all.
---
You know, you‚Äôre the second person to say that and honestly it tells me all I need to know about this subreddit because you just completely glossed over the EXACT SAME COMMENT FROM
---
THE KILLER SIDE right above mine that I was replying too. But of course this subreddit doesn‚Äôt care about that one. Because you‚Äôre all killer mains, and average ones at best.
---
GhostFace's power is called Night Shroud. 
---
When you click M2 you no longer have a terror radius or a red stain and you can stalk survivors by holding M2. Stalking them for about 4 seconds makes them exposed for about 40. You can also crouch and peak to stay hidden better. It doesn't run out until a survivor stares at you for about 5 seconds. (easier said than done)
---
hes def one of my favorite and most used killers.
---
what is he lying about lol
---
Amanda deserves to be thicc have you seen her in her new cosmetic?

Check out Otzdarva's video on what killers to buy

I love it when someone sits on the hook and instead of my teammates saying fuck that and tea bag at the gates they will sometimes save that person
---
"he"
---
Your thr same person rofl
---
im assuming you're talking about playing survivor and ive got no idea what youre on about, ive been finding instant lobbies as surv, it's killer that's got the long wait rn
---
üëå
---
You literally haven't replied to the argument. After your initial complaint you've done nothing but assert bias runs rampant on the subreddit or insult those who disagree with you.
---
Why the fuck would you bow to a thing whose whole purpose in life is to get you killed
---
Iron Will is a good survival perk. You don't have to get nervous every time you're injured and in the killer's terror radius. Bond if you are a solo survivor and wanna get dem heals.
---
You can‚Äôt Mori me if I DC during the loading screen :)
---
Cool but this has nothing to do with Dead By Daylight
---
I use adrenaline, small game, were gonna farm forever, and balanced landing. But for your build since you're use to using self care, bond should be good for you.
---
Typical
---
As said already this post isn't about people saving in the endgame it's about idiots crying that they died to Noed BECAUSE they wanted to save. I didn't even downvote anything but if you want who am I to say no "LOL"
---
I don‚Äôt like using bond as survivors will also find a reason to why they got found (the excuse I lead the killer to them). And it‚Äôs not that I get nervous while in the terror radius, I just find self care way worse now and just want a better perk. But thank you :)
---
Thare*
---
Exhausted? idk
---
nah d boi. gottem internet pedo
---
if that's how you see it, you clearly have no idea how to do it right
---
Perhaps orgy is a better word to use than clusterfuck.
---
The amount of people that have never seen a warehouse is hilarious
---
Thats pretty cool is it like you have to destroy all of them to do anything to the perk or will destroying one affect its effectiveness
---
Bond
---
Yeah sounds like a good suggestion. Thank you :)
---
PS4 lobbies are broken since they fixed the Shrine
---
When no survivors are within 40 meters of you, you repair the gens 5/10/15% faster
---
I feel bad for my friend because she always gets tunneled or at the very least feels singled out, and I think it's because she sucks at being chased sometimes, kinda the opposite problem.
---
yea he only wanted to hook everyone twice for points and they killed themselves
---
Again this post isn't about people wanting to save it's about the idiots crying about Noed etc. BECAUSE they wanted to save. I didn't downvote anything but if you ask so kindly who am I to deny "LOL"
---
You can close the hatch?
---
thar
---
Like anything will even happening. I‚Äôve been reporting for people calling me N words in post game chat, I still see them sometimes playing just fine.
---
No prob my friend!
---
The killer can close the hatch.
---
Sucks to be a faggot, you must be really mad at the world.
---
Don't. Use. Flash. On. A. Monitor.
---
Source about Skilled Huntress being bugged? Just curious, because I haven‚Äôt heard about it but I had a couple of long range downs in the last two days and it would be frustrating if they wouldn‚Äôt count.
---
2 high 4 me
---
Love the idea but what would be his power?
---
you could just play your main and put the points into them until your comfortable enough to use them
---
The main concern people have is that the offerings would be unable to be used (disabled like the moonlight offerings or other event offerings). That said, multiple developers have confirmed you can use them any time after the event without restriction. Mclean confirmed (he gets asked semi-frequently every time he's been live during the event) it on his stream and Peanits has confirmed it in passing in multiple twitch channel chats (though I don't have a screenshot or anything)
---
Gives us 103% instead of the 300% that we deserve
---
Hag is S tier when it comes to jumpscares
---
please tell me how im the same person lol like its obviously your saying as a joke or reflect any point send to u. XD but please tell me how he is begging for stuff and how you are exactly calling him out or how is he exactly lying?
---
I still stand by making the killer Tiffany and she carries Chucky around. Tiffany would do all the standard M1 killer stuff, and Chucky will be incorporated in the ability and Mori. Make the heart of Dambala the core of his power, which has a bunch of voodoo like properties, in DBD context it can perma buff Chucky and/or perma debuff survivors during the match.
---
Perhaps when you down a survivor instead of carrying them to the hook you forego that and perform the action on them while they're downed so you can choose between hooking them for a sacrifice or getting a permanent buff for later in the match, making his gameplay a bit more dynamic in that you have to choose to sacrifice asap or try and snowball hard mid to late game after buffing yourself from the survivors.
---
Also the Mori can be an homage to the bride of Chucky where Tiffany puts Chucky on her old boyfriend and has him suffocate him. In dbd Tiffany can force the survivor down, lay Chucky on top of them, then suddenly Chucky comes to life and kills them in some way, it can be generic stabbing, suffocating them, anything really.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought but it shows up before the exhaustion gets triggered.
---
So I normally use dead hard and self care as my main perks, and the other two perks I kinda just have fun with. I try different things depending on the mood. Deliverance or borrowed add a situational thrill; not strong all the time, but when you need it, you‚Äôll be glad you have it. If your goal is to be helpful to others rather than yourself, we‚Äôll make it can help mitigate the sloppy butcher dynamic. 
---
The point is: because you‚Äôre using two pretty meta perks, adrenaline and dead hard, you can pick anything that you think will be fun. Even experimenting with ace in the hole could add another aspect and change your play style, keeping the games from being repetitive and adding an occasional surprise.
---
To be fair Leatherface is the best character to play if you're a cheater, since he has an almost completely free instadown. Almost every clip of a cheater I see on this subreddit is someone playing Leatherface.
---
Other hacker favorites include Huntress and strangely Nurse.
---
he damm look gud
---
On PC the achievement is 20 downs. Xbox and PS4 it's 100 which is wrong. ''
---
Skilled Huntress
---
In public matches, down survivors 20 times with The Huntress' Hatchets further than 24 meters.
---
''
---
Off to Narnia we go.
---
Legion ability is also Terror Radius based.
---
Tf is that build
---
I've had the same thing happen to me with an Adam, only he suicided on hook instead of DCing.
---
Ended the game with about 1000 points lol.
---
Did you actually get the bloodpoints?
---
Yeah sloppy butcher is a big counter to healing but healing in general is quite slow now, unless you use botany knowledge and even then it‚Äôs quite slow. I like the idea of using different perks and having fun :) thank you for the long response :)
---
Good job m8! Keep it up!
---
Nah, this subreddit just purges itself every week, thats why you always see the same memes
---
Mind Control killer.   
---
Your terror radius is a cone in front of you. If a survivor stand within the radius for long enough, he becomes captivated. Striking an injured and captivated killer will allow the killer to take control of the survivor instead of putting them into the dying state. The survivor can attempt a faster version of wiggling to snap out of the mind control.  
---
For as long as the killer remains in control, he may do any action the survivor can do, but is also able to put himself on a hook. If the killer is stunned or the survivor host is blinded, the killer loses control instantly and is returned to his own body.   
---
Once a survivor has been taken control of, all other captivated survivors lose their captivated status, otherwise it lasts for a certain amount of time outside the killers radius.
---
My pleasure! Dwight is the notorious locker enthusiast, after all.
---
Not enough players already lol.
---
it was because my friend dead harded (which he almost dcd to that too) then pallet stunned him then I instahealed
---
That‚Äôs literally my main build lmao
---
Pretty awesome! Worth showing off! Now try and get those adept killer achievements!
---
Imagine thinking Ruin is not the best killer perk kn the game jesus christ
---
True, true.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Trapper have a miners helmet in one of his cosmetics?
---
Feels bad man
---
"Laughs in adrenaline"
---
I can‚Äôt even stress how core ruin is on killers. Not running ruin is like a survivor not being able to throw down pallets or vault windows. It‚Äôs gonna be a short game!
---
What if it‚Äôs a wraith tho
---
Decisive strike, ironwill, deadhard,borrowed time, well make it, alert, adrenaline...
---
When ur nurse and NOED activates
---
Vomit mommy are you serious?
---
Are you so dumb that you can‚Äôt see the hypocrisy in calling out my comment as a passive aggressive complaint when it was a play on the comment saying NOED is a good perk? You‚Äôre correct that all I‚Äôve done is insult those that have insulted me, because they don‚Äôt argue the point at all all they‚Äôve said so far is ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong because this is my opinion!‚Äù I‚Äôm telling you that it‚Äôs a fact that the developers have said the game is (poorly) balanced around the time it takes five gens being done. Notice how I didn‚Äôt say a secondary objective in there? That‚Äôs because it isn‚Äôt balanced for that. Those are bonus points meant as an afterthought if your team is doing really well. This game has continuously been balanced around SWF and average killer ability and it shows. I guess the devs will just have to keep wondering why the player base is shrinking every fiscal quarter even though they keep adding new content.
---
Okay
---
it's so funny seeing noobys freak out over iri button
---
That glare was actually from my window, I just hadn't closed it all the way
---
Isn't that team super balanced or am I just missing sarcasm like a Dwight finds lockers?
---
Oof, I've gotten survivor adepts but killers that's gonna be fun
---
What if they changed legion so you controlled 3 other AI killers
---
Yeah, it's a little disappointing to always need that one perk to help win. I'd say the only killer who doesn't need Hex: Ruin is probably Nurse.
---
Nahhh
---
Fair enough i thought its a flash because half the people in Reddit take pictures of their monitors with flash on. Okay carry on have a nice day
---
when u go to the gen in killer shack and the survivor tries to hide in the basement but you hear them go EEEEEE as the drop down the stairs
---
boy you do not get sarcasm do you? like everything that too must be spoonfed to you. fuck off
---
That‚Äôs the plan.
---
There‚Äôs two types of totems: Dull Totems and Hex Totems. Dull Totems don‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre on fire, and Hex Totems do. Hex Totems are associated with Hex Perks, and destroying a single Hex Totem will invalidate the affects of the associated Hex Perk. If a killer is running more than one Hex Perk, than more than one Hex Totem will spawn.
---
Same. It takes forever to find a game when killer but when survivor maybe 2 or 3 minutes for me. I‚Äôm rank 9 survivor and killer. 
---
The moment someone leaves another person joins and then it just stays with 3 survivors until the killer leaves or I get really lucky and get a 4 person lobby. I just think they know about this and don‚Äôt care smh
---
I've been running around the hatch for bout a year now trying to gaurd it it never mentioned it lol   you on console?
---
I forgot to mention prayer beads sprit is the only way but it‚Äôs also painfully unfun. I don‚Äôt like op builds.
---
Ghostface might do it for the selfie.
---
Wraith definitely would. He‚Äôs just a tortured soul and I feel he doesn‚Äôt want to kill, he just HAS to.
---
Pig would because it‚Äôs all part of ‚Äòthe game‚Äô
---
What about Nurse when she gets Devour Hope up?
---
I play killer and survivor. Don't expect a 4k every game and you won't feel like your getting bullied. 
---
Escape rate (with average 1 or 2 survivors escaping) is around 40% in red ranks. Feelings and biases aside, that actually shows that killers need to be balanced.
---
Use shards...
---
After you buy him and go to sleep your dick grows and in the morning it ends up 15 inches bigger
---
You're gonna get down voted but you're absolutely right. NOED can be hard countered if you are really worried about it but people would rather scream for nerfs than adapt their play style. If every survivor cleansed dull totems when they saw them you would see nobody using NOED because they'd never get to use it and it would be a wasted perk slot.
---
At least he wasn‚Äôt selfish with an escape cake or survivor pudding
---
Woooow
---
I was saving those for perks.
---
Ghost girl scary
---
Possibly Billy but only if your a god at playing him. The rest must have it on.
---
Terror levels so high you start hallucinating other killers XD
---
that. is cool
---
I use Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, and Decisive Strike consistently. I love it :)
---
I always wanted a top-down view killer that used the environment instead of a main body.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm on console
---
Honestly I've had two survivors hit level 5 but I've just been really indecisive about which survivor I want to play.
---
That's not what it's saying 'lmao'
---
I would take the merman from Cabin in the woods over chucky. Both sitting about two foot tall.
---
MegHead! :D
---
I can see that. Thank you for being civil
---
Is this the new doctor buff? :O
---
PS4 has been broke since they fixed the Shrine
---
Literally me a few days go. Ace kept t-bagging so I thought he was just memeing around. Turns out he wanted to warn me we were being stalked by Myers. Nice job me.
---
What button is it thx
---
Thanks to you my dude/girl, is rare to see people like you in this community
---
I always write gg and when I get salt I simply add lol ez and leave
---
Oh okay so it's not like evil within right? It just exposes them?
---
I don‚Äôt know why they would. I‚Äôm perfectly fine with stronger killers. Making killers weak encourage camping and tunneling. Killers with a terrifying presence make the game more difficult for survivors, but that‚Äôs what we need. In my opinion, it‚Äôs pretty easy for competent survivors to escape. Nurse is one of the killers I love facing because the skill involved to predict and blink directly correlate with skill
---
It's a visual bug with the spectator camera, screen effects can be seen from other views when using spectator camera
---
That's how it should be tho, don't expect to escape every game. The killer is the one who needs to kill the survivors, they will get out only if they are smart. Even in some horror films the final girl dies, that's how it be sometimes. Also I agree that some killers need to be balanced like Nurse.
---
I feel called out
---
Why give killers more cake offerings when it takes a year to find a lobby? Seems like an oversight. I have like 80 on hag but 2 on Nea. I'll never be able to use them all on killer.
---
Agree with the message but hate the meme. Like just write the text. It adds nothing.
---
Hell
---
Lullaby intensifies
---
just read another convo i had here in this thread this operation dude got too angry that he couldn't even read sarcasm. 
---
i don't care about downvotes, tho i m a killer main i like to play both sides n 99% of time i m playing solo. totems won't take much time if every survivor do 1 totem only. but they would rather cry about exploring the map. This is the only game I have seen people complaining about exploration is bad.
---
These surv mains want to simply gen rush n finish game under 5 mins and then they will also cry about game becoming boring. Hyppocratric
---
Fucks. nothing else.
---
If anyone could do it, it wouldn‚Äôt be called an ‚ÄúAchievement.‚Äù It‚Äôs an accomplishment for a reason
---
Pharmacy
---
Legit haven‚Äôt seen one on fucking forever playing both sides.
---
Killers almost always go to the area that a Survivor was rescued from. Sorry that I don't want to be tunnelled.
---
100 was the original value on PC for a brief period as well. Xbox was reduced to 20 a while ago I think. A dev said they cannot do the same with the PS4 trophy because trophies may only be changed if the trophy becomes impossible to achieve due to changes in the game.
---
Not happy about this, but as long as the hits count I am fine with it, it‚Äôs an insane grind but Huntress is my main so I play her most of the time and I will get it sooner or later.
---
I did this as a level 5 hag. About rank 13 or 12 i cant remember
---
I don't know what platform your on but the playstation store has all the dlc 50% off.  I think steam is having a summer sale right now also. I haven't been able to check it out though

What a shit comment

Never mind you‚Äôre just here to say dumb shit lol

feel like the glitch has gotten more prevalent as of 3.0. Dont know why

remember when leather face came out? lol
---
I would love to play her too, but the framerate is too to play on an acceptable level
---
Gimme some sugar, baby.
---
Big pee pee powers
---
i just got shudders
---
It involves having survivors that keep getting caught though and you have to let them get dehooked to allow enough time to get the other stuff.

I can‚Äôt remember what button exactly because I main survivor but when you hover over the hatch when it‚Äôs open it will say close the hatch and what button to press. It was added around the time the end game mode was added.
---
Hahaha!
---
Wraith motioning towards his cowl: "This is silk."
---
No mither.
---
I feel like this game is the furthest thing from balanced. I never played with people other than the squad so idc but I guess there's a whole community of solo queue comp players and I kinda feel bad for you guys cuz its just gonna be rage from here on out lmao
---
Not quite my terror radius
---
Yeah that's how the game works, I don't get to Mori you, but some other poor survivor.
---
2 days ago I had a injured survivor teabagging the gate. I was pig so I snuck around the edge and ambushed them and they got hooked. It was so satisfying.
---
Ghostface, myers can't tbag
---
We don't expect to escape every game. 
---
Perfect balance is escaping 50% of the time, or two people escaping every match on average.
---
That's clearly not the case, as killers are slightly favored according to the stats. If you feel like youre getting bullied, with killers being slightly over powered, it's because you're not good at the game or your expectations (4k every match) are too high.
---
LOL it's always a Meg
---
lol people are dumb. how did that get -30 points? 4 totems usually spawn near the corners of the map and the fifth one is close to the center in 80% of the matches.
---
Do people really hate totems so much that they downvote anyothe that tells them how to fucking find them?
---
You explained it way better lol
---
Moris should be removed from offerings and added as part of more perks like Rancor and Devour Hope or add ons like Myers
---
I would like to add that there is one perk called none escapes death.  If at the end of the match after all generators are powered there are any dull totems left, one of them will become lit and the perk will activate. The perk exposes all survivors and allows them to be downed in one hit. This is why its sometimes worth it to cleanse any totems you see to prevent this.
---
Also rank 7, also happening to me. FeelsBad
---
And he took A mori, because he really hates you.
---
Talking about skill while using Legion....give me a break. He‚Äôs a braindead killer and should be completely reworked.
---
As for Plague, Truetalent has had a fair but of luck with her with his current build.
---
My girlfriend played against a Leatherface who was also pretty laggy and she suspected that he might be lagswitching. Did you catch the name of the bubba?

Bullied is also when they teabag on every pallet, use crutch perks and SWF Neon Neas and Fengs with flashlights, it's not about being good or not. I don't feel like getting bullied if they do generetora, gg for them. I feel bullied when you teabag, that's it. Well coordinated SWF teams know how they can win games easily, that's why they are going to bully the killer because there's no reason to play fair or non toxic when you have reached a determinated rank or you are bored, also communication is a crutch, it deletes the whole meaning of some perks.
---
Bro I‚Äôve been stuck at rank 19 for a week cuz I keep getting looped. I know I suck at the game but ffs a killer should be able to end a loop easier
---
Yass üòÇ
---
Thank you, you're shortening my queue time.
---
That's the ability of my King Crimson!
---
Ahh I'll give it a go anyway
---
You're welcome &lt;3
---
unrelenting too op makes people dc please nerf.
---
Feels doctor shock and swap fuck your pallet
---
Yes same, when i play nurse and they put bps or cake event i farm with people cuz i understand that playing agaisnt a good nurse can be boring and if you put event cakes and you die only doing 1 gen is fucking sad
---
If you want a killer that rewards being harder to play and has a higher learning curve try Nurse or Spirit.
---
Legion‚Äôs power was brainless and required no skill to use even before it got nerfed into oblivion. Now it doesn‚Äôt even have a point. You‚Äôd basically be playing M1 killer no power.
---
I got Legion to P3L50 and have most of the perks on them. They‚Äôve always been a badly designed killer.
---
A killer that vaults pallets and windows? Okay but you do it so much more slowly that combined with the stun at the end it makes survivors able to infinite loop you if you try to chase them using it.
---
If you hit them when they‚Äôre already injured while using your power it does nothing.
---
Legion is Freddy tier. Their power is an actual hindrance if you use it.
---
People telling you ‚ÄúLegion is fine‚Äù are either diehard fans of the Killer or survivors who were happy they got nerfed and want to justify the overkill.
---
I got successfully complete two sacrifices.
---
As the nurse.
---
On console.
---
Why is the xbox store not doing the 40% on dlc like steam and ps4? Xbox store also has DLC priced at a higher rate compared to the others.
---
Survivors will claim camping when they unhook right when you go to leave and wonder why you down the person right off the hook. What are you supposed to do when they unhook the moment you turn away?
---
Spacebar
---
Happens to me constantly, I usually just end up stocking up bloodpoints for a killer and boost him to lvl 20 before playing
---
We just need a killer with a gun.
---
Good. ‚ÄúGo try civilization‚Äù because ‚Äúwe think we‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Dont play just to please others, do you. And who the fuck cares about what randoms have to say about you? Not like they pay your bills or anything. Game is toxic and will always be toxic, don't let it get to you.
---
Totally agree, people seem to think that a killer has to go for fresh meat whenever possible, but I‚Äôm playing to win not just so you have fun
---
yea but lazer beam is stronger than that
---
I'd love to see the results when they release them. The only time I have issues getting a 4k is playing killers I haven't leveled up yet though. If I play my main, I have zero issues getting 4ks. Although I have dropped pretty low from not playing for so long so maybe there is an issue in high rank, but honestly I feel like if you're good enough with your killer (unless the killer is just shit tier... *Freddy* ) and have decent perks you shouldn't have a problem getting a 4k.
---
Yea, I agree the second isn't the best concept. I just was trying to think of an anti-loop perk since bloodlust doesn't help at a lot of loops.
---
riiip :'(
---
Been trying my best, just triggering when I like go out of my way to be less toxic and still get stuff like this though, thanks anyway
---
...who?
---
Through July 2nd I believe
---
Uhh, it quite literally tells you how on the event description on the steam store.
---
Unpopular opinion, I want him in the game. He could be really interesting to go against. He could have a cool mechanic where he switched between human and doll form. In human form he's relatively slow but can pick up survivors. But in doll form he's pretty quick and would have to stab a survivor four times, since he's so short in order to down them. When he's in doll form he could also crawl under pallets but couldn't jump through windows as fast since he would literally have to JUMP through them. Also another small cool thing could be like Freddy or the huntress he could have a unique terror radius when in doll form, it could be him laughing and that's how you know he's in doll form.
---
\^ This.
---
i agree at 92.7% personaly. But that's like my opinion
---
Marty from Cabin in the Woods.
---
Oh shit, I'm a total idiot.
---
Yeah, I'd fuckin' love Marty in DBD
---
Freddy top tier finally!!!!
---
"gO pLaY sOmEtHiNg ElSe!" Am I right?
---
That's not a lag not even lagswitch, that's a cheat
---
People keep saying not cleansing is a counter lmao. Youre one shot the entire game. Its really not a counter. Yall can keep thinking that tho.
---
I‚Äôm fully aware that the Legion is underpowered. and I do play the Nurse, but I love playing characters that are harder to learn and play. believe it or not, but not everyone cares about winning. I want to play the Legion because they‚Äôre a fun interactive character that punishes teamwork and rewards thinking outside of the box. 
---
I basically neglect the top tier characters in games I play because they‚Äôre not interesting. Yes, learning the Nurse could get me wins, but what‚Äôs the point if she‚Äôs so plain, simple, and overall boring?
---
Trap daddy is not skinny.  He is very beefy. ü•∞
---
Unrelates but okay.
---
Are we really still bitching about decisive strike? Jesus why is it when we bring up any killer perk there HAS to be an exact opposite for the survivors.
---
Is this a heathers refrence ? Well fuck me gently with a chainsaw
---
Hat!
---
I hate when that happen, i didn't tunnel or camp why are you fucking toxic omg
---
You‚Äôre talking about a killer that ignores pallets. A good doctor will never deal with a pallet because the shock animation blocks a survivor from throwing down the pallet at all.
---
Honestly same
---
Xbox lobbies have been slow too. It could take 15+ minutes just to move from "searching" in to a lobby for survivors to join. 
---
Last night was the fastest I had seen it.
---
Next killer is Maul confirmed
---
Had a game where I was doing a totem on the side of a hill. Suddenly teleported to the killer shack, where the Pig smacked me. Was nuts, since everything'd been fine up til that point.
---
I don't think you actually depip even if that's what is indicated in the end game menu.
---
Question, what is this perk? I  assume it's a perk at least.
---
Please we need our favorite woke horror stoner!
---
Its pretty astonishing the amount of broken elements this game has
---
No it's just a totem icon to say cleanse me.
---
I main claudette and i have literally never gotten a claudette daily. same with huntress tbh, i swear all my killer dailies are hillbilly
---
It is this exact reason that this kind of behavior should be punished harshly, especially since it is now a lot harder to rank up  (if you are even worried about that kind of things since there isnt a real point to it).
---
If there are issues I obviously get pissed but I get it, what I get mad at is the devs behaving as if everything was good, completely ignoring the issue even exists
---
Well that would make sense why I couldn't find a perk that matched this lol. Thank you
---
Idk why this bothers you... I mean for the killer, if she was paying attention, that's an easy injury, or if they stay another down.
---
&gt; People keep saying not cleansing is a counter lmao
---
no. We don't cleanse 'cause she's weaker with a full team of no mither than wih her corrupt power enable.
---
I mean, it could have been a hill Billy charging across the map and downing you in half the time it took the spirit.
---
Lmao but ok
---
Self care, ds, adernaline, unbrekable
---
What are his perks,which are good
---
I have never seen a Claudette daily either tbh.
---
Ive heard people say "Its her counter". Dont speak for the entire community my guy.
---
What's NOED and what do cleansing the totems actually do? I'm a noob lmao
---
Reminds me the keyblade masters from the Kingdom Hearts series
---
you could've been healed by the time you ran into that corner.
---
Plague doesn't need anything so complicated. She just needs addons that don't suck. Right now, she has 7 good addons.
---
Emetic Potion, Infected Emetic, and Vile Emetic all increase the speed at which her Vile Purge injures survivors.
---
Blessed Apple and Ashen Apple both start the trial with a pool of devotion already corrupted. 
---
Iridescent Seal gives Corrupt Purge whenever a generator is completed but reduces the duration.
---
Black Incense reveals survivor auras for 5 seconds whenever they vomit.
---
These 7 addons are her only useful ones. If she had addons that exhausted survivors in the broken state or blinded their aura reading, or hindered them, she'd be much stronger. Survivors would desperately try to cleanse to prevent exhaustion so they could Dead Hard again.
---
As for Legion, their power is too good at getting the first hit against survivors. But, they stun themselves for 4 seconds everytime the power ends. This basically guarantees that the survivor you were chasing gets away. Also, Legion's power is *useless* for downing survivors. They will never bleed out to Deep wounds and Legion can't down anyone in Feral Frenzy. If their power worked more like Spirit's, it would be a bit better. Start out as a 110% speed killer, use Feral Frenzy to chase and hit survivors. No Deep Wounds, no stun. No pallet vaulting or window vaulting. Of course, Legion would need some sort of drawback since Spirit's power causes you to lose sight of survivors otherwise Legion would just be a better version of Spirit. But that idea, as boring as it might sound to just be a copy of Spirit, is less frustrating for players to face than original Legion or current Legion. And Legion players would actually be able to play their favorite killer again instead of deranking whenever they choose this killer.
---
that's a hex Huntresses Lullaby
---
Do you play on console or pc?
---
Finding the hatch makes me feel bad so I just camp it, down the survivor, close the hatch and bring the freak to the exit doors for him to escape.
---
Also, matchmaking is a joke on killer, you can sacrifice 4 people and not even get the safe pip, so I don't bother sacrificing them too much. Just wanna play with them a little =)
---
console!
---
i'm an idiot, read it wrong at first. 
---
haven't encountered anything of this kind, sorry, mate D: that sounds like an awful bug
---
NOED is a perk called No one escapes death
---
It activates once all generators are completed and if there's any totems left
---
And dull totems (the normal ones) don't do anything but the burning totems called hex totems are a perk that will be disabled once you destroy the totem.
---
it realllllly is :( i felt like such a clown having to gen tap ahahaha
---
I lost my progress. I had 2 stars and now I have 1 out of 5.
---
It‚Äôs annoying playing stupid to get pips
---
The fucking OoOoOoO gets me every time
---
Probably my most wanted survivor next to Shaun from Shaun of the Dead
---
Idk how long you've been playing for but you sound new-ish. All i can say is have fun as much as you can and enjoy the game because with the current state of the game, you'll soon get bored. Sorry if it sounds like im not helping at all but im just giving my opinion. Just like i previously said. " do you, dont let entitled survivors get to you." Gl man.
---
Or just make the bloodhunt multiplier the default game, and the new bloodhunt would be 4x what it is now. There‚Äôs far too many characters to level now and it‚Äôs only getting worse.
---
Very true lol. If i haven't cleanses all 5 myself or at least found the ones that others have... I always just assume NOED is a thing lol
---
This is half the games I play these days.
---
I love you
---
Alright Fred
---
Zubat godly advice for facing a good nurse. Works for the spirit too.
---
[https://youtu.be/0K3bzI6aXQo?t=573](https://youtu.be/0K3bzI6aXQo?t=573)
---
Yeah, they just get exposed.
---
Same.
---
I made a post about this but seeing this post now:
---
If a survivor is on a hook and fails to be rescued or escape by perk, or are placed on a hook for that final time, the game HAS to count the kill the moment the entity strikes. Not after the sacrifice ritual animation ends and the hook breaks. 
---
There's an increase in disconnects (on Xbox, not sure other platforms) from players using this as a tactic. 
---
Maybe they are just eager to jump to a new game and don't want to sit through their character dying, which is more reason to count the death sooner. 
---
The killer earns a quitter bonus but this does not count towards rituals or challenges as a "successful sacrifice" even if the player has died and it was successful. The technicality falls on the player quitting and the game hadn't counted it as a death. 
---
I had 4 matches in a row where this happened, preventing any progress on the ritual. 
---
People disconnect all the time already for any number of reasons. But if you have died by hook and then disconnect, that needs to count as a successful death.
---
Nope, according to Bricky, a DBD streamer, there is a killer on BHVR's list that is supposed to be getting reworked after Freddy. Bricky wasn't allowed to say which killer, but the rumors about Nurse nerfs seem to indicate that she's the one getting reworked. Pretty obvious too, since all survivors claim that she's broken because they have to try something other than circle simulator and killers admit she's boring since survivors don't do anything other than circle simulator.
---
How can I do that when you‚Äôre BlOoDpOiNt EcOnOmY says I have to spend enough time on the game to be classified as ‚Äúdiseased‚Äù by the World Health Organization, in order to get all the perks? Amirite?
---
I pay no attention to toxic messages. The killer's job is to "kill". They want to blame you for doing poorly, instead of blaming themselves.Just play the way you want to play.Just try not to let it get to you.Also, I don't know if you are on PC or console, but you can turn off your messages.
---
Noed scenario : your scenario
---
100:1 ratio.
---
man I couldn‚Äôt even imagine the pain from the Dwight in that video
---
because everyone at red ranks ARE BODY BLOCKING CUNTS...that is why
---
My personal views probably mostly align with majority of the survivors on the topic of NOED.  However, NOED has a hard counter that may take some time, but is still a hard counter.  Then, people whine how unreliable it is to find all totems, etc., and I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúOh, I forgot Small Game got removed....‚Äù  
---
I know it‚Äôs tough, but if you truly hate NOED that much, put down one of your precious perks and slap Small Game on. Against old DS, many killers would run Enduring strictly to soften the blow of that perk.  It‚Äôs been done.
---
everyone is permanently Broken then. If they are all Broken and you struggle to hit survivors even once throughout a whole chase, then that's just lack of skill on your part.
---
Everything is unsafe at that point then, unless the survivors glue themselves to safe loops or ignore going for hook saves, they all become really easy downs. It isn't hard to make them all broken either as just interacting with the fully sick survivors makes you sick as well.
---
Not to mention they lose out on the effectiveness of syringes, adrenaline, and other healing perks as well until they cleanse.
---
Even the most basic of M1 killers can get the first hit on a chase rather easily without much use of their power with just basic positioning. It also only takes ONE person to cleanse for you to take full advantage of just destroying them all with a 1-shot ranged attack at which point the others either have to cleanse themselves or just be even easier to down.
---
I'm not sure where the rumor came from on Plague being a mediocre killer, but she has massive snowball potential, no matter how you play against her, whether it be from cleansing when you can, or not cleansing at all. She is easily one of the high mid tier killers.
---
Oh yeah he's my mainnnn. I LOVE HIM. I've kinda dropped back down to low level now, but low level survivors don't respect his power. You can get easy madness levels when they just stand on the other end of a pallet or window and then honestly if you wanted you could just walk away a bit and wait for them to move if they keep looping you. The screams, and add-ons that let you see their hallucinations make you such a force to be reckoned with because you'll know there positions almost constantly when you get higher level add-ons.
---
I also really enjoy his perks monitor and abuse, and overcharge. Overcharge just really helps with tracking, and I really like monitor and abuse in and of itself. The red stain hallucination gives you so much potential for outplay, the illusionary pallets really mess with people, and the doctor hallucinations make it so easy to track them from across the map. Also, personally, it's so fun to hear his wicked little laugh when you're shocking the shit out of someone lol.
---
I'm currently rank 12 and I probably average around 4 minutes.
---
Surprised no one had posted it, but the MAXIMUM MADNESS build is always my favorite:
---
Perks:
---
* Huntress Lullaby
---
* Distressing
---
* Unnerving Presence
---
* Overcharge
---
Add-ons
---
* Iridescent King + green/yellow electric node
---
OR
---
* Calm add-on + order add-on
---
The madness + Lullaby really fucks survivors over, especially if you camp 3 nearby gens with Overcharge. Expect lots of exploding gens and lots of post game salt.
---
Note: this build doesn't work well past purple ranks, but it's hella fun to play.
---
Easy, just dont get hit!
---
Lmao ok buddy
---
Also I thought self care and no mother was the best?
---
You guys are forgetting the biggest one:
---
Down 25 survivors in the Deep Wounds state, as Legion.
---
BuT kIlLeR iS oP
---
Do you ever play survivor and get camped? Do you enjoy it? /thread.
---
I like this idea for legion, where frenzy would be a burst of speed and you can cancel holding it to attack? With no cooldown and just regenerates? I think that would be a good idea if it worked like that.
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to make plague to be complicated but the change was legit just another health state, there‚Äôs nothing too complicated that ain‚Äôt already seen in current plague
---
So you want only 1 player to escape or no one? Happy you are not in the balancing team because this is not the definition of fun.
---
Which Queen of England current or past?
---
Ghostface isn‚Äôt even on here. Or am I extremely blind
---
Mannnnnn ....love me some cabin in the woods. üòçüëçüèª
---
Imagine how cool a cabin in the woods asymmetrical survival game would be!!!
---
Right? It's like I hate being tunnelled (not that that's the same) so I put down a perk for DS so it stops that from happening. And NOED gives totems more reason to be cleansed too.
---
This is very strange, the entire match didn‚Äôt seem laggy until that last second at the gate, very presumptuous. I‚Äôd send it to BHVR it‚Äôs either a horrible bug, I have seen this on the sub before, or a lag switch. If it‚Äôs a lag switch it‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs used one
---
Bt is a pretty good perk not many people run it though
---
Before the BNP nerf, my boys and I would SWF meme killers by taking 4 BNP‚Äôs in and popping 4 generators at the same time :^). 10/10 would do again
---
Whats the difference between a god nurse and a god billy? You all die in the end anyways.
---
STOP. Please!
---
I'm having PTSD flashbacks to infinite loops and permanently broken hooks.
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt played or experienced much of either Killer, but okay. If playing what you think is low tier sates your ego theres plenty of other options that have powers that aren‚Äôt pointless. I‚Äôd encourage you to stick with Trapper.
---
I‚Äôve noticed, on PC, a few different glitches that happen, to me at least. I currently cannot provide proof because I‚Äôm on a mobile device however here‚Äôs the two issues:
---
1. Spirit Fury‚Äôd Pallets always glitch out leaving a piece of wood that you glitch thru every time you walk through the broken pallet.
---
2. (This has only happened once) However, I was playing against a ghost face and had issues not being able to wiggle whatsoever, don‚Äôt know what that was.. then I got off the hook and opened an exit gate and well, went to escape. Once I got to the area where it usually cuts to the escaped screen I just went right through it. I went back and tried to go thru it again but to no avail. It wasn‚Äôt my connection because my teammate went thru and escaped. Then the killer came to me and started to move around as well.  Any ideas or is this just on my end?
---
Bitching about NOED won't bring MoM back. Nor will it see NOED nerfed when it has a pretty straightforward counter.
---
well when i just hit the record button , you can see that he's just stood there , then i teleport back to him. and then when he hooks me he stands still while they lag out and move weird and then shes instant exposed but he was bad at catching so took a while before she went down.
---
Then finally again at the exit gates he activated his ability again :(
---
Then u miss your ds
---
tl;dr.
---
As a killer main, I think NOED could use adjustments. DS is fine. Maybe adjust the time frame of how long it stays up but it wouldn't be that big of a deal if that change didn't happen.
---
Fuckin' Dwight in a locker too
---
Do y‚Äôall Mfs not count the totems? There‚Äôs 5 on like every map
---
At least with billy you can get pallet stunt points I guess, also the fact that a maniac with a chainsaw is trying to kill you has more chance of happening in real life over a flying sack of potatoes makes it better tbh
---
Sooo you want to go against baby killers who fall for loops and tunnels the whole match to have satisfaction of seeing the killer fucking die?
---
Hillbilly
---
&gt; People keep saying
---
&gt; Dont speak for the entire community my guy
---
talk to a psy i don't know do something
---
You‚Äôre aware this was about three years ago, correct?
---
Or just wait till more activated, find the lit totem, get rid of noed and then rescue ur boy and gtfo
---
mb 800 karma
---
You're right. Unicorns op, please nerf Unicorns Behaviour.
---
There is no way to avoid toxic actions as the killer, since by definition everything you do is considered toxic. For me personally, i take a very simple approach to the game at this point. I just kill whom ever i can, and that is that.
---
&lt;3
---
I think wake up (let‚Äôs you see exit gates 128m away and let‚Äôs you open them 5/10/15% faster) is his best perk but others think his best perk is pharmacy (let‚Äôs you search chest faster and is softer also the first chest will be a green med kit) but vigil is useless so 2/3 mediocre perks
---
Not with swf
---
Bans happen all the time, but hate speech is much lower on the list than hacking
---
When I first started playing I thought this was a perk lmao
---
Then I have no clue :(
---
That's exploiting.
---
Thanks, I am fairly new-ish, rank 11 killer and I‚Äôm just trying to get some of the better teachables the now
---
Man I've seen red ranks ignore totems cause their scared of it being a haunted grounds lmao
---
I'm curious about why they removed the success zone penalty in Selfcare and Saboteur but not in Spine Chill.
---
Thanks so much I didn‚Äôt know this.
---
I bring moris every game now...fuck these toxic kids...tried to be nice and bring cakes and BPS and they act even more toxic...so fuck all the survivors
---
Doctor power isn't consistent or fast enough for that. They usually just keep running the loop while you slow yourself to charge the power.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve played survivor and been camped and of course I don‚Äôt enjoy it, but that‚Äôs not the killers problem. They‚Äôre trying to win and so am I, and if I get caught well I have to be prepared to get camped
---
Oh no, I might die in a game about survivors dying. Better disconnect instead of getting better.
---
I don't know what the other guy was saying, but it isn't KYF. Self care is rank 1.
---
You should have recorded it, off topic it is fucked up. But a 7 Blink no Fatigue Nurse, oh my God. I would have Loved to see that.
---
If you use WGLF then We'll Make It is good to also get heal points when unhooking, Iron Will is nice since they turned up the sounds, Balanced Landing is a personal favorite, Kindred if you solo.
---
Yeah, and a giant ax throwing toddler will happen in real life too. Maybe a twig monster cannibal will come and rip out your liver in real life. Its a game there will be game physics in play.
---
Imagine being this bad that you ruin 4 other people's games by disconnecting.

Doesn't change that survivors have a lot of second chance perks and NOeD can be countered before it even spawns. Before I played killer I played only survivor and I used to think that NOeD was too much of a crutch, now that I play both not anymore, yeah maybe it's hard to play against when you find out the killer has it and the endgame started, but finding the totem or break all of them before all gens are done doesn't seem too hard. I don't play NOeD on killers that I have decent builds for, because I feel like it is a crutch, but the few times I used it people cleansed all the totems or found it in a matter of seconds(when I started playing killer we are talking from rank 18 to rank 12). Also if I down you with our without NOeD in front of the opened exit gates and I know you played well I'm letting you go. I'm not one of those people who needs their kill at all costs, so I'm probably gonna let you go. Also I'm sorry for the paragraph, just wanted to make things clear, everyone has his own opinions üòä.
---
Right on the start of the match too. That's just horrible all around
---
This is beautiful. Thank you for sharing &lt;3
---
Sauce
---
Damn this is a real paragraph don't worry if you don't want to read it.
---
and I even managed to stay standing for 2 minutes and get 2 off the hook haha, but yea I normally don't record so it took too long to pull up obs.. then I thought meh what's the chance I get two cheaters..
---
STBFL stonks &gt; anything else
---
You haven‚Äôt played a good doctor
---
I had it happen yesterday. I was killer and they opened the gate and I blinked right on the Nea and smacked her as she was leaving the gate. She just got stuck and couldn't move. Then I find her and smack her, but every time I try to pick her up she fell out until she wiggled out.
---
After that I couldn't hit, grab, shw couldn't leave through hatch or exit. I tried to get her to enter a locker to try to snatch her out of it but she couldn't interact with anything.
---
Of course, I didn't wanna leave because I gave a cake offering and got a 2k already... I felt bad about it but the Nea eventually ended up leaving the game.
---
Very annoying glitch.
---
Way to back yourself into a corner there, buddy.
---
I feel so sorry for the killers during that version.
---
Just practice your killer and get better. Don't blame the game because you can't figure out how to improve.
---
I meant Plague in my first comment, my bad.
---
It's surprisingly difficult to keep count while also trying to help teammates repair gens and escape from the killer. And someone else might do some and you might lose count.
---
I don't think the game needs a bunch of band-aid fixes. A lot of loops are fine, some are annoying but just slowing down survivors is just plain unfair.
---
I suppose. Normally no teammates do totems unless they are lit
---
Bond or pharmacy
---
LETS GO DICK FACE! I Mean Ghost FaCe!
---
I definitely agree. NOED could very well need to be a time based perk. Or that it only stays active until the gates are opened.
---

SWF is a hard concept to grasp.
---
So greedy!  Selling new content for what‚Äôs considered, by many, to be relatively cheap.  Continuing support of a game that‚Äôs over three years old, and very open with their consumers with a clear road path of the future. 
---
They‚Äôre so greedy, they even let you unlock most outfits and chapter packs by just playing the game. Nuts!
---
[WHAT ARE YA DOIN IN MY SWAMP!?](/intensifies)
---
Cleansing all the totems is not easy or ideal with randoms. I do agree with the idea if it's swf though
---
Who do you think puts new palettes back in after every match?? The entity? The killers???
---
I hate people that Urban evade around the map
---
LMAO SOO TRUE DISTORTION SUCKS XDDDDDDD
---
Thats the most disgusting thing ive ever seen either. Who still uses camcorders for their lps.
---
  help 2 other people escape, but when 3 of us when though I wasn't allowed to escape. I was bound to this realm for entity to kill me.( Worst is that I had purple Tool Kit )
---
I had someone hold the game hostage doing this while I was hillbilly for ritual. He was killed by entity before me made it back to the exit
---
The same one you use for vaulting/breaking, usually space
---
Mori a survivor as doctor. Chase survivors for 3 minutes as doctor. As docyor, use your electric blast on survivors 4 times.  
---
Yeah.
---
I really like the idea and it would be nice but balance wise I don't think it's great
---
I never said that, but I don't care how many survivor vors escaped, 1 or all of them, it matters if we had fun. Once a guy DC'ed asa the game started. I said "oh well, who cares" and I let the other survivors do the generators, no hooks or anything, I wanted it to be fair for them and I took the depip. I'll give the last one the hatch or let him open the exit gates, or if all the survivors are struggling through the whole match I'll start farming after getting at least a kill. I know how it feels to play as survivor, because I started playing as a baby Dwight and I know how it doesn't feel nice to be camped, tunneled, or have an unfair and unfunny game. That's why everytime I play killer and I'm doing good I ask myself "is everyone having fun?" "I'm going to patrol the gens on the other side of the map so they can unhook". But if the survivors were playing good in going for the 4k because I know they won't feel bad, and I don't care if the last one gets hatch. I was playing as Legion and at the end of the game (3 kills and one escape through hatch) one guy messaged me and greeted with me because I didn't camp or tunnel, I explained to him that I just wanted everyone to have fun, there's no point in ruining other player's game.
---
Pretty fun when you learn to loop
---
Congratulations! Did you get Adept?
---
And a yellow banana weapon skin if you own the Pirate Legion set
---
The team i used to play with called out every totem we did as a number. Itvwas very useful and we often refused to do the last gen until we found it
---
You should play whoever you want to play but just be aware that picking weaker killers will make you more vulnerable to defeat. I think the fun&gt;winning mindset helps here
---
Do i really have to put the /s
---
Ah thx it should be r1 for me then
---
I am inevitable
---
Also why should I not go for the 4k or 3k if that's literally my objective. I'll give hatch when I feel like I'm giving hatch, I'm not following any rules.
---
I have had that EXACT same situation when playing nurse. Its great to see how salty survivors get. My typical reply if they cry about it to much is, "Yes, keep crying, your tears sustain me."
---
Iridescent King becomes a slightly better version of your proposed Carter's Journal. Also, Broken Knight turns the doctor into the Hag. This addon becomes broken so that's out. Also, you have too much going on for a killer in a game that has yet to add dedicated servers.
---
The Doctor hallucinations chase you for a bit then disappear?
---
The Doctor will twitch and appear to move erratically to confuse survivors?
---
Doctor hallucinations would appear from around a corner?
---
Addon Scrapped Tape creating a wall of static? 
---
These are bugs just waiting to happen. Scrap these ideas because this game is developed using a "How to Code For Dummies" manual.
---
Also, Cracked Electrode would be considered broken as it removes a sense of timing or aim from building survivor madness.
---
You *way* overcomplicated this. This killer would be permanently disabled since certain addons make him wildly overpowered, the rest would be pathetically weak, and the results of madness would crash the game.
---
i haven't got that yet tbh i wish i do cuz im close to red ranks
---
Nahhh that killer must be new lol
---
It's pretty redundant since you can remove your terror radius entirely
---
I see I am not alone. Momma Huntress UwU
---
Freddy should only buffed as long as you can see him outside of dream world.
---
Having just an audio cue without having an indication of where he is, depending on the buffs, can be huge.
---
That‚Äôs how it works. Whether you fix bugs or add new things you will create bugs. Of course if they fixed bugs there may be less. But fixing a bug could cause a problem.
---
I was so hoping we would only get 2 chapters this year and bug fixes. But alas no.
---
Uhm... kittens?  
---
I don't know.
---
I checked, that person didn't have either of them added. I've been getting rank 20 teammates like every game. Even when I was in a 3 man. But okay, it's SWF, not bad matchmaking. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I couldn't transfer the video file to my phone from my ps4 for some reason so I had to record it.

How are they holding the game hostage if they literally cannot escape?
---
Her: my parents aren‚Äôt home 
---
Me:
---
That‚Äôs a really detailed and well-written explanation about NOED as well as hex and dull totems. Good job!
---
they hate everyone as well
---
No, because none of what you put is applicable at all, with or without /s.
---
if they are greedy than im ea levels of greed
---
Borrowed time. No one uses it because it doesn‚Äôt actually benefit them directly. It‚Äôs one of the best perks in the game.
---
i don‚Äôt think they care  about bait if they‚Äôre camping pre endgame at that point theyre just sweaty and mad lol
---
Nowhere near what it used to be. The game is more balanced now than ever before.
---
And how fuck am i supposed to know that?
---
And she escaped. So ill ask again, what exactly is the problem here?
---
But it's still unbalanced
---
The original NOED activated when atleast 1 gate was opened and had no time limit.
---
Talk about pallet town
---
The rarity of ultra rares is unaffected by the increase through prestiging.
---
I think it's one of those things where you either have it by now or you don't. Like, for me and everyone else that has it, it happens EVERY SINGLE GAME.
---
And the movement speed was always there.
---
i love then they are pretty i collected 156 of them :)
---
Additional Bloodpoints are always a bargaining chip. I know it doesn't grant them post-game but still counts
---
This?.....
---
I just want Sinister
---
I was gonna complain about another low effort tier list because I assumed it wasnt possible to fuck it up. But you did it mad man, you fucked it up.
---
Sorry for the roast.
---
yea I am a dick. sorry for giving you advice
---
he is rated to be one of the best killers in the game. He is arguably the strongest 115% movement speed killer in the game. 
---
He is very strong because his chainsaw provides him two things. A reliable instant-down against survivors and map pressure. 
---
His chainsaw can allow him to travel very quickly around the map and apply pressure to survivors constantly by catching up to them from far distances. The chainsaw also allows him to instantly down a survivor to end chases quickly. 
---
He is also very fun to use. The ability to travel really fast through the map can be quite fun, especially if you use his turning add-ons that allow you to turn tighter corners.
---
#W A N K E R
---
I‚Äôve noticed after prestiging that I see ultra rares more frequently than before.
---
Mate if you missed the point any harder it'd leave the same bruises your parents used to.
---
I pick "or", the center option
---
I think it just depends on your playstyle. If you are looking for a more aggressive chase build, I would agree the Enduring SF would be a good one. It‚Äôs really the best build if you plan on going through pallets.
---
Personally I‚Äôm running BBQ/Ruin/Discordance/Enduring. Disco is really nice on GF if you are looking to get the stalk. It really gives you an advantage *knowing* survivors are at the gen. So you can take your time and be a sneaky boy.
---
Not a dick for giving advice, you‚Äôre a dick for being condescending and complaining about internet points.
---
Why do you say that? I honestly think you need to just stop complaining and get better.
---
If you have to resort to camping you didn't "win" anything.  Rank 20 babystrat man that takes zero skill to do, literally any player can do it regardless of 2k hours in or 2 minutes in.
---
What would be cool is a new killer who could disguise as a survivor
---
Because it is highlighted lmao
---
Someone revealed the exact numbers of what is increased, and ultra rares are untouched.
---
I love your shirt, plz don't delete!
---
You'd think the FuCkInG tExT fOrMaT wOuLd GiVe It AwAy
---
Yeah, so this post isn't really about NOED. It's more about both sides using the strongest stuff at their disposal. 
---
Also, this guy faced red/purple rank survivors, so he kind of knows how coordinated survivors work. You know, players who know how to loop and actually work on gens and rescue teammates. And in a SWF. So yeah. Pretty much got a first hand account of how coordinated survivors work. Not sure why people are flaming him for facing green rank survivors.  In a SWF. With a Red and Purple ranked pair of survivors. As a green rank killer. 
---
Also, the moris basically just sit in most killers' inventories since they want to see a game through and not get 3 DC's. If syringes had to sit in survivor inventories or killers DC, there'd be a massive uproar from the survivors. 
---
Still doesn't change the fact that this post has nothing to do with NOED. Like, at all. That does bother me, just a touch.
---
I made some one rage quit first game ive ever played with the Hillbilly lmao.
---
HAT!!!!:)
---
Gotcha. So........
---
2 kill game. Player escaped and is complaning about......?
---
Still dont understand what this post is whineing about?
---
Bugs aside, this is still an idea, and I am going to credit the devs a little bit, even though they may not deserve it. How and what is broken? Please elaborate.
---
As for Cracked Electrode, that is the reason it is Very Rare, as well as it is only a 20 meter range. Don‚Äôt forget that you lose the ability to properly time your shocks to stop loops.
---
The reason these changes exist is that against experienced survivors, doctor has no tools to help him during chases, which is about 85 percent of the game. These changes give him chase pressure and allow him to do what he is supposed to do: allow him to mess with survivors. Keep in mind I also made it so survivors can revert madness levels.
---
I didn't say I was a good player :D
---
It wouldn't be so hard if survivors didn't DC on for the dumbest reasons.
---
Prestige 3 Ash Williams‚Äô
---
So there's two other ways you could look at winning as killer other than getting a 4K. Bloodpoint gain and the emblem system.
---
Bloodpoints are interesting to judge because certain killers get away more than other killers even with way less work and skill. You could play nurse and ping pong around the map and keep hooking survivors and not miss a beat but you will lose against a doctor who is just shocking people and then getting a few hooks for bbq.
---
The killer and survivors could also farm which I don't see it much as a game but a party, just two sides trying to get as much blood as possible.
---
As for the emblem system I personally think it's pretty flawed but I'll get into that. So there is four categories. Gatekeeper, devout, malicious, and chaser.
---
Problem is most killers can't do all of these things reasonably. That's why I mentioned they need map pressure otherwise they can't get people off gens and chase potential so they don't waste to much time in a chase. Other things can help like stealth and slowing down the game but most of the time that isn't enough.
---
For killers with no map pressure how can they get gatekeeper when they can't force people off gens. Obviously there is ruin but it's unreliable and good survivors can breeze through it. And since the killer doesn't have map pressure that means a game can be done quickly if survivors spread out meaning they can't use their stealth or strong chase potential since the game is already done. I love playing ghostface but if the survivors spread out and hammer through gens you don't get to use his power much.
---
For people who don't have good chase potential they lose points in all categories. Since you can only chase one person at a time and if that person can loop well you could be in a 30 second chase or which lowers your points so you either leave them and they heal lowering your points more or you keep going and hope the other survivors don't have things to blaze through the gens.
---
BUT I don't think they all need both chase and map pressure. They need to be properly compensated in another way.
---
For what makes a win for me is when is when I outplay the survivors. I was useing kills as way to judge that because if you outplay a survivor you should get some sort of reward like a hook on them. 
---
The problem is there are killers out there who can't do anything in certain situations. Like leatherface. He seems really strong at low ranks but at high ranks he can't do much. Why, because he relies on the survivor to make a mistake and then he capitalizes off of it with an insta down (or two if it's an unsafe unhook) otherwise he us pure m1. 
---
I know I mentioned he has a build that makes him decent but just because a killer has 1-2 builds they can use at higher ranks doesn't mean they are balanced. Hell leatherfaces build that let's him down people doesn't relie on his skill but bugs and cheese tactics (cheese tactics in my opinion are tactics or builds that rely on the opposition on never dealing with it before and not knowing how it works.
---
The build is play with your food (which is bugged so when you down the obsession in one hit you lose a token like regular but you gain one as well since you "lost" the survivor), furtive chase (when someone unhookes anyone they become the obsession instead of them unhooking the obsession.), and two other perks. Also side note they may have recently patched this. (If not this can way better on hillbilly and if you add make your choice it's good on almost everyone.) 
---
A killer needs a semi high skill cap and a semi low skill floor. Almost all killers who are best at low rank can't do much at high rank because there is not much they can do in general they just can do one thing well or they have to capitalize off a survivors mistake instead of being able to out play a survivor.
---
So to me I don't like killers who can't do anything even if I change my playstyle unless I use a cheese build.
---
And I can play killers other than m1. I play hag if I want to pip. You can't play her like a regular killer but even though you can't m1 she is very effective at making map pressure and slowing the game down even without perks. 
---
If a killer needs certain perks or addons to be effective against decent survivors who don't have perks or items then they probably are not a good killer because nearly every killer if not every killer can be good if you exploit a trait of theirs.
---
So in conclusion are kills the deciding factor if a killer is good or not. No it isn't but it can help judge if you are doing well as that killer. What matter is if the killer can actually be the power role and outplay the survivors instead of just not being able to do anything if those survivors do a certain tactic.
---
Also certain killers do better and worse against swf. A swf group can say if ghost face is coming to a certain area and maybe even break him out of stealth (this isn't including perks otherwise GH is extremely countered by swf compared to others.)
---
While a swf group can warn that a hillbilly is coming toward them, hillbilly is fast enough for that group to even react.
---
A legion is way weaker than other killers vs swf since they can say it's a legion to each other and communicate so they are never to close to each other. 
---
The clown does have a problem against swf it's no where near some other killers. Since he doesn't rely on stealth or survivors doing something specific. All they can do is warn each other.
---
And that's about it.
---
Man, I remember before they made the one shot part of all three levels it had attack cooldown properties, then lost them when noed was "buffed" to have the one shot at all tiers.
---
You haven't played good survivors. Safe pallets are still safe pallets against doc unless you get too greedy. Unsafe pallets are just less safe.
---
Toxic Perks - Any perk that is not absolutely useless.
---
spirit is DUMMY THICC?
---
Or the other survivors killed them by not going for the save
---
This is a great idea. Other games and media have used Jack, and he was scary in all of those times.
---
I'm a dick in general
---
I'm the person who sent him the message
---
I think thered be less salt too if the nori only worked when survivors are death hook, I've only really seen survivors get tilted if they get killed immediately after their first hook
---
No, but a bunch of survivor mains in the comments are.
---
Jack the Ripper was used in the games Assassin‚Äôs Creed Syndicate(widely popular franchise) and even in Identity V. It went amazingly well for them. He was even featured as a villain in an animated Batman movie called "Gotham by Gaslight." No reason why DBD can‚Äôt do the same. The actual killer has been dead for 100+ years and so have the victims. You play an M rated game with all kinds of twisted fictional killers. One killer who's long dead and existed at one point in history would be awesome.
---
Who?
---
Then what's the point in having the TR on the whole map
---
That's me ridiculing it from both sides.  I'm a quite experienced killer and honestly campers annoy me because they just make us all look like no skill dickheads.
---
Both sides were playing the game how it's meant to be played.
---
Or it is glitched and literally won't work along with not healing yourself and no escaping thru the opened gates.
---
thats why you dont join games unless it‚Äôs green ping!!! /s
---
I mean as a killer main I kind of agree. The perk maybe could use a slight Nerf or a change.
---
Your name should have been Goomba.
---
If it way easy it wouldnt be an achievement. Just play the game, you dont need the game to hold your hand.
---
This, more or less. 
---
The effect you see on your screen from being a stealthy killer or on the hook, strangely enough, are not just filters applied to your screen but actual objects in the game.
---
Thanks for bringing the cracked electrode issue to my attention. Haven‚Äôt thought about that. As for the other addons, I will have to check and change the electrodes and the way they work.
---
Nothing better than a prestige 3 meg DCing as soon as I pick her up in the first 3 minutes of the game 
---
Why do people do this
---
lol Spirit. AAA aaaa AAa a aa aa A A A A A A A AA AAAAA aaaa  a a earrape.
---
Dead Hard/Borrowed Time/WGLF/DS is my casual build. This is just for farming BPs, it‚Äôs not what I‚Äôd run against a killer I knew was good. But I dont know man, there‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúbest‚Äù build. It just depends on how you want to play. Survivors have a bunch of decent perks that compliment different styles of play.
---
Thefuck?
---
Nope the endgame counted down, the usual sound of Entity snatching the unfortunate soul who didn't get away in time played but nothing happened to Nea, she was just standing beside me. I led her to the hatch, gate.. we tried pretty much everything but she just could not interact with anything at all.
---
it doesnt matter, you can get every perk on everyone eventually, but claudette is nice for early self care
---
gg dude
---
Every time im in the damn corn
---
O yeah well I can jump over pallets
---
Eh. One time I played bubba and almost all the survivors DC‚Äôd the moment I got a chainsaw on them. 
---
I love the game but the community needs to stop reaching for that salt shaker.
---
If a rank 15 getting paired with ranks 4 and 5 is balanced to you you'll have to check your definitions. And the outcome of the match has nothing to do with matchmaking, what are you talking about?
---
Please, save your edgy speech for yourself, this is just another overused low effort matchmaking shitpost, dont get why its such a big deal. I even downvoted it but you pathetically failing at being a smartass baited me. Bad from me I guess.
---
Why wouldn't you wanna burn them tho? Save them for...? Am I missing something here?
---
Her voice is so annoying
---
?  Curious to your point here.  Are you saying all killers should run noed and all survivors should run instaheals lol?  There are those of us that perform the roles without the help like that.  Regardless I was merely pointing out the hypocrisy in op's complaint about the survivors and their choice of what to run when their side isn't exactly innocent here either lol.
---
To spook new players
---
"The game was overtly broken years ago, that means that now that small changes have started t happen after all this time, you should be stomping every game"
---
To a Nurse like myself....this looks like a fun time.
---
yes
---
I agree with a lot of what you say, but that‚Äôs just the thing. All killers are not designed equally for a purpose. All killers may not perform well in all situations for a purpose. The game is an asymmetrical PvP, and you‚Äôre not intended to ‚Äúwin‚Äù every single time you play, nor are you intended to select any killer and play them like you would play another killer. Killers abilities have to vary in strength and application, otherwise there wouldn‚Äôt be much of a point in providing different abilities. If every killer did the same thing, they‚Äôd be just like survivors: only skins after teachables were obtained. Some killers take more time to learn and have a way steeper learning curve, but I do believe most killers can be viable in most situations. 
---
Another thing people forget is that you should just be playing for fun. Some killers are way more fun than others, regardless of their viability. Personally, I think a ranking system in a game like this is very stupid, especially one that works the way this one does. Additionally, the matchmaking system doesn‚Äôt even work well anyway, so many people give up before they get a chance to really learn. If they improved the ranking system somehow, maybe it would be a different story, but there are too many outside factors completely irrelevant to your own skill that can completely change how well you do. There‚Äôs a lot of RNG in the game that can‚Äôt be completely controlled, and in many ways, it can completely hinder gameplay.

The two climates are vastly different.  I understand the goof on survivor mentality vs killers, but when mocking something from three years ago with select survivors cries of recent times, it doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Even if he goes meta and mocks killers mocking survivors who mock killers, it falls extremely flat due the subject being irrelevant.
---
Personally I use ruin, monitor and abuse, make your choice and bbq.
---
Use it sooner.
---
It can be especially if you can keep a survivor in the dream world. The problem with Freddy is most survivors use Adrenaline which absolutely fucks Freddy. So, against decent survivors who will likely use adrenaline, no Remember Me is worthless. Those extra few seconds will only help you in a few situational scenarios, kind of like Blood Warden. You‚Äôd be better off running Sloppy Butcher IMO.
---
Lol thanks. Yeah I need a lot more cabin in the woods in my dbd. I‚Äôll take Marty and some of those killers too. When you think about it that movie is so much like dbd to begin with anyway. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it influenced dbd.
---
These.

Speaking of Zubat dealing with nurses, here's the part in his stream yesterday where I apparently played nurse so well that it made him give up on hook: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/445528892?t=02h50m43s
---
Errrmmm... what? Are you saying Killers should never have a chance against them?
---
I think you just can't handle those players.
---
Killer probably thought he was god tier.
---
Depends more on the player nowadays. Few years ago killer was a joke.
---
Would that be fore or after maniac cop? with a police uniform for ash
---
I noticed after 3.0 update that it appears to possibly be glitched.  Several times the exhausted status displayed several seconds after I had already used it.

Sometimes memes can be extraneous. Of all people, I figured you‚Äôd be hip to this.

Hello brethren nice to see you all here
---
Yup
---
Dammit, 3 hours late
---
I switch between killer and survivor regularly and honestly I feel camping gets misinterpreted a lot. When I‚Äôm the killer and you run up and pull someone off the hook while I am still there and don‚Äôt even give me a second to leave, of course I‚Äôm going to chase you. I‚Äôm probably going to knock down the hooked player again first depending who‚Äôs closer, and then I‚Äôm going to go for you and that‚Äôs not on me, but the survivor who didn‚Äôt think it through. More often than not I get called a camper by someone who unhooked someone while I was doing something nearby like breaking a gen.
---
Ty guys gotta try them all
---
Lmaooo definitely gonna use it
---
Perk: coffebong hides aura from killer when proxied. Can see one other survivors aura. Aura is hidden from all other survivors.
---
There‚Äôs no way that you sacrifice four people and don‚Äôt safety
---
Most people will see that as toxic because the person had no choice in being unhooked and essentially got farmed with no chance of getting away.  
---
Some killers go after the farmer, others dont. It's up to you how to play in the end but some people see it as a shitty thing to do. 
---
I have over 900 hours in game and I'd, personally,  rather punish the person who farmed in front of me than go after the person with no chance. I dont let them survive in the end (if caught again), but I give them a chance to at least escape. It makes the game fun for everyone except well the farmer that I will tunnel and kill.
---
I've been a grumpy person the last few weeks. 
---
But still going to my point of &gt;didn't understand or didn't enjoy
---
Perfect genetics
---
This is why I don't run NOED. As a killer main, I can see that it's fucking scummy and honestly it really doesn't have a place in DbD
---
That sucks!
---
I honestly miss this. I understand why it's gone, though.
---
He is being upvoted, and you‚Äôre being spoonfed negative karma. No one agrees with you. And everyone can spot bullshit. Just go away.
---
You are literally brain dead. People can put any perks they want on survivors. So go ahead, ban Dwight. I'll play Meg with the exact same perk build. This isn't fair to killers. If you take half my BP because you're a coward, that's backwards. *You* should lose half your BP if you choose to ban a killer. That'd be way more balanced.
---
The good old Dark Times.

Can we get the format for the memelords among us good sir
---
Charlie Manson be like
---
Some killers are l, yes and that means the player needs to be very good, lucky or be facing some really bad survivors. 
---
With that said killer in general is fun to play and you're not out of a match unless you play yourself out of a match.
---
Of course agaisnt a sweaty swf group with skill it might not matter just how good you are.   Only a couple setups can really make easy work of that and even then it's really up to the player.
---
Damn you had the Combo,I only had the gate opened with Jeff.
---
Needs an unusual variant
---
Hello there
---
Not really tbh. You got everything down pretty well to me. But I'm just a sucker for a historical figure like Jack in one of my favorite games. He'd fit perfectly.
---
I hope your weekend turns everything around and you get to play in a puppy pit or something. Honestly. 
---
I‚Äôm done here though, this has gone on for too long for me, over nothing, and we‚Äôd end up talking in circles about the validity of certain memes, etc.. We‚Äôd be distracting more from OP‚Äôs post.  Enjoy the weekend!

Or worse, the ones who stay until they are for sure dead, and DC simply in spite of the killer (killer gets less BP) and also they keep that purple flashlight with max addons

1. You have to properly try hard as killer so people call them weak.
---
2. Most killers power doesn‚Äôt help them in chase so a good survivor will abuse that 
---
3. Every survivor below rank 13 is a sweat now so yeet
---
Just git gud, you lost because you're not gud
---
- Topdecking discord using trash tier Survivor mains
---
Wait really? Is this a thing? Left behind is always active?
---
That's my point, I have seen maybe 1 other cake burned this whole event, and I'm rank 12-9 so it's not like it's just new people who haven't gotten any, I've burned about 12ish (they aren't that common. I'll give that)
---
I see Tapps way less often. Maybe that will change after his cosmetics hit tho.
---
So that‚Äôs where they get em from...
---
I would have rather had Pennywise but with The Clown it doesn't seem likely. (Plus the movies are pretty current so I would think it would be crazy expensive to license).
---
Wait, does this mean Distressing and M&amp;A are no longer useful with legion?
---
I will agree with you there, the times I do play survivor it maybe appears every 4 bloodwebs, which at rank 50 is a total bitch
---
People who say just get good to people talking about how killers are underpowered are rank 1 entitled survivors who want you to stop playing the game so they can win
---
Claudette urban evasions around replacing them for the others
---
You‚Äôd be surprised by how many of these one hit killers who run noed (myers leatherbooty billy and ghostface)
---
Survivors: The game is killer favored and always has been!!!!
---
*LITERALLY* Me every single time I see that braindeadass claim on this sub: This right here.
---
Hmm
---
Then killers shouldnt be able to enter the exit at all
---
If you‚Äôre in SwF, not solo q, simply isn‚Äôt possible, you don‚Äôt get ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù teams in solo q
---
Surviver mains: *HEAVY BREATHING*
---
You can P3 your survivors without getting a bunch of terrible perks.  I leveled up Jake without Saboteur specifically so I wouldn't get it in other bloodwebs.
---
What I found out is that you gotta tunnel and slug against SWF groups
---
Hopefully they learn from this, new players have so much BP to earn and its usually 1 or 2 cakes around rank 10.
---
I play at low red ranks and I don't think the killers are in as bad a spot as people say. I think Clown, Bubba, and Wraith need something to change because they often feel frustrating when I play them.
---
I'll level with you chief this is like the third time I've posted something to the effect of "totems need a counter" meaning exactly what you're thinking but the people that expose themselves as being small brained every single time really drives me to never clarify that I really do mean just a UI element.
---
You could loop a killer for days in there. DAYS!
---
Will they remain if I prestige a character, or are they treated as any other item?
---
Same here! I've been trying to think up a little custom original 'chapter' for it, and the killer would be some like, undead ghost pirate guy lol. I don't have a power made for him, but one of his perks would be called 'Another Man's Treasure', and it would either be like Plague's 'Corrupt Intervention' where the further chests would be blocked off for however amount of time at the start of the match, or instead he'd get a notification if someone has opened a chest in however amount of meters near him. For the survivor, idk yet, but I think it was a dude lol.
---
Yes, and no.
---
Nurse is powerful, She actually controls the game, which is something many people think the killer should do.
---
Billy and Spirit are what the rest of the killers should aspire to be.
---
The rest are underpowered, there is no way to deny this, else people would be playing them in high ranks.
---
What a waste of one to just leave like that, i mean might as well collect whatever bonus points you can before you get rekt into next week.
---
Judging by your galaxy perks, does it matter? 
---
If you hacked the game and you get bugs, you‚Äôll never know if they‚Äôre legit bugs or new ones caused by hacking the game.
---
Anyway, it looks like the entity trying to spawn randomly.
---
I never hurt anyone, it is the performance that kills
---
All they need to do is make him slower
---
I was in it and haven't received anything as of yet, I'll let you know when I get something though. Personally, my money is on Auric Cells.
---
I don't even know what tokens are
---
Dude Battlefront 2 is such a dope fuckin game right now. Got it discounted, feels like I just committed robbery with how much content there is now.
---
Talking mad shit for someone in Frenzy distance
---
Totally!! Let me just end Feral Frenzy real quick and DS myself back into an M1 killer while they run to a loop! Seriously, the FF stun is only 1 second shorter than DS. To go back to being an M1 killer.
---
Jeff and Quentin are probably the least popular in my experience. Oddly, I haven't seen a lot of Jake's recently, or Adam's.
---
If you got a survivor that's still not leveled. A lot pop up till like level 30 I wanna say.
---
Note: I did buy dead hard from the shrine.
---
The entire 2 week ptb is probably the biggest problem about new content. They are scared to delay shit when it's too bugged because everyone will bitch but at the same time everyone bitches because of bugs. 2 weeks is a silly time frame to me

3 Claudette‚Äôs hiding in front of you: 
---
Allow us to introduce ourselves
---
I have never competed a single daily challenge
---
Hag Mori once (I don‚Äôt play hag)
---
I forget the other two but I remember them being hella long grinds I refuse to do
---
And fair game balancing is expected. Don‚Äôt know why people always bring up real life like it has shit to do with proper balancing
---
Best killer in the game, both survivors and killers like him (of course alway are exceptions)
---
Must be difficult
---
I keep getting a ‚ÄòAn error has occured and your rank has not been updated‚Äô on all of my survivor games and its getting annoying
---
Indeed
---
well it should have been nancy thompson who was the survivor for the nightmare chapter 
---
so thats why i dont like him
---
#The grind is REAL!
---
It depends on your playstyle. 
---
M&amp;A lets you get the jump on someone a little easier while Distressing nets you easier points or pushes overly-cautious survivors to waste more time.
---
Which one do you think you're going to buy
---
For real?
---
That‚Äôs pretty much all
---
I‚Äôm assuming you guys just farmed? ü§®
---
I love her locker animation.
---
My friends did the same just once so we could get the 4 people 1 hatch achievement
---
Treated as such. When you prestige its a clean slate. I did the mistake of prestiging my Ace when I had 10 cakes on him
---
The bagman has a axe and didnt seem to run like a athlete. Essentially any killer that runs with a knife is legion?
---
Swf pretty clearly with someone else

Haven't looked yet. What would you get?
---
Jigsaw plays dubs? And he‚Äôs alive.
---
True and original Freddy :/
---
Tapps getting cosmetics too?
---
He probably is alongside Tapp and Jeff
---
You keep add ons if you disconnect? That's stupid.
---
I love all the little details you put into this like on her face and her mask. Personally it's one of the best artworks I've seen of Bunny Mom.
---
I play the most annoying killer and people keep DCing. Feel bad for me
---
1. The rank 20 wasn't friended with any of them.
---
2. Even if they were playing SWF without being friends, I get rank 20's while in 3 person SWF.
---
Matchmaking is super fucked right now.
---
Call me Ishmael.
---
Changing perk icons isnt hacking lol
---
Spaghetti code that‚Äôs only been held together by the collective prayers of the coders
---
There's a method to it, way to easy to do. You used to be able to just dc like normal and keep items.
---
You‚Äôre delusional if you think a ranged attack is weaker than being injured against an m1 killer
---
As a killer I rather take ego cakes.
---
Will use Gateaus when there's a double BP event again.
---
* As a survivor: Welp... around 40 webs: less than 15 Gateaus...
---
* As a killer: I have around 200+ Gateaus...
---
* Plot twist: I'm survivor main...
---
I actually thought Legion was an homage to Strangers when I first saw them honestly. 
---
Normal human serial killer team that wear masks.  I don't really see the difference.
---
*complains about matchmaking*
---
*lowest rank escapes and finishes 2nd on survivor leaderboard*
---
Jigsaw was naughty and went against that went he slit Tapps throat in Saw 1 :c
---
Honestly I'm not sure I was thinking about either one of the spirit skins or a really good outfit for one of my survivors
---
play r6s or overwatch or league of legends or cod alll of them are toxic to nuclear wasteland degree its in humans dna
---
How does anybody play nurse blink and stand there for 6 secs and completely lose the target
---
Blood lodge 2019 colorized
---
Thanks for helping me realize what I did there
---
Pathetic af damn
---
There must be bottles of these pills full to the top cos no one ever swallows them xD
---
Depends on the group and what they run with.
---
Altruistic swf groups are easy/frustrating.   I mean I don't even get the first person on the hook before they bum rush me.  
---
At least let me walk away from the hook before you call me a camper lol!  I mean I'm the Hag for fucks sake!  Of course I'm hooking and leaving!  I got traps to put down mang!
---
And then there's Nerfed Legion, he vault pallets in slow motion and then gets an asthma attack or get double stunt for getting hit by a pallet. F
---
A lot of survivors still think NOED is overpowered when it's the same thing as any hex perk except you need to break all totems and even then. A lot of killers use ruin and not NOED
---
Repost
---
A logical thought process would be to aim for the weakened one, as long as you have nothing to lose from letting the other go. It‚Äôs how certain packs of carnivores deal with herds of prey, go for the weakest.
---
*so of course I will hunt you down to the ends of the earth if I can see you and continue to chase you, wounded survivor, you can blame your far too altruistic buddies for rescuing you when I was nearby*
---
For like the fourth time as well.
---
I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt use moonlight in private match when they‚Äôre literally in the inventory
---
I‚Äôm saving them for the next double bloodpoints event.
---
Can be with spine chill.
---
Agreed.
---
Why don't your drawers close all the way?
---
If only i didn't get nurse challenges everyday on console...
---
Well done.
---
E
---
They won't expire, so you should horde them on your favourite killers.
---
Nea is bugged since day one, she's the only killer that nobody can pallet stun and she starts on the survivor lobby side... maybe you should try another killer. xD
---
Tunnel man, take my hand
---
People are toxic when I go to the supermarket  ... 
---
Short answer?  A very large portion of the human race sucks and the human race is overpopulated.
---
Are you weak during this? I prioritize the weak, one hittable runt and not the undamaged man attempting to taunt me into a chase from nearby... unless chasing them results in their being snagged by my bear trap in that case *C‚ÄôMERE*
---
(Reminder that carnivores that hunt in packs do this to herds of larger prey... except the taunting and bear trap bit)
---
The gate is open and objectives are done for survivors unless they are attempting to unhook. Teabagging and sitting an inch from the gate is not showing skill or an objective and unnecessary. There should be no reason to be downed that close to the gate unless people just want to prolong the game.
---
Dude, think how much 2.0.0 added. I don‚Äôt know how we didn‚Äôt get the battle pass and/or the new ‚Äòarchives‚Äô feature. Did we even get any cosmetics?
---
Why are you saving them for the next 2xbp? I mean you don't get any extra anyway so might aswell get those bloodpoints right away.
---
It should be an easy task for Jesus.
---
You didn‚Äôt play much between Patch 3.0 and Patch 3.0.1, huh?  Quenti‚Äôs for days.
---
Well, even tho I main her, I wanted hag to be weaker. I wanted her to be less annoying and listed my proposed changes. I got downvoted. Judging by the comments it wasn't because my idea was bad, but rather that "she's not that strong, get to red ranks and then we'll let you speak"
---
The problem isn't "People keep DCing, Feel bad for me"  
---
The problem is "I can't reach high ranks to have fair matches, because this system is so broken it punishes me for doing well"
---
Considering Dead by Daylight is basically Cabin in the Woods as a video game (we pick various horror monsters/killers to hunt and kill a group of people for an ancient entity‚Äôs entertainment), I think he‚Äôs basically required at this point.
---
pretty sure her rework was on the roadmap, no speculation needed
---
Now that‚Äôs the real question
---
She‚Äôs not OP it‚Äôs just not fun playing against her or legion
---
He moves at 115%. He just feels faster because his model is smaller.
---
I learned that from watching some higher rank killers playing him, realized when I got shocked as survivor I couldn‚Äôt vault/drop pallets. It also makes doc a nasty face camper because he can stop people going for a save in an AoE not just by hitting them
---
I get that people collect moris, flashlights, firecrackers and all that stuff but why would anyone collect cakes when all it does is give you more bloodpoints. Why not just get the bloodpoints right away and collect well more cakes for example.
---
I'm one of the 5 Quentin's
---
No, I was playing pig and was still getting used to her ability so I didn't have her all three of her perks equiped
---
Yea, I get that it's the reason why people DC, but why do I derank after killing all of them because they DCd instead of killing themselves on the hook? that doesn't make ANY sense
---
A fellow hostage killer? A man of culture
---
So what are the steps for applying these? I'm in the files but I don't know how to actually change these icons üò≠
---
Freddy is the best killer
---
Theres a game in this bug
---
Well at that point it's nessessary then
---
One hit kill: 5 other killers have one hit kills too. 
---
Speed: His speed is the same as other killers. So no hes not faster. 
---
Stalking with no Terror Radius? Myers 
---
Weapon lunge is the same as other killers stupid complaint. 
---
All kills can have aura reading and his is super short. 
---
He cant run while croched hes slower then pig is. 
---
Hard to spot..ok thats fair. 
---
All killers can block with ruin. 
---
What do you mean by the last one., 
---
Looking at him does matter as he cant stalk. 
---
Your points arent really that well thought out or smart nor evn very vaild.
---
People are too worried about this being a competitive game now. They dont want scary
---
That's really neat!!
---
I haven't even played that much but have seen many cakes burned.
---
Thanks
---
\*Reading the name\* Oh, he can finally buy a good skin.
---
\*Looking at the survivor\* Oh.
---
Really there isnt much of a difference. I thought ghostface would be like a legion killer before he was announced. I guess it's on the devs to make the gameplay all different and they are doing okay so far. I think legion resembled a ghostface type character because ghostface will take off in a full sprint to chase someone in the movies.
---
And if I catch only one person doing totems their ass is getting beaten because DUUUUDE YOU‚ÄôRE GONNA BLOW MY COVER! People might actually realize I‚Äôm dogshit!
---
In my defense I‚Äôve been playing Legion a lot. With only Distressing/Thrill/BBQ/NOED and only take NOED for the memes and salt.
---
Top quality shitpost right there
---
Heh I don't play survivor much. Have meg, claudette, and bill (almost maxed). Killers I have like 6 of them at 50.
---
I‚Äôd be okay with getting rid of NOED. I never use it. My goal is to kill you all BEFORE the gates are powered, making NOED a waste of a perk slot.
---
SWF x4 with Mic, Red Ranks.. Yeah might feel like it sometimes.. But if you chase a Lithe or balanced landing, miss your hits etc, that‚Äôs just the outcome..
---
I got the achievement by playing legion for like an hour. Using an m1 build will help a lot, even if it doesn‚Äôt make the most of his ability.
---
Except for the fact you're now exhausted you have a gate to open, only 2 minutes to do it and you have no key. Oh, don't forget the best part, the killer can see both doors from standing still in one spot.
---
That's what I'm sayin! Ha!
---
I joined last month and it‚Äôs a pain in the butt to level multiple survivors to get good perks, let alone be able to level any killers at all.
---
I don't understand it either. Why? You don't have fun and you don't receive BP. Smh
---
When you play good and get a pip, game cannot believe that someone got a pip so it thinks it is fake and gives you this error
---
i dont get the point of this comment other than stroking your penis for playing Nurse
---
Lol where is this from?
---
The DCs are forced to do it as punishment.
---
Game I had once was a Billy. It was one of the MacMillen maps. I'm playing Claud, and I at least remember a Kate on the team, I'll say the other two were a Dwight and a Jake. He sprints across the map to us, since he gave the offering for us to all start together. I get downed during a chase, put on a hook. He goes away for a bit, I think nothing of it. Dwight gets me, and Billy is right over to swing on just me, even shaking his camera 'no.' Picks me right back up, re-hooked. Kate comes and gets me, and she has Borrowed Time. He is still just in front of me, not moving, until I am taken off. He swings on me, and it does the little effect, but that doesn't stop him. Kate and Dwight are even trying to take hits, but he's just M1/RT/R2'ing only me. Re-hooked, and I de-pip. Spectated for a little bit, and he was restarting the cycle he did on me, but to Kate. That was when I left, cause I'm sure he just rinsed and repeated. This was at rank like... 13-15, and I think he was just a rank 15.
---
Tbh it was a reply to a post that developed into its own post. I probably should have edited it but I was tired af.
---
Ashamed to say this was me with Laurie Strode last night rip
---
Idk I use em but im tryna look at both sides ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
All fair points. 
---
I know it's not popular and it earns no money but I'd prefer to see existing killers tweaked before any additional killers are released.
---
Tenacity isn‚Äôt voted as one of the worst perks, yet NOED is. Wow.
---
Most common for me is any of the gals, including myself. Meg's, Nea's, Claudette's, Feng's, and Kate's, oh my! Dwight and David are the most common guys I see.
---
Cheating on console lmao
---
Actually it‚Äôs Hellpriest Aka Pinhead.
---
Clive Barker the main guy behind Pinhead said his name was actually Hellpriest people just call him Pinhead because of the pins in his head. 
---
He never really cared for the name pinhead.
---
Everyone is still playing ghostface since he came out. It's  best to play survivor for a bit.
---
keyword ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù
---
Get him back in the entity NOW
---
Just letting you know, Killer lunge is faster than dead hard
---
I doubt this is real.
---
I actually watched this movie for the first time today!!
---
I remember the two windows on I think rancid? Literally infinite. It was aids.
---
Literally nobody has ever said this, and if they have then produce it now
---
Because it doesn't reward them. If a killer is tunneling, Survivors can just sit there and do the whole gens easy. If you sit there and keep trying to save the person, THATS when it rewards them. When the person rage quits, THATS when it rewards them.
---
Imagine 4 survivors with 4 irridescent gears.
---
Omfg the shitty VHS tracking got me.
---
It makes completing a gen towards the end of the game a lot safer, and it really hurts stealth killers. And a small benefit I really like is that it shows me who the killer is. If I complete a gen before I run into the killer, I at least see their aura so I know who I‚Äôm up against
---
I think I\`m seeing new Freddy rework
---
It‚Äôs a must watch for any horror fan. Another low-key movie that I would love dbd to look at for new killers is thirteen ghosts. A personal favorite of mine as a kid.
---
I have several chapters in my notes that I play with sometimes. Might post them if I think they‚Äôre fun enough ü§î
---
Rules for thee but not for me is all i‚Äôm getting from this
---
BlackMetal Jeff (me)
---
nice.
---
Oh thanks for recommending 13 Ghosts, never even heard of it. Will watch tomorrow
---
The one where they're in the studio or recording booth? That one's great!
---
i assume this is Rotten Fields, right? it tends to spawn double pallets at jungle gyms
---
This has actually happened to me when i was playing as survivor once. It was funny bc it was trapper and he trapped the pallet only to get stunned by another one in the same gym. Havent had it happen since and that was over a month ago
---
Happy cake day btw
---
Yeah with the weird walls xD
---
It isn't a strategy. It completely denies someone the chance to play the game. That isn't a strategy. That is sad
---
I assume that a lot of votes come from hipsters / memers as well as mains who are salty about certain perks on the other side. Self Care, Ruin, and Barbeque all got a single vote and I have a feeling that they were all from the same person.
---
But I didn't steal it
---
It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs unbalanced towards survivors, it‚Äôs that some maps have trouble meeting the minimum pallet number, and have to spawn in at doubles occasionally.
---
Not sure if this is a shit post or not
---
Yes it is Rotten fields
---
It does reward them. Tunnelling removes  survivors from the game quickly. The others can't sit there and do the gens if they're all dead.
---
Omg just imagine killers that say looping is op in 2019 playing this version xd
---
I mean technically he's the killer. Killing people through out smarting them is still a technique. Is it a dick move? Yes. Does it really matter that he was a dick? No.
---
Is the nurse really hot shit?
---
you can smell the men
---
Depends on the Killer sometimes too. Like, the Spirit, hell, her lunge is huge lmao. But yeah, I'm very empathetic to Survivors when I play Killer, so I try to give second chances. No tunnel, no camp, none of that garbage, but sometimes, I will swing and be like 'Damn, that shouldn't have connected bro' lol. I have hope that it will. Even with it helping against the Killer's ping, it will likely help against offerings and such being wasted from a disconnection, and etc.
---
Nobody voted for Unnerving Presence or Tinkerer for the worst perks, but NOED was.
---
Wow. Buff NOED then, I guess ...
---
I hope they cover some of this stuff in the new lexicon or whatever lore thing they're coming out with
---
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.
---
Update?
---
I'm playing on PC
---
The only reason I mori is if its swf since I cba dodging and don't want to be at a great disadvantage.
---
If they played long enough* Secondly if you were able to fucking read you‚Äôd see it‚Äôs a preference thing, You wouldn‚Äôt be matched with players that avoided you, Just everyone else.  Lastly it‚Äôs essentially been altered now, Ot would only apply to rank 10 and above
---
LMAO IS THIS TRUE?
---
Ahhh I see. Well it‚Äôs a cesspit on Xbox rn lol.
---
I think I had one in less then 20 seconds with Billy and sniping some Claudette.
---
he is saying that because survivors don‚Äôt do totems, noed works. you‚Äôre saying that as a solo survivor, because survivors don‚Äôt do totems, you shouldn‚Äôt bother with them. you are a random survivor to everyone else, so you‚Äôre talking in circles. always do totems and yes there will be matches where some are missed, but you will have a chance of stopping noed, and other survivors will see you doing totems and do them as well. your reasoning can‚Äôt be ‚Äúit‚Äôs not worth it because im doing all of them as a solo and other randoms don‚Äôt do it because other survivors don‚Äôt do them‚Äù it‚Äôs circular reasoning. do the totems, no noed, don‚Äôt do them, noed. or find a buddy or two and you‚Äôre good.
---
No shit? Every time it happens to me I run off, the game goes wonky for 15 seconds and I go to the Endgame screen.
---
Not everyone has multiple level 40 characters lol 
---

Also it‚Äôs been altered, Now it would only apply to players rank 10 and above
---
Hex:Ruin, Hex:Haunted Ground, Barbecue and Chilli and A Nurse's Calling is a solid build. 
---
You can replace Barbecue and Chilli for Surveillance, Hex:Haunted Ground for Sloppy Butcher or Pop Goes the Weasel and Hex:Ruin for Hex:NOED ( just if you feel like a dirty Spirit ).
---
Wow, this thread is seasoned perfectly. U/nuggetnivag has used just enough salt.
---
Characters that people voted as having the worst perks are the characters that have the worst perks overall. A character with generally good perks (Unbreakable, Borrowed Time) but a single bad perk (Left Behind) like Bill is not going to win over characters with three underwhelming perks like Quentin and Ace.
---
With that shitty killer it's impressive
---
Like... I knew from the start that this was more than what it seemed... But the beginning of that little monologue sent my sides into the void from laughing so hard lmfao
---
Act more victimised please
---
You're right, I forgot how easy it was to just pick nurse and immediately drop 4Ks in rank 1 against survivors with thousands of hours and full meta perks. Makes you wonder why more people don't do it, considering how easy it is.
---
Your responses shed light on why you support teabagging culture. No good points with no objectives and wasting my damn time.
---

Survivor main here. I don't mind not escaping every game. Sure, it sucks because I want extra points, but hey, whatever. But I will pitch a bit of a fit over killers who are assholes to survivors who did nothing to deserve it. Such as facecamping a normal survivor (Not a teabagging asshat, just a normal survivor who knows how to loop and pallet stun.) or tunneling. The only thing that feels as bad as getting tunneled off hook and watching the killer then turn around and give the Claud who was sitting in a corner all game hatch (Intentionally, mind you) is getting killed and left for dead first hook by end game NOED after cleansing all the totems you could find.
---
Try playing ten games and having one of the two above scenarios happen to you every game as a solo survivor, and you get why people like me get pissy about killers saying we shouldn't expect to live every game. You're right, I don't expect to live every game, but holy fuck do I at least expect you to not let the person who did nothing all game go off scott-free. And I also expect the killer to be respectable on how they get that 4k- not just using shitty tactics that they know will get them an easy win while ruining the game for everyone else.
---
^I will be fair to killers who do this (Even if they don't do the same to me..) and say that the Devs do absolutely nothing to help discourage the behaviour. So yes, of course it's going to happen, and there's always going to be that one guy whose a cunt, whether it be a killer or survivor. But instead of being at each other's throats about it, we should probably get onto the Devs about it, since they're the only ones that can fix anything.
---
&gt;The following survivors weren‚Äôt mentioned by anyone as having had perks: ..... , Bill, ...

Updates- This would only apply to rank 10 players and above, By choosing no preference you will receive a bonus 15% blood point gain.
---
They're all in a discord call though, but idk you're right.
---
We're one of a kind *-*
---
What else are you supposed to work towards
---
Nurse is better, arguably even Spirit. 
---
Even Hag can be against solo survivors.
---
Wahhh I can't 4k against the most OP killer in the game that ignores every game mechanic I better complain about survivor perks
---
Then you get sniped by a hatchet
---
Leveling up characters, unlocking all perks, getting all characters p3, unlocking all perks on individual characters. Rank doesnt mean anything in this game
---
Got it! Thank youuu ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I do t want free escapes. I enjoy a challenge. When I'm saying both survivor and killer. It is comparable to Actual cheats as there isn't a counter. You can be grabbed off hooks when rescuing, borrowed time can be stalled, adrenaline is endgame only and is countered by noed. Decisive isn't even close to a counter, you can slug. Even if you get hit with ds, you can still continue going after them. There is no counter and it is impossible to play against. 
---
Here is a question for you genius: If it was considered a legit strategy, why does the game penalise bloodpoints and rank for doing it?
---
The game isn't balanced around swf, or to be more accurate, the game isn't balanced around external communication.
---
So based on your 2 games, you‚Äôve come up with those statistics?
---
You can't level up everyone, I mean you can, but it will take 1000+ hours, and by that time new survivors and killers will be added to the game, so more grinding.
---
I myself just picked Meg as my main p3 her and spend my survivor points on her. On killer side I play hag and doctor, didn't even prestige them, and still I'm lacking bloodpoints after maybe 150-200 hours of gameplay.
---
I can‚Äôt see how you didn‚Äôt steal it considering it was made *yesterday*
---
Lmao what
---
Not even gonna wait a day to repost?  Nice
---
Well I didn't know someone else had made this bed re so I apologize
---
Game got completely overhauled since release and is in a much better place now. Better yet, it goes on sale all the time, so I highly recommend anyone to try it out if they're interested
---
B-b-b-b-but is your fault, you should've played Nurse üòù.
---
Are there new bugs?
---
The chance of getting his perk is extremely low. It's only been on the shrine twice since he's been released, with the last time being just last month.
---
You could i dont know be away from the shack and do gens give the killer a reason to leave. I as a killer wouldnt leave if I knew 2 people are nearby waiting to rescue.
---
True.
---
Mother of pearl!!
---
It doesn't. Being on the hook from start to death is I believe, 2 and a half minutes. Thats EASILY enough time to just work on gens and get three done. Then he'll do someone else maybe, and you finish the other two. Thats without factoring in the chase time, and the carrying time. Not only that, but they lose points, and usually at best they saftey, and VERY rarely have I seen someone pip when they just camp the whole match. And in the terms of tunneling, its just the best logic. Tunneling happens because survivors let it happen. Unhooking near the killer causes tunneling. Anything else is the killer just happening find you again. Camping and tunneling sucks, but most of the time the killer is just taking advantage of whats infront of him. You expect me not to go for the injured guy when theres a death hooked person right there? Its just simple logic if you unhook near the killer, they should go after them.
---
nae nae'd
---
Camping is still a strat for new and experienced Killers.
---
Of course there is the good old "pressure him with Gens" which is true.
---
But some killers still facecamp you and sadly there is literally nothing you can do besides doing gens so he gets rekt.
---
As you rise in ranks you should see less and less facecamps. Of course if the Gates are open and the killer got someone down i would camp the hook aswell.
---
There is literally no point in trying to chase another survivor.

That's true. I dont think any killers should be nerfed if they aren't better than nurse. We also need to stop getting pushed out weak killers.

I feel like there should be one more tier, cause trapper, huntress, doctor, and billy are just a tad thiccer than hag imo
---
Lord Farquad for survivor?
---
Huntress is 8 in an adults body. Yikes
---
Lol, yep
---
Fix the bloodpoint economy. Too much of a grind.
---
Ironically I used it specifically to test if it was bugged and either the ban was 24 hours or I didn‚Äôt get one at all. Cause I didn‚Äôt get a popup when I logged in yesterday.
---
That's not toxic though... Stupid, but not toxic.
---
I play Killer 95% of the time, and yeah, when I play survivor it sucks to get tunneled or camped, but hey, his job is to destroy me and my team. If that's how he plans to do it, why am I gonna be salty about it? I'm way more salty when teammates don't use the time he spent camping to do three gens.
---
I‚Äôm going to need to you give me the sauce, sir.
---
I consistently see campers across all ranks. Killers use stuff like camping and tunnelling and rank up and never actually get good at the game so they keep relating on their crutches
---
And again, my point stands that it isn't fair for the person being camped 
---
Sure, I can somewhat see your point about the endgame but endgame collapse just made it all the more difficult
---
Actually saw someone say it like two or three days ago. While bitching about NOED.
---
Hag is secretly the Night Mother
---
He does look like at the first sight
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if you could try these in KYF?

---
Well it does seem like you want free escapes since your complaining about a strategy that kills people faster. 
---
No it‚Äôs absolutely not comparable to cheats. If you ever played against a cheater you‚Äôd know that all survivors that game are dead with camping at most 2 people die. 
---
You can get grabbed of the hook if you aren‚Äôt careful. Borrowed time can only be stopped if the killer is using insidious which is mostly used by people who deliberately want to camp. Adrenaline is end game only but competent survivors could do the final gens if 2 or more are already done and yes it can be countered by Noed and Noed can be countered by cleansing totems. 
---
Decisive strike is a counter as the killer slugging you wastes his time and if you aren‚Äôt the obsession he has no way to know you have it. 
---
DS doesn‚Äôt stop the killer from going after you but it does give you time to waste theirs. 
---
It‚Äôs a strategy but the devs want to discourage it because people like you complain that you paid money for a game and don‚Äôt have fun every time you play.
---
Maybe play killer for awhile? Or maybe try Civilization 5?
---
Oh shit, dat do be me
---
*Click*
---
N I C E.
---
That across the map kill!!!!
---
Hag would be hilarious because she is rather small but goddamn she is terrifying when she gets some momentum
---
Boy, I didn't get pissed off because I couldn't understand your sarcasm, I got pissed because you were using arguments that were completely irrelevant to what I was talking about. You're using the "if being gay becomes legal than people are going to start fucking their dogs next" style of argumentation, and I don't appreciate it.
---
*Cries in wraith*
---
I like it, except we're in a game is basically a weaker wop
---
get a headset and use your ears. that's all you need. on a serious note, try nurse's calling, sloppy butcher, bbq and whatever you like
---
I mean aside from frame drops, Unnerving or Doctor how the hell do you miss DS? I‚Äôve yet to miss it.
---
Blood lodge irl
---
You forgot spirit
---
Triple windows in the Autoshop map. Couldn't do a thing about it back in those days.
---
Congratulations on missing the point. I have played against cheaters and it was still a more fun experience as I was allowed to play.
---
Borrowed time can be stopped if you don't let them save. You're an idiot.
---
Adrenaline doesn't work if they can't save. Also noed directly counters it.
---
Ds doesn't work if they can't save
---
Please feel free to actually make a well constructed argument. I will wait patiently. And try to proof read to make sure you don't miss the point of everything next time
---
Way to be thief who blames the cop... Boi
---
Everytime this happens, i always lead the survivor to the hatch cus i feel bad.
---
That game sounds bad lmao and I play killer a lot and it feels the same it feels bad
---
It wouldn't surprise me in red ranks.  Sometimes you have to actually hold back or you risk a depip.
---
GAME OVER!
---
Bold of you to assume I didn't waste every pallet on the map wasting my DS. ;)
---
awaiting your verdict
---
No lie, would be a proud parent if that was my kid.
---
I once was playing with billy in rotren fields, the match started i wind up my chainsaw and 10 seconds into the sprint i downed someone they instantly dc
---
he's quite... underwhelming
---
My frames have been alright. Sorry for your loss
---
What‚Äôs wop

Oh fr?

Would also love to see a Xenomorph or Predator
---
The Entity doesn't allow them the chance to struggle, it feeds off of and attempts to manufacture/coerce/encourage all emotions, including hope.
---
While survivors cannot overpower killers, survivors no longer operate according to traditional human biology (the meat hook itself goes through where their heart would be, for one, on the left side of the chest) and are more resilient and durable than you'd expect.
---
It's not about whether they can physically struggle.
---
Let's hope the next one is Clown
---
It slows down the game just a lil bit
---
oh i misunderstood I see your point now. perhaps as you cleanse a totem the cleansing sounds get louder for each one cleansed. so the first one is fairly quiet, then the second is a little bit louder, until the last one is like the sound of cleansing a hex or something
---
your art is lovely, I like how you rendered the little fringes of thread on the end of her scarf. also this the exact combination of cosmetics I use because I love the purple sleeves and kitty mask xD
---
Except it isn‚Äôt counterable by those perks at all? borrowed time is on a timer so if the killer knows you‚Äôre using it they can just chase for a few seconds and then hit. dstrike doesn‚Äôt actually save you from anything, just gives you kind of a second chance (except the stun is only a couple of seconds, which won‚Äôt get you very far). Adrenaline is also countered by NOED (and with a camping killer who also tunnels, they can get the hit before the sprint burst even registers). Plus, adrenaline only works at the very end of the match. 
---
They never said they wanted an escape every match, but at least being able to play a match (even if you die) would be better than getting tunneled.
---
Got a 4k against a swf, 3 of them said gg and said it was a fun match but there was one guy who told me I was trash and would never reach red ranks also said Ghostface was op because he  could remove his red stain.
---
She's always like this, unfortunately. She's extremely aggressive about anything related to killers, and tries to justify everything that survivors do. It's not often that you meet someone that's actually a killer or survivor main, but she's very obviously all the worst stereotypes about survivor mains rolled up into an actual person.
---
Legion and ghostface
---
They can't resist how handsome Ace is
---
Ive never played with her yet.
---
Really? I don‚Äôt do it often, but I do it when it‚Äôs obvious that I‚Äôve lost or feel like leaving the game for whatever reason - there‚Äôs been at least 10 times struggle actually worked for me. I only started playing last month on top of that.

How did ghostface attacking the panel cause the exit gate to open?
---
The only thing that make is worth it using you have fun. She is pretty popular and can be viable in red ranks. You can watch tru3ta1ent. He seems to have a little faith in her.
---
No. 
---
No, no, no, no, no. Nope.
---
My favourite was how killers were able to instantly Mori you on the first down, or were capable of actually facecamping you with literally no way to unhook. If I recall trapper could also trap the hook so if you kobed, you just jumped into his trap.
---
I don't know which ones but he has two add-ons that make him strong but not broken
---
It's fantastic. Some genuinely unsettling ghosts in there.
---
That's a waste you can get perks by using your bloodpoints..
---
When I don't bm but I get killed trying to run out I get pissed off at the game. Especially when i get moried right before running out the gate.
---
"I'm just gonna leave you right by this hook. Oh no, gravity made your body go through the hook! It would't be wise to unhook you, you could bleed out. Let me go look for someone else to help."

Prestige Mocha

Do you know what they do?
---
Context? only bugs Bhvr has banned for are the exploitable ones like the whole legion double blade addons one or the trapping killers in crotus prenn asylum.
---
Prestige all of them.
---
Thanks! I am definitely watching it
---
Mocha?
---
Well wasnt ment to be... its completely stupid to put both doors super close together dbd needs to get it together.
---
&gt;I prefer the traditional chases, a killer running behind the survivor in a more realistic way I guess.
---
Yes he did
---
Actually, I've completed a gen as he hooked the second guy. No reason to camp still. You can't counter camping if he doesn't leave the basement shack and just hunts you two down when they die.
---
It may not have been back then, buts definitely going down that path.
---
That's shitty, they're outside the map but they died regardless
---
It definitely should sound like a hex totem because that could relay incorrect information. I think that just the small auditory click that the players would have to manually count would be fine, with the option of bringing a more reliable totem counting perk.
---
Yeah, well newsflash, nobody was running around and also I completed a gen as the second guy was hooked. Sorry to break it to you, but campers are trash lmao
---
What?? Can you point out where I said that?
---
Don't unhook if the killer is nearby and is not distracted by a skill check fail or finished gen. I am killer Main and even though I don't camp, I go back to the hook if survivor gets unhooked. Then I chase whoever I see or hear the first which is mostly the injured one.
---
No tunneling. And well I have to add I don't give a fuck that I hook you three times in a row if you get caught three times. This is my goal of the game. Why should I let go of something that is in front of me?
---
Except I did a gen and Huntress didn't bat an eye.
---
I would say Ghost Face. Myers can be very limited on how he can use his ability, and he can only get to EW3 so many times. Ghost Face can mark people an unlimited amount of times and feels like he gains stalk much more quickly. The ability to crouch also helps GF a lot, since it provides more accessibility to stalking that Myers doesn‚Äôt have a lot of the time. Plus, he can stalk at loops as well as Myers, since he can be blocked. Ironically, he‚Äôs more stealthy than Myers, since Myers is gigantic and has COPD.
---
Wheres the Strawpoll OP
---
If you go straight for an Injured person before they react, that is tunnelling. So yeah, you do.
---
Yeah, I did a gen. No excuse for camping at all. Also I forgot to mention I tried to get him to chase my by flashlighting a bit but to no avail. The guy just doesn't move...
---
3% chance boi
---
Were you or the other player nearby? Had you guy during the match bum rushed hooks.
---
To quote Bill: "Goddamnit, I am seriously FUBAR!"
---
Huntress sounds cute in an aggressive way.
---
I don't get why people think Pig does though, Pig's sounds... Disgusting? Like someone snorting rotting food through their nose and choking on it.

It's not top tier and it requires a lot of skill, you need this guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di\_ixvw19mU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di_ixvw19mU) is not updated but most of it is really helpful
---
what
---
No don't you get it? If my teammate gets hooked I have to fucking dive bomb the hook no matter what the circumstances are
---
Killers are jokes in this game....
---
90 percent tunnel and camp
---
10 percent tunnel and slug
---
100 percent toxic.
---
Survivors are no better, but most survivors 9n console at least are absolutely awful. If a killer has to resort to camping, then they should quit the game. It is way too wasy these days to get a 4k
---
I honestly don‚Äôt see how you can have fun against a killer who hacks and kills everyone than a killer who kills at most 2 people but I‚Äôll leave you to your own logic.
---
‚ÄúBorrowed time can be stopped if you don't let them save. You're an idiot.‚Äù
---
Yes it can if its an instadown killer but if it‚Äôs not you can take a hit and unhook, and for the grabbing part you could fake unhook. And I like that insult you included it just shows that we can‚Äôt have a civil discussion without calling each other insults. 
---
‚ÄúDs doesn't work if they can't save‚Äù
---
‚ÄúAdrenaline doesn't work if they can't save. Also noed directly counters it.‚Äù
---
You can save if they are not an insta down and can completely counter Noed by cleansing totems. 
---
‚ÄúPlease feel free to actually make a well constructed argument. I will wait patiently. And try to proof read to make sure you don't miss the point of everything next time‚Äù
---
I still don‚Äôt see your point. 
---
Is it that you paid 30¬£ and have an unfun experience? Is it that it‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to unhook when the killer is camping? Or is it just the old regular camping bad post?
---
You should really be concerned if you‚Äôre gonna enjoy said killer or not. Shouldn‚Äôt let an article dictate who should you play or not.
---
The lacerate perk would be so annoying as killer would leave the last survivor on the ground in order to get the Mori credit.
---
No, it isn't. Because tunneling requires camping. If a killer gets you, hooks you, then walks away, then you have a lot of time to just let them stay on the hook until the killer is busy, then save them saftely. And yes, that swf is unfair as hell. I think Killers are mostly underpowered tbh.
---
Idk for brand new parts. They Prolly need some sort of complete rework. Camping and tunnelling should be more heavily punished. Just speculation, I'm not great at game designing but killers should receive some sort of nerf for performing these actions. Idk.
---
Omg lol i meant Michael
---
I don‚Äôt know why people blind at pallets, just wasting battery they could be using to attempt saves.
---
So. I got the 5‚Ç¨ reduction thingy. They released some side things u can do to increase the cap free. Then do 5 achivements in PD2, and done.
---
Not real, still worst perk in the game.
---
Flashlighting 'abit'? Dude, you blind him, your buddy runs in and unhooks, then you blind again and run like hell. Sounds like you're just not willing to take risks.
---
I wasn't near the hooks. He hooked the second guy as I completed a generator. The other survivor was probably doing a gen too since he wasn't around the basement when I came.
---
I used to use hope all the time. Nice and fun perk
---
Watch any good survivor streamers, you will literally never see them cleanse dull totems. Monto even said it perfectly in one of his recent videos "unless you personally cleanse all of them don't bother" and even then, that's like more than half a generator you just spent doing dull totems when they might not even have NOED. Just do gens and the one game out of ten or fifteen where you die to NOED is just bad luck
---
It could have easily killed him though
---
Jane was so engrossed in taunting that she didn't even bother running after the first stab.
---
Borrow time is kinda iffy. Seems like killer just tunnels them anyways lol
---
Me running in front of him isn‚Äôt taking risks? She's got hatches also. Do you even play dbd?
---
Idk. Man i feel youre skioping out on me.
---
The Chucky in the new movie has been shown be able to jump high. He can bounce up, and then off the window sill to the ground.
---
Killers are nowhere near underpowered. You have clearly never played dbd from both sides. Pathetic biased arguments
---
I mean, if happens more then we think. I had a team throw themselves in front of me knowing mad grit was in the shrine that week and I got 2 downs and the hook in my hand. Am I supposed to let them live when it's ripe for the taking?
---
I know you are just looking to vent and not really looking for an answer, but perhaps start running perks like Kindred and Decisive Strike. Better yet find some friends to play with and have them body block/run borrowed time, and distract the killer so you don't get tunneled.
---
Imagine playing a game like counter strike and asking why people use certain strategies or weapons. It's pointless to speculate.
---
This is true, and it weakens Unbreakable slightly but would be a very niche perk. I also concepted the perks before the EGC was a thing. Also this isn‚Äôt really a contest submission or a realistic concept or anything; as much as I‚Äôd love to play as the character I created in DBD, I don‚Äôt feel others would enjoy the gameplay as she has several game slowing mechanics and some things that may seem overpowered built into her kit. Plus spaghetti code.
---
I sometimes do it. sometimes worked
---
I'm not a mathematician but those numbers seem off.   I play on xbox and run into far more chill players and fun games than I do toxic.   If the killers camping do gens.  Gen pressure is the easiest counter to camping.
---
If 100% of killers are toxic. That includes you.
---
Legion rework lmao what the fuck?
---
Killer main here. Git gud. Or at least come up with proper arguments other than "survivors op"
---
if I had to choose between an organized swf or 3 blink nurse w/ ruin I'd take organized SWF any day
---
do you mean survivors should have audio cue? because they do..
---
And then she eats your liver üò´
---
Well done. Sub + like. 
---
Can you do the same with bruno vs king crimson scene in the end of the episode 20.
---
-I decided to show you...as a parting gift.
---
Since this is the end I'll fill you in. What you just witnessed and felt 
---
Was my bad internet connection. You from a few seconds before met me in the future. 
---
This is my [Ping Crimson] ability. 
---
I lagswitched and lept past that wall. 
---
I don't care who it is. I will not allow anyone to threaten my ghostface gameplay with OoO, no matter what.
---
And now, you're going to have to be moried. 
---
Lauri, you mission as STBFL target is over.
---
It is impossible. Faking an unhook doesn't work if the killer has brain cells. You must just be bad at dealing with it .
---
Fair enough. I still feel they‚Äôd go the reboot route though.
---
Yes happens all the time on ps4, better yet, you dont have to be downed for this to occur. Can happen from a multitude of occurrences. Even better, when you open the gate youre not allowed to escape.
---
Dont crouch near a tree either, because you can 100 perceny get stuck until the killer downs you.
---
Game is absolutely broken in this current state. But who cares! As long as we got that unbelievably necessary ghostface "fix". Devs, step your game up amd fix this broken shit.
---
Doctor is like many other killers : balanced with green/purple/red add-ons and very weak without them.
---
Dude idk if you read my other comments on this post. (I play both survivor and killer) I do not camp or tunnel (also camping gives you less BPS, a lot of people don't know this, it should be displayed that you are loosing points so people would tend not to camp). I know who's getting hatch, I know who I'm killing, who did gens, who kept me distracted and who sat in a corner doing nothing. I always try to play as much as survivor sided, if there's a dc at the start of the game I'll let the survivors escape and get the depip. I got teabagged, yes, I got bullied by neon Neas with flashlights, but it doesn't matter, I don't care if it's just a pip. I got complimented by a survivor which I probably killed during the trial for playing fair and not tunneling or camping (3 kills 1 escape through hatch). I also apologize if some of my teammates teabag a legit killer who did nothing than playing the game, I was playing against a Leatherface, i ran in the basement (don't ask me why) and he started revvin his chainsaw, so I hop in a locker, he stops revving and goes for the grab, then I come out and he starts revving again, and it goes like this till he gets me and I die on my last hook, my teammates survive and teabag at the exits, I texted him and greeted with him and that was probably the funniest moment I ever had in this game.
---
Facing a handful of survivors way below your rank is generally easy no matter who/what you‚Äôre using tbh
---
I figured the way he could work is be human and have the dolls scattered around the map, his power would be possessing one of the dolls like it was a camera to check for survivors and a specific area in the dolls line of sight.
---
"Survivors used to be able to infinite loop unless you were the Nurse regardless of your skill as killer. Now they can loop you for five minutes straight unless you're the Nurse regardless of your skill as killer. Obviously, you should win all of your matches. Noob. Ggez"
---
*when 2 gens are down and the last 5  are conveniently close and a mere straight jog away from each other*
---
Happened during my first time as huntress
---
Wait what?
---
Thanks for spending your precious time for reading that paragraph bruh
---
you should't, they were able to do good
---
No they said they wouldnt make a killer shorter then hag
---
Dude, you‚Äôre not listening. Enjoy your whine, I‚Äôll get you some cheese for it.
---
\&gt;pick different killer
---
\&gt;find lobby
---
\&gt;switch to ghostface
---
\&gt;profit
---
honestly, have it be introduced as a game mode in kyf, along with other things such as the two killers 8 survivors. i think it would be awesome to have a game mode that goes back to the OG game.
---
I think the load times for killer is long because of the event
---
oh, i dont have to imagine, i can remember.
---
depends on how they quit out.if they quit by "leaving game" you get all the points you earned+5k for escaping. if they turn off their internet, device, or force close the game you get nothing(for whatever reason)
---
Exactly!
---
4% base chance
---
Oh fuck
---
because tbh it was really unfair to killers and it was back when killers couldnt even kick gens, and back when there was thw vaccum on pallets.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ honestly
---
Way to state the obvious, genius.
---
Yep toxic to SWF groups for sure.
---
I personally let the 4th person go for most matches because rank means shit in this game. 
---
But dont be so upset because you need hex ruin,NOED, a mori, and to slug people just to get a 4k.
---
The hell it is. I'm not letting those losers tell me whether or not I had fun and fuck em if they can't take a loss.
---
it was changed and you had to hit skillchecks to get a 10% progression until you repair the whole gen or miss a skillcheck.
---
If you stoped repairing it broke the toolbox.

Why is it when the killer DC'S, you are awarded bloodpoints but don't actually receive them?
---
Should have received 27k points, got 0. Love salty rage quitters
---
Josie?
---
Oh and I forgot to mention : even with his best add-ons, he's still probably gonna lose against good/decent survivors. Like many other killers ...
---
Okay thanks
---
And can't forget Ghostface a highly anticipated character came out making more people play killer . sure he may have came out awhile ago but people still want to try him and I could see it die done way more in a week.
---
Are cakes from the event usable after the event?
---
The report of the week. He reviews fast food on Youtube and is a swell guy.
---
haunted / ruin / nurses / barbecue with calm and restraint is a guilty pleasure of mine and i always use it against a swf who have a map with them
---
high stimulus electrode is garbage and never use it / moldy is his best range addon
---
restraint is a good beginner addon for him
---
thrilling tremors / ruin / discordance / overcharge with order (fake pallets) and restraint is my favorite anti-genrush build 
---
virtually any perks works on him it just depends on how you like to play!
---
Or get Blood Warden'd by your retarded teammate tbagging at hatch and getting hook right as you open the gate.
---
bond does the same thing and doesnt require them to be injured.and yeah the range is shorter but tbh if the killer is 100 meters away i dont care and knowing he's100 meters away does nothing for me
---
Because it only works when a survivor is injured while Bond it's alternative can spot survivors in a certain range but shows you them even if they are injured plus people use perks that help in chases and stealth then knowing what their teammates are doing
---
Sometimes it's funny realizing that survivors are STILL massively overpowered, and then looking back at how just ridiculously more overpowered they were then to realize how inept BHVR are at balancing this game.
---
So much wrong with this post
---
Is s the best lol cause nurse is terrible
---
Well, I realized I never replied. If it's not too late, or if you haven't received an answer.
---
I'd recommend pig, spirit, or ghost face.
---
Pig and ghost face are all about suppressing their terror radius to gain an upper hand. Pig has the nice ability to slow the game down as well, where as ghost face gains the insta downs. Pig also can use her sneak in chases more effectively than ghost face imo, although it's mostly a pre chase sneak.
---
Spirit can just appear places withhout anyone noticing, so she can be great at gen grabbing and catching up with someone without them noticing. After that it's mostly normal chases, but you can still use your ability in chases to cut people off sneakly too.
---
Also, Freddy is getting reworked at some point, but he is a very fun sneaky killer. He's disliked by many tho, so I give you this as a disclaimer. He's great at hit and run tactics. Where you'll hit someone, and let them run away, do other things, and down them before they can heal. He's hard to figure out, but very fun in my opinion
---
A water map with a merman too :D
---
You sir, are disabled.
---
? He is tho
---
CLOWN IN F AND DOC IN D?! SIR WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!?
---
Assuming it works the first time on a killer, then they just wait/bait it out.
---
‚Äúbalanced‚Äù is a strong word
---
i don‚Äôt find him to be weak but he‚Äôs hard to pick up and play
---
if you‚Äôre good at him honestly i don‚Äôt really feel there will be too much issue
---
Claudette's shadow magic
---
Thanks for the reply. That makes a lot of sense.  Sometimes I would get a lot of points and sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt haha.
---
Because they said it is, its really a paragraph but since it fit in the release schedule they called it a chapter.
---
youve clearly never played against a nurse that knows what theyre doing
---
I am a zlave to this passion
---
reddit
---
that is true as well. that is why I laughed when the devs thought it was a good idea to release him the day of the event even more so when the event was just a blood point event and nothing more so everyone just wants to play killer for more BP
---
The blood transfusion has started
---
When it happened to me, I found the other gate worked.
---
Yep. I do think it has gone down more as survivors are getting pretty good at spotting Ghostface which causes them just to say fuck it and switch back to survivor or the killer they originally played.
---
Be the change you want to see in the world: Take perks that focus on countering tunnel/camping styles. Get the killer tunneling your ass then abuse his tunneling to loop him long enough for your team to win. Stop acting like your own reckless saving being punished is a reason to get upset at the killer.
---
spirit
---
Reddit
---
Ya ghost face is the type of killer that takes some skill and he can dominate that‚Äôs why I love him
---
Ah okay thanks that‚Äôs helpful. I haven‚Äôt unlocked bond so I may just be naive. One thing I use the bigger range of empathy for is to help understand if I need to be the one to go unhook someone who is far away because I see a fellow survivor in a chase before they are downed.
---
I've done it once and I escaped as well using ds when the killer downed me again
---
Great concept I love the possession idea
---
Make your choice is too op lol
---
Technically, the hag has a hat. Her head is a seperate part of her body.
---
So just play him allot
---
Oh that sucks
---
Might as well add the R&amp;B survivor duo "milli vanilli" while we're at it.
---
This video thumb is a big "no" to me
---
I don't know why I made this.
---
[Imgur link of just the image without the caption.](https://imgur.com/gallery/efBdyNc)
---
Idk man, I find it pretty easy to get a 4k as Doctor without being toxic. If I find a person that was just unhooked I simply slug them for the extra bloodpoints.
---
Doctor's Thetapy Shock range is garbage without add-ons and Madness 1 and Madness 2 do next to nothing without purple/red add-ons. He has just tracking, while his anti loop power is a joke.
---
Clown has no mobility, stall or snow ball, you can just camp or drop the pallet earlier to counter his power and he is currently affected by 40 bugs.
---
I been using my points on perks at the Shrine lol
---
Lmfao
---
It was already released, but I decided to add it to the meme because of how bad they are pre buff/rework
---
basically
---
Wait, I thought it was a phone he used, not a camera. Did they change it?
---
Why would he leave 2 guaranteed kills? He even has the opportunity to basement more if you‚Äôre foolish enough to rescue.
---
Only one of me but more than enough to go around.
---
What do you think of hag?
---
bring ivory mori, start the mori, cancel. repeat several times until they dc. boom, your ivory is now an ebony
---
This happens all the god dam time to me.

while i‚Äôm not personally too good at her there‚Äôs a consensus she‚Äôs good

Had this happen the other day and got called a tunneler for it. Like, your idiot ass decided to go into the basement, am I supposed to let you wander around?

So i might play hag or doc

oh god oh fuck

Long story short alot of them are based off movie slashers

---
Insta-nutüòÇ
---
Can confirm that Ivory Moris are as strong as Ebony Moris on the following Killers:
---
* Legion
---
* Doctor
---
* Hillbilly (if you spam it)
---
* Spirit (if you spam it, or if you play against salty Survivors)
---
* Huntress (especially if you spam it)
---
* Clown (*especially* if you spam it)
---
I would agree with most of this except Pig, Plague and
---
No u
---
Never
---
I‚Äôd suck on Myers‚Äô toes
---
The entity's basically just toying with them for the struggle phase, after that is when it bothers to actually try killing them.
---
Freddy is a god
---
So is scream yeah he should be in rework instead of freddy
---
Nurse breaks the game.
---
It was weird lol, I don't even remember playing it thay much at the time, just the running animations, they were funny lol
---
You can purchase any killer at any level for 9000 shards (except licensed one)
---
Bruh moment
---
Sure did kill Sing though
---
Man i still got a hilarious clip that you could place a bear trap under the hook so if someone unhooked themself they got immediatly trapped.
---
Or the time that you could force killers to play a shape or hag with 0 perks because offerings where broken. Or run around with a dwight and he got a chainsaw in his hand
---
I'm rank 14 looking for a swf. You wanna play? And do you have a mic?
---
That kind of taps into one of my points. Those media? They don't focus on *just* Jack the Ripper's killings. This game? Killing and murder is the sole focus of this game, put center stage and focused on. And not to mention that no other piece of media (AFAIK) has a person been able to *control* and *act* as JtR.
---
Having Jack the Ripper as a killer is kind of not only profiting off the victims' death, it's kind of glorifying him as a murderer/killer.
---
not against a myers.
---
the doctor
---
if you want a top tier killer just play spirit or nurse though
---
"Hey i want to rework a perk that doesn't need rework, here's my retarded idea" - You, 2019
---
I was in the closed beta for like a weekend. I forgot how I got on but trapper was the only killer. 
---
I do sort of miss the old insta-moris though. Granted they were alot more bullshit but "Mori all four survivors" achievement was a little bit easier because survivors wouldn't be able to suicide to deny it.
---
I also miss that scary "OH SHIT" feeling after the first guy gets Mori'd and everyone is in a panic unsure if it's an ebony or not until the second person is downed and hooked/Mori'd. 
---
I think a long time ago when I played hatch always spawned at roundstart, meaning you could get Where Did They Go (4-man hatch escape) before a single gen is done if you had a key
---
I hate them both to heck no
---
We may as well just not even have a rank system.
---
The feeling you'd get when you fuck up on the first check with one of those gears :(
---
No, Sing killed himself by walking through a hallway hastily.
---
Jigsaw said so himself that he's never killed anyone; why aren't you believing him?
---
I will make you... beautiful.
---
üÖ±ruh
---
Thats not what I'm asking, I mean what is the lowest level I can be to have 9000 shards?
---
Clown is extremely easy to counter. He shortens loops. That‚Äôs literally it.
---
even worse place for a totem.... seriously fuck whoever designed the totem/totem perks in this game.
---
Survivors belong on the hook.
---
When they fall off, the Killer simply helps them back on.
---
If you hold crouch, then start holding sprint before letting go of crouch u can start sprinting and it won't use sprint burst
---
The sole reason I do killer over survivor right now is bloodpoint gain and that's it. I enjoy playing survivor more to be honest, but a really good survivor game seems to get me 40k BP, where a really BAD killer game gets me that amount, or doubled if I do well.
---
Probably not...
---
Various times. 10+ mins and so on. Any other killer or survivor i never wait for that length of time ever.
---
Lmao the people in this thread defending it with game mechanics as if anything behavior does justifies our suffering
---
hmmmm give doctor a try then
---
I personally don‚Äôt see any benefit to prestiging, unless you really want the bloody clothes. I‚Äôd recommend getting all teachables, then getting all perks on whoever you want to main.
---
Would have to be an adult survivor like the rest. Wb what‚Äôs his name Sherrif?
---
I will
---
And it's a weird place for a hex totem to right next to the damn generator
---
People would find a way to get it into a normal game
---
You can coordinate your Madness tier ups to prevent vaults and pallets, which gives him some kind of loop control. I'd probably put him and Clown one step higher. Pretty solid tier list overall though.
---
That's is very very likely a SWF group. No way to prevent that outside of not allowing them to play together, which would kill the game overnight.
---
Props to FarmerJohn for the vid I stole this from 
---
https://youtu.be/bc1AXPQGax8
---
Not enough bp for this near impossible daily.
---
Who remembers when daily rituals were hard but gave good bp, I miss that.
---
Nothing like working on a gen for a solid 60 seconds while the killer chases someone on the opposite side of the map, and close to you is a Claudette crouching her way over to your gen, hiding behind each tire pile for 10 seconds.
---
If you don't play pacifist, y o u ' r e g o n n a h a v e a b a d t i m e .
---
Yeah i actually got a clip from that bear trap thing haha: https://youtu.be/ag536hVt81Q
---
Legit sounds like it would be fun.
---
Damn this gave me a few good ideas. Could be the demon from insidious 1 or an alternative would be Darth Maul from Star Wars and the weapon could be a light saber.
---
Trapper being Joel and Legion being Ellie is A++
---
Legion is just fine honestly
---
Doctor goes in wtf.
---
Monstrous shrine outta here and insidious instead
---
Im with you on that. Like I said rank is stupid on this game, means nothing. I go in to have a good time playing as killer or survivor. This game is just littered with horrible playing on both ends. Been playing long enough to realize it too. 
---
Cant play survivor on ps4 at the moment due to so many game breaking bugs though.
---
I use Bond instead of Empathy because anything that isn't in Bond's radius is irrelevant to me.
---
Wait what? Why do you crouch towards a hag?
---
This is actually like peak circlejerk.
---
Survivor brings up DS as a comparison to NOED, complains about how DS is bad (it's not), and then someone else is upset that DS was brought up while talking about NOED even though it was only to bitch about how bad DS is.
---
Laughs in Bubba
---
That was the best version. Nerfed it into the ground
---
I've been on ps4 since right before huntress release (long story why I still don't have a working computer) and I stopped playing heavily around spirit release, cause the game had gotten so buggy/laggy. Much better now than back then, but I still cant seem to play more than 1 or 2 matches at a time just cause of how turned off of the game I became.
---
dope, thanks you
---
‚ÄúWhat kind of Nurse uses Spirit Fury‚Äù
---
Dude the new Droideka are fun, tried it yet? They do need to buff the shields and raise the points needed to play as them though, it's easier to grab a Droideka than, say, an OG super battle droid.
---
You have to buy the dlc via store
---
Shit I know that feeling
---
Yea, like come on Behaviour, they don't have to be hard as fuck to find, but they at least shouldn't be easily seen while doing gens and ignoring the ruin.
---
Oh well that sucks
---
Because not every shock will prevent survivors from vaulting. It is when they go up a madness tier, which you can time properly with your shocks.
---
This. I see little to no difference between my non prestige and prestige 3 bloodwebs.
---
Only if it's corrupted
---
Even today Rancid Abbatoir is still one strong ass loop. Wretched Shop too if someone can use it properly.
---
Fuck this was hilarious.
---
Sounds good. Should work on all fast killer.
---
Michale
---
Yep this is exactly why. A bigger radius for the chase. Survivors tend to run by or around each other so it help to tag a lot of them with madness.
---
Yeah, he only knocked them down and put them on a hook
---
"Stop projecting and get better"
---
Funny, seems like youre the one projecting
---
Yeah, should really work on any quick or mobile killer.
---
I'd start playing as Feng Min if I could by Slendermin
---
You could play as Jack the Ripper in Assassin‚Äôs Creed Syndicate.
---
That survivor got up a tier when he fast vaulted, he screamed with a second before he vaulted  that window, The Doctor from that match almost DC because of that.
---
And his Shock is unusable without add-ons.
---
Software Development in general. :P
---
My favourite TEE
---
maybe he's getting downvoted because why post it to reddit? it's not his personal blog and p1(and p3 too) isnt an impressive accomplishment, literally just a waste of a post.
---
It's even funnier when you realize that it's Frank's mask
---
I know I hope they patch it
---
I'd say he has quite an Underwhelming Presence.

This. This is perfect.

For a moment I thought that that picture of the black hole was edited in on his eye lol
---
&gt;Killing and murder is the sole focus of this game, put center stage and focused on.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Having Jack the Ripper as a killer is kind of not only profiting off the victims' death, it's kind of glorifying him as a murderer/killer.
---
Ghost Face is controvesial to me. Some people say that he is weaker than Myers and some people say that he is stronger than him. Ghost Face game play wasn't impressive for me at the moment. He doesn't have the snow ball Myers has, he seems to be very weak agaisnt SWF because of his power being reliant on survivors, he is hard countered by OoO and Spine Chill, he is more loopable than Myers ( no fast vault or longer lunge ) and his power has a 30 seconds cooldown at base.
---
Maybe after I see more Ghost Face I will change my mind, but he doesn't seem stronger right now. And people already seem to not play Ghost Face anymore, LOL.
---
get to rank one on PC and try to play him.
---
clearly a bait people are falling for lol
---
yes sorry I would not do the benefits for items is brown = light blue and blue = event (sorry if it was not that you hoped)
---
they nerfed nurse, now she can be broken out of blink if she gets stared at
---
Thanks &lt;3.
---
Those shocks would be so right
---
I use decisive strike, bond, dead hard, and spine chill
---
yeah it‚Äôs annoying but it‚Äôs the killer‚Äôs job to kill you
---
You're the one calling people salty and complaining about things you don't know how to work around.
---
Infinite loading screen when playing killer using LAN on PS4. I can play killer using WiFi and I can play survivor using LAN + WiFi.  I have uninstalled, reset my router, changed Ethernet cables, tried my partners PS4, played on my partners account. My NAT type is 2.

Not exactly how the meme format works but aight.
---
What the fuck are you on about? Killers don't need an "excuse" to play the game and kill you. They aren't obligated to risk their 2 kills chasing you around the map and allowing the free save.
---
you are modifying them which can be considered hacking so /shrug
---
You know those Donald trump masks? That.
---
You can kill someone with you hands with certain perks (devour hope, rancor), addons (only Myers) and offerings (wich are called memento mori, you get those in the bloodweb)
---
Maining nurse now bye
---
All the gens must be done. Also if you close the hatch you can‚Äôt do it anymore
---
Youre thick for someone who is supposedly reading comments.
---
Its cool though, not all of us are weak willed like you and have to attack with random nonsense since they can not comprehend the replies. 
---
Toxic community will stay toxic till this game goes away.
---
Think about how this post would look like without DBD context
---
Got one for jakey where I had to be chased for 2 seconds
---
I really wanna know who drew the original pic
---
Someone abusing their power means you're automatically trash? Sick 10 year old logic my dude.
---
I‚Äôm struggling to see how me watching the general direction you walk is unfair when as killer I can literally see where everyone is after a hook with BBQ
---
For Killer or Survivor?
---
I'm repeating myself because it's the only thing that needs to be said, you're repeating yourself because you need to convince yourself that you aren't completely wrong. One day you will learn rank is useless everyone who plays for a while will get rank one both killer and survivor.
---
Hag and Huntress should be swapped imo
---
Usually for survivor. So far out, away from everything else, it gets rarely checked.
---
Of course, if you find someone there as Killer, that's a hard spot to get away from.
---
Trapper is....
---
&gt;Nurse with more than 2 blinks
---
Very epic, you got him
---
Wait what? How could you cancel perks with offerings? I wasn't playing back then, I'm genuinely curious now.
---
Survivors on console are selfish jackasses that pull you off hook right in front of the killer. Then they just crouch around the hatch waiting for you to die, or if they get caught they'll struggle on hook until the killer find hatch.  You can't blame killers for tunneling or camping when survivors refuse to go past 3 gens.
---
when I read the jackal I think about the warframe "boss" 
---
lmao a killer based on one of them would be awesome.....
---
This list is perfect except I feel like Huntress should be in the A tier
---
killers should be nerfed
---
He‚Äôs my new favorite killer I love being in games with him! Good job op can‚Äôt wait to see the p3!! And don‚Äôt let internet bullies get to u :)
---
I was tempted to put Ghostface in D tier since he is add-on dependent but I decided to be nice and put him in C tier
---
Huntress is very map dependent Imo.
---
And she doesn't counter all loops as Hag does.
---
there was 0 new gamemodes in 3 years, y would things change?
---
Shame you're scamming people, with an account with less then 1 hour
---
I would put huntress in A tier but I feel so many maps have cover that makes her hatchets extremely hard to use making her extremely map dependent because if you get the game i feel hatchets will be way too hard to hit.

I might have added another tier or two tbh. I don't feel some of these are quite on the same level.
---
yeah. watch where the gates are when he closes it. go to the one you think he's further from if youre lucky enough to have prior knowledge of where the hatch is. if not just wing it and hope. if you feel the killer is nearby, hide until they go to check the other one. if it's a high mobility killer or the gates are close together, do the gate to around 20%(the point right before the first light starts)and hide again. wait for the killer to come have a look around(but alot of times they dont stay around long unless they have whispers) then go back and finish the gate. 
---
requires a bit of skill and a lot of luck but it's possible
---
Good job guy! Keep up the good work! It‚Äôs funny because I literally got my first all Iridescent game during my first day of a free weekend... Then again, probably easy at rank 20!
---
Description: Survivors in your Terror Radius consume their items 100% slower
---
I got a liking to ghost face after the buff he‚Äôs my favorite killer but before the buff this meme explains him pre buff
---
Easy DC for Add ons.
---
Thank ya &lt;3
---
The truth hurts my friend.  I agree, best to stay off this sub if you‚Äôre going to whine about things that have been in the game for over 3 years.  I‚Äôm sure you think you‚Äôre being insightful or adding something new to the community.
---
You‚Äôre not.
---
leather should switch to d no where near as bad as freddy
---
Wow excellent point, tbh they should nerf eyes. Seeing is OP and biased against killers
---
Good one!!!
---
This is the part where I tell you the escape rate of all rank 1-5 during Howling Grounds (more than 2 years ago) was 50% almost on the dot including SWF. Only SWF was 70~%, and solo was... less than 30%. This was shown on the dev stream. This was 2 years ago, where survivors were WAY stronger.
---
Now tell me, what do you think the data would say now?
---
Always love these videos, they're perfect for when you want to start playing a different killer!
---
Oh god, the salt
---
Yeah, I won't deny that xD
---
Scratched mirror Myers baby
---
‚ÄòEntity Displeased‚Äô
---
Look at the post flair, captain Obvious.
---
It's stupid to compare survivor perks to killer perks. Unless a perk is completely overpowered it doesn't need a counter for the other side.
---
Considering he is getting a rework, he's gonna be a completely different killer so you should think about the future rather than whats good right now. When he gets the teleport to gen ability i would imagine perks like BBQ&amp;C, PGTW and Surveillance would be a must have.
---
remake nancy's last name isnt thompson and remake nancy doesnt deserve to clean OG nancy's shoes!
---
Dread it, Run from it. Activate windows a l w a y s a r r i v e s
---
I only put Plague so high because Survivors usually don't cleanse making them all broken allowing you to just one shot them and if you have pallet breaking perks the match will be insanely easy in my opinion.        the reason Ghostface is so low is because he is very add on dependent  and if you don't have spot range reduction add-ons he is just a M1 killer and insanely easy to spot but I have to admit he is a great noobstomper . for the others it was kinda hard to pick the spot they would be in.

Stop pirating windows

People are saying that ‚ÄúGetting P1 is easy‚Äù and that ‚ÄúThis is a waste of a post) and I‚Äôm just sitting here like ‚ÄúGetting to P3 was easier than P1 for me‚Äù.
---
But anyways, Congrats! Having bloody

weapons/clothings looks pretty cool so have fun with leveling him up more!
