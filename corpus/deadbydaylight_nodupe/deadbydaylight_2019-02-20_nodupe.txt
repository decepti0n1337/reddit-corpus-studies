isnt this the norm trophy sheet for any other killer/survivor dlc wise
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
cept "fix the super hard" part lol idk 
---
---
---
Literally haven't played against a clown that didn't tunnel
---
why isnt piggy on top 😤😤😤😤😤
---
If you get a rapid rehook where the guy doesn’t get far b4 going down again then he’s that much closer to dying and as soon as he does the game becomes mounds easier for the killer.
---
Going for the healthy guy is good if you need short term pressure but killing a guy off is really good for the killer in the long run. If it can be done without losing more than 3 gens then the killer has basically set himself up to win.

---
for real bro on my grandma dude
---
So dope.
---
Does this look like chilis?
---
It's backbreaking when it's good. Triggering mid-chase after you've already been hit or when you get unhooked (if you're hooked when the last gen gets done, it waits to trigger) is devastating against any killer who doesn't have an instant down (and the Sprint burst is still useful). Especially for streamers who are good at looping and making videos based on that, it gives that extra boost to finish the game with an escape.
---
That said you really want to be pretty good at looping before bringing it.
---
Play nurse hag billy spirit or huntress 
---
I say we pebble him!
---
i disagree. 
---
Yeah idk, I mentioned above it was a waste. Just playing my normal build and forgot
---
To
---
Change out the perk. 
---
Piglet is poopy diaper killer &gt;:(
---
Often it’s not that he’s toxic, just that he’s unfun to play against. Everyone here paid money so they could play a multiplayer game, not be an NPC in someone else’s single player game.
---
“based off stun sounds” 😤
---
Stop farming me dammit 
---
Myers is on the far end of evil on that chart.
---
It was his first one, and he mistaken it for the toolbox
---
Well, we got a perk from LF
---
Yeah it's a shame her mask is thiccer than oatmeal so you can't hear shit 🙄🙄🙄🙄
---
steals and reposts meme and goes out of their way to be even more lazy by not even bothering to give it a proper title
---
Garbage and recycled shrine
---
Its still a tunnel, it just ends the survivors suffering quicker.
---
I feel you man...
---
I was playing earlier and 1 teammate got sniped by billy in the first 20 Seconds of the game and then he dc'd. After that the other 2 people also dc'd. So I basically had to 1v1 the killer. Not sure if they were SWF (most likely) or did they give up after the first guy left. 
---
Also don't report DCs, it's an automated system, if their DC percentage gets too high they get banned. But honestly i think they should lower that percentage. Why play if you're going act like that? SMH
---
Like Billy? Or on a meme kind of fast?
---
Like billy with speed hacks.
---
because then she'd be a "cow"girl
---
I'm the same way. I am being nice and giving you freedom, do not screw around or I will revoke that freedom.
---
turn up your volume or get a better headset (or a headset if you dont have one) because even Puppers says Piggy is adorable. &amp; tbh her mask shouldnt be that thick being it looks like its made out of silicone 
---
the order of best to worst is somewhere in the shape of a 15,000 hertz sine wave
---
Bing Bong
---
As long as it doesn’t loop in people who accidentally DC due to connectivity errors
---
oh god. lmao new cosmetic
---
Empathy is a good one, I have some friends who are fairly new to the game and it’s very beginner friendly.

You didn’t even actually say “thanks”!

**We're Gonna Live Forever** - Each time you rescue or take a hit to protect a Survivor, gain 25 % stackable bonus to all Bloodpoint gains up to a maximum of 50/75/100 %. The bonus Bloodpoints are only awarded post-trial. Cost: 2000 Shards
---
**Empathy** - Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability. Dying or Injured Allies' Auras are revealed to you when within 32/64/∞ metres of range. Empathy does not reveal Auras of Allies when they are in the Killer's direct contact. Cost: 2000 Shards
---
**Knock Out** - The trauma caused by your brutal attacks makes crying for help painfully difficult. Dying Survivors' Auras are not revealed to other Survivors when they are standing outside of 32/24/16 metres of range. Cost: 2000 Shards
---
**Territorial Imperative** - Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability. Survivors' Auras are revealed to you for 3 seconds when they enter the Basement and you are more than 32 metres away from the Basement entrance. Territorial Imperative can only be triggered once every 60/45/30 seconds. Cost: 2000 shards
---
So nothing new this week for those of us trying to get an easy 250k BP. Besides WGLF none of these are particularly useful, and besides WGLF it's aura aura aura week!
---
almost everything in the game is near impossible to balance from a fundamental standpoint.
---
Boy I'm bouta Stalk that booty to Tier III and moonwalk all over them cheeks
---
Agree, ‘cause I don’t have any friends 
---
That could work for a Werewolf or Beast kind of killer, like an uncontrollable burst of speed or like an uncontrollable charge
---
WGLF isn't garbage, but I'm pretty sure everyone who wants it has had it for a while now.
---
Needs to be any key other than the broken key( I forget the names ATM) if it’s a broken key you have to use an add on that lets you open black locks. 
---
When you find the hatch and have the key in hand you press R1 and it’ll open up and you automatically jump in
---
exactly. bc you know im right. 😉😘
---
Thanks!
---
&gt; Doesn't give you the right to ruin both my game and the remaining survivor(s) game as well.
---
I paid for this game to have fun. You better believe it's my right to go and do something else when I'm not having fun.
---
Holy moly thats garbage
---
😤😤😤😤
---
Electric boogaoo
---
My jaw is on the floor rn, holy shit
---
I personally wouldn't use it but it'd be nice to have for sure.
---
😌😌😌
---
Trash
---
This is the only time I truly get salty in this game. It's like some dudes just wait for the wrong moment to try and pull you off and had 10 minutes beforehand while the killer was chasing someone else but decide to do it with the killer basically breathing in your face. 
---
Lets see how many big brains show up
---
1/10 list, there's no photo of Nea :(
---
When’s the next DLC?
---
Wait, wait wait, how did you place Clown's knife above Michael's knife?
---
The game has never been in a better state.
---
Maybe don’t go around smacking people with metal dildos smh /s
---
I swapped to apex for now :/
---
Suck it up.
---
First of all, it shouldve given the trap disarm action not the cleanse totem action like it did, second of all, the only way that trap makes sense is if the trap was inside the ground, which can happen, when it should be above ground. You are taking crazy pills. They're supposed to be hard to see, not impossible.
---
I will find a way to disconnect. *unplugs internet* fuck.
---
A red one, no less. Pig is Edward with a wig confirmed!
---
A lot of people also learn better when they feel like they’re playing a fair game. Whether you personally think swf is fair or not is a different story, but if the person trying to learn doesn’t think they have a chance in the first place then any mistakes they make will be attributed to just having the odds stacked against them anyways.
---
For perspective, imagine you’re trying to improve your chase game as a survivor but you get matched against a legion with franks mixtape and cold dirt. You’re still gonna make mistakes you need to improve on, but you won’t take anything from that match because it doesn’t feel like your actions mattered, and quite frankly they didn’t. That’s how a lot of killers who are trying to learn view swf, and reasonably so.
---
Yeah OPs posting old footage for them fat karma gains I think.
---
"Super hard" 
---
Looks Super 
---
Thicc
---
Haha I guess it always seems longer when you’re in the heat of battle. 
---
bet
---
i bought 3 feet of rope and im boutta dc IRL right now
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otBNYc0lJ6Y
---
Third seal is great, I run Sloppy if I also run NC, and Franklin's is hilarious  on legion.
---
Hm. Now I want to play a slugging build when I get home from work.
---
Not really I kinda figured I was dead, didn’t expect to find the hatch tbh so I just kinda ran 
---
It'd certainly be an interesting change.
---
Surely you mean Myers. According to the messages I get  "only trash killers use OP Myers"
---
&gt; cant disconnect if its in real life
---
thats where youre wrong kiddo
---
That made me reflect on my life journey. Thank you kind fog wiseperson
---
Damn, I wish we had it as a common
---
I actually successfully did two today but I think it's just because the killer was too distracted (I was super lucky)
---
no spoiler tag. get yeeted
---
Fair enough. At that point you're just proud to have kobe'd and avoid that chainsaw.
---
I think hag should be up a tier and leatherface should be down a tier
---
Switch trapper and wraith. 
---
We got Ruin recently, so we will have to wait a few more months until something good shows up again.
---
darn
---
Some time in March.
---
Holy, I want that mask so bad
---
Does it take time to open, or is that instant?
---
Oh no, get ready to get farmed even worse than normal 
---
Red trackpants Meg &gt;&gt;&gt;
---
Thanks so much for going in depth! I’ll keep at it with The Pig :)
---
Trapper is the jock bully. Wraith is the kid that was bullied and no how it feels
---
The mask looks way creepier than the one in the game. I love it 
---
sources? 
---
Empathy: Well, if you're gonna level up Claudette for self-care anyway no need to waste shards when you can just grab it along the way.
---
Same for Were gonna live forever and knock out. If you want BBQ or dead hard then just snag them on the way.
---
 *looks at Survivor for 0.00001 nanoseconds*
---
"Fucking toxic Killers always camping, noob killer, git gud"
---
That’s lame so they tunneling in a sense
---
:(
---
That's what I'll tell them as they're eating my dogs shit
---
I feel like Myers deserves his own separate teir of evil. He is the literal embodiment of evil. The others have reasons for being evil, myers doesnt. Hes evil because thats just who he is. Evil. 
---
Suplexing. 
---
Could also serve as a Resogun meme. 
---
Didn't waste time and actually did something, as I mentioned I run into way too many of these and most of them are just lets stare at eachother for hours on end doing literally nothing until one of us gives up and jumps / swings.
---
Horrorfield and dbd arent clones. While horrorfield has the same general idea of "hooking" survivors and finishing gens, opening gates to escape the killer, it plays out very differently then what dbd matches do. It's progression is also different, I occasionally enjoy the game, especially because my phone can't run identity V while I run horrorfield just fine. The person who made the game was inspired by the concept of dbd, in game, it does not play the same.
---
No worrries, and good luck! The more you play the more you will develop your killer instinct and gain map knowledge. I would try all the killers out a few times before rank15 after that you won’t go back and people will be better the higher you get. 
---
I didn't say they couldn't camp, just said that's why less BP and less fun gameplay doesn't make them not want to camp. Didn't insult the killer either, don't assume I'm being salty or toxic please because I'm far from that.
---
Good I needed BP anyway. Would love brutal strength to show up eventually tho.
---
I’m pretty sure lunges are based off move speed (or they used to be?) so that means all of the killers with standard move speed have the same lunge
---
Yes
---
Reeeeeeeeeerr
---
Pretty much instantaneous. Once you press “open hatch” you can’t go back. There’s a small animation to opening the hatch and jumping in, but it’s relatively quick!
---
pretty good job so far
---
Just saying that survivors should just not give the killer what they want
---
Holy shit this is a fantastic cosplay, well done!
---
Me if I was in dead by daylight
---
You sound pretty nerdy and lame right now
---
Imagine being leatherface or Hillbilly and being placed on the hammer list instead of a chainsaw one.
---
Oh I only use shards to get blood points from the shrine all my characters are leveled up. 
---
The only useful ones are wglf for those who want it ASAP and knock out for those who can’t buy dlc. Wouldn’t really call knock out worth anything, but more perks is never bad especially when dlc isn’t an option. 
---
):
---
Um
---
Is it ok if you have borrowed time 
---
Bing bong
---
When I see a squad of 4 P3 Claudettes, I know it can get much, much better. 
---
tea-bags irl infront of you
---
It's my understanding that no aura perks work in lockers.
---
Accurate
---
I mained Wraith  ^by ^virtue ^of ^repeatedly ^getting ^tons ^of ^dailies before Freddy was a thing... without any perks except Monstrous Shrine 1! ^and ^without ^much ^success ^unless ^chancing ^upon ^potatoes
---
it’s common that the first 2 gens are popped fast. you just need to start getting the snowball effect as soon as the first person is hooked, since then someone had to leave to save, someone’s being healed, etc etc. basically the more you get into the game the less survivors are gonna be working on generators.
---
😎
---
They retconned that. Hes no longer cursed. 
---
im still waiting for a killer with a hook for a hand
---
unless you cum in my eyes
---
It can be heartbreaking when it comes at the wrong time though. I had someone who apparently had it right after I downed her. She popped up and I whack-a-moled her right back down.
---
Noed sucks when it works. I was ayingn against a pig that tunneled trap survivors, and patrolled boxes instead of gens. She played horribly, but noed saved her ass and she got a 3k. As a pig main myself it bothers me when shit killers get a get out of jail free card because of noed.
---
yes taking a direct hit from a pallet 
---
So if he sacrifices him, will his glasses respawn?
---
Cries 
---
but glad i dont need to spend any shards yet HAHAHAHAHA
---
Freddy always seeing you doesn't matter because its dumb easy to escape dream state. Why Freddy is bad is because every single killer tunnels with him (which they have the right to because hes bad) and getting found first basically means you lose every time, or you don't get found first and you just hold M1 on a gen for 5 minutes till your team dies and freddy NOED's you
---
Sounds like maybe I should just skip the Obsessions. I really appreciate your response.
---
5 billion dislikes incoming
---
This isn't a very good one. Only one teachable from a dlc character and it isn't too good. 
---
Empathy however is my favorite aura reading perk and I recommend picking it up. 
---
Oh yeah watch I'm going to DS my neck! GG EZZZZZZ
---
If you tunnel with freddy you're doing it wrong
---
No no, Jack Slash TALKS to the Entity, he’s NOT the Entity.
---
the fact skill checks really aren’t that hard. a good first 10 hours i got a muscle spasm every time i did a skill check while it really wasn’t needed
---
Because most hatch standoffs have the killer behind the hatch so that you can jump in and they can grab you
---
I’m not being sensitive lol. I just think you throw away the privilege of not being publicly shamed when you put your content on the internet. That’s all. 
---
Seems balanced
---
honestly. I could get down to this. I really like the idea of survivors having to find the sleeping body of their friends. However i think survivors making no progress on gens while they sleep will make things a a lot harder than they need to be
---
Does Steam recently played with list work for DbD? If it is supposed to work, any ideas how I fix my bug?
---
It still doesn't help that Freddy can't stop someone going to tap a 99%'d hook in his face. Just because one happens doesn't excuse the other.
---
I'm considering going back to battlefield for a bit. Thankfully people are still playing BF4
---
How tall are you? Spot on legion cosplay!
---
It's an "instrument of punishment". 
---
O god, 4 Man SWF with adrenaline is worse than DS in my opinion. 1 Gen left as nurse so im sweating in my boots and i manage to slug 2 and I'm chasing another when they all instantly heal and i get 0 kills.
---
How can I drop a survivor I’m carrying on PS4?
---
how dare? joey and frank are obvious twunks. 
---
Tbh I'm surprised we haven't had a scythe-wielding Killer yet.  
---
Thanks!! I’m 5’11”
---
Spirit is WAAAAA
---
I would put Pig lower. Probably move Wraith to C tier. 
---
Michael shouldn't be with freddy or clown if thats how we are defining evil. Michael gains no pleasure from killing and lacks any emotion whatso ever for anything. He kills because its just what he does. He is the embodiment of evil. He is pure evil.
---
She went through a connection spike when she pivked me up. Then it glitched out and put her head up my ass.
---
not good per se, but woth the right add ons he can be really annoying to play against. he does rely on them a but too much, though.
---
It's debatable. Clown's knife is said to be designed to inflict pain. Michael's knife is just a regular kitchen knife, which while perhaps larger and deadlier is probably not as painful.
---
Michael's Knife is a 5 in deadly and 3 in pain. Clown's knife is a 3 is deadly in a 5 in pain.
---
Pig has a shorter lunge range than other Killers and Trapper has the longest, is what I've been told. I don't have any source for that though.
---
Right when i buy leather face for that perk you guys release it lol
---
Complaining about tunneling is ridiculous 
---
Sometimes you just have to trust us killers. I will give up the hatch when I can. :)
---
It kinda looks like a-[AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA](/intensifies)
---
I'll just kermit!
---
Someone needs to update the wiki then as that still reads as: Azarovs Skull. Which personally I like better than axe since it has more of a blunt look to me. 
---
I want a Pig plushie now.
---
Really? I thought you would buy leatherface for BBQ&amp;Chili
---
You say people are ruining it for you, but by playing legion you are ruining the game for survivors 🤷‍♂️. Kinda hypocritical.
---
Stop playing swfs and you will never get better change my mind 
---
Circle. 
---
i see your 
---
REEEEEE'
---
and raise you
---
Raaaaaaaaaa'
---
\*Eats the barrel of a gun\* ...... you think i  wouldnt dc from real life ? .....go feral and the next thing you hear is a \*BANG DC\* Sound !
---
Ardetha has a video which has contains a clip from something a dev says about it. Not sure where the clip is from so watch this instead: https://youtu.be/ug0ukux67N8
---
Will the clown be free?
---
I don’t think there legally aloud to sell that if they have dead by daylight in the title and it’s a exact replica
---
Funny when you killer annoying as hell when it's one of your teamates
---
Yeah. I’ve just had experiences with assholes standing directly on it, for forever, just to secure a 4K
---
'One of the best in the game' but only works once.... Would rather have multiple use perks than a 1 time use thats situational for only facecampers (and if you have deliverance actually active)
---
If you like speed and stealth, either keep playing with Pig, or try the Wraith, maybe even spirit and Myers. Honestly you're gonna have a little trouble without good perks, it's just inevitable. You don't NEED ruin or bbq but they are nice. It's better to have the most variety so you can switch up your perks depending on your add ons and whatnot. Bbq is really gonna help you in the long run because of the blood point bonus and I highly suggest getting it but you don't need it to have a good gameplay experience. 
---
I get why people say adrenaline is a crutch, but it's very situational and really only comes into play if the killer was already going to lose.
---
Kill me daddy 
---
It makes sense to dodge in some situations. It depends on the killer and build you're going for.
---
And you don't have any obsession perks, so you just die and can't have fun.
---
Just because I can't DC doesn't mean I can't DS 
---
I dont know how to explain better than "if you go straight to unhooking you get yoinked aka grabbed aka you are now on a hook as well" capitche?
---
The mask is sick
---
EWWW.
---
So is he Freddy tier basically?
---
Im not shaming. I just fond it funny how he went back to the same spot and same pose. He is in the green rank btw.
---
Haha the newspaper made this for me
---
It still makes a sound
---
True, though that's what the devs are there for. To playtest these things and say "this just doesn't work"
---
you wanna bet?!
---
This makes a lot sense. Thank you!
---
You can't stab me if you get shit first \*taps forehead\* ;)  
---
Great Cosplay my dude, looks fantastic!
---
Freddy in kinky? Oh, who's that knocking on my door at this hour?
---
Hahaha, Thrill Kill Kult is perfect for this one. Good job. 
---
Honestly against a half decent killer camping theres nothing you can do with BT, hits you once before you unhook (Or you could get grabbed) Then after you unhook he hits you again and you go down.
---
depends on your rank. from my experience he becomes better the higher your rank, as at rank 1 killers know how to play him more and use more add ons that make him difficult to play against
---
How did you know I had MC WiFi? You had the same experience?
---
I like the "2: The Electric Boogaloo" touch you added onto it. 10/10 my guy 👌
---
And I agree with that. But my point is it's against the sub rules so why is this even a thing anymore.
---
Playing SWF allows me to actually get better at the game, not get farmed as soon as i get downed or get hooked and get pushed into 2nd stage or death stage and promptly lose (This happens too much)
---
That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard in my entire life lmao
---
Imma commit dc
---
Console optimization wat
---
How can you not have made Violets Clown Couture into the Clown?
---
She's basically the Killer you play if you've got a daily or _really_ want to be mean to Survivors.  
---
But how you gonna teabag them if they aren't bleeding out on the floor? 
---
I bet if someone punched you in the face and you were really upset and you hired an attorney and built a case for pain and suffering that the attorney of the person who punched you would make an argument that it was justified - and after much work showing the video just who legion is to the jury, that the person who punched you would get money in a countersuit.
---
What program do you use to edit your recordings mate?
---
Beginners use to level Claudette first for self care so its also useless for them
---
Should I perform a Mori on him?
---
🤔 Friend spectated him so they suicided then. Either way why didn't you bring the killer to him and point
---
*WAH*
---
Best of luck with it! 
---
Excuse you sir how can you not have piggy be the best with doctor being the second best for his stupid fucking giggle
---
That map in general is horrible for Freddy's vision. Add Murky Reagents and you can barely see two feet in front of your face.
---
That’s a cute outfit . Did your husband give it to you?
---
She urban evaded out of the tier list to killers
---
True the issue I've found with most SWF that aren't very good is they are wayyyy to altruistic. I also play my nurse whenever I see a 3 or 4 stack join so that doesn't help them either. 
---
But It makes those unhooks that would have been fine very unsafe and they always want to help their buddy. I can just turn and put them back up on the hook in 10 seconds because they cant wait for me to get too far or to hear the two blinks for fatigue state.
---
this shit is really fucking nice
---
great job dude
---
If I can, I’ll just run to the nearest gen and try doing it, if they afk on hatch you can just uae the gate
---
Ayye
---
Fairly good, knife looks stupid though.
---
Sadly bad Pigs who never use her dash at loops and just tunnel the only person who has a trap on their head are way too common. She gets a bad rep as a tunneler because of it when her kit is conducive towards not tunneling.
---
I play on console. I’ve noticed that when I join other survivors on a generator the progress bar is red which usually indicates that something is slowing us down, but it shows up even when there’s no reason for it to (no Thanatophobia, for example). Is this a new visual bug or was some sort of change made?
---
He really loves that wall
---
Killer: Rancor
---
That isn’t fun at all
---
That's fair, I still think he was tortured by the entity due to the massive steel rods impaled into his limbs
---
Yeah it's a bug. They nerfed how fast multiple survivors can repair a gen, and instead of showing the new normal speed the game displays ad if it's being slowed.
---
Bïňğ Bøńģ
---
Hold O. Same for dropping items while playing survivor.
---
Oh ok, was very concerned that someone was rebellious 
---
I love this
---
I think that Freddy should just insta more everyone the second the game starts. 
---
McLean said in his latest stream (or the one before, can't remember) that everyone at BHVR knows that Legion's ability needs a rework, but they are busy right now with the new chapter, an endgame second objective and then they have to do the Freddy rework. So it wont come by soon.
---
Myers is very perk dependant. Some obsession perks actively encourage it but I find that most Myers don't seem to tunnel much.
---
Bollocks
---
Okay if you base your entire build around slugging
---
Well that's a real one-two. It's good to know it's at least in the pipes, that's better than nothing. I appreciate the news yo. 
---
Guess until then it's time to pick up Pig. 
---
Death is not an escape
---
Yup
---
I was fully face camped by a Billy for looping him for the first 3 gens on Haddonfield. He called me "a noob for using a safe loop". I almost peed myself - was I supposed to be uber and use an unsafe loop?

What is the recommended 'way' to use Dead Hard? I have the main issues of dead hard-ing past a pallet, or mistiming it and end up being hit before activating it. Is there a 'way' to time it well? 
---
Why are there two light things in the same outlet?

Finally, some good fucking content.

That was adorable and you can't tell me otherwise.
---
It's one of those hidden steam achievements. You can see it if you click on "View global achievement stats". Basically you and 3 other survivors needs to escape through the hatch at the same time.

One is for night time, don’t judge my lifestyle
---
I've seen that one before. Why did they make it hidden? Or am I just confused and it's always been hidden? 
---
that is not toxic though
---
Outplayed... And your teammate could have body blocked better. 
---
Why is angry Hunter lady so low on the list? She makes the exact frustrated sound anyone would. You know, when you get hit by surprise DS. 
---
Legion is cancerous to play against 
---
I have that same training knife for my Leon Kennedy costume
---
...you realize that the killer's goal in the game is to get kills, yes? As long as they achieve that goal I fail to see how that makes them a "pussy". Sure, it can be very annoying for survivors if the killer camps or tunnels, but a killer has to kill and a survivor has to survive. Those are the goals.
---
&gt;Wasn’t gonna respond to you cause you seem p hostile yourself. But I’ll give you some context.
---
I seem hostile because I'm not praising your behavior nor am I amused by it? Do you consider parents and teachers as hostile whenever they reprimand you for unnecessary actions?
---
&gt;If you play killer, you know that sometimes, yes— survivors will do this— “hide and go seek”, but in a malicious way to waste the killers time
---
If you played any game in general, you would understand that not everyone plays the way you believe they play. This person, that you went out of your way to message with ill intent, was being sneaky because they were afraid. Even I play stealthy at times if I know that I won't make it if I get caught, but I have to deal with people like you who believe I'm only doing it to *waste their time*—as if their time is more valuable than everyone else's—or to be spiteful.
---
It's akin to those imaginary rules both Survivors and Killers make up to accuse them of being this way because they are playing that way or doing this or that action. Who are you to dictate how a person should play a game if the play-style doesn't violate any rules?
---
&gt;Because we ARE at rank 9, I assumed this. I main survivor and I’m at this rank as well.
---
&gt;&gt;It shouldn’t be too far fetched for me to assume that if you made it into green ranks, it felt like holding the game hostage.
---
You do realize there are quite a few ways to play this game that isn't "malicious", unless Survivors or Killers deem it so with their imaginary boundaries, regardless of rank, right?
---
Just because someone is playing carefully, because they respect the killer's skill enough to be afraid of them, doesn't mean they are holding the game "hostage".
---
It's like you believe the game has to be played one specific way and every other possibly is toxic and invalid—especially if it extends how long the match lasts.
---
&gt;My message, while passive aggressive, was just to give them the boot. 
---
Your message, while certainly passive aggressive, was unnecessary. Give yourself the boot if you get agitated by having difficulty finding someone who is good at hiding.
---
Again, you knew what you were getting into when you queued into a match of Dead by Daylight.
---
&gt;Edit: And no one is pretending I wasn’t salty. It’s been pointed out numerous times.
---
No fucking shit. That does not magically make the plethora of comments praising you and being in awe invisible.
---
&gt;But I’ll give you some context.
---
Also, none of this was context. It was an explanation on how the majority of Survivors play to waste time with the intent on being malicious and how rank is somehow the determining factor on what type of play-style you believe everyone should be using at that rank.
---
Context would be a detailed description providing what the survivor was doing in the match, what the survivor said to you that wasn't shown in the screenshot, and anything else that was not provided within this entire post.
---
If there was actual context that shows this survivor being toxic toward you such as rigorous teabagging and hateful messages, I would have rescinded what I said and apologized to you, but that unfortunately was not the case here.
---
I mean if you do it to a guy right off the hook or target a specific player then yah I guess but otherwise it’s not really tunneling so much as just overall cheap
---
eh it wasn’t that bad, pretty silly
---
Doesn’t matter. You didn’t include legion. Brilliant Move 
---
That’s amazing haha

Dwight’s are usually my saviors. It’s usually Claudette’s and maybe David’s for me
---
I don't have BT yet myself, but I am hesitant to grind Bill for it any time soon. From what I gather, BT only works when unhooking within the killer's terror radius. So I would imagine that there are plenty of ways for killers to camp hooks without having BT activate.
---
It’s actually 50% each box

Definitely could have blocked better for me, but those DS hits should have gone through, can't wait for dedicated servers...

where is nea?

Why not "Chainsaw"? Also Wraith has a crowbar

Pretty much anything
---
But generally
---
T-Bagging and not leaving at the exit gates
---
Camping when it serves no actual purpose and your doing it out of spite
---
Purposely focusing one survivor out of spite 
---
Only if you plan on winning by slugging everyone. Even then swf negate that completely 
---
He’s a 14 day old R/The_Donald user. I’d be dissapointed if he *wasn’t* hostile
---
So what did you make, did you forge the knife? Did you stitch the clothes? No offense it’s a good cosplay and whatever but everything was pre made
---
I thought the percentage may be 50% but the 1 out of (jigsaw boxes left) makes more sense to me
---
Things make a lot more sense now,where'd you find that out since I couldn't find anything about it on the pig's wiki page.
---
The crossover I didn't know I needed (I read this like Trixie lol)

would not matter. he just kept dropping you perfectly on time

But then you realize they're a Sabo squad
---
Didnt know im sorry :((( lots of stuff gets posted i mustve missed it
---
Amazing! The mask is a bit too thick and round tho
---
10/10 would play a multi killer game mode with more survivors.
---
Some people are just assholes by nature.
---
I've never understood why people think its toxic for survivors to stay at the exit gate. I think its nice that they give free hits before leaving.
---
Now fucking around, throwing rocks and shit while knowing killer doesn't have noed or looking for hatch. Now that I think is toxic.
---
I don’t count perks though ds and noed can be annoying at times. What about mories are they considered toxic?
---
Sounds like working with the killer, bad farming, or trolling
---
Thicc boi would be too high even in F tier.

Annoying but fair game definitely not balanced

Almost all pig matches they are tunneling trapper survivors. And they can’t even get the trap off because she will go right for us at the boxes!

---
Whoa, settle. 
---
I feel like you’re digging really deep into this and attempting to find some sort of gross toxicity entrenched in my message that simply doesn’t exist. 
---
I was annoyed I spent 20 min looking for a surv, and because in the past, people have done this to be toxic, yeah. I made the judgement call that it was a likely scenario.  What else am I supposed to say?
---
I agree with you in the sense that I could have just not sent a message and waited. Genuinely. But if I didn’t send the message, I wouldn’t have realized that people who play still get scared. Like some other people have mentioned in this thread, it often becomes, “another day at the office”.  Being legitimately terrified isn’t something you think about (esp at rank 9 around rank reset). That’s why this post is “wholesome”. Sending the message and the genuine response I got back did a hell of a lot better job at helping me understand than your pseudo preaching right now. 
---
According to the lore, he was welcomed by the circus like family. Yet he still felt compelled to kill. Can’t blame all of it on his father.

I always get my pizza at Dwight's for their absolute mad lad speed.

Wow, you got really into that.

&gt; He doesn't "seem" to enjoy it cause he doesn't externalize feelings
---
Yes, my point exactly.
---
You're also talking about the shitty 2007 remake. The original didn't have any of that, which makes me think that it's *you* who's never seen the movies.
---
You're right, shit happens when you're a dumb piece of shit that can't read. 😂
---
Knock out again? 
---
There needs to be system that warns you when you hit quit. That way the automated system knows when somebody hit quit vs then they actually dc.
---
Well for one 99% of the people who say they have your ip don’t. 
---
And two it doesn’t matter if someone has your ip it doesn’t actually show where you live and it takes like 10 mins to change it if they try and ddos you. 
---
It’s scummy and people shouldn’t do it but someone tracking down your ip means nothing.

I can read, I just didn’t read fully read it. Mostly focused on the drawing. And suck my dick😂🖕🏽

*Fantastic*
---
Noed nurses are disgusting. They pick the hardest killer but won’t even accept defeat. 
---
Does it make people feel good to cause someone to rage quit?
---
If someone isn’t as good as me, I don’t play as hard, I play a little easier for them (crazy right?). Anyways, I hope they aren’t discouraged, I’ve seen some good nurses on PS4 
---
[removed]
---
The clown is free through shards. He costs 9,000 shards. But if you are asking will he just come with the game and be free to download immediately. No, he will not. 
---
More companies should make games where you have freedom to create your own rulesets. I understand it is difficult and for instance in behaviour’s case they might have a small team and couldn’t spare the resources, but ‘use map settings’ games for Starcraft or Warcraft were so fun and ended up giving us legitimate amazing games like Dota or LoL. 
---
Like imagine if you could create game types that don’t even involve gens, a level with like a hundred lockers and one survivor and 3 killers that have to compete to kill him and they can attack each other just to fight over him. There is just a lot more creative fun games that could be made with the components of DBD
---
I don’t have a link but someone made a shitpost spotlight video for a “bee” killer. It was pretty funny and a dev (Mcote I think) jokingly replied “How did you know??” Or something to that affect. And thus: 🅱️ee killer
---
Lol I bathe in all the salt. Its fine
---
Claudette
---
Very True. At the same time a lot of beginners (myself included at one point) didn’t know the ins and outs about teachables, so the first character is most likely based on the cosmetics. 
---
No mother &gt; ds 
---
Fact
---
25% 4 people = 4 boxes. 25% if there's only 3 of you, 33% because there's one less box so on and so on
---
Wrong game, window breaking is in /r/F13thegame 
---
That's what you think *unplugs life support*
---
But seriously sweet cosplay also I read that you are 5'11 you could probably kick the actual legions ass
---
Rancor is an endgame free mori if the obsession is still alive.
---
I srsly think he quit cus he was embarrassed. Dont think it was rage!
---
are you testing me sir
---
Honestly, you’re better off without obsession perks just cause they are all wonky and eithe specific killers break them or encourage less than ideal play styles.

I’ve been trying to just enjoy a game and not take it seriously but I’ve been having somewhat of a hard time doing so
---
Imagine if the reflection was also staring at you
---
My team has been after the "Where Did They Go?" Achievement for months. Time and time again, we have escaped at the same time to no avail. Eventually, we gave up. Then, half a year later we got a lucky game and all escaped through the hatch. We all got the achievement. The only difference I could think of is that we all escaped at very different times. If that is the case, that it requires everyone *not* escaping at the same time, then it's probably best to not have "...escape at the same time" in the description. Very confusing achievement.
---
Number 17....
---
Unless you consume the item during the match, you always keep it when you escape. The white ward ensures you keep it if you die as well, again, as long as you don't consume it.
---
Yeah, it's a reality show.  Some of the queens are just hanging out outside the studio smoking, and the "levitating" girl is just sitting on an extension of the railing that you can't really see that well.  :P
---
Hey OP, do you take constructive criticism?
---
If so, you’re pathetic.
---
“I made a cosplay with clothes I bought”

For real, you’re calling this guy a bullshitter over a cosplay consisting of a hoodie, a leather jacket, and some pants. Stuff you find in stores. Ffs he’s not wearing some bought trapper overalls or a huntress safaran. Stuff that isn’t bought in stores. The cosplay is low effort because the outfit of The Legion is low effort.
---
That's cool I wreck noed Legions all day 
---
Expensive sure, but he has a lot of stains so he is pretty sloppy. 
---
Calling your own video funny in all caps on Reddit is probably the closest you can get to rock bottom without paying people to watch your videos 
---
Thank you so much! I have a couple white wards and I’m scared to use them incase I escape with the addons. Again thank you :)
---
Yeah, and I wish there was a better way to sort by pictures!
---
YOU HAVE THE PESTILENCE 
---
This actually sounds like a funny perk to use against someone and kinda game breaking

---
So even if I dont use a white ward and escape Is still keep the item AND the addons?
---
Half of these can be considered rap ad-libs
---
doing gens, you? 
---
make sure you've completed all of the gens if all 4 of you want to escape!
---
It’s a pretty shitty thing to do to your teammates yes. 
---
the game is incredibly survivor favored so don't get too discouraged. You're also dealing with rank reset and many of the survivors will have 100s of hours of playtime and full loadouts of top meta perks. If you really want to win, start playing nurse now. She's the only killer that comes close to being viable against top level survivor play, so if you do wanna stick with killer, she's your only choice besides becoming a god with hillbilly. 
---
For the basics, watch scottjund's how to run basic tiles video and watch top level killer players play (ardetha, zubat, marth, tru3, etc) and see what they do in terms of patrolling gens, winning chases and defending hooked survivors. 
---
You're also majorly behind the 8 ball without top level teachables. Enduring is basically mandatory on every killer except nurse. BBQ is a staple in 90% of meta builds. Same for hex: ruin.  Other elite perks include nurses calling and discordance. also, don't be afraid to use your add-ons and offerings. Some killers are basically useless without their premium add ons (looking at you, leatherface). 
---
I usually grab them off a gen once enough are finished so the hatch spawns and I drop them off there. 
---
No, your is correct. 
---
Thank you so much for your kind words!
---
Ace's "Too Sexy" Outfit
---
Electricity man, guy with hooks in his body, and a deformed hillbilly are fine but nurse isn't?
---
Uhh your right, killers don't DC when they see swf, they dodge the lobby b/c they have the chance. And trust me they dodge it A LOT. Survivors don't know it's the legion until the game starts. So don't act like killers mains are all tough lmao.
---
I only just got enough shards for a new perk and Monitor and Abuse is gone forever again...
---
I'm sorry, I just need his stupid, shitty achievement...then I'll stop playing him! ;$
---
Everything 
---
It’ll be back eventually. 
---
That said it’s far better to save shards for cosmetics and converting to blood points. Leveling up characters takes longer but is so worth it. 
---
Gens done, free game. But camping the basement is scummy af.
---
Why the fuck does this offend you so much? Get a life “snowflake”
---
Yes, it just seems like if you escape at the same time you won't get the acheivement, which is extremely silly.
---
Usually, yeah. But if you end up with two or more people down there well you just know a third is gonna come. Especially a SWF
---
We really out her praising toxic SWF groups now???(Planning on quitting, Tbagging, Just generally annoying)
---
Honestly, I can’t tell you to play a game you arent enjoying and if you want to leave be any legion, that’s your decision as a person. All I’m saying is when/if it happens in your games vs any other killer, it creates a sour feeling for both ends. Don’t put the happiness of strangers overs yours but if it comes back on you, just remember that’s how the other people feel when you do it. 
---
Lol
---
I never really touch the cosmetics. That said I saved up my shards to buy Spirit, so maybe by the time the new killer comes out I'll have enough saved up to get them without having to hand over my hard earned dolla
---
I got mine with using, hex ruin and thanatophobia, BBQ-chilli and dying light, it slowed the game long enough to tier up, Plus was on Giddions and finally had a good totem placement. Keep trying it will happen. It took me 10 times before I got mine and I was shocked I got it. 
---
I some Snapchat Killer memes here, thought I'd add to the cesspool, lol.
---
Also not a bad option (especially if you have no interest in cosmetics). 
---
“What did you do?” 
---
The best part 😂
---
The hammer is the more characteristic weapon of both LF and Billy?
---
Hmmmmm
---
And here you are cin0laing aboi t someone else's life because you feel insecure on your own. Fuck off
---
Well in that case you’re not pathetic after all.
---
Guess I did come off a little strong tho, meant it as a joke (“you’re pathetic” was the criticism) but I can tell it was made in bad taste more than anything, so that one’s on me.
---
Still tho, nurse is definitely harder on console than on pc, but she isn’t impossible. I suppose I just don’t like seeing people discouraging others from trying her, or labeling her as a bad killer on console. It’ll take several hours to get a good feel for the blinks, and it’ll take even longer to learn how to effectively use them, but it is doable with good practice.
---
Also, as you’re aware of, the whole brag about making someone so frustrated they’d decided that they didn’t want to play anymore was just... oof. But you seem to already know, so good on you for having empathy.
---
Because he missed 2 point blank chainsaws and was like “fuck These jukes”
---
Darn you're so good
---
You are toxic, you need to chill
---
Bill and nea
---
If you wanna play it like that Nurse is a flying, shrieking, ghostly abomination and if she chokes you during sex she isn’t going to let go
---
I tried to get this for 6 months, and I was so close so many time, but a David always ducked into a locker so I couldn't kill him.
---
One day I got it.
---
The I got it 3 more times, and those 3 were easier than a 1v1 on sheltered woods at rank 20.
---
Whenever I have a goal, like a daily or achievements, I can't get them for a million reasons.
---
When I am just messing about, I do so much better. 
---
Yah or spirit? 
---
I mean, just like be careful where you put that thing and you’re okay right?
---
Have you seen her Valentine's skin? Add a heart to that hole (or cover it up) and your good to go, some people like being choked rather than stabbed or fucking electrocuted during sex.
---
Yes! And if you find an item in the chest and die with it while using a white ward you keep the item as well!
---
&gt;I appreciate the time you’re taking to respond to every bit of my message, but it’s not necessary
---
The same can be said to you. You literally did say that you weren't going to respond to me, but you chose to do so anyway.
---
The time spent by someone who can type fast is minuscule.
---
&gt;You’re trying /really/ hard to have the moral high ground here. You can have it. I was a dick playing an online game and was humbled by a really cute response. Lesson learned and I’m obviously not the only one this has happened to.
---
I really don't care about having the "low ground", "mid ground", or "high ground". What I do care about is people like you going around doing this kind of shit and thinking it's okay—especially okay enough to post without some sort of backlash getting back to you for it. If I see something wrong, I speak out instead of sitting back and ignoring a glaring problem.
---
Do you expect everyone to smile and give you the responses you want on a **public** platform of many people with varying opinions and experiences? If you do, you're incredibly naïve.
---
It makes me think you believe it's okay to kick a random person in real life for playing a public activity in an unsavory way and expect to not suffer repercussions when someone else catches eye of it and approaches you. Would you talk to the cops or the managers of the place this way and say that it's fine because he didn't react in a bad way despite what you did to him? "Oh no, I'm not the only one"—but you are one of them that was actually seen causing problems for others.
---
&gt;It’s literally in the title that I was being salty—which can be synonymous with things like rude, bming, etc etc. I’m pretty sure I’ve “taken responsibility” at this point.
---
&gt;It’s human that a game I spend several hours a week on will have an effect on me. You don’t have to police me on morality. Judging by how much effort you’ve put into your responses, this game/community means a lot to you. It means a lot to me, too, so whether you believe it or not, this moment of frustration and the response it got really was wholesome to me.
---
Based on how you're responding, you don't seem like you have. Instead, you seem like you rather argue and defend your actions rather than accept that they weren't necessary and move on from it, but if you want to keep complaining then go right ahead since it's not difficult to respond with one hand on mobile.
---
It's also human to understand how to control our own emotions—especially those who seem to have very fragile and unstable emotions—to prevent ourselves from doing stuff like this. If you don't need "policing" then don't post shit like this within on Reddit, because there will be people who find stuff like this to be distasteful despite the outcome, and act a way that doesn't tell people you may need help.
---
&gt;Judging by how much effort you’ve put into your responses, this game/community means a lot to you. It means a lot to me, too, so whether you believe it or not, this moment of frustration and the response it got really was wholesome to me.
---
This is just how I type. I could not care less about this game's community, but I do care about people not treating others poorly, but good on you for actually taking that response to heart. Hopefully it will stop you from doing stuff like this, but I have my doubts based on what was said to me here.
---
This is revolutionary :0 Thank you so much for the info 
---
You accidentally typed Kate when clearly you meant Nea
---
No, I get that. But that is map dependent and dependent on how good a survivor is. If I know its a Wraith i'm not gonna put my self in a position to get bodyblocked. And many times, you cannot even get a bodyblock on the gen.
---
It's you who does not understand what I am saying.
---
This seems to be it.

Pretty accurate except i’d switch Myers and clown and move leather face down a tier 
---
Am I the only one that thought he had pineapple for his eyes 
---
Claudette for overrated, Ace for underrated (what a hunk)
---
Nea looks like the creepy uncle who wears his edgy nieces clothes when he is home alone.  
---
Freddy only kills teenagers. Clown kills for pleasure. Myers is the only killer who’s for no reason. He is the embodiment of evil.
---
You prevent another survivor from moving/blocking their path and making them get hit.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Ruin bbq enduring spirit fury 
---
pretty good, for me it is
---
S Tier: Nurse, Hillbilly, Spirit
---
A Tier: Clown, Myers, Hag
---
B Tier: Leatherface, Legion, Pig, Trapper
---
C Tier: Wraith, Doctor
---
F Tier: Freddy
---
Underrated: David Tapp
---
Overrated: Meg
---
Switch Hillbilly for Hag, Huntress for Clown, Leatherface for Doctor and put Legion up to B tier and that's pretty much mine.

Amazing!
---
Killing for no reason is bad. Being a pedophile, rapist and murderer is worse. Torturing people and literally driving them insane is worse.
---
All three are clearly evil, but they're not on the same level.
---
But I thought Freddy was a survivor...
---
I see autocorrect changed Meg to Kate, you should fix that.
---
I was talking about the face camp. Doesn't matter if it's the last kill or not. It's still bad .
---
The "Meta" builds work pretty good on pig.
---
My favorite is the "Endgame Slammer" build: NOED, Remember Me, Blood Warden, and then a Flex (usually Rancor or Ruin). Save all your traps until there is 1 gen left or gates are powered. It is incredibly effective.
---
For addons, the Ruleset No. 2 is pretty good, as are the ones that give you extra traps. You shouldn't really worry about using up addons however, they aren't as impact on the Pig.
---
No no no, now he can play the game.
---
That's funny as shit. I'm gonna start doing that.
---
Sometimes you get a daily on someone you never bothered to level before. As long as they actually put in effort, or even *gasp* communicate their lack of perks in pregame chat, then I don't care. I'm willing to help someone get a daily or an achievement done if I know about it.
---
Who cares about a virtual rating system anyways? 
---
Player rating,game reviews,movie ratings. Its all shite
---
better read than dead

My friends and I got it by all leaving through the hatch, but you can’t go through at the same time, only one person can go through, and then the next. So I’m not sure what you mean but there was a time recently that the trophy did not work correctly and actually the killer would get the achievement and not the survivors. So maybe that’s what was happening when you were trying to go for it and it didn’t work. 
---
it's just helpful tips :) 
---
Is this one of those things where you got facecamped by a Leatherface and now have this hatred for the killer or is this a genuine opinion you hold?
---
Swf teams like these are very rare. I have encountered swf at every rank and have over 1k hours in the game and only encountered 2 true sweaty tryhard swf. 2. Out of hundreds of games. 2. Reddit makes it seem like they are here all the time. They are not. And i myself play swf a lot. We dont even talk while playing swf. A lot of them are like that. They talk but its more casual. Just playing with friends. Not everyone is talking and communicating about the game every second

Can confirm. Happens all the time.

It makes it hard to play with your other killers that don’t have good perks.

True but no charicter hasn't changed there lore
---
'Wishing they could even be trapper' any one really wishing that obv just plays trapper instead
---
Yeah, I figured part of it was due to rank reset, the queues take so long even with that considered though. I've considered trying Nurse out, even though her ability seems difficult to learn. I'd like to at least get Nurse's Calling unlocked though, so maybe I'll try her along with Myers and Huntress since I've got a soft spot for those two.
---
I've been watching a decent amount of gameplay, usually survivor, so I'll try looking up some killer stuff as well. Thanks for the suggestions! 
---
I've hesitated to buy all the DLC outright since I'm still new to the game, but I did get Clown and Doctor, even if it was more for the survivors that came with them. I also picked up Hex Ruin when that was in the shrine, so I'll try and make use of that whenever I actually level up my killers.
---
after like 1000 hours you just don't care anymore tbh. game is more fun when you don't go into it with high expectations of the outcome and just do whatever. that's not to say we don't try, we just know when to chill out and have fun
---
I've never dodged a lobby as killer for any reason except connection issues.  At most I'll adjust my setup to account for a better team and then just not be an asshole in my playstyle if it turns out I was wrong and they aren't a well coordinated team.
---
Oh trust me it’s not just on reddit. People just dc or afk whenever I play Legion and it’s annoying to not want to just play a normal game. No Moonwalk exploit. No tunnel one guy and frenzy them to death. No Franks Meme Tape. I could even intentionally leave people to go Mend and just fuck off somewhere else but people see the Orange Bar and just instantly DC and it’s almost childish. Like I get not wanting to invest time into a game you won’t have fun in and by no means will I ever suggest someone play against a killer they don’t want to, but if you instant dc on Legion I have no respect for it. 
---
*has
---
Genuine opinion
---
If were talking WITHOUT Add-ons, yeah.
---
I'd love to see a WITH add ons tier list
---
Thank you! I love Shrine reset to make stories out of the perks. I can’t wait for next weeks exciting continuation. 
---
Solid reasoning for Legion then, I get that and can agree.
---
1. Hag takes more setup time and relies more on survivor mistakes than hillbilly, that's why she's a bit worse.
---
2. Huntress is better than clown IMO because her upmost potential is higher than clown's and generally is more effecient in chases
---
3. Legion is honestly a toss up, I think he's shit but I don't have the authority to tell you you're wrong
---
literally anything and everything  
---

---
He has an instant down, he's the best basement killer, his power lets him eat pallets, and if you face altruistic survivors you get a free 4K.  
---
I can’t wait to hear your bbq and chili story!!!! *sobs in a corner even though I already have it unlocked*
---
Can confirm, bloody Laurie’s are extremely good players.
---
Are you talking to yourself?

---
I didn't get the memo. Wish I was a good Laurie lol.
---
My big issue with Hillbilly is he can easily become just another killer when you get into the merry-go-round loops while Hag can simply look like she's setting a trap to make survivors run away.  Huntress is similar and she has some really, really bad maps that can fuck her over.  
---
imo something thats actually toxic is exploiting something or ignoring your real objective to make someone elses time less fun, or just being an asshole to someone for no reason in chat or messages
---
It was glitched for a while where even if everyone went through the hatch the achievement still wouldn't pop.
---
No addons, easier that way, plus addon quality varies GREATLY between killers.  For example, Wraith has AMAZING addons but he still is not very good
---
Clown just wants to watch his vhs porn and put your fingers in your mouth.
---
Challenge accepted
---
An easy instadown and pallet eating is fair. But billy can do the exact same thing + shit tons of map pressure. I don’t camp because I’m not shit at the game so “best basement killer” is meaningless and you rarely get overly altruistic survivors at rank 1. Maybe he’s good between rank 20-15 but outside of that he’s fucking useless
---
Her usefulness plummets on maps with high walls. She is very map dependent. Her humming makes it very easy to avoid detection. In situations where she can't hatchet, she is slow as shit and easy to loop.
---
Only changes I’d make are moving Wraith and Trapper to a new category, “Twunk”
---
because you never actually entered his fov
---
Downvoted for teabagging.
---
Here's the thing though, I tried to compare killers with constant variables.  Some maps can simply fuck killers, but that doesn't mean they are shit, it means the maps kinda are.  For example, trapper on the spirit map is SIGNIFICANTLY better than he is on Lery's
---
Sometimes, but also sometimes it's just a group of people sitting there waiting for you to watch them teabag. It's stupid.
---
My man, you've got a good head on your shoulders.
---
Everyone always forgets Laurie. Those Mom jeans are like 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
---
when is the pig buff that makes hatch pop heads gonna happen
---
I dunno a fast swapping Wraith can be pretty damn gross lol
---
Meyers buff is insane
---
My favourite of her many stun sounds is the 'Hey!' one: ["**Hey!** ArrrRRGHHRrrrr!"](https://clyp.it/sx0qevne)
---
AFAIK she's the only character who actually says an intelligible word in the entire game. Even the Hallowed Blight films only featured inarticulate grunting.
---
"An easy instadown and pallet eating is fair."
---
Hence why he's nowhere near F tier.  Thank you for agreeing.  
---
I've been banned for days from xbox because of DBD. Saying I sent messages that I didn't send, accusing me of sexual harrassment just because I didn't save teammates or actually killed people. 
---
“That motherfucker Phillip thinks he’s soooo hot just because he has a bell. I’ll show him!”
---
how does that store front bell even work
---
Good idea, that could be the reason.
---
My point is that the acheivement says that all survivors need to escape at the same time yet punishes you for actually escaping at the same time. Aka not giving you the acheivement. Sorry for the confusion.
---
probably yeah, survivors fucking hate killers
---
Since they changed the PS4 to change character with L2 or R2, sometimes the slightest bump to those will change the character, even when you are already readied up in a lobby, so the game can start before you get a chance to change it back! That happened to me and I was playing a newly level 10 (P2) Kate. Luckily I had added perks to her at all when I was doing her bloodweb. I was the only one who survived that match anyway even though I was panicked lol 
---
The line activates it.
---
That’s all he has though and billy has the exact same thing but better. billy out classes LeatherFace I’m every way. There is no reason to play him ever. He’s the second worst killer in the entire game and should 100% be in F tier 
---
Im so buying that mask 
---
One halloween imma just run through and take all the candy!
---
"Yeah I'll j-just go back to the wall.. Yeah, I'll be back with you in a second man..."
---
Okay but I don't get calling this a personal tier list if you're going to battle with who people perform better at.  It's like you're trying to present something authoritative but using the "in my opinion" thing as a back up.  
---
I've completely dismantled a lot more teams convincingly with Hag than I have with Hillbilly, and the same with Spirit.  This is just me, you may not, hence the personal part. 
---
Please be advised, video does not require audio. You are much better off not turning it on.
---
“Feral Frenzy bitches!!”
---
The same can't be said for survivor actually.  The killer can end the hatch standoff with gaining more bloodpoints for the hit and their pip and win since they killed 3 and won the game.  The survivor in that same example would choose to suicide into killers arms losing and probably not pipping.  I play a lot of killer and have never nor will I ever commit to a moronic hatch standoff.  It's boring, petty, costs you bloodpoints and more games played it's a loss in every possible metric. 
---
save the best for last is good on her, it strengthens her surprise attacks by letting her attacking after the first hit faster, sometimes they might just run into a wall because you made them jump, allowing you to get a free down. in general it lets you get to chasing them better
---
Where did I say Leatherface was better than Hillbilly or should be on his same level?  I'm saying Leatherface isn't F tier because he's not as good at Hillbilly.  If I relied purely on the worth of killers by their tier standings, every killer sucks cock compared to The Nurse.  
---
Can I edit it once it has been posted? I don't see a way to 
---
Why not both? They are a nice combo
---

Haha curb stomping killers because theyre imbalanced haha so comical.
---
Im not sensitive, I and other people think your post is crap. And if youre going to backpedal and say its a joke, well dont quit your day job, because your taste in jokes is garbage as well.
---
cuz they're rated what can I say
---
Leather face should be in F. He’s straight up dog shit. Also Nurse is only good on PC
---
That’s not what he said. Sometimes killers fake farm just to get ppl together to kill them faster 
---
Cover up the elusive fourth hole?  You're nuts!
---
Gonna go ahead and disagree with that comment. It doesn’t matter how good you are with freddy, you aren’t going to out perform an equally good bill, huntress, or spirit.
---
Best cheap part of the cosplay? A cassette labeled “Frank’s”. Bad feels 100% of the time haha
---
Appropriate that The Cannibal is Baby Face as he is probably, you know, wearing a baby’s face
---
This is relatable and painful
---
That's fine (I had a Wraith who made me finish 4 gens before killing me: I'm totally fine with that kind of thing). Heck, as I said before, I'm fine if the Killer doesn't farm at all, even though 2 people DC'ed after the game started.
---
What I'm talking about are people who don't let Survivors get anything done or get any points, they just use 'invitations to farm' as a way to troll. They grab people off of gens as soon as they start working on them, pull people off of hooks when they are trying to save, or they down everyone and make them sit out the 3 minute bleedout timer while nodding repeatedly and then say "EZ WIN STUPID NOOB" in the post-game chat/PS Messages.
---
Those people suck.
---
I’ve played both, my opinion is flip opposite of yours. I can do spirit okay but I am potato at landing blinks
---
Depending on your router, you can make all internet traffic on your network be funneled through a VPN.

Except farming is boring and not everyone needs BP
---
TBH, Axes would be scarier than hammers.

Woke: Rancor
---
Franklins, lightborn. Add on hangmans trick. Alllll the situational perks.
---
Strange that they would all have generally unused things that just happened to let them see where invisible gens were huh. 
---
Also gens always have set spots they pick to spawn so once you remember those then pesky invisble objective wont bother you anymore.
---

I apologize for assuming the gender of a formless embodiment of evil, that wasn't cool of me.
---
Ugh, I don't trust Google with so many download links to it, I have trust issues with links
---
Did you buy it somewhere or I'm lost?
---
Why’d you choose the lamest killer?
---
You should be ashamed, misgendering a tentacle like monster that kills you? What's wrong with people these days? It's 2019, the fog deserves some righteousness.
---
Funny that you don't mention pig, I constantly get messages from people describing how much I scared them with how I play her lol
---
Yeah he's the one regurgitating lines and then quitting when pressed... oh wait
---
It's cute when people go condescending if you disagree with them
---
Wraith's is pretty accurate.
---
Clown is severely overrated in his current state. More than 20 glitches that affect him specifically. If all that jank was fixed, yeah, he'd be good I say
---
Nurse is easy to you because you know how to read survivors which is 80% of playing her. After getting used to her blinks if you can read survivors you win almost every time.
---
If you can beat rank 1 survivors with standard killers then Nurse is definitely easy move. I typically reserve it for tryhard swfs and when I want to win after facing a squadette who wont leave when I run a meme build.
---
Ive seen these too, sometimes ppl are super angry and just dump it all on you. They should just take a break.
---
Crows are awful in both directions. On one hand they activate way too quickly when you're standing still (in Killer's TR) but on the other hand they literally will not spawn if you do anything to make the game think you're not AFK. Like freaking tap WASD lightly and crows won't spawn for 30 minutes.
---
In theory he stops loops, but in practice, over 20 bugs wear him down. Including a slowdown after the bottle throw, bottles sometimes exploding in his hand and the gas sometimes doing literally nothing
---
Yeah, I always take a step back and they just run into me before getting smacked 
---
Hag deserves to be A-tier. At least. Maybe move nurse into S+ and put hag and Billy into S
---
911 this is an emergency..
---
Cosplay is a very huge thing, and most cosplayers buy their outfits online. They’re all over eBay and are easy to buy. I think it’s legal as long as the people who own it are okay with it.
---
Basically everything has 3rd party sellers, it’s just merch. Pretty sure you can’t sue someone from merch (don’t quote me on that because I’m not actually sure)
---
Dude it's 3 instead of 4. It's a bigger deal to the survivor whether you escape or not.
---
Save The Best For Last. Every time you hit a survivor that isn't the obsession you get a token. Hitting the obsession causes you to lose tokens. Every token gives you a 5% cooldown reduction on successful, missed, and dodged attacks, up to 40%. The reason it's good for Dead Hard is because even if they dodge, you'll recover very quickly and down them anyway.
---
I don't understand how premonition works. I'm new and tried it for the first time last night, but went back it to Deja Vu II after three matches because I felt it was a waste.
---
Also, why is Deja Vu bad? I feel so comforable with it.
---
Wait, Freddy has a stun sound? I have never heard it
---
I don't usually have a lot of Legion games so I guess I find them rather novel. I'm also red ranks so it might be a regional difference.
---
That's not what I meant. I meant catch up to my current progress on PC. I started on PS4 and restarted on PC. I'd rather not start with all level 1s again when I could... not, and stay on PC.
---
B-b-b-bb-b-b clown good in chase...
---
I'm so surprised that everyone here thinks hes good tbh.
---
Ace and Adam underrated and Nea overrated
---
I mean... They're the easiest character to cosplay.  
---
Trapper and Bubba also are too high, Freddy and Legion are too low. Huntress and spirit are not on the same level as Billy. If you did, what I suggested in my first comment, leave huntress and spirit in A.
---
They’re not wrong
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
This gave me a good laugh. 
---
Jeez this is a perfect in every category except survival but you still got max struggle points. 
---
But that survivor escaped when he shouldn’t have. He was given a free win because there’s no interaction in hatch standoffs. The whole concept needs a rework
---
Just had someone DC against my garbage baby Nurse because I downed them before a generator was done. They were sprinting across the entire map and wouldn't even attempt to juke me when I blinked onto them. To put my garbage baby Nurse into perspective I've played her about 5 times total and my perks right now are Thanataphobia 1, Stridor 3, and Tinkerer 1 (don't even have 4th perk slot)
---
Their username was one of those typical blaming teammates names. You know the "gg useless team", "brain damaged allies", "unhook or I DC" type of names. (Won't actually give out their username because that's against this sub's rules.)  
---
All I can say is: buddy, I don't think that your allies are the problem here.
---
OwO
---
I love it...I was thinking about cosplaying as Susie. Out of all the DBD characters I think Legion would be the best to cosplay as. 
---
Its pretty annoying for the killer as well. Contrary to popular belief, getting an easy win just bc some salty loser dicked their teammates over isn't very fun. (Not to mention all the bloodpoints you probably missed out on)
---
dude just because you killed 3 doesn't mean you are entitled to 4. you have to work for it by either not letting 2 gens get done or finding the last survivor before they find the hatch. it's not a 'free escape' and often when playing solo, the hatch is your only hope
---
What does balanced landing do?
---
Just you fucking watch me
---
I mean what makes it apply to the meme? I use balanced landing lol, I’m no scrub 
---
There's thing that block aura's like seeing gens through walls and stuff, but nothing that should make it completely invisible to anyone on either side.
---
I guess I could see deja by being good for newer players to be able to find gens, but once you get comfortable with the game you should have zero problems locating them and so it becomes a wasted perk. As for premonition every time the killer is looking in your direction within a 36 meta range the perk will light up and you will hear a noise at the same time. Again, it’s not the best of perks once you get more comfortable with the game but when you go against a stealth killer like the pig it can be fucking beautiful. 
---
I wish more people were as accepting of fate. Dieing isn't always losing. 
---
Hey could you do me a favor... and.. not..
---
That billy ragequits over that? That’s standard gameplay for me when playing Billy.
---
Who knows? And i thought you were saying that meaning your own comment. My bad dude
---
...did you Rapal's Dark Res these names?
---
Not really. Offline mod with bots would be a option like Friday the 13th. Bots are horrible but atleast it could let me practice a new killer. 
---
I was going for referencing drag queen names - Minj - Cooch, Bin is pearl in chinese - allegedly at least, Clodetta is one of ways to say Claudette's name in russian. Also, I want Rapal Dark Res version of dbd now...
---
Yeah you want to find the killer that fits your playstyle.  I don't use billy myself, but there is no question that he is the second best killer.  Hag though, that's more my jam.
---
I have seen a few survivors quit early, after getting knocked down one time, too. Pretty weak. I used to mark them as a "unsportsmanlike" in the past - less so now.
---
Pull the lever, Billy!
---
If I knew who used the streamers I might be inclined to be a little more forgiving with them but I’m not farming. 
---
No nea? fuck this 
---
I wish people did gens in my games like they were red ranks.
---
The frenzy vault speed IS affected by perks such as bamboozle. Even over pallets (although the pallet doesn't get blocked, obviously). Highly recommend it.
---
The blade whipe cool down in frenzy is NOT affected by STBLF (but I mean it's so fast anyway so why would you bother) and you do gain stacks for STBFL while in frenzy. STBFL is surprisingly handy on occasions with legion if you are just looking for a quick down rather than a frenzy down. You basically always have a lot of tokens on you at any given time, so it's pretty nice.
---
I've never tried STBFL with Mad Grit, but I'm sure they do work together.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Can you press asdw while you're in the locker to prevent them?
---
If she’s breathes she’s toxic. 
---
Piggy on top and you misspelled "squeak"
---
Boxes aren't based on people. It's 4 by default.
---
It used to be that 110% ms Killers had a shorter range than 115% ms Killers but a semi-recent patch (Spirit i think) made it so that all Killers have the same Lunge Range barring Myers cause hes a special boye
---
Happens to me once almost every time I play 
---
And my hand! 
---
Wait so idk how to use freddy is he any good?
---
hes very entitled to 4 kills. im not entirely sure if you hear yourself here but he not only killed 3 others before enough generators were done to viably finish the rest but also managed to find the hatch before the survivor could. he can do quite literally anything he wants and itd be fine.
---
yup
---
I'm not saying waiting by the exit gates is 'toxic', I'm saying if they were toxic earlier in the match (unhook-rushing, flashlights, t-bagging) they normally wait by the gate. If they were fine, I just nod until they leave. If they wre toxic I give them a good send-off.
---
that is amazing good shit &lt;3
---
... because you might be forced to remove not one, but two masks during a match where you bully her again now that she's all grown up.
---
I had a wannabe “gangsta” mouth off at me before the match and I promised myself that I’d let him die if I had a chance. Turns out he was the one who got hooked right as the exits opened and I was the only one left to save him. 
---
I laughed all the way out the door.
---
Probably his own, from an alternative version of himself that failed to become a willing killer/servant of the Entity.
---
&gt;hacking on PS4
---
Would anyone else like to see some new global perks introduced? Not like a whole bunch but maybe just one or two. Some love for the people who can't afford all the dlc.
---
Omg Myers, what happened to you
---
If you don’t mind me asking what rank are you typically playing at? Against lower skilled survivors Freddy can be fucking deadly because they are way too afraid to actually expose themselves. Higher skilled survivors will almost instantly start running so you’re basically spending the first 7 seconds of a chase unable to hit a survivor. If a good survivor knows it’s a Freddy they will just hop of gens and get them done as fast as humanly possible because his map pressure is nonexistent. On top of that his power completely hinders his end game potential as he can’t get a last second down at the gate without that person already being in dream state which is problematic for what I’m about to say next. 
---
Most of the best killers in the game have a power that will help in a chase, which is the most important part of the game. Freddy’s power literally hinders his chases as you can’t even start them for 7 seconds unless your are running his best add ons and even then survivors still have time to get to a window or pallet before you have time to hit them. This means that most Freddy games have to have a focus on the end game and well, read the last sentence of the other paragraph. 
---
It’s certainly possible to some degree, but unlikely, I know. A glitch maybe?
---
Imagine see Myers playing games, so gorgeous
---
Killers who wanna camp are gonna camp regardless of where the hook is.
---
Yea, Freddy's perks are (mostly if not all) end-game perks. But boy can Blood Warden and NOED really fuck people over (aka me, twice, both times I wasn't even being toxic, just trying to get to an exit gate to survive, then bam)
---
I don't know about destroy, but salty people will report you. I rarely play killer but I have been reported a few times. If your rep is good overall, you should be fine. 
---
Yeah currently its good, and if it starts to dip ill go play some br game or something.
---
Then proceeds to run laps around the hooked survivor
---
I love playing nurse and I play on PS4. Actually, nurse is the first character I chose to get all the perks. I'm at a high rank and I can get some nice 4Ks. Not always of course, as I'm still practicing and not good compared to some I played against (there are a few god nurses on PS4 btw). I understand she's harder to master on console and hopefully this "miracle optimization pass" will help. The killer probably was still learning and got frustrated from the looping. Well, it happens, but please don't brag about DC and bullying, as you should know by now this game can make people stressed quite easily.
---
Nobel &lt;3
---
Why do the pathetic wildling devs suck complete and total ass-piss, and why is this community a bunch of cucks that worship them for it?  Fuck all of you.  
---
Him just standing there with the effects on the sides of the screen makes it look like a meme holy shit
---
The sad part is that this even happens at rank 1. Seeing this at rank 15 doesn’t surprise me. It’s normal that newer players are scared and inexperienced so they’ll hide
---
Would need a reverse bear trap to split them cheeks to get to the main course
---
Pretty accurate
---
No problem mate. You’re about to enter that rank where you’ll see survivors getting smarter where a low rank killer like Freddy won’t be as viable. That’s also not to say that you won’t run into worse survivors as high ranks but it’ll be a lot less often. 
---
I also think you’ll find survivor to be a lot more fun than you currently do the better you get at it. When I first started playing I fucking hated survivor because I just couldn’t run the killer around at all which made the most fun part of the game, the chase, super frustrating. Playing both modes will also make you better in the opposite mode too. When you learn how players on the opposite side think while playing you’ll be able to counter it more effectively to win your chases as killer or survivor. And you’re definitely going to learn from watching youtubers and streams so you’re already on the right path to improving! 
---
Nurse on console is still a good idea. 
---
Ah, okay. He must have found a very close hook since all four of us were there.
---
I thought he was AFK. Didn’t think someone would be scummy enough to use such a cowardly tactic.
---
One reason why Ace in the Hole, I feel, is a good perk to build up your item stash as well as in trial use.
---
Welcome to dbd

Some of them wear reversed bear traps...

TIL The thing next to David on the WGLF icon is a person, not a rugby ball. Wow.

Sadly seems like yes. You can get out of it by playing neverwinter idle since thousands of people will login and not report you.
---
Pretty bullshit though that microsoft still uses the system. I get the "Toxic player" thing where toxic people might be put on a low priority queue in games but that should be something the developer himself has to setup and support with their own system. Not "Well Bob here is playing with 4 other people in DBD, and each match all 4 other players report him, so he's gotta be toxic" and have it fucking carry over to other games. At least not without a microsoft employee checking it.
---
I did crack it like 99% of all sony vegas users, but just hit up a tutorial on youtube how to download+crack it+install it!
---
what glitches affect him? i was thinking of trying him out
---
"Clown looks like he's one fat joke away from crying."
---
That's an interesting take. To me he look soulless, like there's literally nothing in his eyes. There are subtle facial expressions he make when he attack the survivors, there's a hint of smugness? Very egotistical and narcarcsitic, a trait found commonly in serial killers. I could be reading too much into it, but his facial expressions are my favorite. 
---
Im only about 315 hours into the game and this tier list (with one change of Pig going down to C tier) is exactly what I am thinking. Huntress could be argued down depending on map choice, but thats about it.
---
Woa, this is worhtless! 
---
Play pig. Put on all the bear trapses. Run surveilence and ruin. Go to gen, cut whoever is working on it, kick gen and leave.
---
Repeat until they're all dead.
---
He has this "I've given up on life since Karen left with the kids. Time to eat my 4098th hungry man frozen dinner.... God i miss Karen..." look to him. 
---
This is wrong 
---
Uh...
---
I was hoping to find a suicide comment. I was not disappointed 
---
Yeah i dont understand that, but you used way too much emojis.
---
ace mains... big brains AND hearts..
---
Clown and Hag should be higher imo. And Legion is not that good tbh.
---
Next week teaser (rumor)
---
Getting chased the entire game while your team gets all of the gens only to get hit once but the killer has n.o.e.d and face camps you.
---
Discordance and overcharge too then, fuck it lol
---
You just made me shed a tear, that, that is what makes any killer main happy
---
Could have not been pretending.
---
Also its on you, for not playing safer.
---
With Myers, you’ve got to know when to chase and when to stalk.  Don’t solely go for E3, otherwise you’ll get smoked on gens. Build a little at pallets, and whack as you go along. Eventually, you’ll have a few hooks in, and will be ready to snowball with E3. 
---
Also, obsession perks aren’t that great overall. It usually takes time to get them to kick in, and in this game, time is the most crucial asset. 
---
The endless Mori is pretty rotten. 
---
Nice repost.
---
Wraith is easily one of the best killers in the game with add ons and the right perks. I love how he gets disrespected on everyone’s tier lists yet when I main him everyone says how OP he is. (Soft flex, srry).
---
Never found how to describe freddy's but you did it perfectly
---
the bell when rung puts whoever rung it into the spirit world that's why he has to use the bell to go invisible the entity cant just allow him to go into a different realm and back without a key (bell) and for your other questions I don't know
---
Freddy's just sucks. It only looks cool if you watch from the side and can see Freddy prepare himself to push his glove through the survivor's chest.
---
Funny how the Legion doesn't say anything intelligible, but the Huntress does.
---
I like your mask better than the ingame mask.
---
For survivors, David because no mither and wglf doesn't help you. You basically have 1 perk and you can be 1 shot. And Laurie because OoO.
---
For killers, nurse because I suck with her, Myers because his perks counteract each other and legion because his perks are super situational and legion himself sucks if you don't moonwalk or use Frank's mixtape 
---
Unpopular opinion but I liked old borrowed time better. Countered face camping as a killer and protected both survivors. As a killer I dealt with it because I liked the plus it gave survivors in unfun situations that killers can create whenever they want. Plus the only time i really got punished by it was the end game otherwise i always walked far enough away from hook.
---
I really enjoy playing as and against Legion also. While playing as him it just feels fast and satisfying, not to mention the BP gains I seem to get with him. I don't have all the killers or survivors maxed yet so I love the BP gains. And as for playing against him it just presents me a chance to try to develop a consistent strat to try to outplay him or just overall improve my survivor game. As for other character elements such as aesthetic and whatnot he is the coolest IMO. 
---
3 of them are non (paid) DLC perks. Darn. Time to buy cosmetics.
---
I usually do this when one of them is decent and the other 3 are so terribly bad I can't believe they manage to get out of bed every morning
---
How does Huntress and Hag fit into this?
---
Think trapper and wraith need to swap with the pig
---
4% this, bitch
---
Doesnt help because totem spawns
---
in the shrine of secrets, you can buy teachable perks you already own to get bloodpoints 
---
Don't try it
---
Im start a chase and the survivors are genrushing in 3. How am i supposed to even get a 2k if all the gens are done by the time i hook the first guy? Either extend the time or lower the survivor group boost.
---
Agreed. Throw away the whole post
---
Also, happy cake day 
---
95% of the time this is not what happens and the killer is just an asshole.
---
If a killer does not want to play, do not do it, but let play the others istead of fucking them.
---
Meh. Nurse at least takes skill. I used to think of Leatherface players as dumb but Legion takes the cake. 
---
I was going to say the same thing but less elaborated, just "give the camped survivor bloodpoints while being camped".
---
I totally agree with you. 
---
You only need dead hard for the last crouch
---
Yeah pretty much 
---
Seriously, stop self healing
---
Imperfections in the animations such as when they the models overlap make it feels funny for me. 
---
I always check survivors' steam profiles. Once, I saw an swf with 10K hours between them. I decided not to dodge. 4 D-Strikes, 4 Adrenalines, 4 Dead Hards and 4 Self-Cares. 0 kills. And 4 'gg ez baby killer' in the chat. Sometimes dodging is ok.
---
Fair, fair
---
Probably calm + distressing + unnerving + Overcharge doctor when the last 3 gens are in a triangle 30 feet from each other and the Doctor refuses to commit to a change. 
---
No 
---
Thanks lol
---
i'd rank Leatherface a bit higher, that first smack on the head never gets old
---
Spirit's goose yelling and Huntress' extreme angry yell arr the best imo.
---
IMO Yes. I play survivor and killer equally and I hate it when people DC when I'm the killer, likewise survivor. Just accept the add-ons and either learn to play to a killer's weaknesses e.g. Looping huntress round windows, T-Walls etc. or play more stealthy 
---
Honestly thank you for posting this. 
---
I made it to rank 2 survivor before this rank reset without knowing how to loop at alllll. Just being hella cautious and playing with sight lines. 
---
I'm going to have to practice this so I can waste time too :D
---
Same thing happened to me when i was playing trapper, survivors used me as blinding dummy :(
---
If it is bad, then why is it OK for all 4 survivors to D/C against a freddy? I play alot of both killer and survivor and I was just thinking about it from both sides
---
Doesn't irritate me when they do but I do lose hope and the will to fight if I'm downed
---
That is the problem. The game doesn't reward stealthy gameplay. It rewards chasing the killer around 1 pallet for 2 gens.
---
Don’t heal
---
Exactly.  A majority of streamers don't use his best shit and buy into the "lol long transition" idiocy like it's a religion.  Freddy has a way to directly turn his one weakness into his greatest strength with Class Photo, pair that up with Green Dress (and that's the yellow add on, not the far shittier Blue Dress) and you will now stall the game into the stone age.  
---
And calling Freddy's ability useless is lolworthy.  Yeah, 50% Dying Light when you're in the dream state is useless.  Fuckin' parrots. 
---
God that is terrible 
---
Yeah. I'd be irritated if I grinded for long enough to get the BP and bloodweb node for an ultra rare add-on and not get to use it because the survivors wimped out. 
---
Woah and then I get hit with a normal attack I wonder why that obvious counterplay didn’t work. Or I just get downed either way after 3 or 4 stabs.
---
forgot to mention this was with bishiecraft at [twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv) so follow her for DbD foolery and whatnot \^\^
---
Most likely, the killer and him are friends, which is a valid reportable offence since it's siding with the killer to farm. If it's Steam, it's quite easy to find out whether they are friends.
---
They might as well just givr Territorial Imperativr its own permanent slot at this point.
---
Keep in mind that DCing you are not punishing the killer (the killer does not gets your points and nothing else), you are punishing your teammates being 1 less in the team, what is penalizing them.
---
So yes, it is bad.
---
They don't seem to enjoy being dribbled or slugged when they have decisive. I personally get kind of depressed when leatherface repeatedly chainsaws me on the hook. That thing legion does with blood hound(or not), where they look down and lose chase on purpose so you have to mend even though they're on your booty. Kind of hilarious, but also a bit annoying. I actually kind of enjoy the torture if I'm being completely honest.
---
I approve of your perk build. Distortion and small game. I love them
---
Your character however..... Yeah I'm sorry 
---
The Survivor perks are alright but the Killer perks all all worthless.
---
lol
---
How does the free dlc work? And witch one is getting free next
---
Wow... How uncool. I would have farmed with you and let you escape for helping me out 
---
Yes. Making someone waste an expensive and rare add on is a dick move. Disconnecting in general for reasons that aren't connection issues is a really stupid thing to do imo and is a pretty big problem in the game right now. 
---
We have bigger fish to fry. Freddy is a ***literal pedo***.
---
Damn :( I was waiting for something good. This is shit.
---
You should never surrender just because a killer is running a build or item you don’t like.  For all you know, they suck ass and you’ll smash their shit in!  If it bothers you that much, to the point where you can’t even stomach to play any more and are willing to tell all of your teammates to go fuck themselves because you’re a spoilsport, just kill yourself... in the game, that is.  Killing yourself on the hook is (marginally) better for everyone, including yourself.  At least you gain a few bloodpoints that way.
---
1 that's how traps are supposed to work 2 this is gameplay not a shitpost
---
Change from shitpost to gameplay beep boop
---
How did nobody think of that? Just bring iron will urban evasion and NO mother or something. Oh yea! No mother is useful against the legion!
---
What are you talking about, it says gameplay
---
I can relate my dude. I did this trophy with my team 3-5 times and it didn't work. I figured out that you can do this trophy even if you are the killer. 4 people joined my lobby at the same time and one of them had a key. So I assumed they're a 4 man swf group hunting the trophy. So I messaged the guy with the key, helped them out and indeed, they all jumped in at different times. 1-3 players jumped after 5 seconds of the other but the last guy waited like 10-15 seconds then jumped and I got the trophy. Although it says you need to jump at the same time, it's bugged and you actually have to jump after a little while of the other jumping 
---
Then he’s a 110 M1 killer. 
---
Well the survivor perks are both free. And one killer perk is not free and it’s terrible.
---
Doesn’t make my hitbox untargetable. 
---
Hillbilly and trapper are best and you can’t convince me otherwise
---
I'd just like to clear up hat I main wraith and yes, freddy. Maybe this will help a little with the info I'm looking for. But IDK
---
no offense but how the fuck is this a shitpost?
---
Okay? Legions ability forces you to mend, and heal if you choose to. By not healing, you eliminate both of those, as you said, he will just instadown you. 
---
Use BP on the killers to upgrade their perks... 
---
Just spend the BP you get from your survivor and killer games on another killer 
---
Bing bong hello motherfuckers
---
You could argue it's bad to dc all together. Some things are unfair but they're still part of the game so... It's arguable.
---
Last time I checked purposely dying wasn’t a counterplay. 
---
As killer? Playing the game.
---
I literally just finished a game as freddy and blood warden saved my ass!
---
Lisa Sherwood \*Pulls out meat ~~scepter~~ claw\*
---
MASSIVE HEART EYES. This is amazing!! 💕
---
He ain't tho
---
Slugging. Unless the survivor has unbreakable or no mither there isn't much he can do but dc or wait to bleed out.
---
There's 4 jigsaw boxes by default, so 1 in 4 chance or 25% per box. 20% if the pig uses an add on for 5 boxes.
---
Actually they can if they disconnect from real life, like by playing a certain video game 😉, so joke's on you scary cosplayer!
---
Friend and I decided to do a crawl race on a match that had a bot killer haha! I think we tied! :P 
---
I thought Azarov's spine and skull got stuck to the crowbar
---
Bring Pig up to kinda boring and swap Trapper and Wraith down to disappointing. Both just unsatisfactory.
---
I’ve been doing this obviously, but some perks just haven’t been showing up.
---
It’s been months and I still only have BBQ and M&amp;A on 2 killers. I keep praying to the bloodweb gods and RNGesus, but I think they require a sacrifice.
---
my job here is done thank you for cooperating #5568
---
he’s in the other corner of the map trying to make pharmacy work
---
nope
---
Yep but the devs don't know how to fix their game and what issues to *actually* spend their time working on
---
Looks like you just found Legion's counter.
---
my surv main was nea and now it’s ace and i gotta say one whole game i accidentally sandbagged and got all of my friends killed when i was actually trying to help
---
Fair enough... I'm happy to use M&amp;A 2... BBQ is annoying when not 3 but I'll still use it at 1 for the BP and Ruin I like to have at least 2. Just keep spending, I have all killer perks and some killers I have my ideal set up but I know that when I prestige them it's gonna be a long time before I get my set up back
---
bought my cousin this game yesterday, might grind out those shards for him of he isnt gonna play this
---
fair point...
---
Then if a gen pops you know they are just gonna do gens and go to that general location. You still got a 3k which is a win.
---
It's going by their m1 weapons.
---
Isnt this perk lovely? Rewarding killer for playing shitty all the game
---
Personally I love the legion very nice cosplay *1 for the  mask
---
"Why not Chainsaw" Because it's not their m1 weapon
---
No, it's the m1 weapon of both characters
---
The disrespect towards that huntress tho 
---
This is my guess as well. 
---
kIlLeRs CaNt Be ToXiC
---
He used google, but he didnt find any  solution.
---
Then he's not a smart person. 
---
You can get your dick out in the locker to prevent them.
---
I WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW IT OVER THE GODDAMN THING THAT'S WHAT I DO THAT'S HOW THIS WORRRRRRRRKS
---
Upside, we know The Legion washes their hands before they go murdering. 
---
thats not kronk dude.
---
You're absolutely right, the big thing is that a surprising amount of players specifically play -only- one side because they only play with friends or only solo killer because they don't trust teammates or whatever. 
---
Playing that way gives an incredibly skewed perspective of the game, which already has a huge "Us vs. Them" mentality which itself is unhealthy but necessary for this type of game where someone HAS to be the bad guy. 
---
Tunneling, Mori spam, Looping, using specific perks (DS, NOED), using specific items (flashlight, Franks mix tape) are all part of the game and we are expected to play around those.  However toxicity presents itself when bad behavior and unnecessary ego creep into game play.  Is t-bagging and clicking flashlights obnoxious and completely unnecessary?  Yes it absolutely is.  Is leading survivors to the hatch only to catch and hook them or face camping unnecessary dick moves? Yes they sure are.  People on the internet can't be wrangled or forced to behave though and BHVR doesn't seem to care about the bad manners as long as they aren't holding the game hostage or using exploits. It's nice to tell people to act a certain way but this is the internet and there are still assholes everywhere. 
---
On another note, I honestly wish there was a better defense for survivors to get away than running in circles until downed or the killer gets bored. It would be so nice for game health on both sides to introduce something like that 
---
It's more so assumed that Freddy tunnel is mandatory
---
An enemy stand
---
Extra efficiency and charges makes that bad boy a super toolbox if you have someone else to repair with you for 2 second gen pops
---
You know, pal, you coulda told me that *before* I set it up.
---
&gt;Then he's not a smart person.
---
This seems to be a trend nowadays. People have all the tools to find answers but they don't have the brains to use it. 
---
Ehh idk.. he is pretty good with pc and stuff,but he was pretty sure that he didnt find any solution. He could lie for all that i know.
---
Only if he can get his theme tune as custom stealth music.
---
But that makes you the problem. You say there is no counter because the counter is a playstyle you simply dont like. Dont you think thats incredible cheap and hypocritical? Its the same as a killer arguing that the only killer not underpowered is the nurse or Legion as they can cancel out a long chase and chasing a looping survivor is a playstyle they dont like.
---
Thats why I love the hag. Few ever learn before its to late.
---
Pretending to be AFK is shitty. It’s the same if a survivor hides in a closet the whole game and runs for the exit when everyone else dies. It’s not sportsman-like and leaves everyone else angry. 
---
Since when does slugging to catch the last person take 5 minutes? Or am I missing something?
---
To heal or not to heal that is the question. Yes god damn it. Its in my DNA to heal. Fucking Luuuuuuugion.
---
Only killer I’ll bail on is a legion running franks mix tape, iridescent button, mori and using all the slow down perks.
---
Not saying I’m in the right to bail but with a killer that takes away every chase mechanic and to run builds like that I consider it toxic.
---
Also seems to be a common trend for legion players to be an asshole in the lobby afterwards in games I’ve stayed for when they run these addons and perks. I won’t entertain it anymore 
---
No ed is fine, just don’t get hit 😉
---
Yah those Claudette’s run active camouflage and can be a pain, I’ve played against a few scquadette groups and gotten my ass handed to me. 
---
Great work!
---
Because many people play to have fun and playing against legion isn’t fun
---
Legion is almost exactly like the pig
---
Now kith
---
Then they were just cunts for dcing
---
You say that like legion is the only problem in this game. News flash it isn't 
---
I’m struggling to find a reason to put hag. Once you know how to properly loop her, she’s pretty easy to get a long chase going.
---
U W u
---
Overcharge is worse surveillance.
---
well, why did you go out of the exit he was near? There are two exits. Shouldn't just assume a killer isn't gonna try to kill you.
---
I would rather dc then play a miserable, long match that I have no chance at winning. I’m not talking about what I dc from, but I’m assuming they just do it to move on to a more enjoyable match. 
---
I don't use any of these on my killer except discordance I'm just thinking about how it slows the gens
---
This is th best cosplay I've seen yet. Well done.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel would be better to slow down the gens
---
I run NOED because I'm like lv 20 on myers and have nothing else to put on him 😥
---
Maybe, but it worked for him. xD
---
imo the best looking icon is We're gonna live forever😝👉👋😭
---
That's the clown perk where he hooks you and the gem regresses 15% when kicked yeah?
---
Exactly the same as I use. I normally use video tape or john's medical files + last will or something
---
I fell you, bro
---
*jumps an gets deep wounded*
---
Not bad at all, some fine ideas are written here but I have a few things to add to this.
---
I see a lot of add-ons will now feature the "reduce skillcheck size" and while it is a good idea, if we assume that each tier add-on becomes more powerful, then pairing "Amanda's Secret" with "Interlocking Razor" will result in absurdly small skillchecks, if however the add-ons barely change it then we are left with the same weak add-ons. On ruleset No.2 very brave of you to assume that Piggy players cannot abuse this to get fast beartrap kills, just follow someone, hit them if they reach a box and carry them back, you get to BM and easily kill someone, also paired with add-ons that increase the distance of boxes, this add-on becomes unfair even if we do increase the time as you mention in the end, or if we increase it too much then what's the point? I have a small gripe with the "reduced miss cool down", assuming the same logic of higher add-ons giving a more powerful bonus applies, then we have a power that can have little to no punishment when used incorrectly with the right add-ons and unrelenting. On some minor notes, how about the suggested "first box searched will never produce a key" be added to rule set no2? It would fit thematically, after that make changes to it accordingly. Again, fine suggestions but some fine-tuning is needed 
---
No NOED?
---
Killer doesn't stagger when falling. Nea has a perj that reduce stagger from falling. Coincidence? I think not! 
---
Yeah. I ain't helping such a cunt too.
---
Now I think you should do a shirtless legion cosplay. No need to share it, just slide it in my DMs.
---
Generally my policy, if someone gets screwed by their team I'll let them out.
---
Just took out Myers for a tier up daily, one guy D/Ced on down, the next D/Ced on second down (they kept returning to the ruin totem over and over), 3rd suicided on hook so I led the 4th to ruin, let them do 2 gens and escape - the first guy to leave stayed to tell me I was "Trash killer, reported for teaming"
---
Wtf are you on about "auto loss"? No map is auto loss for any killer, especially not the Huntress, that can utilize her ability to counter window vaults and pallet drops.
---
could be old player returning. 
---
They could have played a lot back in the days when deranking down to 20 was possible.
---
However, it would be interesting to see if they got recent achievments as survivor, which would indicate they might have tinkered either with their achievments, or their rank...
---
Well the main reason I left most numbers as variables because I know that these ideas would need to be aggressively tested to make sure they wouldn't be crazy. I will say I did forget the possibility of Rule Set No.2  being stacked with other Skill Check reducing Add-Ons would be bad so I will add a "*Does Not Stack*" cliff to it. 
---
As for the BM aspect I'm not sure I follow. Could you explain that a bit more because I don't understand how integrating Rule Set No.2 into The Pig's base Power would cause easy kills and BM'ing.
---
I love when I have a bad game and I'm getting mad [usually cause bad teammates or bad luck], I end up being last alive with no chance, get downed, start raging then get carried to either a gen or the hatch by the killer unexpectedly. Instantly dissolves my rage 
---
are you that guy on fb that makes teh cute dolls?
---
If you die without your item, you lose it.
---
Do all the gens. get chased. Rescue everyone. Get downed by NOED. Get facecamped. Teammates leave. You get 21k BP while they get from 15k to 9K (5k survival included...). That was awfully painful.
---
WRONG LEVER!
---
Is this dragon ball super? I’ve never seen this episode
---
#I HATE YOU
---
Fool! Shaggy's power is infinite.
---
Yeah that happened in a game I played last night on PS4. First guy DCs the second he SEES legion. Second guy DCs the second he gets hit. Third guy gets downed and DCs. This all happened in the time it took me to do one gen. What a blast! 
---
Ace is a legend
---
Yeah, it's really unnecessary to have this, especially for Killers, when before a match you can directly pick the Killer you want normally and not have to toggle it all the way from Cannibal to Trapper, and you still have a minute to prepare in the pre game lobby if you forgot something, so there's no point to this besides unnecessary accidents and possible deranks. 
---
Hense why I said that number.
---
Yeah it was ep. 128
---
I feel like if the killer if 12 meters away I'm probably already dead since Idk how to loop yet.
---
Right now Deja vu helps me figure out where the killer might be going to, and it's great at the start. it's also easier for me to plan what gens I should do first to make sure they're not too close.
---
Guess this goes to show how much of a noob I am :p I probably will try spine chill it does seem like it'd be better for me but I'll wait until I can get 2nd tier.
---
Thanks for your reply it was very helpful.
---
  
---
ow
---
It's hilarious how op did not respond to this since it was too long and wasn't sucking Scream's cock. Maybe they don't like being challenged to come up with responses to that.
---
Then you know nothing about hag. Shes one of the best killers in the game. I know huntress is not so op but she can deal with it too.
---
GachiBASS
---
I hope it's not a Legion 2.0
---
I don't think you can buy franchise killers with shards
---
You answered your own question- it’s effective. It’s a boring strategy, but it tends to be really effective.
---
U simply Change True to false and tada Ur fps cap is gone...
---
You mean on the stream tomorrow?
---
Probably. Not 100% Sure
---
Legion without add ons is dogshit. Legion with add ons is busted. 
---
That is because most people don't play hag properly. They mostly use her traps when they are being looped to try and push survivors away. You need to play both Hag and Freddy differently to every other killer, hence why about 90% of players who play them suck and don't get anything done.
---
 With hag, you need to set up your web of traps on crossroads, loops and incorporate your hooks.
---
 If you ever face a good hag, pray and run, you'll need it because a good hag will not get looped, will not get cucked by urban and will slap your ass with her big meaty claws
---
But it’s cheap as hell and nets you far fewer bloodpoints than actually engaging in the game? I’m a killer main and the only time I’ve ever camped are when the exit gates are open. Like I feel it’s basically admitting “yes I’m a piss poor killer but I’m gonna win anyway by being a douche”. 
---
There is no immediate repercussion for them to DC. They load into a new game in a few minutes and hopefully aren’t up against what made them DC in the previous game. 
---
It sucks being the ones left in the game who are down 1+ teammate(s). However there is no reason for them to not DC. I want to win and cooperate with my team as much as possible, but if I DC the last thing on my mind is the feelings of the remaining survivors. 
---
I HATE these kind of survivors. Two or three of the ones not hooked all rush to the hooked survivor 2 seconds after I've hooked them. Then throw a hissy fit in post game that I was "camping." No mother fucker you were too goddamn stupid to wait until I walked away. 
---
That’s not why killers hate playing on console lmao
---
That’d be sooo annoying to deal with as killer but so funny for the 4 man swf using purple flashlights 
---
People don’t DC to spite you, people DC because they want an engaging and fun experience. You’re allowed to play the character you spent money on for sure, but the survivors are also allowed to play the game they spent money on. 
---
I’m not telling you that the solution should be to not play legion, you did spend money on him after all, but be aware that by playing him you are involuntarily choosing to create an unfun and monotonous experience for the survivors, and they have the right to refuse to participate in boring gameplay.
---
That is so wack man, why do people have to do that to new players?
---
All while playing on 20 fps. 
---
Missing noed 
---
Oh ok I will see if I get the screencaps from this person on Tru3s chat. How do I mod mail? Sorry Im a Reddit noob.
---
haha very true!  I see silly, stupid questions on reddit all the time, when a simple web search would return the answer on the first return.
---
So really, try to pay attention to it, and you will notice just how much Clown dies because of it
---
They said from the last big patch they wanted to explore some new global perks for survivors so hopefully we can see some new perks coming in soon. 
---
The ones who do this while having comments disabled on their own profile are even worse
---
Your right, however I don’t normally think tbag and be huge dick
---
No problem! I had no idea either until I read someone here say it lol and I try and remember to check every match as well,  but so many people show as offline! I do have a few names to avoid but thankfully it doesn’t seem we run into too many of the same killers 
---
I think we’ll get one today and one tomorrow C:
---
Yeah I realized my flaw and apologized for it. It slipped my mind that Leatherface was a licensed killer. 
---
As a legion main this cosplay is on point great job 
---
No0b3 for sure. He is a god when it comes to looping the killer. 
---
Tru3ta1ent for killer and survivor POV.
---
Monto probably if you are looking for fun builds.
---
What people don’t realize is No Mither has a hidden passive where the killer will tunnel you at a 75/100/Infinite percent increased chance cause you’re always one hit from being downed. 
---
I mean yah Michael’s better than people give him credit for but not THAT good. Also hag above billy?
---
Also a valid reason
---
Reposting normie 
---
PTB is rumored to be released next Tuesday
---
no
---
No, it’s not okay. It ruins the match for everyone else, and dcing enough times is bannable.
---
The PBE must be the next week. 0 teaser now.
---
Shouldn't team B&amp;B be tier 1? Because of the whole chainsaw situation?
---
Honestly I’d swap Nurse and Doctor, Put Spirit And Huntress up on the top bar and put Myers in his own Tier. 
---
Surely camping can’t be fun for killers right? I feel like it’s not fun for anyone. Or am I wrong? 
---
This is actually one of the best DBD cosplays I've seen
---
I love this. 
---
Yeah but decisive is OP irl
---
How did he have NOED?  I cleansed all the totems.
---
It depends when you have a game with multiple DC and if the killer wants to sit through the next 10 / 15 minutes farming.
---
Personally, I used to let people farm when it was multiple DC's but after a while they would still be so toxic in end-game chat I just straight up kill people now. 3 people DC and you need 1 gen left, congrats you get the hook.
---
The only time I give people the hatch is when they weren't being an a\*hole in the game abusing flashlights, or t-bag stun or anything. Then I feel like, yeah you cool. But more often than not, they still stay shit like gg ez, you fucking suck or something like that. Though acting like you want to farm and then not to is only funny when the person is being an asshole. Other than that, it's just mean.
---
PSA : If you dress up a Pizza Dwight, in full gear. Rule #1 will always been let him/them live by my standards. 
---
I hate that glitch.
---
Sometimes it might be for punishment (if you’re a good looper and juker). Sometimes it’s for a ritual (sacrifices) and sometimes they might be doing it as revenge for previous games they did poorly in. In some cases they just do it because they are meanies. 
---
Doing you, gens?
---
But it's basically a free self care AND botany! It's secretly op!
---
This isn’t about whether or not NOED is good. I think you missed the point.
---
they said they’re working on changing this
---
I just mori them when i get them super close to the hatch. 
---
Have I found my twin? Literally sandbag when I'm trying to take a hit for them. Also swapped to Ace for those juicy chests
---
Edgy teens, so I'm sure the explanation is gross. Some things are best left unasked and unanswered.

---
As someone who is having a blast with Doc, why is he on the same level as Trapper/Bubba? It might take time to build up the madness, but then he has really good tracking with his illusions, or am I wrong? 
---
Ironic, could save others from death... but not himself...
---
Every time I pick him I get a farm map and I'm running out of all other map offerings so yeah.
---
indeed it is, I have been practicing huntress and she's been fun.
---
piggy girl also has traps on the ground now too?
---
The only point I'm ever driving at is that this game is not balanced.  People argue back and forth with me, but it's just not balanced.  Institute an MMR system that forces survivors who escape upward in rank, and survivors who die downward.  Killers who 3 or 4k go up in rank and 0 or 1k go downward.  This way when I die 10 games in a row at rank 15 (even with 400 hours in game and the ability to decently pallet loop), no deranked purple rank killer is going to shit on me.
---
Legion gonna show up and t-pose at people next to show them he ain't fucking around.
---
Honestly, no one has any clue. Don't believe any of the speculation until we get more info.
---
Huntress and Clown should easily be A Tier
---
So what are you trying to counter? Getting hit? Getting found? If you don’t want legion downing you with their power, you have to be more evasive. 
---
True, I guess. I don’t think this was at that rank though. If I remember my games as a new player correctly I never got camped but I did kill myself on the hook because I didn’t know how to get off lol So I honk the real inexperienced ones leave right away because they don’t know what else they are supposed to do or how to find anyone.

I wish it showed small game there to nullify the NOED completely

uh... wheres BBQ?
---
Hag?
---
Maybe it’s maybeline 🍃🌺
---
Agreed! He's super nice, and does amazing work! That mask is on my list of things to get!!!!!!!
---
This is worthless!
---
Make whale noises to become more dominant!
---
If you just swap Myers and Billy, this list would be pretty solid.
---
Personally, i think Legion is at least B tier because they can guarantee a down by breaking the chase and following the scratch marks.
---
I'd say DC ing is worse than camping, why? Simple, if the killer is camping someone then I'm safe to do gens until that person dies 
---
ye, he is currently pretty strong without real counterplay...
---
/r/deadbydaylight: the same meme 8 billion times

I mean it's a meme, I didn't actually order them :v
---
DEAD 'ARD!
---
holy fuck that dude is embarassing my skin , dude please! adam's with that fly skin don't play like that ffs
---
I usually do aswell. But as I wrote in the video''and was quite tired to go against billy''. We had been matched up against billy soo many times that day. So thats why we said like we did. :) 
---
fookn ded 'ard
---
yikes
---
Time to be OP with Territorial Imperative.
---
I mean if you’re running Resilence or This Is Not Happening, then I suppose not healing could be viable but leaving yourself one shot seems like a bad move, not gonna lie. Especially with how perks like Thanatopobia, Blood Hound, Stridor or Predator are quite common in legion builds, playing into their perks strengths would be the worst idea. It’s better to take your first hit and disappear as best as you can. 
---
Yeah I think the main reason is has such limited options is so that everyone has the same experience in the game.  Ya know, so no options can give people any advantages in matches, at least thats what Ive always thought.  But then again we are talking about BVHR too haha
---
No real counterplay is right, yeah. But a Killer having no counterplay isn't necessarily good nor a fun killer to go against. And we all know that Legion is extremely unfun to play against but to play with (imo) is also true.
---
Having a 110 killer that can (basically) sprint burst and put a timer on the survivors is pretty shit, mainly due to the fact that the only way to effectively kill/sacrifice survivors is tunneling, when if you don't, you're probably gonna get a lot of bloodpoints in Deviousness, Brutality and Hunting, but no sacrifices because Legion needs to down normally, not with the Frenzy.

---
i smell deranking all over that build 
---
well he can win every Chase if the survivor doesnt fool you with enough looping and he can slow the game down tremendously.
---
Never said he is Fun to play against, just that he is extremly strong right now and has no counter, which ranks him way higher on a Tierlist
---
OwO New Pig ideas, yes please! These sound very fun imo, like another person stated, some need some tuning but even if some of these are added in they can make Pig rise in the tiers.
---
Quentin used to look cool, now that they changed his model he looks like a dork.
---
Let's not be naive. You don't get 3-4 players at rank 17-20 with full 3 tier perk load outs and ultra rare item/add-on combos who then flame you in post game chat by pure innocent accident 
---
Fair enough, I am also way better than hag than I am billy or spirit but I just have a hard time putting her above them, thats all.
---
A perk pioneered by Billy
---
You’re trying to counter their power, but there is no counter to feral frenzy. They’re faster than you, can fast vault, and have a pretty much guaranteed first hit. There’s no way to avoid it without just hoping they suck.
---
No... Is this the link you're using? [https://clyp.it/sx0qevne](https://clyp.it/sx0qevne)
---
What an interesting killer power, so happy we got him, matches against him are a thrill ride. For real i know they wanted to "experiment" with single killer dlc, but who though a killer's strength should be basement defense and camping?
---
Yes but he said it was a online purchase... so if dead by daylight wanted to they could take it down
---
And then the game goes by so fast that you don’t get any boldness or altruism point so you don’t pip. 
---
lig
---
What
---
“What I do mind is doing 99% of the work for none of the reward.” That’s the problem. You still won. The reward isn’t escaping like how a killer’s reward is getting a 4K. You got the reward of that bp. You’re not supposed to escape every time. You’re not gonna get a 4K every time. 2.5k and 5k isn’t a reward. Don’t base games on the end.
---
IM PISSED OFF AT MYSELF BECAUSE I CANT PLAY KILLER BECAUSE I AM PARANOID THAT EVERY MATCH WILL BE HORRIBLE AND I FORGOT HOW TO PLAY KILLER GOD DAMNIT WHY DID THIS HAPPEN TO ME I MADE MY MISTAKES SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I don’t have enough slots.
---
What an ace main. You make me proud
---
Uh ?
---
She could attach a shotgun collar to their neck and throw the key behind them. They scramble to get it, and insert it to try and remove the trap, but the key doesn't fit. They look at Mandy in horror as she reveals a remote and presses the button, activating the collar and killing them immediately. It's still shit, but hey.
---
I KNOW IT GETS SAID EVERY WEDNESDAY, BUT FUCK TOXIC ASS SURVIVORS WHO JUST WAIT AT THE GATES JUST TO TBAG AND PROCEED TO TALK TRASH IN END GAME CHAT BECAUSE THEY'RE SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS AND HAVE EVERY CRUTCH PERK IMAGINABLE. SERIOUSLY FUCK BORROWED TIME AS WELL.
---
Get more slots, trust me, its a good combo for when you get slugged
---
Nah I have better perks but I don’t have 4 good perks ya know?
---
Missing sloppy butcher 99% of wraith mains use it now
---
25%
---
upon winning a Chase, he can body block escapes and deactivate bis Power to down them...Have you even played Legion?
---
WELL, BECAUSE OF RANK RESET, MIGHT I RECOMMEND PLAYING LEGION? HE’S SIMPLE ENOUGH AND MOST SURVIVORS YOU’LL ENCOUNTER WILL DESERVE IT!
---
They make one bad killer and now everything they do is a shitshow? 
---
Look up Michael Myers mori
---
Bout time he got the buff
---
I just imagined Laurie ripping off Hag’s whole fucking arm off.
---
NO THATS RUDE, MY BRAIN WILL NEVER FORGIVE ME AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Before rank reset just derank to 15 . After the reset you'll be rank 17
---
PLAYING THE GAME IS NOT RUDE
---
Death &gt; playing this bug called dbd
---
report it to the devs if you can
---
I’m gonna make a tier list of this.
---
I recently found out that this arms not forming a full 180 degrees is actually referred to as an A pose. If you don’t already know what the poses are used for I recently found out and it’s quite interesting; animation/modeling. Modeling with the t pose is typically more difficult because the textures stretch and make the shoulders look strange so it requires more skill. However modeling with A pose might leave textures off certain parts of the arm, like under the armpit, and the elbow stretchy part. For a game like dead by daylight, A posing would be easier because the characters aren’t constantly climbing or stretching their arms up. I’ve never animated or modeled so I don’t know how hard it is
---
Im waiting
---
Wonder what the atk level is for both you need to equip them
---
Either that or str level
---
Hate to say it, but just get bubba if you want it
---
Thanks for the feedback. I'm not sure about the puppet-chest ratio myself so that's why I went with a not too low/high number. The reason for the chase mechanic is that I think it would make for an interesting gameplay because even the most skilled players don't know every map 100%. So she would defenitely have some potential for high ranks I think. I agree with you tho, needs some testing but only for the radius every survivor is able to see inside. You could make it bigger and reduce it with Add-Ons. But that's just an example.
---
Really? A repost? You are the worst type of person on reddit
---
Great Feedback, commenter! 
---
WHY THE FUCK DOES OBJECT OF OBSESSION ANNOY ME SO MUCH I FUCKING HATE PLAYERS WHO RUN IT GAH PROBABLY BECAUSE I PLAY PIGGY SO KNOWING THAT SOMEONE SEES MY ASS UNNERVES ME BUT STILL
---
Lol I always thought it meant unhooking them right next to the killer so they go down like a sandbag but then I realised the expression is “a sack of bricks” and your explanation makes way more sense. This graph still applies though haha. TIL
---
Surprised Piggy's doesn't say ^"squeak"
---
No that isn’t shit at all that’s fucking amazing.
---
I saw rumours online that the ptb will be coming on the 26th of February, is this true?
---
I LOGGED ON THIS MORNING AND ALL OF THE DAILY RITUALS I COMPLETED LAST NIGHT WERE BACK UP AND ALL OF THE BLOODWEB PROGRESS I HAD DONE ON MY SURVIVORS + BILLY WERE UNDONE, WHAT?

Besides, with two exits open, it really can be necessary if you want to not depip.

He doesn't see scratch marks when you SB away and he's in the ability? Didn't know that.

why not doctor on top? I always giggle too if I get stunned as doc or stun a doc :D

I'd like to know at what ranks do people still not know about the hag's traps.

I learned about it the 1st few days I had the game...

There's no need to be embarrassed or whatever if you're high rank, you can pm it to me and I won't tell anyone

I posted because I like it and thought it was funny. I don’t take Reddit that seriously.

Why do I feel the person under that is hella hot?
---
MAYBE NOT BUT PLAYING LEGION IS RUDE AND IF I EVEN DARE SAY THAT I WANT TO PLAY LEGION I WILL BE DOWNVOTED TO HECK SO I NEED TO PLAY THE TRAPPER 
---
I’m half-expecting a Child’s Play chapter to tie in with the new film (though it won’t release for a while so probably too early for a CP chapter).
---
Other than Hellraiser and Scream I can’t really think of any other franchises they might consider, and even those two I doubt will happen anyway.
---
Since it’s most likely an original chapter, I’m excited to see what they’ll come up with. I’d love if they finally did The Teacher and gave us a proper high school map; an indoors one like Lerys. 
---
Otherwise I’m pretty much open to anything for the next killer. I hope they’ll have a good backstory/basis (like The Spirits) from another culture; honestly more Japanese demons and ghosts would be great
---
Accidently called the dealer the bloodweb in my shrine of secrets meme, sorry.
---
Next Tuesday. Soon, as long as they stay on track. We should also get a teaser tomorrow during the dev stream. 
---
It isn't fun for the killer, either. Regardless of whether or it's actually beneficial point-wise, it's basically a survivor saying, "f*ck you, I'm out, I'm entitled." and it's incredibly dissatisfying. 
---
Do you know what we can do in real life? Call the cops. Ugh, creepy... I wouldn't like to come across you at night.
---
Bold of you to assume the Shrine would give BBQ
---
Well teabagging makes a lot of killer get tilted and mess up, so im sure that helped a lot.
---
That wasn't even a long chase...Would've been even shorter if he wasn't awful.
---
What an awful Clown i'd love to see him get ran for multiple gens to see his reaction to that.
---
I'm having the same problem with **TRAPPER**, of all killers. They get caught in a trap and they'll just DC before I even get there. 
---
Without any points. …Got it. 
---
T posing shit out of you
---
Oh no a -rep now nobody will like me and i will get no friends :(
---
He keeps it on with the overwhelming frustration from the community about his existence.
---
I am also taking into account their inaction to solve present issues with DbD, like the whole DC epidemic. They're also behaving super odd when it comes to their livestreams and such, where they literally say that they don't listen to their players' feedback in PTBs..
---
Behavior doesn't care about you as a customer, only your wallet. 
---
You are probably not wrong at all my man
---
What is going on here?
---
We'll have the PTB in a few weeks probably.
---
yes
---
I will pay all the moneys for kronk
---
I love when that happens to me as spirit, even though I'm on the complete other side of the map because of BBQ and Devour Hope
---
You dumbly cleansed only the 4 in the obvious spots, with the last one crazy well-hidden.  fool!
---
That's what fuels them. They feed on salt and frustration. Who knew that four horny teens would be more scary than a literal ghost.
---
Spirit would be more of a "WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
---
Then you'd still waste more than just straight up DC'ing. 
---
Slug Nurse would love it 
---
This is always my problem with the pig. If they aren’t good enough to find people at gens hey go for those at the boxes trying to get their trap off. I have met only 2 pigs that saw me on a box and let me take it off instead of hitting me when they know I’m an easy kill. 
---
Why do you ask?
---
Clown mori is the best. Why? Because you can spam the mori to stop on a survivors head infinitely if you let go before 99%
---
So fucking hilarious, especially if they DC
---
That makes sense then, allows room for a very small amount of counterplay if you can get near a structure as it runs out. 
---
Ive been waiting for Devour Hope and Make your Choice for a whole now. At least I finally got M&amp;A last week. 
---
The thing that makes the game toxic is the players. And yes gen rushing is thing. I’ve had people let their teammates die on hooks so they can keep doing gens. When you ignore other parts of the game to benefit yourself, I’d call it toxic. 
---
It doesn’t have anything to do with mechanics honestly. Camping is annoying, tunneling is annoying. I’ve had it done to me, and I’ve had games where I can justify doing it. It’s part of the game that you just have to accept. 
---
Tbagging is only tilting if you let it. The only time it annoys me is when they won’t leave the game, instead just tbagging at the gate when I’m nowhere near them. 
---
I'll give him this...he didn't really camp once he threw all his bottles at me he left.
---
What are the other three btw?
---
What counter is there against a competent nurse ?
---
You say that, but I went from red ranks to green ranks and the survivors are even more of a headache there: everyone has at least adrenaline and DS. At least in red ranks people are nicer after the match.
---
JZJXJDJJDJD I should’ve put /s
---
He'd dc by the 3rd gen
---
You on PS4? If so I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same clown. 
---
Should have named it "Battering Ram"  lol
---
Ah, that’s not as bad then. Still unnecessary bm but whatever. 
---
Was it all no mother or deliverance as well 
---
Frankly the only time I have an issue with d/c is when it’s something like them getting downed or missing Dstrike
---
Unpopular opinion: if you don’t want to play a match, don’t. You’ll be less toxic later on if your not pissed off the whole time. You aren’t obligated to ensure anyone else has fun. Of course, keep that in mind when other ppl dc on you
---
All no mither
---
Legion is definitely my favourite mori animation.
---
Which is why I always run Devour Hope on them.
---
So play freddy and just run all over the map?
---
when playing as pig ill give them a little love slap and leave them on the floor but yes it is a waste to to chase and hook trapped survivors.
---
Just bring a medkit 
---
For me it’s getting hooked and seeing my teammates aura.
---
Just seeing them... standing there... doing nothing 
---
Love 2 leave "-rep" followed by a litany of swears on another person's profile so they can one day, maybe, possibly, be recognized as a not-good player by a website that almost nobody knows about or pays attention to. 
---
If I were a survivor I would just wait until Freddy is cross map with the dream survivor and sit there with the frozen survivor's body while the other two do gens and when Freddy is so far that he won't be able to catch up to us I'll wake up the sleeping survivor, leaving Freddy so far from everyone that he has to repeat the process while we get a couple gens done.
---
that devour hope fear is always there, clean the totem anyways if it's haunted grounds just yell 'i'm in danger' and pray xD
---
Was just confused by his reaction lol I did a 360, pallet slam, tiny bit of pallet vaulting. Don't think that justified getting a face full of bottles haha
---
*Readies murderin' pallet*
---
Don't forget the laugh spam. **HEH HEH HEH HEH** 
---
I was in a similar situation after taking a 3 month break and what I did was just focusing on gens, looping the killer until they got bored and then exit inmediately. 
---
Killers are really bad at that rank so you shouldn’t have problems ranking up, however beware that if you get caught you are probably gonna get facecamped so DS comes handy for that.
---
At green and purple ranks things get better though, most people at least know what you are doing and help you in one way or another.
---
Don’t go to red ranks, it’s awful.
---
Whhaaaaaaat
---
one guy convinced me to farm since my teammates dc, we did it for like 20 minutes and then he took me to the hatch, yoinked and hooked me. i'll never forgive him, felt like betrayal

Ok. Irl I'm out of shape but I don't breath like that. Then again I don't run everywhere.
---
Admitting to playing legion, on this subreddit? Bold move.
---
I've got a friend who is around rank 18/19 who plays every now and then and I'm usually giving him tips as we play but I'll try and think of some off the top of my head:
---
**Trapper**
---
When against a trapper, if the trapper stands in his own trap, he will be stunned for a second and also drop anybody they're carrying etc. Not something you can always use, but useful if you can somehow make them stand in their own traps. 
---
**Hag**
---
As I said before, crouch through traps to avoid triggering them and flashlights destroy traps.
---
**Nurse**
---
Not really a hidden tip but if the nurse is after you and you see her charging her blink for a while double back and run at her. She'll blink past you and you'll gain a couple more seconds of life.
---
Also if you shine a flashlight at the nurse while she's charging blink for 2 ish seconds you'll cause her some sort of fatigue where she cannot blink and is stunned. (needs confirming as I'm unsure about that one)
---
**The Wraith**
---
If you see him cloaked, shine your flashlight at him for about 2 seconds and you'll stun him for about three and it'll uncloak him too.
---
Regarding killers they're the only "hidden" type tricks i can think of that aren't immediately obvious.
---
But again my inbox is open if you have any particular questions too. :)
---
Reply to this if you have issues.
---
Get bullied
---
Played against a Freddy with Blood Warden today. He decided to camp the hooked survivor instead of hunting us down. Everyone escaped in the end. 
---
Right, great to know thanks for the explanation. 
---
win points?  2 hooks on every survivor and plenty of chase/pallet stuns/breaks and you will get 28k...
---
Hell yes. 20k points for 20-30 min of misery the whole time or 15-20k for 15-20 minutes of a normal match, absolutely.
---
No any scratch marks left while he is in frenzy are invisible 
---
He’s an artist and probably smokes and inhaled a lot of fumes. Also heavy metal. All the assumptions. 
---
Pig’s should’ve been “yip!”
---
What platform ? 
---
You have to dc like 60% of your game to get banned btw. Your reports are getting noticed it just doesn’t do anything’s 
---
And to use your own words against you, just because YOU like playing legion doesn’t give you the right to ruin my game.
---
Playing against legion is boring af. If it’s early in the night, yea I’ll stick around. If I’m been playing for a bit? Hell no. 
---
I don’t have fun in a match against legion. That’s what it comes down to. I play video games to have fun. Legion isn’t fun 
---
PC
---
How to play against tunneling Legion: doesn't matter you're going to win if you just do gens.  
---
How to play vs. good legion: everyone on a different gen, bring him to a useless map tile each time he attacks, mend, return to your gen or take your hook like a man while your team finishes gens and the Legion is hooking you 3 miles from the area he should have been pressuring.
---
Dennisreep.nl/dbd already has this &gt;,&gt;

He's a little big, I don't think he's in the best shape possible. Leave him alone :(

Is the gild supposed to be for the fan art or for the proper crediting of said fan art?
---
But yeah this is really good work.
---
You t bagged, toxic claudette as always
---
And... so what ? I don't understand. Is this just a video of Doctor's Mori ?
---
"Everyone is using &lt;insert perk or character&gt;." Check.
---
Complain about camping. Check.
---
"Doesn't take much skill." Check.
---
Complain about mori. Check.
---
"All &lt;insert killer&gt; have &lt;insert perk&gt;." Check.
---
I like that you actually used three of them in the last sentence alone. Impressive.
---
Yeah, lets hope that the devs rework legion so i can play legion for the cosmetics in peace
---
Could fave been devour hope and then where would you be if it was too late. Exposed and on the ground anyway. 
---
If everyone is injured I say go for it anyway because you’re one down anyway and it wastes the hex 
---
DBD is a casual game that some people like to pretend its an e-sport.
---
They tried making ranking up harder but it led to queue issues for R1 killers. 
---
I said the concept would be interesting. Not that it would be balanced or fun. I even say in my original reply that Moris are inherently unfun and unbalanced.
---
Not really proof. Could perfectly be a screen from another accoubnt or whatever. Still, extremly highly suspicious.
---
But i've since my message learned that something allowing to "set" your own rank exists. Don't even want to know how, but if it is true, there is no more room for doubts, indeed.
---
iTs An InStRuMeNt Of PuNiShMeNt
---
Yeah if everyone’s injured I’ll cleanse it. 
---
I always thought of it more as a modified club than an axe, and I don't care what the game calls it :o
---
Just use Ruin and you’ll be alright. If not, then you’ll be in a world of pain
---
i support this, i often want to practice 360's without wasting time in game!
---
If you can get it together on dr try unnerving presence, overcharge, distressing, and tinkerer I theorize this would be the no gen progress build. Since it is on the dr the skillchecks show up in random spots anyway and with the right add ons your terror radius is massive so unnerving presence will be effecting a lot of gens making survivors have to get great skillchecks the whole time. Tinkerer is a reworked perk that when a gen becomes 85% finished you get a notification like a failed skill check however your terror radius sound effects are nullified for a few seconds so you can sneak up on survivors and overcharge the gen again and again. Maybe not the most viable build, but it is a gen hell for survivors.
---
Nothing against you, OP - but this has been posted 10000 times. 
---
I mean you lose two pips and all points you got during the game, they punish quite a lot its just people dont care if they arent having fun
---
what's the thing that blocks gen's aura?
---
Removed for party thread please post /r/dbdLFG
---
Pig is tiny though
---
I have felt this same power, I was able to harness it for my masked meg.
---
All 3 of those perks are pretty bad but thats just me. I dunno what perks you have unlocked though
---
Personally, I enjoy collecting comments like this on my profile.
---
How do you grab ppl off of gens as nurse that achievement is killing me 
---
AND HE KOBE'D? LOL this is hilarious
---
Yeah once ur in the basement with leatherface... yikes haha
---
it's not like thats something you should be able to avoid. i hate getting owned by swf too but it is there, i dont think killers should be able to decide which games they want or dont want to play. swf ? dodge. items? dodge. too many hours? dodge. if survivors dont get to decide which killers they want to face neither should the killer. 
---
I just start failing skill checks so the killer can get me. Most killer will let the last survivor farm or escape thru the hatch.
---
He’s cancer to play against and cancer to play as, is basic gist of it
---
I kinda cheated with that one, first u have to have an add on or whatever its called so u can blink three times, then I simply just acted friendly and eventually I grabbed someone who was fixing a gen 
---
Lmfaoo yeah this is definitely what I do as clown as well. Actually got clown for this reason specifically. Every time he smacks a survivor, even while on hook, he laughs and he can also throw bottles at survivors while on hook. It’s nothing personal, it’s just me having a laugh lol it’s even better when you can hook them in the basement. I can fill up the whole basement with gas and have a little party. I’m not camping u, I’m just hitting u with a few bottles 
---
Ahhh nice I like that idea I'll do that thank you 
---
Surveillance for map control 
---
It's clearly not supposed to be good 
---
Let me know when u get it :D 
---
I’m sure u will
---
He is the worst killer in the game still. It's just that he's also the least fun killer to face because the survivor has almost no ability to escape a Legion except for stalling him endlessly. It's really the worst of both worlds, the killer is miserable and rarely kills anyone, and the survivor feels like powerless and bored even if they are more likely to survive in the end.
---
Pig is small
---
Santa Clown just wants to SUCK YO FINGAH!
---
I'll do that :D
---
me coming back home for a family reunion
---
16 is age of consent in the U.K. so I believe Susie should be fine. ÒwÓ 
---
(Please? If not Huntress and Pig should satisfy my Furry ass.)
---
We aren’t talking about getting better we’re talking about lack of fun. You know the thing you used to justify DCing against Legions. 
---
I like the ideas you have. I very much agree it is too easy to rank up. I do think it works for killer because it is based mostly on the amount of chases you win and hooks/sacrifices. But it is only you killing so it is a reflection on how good you are. Survivor, however is way too easy to rank up in my opinion. I was rank 1 killer and survivor last season and I found killer to be a little harder and a grind. Survivor, I swear I will at least safety pip by doing one gen and getting chased and hooked 3 times. And I'm not a good looper. 
---
i been saying this for a while, but the only real solution, to me, is to neither side be able to see the other before actually in game. you are in a lobby you ready up,you go to the game. nothing will change as long as the killer gets to decide what they are looking for.  swf ? dodge. items? dodge. too many hours? dodge. prestige 3? dodge. majority of online multiplayer games dont give the option of picking your opponents like dbd does to killers. i think it makes no sense.  
---
Fuck everyone else amirite?
---
Not true? A lot of people who were red ranks deranked because of rank reset &amp; purposeful deranking, so there's a shit ton of people who should be red rank, hovering around green ranks.
---
This is character development. &lt;3
---
Break LOS and randomly change direction, don't drop pallets/vault windows when she expects it, run near thick debris (tires especially), be stealthy, fast vault lockers, corny boi
---
I play killer as well, so idm if ppl have DS bc its a perk that helps slow the game down from their side. just like I can put ruin or NO ED. Can’t speak for the two randos, but we had it bc red ranks on PS4 is full on tunnel, NOED haha and ruin. ooof, you can’t find a build without NOED xD 
---
For the love of sweet holy...
---
Leatherface and Hillbilly have sledgehammers listed as their **main weapons** on the Wiki and in-game. There are skins for the hammer but no skins for the chainsaw. Henceforth the hammers are their main weapons not their chainsaws.
---
I will fucking scream if I get another "durrrrr billy has a chainsaw xd" reply on this fucking post. Can a moderator please pin this reply so I don't have to deal with all these r/iamverysmart people?
---
Waiting to get my perks up to level 4 before trying my hand at rank -1
---
Are you addicted or something mate?
---
It's easy to meme cause everyone can relate to the "oh shit" feeling of cleansing it. 
---
It really is the worst, what the fuck do you expect me to do when I have 2 people running laps around the hooked survivor and constantly trying to get my attention to run off, and I know after 2 seconds I turn around and there is another person running up to get the unhook off.  Really this situation is beneficial to me since everyone isn't on gens and is just dancing around the guy I just hooked and wasting so much time.
---
U could say that 
---
Ooooh thanks!
---
Nice.
---
Pros don’t fake
---
You should post this on the forums of the game, because a freddy rework is already confirmed to arrive soon.
---
Wraith D tier and pig B tier
---
So what happens when you see them? Are you going to  get hits and chase them to get another quick down or constantly turn around to guard the hook until second stage. If it’s the latter I can see how I’d be annoyed
---
I cleanse it when I see it for the fat stacks of points. 
---
Pig is small and trapper is an absolute gym king 
---
Then Legion obviously have an ability to make people being prone to instadown
---
DS would like a word with you.
---
No mother: The survivor who growed up without their mother learned to do all the stuffs by itself. Any actions performed while you are at least 32 meters away from others survivors will have the speed increased by 10%/15%/20%. If you are within 32 meters from another survivor, decrease your action speed by 10%/15%/20%.
---
I love teh comments to this photo like all teh whining and bitching about no counterplay only to find out that the counterplay to legion is actually massive. just dont stack gens, its that simple spread the map solo gen and hide once you hear the heart beat, no scratchmarks in frenzy and if he does catch someone and youve done the above things youll find that he cant actually kill you before 3 other generators prompt thus tilting him into trying to camp you and failing because no one else has been hit or just disconnecting giving you a free pip. what WONT help is whining reddit about literally nothing. that is all
---
these are kind of regressive suggestions.  The old pip system for killers was based on kills.  Guess what happened once you got pass ranks 10 thelobby wait time was crap and you always seemed to the get the same group of survivors or killer every other game.  I am not exaggerating about getting the same group of people every game or every other.  It was bad, you have no idea :( 
---
Haha XD been there! It’s a big OOF moment!! I just laugh and wait for it to wear off or if I’m being chased, pray to god I can out last! XD if I’m with friends, we laugh or yell at each other in good fun haha
---
HOL UP why the bitch with SOGGY TITS in A tier? Literally easiest killer ever
---
Thats if you have something to loop and all and don't fuck up the mindgame 
---
Its alright though if Ruin gets destroyed, so long as you've found and preferably hooked at LEAST one survivor by that point.
---
Because all you really need is for it to slow down the game... just a lil bit.
---
Killer has a face. Nea also has a face. Coincidence?
---
can you please elaborate how you put your ass into a dildo?
---
In dbd arms are up more than you realize. Almost Every killer and survivor has these ridiculous black pits like they cut out their shirts or something. 
---
Pig smol. Trapper big. Texas ain't called TumTums because he's carrying a little extra Christmas weight. 
---
"Why would I give a fuck about a side of the game that lets me play survivor"
---
 **Agriculture** is the science and art of cultivating plants and livestock. 
---
Why you gotta be mean to my wraith? speedy boi better than dreamy and stabby boi. 
---
Yes, that one. Thanks 
---
Oh you mean Descriptive Spike right?
---
Well played, take an upvote
---
congrats!!! :D
---
I loved getting mine, it made the torture and pain this game gives me to be worth it lol. I have such a love/hate relationship. but at the end of the day, the Entity just gets me. &lt;3
---
I used tier list that some another guy did i only added nea and new killer :p
---
I’m 2 trophy’s away and they’re ones I’ll probably never get :(
---
That isn't really very useful. If you have sloppy butcher that's also a good perk. It makes healing take a lot longer than normal. 
---
He's terrible and it takes a huge amount of effort to secure one hook but there isn't anything a survivor can do about it since he ignores pallets and windows he can garuntee hits from frenzy but frenzy itself can't down people unless he hits them like 4-5 times with it.
---
So your normal methods to dodge him or loop him basically don't work but at the same time he's going to have a bitch of a time actually killing you at all so it's just an endless chase that's relatively boring and sucks for both survivor and killer.  He's Freddy 2.
---
hahaha sorry for any confusion :P 
---
Because he is a cheap-ass doctor and cant afford to buy a top-tier dildo. His salary has decreased a lot since he doesnt continue top secret torture tests anymore.
---
take it. then follow him and down the person again. 
---
Just kill yourself on the hook then. At least you'll get some blood points that way.
---
die. 
---
WHY ISNT BEST GIRL ON TOP SHE HAS THE MOST UNIQUE ONE
---
That's exactly what in doing. Leaving this legion game and looking for a different killer.
---
Husky boi
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
Legion is only bottom tier when you play him as intended. Good Legions hit you with frenzy, but still follow you without having you directly in LOS, causing the bleed timer to still go down and guarantee the chase ending in 15 seconds. A legion using this exploit is probably the 4th best killer in the game 
---
He's also super OP and top tier with Franks Mixtape 
---
Yup. I don't gives two shits about some random gamer across the country.
---
Well I think calling you a name is over the top but I totally understand why the one who got unhooked got mad you just smacked him down instead of going for the farming asshole. I usually knock the guy down and then go for the unhooked giving the guy who got fucked over a chance and also slowing the game down just as much as if I was to have hooked him
---
You can buy SOME killers with shards.
---
Nothing, but at the very least she is punished for missing a slash. Legion on the other hand...
---
and they run tracker bulids like blood hound, sloppy butcher, nurses calling and bbq n chili. while im there with distortion, dead hard, self care and leader. :( feels man 
---
In her natural habitat, off in a corner licking a wall.
---
Doesn't need to be as particular as Michael. Just having them in the dream aka terror radius is enough to start leveling up your fear level. If you do get in a chase that is just a bonus as you'll level up faster.
---
If you ask if it's wrong to do anything in this game, you will get answers ranging from death threats to a signed copy of _The Art of War_ telling you it's a good strategy.
---
Stop playing
---
1. I'm not only specifically talking about this moment right after rank reset.
---
2. There's good and bad players at every rank. 
---
That pose should be an option.
---
Since the wraith starts with ***Bloodhound*** you should use it if you want to track injured survivors more easily.
---
***Sloppy Butcher*** would also be decent since it slows down healing.
---
***Predator*** is good for just hunting survivors that like to run or are being chased.
---
And if you swing and miss a lot use ***Unrelenting*** so you don't wait as long to attack again.
---
As a killer main this shit is so dumb. Being triggered like this lets the other two finish the gens. You definitely won this one, hooked or not, by making him so angry he threw the rest of the match. This is like when a survivor tries to bm me by teabagging a pallet then immediately goes down 3 seconds later. Just run idiot.
---
I was about to fucking post this exact thing
---
i wait until someone is injured in chase
---
A FELLOW MAN OF CULTURE
---
not everyone - just the person in chase
---
This is the most untrue thing I've ever read, you clearly know nothing about the devs 
---
Freddy is the GOAT in the right hands. 
---
Its a mummy or a witch. Thats my thoughts.
---
I mean, in the end she's a M1 killer like many of the others. I wouldn't ignore downing someone while playing Trapper or Clown just because they I came across them and their still wounded from being hooked. 
---
Why would I do it on the Pig? Because RNG might go my way and they have to search 3 or 4 boxes to get the trap off? I'd rather just accomplish 1/12th of my objective and get another hook state on someone who is crippled.
---
If timed correctly, a killer can hit you as soon as you lose invincibility frames.
---
*insert air pods joke here*
---
ridiculous and boring 
---
That’s fair, I do it too, but specifically going for the trapped survivor
---
^NO MOTHER
---
ANGRY HUNTRESS NOISES
---
Man, at the end of any game I have 1-2 tokens on WGLF I'll gladly go get two more for a hook trade. I get more BP, someone else gets their 5k survival points, killer gets two hits and a hook worth of points, everyone wins
---
Ok so the power is automatically powed. I get it.
---
On the contrary I've learned to pretty much ignore survivors who try to clicky clicky flashlights at me and tea bag in the open and purposely say "COME CHASE ME HAHAHA".  I just straight up ignore their existance and don't even acknowledge them and continue playing the map as if there are 3 survivors.  Then suddenly after a while they are the only survivor left...  Who hasn't touched any gens and is still trying to t-bag and desperately get my attention while everyone else was being hassled by me so their gen progression was super slow.
---
In my mind if someone is purposely trying to make me chase them that's one less person working on gens or trying to break my totem, I literally do not have to care about them at the moment.
---
That would defeat what the devs wanted. A mystery killer until you see him or I guess unti your swf friend says who it is. Not to mention that would be boring as hell to play the same map prob over and over and almost never getting some maps 
---
I don’t think this needs to be on reddit.
---
His main weapon IS his chainsaw tho...
---
Ok well same effect 
---
No thats is unfun and dumb because the trapped survivor are not doing gens. If you tunnel him, you are just wasting a trap.
---
It’s an interesting concept but it may need tweaking in some areas because I can definitely see some problems with it
---
Endgame is the exception, when traps turn from slowing the game down to keeping survivors on the map for you to kill. However, if you can’t find survivors, patrolling gens always helps. Even if there are no survivors on them, it keeps them off. Of course you should down trapped survivors if you happen upon them.
---
No, you throw a tantrum and quit the first time something doesn't go 100% in your favor. Clearly you cant handle multiplayer games, either stop throwing hissyfits and quitting because not everything is catered to you or stick to single-player. Because nobody wants a crybaby or quitter around. 
---
Extremely boring
---
Pig is smoller. Trapper is an absolute unit
---
What you’re saying is different. Of course hook a trapped survivor that’s on gens. What I’m talking about is hook tunneling or only patrolling boxes. 
---
They can still jump into the hatchet when downed lol BABY KILLER GG EZ
---
High rank pig is difficult but she is a really good killer when played well.
---
My tier list getting used? FOR MEMES??? 
---
Don’t know why you’re being downvoted, slugging can give you good pressure, although I prefer the hook.
---
Bloodwarden was what ? And thx for zhat. I only played gjost now. Mostly cuz everybody annoys and fucks me up when i play freddy...still 3 kills :/
---
Its all fun and games until you save them both and get hooked but are first hook then see both their auras pointing at each other, bming you then running out the exit just for them to say they didnt save you because you took decisive strike. “Why didnt you guys help me?” “Cant hear you, youre dead.” 
---
This is different. If I find you on a box, I’m not gonna ignore you unless I’m already in chase. I’m saying specifically going for trapped survivors
---
Not saying it’s your fault! I think it’s the developers fault for designing a killer who breaks all game mechanics. Because of that, players will typically DC or suicide because of how unenjoyable legion is to go against. I do think it’s unfair for you to pay money for a killer that sees a disconnect just about every game. But at the same time, you know this is likely to happens since you are playing as the most hated killer in the game. Devs just need to rework legion so you and survivors can both have fun. 
---
Hahaha thank you! I had exactly the same, this game made me cry once cuz I was just so bad at the game as the killer XD. What was your last trophy? 
---
Shoutout to the last time it was on there in 2017
---
And then there’s me running both 
---
Agreed
---
A toxic survivor entity is a scary concept
---
They are just salty. 
---
Which ones do you need? Maybe I can help 
---
Bad excuse
---
I hate whoever made the tier list maker, now everyone thinks they have a list of nonsense that people need to know on reddit.
---
If this list is based of power then it’s entirely wrong.
---
I said competent nurse. 
---
Nurse really does not need any addons to help her also she can hit someone right away or even pull people off gens, but with Freddy you can still work on a gen for a couple more seconds and having a bigger chance to get the gen done and to even wake up if you get a skill check to make him waste even more time putting you to 
---
sleep. Freddy gets fucked by pallets and windows and nurse ignores those things. Freddy’s own power is a liability hell you can even hide in a locker so he can’t even see you with his aura anymore until you get out so the one thing that makes him power cool goes completely powerless 
---
😂
---
But are you looking for people on boxes specifically?
---
That's because you're on Xbox. 
---
I’m a simple man, I see “abruptly cut off”, I say “Tinkerer”. 
---
Care to elaborate? I would love to refine the concept even though it has a slim chance of actually being implemented.
---
I have no idea sorry &gt;.&lt;
---
My friends are this rank, they think the ultimate objective is to escape and no one else matters. You have to deal with the fact that these guys dont know how to play the game and should expect nothing lol
---
4 players escape from hatch and grab someone after 3 chain blinks. 
---
I've literally never gotten a single comment on my profile from over a hundred killer games. I guess the majority of the community doesn't know or care about it lol.
---
No, of course not. But if I see you taking your trap off, I’m not gonna pretend you don’t exist. My reasons for it tunneling is strategic, not coddling.
---
Alright, thanks
---
I ALWAYS GET REPORTED BY SOME SALTY ASS SURVIVORS. IM SICK AND FUCKING TIRED OF GETTING A 4K AFTER CAMPING WHEN THESE PIECES OF SHIT DONT HAVE THE COMMON SENSE TO FUCKING FINISH THE GENS YET THINK BRINGING 3 OTHER PEOPLE TO THE HOOK WILL WORK OUT FOR THEM. WHY THE FUCK DO PARENTS GIVE THIS GAME TO THEIR MIDDLE SCHOOL CHILDREN
---
Probably because of console loading times, amirite fellas? = P
---
It's when you aren't wiggling when being carried. It's pretty quiet, but he'll moan out this faint *"..wwhhyyy.." when being carried away. Also when he's hooked and waiting.
---
It's a bug from what I can tell. The end game trigger zone isn't activating while leaving the gate.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Enjoy the killer Main post
---
Is bbq in the shrine today?
---
Patrolling boxes I'll agree with since in most cases it is a waste of time.
---
But the definition of what you call "hook tunneling" is so nebulous around between here, Twitch and the forums.  I just don't think I should ignore survivors who are running around with a trap on their head if the opportunity presents itself.
---
And believe me, I've seen enough streamers who whine "200 IQ pig, tunnel the traps" when they're running in front of the killer trying to go from box to box. Like it's the killers responsibility to ignore shitty survivor plays. 
---
PICK THEM UP FACING A WALL OR ANYTHING THAT OBSTRUCTS YOUR LINE OF SIGHT. FLASHLIGHT SAVES RARELY HAPPEN TO ME ANYMORE.
---
Feng Min's Lunar outfit is at the top of my list but it sticks out like a sore thumb, though it might be Auric Cells only now.
---
Shirtless David King is uh... less likely to get killed the longer I look at him too.
---
They actually had a mechanic that revealed who the killer was right away and they took it out for a reason. Each killer had a specific hook design and if you could find a hook you knew the killer.
---
The reason this is bad is because you immediately know how to adjust your playstyle. If it's Hag then you know to crouch everywhere you can, if it's Mikey you know to look everywhere, and etc. 
---
I do think this is kind of a good idea, though. Even if there was 15% more chance for the killer to get there map, so it wasn't a guarantee but a bit higher. 
---
..is this supposed to be funny?
---
Cowboy Jake all day. Yehaw
---
HOW THE FUCK DOES EVERYONE KEEP GETTING OFF MY TRAPPER TRAPS FIRST TRY
---
IT'S SO FUCKING ANNOYING
---
ALMOST AS ANNOYING AS THE SWF LAST MATCH THAT HAD A GUY KEEP SABOTAGING ALL MY TRAPS LIKE THAT WAS HIS SOLE PURPOSE
---
Michael's main weapon is staring at you.
---
Nothing scarier than hearing the Tier 3 music and turning around to see that T-posing motherfucker
---
What? Legion is way better than pig. His mori is longer, more brutal, shows the legion sadistic nature, gives some struggling for the survivor, and that head shaking at the end makes me put the legion way up there.
---
Pig is quick, clean, and abrupt. Makes for a good mori to use gameplay wise because its so quick but is not entertaining to use at all. May be she should moved to "kinda boring" but she is nowhere near as good as Legion.
---
try watching a "Billy" Perk build 
---
montos billy builds are fun to play 
---
once you get used to him you will be able to apply pressure early in game or end game 
---
Even though you see it in the loading screen hallf the time? 
---
Even though they didnt remove the 'facing killer' tips?
---
I once got a Micheal to DC because I saved with a flashlight 5 times, I don’t know why he didn’t go after me or face a wall (this was all in a span of 5 minutes btw).
---
I'm betting it's either a plague doctor or knight.
---
If you are the killer you can do whatever you damn well please. You set the tone of the game, and you better believe that survivors will bully you if you give them any space to do so. You make the rules when you are killer and you definitely don’t have to abide by any survivors idea of how the game should be played. 
---
I play killer and survivor equally and survivors have much more potential and capability to give killers a hard time in-game. 
---
tyde time?
---
Lol makes sense if your gonna run scared in a corner bring a fucking med kit and botany 
---
If your not on the other side of the map afk then your tunneling camping and being bad obivusly /s
---
So why isnt the doc on top? 
---
As a maxed Freddy I would say it's because people honestly either 
---
A. Do not play him correctly
---
B. Don't play him at all 
---
C. Just buy into the hype and say he's trash
---
I love Freddy. I have plenty of 4Ks even in red ranks. Don't let people fool you- he's deadly in the right hands. Am I the best Freddy player? God no. I will say I am very competent with him and have worked over SWF groups that just send hate my way that I "camp" or "tunnel" which I don't believe I frequently do. However- you can play how you want and if it works for you- it works, man. You bought the damn game with your own money so do what works for you. 
---
Side note- I am absolutely horrible with the Huntress/Nurse
---
I play red ranks with Freddy, MMs, Hag, and Billy ( when I'm real sweaty )
---
Click the picture and spread your fingers to zoom?

just zoom :\^/
---
my fav meg outfit is her 80s ponytail, running vest and her jeans! my friend runs around in bizarre jake &amp; dwight outfits, one of her favs being jakes 80s fit!
---
Everyone saids get out of Tier 1 as fast as possibe, from my experince it has uses to stay in. Also...get rid of his perks as fast as possible, they do NOT work together at all. 
---
Yes but where did it come from?  I just started seeing it a few months in other games, posts, memes, unrelated to DBD.  It has become a thing and I don't get it.  Why S?  Why not keep A as the top?  Why is it such a meme?  What's the story?
---
Welcome to the 0.1%

Gets old after the first few lol.

we all want to have fun

i usually run object of obsession with bond just to get the killer of my back

HAAHHAHAAH

Thank u thank u thank u thank u

clown = big chungus

I think it started with smb tier list and peopoles started using this cuz why not
---
WHEN IS THIS GAME GETTING A DEV UPDATE REGARDING EVERYTHING WORNG WITH THIS GAME.  THEY THINK THEY ARE DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR, BUT FROM WHAT I CAN TELL THIS DWIGHT LOOKS LIKE TROUBLE. /S
---
Every time I play and find out that it was Myer. 
---
Nope bye 😂
---
Saw Saw SAW!!! Nah it's definatley the hammer, 
---
Sorry you came to quick allowing the killer to smack your limping ass down 
---
dont worry once your hooked you can try again \^\_6

I’m always at rank 1 in a few days after reset.  Maybe it used to somewhat mean better teammates, but a week after reset nowadays I still wind up with 3 others just urban evading all around the map not doing nothing all game.  It’s way too easy to rank up now, most survivors at high ranks are actual garbage.
---
At top levels when the survivors get real fucking good at juking you end up having to settle for hitting them through windows with the hammer most of the time 
---
You are wrong to camp. It’s not that hard to get 2 sacrifices 
---
psst it only does that the first few times you face a killer to help new players
---
My friend managed to give the killer the slip while I was spectating, yet he continued throwing down pallets for no reason despite me explaining that the killer gets a noise notification every single time.
---
Guess who got caught shortly after?
---
I mean you knew what you were buying. I bought it for Jeff like a week after it came out and it was bombed with reviews calling out legion for being cancer 
---
Because the person getting unhooked can’t do shit about it if you smack them back down after they get farmed 
---
Okay, better than GT yes. Better than Z during Buu saga, probably. But better than Saiyan through Cell sagas? I don't know chief.
---
Probably because OP likely isn't very good at survivor. He's running Urban. 
---
Me, an intellectual : there is "titty" in the word "entity" , so it's a female
---
Technically, that's also his bell because Autohaven Wreckers is his realm I think
---
No, it only works on generators.
---
i think paulie did a kyf with this set up to test of it does 
---
i think it does
---
&gt;Funny talk from the quitter throwing a hissyfit on a video game reddit because  people called him out on being an asshole.
---
Quote me at which point im throwing a 'hissy fit' please.
---
&gt;Cry harder dude, the community has spoken, we don't want you. 
---
Probably the funniest thing I've read all week
---
at least they didnt dc during the loading screen lol 
---
Just play a lot. The amount of shards you get per level up increases as you go up levels 
---
Cry harder
---
yeah when a gen is 85% done hillbilly’s terror radius drops to 0 and the chase music stops. 
---
I play on PC. So, not likely.
---
took me a bit to notice the nose and eyes'
---
but before this it just looked like a fucking ghost from mario "Boooo"
---
I'm the juggernaught biiitch!
---
the amount of repost makes them seem like a meme onto themselves lol 
---
cept the Thiccness tier list 
---
Technically, he doesn't own that bell. It belongs to the boss/owner of Autohaven Wreckers, Azarov. 
---
Not the same effect, because if it was like spirit with the addon where you can see scratch marks, then when you come out of frenzy, marks you couldn't see before would appear.
---
I spent shards on him and my first six matches all went just like that. I would just run at someone with my knife up and they would fall over dead (DC). Usually resulted in me sitting around waiting on one person to do a couple gens and leave because his awful team... Didn't feel much like a killer. So, I don't play him anymore.
---
I’m not saying it is the responsibility, by hook tunneling, I mean waiting for an unhook either nearby or by crouching, and immediately going to the injured survivor to down them.
---
I have 
---
But he owns part of Azarov now, so whos bell is it?
---

I AM PLAYING A LOT OF TRAPPER AND WHILE I'M HAVING A PRETTY GOOD TIME I REALLY WISH I COULD JUST RESET MY TRAP IN THE SAME PLACE WITHOUT HAVING TO PICK IT UP AND PUT IT BACK DOWN AGAIN IT WASTES A LOT OF TIME. 
---
Were you messing around in the basement a lot? 
---
My boyfriend was drunk when he was playing and we didn’t see who loaded into the game so we thought it was only two Dwight’s and he like chased one up the stairs then went back down and there was two more Dwight’s and he freaks out because there’s another so he screams, and we’re all just laughing so hard because he got so confused and frazzled (he rarely plays lol.) 
---
10/10 most entertaining game we’ve experienced. He was still talking about it a day later. 
---
Yzma riding kronk as the killer please
---
That’s farming and it’s almost just as bad, if not worse.
---
Giant sky spider
---
chests? you want cool presents from chests? here you go fellow teammate on a gen! off to the next chest!
---
Maybe he was transfering items between characters with the help of a friend. I did the same with all my characters with a friend, using both instaheals on a purple medkit and stupid combos like that.
---
Legion main being a cunt? Cue visible lack of shock 
---
I think he means running around with other people nearby. The scratch marks may be for you but they can inadvertently lead to other people.
---
I'VE HAD RECENT GAMES AGAINST SWF WHERE THEY REPEATEDLY FLASHLIGHT ME AND BODYBLOCK ME FROM TAKING SOMEONE TO THE HOOK. ON THE PLUS SIDE, I AM ON CONSOLE SO NO POST GAME CHAT. ON THE DOWNSIDE, I AM ON CONSOLE.
---
Really? A comment about being a repost? You are the worst type of person on reddit.
---
DARN
---
There’s nothing I want more in this game than that bunny outfit for her. Like I would drop money so quickly and change my main to her immediately. It would, by far, be the cutest outfit on the game. 
---
But until then, I’m sticking with my Kate in her snow outfit (which I like because it reminds me of Lara Croft and she’s my fave video games character lol) 
---
Survival is temporary, bloodpoints are forever!
---
Nothing against you, but this has been posted 40,000 times.
---
Don't chainsaw unless the survivor is out in the open(not around pallets and windows).
---
If you are getting ready to chainsaw a survivor, take your time to track their movement before actually chainsawing them. 
---
Rev your chainsaw for a half second before every pallet if you are being looped by survivors that are optimal, they will try not to use pallets and will keep looping, which results in a free hit.
---
Realize that most people play super stupid vs. Billys, they will try to prep for your chainsaw instead of optimally maneuvering around the map.
---
Sorry, I guess I am having a brainfart right now, because I don't know what part of my comment you're referring to.
---
No u
---
What if you are just normal walking?
---
Plunderers + AITH, throwing out purple keys and commodious toolboxes and medkits with insta heals to everyone. Ace main big brain. 
---
Also the "ranking" is more there as a sad attempt to balance the game. And most of the time you people just use SWF to go against people who are not on equal rank as them because at the end of the day they don't care about rank they care about being a bully and stroking there ego. 
---
EH YOU WANT SOME MONTROUS SHRINE AND INSIDIOUS?
---
Repost
---
I'll need to waste alot of blood points on her then 
---
I know, it’s spam
---
I wish, but there goes 35 levels of BP wasted on leatherface
---
The ad said 3000
---
GIVE ME MORE
---
I'm sure all the killers who were worried about being "pussies" will be crying now that you've said that. /s
---
Clown better. Clown thiccer
---
WHERE THE FUCK IS OUR DWIGHT COSMETIC?! IT'S WEDNESDY!!!
---
What are you even talking about 
---
You can still see if private profiles have a vac ban tho. unless they just recently changed it?
---
I didn’t mean to then
---
Well if they dc then ya mori isn’t really possible, (they’re no longer in the game)
---
and not even a thank you ✊😔
---
It wouldn’t do anything to stop it. I for sure would rather wait 5 mins on my phone than play against legion 
---
*awkward stare at camera for 2 more seconds*
---
The obvious choice is to make WGLF so the unhooked surv sees the killers aura for 4 seconds. Buffs a fairly useless perk and reduces the chance of being tunnelled off the hook. But I’d be happy with *anything* tbh. Feel like a selfish arsehole whenever I run it. 
---
It’s kinda rough and I used to adore this game as well, but everyone’s right, it’s not fun anymore. It’s just too competitive. Everyone makes it a competition to be the best and that gets tiring after a while. Shame, but I’m not sure what the devs can pull out of the bag for this one.
---
Honestly, I have played alot less this past month than I ever have simply because of the community. There has been so many DC's, camping, tunneling, not unhooking survivors, etc. The game itself I find to be fun and at a pretty good spot, but the people ruin it so much.
---
Jeff main can confirm
---
Killer is way easier to rank up than survivor, you can 1k and pip
---
They play DBD for at least 8 hours a day, of course eventually they will get bored and this would happen to any game they streamed, not just DBD.
---
I don't get why people care so much about the opinion of content creators. 
---
Marth not long ago whined and quit DBD like a little baby. Now tell me, what is he streaming nowadays? 
---
I have 1000hrs on console, I got used to it. Shitty lag and hits became a baseline honestly so you kinda can’t play properly. I really liked the game so that kept me forever but I got a pc and the quality is so much better I don’t even feel bad for leaving my console account behind. 
---
Yeah I've just finished watching this video.
---
Damn some of those hit boxes were insane haha 
---
I'm still sticking with the game though, play it nearly every day and still enjoying it.
---
“Wow have to use hex build are you that shit” its hilarious asf
---
Bee so good he should have his own tier
---
EVERY FUCKING MATCH THE HEX RUIN IS LEVEL 3 AND IT'S THE LAST FUCKING TOTEM YOU CLEANSE SERIOUSLY FUCK OFF WITH THIS LUCK WHENEVER I PLAY KILLER IT'S THE FIRST ONE THEY FIND AND WHEN I PLAY SURV IT'S ONLY SPAWNS INTO THE MAP AFTER 5 MINUTES
---
Prestige 3
---
The mean streets looks dope and so does night out Nea
---
Happens to every game. Halo, COD, Fortnite. People get bored and move on to the next game. All we can do is hope that these *servers* aren't to little to late, honestly don't think the game could survive if they fuck that up too.
---
I would think the biggest reason though might just be related to the amount of people who’ve downloaded the game when it was free, but just never really played. Wouldn’t that skew the numbers big time? I would think there’s probably tons of people who play a few times, say it’s not for them, and move on. I could be wrong but I’m assuming they would still count towards the percentage of players who haven’t accomplished something.
---
marth is streaming DBD again haha.   Its called game burnout, happens with every single game I have ever played in my life. Not sure why people are concerned by it.  hell, DBD has giving these guys tons of hours of play time.  Noob3 has over 5K hours of play time, which is insane! and Zub is probably right there
---
I bet I'm the only one who likes playing him and playing agianst him
---
Same
---
What? No, people who actually play a game that’s balanced and stream it exclusively don’t get tired of it, League streamers, hearthstone streamers, whatever, and zubat/noob aren’t “bored” of it, they’re tired of the unbalanced state of the game. People care about their opinions because they’re the voice of the community.
---
You can run around in the survivor tutorial for this btw
---
Yeah the players and the community are horrible. I feel like they should add more communication in the game, thst would make the teamwork better. Like in Apex Legends, the teamwork is booming. 
---
Literally had to stop watching him he’d complain about fuckin dead hard every two seconds 
---
Has winter come to dbd?
---
This sub is filled with casuals/new players who dont really understand the game very well. You arent going to get an actual discussion here. You can clearly see this when you see discussions about NOED or Legion. This game is in a really bad spot at the moment. I do not blame any of these guys for leaving the game at the moment because it just isnt worth to play at the moment.
---
If it's from down under why isn't it upside down 🤔
---
Slightly off topic, but how do you find out how many hours you’ve played the game on console? 
---
I feel targeted lol
---
that just means the survivors were within your play style, Good for you 
---
Word of advice on Super. If you want to watch the series, watch the movies for the first two arcs. Much better animation and they tell the same stuff pretty much with minor differences. Then, start on the episode after Ressurection F And Battle of Gods
---
Lmao ye 
---
Juggling? 
---
They probably used a 3rd party to derank bc EAC is a fucking joke that anyone with google can bypass. Idk why they would though rank 20 is boring as fuck if you know what you’re doing even with no perks
---
Freddy's sounds more like oof from roblox
---
Borrowed time? dont worry i got this 
---
This is false. Not sure if it works on pig boxes but it does indeed work on healing. 
---
In fact I’m pretty sure it works on pig boxes. Should work on any skill check in the game.
---
I wouldn’t call him more efficient in chases when clown can delete mind games and looping 
---
ME: OH BOY I CAN'T WAIT TO GET RUIN AND BBQ ON MY KILLER.
---
ENTITY: YOU ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD! GO BEAST OF PREY, OVERWHELMING PRESENCE, TERRITORIAL IMPERATIVE, AND PREDATOR!
---
FUNNY THING IS THAT WHILE I'M MEMEING I HAVE BOTH BEAST OF PREY AND TERRITORIAL IMPERATIVE ON MY NURSE RIGHT NOW. NOT USING THEM OBVIOUSLY BUT IT MAKES ME CRY INSIDE.
---
You misspelled Lamp
---
Pretty sure this is not intended and is therefore an exploit. Abusing this could be bannable
---
I mean the entity was probably looking for a unique sorta character(s) to add to the roster and since the Legion was a group of young agile people rather than one person they could've piqued it's interest and that's why he could of took them, or because since they were young and stupid it could've taken them to mild them into the killers it wants them to be

I’ve been no lifing nurse since I never wanted to touch her before and she’s amazing. My playstyle is kinda scummy stalling with slugs and stuff tho so I get flamed every other game :(. It’s all good though I can see why survivors would dislike it.
---
The Clown is truly an unit. 
---
I think it's just you since I'm on mobile and can see those type of memes perfectly fine
---
Nurse's main weapon is breath
---
I just found it out and I probably won’t do it again.
---
I just started using Mikey so I don't have any other perks. + I forgot to change it before using ebony mori
---
Oh :/ 
---
I'm not offended. You commented on this in disagreement that it was funny and I said you don't have to laugh or comment on my post. Pretty simple. 
---
Just checked, apparently you can see a VAC on a private profile. Friend told me wrong, my bad. But that furthers the point that there's no reason to make a profile private.
---
Just watched No0b3 video yeah  :-p
---
No serious now.
---
I can see where everyone is coming from.
---
I'm naively trusting that the devs know what they're doing and that they'll fix it.
---
I'm back. I accidentally unplugged my ethernet.
---
Nah, i'm a killer main myself. Just something i've seen and just seems like a jerk move. De-pipped both of us when I was trying to get my survivor rank up (so when i do play it i don't have potatoes for teammates) and just felt like a breaking of some honor code. Could have at least said 'i don't have time to farm, sorry' in post game chat, but no, nothing.
---
It's an Ultra Rare and it would only be if a Survivor failed a Skill Check while searching a Jigsaw Box. It's supposed to be powerful LOL.
---
Sorry but daddy myers is one of if not the best killer. I love jumpscaring and pulling people off gens with him!
---
Just don't want you to get reported/banned.
---
Really? Damn I didn't know that. Where can I find it?
---
Reposts
---
Like I said to the other guy I probably wont do it again. I’m just pointing out a bug in the game I thought was funny.
---
For context: all of the people who DCed did it mid mori animation.
---
Yeah, that would've sucked even more
---
I see him as a pay to win killer that's how I see him 
---
Automatic DC once I find out it’s Shinobi Legion
---
People say We’re Gonna Live Forever is good for beginners because it allows you to get bloodpoints very quickly, which then allows you to level up your characters very quickly.
---
I assume you’ve bought a few things on the bloodweb, so I’ll spare you the details of that. But a character levels up each time you complete a bloodweb for them. Your player level can level up from experience points gained from playing games.
---
I’d say play multiple characters at first to kind of figure out what perks you like playing with, but ultimately I would decide on somebody you like the perks of and level them up, either to play as them or get their teachables.
---
As I’m sure you’ve noticed, each playable character has their own unique perks; Jake’s are Calm Spirit, Saboteur, and Iron Will, for example. When you hit level 30, 35, and 40 with a character, their uniques will show up in the character’s bloodwebs as teachables. When you buy a teachable perk from the bloodweb, it now has the chance to show up in the bloodwebs of any other characters. Nobody will automatically receive the perk, they have to buy it with bloodpoints like normal.
---
And to your last question, yeah, kinda. That’s why I’d mess around a bit to figure out what perks you like, because at first you won’t get to use a whole lot. For me that’d probably be Claud for Self Care or Nea for Balanced Landing, but each player has their own preferences. Leveling up to 15 doesn’t take as long as you’d think, though, especially if you complete both tutorials for the free 50,000 bloodpoints.
---
Hopefully that answers a few of your questions! If ya got anything else, I’m always happy to try to help. :) Hope you enjoy the game!
---
Naughty 
---
I just don't see what the big deal is about NOED or DC.  It's so funny to me, the amount of people that get so worked up over these two perks. One is easily rendered useless and the other is a one time issue that can be worked around. I honestly don't remember the last time I've seen NOED used effectively, it isn't isn't an issue for me - maybe two games out of the last 2 weeks. (I play about 9-12 hours a week, not sure how many games that is) and if I suspect someone is running DS I slug them and use them as a distraction/bait.
---
Personally I find corn much more offensive than either of those perks. Lol
---
Fuck Fortnite. Play Apex Legends 
---
What killers then are not "pay to win"?
---
double the condoms, double the protection
---
More and more I struggle to continue enjoying this game. Every play session I deal with instantly joining lobbies with over 300 ping, loading screens I have to force close out of, and 3 man games because someone wasn't able to load in.
---
Then there's some of the garbage hits killers get while you're trying to loop that make you throw your hands up and wonder wtf.
---
Add in Legion who.. well I probably don't even need to go into this one.
---
Then there's what I think is one of the more fixable issues that they for some reason never touch.. the meta. Survivors have had the same meta forever now. I would love if they could even just mess with some of the numbers on perks to shake the meta up.
---
Imagine if they did things like letting quick and quiet have 3 consecutive uses before it went to cool down. And i'm not saying they need to buff all the survivor perks to make them meta, just switch out what is meta. So like.. nerf perks currently in the meta while buffing others to be so good that they are now the meta. 
---
It would be nice if every 3 months a wildly different build was considered the strongest for survivor. It would seriously help keep things fresh.
---
It's like if your bad hitting the chainsaw as hill Billy play Michael where you just get to teir 3 and just hit normally
---
Really? A comment complaining about a comment about this being a repost (which it is)? You are the worst type of person on Reddit
---
Yoo, congrats! Wanna come do my Nurse achievements for me?
---
Tldr git gud 
---
Are you upset little guy? What else do you know about me?
---
I'm so glad that I've started seeing him less. It used to be about one every 3-4 games I faced a legion. Now it's more like one in ten. 
---
Those rolling fields had such foreshadowing.
---
Lol gotcha👌
---
Either of the blue and black jackets with either the blue or black full length jeans could work. The blue "space" top also sounds like a good choice. I personally don't think her shade of blue hair works well with the red outfits available for her, but that's just me.
---
You technically can save money by buying full outfits, but that's if you pay only in auric cells. I'd save up shards for those items that can be bought with them, even though you might want to use auric cells. Depends on how much you grind of course.
---
For the longest time I thought it only affected generators and I never bothered to fact check it until now so thanks for calling me out lol.
---
I've been using unnerving and distressing on my pig recently just to get a similar effect but that takes focus away from generator pressure.
---
I don't understand why you didn't call the "clown" tier the "chonky" tier
---
Most of those guys have over 1000 hours in the game, can you blame them for getting frustrated and wanting to do something else? When you do anything for long enough the little things will start to become more and more irritating until all you have left is to be irritated about the game. This goes for quite a bit and covers a wide range of games as well. DBD isn’t a perfect game, it’s fun for sure, but not perfect. 
---
All that being said people put way too much weight and significance on what streamers do/don’t. 
---
Its like: i have a dick so im cosplaying dwight Zug in im 
---
&gt;back
---
ah victory
---
They didn’t. 
---
It's ez I used the offering to play the shape I always get the 4k without hex ruin he's ez to play as 
---
for me, it was the constant  "pop, POP" every time he kicked a pallet in a chase. 
---
Never thought of that thanks
---
Someday we gonna have it.....
---
New Jersey.
---
I'm sorry I'm unable to help you rectify that problem.
---
I think the game is only fun if you don't expect nothing of it and just meme your way to enjoyment really, but yeah, it's in a weird place. I play sometimes but less than before and not really trying my best :/
---
Yes, I read that it's an ultra rare. It's not that I don't understand it; it's just bad design. Powerful is fine (to a point) but this is silly. 30 seconds is wayyyyyyy too long to have unlimited aura reading (have you not noticed nothing is the game gives unlimited distance aura reading? There's a reason). You get into a chase (which will happen because you can't hide) and you can't lose the killer, so you're in for a 30 second loopfest which is unfun or going down, all because a teammate flubbed a skill check (one that is purposely small and frequent). If you're on a small map, get ready for that DC button. 
---
Killers won't have a use for it at higher ranks when skill checks are rarely missed and will be enormously frustrating at low ranks since the effect ruins what a survivor can do and lasts for a really long time. And this isn't the only one add on that gives an unneeded power boost to Peppa (but it's the most ridiculous). 
---
Sorry, this reeks of fandom wanting their character to be Superman. Pig is great and fun, perhaps needing some fun variety to the add-ons but not a power spike. 
---
I'll take a look at it then. Thanks a lot for the help!
---
Does he say that in this video ? I would watch , but I can’t at the moment. 
---
Honestly, you're gonna struggle with piggy without at. At R1, most survivors know the way to beat a piggy is to hard rush. You don't always need it, but, at the end of the day, Piggy is a late game killer, which is why NOED is a staple on her, and why you see so many pigs run it. 
---
Without getting too sidetracked, I'll agree that both NOED and DS are crutch ass perks, but if they're in the game, why not use them? Personally I don't run DS on surv because there are better perks to run, but on a late game killer, you're god damn right I'm gonna run NOED (obviously not on a billy or a nurse tho. that shit is unnecessary)
---
The puns in this are awesome and I loved the story. 10/10
---
I mean, you shouldn't be hitting people through pallets in the first place
---
First world probs
---
I dont necessarily think its communication as much as it is people being selfish and only wanting pips and bloodpoints. The only communication I MIGHT want to see added is a range based one where everyone can hear including the killer as in Friday the 13th. And for me personally it has just gotten bad the past month or so. Before it was here and there with the shitbaggery, but now its dang near every game. 
---
As a frequent killer player I resent that we are demonised in this depiction. That is all.
---
Right now, the only problem I've had with blinding is killers dropping survivors purposefully to avoid having them get flashlight saved. It just makes no sense to me that the killer can just avoid a mechanic that I had to learn to use well by using an animation to cancel out the save.
---
It's because they drop them late 
---
"You, sir, are a codfish."
---
this gme is just a huge ass bug are we really surprised? i love this game to death but this game is probably at its lowest at the moment
---
It's not.. learn to play me and my friend beat a good legion 
---
Me when I started playing Resident evil 2, couldn’t headshot for shit. 
---
That's intended, if someone was shining a flashlight at you irl and you looked up, they'd be shining your mouth/chin and it wouldn't be towards your eyes 
---
Then that's hitting them before they drop the pallet, not through the pallet
---
They always call it that
---
Yeah at the end of the video he claims he's gonna do other games.
---
I never pip with a 1k. I have to get at least a 2k to pip. Alot of people say that, I am obviously doing something wrong as killer lol. I'm not great but I'm not bad. I dont tunnel or camp. I usually will get at least 8 or 9 hooks but with only 1 kill I dont pip. 
---
I made this meme as a joke after my joke tier list (where I listed all the Killers' weapons) got half a dozen replies from r/iamverysmart people telling me that Billy and Leatherface use Chainsaws and not Hammers.
---
I mean at least it's not as bad as the 50 thousand people arguing over if Wraith's weapon is an axe, mace, club, crowbar, or just a plain old spine ~~(btw it's called "Azerov's Axe" in game so...)~~ but still.
---
So by extension you're saying the wraiths bell isn't his weapon? Dammit I've been doing things wrong this whole time 
---
As a killer main, I don't experience most of what he complains about in this video.
---
That said, ranking up as a killer IS way too easy. I'm Rank 3 right now, and I don't feel like I'm good enough to be Rank 3. More than that, it feels like every match is a fifty/fifty shot of going up against boosted survivors or going up against Seal Team Six SWF coordinating through voice comms on how to surround, crouch, and body block me into a corner whenever I finally down and pick up one of them.
---
I'm pretty new to the game still, only two weeks in, but with seventy hours played across those two weeks, I'd say I'm pretty addicted. Even still, I can see the problems creeping up and slowly draining my enjoyment of the game.
---
I just said how it is. If for you it’s better the keyboard then good for you 
---
Sure do love downing one person and just standing there waiting for someone to step in my domain.
---
Honestly, might as well be playing from the perspective of a bear trap.
---
This will be coming in the future update along with Dedicated servers. Right now, you join your friends server, who then transfers you to a killers server and it doesn't put you back to your friends server after. Once there is dedicated servers it will be possible to stay as a party post game
---
So you want to remove the ability to dodge a flashlight save? That’s not going to happen. 
---
I got the achivement for 4 Moris while running Shaman Waluigi (5 Totem Spirit) with Devour Hope.
---
I got called a cheater by one of the Rank 20s.
---
Its a bug, it happened with me too, while i was facing the huntress and Myers.
---
Also, i m 100% sure that its not tinkerer. Whenever i was inside the terror radius of the killer the music became too much louder but only the chase music, others sounds was normal.
---
Reseting the game fixed.
---
Didnt know they released 14 killers recently. They released one new killer recently and its honestly inexcusable how bad the design of legion is
---
this really wasn’t an insult, but while waiting for a lobby someone sent me a message (i play on the ps4) and they told me “i’ll protect you” so i messaged them back “i hope we both don’t die then !”. we went up against a pig and they were the first to die (-: my great knight in shining armor left me to fend for myself and i ended up being the last to die lol
---
Thank you, friend. 
---
He means after getting blinded, he doesn’t drop the survivor. If you start a flashlight save during the pickup animation it doesn’t work anymore 
---
What map is this? Give some more specifics so it can be patched out before Ochido exploits it on Switch.
---
tyler1, Ochido, or an edgy 14 year old who shouldn't be playing in the first place.
---
Have you seen the grand canyon lines on her forehead and dried up cleft lip? 
---
Agreed.
---
MODS REMOVED 2 OR 3 OF MY POSTS WHICH WERE LEGIT. I REALLY HATE THE MODS
---
ah so when you said killers it's only the one most recent one.
---
weird that you used the plural then
---
you also never said recently 
---
and legion is not as bad as the whiners here think
---
Do other team games have this much of a problem with DCers? I don't know why people play multiplayer games if all they do is DC.
---
Ya foo!
---
b!nG b0nG
---
Nope, depends on the game. Me and a friend both ran plundered and got 2 yellow flashlights, 1 green flashlight, and then finally a purple med kit. But some games I'll get a Ultra rare key and then a rainbow map.
---
It's not a butterfly knife but it's also not a switchblade. (That honor goes to the Mr. Carvey knife of the Sideshow Clown set) I think it's more akin to a flip knife, as seen by the handle on the side.
---
This is epic 
---
Ah shit thats pretty garbage, I can try and help if u want :D
---
Oink you sir. :)
---
If you got spirit fury maybe take that instead of brutal
---
She has air-claudes in.
---
Damn bro, touché. 
---
But Meg still has a better booty. ;)
---
Why can't I just say get better at the game without feeling like I'll get downvoted. I don't have to drop a survivor every time someone flashes me, I like to think I'm a decent killer. There are enough ways to avoid flashlight saves, saving is the only point in bringing a flashlight in the first place. You can take enough precautions to make flashlight saves almost impossible without using the drop animation to cancel it out, it looks like a glitch, it makes no sense how that animation somehow gives the killer the eyes of god and allows them to just suck up the light beam. It also makes no sense because flashlight saves are a way to punish the killer for not thinking about his pick up positioning and timing. Getting flashed is 9/10 times the killers fault, they shouldn't be able to negate that mechanic.
---
Behavior has also stated that (from Clown) they had 4 offical DLCs before considering liscensed ones. That would be Clown, Spirit, Legion, and whoever this fourth Killer is.
---
I would love to have Chuckie but I doubt it's happening anytime soon.
---
Sad face
---
Oh yeah forgot about that
---
I had an similar experience I was unhooking a survivor and just as the last generator popped the killer swung and got me with NOED. I was so sad
---
If you time it well it does. The save is supposed to happen after the animation is complete, if it isn't complete, it's unsuccessful
---
Nurse turns all the Survivors into anti-Vax kids and the Nurse kills them by coughing on them.
---
Add decisive strike somewhere to give the killer a reason to slug you.
---
Both of you are wrong. NEA IS BAE DAMMIT!!! 
---
Yeah I couldn't get behind the video because of this. Editing gets you far I guess.
---
God I hope so
---
I dunno,  you wanna wake up next to that face? xD 
---
Hey bro, that mini skirt, thigh high, and leather jacket? ;)
---
Everyone says that perks are random, but I swear to go I ALWAYS get 3 levels of deerstalker before any other perks start appearing in my bloodweb lmao.
---
*Titanic theme plays*
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
Honestly, no fucking clue. I'm trying to get a better perkS to replace it, but the Entity gave me 2 tiers of NOED.
---
100% true, being overly altruist is def a tuff one to overcome, you find yourself pretty much throwing the game by trying to fight facecamp for the vast majority of times 
---
You're overestimating the number of people who purposely derank .
---
You seem to think every green rank survivor is a former rank 1...
---
"Rank is meaningless below 14 or so" 
---
Yeah bud ok.
---
I tried playing Apex legends, but crawled back to DBD bloody and broken lol
---
Every killer nearly is lmao
---
Legion is cancerously unfun to play against and takes no skill to play. Saying you can beat legion is like saying you can beat a toddler in a race with a nail in your foot. Sure you’d win, but why the fuck would you want to do that. 
---
Literally today
---
(*we tell no one of this*)
---
Killer: Civil war era marksman.
---
Slow movement, low terror radius, can shoot 1 bullet and then has a long reload time. Scoped sight, and can shoot across the map. When being targeted with the scope you hear a soft terror radius. Add ons that allow for one shot downs if you get a headshot. 
---
Survivor will be a female field nurse wearing white. 
---
What is this? A tier list for ants!?
---
No it's not. People here have been apoplectic over Legion, saying this one killer would be the death of the game.
---
That's fucking silly
---
thank you for that laugh
---
Not much. Just sounds like you want them to be your average battle royale game
---
This is hilarious. I’m a fan of Tru3 for the most part. I enjoy his accent when he starts doing poorly or gets angry. Much prefer someone like Puppers who plays for fun. 
---
Spirit fury for dying light 
---
Only if I can use your mom's credit card :P
---
Well, yeah. Noob is the leader of entitled survivor whining 
---
Defeats the perpouse of the build, your supposed to hook the obssession, wait for unhook, and mori time.
---
It's nice to see what games people play, their personal message, screenshots, how many hours they have, and be able to leave a comment or add them (I honestly don't remember if you can add them or not), etc. Community interaction is nice.
---
Is this your normal build ? 
---
Honestly, when NOED is in play, I usually try to dip. I'm glad they left. There was no way they were going to live through the encounter, nor was I getting that bear trap off, or going to find the hatch with a killer on my ass.
---
I approve this message
---
Ohh, I found her, between Clown and Myers
---
The lobbies and loading screens can be fixed, and are not as big a deal as some make it seem.
---
The hit boxes are fine Imo.
---
Legion is hardly played.
---
Many perks are Meta, and a lot of people play different builds for fun.
---
If you are not having fun because you feel like you have to use Meta perks, it's not the game, it's you. You are limiting yourself by following the Meta, and being too competitive. 
---
For sure, they did poorly with their design. But yeah some people are like apoplectic over it
---
Parkour by Daylight
---
No, if I don't have a black box, I don't use dying light, and it depends on what I am feeling, but wasting pallets is very important for Freddy, but yeah, might wanna throw spirit fury into the mix
---
I FOUND [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idHE_7nAFtw) VIDEO REALLY HELPED ME WITH FLASHLIGHTS. NOT ALL OF IT IS RELEVANT, I THINK A LOT OF THE FLASHLIGHT STUFF WAS NEARER TO THE END.
---
what are you even talking about
---
It's not luck I'm telling you these survivors were trying to be toxic and just teir 3 down them these were rank 1 survivors before rank reset 
---
To clarify, I slammed a pallet on him as I woke up.
---
I didn't play one game if nurse for 6, starting doing achievements had to play her for adept got it in my first game.
---
First off no one is gonna see this post, but for the sake of getting it removed. This happened on the swamp with the boat. There are a few of these rocks, but the only two I’ve seen so far are to the west and north of the boat from where that one generator always spawns.
---
You know your arguing the same point as me right lol? 
---
&gt; Oh piss off
---
What did I say that warranted this aggression?
---
&gt; be it lag or / and hitboxes?
---
Once there are dedicated servers and less of a reliance on individual internet and how well individual survivors connect with the killer those things will be a lot more rare.
---
Already window hits have gotten better after devs fixed it so that survivors maintain their momentum after a vault 
---
Lol understandable
---
At least you CAN get it, us console plebs don't even get bill, just his perks.
---
thanks g :\^)
---
I have envisioned many disgusting scenes between punk Nea and Meg's red sweatpants. 
---
Help me. 
---
Urban Evasion is gross, it causes teammates to crouch around the whole map, which is slow af (and yes Ik it is the same speed as walking, which is still slow af) 
---
Pretty much. Every other add-on are just pointless.
---
Well that’s why you still get the tips

I would love character specific emotes, but the campfire thing would be a little too much and would break the mood of the game. Also, is Deathgarden still a thing? I thought that it died almost as soon as it came out.
---
legions not that bad. Hes painfully bland to play to play against and absolutely bonkers with addons but no more so than omegablink nurse. Hes not effective at getting more than one kill from any squad that isnt shit if he isnt running at least purple addons and probably wont even get the 1
---
Oof, thought this was gonna be a toxic killer post
---
Implying base legion isn’t toxic enough
---
Know who else did a T-pose? Jesus.
---
And then he no clipped into Heaven.
---
Thats my build right there XD I love seeing them trying to pick up their items.
---
Why are you waiting for Ruin or Nurses? Just level up her bloodweb and never even play her - thats what I did...
---
That's only because Huntress and Spirit are too **THICC** to have 115% movement speed.
---
"Already window hits have gotten better after devs fixed it so that survivors maintain their momentum after a vault" Yeah, that works 1 out of 10 times. Usually you still get pulled back to the window after running for a bit. Yes, I am hoping servers will fix a lot of these, but it will be highly dependent on the way they do them and still as I said I get BS hits as a killer as well. Also I didn't mean the "oh piss off" as aggressive, so sorry about that.
---
Mike is great against toxic t bagging survivors because they let you stalk them. Try against a team that rushes gens and urban evades everywhere
---
lmao, cant believe you got downvoted for being oblivious with the name dimwit
---
I for one, would always have Sunglasses Freddy equipped.
---
Unless they had the full outfit of The Entity from New Nightmare; in which case I would wear that 80% of the time.
---
Lol, if you only read this sub youd think the survivors were the ones sacrificing people with how much killers play victim about everything. 
---
It would be a lot more fun if ruin didn't get destroyed like 3 seconds into the match.
---
Wouldn't have mattered, as he would have to already be injured to access dead hard
---
THIS IS THE FIRST GAME THAT MAKES ME GENUINELY ANGRY

He's a survivor main in case you didn't know.
---
Read the title. "A bullshit hit compilation" Not a "A bullshit hitbox compilation".
---
Works great aswell
---
Cool idea but I don't know if Behaviour would be willing to add actual killers who existed in real life.
---
Not that im planning on doing it but i think i might. :D 
---
Do u have any dlcs?
---
&gt; If the killer is occupied chasing another survivor, you usually have enough time to heal under the hook. 
---
I dont know about that one. If the killer has it in mind to tunnel then they are gunna drop what ever they are doing and come find the person just un-hooked, especially if the person they are currently chasing is good at looping and giving them a hard time. There are enough killers that tunnel to warrant playing like all of them will until proven otherwise imo.
---
Huntress is just saving her leg energy to thigh-press Dwight's skull into a fine red paste.
---
Learn how to bodyblock windows.

Okay. People in this comment section are talking about hit boxes though. That's the exact confusion I'm talking about here

u/title2imagebot 
---
Big noob3 fan but this is one video I'll be skipping
---
With this game being free this past August that number is in no way accurate. 
---
damn, maybe Survivor is your role?
---
You mean Leatherface isn't real?
---
Not bad 
---
From what I’ve gathered is that it’s just not fun to play against / play as. It’s like their intended way is way too counter intuitive to how people actually play that killers just play this clunky tunnel lord of a legion and do fairly well. Their execution is a bit off on this one and idk how to make it hit the mark
---
There is a lot of map in your Corn.
---
Meg best girl.
---
Elements of his story were based on real incidents but he himself is not.
---
I neede the middle to be a bit more full, so some of them bit the bullet.
---
Lol yea man I never chase those first. They're so obvious in the fact that the want to be chased.. once the less good survivors burn through the pallets then I go for them.
---
TIL
---
what's the difference?
---
truly
---
i. hate. you.
---
I know that, but new content=new bugs
---
Ah ok
---
Same meme applies when survivors cleanse ruin in the first 15 seconds of the game😂
---
the middle needed a couple more people so some had to be dragged down or pulled up.
---
I almost completely agree with him, though there are a few more things I’d add to his list. But he’s right that the glacial slowness with which the devs fix bugs and implement balance changes in this game is incredibly frustrating as a player, and imo bad for the game’s long term health. People have been talking about a Freddy rework for months and months. Some killers, and perks (on both sides) are too strong and others are too weak and making tiny tiny changes once every month doesn’t do much to fix the overall game balance. 
---
I think I empathise with him because I’m burned out on the game too, though I’m nowhere near 5000 hours. Probably time I gave it a break.
---
Both sides have their problems...admitting that but god damn some huntress hatchet hits make me question reality.
---
I've been looking for this list for about a week, turns out it was in my heart all along.
---
STOP THIS MADNESS
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Gein
---
Here's the Wikipedia article on the guy leather face was based on if you're interested, pretty chilling stuff.
---
**Ed Gein**
---
Edward Theodore Gein (; August 27, 1906 – July 26, 1984), also known as The Butcher of Plainfield, was an American murderer and body snatcher. His crimes, committed around his hometown of Plainfield, Wisconsin, gathered widespread notoriety after authorities discovered that Gein had exhumed corpses from local graveyards and fashioned trophies and keepsakes from their bones and skin. Gein confessed to killing two women – tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954, and a Plainfield hardware store owner, Bernice Worden, in 1957. Gein was initially found unfit to stand trial and confined to a mental health facility.

Some had to be pulled around so the mid tiers werent so smol
---
Legion’s Mori is my favorite too. I’m actually kind of upset because I still haven’t gone against a Legion with a Mori. 
---
TIL that Jesus was the world's first hacker.
---
The only difference being that Michael's power doesn't perform the same function as a weapon, whereas Billy's does.
---
You could argue Billy's power is that he has two weapons, now you just have to figure out which one is his main one.
---
Perhaps...
---
Clown is simply clown, but THE Clown? That man c h o n k y
---
The best way you can react to trolls like that is to ignore them.
---
Not only does it piss THEM off immensely (see any of Noob3's videos where he's trying to do it and he reacts by getting frustrated or angry when killers won't put up with his sit) but also, if they're too cocky, too confident, and too frustrated, they will get RIGHT UP NEXT TO YOU.
---
Then you get a free hit. Then, depending on where in the map you are, you can start chasing them. Or just let them go heal and keep pressure on those working on gens.

i’ll probably delete in a few mins bc i don’t wanna promote toxicity but man im so annoyed. i wish these kinds of people would get banned
---
r/carterism 🤧
---
You sure brew
---
So you want Fortnite?
---
I support this, we should get some sort of bonus at the end if people DC. Maybe for 2+ dcs we can't de-pip?
---
Targeted? I'm a little lost.
---
It actually comes from the days of Hat trading in TF2, it was a way to call out scummy traders, which makes it even more weird that people in this game leave -reps, as I'm pretty sure no one has canceled a trade because the other was a camper.
---
If we assume OP is lying and made a post for attention, then we can't say for sure. If we assume OP is telling the truth, which I'm partial to doing because I've played matches like that before, then we have a pretty solid idea that they were all fairly useless. I don't know if you've payed attention to noob3 or not but it's kind of like that "doing gens, you?" meme that started because of a useless survivor he played with who couldn't finish the last gen even when he ran the killer for five minutes. Lots of BP, so that's nice, but still very aggravating.
---
And, as I am not OP, I can honestly say it has never bothered me enough to post about it. However, part of the reason this subreddit exists is to vent your grievances about whatever you view as "wrong" about this game, which can vary by person and by day/patch depending on some. Considering how many reiterations of "Legion sucks", "Legion doesn't suck", and "I don't get why the Legion hate" I see in one day I'm willing to take an AMA on "why I got peeved during this one match when I did good but my teammates did bad". :P
---
i would be actively buying more cosmetics if i knew what different ones looked like together tbh
---
i feel like this would ruin the game heavily because it would just be giving into the norms and take away the fun of saving up shards to purchase things instead of spending money, and they already have a few things that are solely auric cell purchases. i think emotes would cause too many people to stop playing because of the “toxic” behavior that already happens with the add ons and teabagging. imagine that amplified by 10, i also don’t think you’d be able to have time to fully use an emote. they’d also probably give off big sound notifications for the killer. 
---
It still amazes me how guys literally just don't comprehend that chicks also play games. Reason for me sticking to gender neutral names/colors, and being careful with vop games.
---
Here’s the thing. Legion is a thing devs can fix. Ya can’t fix people. Most likely OP is telling truth with a pinch of hyperbole. That’s different. That team member killed No0b3, in this these guys were just idiots.
---
Nah they’re just tbagging at the exit gates 
---
Yup agree with pretty much everything here. All the same reasons I have pretty much quit the game after 3k hours. It’s just boring and repetitive now. So many bugs and balance issues still. The devs have destroyed the decent game this was. The next killer will determine if I officially quit this game for good or not. Anything even close to legion or spirit or clown and I’m out! Was a fun game while it lasted. Take me back to patch 1.6!
---
You thought Leatherface was real?
---
You never seen Texas Chainsaw Massacre?
---
The Trapper is easily #2, blows my mind that you fucked that up so badly.
---
She decided that Arm Day is more important but still has the thickness of a Greek goddess. 
---
The animation frames continue for like a second or so after the animation stops playing. Which is how you can get blinded without dropping the survivor. Unless I’m understanding wrong that’s what You meant? That it’s possible to fuck up the timing and not get the save
---
Please could you guys share your thoughts on my content and tell me what you think needs improvement.
---
Thanks...
---
"NICE GRAPHICS!" Freddy's mind would be blown if he seen the games now.
---
I think it would be boring if you just stayed one killer, but the idea of mastering 1 a month sounds pretty intriguing and challenging. 
---
Id rather play against a legion than play against a spirit with prayer beads. Thats shits almost impossible yo
---
(oops still in rage mode)
---
But what about going with each killer i am trying to learn/master go to rank 1?
---
Hasn’t MYC been in the shrine like, 3 times this year?
---
At Rank 3 killer, I can tell you that most survivors do play that way lol. It can be pretty damn obnoxious, to be sure.
---
But at the same time, killer has been buffed a lot to avoid infinite chases, and it's not impossible to work around survivors like that. It's also not impossible to trick and down them pretty early on if you learn their strategies and counterplay them.
---
Really, in the end, only you can keep yourself occupied the entire game that way. The survivor doesn't decide what you choose to do.
---
Honestly, I found it was better to master one before I dabbled in others.  Sure, a few games here and there to test the waters, but overall I focused on one killer. 
---
I got to learn the maps, learn the proper way to chase, and most importantly, I learned survivor movements. 
---
After that, I began to really start playing all the other killers. It’s makes the game a lot less stale once you’ve got a grasp of them. I just usually cycle through all of them except nurse. 
---
Survivor: Haha yeah I kinda don't like being hit from twelve feet away
---
u/HexOhJeezOhNo : Wow entitled and whiny
---
But Spirit’s as thin as a rake. :0
---
I do agree with the Bunnymom analogy though. UwU 
---
Some time ago they changed the lobby animation for killers, now all of them have the trapper one... I'm still waiting BHVR.
---
For perks correct; you can still use items and offerings
---
D, Self Heal, Borrowed, Sprint... my guess, he DC'd first?
---
Leatherface is such an underrated killer. He might not be good for lower ranks (like, 7-1), based on who's playing him, but he is amazing for the higher and mid ranks. It's all dependent on your add-ons and the survivors your playing against, as well as your experience with him.
---
Ghostface... Passive Perk: Can hide in lockers with 0 terror radius. 
---
I tried nurse on my first month of playing on rank 4. It was a total disaster. I almost stopped playing her at all.
---
why would you even stay in a lobby if someone does that lol
---
It's always me 😥
---
Yeah for sure. I always feel bad for the team when I play killer and someone DCs immediately, because it usually hurts their team more than me (unless it starts a chain of DCs, then me and whoever is left get screwed out of a lot of bps and a fun game). Might lessen the blow a little if they at least get SOME bloodpoints out of it 
---
Thats not how this meme works, sorry
---
i had been waiting 20 mins for a game and also wasn’t sure if they were being jokey or not until after 
---
She requires a ton of practice. It’ll pay off eventually, but I wouldn’t force it if you’re not into her. 
---
"Hahaha your Irish go piss in a beer bottle and drink it you green prick"
---
Anyone looks like a rake compared to Mommy Huntress OwO
---
Yeah Spirit is kind of skinny though she skipped Leg day 
---
Here I am proud to ALMOST have every Killer on P3, then here you come and have nearly all surivors P3 aswell!
---
One time I was watching him and he was chasing a Jake who ran up a hill. He goes "Watch, he'll have Balanced Landing." And, sure enough, he does. Then he says "Notice how they always have the perk they need." Uhhh, yeah, he knew he had BL so he purposefully ran up the hill to trigger it. 🤦
---
Should say definitely won't.
---
Yeah you could do that as well, you get to learn everyone and not get burnt out just staying with one. I sometimes play new killer after every game or do the whole “ play killer who kills you” when I play survivor. 
---
But ya didnt watch it tho
---
Ok.
---
Jason cannot happen, he has his own game like this, and Trapper is literally a Jason knockoff. Pennywise would trump the shitty fat clown they already made. And Ted Bundy is literally real, come on now lol. 
---
fair enough .. i started to toggle of my chat &amp; have to say it helps alot. might be weird at the beginning but i recommend you to try it out
---
Does your ps4 only sound like that when playing this game or when your ps4 is on?
---
I think the threshhold for the auto-ban is like, 50% of your matches.
---
In viseo games i adore the characters that can blink, but when i tried to blink as nurse i was feeling so bad and i expected people to call me out on it since i deserved it with my knowledge of the nurse. I played worse than a free weekend player XD.
---
Just this game lmao 
---
As a dirty insidious LF, I totally agree.
---
Do it
---
Nice!
---
Then I have no explanation.
---
"Play the killer who kills you" now that sounds interesting. Going to implement that. Nice idea m8.
---
Let’s take a look at the exclusive Nintendo  Switch kille-
---
Although this community can be pretty toxic, people will recognize baby nurses and not be dicks. 
---
You have 8k hours on Steam and you're telling me that you just learned VAC bans are visible even if your profile is public? Not trying to make a point here, it's just... interesting.
---
Anyway, DbD has been the only game I've had trouble with in that sense. Usually I don't care much for PvP games so that's one huge reason. You can have double of those hours and still have few comments, it really depends on the games you tend to play. Also, I don't stay in the post-game chat for the majority of my games so salty people really feel the need to leave a comment on your profile or try to add you for a few nice words when they realize they can't leave comments anywhere. This community is such a shithole for the most part and yet I blame the game (for the most part) because DbD can really get the worst out of some people, I've seen even friends of mine going into rage for stupid plays. Not as bad as other games such as LoL or R6 just to name a couple, of course, but still... it's a toxic community. In any case it's your profile and you do whatever the fuck you want with it, I'm just saying that you're wrong if you think that only scum and cheaters put them on private. Some of us just want out of that stupid part of gaming... and again, I can't emphasize this enough: it depends on the games you usually play and not so much on how many hours you have on Steam in total.
---
Been confirmed for almost years now
---
That music legit spooked me when it started
---
 Only in the menu, when I have to press X. If I take too long, it sounds like a fucking airplane 
---
In the middle of the matches it’s fine tho 
---
Bit odd how everyone is a lot lower ranked than me though..🤔
---
always cleanse the hex!!!

MY BIGGEST PET PEEVES ON THIS GAME AS A SURVIVOR LARGELY HAS TO DO WITH MY TEAMMATES. I'M NOT SAYING I'M PERFECT, BUT I AT LEAST DON'T TAKE OFF RUNNING LIKE A FUCKWIT WHEN THE GEN GOES OFF OR I SEE THE KILLER. THEY CAN SEE YOUR TRACKS, FUCKO. I ALSO HATE IT WHEN EVERYONE COMES TO SAVE ME FROM THE HOOK AND IT TURNS INTO A GIANT GANGBANG WITH THE KILLER. YOU FUCKIN MORONS, I SWEAR. POP A GODDAMN GEN OR TWO WHILE I'M OCCUPYING THE KILLER, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.
---
Clown and Spirit are a blast to play as and against, and are far from broken killers, wut.
---
That’s not Ted Bundy. That’s Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates in Psycho.
---
Haha nice! New to the thread, didn't see that lol. Deleting and up voting yours
---
makes me want to hug them every time
---
Not for using hacks that altered gameplay, but hacked to get his legacy clothes back
---
Aw now i feel bad, you can have my meme my dude
---
You act like game development is easy and simple
---
*Bear, stop! Don't eat my kayak, bear!*
---
Well exactly.. That shouldn't be happening at all! They should be focusing on this instead of putting the game on the switch imo
---
Wow really? Thats awesome. Why do u think they are the hard ones? They time consuming or difficult?
---
Mmm matchmaking is meant to make matches according to your rank so it’s not so easy or hard for each player according to their experience and skills in the game 🤔 so a rank 11 is hardly fair I feel
---
the turning addons are solid but you get spoiled while using them
---
I swear... No one bothers to check for the answer in the game they're asking the question about lol. 
---
genetal
---
AYE \*finger guns\*
---
cmon guys 😂 it's a nice guy, better than noob or ochido, we all complain about something. i find true very powerful and funny, and i learn a lot about looping and mind game. "Fòk, that d-d-d-d-daaaaaamn ded 'ard"
---
DeVs don’t care about male survivors they are all bad sadly expect ace
---
Haha all good. I'll come up with a new one! :P
---
I know! I was wondering why the killer wasn't doing too hot. They were also playing legion haha
---
It looks like the silly rubber spider from the end of the IT made-for-TV movies.
---
Master a few (come one just 1 power per killer other games characters has more) but learn em all, so you just learn more about the game. For example you can learn about map control playing hag or loop with clown. 
---
Explain them trophies my man, i never really paid attention to the dlc trophies as they didn’t count. So if u get those two trophies u have 100% completion?
---
That's if *you* are unhooked, not when you unhook others.
---
Man, I've still never received a single comment on my steam profile. Do you have to sign up or anything? I've had some salty survivors after my matches, but never gotten a -rep or anything.
---
Rin's father was psychologically unstable and close to bankruptcy or foreclosure on their estate. He believed that killing those he was supposed to feed and take care of, would rid him of his problems. Didn't he kill her mom too? I can't remember exactly. That's when the Entity came after him, then switched to Rin because of how intense her emotions were, anger, betrayal, disappointment etc. The Entity feeds off of emotions.
---
my god ... i was 10 years old the first time i watched that damn episode ... fuck 
---
if they add pennywise i will never play the game again i want a killer thats got the hook for the hand
---
That cannot be right, I started October 2017 and got BBQ in November or December. 
---
To be fair, it's not entirely obvious to new people, and you can play every character and killer in the game without ever once looking at their backgrounds xD
---
your right they are both very interactive killers and don’t make me want to fall asleep every time I play against them :)
---
It’s the killers, they take the game a bit too seriously sometimes
---
people hated him because he told them the truth
---
That it is! My bad haha. Can't see him being a killer though, running around in his moms clothes and shit 😂
---
yknow, every time i swear i’m gonna do that, i have a nice post game chat with someone that changes my mind. i’ve made some decent friends playing this game and don’t want to close myself off just because of a few assholes. :( it’s a tough choice 
---
Prepared to be downvoted 
---
They had the power to leave the Fog all along. 
---
LMAO TAKE A DCS A VICTORY. ITS. MORE EMBARRASSING TO SC THAN TO GET KILLED TBH. IT KINDA FUCKS YOUR TEAM THOUGH ;( ESPECIALLY DS USERS THAT DC BECAUSE THEY MISS IT LMAO
---
I wasn't trying to compare the two, I was just using the Legion posts as an example to point out that this subreddit tends to have the same things posted again and again, so even a slight change in what I see being complained about is nice. Obviously I failed.
---
Haha true. They've actually got some pretty interesting back stories, was good to check out. 
---
this happens to me on the title menu, its a hardware issue
---
I think they said none are really good/they don’t have ideas
---
I did this one match. Knew the killer didn't have Ruin but I thought they might have Devour from the way they had been playing (racking up hooks and then getting away from the surv as far as possible basically) and I got two people downed and killed by popping it. Woopsie!
---
huntress' requires 100 long range (24+ meters)  downs (not hits)  and most mid to high rank survivors know how to dodge and legions requires a very specific playstyle (you won't get it in normal play)  as it requires you to be in killer instinct when you down them. 
---
It only happens on this game though 
---
Ok I read all their backstories I guess I forgot it’s been a while so did David just die is that what they’re implying in his backstory?
---
I made my joey mask out of a plastic mask, then hot glued a bandana over it so it's level with the mask, then painted the skull on.

---
Oink bad. Meat maker good.
---
S is above A because these tier lists are based off the tiers in old Japanese video games. (Probably because the original people who made these lists were fans/influenced by said games).
---
In Japan the grading system goes from S (or Shuu meaning 'exemplary'), to A (or Yuu meaning 'very good'), to B (or Ryoo meaning 'good'), to C (or Ka meaning average), to D (or Nin meaning acceptable), to F (or Fuka meaning failure).
---
How the hell did you get Skilled Huntress and Deranged Pursuit?
---
how often do you play
---
You have to do them in pretty bad. Well at least for me, i basement trapped them or basement defended when someone was in there trying to unhook or even chasing the guys that isbdead on hook instead of a clear hit on a healthy survivor is also considered toxic. There, some basic "how to get comments on a profile" tips.
---
I can see why the men are louder when injured then the women, simply because men are big babies. Killer should just put them out of their misery anyway.
---
(/s)
---
Every weekend 
---
Ace, buddy, why are you hitting on meg when you have kate? 
---
Ideally you’re gonna want to play either billy or nurse. Not to say other killers can’t get to rank 1, but it’s easiest with those 2. I also find that hooking the same survivor multiple times gets you more progress in your emblems than just confirming the kill on the first hook. So try to hook 1 person then chase a different 1 (which is why bbq is so good on high mobility killers like the 2 I mentioned). 
---
That's probably why, it's not often enough or something so you lose pip
---
then it is because you do not play as much as a lot of the other ppl complaining about it. pretty much to get to rank 1 you just play a lot even if you do bad pretty much
---
So each killer is excels in a specific survivor evading category, or does something way better than others, and by learning from each of those killers i can slowly grow into a better killer. Thanks for the advice. Made me more confident and determined to learn
---
Knocks down survivor near stairs, thinks the hook up there is garunteed so carries survivor all the way up just to find it's not there. Survivor wiggled off on the way down. Feels bad man.
---
I have comments turned off but had a public screenshot up. Dude commented -rep tunneled and used crutch perks. How is tier 1 sloppy butcher as my only perk a crutch lol
---
not me but I do get a glitch that when the killer is 32 meters of me I hear the music super loud like he is on my as but it is even louder than normal. it only happens sometimes
---
People wonder why the “try hards” stick to playing females. They’re quieter and have smaller frames so it’s easier to hide. 
---
Omg that sounds horrible. Ech. Did u go for the trophies or did u get them from playing so much, (probably  the first one not gonna lie) I tried playing the huntress once, but ehhhhh, that didnt go so well. 
---
I mori’d someone who then messaged me saying ‘nice cheats, you inverted my controls’
---
IIRC Lisa was 16 when she died and Anna was nabbed by the Entity around/after World War I. 
---
Anna was already infamous for her murderous antics at that point in time, meaning she's probably from around 1880 or 1890 (assuming she was 20-30 years old when the Entity grabbed her).
---
Yea thats it. Another example is spirit (one of my mains), teaching you how to use your ear. 
---
But thats how you pound them asses. Next to freddy and hag's spanking hands, and doctor coctor's dildo.
---
AS SOMEONE WHO LIKES TO PLAY WITH 1 OR 2 FRIENDS
---
[I COMPLETELY AGREE] (/intensifies)
---
Great so i am definetly failing at nurse and spirit. 2hard4me :l
---
theres /r/The_Fairfield for Dwight!
---
GOD I LOVE WHEN I CAN ACTUALLY GET GAMES AS KILLER. THE SLOG AS A SOLO SURVIVOR IS FUCKING EXCRUCIATING, I JUST WANT TO RELAX BUT THE WAIT TIMES ARE ALWAYS GARBAGE. I CANT IMAGINE WHY, WHEN KILLERS SEEM TO BE EXTRA TRYHARD WHEN ITS CLEAR THEY ARE AGAINST GARBAGE SURVIVORS OR SOMEONE DCs.
---
Actually, unless they have balanced landing, there is a way to drop them off the stairs, causing them to fall and be slowed down enough for you to hit them before they get back to the chest.
---
It needs to be at least... 3 times a big 
---
THANK YOU FOR USING "SOLE" AND NOT "SOUL." 
---
- YOUR FRIENDLY (ANGRY) NEIGHBORHOOD GRAMMAR SLAVE
---
So we agree? The hate mail is super infrequent. 
---
Either you share pity points by farming each other to spite the quitters or the killer ends it mercifully fast. Both are more ideal results than struggling fruitlessly for 10 minutes wasting both player's time.
---
Most importantly you can get back to the game being played the way it was meant to when the match ends.
---
Yeah, only just now found out Wraith has African origins from LeVaudevilleVillain. It's cool. :D
---
SORRY THAT HAPPENED, BUT AT LEAST IT'S FIXED NOW. YAY FOR THAT. THE ENTITY IS PLEASED. 
---
Nope, didnt work. Where can I report it?
---
I'll start working on their perks :p
---
Ranking is less about skill or how good you are, and more about just putting time in every day. The more you play, the higher your rank will be, even if you suck.
---
For instance, I've put in 70 hours these past two weeks and I'm currently Killer Rank 3. But I probably 'win' 1 in 3 games on average, and most of the time can barely get away with a single kill. It's definitely a problem.
---
This is on your own pal, clown and spirit are cool.
---
TBH I'd be pretty pissed they went to the effort to add ghostface and made if the millennial Lakewood bs
---
FUCK IT! LET’S GO ALL THE WAY IF WE’RE GONNA DO IT! SLAP FUKKIN’ COULOROPHOBIA ON THERE TOO!!!
---
I think I’ve been accused of lag switching almost once every night since I started playing. At this point it’s become yet another crybaby anthem for survivors who can’t accept they die every now and again in a game about killing
---
Fuck man but imagine if Wraith's mori was him putting the bell over their head and hitting it Looney Tunes style.
---
S rank is based off Japanese and has been around forever (before melee)
---
Changing IP address - viable for him, not too hard to make happen.
---
Changing hardware address - would be rather expensive to build new PC / buy new console.
---
Hide his info - BHVR will probably be able to find him by the location of his IP address, if they took the time to.
---
I don't think they're free on PC 
---
Look at this pleb. presses M1 while playing hillbilly. Absolutely disgraceful.
---
Could someone explain what the deal is with the bee meme? I don't know where it comes from or really what the joke is.
---
Try Legion. You can still pip with 1 kill due to his kit.
---
I just started playing killers, might actually be one lol ~~don’t tell anyone~~
---
I suppose some sort of additional conditions could have been used to end the game just in case the killer decides to take it hostage? Hm. Perhaps the hatch unlocks for the last survivor to end it, as well as the killer? 
---
It's the fucking Bee all over again
---
Father Death sounds a lot like "Dying Light", a obsession perk that already exists.
---
What would happen if Dying Light was stacked with Father Death? Might as well just commit suicide on the hook if the Killer is running both.
---
Ehhh… Lakewood would be OP on Lampkin, but not good anywhere else...
---
I also feel like Ghostface needs more "ooph" in general. We don't want another Legion, do we?
---
Also, maybe a better explanation for this ability would be best? And for why Survivors are carrying phones in a trial? And why they even have phones at all? And why they aren't just throwing them away?
---
"Time Warp"... I haven't seen the movies, but I feel like this doesn't match the character. Especially a "spiritual sense". Maybe something like... I dunno, "Call Recording", which is inspired of off telephone recordings? You could "rewind" back to a earlier position, or "fast forward" to a location in the distance or nearby.
---
You already have the phone idea. Why not try and build off of that? Add perks and develop the power around phones. Stretch your imagination if you want Photographer-like abilities. ;)
---
Well yeah, that’s what noed screams 
---
Me and my Devour Hope love you. Keep doing that &lt;3 
---
The best thing as Myers is when someone tea bag you because "i'm not at Stage 3" and getting f'ed by Devour Hope. 
---
I know it's not strong, but it's fun
---
Make Your Choice.
---
MYC was on in not too long ago! 
---
That sounds really hard
---
I feel as if survivors should be able to use selected perks/ items. Also if the killer is to earn 10.000 per kill he doesn’t earn any from other objectives right? One more thing is ranks should definitely be present... a rank 20 survivor faces a rank 1 killer? I see what your going for but maybe try to have 20-10 and 10-1 ranks face overall love it
---
I used to run self care, botany, empathy an that if you unhook someone heal them much faster, many careful unhooks were had, then a quick heal an away they went, since the game went free i noticed alot more people running self care, that plus more people running to the hook an the fact i play a certain survivor others think is toxic resulted in me unfortunately giving her up for Kate
---
Rank 16 and new to killer cut him some slack. Sigh. No need to be toxic.
---
Overall 9/10 for concept. Would love to see an idea like this. Only flaw is obviously there's some areas that you probably didn't think about when making it but that's okay
---
Also maybe if there was a unique mode for this game type where you're in a labyrinth and being hunted by the killer (kinda like the Minotaur)
---
You are wasting an add on if you use an ebony mori, because no one starts alone when you use one, so the obsession will be woken up almost immediately. I’d recommend either using an ivory mori or a different add on. Other than that it looks good.
---
This is actually really cool! I know that playing against killers like the Pig and Myers is fear-inducing just in the regular game (my personal experience), but in this mode it would be downright terrifying. Not having to do gens and just survive, damn that would be fun.
---
They really need a hide and go seek game mode where one or two killers goes up against 10-20 survivors and they get rewards for how long and what order they die in.
---
Had two people DC when I first started playing Spirit. Unfortunately I didn't notice this, and when the two survivors came running up to me, I promptly downed and hooked them. When I noticed the game was over then, I felt like the biggest asshole ever and apologized profusely in chat. They were cool about it and we all had a laugh but man o man I felt pretty damn lame.
---
Nothing surpasses the Bee.
---
Your comment is more of a joke in itself than a contribution with the spelling errors. lmao
---
I will let you do a gen, then knock you the fuck out, then carry you to the next gen, let you wiggle free,repeat.
---
How you got the legion one? The 25 stab, the bar can’t go up for me
---
Can't say I've been accused much of that when I play killer. However I'm plenty sure it happens. Toxic players exist on both sides for sure.
---
I'm more so trying to point out how on a specific post (and many others) on this sub people were actively saying that the person deserved to be "lagswitched" (for lack of a better term) because they were trying to get the killer to hit him at the gate by teabagging. Original post linked in another comment for full context.
---
WHY ARE VAULTS JUST NOT WORKING?
---
Can you explain to me how that’s being toxic? I’m a killer main and I would say that to anyone no matter the rank expect for Freddy mains they need all the help they can get. 
---
