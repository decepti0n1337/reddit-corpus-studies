First person mode would be amazing as survivors

That is the best thing I‚Äôve heard in my entire life.

Ok, sorry

Plus monitor and abuse, rabbit addon. He can make his radius zero in tier 1
---
We may not have known how Freddy was gonna work after rework, but a rework isn't gonna change a character's entire power so he would still be similar to how he was. Even if we didn't know how the Demogorgon was going to work, we knew that it could open portals. It wouldn't have been much of a stretch for anyone to assume that its power would be that. Pennywise has one useful ability. Shapeshifting. In DbD, it would be useless though. SwFs would be an instant counter.

Le console Nurse bad meme. Need those epic mouse skills to literally look either left or right. And the advanced slightly up to not end up in the basement. Hoo boy I'll have to contort my fingers into "the claw" formation to manage that on my PS4.
---
üëå
---
Can you name a few? Por favor.
---
Could've been playing on someone's account. My girl likes to play on mine sometimes bc I have higher level characters with better perks.
---
Love it amigo
---
Interesting...I am a Ghostface main who mains Legion has a secondary killer (both p3 full load outs) and I just discovered spirit! She‚Äôs fun. I like to think I have great game sense as a killer and she really rewards that...almost too easily. I can fuck up and still get the survivor. What are your perk builds for her?
---
watch him stream dead by daylight and he escapes 15 games in a row without moving a finger
---
I might be a cunt, but thats more than you or OP will ever get or be
---
I think I read somewhere on the forums that the devs said it is not bannable.
---
Yup, he was nearly impossible to see coming unless you heard his footsteps
---
Lets be honest dude I just easier to move on pc you arent locked to one sensitivity you can actually "flick" onto people
---
Like so many children. XD
---
Thats super toxic tho
---
Then you survicora wonder why we hate swfs
---
Perhaps the game has an issue with your specific graphics card or cpu (or maybe your parts are broken)
---
I always wanted to be Michael Myers but none were ever in stock at the Halloween shops near me. I truly wanted to cosplay as Michael at a mall one Halloween night and just hand out my candy bucket while not saying a word. Kind of pulled it off with Jason once and got a few scares, but it just didn‚Äôt feel right.
---
Oh nooo haha I feel so bad for him but man that‚Äôs a funny video. I feel so proud of myself when I juke killers like that.
---
I don‚Äôt see a Michael one. Is it equally adorable?
---
Nothing special, happens all the time in this cursed building. Disturbed Ward needs a solid rework. It's always like "if I don;t get them before they reach the building I have to leave them"
---
Sorry, new to the sub.
---
If Tru3 can be considered the hardened and tired veteran of DbD, Otz can definitely be seen as the optimistic prodigy, haha. He‚Äôs super wholesome, almost never talks bad about survivors, and is constantly giving helpful commentary at everything he is doing, as well as what the survivors he is facing are thinking. He also will make extremely long, detailed instructional videos on different killers, builds, perks, and other things. He‚Äôs always extremely friendly and a delight to watch!
---
What is this?
---
Pennywise has so much more than just shapeshifting but I don't wanna say anything in case ppl are wanting to avoid spoilers for chapter 2
---
They watched the ceiling, and the he Michael that came down to grab you.
---
Did they warn you? No...
---
...but they still watched the ceiling.
---
Nah, Cthulhu is just the High Priest. You're thinking something like Dagon or Azathoth or Nyarlathotep. In Lovecraft the Entity actually mimics Nyarlathotep, which means it would no doubt be one of the actual Old Gods themselves. Cthulhu is big but not nearly as powerful.
---
Nvidia gtx 740 Ti
---
Intel i5 6400
---
Dont really know more then that xd
---
He also just tends to react negatively to gameplay, getting frustrated at the game and the survivors he‚Äôs facing. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve been watching tru3 for years, but he is starting to be a bit more negative or pessimistic lately, which is understandable as the game does have many flaws.
---
If you're getting it on ps4 the huntress and David are free from the ps store
---
This already got posted yesterday. Stealing is bad kids.
---
And that‚Äôs not particularly the fault of the killer, it always sucks when you have shit teammates.
---
I swear every time I put mist, it‚Äôs game or leries.
---
I run Franklin's all the time on Hag so I can trap the items. You'd be surprised how careless people get when they go back for their item.
---
sauce?
---
YOU FOOOOOOLLLLL. THIS SUB IS MOSTLY YELLOW RANK SURVIVORS! RUN BEFORE YOU GET FLAMED!
---
These are the type of killers that cry "gen rush!" when they spend the whole match trying to bloodlust safe pallets.
---
Do your parents not love you or something
---
I've seen red ranks worse than this wraith honestly
---
So does nobody read the rules anymore or something? You're supposed to block names, aka no-name shaming.
---
He had an ebony mori. I dont feel bad
---
Mission accomplished
---
Oh shoot. You're right. I forgot killers aren't supposed to kill or have fun.

---
shirtless david is cool
---
Off topic but I gotta say that Alexei is the best!
---
It‚Äôs a picture of him dabbing with the caption ‚Äúkillin it‚Äù It‚Äôs dorky and I love it haha
---
I think in the next patch they are doing a buff to bloodpoints for survivors. I could be mistaken though.
---
Show us on the doll where the Stranger Things fandom touched you.
---
I hate it when killers get mad and try to kill me! They should just let me go!
---
Ur name doesn‚Äôt check out :)
---
They're making it so when you're the obession you get survival points for leaving and if you die so does that count a survival bp buff?
---
Don't get discouraged. The game takes skill to play well, the more you play the better you'll get. 
---
Focus on leveling one survivor at a time, unlock their teachable perks and you'll eventually be able to make the perfect survivor/killer build.
---
With my new internet being kinda shit, i sometimes cant hit skill checks to save my life...sorry
---
Bbq and chili! What a noon! For real tho this is so true . Why did you search this area longer than 5 sec!? ... I have whispers and the gen was touched ... Nu uh you are a wall hacker ! Blah blah
---
I literally just saw this exact post not long ago at all....
---
Okay, cool, cool, still against the rules though. And how long would it take to block out the name, like 10 seconds? This post is going to get removed by the mods anyhoo, and honestly, nobody cares about salt posts unless they're funny in some way.
---
The character is from Samurai Jack.
---
Well I have to be biased and go with Where's Dwighty
---
Yeah, Michael is like the Soviet Union. He chooses you.
---
And hard. Very hard.
---
Yes because normal Myers is such a stealthy threat. Myers could look like a outtake from Hotline Miami and he could still Jump Scare your ass.
---
Quick you have to take an in game screenshot of you visiting this beautiful monument before they pull it!
---
"Why are you booing me? I'm right!"
---
His power and perks need some buffs. Other than that, he‚Äôs alright.
---
This is actually a really hard totem to break if the killer checks it.
---
How about we put some speedo's on him/her/it &amp; have some glitterized "AHOY" across its butt... or whatever passes for it's but.
---
Not even close to being decent.
---
there both just as toxic
---
&gt;People who think this game is killer based are just bad at the game
---
Then this sub has more brain damage than I thought. I can go on and on about all the bullshit killers have put up with over the course of this game's history, but I'll get downvoted into oblivion for it because "HuUr duRr, KIlLeR oP!!"
---
And the survivor bias blinds people to the dumbest shit. You'll get posts whining about Moris, Iridescent Head, or Prayer Beads because they're op. That gets upvoted. 
---
Then there will be a post right under that complaining about Instaheals and gets downvoted. Instaheals are more common due to there being 4 times as many survivors who can run them vs killers who run Iridescent addons yet this post gets hate. *this sub is a killer circle jerk btw*
---
Okay so Nurse should be buffed so she can use Save the best for last?
---
You got any more of them frames?
---
I'm literally making jokes and you think I'm getting worked up? Rolf
---
Us mediacom boys relate
---
I know this thread is old but with monitor and abuse on small terror radius killers it can allow you to have 0 terror radius
---
I think we would all love to see a t-Rex put a survivor on a meat hook. You fucking idiot
---
Didn't know :) I found it on instagram which is where most memes on her come from.
---
Otz And HybridPanda are my go to for wholesome DBD content üò≠üíñ
---
It‚Äôs more that he hyper focuses on the negative elements of the game that he critiques. Like, Otz and other entertainers also criticize the faults, but it tends to be that almost every game Tru3 tends to make constant remarks and comments on the issues. Basically he kind of comes off with a more complainy commentary instead of constructive.
---
I just got it to lol
---
You‚Äôre too dangerous to be kept alive!
---
I hope he sees this üòÇ
---
Yep. Made a joke, realized it was in poor taste and deleted it.
---
You know what they say man; ‚Äúif it glows, it goes.‚Äù
---
Chibi Cucaloo. Steve Jackson fans have been giving them to thier kids nieces and nephews for over a decade.
---
Welcome to the fog. 
---
Hope you enjoy all the shirtless Myers memes.
---
How old is she, because they don‚Äôt want anyone that isn‚Äôt an adult. Why they didn‚Äôt add any of the younger kids from stranger things.
---
That could be possible but they would have to use the alarm clock to wake up, which is new. But even if it was the old Freddy getting woken up in a chase won't do much for you except buy a few
---
Didn't know it was a meme to begin with. No /s. Always thought it was a legit wish of the majority.
---
All love my guy that's understandable.  I'd rather have someone that atleast tries to do gens then someone that doesn't
---
Cool idea but can we get a non licensed chapter first so I can spend my 20k shards?
---
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a repost and was drawn before plague came out
---
*survivor does anything decent or possibly predicts he has a standard perk and attempts to counter it* 
---
True: probably stream sniping
---
I don‚Äôt think he realises that not everybody in the dbd community knows who he is.
---
[Original post](http://becomethememe.ga)
---
Hopefully kinda feel like survivor and killer BP gains should be more equal.
---
S'okay, is my bad. I was mostly just being a nitpicky fan of the series, and going "Well, TECHNICALLY Jamie hasn't existed since H20 in '98."
---
But yeah, you're not wrong. But poor H3, removed forever!
---
Honestly the one gripe I have with Tru3 (coming from a long time sub) is that he'll get 10 bucks or 1k bits or Tier 2 sub for a custom build, and if he doesn't get a meta build he'll complain all the way through.
---
At least use parenthesis when quoting, mate. It makes more sense that way.
---
The better version of your comment before any edits were made to it is below
---
*‚Äùthey said ‚Äòmy points, bitch.‚Äô‚Äù*
---
Yeah right. Fuck off, dude. Not Otzdarva is a WAY better killer than this loser.
---
Funny how before Otzdarva's rise to dbd fame, it was generally accepted that lower tier killers, specially trapper, were generally seen as unplayable/unwinnable without crutch perks like ruin or noed.
---
Imo and personal experience watching big dbd streamers, it's partly their uncreative outlook of the game trickling down to their viewers quickly judging every new killer perk as trash or un-useable immediately when released, I myself is guilty of this and am trying to change.
---
I smile whenever I see a big streamer play wraith or leatherface now and running STBFL or PWYF and acting like they've ran it like that ever since, or just not acknowledging it at all.
---
Don't get me wrong, not hating on dbd streamers, everyone has a different entertainment value and can be super fun to watch. It's just sad that  auto-dc'ing on Haddonfield or auto-dc'ing when playing against prayerbead spirit is an acceptable thing nowadays.

Agreed. I got tired of his constant complaining a long time ago. Additionally, his Twitch chat seems to be the kind of place where opinions and interesting conversation go to die. Lots of narrow minded fanboys who think he is infallible.

This happened to me last night. I saw him across the map, unmistakable, moving through all the tiles. I continue working on the gen with another after he crosses by. He hits me from behind a moment later. None of us saw him

What map is this anyway? Haddonfield?
---
lee would be a pretty bad killer tbh
---
Not really, they‚Äôre just using game mechanics. That killer could have made it into the basement and dodged the flashlight. Not sure why he didn‚Äôt ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
But overall, the rate that the gens get done in general is out of the Killer's hands. Killers can only chase one person, and chasing someone for too long is detrimental. Survivors, without Ruin, can easily do one gen in the time it takes to walk from one side of the map to the other. Against uncoordinated or mistake prone teams, NOED isn't necessary. However, majority of the teams you will face at rank 8 and beyond are not as mistake prone and are almost always 2+ man teams who communicate. Against those, who will almost always run the meta perks, NOED may be what you have to fall back on, even if you don't want to.
---
But he usually does bring it up every game - even when he‚Äôs not actually being impeded by some unfair game mechanic, he cries wolf and accuses people of stream sniping, or whines when he gets looped by an ‚Äúoptimal survivor.‚Äù He also had a very clever way of excusing his tunnelling by claiming he is ‚Äúfocusing on the weak player in the team.‚Äù All that means is he abandons the person who is looping him and beelines straight back to the hook. You can see it in a lot of his killer VODs.
---
Slugging ain't a bad strat, u just used the wrong killer for it.

Was that what I fucking said? No dipshit, it wasn't

---
Whispers is godly.
---
Its not about being offended its about protecting peoples privacy. If you cant follow a rule as simple as not giving away peoples information you shouldnt be here.
---
Yeah the killer should set aside their only objective, killing survivors, to... kill... a survivor.
---
Sure didn‚Äôt thank you period
---
Ya that's not toxic at all man lol
---
no, i know for a fact legion, ghost face, and spirit have unique music themes on the killer menu
---
You sort of answered your own question. Pipping (ranking up) is what the game determines as a "win", which is still possible even if you didn't accomplish what most consider a "win". You can pip even if you die, thus technically winning even if you failed your main goal. Same with Killer, you can kill nobody, but hooking all 4 people twice, holding off the gens for over 10 minutes, and consistently hitting and chasing people can still give you a pip, even if you failed your goal of killing anyone. 
---
You can also do your objective, escape or kill everyone, and depip. So as far as the system is concerned, pipping is winning, even if you actually failed in your main objective.
---

Aah, no plague? I wanted to see a nurse Vommy Mommy!

i don't think they should let me go, that'd be boring, i just think they shouldn't be a little bitch and get mad in the first place.
---
I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôve been outplayed because.... he wiggles out of my arms because the hook was far away? like last time I checked you didn‚Äôt place the hooks soooo

---
That was a thank you tbag you idiot.
---
I think it would be better if you could aim the buckets and splash at him instead of needing to be damaged first so that you could counter him before you take damage.
---
Other than that, this is a really cool concept!
---
Also, what would his mori be?
---
Exactly
---
Because its like dropping a survivor at a hatch and morying them or teabagging at exit gates, its toxic
---
Lol
---
Was that a bathroom joke?
---
What‚Äôs wrong with it?

How can someone be so ignorant and stupid in 2019 when we have things like google? Like, if you‚Äôre not sure about something, google it. Takes seconds.
---
This is perfect lol love this movie
---
It‚Äôs too op tbh
---
Assets as in taking direct "inspiration" from the ST sets, with little creative properties of their own. Not that they were given meshes or anything (though I reckon that some of the set elements and props were CGI, too, so it wouldn't be impossible either).
---
you know dancing at exits to thank you? I mean teabagging isnt always toxic.
---
Slugging isn't bannable don't worry. It can be toxic depending on the scenario but just ignore them and move on.
---
No, you cannot get banned for slugging and it‚Äôs not toxic. It‚Äôs a really good strategy to use when survivors are rushing through gens quickly and you need to apply pressure. Those survivors were just salty about losing, so don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you can get banned for slugging. Sometimes as killer it makes sense to slug survivors but is very situational imo. It‚Äôs really annoying for survivors if you‚Äôre just doing it to be an asshole though.
---
Oh silly me, it seems that I have forgotten that killers can't get any points in any other category like putting pressure on gens to get gatekeeper points
---
[removed]
---
I think a good one to buy Is leatherface, he has a really good perk called Bbq and chili, which let's you see survivors auras from a certain distance and increases bp stacks every hook on a different survivor. Clown is a good one for bamboozle. Spirit has some good perks too. Just my opinion.
---
Kinda interesting risks being OP
---
It's annoying but not really toxic. People who call it toxic are just r/entitledsurvivors
---
We would know it if a feature in-game would be bannable. Ignore the toxicity, you did nothing wrong.
---
$1.50 total though. Doesn't sound like allot but for me it is.
---
I don‚Äôt do it to be an asshole. I do it to pressure gens. If I slug all of them I always put them on hooks. I don‚Äôt wait for them to bleed out or anything
---
Slugging is not a thing that can get you banned last time I checked it‚Äôs just a method of pressure that makes people mad because it‚Äôs boring for survivors who are being slugged but it‚Äôs a valid strategy if you don‚Äôt always do it and use it when necessary. 
---
(From a killer and survivor player at rank 6 each)
---
My post history? Ur a joke. -13 karma off only comments. Kill yourself
---
well... yes..? they did take direct inspiration because the dlc was literally about the demogorgon and nancy and steve? did you expect them to change how they look? at that point it would be a parody. and i hope you understand the license to the st things in the game said the characters were the one and only thing that had to be exact. they made the characters from scratch as well. they were very creative with the dlc as well. some of the rooms in the game didn‚Äôt exist in the original show, they made them to fit the map. did you see the hooks as well? how about the upside down part of the map?
---
Name: the fear
---
Height:small
---
Speed: 4.0
---
terror radius: 32/ 40
---
power: fear itself 
---
"They are frightened of the unknown"
---
When a survivor is outside of your terror radius+8 meters their fear gauge builds when the gauge is full  they will beging seeing phantom the fears doing a variety of actions
---
 (running, opening lockers, chasing phantom survivors)(note red stain and heart beat are attached to phantoms)
---
By confronting their fears they can break out of terrors grasp(pallet stun) 
---
The fear can toggle his power to 
---
A: stop fear gain
---
B:take the appearance of a random survivor in any state beaing chased by a phantom fear
---
(Note: while transformed the fear cannot do any actions associated with both killers or survivors)
---
If the fear toggles back with and attack he will burst out and instantly raise the fear gauge of any one within a 8(?) Meter radius
---
Mori: the fear disappears from behind the survivor who is standing looking behind him before turning around to see the fear dancing  behind him, the survivor turns to run and runs straight into the fear who knocks him down and the survivor raises and arm before the fear eats it and then raking his claws over the survivors head

**Get Leatherface** if you're planning on playing a lot of Killer. Barbeque and Franklin's will carry you far.
---
Hag, Freddy, and Clown are also good purchases if you want strong Killers and good perks.
---
HALLOWEEN, Spark of Madness, and Shattered Bloodlines are just generally good purchases.
---
Pig and Legion are kinda weak but they can be fun.
---
Avoid Plague she sucks.
---
It's basically a word in our community that means noob or someone who's new to the game.
---
It was popularized by some specific players, 1 of which has been banned multiple times.
---
Yes. Look up Not Otzdarva. He makes entertaining and informative videos on a pretty regular basis.
---
0. HITS.
---
Nice
---
Fair enough
---
If they don't release this for Halloween....
---
Since Adrenaline is a perk, how about we go back to the old Mori on first down?
---
Since Prove Thyself is a perk, how about we go back to the old 120 second generators?
---
Since Borrowed Time is a perk, how about we go back to the old facecampable hooks?
---
Oh there's 2 people that are together and 2 randoms, let me tunnel the shit out of the package players.... /s
---
If the killer gets to see who's together, what items they bringing. We should get to see who the killer is up front.
---
It means you kill babies. You're a baby killer since you're killing whiny crybaby survivors.
---
Yes, and?
---
Slugging is necessary if you really need pressure. If the slugged survivor doesn't have Unbreakable, you basically force one survivor to pick them up and you'd be chasing another survivor making only one survivor working on gens. If done correctly, no one will be working on gens and having a survivor hooked with another slugged basically forces survivors off gens.
---
Slugging won't be very strong however if survivors stay separated and they avoid going down fast. You have to realize when it works and when it won't. If the first survivor you have slugged has Unbreakable and the other survivors know he has Unbreakable but you're not applying pressure to other survivors or the next survivor being chased is competent, then you won't snowball well.
---
Huntress imo is the most reliant killer on slugging. A Huntress that just chases and hooks immediately will not have the pressure and chase power to apply to survivors unless the survivors screw up horribly or the map heavily favors Huntress.
---
depends on when you slug really, if you are slugging at 5 gens, there is a pretty decent probability you are being toxic. Slugging at 1 gen however, that isn't toxic, you are just applying pressure by immobalizing the survivors
---
It's just scummy
---
The thought of the characters merging together was, the camping wasnt. The way the person described it, in my imagination the image was yes giggle worthy, the fact he got camped is annoying.
---
Yeah it's funny when people misspell *Demigorgon*
---
Okay I will
---
I don't have teachable STBFL, sadly. I'm a survivor main.

This would be amazing but Clem's only 16 and I don't think BHVR has any reason to add her.

That mood switch tho

Almost as bad as sopposed

Angry molesting tree, for sure..

Care to elaborate? I don't watch Jen.

Multiple as in more than 2 hits. With full health, sometimes he gets me down in just 2 hits and other times it takes him more than 2.
---
I don't need your pity heathen
---
Dragonbat is a close second.
---
That never happened though...
---
Tru3 constantly praises survivors or killers that beat him. The only time I've ever seen him mention stream sniping is when he legit had a couple of guys stalking him every stream for months.
---
That's the one, thanks.
---
Thank you!! I just figured agitation works really well on trapper to get people to basement or not waste time getting to a hook. Every second counts!
---
I would have loved to see his mori be like when Stanley got attacked in the sewer, with him biting the survivor‚Äôs face as they wriggle around, but that‚Äôs too much like the Demogorgon‚Äôs mori
---
Sexy Witches
---
He‚Äôs been a lot more pessimistic and complains a lot, but he complains for good reasons. He complains about gen rushing which is understandable because after the first hook, 2-3 gens are already finished. He talks a lot about balance and is extremely pessimistic nowadays.
---
Ah fuck dude
---
Don't forget my favourite one- not playing his best against survivors who know how to play the game well and then bitching about how survivors are overpowered, when he's clearly getting out played. 
---
Add that in with him saying that he's pretty much always right, and how it seems like anyone with a different opinion then him, no matter what evidence they present to support it, is wrong. No matter what.
---
I don‚Äôt think that the entity has size manipulation so Cthulhu would work in a trial but the entity would absolutely never I put an emphasis on never let a survivor die unless they completely lost hope and the entity ain‚Äôt no slouch in it‚Äôs realm it has manipulation over the realm and could most likely stop people from dying and could probably withstand Cthulhu thus if Cthulhu was in the realm nothing would happen he wouldn‚Äôt even be a killer he‚Äôd just be kinda sitting there trapped 
---
To sum it up nobody hurts the enity‚Äôs babies on its watch

I have agreed with things he has complained about in regards to balance, but just as a player he‚Äôs annoying. He is one of the voices that I believe the devs should listen to however.
---
Flair checks out. Shit idea, mate.
---
I've always wanted a fire-based Killer in DBD so I decided to create a concept for one. This is Annie Robinson, The Arsonist. Born into a wealthy Victorian family her future was already decided, but there was one thing she wasn't happy about, her chosen husband. In an act of rebellion Annie burnt down her family home, killing herself and her entire family.

Ruin isn‚Äôt bad, but you might enjoy switching it with something like corrupt intervention or surveillance. CI gives you a little extra time in the beginning to set up your traps (since early game trapper is rough), and surveillance is perfect for when you‚Äôre down to the last one or two gens
---
Agitation is nice, but it might be nice to pick up Infectious Fright (it might also be worth swapping BBQ out for it). This perk will tell you whether it‚Äôs better to hook someone, or leave them slugged and chase after another person
---
Enduring is a really good pick for almost anyone to help in chases, but I‚Äôd sooner recommend STBfL for Trapper. Not only can his traps give him free stacks, but forcing his obsession to step in a trap means he‚Äôs one of the few killers that can hook an obsession without losing stacks
---
Now it is
---
He really is the best, and ranges from helpful info to downright goofy at times.
---
His power allows him to run fast and vault pallets and windows slightly faster. If he hits you and you see your screen turn gray then he used his power. He won't be able to down you unless his power deactivates or you don't heal from his first hit.
---
&gt;did you expect them to change how they look?
---
...........No? .................... I am responding to a topic that argues this is the best chapter yet due to how creative it is, when it is literally an implementation of an existing creative property.
---
Made the characters from scratch? How so?
---
They made some custom-fitted rooms, sure, but the general aesthetic and prop lineup was already a given. I'm not saying it's garbage uncreative work, I'm saying it's not noteworthily creative either. Certainly not any more so than some of the "original" maps, like a Yamaoka or Ormond. What is in the map that you consider to be notably inventive, trademark design work?
---
The hooks and upside down parts of the map are also directly "inspired" or "derived" from the show, which again, is totally okay and a good look, but not notably creative. Going from the dark vines and roots from the show to dark vines and roots shaped into a hook is kind of just the most obvious thing?
---
And I mean, the Upside-Down visuals of the Demogorgon's ability are pretty awful, basically just black.
---
Again, I'm not arguing the design work here is overall bad, or that the entire Chapter is, but the amount of "creativity"  involved is probably one of the lesser arguments I would use.
---
Basically
---
Just a Dwight for the safety of my post since Smol Billy wasn‚Äôt relevant xD
---
Otzdarva (spelling?)
---
No, you let her have her damn happy ending.
---
As in this month?
---
She down ranks on purpose to face baby killer players and calls them "boosted" when they beat her. Her chat is a hivemind of people who believe shes an untouchable special angel and can do no wrong. If she was a guy, she'd be treated like Ochiido was.
---
How do you know who has a VAC ban
---
Ahh yes. Not surprising. I think there's a lot of high profile streamers that are unfortunately really bad influences on the community. People will say that it's not up to them to police their behavior I bet, but people can be sheeps at time. Myself included!
---
The fact that he makes off meta builds and routinely wins at red ranks disproves the community on so many levels.
---
The Halloween event started early
---
I check their steam profile. VAC/Game Ban on record? I mori them and them only.
---
Sexy witches
---
Unless it was teamates only
---
I think it's an interesting power. It reminds me a bit of Plauge but i'm down for it. I feel like the Stop, Drop &amp; Roll animation would be hilarious. Question is how long it'd take.
---
In terms of perks, Clammy Palms seems a little OP. Depending on what you mean by impossible. Also how often it'd trigger.
---
1000 **¬∞**  Knife is cool in theory but it is underwhelming. Stridor is way superior but you can make the perk stronger by maybe making they're blood turn into some sort of lit ashes that are very visible. It'd be a cool tracking perk. Especially good on Spirit.
---
Getting Sweaty is also very good but I think it'd need a harder punishment because 4.5% after 3 hits is pretty strong on certain killers. I think you'd have to lose all tokens after a miss. Really punish you for whiffing.
---
Overall this is great, thanks for tagging me. I forgot I even made the template :)
---
im actually surprised more companies dont do the 1 character vs 4 characters thing. Evolve was the first one i heard of like that, but it sucks. very slow and tedious to evolve the monster despite that that was the gimmick of the game. however, from the description you gave, it doesnt sound like its basically the RE version of DBD, like where you can play as Chris, Jill, etc, versus monsters like Tyrant or what have you
---
Only Plague cleanse and Freddy self wake up count to survival as those are forms of healing yourself. Traps and GF reveal are bold points.
---
That would be a huge flop. No one would want Lee as a killer. hes too wholesome
---
At base, 1 survivor on a gen will work at 1c/s (charge per second), 2 survivors on a gen will work at 0.9c/s (1.8c/s total) 3 survivors will work at 0.8c/s (2.4c/s) and 4 survivors will be 0.7c/s (2.8c/s)
---
with prove thyself, this degradation gets nullified, so 2 survivors will do 0.99c/s (0.9 x 1.10) 
---
3 survivors will be 0.96c/s (0.8 x 1.20), 
---
and 4 survivors will be 0.91c/s (0.7 x 1.30)
---
Plus side is if you add extra money maybe you can use the extra for the Stranger Things DLC?
---
keep trying buddy. sorry it happened.
---
Bleh. Gross to hear. It's a good thing I don't watch her!
---
Why not both?
---
The perks you named I don't have :( could look into getting them..
---
He‚Äôs messing with you. If that‚Äôs ur only defense, nobody‚Äôs gonna van you for that.
---
Makes it foggier
---
The new technician buff is looking good.
---
Oh
---
Eh, I plan on buying that outright from the Steam store anyway. No need for Auric Cells.
---
Ok thank u for telling me this, it calms me down knowing I can play my favorite game
---
Darn, shitty situation my dude
---
You didnt have to do him like that lmao, poor kid
---
The glorious white knight has arisen.
---
I dont like how overused the invisible cunt meme is, but I do like it as a nickname for Wraith.
---
Same! I‚Äôve got 1mil bps with an extra 120k bps saved up in daily‚Äôs. And for the first time ever, I‚Äôm spending it on my boi Steve instead of a new killer
---
Hush... that's a secret fellow hooker.
---
yes
---
If you want to play the game that way, it's ok. I don't get why people get mad about this. It just makes the game boring (if survivors know how to play the game, which is just rushing gens and leaving) though.
---
There's multiple other cosmetic sets that do the same thing oh you can get  500 cells for it but it's just above that so how about ya pay another 5 dweeb(good thing they're earnable with shards because that would be bull if it wasn't). The reason it's that price though is most likely because the drill is animated and makes a unique noise.
---
wow, how fun, standing in 1 spot.
---
Woah, that‚Äôs like, 7 pixels!
---
lol
---
I ran into a ghostface who would leave, enter his cloaked state and try to stalk me behind a tree whenever i looped him. I had spine chill so i exposed him every time plus I was already injured.
---
What is with the quality of killers today?
---
What are the other sets? I looked on the entire storefront a moment ago and the only one I saw at this price was Pig Leather. Were there skins that came before that were priced like this?
---
The power is fine then. But yes the perk is bad infectious. Failing a skill check reveals a location of a survivor
---
Ghostface was bad. Somehow got disoriented with all of them, easily couldve looked slightly up to be immune to flashlights. This is quite the opposite of toxic, I wish survs tried to do this to me 24 7. Keep them off gens? Get some free hits? Yes please.
---
It was confirmed that it was $11.99.
---
I believe so! Although I think it's more gray instead of black.
---
There some cosmetics that have the same rarity but one of them would be Auric Cells only and it‚Äôs slightly bit higher which is really bs
---
It depends on the energy behind the squat. I do weird shit to killers all the time, and form unspoken bonds with them. Squat, rubberneck, shine my flashlight on my teammates foreheads. Always gets me on their good side for a little while.
---
I wasn‚Äôt running decisive, but lol.
---
This is the stuff of nightmares.
---
Love the new pig coat and drill weapon. They did a great job with the animation and drill sound. A whole new type of jumpscareüòÇ
---
what
---
Lol nea is the killer XD
---
It's really just the devs taking perks
---
haha dweet locker new protect hahahahaha
---
No and No. But as Survivor slugging is super annoying, kinda like getting blinded while stomping a pallet. Not toxic but really annoying.
---
Im talking the squats your personal trainer trained you for. The rapid fire squats that flex your running muscles, showing the killer that you are better than them, at least until you run into a trap or a hatchet or a chainsaw.
---
They stalked him for a couple of weeks not months.
---
They are the green(rare) sets in the shop, sure they might be earnable with shards but it's kinda of a kick in the balls anyways because the outfits price is being just below 10 or just above 5. They've been doing this so long but just slap a iridescent tag on it meaning it's ok but once it's a licensed cosmetic set people get mad about it.
---
Or it's because I enjoy doing things like this?
---
Lmao
---
Don't delete
---
Honest question, whats the point in playing like this? I can't see how this is any fun at all. 
---
maybe its because you are an xbox player /s
---
Devs already said they wont put kids in the game. Cuz they dont want the hag ripping out there liver and monching on it.
---
And this kids, is why we don't have nice things
---
I don't think Insta heals even compare to most pink/purple killer addons
---
All right, I can only help on console though.
---
So when the killer is about 1-3 meters away, your gonna want to (if your going left) move both analog sticks to the center and you will spin in a 180/360, (depending on time you hold them in, and you can go to 720/1080 if your feeling like a toxic c***.) If you want to go right, move both analog sticks to the outside.
---
Rinse and Repeat.
---
Survalince is good one Fred but discordance is waaay better on him. Also use Pop goes the Weasle instead of fired up.
---
Happens to the best of us
---
Aw, I just missed the opportunity of making a baseball joke, "hey batter batter".
---
I feel bad when my teammates do that. I'll usually let the killer beat the shit out of me a little more to compensate for my rude teammates
---
Thank you.
---
Prove it.
---
Sure thing.
---
Head to AppData\Local\DeadByDaylight\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor and first of all delete the Engine.ini and GameUserSettings.ini if you have modified them in any way. Then launch the game - this will automatically create new, fresh inis. Close the game.
---
In the GameUserSettings.ini, you want to set:
---
    ScreenResolution=100
---
    FullScreen=True
---
    FullscreenMode=0
---
    LastConfirmedFullscreenMode=0
---
    PreferredFullscreenMode=0
---
Then, you only need to adjust these two entries to set your desired resolution:
---
    ResolutionSizeX=1920
---
    ResolutionSizeY=1080
---
Obviously replacing 1920 and 1080 with whatever parameters correspond to your desired resolution. Do make sure it is a resolution your GPU/monitor support (so if it is non-native, you have to first create a custom resolution).
---
More settings you want to adjust:
---
    ScalabilityLevel=0 - this sets the game to "low" quality; 1/2/3 are medium, high and ultra, respectively
---
    MainVolume=100 - global volume levels, adjust accordingly
---
    MenuMusicVolume=0 - music volume levels, adjust accordingly
---
    UseHeadphones=True
---
    HideTutorial=True
---
    AutoAdjust=False
---
    bUseDynamicResolution=False
---
    bUseVSync=False
---
Some settings you want to leave blank:
---
    LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeX=
---
    LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeY=
---
    DesiredScreenWidth=
---
    DesiredScreenHeight=
---
    LastUserConfirmedDesiredScreenWidth=
---
    LastUserConfirmedDesiredScreenHeight=
---
    LastRecommendedScreenWidth=
---
    LastRecommendedScreenHeight=
---
Setting you want to adjust if you want to set a custom framerate:
---
    FrameRateLimit=60.000000
---
Obviously replacing 60 with a cap of your choosing, or 1000, if you want to uncap your framerate.
---
Afterwards, set the GameUserSettings.ini to read-only.
---
Finally, add this launch parameter to Dead by Daylight in your Steam library: -fullscreen
---
Have fun!
---
People like you are the reason people hate this character.
---
ive literally never met someone thats toxic in this game

---
If youre doing a slug build you kinda need knockout or third seal, or both
---
Slug as much as you need it. You should do it to make pressure and understanding when to do it and when to dont is something you will need at higher ranks.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have mattered I‚Äôm pretty sure at least two were swf
---
Sans for dbd maybe? We already got him into smash
---
Thanks, I'm glad I could make you so happy :D
---
Goddamn satisfying! Taking down the cocky ones when the gates open are always satisfying.
---
You really care that much to check beforehand? Lmao
---
SWF doesnt auto make them know where eachother are, theyre still gonna have to say "oh im back near the pallet near the gen by the building" and have to run around to find them. Them being SWF makes it even easier to hit them if you know which of them are SWFing
---
I don‚Äôt wanna give anyone the wrong impression but I love OTZ.
---
This is really cool
---
myers and trapper got me a lil ü•µü•µ

The only solution is to delete existence.
---
Pleeeeaaaaase!!! New chapter is out on my birthday can you just bless all Fengs?
---
YES
---
Your addons aren't the best. I'd recommend Trapper Bag over Stitched Bag, as it allows you to instantly relocate a trap that you find early on so that you don't have to place one first. Also, you're better off with a darkening addon instead of the trap down.
---
My mom and Dad are like this, The question on why we play games like this?....Some like the challenge, some love the grind, and Others just love the passion that makes us feel alive, even if that passion is mindless rage.
---
YW!
---
Sorry for not having responded earlier, I didn't notice you had replied to this. Should you have any questions, feel free to reply again.
---
Not just Goblins but Dismemberment Goblins

And the potatoes!
---
He said unused pallets are unaffected...
---
Chucky!!!
---
Do what i do, crash their game over and over just for laughs
---
How would you hit him? I feel like if you have to forfeit an item it should passively splash him, also remember the paint is permanent unless he finds the basement and takes 10 seconds to wash, giving survivors plenty of time to go for gens or totems or more buckets.
---
Switch release is technically out of the Summer.
---
Next week is the last full week of Summer.
---
People are always so salty
---
Gives a good chubby!!!
---
I forgot what I mapped my skill check button to on my controller, thought it was a different button, and blew up every single gen I touched until I realized.
---
For a while, I thought I was missing each skill check by a millisecond.
---
Rather tame considering, Expect worse because it certainly doesn't get better.
---
Also if your steam comment section is set to public, I'd put that to friends too because people like to go there and babyrage.
---
If you want an AMAZING source for trapper, I'd 100% recommend a streamer called Otzdarva. His youtube channel for dbd is called Not Otzdarva, and he is an absolutely spectacular man. He is quite possibly the smartest content creator I know.
---
nobody-
---
the doctor-
---
(picture of the torture scene from a clockwork orange)
---
am i funny yet?
---
Something to enjoy unlike on console
---
I love Otz!! He's why I started playing Trapper. He taught me a lot and he is a total sweetie.
---
Yup, a killer who does madness right.
---
Fake pallets, hearing tr at random and multiple doctor copies is all cool and all, but have you ever had your mind flayed open by the unspeakable horror of sight no longer being sight, but instead harrowing visions of the abyss swallowing you whole, tearing you asunder in millions of different scenarios for all of time, the very worst of it is that you are only safe in your sleep, but the crippling anxiety of when daylight first breaks , your waking nightmares return again, more refined and terrifying.
---
Daylight never comes in the Fog, and with the exception of Freddy, neither does the blissfully temporary escape of rest.
---
 It seems like a good perk, though it should render the pallet that was reset weaker. Maybe the pallet could be broken 50% faster and/or a 30% weaker stun.
---
They should add Noob and True. I‚Äôd say Monto, but I feel like his hair would probably be a pain in the ass for the devs.
---
That‚Äôd be funny something I can show my friends
---
Oh man just seeing the title and then meme actually somehow caused me pain before I saw (my) the comments attached, like a nauseating sense of deja Vu. Wp sir.
---
Stay gold, ponyboy.
---
Absolutely my favourite content creator / streamer for dbd.
---
That claudette looks like barb

---
YupüòÇüòÇ
---
God damnit beat me to it lol
---
At least bring sloppy butcher or  coulrophobia if ur gonna slug .
---
Lol, my bad. Great book though. Also, were you the one who gave me the silver?
---
IMO I‚Äôd switch out Agitation for Bitter, then also switch out Enduring for Brutal! üòÅ
---
It is, and I was :P
---
I‚Äôm grinding for bbq for the points but I might need ruin eventually but I may just took on people with the nurse. Just had some people say I was playing too sweaty with the cannibal when he‚Äôs not even that good imo I‚Äôm better with billy
---
Haha, tell us another!
---
Do you have a headset or earphones to plug into your controller to hear better? You should try that if you haven't.
---
True, maybe red stain is too much.
---
Wait, can I do that?
---
An actual quality legion mask AND scoops ahoy? Damn, this post just keeps getting better and better
---
I wonder what they‚Äôd think watching fungoose play. Hes on another level sometimes its great.
---
if they ever did this, i‚Äôd be down for a ‚Äúwiggle off the hook‚Äù feature where you gotta wiggle your joystick and hit skill checks or something
---
Spent 50$ on some aimbot hackz for huntress, divorced my wife in the process but at least im getting 4ks im every match
---
Thanks for the compliment made the mask myself!
---
I only saw the title at first...got a little excited...still am
---
Or maybe actual demons.
---
that‚Äôs a very specific situation to get lucky in
---
Yep. I do it all the time to play at night.
---
I was actually wondering where that zarya voice line came from. Thanks
---
Thank God, I was worried.
---
I mean if you get a bigger bundle you can boy our lord and savior Scoopy Boi immediately as well.
---
Ummm I'm pretty sure it's not the same person, bud
---
If they stretch any farther they're gonna pull something.
---
Holy shit you're right! Omg this is so much better. Thank you, for real man. You just saved my spirit experience
---
*cries in legion and plague*
---
Oh. Holy shit lmao so instead of paying for the textures on the house, they stole it?
---
It'll be the Merman one of these days, you'll see!!
---
Ah, so it has come full circle. You‚Äôve finally admitted to stealing my content ideas.
---
Yeah I usually play with some cheap 10 dollar Panasonic earbuds plugged into my controller. I don't play Spirit, but they get the job done.
---
Np. Good luck!
---
Dont most streamers derank because queue times are longer the higher ranks you go?
---
I like the idea but I don't like the aspect of survivors being able to tell what addon you're running immediately. Also being tombstoned by a bedsheet would be pretty funny.
---
bUt wE dIDNt knOw It waS STAn!
---
My favorite dbd youtuber! :0
---
Dedicated servers coming please bam with these types of posts mods
---
I'd rather have Art the clown from Terrifier over Pennywise.
---
5 gens would get done, all totems would be cleansed, all chests searched, and both exits opened in the time it takes to walk across the map.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇSO FUN
---
Only if the classic Tim Curry version is in as a cosmetic
---
Fuck me, I knew all the Haddonfield stuff, but I never realised that was considered a short fence. That's nuts.
---
I think they‚Äôd either go with bill or ben
---
Hahaha this happens on dedicated servers
---
One purple bottle is the max effect.
---
Haddonfield rarely happens 
---
But I get SO many people on this fence, especially with LF and his saw
---
Very likely it was just a placeholder they forgot to change. BHVR has too much money to risk getting sued for stock photos
---
i only do that when behind or they flash light save
---
I'm curious, what does "doused" mean for a survivor, since they would have to touch fire anyway to get burned? Do they not get burned if they aren't doused first?
---
Guys I shit you not today I played a match where I did 4 and a half gens
---
Lucky
---
They should make it where if you stand a certain meter near the hook the bar won't go down
---
I still get a few on Haddonfield if they end up on the house side and you're on the open side, it's so narrow they just don't think about it. Especially if you fake mind games so they think you're an idiot and come too close.
---
So who would be above him? Definitely Azathoth.
---
she‚Äôs a kid in the early seasons of twd but I‚Äôm fairly certain at the end she‚Äôs 18 or older
---
Must be my survivors, they wised up to it, it's been a few months since I got a cheeky Haddon Fence hit  
---
But swamp fence, almost a weekly hit
---
I hate people who bring up Assassin's Creed with the hidden blade, when it came out AFTER it was used in Saw.
---
Thank you, just happy to get the numbers out there.
---
Oh hey, it's my ruin totem. My haunted grounds totems are under a tree behind a bush in a building that nobody would go in...
---
Yeah, even his "lesser" monsters would result in an absolute slaughter.
---
No it‚Äôs not if anything it‚Äôs better unnerving presence
---
But leveling up doesn't really do anything for you after you get teachables.  What's the point in having level 50 bloodwebs and getting them?
---
You can hear him walking/landing, and Mike breathes really loud for a killer.
---
Hex: They all float
---
Totems spawn in the sky. Can't break them.
---
*"I farted....smells like onions"* -Mcote
---
It was used in Saw 1. It's when Tapp gets his throat cut.
---
[Yeah it was](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5LZfv0tLZKE)
---
Nice movie collection.
---
Well, it‚Äôs more complicated because all the names of the killers are based on what the survivors would call them
---
Report them. Send this video along their user name to BHVR reporting website or to 
---
deadbydaylight@bhvr.com
---
Appreciate it homie!
---
has nothing to do with Servers tho
---
yeah its not otzdarva
---
Oh, yeah. You're right... I totally forgot about that. I guess because it's only used that one time. Sorry, I'm dumb. But the rest of my meme still stands.
---
Im not too big on buying things for video games, i have more fun earning them the old fashioned way :)) thanks tho!!
---
the mori should be this: The Xenomorph Spits Acid at the survivors causing them to go on their knees, the Xeno crawls to them and head bites them
---
Noted, thanks!
---
No less two were P3 Claudette‚Äôs and SWF, and despite that they all disconnected after the first one did, luckily the killer was nice and gave me hatch.
---
Lmfao absolute gold
---
The shape for sure.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a neat idea
---
Why ?
---
he was already banned for theft, dont worry
---
bubba doesn‚Äôt deserve this
---
i will avenge bubba
---
bubba main
---
Shape hands down the clown isnt as reliable
---
I would like it to be Shape‚Äôs stalking music
---
Hardly a 'new idea' lol.
---
Playing Freddy on Rotten Fields is a nightmare for any visual tracking.
---
Corn blindess is real when combined with the dream world.
---
The shape is probably the better pick in my opinion, Clown is underrated for a reason, although he can hinder survivors slowing them down with the bottles the chance of them working in your favor are very slim, I‚Äôve yet to see any really good clowns, most of the time they end up missing their bottle throws on me and I loop them 7 - 10 times before I have to throw the pallet down or get hit, the Shape overall is better as you can build up to the exposed status effect over time and not have to rely on a area of effect, along with building up your tier 2 to 99 and when you see a group of survivors you take your chance and get multiple down, the Shape over all is stealthier and can increase his lungs by a lot with the tier upgrades.
---
I believe he said on stream that they stalled for 2 or 3 weeks i don't remember which is which. A small price to pay for being paid tens of thousands a year for playing a video game. Not everyone is so fortunate
---
Mark me down as scared and horny
---
BHVR doesn‚Äôt give a single fuck about console in terms of reports. They go NO WHERE. I‚Äôve reported people for using actual exploits, lag switches, and for things like this and only gotten automated responses and seen the same person still on the game no problem later on.
---
I would love to see this happen!!! But not sure if they will do this since they already have Clown hmmm...
---
That is the issue though. BHVR has never cared about the console ports in terms of game health, performance, and reports.
---
Think how I feel mate, I'm deaf in my left ear so headsets don't work for me either. Pity, I really like spirit.
---
Yes, they‚Äôre multipled by whatever offering you bring, including BBQ.
---
i would totally main one of the losers if they where survivors
---
That's a yikes from me
---
I get mad when my entire team has the combined IQ of a cucumber in ranked and I have done more than they have probably done in their last 5 matches combined.  oh and the entire enemy team is partied up.
---
If you don't hit survivors or the wall the cooldown is smaller than the time nurse has to do her second blink.

Why would you dodge any game? How do you know the offerings not a shroud of separation, or that all the toolboxes are brown and the SWF is just trying to have fun? You cant just assume that the games going to be bad before you even played it
---
Leeezzzzz dooooo diissssss
---
*this is a JoJo reference whether you like it or not*
---
Hehe, I am so surprised to have positive karma. I wasn't being sarcastic at all with what I said.
---
Complaining about sabo lol. 
---
I love finding sabo teams, can make the game really engaging
---
Gotta keep lobbydodging to get randoms for maximum fun.
---
Except it gets every health and performance update PC gets. The only performance issue "exclusive" to console is the main menu uncapped frame rate, which is a thing on PC too. They started banning people on console a while ago too
---
It's like they don't realize you can lose tons of progress if you are playing a ranked gamemode on something like D2 or R6.
---
That‚Äôs perfect. 
---
Instead of a heartbeat, we can have him [whistle](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RzUI2eKFltI), like how Huntress has her humming.

Yeah, they gotta work a bit more on their glutes first.
---
Could someone translate this for me?
---
i play on pc so they may be different
---
Why I cant play against this type of survivors instead of a swf sweaty and toxic team?
---
I know people on console who have received 3 day bans because of Mori spamming, which apparently increases to one month and permanent bans if they continue. This survivor working with killer (friend) thing has happened to be twice as survivor but don't know if anything has actually happened to them, even after they both likely received 3 reports each.
---
I play siege and overwatch, I get that.
---
Take a joke, ur so sensitive guys
---
I meant tweaking haha. Autocorrect hnnnng.
---
yea, once had a freddy try to pull someone off of a gen as they were lagging out, fully disconnected and he was stuck there for the entire rest of the game. poor fella.
---
I hate getting DSed but I love when people run Head On for some reason. Makes me smile every time I see it.
---
She's just as old as Steve, Nancy, and Laurie.
---
you broke him
---
I've almost drowned when i was a kid and i find this shit funny too
---
I think we can all agree that trapper looks the hottest
---
How is that creepy at all? Looks like an employee from bed bath and beyond chased me down cause i forgot my receipt
---
GeN rUsHiNg Is OP!1!1!!!!

Yesm

Campfire from the home screen with the home screen emblems as the menu icons. Please.

how could I forget this one
---
If the cooldown weren't quite as long I'd def give it to thrilling tremors.
---
I love the demon house / house of horrors!

Sounds like someone just got facecamped

---
Yes you do
---
This is why I like trapper. You can be 3 gens down with only 1 hook and in a heart beat be inches from a 4k. He might not be top teir but he's my favorite :)
---
Is this confirmed?
---
Tbh, I love playing Plague after rank reset. EVERYBODY CLEANSES. Easy pips &amp; it‚Äôs a nightmare. 
---
Especially Plague with Devour Hope.
---
Otz Best Boy 2019 fite me
---
Well, i mean, if your trying to kill a group of people, kill the one thats a threat, right?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I mean, thats just sensible murdering...
---
RUDE
---
You might not like it, but this is what peak survivor performance looks like.
---
I think the one issue is how would you break it down into parts? Same problem I think they had with Bunny Feng, the head and body are different pieces but the sheet crosses them.
---
Seen from the other perspective it could mean there's teammates not working on objective running to unhook someone and you loose time through them just killing themselves.
---
He's a smaller channel, but a guy called Pain Reliever does something similar by making full-on commentaries over footage of whole games, explaining every thought that goes through his head.
---
Here we have the very, very common breed of Claudette‚Äôs disconnecting instantly after realising it‚Äôs a doctor. 
---
Nice of the killer to give hatch though :)
---
Wraith can end chases super fast with the Obsession by cloaking and uncloaking, he can gain stacks easily and therefore makes it harder to loop an easily loopable killer. PWYF is amazing on wraith! :D
---
The problem with giving long ban times for DC's is that if the killer starts taking the game hostage, like mori cancelling or letting survivors bleed out intentionally while standing near them, a DC with that timing would make the survivor be even more punished because the killer decided to be a jerk.
---
Yeah I realized that after, but I dont know if I would use it on him either way let along use Wraith to begin with. But Ill leave him to the experts lol
---
I love hearing about this ‚Äúsurvivor rulebook‚Äù every five seconds. It‚Äôs funny to me that killer mains think survivor mains have compiled a list of things that killers can‚Äôt do when all it really is, is just survivors calling out all the killer bullshit.
---
It works kinda like this
---
Base \* \[1+ (amount of BBQ stacks)\*0.25 + 1 (for pudding) + (other bonuses)\] so in your case
---
29,500 \* \[1+4\*0.25+1\] = 29,500 \* 3 = 88500
---
I'm quite sure one of the survivors had Bloody Party Streamers (or there's a double bloodpoints event, I don't know cuz I haven't played the game in the past 2 days)
---
It hurts.
---
I really hope this isn't the catalyst to people just throwing any killer ideas without restrictions.
---
that's not correct, or at least not properly worded
---
He plays killer 90% of the time though
---
u/Otzdarva is a god.
---
It was scratched mirror Myers with monitor and abuse
---
I don't know why, but when Ghostface was first revealed in the Dev Stream, I specifically remember hearing that he could hide in lockers. I even told all my friends that didn't watch the livestream that hiding in lockers was one of his abilities. I'm know kinda sad he can't actually do that.
---
Oh god
---
Nothing makes a man like beating dark souls 2 solely by spinning around like a fucking lunatic with a giant hammer. ToXiC survivors don't have shit on the suffering he's gone through.
---
When I was new to the game, I also thought Legion's ability was blending in as a survivor. The first time I went up against a Legion I remember yelling at my friends to spin around in circles so I could make sure it was actually them and not Legion lmao
---
I could see a deranged fairy being a killer
---
Where ? I play Freddy, so camping is not really an option, you‚Äôre salty, not my problem
---
Why would anyone want to play as Pig?
---
I'm ready to go against ebony mori's every game because people think they are good using mori's against new players
---
It says 'stacks' though
---
The current myers skin bothers me, because the mask does not look like the OG mask from the first movie. It would be much more creepier in my opinion, that mask haunts me.

This is real. The only way you can be sure there will be no no-ed is if you are in a SWF or you personally cleanse all 5, (enormous waste of time) people complain about SWF but then defend NOED with the argument they aren't doing totems even though you need SWF to do all the totems... Why can't BHVR just realize that without visual aid for certain things SWF is the only way to do them consistently? 
---
Drives me nuts.

How did that happen o.o

Just ignore them

Thats funny. But it only needs to be told once.

That's cool dude!
---
Suicidal.
---
Not much difference for Ruin as at least one survivor spawns right next to a generator most of the time and if the spawns are the same then it‚Äôll be gone just as fast. Also if it‚Äôs not lit and you‚Äôre running Thrill, does it work with it?
---
Massive brain survival technique
---
You get less benevolent for unsafe rescues
---
Above cthulhu? Nyralethotep for one and the rest of the elder gods, above them is the Outer Gods, this includes Azathoth
---
Why is having nearly 8000hr toxic? (Don't woosh me please)
---
Np
---
The situation for ruin is to simply make it not required like, make gens get done slower in general. Yes thrill would still work because it works with dull totems
---
It would get activated when a survivor touches a totem

I always though Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde would be a cool 'killer' or survivor.  Mr Hyde would be quite large.  Or a killer thats a sea creature and a map thats an aquarium and the killer can move through water, or pounce on people repairing a gene on a catwalk above the tanks.  It would only work on one map but  lmao at Jaws being a killer in dbd.
---
Imagine an angssty 12 year old from Xbox found Reddit and decided to use words they think are funny and edgy...
---
AGREED
---
Chest is about accurate I would say.
---
Gotta love those people. Well! It‚Äôs the internet so there‚Äôs no way we can constantly avoid those people. Thank you again for taking care of the community. It‚Äôs actually first day on Reddit, even though I made my account a year ago. There are definitely some amazing first impressions here haha.
---
Just had my very first match. Nurse.
---
This is a dope concept I just took a screenshot myself of a wallpaper for the three killers shown and have that as my background. Not that exact image however.
---
Close, but I don't think it's quite right.
---
In the OP, the bottom board has 2 nails on the left, and the paint seems more worn.
---
I mean you have a DBD streamer there, it's fine. Smol Billy would never go unappreciated!
---
In b4 salty killer mains downvote this lmao. I play surv and killer and this is hilarious.
---
Every riven main who plays dbd is destined to become a p3 claudette
---
That. That was terrifying.
---
It happens all the bloody time. 
---
Killer searching round, decide to leave gen to sneak off but BANG every damn time.
---
And then he gets hangover cause no stabs
---
Hold on! Keep the post up! I gotta season my french fries!
---
I'm more intrigued by the "leauge"
---
Maybe there could be female pyramid heads. You dont know.
---
It stacks to like 1.75 i think
---
On his Not Otzdarva YouTube chanel el he has a handful for survivor based videos.
---
*Sad Amanda noises*
---
His ability : No terror radius, moves slightly slower, and can insta down survivors when the blade is fully lifted off the ground
---
Fuck it you might as well reveal its aura to every survivor to neuter you while youre down
---
Maybe when you lose a chase, displays survivors FOOTPRINTS for 1/2/3 seconds.
---
If you were any good you'd have gotten both
---
It's been like that since ~April 2017.
---
Barbeque hasnt done much for me as trapper, i would switch that out with pop goes or fire up IMO
---
Everyone gets about 24,000 a game though because awful killers get 8,000 for Hunter. If your bad then you will definitely break 20 pallets and kick 10 gens so that‚Äôs 3000. If your let‚Äôs say clown then you would get 3000 from hitting survivors with bottles. If you got no hooks then 0. 
---
14000 would be the shell of a match start putting in hooks and hits and you would easy get another 8000.
---
Real entity reason for kidnapping people: He was alone :(
---
What the fridge sees when I wake up at 3 am for leftover pizza
---
Honestly I can thank not Otzdarva for his "trapper analysis" video he gave me idea to protect pallet with trap from one side and body block other side, it works like a charm :D
---
https://youtu.be/hrAB4RHZhQA
---
https://youtu.be/c-6d2lU0Dug
---
call it as I see it
---
i have a habit of cussing in every sentence which i think turns people off from my streams so to make it fun and enjoyable im doing this in a way to attract viewers and also have fun. Brings something fresh to a DBD stream haha especially when people are imaginative with their punishments XD
---
In community options you can change your flair. From there you can put what you want.
---
I don't think you can do it on mobile tho.
---
i think he respected that and just let me live for a bit longer while i was blind. i did die tho eventually XD
---
Yeah. Killer uses his shoes as weapons. Amazing plan.
---

There‚Äôs a Purple Haze joke in here I swear.

The Doctor in a black suit
---
*cries in bad placement*
---
If we're talking about all the killer cosmetics in general including prestige I'd say the demogorgon has the best prestige as it isn't too Gorey but still has some gore and the blood is inside the mouth too making it look better(I get the demogorgon isn't out yet but still it looks great), even if we aren't including prestiges the demogorgons escaped specimen looks great and the collar around the neck makes it look even better
---
I‚Äôm somewhat of a trapper main. I usually get 3-4K, but there‚Äôs almost always only 1 gen left. He may not lend himself to quick games, but some decent trap setups make him a good long haul option.
---
Even as a doc main this is little too toxic even for me
---
Rage - would love that trophy.
---
I Played Both Of Them. In lol in every 12-15 I got one or two matches I was tilting. In DBD in every 5 matches 1 tilt.
---
Jigsaw used the hidden blade in the first Saw film years before the first AC game came out
---
In all honesty you lose out quite a lot of time at start of match setting up..., and if you are not using +1 or +2 add-ons playing him gets quite harder..., but when it works out like this time it's hella satisfying :D
---
RIGHT?
---
Usually if a swf team brings toolboxes with brand new parts, prove thy self, stuff like that, to get the generators done extremely quickly
---
My favorite is trapping multiple people inside with Plague, blocking the door and just showering them until they're broken.
---
The most I've ever had stuck in that room was 2, but holy fuck was it hilarious.
---
I got it because I was playing against an afk killer and one guy had a key
---
:D
---
Holy crap I can imagine the relief you had once you figured that out..
---
this is an OC realization of the concept tho.
---
Maybe you only see it as lit if your actually have the "cursed" status effect
---
Better for any killer really, it lets you know what direction they‚Äôre heading! 
---
But yes, it works well for stealthy killers a lot as well!
---
I agree. But swfs are an exception. If there is a squad of 4 toxic neas with best toolboxes brand new parts, you literally have no chance of winning. I say it as a surv main.
---
Thanks! My bad MCote it is.
---
His Twitch is MC_Ote so I got confused.
---
How does one end up losing the skins, and how does one simply refuse to reset your account to before you lost and to give you 1,5 million bloodpoints for the trouble and for losing your bloodpoints. Or however much you lost at that point.
---
Same...
---
When you're used to staying in lockers the whole match so you forget how to use your legs. Good job, Dwight.
---
Whats happening next patch?
---
I‚Äôm glad Otz is picking up traction on this sub.  He‚Äôs a delight and deserves the views and support.  His content with other games is a ton of fun.
---
Wish she was this buffed in-game üòîüòî
---
You get saved if you serve as some sort of benefit to me. If you dont then i guess your dying
---
Like Bill then?
---
listen I made this meme at like 3am while my friends was screaming at me to make it faster
---
This post is so stupid i shouldn‚Äôt even have to explain it
---
Fair enough LOL
---
I mean they probably could do that, but it seems like there's not a good way without it looking dumb. Not that you can't make some war crimes of an outfit now. Honestly, I think it's be sort of funny for Myers to be wearing a sheet over everything except his head, like one of those priest vestments or something. Put it in.

feel free
---
I'll take and your downvote as a salty "yes" lmao.
---
sounds fine
---
The word toxic has lost it‚Äôs entire meaning in this sub. Using an ebony mori, or add ons aren‚Äôt toxic. They can be broken and completely unbalanced/OP but that doesn‚Äôt make them toxic. Toxicity is in the behavior of the individual. Even DC‚Äôing can‚Äôt be considered toxic unless it‚Äôs intentionally done with the intent to cause harm (purposefully hurt your team or waste offerings). The *only* thing that can be considered toxic in this post is the facecamping.
---
&gt;while some people just drop hard Rs on post game chat lol
---
You mean: YikERS
---
Yeah, that shit can get you banned on twitch 'n stuff.
---
Okay so just being a degenerate weeb means I‚Äôm in the clear, yay
---
No u
---
Deserved
---
Thid is why Killers are said to have such a low skillcap, compared to Survivors. Stuff like breaking pallets, wiping your weapon, running around a loop, picking up Survivors, carrying them to a hook, hooking them; these things all take a set amount of time. 
---
The best you can do to speed these things up is to run Agitation, Brutal Strength and Save the Best for Last. Even then, these barely save any time.
---
Survivors, meanwhile, can easily drop a gen's repair time from 80 seconds to as little as 20 seconds. This leads to certain red-rank matches simply being impossible for any Killers, besides Spirit and Nurse, to win.
---
And Freddy is incredibly disappointing and does not feel anything like you would expect him to feel if you saw the movies. This game just isn't a good template to work with powerful and versatile characters like Freddy and Pennywise. 
---
I know the majority of players would enjoy him to be added but personally I'd rather just wait for another asymmetrical horror game to give killers more freedom and proper versatility. And not subject omnipotent beings with multiple different powers to chasing a person around an object whilst the benny hill theme plays.
---
I‚Äôve mentioned it on this sub before but I‚Äôll float the idea again. Had a mate suggest to make it similar to the car or boat in Friday the 13th where you need to find parts to put them back together. Make parts for the generators spawn randomly in the map and they be required before gen progression can begin.
---
I run bbq also for my Freddy build. And I promise I'm not a toxic killer at all. If I go up against a swf that loops me hard or does crazy shit, I take the lesson I learned to my survivor matches. Just helps me improve my tactics. Ive opened exit gates for people and given plenty of hatches as a killer. Carried a guy, who had the exit glitch, around the entire map searching for the hatch because he made it out but game didnt register. Felt bad for the guy.
---
Yet even Otz, even though very rarely, gets pissed by extremely toxic survivors. I mean it's impossible to not get pissed sometimes. I love when he gets angry and completely destroys the next game he plays.
---
But still, the way he's handling toxicity of survivors is amazing. He's seriously the most positive person I know and he deserves the praise he's getting on this sub.
---
WOW JUST LIKE THE MOIVES
---
We *do* have the best party hats!
---
Hey I swear on my right testicle tyvm. It‚Äôs relatively balanced overall now I believe (I‚Äôll be honest haven‚Äôt played much, only a few games since ghostyboi came out) and minus hits through pallets and windows (but that‚Äôs hitboxes not balancing) it seems decently balanced no double pallets no teleport and like 1 or 2 actual infinites with certain perks, maybe still a little survivor sided on some maps and killer sided on others but that the way maps work. People will always complain tho.
---
r/cursedimages
---
Chase a different person or down them and leave you waste their time as well

lol. Whats that supposed to proove other than you are mad at.... anime for some reason? Idk man. You just seem super salty. Go to r/dankmemes   and go smile a bit.

You know, if I said that, literally everyone would be telling me to kill myself. I made a joke about face camping kates because they're heretics, literally everyone started bitching and moaning. Never joke or say you do anything negative on this subreddit or the whiney survivor mains will go for your throat.

tbh i knew it was a joke but still clicked...

I think it's fine exactly the way it is right now, the killers swings shouldn't be nerfed
---
Ok, you can still predict a spirits behavior? Like, ????
---
One thumb to be specific
---
I feel like im obligated to give you reddit gold but I cant.
---
Its literally always a guess if theres no line of sight
---
I'm curious and glad how he hasn't been corrupted by the toxicity tbh
---
Not for long
---
Fungoose can eat my butt
---
After playing Dark Souls for as long as he has, he has achieved nirvana, his psyche is simply on a level of calmness not comprehensible by man.
---
Not talking about otz, but about people offended by this
---
It's fun for like, 5 games
---
Jack the ripper please
---
No it's not it's just using flashlights to try make a save. Besides it sounds like a KYF as you can hear the killer and every person is laughing. Stop being so up tight.
---
Proxy camp is better, more chances that somebody else will come and maybe you will down them too or just hook them instead
---
You're still forgetting the speedboost though. I don't think it is negated even when you hit them in the smoke-cloud. But generally STBFL is a great perk on most M1 killers
---
Unexpected wholesomeness
---
Hag is already in the game
---
Kevin
---
This name terrifies me
---
Cuz he finally woke up and got up with the girl he liked from his childhood.
---
Oh yes, I played Ghostface against SWF in which everybody had Head On and most of them Q&amp;Q, not really doing gens. I ended up tbagging and farming with them cause this shit was too funny
---
my guess is that he's the one that had to be convinced the most, thus he needed to 'wake up' but hell if i know
---
Agreed.
---
I only watched some of the Halloween movies yesterday, there are so many great potential cosmetics for myers
---
idgaf because there going on that hook one way or another no mercy from me survivors are way to toxic.

‚ÄúEnjoy your ban :)‚Äù

It also explains why sometimes its a little wonky if youre super close to him when you try to break him out.

We're not good enough to have him

Isn't there like 336 hours in 2 weeks? 
---
How the hell he manage 359.1 hours.

"invented" is a dangerous word bud

No. Shrek.

thanks, I hate it

Welcome to the game. If you want to learn the ins and outs of each killer you should check out the [Wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Dead_by_Daylight_Wiki). For now what I recommend is focusing on the basic of how to counter most killers through proper looping. Looping refers to the proper way to run around the different 'tiles' on the map safely. Learning how to run each tile effectively should be your first priority.  
---
  
---
Proper looping essentially means to run a route around an object near a pallet for as long as you can without being hit, and they throw down the pallet, forcing the killer to break it. You want to hug the walls as you go around your loop, otherwise you will lose time, and the killer will catch up too quickly. Throwing a window into your route will make it much more effective, since it takes killers far longer than survivors to vault windows. What separates novices from adepts is understanding how to loop the map tiles. What separates the adepts from the masters in always having a plan for where to go next.  
---
One essential part of looping is route planning, and it encompasses the decisions of how and when to break away from one loop and try to move to another. You should be thinking about what you are going to do next once your nearest pallet is down. Experienced survivors always run with a plan. Generally you should break away from a loop when the killer is starting to break a thrown pallet. The idea is to try and string together pallets and windows until you can get to a strong loop somewhere on the map where you can waste a ton of the killers time. Understanding which tiles are strong and why takes time, but you can learn much faster by just watching some of the big DBD players on YouTube.
---
just put a piece of tape on the center of your monitor and use a marker to mark it

Otzdarva.  His YouTube channel is called "Not Otzdarva".
---
Thank you :D Not sure if it's on this clip but I've heard him working on gen upstairs and expected him hehe
---
I must acquire more cute dbd artwork
---
Niggr?
---
And people are defending that decision.
---
You know what sucks with that? It means Behavior will be emboldened to add more 15$+ skins in the future.
---
I had a freddy let me do the exit gate, he then NOED'd me and mori'd me
---
Personally id prefer the mask with a hole in it from the strip club if its gonna be from that movie
---
Fog maxes out at one purple, one yellow and one brown, or three browns.
---
It's been tested, feel free to test yourself. It doesn't stack past that.

I feel like Tru3 as a killer can actually read the tactic of survivors really well and adapt to that. However once he figured out how these survivors play in the beginning he won't change his tactic anymore, so if the survivors come up with something new midgame he won't adapt to this anymore and instead tends to find excuses why the survivors suddenly beat him and why his tactic doesn't work anymore.
---
I hungry now .... :/
---
Think of mist as a number between 1 and 4. It starts at 1 and can go down to max/min of 4/0. Purple vial gives +3, yellow +2, brown +1. The brown clear eye gives -1.
---
That's all there is too it. It still stacks.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
Sometimes yeah, but have been disappointed with the lack of moderation on his streams. For example, someone made a mistake about time zones (they didn't know what time it was for Otz), and people just got straight nasty. I really do like his approach to gaming though
---
Another great, totally non-toxic and unbelievably skilled streamer that doesn't get enough love is FunGoose. He never has a bad word to say about another person and is an educational streamer who explains all of his plays and explains the broader dynamics of how the game is playing out as he plays. He's also in my view hands down the best DbD player on twitch bar none, and that includes people like Truetalent and other streamers with huge communities. I have literally never seen a team of survivors open the exit gates against him when he plays killer at any rank, and when he plays survivor it's like the guy creates loops out of nowhere that aren't even meant to be in the game. Lovely guy and he's the best to watch if people want to improve, check him out.
---
Sad thing is there was a Left 4 Dead campaign planned, but after MGM went bankrupt plans were canceled. 
---
Starting out in the cabin, finding the hidden elevator, navigating the complex, would‚Äôve been awesome üò™.
---
No, it got removed because when it proposed we all literally told the mods that if it went through the sub would effectivley die on thursdays as there is literally no discussion that hasent been done to death a thousand times.
---
So it went through and guess what happened? The sub was literally empty the entire day.
---
100% recommend it.
---
This is very true but survivor are on the same level, once had a nea call me bad for not getting 1k on lerys with hillbilly, dude had hentai with nea on hook on his profile my god.
---
The problem is you actually need to have something worth to discuss. It's basically all be discussed at this point.
---
Cats with thumbs...
---
Yeah, season one she's like 10 isn't she? It's been at least a few years since then
---
I'd say 16 absolute minimum
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure Saw didn‚Äôt inspire the hidden blade for assassins creed anyway the devs probably already had it as a concrete concept considering the nature of assassins creed
---
Corrupt Intervention lookin‚Äô real good about now.
---
I'd be all for a Bride killer, have perks called "Til Death do Us Part", "Cold Feet" and "Here Comes the Bride". Not sure what they'd do lol
---
Im tired of fps lol i want something salty
---
Ur so braindamaged lmao
---
That would take the only power that survivors have over the killer, it would make loops harder, doing gens harder, abs you'd never be able to use exhaustion perks at the right time. 
---
It would be fun but for how long it would last it wouldn't be worth the work as the whole camera system would need changing to make it playable.
---
Upload to utube then post in reddit
---
I did exactly this, but by opening the door to trick or treaters in a Myers costume. Was really fun, gonna try something similar with Ghostface this year.
---
It's just my type of game. I came to DBD after F13 started going to shit, survival games where you can also be a killer are my thing, sure it's just a giant complicated game of hide n' seek/cat and mouse but there's so much variety to it that i never get bored. Bhvr is really good about taking care of DBD too, sure there are bugs and there will always be meta perks but there's constant additions to the game and maintenance. I'll play DBD until the day they shut the lights off, it can be frustrating sometimes but it's always a reliable fun game for when I wanna kick back and do something I took the time to learn how to be good at.
---
When kill your friends and you decide to put the same offering to post it on reddit.
---
With Halloween Kills and Halloween Ends coming in the future and Blumhouse‚Äôs interest in video games I think they‚Äôll bring in Old Myers and hopefully Old Laurie if they convince Jamie Lee Curtis. If they got her likeness for the 1978 Laurie and also got Ghost Michael, I‚Äôd be extremely happy!
---
wait he never said sorry for calling me a cunt about 50 times in his live stream LOL still love him
---
This film was so epic
---
Alternatively you could also share it to a burner Twitter account and save the video clip, then upload it that way. That's what I do.
---
They can't? Just because it's a 4-man SWF doesn't mean it's a Marth's de-pip squad with a single goal to "gen rush".
---
Dead by deadlight
---
And this is exactly why they made a virtual currency. They price things in a way which either forces you to buy more than you need or leave you with some silly left over amount.
---
It's really scummy but good thing cosmetics are optional :)
---
I just like it tbh, haven't gotten tired of the game yet so that's why I'm still here, also the dlcs keep me playing
---
How many hours have you put in
---
Feels bad man
---
"ALL" platforms? This must include the mobile eh?
---
Each time ppl loop me around fake pallets, drop it and then realise ‚Ä¶ oh, sheeeet.
---
At this point 300, I took a break for some time and I came back it's much better now.
---
I surely don't play the game as much as I used to, but i do play it daily.
---
I remember Otz back when he used to play dark souls and he was always a ray of sunshine lmao
---
Wholesome guy af
---
i think there is a chance increase of a skillcheck triggering when you leave a gen or when a killer hook someone.
---
But normally you have a fix % chance to trigger a skillcheck each charge consumed. (80 charges for a gen, 12 for a health state)
---
The audacity of that survivor! UNGRATEFUL!!
---
What would happen after one cleanse? Does it move? Also what if you have the other totems hex totems? And it doesn‚Äôt really, this just buffs two totems, and even then the game shouldn‚Äôt NEED you to use those to have a chance at a long game.
---
Yeah thats true, i just think it would be a cool addition, if you were able to switch in and out of first person and not have it fixed to just one, so if your struggling then you can always go back to third person.
---
Sexy Witches pls
---
Id honestly say in that situation it was a stream sniper more likely if he was using trapper lol, no one uses that perk otherwise from what I've seen lol
---
it what you
---
Ok thank you
---
Yall are so mean ksksksks
---
How about something like "when channelled reveals the survivors past position". so it shows where survivors were but with like a 15sec delay - you see a blurry version of them from where they were 15 seconds ago?
---
Honestly, Mat is so hot. Can this man get hotter like?
---
It's a game,do what you prefer I guess
---
Yeah I'll remember than when I get one hooked while we still at 4 gen cause my teammates would rather hide and play like they in outlast then have some balls and come get these altruism points.
---
I don't understand. Literally.
---

Can you send me a picture of your bloodweb? I'd like to take a look.

Lol, Gibs curses almost every second he plays and he doesn't get banned.
---
Sounds like the wraith
---
Doing gens you?
---
Well, it's for a licensed killer. Though, the whole "forcing you to buy more Auric Cells than you wanted to" thing is pretty.. Eh, nah, that's straight up BS.
---
A link with the praise would entice me to take a gander.
---
My bussy is ready for this.
---
Can someone explain where this is?
---
The larger the group the heavier penalty to action speed. High ranks don‚Äôt matter anyway. I‚Äôd like a UI update as well, even if post game only.

It's fun to flex it

You dont use enduring and spirit fury on this killer such a waste
---
I love playing with my husband, we play everynight and it's a lot of fun to learn how to play better with him. I'm rank 6 and he is rank 3! I'm really bad compared to him lol but he helps me with tips on juking better and using my perks to its fullest.
---
Considering he did DS2 NoHit with his mic on without sayong a word, he's seriously burned his nerves too many times to be bothered.
---
u/NightBlue3
---
But it's Not Otzdarva
---
Lmao damn bro I would've been sweating bullets anxiously waiting to see if I made it or not. Frustrating loss but a close call so slightly better
---
Nah, I mean dbd is a horror game and friday the 13th a typical "horror day"
---
About tracking - how about a power like this: activate a new stalkingability by rightclick for 10 sec. 20 sec recovery. Slows the killer down a bit. Makes the killer able to see blue scratchmarks when survivors walk normal and green scratchmarks for crouching survivors. That would be an idea for a tracking ability. 
---
But honestly i dont think the power would be that great at all. Abilitys that help you during a chase are way better. Also map pressure is important. Nurse and Spirits abilitys are very usefull during chases and they both got a lot of map pressure. And thats why they are so strong. Hag for an example sucks in chases. You are very slow and all you can do about loops is trying to put a trap down to mindgame the survivor. You dont actually chase with hag. But hag got the best map control. thats where she comes at her fullest. The wraith can track blood better then other killers but thats not his only ability. If you wanna make a tracking ability only for your killerconcept it might be to weak

We get a juicy rank reset
---
Because I need salt in my life.
---
play as boldly as possible. dont try to hide. then just loop the killer and see how it goes
---
Which I am 100% for. I wanna go back to the ranks where DBD is fun, not constant sweat. Sure we'll have to wait a day or two for the tryhards to fuck off back to purple ranks but, Worth it. I miss being a meme killer.
---
&lt;3
---
Sad noob3 noises
---
Tbf there are quite a few things here that are true and not just killers being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. I think it needs to be said that if something the killers have is effective it doesn‚Äôt mean its OP or Toxic. 
---
That and i think survivors should learn to differentiate tunnelling that benefits the killer and tunnelling just to be a dick. Like, if you get farmed and you are the only person injured i have no reason to not go for you. if you run a good distance away injured and the unhooker is right in front of me but i still go for you, then thats toxic and tunnelling to be a dick because im not saving any time by going for you etc.
---
Are you a mod
---
Now i'd want to see a steve version of legion...
---
Thats why i thought it could be an offering as well, since then it wouldn‚Äôt have unlimited uses. Definitely an ultra rare.
---
if they got all 5 gens done and none of them survived they deserve that achievement. key is really only unbalanced when it comes to 1 and 2 people being dead and during the EGC in 1v1
---
Well I do meme builds on Red xD
---
Careful, some people have VAC bans they didn't deserve. You don't know who earned their ban and who didn't, so you may be targeting the wrong people. I did a similar thing with people I recognised from previous games who dc'd, until I realised there are occasionally legitimate reasons to do so.
---
Chapter 14 will come without a map according to the roadmap, so it's safe to assume it's going to be a standalone licensed killer (like the ghost face)
---
Well somebody is clearly lagging so that would explain it.
---
I do too but those red rank survivors take shit too seriously, same with purple, I constantly get after-game messages asking how I'm rank 1 along with lots of trash talk, even if they escape.
---
Way too OP
---
DESERVEDT
---
Go back to the basement Skele, I didn't give you permission to step out. &lt;3

I rarely play killer. So I can only say... If you meet me and my friends on rank 1....you about to get memed

Throw that hatchet on me daddy

Sorry. :\^)

Had this once. It was Ash on marshes map and he was doing a gen. He fed me t2 and 2/3 of t3 (tombstone piece), then someone DCd.

No, "Voice comms in a game where a big factor is not knowing where things are" is op dipshit

im rank 15 killer and rank 10 survivor :D

Despite me being salty a lot of the time Cote puts it in words I couldn‚Äôt of on my own, there‚Äôs nothing really like dbd out there with iconic killers and current now as of Tuesday (upcoming). The adrenaline rush and mystery element as a newcomer Is something I haven‚Äôt experienced in a multiplayer rpg game besides DBD.  The new patch with the dedicated servers will deter me from being salty now that they can monitor dc‚Äôs closely which will be beneficial with the ST newbies.
---
Ultra rares are pretty common actually.
---
Yep, she is.
---
I sprint burst into a tree for the whole 3 seconds .. then get smacked
---
i blame frame drops .. and panic
---
That was showed in the original, when he gets up after being shot and leaves. And in the reboot, the fact he‚Äôs still alive is a pretty big indicator he survived being shot.
---
I'd like to see a blind killer that could like ecolocation to find survivors and if the survivor is completely still the killer won't see them but when activating the power the killer does some like more powerful noise that shows where any survivor is if they are standing still in a set radius along with showing where blood is for a couple of seconds
---
It's not cheating. Probably frowned upon, and I'd discourage it. Not using it helps build up game sense and you'll rely less on the positioning of the crosshair and more on instinct which is a lot quicker.
---
Ouch. Mah soul man. How could you. You have absolutely destroyed a man. my life, my house, my job, all came crashing down since sonic told me that. You are an evil man MrAnnoyingCookie

MY IDEALS ARE ON THE SCREEN, JOSH!

Yeah ive seen that, kinda funny
---
When they hook someone? Never heard about that before, interesting.
---
This is baby dwight levels of newb.
---
That guy is the most arrogant streamer I've ever seen in my entire life, even more than truetalent. Couldn't stay there for more than 20 minutes without feeling like a dick.
---
Yeah, I can never run from a killer for more than a few seconds before getting hit. And I have no idea how to git gut. But hey, at least I look good at sucking, with all those skins.

Tagging this video as DbD:HO to signify Dead by Daylight High Octane play style

It.... wasnt a comeback, I was joking. I thought you were kidding aswell.

The Cabin in the Woods
---
Oh I see thx for the response.
---
That must be awesome tho. Must make it an actual horror game üòØ
---
wtf
---
Only for a few seconds though, then we get a headache.
---
I was actually thinking for a long time what Title Jason could have in the game, and couldn't figure it out. Like Michael is the Shape, Freddy is The Nightmare, Bubba is Cannibal, all fitting and sounds awesome. So I wanted the same for Jason but couldn't figure one out, until I saw your post. "The Reanimated". I know that isn't what he's really called in the movies, but everyone just calls him Jason, so I think having that tittle really fits Jason from Part 6 and above. But yea if they add part 4 or under I still have no idea what to all him.
---
Teah, that is Hobo Myers.
---
THEY could give u more bloodpoints so at least the struggle is worth it.
---
Does dying inside not count? Because that happens pretty often to me lol
---
...... Don't know what happened, but I sort of also don't care.
---
You could use the perk small game until you memorize most totem spots.
---
A totem tracker is to specific. Survivors at best should get notified when the last totem has been taken.
---
"Your whole arm" lmfao
---
I was referring to this game, specifically.
---
Why is there so much more Shirtless Myers they don't remove then? This is the first I've seen of Bedsheet Myers and I been here for a year.
---
Mathieu is such a cutie.
---
Just record the video on your phone and upload to reddit that's what I do
---
u think i give a shit?
---
*Lemme stab, plz*
---
A tbag is taken as provocative.
---
I dont see nuthing
---
damn the dc one :(
---
I already said, sometimes people don't wanna play the character they're on at last second. Sometimes killers wanna be prepared to go against a group of survs who seem like they may be good. I've never dodged anyone for a reason other than bad ping, I still find the pre-game lobby beneficial
---
move over Ochido we have a new king of toxicity.
---
Did they specifically say age 18 or higher? If you're referring to the stream where they said they can't add kids from ST, that's cause they're kids. Anything that is a teen like 16-18 is passable I think.
---
If I pulled that off, would you die?
---
That's a massive RIP

Specifically, 30% of his upper body (not legs) in the center 26% of the screen.

Kenny and Lee would be better imo,also they are both dead and it makes more sense,just like Bill
---
I‚Äôm one of the red ranks survivors who ain‚Äôt given a shit, about how the game goes even if I get tunneled I say GG fam gotta keep the toxic out.
---
Definitely not. It would made this perk even more of a farm simulator. Now you need at least two perk slots to make shit safes and still get points. Build in BT would make playing solo survivor even more atrovious.
---
Mergind WGLF with We'll make it would be a lot better idea.
---
Watch out!! You‚Äôre not allowed to speak the truth about the game
---
It's the gif.
---
I mean, I've been watching tru3 for a while now.  
---
I wouldn't consider myself to be a fan.  
---
But he seems allright and really "confident".  
---
I wouldn't call him arrogant thought.
---
Not on Xbox One X, doesn't lag at all, ever.
---
I like saving others/stabbing others I guess
---
Trying to figure out what's wrong. Idk why it doesn't work
---
Prestiging. Also it takes 100 and something bloodwebs to get every perk

He is too good for this world
---
I'll guess spirit or myers
---
Shit man... I honestly feel kinda bad for those who lost their legacy skins to be honest. You see I never properly owned the game. My brother bought it for me on HIS account and then we used Family Share in the event that he wanted to play it sometime. It was only about a few weeks after the issue was fixed was when I bought the game and had access to my Legacy 1 and 2 Jake.   
---
Honestly? If there's one thing I'll fault BHVR for, its this. As much as I can see the issue of giving Legacy to characters that you didn't Prestige before November 24th (I think that was the date?) the achievement is more than enough proof to say "I lost my legacy, can you please give it back"  
---
I will defend BHVR till the day I die but issues like this are battles I can't defend them for. And it REALLY sucks.
---
It‚Äôs worded incorrectly. You have to pick them up out of the trap for it to count.
---
when you went to post you pressed the video option instead of text, right? ( i sometimes do it press text for everything ü§£)
---
Well.. Case closed, guys! There's no way around it. Turn down the publicity because we don't know what to call him.
---
Ohhh okay thank you for clearing that up for me! :)
---
As much as the pricing can be a tiny bit steep, I have to say, this skin in particular is pretty cool. Is this the one with the drill weapon?
---
So I did a little digging and the proper name of this is called a Rafflesia. The only reason I knew where to start was from Animal Crossing (Call me a nerd, that game can be really chill and enjoyable). u/cassioonaplasticbeach you mentioned it smells of Rotten flesh and as it turns out, the reason of this particular smell is to attract flies to pollinate it.
---
I need this format lmao
---
right now new content. 
---
i wish this chapter wasnt immediately after a rank reset but im still gonna play.

i also wish they would give more than one daily objective as well.

I allways thought that I was this zen-minded gamer that never gets triggered or frustrated with his games.
---
I've been playing Dark Souls, League of Legends, Dota, WoW, Starcraft and other games on a competitive level and everything was fine.
---
But holy shit playing DbD completely destroyed my mindset.  
---
There is nothing worse than playing killer on red ranks and facing a toxic SWF premade group.
---
The game design is against you.   
---
The balance is against you.  
---
And no matter if you win or lose, the survivors will insult you at the end of the game. Or even try to trigger you while playing.
---
Huge respect to people like Otz and Tru3 who stay relatively calm after playing this game for hours.

Holy shit that would terrify me, I'd drop my controller from that type of shit. I don't think Myers could even scare me that bad.

---
Nurse huntress looks like that one nurse that says it‚Äôs just a shit, it‚Äôs not gonna hurt, then sticks it halfway through your arm
---
Just buy the suit and blade don‚Äôt worry about the mask.
---
I sort of agree but that may well put him into the OP territory. I say up the vault and frenzy speed but keep the pallet breaking out, maybe make frenzy a bit tougher to control like Bubba or Billy. Make blood pools visible while using the power but keep the scratch marks out. Most importantly don't take away the power gauge when you hit a survivor normally.
---
None of them have Bedsheet myers in the title though unlike this one. Probably why it's the first one I've seen.
---
I have no life and no real other games i can play, its pretty routine to just play for me. Lately i have no fun tho like at all and only want to kill myself after every match so there's that
---
You mean Hag?
---
Waiting for direct deposit to hit this morning and then I'll be able to pop the weasel
---
He said that the art was shit (which it clearly isn't it's actually really awesome). And said you can't draw because of all the dicks you had in you mouth, hence him deleting his comment because he's a cunt.
---
Players running spine chill are crying at this image
---
The overall point of this thread is that the first commenter couldn‚Äôt post something about bed sheet Myers due to it being considered spam, but anything related to it was spammed literally almost a year ago. As I said, it‚Äôs been a while since people have been posting about it.
---
**Rank reset is magical.**
---
He's from oce but that's the only thing in your comment that relates to him...
---
You could actually run both. Despite WMI's description, healing does stack. 8 second heal to 6.3 second heal. If you can only pick one, I reccommend Botany as it applies to all healing actions and med-kit efficiency. 33% vs 100% (if both boosts are alone) is misleading if you interpret it wrong. Botany is a 25% duration in healing reduction (16 sec to 12 sec) while WMI is 50% duration reduction (16 sec to 8 sec) 
---
My favorite type of med-kit to run with Botany is the Emergency Med-Kit with Abdominal Dressings and Gel Dressings (in that order). I can heal myself in 10.12 seconds and I can heal other survivors with it in 8.27 seconds and it lasts 3.35 heals. So I basically have a WMI available if I really want to heal someone fast and I only get hit once maybe twice a game so I'm not afraid of healing others with it. Those few charges left can be used to wake myself up if I want to or perserve the kit from being destroyed by Franklin's Demise.
---
I'd only recommend We'll Make It if you don't want to use med-kits and you're playing with competent friends who won't run from you after you unhook.

1-thanks

2- I nearly have my sensitivity on max

3-then I need to upgrade ghost face more
---
4- I nearly have my headphones on max but I nearly go deaf when I kick a gen

Reading through the comments on this made me realize how little I knew about the people in this community

Like the names y‚Äôall are dropping,,,, ive never heard of them at all and from what y‚Äôall are saying BOY am I glad
---
Nah thats bbq and chili but all the time. It would allow for so many easy plays.
---
Time to cancel Otz for being toxic /s
---
Itll take tons of games to get decent with her since she is the toughest killer to learn especially on consol. Good luck!
---
Idk where this comes from, dude's DC'd on first down in my games. Maybe he's reformed lately but really don't understand the love.
---
Now I want a hunteress snowwoman skin where she loves snowballs
---
Ghost face is my favorite killer. Hes so much fun to play as plus has stealth abilities and a slightly overdone but neat power. I get constant messages calling me every name in the book for oneshotting full health survs.
---
Buff Legion plz
---
she chased you for over 2 minutes and nobody did a generator? were you playing kill your friends mode with a friendly huntress?
---
Ay same, I find it funny when the survivors is glaring right at me and the moment they expose me they get marked and tebagging commences

I don‚Äôt want any licensed content for a while

Original killer please

Thanks , I'll need all that luck

Bitch, there is nothing scarier than a fat, disgusting neckbeard and his cum covered pony plushies.

F
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just business, Lord Business.‚Äù
---
who is the one from the left, and where is it from?
---
His name is Kyle Gallner. He was Quentin in the Nightmare on Elm Street remake
---
Spirit uses track marks to follow, lightweight alters the perception of where someone actually is, plus with Iron Will tracking gets no easier after a hit. Also quick and quiet is often completely unexpected and is ultimately what allows a juke in the end.
---
I don't get how people can feed him so much sometimes. I've had people pretty much give me tier 3 at the start of the match. How do people not hear the music and not put two and two together is baffling.
---
Because Head On actually requires you to prepare or 'work' for the desired outcome.  
---
DS is just a "get out of jail" freecard.
---
And before saltly people @ me.   
---
No. It's not just an anti tunnel perk.
---
\*Little rant ahead\*
---
You can hook a person, chase and down another one, then find the first 'unhooked' person again and he'll strike you with DS.  
---
It bullshit.  
---
I had games where the exit games were allready opened, and I proceeded to down and hook all 4 people.  
---
Then I proceeded to downing all 4 of them again, in front of the opened gates.  
---
I couldn't slug them, they would just crawl out.  
---
So I picked them up.  
---
All 4 of them hit me with the DS, escaped, and shittalked me afterwards.  
---
Nice antil tunnel perk btw.  
---
Good-Guy-Head-On on the other hand requires the right preparation and execution. So whenever it pays off it feels GREAT because you actually had to kinda work for it.
---
Yeah now that I‚Äôve thought it through a bit more it would be a bit fucked lol. I still wouldnt be against it if there were more downsides. One thing i thought of was lowering movement speed while not in a chase for the killer or Making it a certain distance (such as 40m or something) that players dont have their auras revealed.
---
Once when I was playing killer I dropped last survivor at the hatch :)
---
...and closed it at last second &gt;:)
---
...then I carried him to the gate and let him open it :)
---
...and then I downed him the second he opened it &gt;:)
---
...and then I carried him to the end of the gate :D
---
The only cosmetic I‚Äôll ever spend real money on is Steve‚Äôs scoops ahoy outfit
---
Has anyone ran the numbers with the new changes? Btw aren't the perk webs 40+?
---
So, you modeled this killer after this sub?
---
Who is the main streamer?
---
I have hard time forgiving your light theme! \*raises fist\*
---
As much as I want Legion to actually be Legion, just make their Frenzy permanent unless the get stunned, miss, or end it themselves and they'd already be a lot better without being OP.
---
As anyone on earth, I get upset or angry sometimes, but racism, misoginy and or lgtbphobia is not part of being angry, it's only part of being a total PoS
---
Tru3 is very, very strongly self-opinionated but i wouldn't call him snob or arrogant. There are times where i raised where my eyebrows when his argument is hard to agree on and there are times when he makes a really strong point. He receives countless death threats in DMs and gets shit on for everything he says pretty much every day. Guess that's what makes him put on a 'shield' to not appear vulnerable. He doesn't deserve so much hate tbh but i get why many people would distant themselves from his contents.
---
He consistently streams and uploads and that's a great thing as a content creator.
---
Kate took the red pill.
---
Awful perk design. 
---
Randomness is rarely fun to play against. 
---
Hex perk that benefits killer after being destroyed? That's not how Hexes work.
---
Permanent bloodlust outside of chases? Really?
---
Im torn, you say Legion main. Flair says Ghost face... 
---
I'm onto you u/awsomeface112 , I'm onto you
---
The Lotta Damage: The Lotta Damage starts the match with 3 Flex Weapons. The Lotta Damage can take 5 seconds to craft a one use weapon from any killer (clown‚Äôs bottle,trapper‚Äôs trap, etc.)      After using this weapon, it breaks and the Lotta Damage gets his flex weapon returned. Thought?
---
*normal killer starter pack
---
Many people trashtalk and when he does it people are mad? ???
---
Ora is basically like Big Boss
---
Its happened to me too with no object
---
Thats a good suggestion.
---
That's absolutely not Amouranth
---
my ears :(
---
I was thinking this one earlier. Playing/getting chased by my favorite horror movie icons just feels great
---
Sauce?
---
PurpleBitch,  don't ask me why I know
---
Alright then, what perks would you use for this kind of killer?
---
I'm glad you two found enjoyment in the game. Thats really awesome!
---
... I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a lot of bronies on this sub...
---
"I'm in this picture and I don't like it"
---
Lol didnt knew
---
Wasnt this just posted?
---
I actually had not zero, not one BUT TWO CLAUDETTES who were NOT USELESS in 1 game today. I know, 
---
unbelievable, right! Of course they didn't do gens but they bodyblocked, took hits and unhooked!
---
I‚Äôm surprised people don‚Äôt talk about FunGoose more. He‚Äôs the most effective killer I‚Äôve seen stream and probably the best survivor frankly. I‚Äôve learned a ton from him and he does try to send positive vibes. Definitely worth a watch.
---
The criticism about him being arrogant is valid - he might not say he‚Äôs one of the best but you can tell he thinks it (rightly so IMO) and it comes through in the way he talks about his teammates or the killer from time to time. 
---
But in the scheme of things his stream is great and he points out his &amp; other players mistakes to show how to improve. He absolutely deserves more views, I just suggest watching vods to get into more gameplay because sometimes he has really long wait times.
---
He‚Äôs too sweet for this community
---
This. I agree. Me and my group make callouts and keep count for cleansed totems. The moment that I'm playing solo, or duo, counting them is near impossible unless I see a broken totem, and then I have to ask my partner if it's one he cleansed, and sometimes neither of us can get it together. Then there are some games where we just don't know how many are left, and we don't have the time to run around the entire map and check every possible totem spawn a second time for that one we may have missed. A totem counter, or something to alert us that they're all gone would really give me 0 reason to hate noed.
---
*Whats your favourite scary movie?*
---
I really wanna see Kevin
---
I don't get it whenever people just REALLY want a killer inside of DbD.  
---
I think that his perks + power are way more important.
---
If they release pennywise and he's the worst piece of trash tier killer that even loses to 2 survivors while having a boring power, I wouldn't want him.  
---
Meanwhile they might introduce some selfmade killer with a funny and unique power that might compete against red rank survivors like Spirit.  
---
If so, I would prefer the second one.
---
It's all about the power, perks and addons.  
---
Design is cool and all but ... well.  
---
I mean I really like Legions style, but he's the most boring killer for me duo to him not really being viable against good survivors.
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Hey leave the Neko girls out of it. Us weebs want nothing to do with this type of toxicity. We'd rather be toxic against other weebs.
---
Cries in console
---
I wish more people saw him the way you do.  He constantly flexes on his subs.  I dunno why people idolize fungoose.
---
Too pure for this community, yesterday some guy rage quit and sent me hate for not unhooking him before the ‚ÄòStruggle‚Äô phase
---
We don't deserve Otz
---
Generic Thot &lt; Chad Amanda
---
Damn boi Amanda looking hella fine
---
See like, I don't exactly care if you sabo, but I've had people complain about slugging after they sabo'd all the hooks in the area, what do they want me to do, let them wiggle off?
---
Tbh in every match i play there is atleast one survivor dc'ing and trying to add me on psn to call me trash because i played killer.
---
Genuinely so proud and happy that the first place guide teaches that stealth is not the be-all-and-end-all of evading the killer. And I'm even more proud it doesn't teach you to waste a slot on Urban Immerson. I approve.
---
Legend says that even saying his name hushes the room into silence while feeling an unchilling sense.
---
I love all the defensive comments in here because if you reverse the roles and remove some of the effort put into this image,  it'd have like 3k upvotes in an hour and a bunch of people circle jerking and patting each other on the back.
---
Custom icon pack. Same items, just different backgrounds
---
I usually try not to call things toxic but that is toxic as shit
---
Unfortunately. Like speedhacks, add-ons having iridescent effects when they appear common post match, lag switch, etc. I haven‚Äôt had a cheater in a few days, but I‚Äôve still had toxic players and campers/tunnelers every game who just ruin the experience.

WHOLESOME

---
I also feel like DS isn't always used for anti-tunnel, sometimes they purposely engage in chase to just spite you with a DS
---
Maybe he doesn't, now. But I have played with him as survivor and checked his profile. Dude disconnected in a game of mine last year. Regardless of whether he's changed he's not very entertaining to watch IMO.
---
You've spent the last several hours of your life being as edgy as possible on the internet for attention, including on a Naruto subreddit. I wouldn't be talking about pussy any time soon kiddo.
---
Small game is great for farming too. Dulls are 1000BP, Hexes are 1500BP
---
Can you please be m o r e Nice? What made you post this?
---
Eh. Depends on the killer. Hag with certain add ons, nurse, spirit, any fast transportation killer, and this totem may stay up all game.
---
They're talking about a wiki article that shows the Entity being referred to as "she", but it was just a misunderstanding of its original name which was in French, a language without neuter pronouns. In Spanish it's referred to with male pronouns, but in English it's an it.
---
Yeah
---
Here we see a toxic redditor in its natural habitat.
---
Completely ignoring situations where you know the others have borrowed and the exit is open, when did this guy standing at an exit gate ignore the other 3 survivors? He had noed. My bet is if he saw an opportunity to kill all of them, he would try. If not, he's a bad killer.
---
I would assume AngryPug is up there.
---
I said it before.  
---
This subreddit is more survivor sided / biased.  
---
Maybe it's because more people play survivor, I don't know.  
---
But you can sit here and say stuff like: "DS needs a buff" or "Old MoM wasn't broken" and people will like and agree with your post.  
---
Meanwhile you say something about: "Camping and Tunneling are legit strategies that have counterplay involved", "Noed can be countered aswell", "SWF break the balance of the game" or something simple as "I think hex spawns are still broken and need a fix" and people will completely lose their shit.
---
00f
---
My favorite thing to do is turn around and see the killer swing their weapon and watch it be easily over a meter behind me but still getting hit :')
---
Nah just Jane Romero exclusively.
---
Very helpful stuff! Just a few things to add. Learn what loops are strong and what loops are weak. Some loops are what is considered "unsafe" meaning of you drop the pallet and then try to play around it, you will always be hot by a skilled killer (thus its "unsafe") these pallets should only be used to stun the killer and gain time to run to the next loop.
---
Then there are what is know as strong, safe, or sometimes even referred to as infinite loops. These are pallets that, once dropped, the killer is forced to break in order to have a chance of catching you. If he tries to mind game and play around the dropped pallet, he will never catch you unless you make a big mistake. These are usually identified with having at least 1 quite long side around the loop.
---
Jungle gyms, are actually a bit more specific than you said. A jungle gym is any location with two L shaped window vaults in fairly close proximity. This again is very strong as a survivor and, if played correctly, the killer can be looped until you have vaulted one window 3 times, which can be quite a long time.
---
Last piece of advice is learn to shack loop. The shack is THE strongest loop on most maps. Some maps have some crazy BL infinites but the shack is on every map and is quite strong. Use it well. And dont break God pallet unless you desperately need to. In addison to shack, most structures and buildings in the game are quite strong for you to loop around/through once you learn the layout.
---
The Slasher is what most people go with.
---
That's No0b3 I think
---
And why do they do all of that? To not let the survivors get out, so they have time... to... kill them...
---
Sure. Welcome to dbd. The game where you don't know if you're going to have fun each game.
---
No offence, but this is a bit of an unbalanced mess. Some of it is redundant as other existing perks already do the job better. Other parts of it just seem like it wouldn‚Äôt be very fun or engaging to deal with.
---
When gen speed allows for three gens to get done in under two minutes, survivors at red ranks will have no mercy. It doesn‚Äôt take skill to do a gen, why should I car if I use a tactic that counters that but it also ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt require skill‚Äù
---
Guys, remember when Otzdarva used to play DS? Those were the good times, but I am happy that he is bringing some positivity in the community because it is needed.
---
Most of the licensed characters you have to buy, but getting all the original characters manually is fine. You miss out on some cosmetics but that generally isn't a big deal, especially since you can buy / earn cosmetics in the store now.
---
Omg! I thought about the same thing XD
---
The lord has lied, my teammates are clearly bots.
---
This also applies if they are the first down.
---
I think this shows how survivor sided this sub is. If I made a post even slightly hinting that the survior should stop whining, 0 upvotes 54 comments. A survivor makes an explicit post saying that a killer needs to grow up, 600 up votes, anyone even trying to argue for the other side is downvoted without a thought. And it's not even just survivor sided. It's the type of survivors saying ruin is too op, or that killers and survivors suck during the ptb. I'm not saying you arw anything I described above. Im just saying to those silent masses that scroll down and instantly downvote downvote comments, I know how you work.
---
I wouldn't call it OP but it just kills enjoyment when nobody bothers to do shit when I'm around and barely even bothers rescuing their friends. Like yeah the game's over fast but it wasn't exactly thrilling.
---
you did it first but you stole it from my mind :( xd
---
I don‚Äôt know what this is about, but I wanna know, and I wanna see if it has more meme potential. Thank you marvellous individual!
---
At least he'd have something in common with another survivor then
---
another Quentin face quality meme, yes, everyone's done it. To Death
---
WHERE IS PLAG
---
I hooked my wife
---
I mean they didn't let Bill rest easy either. I still hate killing him though.
---
Makes the killer main hard bleed
---
All this entire post has shown me and it's replies and initial post is that people care way too much about streamers and I just don't get it.
---
even cooler idea, pink add on that makes an extra "dream" gate or maybe even 2 so they would spend all their time opening a fake gate lmao
---
"–ü–∏–∑–¥–µ—Ü" mean "cunt" for anyone who doesn't speak Russian. I cannot tell you how much I've seen that word pop up in post game chat.
---
my man that shit on macmillan state is so goddamn dark
---
My money on sexy witches
---
I just don‚Äôt let the teabags or obvious trolling by SWF get to me when I play my killer in low ranks. I‚Äôve noticed that the higher I get, the SWF groups just play the game more than troll (at least with my experience on PS4). I usually play survivor more, but have my fun with killer. With the rank reset today, I‚Äôll probably hit rank 15 with killer from 12 and probably rank 8 from 5 on my survivor. I know I‚Äôll be ready, but god bless all the new players coming in from their Netflix subscriptions and who choose killer. It will definitely be baptism by fire once they hit rank 15 as I believe that is how low the derankers can get (unless a rank reset can put you even further below).
---
yeah you can see the shitpost/meme on the top, almost fell for it tho
---
No i usually capture and facecamp
---
Ah, someone made the stupid argument again.  
---
And of course fellow survivor mains agree with it.  
---
"nOeD iS oP bEcAuSe It ReWaRds ThE kIlLeR fOr LoSiNg!"
---
\-Every survivor that doesn't know how perks actually work.
---
So let me explain to you why this is a stupid statement to make.  
---
And yes, even though I'll be taking my time for this I allready know that all the green ranked survivors (atleast the salty ones) will downvote me for speaking the truth.
---
NOED doesn't "reward" the killer for losing. Not directly.  
---
It's just a lategame oriented perk.
---
If we go by that logic half of the killer perks would reward the killer for losing.
---
Blood Warden only comes into play whenever a gate is opened. (Technically the killer is losing here).
---
Bitter Murmur only comes into play whenever a gen is finished. (Technically the killer is losing here).
---
Make your choice only comes into play whenever a survivor is getting saved. (Same).
---
Fire Up only stacks up / gets good whenever a Gen has been finished and the game is close to being done. (Same, the killer almost lost here whenever the perk gets from useless to below average).
---
Lots of perks are designed like this. Not only on the killers side. On the survivor side aswell.
---
You've got perks which allow you to snowball. Once you're winning, they'll make it easier to win.  
---
And you've got like 'safety' perks to fall back on. Once you're losing, they'll allow you to make a comeback.
---
They don't "reward" you for losing. It's not like you win the game once Noed comes into play, even though lots of survivors will tell you stories like:  
---
"So this killer has been afk for 10 minutes, then the last gen procced, NOED activated and he 4K'd us all. Somehow he even double pipped through that. And then a hot girl came and sucked him off. All this because of NOED. FUCKING BROKEN!"
---
But that's not the reality.
---
It's a perk WHICH CAN EASYILY BE COUNTERED (even though lots of survivors disagree here, too).
---
It's just completly unfun to go against. That one game where you've played perfectly, then you get chased, the last gen procced, you instantly get NOED'ed and die on your first hook.  
---
Sure. That's unpleasent. But that doesn't make the perk op or "rewarding for losing".  
---
Tbh I often have the same situations against a Myers where he would just EW lll pop of and destroy me with a single hit.  
---
Now back to the second point.  
---
Killers complaining about (old) MoM.   
---
Old MoM had no counterplay. It would just block most hits after getting hit 3 times.  
---
There was this single "if" involved.   
---
It's not unlikely to get hit 3 times and still live after that.  
---
The perk was broken. The perk was OP.  
---
NOED isn't.  
---
That's why most killers get frustrated whenever they point at something WHICH IS OP and NEEDS FIXING ASAP and then a survivor pops up saying: "Uuuhhh ... well ... you got ruin, don't you? You shouldn't complain at all."
---
That's rough! Any messages from the randoms blaming you because they didn't wait for you?
---
b-b-b but nurse is op!!!1
---
What‚Äôs the point in guarding a chest in the basement? If my friends and I were playing with you guarding the chest we would ignore you and do gens. Is there something in the basement chest that is a game changer?
---
Sounds perfect!
---
Yeah, just play as a trapper and politely ask a Dwight ti assist you.
---
Tired of your Survivors escaping the hook? Seal them to the hook with Flex Seal; the quick dry rubber-based sealant that's **guaranteed** to keep pesky Survivors on the hook where they belong!
---
That's what I usually do, but sometimes I think the timer's done and it isn't and it throws me offguard
---
nah, noob3 had legacy skins but bhvr fucked up so he lost them as he cheated for them, got banned for it yada yada yada
---
and i don't exactly remember noob3 throwing his cat around on stream but idk i may be wrong
---
Who could have guessed that acting like a nice, chill person would make you so popular. Utterly shocking.
---
Its a way to derank while having some fun doing it i guess.
---
So people should be punished for playing with teammates we actually know? I'm typically a solo player and I think we should have more communication options/emotes or hell even proximity voice chat.
---
Don't think I don't see you and your Rinmaru Haunted Portrait Maker... ^(Don't ask how I know that.)
---
It's a really cool  idea I really hope the next killer has some sort of fire based power
---
This is a buff to killers as well. More survivors getting totems is less of them getting generators.
---
I don't think I have seen this moment at all...he usually just says something like "well played" or "that's unfortunate" or along those lines. Damn now I'm curious to see this play and see what brought it out of him. Very out of character for him but very good on him for being aware enough to address it
---
FunGoose is the guy who Make his content out of Killing yellow / green rank survivors.  Him having thousands of hours.  Also he‚Äôs arrogant and I‚Äôve been told that off stream he plays like a truly Toxic Mf. 
---
Come on you can see the fake out of it.
---
Reminds me of the  "ginger" joke tbh
---
It holds the power of anime girls and bunch of hentai.
---
Thanks. Cool backgrounds btw.
---
I love how evil your idea is, but the doors spawn from the start, so only noobs would fall for it.
---
Building in my previous idea, maybe there could be a hard skill check happening while opening the door and if you fail it, Freddy can teleport to the door in like 1-2s
---
&gt;living plushy of a man
---
WHY DOES THIS SOUND SO CUTE I WANNA HUG SOME PLUSHY NOOW QwQ
---
No, it is not.  
---
And please stop with the: "This is actually a buff to killers aswell."  
---
I don't know whats wrong with people here.  
---
When they added more pallets to the new freddy map people made the point that:  
---
"Adding more pallets is acutally a buff to killers because now they probably can mindgame more pallets."  
---
It's the same with giving survivors more info.  
---
It's never a buff to the killers when the survivors receive additional help in form of awarness.  
---
If I know that the last totem has been done, I won't be searching for additional totems. ---&gt; I won't waste more time ---&gt; Buff to survivors.
---
It would be even cooler if he uses the deadlights in his Mori.
---
You speak the truth sir, take my upvote. Any good survivor should learn totem placements before going and saying no Ed is op. Literally any good swf would cleanse totems, I played with a group of swf at rank 8 and we were grinding to red ranks and I was so surprised that they said ‚ÄúHey did you guys get any totems?‚Äù I was astonished. We all got to escape and the killer did have no Ed but we cleansed
---
If I'm not wrong, that's about his DS2 no hit run.
---
You didn't reply to a meme, I meant it.
---
[deleted]
---
Oh god not this twofaced idiot again
---
I've been watching true for about 2/3 years, he's definitely arrogant and thinks very very highly of himself, as annoying as it can be I still watch him because he is good at the game.
---
Post got deleted. See? No it would be still be making fun of Bronies, the killer is literally named "the degenerate" and it summons my little pony plushies. Thats just being mean dude
---
When did they give trapper prayer beads?
---
The dude reaches rank 1 on multiple accounts every month and as I said I've never seen a team open the gates against him regardless of rank. He plays on smurfs later in the month to get killer games because rank 1 queues in OCE are extremely long and he needs content for his streams, which is a shame because he destroys those teams in less time than it takes him to queue, but it's a reality of streaming from OCE. He also plays heaps of survivor these days because of killer queue times.
---
Think Black Swan but with a drummer instead of a dancer
---
Downvoted by 15 salty survivor mains
---
Yeah that can be frustrating
---
Excellent
---
Oh wow I didn‚Äôt read that
---
He means it wouldnt work with the engine they're using.
---
Last I heard, the actor and BHVR were talking
---
This whole video is exactly me at Ruin skill checks. Just replace the tempo checks with a survivor helping me stopping and walking in circles after every time I fail the Ruin great check. The chair scene would then be that survivor intentionally failing to alert the killer to me after I don‚Äôt hit a great Ruin check 10 times in a row.
---
Second. Get that deputy doofus mask.
---
Where did you get the scoops outfit from?
---
It's easier to do some things on PC than it is on console. Like I said, on Xbox pretty much anyone can communicate by being in a party with each other, so none communicating survivors are harder to find. Some people say that nurse is harder to play on console because of... I think blink effectiveness? I'm not sure, I don't play her very much so I wouldn't know. I mess around with her sometimes for rituals, that's it. Someone told me it's harder to 360 as well, and to land hatchets, but I can't confirm either of those. I'm sure there are benefits to both PC, and Console, but the biggest part is easy access to communication.
---
I'll miss my goblin boy :(
---
Meanwhile, I've had people take the time to post comments on my Steam shared screenshots just to tell me how "trash gg ez bby clown" killer I am because I was trying to complete some daily ritual with a level 2 killer at rank 16.
---
So let me start off I'm not condoning lag switching it's awful but you can't be there talking about " these kind of people Ruin  this Game" when you were talking about you and your  team was bullying the guy... Those kinds of people Ruin the  game too.... If you want better karma when it comes to killers maybe not be an asshat and you'll get nicer killers
---
I was too busy screaming lmao
---
Does a killer based off some random innsmouth dude not sound good? People recommend fishing themed killers on here all the time.
---
Yo that‚Äôs straight up derogatory it‚Äôs almost like racism. I was going through the comments on this and was fine till I saw this. What kind of asshole do you have to be to say something like that? And before you say it because it‚Äôs obviously your only comeback no I‚Äôm not a salty killer main, when I play killer and get gen rushes I‚Äôll message them all gg with no hint of salt. And no I don‚Äôt want a trophy because that was your next comeback wasn‚Äôt it
---
That isn‚Äôt hentai
---
Probably, but a dbd version
---
The point your missing is that this isn't buffing Vets/SWF players because they already have totem management handled. It's a minor buff that comes from being a QOL change for solo survivors which at the bare minimum does nothing negative for killers. 
---
A change like this is exactly in line with what BHVR has been doing to buff SWF and bring killers up.
---
I've posted this like 10 times and everytime it will end up with me getting downvoted into oblivion.  
---
But I don't care about reddit karma.  
---
This is just the truth for me.
---
(What I said about NOED I mean)
---
I am a killer main, but atleast 50% of the time I am playing with ONE SINGLE buddy of mine. (+2 randoms of course).  
---
I am in red ranks, he's like green'ish.  
---
With just being able to coordinate his (and of course mine) doing - Noed never was an issue to us.  
---
It's basically a: "Oh, we're facing Wraith. He probably has NOED."  
---
We don't even cleanse totems.   
---
If you are certain that you are facing NOED, it's never really an issue.
---
Of course, I don't disagree
---
If this was based on a token system, maybe based on killer stuns, then it would be very good without being OP. I'd say stackable up to 3 tokens would be plenty powerful and allow for counter play. Obviously it would take a few seconds to set the pallet back up so you couldn't abuse it in a chase. Maybe make it like the new totem where you "activate" the perk by stunning the killer and putting the pallet up takes less time depending on tier.
---
Forcing the killer to break pallets that a survior abandons is easily as good or better than DS is 
---
Think about how much time it wastes if the killer has to break every good pallet instead of getting the second hit in a chase, or being able to punish killers for *not* respecting pallets. This opens up a ton of mindgames from the survivor.
---
I think the token system earned by pallet stuns would be the best way to make it work
---
I was bullied because I killed them totally fairly btw and was called a baby killer who couldn‚Äôt catch them. Smh man can‚Äôt people just play and have fun
---
Maybe he wants to keep the key?
---
Oh no, they attempted to escape. I don‚Äôt care about them anymore now
---
receipt or it didn't happened
---
hahaha funny moments :D
---
dOinG geNs, yOu?
---
Watched season three of Stranger Things yesterday and knowing the scene where this comes from makes it much more funny
---
Oh I didn't know you meant literally throwing a cat lol. I know No0b3 has a cat he's been showing recently and assumed that was what you meant. No idea if FunGoose even has a cat.
---
Why would they try to escape when im right next to them, its unnecesary and if you fail you will die on the next hook eitherway
---
The "add to the salt with a comment below" is SO accurate. I actually cringe a little every time I see a variation of that on someone's profile now because it's so overdone and it usually means they have an extremely toxic playstyle, be it killer or survivor.
---
Yes
---
i'm not the guy who said that but yeah noob3 has a cat
---
The problem with that is he's not a very good killer. Of course, playing so much will literally get just about anyone down to rank one. This is a game where hours can outweigh skill. But he misses a lot as a killer, and then thinks it's the games problem, where, in truth, he simply just isn't great at playing the role. But in the end, I like the dude.
---
Looks like a collision mesh. Maybe debut mode turned on somehow?

What is the point of your post? You‚Äôre pretty much asking for validation for being a piece of shit

/u/gematria666 /u/dixychicken797

Yeah some totems are nice but with my bad luck mine always spawns in the basement of that one house or in the preschool basement.... right in the open for everyone to see.
---
Breaks my heart especially since I get high hopes when I'm playing on that map that I'll have a decent spawn.
---
Ah. I knew it. ^Sauce?
---
grow a pair is the main thing i wanted him to do
---
there is no hatch stand offs anymore. whoever finds it first wins and the killer has the advantage in finding it first so its really sad to be scared of it opening these days

So true

Dang your salty. It‚Äôs 60 seconds at most. If you can‚Äôt stay away from a person after unhooked for 60 seconds that‚Äôs on you. Stop whining

This is me, playing GF with one perk because I bought him yesterday
---
Oh, I did 4 gens mostly with the Jane and the third guy was looping the Spirit like a boss.
---
He did nothing wrong. Lol if anything blame the claudette for not recovering. It's a viable tactic to slug the last person to not have the hatch spawn at least until they know where it is. He's just what supposed to let the last person every time go to spare their feelings? It's supposed to be challenging to escape. Now having said that claudette was a dumbass for recovering and that definitely could've helped the both of you a lot if she did.
---
What do you mean? Phil is the entity. That's the secret to making flex products. They can't escape the entity because the dimension is being held together with flex glue. Don't believe me? There are 2 killers with chainsaws, and they inflict the maximum damage with one downs. Several killers use large knives. These are weapons he's used to dismember buckets. The fog is only liquid flex seal in a vape. Those hooks are being held together with flex tape, and the entity's claws are just sticks that have been dipped in flex glue. Hey, who the fuck are you!? Get the fuck out of my house! Get off of me!!! 
---
I take back everything I just said. That is nothing but a conspiracy. Please buy Flex seal, Flex tape, and other products of the Flex family line of products.

Hey nobody uses the cmon anyone and if you play on xbox I shall protect you from the spoopy clowns as momma steve

&gt; ignore the other 3 survivors? All this post is, is a heavily biased description of a few seconds in one match.
---
That's literally what tunneling is though.
---
Ignoring 3 survs until the one you want is dead.
---
Last year wow, really speaks on the person he is doesn‚Äôt it? lol
---
i want this
---
No, that guy is just stupid. Never attempt if it will put you into 2nd state when someone is saving you
---
Kevin, hahaha. I call my brother Kev rn.
---
Increase the amount of time it takes for multiple people to repair a single gen.
---
2 people - Increased from 44.44s to 60s
---
3 people - Increased from 33.33s to 45s
---
4 people - Increased from 28.57s to 30s (barely needs an increase since this never happens.)
---
I'm a Spirit main, actually. \*spooky ghost noises\* But I've never made it past rank 15, sadly. You're right about it helping with surviving, though, because you know what they can and can't see.
---
i have done this as trapper once and the survivor escaped. the worst thing is that you can only blame yourself
---
Slugging is a viable strategy, your Claudette was dumb for not recovering, he doesn‚Äôt have to hook the second person just so you can get hatch.
---
Well... They can reverse the texture, use photoshop to make more old but if they did that idk how they forgot to remove the watermark.
---
Bonus points for you
---
BM?
---
Think outside your personal bias for him. I‚Äôm 100% sure if you had to wait 30+ minutes even 1 hour queues to start a game you‚Äôd make smurf accounts. He reaches red rank every month and destroys whether red rank or not, he wins 9/10 playing Plague who isn‚Äôt even top 5 killers in this game
---
but you use offering according what you do best, if you're good at looping use boldness offerings, if you play killer and get 4000 on average per category its pretty bad. BP on survivor is pretty bad, but on killer you gain a lot with BBQ and BP offerings
---
the last part was a joke
---
Correct,   I‚Äôd much rather have a no gen doing bodyblocking altruistic Claudette than a Blendadette trying to meme.
---
Haven't tried this method in a very very long time but you need comms for it.
---
So if youre trying to solo queue into your friends killer lobby then the killer will count down from 5. They will press the start matching on 4 and the survivor will start at  "0". This will give the parameters to potentially get in their lobby. The only thing is you need to be the same rank or just about. 
---
If youre SWF then the SWF will count down since they actually have a timer when they select start matching. Same rules though, killer at 4 and survivors will automatically go in at 0.
---
The numbers may need to be played around with a little. If after a couple tries you can't get in then try doing it at 3 and so on to try and find the sweet spot.
---
(Side note: please dont use this to grief other people's games and farm with your friends. Dont be an asshole. I used to do it just cause my friend hated playing survivor but still wanted to play together. Best of luck to you)
---
No no he's got a point
---
In my opinion killers need a buff / game needs to be redesigned in a way so games aren't over within 4-5 minutes.  
---
And survivors need to be more fun to play.
---
It doesnt mean cunt, but derives from it. It means ''holy fuck, ''fucking/bloody hell'' usually in an annoyed manner. Like - pizdec, everything went down the shitter.
---
Can sometimes be used when one is amazed by something - like daaaaaamn.
---
You are welcome.I must go now, vodka wont drink itself.
---
Thanks lol, but I play on PC. I play with friends (I know, toxic üôÑ) &amp; they do a good job running the killer for me when it's clown.
---
Sometimes though, you get that God-tier clown that just won't back down. Especially if they know you're streaming. Most killers are understanding, in post game chat, when I explain*why* I DCd. Thank God.
---
ppl with flashlights are pretty stupid most of the time, they only blind at pallets since they cant save downed survivor
---
I define it by its definition, he's very low-key egotistical, just very full of himself. I still watch him, but he definitely acts this way sometimes.
---
He does DC but only against known stream snipers. He dodges lobbies against people who he knows are unpleasant teammates in post game chat and lobbies with 150+ ping. So there‚Äôs something the other guy isn‚Äôt telling
---
Yes, all she had to do was get on the gen and run away if he dropped down
---
They're compensation was more than generous. First place got $100 in auric cells. Not to mention if the guide is made official and and they are recognized for their work that is worth a lot too. I have to imagine the people who made the guides are graphic designers or have an interest in it and having your name on that document alongside the auric cells compensation is very fair in my opinion
---
What?
---
If the people who made them wanted "appropriate compensation"... they wouldn't have done it at all..? Is it such a shock to you that people enjoy making content for others?
---
Also, one of them is posted to their YouTube channel (free advertisement), and another is posted on their own website (free advertisement). They still get a bit more than just auric cells at the end of the day.
---
What are the rules, anyway?  Where can I find them?
---
Thats a good language to switch gears to !)
---
This shit happend to me on the same map yesterday. Crazy bug.
---
Aaaah it's the killer! ... Oh no its just Quentin
---
Its directly here on the subreddit. You can see it.
---
That I agree with. Better to try and kobe then to go into phase 2 without trying.
---
Once had three megs do a very shitty job of looping the killer the whole game, leaving me to do every single gen.  Got sent hate mail when I left their asses on the hook and left when I saw the killer had NOED.
---
i know bro thats why i said " I know you‚Äôre not saying saw influenced the hidden blade, \*you are just clarifying the situation\*..."
---
Pallet blinds are too easy to hit.
---
I'm not even doing it to derank because I cant, rank 16
---
You husband now.
---
People take the risky plays because they have ds
---
Wouldn't the contrary be more accurate?
---
Ya
---
I thought that was Darryll from The Walking Dead.
---
^
---
I was so hyped when legion was released, I never enjoyed playing a killer as much as them! I hate when people say that they can‚Äôt survive against him, I‚Äôve been in many games with smart survivors who were able to survive. Now I cannot even look at him at all :&lt; I tried to force myself with his nerfed skills but the game was too long that I seriously thought I should uninstall it ;-; plz bring our boys back
---
Maybe it gets deleted because the backstory is a bit silly? Then again, Clown exists with his finger lick so I guess it‚Äôs something else.
---
I know. But I see how my wording didn't make that clear.
---
i mean it's not a bad idea
---
I mean, Legion isn't exceptional right now, but at least they have a unique power. Meanwhile Bubba is budget Billy and Clown is a worse Freddy :(
---
More like no shot. The Ghostface mask and the Scream franchise are different licensed properties
---
It's refreshing to finally meet a right testicle guy for a change.
---
But in all seriousness, we've made serious progress in terms of weeding out blatant advantages for either side. 
---
There are like 6 strong killers now if the player is experienced. Nurse, Spirit, Billy are the obvious ones, but Hag and Freddy complete the top 5 with Plague as the 6th best killer a ways behind them. This obviously beats the previous numbers of just 2 strong killers, Nurse and Billy. 
---
Ruin isn't a must because Pop Goes The Weasel is a pretty awesome substitute. And even if you want to use Ruin, Thrill Of The Hunt and Haunted Grounds are great Ruin defense with less spawning in LOS of totems in every game. 
---
And all 2 of the op killer mechanics camping and tunneling are easily countered by DS and Borrowed Time. So that was pretty easy. 
---
Far from perfect, but the game is finally as close to even as its ever been.
---
My friends did this to a guy and he messaged and blocked us lol
---
Hey, what ever happened to that cosmetic contest? Is it still going on?
---
otzcheats.com
---
The backstory was really forced, as was a lot of stuff about this killer.  I‚Äôm just trying to come up with a non-overpowered yet non-underpowered summoner-style killer. 
---
And I like ponies.
---
Ah. Thanks for explaining.
---
His power could the right of kindling, which would give him necromatic abilities, but it can be stolen. His chase  music could even be his boss music. Bwam bwam bown bown (whisperwhisperwhisper)
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm gonna slug if you know where the hatch is, I‚Äôm not giving you an easier escape
---
Really?  I checked the menu and couldn‚Äôt find them.
---
meme is funny but you have a point.
---
There will always be more survivor mains than killer mains, there is always people who are a nearly even 50/50 but survivor side requires 4x the players than the killer side because that‚Äôs just how the game is designed.
---
That's changing in the new chapter right?
---
You are spot on with that one, first place is a graphic design student at uni, and she is more than happy with the compensation that she got so I don't really think why /u/KillAllLipSmackers is making such a big deal out of this tbh.
---
Where to even begin?   This is another symptom of a systemic problem that touches on many of the negative aspects of the gaming industry in general.  Abusing the passion of the community for their own gain.  Ineptitude of the actual game developer.  Inadequate compensation compared to effort/time spent.
---
They may as well release the code and give 100 auric cells for people to write the bug fixes for them.   They already are beyond mediocre when it comes to actually testing, why not have the community do the development for them.
---
How about nah!
---
You type of player is actually the main reason why the game is being toxic but good for you for learning your lessons and moving on with life.
---
I wanted to delete it after reading my little pony lmao

I agree with what you‚Äôre saying, I see they try to make the op add-ons a bit more balanced by giving them a downside like huntress hatchets being reduced to 1 but you shouldn‚Äôt be able to combo and get more that‚Äôs just too strong in my opinion
---
So true, finally someone who gets it
---
I like cookies
---
That would be hell to code beyond them looking like ps1 level running into walls bots and if they hit it would be OP. I like the idea but execution seems like hell
---
Thanks Mr. Cunningham
---
Yep, so many low ranks ignore my devour hope :)
---
i mean im writing this as a killer main who searches lockers, so yeah
---
I use the mic built in to my headset. Little faster than Morse code

*happy weird grunting noises*

Killer main...and you want another way for the survivors to stunt you. Wow
---
Okay spirit main
---
&gt; with a survivor helping me stopping and walking in circles after every time I fail the Ruin great check 
---
You know you're supposed to stop repairing for like 3 seconds when you fail it? Gens can't progress while sparking, so you're basically just waiting for skill checks making no progress during that time. 
---
I spin around when ones failed just to have a little fun, instead of staring at the gen for 3 seconds every time its failed.

---
Why is Quentin‚Äôs shirt the white tree of Gondor?
---
Wat kf just servants you summon that make a boat load of noise if the survior is around and it shares your perks. Like a totem of sorts so if you have those perks that makes more skill checks or item consumption your lil minon will be there howling and draining their stuff
---
I was called trash at the game just for even playing ghostface. Love this community :)
---
I'm glad it made you happy, lol. I'll be honest, I'm personally a pretty big fan of UE, but I didn't consider it my place to tell people which perks they should run since I see builds as being very much a matter of personal preference. And as you say, stealth is not the be all and end all of evasion. Doesn't matter how stealthy your build is when the killer is already on your ass.
---
I would refuse to kill her. No thanks, couldn‚Äôt do it
---
No problem!
---
So I‚Äôm not the only one. His lunge seems VERY long and it‚Äôs hard to read how far away I need to be to not get hit.
---
They removed the comment of what I was referencing for using a link so I was referencing Kevin 'mr wonderful' O'Leary on shark tank telling people "you're dead to me" all the time
---
Really hope so.
---
Lmao people are so bad!
---
You sound like a guy that tortures insects just for 'fun'
---
Oh totally. It's one of those ideas that would have to be way toned down to be feasible, it's just a cute concept l
---
Why tie the backstory so close to a license like MLP?
---
The things that made Legion OP were not particularly situational. Basically as long as you could follow somebody without triggering a chase, you had a reliable 30-second down.
---
very much seconded.
---
That‚Äôs a good point actually.  You could probably replace the ponies with robots or other types of stuffed animals, like cats or dogs or something cute like that.  I‚Äôm trying to do a summoner killer who uses cute things.
---
no
---
Hang on, you're GEN RUSHING ME? Don't do that it's OP!
---
Definitely not the only one. My friends and I always complain over Freddy‚Äôs lunge. It seems like it‚Äôs further than all the other killers‚Äô lunges
---
Yes. I'll know who needs my help more than others or if the match is completely unfair. I'm surprised they didn't put it in sooner
---
Heck yes
---
You did the right thing. That is the most annoying shit in the world
---
I‚Äôm talking about killer.
---
i am so fucking angry. the artwork showcase is from Nekopara. THATS WHAT I USE FOR TEH AESTHETICS ON MY PROFILE
---
happy to say i dont relate to the other stuff though. being toxic is boring
---
ok then watch him get 15 4mans in a row tf
---
yes so I don't have to play with new players the question is does it show for killer?
---
Crapper as trapper skin when?
---
Sounds like you just don't know how to play him.
---
I did it twice and ran the killer all over the map. You can imagine what happened next.
---
There's a difference between dipping down  to low reds/purples and making a new account and trash talking legit rank 20 killers because  they can't compete with the SWF you bring. 
---
What makes it more infuriating is that she can't even be honest about it. She'll lie constantly about the reason she deranks, but then you can watch her stream and see she legit enjoys making the game as miserable as possible for players withe double digit hours.
---
But it's okay, because sometimes she'll give a pity kill at the end of a round as a final "Fuck you, you need my charity to even get this" move.
---
There‚Äôs a killer who‚Äôs main attack is vomiting.  There‚Äôs an obese clown killer.  There‚Äôs an edgy teenager killer.  A stuffed animal killer isn‚Äôt that big of a stretch.
---
I'd sooner it be Rick over Clem and have Alpha or Beta as killer over Negan.
---
Again, some addons reduce the detection range.
---
Int3r4ct talked about this in his Entity Education series, mostly that there's a lot of different criteria regarding breaking GF out of stealth, including how far away you are, what % of your screen counts as the "exposure zone," what % of GF's body is in your "exposure zone," and how far away from you he is. Fun fact, there's a few meters difference between where he can stalk you and where you can reveal him from, so its entirely possible to stalk someone completely safe from being revealed. 
---
Also, his leaning mechanics force his entire hitbox around the corner, making him as easy to reveal as if he was standing in the open, and there's a delay where he has to be completely out of site for some fraction of a second before the survivors stop revealing him, meaning a lot of the times you've ducked out of sight and still been revealed comes from that delay.
---
No it doesn't
---
I mean, that's fine and you can still keep ponies etc. Bobs Burgers had a whole episode parodying MLP. All I'm saying, conceptually, why take your original idea and shoehorn in another license?
---
Remove the MLP angle and its 100% yours and stands out way more than something like "he has trained martial arts turtles. I got the idea because I love Ninja Turtles"

the only thing here i agree with is that a ds proc doesnt always mean that you're tunneling, if you down the person who unhooked then find the recently hooked person again if they run off somewhere to heal you're gonna eat a stun. a good 70% of the time its tunneling but not all of the time

honestly, idk about other people, but i have 1700 hours due to playing almost constantly from November until now. but a few hundred hours are genuinenly when i have the game open in the background without actually playing

What was that match like. Was it really hard to see or what?

The idea is good, i just disagree with the immediate aacrifice in failure. I feel it should either do mothing on failure like ds, or reduce the time you have left on 2nd phase by a small amount.

---
Edited to where skill check happens right before death.
---
Thanks bro. You will get it too. I know its very hard but it will come in the right moment...
---
The people who complain about survivors wasting killers time aren't very good killers, I guess. This idea is good, since the killer can just kick the locker.
---
Nah, he sucks.

Not really, it‚Äôs their fault if they make themselves go to phase 2 and the game punishes them enough

MLP is a large enough franchise it most likely doesn't need comparison or reference ;) plus there are people out there obsessed with dolls of all types. Silly, but it exists therefore you're on to something
---
Eh, tunneling ain't too big a deal. Especially since survivors have perks to prevent it. Camping just shows a low skill level of the killer but ain't no rule against it either.
---
If you cleanse haunted grounds, it grants the killer power to 1 hit down you for a period of time. It can be very intimidating.
---
Tirigad means you have to be actually close to him - with certain addons - to reveal him. So to an extent, he can be impossible to reveal unless up close, most likely in a chase. Without addons, sometimes even the tiniest part of him being visible can get him revealed. Imo, they should buff the power and nerf the addons a bit.
---
I'm sure there are bugs to an extent, as this is DBD, but what you're describing could easily just be him stacking detection range addons.
---
I would love to as I did previously but I do not have the time now as I've been working alot. I just need to know if those specs would surpass dbd recommended requirements.
---
If you break Haunted grounds, you can get instadowned
---
I'm close but a bit more to go
---
yea but ive seen people die right before escaping when they could have cut it more sharply and they would have made it
---
Nothing wrong with it
---
That's an extremely specific scenario that you have provided for an example. I don't like the DS is often weaponized but it's far from OP.
---
Yeah I‚Äôd definitely prefer they fix the absolute shit show that is the current legion, instead of give us a minor tweak to LF or Clown
---
You lose points for camping
---
I have to give you a silver
---
You spelled jane wrong
---
Damn. You literally ran from one corner of the map to another without getting blocked by any obstacles. Corny maps are corny.
---
I would say it‚Äôs ok to camp and tunnel if exit gates are powered and four survivors are left but camping and tunneling at the start of the match is far from ok
---
Did you have alert?

Nurse is A rank at least. Freddy should go down to A. Huntress is A. Spirit is S. Clown is B. And leatherface is the WORST killer in the game.
---
It was a good joke but personally I would rather get a rick roll

two thumbs are required for it bc your left thumb (or right, depending on control scheme) moves your body and is essential for total accuracy

Nurse is A rank at least. Freddy should go down to A. Huntress is A. Spirit is S. Clown is B. And leatherface is the WORST killer in the game. IMO

This is how Meg mains feel when they run the killer for 5 gens
---
They absolutely should.  
---
It‚Äôs the distance we want nerfed.  GFs shouldn‚Äôt be broken out of shroud when their on the other side of the map, however they definitely should be if they‚Äôre peeking 5 ft away from a hooked survivor
---
Nope just rank that's literally it.
---
She got $100 worth of compensation. Whether it's a $100 bill, $100 Amazon gift card, or $100 worth of auric cells.
---
And Auric Cells clearly have worth to them if theyre a big enough fan of DBD to make a whole guide
---
Question
---
What is your view on camping if the other three survivors are raptor circling the hook victim as soon as they are hooked, waiting for killer to leave so they can rescue, instead of doing gens or taking killer agro away?
---
It would be useless, but a fun perk to run if they made it an actual thing.
---
Nope. That resets whenever you prestige
---
It wasn‚Äôt supposed to be clever but alright
---
i think that would be a little too op in my opinion but it would be a nice thing to try at least with the hillbilly and leatherface
---
I‚Äôm as competitive as it gets with this game, and even I think sending Morse code through gems is a little overboard
---
Well, horror movies aint my thing, mostly beacuse the caracters thend to be idiots. "Oh my god, a lot of blood. lets split up and get murdered one by one"
---
i like rather to watch Lord of the rings instead. still, horror movies are good movies, i just dont like them that much
---
7 minutes straight? How many gens were done?
---
The plague has some great perks. Maybe freddy for bloodwarden or hag for ruin
---
&gt;you paint him like hes a good person though the guy has one of the worst pasts imaginable he's view botted, hacked legacy, has ruined people, and more the annoying thing is that hes currently one of the biggest reps oce has but half the community hates him
---
They all wanted Outbreak 3, haha.
---
Hate it when I‚Äôm looking for the Hatch and my penis flops out
---
That‚Äôs pretty lame. Killers should be able to see the ranks of who they‚Äôre going up against as well.
---
Lmao! That's why I don't put ttv in my name.
---
Hes also a child rapist sooo... keep that in mind while ur getting looped
---
It's rank reset...none.
---
Whew. Nice. I just picked the game back up a week or two ago and have been grinding to unlock bbq and chili learnable. Was going to be super bummed if I suddenly had to redo 20+ levels of killer. I still haven‚Äôt figured out how to max hloodpoints so it takes me a while.
---
it still applies, where‚Äôs your case? having a high sensitivity on controller where your camera is more limited due to using joysticks vs having a high sensitivity and speed with a mouse. again, flicks for killers and 360s for survivors is easier on pc than console
---
Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
It's just spirit cosplaying as trapper don't worry
---
When you put it like that, yeah I see your point. Like how hiding in view of the hook victim when you use insidious is a bad idea.
---
The games where I run for 5 gens or when I make a killer dc are 100% worth it. The satisfaction from cross mapping that shitty claudette that you‚Äôll never find for the rest of the game as huntress. The fun meme games you have after the wannabe Ochido DC‚Äôs and the killer is feeling nice. Thats what make me stay. I love this pile of garbage with all my heart even though it makes me feel like trash most of the time.
---
aye, congrats, your guide is great!
---
My teammates were trying to help Me as much as possible, But They were randoms, so I couldn't tell them to do gens, after I was killed the 5th gen popped though, They were a really good team, taking hits, trying to lure Him away, He just really liked those goggles.
---
Your post was good until the Twitter-thot ‚Äúsksksks‚Äù
---
Why would anyone be salty about that? It's literally a free win, especially if you are in a swf
---
That just makes it worse.
---
Bowel movement. They pooped on u/Fostnnnm
---
I don't see the problem with that lol
---
Something similar happened to me. I got unhooked and made a mad dash to the open exit gate, got right about where the survivor was in this clip and the bear trap on me went off
---
you did nothing wrong man its cool i just really dont like fungoose
---
Some people dont have friends
---
Same but with haystacks.
---
Exactly. There‚Äôs been a big influx with campy GFs at least for me.  It‚Äôs just a bad idea to buff it in that way.
---
I‚Äôd rather them actually fix shroud to within a certain range he can only be revealed, fuck even fixing the box on it for both reveal and unreveal mechanics would be amazing
---
Does your phobia still trigger if the Clown is wearing the Santa outfit?

I mean if you're in struggle you bout to die anyway.

Just use the tv on your pc?
---
When the person is hanging, they are safe, as nothing worse can happen to them
---
you can let them hang for a while, you don't have to go to save them ASAP
---
Cuz theres a chance get baby killers/baby survivors
---
It‚Äôs quite fine after the first time they do it, you just gotta predict which side they‚Äôll turn and lunge that way.
---
ok fine genuine question, what streamer is this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IHRszZLg1o
---
Then they start pointing. And I just feel shameful.
---
That would actually be quite good
---
it kills me when people start crawling around before recovering fully. you come to them to save them and you see that 50%... not enough time to fully heal you cuz the killer is on their way. fuck you mr slug. This would encourage people to recover fully.
---
Those points would also fall into the worst category (survival)

Yo momma.
---
I went into a match going to play huntress for fun because I‚Äôm not great with her but saw four ttvs and switched to Hag with silent/invisible trigger and extra range addons and it was a blast. Only one to escape was the Claudette with a key that made it to the hatch I closed a second before me and had a key. She deserved the win.
---
Honestly it's the complete opposite for me I get teammates that actually do bones and work on generators and I even get baby killers(sucks for them if I'm being honest) making matches so much easier
---
HO ERE CANNEA FLUSH TAE TOILET AFTA THEY AV ADDA SHAT!? DIS GAS TANG!
---
He has no map pressure, it's also very easy to get him out of his stalk
---
It's easier for people that are normally rank 1 because theres a much higher chance to play against bad players. If you're normal rank 10ish then it just adds a bunch of rank 1s close to your rank and makes it harder sometimes.
---
Speak for yourself I'm using it to keep the God pallet up the whole game....it really would be too strong.  Seriously count the amount of time you can cost a killer just at that one loop then imagine being able to keep it in tact the whole game.  Wouldn't work.  Good players would have a field day with killers.
---
Right, point being I'm sure we all can visualize what you're on to
---
Buy them and the perks you want will more likely pop up. All just RNG. You might be lucky tho cuz it took my buddy from level 2 until level 50 to upgrade his DS to tier 3
---
There‚Äôs literally no reason to play Legion if you just play Plague.
---
Plague and Legion both work as M1 Killers fundamentally (unless people Cleanse, which rarely happens.) Legions strength is being able to injure multiple people very quickly, but honestly you‚Äôre better off chasing Broken Survivors as Plague, with the added bonus of being able to infect Objects and having a machine gun if anyone‚Äôs cleanses.
---
Oh god. You enter the locker mid chase. Killer sees you enter. They open it, POOF activates. Head On charges before they can open it again
---
profit
---
Til Death Do Us Part (obsession perk): Killer starts the match with one obsession. For every hit made on the obsession, gain a token. Each token grants an 4/6/8% reduction in healing speed (self-care and on other survivors). Lose 3/2/2 tokens when when the obsession is hooked. Lose 5/4/4 tokens when the obsession is sacrificed.  Maximum tokens of 8. 
---
Cold Feet: Whenever you lose a chase within 2/4/5 seconds after breaking a pallet, the survivor you were previously chasing is exposed for 4/5/6 seconds. 
---
Here Comes The Bride:  Survivors in your terror radius for 10/8/8 seconds scream in fear, providing a notification to the killer. Can only occur once ever 60/45/40 seconds.
---
when I play survivor, I'll admit I stand at the exit gate but that's because every secodnd I stand there is 1 more xp and I need those iridescents as a new player NotLikeThis
---
I wanted Freddy too but I'd get more bang for my buck to get the two of them together.
---
it only speaks about Aura, so probably not
---
sadly, it only appears once right now and I haven't seen anyone test it properly
---
can't wait for them to add this effect to insidious (I'm quite sure one day they will, as they said they wanted to add this effect to some future and current perks. insidious seems fitting
---
If you promise to create a relevant title next time you post something.
---
Passion, passion, passion... a common theme.   One of the most easily abused traits by any company, but especially the gaming industry.  Passion is nothing more than the corporate buzzword for "we'll pay you less than you worth because you actually like the job".  Willingness to accept such low rewards and even comparing to unpaid internships are a huge part of the employment problem in graphic design/artist positions as well as many others.   Who needs to hire an actual employee when they can rotate through the "passionate" people willing to work for peanuts or "exposure"?  It is an industry with a race to the bottom as well as creates the "exposure" standard of payment that you will eventually wind up posting on /r/choosingbeggers.   You might be fine with exposure now, but that won't put food on the table or a roof over your head when businesses are using it as primary payment for a job.
---
Waiting for Iron Maiden to be a main perk run for the next week or so
---
I honestly would like that
---
I think that if they added those, they'd also decrease the charge speed
---
The existence of these memes are just further proof that this build is cancer. Strong opponents shouldn't make everyone default to one build on one killer. The state of balance in this game is a joke.
---
Well shit!
---
Thank you random internet person, I kinda wanna play this imaginary killer now!
---
Thanks; will check it out
---
Found the SWF member who got 4K'd by a Ghostface
---
Wait, whaaaat?
---
Is there a Special Infected in the background during the cage sequence? Shit, I need to rewatch it.
---
Fixated is pretty OP not gonna lie
---
üëâüòéüëâ back at ya
---
I think part of it is his weapon is shorter than other killers, but they all have the same hitbox, so Fredworth always appears like he's behind you. I think they said they tried to fix it, but with lag compensation and all I bet he's still probably the one that will be the furthest behind on weird hits.
---
lmao, love how people keep downvoting me for using my brain and thinking logical instead of just assuming things and playing like a donkey butt.
---
So hilarious!
---
Lol any time!
---
I don't know about buffing or nerfing, legion is pretty damn fast in a chase so buffing him will make that whole tunneling Strat even more effective cause me and my friends haven't found anyway to escape him.
---
I think all of the originals are there. Witch, Boomer, Smoker, Tank, and Hunter. There's a sequence of all the cases as they zoom out and they're all visible. There's a YouTube video that highlights them I'm pretty sure
---
Also keep in mind depending on the map, this may go back up to 4 years ago (or whenever during game development)
---
Holy fuck, THAT is what he‚Äôs supposed to look like? Rip Quentin and Laurie‚Äôs faces. I hope Nancy and Steve make it out alright.
---
People have hundreds of ebony moris. Ultra rares arent that rare at level 50+
---
Yeah I get it.  But that's one of my biggest gripes.  Part of it is the really crappy matchmaking system, but as a killer when I am trounced, both gates gates open, no one hooked, basically a worst case scenario...  Survivors are rewarded with more points if the drag my pain on longer.  If the hang out, maybe even go back in for a chest or just to vault the nearest pallet a bunch...  short of running no Ed there isn't much I can do but be unhappy at take it in the butt.  Also why I no longer main killer.  Too stressful.
---
Same. Gotta get those extra points.
---
Tbf its not like they are getting them every bloodweb. They acquired them overtime and virtually never use them.  And also with any offering, you dont want it to virtually not exist so it has to be common to some degree but still the rarest of all.
---
Time to look that up. Thanks!
---
I thought it'd be cool to make a pink add-on for Freddy where you'd get 5 pallets and 5 snares so people would be confused as to what you're running, kinda like the king in doctor's add-on except you get a bit more control over what is being applied, plus i think it would just make it more fun to play as and against
---
Let me give it a go to try and please you, On days like this kids like you *should be burning in The MacMillan Estate, Autohaven Wreckers, Coldwind Farm, Crotus Prenn Asylum, Haddonfield, Backwater Swamp, L√©ry's Memorial Institute, Red Forest, Springwood, Gideon Meat Plant, Yamaoka Estate, Ormond, Hawkins National Laboratory, Basement and Killer Shack*
---

---
Not a typo.   If they can get away paying $100, they may as well keep lowering the amount until people stop giving them discounted work.   $100 of virtual currency is relatively useless as well when the prices are propped up by whales and ego boosters.  Shall we really look at the price to value on almost all of the cosmetics in the store (adam's 1 cm taller hair for $4)?   Or the fact that buying characters is literally twice as expensive as spending real cash on the dlc while providing you with LESS content?   $100 in real cash or an amazon gift card would be immensely more valuable and versatile.
---
Yeah so what happens when people dont use them for a long time then they can play hundreds if games with this over powered offering
---
HOOK DAYYYYYY!!!
---
I think both sides are as shitty and lazy as each other, really. Playing both sides a lot it's just tedious and breaks the fun of the game, and I'd argue even feels like it goes against the game's spirit. Survivors are really supposed to end a chase by escaping and going into hiding, not just milk an area brimming with overly safe pallets for 10 minutes. I don't know how they even enjoy doing that because I've given it a shot before out of curiosity and just found it dull as hell. I get way more enjoyment as both a Survivor and Killer running all over the map, darting through windows and trying to hide than than playing an extended merry-go-round. I think it takes more actual skill and thought to try to loose sight of the Killer and utilise stealth, considering your scratch marks and noises. It's funner for both sides, I think. I really just see milking a safe pallet loop (since few Killers can counter them), that is to say making it go on for for a stupidly long time before doing it again and again and again at the next pallets metres away, are being as miserable an experience as camping or being camped. I wish the developers would change things to discourage both milking a safe pallet and camping.
---
What do you call a cow with no legs?  
---
Ground beef.   
---
(PC)
---
Time to carry people to hatch for six ranks
---
Same thing with the moris. Also bare in mind the survivors can see the killer as well. not sure if that was clear. Wouldnt say that makes it OP but without a doubt very strong.
---
Sometimes people go the train of thought of "I"ll just let him get to tier 3 off of me, juke him until it runs out, and then he won't be able to stalk me as much later"
---
I don't remember the math but I believe if you stalked everyone fully, it gives you enough juice for four or five Tier 3 stages. And the strategy is you should have more than enough pallets and terrain to juke on and outlast any early Tier 3s, making it so when the game is almost over, he can't actually stalk you anymore.
---
What ends up happening in practice is typically the follow:
---
* He just 99's on you and then downs you normally
---
or
---
* He's infinite Tier 3 Micheal and you've now royally fucked up
---
No, that's the clown that gets hungover. Legion just gets crippling depression.
---
Clementine can just climb the big border walls and just leave lmao
---
This really isn't remotely true.  He is known specifically for not camping and tunneling.  If you don't like the guy that's cool but don't make shit up about him either.  Anyone subscribed to his channel will have watched enough of his gameplay to know this is horseshit.
---
You're doing it wrong if it takes even half that.
---
Hm. Thats odd cause it seems like most killers do just a tad bit less. And huntress seems really strong at high ranks. Are you positive this is taking only red rank/rank one data?
---
No
---
Excellent. Didn't think so, but was curious.
---
The other day I had a game where I ran the killer until the exit gates were powered. 
---
No NOED, it‚Äôs a Freddy, he slugs me first then goes after both my friends while the random CROUCH WALKS inside the exit gate until he hooks all 3 of us and then leaves. I message ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you help your team?‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt gonna risk it then we‚Äôd all die I did gens‚Äù 
---
You telling me. That somehow Freddy is gonna watch 3 separate hooks ACROSS THE MAP without NOED and you‚Äôre at full health? For the record I completed 1 gen before with my friend before the killer found us and then my 2 friends worked on the rest of the gens and saw the Claudette help with 2 of the early gens before searching chests, urban evading to nowhere on the edges of jungle gyms anytime they got scared, and didn‚Äôt open the exit gate and escaped with 9000 points. Seems. Legit. That‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt be bothered relying on randoms literally ever.
---
Absolutely not your just playing aggressively that's all, his threats fall on deaf ears.
---
It‚Äôs a perk called head on
---
Its creating new web tiles, entity needs more survivor souls to make into grass :p
---
Oh good point. This should cause exhaustion. Edited main post.
---
Yes but even if the survivors see the killer coming. The survivors are still visible to the killer and hiding will be impossible. It would literally break the game
---
You're welcome!
---
It was a really good movie
---
As i pointed out in my post, this discussion is for non-camping Killers.
---
The kind of killers we are talking about is those that use BBQ and immediately goes for someone else after hooking someone.
---
I would argue The Game is worse personally
---
Thats why, when i thought it through a bit more, i thought of making it so it doesn‚Äôt work when inside of a 40m or so radius of the killer.
---
They can do a graphics overhaul but adding anything new to the core gameplay loop would be tricky since it'll be upsetting a delicate balance between survivors and killers.
---
Nancy and Steve actually look perfectly like their actors probably because they got permission to use their faces so don't worry Steve"The Hair" Harrington and Nancy will look fine.
---
Let's rework cornfields, haddonfield and junkyard maps first. Then we can rework that one map that survivors don't like.
---
Then send it for the save
---
&gt;$100 in real cash would be immensely more valuable
---
What if they lived in Zurich where a gallon of milk costs $6.50 USD. You claim cash is more valuable but the worth of something is both subjective and varies by region. Would this be taxed? Would it be a bill or a check? How would they get the person the physical money? 
---
That's not realistic, especially for just a contest
---
Solo here who has many hours into GF. He‚Äôs broken and unfun for survivors. Better to just DC and move onto the next game.
---
imo the graphics card is a bit low on power
---
I dont think so but I thought body blocking was an offence of some sort, maybe if you dont use your power, you should be good. One time a bubba body blocked me into a corner for about 15 minutes just to troll me- I'm thinking that might be reportable, not sure
---
It be like that sometimes.
---
A man of culture I see
---
Or you get to watch her crouch walk around for a bit on the edge of the map
---
Ok. Thank you for being polite mate! Anyway, I try to keep camping down to ‚Äúraptor circling survivors keep killer at hook‚Äù mode.
---
I was more joking about them but it‚Äôs a shame about the other licensed human characters.
---
Yeah I suppose but it‚Äôs more of like they tried to rob the unhook points thank anything
---
Yeah, body blocking is reportable, which is what prompted this thought process. 
---
But as long as you don't abuse it (I.e trapping and not doing anything) that doubt anything would be an issue.
---
Its there own fault for hiding in a blockable corner
---
This is why i dont hide in corners against leatherface,plague and billy
---
Where‚Äôd she put all that hair?!
---
Mmmm Lerys is a good survivor map and a good killer map depending on the killer. 
---
Otherwise Lerys is horrible for most killers.
---
She has discovered the force.
---
The same as WASD imo
---
The same thing that happens in more than half of all games: she DC'd
---
Any proof on this annoucement?
---
Very good art, keep it up
---
The damaged is a lot better
---
I‚Äôm still hopeful that we‚Äôll get him in the game someday, I mean it‚Äôs not like anyone‚Äôs playing his game anymore
---
Like i play survivor enough for that. This template is just shit

Dude the game has some of the best survivor loops. Anyone that things that the game is bad for survivors isn't a good looper.
---
Same thing happened to me but with BBQ &amp; chili
---
The original Halloween isn't that bad either, up until the end where she turns her back on him like 3 times in a row.
---
There should be a fine line between both. You surely need to wait some time for killer to realize he wasting his time standing around. But if you're wait for too long and didn't get killers attention, he may return and secure a hook stage, or just because he thinks if you're not in the place where he looked for you, you're running to the hook.
---
Why would you run spirit fury enduring on a killer that shouldnt be lunging through pallets on loops
---
You suggest the $100 as bait to play reddit gotcha games to be pedantic, or do you actually want to get at the root of the issue?  $100 is absolutely relative, which I agree.  So if they posted it as a contract job, how many people from Zurich would find it worth their time to even bother with it?   Only those desperate enough to work for it would apply, if anybody. 
---
&gt; especially for just a contest
---
A contest that should have been done by the actual company to show competence in understanding the game they built.  This contest only further goes to highlight how much better the community is at the game and understanding it than the actual designers.  Not to mention the actual design skills shown off being better than the company as well.  And that is ignoring the problem of outsourcing the work for exposure bucks and pittance of a payment...something that plagues many industries.
---
Lerys also has like 20 amazing windows though. And killers cant get rid of those, so they can be used a thousand times by every survivor. Just get better at looping with windows, don't rely on only pallets. Lerys also has the benefit of being complete dogshit for a lot of the best killers, Nurse, Billy, and Huntress especially.
---
Solo queue in a nutshell.
---
Looks like you got yourself caught in a roundabout....Yes?
---
Idk I feel like that's not a completely fair comparison. These players are extremely skilled as killer, but the fact of the matter is an average killer will lose most if the time to a coordinated team of SFW unless you play a high tier, cheese killer.
---
It's like why people complain about Elo hell in League of Legends. If the player skill is about gold but gets placed in bronze and continuously gets matched with bronze players, the gold skilled player probably can't carry his team and will have a hard time climbing. But if you get someone who is challenger to start off in bronze, they'll be able to climb out in a few days.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt walk away from someone just cause they failed a hook escape. Never have and don‚Äôt intend to.
---
I kind of want to see the original just for a good cringe.
---
You are 100% correct - I'm not a good looper, I'll admit it.

It was the work of an enemy stand!

Rough but it's a cool sketch nonetheless.

Since Clowns kit predates Freddy's reworked kit isn't that more of a dig at the unoriginality surrounding Freddy than it is Clown?
---
This is a hypothetical situation.

*Aestetic*
---
I only had tier 2 whispers so that‚Äôs why I used bitter murmur instead but if I had tier 3 I would have used that instead but I just got the achievement anyway thanks to baby survivors who I apologised to after :)

oh no

Enough to comment though so your heart was in a place for it.
---
Lol fuck I feel bad for you man. It‚Äôs never that bad for me lol.
---
Ok now I feel better I wasn‚Äôt the only one lol
---
While I agree completely I don't see it as an issue. The game is about as casual as a game can be.
---
Lol when I got that achievement a Jane went into a locker for about 6 minutes before she gave up
---
Then he'd have to edit out everything he said at that moment and lose some gameplay
---
Personally I would prefer if they keep updating this game, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind a sequel. Maybe if it had a new gamemode. The main thing I‚Äôd like to see in a sequel would be revamped graphics like you said. It would add nicely to the atmosphere and make it feel like a true horror game.
---
Lol now I look like a cunt
---
Hands down the worst survivor map is shelter woods by far.
---
Yes, but she's consistently more difficult and the lower frame rate makes hits hard to land and is more punishing. She's bad on Xbox. No doubt the best on PC though.
---
Y‚Äôknow it is entirely feasible that a DBD character could appear in Smash Bros. Most likely will never happen but it‚Äôs not impossible.
---
The game? Worst survivor map? No, not even remotely close. Game has some of the strongest pallets and loops.
---
We need more people like him in this community, honestly. They don't have to be super popular streamers or anything, they don't even have to play godlike or even good... being nice is all that matters, because it's still a game, and behind a screen there are still real people wanting to have fun.
---
I'm trying my best to spread positivity whenever I can, even when I was downed and facecamped to death 2 seconds into the game. It's so much more fun enjoying a game than being angry and salty because of it. :)
---
Maybe they‚Äôll put it in VR next year since the game is booming rn, but I think we‚Äôve all suggested, two killers &amp; 8 survivors and a huge freaking map ! Or a mode where you can actually fight back the killer with different escapes like in Friday the 13th ! Which I would love to see
---
Thank You, it fills the hole in a way
---
Definetly agree with you
---
No it was Dead Hard tier 4

Make an alt account and practice on that.
---
Ok ü§≠
---
Because all ranks reset. All the level 1s are reset back with the level 15. This is when you'll find the toxic of the toxic killers and survivors, and the potatoes who are in over their head. 
---
Granted, just because someone is a red rank doesn't mean they aren't playing like a level 17.
---
I have seen it. Otz had a whole video about it, pretending we were watching new level 20s and what they are doing wrong and how to fix it, but revealed later that they were all red ranked survivors. Educational video.
---
Maybe if they added a ‚Äúbeginners mode‚Äù where only players who haven‚Äôt reached devotion 1 yet are allowed to play in? Then the main mode is the one we have now?
---
Gotta be like a real killer. They tease them with an escape, but then just murder the f*ck out of you.
---
I don't usually do it, because of wiggling.
---
Handsome boy! Love it!!
---
Nurse?
---
Im the toxic one while this guy complains about swf
---
Piss off lol this sub is so heavily killer-sidded
---
I couldn't get on earlier... would let me and my buddy connect to eachother for SWF but once game was loading up it would kick me out before game started
---
The game is one of the Best survivors map. Has a shit tom of safe pallets and places to use balanced landing.
---
Legion should be able to hop into a locker to make a different Legion come out of a random locker. Their power shouldn't deplete if they miss. Feral Frenzy should be able to down a survivor if all targets are mending.
---
I sometimes will die for that hooked survivor
---
stupidly strong windows, long loops, you just gotta know how they generate and how to use them correctly.
---
Guys, he's talking about how fucked up Billy's face is.
---
Just give him stretchy arms like the movie, that‚Äôd be hilarious to see from a 3rd person.
---
No, that is not an offense. If you get them trapped in a corner then stay there, not letting them out, then that is holding the game hostage. Its their fault for hiding in a corner. You just capitalized on that misplay.
---
As a Claudette main, I hate those type of Claudette's, just crouch humping everywhere and trying to solo win instead of doing gens/totem smashing/hook saving for the team.
---
I‚Äôm actually going to try that with the hag now lol
---
Controller just wasn't for me as a killer. With high sensitivity, I could hit 360s but I couldn't do anything else. As a survivor, though, I still prefer controller over mouse and keyboard.
---
I don't know  if they would ever bother to buff the weaker BP offerings again. A small cool thing they could have done at the very least is have them buff your own personal BP gain on the specific category. This would legitimately make them worth in the scenarios you dont plan on doing too many actions that give points to that category, so a gen jockey helping one person off a hook and healing em would score them a good amount of points in the altruism action.

I'll probably mess with this in my next KYF match, wonder what other collision changes with the latest update have in store.

Do you prefer survivor for the 360s? Sine you just turn the analog stick
---
It's fine as Myers imo. Since your tier 3 gives you an instadown it makes sense you'd want to slug than waste time hooking
---
Are you silly?
---
DBD doesn't have a population big enough for separate ranks and the "ranked" system is not a real one anyway, stop treating like it. Just act like every match was casual (which pretty much is). 
---
Even if some regions could have separate queues, DBD is a global game and this system would negatively affect some regions more than others.

It seems like you have a chip on your shoulder

---
He was laughing about it. His friends were laughing about it. The killer got a pity kill.
---
Why call him an idiot?
---
I believe billy and spirit are the meth heads on the killers roster, billy, got his scars &amp; burns in a meth lab explosion would have killed him but the demon Methamphetaminus offered him a new ingredient that would not only empower him but his chainsaw! (Only thing I could think of to explain it lol) and spirit, I mean just look at her stance. She‚Äôs tweekin, geekin, &amp; freakin.
---
Even hot wheels bubba with his best add ons still is worse then a perk less Michael.
---
It's almost better not to try if you have a habit of missing the skillcheck altogether.  Unless perked, two people on a gen repair at a slower rate than 2 on seperate gens.  The advantage is it gets done faster and the killer has less of a chance of finding you when you aren't at different gens.  Missing a skillcheck messes up both of these.
---
It‚Äôs not toxic inherently but 9/10 the person who uses it wants to get my attention and loops and tbag and says baby killer GG EZ and the likes just try and cull the stereotype and be positive
---
Idk man, he's surprisingly good bc people on xbox play weirdly. Do remember that Xbox for a time had Legion as the most played/popular character in the game from release until the rework. It's basically the Australia of the DBD platforms
---
It‚Äôs one of those perks like No-Mither. It‚Äôs shit to 90% of people, but those who are ballsy enough to use it usually know what they‚Äôre doing.
---
That's how it is for me basically all the time.
---
&gt;grow a pair.
---
I mean, doesn't that go both ways?
---
I honestly want this as a skin
---
Excuses is more like it, don't excuse these devs from fixing their fucking game instead of telling them to give us shitty bright cosmetics
---
Copyrights killed Friday the 13th instead.
---
Yeah Lower Generator requirements and make it as a separate game mode, it'll be like the blitz version of the core mode.
---
Bruh who the fricky-dikky is filming on their phone in 2019? 
---
Pro tip: Get OBS. Its free
---
Any killer with Barbecue &amp; Chili or the killer you can play the best. 
---
Personally I like to farm with Nurse because with her you have total control over the game's pace and every blink nets you points in 2 or 3 categories (hunting after finding a survivor and deviousness with brutality for hitting after a blink).
---
Probably Legion or Doctor
---
How it would make killer shack and jungle gyms weak but in them bubba is useless. I think it would be fine it would be very similar to trapper and it wouldn‚Äôt be strong because it would take 8 seconds that is a long ass time.
---
I would not be a good "influencer" on this game. I call my teammates trash every other game for the smallest things
---
All 7 of us shall rise!
---
Legion is the best. They can fill all 4 categories rather quickly. Doc's a pretty close 2nd.
---
Really though playing the killer you're best at is usually the fastest way to get blood points.
---
feel good,i hace like 7 steam profile hatemails
---
The first line is kinda unnecessary
---
How did they cheat, exactly?
---
Doctor.
---
Personally I find hag is great.
---
Being able to reveal him through walls isn't what's happening. There's a buffer time of 0.2 seconds between the game deciding if he is in or out of view.
---
If you've been looking at him for 1.3 seconds, even if he's behind cover that 0.2 second buffer will still end up with him being revealed.
---
They didn‚Äôt cheat though... body blocking is an intentional in-game mechanic. Sounds toxic af though.
---
He said that to you 'cause everyone is saying that the Dbd Quentin does not look at all like the "real" Quentin from the movie.
---
The utter meta changes that Inner Strength will bring are whack. Thrill of the Hunt and Iron Maiden will he seen more, No-Ed will rarely be a problem (Like it was to begin with...), and it has synergy potential with most survivor perks.
---
They didn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt take rank 20‚Äôs seriously man lmao
---
Congrats on being an asshole, I guess? If you facecamp everyone that loops you're gonna be facecamping pretty much everyone. What do you expect them to do, run in a straight line?
---
Doctor with distressing, monitor, BBQ and the green electrode add-on that adds range to your electricity. People start screaming all over the place and you get crazy bloodpoints
---
It completely negates stealth killer powers, wraith, pig and ghostface also 9/10 of survivors that use it are little shitheads.
---
Friday the what?
---
Have you done editing before? You can pin point time stamp content and edit it. A simple transition seconds before he said what he said and after to bridge the gap and done.
---
Damn I kinda feel bad for him
---
I figured, I just want to get more into what makes someone this dumb lol
---
it's a perk that falls under a very specific circumstance.
---
in a regular game, where all 4 Survivors are randoms and have no form of communication, it's perfectly fine as a perk. you and the killer see eachother as a arua, the Killer has knowledge of you and you have knowledge of them.
---
however, and this is a very big however, in a 4 man SWF, Object Of Obsession turns into a tool to constantly let your group know exactly where the Killer is. you don't have Object Of Obsession, your team has constant eyes on the Killer, with no downside.
---
I don‚Äôt get it but take my upvote
---
What is the survivor supposed to do besidea looping?  Talk about entitlement.
---
I don't know if you have dlcs or not so I'm not going to recommend killers but a good way to gain some is to use bloody party streamers and survive pudding. Another good way is bbq and chilli as I can buff up your blood points by 100% if you hook all survives. 
---
If I had to choose though I would recommend the legion as with the buffs I have said I walk out of a match with 50k blood points if I fully apply myself to the match.
---
Hope it was helpful
---
What kind of sorcery is the entity doing
---
Lithe, Balanced Landing, Dance with Me, Poised, Urban Evasion, Quick and Quiet, and head on say otherwise
---
Just wait til Nancy comes out
---
I can imagine nothing sadder. Let them have it for the price of 3 gens.
---
I‚Äôm not excusing them, I‚Äôm just informing people that hitboxes aren‚Äôt the issue and complaining more accurately might do some good
---
True, yes. I add it to the list
---
What kind of horses only come out after dark? Nightmares.
---
Obscenely. It's so bad that camping is apparently meta. There is that little confidence in being able to secure a second down.
---
its... pinned on this sub
---
Self care takes around 40 seconds and is called a shit perk by many.
---
Inner Strength requires finding a totem, cleansing it (14 seconds), finding a locker, and then waiting 8 seconds. And it has limited uses. I don't think it will be broken.
---
probably
---
There‚Äôs a report function for it and it‚Äôs not clear in-game so there‚Äôs still a good bunch of people who think it‚Äôs against the rules.
---
Even if balance was proper, people would default to the strongest meta against a strong opponent.
---
He does kinda suck in my opinion but he‚Äôs still fun
---
Real talk. I know this is the Inferior Freddy from the reboot, but I don't think there's any legal issue with giving him the stretch.
---
Play above rank 5, you'll change your mind
---
who says I can't have fun face camping a survivor as leatherface.
---
Naw you could see it in the survivors eyes they were gonna continue its a simple gesture really 1 squat is thanks anymore is salt

SURF BILLY incoming.....REEEEEE

What is this, Overwatch???
---
Saw that coming from the point where she fast vaulted.
---
no to me having fun?  how rude.
---
That's the point? Most of these palets are Designed so you drop them and go to the next one/win a mindgame and move on rather than just brainlessly sitting at it untill the killer breakes it. These palets finaly show the difference between a good and a medium survivor.
---
Doctor is cosplaying.
---
I think that we could never see him. The trapper is quite like Jason, as The Clown reminds me of IT Clown.
---
wait wait let me get this straight, so because an average killer who's gameplay and playstyle is riddled with mistakes and poor choices throughout the game, who plays with bad builds/perks, who most likely doesn't know the 15 second chase drop rule, plays against less than average survivors, the fact they lose falls directly on the survivors playing with each other and not the killer for learning what mistakes they're making and how to correct their bad playstyle choices??? are you fucking kidding me
---
this is the problem with this community, instead of admitting they're making dumb choices that lose them the game, they just make up excuses and say idiotic things like "unless you play a high tier cheese killer". No, it's literally **been proven that you can 4K without addons on any killer** if you take the time to listen to some one who is more experienced than you, played more than you, and made every single mistake that you can as killer, learn from those mistakes and  learn from your own mistakes and you can 4K with any killer without addons too. but see that's way too hard for someone with two whole brain cells and people would rather just say "i dont suk its swf!! and thats an exploit!!!!" and keep making up reasons as to why they just flat out are terrible.
---
That statement right there is worth all the gold on this planet!!! Make them eat there words

New bloodweb.
---
Scoops
---
I actually really like that Clue mechanic
---
But do you know what causes it? If it's something they can abuse it's much worse than if it's a random glitch from some interaction between killer and survivor
---
Yeah totally. Literally every post i see is something complaining about killers and how toxic they are. 
---
You can prove me wrong if you want to
---
Slugging is a viable practice.
---
Deny it all you want, you know its true
---
I cackled.
---
You just said it... Working on gens, is camping fun? Hell no but if everyone works on gens you're out in no time.
---
The Hawkins lab map looks amazing.
---
Oh cool thanks
---
Dedicated servers
---
Yes! The biggt threat of a locker door in your face, because dead hard isn't as big as head on
---
That looks awesome!
---
Thats out of your control unfortunately, the devs really should make that a priority. Newer players will just stop playing  because games are unfun.
---
Hating the new map.
---
I got this bug when I wanted to open the Hatch. I got hit mid-animation and was stuck in this position, not being able to sprint, just walk like a boxing Meg. The Pig let me out :)
---
It‚Äôs so annoying like u lose points by doing that too üòÇ so what‚Äôs the point
---
Love this style!
---
Player B distracts killer while player C rescues survivor.  
---
Player A loops better so as to not get downed.  
---
OR, while K is camping A, B C D all work gens and can get the gen's down significantly.
---
Why do all of your memes suck?
---
Is monitor and abuse really that important on him? His tier 1 has a pretty small radius on it's own. I want to learn Myers, but I'm missing that perk. I dont really understand the point once you get out of tier 1.
---
So looping justifies facecamping? U one of those killers who thinks survivors should stand in the middle of the map, not doing gens and not trying to run away from you?
---
She's not a survivor nor killer. She's the ent-#$@!
---
Once every month I just want to delete this game and never look at it again.
---
You're a bad survivor cause normally you get 3 hooks, by camping you only got 1 hook and you  still died, blame your teammates for doing gens and not unhooking you just because I was hitting the baby survivor on the hook repeatedly, gg ez
---
I like your idea. Changed the name and a bit of how it works. I think it's a nice mechanic. Kind of has a pig feel. But less death trappy
---
See you can't give me anything other than what I just said by the time all those gens are done I'm already dead on hook. Give me a different answer.
---
I'm down for him to be a killer!
---
If I did that, then it would basically be a better devour hope. Would rather not take away from another perk.
---
I'm looking forward to the new map. Some of those loops like miserable and hard to mind game. I need that pain.
---
Yeah, I just learned that hook suicide isn't bannable, now instead of being a cunt and be salty against nurses/killer builds made only to annoy people AKA 3 gens impossible skill check doctor, I just go to another match, easy as that

---
Why do all Killers share rank? Nurse and Spirit mains are in a hostage situation. If they ever leave her, they'll die.
---
Friday died because they were stopped by a lawsuit.  If they had been able to continue to add content and maps and jason's, DBD would have ended up dead.  DBD got lucky and got the run off players looking for a home.  That coupled with good license acquisitions have resulted in a regular annual to bi annual player influx.
---
Played perfectly? He held M1 and pressed E. It‚Äôs good gamesense because he had dead hard

I mean sure some people might have fun not playing a game and just sitting there afk, but regardless you're ruining the fun of 4 other people.
---
I‚Äôm that Claudette
---
So the people joining for Myers, Leatherface, and Krueger don't exist?
---
Yes you got the joke
---
I nearly always let the last Survivor go, however if the team hasn‚Äôt done many gens and I come across the hatch i‚Äôll close it and let you leave through the door instead. Only time I normally let the last one get the hatch is if there was 4/5 gens done.
---
Any tombstone piece that reads you can kill a survivor in any health state by your hand at Tier 3. Shoukd be a full tombstone and a piece of tombstone. You'll need an add-on to considerably increase rate of evil gained because the tombstones require a lot of evil to gain to use. There's also the tuft of hair that locks you in to tier 3 but unless you have a well hidden ruin, you'll get gen rushed before the evil is gained
---
It‚Äôs not something that the survivor can cause on purpose. It is an accidental glitch in the game. Due to how much it has been happening recently, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be patched soon- or an attempt will be made to patch it.
---
This is neither cheating nor toxic, I'd highly recommend you reconsider why you thought it was in the first place because you aren't going to have fun with this game if your mindset is everything is cheating
---
If it's trapper and he puts someone in the basement, I *know* he's trapped it.  I don't need to see it happen.
---
There are a lot of awful clones and I seen one with 100,000 downloads. Idk who plays them
---
So, you are saying me, that because I, a solo survivor, was matched with a swf, I deserve your BM because you felt so? What a great moral, people like you make me feel less bad for suicide hook
---
Its just a live picture of you worshipping NOED
---
As a killer I play only casually, being a survivor main, I only ever hook anyone twice, and always let last person go (if everyone kills themselves on hooks/dcs.) Unless I'm going for the 60k bps for a doing a mori I try not to kill anyone. I still pip, double pip sometimes too, as long as I get enough gen pressure and hooks etc etc. My favorite thing to do is put on streamers to "share" and then watch everyone gen rush and waste them.
---
I would say its fairly common, especially at lower ranks. Consider it a courtesy and don't expect it.
---
That's a good reason actually. It's kinda like for honor in that way.
---
Ok I guess.
---
The people suiciding isn't really on the Killer, though.
---
You're weird.
---
If you get downed, that's on you.  It happens either because you are bad at being a survivor or you got outplayed by a better killer.  
---
If a killer just camps, then they are wasting their time as  a killer and thus your team of survivors is benefiting.  
---
It a'int the killer's fault if you have shitty team mates.
---
This is a game, not a crime.  Get out of here with your false equivalency.
---
I guess DBD just has a very original premise, an interesting gameplay and a lot of potential to grow. On top of that, you have devs that regularly communicate with the players, a very active community that gives the outsiders the impression that the game is very fun. People love watching the game, not just playing. And, people can play their favorite licensed killers/survivors.  
---
Overall, I think the dedication from the devs and the hype from the players made all of this possible.
---
You can't really compare F13 and DBD because F13's development has been stopped.
---
Stalk to 99, approach and tap it, basically NOED.
---
N00b3 looks like current quintin

Disconnecting REEEEEE

OH LUCKY DAY...

---
&gt;  That coupled with good license acquisitions have resulted in a regular annual to bi annual player influx.
---
Jack Frost CAN'T be expensive to license.
---
It's a bug. It has happened to me twice. When it happens to me, I'll run at full speed for like a minute to feel like Flash and then let the killer down me/sacrifice me because it is not fair lol.
---
Gg ez baby nurse
---
*looking around for strange people*
---
there are also those apple add ons that make some fountains start corrupted
---
I'm torn between Sexy Witches and Sugarplum Fairy.
---
But we know they don't like Dolls.
---
And yet we have Leatherface and Hillbilly. Stranger things can happen. The only reason I could see why Jason wouldn't be part of DbD is either a conflict of interest with the active (yet dead) Friday the 13th game, or the rights issue as to who owns what (which is why the game is no longer supported).
---
The person I face kept flashlight clicking trying to get me to chase her, and then super speed running up going for flashlight saves.
---
I actually caught her becuase she tried to unhook someone literally as I was turning around.. while she was injured lol very cocky
---
That too, but won‚Äôt give as much
---
Slugging is knocking all the players before hooking any, to make it near impossible to win
---
Then the monkey or whatever breed its flings sh** at her
---
What?  
---
I'm literally arguing that it's a terrible tactic and only HELPS the survivors win.  
---
Complaining about Campers is like complaining about cutting off your own foot after you cut off your own foot.
---
Latency is definitely a big issue, but the way hotboxes work and their size is quite suspect too
---
Keep crying.
---
I'm gunna half agree with op for one reason yeah looping is annoying but I also know as a survivor we need it I just think infinites should just not exist also I would love if there was reward for actually being a stealthy survivor instead of running right at the killer and just being aggressive as a survivor. That's what I personally want
---
tbh he had nothing he could've done but to hope freddy makes a mistake and that is exactly what happened
---
What's worse is a few days ago, I repaired basically all gems except one and powered on the gates. I was dead on hook and the killer had NOED and someone got hooked and was cursing me out for not saving him. They did NOTHING at all the whole game besides just hiding around the killer
---
Pig ambush is underrated
---
Merman, its gonna happen this time, I can feel it.
---
Lobbies take long to find as it is, if they added separate queues then it would take even longer to get a match.
---
The amount of detail is fucking amazing take my upvote
---
Judging by your track record you must really think camping and you a hypocrite tell people don't get caught by the killer as if there isn't BBQ and Chili, Nurses, I'm all ears, Whispers, Stridor, Discordance, Add-ons that allows the killer to see aura the recent update that made survivors easier to hear. 
---
Not only that they've made map changes made it easier to see, nerfed vaulting, nerfed looping, nerfed Survivors add-ons, took away darkest moonlight, put hooks closer together. So all these changes that heavily helps the killer and you say don't get caught. Ok asshat thanks for the contribution. 
---
False equivalency? What I present are facts, that others that doesn't have killer main stamped on their forehead would easily agree with. I wouldn't hear killers bitching about how killers are being toxic when they're playing survivor for a daily ritual. I see more killer main end up being that shitty teammate that UE their way around the map and leave you to die. I bet you're highly guilty of it too.
---
Looping isnt toxic at all, its just the only way to make the killer lose time. As a killer main I also think that most survivors confuse tunneling with just chasing the best objective. If you just unhooked someone I will try to kill the unhooked person unless you are injured too because I want to secure that kill as soon as possible so I have more opportunities to win.
---
"I think we've done a great job so far."
---
There wasn't many in this PTB. It's funny how every time they do something for you ungrateful shits god be damned a bug exists. Which they fix. They've gotten around to fixing things very fast recently. Maybe be grateful for what your given otherwise go play an actual broken game like Friday the 13th.
---
I'm not good at the game, I'm going to run it as the only perk on Laurie in a solo game and do trial runs to see how long I can stay alive lol
---
My pocket because I thought it was a good game 2 years ago but now it's a cesspool of sadistic fucks who wants a kill simulator
---
I don't understand, I left the game before the EGC but now I am back so I have no idea, can you explain?
---
Yea kinda but I'm sorta ok with repetitive gameplay also if it means I get different interactions with everyone like I had a interaction with a pretty ok survivor and spared them and I talked give them some tylws. Obviously I'm just giving my thoughts on why the majority stays I stay for how fun it is interacting with people and grinding. I more summed it up rather then going in depth also  I do think there's more smaller on why dbd is so successful and managed to live but  the reason dbd lives because lack of competition and Licensed as stated in my comment.
---
Camping is perfectly okay*
---
I know I've had that glitch it's because u downed them when they used an exhaustion perk the game registered it as it is still happening
---
Okay, if you get trapper great. If I knew I was close to maxing I wouldn‚Äôt even care to die. Even in a regular match I wouldn‚Äôt care to die if I got a ton of points. As long as I got the chance to play.
---
But what about against nurse, hillbilly, spirit, wraith, huntress, Michael, etc. Especially if you don‚Äôt ruin self care. You can‚Äôt get survival points except for escaping or healing yourself or wiggling free. 
---
So no most of the time you cannot max out your blood points as survivor. 
---
As a frequently farming killer, I am more than fine letting everyone live as long as I‚Äôve gotten 2 hooks a piece. I‚Äôm only missing out on 3k bp. If I max everything else out + BBQ stacks it‚Äôs worth it. And hell, If you make sure to make a few of those ‚Äúend game hooks‚Äù after exit it opened, you can completely max out without killing anyone.
---
It's an easy top 10 movie in my book, and plenty of memes in it
---
pyramid head would be cool to play
---
Hey I mean just wait until the new undetectable comes to thoes powers then OoO won't work aginst that tho I do believe there will be a way to see wraith and Ghostface with it but it has to be like maybe ok once every 60 seconds they are visible for 2 seconds idk because not seeing wraith and Ghostface the whole time in their ability may be a tad too op so there will need some way to counter it especially with alert and dark scenes which still shows auras
---
Since they were done in the teasers id say they'll drop with launch.
---
I‚Äôm not saying looping is toxic this meme explains my experience as a survivor
---
Only got whispers tier 1.

The survivors would call you names, send threats, dc and cry on any forum if you do one of the following actions:
---
- stay near the hook after hooking for more than 0.1s
---
- cry about X killer because is oP1!!1!1 (any, even legion)
---
- use add-ons more rare than brown
---
- slug ( in any circumstance)
---
- not respecting 4%, w/e it means (it's too dumb, respecting rng? Ok.)
---
- be a prestiges meta killer
---
- punishing an unsafe hook by slugging the unhooked person
---
- hit the survivor that was unhook before. It's tunnelling which is bad in any circumstance even if was unhooked ages ago
---
- bring any Mori, it's oP!1!!1! Even if means less hook, less emblem, less points
---
- face camping. Which occurs only on low ranks but ok
---
- patrolling, it's toxic. Even if you see people around you have to leave
---
- bodyblock, even if just to ensure a one hit with Billy, it's toxic!
---
- spirit fury. It's toxiccc!!!1!112!
---
- use noed. It's supppa toxic!! (Even if is a wasted perkslot)
---
- not farming if a whiny b**** dc
---
- ignoring flashlight clickers. You have to chase them, it's the rule
---
- cry about hexes (even if they don't do bones)
---
- camp/patrol the last hook when gates are open
---
- nod. It's very toxic!!
---
- existing
---
I could destroy every single point of yours easily but using stereotypes like you did is more fun. Especially since every single one of my points have threads about it here. Yours? Welp, no. Nobody cry about loops for example, asks for suggestions instead. Gen rushing? It's a problem of the game not toxic but something to fix since games last around 3-5min :) I could go on but won't be fair without reading what you are gonna say first
---
I love your art style!!! I hope I could see your doctor fan art someday‚ö°Ô∏è
---
I pray for you guys üôè
---
I mean limited uses of 5 if you get all the totems I personally think inner strength will be used more passively rather than a free heal like saving it like you would DS
---
If anyone needs the clown template hit me up.
---
5 gens left ruin is still up a survivor is already booked and is being camped how does that help the survivor win? You're down a man, you have to find a totem and deal with somebody sitting there and babysitting. This is why Camadarie is going to get nerfed because whiny bitchy campers are going to complain they can't camp and watch. The devs will nerf that perk in Oblivion
---
Swap thrill for huntress lullaby
---
Its risky, but an ideal game is that you get some pressure early with disordance and ruin so that you can have huntress and devour ready before gens get done. 
---
Problem with this one is that it relys on survivors not cleansing devour hope or huntress, and ruin inspires survivors to spread out and do gens, which can defeat discordance. You have to get lucky with totem and survivor spawns. Its good when it works, and if i only had your perks its what id run
---
Link me please.
---
If a generator is completed while a survivor has a helmet on, their helmet timer activates. But lets say the last gen was done with no helmets on the helmets become useless. Thats why when this person ran out of the map there was no gens done= No helmet timer= No instant death.
---
Maybe something in studio testing maybe it broke with other stuff and just decided to nerf the perks. It was definitely internal testing tho to the reason they changed it
---
One game I was playing ghostface, and a deng brought a haddonfield offering with object and balanced, she got downed after a basic mind game and dced.
---
I mean it's logic who wouldn't
---
Ah like the Wake Up bug that was in the PTB then made it to live, right?
---
Ah, didn't read that part.
---
Either way, BHVR is largely responsible for DbD's success. The original Killers are movie worthy and the Survivorsbare well done.
---
But people keep complaining about noted so this is the devs way of saying "do the bones you idiots" and giving an incentive to do so
---
Then get rid of rank entirely. Everyone would que together all the time.
---
When i play killer it depends on the match. If it was a good, fun, nontoxic person thats last left, ill let em go. If they were a toxic asshole, i usually go for kill or sacrifice if i dont bring a mori
---
Would be even better if you didnt have to be healthy to use it
---
Yeah beating toxic survivors is the best feeling
---
Nah. Based on the sound cue at the start of the video, Blood Warden would have countered this (and made the video that much more spicy)
---
If on ps4, all the dlc is on sale
---
Two days ago I popped the final two gens while Dumb and Dumber were out twiddlefucking around with a trapper. They both got knocked and hooked, but I saved the both of them and opened a gate. One of them got sacrificed on the way out, and the other knocked, but not killed. The killer was framing bp and kinda camping their general area so I said whatev and left. Not 30 seconds after the game ended I get a message "Thanks for the help smh."
---
Its posts like this that make you chuckle when you remember being a noob at least one point in the game everyone has so dont give me the bs (the toxic trash survivor mains), we all been there before
---
Kate cosplay as Nea
---
This PTB you nimrod. I specifically stated bugs in this PTB. Wake up bug made it to live. And guess what? Got patched shortly after. You guys are all for shitting on the game you claim to love so much but the moment theres positivity for them you love to shit on their heads.
---
I used to run fun builds until I kept coming across killers that just brought out the nasty shit because they think any 4 people loading in at a relatively close time is a 'tryhard swf group gonna bm me!!!!!11'. It made the games so unfun that I just put on the meta shit anyway because otherwise you can't play long enough to not just get mori'd off first hook after they ensure they tunnel the fuck out of you. Like, gg guys, you're creating the monsters you whine about.
---
Pretty sure it doesn't it's just random if you get it or not like I still haven't gotten spirit Fury tier 1 on any killers but that's a yellow(uncommon) perk
---
I wouldn't say devotion 1 I would make a casual mode you have to reach level 50 for the ranked mode which is basically this horrible ranking system but you can actually lose rank past 15
---
I say this is a successful shitpost.
---
If you want to be a dick you could play hag and just place traps often until the deviance category( I think that‚Äôs the one) is full then just try to win the game and rock a bloodpoint boosting sacrifice with like ruin , haunted grounds and bbq
---
Trapper watched to much anime
---
Oh cool time for another one of these comment sections
---
Holy shit OP I adore your stuff thank you for blessing us with all this super neat OC
---
ACKCHYUALLY there are 23 pairs of chromosomes in humans amounting to 46 total.
---
Jeff was an absolute buffoon shouldve gotten way closer to the gates instead of Teabagging
---
clearly 300 iq
---
Alright I'm her fiancee so obviously I'm biased as shit but what the literal fuck are you talking about. She is always red or purple and occasionally the threshold of purple/green. I think she made a new account like 3 months ago because she ranked up too fast and couldn't even fine games, and even then she was out of those ranks in like 2 hours.
---
Like Jesus Christ she can be a bitch sometimes but you people straight up lie about her and its infuriating. She hasnt even streamed DBD in over a month because all of this shit makes her depressed.
---
Why so tilted?
---
Well deserved
---
Just set messages to friends only, silly
---
Jeff =/= Einstein
---
A really cool feature would be to give the username and date of use for any taken item
---
Yeah he's watered down Myers
---
Hey, newish to the game! Could someone clarify the meaning of "SWF" for me?
---
Just did that with Nurse.
---
Okay, in that case.. do not use that perk until it is tier 3. The information it gives is just way too vague at 1 and 2. Enduring is fine, but brutal is a bit better on trapper. I'm sure you've read enough suggestions to level the other killers until you have all teachables anyways ;p
---
I love you
---
Quentin only exists in the remake
---
Its so annoying when the crappy matchmaking system gives you rank 20s when you're rank 6 and gives you a rank 1 hag then the survivors just activate all her shi*üò†üò†üò†üò†üò†

I'm sorry but I disagree. I mean obviously Trapper was inspired by Jason a little bit (hell I'm actually using skins to make my Trapper look more like Jason), but bear traps definitely aren't Jason's main weapon. Also we have Leatherface and Hillbilly as OP said, which are much more similiar than Trapper and Jason. I think they could definitely find a proper power for Jason to make him completely different from Trapper, maybe they would be both using similiar weapons but that's it.
---
Also Clown from DBD is completely different from Pennywise, I mean if you know it's lore you know Pennywise is extremely powerful entity and not just some random clown. If they would add Pennywise to DBD I'm 100% sure it would work completely different than the Clown we have.
---
Ok good. How many types there are? On these pairs can exist an odd mutation having then xxy chromosome? That's what I meant. Not the total number of them my dude
---
Take my damn upvote and get out
---
Game is so casual! But in order to get any perks you need to grind like a Chinese sweatshop. Still tired casual.
---
Implying ttv= strong opponent.
---
Done with your soapbox?
---
Random, but with new blood web coming out next Tuesday it'll be allot faster to get the Perks.
---
If I get rank 1 with a killer I‚Äôll still have game knowledge that rank 20s won‚Äôt even if I play a different killer. No reason to make games miserable for new players
---
I said it isn't fun. There will be a kill. But what would you rather want to happen? The killer getting 3 kills because you try to unhook the survivor and give the killer what he wants or let 1 person die and let 3 survivors escape?
---
I think I'll try that combo lol
---
Twas alotta fun for the contest, glad to see the honorable mentions showing some that didnt win but acknowledged the work put in very nice event
---
Why would they nerf camraderie? Its one of the worst perks to be added in a while
---
Solid work, anjoyed it quite a bit. Btw, what language do you speak in on the non english bits?
---
Goddamn lawsuits.
---
I'm on PC but I bet the DLCs will be on sale soon.
---
It used to, but then they made the change that disabled the common/ultra-rare perks. 
---
It should be completely random now. However the rarity of the perk stills affects it in a very minor manner.
---
A bloodweb after about level 45 typically looks something like this:
---
* 6-11 Commons Nodes
---
* 6-11 Uncommon nodes (these seem to fight with the common ones so the commons you have, the less uncommons and vice-versa)
---
* 6 Rare nodes (rarely 5)
---
* 3 Very Rare nodes (rarely 2 or 4)
---
* 0-1 Ultra rare nodes
---
A perk will obviously take up one of the nodes of its rarity. But the rarity of the perk itself shouldn't stop them from spawning since they get priority. The bloodweb generation right now i is "Ok, here's perk 1 and perk 2, lets put them in a corresponding node" and NOT "Ok, here's Perk 1 but there's no room for Perk 2's rarity so we'll pick a different one)
---
It'll be interesting to see when the upcoming Bloodweb change hits how the web will  handle 4 perks. Will it be altered to spawn 3 purple perks and then a Yellow or Green one if possible? Only time will tell.
---
Just checked and can't find it there, can you send me a link?
---
Will you do Legion any time soon? (I know you're going to illustrate them all but I just wanna know when you're gonna do my main :D)
---
Simple punish campers. That is all
---
Honestly I bet at some point they might add shaggy Velma Fred and daphine with no killer with shaggy being like meg (because of the ‚Äúboost‚Äù they get when they see the villain in the tv show) Velma with like a research type perk, daphine with something like urban evasion and Fred with some teamwork perk
---
He let go of the switch for a second to avoid that and just get hit instead. It was well played on David's side. :)
---
Holy shit that is fantastic!! I always look forward to your excellent drawings.
---
Not knowing where the loops are doesn't make it a bad survivor map then, that's a you problem.
---
Credits to my girlfriend cherry
---
oops! Nice catch lol didn't see the username and flair before I commented. I will leave this thread here as a sorry reminder for those that have yet to feed the trolls.
---
I just havent played in so long because of the crappy servers continuously kicking me and its not my wifi i have a $300 wifif router just for my consoles and pc so the fact that its only for this game says its the servers
---
Because its the truth. Nobody ever has respect for anything these devs do for us. Yet they are the same people that claim they truly love the game. If you truly loved the game you'd have decency to at least be grateful they did a much requested and wanted chapter for you guys. You could accept the fact they make mistakes and just accept the fact they have gotten onto fixing things quicker now. No games perfect. Ain't possible.
---
Kinda offtopic but when I see this picture I have to say Silent Hill is still to this day the best movie adaption of a video game. In my opinion of course.
---
Also of course I'd like to see Pyramid Head in DBD but sadly Konami is well, Konami. Yes I'm still fucking pissed at them for cancelling Silent Hills.

I fuckin love it OP 10/10

YOU CAN JOIN A GROUP WHERE PEOPLE TALK LIKE BABY BOOMERS ON FACEBOOK AND DO IT TO YOUR HEART‚ÄôS CONTENT. YOU CAN ALSO MISSPELL WHATEVER YOU WANT AND SAY GOD BLESS
---
Yes it gives you an idea of who you can rely on
---
Had a game last night where I looped the killer for 5 gens, and let the door get opened. I lost the killer, made it to the door, but was injured. Teammates started to heal me, but wouldn't stop when the killer showed up. I got hit before I was fully healed. Teammates left, and I got hooked. I was salty.
---
This so awesome. I‚Äôm not a big fan of the Scream franchise either but I genuinely love this art. Great job!
---
no.
---
If you want I can go on and also destroy each of your points apart if you'd like :)
---
haha I was just about to ping you on your comment on the doctor thread!
---
*NANI?!*
---
IT IS BEING FIXED IN PTB LET US HOPE IT GOES LIVE
---
Had a guy talk shit to me for doing bad as huntress, so I switch to omega nurse with mor√≠ and they dodged me twice. Guess they knew :)
---
I actually think I'm probably gonna be an asshole about legion and do him/them last haha - I really want the design to be great as they're by far the most requested. But who knows, if inspiration strikes hard enough, I never ignore it. 
---
But yeah, DEFINITELY going to happen eventually

---
I got no problem going against SWF. I just really hate when they win and act like it was skill when time is literally against me
---
If you make it work you absolute madman you have all of my respect.
---
If anyone dc's the other players should all just black pip.
---
&gt;?Alright I'm her fiancee so obviously I'm biased as shit
---
Well at least you admit it.
---
&gt;She is always red or purple and occasionally the threshold of purple/green
---
Except when she's not, which is what this is about
---
&gt;I think she made a new account like 3 months ago because she ranked up too fast and couldn't even fine games, and even then she was out of those ranks in like 2 hours
---
I mean, if you want to defend seal clubbing grey/yellow/green ranks go ahead. Making a new account seems to the new hotness, but it still reeks of the old problem of "Someone with thousands upon thousands of hours preying on weaker players". It's pretty shitty when anyone does it, and it seems like that's the route more people are taking which is a damn travesty. In Jen's case I tuned into a game where she's was stomping this rank 20 wraith with 1 perk while she was playing with one of her friends, trash talked him during the entire game like he should be playing like a pro, and then keep talking shit when he inevitably lost. So congrats to her for completely stomping grey ranks. When Ochido did it he was (rightfully) crucified by the community. Don't know why Jen gets a free pass considering they both were doing it for content creation.  As a side note, I'm going make a bold prediction here, once the Dedicated Servers go live, and MLGA becomes useless, I betcha a pretty penny she'll have no problems finding games when all those blocked players suddenly are re-entered into the player pool for her.
---
&gt;but you people straight up lie about her 
---
Hard to lie about someone when they provide video evidence of themselves for 5-8 hours at a time. 
---
&gt;She hasnt even streamed DBD in over a month because all of this shit makes her depressed.
---
She hasn't streamed DbD because WoW Classic is the new hotness, and more power to her making that work.  But for how often everyone in your little clique of friends constantly shit talks both reddit and anyone just in general not approved by the Twitter circle jerk, I find it damn hard to believe she gives two shits what goes on here. 
---
Why is it so hard for both of you to just come out and tell the truth about things? You both constantly just lie and try to make yourselves look better. Look at Pug? I don't even give him a fraction of the shit that I give your group. And I fucking hate his stream just as much as anyone elses. But I can at least respect that he makes it blatantly obvious his stream is all about being the biggest dick bag he can be in-game.  Meanwhile I watch your Stream or Jen's stream and all I see is a constant barrage of passive aggressive bullshit and sarcasm, while turning around on a dime and claiming that you have the most wonderful, non-toxic community in all of Twitch. Until someone dares disagree with you then it's time to unleash the Twitter and Discord hordes on a person as you make them an acceptable target.  And with the recent kerfuffle over Hexy (and jesus I hate to use him as a reference for anything but again, to each their own), it's pretty obvious that the Fog Whisperer discord contributes to this, with streamers going directly to BHVR to try and get people punished over every little thing.
---
There's a reason I think you and your friend circle are poisonous to this game's long term health, and this is just part of it.
---
I cant bring myself to leave someone behind.
---
Imagine doing g so and seeing them at the campfire again, I cant handle that level of awkward.
---
So, if we go down, we go down together.
---
Me and my buddies usually play as a whole blendette squad, one is gen/totem jockey, one is hook save/medic and gen support (me), and the other 2 take turns looping and blinding. As soon as one gets hit they loose the killer and I run over for quick heals while the other takes his turn looping, so we go the whole game with almost no hooks.
---
Urban Evasion on David?
---
Unfortunately your comment has been deemed as too long for /u/KateMainBigBrain to even bother reading it.
---
This comment was written and posted by a bot.
---
Bro, sprint away.
---
Its just fun, from the killers side i have calming hag and wraith games to legion games where im trying my best to at least get a 2k with the crap perks i have currrently
---
And then as a survivor I'm jittery and focused, thinking every moving thing is a killer or that the ghostface is definitely around that corner so i better stare at it. 
---
Progression is an ass, unless you play with at least one perk/add on that gives you bp it takes you a long time to get stuff from the web
---
Bubba did what we call a "pro gamer move"
---
Holy fuck you really cant get closer to that.  I would let you walk out after that second hit and just nod. Good shit yo.
---
Yeey
---
Should start when dlc drops on 17th
---
NOT FUNNY
---
DIDN'T LAUGH!
---
When I see a bad play, I call out a bad play. That goes for you, for me, the Dwight in the closet, the Jake sabotaging the hook, the Claudette standing in a corner/bush, the Meg who ‚Äúis doing gens, you?‚Äù, the Nea who fails every skill check, the Bill that farms, the non-shirtless David, the shirtless David, the Jeff who DCs for some reason, the Laurie who sucks at chases, the Ace running Up the Ante, the Feng who tries to be Claudette and Meg, the Quentin being Quentin, the Tapp who seems to always vault at the wrong time, the Kate who isn‚Äôt thicc, the Adam with the white coat, the Jane who isn‚Äôt dummy thicc, and the Steve who tries to be an upgraded Quentin.
---
No one is safe from a bad play being called out
---
I think this totem was patched in the PTB.
---
Moonwalking to let the timer go was situational, youd have to walk backwards and rely only on blood drops. I never did that because it basically wasted your time
---
Doing gens. You?
---
Okay, show me her in brown ranks any time in the past year other than the time she made a new account to rush to red ranks a few months ago. Show me it once.
---
Glad you like it! I wanted something that thematically felt like you were investigating and looking for clues (since that's basically Velma's entire character. Scooby Doo may be a masterpiece, but it doesn't have complex characters in the slightest).
---
I'm a little iffy on the actual perks I made accompany the clue mechanic, since I feel like they're not necessarily the best fits, but I think the Clue mechanic itself is solid.
---
They can fix it by making him a tall killer with larger arms (like Myers, Huntress, Plague...)
---
That would just lead to unbalanced games.
---
My suggestion would to have the ranking system go from 25 to 1 and have every 5-7 ranks que together and have rank reset only once every 2-3 months.
---
What's better together?
---
How come Shirtless Myers goes through then?
---
He does that anyway. I learned ALOT just by watching a few matches because he explained every single thing he did and why. It improved my looping significantly along with certain perks. I've never seen anyone like him and never learned so much.
---
If he's on coke, he hides it well and rarely does lines. He only has a break every hour to two so his high would fade quite quickly and noticeably come down.
---
So you're an asshole who has to get validation by bullying someone less experienced than you?
---
"Its a suboptimal strategy that costs you bloodpoints and completely ruins the game for another player."
---
Ftfy. Lets remember that youre in a power role, and can completely fuck the survivor out of everything if you wanted. People who facecamp, dont consistently play both sides, I think.
---
Got what he deserved.
---
Damn, this makes pig sound useless.
---
That would so promote just jacking items tho lol (sounds cool though)
---
MSU? Is that Wells Hall in the back?
---
I see what you did there... make IT happen \*budum tish\*
---
When a survivor is dropped, a portion of the wiggle bar is given to survivor, i would say a little less than a quarter of the wiggle bar, so if the survivor is mostly wiggled out already and the killer wants to drop them, that portion will fill the rest of the bar and the survivor will jump of their shoulder.
---
If you are speaking about decisive that's different and i'm assuming that's not what you're talking about
---
do you even know who we are talking about? Lmao guys I found the non noob3 fan lmao
---
lol i would have liked to see the actual guy
---
Can't wait for every survivor who gets caught first to kill themselves on-hook while im running towards them because they think it takes to long.
---
This reminds me of the charms from Hollow Knight.
---
Slugging is a strategy and a very risky one since if you fuck up you lose your momentum
---
Welp, was a stereotype like that guy used too, but even if you bring jump scare Myers ppl will cry about it
---
I know it about mori. I explained that too.. people still cry about it
---
I also know about hexes but people still cry about it. I know I sound repetitive but just look at Reddit posts and you'll see these things a lot
---
Yeah, I think about it too about bodyblock. It's just a free hit for killer
---
Spirit fury is pretty good to make m1 killers somewhat relevant. Still, look it up on posts or how OhTofu cryied about it calling it an unfair perk making a video about it
---
There's also the fact that the killer was coming towards him, hit him, and he continuously opened the gate which was timed perfectly. It was an outplay because he was smarter than the killer in this situation. Just because you swing at the sight of a survivor and miss doesn't mean dead hard is op you braindead fuckstick
---
&gt;nobody says that
---
[Here is a thread from literally just an hour ago that says, exactly, just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d3stlm/_/)
---
Given you lied about that i see no reason to entertain the other ones as you just like to spew a million lies and waste everyone's time.
---
Now, I backed up one of my claims, now you back up yours. How about "you have to leave the hook with 0.1 seconds or it's toxic". You can respond when you find an example where someone literally says you have 0.1 seconds to leave or you're camping
---
Well I guess my rank reset so far behind my fuckin hard drive died
---
Simple mechanics with a high skill curve coupled with in depth progression for players who are looking to get better. Consistent releases of licensed properties, and even more consistent releases of original properties. The ability to play with friends and have interactions with randoms allows you to have unique experiences each time you play. Many things coupled together to form the perfect storm of success that allowed this game to stay afloat despite its rough patches.
---
Looping is balanced till its ironworks of infinites, suffocation pit, cowshed, or wretched shop. That shit ain't fun at all to go against.
---
Fakeüòò
---
Jason is pretty much the only licensed killer I'd like in dbd. But with this whole lawsuit thing it looks like it won't happen (I hope it does though)
---
MYERS! YES! (or Pig, either one of these would be fantastic) BUT MYERS!
---
Yeah pretty much. It's just as uncool of the red/purple ranks knowingly getting a lower rank killer because they're deliberately going in as SWF wtih their low rank friends because they can't legitimately hack it at true red/purple ranks.
---
made with mematic
---
\&gt;rank 20 teammates  
---
\&gt;rank 1 hag  
---
Yeah, something tells me this didn't actually happen, outside of that one week or two back before summer when they tried making the matchmaking more lenient in exchange for faster queue times.
---
This is both awesome and sad because its true lol
---
They get punished...
---
Was just a joke but ok
---
All I can think is the sonic themes song *"Gotta go fast"*
---
Why yes it is
---
I love using unnerving, overcharge, distressing,BBQ. But if they have tool boxes ect.. I'll use overwhelming presence to replace BBQ. And I do it only as the Dr lol people get so pissed off by that build. Lol
---
I fucking love this. Amazing artwork
---
Show me that it happened.
---
When it's a good killer, not really. If it's a baby killer, yeah, sometimes I cry a little.
---
I don't know why the hell you people expect a 1-to-1 adapation of these killers. Newsflash, Freddy doesn't actually use Dream Pallets in the NOES movies. 
---
It's a game. They take liberties.
---
Jesus Christ this is awesome.  Once you get a Plague one done I know what my new wallpaper will be
---
&gt;If her being in brown ranks for 7 hours out of the past year is seriously all you've got that doesn't sound like much.
---
I mean, her also streaming it was also part of the point that you're ignoring. I hated it way back in the day when I believe Marth did the "Rank 20 to 1" challenge, and I still hate it today. Seal-clubbing is just such an unbelievable shitty thing to do because it's completely warping those games it occurs. 
---
And if I have to go back to this point, I will. For her to waffle-stomp around in green ranks is still just as bad, the only silver lining is sometimes, there will be players who are up to her skill level.  Here, quick and dirty MSPaint visual since this goes back to the whole "RaNk dOeSn'T mAtTeR" bullshit we went through awhile ago. This is something I've had a major problem with for awhile now. And you and Jen both play it off like it's nothing.
---
https://imgur.com/a/15Rch0t
---
So while we both are aware matchmaking is incredibly fucked right now, for the most part it works like something I've attached. So when I say the following, I'm operating out of the assumption that the duct tape holding together BHVR's matchmaking sticks and things are in a normal-ish state.
---
People generally stay in their own little circle, overlapping a little bit with the next tier up/down and sometimes even a tier past that. So Greys should mostly play with greys, a healthy mix of yellows, and the occasional green. Red rank players are the exact opposite, mainly playing with other red rank players, a dose of purples, and again, the occasional green. 
---
Here's my problem when someone who should be in red ranks decides it's okay to derank to green for whatever reason. You're suddenly diluting the pool of players who should actually provide a challenge to you with flood of other players who range to pure potatoes. Being in green ranks means you get to potentially dip into all the ranking pools, most often to your favor. If you happen to get a red rank killer, oh well, business as usual. But if you get a genuine yellow rank or fresh faced green ranked killer? Oh boy, now you're in business to make someone's life hell. 
---
And I can already hear it now, hell you even did a disingenuous video on it. "RED RANK DOESN'T MEAN SKILL". Well no shit, people have off games, not everyone is going to play 100% every single game. And if they do? Well hell, you'll just make fun of them for being a sweaty try hard right? (which is another topic entirely so I'll stay on track here). The point is, there's a reason BHVR (generally) doesn't match Red ranks with yelllows regularly. Because it'd be stupidly unfun for one side. And yet deranking to Green means that'll occur more often than not.  And this goes for both killers and survivors. No one should be cheesing the rank system for easier games because they find them more full of "LUL" moments. 
---
Jen could easily find games in purple ranks, or even red ranks. But we have to be honest, her choice when she wants to stream is obviously going to impact who else is awake and playing the game. I'm against 'subsidizing' her content creation at the expense of sub-100 hour players because she wants to stream at lower player hours. It's not fair to those players and it only encourages shitty behavior in the rest of the playerbase. And even you can't deny there are TONS of people are there who believe in "Well if Jen gets to derank and not get punished for it, so can I. I mean, she's a Fog Whisperer so it HAS to be okay right" Which wraps around to the point of arguing of specifics of "It's only punishible if you d/c a certain %" which complete side steps the discussion of whether the act itself is bad for the game.
---
I know you're smarter than this Scott, but you're so quick to dismiss anything remotely critical of you, your fiancee or your friends that it's easier to go "LUL REDDIT" than have a real discussion on the matter.
---
Gas gas gas intensifies
---
A little. Depends on who I'm playing against though. If we're already winning, I'll tend to use the window once and then run to a different area because there's no need to buy that much time.
---
&gt;Given you lied about that i see no reason to entertain the other ones as you just like to spew a million lies and waste everyone's time.
---
Hahaha you're an idiot. I lied, lie which means a malicious intent which wasn't. Second, the guy, literally under the post said sorry after someone pointed that out. You're so disingenuous
---
&gt;Alright now it's your turn, please supply a source for "you have to leave the hook with 0.1 seconds or it's toxic". You can respond when you find an example where someone literally says you have 0.1 seconds to leave or you're camping.
---
You can't? That's what I thought.
---
Haha again being disingenuous. You know what an hyperbole is? Is what you used in your original post too, dumbass. God damn it how can you even dress up all by yourself..
---
Then if we are taking hyperbole seriously, where your example of being camped or hooked if you work on a gen close to the killer? See? It's easy taking an hyperbole and twist it like that
---
&gt;So get off your soapbox, accept there are flaws with players on both sides, and Google what "parody" means so you don't get your panties in a bundle over a joke again
---
I accept that but you, like many, posts just about one side and shit on that. I know what a parody is you disingenuous prick, you're the kind of guy who back paddles so fking hard when got shit on.
---
Plus isn't a parody but in hyperbole based on stereotypes, you can't even describe what you did, my God.
---
You said just one thing right, let's stop. It's pointless waste time with someone so disingenuous and dumb like you. Please, next time at least try to have an argument since what I listed are hyperbole of posts I see often here while yours are just taken out of your ass, where your brain is presumably
---
*cries in my main killer*
---
I don't know what server y'all were playing on but thank God I'm not part of it. I would have had a whole heart attack at that moment.
---
It‚Äôs hard to make a meme without people thinking I‚Äôm a salty survivor or killer
---
I got it in my first match, I was against rank 19s and 20s who probably had no clue what was happening :‚Äô(
---
Is it Decisive Strike by any chance? That gives the survivor a skill check right after you pick them up which causes the killer to drop the survivor into the injured state and get stunned.
---
&gt; I main Meg Thomas and haven't been able to upgrade any of her perks (I'm  a level 45 with her and still haven't found any of them to upgrade). Am  I doing something wrong, or just getting really unlucky? 
---
I'd be pretty confident in sayting that it's a glitch, unless you have every survivor's unlockables and hence it is taking forever to find the perks, which I assume isn't the case. When I was levelling my Wraith, it would force me to level up each perk to the third pip before it would show a different perk. There are a few known "patterns" which would occur in the bloodweb perks which would cause the perks shown to not be completely random. You could just be getting really unlucky, but you aren't doing anything wrong since the bloodweb comes down to RNG.
---
yeah its ridiculous
---
its kind of like how Dstrike has been nerfed a ton yet killer mains still complain about it because it punishes them for tunneling (it also punishes survivors for being good in chases since they will never have it go off)
---
I know this is a meme but oh my god that first cat is so darn cute
---
Are you playing with your PS on your mac?
---
Oooh, that‚Äôs a great idea and works perfectly with his character!
---
Ahh Holloween, the annual tradition of remembering Kevin Bacon' masterpiece [Hollow Man](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0164052/).
---
Also Hollow Man Chapter when BHVR?!?!?!
---
Omg that actually wasnt intentional
---
That match was boosted. I'm genuinely suprised to say that the Blendette actually did everything that game.
---
We are not hating on noob3 we are hating on the guy that let noob3 die in a video and then lied and said ‚Äúdoing gens you?‚Äù And said you going to cry about it?
---
I‚Äôm not saying it wasn‚Äôt but Freddy got maximum lung distance trying to stop him when he could just pull him off
---
That is really well done!
---
I had a screenshot of it on my xbox account but low storage means i have to delete post you take it this was almost 2 years ago it happened just because someones comments about something that happened doesnt mean it was recent one word of advice never assume unless you have absolutely no idea what youre talking about
---
**I Have A Plan** is crazy strong, and I don't think it would be good for the game to have a perk that restores pallets. You could use it to restore the god pallet 3 times. That's kind of insane.
---
Gonna want jon-tron as the survivor.
---
Yes but i mostly feel gross about BHVR not fixing those after 3 years. Its not like they don't know about it.
---
The loops OP is talking about, the main difference between a good and a bad killer is the good one will go for someone else lol
---
(unless the killer has the right special ability such as blinks to counter infinites).
---
I guess they're like an old boy band that never broke up lol.
---
oh cool i also use remote play mate
---
The first time i tried it, it was on the spirit's map and it was actually hell on earth. Not a single hook or hit. Second time I did it, similar thing happened but in end game collapse I was almost full and a Claudette was tbagging me waiting for me to hit her out. I popped it, grabbed her, and got her. I then did it to the meg who came running and she disconnected like a baby that close to getting her points. The messages from that claudette were hysterical saying that I use op add ons thats the only way I win while I got probably 9k points and depiped.
---
&gt;"this was almost 2 years ago"  
---
So it isn't at all recent, and the matchmaking has since 2 years ago been reworked plenty of times to work better, which I would argue that it absolutely does.  
---
Therefore, I can safely say that your entire point is literally irrelevant to the current build of the game. It's your word against your word.  
---
I'm glad we got that out of the way. Have a good rest of your day, friend.
---
I'm going to babysit you
---
oof
---
No problem
---
I honestly tried. I was surrounded by teammates and when I went to sprint away I couldn't move. Then they all ran, and I got slapped.
---
Big facts
---
Survivors dont realise how shit the build is, not conventional whatsoever
---
Potato matches all around!!!
---
We already have one. He's called The Wraith.
---
But no seriously, the movie was terrible. One of Kevin Bacon's worst movies. Also there's not much to go on for a chapter or even a paragraph. Just an invisible man. That's it and like I said, The Wraith can already do that.
---
A shapeshifting killer that could actually work this is beautiful
---
technically they have been alive for 40 years, however after the entity is like *SUCC* they dont age physically, so yh
---
its also just not good for your bp...
---
No. The idea is that they are strong because you can disable them.
---
Then they say ggez with only 5k points in survival.
---
So you can't respond to what I said so you rely on this weak bs? Okay, whatever makes you feel better with yourself
---
new Demogorgon perk called Cruel Limits (Formerly Cruel Confinement in development stages*)*
---
Lol ok. You literally just went out to insult and try to guess my rank (which is usually red ranks sadly) and my skill. You can't compare a fucking streamer with a non-streamer gamer because I don't play it for work. I can't just dedicate 7k hours of my life and give up all the other many good games I have, because this game stupidly favours swf and makes games impossible to win for like 98% of the killer community. 
---
Oh and I main Pig/Spirit so yeah, I'm far from being a bad killer. You can't just expect me to win against 4 god tier survivors with comms and meta builds
---
Anyone else feel like that if they got Pennywise, they'd need to have him voiced?
---
I think the best solution is to have all hiding spots be decent, such as in the new baham map. I mean they don't know to be perfectly hidden but some of the spots in the old maps are literally in the wide open its ridiculous.
---
I like how they just took Pukey the Clown Bloat from Killing Floor and put it as the icon.
---
This is so amazing! I recently wanted to start doing a DBD series as well, and seeing yours gives me lots of inspiration!
---
I've seen it and to be fair, I want to go ahead and guess a majority of red rank survivors aren't the best at looping since they don't need to be. Most are gen rushers who run detection perks, or are in a swf with a designated looper that they can pick up if he goes down. It's impressive to hit red ranks as a survivor, but it's not entirely skillful, either.
---
Ahh my bad. That was a good video but also fuck that claudette
---
Not necessarily. All characters are sort of from different timelines. Steve and Nancy are from the 80s' but they're here, technically, with your thinking that makes them 50+.
---
You're having a tantrum and I'm not going to entertain that
---
By MSU do you mean Montana State University, or Michigan State University?
---
It would be cool for her to get a skin where she isn‚Äôt infected with the Plague but again, that is part of her character.
---
West EU matches offer both the greatest tryhards and the most crybabies you can have. Survivors and killers equally
---
Michigan State Haha
---
Ok, I upvoted for the first paragraph then I saw the rubbish at the bottom. Hollowman was great! I watched it a lot in my childhood, if you don't like it that's fine but I can't handle this trash talk.
---
Aye, fellow Spartan DBD player! Go green baby!
---
Dude, I can easily tell youre a pre-teen the fact that you criticize everything you havent had happened to you along with pretty much saying youre right when its literally an event that happened to ME, dude if your life is just correcting peoples story of their experience please make sure that you never get a job where you work with others, youre gonna get your teeth knocked out
---
GO WHITE!
---
yea thats what i was thinking, and i know it doesn‚Äôt make sense, but we could get servant adiris but shes infected, i think it would be cool if we also got a fully infected plague
---
I forgot what video that was, link?
---
13th
---
Each of us have our own opinions. Calling mine trash just because you disagree is kinda small minded.
---
yikes
---
I feel bad when i use them.
---
Survivors going against me flick their flashlights at me to try to make run the infinites. 
---
soooooooooooo i guess that just makes me a good person
---
I don't disagree, it's probably too much. It almost definitely needs a couple limitations on it such as "can't repair the same pallet twice" (that way especially, you can't have everyone runs the perk they can only repair the same pallet once instead of 12 times. Ugh the idea of the god pallet being repaired 12 times is awful). Repaired pallets should probably also be faster to break, and there should be some other downsides.
---
I still think the idea is sound, but you're right in that the implementation I gave is just asking for trouble without limitation.
---
Clown meme template https://imgur.com/gallery/qmMkp1m
---
"You braindead fusktick", that has to be one of the most interesting things I've seen on Reddit
---
Thanks it's pretty fun writing them do you have any ideas on the fear radius measurements or do you think +8 is good
---
hitting at the gate or grabing them also gives points, so its not only fun
---
And freddy is a joke either, if you didn't notice, sorry to disappoint you. His godlike powers in the dreams are not shown at all. In game he is only able to create illusions of pallets, while in films he was able to make any fear come true and attack his victims where the are the most vulnerable. 
---
"They take liberties" this why i don't want to see another horror icon turned into voiceless scarecrow to run around pallets. Freddy used to be more talkative, you know. In DbD he is just a shadow of his former self
---
Not 50/50, but 1 in 5.
---
Really popular Netflix show, its honestly worth a watch
---
ahh my main killer and the new best boi! &lt;3 looks great!
---
Technically they don't age whilst they're in the entity's realm they're stuck in a timeless loop
---
So you would basically be stuck at the age that you entered the realm.
---
It's why the huntress and the plague aren't practical skeletons by now.
---
Frank is still 19
---
Susie is around 15/16
---
Julie is about 17 or 18
---
Joey is unknown but it's to be assumed that he's between 17 to 19 but still younger than Frank
---
That could be like an ultra rare item that brings it down to like +4 or even 0 for true stealth builds
---
&gt;  Let's go bully some baby killers", then tend to rage quit out of sheer embarrassment/frustration if they fuck up a loop/juke or a save, or do something dumb that gets them caught first.
---
Or more likely, they decide the "baby killer" isn't baby enough, and want to derank even more...
---
i remember when "dribbling" before DS was the thing.. never knew they changed it until now lol
---
&gt;I'm totally calm
---
Also you:
---
&gt;You disingenuous prick
---
&gt;You're the kind of guy who back paddles so fking hard when got shit on
---
&gt; It's pointless waste time with someone so disingenuous and dumb like you
---
&gt;[Your opinion is] taken out of your ass, where your brain is presumably
---
Yeah that seems fair i like ultra rares that change the power a little or even alot
---
FUNGOOSE LULLLL.
---
Dudes an absolute PoS. Arrogant af, most people in OCE (servers are small) who have played for a long time know him and dislike him.
---
His content is informative, but when you know him as a person it completely negates any semi good content he does have. There's MUCH more informative/good personality players out there to choose from, ohtofu, zubat etc. 
---
If you critique him or his personality at all he just labels you 'toxic' or what have you.
---
There's also a video of him throwing his cat on stream, he's apologised for it but still meme af material.
---
The issue isn't the players, its the devs. They're the ones that implemented something as dumb as an ebony mori. I can't blame people for actually using it. But i wish they would listen to the community. Nobody in their right mind thinks an ebony mori is a fun and balanced concept.
---
Yeah, just noticed that after getting stunned right after i grabbed a guy, its really nice that they have changed that
---
Omg, rin looks cute
---
Yea that makes more sense and I like the two cut add ons so he would have a smaller radius but build fear slower or have a bigger one but build it faster
---
WOAH, he didn't say DH was op
---
Still the combination of both made matchmaking  horrendous meaning they probably won't do it
---
As an oce player it makes me cringe hard af when I see people complimenting him. Most of his viewers are from overseas, he sucks ass oce
---
Yeah gives points of course. Enough to make it worth it if it‚Äôs not fun? No. I stand by my orig I always statement that the points are heavily outweighed so yes for just fun.
---
Yeah those would be great add ons you're really good at the whole concept making
---
Plag*
---
"The truth is the game was rigged from the start" Trapper says as he hooks you and picks up and puts down traps over and over again.
---
what if I play both pretty equally?
---
Thanks it's pretty fun making something interesting to go against and fun to play cause with the fear survivors are more encouraged to fight him in a sense and still having options if not
---
Just fyi you might wanna chnage the phones you had...those are too pld for when the movie came out. Flip phones and nokia phones where a huge thing in the 90's
---
Good one.
---
Thank you! I do have friends that actually made me buy the game, and i dont regret a single penny i payed because the game is so awesome!
---
Im totally in love with this game and will try to ignore the toxicity as much as i can as you said!
---
Again, really thank you!
---
I'm an OCE player. Can confirm he DC's against multiple people I know. OCE sever is small and virtually all 'good' players who have been around for a while can't stand him.
---
If you critique him at all he just calls you 'toxic'. I love the video of him throwing his cat on stream too lmfao
---
oops sorry dyslexia
---
Yeah you should let me know if you make anymore concepts I'd love to have a good read
---
*Cries in wake up*
---
You will never reach the fog.
---
I had some sweaty team with a weak link tell me I was expoliting and cheating for following around a baby meg for 2 gens but got practically every pallet on the game done. Needless to say the 4k was swift and the salt was immeasurable.
---
Well, what are you waiting for? Your spine chill doesnt flash so go repair it!
---
I'll try I might make posts with reworks or ideas if I get bored
---
Steve! He's my favorite of the two. C'mon, you can't beat the Scoops outfit!
---
This phrase triggers me.
---
Well, it is pretty easily countered. If you're at a loop, and she crouches, leave the loop. Pig players almost always expect you to try and stay, so they likely won't catch up to you before you reach another loop.
---
THats what that toxic shit deserves
---
TBH, it doesn‚Äôt exactly have competition.
---
Friday 13th is not as high population as this but it wont die. The game has features DbD doesnt have. DbD is fun for a quick horror arcade game and F13 is slow paced more movie themed horror game
---
Is Tru3 really that bad? I watch him quite a bit, mostly because he is the only good player on when I can watch, but its always without sound.
---
They lose wiggle progress very very slowly on the ground. But dropping them adds to the bar So if the bar was halfway and you dropped them, you‚Äôd have to wait like 2 minutes before it was even at the halfway point again
---
-Play survivor.
---
-Hold action button.
---
-Hit skill checks.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Then complain about lullaby. It's a non-issue though as you're not forced to use it and you can use it with ruin.
---
Buffing all hex totems is silly.
---
&gt;You take too big of a risk to be without a perk the entire game.
---
Welcome to hexes, that's what they are - Defend them or lose your perk.
---
People be lewding susie and she's 16? Maybe they put an uno +4 on her
---
Also I like all the kills jason gets including environmental kills...already more ways to kill compared to the total of all DbD moris
---
That still makes legal age with a +4 so I'm good
---
Autoaim even fucking over console, why the fuck is it in the game
---
Come back as Tommy, shoot Jason, get one free escape, then die again. Or he just slashes you to death because he ain't got time to be stabbed.
---
Not everthing but they're litteraly blocking me in a corner, i dont know (or think they intended for this to be a thing making the game) so it's an exploit? At the very least toxic. And i'm quickly adjusting to the toxicity, i understand it's apart of the game, the main reason i posted this is because i was happy i beat these types of players.
---
Do either of them perform better than the other?
---
Lucky Web.
---
He deserved that.
---
I have to go now! My planet needs me!

Okay for sure. I watch dude almost daily, and besides OTZ and Pug he's really one of the only Dead by streamers I watch.

Never has a community come together so well to make up their own rules while simultaneously being torn apart by their own made up rules.

---
Plague gets better the worse your enemys are, 1 bad enemy and she becomes really strong.
---
Ghost face is similar to Myers. Stalking can be weird but if someone reveals you - it tells you. A lot of the time it'll show you the location of people you didn't know were there.
---
If they made it so the killers only job is to hit you 3 times and can auto mori you (no hooks in the game at all) i would play DbD a lot more but since a majority of the time you just hook mehh i was sorts disappointed i couldnt kill at will in DbD but i play it because its arcade style and quick, no stress
---
He saw a killer coming out of the bushes
---
With 2 survivors / 6 survivor perks I don't think you're going to have to worry about a shortage of survivors.
---
Also it's a lot more efficient they have the double bloodpoints come during the release of the DLC than before especially considering a lot of people stuck up before the DLC hits anyway and the double bloodpoints become pretty much useless to them
---
Calm the fuck down Jesus that's a pretty pathetic response
---
‚ÄúTunneler why didn‚Äôt you run me for 4 gens!‚Äù
---
Why killers bring ebony mori after rank reset every game when we try to play swf? Is being scared of swf's a rank 10 thing usually?
---
Why you got to Ty l do my man Nileys like this, with the bad PhotoShop. Then you try to ruin Claudette character just you encounter a few who bounce when you get hooked. Smh
---
I didn't know it was coming... I just hit rank 1 finally... Now I'm sad :(
---
haha~ yup it how it be
---
His killer ability can be the hitboxes that are in the game right now.  They'll at least look legit finally with that weappn.
---
When you hit them their hitbox goes away and you can walk through them
---
So far I've had a good day considering the rank reset. Plenty of nice survivors and killers alike.

A couple stacks of PWYF makes Bubba very dangerous in the right hands. If the obsession isn't careful, it can cause the entire team to fail.

You need to delve deeper then. There is far more interesting stuff on Reddit besides a  B Grade insult.

I get that it might be an over used joke but just ignore it this is reddit the land of reposts and over used jokes and i know suzie isn't actually 16 that's why we don't have our boi dustin and we have our boi steve

She was a baby
---
Another thread lol
---
Save the best for last.
---
No fuck you and all the snowflake killers and survivors on this game and sub
---
not sure if there's not a lot of votes just yet but it's 55/45 at the moment which actually surprises me. Might be an interesting idea to do a poll based on what platform (pc/ps4/xbox)
---
When i play on PC as survivor i find a game literally the second i click the button, on PS4 (what i mainly play) it's gonna be at least a 3-5 min wait to find a lobby, but killer is usually less than a minute or 2.
---
You know what ill just delete my comment since i get little kids like you who have nothing better to do but correct others ON THEIR POINT OF VIEWS ill just stop arguing with you because youre obviously in that kid stage were you always think your right even if its on others opinions, views, and statements of their experience your just waisting my time since you most likely havent even been playing for half a year since most people i know have had it at least once when they get into high ranks get much lower ranked teamates just keep playing kid and when it happens to you youll know what im talking about even if you need to know now watch true talent he plays everyday and he will confirm, IT HAPPENS now stop trying to correct my experiences it happened to me not you Okay
---
I wanted barb, but I like that we got 2 survivors anyway
---
They really don't
---
I don't think Inner Strength is good enough to be meta, but we'll see.
---
That‚Äôs a great idea. It gives him map pressure, chase potential, and a chance to hit other survivors since they always get a running headstart which means you can‚Äôt catch up to them so your ability runs out.
---
So if I call you out and been, let's say, spicy. It means I'm not calm?
---
Okay dude, I still think that since you cannot defend your argument but just point out that your feelings got hurt
---
Nurse for smash

Thank you for the tip, alot of people, critise others mistakes rather than help rectify them, so i appreciate this!

Before just for fun but now getting Nancy and Demo to P3.

It clearly wasn't otherwise also my comment would fall on that category if you apply that logic to it :)
---
Yeah, it's a bug in the game where it doesn't let you escape. But I knew that when you fall off the map it jumps you back in so I was going to try again but then I found hatch lmao
---
If Whispers isn't in tier 3, it's not accurate enough to be worth running. Sorry, couldn't help but notice.

amazing idea, but a lot to ask for lol

Fuck yes !! LOL

Oh yeah.
---
I'm glad it didn't.

Oh bah, 8 meters. It‚Äôs useful to know what corner of the map they‚Äôre in.

As someone who play Plague, DO you recommend cleansing? I never understood people who advocate AGAINST it, tbh..
---
Thank you, I'm glad you liked it!
---
Flawed logic.  You wouldn't get injured then stop to search for a totem afterwards.  The thought process is you would have randomly cleansed a totem beforehand during the regular course of the game and so you'd just find a locker to use the perk when you need it later.

I know nothing about the plague, to be fair. Ive only played her twice and I was terrible.
---
Yeah the distance nerf was dissapointing.
---
Good on you for running instead of butt dancing. Take my upvotes good sir
---
Headshot
---
I was actually going to play it for some content for my youtube channel, but idk... maybe ill do it next time. Lol
---
(Also, didn't know this pic uploaded because it didn't do anything to tell me it uploaded)
---
I recomend playing every single game with 800+ ping you can get
---
Most funny games you can get! And at that point the lag sometimes even helps you.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d3vzua/does_anyone_know_when_the_ps4_edition_will_get/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
She legit got scared
---
I went back
---
Green hair is only one that makes her not look ugly
---
Is it black face if it‚Äôs literally a black persons face?
---
It's on console
---
And satellite internet, holy shit. Lol
---
I'd dig it if it was more faithful to the original or even an alternate take. The reboot version is the least creepy killer in ages.
---
Will they be seperate or just one picture? Cause Joey is my boy and I would love to see what you do with him.
---
Only if they make an exhaustion perk for killers that allow them to destroy undropped pallets &gt;:)
---
I gonna need this tattooed on me
---
Those two things are not the same
---
It turns the her into an M1, that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt typically play her. But the downside is, you‚Äôre stuck being 1 hit and occasionally vomiting, which makes tracking easy. I think cleansing is worth the risk due to how short Corrupt Purge is. The range is kinda meh too
---
This doesn't match with your name.....I feel betrayed

Shit you not, I commented as I was looking for a lobby. Guess who I got to go against. Lol

If theres still 5 gens left then we search for hatch together. If theres 3 left then i close hatch and let them open the gate. If theres 1 gen left there is no deal

Good idea, ill do it next time

&gt;Dedicated servers
---
3 hours after this comment, they just announced servers are being pushed back. Fall 2019.
---
[STATUS UPDATE | DEDICATED SERVERS](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers/p1?new=1)
---
RIP
---
Wes Craven wanted Freddy to be a lanky, awkward, dorky looking thing to contrast the bigger guys, Michael and Jason.
---
Personally I love using STBFL, so I just try to ignore those fucks as much as I can. But you're right, they're usually the most toxic ones it's sometimes really hard to ignore them.
---
The game itself was part of it too. It got boring real fast after 4 hours. But boy was that first 4 hours one of the best multiplayer experiene I had.
---
u/MistarZ I wasn't fast enough this time, this worthy of a pin? lmao
---
"destroy every point you made"... he made a joke. Not a very good one but... come on, do you really need to take it that seriously?
---
"Our new goal is to release dedicated servers on all platforms during Fall 2019". Ugh.
---
Poised, Bond, Spine Chill, and Urban Evasion.
---
After all the nonsense last night I'm glad people are enjoying it :P
---
what??? do you know how hard it is to implement servers right? do you want to release these unfinished servers like now? im glad they delayed them tbh
---
&gt;I understand Prayer Bead add on is super strong but so is Scratched Mirror or Judiths Tomestone for Myers.
---
Except Prayer Beads literally has no counter play if you don't use Spine Chill.
---
A 80 dollar upgrade would fix that right?
---
Oh but like really though. Get Dan Aykroyd and/or Bill Murray to voice Venkman or Stantz as survivors and I‚Äôll never play another game again (till ghostbusters remastered comes out)
---
Probably.
---
I can think of a couple games that have similar formula as DBD. DOn't remebmer names but there is one where you play as students vs the killer trying to escape in a school and a Chinese rip off of DBD.
---
If you want to take a survivor to lets say The basement, theres specific build you need to do
---
Iron Grasp, Agitation and if you want Mad Grit for those altruistic fucks that want to block the hook
---
Since were all talking about people we like watching. I actually enjoy watching Ohmwrecker, Edgar Alan Bro, Stray Wolf, and more recently Umbra.
---
&gt;Our new goal is to release dedicated servers on all platforms during Fall 2019.
---
Great, the only thing I was looking forward to in the next update.
---
They will be delayed aswel since only dedicated servers made it possible.
---
This would also work for the way survivors and killers are in the current match making. The other  night I played a match where one of the survivors  were rank 3, I'm rank 18. This happens  to me a lot.
---
There's no patch today, but there is the rank reset, which occurs on the 13th of every month.
---
BHVR also posted [an update on Dedicated Servers](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87216/status-update-dedicated-servers/p1?new=1).
---
 Country Roads, take me home. To the place I belong... NORTH VIRGINIA!!!
---
I think you mean [BHVR moment](https://pasteboard.co/Ixh8s6T.png)
---
IRC when they put in the Stranger Things content, they disabled the dedicated servers, and the party stuff was still there, so I'd imagine it'll still be there on live.
---
Ugh, so still at least another 6 months before dedicated servers.  In the meantime, good old 15+ minute queues for killers and wacky times with Ranks 16 -19 players matchmade with Rank 1-4 players...
---
Back on the shelf it goes for now.
---
The students one is probably Last Year: The Nightmare and from what I know it died pretty quick, devs just kinda gave up on it
---
I am disappointed but it was the right decision. Dedicated servers caused as many problems as it actually fixed.
---
If we talking about canonically both Quinton and Laurie around 16 and 17
---
But you will get a a lot less red flags for having murderous minors than actually having minors one.
---
The BioShock is a great example of this.
---
Mostly in games if minors ever get killed.
---
It's typically not done by the protagonist or player 
---
If it is done by the protagonist or player is typically very quick and often off screen.
---
It's not very gory or at least if there is any go to it it's only through the often math and we don't see the actual action taking place.
---
We already know two survivors who are canonically under the age of 18 and like it or not most of the Legion are also 18 or under
---
I mean people that free to think whatever they want but if you're going to show me a picture of an orange and then tell me it's an apple because oranges are a little taboo I'm not going to believe you which is basically what I feel like when did they bring up the whole everyone's over 18.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOR38552MJA
---
A game three years old and this popular should not be just now getting dedicated servers.
---
Wasn‚Äôt this just posted the other day? With far more upvotes and created by the person who posted it. Nice try though.
---
&gt;Killer mains may not have liked it because its an actual fair system
---
So hatchets having a second delay of the animation ending and the hatchet actually leaving her hand is fair? Or how about Myers having a second delay on his stalk activating so stalking around loops is nigh impossible? Or Plague's vomit? Or how about the killer having high ping actually being advantageous since pallet swings guarantee a hit almost 80% of the time? Can't forget huntress hatchets randomly instantly downing people without iri head or hitting 2 people *at once* either. Super fair system, huh?
---
Ur dumb Bc I found this on Instagram so stfu nerd
---
Anyone that played during this PTB knew that servers weren't ready to go live. I am talking about people that actually played, not just those that entered PTB to check the new content and uninstalled immediately. 
---
For survivors the benefits from dedicated servers weren't completely there apart from removing lag switching entirely but playing killer felt unnecessarily "uncomfortable", even at 40ms. Huntress suffered the most from servers and I can't really talk about other specific killers because I only tested her. 
---
Unfair hits (that people wrongfully blame on hItBoxEs) were still there even when you had a lower ping than the killer.
---
I am glad with their decision. Now, if only they can punish blatant lag switchers more often and severely, that would be a good way to calm down the playerbase until servers hit.
---
Very tactical. 
---
I like it.
---
You have all the rights to be dissapointed, i for sure am just like you but you don't understand how hard it is to implement something this big without problems. They know exactly how bad people will take this delay and the hate they will get but it will be nothing compared to releasing dedicated servers with the current problems. This is for the best wether you want to admit it or not.
---
I knew it. I mean I know they want to get it right but it‚Äôs still disappointing. They hyped it up for so long and went as far as to insinuate that they would definitely be released in September as they kept saying ‚Äúremember Summer doesn‚Äôt officially end until 23rd September‚Äù. 
---
Judging by gameplay footage though there was a lot of issues, which is surprising considering they‚Äôve been working on it for so long, but i‚Äôm mainly sad that means DC‚Äôs will continue to go unpunished right up until the next Chapter, at the very least.
---
No, he really is incredibly arrogant. I don't care what hate I do get about it, but he constantly talks about being sniped and constantly getting SWF.
---
I remember EXPLICITLY a Nurse game where he played against four very average survivors on Ironworks and immediately threw out that he was playing vs a god tier SWF. I DM'd him on Twitter that NOT A SINGLE PERSON in the team was friends with anyone else on Steam. Not a single one even had a relation with each other, and he threw a huge hissy fit about being sniped by "the best SWF teams" when in reality he lost to four randoms as Nurse on Ironworks.
---
I don't care if he's not that good, but he can at least own up to just losing. It happens to literally everybody. But don't sit there and say things like "Oh I've reached the skillcap on Killer like everyone has" when any single Nurse practitioner would've crushed the group with Ruin. 
---
He constantly talks down on other streamers, just not specifically. "Wow I'm getting a lot better survivors than the guy I was watching last night". ????
---
Maybe he's gotten better lately. About a year ago he was my favorite streamer, he took everything in stride. Now he's constantly defensive about his own skill and image. It's really infuriating and shows his complete arrogance. 
---
And on top of this, you should actually be somewhat honored that your fanbase wants to come and play with you. Most of the people he plays against that comment about "hey Tru3" are genuinely good-natured people who just want to play with someone they respect. Instead he wants them blocked??? 
---
Yes, I understand getting sniped by 4x SWF with 4x syringes with the DS+BT+Unbreakable shuffle can be very frustrating. But I've watched his stream enough, it doesn't happen to him often enough to whine about it.
---
Wowwwww you really got me. Nice lack of karma, wonder how that happened?
---
Kate wins even against the odds
---
Happy to wait a little longer than to have it release and if be suboptimal, especially for such a large chapter that‚Äôll potentially bring in a lot of new players.
---
\&gt; if your good with her you can mindgame the shit out of survivors, which feels amazing and earned! 
---
Wat... You can sit at pallet loops and pretend to phase and watch survivors run at you while freaking out. You're not doing anything special by standing there and acting like you used your power. 
---
How is scratched mirror super strong? He's slow as hell and his lunge range is garbage. Just loop the Myers to death.
---
The delay was because killers actually had a ping. They can't fix that.
---
Not true, the devs acknowledged it was a bug, not a ping issue
---
I just started using it too, and I like it. Beside just beating Ruin and NOED, breaking several totems gets you good boldness, especially since I try to play stealthy and avoid the killer usually.
---
Or he could have done the same thing and not swung the second time knowing dead hard was coming (assuming David used it at least one other time that game)
---
If you own the DLC and use a test offering, you will load with whatever perks and add-ons you have equipped.
---
Spawns are just at random. You got lucky you spawned with someone üôÉ I barely spawn with others.
---
It gets underrated all the freakin time man
---
I mean if you wanted to get 2 hit downed from a regular Huntress hatchet or watch as it downs both you and your injured teammate then go right ahead but when 1 of your most popular killers as well as one of your newest killers are both borderline unplayable that's not good for your player base (even more so when you consider how long survivor queues are currently).
---
It's just a little common for at least two of the survivors to start semi close to each other
---
Same here I play killer and I keep getting the stupid bird perk that one one uses. No matter how many times I skip it, it just keeps coming back lvl after lvl.
---
It's not toxic, it's just a stereotype that people who use it are toxic. There's a lot of people who use it and follow the killer around, tbag and click flashlights at them trying to get their attention.
---
You're describing bugs. In theory its supposed to be a fair system, you honestly think killers having 1 ping PTP and survivors having 60-100+ is a fair system?
---
Lies. The makeup look isn't bad either.
---
I think you read it wrong. Dedicated servers are coming around Fall 2019.
---
Wich is between September 23th and December 22th...
---
bruh why are you on every post defending this. This game is going to be almost 3 and a half years old before these servers come out lmao. Do you know how insane that is in a game this popular?
---
Even granted, they had no idea how popular it would become, but I'll remind you we've had a cosmetic store for well over a year now, with not insignificant prices.
---
*Thousands
---
I‚Äôve never really played much killer, but I‚Äôm going to pick up Freddy. He looks really fun. Should probably grab bubba too for BBQ I guess.
---
Better to delay than release it when it's not ready
---
No I meant, what is this monster
---
i just defended bhvr in 2 posts but ok
---
Commodious toolbox with extra charges and increased speed, prove thyself, resilience and the 4th perk is up to you (self care for 99ing yourself, no mither if you want that permanent resilience, spine chill is also nice)
---
Woo love me some Wraith
---
Shit man I'd dc too, ain't wasting a perk slot because of some survivor meta trickery
---
I'm on console and I depip everytime killer rage quits. And only a few times to I get bloodpoints. This one in particular pissed me off cause I had 4 stacks for WGLF and would of earned alot of bloodpoints. As soon as I run through the exit gate door the killer rage quits like a little bitch and bam! Big waste of time
---
I mean, they're both in the game, not illegal, and unfun for the other party
---
Lightborne is a direct upgrade to Franklin's if every survivor is using a flashlight, you dont need to hit them for it to function.
---
Wait what? Since when?
---
Just giving legion the ability to down with his power, bringing back old mix tape, and bringing back blood tracking, and legion is fixed. It's not alot of work but Bhavior are likely scared of survivor backlash like what got Legion nerfed to begin with. Tbh the only thing that needed to be changed was no passive bleed loss while in terror radius. The rest was all overkill.
---
You can catch them if they're injured and vault when you're too close but generally catching them is no better than just hitting them twice.
---
Dat jawline tho
---
Franklin's isnt even that good of a perk lol, if anything they should unbutcher it and let it activate on hits that arent just m1s
---
This. Pyramid Head is supposed to be James's monster, and his alone
---
[You mean this game? LOL](https://reddit.app.link/fgq5bEYzXZ)
---
The devs said all the characters are at least 21
---
Hes honestly not bad anymore, I really like how they buffed his stealth so he isnt a walking jet engine
---
Why
---
It's a shame to hear, but better a late and polished release than an early and broken one.  
---
If they manage to pump these servers out before 2020, and they work well from the moment they're released, I will gladly forgive the delay, and I reckon a good portion of the community will as well.
---
By the way nice reddit name lol
---
Stop being so obsessed
---
I hope console optimization finally means we can play Nurse with more than 10 fps and she finally becames a top tier killer in consoles.
---
Please refrain from stalking me or I'll simply just block you
---
Having repaired pallets auto-break when thrown wouldn't be as bad, since you can't repair a pallet 3 times to block off certain doors that way
---
Each weapon is essentially the same, gameplay wise.
---
Same with me. I continue to spend money on this game to try and support them. Having a blast with it.
---
the best advice I can give is watch someone that's good and learn through example. some youtubers/streamers you could check out that are pretty good killers are truetalent, zubatlel, and otz
---
Only 3 hits? Killer would win every game
---
You know, I'm glad that they're pushed back, because they were terrible (and I'm sitting on a data center afaik, so...) but it's funny that they were so snappy about "hurr durr, summer is september, too!" when it's so obvious that they wouldn't make it.
---
If you can‚Äôt beat them, B A L A N C E  T H E M
---
Pingas
---
I like how their version of meat hooks is some dude hanging on monkey bars
---
You just defined chasing. Picking one person to follow, kill, and put on a hook. If you're good, you shouldn't even be in a situation where you are "tunneled." If someone actually has tunnel vision, be thankful. More than likely 3 or all of the survivors will easily finish gens, and use perks to save the tunneled guy. If not, you have to work on your skill, not go to reddit and tell your opposition to cater the game to you.
---
Wtf is wrong with quentins face in the right panel
---
There was no open exit gate for blood warden to work.
---
Yes it‚Äôs a repost. I thought it was funny so I decided to share. Laugh and move on
---
New Killer: Mountain Mama
---
Sore winners are the worst.
---
Like I get it when you lost and were into the game, like I can sympathize with that I get why you may be flustered. But sore winning is just sad

Dwight: ARE WE REALLY GONNA LEAVE HIM HERR NEA?!

I'm not? Using reddit is just that simple. I update this in 10s every time a new post is made.

---
Doing gens, you?
---
That Meg shoulda left, her tbag cost her a bunch of points
---
This needs to be the nea face update
---
This is why I always immediately leave as soon as I can against killers who I think are gonna dc.
---
To be fair wasnt this game made exclusively for Steam in the beginning? I may be wrong but I feel like it wasnt predicted to be as big as it is and therefore takes time to perfect on all platforms but I could see console being a bit harder to perfect
---
Dude, they can't even get shit on time or right when they give themselves OVER A FUCKING YEAR! I would not hold my breath.
---
The huntresses mom
---
All the killers mori including the Demogorgon!
---
Demigorgon mains are gonna join this game and just chug bottles of bourbon to handles it bullshit
---
ok
---
"Gg ez baby killer"
---
Or
---
"Nice tunnel trash"
---
if you're in a two-man, both of you bring streetwise, one brings prove thyself and then you both bring the engineers/mechanics toolbox with both speed addons. easy 23-27 second gens
---
Probably just one - it's not much of a "legion" if its an individual, right?
---
Thank goodness they pushed them back. They were buggy as all hell on PTB and the game would have been miserable to play had they pushed them the Stranger Things chapter. I hope they can get them fixed and figure out whats causing nonsense like all of the Huntress bugs.
---
What if you
---
Wanted to mindgame at a loop with pigs ambush attack
---
But the survivor said
---
*running away from the loop noises*
---
The existence of the Legion being outright confirmed to be teenagers kind of disproves that immediately.
---
That's the games own description that refers to them as teenagers.
---
Hence why I said in a previous post I kind of call BS on the whole everyone's 21 point they sometimes use.
---
Also Quentin Smith, Laurie Strode are under the age of 18 and Steve Harrington and Nancy Wheeler are 18/19 around the time of Stranger Things season 3 which the devs said is where they're from.
---
Wish I still had the screenshot but I remember the time during Bloodhunt I went into a match as Legion and someone DCed instantly. I get a notification and the person who DCed added me on Steam. I add them and message them "I'm curious. Why add when you DC against a farming Legion?"
---
I don't remember exactly what they said but I think they called me something akin to a motherfucker puppy kicker child molester for playing a character they didn't like in a video game.
---
If you‚Äôre talking about the title, it‚Äôs a joke lol. They promised optimization in December....2018.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know this sub existed before I was like ‚Äòfuck it, let‚Äôs see if there‚Äôs a dbd community on Reddit‚Äô
---
The way I see it is it can't be racist without racist intent.
---
Whoever owns the rights to Friday the 13th should have put Jason in DbD and not make the awful Friday 13th game.
---
Between here and Steam discussions I'd say it's fairly similar. They're both shit shows for the most part.
---
Do you go to Montana state or Michigan state? Or neither?
---
That doesn‚Äôt work for the formula of DBD. The maps are cramped and small on purpose. It works to an extent in F13 because the survivors have weapons and pocket knives to fight back. Not to mention you can actually kill Jason and have a variety of ways to escape unlike DBD just having 1 (I guess 2 but only for 1 person). The game style is intentionally very different because F13 is supposed to have a bit more of the movie feel.

They downvote us but are too spineless to reply. Hilarious.

r/rareinsults
---
Unpopular opinion: the peer 2 peer system is literally fine the way it is and you wont have any problems if you pay attention to your ping when playing survivor, I hope they postpone dedicated servers as long as possible, because when it comes out its gonna be laggy as fuck.
---
Both of them are semi-indie games that became triple A studios. I don‚Äôt think it would be too far fetched to get Sebastian and Safehead
---
Get off reddit this post is literally in hot 1 day ago
---
The entire code of this game was built around the current connection system. 
---
Introducing a new system (in this case, dedicated servers), affects every single aspect of the game, and in some cases means rebuilding the entire code of certain mechanics (character movement, the hatchet system, etc.), with new code to support the new server connection. All of which needs to be tested on a massive scale to get accurate feedback - that would be the PTB. Then, any issues found need to be addressed, starting the process over again. This is all on top of trying to maintain and support the current connection and it's issues.
---
Keep in mind that dedicated servers weren't even a priority for the first half of the games lifetime. This shit takes time, and you can't simultaneously complain that BHVR releases buggy content while also complaining that they held back a release because it was buggy.
---
Franklin's is good all around; insta heals, boxes, flashlights and keys. It frazzles survivors when they realize you have it equipped and it makes people waste time to go back for their items. It also makes people not want to stick around the exit gates. 
---
Lightborn is only good for flashlights.
---
It was never designed to have dedicated servers lmao, theres nothing wrong with the peer2peer system

Thank god. Anyone who played on the PTB knows that playing on the dedicated servers is complete shit on both sides. Hits hitting from 3 miles away. Hatchets literally going through people. Hitting people in front of you and not hitting. It was terrible and worse than p2p.
---
I'm either case hes wrong
---
It‚Äôs a 3 blink nurse. Never fun
---
Sounds like a good way to let a bad killer make a bad play, and still walk away with more than a single kill. If a survivor gets face camped, everyone else should be rushing gens to punish the killers lack of pressure, playing into their hands only encourages poor play
---
The DBD theme is derived from Dies Irae, which is a common musical trope used to signify death. [Here‚Äôs a video showcasing many instances where Dies Irae has been used ](https://youtu.be/0hL1m4hGBVY)
---
Letting survivors get gens done is not more valuable then killing. Ever heard of end game builds?

&gt;Killer mains may not have liked it because its an actual fair system and not reliant on host getting 1 ping, but for survivor mains this would've been a very nice change. Sad to see it pushed back to "Fall 2019".
---
That's not how it was in the PTB. In the PTB it made hit detection even worse. More unfair on both sides. You'd get hit when you shouldn't get hit and also not get hit when you should have been. At least live is consistent. The servers weren't in their state on the PTB.
---
Samination?
---
What, you think Otz isn't always lurking nearby when his name is mentioned?
---
Definitely not if you use your ability and aren't holding the game hostage.
---
That's usually what I get, even if I didn't tunnel all game.
---
never forget the 'optimization pass'
---
I cant play wraith without a windstorm addon

Be careful, you are making too much sense and telling the truth exactly why dedicated servers had to be delayed. You will be downvoted with the rest of us
---
Me too
---
(To further increase ur invisibility, wear the blue school uniform and hide in the freezer on the game ;)
---
You definitely should watch some looping/chase tutorials and just gameplay in general. Some that I recommend would be Otzdarva, Ohtofu, Monto, Truetalent... 
---
It sounds like you don't know how to play at pallets and windows and might just be running straight for them instead of looping and mind gaming, which is not something that you're going to pick up on anyway at the beginning. It's really not complicated once you watch some experienced players and keep playing the game to get a grip on how it works. 
---
Once you can half understand how to loop a pallet, window, and basic mindgaming, you'll do just fine, *especially* in low ranks.
---
If you think people calling out racey things as possibly racist I think you're racist

Template was made by u/raszota üçî
---
Bamboozle, Cruel Confinement, and Blood Warden AT THE SAME TIME
---
I think they mean just catching up to and downing survivors. Not actually grabbing them on a pallet or window.
---
Quick fan art is still amazing!
---
A chase that goes all across the map from one vault/ pallet to the next is more fun than looping the same one or two vaults/pallets repeatedly until they're forced to move on because the pallet is broken or the entity blocks it.  Change things up. Running in circles around the same pallet is uninteractive and creatively bankrupt.
---
Yes, and I cry whenever theres ruin on that map and I'm survivor, I literally have no idea where they spawn
---
Time to start rubbing it with both hands
---
I streamed DBD for a while a couple years ago and one of my viewers bought it for me. I'm very glad I didn't have to pay for it.
---
nancy to 40 then steve to 40 because I want nancy's perks more. and then 9 bloodwebs on dweet and jane to make sure they have what I need
---
Bad meme no one cares
---
Can you explain flashlight clicking?  A lot of talk about it but I can't find a definition anywhere.  I know killers don't like flashlights, but they are far from overpowered so I hope it's just not more complaint about that.  Flashlights are probably the least useful items in the game but still have their purpose if a survivor takes the time to learn how to use them (I haven't).
---
By a HUGE margin, no less.

Tombstone Infinite is the best powertrip in the WORLD!

my opinion is in opposition to players that like to "punish" a bad killer by giving the bad killer a free kill because they are scared.

i have covered this in other posts. please stay tuned for my next post: dealing with "stealthies" in your game.
---
You see the truth that I see. At least 3/4 of this sub is yellow rank survivors who expect killers to follow their rule book.
---
When I'm feeling toxic, I tend to walk around the map w/ the survivor pretending to look for the hatch (if he doesn't wiggle) but I take them to the basement instead.
---
&gt;We have settled on the following locations for servers when we initially launch dedicated servers: 
---
&gt;Australia: Sydney
---
Holy crap we did it guys.
---
Ha, jokes on you, I can barely loop the killer for a single pallet and I still get camped and tunneled
---
Looks like a green sid the sloth
---
Smh my head that's racist
---
The dead by daylight community is more divided and nasty than actual politics lol
---
Burger king myers approoves
---
I love how your comment reels the dumb fucks right in. If this were a killer biased sub, you wouldn't be swimming in downvotes.
---
Sorry it had to be you, but thanks for proving a point that these brainless incels couldn't possibly understand.
---
That's what happens when you play by survivor rules.
---
otz is a good boy
---
I know what you mean, its not just this sub its the entirety of reddit who just complain about things and huddle around bitchy victimization.
---
I played spirit an this Jeff spawned and I could see him lmao
---
Because you break your back
---
I think konami would sooner make a silent hill casino than lend their copyright to literally anyone
---
B-but you're supposed to let me live! It says here in rule 3 of the survivors rule book for killers! No killing survivors! Reported! Enjoy your ban kiddo!
---
Or just... Learning the loops to counter them? It's really not a top-tier pro-only skill to be able to mindgame half the loops in the game.
---
I don't mind losing a few karma points to prove a point
---
Neither.  I graduated from University of Montana, so if the answer was Montana State, I would‚Äôve said ‚Äú**COUGS SUCK, GO GRIZ!**‚Äù but if not, I would‚Äôve said nothing.
---
Godspeed to the new ST fans coming in. Hopefully people will be rightfully ranked up by Tuesday.
---
Having a ‚Äúmain‚Äù in DbD is boring.
---
Could be new players that like the sound of a (near) invisible killer.
---
Just change up which vaults/pallets you're staying glued to.  No reason to run around the same pallet 5 times when you could be running from one pallet to the other to a vault in succession, taking the killer on a chase across the map without playing merry-go-round in one place for too long.  No one is saying "rUn In A sTrAiGhT lInE" just to make the chase more interesting by running to different pallets and vaults besides the same two that people seem obsessed with running around repeatedly.

You are not alone, bro.
---
Hate to break it to you, but camping was intended from the start and even had a perk and a killer designed around it. Looping was emergent gameplay that the devs didn't see coming until after launch.
---
It wasn't until after launch that design started eliberately discouraging camping and encouraging loops.
---
all killers except nurse have a higher base movement speed than survivors by the way
---
Either way, a face camping killer will get at least a kill, unless he‚Äôs a double amputee playing with his eyes closed. Feeding him more points and potentially extra kills encourages his behavior and perpetuates the idea that face camping is a viable tactic. Good survivors punish poor play, that‚Äôs how you win
---
The longest I haven‚Äôt played a character was Detective Tapp, I picked him up during the Christmas event then stopped playing DBD and him for a while until I got a challenge for him a few months later
---
oh my god that had one is so nice and detailed you really captured her everything
---
Or the samination wraith vid
---
heya
---
I'm ashamed to say this, but I've never played the hag. :( And I've tried every killer at least once.
---
Man, it was me and a random Feng . We had 2 gens left. I was on gen and I was assuming Feng was too. I was running spine chill so I was able to get away from the gen and maneuver around so Legion never saw me. This happened for like 10 minutes straight with the killer constantly camping my gen.  Eventually I got hooked and I saw the Feng had been hiding in a locker and then proceeds to point at me until I was sacrificed and then eventually she died as well. After I called her out her response was ‚Äúyou were looking for the hatch so I let you die.‚Äù Most infuriating thing and why I hate running solo survivor.  I literally had the killers attention FOREVER and she was hiding in a locker assuming I was looking for the hatch.
---
Yes, it works better against flashlights than Franklin's, and if they all have flashlights. Then it's better. That's my entire point.
---
I like how you haven‚Äôt replied back to anyone when they‚Äôre making valid points.   Cat got your tongue? 
---
Looping is not ‚Äútoxic‚Äù and it shouldn‚Äôt be punishable.  Like others said, do you want the survivors to just stand still or run in a straight line? Everything on the map is used for everyone‚Äôs advantage. 
---
I‚Äôm convinced you‚Äôre a) a fucking troll b) a kid c) extremely new to the game d) uneducated 
---
Stop trying to be toxic and rude because you got your feelings hurt one too many times in a game
---
Yeah. I try to play really fair when I'm killing, like I will outright ignore someone in front of me if they were the last on a hook because I know how bad it feels to get unhooked and immediately go downed. If the game requires it, I might slug them to apply some pressure, but I make it a solid rule to never double hook anyone. I'll usually go for the further BBQ auras to ensure whoever I hook can get off before struggling, and shit like that. But damn when I play fair and lose because of it, it just feels bad when people rub it in like a personal victory. Like I chose to ignore you running when I could have killed you because I didn't want someone to end with 6,000 bloodpoints but fuck me I guess.
---
Ye
---
These are raaaaaaad!!!! Well done!

You don't have the boobalicious mousepads so apparently you're not :P

What the fuck
---
Not graphic but neither is dbd, the models just clip the skin is never visually broken.
---
True but in a way it proves a point: its way too hard to depip at green rank. I just had a game where i did same thing as above but this time killer owned me, and i got safety lol
---
Morto ahaha
---
Mashed potatoes!
---
That sounds almost useless
---
Well there is Insidious which promotes camping...
---
Baiting dead hard at the exit gates is super risky.
---
That is annoying!
---
&gt; You literally just went out to insult and try to guess my rank 
---
I didn't. but I did guess however that you have two braincells correctly for not being able to read because I didn't say that anywhere in my post.
---
&gt; You can't compare a fucking streamer with a non-streamer gamer because I don't play it for work 
---
there's literally no difference. they just play more and broadcast it, it has literally nothing to do with streaming. you can't be mad someone plays the game more than you and then bitch and whine you aren't as good and then try to dispute it with a salty opinion when facts proving you otherwise are literally being streamed/recorded. You don't get a free pass to bitch whine and have the game changed because you don't want to invest time into something to be better at it. nothing in this world works that way. you either educate yourself and self improve or you suck and fucking deal with it, you don't get it both ways.
---
&gt;  because this game stupidly favours swf 
---
If it did then fungoose/Otz or any other good killer wouldn't be able to 4K without any addons and any killer against good SWF. I hate to break it to you, but you're just bad at the game. simply put. sounds harsh I know, but that is just factual. I'm not insulting you, although I know I hurt your feelings because you're salty reply says it all. Like I said before, dumb killers with huge egos are afraid to admit they're not good rather than just look at what they could do differently.
---
&gt; Oh and I main Pig/Spirit so yeah, I'm far from being a bad killer. 
---
Imagine thinking either of these killers aren't good, but yes - you aren't a good killer. If you honestly believe you can't win against a SWF just because they're SWF then you are 100% without a doubt a shit killer. You get schooled by SWF not because they're "godtier" but because you're ass at the game.
---
oh my sweetie... take a breath between losing and coming to reddit please :)
---
North Virginia lmao
---
&gt; That streamer's twitter/discord/Twitch channel? Enjoy being ganged up on by hordes of fans, mocked endlessly then blocked/ban by the streamer.
---
Okay, but why would you go into someone's discord, or on their twitter or channel to talk shit on them anyway? Seems like a pretty dumb idea if you think about it for half a second.
---
The post read like the survivor was being a hypocrite so had to ask
---
If they wanna be cunts then fuck em and their points get into the a new match and start the murder all over again
---
Those are rad! Are you planning on adding them to your Redbubble store?
---
If a killer is face camping, and he not only let the hooked survivor, but his unhooker as well, escape, he‚Äôs a bad killer, arguably possessing an absence of basic mechanical skill so breathtaking, it would put career rank 20‚Äôs to shame. A killer with any functioning brain cells will secure his kill if he‚Äôs committed to a face camp, and anyone above rank 10 should know you don‚Äôt hook bomb in front of the killer because someone isn‚Äôt making it out. You can have you ‚Äúfun bigger picture‚Äù, the good survivors will be busy in the back, winning, instead of rewarding killers who play poorly
---
Exactly!
---
LOL probably. I need Ruin to really slow them down. I have had Myers since I got the game and still no Ruin. I can't prestige him either because he still has Gruesome cakes too and I'm now holding those until 2x bloodpoint
---
Dailies are horrible. Seems like I'm constantly getting the same 4.
---
I was excited to see what that game could do but it just felt so unfocused. Something just felt really off about it.
---
‚úãüòé
---
Exactly lol
---
You are so right. Lets take survivors out of the game and change it to a Sims style game where the Trapper nicely decorates the ground with his traps and billy chops wood for the new house with his chainsaw. /s
---
D O I N G   G E N S   Y O U ?
---
Oh no! :o console?
---
Having the hag rip out your throat and dig out your guts is pretty graphic.
---
Let's not forget the pretty brutal stab treatment that Legion gives you.
---
I hate that I have seen this so many times.
---
Honestly, after trying them on the PTB, I was actually hoping the servers wouldn't launch with 3.2.0. In that sense, I'm very okay with this.
---
I love how survivors do a cartwheel when they‚Äôre hit a 2nd time
---
Yea, it probably is. I wish they would have been a bit more creative with these new perks to be robust and encourage a change in meta play. Too many niche, never used perks already.
---
Can i get uhhhhh Myers Burger with extra sauce
---
Freddy copied his traps. Trapper in turn copied Freddy's teleport.
---
What are your expectations?? Playing for chill or being competitive???
---
This subreddit would be way better if we collectively decided it was exclusively for cool game clips, fan art, dumb memes, and things that are generally entertaining. All the rage about game balancing and bugs should be in the forums seen by the development team, where it'll actually have some impact.
---
Ebony Mori is a thing
---
3% per hook
---
New JoJo chapter confirmed
---
I hope you're right, I was only on the PTB for the first couple days.
---
ebony mori's don't allow you to get better at the game
---
Oh I agree,  but I included those more to showcase that if you don't like a streamer or have a criticism of them, your options for talking about it are limited. 
---
And for what it's worth, there's a difference between shit talking and asking "Hey, X perk or Y killer isn't THAT bad, why do you hate it so much?" And then suddenly facing the wrath of a hundred strangers who have a new acceptable target because the streamer called you out.
---
The Best multiplayer horror game yes the Best horror game no, alien isolation is the Best now and ever ( now we have the demogorgon in the game we   can have the alien)
---
So why not make James a survivor as well
---
Wow! That's a beautiful drawing of the Hag, kudos to you!! All jokes aside, great drawing. Maybe you could draw Leatherface sometime?
---
That‚Äôs true. I also think the demogorgon looks fun.
---
here is the last attempt i will make at helping you:
---
how many face camping killers who never see a survivor even attempt a rescue would you consider a good killer? how would you know they were a good killer if you never went to try to save someone?
---
you seem to care a lot about functioning brain cells and killers not being able to move properly and stuff, but it seems like your brain cells could use a little functioning too friend.
---
have a link to illustrate your "hook bombing" comment.

Validated

Better than buggy garbage servers.
---
How do you feel about people running both and intentionally getting picked out of a locker to DS and Head on them immediately after the DS stun?
---
That shit is so funny even when you're killer.
---
Yeahh... \*sweeps all the lag abuse, shitty connection issues, and unfun drawbacks under the rug*
---
Nothing wrong here.
---
Can you send me a link to the video? Can't find it.
---
I'll be honest I'm lazy and watching my two kids so I cant really go down a serial killer rabbit hole, but did gacy used some form of gas?
---
Rng.
---
We need to do something about it so they can see probably will take 8 months but as long as killers get a buff or the maps are actually designed better with atleast 15 pallets not 25 or 30 its fuckin ridiculous
---
Rip
---
I like how there is no server anywhere near the middle of the US lol
---
Great so now the killer KNOWS what gen your at and he knows you are in the area so he just looks for you. And he can easily look around to see if you left the forty metre radius
---
Pretty sure I specified ‚Äúface camp‚Äù, as opposed to general camping like in the clip shown. A face camping killer will hit you once as you approach for the unhook, and once more after you unhook. That‚Äôs the best case scenario. Your teammate escaped, and you‚Äôve taken his place. Now either 2 things happen.
---
1: Your teammates go do some gens and you die a hero.
---
2: Your teammates heal up, regroup, and it‚Äôs some one else‚Äôs turn to hang on the hook, until someone dies, and the killer is free to take another player hostage, since everyone was too busy playing hero to do gens
---
So either 1 guy dies, and everyone else lives, robbing the killer of a potential pip, and likely de-pipping him, or you feed him points, give him the opportunity to secure extra kills, and possibly boost him so much that he gets a safety or, god forbid, pips because no one did the objective.
---
The way I see it, 1 death and the killer losing&gt;risk of more deaths to save one measly life. If you wanna die a hero, more power to you, but dead is dead at the end of the day, better someone else than you
---
&gt; You just defined chasing.
---
No. Chasing is getting someone down and hooking them.
---
Tunneling is then running straight back to that hook and chasing that same person again while ignoring the guy who took him off the hook despite him being right in your face.
---
[This is tunneling](https://clips.twitch.tv/HyperSmallJaguarHotPokket) and it makes the game boring - Not only for the guy being tunneled but also for the teammates who are being ignored.
---
&gt;If you're good, you shouldn't even be in a situation where you are "tunneled."
---
How do i stop being tunneled if a killer decides to chase me after I get unhooked? That's not my decision. 
---
&gt; If someone actually has tunnel vision, be thankful. More than likely 3 or all of the survivors will easily finish gens
---
Funny. I've been facecamped by leatherfaces in the basement and still had people try to unhook me.
---
&gt;and use perks to save the tunneled guy. 
---
You can't save someone whos being tunneled, it's on them entirely. All you can do is unhook them and hope they ran run killer for all 5 gens solo before reaching third hook. A lot of people cannot do that.
---
&gt;If not, you have to work on your skill, not go to reddit and tell your opposition to cater the game to you.
---
You can play as you want but at least be selfaware. You want to facecamp? Go wild. Don't complain about genrushing tbaggers and the fact your hard stuck green ranks.
---
If not for the cosmetic store, we wouldn't have had HALF the content and updates ascwe have recieved.
---
Fair
---
I'm talking about using them after pallets it slows the game down like 30 seconds cause you lose them for a bit... that's half a gen
---
Just so you know, you have perks that can be used along with abilities to help you win your chases, practice with them.
---
I prefer the servers being delayed instead of it coming out like hot garbage.
---
BEGONE REPOSTER
---
How do you beated someone up?
---
"Tunneling" is legit Just doing the objective for the killer, camping is an exploitation that should make you forfeit the match.
---
I know killers have really great perks in combinations but the survivor perks are far superior
---
the forums are insane sometimes
---
"Laughs in Console Player"
---
They literally had a finished DLC coming out before they got slapped with a lawsuit
---
He just materialized out of thin air. He probably couldn't see you, for the same reason you couldn't see him before he kicked the gen
---
There are already plenty of ways killers know what gens survivors are on. Whispers already does the same as knowing survivors are within an area so thats nothing new.
---
With fists, probably. Or a blunt object.
---
Whispers does the same except it shows EXACTLY where the survivor is once the leave the radius. You are telling me its OP whispers
---
Cough cough. Identity V may be a chinese ripoff, but it does have very original and fun ideas into it
---
So you can beated a person?
---
Survivor lobby‚Äôs are pretty slow right now, killer lobby‚Äôs are quick though so maybe play that?
---
Freddy swung -&gt; David dead hard not the other way around. Freddy could have waited but he went for the swing instead when he could have waited dead hard and then git the last swing.
---
I main Blendette simply because she's the first character I started playing to get Self Care. Of course, now I don't run self care because it just wastes time. I do Gens, and I'm the exact opposite of immersed. I enjoy looping and I know how to do it. So not all of us are useless, but most are.
---
both perks allow you to hide. Would just mean perks like urban evasion/Quick and Quiet etc could be meta.
---
what whole lawsuit thing?
---
I'm sorry for your downvote bombardment. ;w;
---
This is a survivor-themed post.  This is dangerous territory for us.
---
I‚Äôm just going to be blunt here;
---
Survivors aren‚Äôt OP. You‚Äôre just not very good yet.
---
Quit complaining and simply get better at the game.
---
u got your next killers right there. i'd run
---
Looping is fine, camping is fine, tunneling is fine
---
Besides holding the game hostage nothing is wrong
---
GhostFace stealth? Wraith cloak? They have no terror radius
---
if you are playing the game to try and "rob the killer of a potential pip" then playing with you is a very lame experience and you are a definitely a "stealthy".
---
if i am on your team i become more interested in which of us dies first, knowing that is all you are interested in.
---
if you are a worthless teammate, it is in my best interest to die quickly and move on to a new game.
---
as for the technicality of a "face camp", have another link friend.
---

---
when a high octane player takes a hook, they do it for you, in the interest of the game. i personally do it to get an idea of what my team is doing, give a teammate some points, and find a friend to do coop with easily. 
---
again, if my teammates are stealthies, it's literally in my best interest as a gamer to move on. i will most likely get no coop, no altruism, and maybe a small amount of objective and boldness before they let me die on the hook anyway. the same is true if my teammates are trying to rush objectives and run out of the exit. 
---
in games where multiple scoring categories are forced to stay empty nobody genuinely has a good time, only a slight rush in escaping and some kind of weird bragging rights to talk noise to someone playing killer. part of being a good player is understanding that you can easily get much bigger rushes over and over again in game if you actually play it. it actually also makes the game both fun and rewarding on a level i'm sure you can't comprehend.
---
you guys like to giggle happily that it's not you dying so quickly in your super long super lame stealth games but in reality it's us that feel bad for you. it's like you're stuck in 2nd grade but they keep promoting you because they don't know what else to do with you. you don't actually possess what it takes to be where you are.
---
Bruh do you know how many games I'm immediately just fucked on because hex ruin is being run, and even if I drop EVERYTHING to look for the totem I can run the whole map and not find it before we're all super murdered?
---
Pretty selfish view point to have. But if your not helping anyone else, then what benefit are you to them?
---
Would you save you from the hook?
---
Idk man, id rather it stay for m1 hits. I really wouldn't like to be sniped across the map by a huntress and drop my key, just for a different survivor to steal it.
---
No, only because Redbubbles print quality on sticker is pretttttty bad - I dont think images as detailed as these would hold up. 
---
I am planning on opening an etsy store with high quality stickers made of these designs when I finish up the series. Also considering doing enamel pins and/or buttons, and probably sticker sheets of just the characters' heads (we'll see) - when I finish up the last one I'll let everyone here know.
---
Yeah, we‚Äôll still be getting the Party System with Stranger Things. The in-game friends system has nothing to do with DS, they were just going to ship it all in the same package- but now, they‚Äôre going out separately.
---
wait what why
---
When you think about it, Bubbsy is a fucking face wearing cannibal. It's less black face, than it is just fucking vile. It's more fucked that he wears the skin of others, than the fact that it's claudette.  
---
 I hope they update him so he gets more faces tbh.
---
I actually had to turn my psn messages to private because of this game, the ammount of toxic hate messages I got was just way to much.
---
It‚Äôs cool
---
kutzooi? lmao
---
I actually didn‚Äôt know that. I always thought that the DBD theme was a homage to The Shining as there are a shit ton of horror movie references in the game. The more you know.
---
9/10 Blendettes crouch walk to the farthest corner of the map to self care after being unhooked, I applaud you for being the 1/10 Blendettes who actually contribute to the team.
