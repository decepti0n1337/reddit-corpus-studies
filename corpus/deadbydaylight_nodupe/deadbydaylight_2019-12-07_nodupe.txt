The difference is that you can see yourself. I can't really . . .
---
---
---
Why not both?
---
Your last paragraph is just ridiculous. You are still trying to claim the game is killer sided by saying that sometimes killers play against bad survivors.
---

---
This is exhausting
---
I once got accused of hacking because the survivors coudn't see their teammates auras. I was running third seal lol
---
3: Adept killer achievements changed to just sacrificing the four survivors.
---
The way it used to be was a lot better because now if you kill them too fast than you still won‚Äôt get your merciless. One timed de-piped for having such a quick game.
---
Im probably trash with him but when he brings his magnum dong over his head to one-shot people I can't see shit on console and miss a lot.
---
Yeah it's the same reason I stopped watching Tyde back before he quit the game the first time.  It became a chore to listen to him and his endless string of complaints.  Sucked they joy out of watching the gameplay. True is slowly approaching that level of "over this game".
---
I just like him and Yui because I'm a filthy weeb :)
---
And doing nothing at all is more skillful? Lol ok. 
---
The wealth of ignorance from new players is astounding.
---
If you feel the need to be a condescending piece of shit over a video game then I can only imagine how unpleasant you are in real life. Jeez.
---
The point of the PTS is supposed to be for finding fame breaking bugs and to see how a more diverse skill base uses the mechanics so as to test power level.
---
Ruin and bbq are not even that bad to go against. Idk why people complain about it so much.
---
In regards to your point about streamers, I rarely see most people who get a lot of kills die as survivor. Edgar, umbra, tru3. They all do well at both.
---
smol billy
---
League Of Legends, the salt mine, would like to have a chat with you
---
It used to be kill all four survivors, and I guess they changed it so people wouldn‚Äôt just bring a mori and kill everyone. All they had to do was change the requirements to ‚Äúsacrifice all four survivors‚Äù so that way a mori doesn‚Äôt work. 
---
It‚Äôs beyond dumb that you have to make sure chases aren‚Äôt too quick, while keeping pressure on gens. For certain killers, it can get extremely hard if not farming or at low ranks. A lot of the time, I find myself not even using my power but just M1‚Äôing everyone.
---
hey mate I feel like a silly goose but I can't find a post of yours to download all these lovely portraits, is this still a WIP or do I just not see what's in front of me? Cheers!
---
Just because there are variables that skew the results doesn't mean the stats cannot be used to say *anything* about game balance. That they are not something we can go off of to say *everything* about balance is obvious.
---
My initial post already clarified that I take the game to be favouring two or more survivors to escape at its core, so if your point was just that these statistics cannot be used to say the base game is literally as killer-sided as the stats themselves are (less than two survivors escape on average), there was no reason for this conversation to be had to begin with.
---
At least he accepted it. That was really refreshing to see that.
---
A MoM that doesn't dick over M1 killers. I know what you mean about the other perks, though. Balancing is hard yo
---
When I get suspicious, I stay and check their perks. About 80% of the time it‚Äôs A Nurses Calling.
---
At least it was a new player. At rank 4 a killer main that played Plague told us that survivors shouldn't be sitting on gens because she couldn't find us till 4 gens were done and then camped the guy she caught. Ya buddy I should be showing myself to you and not hide or do the objective.
---
It's actually when you sprint away in the middle of searching.
---
Your character just gets up and runs away, and the chest closes itself
---
He will just slug u till ur ds runs out
---
[removed]
---
Then the other survivor leaves even though the killer is chasing someone and you're supposed to be the bad guy for missing the skillcheck
---
Both
---
I‚Äôm just too scared to use it
---
As in "whole concept is just busted in general" or "the numbers are too high" type of busted?
---
Well No Regerts already exists and it it one of Aces perks "Up the Ante"
---
Or like 90% of all movies (horror included) were made in the USA
---
I mean bbq is cheating üëÄ
---
Fucking wretched shop. Also claudette wasting pallets like a champ.
---
Don't forget that if your game laggs while struggling on hook you die. Happened to me way too often.
---
They mostly changed it because it correlated to the pips and just camping could get you to higher ranks (till they decided to be smart and do gens) now that they have a new system it should be separated from kills. Have 4-mans count toward the Adept____ achievements and iridescents toward pips would probably be a nice change. Or just make some killer teachables more viable (looking at you Demo).
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Underperform
---
To say more specific and more accurate things about game balance, we would have to look and control for more specific and accurate stats, yes. I used them as part of my argument as to why I think in the reality of public matchmaking matches, killer players can improve and get good enough to do well in and even win most of their matches. I didn't use the stats to say the game itself is killer-sided.
---
Great job!
---
It‚Äôs the worst when they have make your choice and you‚Äôre on your dead hook. But only you can save because everyone else is busy. So you go and save, nice and crouched, they sprint burst away from hook. Hag teleports and insta downs you and hooks you. 
---
Wow thanks. Has happened so many times I‚Äôve lost count.
---
Thank you :&gt;
---
Well he might not know u have DS and since the hook is gone, people could body block and if he does wait, thats another 60 seconds for gens
---
Demo: the only survivor with a ability, if you are on the killers shoulder you can activate your ability which causes you to fucking eat the killer
---
Or maybe go after any other person idk just an idea
---
I never once said the game is survivor sided lmfao
---
I knew you were brain dead 
---
We‚Äôre done here
---
I wish we had a lot more of these rather an just an increase to power on them.
---
LMAO
---
&gt; There are 20+ pallets per map. No less.
---
No there fucking aren't. I think Hawkins and MAYBE the Game are the only two maps left that can possibly spawn that many pallets.
---
This makes me think that a ghillie suit Jake would be thematic and hilarious
---
Remember Legion? Yeah... no one is laughing huh? Lol
---
In what world

Here u go m8 https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/dzznsq/neonlight_icon_with_background_full_pack_update/

Anything's a dildo if you're brave enough

Dear fucking god you think a handful of streamers proves whatever dumb shit you‚Äôre trying to say
---
Does your mom still dress you you worthless sack of shit?
---
I don't see any cl9wns just a bubba
---
I know what you're talking about and I'm pretty sure that isn't intended. The blood is essentially just a decal on whatever is under the survivor at the time. Because it was the vertical surface of the window the texture just got stretched.
---
I think there would be too few players in the ranked system. Then everyone would move to the quick play game mode and we'd be back to square 1
---
if you have a controller, turbo works well
---
Lived in both for a few years, yes.
---
I never used the word indie, I said relatively small. Also, that number is in total, not just dead by daylight. You do realize that they make other games right? I am not absorbing them of all fault, they do make mistakes, but not anywhere near the degree some people on this subreddit seem to think they do. They may not be a single person in a basement programming the game, but they certainly aren't large enough to force out all the minutae that people want at the speed some seem to want it at and maintain quality
---
Vacuum pallets?
---
Mine?
---
I see this meme at least twice a month
---
It's on the hook
---
No no no this isn't right at all. Demogorgon is from Australia isn't he? 
---
The upsidedown?
---
You for getting caught git gud
---
It‚Äôs RNG how many pallets can spawn. Thompson House and Mother‚Äôs Dwelling can have more than 20 pallets.
---
Welcome to purple ranks. It's less toxic here.
---
I thought it would be more toxic what a releif
---
Do you see how close they are bruh
---
**laughs In hag**
---
I dont have my glasses rn can some write what it sais in chat
---
Everyone in red ranks respect ds
---
Are you playing killer? If so, stop spamming moris. Or you are just getting unlucky, it's not toxic either way
---
Lol I recorded a match last night against a SWF squad who had absolutely no idea what they were doing.
---
we need shirtless cosmetics for nurse
---
Uh, most people in red ranks just eat it cuz they dont care but sure, maybe ur unlucky, r people camping u in red ranks too?
---
Baby Sitter and Distortion have a cute little synergy, unfortunate that Distortion tokens aren‚Äôt earn-able back though.
---
Killers really sleep on Corrupt Intervention. Imo a more reliable perk because of its consistency. Also Discordance and pop. You all should watch Otz's video on using killers without ruin.
---
Awake in the AM
---
Remember when freddy came out? Lol
---
The map is too dark and (at least in ps4) we don't have the option to increase the brightness: /
---
Indeed, but they have no reason to cleanse, hence why its technically a counter to Plague's ability.
---
I think it‚Äôs time for a mummy husband for plague
---
The mummy from the mummy obviously
---
Lord not the trapper. Every "snap" ...welp here i am lol
---
No matter how hard I try, I suuuck at looping, like, *suuuck*.
---
Whenever I feel like I'm doing well I get "bullshit hits" like getting slapped through a window when I'm a full survivor's length away from the window.
---
The only way I've found to play is to be as much of a ninja as I can (which makes me miss out a ton on boldness points, unfortunately).
---
just dont kick the gen 4head.
---
Fred looks adorable.
---
Thanks man
---
I assume your watching an old ass video where vacuuming was a thing on all actions.
---
I think he means how Oni bumps into objects far less than Billy (from what I've seen, haven't bought him yet) as Billy staggers if he looks at a wall the wrong way while using his chainsaw.
---
This is the only thing i hate about solo queue. This fucking blendettes. Hiding in bush all game or searching all chests on the whole map despite not having even plunderer. Not touching ruin gens. And farming you or sandbagging you. My hatred grown so much that whenever I see Claudette I dodge a lobby ( i play on red ranks and still get these retarted fuckers that think they are playing Outlast.
---
As a Bubba main. I really dig what you did with the Leatherface one
---
"Ranks dont mean anything" *casually gen rushed every game *
---
Freddy's injured grunts are so hot they make my skin melt.
---
*Smash Fans have entered the chat*
---
People will watch their teammates die and then hatch camp. The hatch literally rewards people for losing. It would be fine if they reverted it back to it's old spawn mechanics. Then killers wouldn't need to slug with no gens repaired. The whole hatch mechanic is just ridiculous right now.
---
Meme.  Unless you actively go for protection hits in like a SWF
---
I lost him so I walked away to the edge of the map and he just followed the bright red blood. I dont like it
---
It's weird, I mostly play survivor but I get super competitive when I play killer. Idk what it is, but I play super try hard and get kinda upset when a survivor escapes, especially a toxic one. When I play survivor I just do gens and end up getting pissed off at my teammates majority of the time.
---
Who's gonna tell him?
---
You won't believe how immature people can get when they are fucking around with their friends.
---
Bikinis for everyone even dwight
---
Okay. Nothing will come out of it, don't worry. That killer was probably salty because he for outplayed and didn't kill anyone.
---
I honestly thought you were being serious at first. Thank god im was the dumb one there
---
A) I said I don't mash hard, there's no need to. Mashing hard just makes it harder to struggle.  
---
  
---
B) Gamecube controllers are MUCH more durable than xbone controllers.
---
As Buddha once said ‚Äúfuck that garbage map‚Äù
---
Ruin and BBQ are fine, but spirit is just sit there and wait to get fucked (and then suicide on hook).
---
Bait is bait
---
I play to win, and I did, so yeah... I will
---
Is this a repost ? I remember this from a month ago or so because I replied asking how you got her downed I'm the healthy state and I got told iron maiden has that effect.
---
What did he said on post I couldnt understand
---
Nea in a cat maid outfit
---
I think your bait isn't funny or entertaining.
---
How has your luck been? I'm close to 30 matches in an he still feels awful on PS4. It's like trying to play nurse on console.
---
You can't hit survivors outside of like 120¬∞, the frames completely freeze and glitch when you use his demon strike and survivors can dodge everything he has due to said frame drops.
---
He just seems like a garbage billy on console due to the sensitivity and frame issues.
---
His movement seems ok, I can get around the map, but the hits are near impossible to land. I can get to red rank with almost any killer (not nurse, legion, or demo), looks like I'll add Oni to the "reasons to buy a PC" list
---
what is it i dont own freddy
---
Ok.
---
It's interesting how old Trapper's design has to be if he appears quite often in the early prototypes of the game
---
Thays 1 game of many. Dosnt really improve your point
---
It's not "anti-tunnel", it is a timed "second chance" perk.
---
I‚Äôm getting some *DEJA VU* from this ;)
---
Im a freddy main and i can feel your pain lol
---
I think nobody asked you ashy slashy obvious legion main
---
True, buuuuut Mindbreaker makes Sprint Burst *better* at certain spots, whereas Monstrous Shrine always provides a benefit, if a shitty one.
---
It's on Survivor side too. I just wait and wait and then it sends me back, tells me to check NAT which is not the case, then it gives me an error. Been happening since last night.
---
Ace In a thong
---
It's still there tbh. It only works vacuuming back though. So you can take running through a pallet then vacuume back and drop it. This is probably what OP is talking about.
---
Your friend is very lucky!! Great piece
---
Then don‚Äôt help the survivors?
---
A bug free game
---
I know, but killers don't do this all the time.
---
It‚Äôs true, it me!
---
If they‚Äôre smart they will
---
Yes it is lol.
---
I hella appreciate that. He really deserves it. Super cool guy.
---
Since no one has been very clear about this yet: 
---
**Once you hit level 50 (at any Prestige level), you will continue to get new bloodwebs. ** 
---
Only difference is the number for your level won‚Äôt go up.
---
This means you don‚Äôt necessarily have to prestige to try and get Monitor and Abuse, and the only advantage to prestiging is the bloddy cosmetics you get as a reward. Since you‚Äôre already PII, I‚Äôd recommend going to PIII anyway since the Red on White Mask is Myers‚Äô best cosmetic.
---
Good luck!
---
Sounds like you suck.
---
Oh, this was amazing. I love when survivors like this are killed by their own hubris.
---
Same here. 0 issues with killers, but it doesn't work at all with survivor - swf or solo.
---
That's incredible that you've played DBD in NA before the game even came out!
---
Hmm, I haven't been playing a lot since. So far, I've had success on very large open maps like cold wind but extreme failure on closed maps like the game or lery's. 
---
I'm still wanting to give him a chance but I'm afraid using his ability to one down hit is going to be a challenge. I need to figure out the timing to charge it as little as possible while still getting the instadowns. I'm glad to hear I'm not the only one struggling.
---
I also need to try out new Legion to see if he's even trashier than before. It might be a few frustrating games.

I know and his louder.  
---
Well, lets not talk about pink addons maybe
---
You gotta ask Santa for this one.
---
You are completely wrong. They cannot. There are literally not enough possibly tiles on Thompson House to spawn 20 pallets even if every single tile spawns a pallet-containing structure.
---
that was meg
---
&gt;I said killers think EVERYTHING that survivors do is toxic. The game caters to killers as it is. Y'all literally just got a character with built in bloodhound that INVITES tunneling. But tunneling isn't toxic right? It's just a tactic you guys use right? üôÑ
---
You got something you need to talk about, bud?
---
To make the post clear, I kicked the gen and it went through this weird animation and got me stuck on the corner of the gen. It was my adept Oni game but...
---
Can we stop whining about everything just because something didn't go your way?  This goes for everyone.  Its getting ridiculous and needs to stop. 
---
There are way more things the devs need to be concerned with like fixing the 100s of bugs this game has.
---
Yeah, just finished an Oni game with 4 Kills and 5 gens remaining. Got a Ruthless, Chaser was silver because they went down too quick.
---
i, too, love unnerving
---
I'm going to spend the night spamming ig+agi Hag
---
survivor cucks btfo
---
Life has a human centipede reference. Just line 3 people up in a row
---
Still passive madness gives you only one scream per game, it's worthless...
---
I just noticed 100 points left for perfect 32K score Rip
---
I think aesthetically, I like the dark. But obviously it makes it much harder for killer. I would love if they could somehow make it brighter for killers only or something, because man this game would be so much better if it were darker.
---
Ditto my guy
---
i really wish they kept that crawling animation
---
My what?
---
&gt; dash straight into demon strike
---
Wait, do you need to hold rmb and click left mouse button or is it enough to hold rmb and collide with the survivor?
---
Oh no. You did it now. People really dont like what he has to say. Theyd rather pretend the game is fine meanwhile killers are slowly leaving and making survivor queue times absurd.
---
Hello yes excuse me what
---
Don't you know man? Just playing DBD is toxic. 
---
/s
---
Set up a macro to do what the devs should have done long ago.
---
One-button struggle is an extremely unfair advantage though, so make sure to put on a Guy Fawkes mask for when BHVR calls in the SWAT team.
---
As a feng main fuck you leather man
---
This isn't directed to you or survivors like you. Its directed specifically to the teabagging flashlight clicking ones
---
Just remove all killer collision cuz I feel like it
---
Flatline before the sunrise
---
Are we just going to pretend this exact joke and meme format wasn't just posted a couple of days ago?
---
it‚Äôs you, you‚Äôre the clown.
---
this is my new favorite thing on this sub
---
I find this offensive but its very VERY true
---
I would do that too as a killer. 
---
As someone who got it due to mercy, i have to thank Daddy Freddy for allowing me it.
---
Yes drop Self Care it's a 5th killer perk at this point.  Replace with pretty much anything for an improvement to your build.
---
Hey whenever i try to look for a match as killer i wait 10 minutes to join a match with no survivors. I continue to wait and see if a survivor will join but no luck. Does this happen to anybody else?
---
I'll post my thoughts on the rework from another thread:
---
Pros: You can catch people with your power much more effectively
---
Cons: His neutral game is completely neutered compared to before. Deep wound is now even less effective, he has almost no perk synergies, and he probably has the worst capability to end chases after the initial hit.
---
So in summary, I'd say he's worse, definitley not a good pick for red ranks, but a great pick for getting to red ranks. Go to loadout is Corrupt Intervention, Spirit Fury/Enduring, BBQ and chili. Admittedly its not a unique one but I'm not too sure what to run on him or even if it matters what I run besides a buck standard m1 killer buils.
---
I prefer adrenaline or inner strength personally.
---
Trying to get adrenaline for my jake, dont have nancy for inner strength
---
Piggy is a masochist. She loves the nerfs. &lt;3
---
Quentin üòè
---
Done this many time with him now.  Truly is satisfying.
---
explaining not excusing: survivors (and a lot of killers) hate NOED because it gives the killer a huge buff for essentially playing bad. So it generates a lot of salt.
---
Ultimately do whatever you want, you can close the chat window if you want in end game.
---
Got a pic without the thumb?
---
Man, that David is just trap thirsty.
---
Go-to perk loadout: Enduring, Spirit Fury, Infectious Fright, and BBQ&amp;Chili. 
---
Red ranks isn't really an issue since I play to have fun and chase people, not win every single game. Not to mention rank =/= skill. Maybe if I come across survivors who I know are assholes, I might switch to a different loadout... 
---
I guess you could say Legion is roughly the same. I find his power much better to use though.
---
Would iron will or borrowed time be better?
---
Dude the red duty, looks like a hate train in the dark.
---
fun-=(-1);
---
It's possible to 4k at any Rank against any Rank Survivors.
---
Rank doesn't equate to skill.
---
I've met Red Ranks that Self Care in a corner and get downed at Killer shack without me having to break god pallet.
---
How has his neutral game been neutered? Do you mean how Frenzy no longer counts as a normal hit?
---
Personally, I'd go Borrowed Time. 
---
I'd also grab Adrenaline. Or if you are able to lose line of sight for a few seconds, you can run Quick and Quiet, or even Dance With Me to couple with Head On.
---
Yea but it got taken down cause I didn‚Äôt edit the names out
---
I'm sure there's some gamer dad's that also enjoy coke and hoes. 
---
(Happy cake day!)
---
I feel like relying on Hex perks is a bad practice because once that totem is cleansed you're playing without a perk.
---
Agreed
---
I got adrenaline from the shrine, trying to get quick and quiet as well as dead hard just in case i wanna run it
---
That depends.  Are either of the two perks you just mentioned named Self Care?  As long as they're not, yes they are both better.
---
Okay ripping on how hot garbage Self Care is aside Iron Will and Borrowed Time are two of the best perks you could have mentioned so yes throw either one of those on in its place and that's an upgrade a hundred fold.
---
Thats true. She is like a magnet attracting unneeded nerfs xD
---
It's not a full 60 seconds of freedom. For one, they are still injured, so if they're playing hyper offensively and are getting in your way, just slap them and move on to your target. Also, if you are going after the one that unhooked them, instead of tunneling them, then DS is completely useless.
---
I shouldn't be forced to leave someone who's hyper aggressive on the floor.
---
I would feel that if I was actually, deleted, but I'm not since legion is still good and his base kit was buffed, so if you think Legion got deleted just cause "boohoo can't run STBFL anymore" then go play Oni or something, leave Legion in hands of people who can actually play him.
---
Ooooo, Infectious Fright is a good idea! Also, you‚Äôre absolutely right about rank, I just asked about it cuz you‚Äôre *supposed* to face the best survivors (until potatoes like myself show up and ruin everything lol!). 
---
What about his Frenzy no longer counting as a regular hit? Do you feel this crippled him, or do the changes balance that out? I know you literally said ‚ÄúI find his power much better to use‚Äù, but I was hoping you‚Äôd be willing to expound on that.
---
No lmao i meant which would be a better replacement
---
Oh yeah, wasn‚Äôt it for a killer called the Teacher? That never got used
---
*yet*
---
Seriously amazes me how incredibly trash and juvenile some of these killers are to simply close app when they're losing.  The entitlement is real.
---
really sums up where abouts in ranking people are.
---
True I knew this looked familiar. I don't think casual clips like this should be taken down if you're not trying to witch Hunt.
---
Yeah, good advice since Oni can fucking z o o m. But that's not my problem, my problem is how they made the ability worse than it already was.
---
Ikr
---
ik you probably already got your answer but please don't use self care. using something like bond / bt / adrenaline are much better options and your team will be thankful
---
So why you on reddit?
---
Non Existent by First Light
---
And I shouldn't be forced to run DS if I don't want to be tunneled. There's always 2 sides to this. I do play killer and I do not have a hard time with DS because I don't tunnel.
---
New Power Ability? ü§î
---
Ah, the preacher has arrived.
---
I wonder if we'll ever see these survivors ever again.
---
Pig and Wraith: I personally LOVE the stealth aspect of being killer. Jumping out and grabbing a survivor on a gen or scaring the crap out of someone not paying attention is my bread and butter!
---
Probably talking about the reverse vacuum that still technically exists.  Monto does it and talks about often.
---
it's all killers
---
Don't "main" a side if you enjoy them both.
---
they're... canadian
---
I love how Trappers design never changed. He‚Äôs been the same since day one.
---
You don't need all the perks to be good as survivor, a lot of it is just skill. Play whomevers perks you like the look of and just go for it. By the time you get the meta crutch perks you'll not need them so they'll compliment your skills and allow you to take bigger chances. 
---
Have fun, as a killer main I find survivor great fun to play and I don't have an the meta perks.
---
Honestly I dont like this idea, I think Left behind is an awful perk by design. Designing a perk to get hatch in and of itself is just toxic, honestly. Going into the game with the hope of your team all dying so you can grab hatch, which isnt even a real win anyways since its basically luck (this perk just increasing the chances of it). I never really see the point of having this perk, it just comes off negative af to me and id rather it not be stronger.  
---
Like, no matter what instead of BT, Adrenaline, Bond, Decisive, etc., or just perks you felt like running that are more niche but still help, you brought left behind, a perk just so you could snag hatch easier. just always came off crummy to me. i dunno
---
No im not using mori,
---
You have no idea how surprised I get as a killer when the exit gate opens up and I see that a survivor actually left as soon as they could. I'm so used to teabagging and clicking that it's the norm for me now.
---
Was that not patched? Wtf
---
ahh, Quebec, my favourite alien planet.
---
It means that your life is Hex: Ruined.
---
yeah I completely forgot it mentioned where Frank was born.
---
it took me 20 minutes to find Jamaica, I'm not putting down that effort.

Infectious Fright is better than you think, considering Legion can injure survivors quickly. What I like to do is hit everyone with my first FF, down a survivor, and see if anyone screams so I can down them quickly as well and apply pressure right off the bat. 
---
Honestly I don't think the changes were that bad. As far as I know, Feral Frenzy was only really useful with Sloppy Butcher and STBFL. I never used Sloppy Butcher, so I can't comment on that, and STBFL just doesn't fit my playstyle. I hate intentionally avoiding a survivor and prefer to keep everyone occupied equally.
---
As for vaulting and speed increases, they make his power MUCH easier to combo now. Before the patch I consistently had trouble catching up with survivors at the edge of my terror radius. Now I can zoom from person to person without a care and start the game off right.
---
Thank you so much.. it was a long and very frustrating journey, one can only take so many teabagging Claudettes! Good luck on yours!!
---
If a survivor opens the gate near a basement, and I down an exit camper then I feel like herding everyone down to the basement and getting at least a 3K is deserved.
---
I'm showing where they were BORN, I don't want to put everyone in Africa because we all came from there. How many generations back should I have gone? Jake is American but is likely from Korean descent.

The killer is amazing and I say this as a survivor. The only thing I think needs a bit of tweaks would be his hillbilly charge because it's so easy to steer but honestly the killer only finds me in unsafe areas with no/used pallets
---
she IS China
---
Missing in frenzy completely depletes the power, the fatigue is longer, normal hits no longer apply status effects from stuff like third seal and sloppy and frenzy is actually slower now
---
I'm showing where they were born, not where they were abducted, otherwise Adam would be in Japan, Legion and Jeff in the same town, Claudette in Montreal ect
---
Lol, thanks
---
Also the closest basement hook in killer shack doesn't work on the new map.
---
Immersed gamer I see
---
Fuck I‚Äôm dumb sorry
---
the map or the diversity of it? I put the map really poorly together so I understand people being upset, the diversity could be larger but as long as I'm getting cool killers and survivors who cares?
---
Freddy, ghosty and oni. Freddy is really strong and you can occasionally pull off some absolute bananas plays that make you feel super cool. Ghosty you can really get into the role with and jump scaring people is always a blast. And oni is like Billy but more fun and easier imo(console peasant :/) and well bonk
---
üò¨ wow uh the other post is worse than your build bruhüòÇüòÇ jk run what u like but ‚Äúmeta‚Äù builds are an exhaustion perk like balanced landing, deadhard that kinda stuff, adrenaline, decisive strike and then something of your choice. I run mettle of man, breakout, selfcare and dead hard to tank hits for people that are getting carried and possibly get them to wiggle out and get my mettle of man. Selfcare to be able to reliably heal up and tank more its good not the best. Its realy good when swf 2 people body block and with my breakout no one gets hooked lol
---
he's behind everyone's head, everyone is from america apparently so it's hard to see.
---
I had to hook a guy today because he couldn't seem to understand that I was looking for the hatch for him. He played a good game and I'm fine with giving hatch to a good player. He kept struggling and wiggling free and trying to loop and pallet stun. After awhile I just decided it was time for a 4K.
---
Thanks I lovehate it
---
I'm showing where they were presumably born, not where their ancestors are from.
---
Ya know, I love the concept of STBFL, but I have to agree: if I bump into the obsession, I‚Äôm not ignoring them, I just can‚Äôt. 
---
I felt like the changes were definitely for the better, but I have very little to go off of in terms of a baseline, so I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was missing something; glad to know I was right!
---
Why pig tho?
---
he roams around America, his birthplace is unknown.
---
I'm having a bunch of connection errors.
---
When I picture the possible fix for this, the image I get includes legion just drop kicking the survivor as they jump over the pallet.
---
Close DBD before you load in
---
Ghostface, His stalk and stealth abilities make me think I'm playing an assassins creed game, it's pretty cool I love him
---
I'm rank 1 surv playing with rank 4~3 friends and the last few days Oni has been the most unfun killer to play against. 
---
His dash is super strong if he is coming and you are not on a loop or alread vaulting a window its an easy one shot and combined with infecious the become a slug monster worst than billy.
---
I love bing bing so much üò≠ I always try to place nice killer, and he just has the best communication system with survivors
---
Then why make the post and say "and wow look at all the variety"?! üòÇ You're the instigator of this dumb-ass thing that people are getting so butthurt about
---
You‚Äôre just the chaotic neutral I needed
---
Maybe you can answer this for me. I played against earlier and I had on that Yui perk where you can lift up pallets. While I was in the dream world I reset a pallet. But later when I passed by while awake there was no pallet. Nor was there a smashed pallet.
---
How can be
---
Saying private school teachers are more important than public school teachers is super pretentious lol
---
Hey its aftercare
---
About the same as always
---
Why bother making this reply if you're not going to answer any of the points?
---
I completely forgot about not needing to worry about missing! 
---
Also, didn‚Äôt they speed up frenzy in the most recent patch? I know it was a bit minuscule (I think like .2m/s), but it definitely *feels* faster. I could also be completely full of shit and way off lol
---
Oni: Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
Bill: NANI
---
so where's the stupid petition? I need to sign it.
---
Hey! Tell your friend that they got some mad fucking talent for me will ya?!
---
so stop running in dead ends and stop hiding in corners against a killer that can see you through walls.
---
Boi did u make this?
---
To be fair, he wasted a crap of time so whatever at that point.
---
I hope that's what they were doing because I was so confused lol. Like it seemed like they were trying to be super organized and tactical, but were failing at it.
---
It was patched, but made a return during plagues chapter if I'm not mistaken
---
Except now its not servers based on the killer. Its dedicated servers. In these videos it is pretty apparent that it is the same person having issues with their laggy internet. If you are going to have bad internet, this is going to happen to you. Regardless of the game you play. There is no "fix" besides getting good internet.
---
yup
---
Can I Dm you with a question
---
imo just make it a body + head piece that costs more, or make the hood down if you dont buy the head piece. i feel like their answer is a huge cop out honestly
---
Speedo. Quentin.
---
Holy shit I thought it was %45 percent...
---
No wonder they were getting off my shoulders so fast.
---
Not in my experience. The amount of ‚Äúgg ez 4K‚Äù messages I‚Äôve gotten and the amount of times I‚Äôve had the killer slam the hatch in my face or smack me on the hook until I die for literally no reason is ridiculous. Maybe it‚Äôs a console thing idk.
---
can people just let that go already jesus, nurse and spirit are still OP as shit, you can still play with your toys. stop acting like they got freddy'ed/legion'ed
---
Ouuuu that sounds kinda awesome, I want to try it out.
---
I always wondered how people had the balls to get right infront of the killer like a blocker and not die.
---
Absolutely yesüëå

Something? As in one singular thing?
---
except for all those times the killer grabs someone off the gens, but they finish it the last second. So the killer gets partial grab animation that ends with the survivor running away.
---
Killer is strong but you add pop and ruin and he's a fucking nightmare.
---
Could be worse. You could be losing a Commodious Toolbox instead
---
Queue tunes vary by rank an region. I have the same problem with survivor
---
Frenzy no longer counts as a standard hit. Meaning it won‚Äôt get save the best for last stacks, remember me stacks, and it won‚Äôt even apply sloppy butcher anymore. Basically any perks that require you to hit the survivor won‚Äôt work with frenzy anymore
---
I'd recommend trapper or wraith for begginners, they have straightforward powers and a re good at teaching you the basics of the game
---
Power not able to oneshot= Killer's garbage :^)
---
His power got a buff, being faster makes it easier to cover all survivors with frenzy in one go, plus Legion pin is busted, if you relied solely on STBFL then go play Demo, that killer can't even lose those stacks.
---
Do people actually trick themselves into thinking Killer is the harder role?  The game gives you extreme aim assist and free hits if the survivor ever vaults through a window.
---
Title that video "How to lose games playing unoptimally".
---
Idk, I don't feel like anyone here wants to do a whole "not to be that guy, but"
---
You're able to 4k with any killer in any game, it depends on what kind of survivors you get that's all
---
I don't think that makes him stronger. He didn't have a hard time catching people with FF, so the buffs aren't anything useful. They also came at the cost of completely removing all of his best builds, and reducing Mend timers to make his power even less impactful.
---
They really need to remove treatment mode it does nothing but hurt doctor.
---
Other killers like Huntress anf Plauge don't need separate mode to use their power so why does doctor need to have one his power doesn't even do any damage.
---
Replace whispers 2 with sloppy 3
---
Freddy too fast? Just wait until every Freddy starts running Nemesis and PWYF
---
F
---
People have also speculated from his last name that he's most likely from Nigeria
---
I dont mind borrowed time, then again i facecamp in the basement with mah chainsaw revved
---
Pressure multiple gens, try to stay awake, and don't die.
---
It was supposedly fixed so idk
---
Oh?
---
I will! Thank you so much, I know he‚Äôll appreciate it.
---
Dont worry i didnt
---
I would actually spend money to buy bikini Bill
---
You can't kill them when they're down. You have to get right up on them while they're running to get the kill prompt.
---

Ann as in Anna? She killed German soldiers in world war 1 as they entered the country, so I put her close to the border.
---
I was lean stalking as Ghost Face and saw a survivor shame another one who missed a skill check. It gave me a pretty good laugh and I decided to mark the shamer instead. 
---
You keep trying your best on that Gen little Dwight, I believe in you.
---
Skillchecks while on the hook would be much better. Great checks restore hook progress (But not back to Stage 1), good checks award points, and failures regress faster.
---
Boom, you've just removed suiciding on the hook and the awful carpal-tunnel inducing struggle mechanic. Devs.
---
LMFAO the limping looks hilarious
---
New players that don‚Äôt understand bbq yet or aren‚Äôt familiar with advanced tactics
---
Swf is relevant because a swf will know that he immediately goes straight for new player after each hook. If a solo player sees this he won‚Äôt know for sure, but 4 people all seeing it seems to confirm it. 
---
Only a swf will know if he got lucky or actually has wall hacks. Of course we know it‚Äôs bbq but hey don‚Äôt cause they are new

And vacuum vaults

Oni in a tutu

Trapper is from Seatlle, it says so in the first entry of the archives. Herman is a german name, but Carter is a name typically used by african americans in the south.
---
I‚Äôve done it before...
---
Also that‚Äôs not the only wacky thing going on here - tuft of hair sustains T3 indefinitely, but you can see when I zoom in that the timer is going down.
---
I mean, they decided to completely change how deep wound works just because of how Nemesis interacted with feral frenzy, so that doesn't sound so crazy.
---

Anyone who buys this is a massive creed, also where is my topless David body pillow ?

it's the geography of Canada, I got lazy and just thought S N O W so I put him north like the dumbass I am

I‚Äôve noticed issues still as well.

My first game after the patch, I earned 2 though my challenge didn‚Äôt count them.

The following game, I only got all golds and I still got credit for one.

It‚Äôs very weird, I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm done with it.
---
*cough* the thing
---
I've had survivors run right into me in that tall grass just using Ghost Face's power.
---
I just started playing about a month ago and it seems like it's almost too easy when there isn't ruin.
---
How about gstring bill

33 seconds healing, or 33 seconds doing a gen,
---
yes yes I know, I thought I put him there but my software must have fucked it when I moved my mouse

Hex: No One Escapes This Game

I woulda jumped tbh
---
That's just a visual thing. Once the timer runs down you'll still be in tier 3. And while you can use a mori on a downed survivor, you can't use the tombstone on one.

Jake is clearly American, he has so many patriotic outfits. Jane is of Latina race, but was still likely Born in America
---
I‚Äôve used him twice in red ranks since the update and have gotten merciless killer both times with 0 add ons. Be really doesn‚Äôt feel nerfed
---
Wait y BBQ?
---
I guess my experience is biased since I rarely play survivor so I'm encountering 4 new people every match. Just browsing around here and the DBD forums, I get the feel that survivors tend to whine and grief a lot more.
---
Ohhh yes baby
---
you say decent like asian horror isn't the scariest thing out there.
---
Its true though, killer is for those who want a challenge and survivor is for those who want to relax
---
I think people should be doing trapper and killer as well as survivor challenges so mains for killer have to play a different killer they're not use to. Open up there eyes to a different experience same for survivor to experience the game through the eyes of a killer a little bit more.
---
he's from Seattle
---
I honestly couldn't say. I almost never play survivor so I don't know if there's any interaction between the two. Sounds like a weird bug to me, though.

It's not enough nerf legion more /s
---
Legion. They're the best even if they get nerfed into Oblivion repeatedly. I really like Frank's story and even though their ability is hot garbage I enjoy being a speed demon and nosediving over pallets and through windows.
---
No it not good not a all
---
Bruh imagine doctor with all his different ailments
---
Personally, I don't the powers are *necessarily* the issue, but the length he has them for and the control he has over them are what causes them to be an issue.
---
Maybe if it was something like a compulsory activation as soon as the bar filled up, or something.

there are steam boats in Africa?

Oni scares the shit out of me. I don't fuck around with him
---
Did she show you her rusty shackles?
---
Ever since the oni came out, i‚Äôve noticed people with actually decent internet have started to come back to play killer. I usually play any lobby with 150 ping or lower but i get so many 200+ lobbies that i‚Äôm usually in queue for 15-30 mins dodging and searching for anything lower than 200.

The new map basically.

It's literally the last survivor challenge I have left

That tall grass has to be a pain, I imagine; it's brighter in that area but the foliage seems even worse than the other Yamaoka map.
---
Lol yea its not that hard u just gotta make sure if ur alone u take one hit then dissapear to heal up other wise u will end up dying too
---
she moved when she was a teenager, which is why she rebelled.
---
Even though they‚Äôre rough I like the injured and crawling animations better than the current ones. Like why are survivors holding there ribs and running janky? Also, the current dying state animation looks like you‚Äôre doing a army crawl rather than struggling to walk.
---
Pants less one ?

Lmao how

I'm not filing formal complaints, just pointing out details on a silly map

The RBT slapping itself on you while you were healing killed me XD

There are rank 1 survivors that don't understand how BBQ and chili works.
---
Like granddaughter, like ancient demonic ancestor.
---
I don't mind the perks its just killers who camp or use ebony mori and finish the game in like 5mins (exaggerating) it's like "hook survivor" "unhook survivor" then kill. I know the offering is in the game but why do people have to end the game so quickly?
---
Claudette is Canadian
---
I didn‚Äôt know that was posted but oh well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It really isn‚Äôt that serious, if they are lucky enough to get off then I‚Äôll let them go since it rarely happens.
---
Poor baby hag.
---
Power not being able to oneshot = killers well rounded and balanced and fun for both sides. Legion really isn't that. The ability seems useless sometimes, and just to keep legion down BHVR keeps buffing Borrowed Time as well. What the power was intended for in their first design is long gone. The added movement speed isn't shit.
---
bruh
---
Well in the higher ranks (5 - 1) you usually wont escape with randoms due to the randomness of your teammates that get put together. Often you'll find yourself being the last one alive and dead on your first hook because everyone else died already. A reliable perk for this kind of situation would be a blessing since you recieve somewhat of a chance, even with an awful team.
---
"Yui i need you to teach me how to drift"
---
The devs handed it out to everyone
---
Can confirm am Legion main. Me stab survivor too often make cool down 10 second
---
Ironically all of those on as much would make the king worthless
---
Or maybe don't unhook right infront of the killer idk just an idea
---
**everyone liked this**
---
What challenge were you doing? It barely shows on the screen before the video cuts off.

That is pretty fair actually

I love how you got downvoted for telling facts about this game.

That challenge sounds hard. I'm not looking forward to it.
---
You say this yet he slaughters almost every game. So what is it. Survivors can win no matter what they do or tru3 will win while complaining with a "low tier" killer almost every game?
---
Quentin will never get anything ever
---
Still don't see realism in people being afraid of BBQ. BBQ is one of the healthiest perks for the meta because it encourages the killer to go away from the hook.
---
yeah i really had to blend for it, good luck Ôºº(^-^)Ôºè
---
Honestly it was fine, I just think it's funny that it's so jumbled
---
This is would be so much better with ‚ÄúBenny Hill chase music‚Äù
---
This build can be optimised by replacing Deja Vu with DS and just use game sense to avoid a three gen.
---
It's because I cut out any unnecessary filler to fit it under a minute. He was clicking his flashlight and teabagging right outside the gate right before I activated Demon Mode where you can see his scratch marks and you can actually hear him clicking his flashlight in this video but the music overtakes it a little.
---
Ah, makes sense
---
It's perfectly ok to admit you hear this meme in your head.
---
New prayer beads buff looks interesting.
---
Was not aware bugs still existed. its just seems way more common lately.
---
Sensitivity?
---
It‚Äôs all good. This game brings out the devil in all of us. Blame the Almighty Entity. :)
---
Spirit because no one likes me either
---
Clearly you just suck at the game, but gud.
---
I found there's a way to fix it but you need trapper to trap you while you're stuck so poor demo here is outta luck
---
This deserves to go in the survivor clip hall of fame
---
God Bless MERICA!
---
Due to limited sensitivity settings on console you can‚Äôt turn as hard with Oni, thus making him worthless against half decent survivors who can just 360 since you literally can‚Äôt turn that far
---
Do you play on console or...?
---
everyone should have a shirtless alt

Or just make a macro.

Yikes that looks terrible

the entity is a boomer

Not with that attitude
---
That glitch happened to a friend of mine. Even the end game collapse wouldn‚Äôt kill her. She ended up having to DC, her and Freddy were stuck like that for over 20 minutes
---
What's clear about it?
---
I got this too, new bug? At least this time it‚Äôs not game breaking
---
Yup, I play mostly Billy, Hag, and Freddy in that order. Doesn't matter that much, but I don't use ruin on any of those three.
---
The start of a great porno! I imagine it went down something like this:
---
You: Yo dude let's break into the Hag's apartment!
---
Friend: Ok man. I want first dibs on cleansing that hex!
---
*enter apartment*
---
You: Let's check the bedroom. Its gotta be there.
---
Friend: Ok but let's hurry it up this place creeps me out.
---
*enter Hag's bedroom*
---
Hag: Oh hai boys! Came to cleanse my hex have you!?
---
You: Yes ma'am.
---
Friend: I get first dibs!
---
Hag: Calm down boys you'll get your chance! Now put on these Rusty Shackles!
---
You: Yes Miss Hag.
---
Friend: Can I cleanse the hex now?
---
Hag: Yes! But first let me cleanse YOUR totem!
---
Friend: Ah hell yeah!
---
*queue shitty porn music*
---
Especially if you have one of those fancy "infinity" scroll wheels.
---
It also can promote the opposite since a lack of visible auras makes you believe those other survivors are close by, so the killer has no reason to leave the area.
---
I do mean that change specifically, but his gameplay is basically just completely neutral now once every survivor is injured (or the one you are chasing already is). You can't chase better, your power doesn't help or encourage the use of any kind of off meta m1 killer perks. The deep wound status is largely irrelevant as a slowdown mechanic, and completely useless as a downing mechanic. So yea, he feels more bland than ever and I struggle to justify his power when it can't close out kills nearly as effectively as other killers.
---
Basically, going really fast to injure a couple of survivors but guarentee they can get to a safe loop or heal up by leaving them/stunning yourself is generally worse then every other killer.
---
Shirtless clown
---
I think it probably sucks for both sides. I hate that map mostly because I can't see shit. A survivor runs off through the grass and I'm in there blindly swinging away sometimes.
---
it's a joke?

i play on console as well and those three are super easy, your point?
---
when i say everyone i mean everyone. let me see clowns moobs
---
Like I said before, I actually made this video for a FB group to fit it in their video limit guidelines of 1 min, but it happens right before I go into Demon Mode where you can see his scratch Mark's at the entrance so I cut any unnecessary filler, but you can actually hear him clicking his flashlight in this cut, but the music overtakes the clicking of the flashlight lol. I guess I could upload a music-less, extended cut that includes that part if I can.
---
Yeah I think they need to fix the rank criteria when finding people to load in. If the queue doesn't find people your rank, it will search for anyone within 6 ranks above or below you. You unfortunately got completely screwed by the queue
---
Shitty quality hurt head
---
I think it looks cute.
---
im honestly shocked kindred is not base kit yet.
---
Git gud
---
That was fast. It's been 3 days!
---
Oddly this isn't the first post I've seen today of a Demogorgon behaving like a survivor
---
Yeah sorry about that
---
They gave a bunch of cosmetics out to everyone check around the DBD website for the announcement
---
Both are toxic af
---
Made with mematic btw
---
No, not kicking gens is a legitimate strategy as it just wastes time. Just play Billy and snowball.
---
my apologies stormsoul22 as this man isn‚Äôt very big brain, please ignore him and proceed with your day (¬∞_¬∞)

This is not a problem that is exclusive to switch. Also mo one cares.

If you stop plundering before its complete you will close it. If you stop plundering and run away the lid will drop making a notification.

Already did
---
The animation bugged, he doesn't
---
Oh ok, I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the clarification.
---
I think this is the right step! Allowing to see the loudout of your team mates would make the life of solo survivors much easier!
---
That is the only time a dc is justified
---
Holy shit these P3 outfits are a real let down
---
This might be too much. But I really think they should bring back the ability to see other survivors ranks in the lobby. Probably one of the best qol features the game, sucks they removed it
---
Thanataphobia/Dying Light was his best build and is still his best build.  On-hit perks still work since he still needs to use M1 to down folks.
---
Grinding 30 protection hits is annoying me a lot especially since it only seems to count them when you‚Äôre not injured n take a hit

Do you just search up users and judge everything possible

wow you‚Äôre quite the negative one, leave a man to his concerns would you
---
Idk if this is as weird as having a dream where you're trying to explain to your mom the plot of MLP. That was a weird dream.
---
Finally someone who can think of a good fix
---
Surprised no one has said Jane
---
So just like billy? Or worse?
---
Oh shit lmao. Your the same person as the pikachu face. No I sort through new. And when I see a shitty meme I tell them how shitty it is. Make better memes
---
Now the Oni will produce a vibe check to those survivor
---
I play red rank legion. It‚Äôs not impossible
---
To be honest. I would absolutely love this in a Solo game hey. If I'm in survive with friends that won't really matter because we can just ask each other but this would be an amazing step for solo survivors. So you know what to expect. If you go into a game and you see that no one brought borrowed time you know that if somebody comes to try to save you from a hook you might want to use them as a meat Shield because they didn't come prepared to save from a hook camp
---
what happends if i see a gen in 90% or i don't use billy also i got stuck with lockers
---
If you ask me, Fire Up is where it‚Äôs at. Going through vaults faster, breaking pallets faster, picking survivors up faster, it‚Äôs really underrated but very useful. If you pair it up with Bamboozle or Brutal Strength, it‚Äôs very powerful. It‚Äôs not a slowdown perk, but while they get Gens done it also gives you more power. It‚Äôs a very nasty perk
---
Ive seen it more often with survs tho
---
I've been getting this for a while, so I just don't play killer anymore.
---
Yep ain't nothing like going against the meta
---
I'm going to agree with that
---
Nothing BHVR could add now a days will ever be as scary as those animations omg.
---
For real though, I'm tired of hearing people cry about about how their hardware someone makes a killer worse. You know this well in advance to buying new dlc, it's not some new surprise you weren't aware of. Play on PC or get over it already.
---
Wow your comment history is a cesspool of negativity.
---
Really depends on the situation I suppose.
---
I love it!
---
This has to be oversaturated content at this point. Idk how many of these posts I have seen of this shitty totem spot. Yes we get it there isa totem spot
---
Play Billy or prepare for endgame I guess, if a gen is at 90% it's probably gone anyways unless you have pop.
---
It's perfectly strong
---
Not really. If I‚Äôm last and they get me, I just stop playing. 
---
I don‚Äôt really care at that point.
---
I fucking love this your friend is awesome
---
Fair enough
---
Yeah it's fair to say that his granddaughter taught him a few things
---
I tell him every day at work that he‚Äôs the best of us and we don‚Äôt deserve him
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm on hook, can someone please rescue me‚Äù Demodogo shreds himself halfway across the map to save you. 
---
‚ÄúCan someone come heal me‚Äù Demodogo runs at you on all fours to come heal you.
---
Yeah. I mean they are just getting like an extra 500 points or so. 
---
Unless im running adrenaline with a key... then it‚Äôs meme lols all the way.
---
What the fuck is this gay shit, ur a fucken homo delete this post u dumb motherfucker
---
It's because most of the people playing this game on Switch are 8-year-olds that are too scared to get hit at all. Basically every game that's online and involves fighting on the Switch has this problem. My friend, who actually has a Switch, says it's super annoying to do anything because his teammates are hiding all over trying not to get touched.
---
They‚Äôre giving them away

He looks like he needs a nice cup of joe now with the second one, but it would add to the chuckle factor when I play him
---
That shouldn't be a valid way to "try and win" though, it's just sitting in front of the hook staring at the other player until they die. And, it's not a punishment, it's just moderate discouragement(slowing down the hook phase speed or giving them a sprint burst when being unhooked if the killer is close is different from instantly de-ranking and temp banning them like some other people would want). Although I do respect different play styles and strategies, I've never seen anybody in all my time playing this game say they were using a "bait strategy" when I asked them why they were staring at me until I died.  
---
And, if you're not completely inconsiderate, making sure your fun isn't at the expense of others should be a pretty easy thing to do(this is coming from a person who plays both sides equally).  
---
But thanks for the Kindred suggestion, I usually run it anyway but most people who have a different opinion are too salty to come up with a real solution and just say "shut up entitled survivor main lmaoooo xd, fucking moron".
---
I play on pc, PS4 and switch. It‚Äôs definitely happens quite often on the switch.  I have 4000 hours on pc and PS4 and have been playing the switch for a few weeks now. You must be one of the hiders and don‚Äôt like being called out! 
---
They should show at the end of the match how each player contributed.
---
That is true, he does give off quite a glow
---
True, I didnt think about that
---
I've had times where it worked and other times where it flopped. It really just depends how far away from the hook the survivor got downed
---
 F**K IT LET EVERYONE BE NAKED
---
To counter fake pallets you can camp the fake pallet (if you know or think it is) an then freddy will usually swing thru bc he knows its fake so then time it right dont drop the pallet and just dead hard or run away when he swings
---
No
---
if i dont get to see jeff's thundercock i will uninstall
---
Survivor rules be like: When you hook a survivor you need to run all the way to the other corner of the map and then sit in the corner until we complete a generatorüò§üò§üò§
---
Well shit, when you put it that way, there's no reason to hit anyone because they could possibly make it to a pallet.
---
Damn! He went down like a sack of bricks.
---
You guys got a tutorial?
---
Also, I don't think the killer should lose BP, I'd never wish that upon killers or survivors because the BP grind is hard.
---
Well if evidence is going by our own words and experiences i can pretty much write you an 80 page essay analysis and a doctorate about rank 1 legion and why your 'diverse' build would be anything but effective.
---
The legion's build choices are indeed narrower now. You do realize up front that you lose PWYF stacks by using feral frenzy? This works for nothing but a zoomy boi meme you can do as he sprints. You literally undo a 3 stack work that averages a precious minute if you are lucky in a single power use. So you would rather m1? Frenzy, find the obsession, nope the fuck out? How stupid do you think they will be at that rank?
---
What do you need bamboozle for? Extra vault speed? He still eats a fat stun if your excuse is to vault insta cancel your attack. Its not like after you vault the survivor at minimum has about 5 seconds of safe time to be downed. Extra vault speed is useless in your power. It was over nerfed, now its fine. I used to run it to catch up and simplify vault jukes, now its useless. So would you rather be an m1 killer to gain advantage over it per say?
---
Same deal but worse with fire up. M1.
---
I ran terror radius legion builds, I ran sneaky legion builds, I ran anti swf builds, psuedo plague builds, and possibly everything inbetween now. If you want an m1 legion run STBFL, Enduring, Spirit Fury and Infectious Fright or something inbetween.
---
All these changes do is make him more unorthodox and crippled. Now its even more of a meme to use Franklins' as well i believe. Not sure if it hits the quota but id assume as much. Imagine buffing someone who has one leg and an arm. Thats the legion's treatment right now. He is in a sprinting competition with a """buff""" leg and an arm, yet here you are saying wearing roller skates is viable now. Nay, claiming its backed up as hard evidence.
---
No science fairs for you this week boy genius.
---
Watch the killer's stain and just learn distance and position if he goes either way to respond.
---
Some pallets I would reccomend throwing early if killer has a LOS break on you. The particular pallet is the pallet gym. I would throw it early as it is unsafe/semi-safe before it is thrown and safe after it is thrown. The short side can be looped on all maps excluding Autohaven's version but you have to play it perfect or you're getting hit.
---
I've been accused of cheating a couple times, all of which involve lockers. once I saw someone actively getting in a locker while bbq was active, they said I was cheating. once I saw someone sprint around a corner into a long hallway, scratchmarks end right in front of the locker. I was cheating, couldn't of seen him from that far apparently.
---
Paid actor. They are giving you the door; you just fail to see it and think they are playing seriously. Hence why they don't attack you at 0:05.

---
To be honest, I‚Äôve heard that the laggy ones are the ones who end up victorious in chases, mainly if they are the killer. I‚Äôm just going off that is all.
---
100% Ruin is such a crutch perk that it will never leave the meta.
---
it's normal i got stuck between gens if i kick them
---
Wonder how long it'll be before mods lock/remove this thread for exposing the toxicity they promote
---
oh man i haven‚Äôt watched demi in so long sorry lmao
---
If you need 3 slowdown perks to win games consistently, it's you that is underperforming. Many streamers, like Scorpionz, are perfect examples of how you don't need that many slowdown perks if you're actually very good at killer.
---
Kind which Micheal was that tall
---
As a Hag main, mint rag is more of a gimmick add-on. There are some situations where it is stronger than base kit, but I think she has stronger add-ons. But idk, I don't use mint rag very often because I don't need it.
---
Bruh. 940
---
Assert your dominance by blinking behind the gate

Ive already explained that I am a GIRL and I don't want to see drawn half naked dead children. I don't know if she's under 18 or not and I'm not a fan of the Spirit's half naked mummified design in the first place. I think she'd be a lot more creepy without it. Like some of her cool not-half naked cosmetics.
---
Well, this happens with every killer.
---
And most dlc characters on any game really, just this game has  two clearly divided groups
---
Fuck that.
---
The last thing I need at 2 AM is loading into a game and everyone starts running after me with No Mither. I wouldn't sleep for a week.
---
It‚Äôs possible I just have really bad luck when it comes to killers or maybe they just presume I‚Äôm toxic because I usually use p3 claudette or mask Feng/Nea but I‚Äôm on the verge of quitting the game because it‚Äôs becoming unplayable for me. I mean I wait a good 10-20 minutes for a match, load in, get one good chase and then get smacked on the hook until I die. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a whole lot of red rank killers on console though because I‚Äôm rank 3 yet I‚Äôm constantly matched with rank 8-12 killers.
---
I would love a game like that lol im always getting red rank killers
---
And screaming "Get fucked" while doing it
---
I'd rather keep the 115 movespeed. Their power has never been good enough to justify their release 110.
---
Odd, but noted. I'd assume that's the exception that proves the rule. I know most regions have been seeing a steady decline, but I'll admit I haven't seen or heard about Oce much.
---
"Haha self care bad bond good"
---
Would be cool to have the black meg and white claudette back as cosmetics to be honest. Like a throwback skin.
---
What rank are you? I haven't been above 9 or so for a while because of school
---
I just hate being limited as to what i do. I can stand Plague a little more but hag is my most hated killer. I dont run urban bc there are so many better perks and i dont always have a flash light on. Having me crouch walk (isnt it like 20% movement speed) all over the goddamn map just so i dont accidentally step into her trap really bugs me
---
I play hag using pop instead of Ruin in red ranks and win most my matches so idk what to tell you. She's not going to win against the best of the best, but even Billy isn't good enough to beat the top 1%. I do know most people do not know how to play her correctly though which is probably why you think she needs another buff.
---
Multiple people on this thread assumed I'm a teenage boy who has a problem with this being a drawn half naked boy. It's fucking ridiculous.
---
Lol im rank 3
---
You still come off as a fucking loser bro. You knew what I meant but instead of arguing the point you argued the words I used. That makes you a real asshole
---
What perks and add ons do you use?
---
Gotta test this myself.
---
Report it here  [https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
---
Hag is supposed to have a hard skill cap because of her slow movement speed. But once you‚Äôve mastered how to use her power she can snowball really well.
---
Map control + small terror radius &amp; teleportation = gg
---
Best way to counter hag is to wait for her to pick someone up then pop all her traps.
---
He kinda quirky tho
---
Yup. Basically every match. Took me a few games to notice.
---
Hmm ok, I just feel bad throwing pallets sometimes because I don‚Äôt want my team to get mad at me
---
I mean the only ones who play diffrent on pc would be nurse and Oni, i dont see any other killer having an advantage by being able to turn faster. 
---
Its just like For honor, split down the middle. (Except its not really, Most people play on console yet its balanced around pc.)
---
But.. that‚Äôs impossible
---
Cool.
---
Its been getting annoying to me, i hate repetitive noises
---
Click left mouse button
---
It is quite annoying, but I'm sure it'll be fixed.
---
Damn. I have zero confidence with the report system as a killer I reported (with video evidence of them lag switching and admitting to it post game chat) has never been penalized and it's been years at this point. Hopefully this person gets banned though.
---
My general goto build is Pop, STBFL, Franklin's Demise, and my flex slot however I usually run Sloppy because people like healing against Hag. As for add-ons I just use whatever but the add-ons that increase the distance hag can teleport and setting time are her best general add-ons, most of hag' s add-ons are pretty solid imo though.
---
Most maps you can get away with throwing the pallet, break Los, then run away.
---
I mean I‚Äôll try but that doesn‚Äôt sound feasible
---
One game I think I was a rank 15 or 16 killer and I had a rank 1, 2 and, I think 2 rank 3 or 4s
---
Shoulda just let her stay at the first exit I guess...
---
Ahh yes the ol' whirly whirly *miss* trick. That is a good one indeed!
---
&gt; bbq
---
&gt; challenge
---
I play killer and I refuse to use this annoying ass perk
---
Killers already lose points if they're close to a hook and there's no survivors nearby.  They don't lose bloodpoints they had before the game, but they do lose points that would otherwise earn bloodpoints in that game.
---
Me to, survivor takes along time killer is almost instant. Rank 8-10 killer for me and 10 survivor
---
i did report him in game and then reported his steam acc too. he has 2 vbans on his account, so he's done this before sadly..
---
Majority of ps4 players are 12 lmao. These kids are probably the result of not being able to keep up with their friends in fortnite and they're looking for a game to be good at to increase their self esteem.
---
Well to take away some anger I recommend you take your focus off Nurse
---
For sure, I‚Äôve got the username on the og screenshot so I‚Äôm keeping my eyes peeled
---
Now imagine someone putting way too much time and effort into making these look spot on. Where the artists at ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

also thanks for link, i've reported through there as well &lt;3
---
https://i.imgur.com/6dDzvrR.png
---
This happens way too much in this game.
---
Why are people spamming these matchmaking screenshots again? 
---
This one is not even outside of the expected match ups of 6 ranks up and down.
---
it wasnt a custom game?? we died.... i was spectating cant you see. literally watch my vod if you dont believe me, holy shit ppl are so quick to assume people are lying.. baffles me
---
Yea, I feel naked without it.
---
It comes in handy a lot with the new EGC, but even before that I loved it. 
---
It saved me from an infinite Tombstone Myers as Nea once, and that 3~ish seconds less saved me quite a few other times since.
---
I'm referring to what you said earlier about me having no issue with little girl's crotches hanging out. You're part of the problem I'm having right now. People acting like I'm a pedo or weird teenage boy because I don't think something someone drew looks very appropriate
---
That‚Äôs fucking terrifying
---
Similar things keep happening to me im rank 13 killer yet i get rank 1 and 2 survivor team sometimes even swf lol completly shows how ranks are weirdly broken
---
I usually get caught before I can reach a pallet or, assuming I hit the pallet just right, the killer catches up to me like nothing.
---
I have had a few good chases every now and then, but it's usually because the killer is bad at chasing (keeps getting caught on corners, mind games themselves, etc.).  I do better more consistently when I bolt around a corner, stop running, and hide before the killer gets around the corner.

So... Re-use the original tome 4 challenges?

Jooes on yiu its a shroud.

Exactly, I was wondering why they were being so argumentative with me and then I look at their comment history and they bitch and and insult everyone.
---
Kindred is soooooo good now.
---
Explanation please?
---
When will there be a patch that fixes killers getting stuck to gens LIKE I AM RIGHT NOW WHILE WRITING THIS....
---
When the survivors walk they look like teabaging while walking wtf
---
Its even better when yiu can see it.
---
They can hear teleports anywhere on the map. The sound is faint.
---
Did it
---
Ok obviously you'll be getting all reds lol
---
I like how all of the raving in the comments proves the memes point
---
Bruh indeed
---
There's different opinions, and then there's borderline class wars between players.
---
as we can se here a squadette defending his little child from the natural predators
---
Judging by your comment history and you starting shit with me and acting like I'm a pedo for not agreeing morally with a drawing, just goes to show how unlikable you are. Definitely getting blocked. I don't want to have interactions with you anymore.
---
Use an exhaustion perk then, or use spine chill to know you need to move earlier.
---
 üòÇ ik but id still love a 10+ rank killer
---
To ridicule and debase my fellow man.
---
I‚Äôm this way with survivor. I try way harder and have a shit ton of better perks but every once and a while I play killer strictly just for fun. I don‚Äôt even bother leveling (I know that sounds awful but I‚Äôm like rank 13 so I can get away with it). I was playing trapper all day today and I have him at level fuckin 6 lmaoooo
---
The Entity is a giant spider and Australia has a lot of giant spiders therefore DBD is actually a pocket dimension in Australia.
---
This simple fix would make using him and nurse a lot better with nurse you can't turn fast enough post blink to catch survivors right behind her
---
He's been keeping track of info so he can back up what he says
---
This looks like you guys were all tea bagging at the exit and got smacked down. I don't know what I'm looking at.
---
Survivors: Do you remember double blade legion and Killers using Bond?  BEcAUSe I dO.
---
Not as bad as Nancy‚Äôs
---
Idk if you're joking but scratch marks (you were probably joking tho)
---
Good thing I don‚Äôt use it as a crutch perk I kill at least two survivors before all 5 gens are done
---
Elaborate.
---
I am the killer lmao
---
Me waiting for my dad to wake up so I can tell him I threw up in the bed
---
Who has the time to play 20 matches a day, if you add the queue times to that, you‚Äôd never sleep lol
---
well he's from Calgary, but I put him in the wrong place, Susie, Julie and Joey are all likely from Ormond.
---
Up your killer sensitivity to 100. Makes a world of difference.
---
Well it's not a team game, but it's pretty toxic in it's own right. Overwatch imo is up there with the worst though.
---
It's working fine for me.. did u try unaccepting and reaccepting the challenge?
---
Idk, a lot of what you said made sense and all, but as they say ‚Äúdeath is not an escape‚Äù
---
What rank
---
yes, I put her in Quebec, where she is confirmed to be from.
---
True, so maybe they just have to learn to live üòå
---
Apologies, didn't mean to convey it that way - just meant that someone's reason was that and how they supported camping in that situation.
---
At what point in DBD‚Äôs long history of changes would you say it was it‚Äôs most fun/enjoyable?

This is 100% hacking you must have been using the crows are my friends hack. Next thing they'll be reporting people for having an outfit they don't have
---
Well there are a lot of American characters, but I'm not attempting to start a riot and change it.
---
Rank 8s-10s I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs top tier but he‚Äôs not weak
---
Toxic survivors be like
---
He's just Billy with more build up for ability and better tracking.
---
I only taunt super toxic killers. Otherwise ya fuck the survivors who do that.
---
Yes, I've been having issues as well :(
---
Oni hit with his power, he dashed to me so I curved around the haybale but his hit just phase through the corner and it hit me although he couldn't even see me at that point. (At least on my screen that's what it looked like)
---
Bikini jane ... ? :3
---
Better than the Mona Lisa
---
Unparalleled tracking.
---
noed isn‚Äôt bad if you don‚Äôt have many perks yet, but i‚Äôd eventually switch it out. at lower ranks it‚Äôs something that is super helpful for killers who are learning but at higher ranks it is for killers who couldn‚Äôt kill them otherwise, it‚Äôs literally written in the perk description. but you‚Äôre not bad for using it right now. 
---
just ignore the hate, it always comes in this community. eventually i‚Äôd recommend swapping noed for a gen regression perk.
---
So what that guy posted sure- but it‚Äôs simple just imagine someone trying so hard at something they sweat.  Minus all that survivor hate it‚Äôs just a term you can dominate for tryhard.
---
Holy shit! One hour?!
---
I just seriously cant even play that map anymore. It's just so unfun I'm legit just gonna DC when I get it. And I dont even do that for any other map. Most of the games I have played on the map I do pretty well. It's just fucking boring.
---
I'm guessing your next post is going to be about how Billy needs a nerf?
---
Hmm it‚Äôs cool to hear long time players point of view, I‚Äôd also be interested in what you think was the worst time in DBD history. As for new additions, I‚Äôm still waiting for Pinhead and Chucky. Two huge horror icons
---
Bikini everyone. If they were wise and truly wanted money they would just go all in
---
ok?
---
You could say that about a lot of killers but his power is very strong once you get it. And you could probably guard 3 gens with him pretty easy
---
Ok
---
Dwight's kind of an asshole fuck em

no killer ‚Äúneeds‚Äù ruin yeah, but billy can easily play without it and with hag it takes the extra work. hag has no early game pressure, billy has tons of it. also good hag players still won‚Äôt have the map pretense of billy. billy can move entirely across the map whenever he wants. hag has got 110 speed and can only teleport if the survivors misstep, and still only then it‚Äôs a limited range. to get from point a to point b as hag requires moving at 110 unless survivors at the area you are going get trapped. billy can move super fast, whenever he wants. and like i said earlier, the early game pressure is very important. hag has no early game pressure
---
honestly, by the time the survivor gets hit + the time it takes to get back to the hook.. the killer won‚Äôt be standing there for very long at all. just taking the stun is super common as well if the area is safe enough (no loops they can get to immediately.)
---
Ohh okay so t's an addon that makes stealth nearly impossible and unable to be countered without niche builds. Cool. Still broken.  
---
Blood orbs are absorbed by them in the process of filling their power, that being said, it's unlikely there are too many orbs to follow a trail to a survivor at any given time.  
---
Vaulting through things being invalidated entirely is bullshit, when it is one of the few ways one can avoid their charge outside of tight loops.   
---
Cool, and unless the loops are tight enough, you're liable to get hit with a flick of his power when activating the hit.
---
he was changed, and he is good now. his tracking is good, but is it really that hard to work around it? his insta down ability isnt that hard either, he has been out for a few days and i have been able to learn a few ways to avoid it.
---
This post is dumb, its an insult to every spirit out there.
---
Every damn time. I don't get why they even spawn next to eachother.
---
You just have to find someone and hit them once. That's not hard to do as you know they'll be by an exit gate... It does give free kills or at least free downs. You had all game to kill these survivors and you didn't and you now have the power to 1 shot them.
---
Because they tend to do generators as fast as possible (with Adrenaline, Decisive, Borrowed and so on) so if you get one down with noed, they tend to get mad because..."How could you down me? Dont you see we made 5 generators in less than 5 minutes, you are obligated to let us escape and watch us to Tbag at the exit gates and flashlight click spam".
---
Lol It will be fun to watch all the whiners herd and flock under this post.
---
I mean I‚Äôve Kobed in the killers face while being fscrcamped like 7 times today but ok
---
Found the survivor.
---
nea in a cat maid outfit
---
yeh i went to his steam account and he has 1 vban and 1 game ban, so he's a known hacker. i've reported to dbd and to steam so hopefully he gets whats deserved. im over hackers, i honestly have no idea how this makes it fun for them.. if anything it'djust be boring..
---
ah shit, that was me sorry xD
---
You have a very interesting world.
---
Hm alright. Would it make sense to camp my hex for a bit if I run ruin?
---
Sacrifice 5 survivors must be done in a single trial.
---
Lol facts
---
You mean the same console that renders nurse and huntress fairly unplayable most times? Good luck with that. Consoles are the red headed stepchild of this game.
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. All you have to do is use left behind, a key, open handed, iron will/quick&amp;quiet/urban evasion/exhaustion perk, and of course spine chill. Then just hide around the map and go into lockers until the last teammate dies. That‚Äôs a very scummy way to do it but it‚Äôs pretty much a guarantee. Do that or just join a swf and gen rush and hope you don‚Äôt go against a godly killer.
---
Id take Monstrous Shrine over the garbo exhaustion any day. If I hook someone in the basement monstrous does something, the 3 sec exhaustion never does anything.
---
No because Billy has balance to his power, requiring one to actually think about the path they are using when charging so they don't hit walls and such, and ending the charge ends your movement and your ability to charge.   
---
You can stop charging on demand and still continue a charge later with the Oni and walls don't stop you, so you can recklessly continue on through places billy would not be able to otherwise.
---
I'll have to see if I have it! That sounds like a fun perk
---
Well, you cant expect a console player be decent with something that involves aim, its just how it is, you cant expect be precise with a controller
---
Plug walk
---
Ok for sure. Thanks for the insight
---
Awesome drawing dude
---
That literally happened to me last night
---
If only I had all those perks on the same survivor.
---
in this situation you have one person down which is already putting pressure on the team and another who just did a hook save + most likely injured if the killer got back fast enough. it‚Äôll be kinda rare to see the others just pushing through gens like that in solo queue. plus the killer could be doing something slightly useful like refilling hatchets, kicking a gen, chasing another survivor, breaking a pallet etc.
---
valid point though.. gen speeds are a bit too fast.
---
I would hardly call ruin and bbq a challenge considering they're probably used to playing against them now.
---
His hitbox is so big it's like the old times at pallets. You actually gain distance because his pathway is that much longer
---
That's not the issue. It's the fact that the sensitivity is way too slow. The max sensitivity on console is not even half of what it is on PC. Precision isn't the issue.
---
It depends on the situation, sometimes survivors are so determined to cleanse they‚Äôll just hover around the totem and wait for an opportunity. But if you camp it and nobody comes then you‚Äôve given the survivors free gen progress.
---
That's the crux of the issue, billy needs to make a choice and risk ending their charge early, Oni can continuously charge, as well as postpone and re-up the charge whenever.  
---
That, and the unmitagatable trail of blood orbs makes tracking trivial, even without perks to aid in it as most others need.
---
The only thing Quentin needs is some fucking sleep my man let my man rest damnit
---
She‚Äôs already a 110% move speed killer though.
---
The addon makes it so the survivor can see blood orbs and if they touch them the are revealed for 3 seconds.
---
Play oni and see how many blood orbs just lay around because you‚Äôre full on your power and they just sit around uncollected.
---
It‚Äôs a window not a magical portal that voids damage if he can charge an attack and get you through the window you fucked up and vaulted too late.
---
His attack has a 1.5-3 second wind up that auto lunges so it either takes long enough that the survivor evades or you lunge past them.
---
Play the character before you say how he‚Äôs broken and if these are problems for you maybe you just need to learn how to counter him.
---
He let her go as he went around the Meg instead of hitting her in the back.
---
"It wasn't amazing but it was annoying to play against"
---
Sorry, I misread that for what you meant. Did you mean it was a fundamental failure of a design?
---
No he wasn't fine, ever.
---
Thanks dood!
---
People use macros on PC so I think a console equivalent should be built in
---
Welp, Dedicated servers epic I suppose
---
His tracking ability is like a free, more accurate Bloodhound. And his power encourages tunneling and slugging.
---
Shame they continue to have to implement a hot fix after each update. Id gladly take reduced amount of content releases for a more stable game.
---
I just think youre overestimating him quite a bit and that if you played him youd see that you really cant curve around loops that well, even less so than the ptb version as they nerfed that. His flick has also been nerfed as you might get a 90 degree flick if you super try but its more like a 45 degree most of the time. They also increased his time after ending dash to when he can act again by a full second and increased how long it takes his club to break pallets. Being only on the receiving end of it cant really give you the full picture especially your concerns with vaulting are definitely latency and not him being op. Please try things yourself before saying they are op, not doing so is how we get things like the old freddy nerf. Also id still like to know what rank as the meta between ranks is pretty huge.
---
Eh, I could understand if you REALLY need those bloodpoints. But ever since i got ruin and barbecue and chilli, i don‚Äôt really care that much anymore
---
Killers think it‚Äôs good because it slows the game down. 
---
It only really works against people who can‚Äôt hit great skill checks and people with lag on their tv/monitor. 
---
So it‚Äôs ok I guess. I find it just boring as survivor and a waste as killer (2/3 of the time)
---
I solo queue and nobody knows how to work through ruin. So I end up fixing two gens while they run around looking. Then get hooked and die. Lol
---
To those who‚Äôve encountered this glitch: please report here ([Killer stuck in place after generator kick](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/109961/killer-stuck-in-place-after-generator-kick) )  so that it hopefully catches the devs attention. 
---
The devs probably get survivor glitch reports fourfold of the killer‚Äôs which is probably why survivor issues are resolved quicker, so yeah.
---
Oh, yes! I was playing DBD on my Switch too and I got stuck on a Gen as Ghostface as well. It wasn‚Äôt Rotten Fields tho. I kicked it and I got stuck. But a survivor touched the Gen again and I could kick it again and I got unstuck. Must be a bug.
---
Until her 'Mindgaming' is fixed she will be a bitch
---
Limited use, which is not stopped by walls.   
---
Limited use, which is easily refilled by having even 1 survivor injured.   
---
Limited use, which is refilled even faster if survivors stop to heal.  
---
Limited use, which has 1 second recovery for canceling. Oh boy that one second rather than having to trade canceling it entirely.  
---
Limited use is only as effective as what the limitations are compared to the benefits. There are much more beneficial effects than are limitations to their power. It is, again, taking the Billy's power and making it much more effective, while limply adding a resource pool to it.   
---
You have to take into account, Billy is risk vs reward and you're punished for using it wrong. The Oni just needs to redirect themselves and start it again, or hug walls and coast around them without worrying about canceling it if they don't intend to, putting the power back into the hands of the Oni for using it with little risk.
---
Getting off the hook is RNG. I'm not going to let them win because they held M1 and got a 4 percent chance to escape.
---
I don‚Äôt know what speed your referencing. Base killers move at 115% movement speed and certain killers move at 110% with 100% being base survivor movement speed.
---
You just sound like a whiner
---
It come with The Plague. It blocks the 3 furthest gens from being worked on for like 3 minutes so it can buy you a lot of time
---

I figured as such. Unfortunately the survivors never came to me and they got out Scott free :(
---
It must be a universal bug though, as I got it while playing as Clown and Plauge
---

The accuracy is reduced in the purple flashlight compared to the yellow and green.  Read the description if you don't believe me.  I think you're starting the blind to early.  If you find that you've blinded someone to early you can click the flashlight to get a second blind and that will trigger a drop.
---
Worst time I'm probably put either a month after Freddy or Legion's release. It's one thing to release a character that's overpowered and need to rebalance them quickly, espicially when players are finding issues and exploits with their powers, but another thing entirely to nerf them so hard they become practically pointless. In both cases, Freddy and Legion were absolutely pathetic less than a month after they came out and it felt like many killer mains had wasted their money. More disappointing was Freddy since he had such a cool concept behind the Dream Demon power, but then they just tossed him in the bin for a year. Every once in a while someone would look at Freddy and go "Well maybe this build could work with him" only to be shat upon immediately and be reminded why we don't play as him. Now the same fate has befalled Legion, but drawn out over a whole year... So sad
---
Could anyone provide a link to Ash saying this? I own him, but I've never played him so I'm curious as to what this would sound like!
---
One time I even completely forgot I was queuing for a match because it took THAT long. I had my game minimized (can‚Äôt hear the audio unless the match has started) while I was just watching videos. At one point I just heard the match start and I was so confused.

Nah they always look away after the first blind, but you also didn‚Äôt answer the question.

---
Not really. I play killer more than anything and play survivor with friends. I‚Äôm not seeing the nerf people are complaining about because I haven‚Äôt had any issues getting kills with him now from before the update
---
Ash just needs to say "Groovy" every time he finishes a generator or unhooks himself and "Hail to the King, baby" when he escapes and I can die happy
---
But a discouragement doesn't do anything. People will camp because it works no matter what discouragement you put on there. And if you over discourage, then they'll just leave. 
---
Carrot or Stick, Stick doesn't work. Positive Reinforcement is always more beneficial than negative reinforcement.
---
You can not dictate how a player plays the game within the game mechanics. You should not punish a player for using a valid strategy to perform their objective within the game. Setting up a bait and ambushing anyone that comes into your trap is a valid enough strategy - So much so that Insidious was created to do specifically that.
---
Instead, reward the opposite action. Make not camping more lucrative. Make roaming/patrolling actually beneficial to the point that killers want to do it. 
---
Because why would I, playing as killer, want to go away from my guaranteed kill you **maybe, possible, almost, hopefully** down another survivor when I can sit here, guarantee this kill, and more than likely get more kills as my prey comes to me?
---
As to people leaving DbD, there's a damned good reason why survivor queues have been taking forever recently. Every platform, in almost every region (Oce being an exception), survivor queues have gotten longer and longer over the past two months.
---
You ask if I'd want people to leave just so killers can secure one kill. Killers are already leaving because of survivors and their entitled "Everything needs to change so that **WE** have fun" mentality.
---
The very thing you threaten on the survivor side has already happened on the killer side.
---
And that's why people are fed up with the entitled, survivor mentality to the point that you just get mocked. Because you're so damned entitled that you don't even think about the killers, you just blather on and on about how **YOU** need to have fun. 
---
And if you don't have fun, then people will quit Dead by Daylight!!!
---
That's your final argument. And you don't even realize it's already happened. You're so stuck in the entitled survivor mentality that you don't even consider killers to be part of those people that quit DbD.
---
Damn no wonder legions are crazy. There‚Äôs nothing there but snow.
---
The BM wasn't very necessary.
---
Ok, can't read between the lines dude.  The timings are the same but the accuracy is reduced, therefore it takes longer to blind with a purple flashlight which is why you're able to use it more successfully because you're premature with your flashlight just like you're premature in bed.
---
BHVR won't fix these things for the same reason they won't remove QTE's from doing generators. They just added new abilities for doctor that make these gimmicks harder and more annoying, it's like doubling down on a bad idea.
---
Nurses calling
---
He obviously let them live lol
---
Yeah, this was probably my... 6th game with Oni. I'm still figuring out his insta down timing because I dont want to charge it too much where it'll make me swing way too far or accidentally whip as I go for the blow. This was my first time downing him the whole game.
---
I know I'm going to get shit for this but I'll take my chances the leatherface was probably doing the basement bubba thing I think and before anyone think I'm defending camper's I'm not I don't even play this game because toxic people and depression don't mix well at all
---
The killer is clearly new too. Your friend ran basically in a straight line towards an exit gate. They wouldn't have got out if the killer was at all competent. I was expecting to see them pull off a cool juke or something.
---
As funny as it may be, I don't blame them. It's not unusual for me to end with less than 5k points because someone decided to f\*\*\* my life on red.

I love playing Bubba even though he isn't strong. Part of why I love playing him is because I love the TCM movies. A killer doesn't need to be strong to be fun. I wouldn't recommend running insidious though because it's used for camping and it's a bit scummy.
---
I understand the limitations on curving loops, this is why I bring up tight loops as opposed to long loops, long loops add a factor of having to run a longer distance in order to complete the loop, giving more time for a charge to be effective in the time it takes to round the corner.  
---
The flicks are still viable because 45 degrees is enough to close the gap of a longer loop if you are charging while hugging the wall in the direction of where the survivor is looping.  
---
As for the breaking of palettes, okay, that's still a quick break of a palette relatively, and with the ability to re-up their charge within a second and tracking a lost survivor by their blood orbs/addon revealing them due to blood orbs, it's not particularly hindering to lose LOS in that time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The vaulting, again, seems to be an issue of connection, though I'm not ruling out the idea of their attack reach being screwey as it seems more consistent when against an Oni. Unless every Oni player has had a bad connection/us having a bad connection against them, plus, the issue of the bug where the oni can hit someone on the ground floor from the top of a window vault, I wouldn't put it past behavior to have increased their attack range because of visual weapon length. Makes sense in hypothesis, would be bad in practice, given how every other killer operates with attack range.

Wait did i say that survivors will quit? Shit sorry for my phrasing, I meant that like, all of the newbies will start leaving because of the constant hate on both sides.   
---
But anyway, yeah, I like the idea of making leaving the hook more enticing instead of punishing. But again, my idea wasn't really punishing, it was just slowing the hook timer down.

I've seen multiple people on here post about having connectivity issues on Xbox. I'm on Xbox too and can find killer matches without any hitches, but as survivor, I get error codes 40% of the time. Maybe submit a ticket with BHVR and say you're not the only one having this problem on Xbox.
---
Even level one has its moments. If you manage to not pop it until end game, then it‚Äôs fuckin great.
---
Imagine playing that one ps1 back in the good ol days

It will.
---
Mhmm whatever dude.

Maybe you should read past the title, chief.

Yes
---
Yes, it will change. Be careful though, even if DbD is not affected by ID change, others games may not work properly

Thanks.

Or they're just a person who gets farmed like this: https://www.twitch.tv/brother_cope/clip/BeautifulAdorableCheeseArsonNoSexy
---
Not everyone is a "super optimal toxic SWF out to bully the killer." Jesus this subreddit has a bunch of babies in it.
---
Outside of OoO it's not that much more info than you'd get from just 4 good survivors who have good gamesense
---
Survivors winning still comes down to chases. Yeah you'll probably get the correct gens done more often (making the last 3 impossible to easily patrol) but those are things good survivors have a sense for anyway. SWF just allows survivors to more easily play optimally, and the killer should be playing around survivors playing optimally anyway.
---
It sounds like there's an easy counter to this: pay attention and don't run into dead ends. It's better to run an area you're familiar with than into some random part of the map you don't know anything about. Scout the nearby tiles and see what you can loop and you won't have this issue.
---
Nice rebuttal.
---
Also, did you check your NAT type? There's a chance it could've randomly changed from Open or Moderate to strict.
---
I kind of wish they'd just refined that walk animation for male characters because the current one looks like an elderly grandpa who just shit himself trying to reach the bathroom to change diapers before the crushing weight of standing up shatters his spine
---
So he's Billy but he doesn't have access to his power at all times
---
bubba has one of the most important perks in dbd so just for that alone hes worth getting. now for the killer himself, i main bubba and absolutely love playing him though dont expect easy matches
---
I tbag to say im sorry.
---
These are Meg, Dwight, and Claudette. This is just how they looked in the prototype.
---
Same, I haven‚Äôt been able to play for 2 days.
---
He's pretty fun, I also enjoy slapping all the items out of the hands of survivors.
---
Bubba always gets shit because it feels like every bubba tunnels and facecamps. Realistically that playstyle exists on every killer, but it just seems like Bubba is magnet for that type of playstyle.
---
It helps even in chases. OoO aside, it‚Äôs easy to avoid brining attention to gems you know are being worked on, know what pallets are dropped where, and where you need to be at what time in order to bodybloxk. These things are made stupidly easy through SWF. In addition to that, it‚Äôs easier to coordinate tools and adding for maximum efficiency.
---
I'll try to find/provide them, but you don't have to play him! Just select him and afk in the survivor lobby for a few minutes.
---
Nah it's just another nerf
---
That build looks like the build every killer uses
---
I've always been kind of bad at explaining things, so I don't think I'm gonna be able to properly communicate what I'm trying to say. So, could you give me your idea of lessening the amount of players that camp/tunnel?
---
He‚Äôs not a strong killer overall but he has his moments
---
I just understand that there is no point in arguing with arguing with a survivor main that cries about every killer that is slightly good is op instead of learning how to play against him. I'm sorry but Oni is not actually all that powerful, he's midtier at best, anyone with experience in the game will tell you that he's a worse Billy.
---
What‚Äôs your NAT type by chance?
---
Oh well. Go ahead and keep calling him op without even trying so much as 1 match as him. Cant cure ignorance i suppose. Cheers
---
There should be some sort of compromise: change NOED and just make progressive buffs to every killer besides Spirit, Nurse, Ghostface, and Billy.

Is everyone using patch version 3.4.1?

Oh god please don‚Äôt let me do that! Lol

Not sure then. I know for the last few days people have randomly had their NAT become ‚Äúunavailable‚Äù &amp; have an issue retrieving the teredo IP address which has prevented them from joining friends or playing the game at all including myself. Not too sure on what the issue is or how to fix it but I believe it has something to do with Xbox since they‚Äôve had a lot of issues these last few days.
---
the headshake... never trust a bubba to have a quality clip... they always have to ruin it
---
Go to settings, and then Network. It should tell you on that page.
---
Also, are you using patch 3.4.1?
---
Wow! I saw this in my facebook group first. What a a small world
---
I don't really mind to press my spacebar when struggling on the hook, it adds a bit more tension to the game, specially when you are almost dead and a teammate is coming to get you.
---
I do agree however that it does get tiring pretty fast and that there may be another easier way to accomplish the same result.
---
But again, that's just my opinion.

Not more important, just less likely to radicalize their  students into shooting up the school

[deleted]
---
you realize you need survivors to play dbd right
---
Okay... Fair... I suppose I jumped there based off of the miscommunication. We've had nothing but respect, so benefit of the doubt should've been given. My bad on that.
---
Just get a **lot** of those entitled survivors that don't consider the killers to be part of the community. It bothers me. But I jumped there, and I probably shouldn't have.
---
-----
---
Moving past, slowing down the hook timer is a punishment. A blanket "Don't camp because we don't like it" will never succeed.
---
Rewarding the survivor for being the camped distraction will work, since that's positive reinforcement to the survivor.
---
Perks the survivors can play to deter the strategy are fine, since that's a build/playstyle countering a playstyle. Maybe something like:
---
&gt; If you are hit/interrupted while unhooking a survivor, the hooked survivor will complete the unhooking and you will immediately enter the wounded state.
---
Basically, if the killer were stop the unhooking, they instead don't stop the unhooking, the hooked survivor is up and injured and the unhooker is up and injured.
---
I dunno... Something like that would be fine, because it's a counter built into the mechanics -- Not just a "Don't do this because we don't like it."
---
It's like BBQ and Chili (You'll get bonus information so you don't tunnel) or Make your Choice (Don't camp near the hook and you'll get easier downs), or Borrowed Time (Don't tunnel or you'll get harder downs) or Decisive Strike (Don't tunnel or you'll get harder chases). They're built to deter, but it's not an immediate "Don't do this because we don't like it."
---
Just like Discordance is a "Don't stack on gens or the killer will find you." Mechanics a player can choose to either help their playstyle or deter their opponent's playstyle, but the choice has to come at a cost -- In this case a perk slot.
---
A blanket "Don't do this valid strategy because we don't like it, to no cost to ourselves" isn't going to cut it.
---
Same thing has happened to me three times now within an hour. A survivor has to let me hit them and then I get flung across the map. I think the game is trying to update your location after you input \[kick gen\], and it thinks you are still moving forward, so when the game updates on the server, it pushes you into the gen and it traps your character inside it. I think it is just a server issue. If you start seeing a little lag, just make sure you stop moving for a second or so to let them game update. It has been working for me okay so far.
---
Lmao thanks, people cant stand someone who has a different opinion than them.
---
Yeah..  ive seen people review a killer within an hour of it being released
---
Still can‚Äôt find ruin on hawkins unless its in the upside down or on the main hallways
---
Thanks! I'll see if that helps
---
Can confirm I would've had a mini panic attack and pissed myself.

Yeah, I would never camp. I play as survivor as well so I sympathize with them a lot when I play as the killer lol. I would just use it to create a moment where I can catch someone off guard if I see them and they don't see me. I don't know if it would work with Bubba but it has when I play as Michael.
---
&gt;Boom, you've just removed suiciding on the hook and the awful carpal-tunnel inducing struggle mechanic. Devs.
---
But that makes too much sense though...
---
Do it
---
Honestly, right now, it's seriously doubtful you will see many spirits. Mainly because the sounds that spirit relies on to track have been nerfed, to the point stridor cant even help you in a lot of cases.

Shit
---
You do realize that bringing up deathgarden, another game developed by the same people, with the same patterns in see-saw balancing resulted in a game nose-diving, that's not a point in favor of your argument.

I know it isn't I was just saying that he says new things now instead of the same one over and over.

YES

People would use this rarely or never get it off because other people might have items or use the perk

In mouth or drink?

This is really dumb, sorry

bless there souls but its kinda funny sorting by new and seeing everyone post the shrine trying to make it to the hot section

animal survivors when?

Wait when are we getting this

K
---
in the early version of this game, the devs were actually gonna do something like this, where every player got random perks
---
Murdered Around Midnight
---
This practically already exists in the form of plunderers except plunderers is better because you have a chance if getting a rare item.
---
for me, it's having Discordance go off in two locations at once.

cheers mate. the spine chill challenge was the most nerve wrecking challenge

Oh shit I didn‚Äôt even know dbd leaks were a thing lmaooo
---
Holy crap that FOG! having fog that dense would be awesome and terrifying.
---
The killer let them go. The path they took to the gate (killer) was obviously getting there, and not trying to kill the meg. Killer probably saw through the game that Meg was a BB and felt pity for her. All of us, killers and survivors, gotta look after our babies.
---
Its only if you do it to much, you get some leniency. I think the 3rd time (not consecutive) you get hit. Idk for sure though as im on console.
---
I'm on console too. It's fine as I only DC on super BS stuff
---
So why you saying nea ugly when your main literally looks like if i ate bill, shat him out, then put him in a shitty uniform and made him sound like he was having a stroke everytime he got hit
---

That head will be the new toxic Nea uniform. Pink hair is so 2019.
---
Its so frustrating! Especially if a teammate unhooks you when the killer is there and they didn't have borrowed time or take the hit for you and you're basically instantly on your second or last hook -.-
---
üòÇ
---
One thing about this game you'll have to learn is....make tight turns, and direct paths....dont waste time moving to the sides so much
---
???? 
---
60 seconds its literally a full state of the hook, if you can't get picked up in 60 seconds, then your team is garbage or your being facecamped, in which case you were gonna die anyway and the team is doing gens. Do you want a shotgun to kill them irl if they tunnel you or something? If a killer wants you dead your dead
---
That's exactly what Im saying, I think people overreact to the on hit change because its legion and hes already in a weak spot but fuck me, being able to run and jump obstacles faster? I'd take that over stbfl any day of the week.
---
Chill out, he's just suggesting to use an alex toolbox
---
I mean you could just ditch the game for a while and let it miss a bunch of checks to suicide. So it would still work you just wouldn‚Äôt get into the next game as fast and maybe have a higher chance of surviving. So basically AFKing would become the new suicide/DC
---
Shadowborn exists for this very reason
---
My NAT always says OPEN....i only have issues with that like 3 times a day..not much.
---
Yeah, most of the points I‚Äôm making only really apply to a high level of play, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not issues. But for the most part SWF is just a few friends wanting to play together. At the same time, a or of SWFs can be toxic. I‚Äôve had both SWFs that were enjoyable to play against and talk to, and (more often) toxic SWFs that spam ‚Äúggez‚Äù in post game chat.
---
I had a squad of ugly sweater bills bully me lightheartedly today. 
---
I saw them, died inside, then got a message saying 
---
‚ÄúLike what you seeüòè?‚Äù
---
They followed me around like school children.
---
I mean, I guess, he was kinda just standing still basically
---
The problem with that is if survivers just swarm the hook like a horde of angry bees then the perk would activate without the killer actually camping, just killing the surviver in his face.
---
I ran into a bush thinking it was a window vault once on that map. It's gotta be the darkest one yet.
---
Which by the way is false. He's fairly balanced imo, as a survivor main myself. His sprint can be easily dodged around sharp corners but that's not gonna stop him from just stopping near you, chasing for 5 seconds and insta downing you. And honestly there are plenty of curves he can take much better than Billy, felt really mislead by this sub when he turned 70 degrees to slap me around a corner in my first match.
---
I feel like the new patch is causing more host disconnections as well, I get like 3-5 errors now when connecting to games. I've almost started resetting my game after every match
---
I wish my teammates did the same
---
Wait, how did you get NOED before the gens are done? Also, you have to see if it's a killer with good chasing power: if it was a wraith and after injuring you they see you running in a strong loop they usually leave you to chase someone else. If you find ruin and managed to do gens without getting into a chase how can you say they were bad? If you got downed when your friend died isn't normal to assume he was doing the distraction while you were free to do gens? If you got down in the only chase they done doesn't that makes you bad? Also, how did they BM you? Did they say anything at the end game chat? This whole post is either a stupid rant because you cannot loop (not to lose the killer, who cares about losing the killer) or you explained very badly the situation. If they won, they somehow earned it or you guys messed up. Rank doesn't matter anyways.
---
seeing urban evasion teammates' auras while im on the hook actually makes my blood pressure spike
---
I thought it was Nea who was black? And the reason they changed it probably was to avoid a stereotype or am i wrong? Coulda swore they changed nea and claudette not meg and claudette, might be wrong tho.
---
Oh shut up, have you seen this community? They call literally every single thing toxic
---
If you are a Urban or Self Care user you aren't a team player and should consider playing a new game imo.
---
I did. I read your replies to others' comments as well.
---
Jane may have big booty but kate has an even  proportion of both
---
Damn that‚Äôs nice, the best I have ever gotten on PS4 was 66 one time and normally I‚Äôm in the 80-120 range for ping. 250 is my max since anything after that is a total lag fest and the killer has total advantage.
---
Damn, that pallet got destroyed!
---
This is some god tier survivor skill I like it
---
Underrated post
---
Honestly though its not a bad combo for with just how powerful the information from object is. That information being relayed to your teammates is what makes object in SWF so powerful.
---
There's a perk to quickly recover from the dying state on your own so if they suspect you've got DS and leave you then you can just get yourself up quickly. There's also another perk that allows you to crawl a lot faster and recover at the same time which I think is seriously underrated because if you combined the three of them you'll either stun the Killer or speed crawl away while recovering a lot faster than normal. Bonus luck if you use Adrenaline as your fourth perk in the build and by chance someone pops to the last gen, then returning you to full health. It's all situational, I know, but a build like that has saved me so many times when I dealt with tunnelling and slugging.
---
Aaaaand we found the flashlight spamming, exit bagging, "ggez baby killer" guy.
---
Depending on how the game goes, it can give me a sad to be downed before I get to the exit. But I can't really be salty about it unless the killer was camping, just as the killer shouldn't be salty about DS, borrowed time, or adrenaline.
---
It's a game, my dude, and sometimes the maps spawn in ways that can lean in certain parties' favors.
---
No sometimes they'll hit them down chase someone a bit but go back if they run too far and do it it's still tunneling and preventing that player from having any fair chance even more cheerful with a Spirit with 4 hexes that camps, tunnels might as well be holding a machine gun ffs.
---
I think that maybe you should replace Deja Vu with Detective's Hunch if you have it, they both activate when a gen is done and not only does Detective's Hunch show gens, it shows totems and chests if you want items or even find hex totems. It lasts about 10 seconds after a gen is done and the range is pretty big.
---
Nice man looks like your getting a lot of healthy soy in your diet. Are you a fan of soylent green or do you mostly eat just the beans themselves?
---
&gt; I usually dodge when it's over 120-130
---
lol... if my friends and I dodged anything over 120-130 on Xbox we'd never get a game.  170-180ms is what we now refer to as "standard DBD ping."
---
Oof, sorry you had to deal with that. I don't get why some people are so angry over this dumb (yet fun) game. The community really is the worst part of it.
---
Entity snatching wigs now smh
---
Which means that every word you wrote is useless because it isn‚Äôt based on experience. What you are really complaining about is that it looks broken. You have no actual clue what you‚Äôre talking about because you haven‚Äôt played both sides enough. That‚Äôs where your lack of credibility comes in. The character just came out and you‚Äôre already crying wolf. I bet you thought Plague was OP too, Black Incense too strong an addon? Maybe you just aren‚Äôt that good of a survivor.
---
Now she got even a bag to carry more than one flashlight
---
All flashlights blind the killer the same, nothing increases blind speed.
---
.... Oka I'm totally getting these
---
Waiting out the times is a valid tactic.another valid tactic is to respond to a killer camping your teammates by doing gens.
---
You can blame the killer if you want, but if your team isnt punishing him for camping by doing gens then blame your team for being stupid, not the killer for taking advantage of it.
---
We shouldn't have to use that many perks just to not get tunnelled its ridiculous.
---
Again, they need to take a FULL MINUTE to give up and come back, that should be more than enough time for another teammate to heal you
---
Doctor also has great tracking, so does hag if used right
---
I know but we shouldn't have to use up all these perks just to not get tunneled it's ridiculous.
---
My question is why the hell did he bring a medkit? Like how could he have possibly needed that?
---
Want a cookie?
---
I agree, the point is they're there to help you find a survivor. If colorblind settings were a thing ANY player could use them and it help colorblind people. To be honest, I'm not sure why it hasn't been a thing since the very beginning. Completely taking scratch marks out of the discussion, Survivors and Killers who are colorblind cannot see certain gens auras or auras in general. The bubbles that pop up on a loud notification or when someone is hooked is confusing to them I imagine.
---
I thought up a similar idea where the killer has a branding iron that he gets his power from dipping it in the fires and then has a similar effect to plague... as for the bumper cars... yeah I dig it. Just imagining Bill zooming round the Game map in a bumper car
---
I'd say get rid of the basic attack down requirement
---
I gotta hand it to you, what you did here is amazing. Hats off to you.
---
&gt; we shouldn't have to use up all these perks
---
Translation:
---
"I shouldn't have to adapt and adjust my playstyle to counter my opponent! They should just let me win!"
---
Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
How the fuck am I supposed to do anything when he hits me the second I step off the hook WHAT EVEN IS YOUR LOGIC!?
---
Jeff owns the chuck-e-cheeses
---
No , reasons it‚Äôs too slow , it used to be the meta when he got released now the time it takes to 99 hooks with the perk probably worth have a gen , I would rather work on the gens than 99  1 hook or 2 hooks
---
Exactly, like wtf ?
---
Hyperscribed by interns on Adderall as well
---
Waiting 60 seconds (giving your team is not complete ass) gives survivor time to do 225% progress on gens if they do separate gens. The killer hooks you, they have enough time to do the remaining 30 seconds of gen. Even if one is being chased two of them done the gens giving your team a huge advantage. If they camp you even better, you can literally carrying your team without doing anything at all.
---
"If you use a prestige character or don't run on my face every 5 seconds, I'm gonna be a dick endgame"
---
Some people want killers who change the game's dynamic, and some people don't it seems. Personally, I'm enjoying playing against the Oni.
---
In the games I've played this week, the Onis I've faced really didn't have any considerable edge over the survivors. In fact, I'd say that the survivors in my games escaped more than they were killed.
---
Like other killers, you may have to adjust your playstyle to succeed against him. You don't play against a Ghostface the same way you play against Trapper, so maybe things that work against some killers won't work against the Oni either.
---
If you're used to playing stealthily even when injured, it's probably not going to work, so you have to play to counter his power. You make it not worth his time to chase you, you heal up, or you don't get injured.
---
When facing an Oni, you split pressure, and keep near safe vaults, much like you would a Billy. Looping him is pretty standard, if not easier due to his size. If you get injured, you heal fast to prevent him from gaining too much power. When he gets his power, he can't see the blood orbs, so play stealthily. If in a chase, use similar methods to counter as you would a chainsaw happy Billy.
---
I play in red ranks, and don't run any special perk build. My build this week has been the same: Borrowed Time, Dead Hard, Iron Will, Spine Chill.
---
I did this for the challenge
---
They could make a second one if a lunge is going to connect, right now if I can get a quick grab it saves so much time, especially at drops.
---
Which, an extended fake terror radius can be worrisome,  though,  that is less of an issue if staying on top of your surroundings. 
---
Sure they can find people, they don't have access to a 1 hit or a particularly large lunge when they do find someone.  
---
that, and the ability to then snap out of it quickly without having to use perks/items/addons to make it effective to return to a normal state. 
---
the oni's tracking lasts as long as you are injured,  and stopping to heal takes a considerable amount of time, in which they follow a trail directly to you. 
---
that's the thing,  there's a lot of layers complicating his tracking.
---
You don't always fall into the void, it only happens periodically.
---
Yeah, don't listen to them, only that camping is not that good of a strategy, cause others can just complete gens when you camp. So just leave the hook unless you know theyre going to rush it. And then you will be called camper, when the survivors didn't even wait for you to leave the area. My best advice is, play how YOU want, not how others want you to play.
---
I want this
---
Happened to me as Freddy, took 4 gens before I got lucky and got a grab on the gen I was stuck on and that seemed to break me free.  I was able to gen teleport still but I would be stuck on the new gen everytime.
---
Yes... but do we truly want another weak killer to the pile?
---
Usually I get tunneled and facecamped over pallet stuns though. Like bro I get that it's annoying to you (I play killer too so I really do get it) but it helps me get away from you which is like... my objective and stuff... so y u mad at me
---
*Cries in oink*
---
With the new rank reset, it'll be super easy...
---
When you bring ruin and a survivor spawn on it
---
Thank you cause I‚Äôm new I don‚Äôt exactly know how to do most of this stuff. I mean they could of told me exactly this but decided to be hateful
---
Thanks for the names tho
---
Tbh new nurse sucks , gf is not that op
---
Ooh, we call it challenge now. Noted. In the end game chat I‚Äôm gonna be like ‚Äúgg nice challenge‚Äù.
---
Np I told them I was posting this and they both just kept going. There‚Äôs more hate mail if anyone wants to see it.
---
\-I'm a killer main.  
---
\-What's a killer main?  
---
\-It means he's afraid of a challenge.  
---
\-No it does not!  
---
\-Four flashlights.  
---
\-Stop it, Dwight! You're scaring him!  
---
\*Lobby dodge'd\*  
---
I play both sides. The bias people have in this game is ridiculous.
---
This format is nice
---
Congrats! Aim to get even better, rank 1 has actually a huge range of skill, some are really bad and some are really good.
---
Those maps are the least safe for survivors not counting Hawkins. Look at the data.
---
And 2 seconds for survivor lmao
---
Only if it's activated. I'm pretty sure they meant the endgame collapse timer, but if the reverse bear trap timer was activated, then yes, they would have died anyway, but not from the entity as shown in the picture. (Snaps the face back in reverse bear trap kill)
---
I mean he's not wrong
---
If you happen to be downed right under the hook, blame teammates for farming and not running BT (one of the best perks btw) There‚Äôs also Unbreakable, where you can pick yourself up.
---
ochido is scum
---
After being in the killer terror radius for 2/1/0 pullout mt Everest from your back pocket to immediately win the game. The secret ending is then revealed and the game uninstalls by itself
---
alrighty, my sprint is R2, my crouch is L2, my items are L1, drop circle, vault L3, struggle + dead hard x, gens &amp; healing square and skill check R1
---
Okay?
---
What made you want to change it from the start?
---
This happened to me twice in a row on Switch. The first match I managed to get unstuck when I grabbed a survivor who decided to work on the gen right beside me.
---
Okay, and?
---
It reminds of the meme of the dad bursting in a room with his belt at the ready, great art BTW
---
No it translates to I shouldn't have to use like 3 perks just to avoid one toxic action. The opponent tunneling IS definitely toxic.
---
No thanks.
---
Opinions this short are to be disregarded until more reasons are provided.
---
Just alinity the cat ez fix best part you wont even get banned from twitch
---
I can‚Äôt not be a rank one killer it‚Äôs hard send help
---
just used to it in other games i can imagine, it was about a year ago now but i don‚Äôt remember having it as anything else (square actions that is, i only changed my vault recently because it felt smoother)
---
I don‚Äôt have nurse‚Äôs calling yet
---
So you just spam click the left stick when u wanna vault?
---
I like it as well, I‚Äôll try to get monitor and abuse
---
all i want are teammates that dont crawl around the map with urban evasion, i dont think thats asking too much
---
No, Of course not, but one that turns dbd into an action game for the rest of the trial after one person is injured isn't good either. 
---
Stealth is integral to the game, things like the scratched mirror for Meyers are things that break stealth for the worse. 
---
The difference is the mirror has a limited range,  prerequisite of building up to Evil Within II, and actively moving around to find them through walls. 
---
The oni can simply follow blood orbs to a survivor without perks or addons to begin with if they're injured. and the addon that can reveal people has unlimited range so long as someone passes through an orb a survivor can't see until they touch it. Injures people are constantly revealed because they generate orbs, making the addon proc
---
If it werent for all of that compounding,  it wouldn't be as much of an issue. that's where the imbalance is.
---
yeah pretty much, just feels good i guess
---
I‚Äôll try. So far discordance and unrelenting are my legion‚Äôs active perks
---
99s the gate
---
Goes to escape with the others 
---
Gets hit by Noed on the switch
---
Gets sacrificed because the gate wasn‚Äôt open
---
More like bad killer hall of fame
---
I'd love this but the second they announced they were patching the rank bug I knew they'd never do something like this.
---
Then insert a perk you are comfortable with in until you get it. Invest in nurse to get it though! I love that perk with legion, and hopefully you will too.
---
I like that your friend's camera angle is optimal for looking at meg's ass. I volunteer to buy kate for them
---
You tube? Is that on cable?
---
Hey man, if the straw hat fits. I also took a high school English class, so you don‚Äôt have to keep throwing out the names of fallacy‚Äôs you‚Äôve googled. As an avid player of the game, as well as a consumer of streamers that play many different play styles, I have observed the opposite of your opinion. I have personally experienced both total wins and utter loses playing as and against The Oni, and I have watched many videos and streams of the same. So, again, my point isn‚Äôt that you are a big salty crybaby. I dearly hope that you spend less time in the future flooding the internet with your tears and learn how to play more competently. And since we are on the topic of appeal to accomplishment fallacy, my medical knowledge is about on par with your Dead by Daylight knowledge, but I think you suffer from a few disorders that you might wanna look up.
---
I‚Äôve read it was a bug, which doesn‚Äôt make sense. It should be in the game. Like I wouldn‚Äôt want to be in a match with another red rank survivor who has 2 of their friends, them being a yellow and green ranks since the skill differences is too far compared to mine.
---
Congrats! My last trophies are literally hit prestige 3, and 3 lvl50, still remember doing 3 blinks and accidentally grabbing a random dweet off a pallet
---
If you have distressing it gives you a 40.32 terror radius also if you wanted to test it but that's constant, monitor makes it smaller when not in chase as a bonus.
---
Discordance is good, it's my go-to as well :).
---
Same
---
I will do that, It‚Äôs just going to take a while. Thanks! &lt;3
---
I‚Äôll test it out
---
Interesting. I might give that a shot but it might be harder now cuz I‚Äôm so used to the default controls.
---
Deadass?
---
Thanks for this advice. Have a good one
---
If it's the middle of the night for you right now, that's why it's so fast. Its fast at night and slow during the day for me.
---
I remember that bro, but don‚Äôt forgot you also escaped 9 times during that match!
---
I have to disagree. If you're running an Unescapable Basement build with someone like Billy, Leatherface, Demo, Oni, or Ghostface, Monstrous Shrine will kill your bait faster.
---
Nice b8 m8, guess I fell for it, congratulations, have a cookie to bring back to your troll den. *pats*

Night.

No way, that would mean they have to entertain the thought that they are a noob, and that just isn't an option. You must be cheating.

Absolutely.
---
Ah you‚Äôre totally right. I also forgot to mention how I also killed the killer
---
I like Ghosty, Myers , Oni, Demogorgonborgon, Spirit, and probably to most people‚Äôs surprise, I really enjoy Trapper because it‚Äôs so satisfying and Hag is growing on me more
---
Oh yeah, if you use enduring or not, if you get stunned by a pallet to cancel your ability or afterwards you get less of a stun instead of waiting 4 seconds to do anything.
---
I would love this feature, but it also has drawbacks. There is a lot of people who despise some survivor perks, such as Self Care and Urban. Seeing them could make others dodge a lot until they aren‚Äôt in the lobby. 
---
I, myself hate those perks and I don‚Äôt like my teammates hiding constantly, so I‚Äôll likely leave lobbies if I see them.
---
It means they ass

High killer is fast, high survivor is slow

It's supposed to match you with 6 ranks higher or lower, which ia dumb

If you're one of the people who have been playing since day 1, you don't need BBQ. You only need it of you aren't close to P3 on everything.

The problem with your logic is I shouldn't have to waste a perk spot to have a fair game.
---
stonk survivors to get to tier 3
---
As if the mention of the Teacher files getting used someday wasn't odd enough.
---
It's a better mental space. Life is too short to care if the last person gets the hatch before you, might as well give it to them. Especially at Rank 1. I will say though, I prefer to to close the hatch and take the person to the exit gates, you know, for the points.   
---
Been trying to finish the 2 sacrifices after exit gates are powered with NOED and I just don't feel like my care free self. :(
---
OH MY GOD I LOVE IT!!
---
Because post trial BP's aren't calculated in game, they don't go into affect until the game ends. It counts raw bloodpoints that'd be gained normally without things like bbq, wglf, and offerings. Also because a majority of the playerbase plays survivor. Playing killer is rough for people that can't handle taking L's/getting bullied sometimes.
---
yeah stealth killers are so much fun to play and super spooky to go against
---
Guess that makes since. Would of appreciated if at least one of the levels between 1 and 4 had more killer challenges though
---
May I ask why you are running self-care, to me it seems to be a waste of time.
---
You guess what...? The guy made a long shot and included the part ‚Äúlike a cunt‚Äù. Obviously it‚Äôs because he hit the hooked survivor as he got unhooked..
---
Do it how I did, I farmed with survivors and betrayed two of them at the end. I gave them as many BPs as I could and killed them for my challenge, they understood.
---
Pepega
---
Something I found funny a long time ago is I had a survivor complain about how I supposedly camped him. Fast forward 1 week later and I got camped hard by a killer and I ended up finding it was that dude.
---
Either Ruin got lucky or you wrecked the team and closed the hatch. Definitely not deserving of being bagged.
---
Huh
---
Then that's an opinion too you idiot xD The devs change their minds all the time I wouldn't be surprised if they did about that too. Tunneling isn't the same as using a fucking pallet a pallet doesn't prevent you from doing anything at all.  Tunneling IS toxic just because you don't like it when people point out your tunneling 'tactics' are shitty doesn't mean anyone is going to some how see it as non-toxic.
---
I never understand why people DC?
---
Exactly! Plus, they‚Äôre absolute icons
---
hell yeah! top tier
---
For reference: the person who got downed before me was the Yui you see at the beginning, and she was downed near the hooked survivor. I heard the Spirit make noise from over near the wall she came from but I figured it had to have been a bug because it should have been impossible for her to be there, especially since I just watched her do... whatever it was she was doing at the start.
---
The killer's profile mentioned that their internet was bad and not to accuse them of lagswitching or "other BS", but this seems... kinda unreal. It's not that I don't believe them but it's pretty wild that something like this is even possible through lag. 
---
Just another day in the fog I guess xd
---
Understood, but if you get to the point consider it instead of prestiging a killer.
---
I switch a fair bit, but most of my survs are &lt;20 besides super Bill and a couple I grinded for teachables (Meg, Jake), meanwhile most of my killers are sitting at or close to 50, (except Huntress, I don't want any of her teachables).
---
Do consoles not have dedicated servers?
---
25k hours = 1,041 days = 2.85 years
---
Something is not right here!
---
It fucking is. I couldn't find a white skull totem through a bamboo bush even when SG was telling me it's there.
---
The title is sarcastic but it seems it wasn't clear mb
---
As a killer main, I feel that. I hate having to play a lot of survivor just for challenges, they really shafted us killer mains this first time around with the BP.
---
Except we don't have to deal with it, we can not be a bunch of lemmings and complain to get it changed like we do with literally every other problem. You can't even make a valid argument as to why it's fair for a killer to get free kills.
---
Noed is honestly just the "oh, this perk again"
---
Yeah game pace is definitely set by the survivors, they are the ones who really decide if 0-3 gens go off within the first 2 minutes.
---
Yeah Trapper needs a serious upgrade. The state that he is in makes him 3rd weakest killer at high ranks
---
no, just thought it was funny so i figured i'd share
---
I don‚Äôt see the toxic part...
---
What is this ultra rare offering?
---
I love that outfit might have to buy yui
---
Fixed cameras make it look like Resident Evil! Spooky.

I do like the very dark mood of this prototype. Retail version is foggy, except some levels the environment itself feels mysterious rather than horrific.

Only thing MS is good for is reducing Kobeing chances by a lot but we all know how much RNG hates the side you're on.

I feel like I can get those tight turns on console. It's the flick I can't pull off yet
---
At least he owned it XD
---
Lol. What!?
---
I‚Äôve legit messaged a dev during their livestream to ask about a change for console (I am disabled and it‚Äôs hard to struggle correctly with controller) their response was ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great idea, I‚Äôll bring it up to the team‚Äù this was a year ago.
---
Increase in gen times are way too much. Even the 25% increase across the board for solo queue plus Ruin would make it too difficult for newer survivors, not to mention make the game boring while you're sitting there fixing the gen. 75% increase for 4 man teams is ridiculous. I'm not a very good killer, but even I'd have plenty of time to take out a 4 stack if the game was 75% longer.
---
How does the game balance for solo queued players if they join with a 3 stack?
---
The difficulty with a game like this is always going to be balance. It doesn't matter how you tweak things, someone is always going to struggle with it, and someone else is always going to excel. You're never going to find a balance that works for everyone. The next best thing is trying to make sure the majority of the people are having fun.
---
It may seem like a lot of people are unhappy with things, but people who are unhappy tend to be more vocal about it too. They aren't necessarily the majority. The people who are happy or can live with things the way they are aren't going to jump on reddit or a forum and be like "I played the game today and I was content with it" or "i lost to a 4 stack, but it was a good learning experience". This isn't invalidating the concerns that people have, it's just that feedback will always be skewed to the negative.
---
I don't know if it's just me but I have the most trouble getting into survivor games. For killers lobbies it's like a 30 sec wait and that's it
---
It‚Äôs awesome, and yet at the same time somehow it‚Äôs making me nauseous and deeply unsettled.
---
Oops, I forgot about that! Op could replace it with distressing and scare the shit outta everyone.
---
Okay in that one specific situation 99ing gates is a bad idea.
---
that situation relys on the killer not managing to get a single hit using noed for the entire time that the gates were powered and someone was hooked as the only point to 99ing gates is to go for a save, and on not a single survivor in the game having the forethought or game sense required to figure out that it is safer to open the gates before everyone gets to them
---
So...pedantry. Your defense against how dumb your complaint is...is to be pedantic about my critique of your dumb idea.  Let me encapsulate my point to you so you can get it ....
---
&lt;YOUR ASSUMPTIONS MEAN NOTHING&gt;
---
&lt;THE CHARACTERS NATIONAL ORIGINS ARE IMMATERIAL TO ANYTHING&gt;

&lt;YOU PURPOSEFULLY ARE IGNORING THE ACTUALLY WELL DONE ETHNIC DIVERSITY TO FIND ISSUE WITH SOMETHING&gt;

---
That's a bad play on the survivors side. The killer should punish bad plays. If the killer is camping hook you rush gens and send a BT when done/ prevent stage progression. If done well the single hook and the DS wait can last all 5 gens.
---
SWEET JESUS YES
---
Why did you post two pictures of Dwight?
---
Yeah How come a slasher killer Horror movie genre based game have one thing that every slasher horror does to bring back killer against all odds after it seem defeated.
---
And still the game has balanced it out by giving a way to totally safe way to avoid it.
---
Yet, No NOED bad survivor goo. Give me Gen Simulator not some stress inducing, panic creating scenario which can contribute to the horror element of the game.
---
None of other games like Overwatch and CoD does this to us wahhhhhhhh
---
They like teleported seems like hacks to me. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to down that person by hook and get to you that quickly

I‚Äôm sorry, is this some sort of loner joke, I‚Äôm too popular to understand?
---
You don't need a mouse with extra buttons, the buttons are generally just fur ease of access, you only need key on your keyboard the doesn't do anything ingame, there's tons of programs you could use both free and paid so I recommend just googling it and picking the one you like then you can probably figure out how to set it up from there

Cleanse dull totems. No totems, no noed.
---
I really do wonder why people do that. Does it save you from losing a pip or something? Or is it just to 'make a statement'?
---
He want Alex's tool box just give it to him
---
Depends on the situation. If the killer is distracted by another survivor via chasing them, or is far away from where the downed survivor is, then just stay and heal. If the killer is nearby, then do a drive by if the killer still hasn‚Äôt picked them up by then. Even if the killer is nearby, I can still come to the downed person and heal them as long as I can before I‚Äôm spotted and chased away in which I‚Äôd hope a third teammate would finish the heal and get the downed survivor up. 
---
Just tonight I had a downed teammate and I was the only other survivor left. So yes, in that situation, go get your teammate up. I luckily hit a great skill check so I got my teammate up super quickly and we both were able to run away before the killer could catch us. My teammate was able to loop them again as I finished the last gen. So again, it‚Äôs situational.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same thing, it's a shame I can't pull their steam profile back up so I could have something to report them by
---
I've had close friends feel like this before. You have to talk to someone. Believe me when I say you matter to someone. You're important and life is gonna hit hard a lot of times. You have to stay strong and pull through. Even though it may not seem like it, people care about you. Killing yourself wouldn't do anything but bring grief to others. It doesn't solve anything. Trust me it gets better. I've even felt like this before and i know it's a lot easier said than done but you just need to stay strong and, if possible, talk to someone. A close friend or a therapist would work. I wish you all the best of luck in getting through this time in your life
---
There are many great people in the game, it's just that the toxic ones feel super significant. People teabagging and flashlight clicking on a level 19 killer, people trash talking after you had a bad game, etc. It all feels super frustrating. 
---
But you're right, I definitely encounter more positive people than negative. It's just how shitty the negative ones are that makes it feel more present.
---
To fuck over the killer: if you don't get the sacrifice, you can't pip
---
Alexa play despacito
---
Woah... good point
---
You have a great friend
---
honestly one of my biggest issues with the game, the matchmaking is so unbalanced and inconsistent
---
No, fuck this. I've died because people opened the door and I couldn't make it in time and died due to EGC.
---
what the devs SAY they fixed vs what they actually fix\*
---
I think he wait for the Meg to walk in the trap right before the exit, then hit her when she miss the trap.
---
What? I don‚Äôt get what you mean. I literally just asked who‚Äôs that one character not from earth in your comment, i never meant for it to be related to whatever else you were talking about. Maybe I‚Äôm getting wooshed but I actually just don‚Äôt understand

All that‚Äôs gonna pass sooner than you know, there‚Äôs good things around the corner if you just hold on a little longer. I‚Äôve been there; wanting to die and feeling like everything is hopeless. But I promise you it‚Äôs not. Don‚Äôt let temporary things rob you of an entire future.
---
I had literally never used the Turbo function on my controller, and now I find it a godsend just for the struggle phase.
---
But yeah, the mashing is pointless.
---
Yeah it would be especially bad for new players who arent going to have the meta perks and are just using what they have. People are always gonna be petty and its healthier to not give them the tools to enhance that.
---
wow that killer is boosted asf
---
Praying for you bro
---
Actually yeah I've thought that myself, too. My own excuse is since the healing skill check range is so much larger, the great skill check is always more toward the 3 o'clock starting point.

I don't care about diversity for diversity's sake. I care about diversity  for more interesting characters based on the local culture. Different cultures have different myths and lores for them to pull from. For example, we've yet to have a Juju or Voodoo inspired killer. They could easily make a killer based on the black dog/black shuck myth of England.
---
 WHY'D YOU LEAVE THE KEYS UPON THE TABLE?
---
10 minutes per match, plus an average of 5 minutes queue time = 15 x 20 = 300 minutes = 3 hours and 20 minutes.
---
Not *too* unreasonable.
---
Yup legit only found three games today it‚Äôs so fucked
---
I know what Detective's Hunch does, and it's really not my preferred play style. I take Deju Vu because it means I can focus on the closest cluster of gens, giving my team the biggest end game advantage. While Detectives Hunch shows stuff nearby, it won't keep you from a 3-gen, and having those final gens very far apart buys so much time in the endgame. I can complete each gen knowing that every cluster of gens after it is just a little farther apart.  
---
Deja Vu also lasts much longer, so if I'm preoccupied at the time, it's less likely I'll miss all the important information (without a map of course)
---
Self care is good for newer players, but I wouldn't put it on if i were you as one self heal = 32 seconds which is roughly half a generator. You can swap it out for bond to find team mates for healing.
---
I'm not denying that people would've have called it toxic, because there are some serious mouthbreathers in this community. I'm talking about voidnull getting *consistently* tunneled and called toxic. There are some perks people will consistently tunnel you for running, or consider you toxic for using them a certain way, but I don't think I've heard anyone call Lithe or DWM toxic before. I'm saying there are probably other factors at work that are contributing to voidnull's problem.
---
Definitely the game. I'm running it on Ryzen 5 2600 except RX570 OC and the game has some lag on Ultra.
---
They need to focus optimisation honestly.

A 16 charge medkit only heals you once and becomes depleted. If you miss a skillcheck it wont heal you fully(brown and green medkits). A yellow medkit has 24 charges so it will heal you 1.5 times and a purple has 32 charges so it will heal you twice.
---
Pc boyos have skill skins !!!!!???
---
Fuck yes.
---
This is a very loose use of the term screen shot.
---
Damn bro you broke his ankles
---
The real question is why is he even running? Because if he can‚Äôt get hit outside the walls why doesn‚Äôt he just stand there? Since nobody can hit him.
---
System of a darva
---
Cause it gives you free map pressure on all gens for nothing. Survivors are are there strongest early game when no one is hooked or injured. Ruin provides this pressure.
---
Ash is on his 7th replay of ACDC pinball
---
All ruin does is slow the game down, just a little bit. Really if you're good at getting skill checks or if you run stakeout it isn't that much of a problem. Pair that with prove thyself and you've got a pretty good counter
---
THERE YOU GO CREATING ANOTHER FABLE!
---
I have every chapter (besides The Oni)
---
It was sacrifice the 500 survivors, took awhile but I got there eventually!!
---
you can literally counter it before all gens are done and the killer can do fuck all about it. If they're a shitty killer like you say then you should have plenty of time to cleanse totems between gens.
---
Ohh my bad. I don‚Äôt have a switch so I wouldn‚Äôt know, I just assumed it was the same for every device.
---
U mus he want
---
Ok. I got introduced into the game as NOED being a toxic perk, and its unhealthy for the game (which it is as it rewards the killer for playing poorly, like DS rewards the survivor for playing poorly), so I never put points into it.
---
The only killer I have that DOES have NOED is Huntress. Level 3 noed to be exact. Now. Since I started this archive challenge about using NOED to get to EGC Sacrafices I have deranked 5 times in row before taking a break palying someone else, getting back to rank 7 and trying again, and now I am still stuck playing Huntress letting people gen rush me for a chance to get two sacrifices during a 30 second period where I am not in 100 % control of the game.
---
Alright you made your point you're a Angry Pug fan
---
god that was fucking satisfying to watch
---
Play billy or Spirit/Oni if you have the money to buy him.
---
I think everyone has explained all of your questions, but for survivors to start out playing - not necessarily maining - I highly recommend Feng. Her perk, technician, is very good for beginners because it decreases the chances of making noise at a failed skill check on gens and gens are the objective of the game. She also has a great exhaustion perk, lithe, that helps you during chases, as well as alert which will allow you to see the killer whenever they break pallets or damage gens and therefore keep track of him. All three of these perks are great for starting to learn the game. Then you can poor blood points into the character you truly wish to main.
---
For killers, I would start with Trapper for he‚Äôs a very basic and straight forward killer as well as being a viable killer in red ranks. As Trapper, you learn survivor behavior meaning how they run loops, and thus you learn mind games. He doesn‚Äôt have a complicated ability or power that takes timing to get right. He has his traps, and if you‚Äôve played survivor before you‚Äôve played him, you‚Äôll know where to place your traps.
---
I also recommend that you level up a killer to lvl 15 at least before you play them. Being a perk less baby killer is not a lot of fun.
---
nea the killer.
---
BEGONE THOT
---
:')
---
Fiiiiiiine.
---
Back off, my kitty!
---
Bye Felicia!
---
Dude, I was swf with one person, and all of the survivors are on a 4 man gen.
---
I miss a skill check. Fine. I being the dumbass I am go to scratch my balls and a skill check goes off and I wack my hand into my desk and miss the skill check.
---
Since then I have had a button on my mouse bound to space bar so that I can do it with both hands.
---
Is that the best you can come back with? Did you earn your moment of attention? Would you say someone who is a ‚ÄúBasement Bubba‚Äù is what the community needs? You seem educated on what others want/need.
---
Try playing the game for 3 years, and tell me you don‚Äôt get annoyed with the issues that DBD has. I‚Äôll wait.
---
What exactly were you doing during the entire EGC timer if you weren't on a hook?
---
If you were looking for the hatch you got what you deserved, if you were trying to save a teammate you should have left sooner, if the killer was chasing you you would have probably died anyway since there's no reason a killer should be chasing one person for 4 minutes unless he's doing it on purpose.
---
You literally lose points for facecamping you fucking 5head. It was patched that you lose points for it in one of the emblems. Idk if it's chaser or what but one of them will lose points.
---
yes.
---
Trying to save a teammate, being chased by the killer, trying to heal before I try to run past the killer at the door? There's lots of things that could be happening.
---
How do people not understand a killers' gestures? Constantly taking someone to a generator and then whacking it obviously means the killer wants you to repair the generator, things like that... it isn't hard.
---
What? Basement Bubba is my flair because it's a funny meme. Why are you even bringing Stream Dad into the conversation? Totally irreverent
---
Thank you. Happy cakeday btw
---
Nea the Entity
---
dude if you really wanna make it about a flare, your flare states "relaxed" and you seem ANYTHING BUT relaxed.   
---
we get it hes talking about your favourite streamer and you can agree to disagree or just talk about it in a civil way instead of attacking the dude cuz his flair says basement bubba LMAO  
---
with that said, yes this is the proof that angry pug should get out of the community :D
---
My messages are always open. Above are numbers to call. Please reach out and get help. Don‚Äôt wait. There‚Äôs light at the end, trust me.
---
Wait wtf I played with that guy a few hours ago.
---
Ok their are bigger priority for them to fix added onto the list i love the title but coming from a killer main i want to find a match in less then 20 min QUES HOLLY HELL.
---
I highly doubt it‚Äôs just your flair. Pretty sure you hook in the basement and act like an ass. You probably even hit the hooked survivors. 
---
You failed to see my point. Should have saw that coming.
---
Ugh no kidding. I'll stay in purple as long as possible
---
[Nope](https://imgur.com/a/qBJ70Bk)
---
I‚Äôve been getting so good ping after the update that I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôve added dedicated servers without telling us. 
---
From being constant 150-300 ping in every match to now being below 100 is pretty strange and absolutely awesome!
---
get this, a couple days ago I got reported for saying "alright fuck me for trying to not be an asshole" after some toxic prick ridiculed me for losing, gave him a "gg wp we all have bad matches sometimes" but nope
---
3 BT users? In what multiverse this happens because every survivor i play with when i solo makes sure to unhook me in front of the killer with no bt.
---
You DC over that hit?
---
Yikes.
---
You‚Äôre just as dense as he is. His flair contains toxicity in which he is arguing needs to get out this game. The OP is obviously jealous he doesn‚Äôt get attention. Who said I wasn‚Äôt being civil? Once again, I go back to my post about this subreddit believing what they want.
---
yes it's called rebinding the struggle key to MOUSEDWN and a simple flick of your mouse wheel does the rest for you.. unless you don't have a mouse that can work like that
---
Dunno why the downvotes.
---
Maybe Legion? He's my main rn (old main was spirit and before that was huntress). Contrary to popular belief he is still good, just not busted.
---
Fake news.
---
Why tho it‚Äôs a good feature for hag
---
just let it go, this guy's obviously butt hurt to hear the truth
---
I doubt the last part of that comment. I personally know people who think the harder they spam the slower they die x)
---
Considering the entire match was plagued with them tunneling off hook, bad teammates letting me go to phase 2 on the hook, this was the icing on top of the shit cake for me. Seriously, just [look](https://imgur.com/a/qBJ70Bk)
---
Try dominating a game, kill one. get the others to do gens in front of you so they know it's cool. Smack the hook nearest the door and hope
---
Uses his fist to injure survivors....  
---
OP you sure you aren't a centurion main? ^(INCREDIBILIS)
---
I destroyed them because they did it to themselves lol. I think they had 1 Gen done the entire time. Basically they hook swarmed me everytime I downed somebody and would save when I was still near the hook. The David was cocky that whole game because I ignored his attention most of the time.
---
You're obviously here to start a argument because someone doesn't like your favorite streamer to the point your nitpicking and making it about a simple flair.
---
Yeah bro? I'm pretty sure I just got done saying that they were survivor sided. Lol
---
I had a match yesterday that took 15 minutes to start, and the first person I downed disconnected, but it caused the entire match to end saying said person disconnected while loading in. The survivor was running away from me too.
---

I tried to do that for Adept Nurse too xD

But failed...

I got it randomly last week. I only need the one where I have to grab a survivor from a generator after blinking.
---
New here, can someone explain how she was being toxic? Doesn't she have to pay the opportunity cost of requiring time to heal/getting a teammate to heal her? With the added cost of not doing a gen?
---
It‚Äôs kinda douchey but one of my current favorite builds is just an endgame abuse Demogorgon. Just set up a portal or two at each exit gate before they‚Äôre powered. Then just run NOED, Remember Me and Blood Warden. Way too many people underestimate Demo‚Äôs late game potential
---
Shouldn‚Äôt the upside down be an entire reality, surely the upside down extends across the world but can‚Äôt be crossed in anywhere but Hawkins
---
The fact that they force to play a role you dont want it's already annoying. They should just put all challenge for both killer and survivors and let you choose with which one you want to complete it.
---
Did you use launch commands to make the game that high vis?
---
Console tho lol
---
IDK I play on PS4 but I find a match like few seconds...
---
I'm sorry what subreddit rule am i breaking? I can tell you which you're breaking. Rule #1 look at it. I've been respectful towards you as much as possible but you're being petty and rude to people with a different opinion to yours.
---
Im sad for the survivor who died against this....
---
she‚Äôs so cute omg
---
People will DC at any time, for any reason or lack thereof.
---
I say fuck it and make it like BBQ and Thrilling. Where once you down a survior EVERY gen gets surged and regressed. And have the cool down be every 120/80/60 seconds. That way we can:
---
1) have more variety in terms of slow down and information other than just BBQ and ruin
---
2) still be balanced enough that if you find an injured survivor after downing/hooking someone.
---
3) apply easy pressure to the entire map.
---
If every gen seems OP, than why not just apply it the killers terror radius. That way it has synergy with perks like distressing that increase terror radius.
---
6,9k upvotes. NICE

This is the perfect solution.

I‚Äôm talking about hits in chases, everything that the killer does in a chase is prioritized by the game and that‚Äôs actually noticeable.

Yeah, why is it so bright?

See if I do that though I feel like I am betraying their trust. I got them to like me, then I spit in their face.
---
It's relatively inexpensive and accessible anywhere with internet.  So it's goal was to be a low cost for entry and great for travel.  Neither of which are needed in my life but I can see people who could really use this for their life style,  just not for any input sensitive games.

It‚Äôs pretty strong considering he has the stupid music mixed in with his heartbeat. I can‚Äôt tell where he is until he‚Äôs touching me half the time.
---
Remember when people were like Legion trash, then he wasnt 2 weeks later
---
Should've kept the pallet shatter.
---
had a match yesterday as a rank 10 killer going against an SWF of rank 4s
---
Because it‚Äôs easier for survivor to rank up than killer so the majority of survivors are red ranks and killers aren‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why queues for red killers are instant. They can also match you within ranks 6 higher or lower than you so that‚Äôs actually as intended.
---
I imagine Doctor being scared of Plague's apples
---
Ignore them, they are probably that one survivor that runs out the gates the second the gates are opened, leaving everyone behind lmao
---
We just might finally discover what the Entity's favorite flavor of ice cream is
---
This match ended beautifully in a 4 man MORI ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'm pretty sure nowadays you'd get a restraining order for 1% of what was said in 2008-2012 Call of Duty voice chatüòÇüòÇ
---
Thanks for expaining hex'es!
---
I loved the end with the pic of them both looking really happy
---
Thanks for the proposition!
---
Probs the doctor who was chasing you, doctor laughs randomly in chases
---
congrats! :)
---
No idea, this sub‚Äôs hivemind makes no sense. The changes were a borderline buff.
---
Thanks for the recomendations!
---
Hope the devs don't patch this little bug(ger) :)
---
No, it's a mechanical sort of laughter and it's on any killer but seems to randomly? happen
---
DBD is not the game to play if you are having mental health problems. I highly suggest you seek professional help and talk to someone. There's free help, along with therapist/professionals that will work with your insurance. I would actually quit playing DBD, it is not a "relaxing" game for a majority of people. And especially turn OFF the chat... it's really toxic... not healthy at all... And a lot of people just "troll" to push people's buttons on purpose... like you don't need that in your life. Don't care about what others think, especially if they are most likely trying to just get underneath your skin. That guy was clearly throwing crap at the fan, and you are not going to get banned etc. That guy and what he said/thinks is irrelevant.
---
I think you are letting what *you* think other people are thinking about you, take control of your thoughts than what is reality. People that love you and care about you, don't think you are burden. You are not a burden. People call you a liar.... so what? Are you? Only YOU know, you. You know the truth. And so what if you are ? Who cares? Own it. People will say and do stupid nonsensical things. So, what? You cannot control them, nor should you. You can only control yourself, don't focus on things you can not control or change. Focus on what you can. Focus on you. Focus on your thoughts. Be positive. Don't let others bring you down. They can't. Only you can. You have the power. You have the control.
---
Talk to a counselor/therapist. Some professional. And a tip, you may not find someone you LIKE at first... but keep trying. Go see someone else. Till you find someone that "clicks" with you. I talked to someone and we just didn't really "mesh" like they didn't get me. But then I spoke to another, and they completely helped me out through some bad times. People are out there ready to help you.  And it is extra rough when it's family that you are around, that is giving you problems... having someone else there (therapist etc.) for that extra support and encouragement is seriously going to help you, and they can guide and help you focus your thoughts way better. - There's all sorts of therapy as well, just advice, or CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy..etc.) They should help guide you. -- and AGAIN. If it's not a good fit, don't just give up. Go talk to someone else. It will seriously change your life for the better, to the point where maybe someday you are helping counsel others that are stuck in your position right now and help them through their hard times. 
---
If there are other games you are interested in or like, I really suggest taking up those instead. Maybe there's a FPS, RTS, or MMO you would love.... idk... 
---
Good luck to you. Stay strong.
---
stinky
---
You're a fucking idiot.
---
Thank you all for the input. I got something to work with. :)
---
Thanks!
---
Well yeah her range addons were strong, but if you want good map pressure you could just play hillbilly. The reason nurse was (and still is) so strong is that she completely breaks the chase mechanic. Nurse can't be looped, pallets are useless against her, and windows are obsolete if she's running I'm All Ears. Most killers in the game are graded based on how quickly they can end chases; that's why most of the top rated killers have instant downs or extreme mobility. Nurse is still the uncontested queen of chasing, and can *still* end most chases in under 20 seconds if the killer is a seasoned nurse player. 5 blink nurse was a crutch and omega blink nurse was just broken, but even without them she's still top tier.
---
Dude I can just imagine the bruh sound effect #2 when looking at him
---
he's made for it
---
Yeah I am main billy right now and Freddy
---
Not yet
---
Thank you tried with it
---
Same, I may never prestige my Bill just because it‚Äôs a pain to get all the perks back.
---
Well, the ranks are actually ten or eleven because they saved each other on the wrong side. I mean you could shoot him like you did. If they would save as they should there will be only 2 guys hit and nobody would be on ground.
---
And killers are btching about DS and Adre :D Ye, bith sides have their lil sheeets to complain about all the time.
---
I know exactly what you mean about the smaller community. I always get matched with the same pool of survivors. Guaranteed I'll recognise a username 1 out of every 3 matches
---
10% as in... 10%... as in moving at the speed of dying survivor.
---
It was a really good shot. You're not impressed just because it wasn't a moving target? I don't care if you're a top tier Huntress player, that just sounds arrogant.
---
Damn, missed this whole conversation! What were they saying?
---
Yep. I've been recognized heaps by killers who camp or survivors who despise versing me despite the fact I live by the no tunneling rule. It sucks when it happens.
---
I open the gate every time lol
---
I thought you couldn't see the killers username?
---
Of course it's not skillfull, but the point is that either they need to make it more engaging than spamming and breaking a button, or just remove it completely.
---
His favorite snow cone flavor is tigers blood
---
Well, good job! And I‚Äôm also sorry for you because if you are playing really good you gonna get camped. I‚Äôm also on rank 1 for almost every season and have played this game for so long and when I loop a quite good player. I‚Äôm getting camped. After match he said ‚ÄúI camped
---
You because all the gens were done. So what should I do else ‚Äù I guess it‚Äôs not worth it haha
---
It's Friday dude got drunk as fuck and turns into an emotional wreck. All will be good when he sobers up and falls back in place. Surely he wants out of DBD but he has no choice and yet he really doesn't want to stop playing either.
---
Plus on the top 5 scores he is the first 4.
---
And that is why you don't bm if you don't know how to do it
---
Doctor and legion were actually possible to hit you but other are god damn hilarious
---
I'm willing to bet one of those misses was the bug where, if the surv 360's, you randomly stop attacking.
---
The shrine is still useful for bloodpoints even after you get all the perks
---
where auto-aim messes you up yeah that‚Äôs the point of the 360‚Äôs
---
Guess we found the real killer, haha. Is it a bad thing that I don't have a cat? Probably, but I sure want one
---
I thought the killer was healing you for a second
---
Its like when you get called out for hacking when you see someone enter a locker
---
You mostly need to predict survivor movements so that you can throw a hatchet where they'll be rather than where they are, but the best advice I can give you is to just play her a lot to get a good grasp of the hatchet's physics
---
Same happened to me tonight! I was actually thinking about making a post but saw this instead! I always try to message those players after to spread the love. It's always funny when you have those terrifying moments at the end of the game where you wonder if they will be merciful or not
---
‚ÄúAnd added a watermark so nobody steals it‚Äù
---
I can‚Äòt even count how often I was left to die on first hook because my teammates just ran out (even without noed), no hesitation.
---
They are no beter on PC, the killer has been teleporting and hitting across pallets
---
Smfh yea I'm sure you still love phasing across the map in 5 seconds every fucking 10 seconds and shit...that's literally what every Spirit I go against does...shits not fun, it's annoying. Always on your dick
---
On console he doesn‚Äôt have as much pressure than on PC.
---
Look at my name, I won't let you dis my bRAND
---
Maybe I'm dumb but I don;t understand....
---
Damn respect
---
I would've uninstalled right then and there
---
A killer using their power?! So sweaty!
---
Tbh if a killer leaves a game, I feel like they should just like do a Mori on themselfs.
---
That‚Äôs just a good ole fashioned lag switch
---
It's only inexpensive to buy the hardware, you're gonna be spending more on when you go over your wifi data caps with 10-20 gigs per hour and needing to pay 60 dollars for games that are already discounted on other platforms +10$ a month subscription fees
---
Also it's concerning while I was trying to confirm what I was saying that you can't actually check the prices of the games on the stadia product page on google
---
And Nea was raised in the USA :) I really hope they make killers/survivors from more regions than just North America...
---
What's 'bb' in the chat?
---
Sounds like a typical pug friday
---
It's just funny how all you tryhards love Spirit so much just bcuz she can go invisible and her dumb twitches.....you really need invisibility just to win matches ?? Sad. Cant handle mindgames
---
I think it's boring and then when the killer kills you anyway it's just fucking dumb. Killers already max most things because they usually don't chase when farming.
---
What if you wanted a level 3 perk but the Bloodweb said fuck you?
---
Put a crosshair overlay in the center of your screen, worked for me
---
Ah thank you  :)
---
I wasn't so happy about the previous renders of Amanda's face because I felt that in most of them we couldn't really see how she looks like properly. So I went into the game files and rendered some close-up shots.
---
The Red Cloak and the Leather outfits share the same head. They're the ones where we can see her face better. The Test Subject outfit is so bloody you can barely see anything. And the Deceiver outfit has an intermediate amount of blood. In all of them she has no hair and completely black eyes.
---
I don't have the skills to clean up her face from all the gore and add eyes and hair, but it would be nice to see something like that.
---
I was thinking yesterday that santa Claus could make a good killer. Maybe he could turn chests to presents that would have a 50-50 chance of containing an item or applying some effects on survivors like deep wounds or something, place some raindeers on the map that would give him information on survivors position when walked by them or maybe chimneys that would work similar to demogorgon's portals.
---
Or throwable coal for the naughty survivors that would blind them for a few seconds (not all of that at once ofc)
---
He could use a giant christmas candy cane as a weapon
---
All that I mean is that Billy hasn't had an issue with console players playing as him so I don't really see why console players would struggle with Oni when his dash is more forgiving and easier to control than Billy's chainsaw sprint. Yeah flicks aren't as precise on console, but people have been doing it as Billy since the dawn of console DbD. The only killer I think doesn't play as well on a gamepad is Nurse, but even then you still see crazy good Nurse mains on console.
---
Just kidding. Give us a chatbox, at least on switch gaddammit!
---
Aren‚Äôt they siblings?
---
**laughs in last minute hero**
---
Thanks, I'll be on the lookout for that!
---
they are both fine at most DS can be adjusted a little to make it better for both parties involved but dead hard does not need any changing to it at all. dead hard is super easy to counter by just not swinging and force them to use it early. you say you want a healthy for the community of killers and survivors alike but then why are just talking about survivor perks then? killers have second chance perks as well
---
In the OG canon yes, in the new canon no.
---
That's stupid. Killer can't do anything against autoaim
---
No you don't understand, survivors are broken, killers need to be buffed /s
---
no, you never know how much totem have been cleansed
---
Pretty smooth moonwalking there
---
Yeah. Don‚Äôt implement any of these ideas. The game is already survivor sided enough. I think you‚Äôre new to the game but as you level up you‚Äôll find out most killers are underwhelming and few are barely viable
---
DS needs a buff. The timer should reduce if you're in a chase or pause when you're downed - one or the other.
---
Jesus, I was just making a map to show birthplace, also I made some guesses but there are some confirmed places (of which some I got wrong) Jake is very likely not an immigrant however as his family already had a distinguished business in America his whole life. I don't know why you're so aggressive when I was just trying to make something to show off location of origin in a game I'm very invested in.
---
he's behind nancy and demo, since there's 3 of them.
---
I mean I'm level 38 and from what I've gathered the majority of the community thinks the killers are a lot better. Maybe I'm an idiot but I also considered my own experience as well as what at least some of the community said.
---
The African has no sources, it said the doctor was Chinese at one point, don't trust it. Also the Pale Rose itself is an American designed boat.
---
What you meant? that you deny that facts and correct yourself while denying that I am in the right here if it is so fucking hard to understand that you are the dumbass here stop trying to defend yourself you brought zero facts I gave you 382 words of why you are wrong to which you answer "I don't care for the technical stuff" meaning you don't wanna talk about it bc you dont understand it as in case of you thinking you can call hitboxes the same as latency:
---
Stop trying bc you aren't bringing anything new
---
I meant more that this one time I was shown pity... all other times nope.
---
good one bro i am going to laugh
---
Level 38 is not a lot. When you start out the game, the killers feel very op. This is because you still don‚Äôt know how to loop and neither do your teammates. As you rank up, you‚Äôll play with survivors that know what they are doing (sometimes) and you‚Äôll see killers actually need a buff. I understand it may feel frustrating but killers are already at a huge disadvantage. These changes would make it worse
---
Those scratch marks suggest she ran right to sucking the d
---
rubber banding is not a bug it is lag and that you can't really fix bc it is dependant on your connection
---
Underrated comment
---
The reason the survivors have gotten all those crutch perks is because the basic gamer refuses to play as a team. Even when you play against 4-man SWF team you can see how hard it is for them to actually do something together that is even a bit harder then working a generator and usually these people have voice communication so you would think co-op play wouldn't be that hard.
---
Therefor this game in the early days was going to sink hard, thus BHVR cut their losses and implemented crutch perk, after crutch perk, after crutch perk. Just so the people that refuse to play the game as a team wouldn't be constantly killed in the first 2m. of the game.
---
This in turn led to not giving killers decent personal skills (after the first 4-5 non-franchise killers) and if they have gotten them like legion in the past it'll be patched out of existence faster then anything else because in the end the survivors will whine and bitch and nag until the get what they want, legion is all but unplayable now, they got no pressure or dominance on the playfield and no one is even remotely scared of them anymore.
---
Survivors have a shit easy time to bully killers and if they know what they are doing there is nothing even the better killers can do about it save for a PC nurse maybe... since a good nurse is still the strongest killer in game (on PC).
---
These devs obviously don't play their own game, everything they do looks like it looked great in theory and on paper and then fails spectacularly once it goes live. Every PTB killer looks incredibly strong and right before the release they secretly nerf him, the Streamers did their job and promoted a strong killer now it's back to shuv a cactus up the killers mains asses and nerf the perks and general killer skill. It's been like that for the what? Last 4-5 DLC killers? While every new survivor doesn't bring teamplay perks to table but more crutch skills to please the a-social survivor crowd.
---
I know this is gonna get downvoted hard but it's just a simple fact, killers already have time pressure and survivor crutch perks to deal with nerf-ing everything around the stronger killers without touching the survivors strongest perks seems not only unfair but unwise. Survivors bitch about Hook Camping and tunneling but let's be honest the way the perks are evolving and the garbage attitude of meta-survivors in general it's hardly surprising killers will take a guy out fasts by tunneling and camping in order to even stand a chance these days. It's not like they need the ranking and it doesn't actually cost them BP it only prevents them from earning more.
---
Seems right
---
right as the killer is about to place the survivor on their shoulder that is when u want to start blinding bc u want the blind to hit them right as they can start to move
---
As soon as they're half way up to the shoulder
---
I've had my share of discussions about NOED. Has anything changed about the perk since then? No, what's the point of beating the same meat over and over? People will jump at you with their very specific scenarios and I don't think there's much point in clearing up their confusion, in the end, they will hold on to their opinion no matter how reasonable and logical the counterpoint is.
---
Fabulous!
---
A really good book
---
Must be Freddy's less intimidating brother
---
Man, Secret Offerings just shouldn't show up on the offering screen
---
Also depends on the killer, you cant 360 every killer. Espacially not if they are prepared and expect it
---
2 seconds after the pick-up animation starts.
---
Kindred, sprint burst, urban evasion and self care idont know this is an average build
---
Was stuck under the floor until he bled out. Couldnt get to him and crows started circling him. PS4 too.
---
Lol he just mildly annoys people in the dream world
---
Yup, like Plague and Huntress, you can't just 360 them
---
My number one rule is: if someone DC's before the first hook, the other 3 are escaping
---
and I let people go most of the times someone brings bps
---
I‚Äôm actually everybody who Is farming. For me it‚Äôs kinda cheating, because it‚Äôs abusing something that‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be in the game.
---
Iron grasp is only really good if your doing a basement build or running it with agitation maybe whispers can be replaced with agitation
---
Not bannable, but a real crappy way of playing. Maybe it was KWF?
---
Toxic douche got what was coming to them. That's why you just leave.
---
Yes plague is super stupid to play against. U get sick no matter what because u catch it from gens, other people, totems, vaults, pallets and lockers then it makes the survivor one hit and iron will useless. If you cleanse the plague can go and get that shit u cleaned off and just kill u with a projectile that requires no aim or skill like huntress. Shes literaly the most broken killer in the game so theres no way im going to sit there throwing up then a teammate cleanses and I eventually die after doing nothing except puking up my guts every few seconds.
---
Because its not a teachable and everyone can get it?
---
And this is the very reason why NOED is dumb.
---
Ain't nobody got time for that. Like, literally. You don't want to spend valueable time on searching and cleansing otherwise useless totems just because of the 5 % chance of the Killer running NOED.
---
It's a win / win / win for the Killer. Either, you don't need it at all as you 4k'd their greedy butts, they spend at least a total of 2 minutes to evade NOED (which might not even be there in the first place), or it actually triggers and grants you that one cheap hook. Or maybe even more depending on the situation.
---
No, bc with it solo survivor is actually decent, and it doesn't change swf so why not
---
based coomer
---
What does that offering do?
---
No clue, but the laurie was a youtuber (they had YT in their name) so that might be the reason.
---
Undetectable also counters dark sense, alert, and object of obsession. Its kinda supposed to.
---
Just throw the pallet down early
---
The only killer I play. :‚Äô)
---
Then it must be an issue on xbox because that spirt burst is only 1 quick step forward when it works which is why I wasn't using it before. The rubber banding if often but not always
---
Ds does basically nothing against tunneling killers
---
bc it would throw some survivors out of the game just like how killers are split into tiers so if you like a skin for a survivor and their passive doesnt work for u that would feel shit
---
Nah id rather take billy, bubba, myers, huntress with iri head, anyone over plague because at least woth them they have to find u. Plauge just has to patroll gens throwing up till everone is one hit then ur dead. Billys chainsaw has skill, bubba is ok if u can deal with it, huntress takes skill. Myers takes time and runs out. Plague is busted
---
There are too many tips to write down. You can find more ingormation on youtube. Scott Jund has probably the best Huntress guide. One thing Scott doesn't mention in his video how to read dodging patterns. If you see someone that furiously tries to dodge you hatchet moving left and right(the common dodge technique), when they move to the left lets say, you should have your hatchet already aimed to their right because that's his pattern of movement, that's where they're gonna move next.  You shouldn't follow the survivor when he dodges like that because you'll lose the center of your screen.
---
Because some would be so much more appealing than others. 3% faster running speed is way better than 3% faster healing speed, so already you'd have many more Megs than Claudettes.
---
Weird seeing this because last night me and another friend were in a 3 man swf and the 4th was a kate. American clothing and all, but suddenly there was a Yui, and no kate. No idea why lol
---
I see absolutely no difference. This is exactly what it looks like when I play.
---
I've been so happy with the Oni that I've legit been letting a lot of people go. Especially Jane.
---
That boy on the cover of the game mate.
---
if they worked with the killer ive seen people say that is bannable
---
Swim suit for everyone in the summer. Even the killers.
---
Nothing to see here, probably just a classic P3 Claudette. Your hitbox remains in the window when you vault it.
---
To be honest I think he just pumps lots of iron :^)
---
That could be. I notice that when playing and watching. If they have a YT or tTv or well known, they tend to farm more.
---
Either way, it is very crappy way of playing. Dbd is a team playing survival game not solo.  I would ha e down rated both her and the killer for farming and not playing the game like it is suppose to be played.
---
Boring? Yes. Irritating? Not really. I don't do it myself but I don't care if other's do it either.
---
\*plus 3% running speed making meg go 103% + Hope which makes u now go at 110% meaning no killer that isnt 115% is gonna catch you\*  
---
just a funny example
---
The devs don't really care about how the face looks, since nobody's supposed to even see it.
---
Thanks parn'r
---
Owned
---
I wasn't flipping out sorry if that's how you read it, I actually agree with you I'm not a fan of the spirits design in general either think it's really unnecessary that's why I posted what I did was more intended as a joke and a way to defend someone who was just expressing themself creatively. üëç
---
theyd rather you get attached to a character you are forced to play, then play them purely as a cosmetic
---
when i first started playing i thought that teachables could only be t1 on other characters, so youd have a reason to play the less good characters but that was just my lizard brain
---
Not really. I'm a spirit main and tracking by sound still is good as before. The recent changes (I don't see it as a nerf tbh) hurts spirit players that relies heavily on collision mechanics, since you can just phase through them now. She's still as powerful as before.
---
I honestly find nothing wrong with allowing DS in that situation. Everyone spouts its an anti tunnel perk and it shouldn't work if they aren't tunneling and use the 1 hook rule but i don't see the problem. I see the perk as a new player helping tool(behind a paywall lul) to have them not just die immedietly because they got caught quickly.
---
Yeah, sure its primary purpose is to tell killers to fuck off when they are camping and tunneling but its a tool to keep survivors in the game and not even a good one at that. If your able to find and down 2 separate survivors in 60 seconds that means one of three things
---
One, absolute shit team and you would of won anyway. Two, absolute unluckyness that you went to them first since the other two went into lockers preventing bbq or just lucked into going to their location first. Three, you proxy/camped a hook and downed the unhooker and hooked person again.
---
DS exists to prevent the bullshit feeling of just getting off the hook and he went straight to you. Is it the smart play from the killer to go for the injured person instead of the 2 healthy people? Absolutely. Does it feel like shit to die because the killer tunneled you because your injured cause you recently got off hook? Yes.
---
I think these are all of them.

K MartimasMagnum. The ‚Äúquick step‚Äù is dead hard it gains distance enough to get to a pallet or vault if used correctly other wise as the man above said use it if u want to get over a trap in a chase or avoid a hatchet. And its not a xbox thing because i use it all the time. If your trying to use it to avoid damag from the killer it can be finicky because of hit boxes so safest bet is for a small dash to reach the pallet ur looping on. Another thing plz dont be that guy that runs no mitherüòÇ
---
I kinda like the idea of a killer who could really mess with auras. For example, a killer who could interact with a hook and mimic a survivor being hooked. The problem with that is a stack of survivors will know it's bogus, but it's a nice thought for me anyway.
---
Unkillable would be miserable to deal with if you're someone like Myers.  One minute immunity to you, please no.
---
probably because navigating console keyboards takes a while. by the time you get two messages sent the match is already starting
---
What are u on bro ‚Äúdont use self care‚Äù?
---
I used to main wraith all I can say is try and block then for context if they're on a gen near a pallet uncloak in the pallet leaving no for them to go and those youtubers are kinda right but only if you have uncloak addons or you're experienced
---
He's so cute!!
---
only once you get the shrine up, and only lasting for as long as the shrine stands.
---
Billy and Oni can still insta-down you since they dont use "exposed" (insta-down is built-in)
---
but yeah you're right hahaha
---
What's missing?
---
Should‚Äôve dead harded to the right instead of the left. I mean hugging the bushes to the pallet. Still probably would‚Äôve died but that would‚Äôve been the correct use
---
Yeah but only a tiny fraction of people can 360 properly, most of the time they just make the killer miss in a dodgy looking circle üòÇ
---
u want what meta sluts use  
---
Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Adrenalin and Borrowed Time
---
You couldn‚Äôt open the gate because you weren‚Äôt in front of the switch lol
---
because they are made to be just skins
---
Nice üôÑüòè thanks!
---
Ohh, don't be so harsh! XD
---
She has a nice bone structure. If she got cleaned up she would look good. But it's funny that Behaviour puts so much blood and grime on her face.
---
There are a number of good perks but it can ultimately come down to what kind of plays type you do prefer. I know this doesn't really answer your question but if I did have to give a perk I would say maybe self care since you are new to the game
---
That sounds good but instead of deliverance run quick and quiet especially if u have self care( if u get off a hook with deliverance u cant be healed for like 1 min making self care useless) quick and quiet wont let the killer know u have dissapeard
---
Congrats...i just got to 4 for the first time...next stop rank 3
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Exactly! I really liked the rank showing before. I often dodge a lobby if I see a yellow rank is in it before I enter, because there's a high chance the killer is yellow rank too. I rather play with survivors and killers of my rank range than to bully new killers or carry new survivors.
---
Honestly it depends if you‚Äôre a good runner/looper, or if you need to play more stealthy.
---
Eh self care isint just good for new players
---
U can see u tried twice to get there but i cant so i had to get back to the pallet
---
Depends on your playing style.I personally went for Self-Care first, then We're Gonna Live Forever,Dead Hard,Adrenaline,Bond,Balanced Landing
---
everyone has the same lunge it just looks different
---
So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs only SWF in red ranks? Lol. Any killer can be viable against solo red ranks survivors. You‚Äôre talking about the most optimal team which almost never happens, of course you will lose
---
I just put up random numbers they could always change it even if it's a minor differences like .2%, .6%, 1% it would still give people reason to use different characters.
---
The perk is great but sometimes a disappointment with the dedicated servers and i pepegaed so hard right there panicking
---
I did actually
---
I know it‚Äôs just crazy how short the clown feels for me.
---
For new players, use Meg or Nea. Meg has Spring Burst and Quick and Quiet and Adrenaline. Nea has Balanced Landing and Urban Evasion. Choose whichever perks you like best.
---
After you choose a character, I would recommend you use Spine Chill and Kindred. They‚Äôre not teachable perks so you should get them soon.
---
As you get more perks unlocked, you can move on from these perks to better ones but they are the best for starting out. 
---
The best perks in the game for survivor are DS, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Inner Strength, SB, and Lithe.
---
Tell your friend, sometimes it's okay to be a W gamer, instead of wasting time going left right left right. And teach them to look behind.
---
Being toxic when you don‚Äôt know how to. Dead by daylight players...
---
Can you name the killers it seems to have happened on? My first guess was you were hearing the Saw boxes when Pig is the killer, but if it's on any killer, I'm stumped.
---
if im not using the most out of my build as possible I'm wasting opportunities DBD is all about using the most you can as efficient as possible that is why I love trapper so if I am playing a survivor with a passive I am not using then I am wasting it and I am not about to waste 1 million + some more bp just to get all my perks back on a survivor with a passive I would want not to mention everything new passives could bring to the game meaning if there was gonna be passives this should have been in the game from the start
---
Are you new? This game has been able dynamic chasing for years now, and the devs themselves said they want to incentivize more action filled chases instead of urban evading around for an hour. Sounds to me that this is less of an Oni problem, and more of a you hating the direction of the game problem.
---
how about lingerie Kate?   ;)
---
Playing Legion at Rank 1, my standart build as of now is Discordance, M&amp;A, Enduring and Pop. Mostly using FF duration addons after chapter release, since increased speed help reach more ppl.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/517151290](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/517151290) That's possible sometimes, from recent stream.
---
Dont hesitate to use your ability on injured survivors if you need to find others who are healthy.
---
Removed for highlighting unbalanced matchmaking
---
Some people seem to think I'm exploiting when I'm running Mad Grit, like just read the perks damn
---
Yes it will
---
its a bad habit to get into, self care tends to be a huge waste of time, is countered by a multitude of healing slowers (like sloppy) and tends to waste a lot of time that could be spent doing generators
---
You win this one.
---
Its bad for all players.
---
enjoy rank reset to purple bc I am gonna be happy to go back to green ranks
---
If you plan on playing Bubba alot I'd recommend getting PWYF, pop, Corrupt intervention and Discordance. I run this build all the time. You have to act pretty fast and know rotations but I can assure you this build pays off.   
---
But judging from what you have I'd say what most other people have already said; pop, bbq, thrilling aaand.. Uhm, Devour? Brining NOED is pointless imo when you have pop to stop them from getting to endgame.
---
But if we settle then nothing changes. I cannot except that.
---
Sure But the next time u get slapped u die. Or u take the time u could be self healing trying to find a mate to heal u. Sure bond but that wouldnt work for what i run ( mettle of man, self care, dead hard, breakout)
---
If I missed like that I would just say Dbd wasnt for me. Sad for piggy.
---
Mmm i disagree
---
Can you for once maybe stop just stating things without any apparent rhyme or reason and tell me beyond just "100 percent" why you think the stats cannot be used to say anything whatsoever?
---
I gave you a very clear argument that you ignored entirely. You say "stats skewed, entirely useless", I say: there are ways in which the stats are skewed in both directions, inflating and deflating kill rates, and there is no reason why we should assume any single variable outweighs any other significantly enough to skew the rates significantly in either direction overall. These variables have to be assumed to more-or-less cancel each other out, globally. Disconnects are the only variable that could be expected to skew the results significantly, yet not only would they do so making the stats even more killer-sided, and not only are disconnects actually excluded, but we know from what Peanits has said before that even disconnects merely skew rates in the range of 5%. Any of those other variables - that again balance each other out to extents - are thus most likely below even 5%. And as for scenarios where survivors die trying to rescue other survivors in the end game, that is just a completely balance-relevant gameplay element that does not artificially but naturally affect kill rates. What would the alternative be, buffing the killer's end game so much that survivors do not even attempt for end game saves anymore? That would just make the game worse for both sides.
---
So if that is your only argument, no, just because the stats aren't entirely unskewed doesn't mean they are entirely useless.
---
360's are pretty easy to deal with. Just step back and follow with the mouse, if you are on console or have low fps it can be an issue though.
---
If the reason a one hit perk is fine is the argument that we already have lots of one hit mechanics from powers/addons maybe one hit mechanics as a whole need to be looked at.
---
Cunt deserved it, i hate killers who fake giving you the exit thats just wrong, however if they just kill you after closing hatch i dont have a problem with that
---
I.... already forgot them....
---
Whats bhvr
---
So its there only to counter myers and haunted grounds ? Doesnt seem that bad to me. Bcs it wouldnt fk off killers like billy.
---
Rapiers would like to speak to you about dark souls :p
---
From her uniform alone, Nurse can be placed between 1890's to 1910. And possibly even more specific, within the North Eastern area of North America. Or least it was the popular uniform for the nurses at Bellevue Hospital in New York City around 1900.
---
The killer even let her finish the gate and easily could've killed the survivor. I don't get it either
---
If you have a solid understanding of the game then you should be doing decently with them like every other killer
---
I run Spinechill, Premonition, Urban Evasion, and Fixation.
---
(I used to play the dreaded blendette until my favorite character got those perks)
---
Wait what happened to the meg
---
Yes being stuck at a generator for 2 minutes as a killer is no fun.
---
He's a spoilt asshole
---
That is fucking amazing. Imma follow him too, I love me some good artwork.
---
So does mine. He bought me a game, such a sweet cat.
---
I always cleanse against plague, if entire team does it's fine
---
Do it in the corners, she won't be doing gens while she goes and gets it
---
*'Time to mix things up a bit"*
---
From what I remember though, only the first time was free, right? Also, the change might mess up some trophies for other games or progress.
---
You said you think survivor is easy, that as a blank statement to me can't mean anything but that you think the game is survivor-sided.
---
The problem is he gets behind and chews cords. Electrocuted cat would be very sad.
---
How else am I dodging a Mori.
---
Switch feels your pain
---
Shit, what now ?
---

Do you have "mindgaming" as well? Because you're a bitch too.
---
I-i dont know. I‚Äôve never encounteres it before. Your‚Äôe on your own here buddy
---
I love them all
---
Nice Comeback man. Totally made sense.
---
These seem like pretty good ideas, I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a more refined version of this in game
---
So if I am in the terror radius of her husk and in the terror radius of her phasing ( as she was right next to me when phasing) I won't hear anything?
---
What about it do you like?
---
It it a crutch because other wise the people im PROTECTING and I would both DIE and its not a waste of time because how im using it is with my mettle of man and breakout when the killer picks someone up i body block and use breakout to get the person to wiggle out then the killer either chases me or goes after old mate that just wiggled out thats great because then i go heal and do it again. It only works twice so i let them get hooked the third time he goes down and the other 2 have been doing gens and ive touched them when i trust the survivor can loop some more. When another person goes down same thing till i have mettle of man by then the killer is pissed at me because he cant hook people and goes for me mettle comes into play and all gens are done in the perfect scenario, or i get face camped, lol now ur thinking ‚Äúur a complete cunt‚Äù but... dbd is almost completely salt, so running something to fuck with a killer and get my mates out (even if im solo q makes me happy and theyre still mates). So with running self care i can not go off in search of a mate and stay close to my mate thats about to be killed.
---
The DC ban isnt even on console yet...pp
---
Killer in high ranks is just stress, as gens go quick and your hex totems go almost instantly. Survivor is always stress but when u get shite team mates. But green and early purple people are competent, but usually not too good to be unfair
---
1-1 =0, increasing 0 by 50 percent is still 0.
---
Behavior
---
this made me want to die thanks
---
It sounds like you were pretty proficient! A lot of people who play more casually usually get that achievement/trophy a little earlier than other achievements/trophies because they aren't focused on grinding the achievements right away, but it seems like you were pretty ontop of things when it came to getting the more difficult ones done. What would you say was the toughest one for you? Some of the Adept achievements and unique achievements like the one where you have to kill four Survivors by your hand as The Shape get real tough.
---
I love how Patrick and Bob crossdress
---
Man I've seen people DC after first down.
---
Thats a positive attitude right there. I have always reminded people that this is a party game not CoD but you know how entitled a certain group of players can be.
---
Funny thing about dbd is you can change the roles and it would still work
---
Hey, I'm a returning player from before Clown, basically. Can you give me the rundown on what you do now and what changed?
---
Yeah. Because if created bad games. Especially when the killer was an average of the ranks. Wasn't fun for anyone.
---
Also, after the change to match highest survivor, if I'm red rank and a rank 17 is in the group, do we really think they're gonna have a fun game?
---
Her maps seem inspired by Louisiana. There‚Äôs a steam boat called ‚ÄúThe Pale Rose‚Äù which defintely sounds American.
---
yeah i always mess up hair color in most of my render .. they mostly reuse the hair colors from other files and the tool i use picks up default hair color if there is a new hair textures . when i was doing this banners werent out and i dint look at the thumbnail icons properly.. and i actually liked this color :P its the one from Jane's summer outfit its like teh default hair color now.
---
Are you survivors that sensitive? Jesus christ.  
---
How was that trolling? The survivor was pretty much dead and so the pig gave her the exit gate to open, then she failed miserably trying to kill her.
---
*I'll try spinning, that's a good trick!*
---
Hadn't thought of that actually, cheers :)
---
I love you. And I love this game's lore, because there's someone at BHVR putting time and effort into this instead of just going "yeah it's a PvP game so there ain't gonna be a story".
---
K thank you
---
Do gens.
---
I‚Äôll save you the trouble. Yes.
---
According to, uh, *several subreddits*, he also does the sex quite often. With a lot of different people.
---
&gt;Just slap on Unrelenting and you get a base 30% cooldown. STBFL only gives you 40% at max stacks so that's just a 10% difference and you need to hit non-Obsessions 8 times to get it to that point... and then lose two stacks once you hit an Obsession anyway.
---
Yeah um, not to be that guy but... Unrelenting affects missed attack cooldown. Ya know, that annoying whif you have every once in a while. And while Im at it, 40% attack speed cooldown is honestly pretty great. Literally just save your power for the obsession, smack him and switch off. It saves your stacks and lets you keep pressure assuming they stop to heal and mend. Its time is small but enough of a distraction to divert an average survivor and stall a more experienced one. Plus the tracking you get in Frenzy is absolutely amazing. Thinking about it now, you could probably down an obsession with deep wounds. Sometimes you get caught having to slow down or stop to make a roundabout. Probably would be a madlad effort. Ill tell you guys how that venture goes!
---
Why are you switching from addition to multiplication?
---
It‚Äôs a good counter to 5 gens being done in 5 minutes.
---
Flashlights slow down a game more than any of your perks do, if you can stand on top of a downed person and bait them then they aren‚Äôt doing gens at all since they all wanna go for the t0XiC saves
---
what killer? if it is trapper well that is just how we have to play
---
I think you should start cleansing when you're on deathhook.
---
My survivor nothing is bannable besides literally hacking the game don‚Äôt bother just move on
---
The only time I stay at the exit gates as the last survivor is in case the killer wants to find the hatch and close it for points. Or get his daily done by hitting me with whatever special attack they have.
---
it's much more balanced than it used to be, but i think that an asymmetrical game being fully balanced is pretty much impossible. just my opinion though
---
Just like the Survivors, by rank 7-6 only gen rushing isn't enough to pip anymore and it gives barely 7k BP. The longer people don't realize that you should engage in cat and mouse games the more toxic this community will become.
---
She looks a bit rough but maybe it‚Äôs because her glorious hair in that skin was removed
---
Click click
---
I think they finally changed the match making so you don't get a killer that's doesn't live in your region. I've been getting great ping lately
---
I would love to see a game mode where survivors and killers are given random perks. It would probably be lots of fun.
---
Wait. there is another way to win?
---
It‚Äôs summer somewhere
---
If they took out features that were kinda bugged then there wouldn't be much game left :)
---
Yes, thank you. I couldn't remember the name.
---
Am I the only one that cleanse because of the satisfaction of insteahealing and removing that annoying green puke on the screen? It's like exploding the plastic bubbles for me.
---
no it's not, the main objective to a game is having fun and what is so fun about generators?
---
Always wind up ur hatchets fully bcs they are much faster that way and more unpredictable
---
Perfect. I've been looking for where to sign up but it's always in stealth!
---
I crouch spam in sympathy because I failed one first.
---
The main physical objective in the game is GENERATORS. I for sure know I have more fun when I escape. If you‚Äôre not being chased by the killer why the fuck would you not be doing a generator????? What else you want people to be doing?
---
Last night, it was 2 Freddys, a Wraith, and a Ghostface. Only one of those (Ghostface) I somewhat understand the camping.
---
It's probably so imbalanced that it balances itself out...
---
Waits 30 mins for a survivor match.
---
Finally join match.
---
Killer dodges.
---
Almost unbelievable that they didn‚Äôt have it before, but good news regardless.
---
The biggest thing with 360's is not getting too close the the survivor. Often times the same motions as baiting out dead hard will bait out a 360 attempt and then, bap! Free hit.
---
The doctor in dead by daylight, ans the saying an apple a day keeps the doctor away
---
Im doing really well as him! I think that with most killers they have to be right for you! People say hillbilly is amazing but i struggle with him, however everyone is saying oni is bad and im loving him!
---
Hag worse than demo? What the actual fuck?
---
I was under this impression too. It‚Äôs based on killer movement speed.
---
Guarantee this would probably save you from the Oni if you said this to him

Anything else but a generator, survivors complain about needing a second objective and second objectives have always been in the game. The actual main physical objective is to "survive" the trial, but the characters are locked into a death spiral by an eldritch god, so that is untenable. Bill is literally dead, he's not coming back for L4D3. If you enjoy ranking, then you fulfill emblems to pip, but Deadbydaylight is closer to a sandbox game than you would initially perceive and you're thinking one dimensionally.
---
I had 3 games yesterday with the killer running NOED. Every single time it spawned next to the last gen and I cleansed it.
---
It was worth it before they changed healing times. Now it takes a long ass time to heal by yourself, especially longer if the killer has Sloppy or Thana (which in my experience has gotten a lot more common, especially Sloppy); and that time could be spent on a gen or doing something else. In my experience (and the experience of a lot of people, that made this a mainstream thing) people running Self Care will prioritize Self Caring above anything else, ignoring gens, unhooks, healing teammates, etc.; which hurts survivors A LOT.
---
Finding another teammate and getting healed by them, or finishing a gen with them and then healing them or them you is always going to be a better time management option. People have done the math with multiple variables and it works.
---
There‚Äôs also other healing perks that work amazingly better, like Adrenaline or Nancys perk (off the name sorry). People run self care like I run Spine Chill, because I feel naked without it. And feeling like you can‚Äôt win without a certain perk, when that perk takes approximately 32 seconds (I may be wrong) to work properly can cost a team the game. Getting used to being injured for a little while can make or break a match for survivors.
---
No bashing on you or your build of course, but objectively there‚Äôs multiple other perks to run preferably, and to play more optimally. The amount of times I have seen a game go by because I‚Äôm hooked, someone is being chased or on a gen at the other side of the map, and I go into struggle or die because someone is healing in a corner is disgustingly high.
---
I thought that everyone already know that when you buy this game you'll get some hate message sooner or later. You cannot expect an online game without some salt, as someone enjoys it. And I can use whatever I want, if it doesn't bother you :)

‚ÄúImagine tattoo‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not drawing tattoo‚Äù gold lol. I agree we need an art studio Jeff skin

&gt; 5 % chance of the Killer running NOED.
---
I wish it were to be 5%
---
It‚Äôs not accurate. It‚Äôs based on the opinion of anyone that plays the game. Which is largely dictated by streamers and whatever other people parrot from other people

Had a game against a Bubba yesterday who was trying to let the last guy, a Rank 10 Jake who played like Rank 40, go free. He tried taking him to the hatch 6 times but he always wiggled free and ran away in the opposite direction, then tried showing him the door by just standing there and hitting the switch... in the end, he was accused of slugging and camping.
---
I felt so bad for him.
---
I also have to admit, I wouldn't have had the patience this guy had. I would've just hooked him after the second escape.
---
Behaviour really out here giving skins to the big 4 but forget their other characters
---
Good job!
---
Well sure, and the old Decisive Strike was a good counter to dying.
---
We have this feature on mobile.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the Plague and Legion came out after the Clown?
---
Anyway, as someone who plays console, I enjoy playing the Plague right now. She's got great perks that aren't meta, such as Ingectious Fright and Corrupt Intervention. 
---
Ghostface is also fun to play, and has some decent perks. I'd say the only thing not to do as him is rely too much on stalking survivors. 
---
Demogorgon is pretty nice, I haven't played him too much, but he seems like an okay Killer if you learn to play him well.
---
The Oni just came out a few days ago. He's able to dash like Billy and one shot survivors using his Blood Fury ability, but you have to charge the ability up using blood from injured survivors. Nemesis is a fun perk (completely breaks Myers if you use a certain addon with Nemesis...)
---
Legion is Legion. Apart from his perks, he's basically awful to play as.
---
Honestly, I don‚Äôt see how any of these perks work together. MYC is not an obsession perk, and furtive chase barely does anything at all. The only use I could see is using billy or oni, running back to hook, getting stunned by the new obsession so he has oblivious, quitting the chase, and then coming back for him (assuming you know where he is and he doesn‚Äôt know where you are). And even in that very specific case furtive chase does nothing.
---
So its a risk/reward situation for the survivor. Maybe the killer has noed, maybe they don't, either you can knock down bones to be sure or risk the one-hits at the end game. The whole point of adding hexes to the game was to give the survivors something to do with their time besides shred through generators in seconds.
---
Mine does the same, she also loves trying to slap the cursor when I'm picking loadouts and characters.
---
DBD took the canon only established in the ORIGINAL, not the movies after it. And since there‚Äôs no indication in it they‚Äôre related, it ain‚Äôt incest.
---
When you play on console you need to change the language of the console if pc I think change the language of steam but idk
---
See? This is why you are being downvoted. You think you are the enlightened voice of reason while grouping people that play survivor into a stupid stereotype (that is used way too much to silence survivor mains that want a fair game experience) that was never part of the discussion in the first place. You are just bringing in confrontation shit and being dickish, then complaining it‚Äôs entitled survivor mains that are downvoting you for ‚Äúspeaking the truth‚Äù lmao
---
No.
---
I thought tier lists are now forbidden in this subreddit?
---
Dbd only has the first movie, which indicates nothing about them being siblings

Like what challenge u are having trouble with?
---
Lol if speaking truth is being dick then fuck you too man. LMAO
---
Fucking anti noed whiners
---
I‚Äôm rank 4 and I really want to be a lower rank because killers like to sweat their balls off along with my survivor team mates. Honestly I want a mode that has a no game changing offering,no items, and no ads-ons just so I can play less sweaty games sometimes
---

Spine chill is a good perk. I‚Äôve been playing for a few months now and I still use it against stealthy killers. I run spine chill, Meg‚Äôs sprint burst and adrenaline, and Jake‚Äôs Iron will I think it‚Äôs called (the one where you make no noise from injuries). I think that perk is genuinely a must because after going so long without making noise from injured, I play like I‚Äôm not injured anyway. You can level Jake to 30 (which isn‚Äôt bad at all) and grab that teachable and go for any other character. There are god tier perks like decisive strike but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using them till you get better at the game. Claudette‚Äôs self care is also a good beginner perk that a lot of people still run. I personally don‚Äôt use it bc you can either spend 30 seconds healing yourself or 30 seconds getting gens/using that time to save someone but if you‚Äôre a beginner, I recommend it. It‚Äôll help you get better with skill checks and will make you live longer throughout a trial
---
Found the killer main. (I play both sides btw)
---
I've seen many die because they have left the doors at 99. Stop doing that shit, End game lasts a few minutes, you have all the time to save your team.
---
lol aw
---
Let me guess, because I‚Äôm a killer everything I have to say about survivors is invalid. Now, if I was a survivor main my opinion would suddenly be valid.  
---
Don‚Äôt use trash arguments like that to disprove someone‚Äôs view.  
---
I don‚Äôt bm as a survivor nor as a killer, because I experienced the shittyness of it.  
---
This example isn‚Äôt toxic.
---
*the Witcher has entered the chat*
---
Nice onimation
---
Sure, dear. Nice attitude, it will take you far
---
Also, no one complains about NoED now, mate, the fuck? People either cleanse it beforehand or killers are smart enough to rely on early/mid game to win
---
Master of angry Skywalkers he is.
---
Nah man, just genuinely curious. Never said it was, just seemed a bit sketch you decided to say "you survivors". Have your view.
---
Clown is terrible. Absolute no map pressure
---
Unhook 1 survivor safely during the endgame collapse. If I am able to manage to get there though all the survivors escape or are on there final hook.
---
Play with him/her so he/she can stop bothering you
---
Might be a big gamble, but there are plague players like me, that actually are bad at using the fountains and cleansing is a good option.
---
This is on ps4 and my conslone is in english (all my other games are aswell) but DBD seems to refuse changing to english
---
I know what you mean but it doesn't matter when she can aoe attack from range.
---
That‚Äôs just a regular Oni with demon dash speed addons
---
Brutal strength, Enduring, Pop goes the weasel, Overcharge, Save the best for last, Distressing
---
They are all good for Doc, use the ones you are more comfortable with..make some test, nothing happens if you lose some games
---
That killer looked so defeated. Good stuff.
---
I also play both and your idea isn't that good
---
Enduring and PGTW. Doctor doesn‚Äôt really need Whispers and could use help with large, safe loops and gen control.
---
Putting nurse in b tier shows it's some random that doesn't know what he's talking about
---
I‚Äôll cleanse if I‚Äôm on death hook or if someone else cleanses first
---
Its a bug. Hit a survivor to become free. Or any ability that can move you (teleport...). :)
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs a rough one. Idk bringing a toolbox to help genrush could help a lot. Getting the killer to farm can be tricky cuz they might hook everyone twice before the EGC... but yeah that‚Äôs like the only one I don‚Äôt have good tips for because you have to go through a whole game before u get a chance at it. I got it through luck tbh..
---
[This](https://youtu.be/O6jjb2w5das)
---
I didn‚Äôt make the tier list. It‚Äôs a community voted tier list. I think
---
Can you say why it's not good?
---
Killers when they hook the same person for the third time in a row
---
Thanks
---
Good luck man!!
---
Survivors: ‚Äúwe want something to do other than gens, they‚Äôre boring!‚Äù *totems now exist* ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt want something to do other than gens!‚Äù *confusion noises intensify*
---
So unfortunately I dont think this would be the big reveal on how to escape because we see what the entity does to survivors when they aren't fuel anymore which is the "burnt" things we see in the alchemist cutscene but I dont think its impossible to escape knowing bhvr it's probably something like not playing the actual game
---
OVERALL, yes it does make her less powerful than Freddy, Spirit, Billy.
---
Wow, amazing. All I can say.
---
‚ÄúSaid a lot of damn people‚Äù FTFY
---
As a Piggy main shame on you... they must boop the snoot to unhook.
---
Theyre related
---
If it glows it goes, if it doesn't glow, why should it go?
---
Nice!!
---
I'm also really glad that you did not tbagged the killer and just escaped. Keep being an awesome survivor!
---
Well it obviously depends on the rank as NOED is a Perk that mostly supports bad Killers. Capable high rank Killers don't see that much of a reason to run NOED. If the Survivors facing them actually care about the perk, they'll cleanse anyway.
---
Get hooked and take the points you earned being butthurt is worse when you don't have BP's to sooth the wounds!
---
ü•∞ I thought someone would bring this up. Thanks!
---
Oh she got out the other exit  :)
---
I often have two cats in between me and the computer screen when I play. They never leave me alone. XD
---
I love them though.
---
Hence why the perk is a strange concept to me.
---
While you have an adorable cat, I‚Äôd like to know...
---
What was the per he was blocking?
---
It's seems crazy, but this is main reason I don't play survivor.
---
You waste time getting the power up and finding the survivors again, also it rarely happens to hit multiple survivors with it
---
A) fuck NOED‚Äîit‚Äôs a cheap win (I understand why it exists, I understand it has counterplay, but still feels cheap to be hit by it‚Äîand subsequently face camped); B) ez 5k points; C) there are few things in this game that give better feelings satisfaction than denying a killer NOED.
---
Ladies and gentlemen, killer and survivor mains. Can you tell which is which?
---
No, we dont want early prototypes, they are much worse than current ones.
---
The one good thing the hooked in basement and then falling through the floor bug had: Struggle was automated.

I love playing with teammates that cleanse even before they become broken.

Id switch freddy for spirit but thats ok

I like it but why does he need to be shirtless

I could understand that change
---
Dang how did you even see him
---
Not a repost. Maybe someone else made it before me, but if that's the case, I didn't know that.
---
Highly doubt they're ever gonna change it given that theres an achievement for killing every survivor in a single trial. And even if that wasnt the case, there's no reason to really. Killers who just mori survs first chance they get just hurt their chances of ranking up.

He wasn't revving his chainsaw at all, and with Borrowed Time we could have easily gotten away. Also, I was hooked before the last gen popped, meaning I'd get the speedboost from Adrenaline as well as Hope

I just think noed should be reworked to tier up like remember me, every time you hook someone in the trial you get a token. There should be rewards at 1 and 3 hooks, giving you small benefits for the end game, and 5 hooks to unlock the exposed status effect, that way you can remove the hex and only give people the insta down if they earn it. That‚Äôs my biggest problem with noed, I‚Äôll dick on some guy all game, and he just cleans up shop without deserving. I just think you should have to earn it like some other perks ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Borrowed time only would help YOU. not the person who saved you. 
---
Tbh if a killer is camping you in the end game you having adrenaline doesn‚Äôt help them at all. Imo if a killer than can one shot or has NoED is camping at the end I do leave because it‚Äôs too risky. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too selfish, I at least try and scope the situation out first. It‚Äôs unfortunate it‚Äôs still also an individual game too.
---
no pretty smooth, maybe your in need of a new controller ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£
---
oh i didnt kno this would be sarcastic hehe. i was playing sanctum of wrath yesterday as killer. the map is notoriously dark. i kept moving around the rocks through the plants and felt like there was an obstacle there, i look down and finally see a crouched claudette perfectly still like an easter egg in the grass. it's funny, on that map it's the killers that need flashlights. slowly looking thru the thick plants
---
It's easy. Just work on gens and don't stay in the arena when the last gen goes up. You will be done and out in 4 minutes.
---
I swear clown can‚Äôt cut corners good because his hitbox is big.
---
&gt; love the audacity to put me in basement when I wasn't wiggling
---
That's it guys, Killer mates pack your bags and leave the game or agree to serve the whims of your Survivor Overlords.
---
Oof. That sucks. I got lucky and ended up in a match with a killer trying to derank, so he was wraith, went invisible and we never saw him the rest of the match.
---
Lmao
---
I feel like it‚Äôs not that great because Oni fucking stomps around and you can hear exactly where he‚Äôs moving by footsteps.
---
#Anyone else notice the two Dark Senses?
---
Chill out, lmao. Of course I see it as a mechanic, that's what it is. And a boring one at that. Scratched mirror, Ghostface, Pig are much better at creating a scary atmosphere than fucking NOED lmao. 
---
I dunno what's that "yOu AlL cOmE fRoM cOd" argument. I don't. I came for the horror like setting too. But it's ultimately a game, and games have mechanics, hence the criticism on said mechanics.
---
Yep. Also on ps4. Bad queues for killer and survivor.
---
I see people insta down with his ability like it‚Äôs an m1 (really fast) but I have to hold m1 until he holds his weapon above his head for a bit and then bashes with a controller. Haven‚Äôt gotten the hang of it yet.

Nah, average american nurse uniform during WW2 was short sleeved and about knee length.
---
Nurse has an outfit highly matching [Georgina Pope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgina_Pope) who was most active in the field from about 1900 up through WW1
---
This feels like a personal attack
---
The killer queue times are a nightmare right now, even before Oni came out. Literally forced to become a survivor main to get enjoyment out of this game still.
---
How about a mankini Bill? Amirite fellas? I'm here all night...
---
Morris should only work after 2 hooks. Keys also need to be looked into, I have some ideas but it would seem absurd like making it take a few seconds to open. Of course I also think the hatch should be able to be open without a key just take a really long time.
---
Killer main here.
---
If you want killers to start running other things don't reward them for running it. If they down and hook someone and camp waiting for the save, just escape. Enough de-pipping one kill games should teach them. It's usually people being altruistic and going for saves that turns a 1K into a 3K. 
---
However, this idea that the five gens are repaired so the survivors win and shouldn't die is misleading too. The exit gates and endgame collapse exist for a reason. That's a phase of the game too and there are perks designed specifically for it. If the killer runs endgame perks they don't have any effect until that stage which means everything else up to that point is easier. 
---
Cleansing all 5(I think?) totems is unreasonably difficult--I get that. But it's not unreasonable to do one or two. Especially because most run Ruin so you're doing one anyway.  You'll likely know the location of a dull totem or two by the time you're nearing the final gens. Run by one on your way to the exit gates. 25Ÿ™ chance at getting NOED for free(33% if two totems were cleansed). The killer gets zero benefit from the perk slot and you win.
---
Hi there.
---
I used to have the same problem. What I did in order to fix that problem was move the game files to another drive. I moved it from C: (my Windows drive) to D: (an external drive I had). If that's not possible, I recommend you try and maximize your gaming performance by downloading a software like Razer Cortex, which frees up RAM while you're gaming.
---
Hear me out. The animation should take as much time as hitting wiping blade and then picking up. So it's equal to taking another hit anyways.

Description: Hey everyone, I'll try and keep this as short as possible. I was in a normal solo match against bubba, for some reason after bubba got me I got stuck in an infinite healing position, meaning dwight was still able to heal me - and I was able to heal him even tough there was no animation for that, however the killer was not able to pick me up and not even the freaking endgame collapse was able to kill me xD, even after I disconnected bubba was still stuck in the game, only when I pressed "continue" he was finally freed from the curse :D

Middle of the reeds and it really sucks when they run the skin that as the yellow blotches because there is a structure that has the same color in it

Imo the dull key should have a chance of breaking when trying to open the hatch

I mean the characters, not the way they worked.

Yeah... I can last a lot longer broken where she has to hit me, a lot better than if she has her projectile damage.
---
Is this a cry for help?
---
Reduce the stun after using their power or make it based on how much ability energy you have left- more energy for a shorter stun, that way you're still punished for missing a hit but knowing when to cancel makes chases shorter.

Bhvr made it, Strarbreeze published it.
---
i only cleanse if my teammates are bc ill screw them over if i cleanse and they are staying broken :( its a one shot for them either way but except with the vomit stuff its harder to dodge
---
Inb4 ‚ÄúKiller wasn‚Äôt tunneling DS is OP bc it‚Äôs not only available for use 10 seconds after being unhooked!‚Äù
---
oh i though 505 games published it?
---
While that would make more sense, Pebble Gang has to represent!
---
Am I going crazy or are you two meaning to talk about Open-Handed
---
Also Noed.
---
Yeah, definitely!
---
This would be another objective tho :/
---
Yea. Right now keys are useless except for the hatch. Their aura reading is a joke since you need addons for it. Especially for the broken key.
---
Again, it‚Äôs likely the person unhooking you would be the one to go down either before they could unhook OR after. They‚Äôre in the line of the killer longer. It is simply WAAAAy Too risky. Plus you didn‚Äôt know at the time if they were running borrowed time or anything of that sort. 
---
I get it, it sucks but it‚Äôs the way the game is now. Imo killers should be more rewarded for doing other stuff rather than camping in the endgame so that they might be willing to try and accomplish more.
---
Blood warden is a fun perk
---
Imagine missing it
---
Hmm no? Where did you get that info?
---
I seriously doubt they could see you. With 4 gens left you either do that particular gen cos you don't see the killer, or because you're tryna set him free, but doesn't look like the latter here.
---
We‚Äôre probably only gonna get about 1 per chapter :(
---
No she's gay
---
the box of the ps4 port or did i get a thing wrong
---
Well that would be cool the game may get a little pay to win, but a good idea i would support it
---
Nice
---
It's not useless with my build. I run thrilling tremors. So if I know a survivor is on a gen I fake teleport, they run off, I pick up the survivor, thrilling temors activates. Hook the survivor. TP to that gen then use Pop goes the weasel. Fake TP is very beneficial for me
---
I agree with the bubba part but not the noed. I always go for it, theres at least a chance with noed.
---
Everybody on this reddit cares about this post. üòÑüòá
---
Thank you friend. I appreciate that a lot!
---
Cute Keyboard
---
It's because the Legion's feral frenzy is no longer a basic attack, which allowed Legion to have quite a few decent builds that could differ from the normal "spirit fury+enduring" build.  
---
because of this, sloppy butcher no longer works with their power, thanatophobia is practically useless because they reduced mending times, remember me no longer works with their power and save the best for last, a lot of nice perks that felt good on Legion but are now basically useless.  
---
If people think this is a buff then they really don't play much Legion or Killer at all, just giving Legion a speed boost isn't going to be enough to counter the fact that their build diversity was killed and their healing slowdown was also pretty gutted.
---
Personally I think it's fine the way it is because if they did make everyone unique on the survivor side it would make some people (like myself) who enjoy switching up their playstyle from time to time go nuts trying to grind out bp to get decent stuff for each one. Killers it makes sense since they all have different powers, but for survivors it sounds like a nightmare for all that extra grind if the differences were significant enough.
---
A lot of survivors get extremely salty when people play bubba, even when fairly. I find that really strange considering he's one of the worst killers in game. Dollar store Billy if you will, but damn he sure is fun to play.
---
Neither are you, you cancerous dipshit. All you do is talk down on people and call them shit all the while you knew what i was saying. Whoopdiefuckingdoo it's latency and not hitboxes. Boehoe. God you are an asshole. Treat your friends that way as well when they make a point but use the wrong phrasing? Keep being a cancerous asshole bro
---
I feel that Legion improved after chapter release. Yes, they nerfed Mend time by 3 seconds, but overall changes in FF (basically almost back to release numbers), speed and  vaults made his Power work much better than before.
---
FF still serves its purpose - you have easy initial hit, you have tracking information, you have some slowdown from Mend.
---
FF hits do not count as basic anymore, but I dont see why ppl cry about it. You dont have stacks of SBFTL? So what? If ppl are injured all time, why you even need SBFTL? And if they heal you can get FF hit vey easy on them, so again, you dont need SBFTL.
---
Sloppy? Same, if ppl do not heal - it has no effect, if they heal, well, it is 3 seconds additional healing time lost, not a big deal really.
---
Maybe biggest impact you get from that nerf is Franklins's, since you cant make them drop items with FF hits.
---
My go-to build at Rank 1 is: Discordance, Enduring (sometimes Thana instead), M&amp;A, Pop.
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/517151290](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/517151290) \- this is what you can do sometimes with updated FF speed

[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/518310174](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/518310174) \- here is Legion games from latest stream of me, lost 2 games through all stream, cause I do not tryhard in my games.
---
Recap: Merciless (4k), Merciless (4k), Ruthless (4k), Merciless (4k), Displeased (2k), Ruthless (3k), Displeased (1k), Ruthless (3k). In both 3k games I just didnt slug to get last guy and they either had hatch or gates, so if I was tryharding those would be 4k as well. Overall K/R in those 3 games - 3.125. Clearly overperforming by BVHR standarts, so expect them to nerf Legion again :D
---
Actually after chapter release I've decided switch to Legion as my Main from Doctor till Doctor rework (ofc if rework will be good rework, not nerfstick up the ass of giggle boy)
---
So am I the weirdo for never having a problem revealing him?
---
That's not what I'm saying. I completely agree both sides do the same things to each other. My point is the game has gotten really stale because it's the same varying 8 perks every single game. No one wants to try anything new, no one wants to play around with fun combinations. Most people are pretty basic, and it's getting boring. We have so many killers now that all do their own unique things but everyone still wants to run the same perks on each one. No one wants to see what may synergize really well with their kit, like Dark Devotion on Oni or PWYF on Plague.
---
The issue is this game wasn't designed to be taken this competitively. There wasn't supposed to be a meta. This isn't Overwatch. Yet everyone takes it so damn seriously, and all for what? A colored number by their name that serves nearly 0 purpose? There are no rewards and the matchmaking sucks anyways. No one is having fun anymore, even the people trying really hard to win every game.
---
You want them to save you from a camping Cannibal?
---
Pretty sure the perk you're wishing for is Corrupt Intervention.
---
I took it more as FUUUUUU and is fuck i missed up.
---
Too late for that.
---
If they gave everyone a free bonus, they'd have to nerf the base.
---
Also, imagine maining Ace, having all the perks and cosmetics on him and having him get bonus luck when meg gets 1% speed increase.
---
I saw only one good post about that where every survivor had some downsides and upsides, but still, those changes would have to come with another massive game rework if the game was ever going into the dying state
---
yeah
---
Dont have her yet
---
Nice repost
---
Scottish.
---
You just gotta have a good idea if where the center of the screen actually is. I play a lot of Huntress so I naturally have such an easy time revealing him.
---
[Here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level)
---
I love these so much!!
---
I main Nurse so the center of the screen is usually easier for me to locate. 
---
Plus if you just focus on Ghostfaces forehead you usually get a good trail on revealing him
---
*Insert No0b3 wow sound effect*
---
Even better, if there's only one gen left and you know there are more dull totems, wait until the last gen gets repaired. 
---
 Having an x% chance of cleansing NOED right away is way better than having to look around the map for the last damn totem.
---
I‚Äôm a Jeff main but he‚Äôs only level one for me. I‚Äôm trying to level hag then I‚Äôll focus on survivor
---
I have been playing for a while tag me in posts or pm me any questions you have I should be of some help to you
---
This is why I always run black incense. Easy kills
---
Excellent idea
---
It's great on Oni for a couple of reasons.
---
First of all, Oni's only real weakness is the early game, where you have to get a barebone chase M1 hit before you can start building toward your (rather ridiculous) strength, which is obviously Blood Fury. Monitor helps you "sneak up" on survivors, getting closer to them and having less distance to catch up over in that initial chase, and potentially even catching them off-guard, especially given what /u/SaltInflicter also mentioned about Oni's custom heartbeat sound effect.
---
In Blood Fury, as you say, charging at people with Monitor gives them less time to react, not being warned as early about Oni dashing at their position.
---
Even now that slugging for the entire Fury duration isn't quasi-mandatory like it was in the PTB, Infectious Fright is still inarguably the best perk for Oni, since it enables you to reliably get as much value out of every time spent in Fury as possible, even just straight-up winning games off of it. Monitor increases Fright's detection radius by 8m, making it even more reliable and thus helping you get even more value out of it.
---
Holy shit its true lol. I never noticed because I always skip the opening. Sorry, you were right
---
The inking on this is amazing!
---
Na it‚Äôs fine. happens to me all the time.
---
Np glad I could help
---
I do because every shit hole survivor who is like this gets a little bit pissed when he reads it
---
I think I'm going crazy, because I could swear when I read the thread title before replying, it said Open-Handed and not Kindred.
---
The whole map is like this, litteraly get stuck on everything while blinking...
---
Saw 2nd panel eyes.  
---
Me: That's that SrGrafo guy.
---
oni op pls nerf
---
Yeah but that also doesn't make them good either, just because you're good at every killer and can still 4K with them doesn't exactly make them all good killers, there are still better or worst killers no matter how skilled you are.
---
actually... wow
---
but then they wouldn't actually do this because it interferes with the lore of the game...
---
Oh my god. I can't control what the other players do when I'm on the hook.
---
I think this post is just true. And it's also funny, so I do care.
---
Only on console. Starbreeze was the original publisher for pc.
---
Yes this is what I needed, a nice write-up on why it made sense. I already thought about M&amp;A+Infectious but I didn't think about his weak early game. Thank you so much.
---
Unbeakable, decisibe strike, iron will and dead hard
---
Funny how one sentence of yours compliments the other
---

---
more like phases in the family HEH
---
Hope is so bad they should make the perk like noed, a totem the killer needs to destroy if he doesnt do it the new hope give 115% speed for the survivor when the gens are done(they have to extend the generators times for that)
---
nobody says that they should revert legion 
---
we want a buff/rework (me personally -- rework)
---
True.
---
OoO makes it so he can see you but you can't see him when you're asleep. So that's quite pointless.
---
Old legion had no counterplay and shouldn't have been in the game, new legion was fine, I think giving them speed buffs without removing the fact that Feral Frenzy was a basic attack would've been alright.  
---
At this point, just because Legion is faster, doesn't exactly mean that their power is overall better, they also reduced mending times which was a big part of slowdown for Legion, and most people ran Sloppy Butcher on them to add even more slowdown, build diversity was gutted and right now the only people saying Legion is fine are the ones clinging onto a character they deeply care for.  
---
If you can kill every survivor with every killer in the game, does that mean every killer in the game is good? No. Legion has been the worst killer for awhile now, and they got one of the biggest nerfs yet, a speed boost isn't going to really counteract this at all..maybe on a smaller map, but even then most maps are bigger, so.
---
yes I do
---
Yep Someone cleansing isn't a problem but it becomes a problem when everybody instantly cleanses because soon she will have insta down spit everywhere. I try not to cleanse until there's 2-1 gen left.
---
That would put me at 15540 shards, so leveling up to get the outfit is out the window but I don't wanna waste 10$ on it
---
Turns out I got it first try. Had to play a little selfishly(not doing any saves or chases) but it wasn't that bad. It may also have been related to the fact that the trapper I played against seemed to not especially know what he was doing. He seemed to constantly be resetting his traps.
---
She was terrible, holy shit

---
Would you like to have a system like that?
---
Nah, you have to be the admin's bitch first
---
Well, I have all Killers maxed out, so I dont really need those BP anymore. Unlocked Oni teachables already, and it will not take much time to get them on all Killers, and then max out Oni. It will come eventually, way before new chapter release anyway.
---
Enduring is one of the strongest perks on M1 Killers, and even better on Legion, since if you force survivor stun you during FF, you have 1 second stun instead of 4 seconds fatique. Plus it is very good on unsafe pallets. You should never respect pallets as Killer, and if you have Enduring it will pay you up a lot of times.
---
I'd like to see one QoL change in Legion, which I dont understand why implemented on him in first place - normal hits deplete 50% of FF charge. Normal hits should not affect his Power, no other Killer has that BS.
---
Imagine Spirit losing 50% of her charge on normal hit? Or Myers? Or GF? Or Nurse losing charge on hit? Why such BS is implemented on Legion whos Power is not even lethal?
---
Rin had to die to get a real family lol
---
we have this on mobile, so this could be a feature in the future maybe
---
It would dissapoint you mostly
---
I think they got sued because of some Jason rights
---
I play both a lot. Always have, I do favor killer more but when I play survivor I find 1 hook moris just frustrating granted ita much better. The "good old days" it didnt require a hook but survives had brand new part which would instantly complete a generator
---
That squeaky Sydney voice aha.
---
How did he get back into the map, through the same rock?
---
He is absolute dogshit at any other games he plays so I expect he'll be back before the month is out.
---
No problem my man üòé
---
Then you cant exclusively blame the killer. They may be a POS for camping you, but you're teammates are equally at fault for being too stupid to use perks that counter facecamps while going for a save with the killer nearby
---
Whenever I get in this situation in the Killer is camping me and I am their only hook of the game I tell my team to leave. there's no purpose in rewarding the killer at the end of the game by trading hooks. him ending up getting a brutal because we just kept dumbly swapping hooks
---
First time?

Description: After downing and hooking the first Survivor the ‚Äúcarrying Survivor‚Äù music continues to play the entire game. 
---
It stops whilst in chase but comes back when the chase ends. 
---
The music continues to play regardless of audio changes due to a Killers power or perks (for example it still plays as cloaked Wraith, Ghostface in Night Shroud, when using Whispers it plays over the Entity, it plays whilst using Insidious, when collecting a Corrupt Fountain as Plague it plays over the enchanting whispers) 
---
Steps to Reproduce: Literally pick up and hook a downed Survivor
---
Reproduction Rate: For myself it‚Äôs 100%. Happens every game.
---
The only way i‚Äôve found to temporarily remove it is to let a Survivor wiggle off me. However as soon as I pick up and hook a Survivor it comes back again.

You blacked out your username even though the survivor says it in the reply

Worse then get unhook during endgame?

Hahahahah

I turned off chat ages ago.  I actually got more salt from survivors while playing survivor.

Too early

You have to love the idiots who try to cleanse in a chase. I can't tell you how many times someone broke line of sight and tried to cleanse like I wasn't gonna come grab them .
---
Incest is a myth btw.
---
I always get a little disappointed when I‚Äôm the last guy and don‚Äôt wiggle and get hooked- but you can‚Äôt seriously throw a fit over it. Sometimes the killer is nice and lets you get out, it‚Äôs a 50/50.
---
Noooo they're just behind his glasses!
---
They've already done this with the new chapter
---
as is the nature when Myers enters the space
---
This exactly! These guys think they have all the best ways to survive and I see level 1's getting dropped because they refuse to cleanse. And personally it depends on the map and location...if I'm near shack, that red attack of the plague is easy to avoid(usually). 
---
Cleansing can be bittersweet depending on the location,map and amount of gens completed...but IT IS SITUATIONAL.
---
Jeff's black metal skin is awesome, but then I'm also a fan of that genre of music so I really appreciate it.
---
Sorry for the long reply but... 
---
I had a really interesting game where the opposite of this happened last night, where me and the killer got into a standstill I have never had before.  Me and another survivor were alive and then they got downed.  Hiding right by the hatch I eagerly awaited the survivor to get hooked as they were far from the hatch and dead on hook.  The killer did not want to give me the hatch, so they refused to pick up the survivor.   Eventually I revived the other survivor, only to have the same thing happen again, and then AGAIN.  10+ minutes later we are in the same situation, where the killer can't find me and refuses to hook the survivor.   
---
By this time I need to go up and see my wife so I run into the middle of the screen to get caught.  I am convinced they hate my guts after forcing them to run around the map for 10 minutes doing nothing.. and they proceed to drop me on the hatch and hook the other survivor, telling me that was a super fun game and they wanted to reward my strong play.  I was prepared to get verbally abused, but instead I was a hero.  It's the reason DBD is worth playing!
---
So I decided to change my Steam name to "Camped By Bubba" the other day and then when I got into a match with a Bubba he camped me and ONLY me that game. No one else. Just me. I wanted to be bad but U reckon he was doing it for the laughs due to the name I was using so he made it happen. I don't get as annoyed by Insidious Bubbas anymore because I feel like most of them do it for the sake of the meme. I'm tempted to play as Insidious Bubba sometimes just because it is kind of funny when you go to unhook someone and then he flies out of nowhere with his chainsaw and you're both downed at the same time.
---
Yeah, which doesn't make the others unviable...
---
It's in her bio,m stating they're siblings.
---
I dont know why most people just dont get it.
---
God*
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
sounds like megatron mixed with bane
---
Sometimes they don't know where the killer is though which happens a lot. Also I disagree it's not stupid how are they supposed to know if the killer is gonna face camp or not that's ridiculous.
---
I don't think I'm an expert on balance. I just don't want to be labelled as a survivor or killer main. One of my problems with NoEd is maps with tricky totem spawns. There's usually one totem that's hard to find on every map. Leave it to a Redditor to be an ass hole to someone for having a difference in opinion. "Spend less time clicking flashlights". I don't click flashlights. I rarely use items. So please don't assume shit about me. You can't compare NoEd and Adrenaline because Adrenaline procs after survivors have completed their objective. NoEd procs after killer failed to do their job. I rarely run either of those perks unless I don't currently have a better perk on a survivor or killer. Because I don't think they're balanced perks.
---
Well I'm trying to say it trough text and I don't perfectly flashlight save often I just use that as timing for myself
---
yeah but look at how stupid their player names are! you're name-shaming. jk. nice moon
---
First salty survivors?
---
500h?
---
Was this the first time you read the chat?
---
Well I guess it‚Äôs time to sabo some hooks
---
Screen name as in my username or flair?
---
haha i do that too. sometimes thats all their is. not everyday u see a tree with human arms stickin out
---
There is no being saved by a camping Cannibal. Take pride in having played better than him and move on. Adrenaline and/or Borrowed Time would have done nothing to help here as he can rev and down at least one, if not more, of you guys. Asking your teammates to save you from that would have gave the Cannibal more kills than he deserved.
---
Counting the 4k without noed and cleansed totems as a win for Noed is like saying bloodwarden is a win if you can't use it, because survivors leave and don't stay around. A perk that you got no use of is a "loss" because you could have used another perk.
---
I agree, that NOED is totally frustrating and searching for dull totems to deny a noed is more often than not a bad idea. But atleast with the totem change the Perk can be dealt with a bit better.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple iridescent emblems (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
I believe its intentional since spine chill now goes off even if the killer is undetectable.

Damn, this is like the teacher asking for a sentence and you enter a 3 whole paragraphs. Hats off to you my dude. Have my upvote

Ooga Booga
---
If you really have seen movies, you know what happens in the end. Remaining survivors win the fight, rejoice, regroup and are about to leave the setting when all of a sudden WHAM! Killer comes back out of no where and kills at least one of them, to make sure only the protagonist escapes.
---
That's what NOED is suppose to be in this game. If you cant see that then just go talk to devs.
---
&gt; it's ultimately a game 
---
Yes but its not a competitive game, its a party game. And those games are full of chances and RNG luck factors. So quit this mechanics and balance shit, this game has far pressing matters, when NOED is just an ethical talk for "serious (read whackos) gamers"
---
Many people are rank 1 lol it isn't THAT difficult.
---
Then you hear a *click click* and it all goes red.

New killer: Lego Yoda.
---
His power allows him to run over survivors in his 2001 Honda Civic and overdose on ketamine to instantly gain bloodlust stacks.
---
How come when people mention reworks for things that are meta on Killer nobody beats an eye but when people mention reworks for things that are meta for survivors everyone loses their shit.
---
DS literally gives you a free health state for 60 seconds and let's you be unafraid of the Killer which is super unhealthy for the game.
---
Also with the add on that reveals location when you vomit it‚Äôs basically a scratched mirror Myers at T2 with free Stridor/Surveillance
---
I gotta disagree. He is not as fast as the hillbilly. He has the mobility, but he is still incredibly weak to people just moving sharply in one direction, even around trees.  
---
I think removing his flick would make it very difficult to hit anyone with the dash.
---
here‚Äôs the way i look at it. if you don‚Äôt cleanse and remain broken, plague will be able to down you in one hit 100% of the time. if you do cleanse, she will one hit you only when she has her power (assuming she hits you). if your smart and cleanse in corners of the map she really isn‚Äôt that big of an issue
---

# ''OOGA BOOGA BITCH''
---
It's like survivors want the killer to throw themselves on the hook while they play M1 simulator.
---
Rank 1 means nothing. As you prove here.
---
Cleansing is 100% the right choice if you don't do it in stupid spots. As long as the killer isn't near and you don't show yourself to get downed again or you do it in spots the killer isn't present  normally like finished spots there's literally 0 reason not to cleanse.
---
As a rank 1 Plague player I can promise you there are so many situations in which I completely ignore people cleansing because I have better things to do.
---
Bill is the best survivor in the game
---
What if the wraith goes invisible and the survivor stands up then gets knocked to the ground immediately
---
Some killere aren't "faking giving you the exit". Some are allowing you to receive the points for opening the door before they kill you. They know that if you dont get it open all the way, you get no points whatsoever for the door. Sometimes they are thinking about you, but most times, yes, they're scamming you from exiting.
---
At least old DS could be countered
---
Difficult enough that you have to know about the game to get there
---
I run Whispers most of the time and I get survivors who will proudly announce themselves. Then I take it off and get 3 Blendettes lol
---
Surely they will come save me......
---
Bruh it's a facecamping Leatherface.  What would you have them do lol?
---
*better
---
Your comment has got to be one of the dumbest fucking things I've seen on here in a while.
---
Just because he wasn't revving his chainsaw doesn't mean that he wouldn't be when someone got there. There isn't enough time to save someone off the hook even when he isn't charging his chainsaw. I would have left your ass there to. I'm not trading places with you and being the one face camped just because you feel so entitled as to be the one saved because you ran the killer just because you were the one found after being the one to pop those 5 gens. 
---
You can take that entitlement and wipe your ass with it.
---
You won't lose out on them, they'll be back around 6 months later (minus the charms) from what I've heard (unless they went back on that)
---
Yeah survivors have to go out of their way to send killers salt and even then, you can just block all messages from anyone not on your friends list. It really helps the mood.
---
They really should make reporting chat logs easier, I've had a lot of abusive slurs thrown my way over a fuckin game.
---
Wasn't my intention to label, just responding to the comment that read as belittling and angry. 
---
I understand that tone is hard to convey via text so that may not have been your intent, but "you didn't do your job earlier" and "crutch" come across as.... not toxic, but definately not kind. *These* are petty insults, which you've turned around and put me on blast for.
---
As a nonbinary person, I see "guys" as gender neutral, and not unwarranted as you do not have how you would like to be addressed in your information. I understand that not everyone agrees with this, and that is fine, no toes were meant to be stepped on.
---
I know this is a dumb thread that has spiraled from a simple question about a video game, but seriously this whole damn player base needs to just chill out and think about how they speak to one another. The OP said one of the players dmd them and told them to go kill themselves because of a perk used in a video game. Let's just reflect on that for a bit.
---
Anyways, if you've made it this far, please know no ill intent was meant. GLHF

Description: regarding the very rare cosmetic for Oni. When in the pregame lobby, the pillars sticking out from Oni's shoulder pads blocks the torso/held item from the survivor on the far right of the lobby. Keys? Cant see at all. Toolbox? Maybe 15% of the box is shown. Etc.
---
Ok, so NOED is bullshit but ruin isn‚Äôt? Ruin can spawn in one location in the entire map, making the whole team or at least 1 have to search endlessly for it. And if it‚Äôs in a really good spot, the killer basically gets free hooks until then. Sometimes he get one or two survivors. NOED doesn‚Äôt guarantee jack shit. If the killer is trash, then NOED won‚Äôt change that. You‚Äôre just gonna have to juke them and play a little smarter and possibly more stealthy.
---
The Tru3Ta1ent hate is getting out of hand
---
they couldn't have saved you unless the bubba managed a really stupid misplay. Just kill yourself on hook at that point and move on to the next game, if you played well you'll still pip
---
Agreed. While a good looper can be frustrating, at least you‚Äôre DOING SOMETHING. As a survivor main I can appreciate a good play when I‚Äôm on Killer. But good god I HATE going against immersed teams. It‚Äôs to the point where if I see multiple Blendettes I‚Äôll just dodge the lobby. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt find it fun to do as a survivor, but I think it‚Äôs worse for killers because again you‚Äôre literally doing nothing but walk around searching and hoping you‚Äôll catch a glimpse or hear something
---
Play like a douche, don't act surprised if the killer punishes you
---
He wants you to change your perks!
---
Hopefully the devs release a skin with Amanda not having her pig head on, it would look pretty cool and I would definitely buy it tbh
---
This sounds awesome! I would totally buy it.
---
Yeah, and the last survivor is usually just taunting you at the exit. So why not?

*Actual Result*: Same as expected.

But if they always do

---
**OPERATION HEALTH WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION**
---
Issue is that ruin will arguably go down faster because everyone wants to get their perk up. Ruin already pops fairly quickly without much incentive to do other than the one totem. Four people trying to find a totem are bound to get ruin faster and they get a strong perk to go with it.
---
*YES*
---
He's literally Hillbilly with extra steps and some tiny advantages.
---
I only cleanse if the cleansing pool is super close to a gen that‚Äôs already done.  And I‚Äôm more likely to cleanse in this manner later on in the game. But yea I tend to try not to cleanse.
---
What exactly is fun about pressing m1 on and object and ignoring the killer? Do you know how much fun you can have if you never do a gen in a game and let the killer have a chance to play? Why do you feel like they don't get to deserve to play?
---
according to the lore the maps are a part of the entity, so this seems very fitting
---
For killer higher ranks get queued faster while low ranks take much longer. A friend of mine came back to the game and his first queue was 27 minutes long cause he was rank 20. For survivors it's the opposite, lower rank queues tend to be quicker.
---
If it's third hook DCing can be clutch if the killeris using on-hook perks (BBQ and PGTW)
---
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but the guy who owned the original Jason or whatever passed away.
---
Basically meant all the parts of the franchise got broken apart, and becoming a duel on who can grab most of the company.
---
Unfortunately, the collateral damage means the game developing stops, as well as movies etc
---
My personal favourite that I've seen was a red rank survivor that cleansed before being broken, unhooked my infected Ace, cleansed again, then joined me on a generator.
---
honestly I think thats a great way of putting it. And like, plague doesnt have the range or speed huntress has, so the trade off of it being constant is kinda fair. And I think you are right, everyone is running the fuck away from tier 3 mikey, but a lot of people will test their luck with huntress
---
I think that both are pretty unfair. Moris just take survivors out of the game because they went down twice and only compensate them with an animation. Keys are pretty nuts because it's like a mori, but you could do NOTHING all game and let your team die and do gens and all you have to do is a simple interaction, then you're out, aha gottem ggs. Both need to be changed eventually imo.
---
Exactly what you see here is what you can do on console, I‚Äôve been playing him non stop for the past few days and the only issue is the flick compared to PC. Use both sticks to move from side to side and steer, it‚Äôs not too difficult.
---
Ghost face

Bro this isn't a conversation about smash bros. Stop trying to be right so hard. Mashing ruins my stick. There's not an easier way to say it.
---
The Doctor was originally intended to be a chinese-style killer, that was a **concept** for him. Then he was decided as the African American Herman Carter that he currently is. But I don't know about the Backwater Swamp's weird American aspects.
---
I open gates if I see them 99% as Killer or Survivor. Some survivors panic thinking Blood Warden. May as well open a gate to start the EGC.
---
Then i would really think she was another survivor. Extra scary piggy. i need it.
---
When it comes to ebony moris i'm not that arsed really, mainly because, if the killer your up against is good, and hooking people early on, it makes the game short and the killer loses out on pips and bloodpoints, because the game didn't last at all. Think from an actual gameplay standpoint ebony moris are useless, obviously they're cool, but yeah.
---
It is. When coming out of their abilities at least. They get a speed boost (keep momentum in Spirit's case) thus they are faster and travel longer distances during the lunge.
---
Always
---
You're in for some fun times.  More survivor nerfs hit while you were gone.  Insta Heals are dead.  They'll never insta bring up their swf friend off the ground in your face again.  Huzzah!   Also no more Balanced Landing "infinites".  That perk just got the nerf hammer.  
---
Freddy went from I still disagree with his old ranking but F Tier to A+ Tier with his rework.  Run him no addons against red rank swf's and you can still win if you're good.  Base kit Freddy is the tits!
---
the fact that you see so many of these says you sort by new. Take my shiny orange arrow good sir
---
Personally, i find the "don't cleanse" mentality stupid. What's a survivor's greatest asset? Stealth. The plague can't hit you with her ability if she can't find you. In addition, if she's stunned, she loses corrupt purge immediately.
---
You brought up smash. You also don't need to flick your stick to wiggle. You can also just rotate for that.
---
It‚Äôs not ‚ÄúNever Cleanse.‚Äù Anyone who says to never cleanse against a plague doesn‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre talking about.
---
It is ‚ÄúKnow when to cleanse.‚Äù
---
Cleanse is a risk. Corrupt Purge is a ranged machine gun that can absolutely devastate survivors. Imagine Huntress‚Äôs Hatchets, but she throws 50 at once.
---
If you‚Äôre broken and Plague gets Corrupt Purge, you will be going down if she finds you. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you can loop or if you have windows or pallets... That chase will end in her favor.
---
So when one person cleanses, the other three suffer. Add the fact that now that one person can‚Äôt touch or interact with anything that‚Äôs infected without undoing the benefit of cleansing.
---
So it often isn‚Äôt worthwhile to cleanse. You can‚Äôt do gens together or rescue off hook, and if Plague finds you she‚Äôll just puke on you again. You give her a machine gun and gain little back in return.
---
But if you cleanse far away from where Plague is, or the gens are, then Plague has to take the time to get that Corruption. If it‚Äôs 20 seconds walking to the fountain, and 20 seconds back to where gens are being done, that‚Äôs 40 seconds of no Plague in the area. That‚Äôs enough time for 2 people to do a generator
---
If you‚Äôre able to hide for 60 seconds and avoid the Plague, the Corruption isn‚Äôt useful anyways.
---
So there‚Äôs a benefit of cleansing *smartly*. There‚Äôs ways you can use cleansing to your advantage. But you, as a team, need to know when to do it and when to work broken.
---
"NERF SURVIVORS I NEVER GET A 4K BLAH BLAH"
---
All I've been seeing recently... People just gotta get good. 
---
The "Get 5 escapes" challenge has been a huge fucking pain in my ass. My team always cucks me. Being a killer is so much easier imo. The fact people think DH or DS are OP and need nerfing is crazy... I don't understand people on this Sub.
---
He seems fairly balanced, strong if played well, but weak if you're not good with him and the survivors know how to play against him
---
Sadly have to disagree as winning before the perk has a chance to be used is nothing that should be considered a disadvantage. Even when I can see why it shouldn't be considered a "win" for NOED itself, it also shouldn't be considered a disadvantage of the perk as winning isn't a negative result. That's like saying "Devour Hope is useless because everyone tends to suicide". Yes, you couldn't use the perk in that scenario, but on the other hand you didn't even need it in the first place and ultimately won the game.
---
And yes, the old NOED was just dumb as you could do absolutely nothing about it. Especially when they decided to remove the 120 second duration and made it permanent.
---
But right now the entire concept of NOED isn't any better. Not worse and less present, which can be seen as a plus, but in the end it's almost as bad as it used to be. I still think it needs a change that puts it in a less abusive position.
---
Yup, exactly why NOED is too powerful. I just recently had a match where we were completely outplaying the killer, and I had cleansed what I thought was every dull totem. All that ended up happening was that there was one totem in the hardest spot to find that became the hex totem. It would be too hard and time consuming to find, and the killer ended up getting one or two hooks that they never could have gotten skill-wise. 
---
There is no counter. You either waste your time to cleanse full totems and make it inpossible to find the hex, or you risk that they don't have it and play normally
---
the rank one is still kinda lame but to be fair thats not nearly as easy as a 4k, and at least shows like, time investment ig? Not saying I like seeing it or think its good content, but its something to be proud of at the very least
---
Honestly, outside of SWF, you really don't have a choice. Running around injured the entire match isn't a good idea. Best to let Plague use her blood vomit to down the potatoes on your team, and hope for hatch.
---
Wtf, what did he say about Otz? :( Also "grumpy boomer" omegalul
---
I love your keyboard.
---
Victor Miller, who wrote the original Friday the 13th, sued for the rights, and also iirc said that he was paid only like 10k when the movie made 40 mil
---
Yes, but noed does not have the effect it has in the movies. Its just plain old boring noed, wich smacks the survivor after the killer looked unthreatening all game. Its not: OH SHIT! WATCH OUT! Its just: lol, baby killer got his noed. 
---
Im not saying it should be removed nor changed. Its just a boring perk for bad killers.
---
Yup. Free BP! :D
---
Killers can‚Äôt take the game hostage anymore. That‚Äôs why end game was started. If you guys three gen yourself and then spend the whole match hiding then that‚Äôs the survivors taking it hostage by not doing anything
---
you were lagging a lot, on their screen the desynch might've looked like teleporting, Ive seen it too, just sorta happens
---
I mean there are times where I 3k and give the last guy the hatch and I dont rank up.
---
you'd be right, but at the same time, im not obligated to not make it a point that you should.
---
Repost
---
You can't see all of those blendettes in there?
---
Voyeurism or cuckoldry
---
Yes. One for survivor and one for killer. Each one rewards you 25k bloodpoints when completed for the first time.
---
Ruin was always a bandaid solution to a gangrenous wound of a problem.
---
Dirty hacker, using bbq. You should be ashamed
---
I...I can't see what you're attempting to say by that.
---
But "It's fine because it works" is a quite bad reasoning. Ruin also works and is actually very important for Killers.
---
Doesn't mean that it should stay like this tho, games need to be longer by default. Ruin is not a permanent fix for the fact that gens can be done much too fast.
---
2 killed and 3 gens left.  . . . Did you just want the other two to run out and hand the game to you? Of course, they're gonna try and not get caught.
---
Did dying light give you a 33% speed buff, because if it wasn‚Äôt a glitched perk, then it was * h a c k s*
---
super easy now, did it first try
---
Or maybe she saw the gate was about to open and wanted to grab OP?
---
not sure who the original person who made these is, but im not about to dig for hours to figure out. i just uploaded the folder on dropbox so here ya go.

I wasnt lagging the clip looks laggy because xbox clips look like that
---
I think the penalty is for ppl who dc alot bc i dc‚Äôed recently bc i got the glitch where i was underneath the basement or how ever that worked and I didn‚Äôt get punished at all like no time out or anything thus i think if any of that happens you can leave the match with little to no punishment. But im not suprised that him out of everyone was the one to complain about punishing dc‚Äôs bc he likes to whine alot. (from what ive seen from videos etc)
---
&gt; but it's ultra rare and you won't see it that often. I hope.
---
&gt; 
---
You get one every other bloodweb when not on back to back bloodwebs. This add-ons is not that rare.
---
To the detriment of your team then? Cleansing against Plague hurts everyone, that's the point of this meme
---
Infectious fright &amp; Corrupt intervention are great. I only buy perks in the shrine if I know I'm not getting that killer because it's smarter to buy the perk rather than waste 9000.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm a mad man.
---
Just from reading one article, what I gather is the original screenwriter, Victor Miller, launched a legal battle to reclaim his original characters, so they had to pause game development, but decided it was better to just let the game go, as they don‚Äôt want to have to pause/restart.
---
Sorry for the misinformation. I have no idea where I heard about him dying
---
That or some kind of BDSM today
---
That's not how it works.  If you get a lobby full of potatoes that cleanse you end up having them everywhere and can collect them naturally during patrols/chases.
---
Damn, my friend did not joke when he said the game is deeper then it seems, alot of skill and things to remember if you wanna be good it seems.
---
Brother... read my comment.
---
If I am chasing you after you are unhooked it wont go down but if I leave you alone it goes away after 20 seconds. Now it's actually Anti Tunneling and not a free health state for 60 seconds.
---
Try strafing more than turning. I've found that you can even run through most indoor maps with relative ease if you get strafing down.
---
But like actually I have missed so many swings because the game decided that I should stop swinging so I look like an idiot that cant hold m1
---
firecrackers were already a pain in the ass, I suppose giving them more power would be too much, even if for a one use item.
---
I don't mind moris when they don't tunnel for the Mori xD
---
Keys are way to strong. You are doing great, good pressure nice rotations and 5 secs later 2/3.guys escape by the hatch
---
But how could you coordinate that with randomers?
---
Yep, that‚Äôs it! Maybe you were mixing it up with Wes Craven. There was no fight or anything, but the ANOES rights did just revert back to his estate after his death.
---
Commit Sudoku
---
yeah, but you get lmore of the others, so people sometimes save those for when they are angry or see a clear SWF.

yis
---
Sounds like the opposite of tru3.
---
&gt; People ARE saying they want old Legion back.
---
i never saw anybody say that whatsoever.
---
Cleansing gives Plague a ranged attack that can damage multiple Survivors at once.
---
That said, there ARE situations where you should cleanse, but it should be done strategically. Not just as soon as you get a tiny bit of sickness.
---
hey i can't be the only one that has as easier time as plague when survivors don't cleanse rather than when survivors cleanse
---
The basement was too good for this one. Sounds like he shoulda had the hatched closed on him and mori'd.
---
I noticed this as well
---
Rank 20 killer came back, been in queue for 20 minutes as of currently. My poor unleveled bing-bong daily is going to kill me.
---
It sounds good on paper but would probably suck ass to play against. Killers have it hard enough in high ranks as is, forcing them to not patrol gens in order to look for shrines will tear them apart.
---
You don't. 2 people cleanse, you're fucked anyway at that point so might as well get healthy.
---
&gt;yeah, but you get lmore of the others, so people sometimes save those for when they are angry or see a clear SWF.
---
Now you are making another argument... I just replied to your "its rare so is fine". 
---
Iri heads might not be the most broken mechanic out there but it certainly is boring getting hit by it.

Description: Was in a match against Oni went normally until he hooked me for the first time and it was almost as if I was still on his shoulder and saw the game from the Onis shoulder except my character was on the hook but I was still on his shoulder. The bottom of my screen still said that I was downed and not hooked. According to my friend who was in the match with me she couldn‚Äôt see my aura and the game didn‚Äôt register me being hooked? It was really weird eventually crows appeared and  endgame collapse did it even kill me. 
---
Steps: idk it just happened when I was hooked 
---
I have some photos not sure how to link them though
---
i mean survivors are screwed if they either cleanse or not cleanse tbh
---
Oh ok. Sorry my bad
---
Hide! Before he gets tier 3!
---
Cleanse on the opposite side of the map. Cleanse away from generators. Make her waste her time. Never use the fountains in the middle.
---
1. That‚Äôs fine. Even if she knows where everyone is, it doesn‚Äôt mean she‚Äôs able to get you down when she comes to you.
---
2. Also fine, most people prefer being able to loop over being unable to loop. 
---
3. If no one cleanses, this point is irrelevant. (Everyone would be sick, so it doesn‚Äôt matter)
---
I love the last stab like "one more for good measure"
---
upvote
---
I love the plague, but I don‚Äôt run her perks. Corrupt is a good start to a game, but if you‚Äôre already decent at finding someone fast, it‚Äôs unnecessary. Infectious is useful for large terror radius plays. Mostly I like her power with pain builds (thanatophobia, Dying light, etc).
---
Only someone **STUPID** would fall for that!
---
&gt;Playing Plague in the first place
---
Looping needs to be dealt with. It's been the meta for WAY too long. The game was meant to be hide-and-seek. Looping is a valid strategy, but it's just far too viable. It turns the game into "tag", with extra steps.
---
I think it was sarcasm.
---
I giggle to my self almost every time I see him do that lol
---
here is how it goes with plague ur damned if u do and damned if u dont but u are more damned if u do and dont
---
Unless your playing a low tier killer at high ranks.
---
Too idealistic. It‚Äôs incredibly difficult for four people to stay hidden for an entire game. If you cleanse and someone on your team gets into a chase, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult for that person to escape a corrupt purge.
---
Also, the fact that she loses corrupt purge can be countered pretty easily. She doesn‚Äôt need to swing through pallets, so it‚Äôs pretty rare for her to be stunned. It‚Äôs kinda irrelevant, really.
---
That‚Äòs why I bought Ruin off the Shrine. I hate the playstyle the Hag incentivizes. I want every Plague perk so it‚Äòd be smarter to buy her rather than the perks. Thank you!
---
So you‚Äôre that guy.
---
Why even leveling killer when not playing?
---
It's fine until you go against a Plague that actually knows what they're doing. Spreading the disease is easy (ie. you cleanse and then have to unhook/work on a gen with someone sick) and if you guys cleanse once, now you have to keep cleasing, bc any decent Plague is gonna easily snowball using Corrupt Purge vs broken survivors.
---
If I could make one addendum.
---
If you can loop, don't cleanse.  If you can't loop, LEARN.  
---
Seriously everybody that plays red/purple ranks needs to learn how to loop.  Teamates that rank up through immersion and unhooks are the absolute worst.
---
Neither should the Killer.
---
A free health state for 60 seconds is very unhealthy for the game. It reward the survivor for playing poorly. It's like NOED.
---
I really wish they had given Jeff an art skin along Jane and had him teaching her how to paint in the banner. Like an art teacher/art student collection. Would have been way too cute.
---
No, *Victor Miller* was sued by *Sean Cunningham* and Horror inc. when Victor tried to reclaim the rights to the original Friday the 13th script, because of a law that allows authors to reclaim their works after a certain period of time. Victor is just trying to claim the script he wrote; and if Sean hadn't sued him nobody probably would have noticed. Instead the new movie got scrapped and the game is dead.
---
That particular law is also why the NOES chapter is in legal limbo for DBD, as the original script and it's characters (namely Freddy Krueger) have gone to Wes Craven's estate; someone BHVR hadn't made their licensing deal with. So unless they make nice and get them to make nice with the people who made the reboot we probably won't see anything new for Freddy or Quentin.
---
lol awesome. i love the parts with the 3 columns to match the music. and the part with trapper dancing. he just loves using hex ruin so much. haha. i use hex ruin tier III for every single killer in the game except oni that i'm still working on who has tier I
---
I cleanse anytime I play plague. I feel it's boring for the killer to not have their power at least once in the match. That being said... I do wait for an opportune time and pick a fountain furthest away from active gens/team mates. My goal is to make the plague say "ugh but the fountain is all the way over *there*"
---
With the amount of tracking add-ons/perks killers get, it‚Äôs a bit unreasonable to believe that the only option survivors should have is hiding, especially against killers who counter stealth like doctor.
---
I want that now omg
---
Tru3's content is shit as of lately and he's a horrible representation of our community.
---
I don't want to watch a whiny brit have no appreciation for the game anymore. If he's having that much of a hard time with the game he should start playing For Honor again.
---
Even then, he preaches so much his viewers are practically delusional and you'll never have success having a proper, mature discussion about the game with them. 
---
Who asks for Subs to suggest builds then bitch when it's not a perfect game for him?  For real?
---
Pretty well done, but questions.
---
Killers can see all their totems: Will a destroyed/remade shrine still be visible to them?
---
2 seconds is way too fast for how long a survivor has to not only break but remake it. 10 seconds give or take is more far, considering when a killer does an animation, literally nothing stops them unless you have the luck of a locker stun if the totem is in front.
---
But overall, pretty good. Something to combat the broken one shots pretty much all killers have since they took away the healing items for it.
---
Does not, unfortunately. Just powers exits, which blocks all gens.
---
But if they play it smart than that wont happen. Instead you'll have four at the corners of the map and you have to give up a gen to get one
---
I literally just went to the dbd front page and found a post where redditors are saying they want old legion back and that he was fine for the most part. You‚Äôre either deliberately ignoring the posts on Legion, or don‚Äôt browse the subreddit often. And this post was just from today. I‚Äôve seen dozens of posts about bringing back old Legion in the last month alone.
---
Its a worse enduring isnt it
---
**4K with perkless Bubba at rank 1 with perfect score.**
---
"Never cleanse vs Plague" is pretty similar to "don't respect pallets". Are there situations where respecting a pallet can be benficial and the right option? Yes. But most situtations it isn't, so instead of wanting killers to properly understand when they should or shouldn't be respecting a pallet, it's more simple to just say "don't respect pallets.". Same thing applies for Plague - with the difference that one well use Corrupt Purge can end a match or heavily influence it - something that a few respected pallets just doesn't.
---
And this right here kids, is why I bring a mori! /s
---
i got all but the flashlight save. just a week and a half to next one
---
I just use the dash to get around the map but once I'm close to a survivor I charge up his bat and let them have it. He's not a bad killer. Probably B tier honestly but he's actually fun to play and play against.
---
On one hand I think it's great that Tru3's community can interact with him by donating to him to try out builds, but on the other hand I think for everyone's enjoyment he needs to put a limit on the builds people can provide. There are definitely people who only come to Tru3's streams cause "ha ha funny guy with funny accent is mad at games" but the vast majority of people (Tru3 included) would prefer to not see the same tired joke of "ha ha funny No Mither meme" or "ha ha funny Monstrous Shrine meme" buried into the ground.
---
Absolutely true. But I shouldnt be able to down someone hook them then you run to unhook infront if me, I grab you and get DS'd when I went after the guy who unhooked you. That's not tunneling. That's you getting a free health state for 60 seconds and making plays you would never attempt under any other scenario.
---
Get spirit, period

Who the fuck waits 40 minutes for matchmaking. Both my ques are under 5 minutes
---
I've had enough of Santa suit with his belly sticking out for a Clown, thanks xD
---
No, there's 19 more there
---
Haha go after someone else yeah because me downing someone as they run after in hooking you then downing you 30 seconds later and picking you up and still getting hit with DS is tunneling.
---
Or you being the last survivor and saving yourself with Deliverance and jumping in a locker to force a grab is tunneling.
---
The only cool thing to see if when people show all the characters on lvl.50 P3 but even that isn't really that interesting.
---
Where I said something like that? Dont invent things just to think you're right...
---
Ok but how did Yui not absolutely shit herself in fear when the Oni approached her in the trailer
---
Unrelated but yui is fucking loud
---
what's m1 mean? his power does suck unless ure just playing with it for fun. just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way. and once u bbq them all once, use his power for fun the rest of the time to get devious points. dashing gives u points and u can try demon slam practice against ppl, not caring whether u hit them or not. i often hold teh attack button the entire way and see if i luck out and hit someone. but only after bbqing everyone. not for real real. only play play.
---
how do you hit them with the bat if they run around a loop? to me it feels a lot like bubba only that you cant see shit
---
Wait thats illegal
---
No they dont.
---
You get camped because you probably play like a toxic pos.
---
it affects ALL stuns and attack recovery so no
---
lag switching bubbas. I thought they died out.

I dont think corrupt purge is even that strong

Kate had hers released last year.

No idea

Cause it didn't happened, only his descriptions have changed in patch 3.4.0

I hate ds but I disagree with this.

It's a dick move to tunnel. That's why. It's not fun for either side.
---
[Laughs in Detective's hunch]
---
Seriously, i got it from the shrine and the amout of NOEDs i have prevented is so satisfying, i'm in love with the perk right now that the archives have a challenge that needs NOED.

I always thought of CI as kind of an alternative for Ruin. I dislike Ruin because it‚Äòs inconsistent at times. Good to know it‚Äòs used differently. I wanted to get IF for Myers, Billy and Cannibal, so that checks out. As for DD I wanted to pair it with PWYF for some fun plays.

Her perks don‚Äòt seem to be that necessary for me with your explanations. I think I‚Äòll go for Oni. Thank you!

What are you supposed to do ? I had taken a big break and only played against the plague a few times . Are you only supposed to cleanse when she isnt chasing and after you cleanse hide for awhile ?
---
it was designed with competitive play in mind from the start, it was one of its main problems initially from what friends who played it back then say
---
it felt boringly fair in a competitive sense despite being utterly unbalanced
---
Thanks :)
---
Luckily it's been revealed to you
---
But its a hex
---
Not to be a dick but generally if they're cleansing they aren't doing it intelligently.  I see randos throw games against her giving her constant machine guns all the time.  They put little to no thought into where to cleanse.  My easiest games against Plague are when people man up stay sick and loop because that's something we're all supposed to know how to do at red ranks.  My easiest games playing as Plague are when they cleanse against me.  It takes little to no effort to land those corrupt downs.  Also even if they cleanse I'm just going to resick their dumb asses the moment I see them anyways assuming they don't do it to themselves by touching my gens.
---
I've been playing Oni on PS4, its kinda difficult to aim his Demon Strike at first, but it gets better once you get used to it.

One of the many times I didn't land it. But when I do, damn that shit hits.

99 percent of the time i see someone come in with a flashlight i never see them use it its so strange

That's every hex precisely why I made this perk a hex because it does a lot of things
---
That‚Äôs how I feel regardless of how thick the tree is lmao

When injured they run like monkeys. I could not be able to play the game if that was the injured run animation would be laughing too hard.
---
Looks like something made in Dreams.

This is why all hex perks are bad
---
Low population. https://steamdb.info/app/555440/graphs/

Maybe devs advertised the game far too connected to DBD (despite they always emphasizing the games were unrelated)  and mainly the DBD community gave it a try. Once 90% of DG playerbase went back to DBD, the game died. Twice.
---
I like to use the gray sleeveless shirt and the camo pants with the P3 head. Makes Jeff look like a redneck or something and it‚Äôs kind of funny

I either BM when I'm taking the aggro from the other survivors or I just body the killer with pallet stuns and jukes that I'm okay with dying.

This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!

You've brought a downvote to yourself. Not from me, but from others.
---
Ruin is run all the time so hexes are risky but powerful perks
---
Well, you just answered for me..."hides forever", basically proving my point, both things are not the same, but still means the same in other forms, so...the killer can even push forward the slugging dropping and picking the surv just to chase him again or just extending the game because he wants the 4k...
---
You should not throw a fit over anything really because this is a game and all. But..  
---
I think hooking the last survivor in the basement because he doesnt wiggle is a dick move. You either give him hatch or not but there is no reason disrespecting them for not wiggling. Of course this is coming from someone who gives hatch 9 out of 10 times if the last survivor doesn't wiggle. 
---
(and this coming from a killer main before people just assume that I am a salty survivor)
---
What? What a weird way of seeing things. Playing both sides makes me wanna play nicer as killer, because I understand how frustrating it can be to get tunneled. And I don't even wanna comment on the facecamp part... what are survivors doing that's so annoying to the point of you throwing a match just to "ensure they die and are denied points"? Teabagging you and clicking their flashlights? Yea, because that really affects your ability to play the game, differently from tunneling, survivors who get tunneled can play the game just fine.... /s.
---
Uh.. sadism.
---
Doctor definitely needs a rework more than trapper does. Trappers pretty good as he is lol.
---
I play both sides pretty equally and I‚Äôve made it to Rank 1 with both a few times for the novelty, but I am consistently a Rank 8 player. I dislike both keys and moris. I think that they condition poor habits. I will use the green mori only for a daily, but I feel like it takes out the fun for myself and everyone I am against. I feel like key items shouldn‚Äôt be something that you can bring into a game, or shouldn‚Äôt be protected by white ward or add ons. I had a match just last night that ended with a dc and key/map double escape. It wasn‚Äôt fun, super anticlimactic. I also don‚Äôt approve of the huge bloodpoint payout to hatch escapes, I got plenty of chases and 7 hooks and I barely broke 20k, but because they got hatch the pair of them were tickling 30k
---
At yellow rank killer you were supposed to be demolished by that matchmaking but you weren't at all.  I'd say you're well above the curve compared to where you are currently ranked.  Definitely don't beat yourself up too much over kill count.  Your 28k 1K game is so much more impressive to me than say a 18k  3K win would be.  Killers that play your way, lots of scoring events, no camping and tunnels end up being really good at this game.  Just keep doing what you're doing.  You'll be fine.

Trapper doesn't need an actual rework. He needs very minor changes that could be done in a micro patch. Doctor has so many issues that cant be fixed with just some small changes, hence rework.

&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;# New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

my problem is iron will is required on Jeff lol

&gt;I know they are not as rare as their name suggest, but they are rare enough to not see them that often. People don't use them every game, add to that thay you play multiple people, with multiple killers, the chances of you running into an iridescent is not that big.
---
People don't use them every game not because they are rare but because survivors often immediately leave the game against it (through suicide or DC) and on top of that, the killer will have a low bloodpoints score anyway. 
---
So as a killer, you know better than waiting for 20 minutes to find a game only bring a DC inducing add-on that will cause the match to end in 5 minutes. 
---
This is how broken the add-on is.

You  can see his  brows behind his glasses in the other cosmetics.  His brows are shaved in this one.

Thanks. :D

Yeah ik

Thanks bruh

That‚Äôs what I used xd

We better celebrate
---
Ouch. That sucks, dude. At the post game results, you can rate the match itself. I don‚Äôt know if anyone utilizes it‚Äôs, and I‚Äôm not sure what information the developers gain from it, but it‚Äôs clear you didn‚Äôt have fun with that match.
---
Unpopular opinion but I rarely cleanse, because I always play solo and in general I‚Äôve found that if priestess gets Corrupt Purge she WILL get someone down in those 60 seconds that it‚Äôs active.
---
I am usually not the one that gets downed but cleansing does not help me do my objectives faster. It provides psychological safety for me if the killer isn‚Äôt on me, but if the killer is on you, you‚Äôre better off facing a slower T3 Myers than a huntress throwing a STREAM of axes at you.
---
Because corrupt purge last 60 seconds, in a random game there‚Äôs always someone cleansing and so someone‚Äôs always going down fast. The only time it seems to work is if somehow the cleansed shrine is far away from all objectives.
---
I think SWF changes that equation considerably- hiding for 60s is much easier when you can tell the other three people where she is.
---
Exactly lmao

Yeah I changed it because someone went ape shit on me for not agreeing with NoEd or Adrenaline as perks.

Spirit is still busted, any good spirit would hear you and turn around immediately.

What I have seen it from Tru3 is that he finds things that make the Killers good and complains when they get nerfed then he moves to another off meta killer and then finds a playstyle that's good and they get nerfed.

M1 means to hit the survivor with your main attack and not your power

Yeah. I never condone DCing, ever, but in cases like that it has to be done.

Sounds like name shaming to me
---
so you are gonna tell me spread traps out around the whole map is a good idea?
---
Lots of sharpie died for this image lol 
---
Nice drawing
---
This sucks, I don‚Äôt have a pc and I was really hoping for a console port I was interested in it.
---
Detectives hunch
---
you are literally not making any points besides trying to insult me
---
That's the problem, isn't it? People who play solo queue are dying trial after trial because of an abysmal team while people who are in at least a 3-man swf squad can easily coordinate and run circles around some killers.
---
How dare the survivors do the only objective they have in this game!!! Sweaty DS and Adrenaline users!!!
---
that is why you wait a couple weeks before playing again
---
Star Wars chapter. Vader and yoda
---
You ended the game in 20 seconds. Someone deserves an upvote.
---
The whole point of the mori is to turn the ‚ÄúDown 3 times to kill‚Äù aspect of the game to ‚ÄúDown 2 times to kill.‚Äù
---
Setting Moris to 2 hooks makes the ‚ÄúDown 3 times to kill‚Äù aspect to ‚ÄúDown 3 times to kill.‚Äù
---
So literally nothing.
---
Damn that‚Äôs nuts. Must be your neighbour
---
Healing means you dont leave orbs, making me a standard m1 killer. I keep finding gens with enough orbs to fully charge my power from 0 because nobody heals
---
Basically Legion launched horribly bad and unbalanced, so that an extremely tunnel-ey and hard to counter playstyle was the meta. They did a rework that hurt the viability of Legion but made them tailored to the intended playstyle. This style had a meta to it using on hit perks to great effect due to Legion‚Äôs stabby nature. Finally they did this balance pass where they removed the on hit capabilities of frenzy, but buffed his speeds and add ons. When played properly these changes are amazing but the community is kinda stubborn.
---
It also works against hag, technically speaking.
---
* Dark Prison:
---
This should only work once during a match.
---
* Get Out: 
---
This is fine.
---
* Disruption:
---
 I'd say no to this one. Killers are already strong if you're not playing in high ranks and solo survivor already sucks.
---
* Rock Solid:
---
If it doesn't affect DS, it shouldn't affect Head On either.
---
* On the Attack:
---
I'd say it should activate when a chase ends and when it starts, the haste goes away and the perk goes on cooldown.
---
After the update in July that gave Scavengers multiple lives because SOME hunters abused the fact you could instantly kill Scavengers (Even though it really hurt your score), Hunter became too tedious because you already had 1-2 scavengers escape per game. 
---
Stealth was the prime tool of scavengers, but with the ability to die and then respawn a few times, the game devolved into managing each other as bait. The fear of the Hunter was gone. The fun of playing hunter was gone because the odds were heavily stacked against you. 
---
Eventually everyone just came back to DBD, and the game lost more players each and every day.
---
Great artwork mate. Hillbilly and Wraith kinda remind me of Invader Zim with Gir and Dib respectively

The onex and pro consoles dont suffer as bad but they still stutter. Sometimes badly.

I only cleanse if I am in full sickness. When I play the Plague, I always equip Thanatophobia to punish them for not cleansing and if they do cleanse, I get blood puke. That's a win-win situation.
---
üò±üçéüò∑
---
Hol‚Äô up...
---
I don't agree with either side being toxic to each other. It's upsetting because it's all over a video game. It's okay to get upset with the outcome of a match or how someone else played, but I usually just suck it up and keep my feelings to myself. I'd never tell someone to kill themself or say "GG EZ" or petty shit like that. I just wish there would be some balancing done that would make both survivors and killers happier.
---
Agreed. And what‚Äôs worse, is that they‚Äôre planning on punishing those who DC prematurely. There‚Äôs lots of reasons why people DC; a lot of the times it‚Äôs because people legitimately lost connection to the internet, or their game crashed, or real life happens, or when people don‚Äôt have fun.
---
I truly hope future games aren‚Äôt as crappy as the one you just did.
---
From my experience, I'd rather get chased while injured than getting chased with Plague with Corrupt Purge.
---
Dunno why everyone downvotes when someone brings this up. How can I be the one punch man if I have to wait for the last gen to pop before I can fry the obsession with Rancor when comboing it with STBFL, Dying Light, and PYWF?
---
I COULD just bring NOED + a Cypress but that's less funny considering survivors see the secret offering.
---
Shit, the accent made it better. Love me some Scots!
---
If someone posted everytime they were in that situation this message board would be flooded. It happens all the time no point in posting it.
---
IT WAS ME, I WAS THE BING BONG ALL ALONG
---
Hillbilly: Yes, yes you were
---
Also thanks dude
---
Low playerbase, though if you want to know why the playerbase was so low, there's a few speculations.
---
One thing that made Deathgarden stand out differently from DBD was that it was balanced around high level play. 
---
A good Hunter in DG could win against a team of 4 good Scavengers based on the hunter's skill. This is fine, except that it prevents any Scavenger's from being able to really enjoy the game if they aren't excellent or in a good team, or both of paired against an excellent Hunter.
---
Because of this, the skill cap for entry was pretty high, and people couldn't get into the game and enjoy it as easily as DBD where Survivors are at a much higher advantage than Scavengers were.
---
Making the game more accessible for lower skilled players keeps a higher playerbase, at the cost of causing some high level killer play to be more painful. A good killer in DBD simply cannot effectively win against a 4 man survivor group that are all very skilled. DG made it so they could, and as a result, the game died because it prevented anyone who *wasn't* at that level of play unable to join.
---
Deviousness has no effect on emblems. Its gen defense, chases won, hooks, and hits. You're better off not using your ability at all and playing as an m1 killer.
---
Check the most recent Mash Up video.
---
Nooo, that's OOB. OOC is the one that makes killers bodyblock you all game.
---
And yet a few of those seem a bit farfetched for hits. Sure, its a combination. I've been hit through windows too, but some of his videos are well beyond what I have ever seen. Which lead me to the suspicion of him having bad internet. Well. sad to hear you are dealing with that. I have a hit every once in a while that seems a big bogus but nothing like what this guy is going through.
---
The most unbelievable part about this is he has 500 hours and is just now encountering salty survivors
---
better celebrate the fact that legion has been in a horrendous state for a whole year and only becoming worse
---
I promise!
---
True, but you have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off to cut enough orbs to get power. If everyone is healthy, two m1's and a tiny little SUCC fully powers you.
---
&gt;but there is no reason disrespecting them for not wiggling
---
Hooking someone as killer in the safest spot = Disrespecting the survivor.  
---
I love this reddit.
---
Oh yeah if you do it to toxic people its ok
---
Funny how you censored your name but the guy quoted your name and you didn't care.
---
I can literally ruin someone‚Äôs experience by hooking and tunneling, which then ruins the other survivors experience because they‚Äôre down a teammate before gens were popped.
---
Both of them are horrifically unfair to players.
---
If you‚Äôre so dead set upon using the ‚ÄúI want muh two hook,‚Äù then we should only have green Moris at max, which I still disagree with for the reason stated above.
---
My favorite hobby is to let them think they are the shit when I disrespect the shit out of every pallet...and then they realize I perma-run the Enduring/Spirit Fury fuck you I identify as a self-feeding wood chipper build, and they panic because they seldom have a backup plan.
---
Not even gifs. Just the same gif. Over and over.
---
Hate to be that guy but these are 180s, good job though.
---
Why's it bad
---
Because his club has 3 types of strikes. A basic attack with no lunge whatsoever. One that charges just a little bit. And one that charges a long time.
---
There‚Äôs really no clear delineation between which one you will get.
---
My bad. Yeah I‚Äôm getting points and emblems mixed up
---
True enough. He is a brand new killer, itll take time for the strats to be figured out. I'm looking forward to the Entity Education video on him
---
There's a clip of someone getting stuck on air. Seriously this new chapter is a shitshow.
---
EVERYBODY TOXIC EXCEPT ME AND MY KIWWER FWIENDS!!!!!!
---
You don't have to save just blind while killer is holding a survivor.
---
I have yet to die to her since her changes, at rank 1 nonetheless. However I think all the Spirits shifted over to Ghostface and Hillbilly because they're more common than ever now
---
There is also net coding. Same issue with FPS games where you run around a corner and get shot and killed. Well, only time will tell to see if issues get resolved.
---
Who‚Äôs Jeff? Is he that huge guy who refuses to throw elbows at Legion even with spike armor?
---
Definitely calling bullshit on this one, there's no way you could've seen him over there without cheats
---
It's too bad that more posts can't be pinned at the top of subs. This sub would benefit from a daily thread where people could post their achievements, random questions, etc. The once a week Smile Sunday or No Stupid Questions are nice, but don't help for the rest of the week.
---
Read Jeff‚Äôs lore, he wouldn‚Äôt hurt a fly
---
Being able to talk feels powerful it seems.
---
Noed, devour hope, myc, rancor, haunted grounds, ghostface, myers, clown‚Äôs pinky fingers
---
Wait portals detect survivors even when in lockers?
---
Safest? If they're the last survivor, they can't kobe. It doesn't matter where they're hooked. I don't agree with the entitled survivor who expects hatch if they don't wiggle, but I also don't agree with the killer basement-ing them. It does kind of sound like a subtle way to BM. Any hook would do.
---
Not sure why people are down voting others for making this observation. Some of this screams lag. Like seeing a survivor run in a direction and then disappear.
---
Yeah, it's always neat playing around to see what works best against a killer. Like normally with an m1 killer, at full health you take a hit, and have a second health state effectively with something like Dead Hard, but if Oni is more than halfway charged, and smacks you with that first hit, he becomes super strong. It's never been so vital to avoid first hit with a killer and it makes for neat gameplay. Instead of taking a hit to get a few more runs of a structure, it could be safer to drop the pallet early to deny power at all. That big ol bat is mighty strong.
---
NA &lt; EU holds true in other PvP or competitive games so it wouldn't be a stretch to expect the same for dbd.
---
"Where'd they go?" will be impossible for me as I'm only a solo survivor
---
‚Äúno probums, boss, if you hack every hook, duh‚Äù
---
Whispers isn't OP. At higher ranks the bigger problem is being looped by survivors and not finding them.
---
If you think Whispers is OP wait till you see The Doctor.
---
Are you sure? Spirit is exatcly the same as she used to be besides the collision removal, no way any red rank spirit would actually be affected by that.
---
How does anything about the question you just put forth relate in any way to the absurd claim of yours that Trappers have to camp?  Wildly unrelated man.  Even if you put your traps in a specific portion of the map that still doesn't have anything to do with your original claim.  If you trashcamp to get kills do it but own it.  Don't pretend it's because your killer selection requires it.  There isn't a killer in the game you HAVE to camp with.
---
is it that good? i never tried it
---
No i think its perfectly fine imo the ability to hear whispers when within 32 meters of a survivor can be a blessing or a curse like u hear the whispers standing with a hooked survivor or downed survivor
---
We are talking about the last survivor. The safest spot is the nearest hook.
---
I think bhvr have to nerf other op things like legion before adressing this issue
---
People on this sub possess actual talent and they spend it on dbd. I love that a game that we complain about still gets love because we only complain about it because we know it's good. 
---
(Also it looks fucking awesome!)
---
Some people can I think. Some gfs run distance addons so you have to be right next to him to reveal him.
---
30 seconds to 3 minutes
---
You would be surprised. The collision removal and changing of the Prayer Beads have made her far less threatening. Because now you have a much better idea of when she's phasing, can actually juke her at windows now, and she can't get free hits from collision when you try to juke her during her phase. She also has less map pressure since they toned down those add-ons too
---
You mighty want to change focus, since it‚Äôs only useful against this killer. If you run it against a legion or other killer, it‚Äôs a waste of a perk
---
T1 Myers has almost no lunge, if any
---
Thanks that means a lot honestly because I‚Äôve been lacking inspiration and confidence lately. Again thank you
---
&gt;It does kind of sound like a subtle way to BM
---
How is it BM?  
---
You're not holding the game hostage.  
---
You're just putting him in the basement.  
---
Maybe he's doing his archive-quest-rift-thing.  
---
Maybe the second-last just died so the instant-hook-death without kobe chance won't trigger yet.  
---
There could be reasons for doing it.  
---
Calling it "Disrespect" or "BM" is just nonsense.
---
&gt;Can't seem to find anything in the store
---
Only selected characters have blight cosmetics available. When checking said cosmetics, you will notice they can be paid with Auric Cells or Putrid Serum.
---
And what rank is it that survivors actually let you get a hit? Because against red ranks it‚Äôs incredibly difficult if they go around objects or just turn
---
Ehhh
---
At least Joji isn't a Nazi.
---
It‚Äôs bc i mostly play survivor and I just started to play more killer
---
Even if you get an Adept or a perfect 32k 4k, does anyone really care? It almost seems like bragging. I'm actually a fan of posts of people getting to red ranks for the first time. Or getting to red ranks playing mediocre killer because they're proud of themselves and it's nice to congratulate them.
---
I understand getting Adept Killer is harder than Adept survivor, but nobody ever posts them getting 32k survivor games (which is arguably harder than a 32 killer game).
---

alma in DBD? spirit would finally not be the most adorable killer anymore
---
I love that people are down voting this.
---
They need to increase the degrees on his attack just a little bit and revert the change where he power like gets 99-ed then you have you find some random orb somewhere to complete it. I have no idea why they put that in. Honestly a much bigger nerf than you would think. Especially since they decreased the number of orbs that get dropped
---
I appreciate your response. I wish they published something though because you say scavenger was top hard to play and the comment above you says it was because hunters were made too weak. It sucks we have to speculate but thanks for the info!
---
trapper? you mean legion right?
---
Yup, but of course the fanboys don't wanna hear it and instead do mental gymnastics on how unique each killer is.
---
who wouldnt wanna stalk that? ;)
---
Even then the hit registry is so bad that I, much too frequently, have my club go through survivors who are just sitting there not even trying to evade it
---
Ok thanks
---
nerf means weaker
---
There are event outfits for at least Dwight, Jake, Claudette, Trapper, Hillbilly, Wraith, Clown, Huntress, Spirit and Plague
---
*racist
---
I do not really understand what you typed. But I'm going to assume you are saying you think I'm not passed rank 10 because of the build I am currently running. I'm sitting at rank 1 at the moment.
---
Thanks for the info! It sucks they didnt release an official statement. You say its because hunter was too weak and one comment below says its because the game balance around high level play and scavengers were too weak. It sucks we have to speculate but thank you for sharing your take with me.
---
Still, I adore the pig head for whatever reason. I never cared for it much in the film but in-game it feels so unique, not sure why. The hair and the ears and the fact she's so tiny.
---
Also Can‚Äôt catch me and otherworldly touch are both op. Can‚Äôt catch me is sprint burst( Already a perk) and Touch forces people to heal up before working on another gen, make the effect like blindness or oblivious
---
They should make a forfeit option like on identity V
---
It‚Äôs great. Especially on killers who need a quick start. And it makes it much harder for the last survivor to get the gate.
---
you look at those patch notes and tell me it isn't overall weaker.
---
saaaame, it feels incredible to pull this off, especially when you're a killer main and manage to dodge a hit like this
---
My Pig is at lvl 45.. maybe i can try that later :) but i mean on mobile.. forget to write in the post :/

---
I haven't played killer since reset.
---
Oh god, don't.
---
Sometimes it makes me cry how fucked the RNG can be. You put a trap on and before you look, it's already gone. That's why I feel she should be given at least six in her base kit.
---
I understand that could be unbalanced but I think, particularly with the endgame nerf, she really deserves it considering how RNG it can be.
---
I try to have funny moments with killers all the time, but sometimes they take themselves too seriously.
---
When I play Killer, if a survivor does something funny, I don‚Äôt just kill them or attack them. Or be rude to them like this guy. But what do I know, I‚Äôm called ugly all the time üòÖ
---
They did weaken the hunters a bit towards the end after the reboot. After the reboot, if a hunter downed a scavenger, they could instantly kill them out of the game. The very first time they were downed. It was one of the things that made it very difficult for new player scavenger's to be able to enjoy the game at all, it was like having an ebony mori that works on first down and requires no hooks.
---
They changed it so that couldn't be done immediately, which made it so newer scavs could enjoy the game a bit more, but then Hunter's suffered against really good teams. It's one of those things where like, you can't really properly balance an asymmetrical game for all players.
---
&gt; It's usually people being altruistic and going for saves that turns a 1K into a 3K. 
---
This is how a lot of survivors fuck up. I put someone on basement hook as mikey yesterday after I just hit T3. I left to go kick a gen and didn't have any other information, so I start back to see if someone is going for an unsafe rescue. Hey lookit dem scratchies! Two people went for a dumb save, turning one hook that I wasn't invested in into three hooks and a 4K game.
---
r/dbdgonewild material here
---
Good job! There are some bits that are hard to hear with the distortion, but your pacing is excellent.
---
Best grandpa ever.
---
It's not that black and white. Teammates mean a lot when it comes to your success in this game. I played through purple ranks a couple weeks ago, and I was escaping about 20% of the time. If I was playing 5 games a day, that was one escape per day. I made it to red, and now I'm escaping 2/3rds of the time. It's so much easier when your team doesn't care about ruin, or will work on a gen 15 feet from the killer. You can find those people at lower ranks, but they are much fewer in number.
---
I‚Äôm not really complaining, because kindred was never really used often enough in games for me that undetectable makes a difference. Not sure why I was downvoted. Ghostface can definitely camp effectively fwiw, he just has to hide a little. He even gets rewarded for it cause he can just exposes whoever comes for the save. And I‚Äôm definitely not in potato ranks.
---
Now with an ugly sweater!
---
lmao
---
Is this a shitpost? 2 hatchets in exchange for moderately increased wind up?
---
**lmfao**
---
I'm not familiar with this glitch, honestly. I see it a lot on Billy's chainsaw and grabs, but not with lunges.
---
Even worse is when the game auto-locks you on some random part of a building/pallet.
---
I‚Äôm just scrolling for memes to send to a dbd group chat I‚Äôm in (all dudes, except me) and I‚Äôm highly debating sending this one as well xD
---
Yes, she is a top tier killer but the most difficult to play as.
---
Yeah I didn't know that either, the first time I went into the basement I couldn't find them and when I did a 2nd check I saw the markers in the lockers. I think it's basically the same as legion's detection after he hits someone with his power.
---
You waste a perk slot where a better one could be used and the  just bring in a Medkit to heal yourself which is faster.
---
How long has it been since that outfit won the competition? I'm convinced that outfit isn't coming at this point.
---

Legion is so OP.
---
From what I can tell, he has a similar thing to legion where you NEED to be split up. Infectious Fright can get half your team killed in less than 30 seconds
---
If you cant beat em join em
---
One time I was playing against Plague while using No Mither, and some sweet new soul was trying to show me how to cleanse. He kept gesturing to follow and then pointed at the fountain.

So he's faster at being useless.

Oh yea, an oldschool ebony mori as base kit sounds absolutely insane

---
I tried watching over half of Hush and I wasn't a fan.
---
Actually im a rank 9 killer and i kept getting games with rank 5 and red ranks
---
Mad grits prevents you from wiggling for like 2-3 seconds when someone gets hit. If he didn‚Äôt have mad grit that Feng would‚Äôve gotten out
---
I love this art style
---
As a survivor main who solo queues a lot, 9/10 times, there is always this guy
---
Contagious laughter right there.
---
Yes. But that‚Äôs 5 times per game max. Kindred is for every hook, and for the entire duration of the hook, instead of just a few seconds.
---
Remember, if you try to survive, you're just being toxic and can't complain
---
When you play solo survivor,you have to actually play like it, the only person who for you it matters if gets out is yourself. Take it from someone who has been rank1 every month since game release. you have to know how to operate on your own and dont have reliance on anyone but yourself. Like I was able to obtain a 80% escape rate over 50 games when i did the 0perk/0item challenge from rank reset back to rank 1 in July. Its not that hard if you are actually willing to improve yourself over blaming teammates. Currently 7k hours clocked
---
Only like 10% of my matches as killer would have good survivors. I guess also kill don‚Äôt really matter to me as long as I got a good amount of bloodpoints I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
Head By Daylight
---
There‚Äôs nothing that says he wouldn‚Äôt and it actually mentions him getting involved in a fight previously... Someone trying to kill you and others is a little different than a supposedly innocent fly anyways... Obviously him and David and others‚Äô lack of fight is part of the game it just seems like it might lead to an interesting team-up mechanic...
---
U know increasing hatchet wind up time is making it longer??
---
Max level Mad Grit causes successful hits while carrying a survivor to pause the wiggle timer for 4 seconds, making it impossible for the survivor to wiggle for 2 seconds after the killer is able to attack again. The entire team was throwing themselves at the hook to prevent the hook, hoping they‚Äôd wiggle off, but Mad Grit allowed OP to capitalize on this and essentially make it impossible for the survivor to wiggle off in that scenario. So no, Mad Grit was literally the reason that the killer was able to turn that situation into a win lol.
---
Edit: clarity and redundancy.
---
If he was trying to do his basement challenge, he should've said so in the post.
---
Oh look, the Fun Bus!
---
Jeff and Adam get one cosmetic outfit per year.
---
How?
---
no answer it bc to me you can just throw out all the kinds of camping bc nobody can really decided on how far away is considered camping but there is a thing ive learned trapper is pretty forced to camp one side of the map trap it and have gens nearby and the dumbest move would be going away from ur traps and having them too far away where u cant maintain them
---
This is excellent both fictionally and historically. 
---
I look forward to what you dig up for the next featured killer üëç
---
(Also how did you embed multiple images within the text body?)
---
Dude its simple. Hooking someone as killer should never be seen as "BM" or "Disrespectful".
---
You assuming he's doing his basement challenge is "nonsense". If me saying the survivor feeling like the killer did it to BM was nonsense. Clearly nothing constructive was said by either side in that end game chat.
---
As survivor this game is meaningless because you can‚Äôt play without ds for tunneling Killers and BT for camping killers
---
If he wasn't doing the basement challenge, there was no point of him bringing them to the basement if it wasn't the closest hook.
---
I play Hillbilly, Hag, and Freddy without Ruin all the time in red ranks and I still play the "not as good" killers in red ranks from time to time and still have fun with them.
---
But on mobile you dont have to hear cus you can see the icone appear as the survivor get closer to you
---
While I can't speak for everyone. I can agree with this. Looping has been the main thing for survivors for so long. After a while of looping and learning how to do it, there's not much else to do. Sure there's other stuff you can do like sabo, totems, and chest searching. But that's not really helping in distracting the killer. Looping has been the main source for distracting and wasting a killer time. But after a while it just gets boring and monotonous. I would love something different to do than just loop.
---
Nice bait
---
Sounds like someone's mad they don't know how to loop lmfao. Some wise words from a man of legend... git gud, stop crying about one of the only defenses survivors have. and that's coming from a Pig main.
---
I wonder why?....
---
Maybe because it's true?
---
**and addonless**
---
Too easy to avoid as killer. You used to be able to cheese it by having the killer hit you while carrying somebody for an easy blind but it doesn't work anymore.
---
If they had range increasing add-ons or something they might be better, but at high ranks they're pretty trash.
---
don‚Äôt say iron maiden say noed user /s
---
I spend a fair bit of time on this subreddit and I never notice anyone complaining about doing gens. Killers always complain that doing gens is easy and is nothing other than m1 simulator but survivors don‚Äôt complain about the issue. I just think those killers complain too much and want free victories and that idiocy like that bothers me. 
---
Also about the first statement you quoted, I didnt put it up. It was an idea that came to me when i read your first comment. I have yet to add that variable in the game.
---
Why so many changes? To balance the game with out breaking mechanics that require more than just holding m1 or pressing m1. If we change too much on killers‚Äô side other than say bloodlust speed, the game will be different per round. But if we change something minuscule like holding m1 for doing gens, nothing drastically changes other than the time needed to complete them.  Doing gens isnt a problem and definitely does not need much skill (other than working thru gens during ruin). The reason I said &gt; Rank 7 is bc people are somewhat apt by then to do gens and loop kind of well. So they wont have issues doing gens. I play more survivor than killer now. I know too.
---
About the last thing you quoted me on, I meant changing the dynamics of the gen repair system as a whole if the other ideas fail instead of making it m1 simulator. If say survivors need to do a totem to unlock a gen or do a quick puzzle thing to unlock a gen that might take up time, gens will not go out as fast and it will add a new game mechanic. Then accordingly we can take away a gen instead of 5 gens to 4 bc the other objective might take just as long if not a little longer or something.
---
As much as that sucks, this is a post complaining about people bringing their new to the game, grey rank friends into red and purple rank matches. I understand the matchmaking is bad. When I hit rank 8, I was facing red rank SWFs every game. Just think of it as a way to get better at the game.
---
depends on your time zone and system you play on for me around this current time for PC is where I find killer games pretty fast

Mori I'm pretty okay with. The killer still has to put in some work (at least one hook for each survivor for every offer except the one and even then they still have to first down the surv somehow) and as long as survivors pay attention to the offerings they can pretty much guess if there is one and play however safely they want with that knowledge. Plus, I like the animations. 
---
Keys... the only change I'd like to see is maybe only having one survivor be able to escape at that time if a surv opens the hatch with the key? Like a temporary user only escape hatch. Anyone else has to wait until it opens on it's own or find their own key.
---
Dude I don't understand why you got downvoted so much... you're right. There's some salty, salty ass people playing this game.
---
I‚Äôm not defending facecamping, Im saying theres little to no reason for it so it is clearly more toxic than tunneling. I‚Äôm trying to say that even tho tunneling can be toxic, people overreact to it.
---
I'm on Console and Pacific time
---
Also, it aint even really max 3 when you think about it. The last one you stab you will also probably down and hook so technically speaking it¬¥s only 2 people.
---
He literally just mentioned he wanted some nerfs to survivor perks and survivors on certain aspects in one of his latests videos
---
Because "it's supposed to be a struggle" but I completely agree it's an obnoxious, outdated mechanic that adds nothing to the game. If the devs removed having to mash space, nobody would miss it.
---
This is why people have ears
---
I can't find the post but I had this idea of a killer i call the Sabatager.
---
Basically what he does is he stalks survivors and can Sabatage or copy their perks amd items.
---
He also has a passive power where at a distance he is disguised as a survivor and his TR is very small so he's hard to detect
---
If you get a lobby full of potatoes, make them cleanse on every fountain and then re-break them. Then they're fucked
---
For some reason I thought you only got points for opening one gate and the second didn't give anymore points
---
I'd rather not get chased at all. And by the way, aside from dealing damage, corrupt purge is bound by the same rules as vile purge.
---
Ffs.
---
Entitled survivor main. Nothing new...
---
give this treat to ur doggo :D        üçñ
---
You can make him look pretty white trashy that way lol.
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
Spectating Jane after we got mori'd by a 5-stack Devour Hope Hag...except it looks like Jane was into it more by herself
---
[Bonus shot of her guts just flying up in the air](https://i.imgur.com/XgYBRdM.jpg)
---
Simple solution, then. Don't get into a chase.
---
But...it only takes 4 minutes to bleed out in the dying state.
---
This is possibly the best explanation of how to properly cleanse I've seen since Plague got released. Kudos!
---
They won‚Äôt compensate you but they would probably ban the killer/survivor for holding you hostage if you report it or look into to the bug that caused you to dc
---
First, someone with under 700 hours (me), will never compare to someone with 7000 hours. I simply don't have the kind of time to put in to gaming.
---
Second, it's probably difficult for you to relate to some of the challenges that someone with much less experience has. The fact that you're listing off your accomplishments like it should make me want to listen to you more is a little strange.
---
Third, something that is easy for one person can be difficult for another. Everyone has their strengths and their weaknesses. Everyone excels and something and struggles with something else. Just because you find something easy doesn't mean that it is, nor does it mean that you're good at it.
---
Maybe it's time to step back and be a little more understanding of other people?
---
I think it's not possible for them to determine if people are intentionally DCing without dedicated survivors being available on Xbox and PS4. We need dedicated servers.
---
Killer too hard to learn, must mean he sucks.
---
well ur gonna have to find around what time the ques are faster but in short no u can not speed it up
---
o shit, what if we add them up
---
I was saying the survivor mentality of "Gens need to get done over anything else" is what makes a lot of killers run NoEd to punish the gen rush - and is exactly why it's so effective on survivors with that mentality causing them to gripe on reddit.  
---
I don't disagree that games need to be longer by default - as it stands ruin is mandatory.
---
Probably because of dodging which is understandable but from a player's perspective, nowhere near as annoying as playing with brand new players because of messed up matchmaking.
---
Hell, even if they showed us every other player perk loadout it wouldn't be game breaking. Info is always good. All of this is available through SWF already.
---
Was the ping bad in the lobby?
---
Hey! I was planning to post my rank 1! xD
---
Most people use it to find totems
---
Jesus, Fear would be a really obscure choice lol.
---
At least the person is in the match, potentially occupying the Killer's time, rather than being an instant free kill.
---
Dedicated servers are good that you never have to worry about ping, but then this shit happens that makes it so painful to play on
---
Brb crying
---
I‚Äôm often glad you can‚Äôt speak to each other on the switch.
---
Happens with dead hard and franklins demise too, it‚Äôs just not optimized
---
No joke, when I first started playing I thought the Exposed condition meant the killer knew where I was.
---
Once this guy posted his 4k and he was rank 20 the highest ranked player he got was like rank 16
---
Nah, I was thicc queen Jane
---
I've legit made so many friends by doing that haha
---
Thanks, I just started using it today üòÇ
---
RIGHT?!
---
Thank you for the support, I will remain hopeful that they will admit their feelings one day!
---
Honestly the game has so many unexplained things/steep learning curve I might as well just write a book of questions lol
---
It doesn‚Äôt bother me. People are allowed to be happy for their victories, regardless of how ‚Äúirritating‚Äù you think it is or how common it may be for you.
---
&gt;At least the person is in the match, potentially occupying the Killer's time, rather than being an instant free kill.
---
That person will probably do nothing while siting in a locker with 3 crows notifying the killer. How will this waste the killer's time?
---
As a survivor I rather just play an 1v3 over having a dead weight who will also prevent hatch from opening when the requirements are met.
---
I quit this game for a while, the saw DLC came out a month after I stopped playing. Can someone explain this to me?
---
It doesn't work on PC and I have no experience with Xbox
---
I've had a few games like this too, one time I was against the spirit and she slugged me for the 4K but the dwight I was playing with had a key and we both got out hahah!
---
And Freddy. Useful for slamming down every dream pallet it pings.
---
No hug needed. You are just an idiot. Single track mind.
---
Yes but it‚Äôs far less frustrating. Finding a trapper trap is better than a hag one. She can just reset it when she wants instantly
---
*wrathful oni noises*
---
You‚Äôre conflating skipping the majority of a game with winning a game. If you can‚Äôt win by 3 hooking then clearly you‚Äôre an unskilled killer. 
---
You‚Äôre skipping competition by skipping hooks.
---
If you don‚Äôt like the competition of chases the. Maybe *you* shouldn‚Äôt play competitive games..?
---
Unless we want it to pull a Legion and instantly start a mend timer with less time.
---
Ok boomer
---
I like it for blood points as well but people constantly complain about these perks as if they are noed level unfair but they arent.

I tried posting mine, but it got removed. Here is Jane Patrick though!

---
Yo why spirit looking like thicc jane in this art style?
---
But don‚Äôt all strikes still have insta down??
---
You're the one that's crying about looping. I'm a killer main and I don't feel the need to whine about it. It's a tactic. I bet you camp and tunnel and say it's "because you looped me". There's a reason you're being downvoted big boy, it's cause you sound stupid :)
---
Because more than one lovely lady can/may be Thicc, my good sir lol
---
Same- but i know that the servers can suck my oni console main ass
---
Bruh moments
---
That‚Äôs very true. I couldn‚Äôt come up with an idea so I thought I‚Äôll just put some random stuff in there. What do you think about the other perks or maybe the general idea?
---
It literally couldn‚Äôt be that much farther from rank reset. I mean the new one is in less than a week lmao
---
there is a killer that basically vomits on people.
---
She is very tall and easy to see and slow, so all she can really do is puke on you. If she does so enough, you will be injured and unable to heal and spread the infection, however it will never down you.
---
The only way to get rid of the infection is to cleanse in a spring.
---
the killer can use said spring you used to get a ranged attack that's far more threatening than the killer usually is.
---
Basically unless it's the endgame and the killer won't have time to get to the spring, cleansing screws over your entire team, giving the killer a machinegun.
---
Few minutes, I'm debating whether or not to make a video of comparisons of all wait times from 2016 till now. Even when the player base was the lowest in 2017 the survivor wait times were much less than a minute to get a lobby and fill it. Even killer took about or less than one minute in 2017.
---
Trapper really just needs to start with his traps. No excuse for having him take so damn long to use his power while gens are going off around him.
---
I typically play cautious during the start of the game, but the longer the game goes on, or the less survivors that remain, the more aggressive I get.
---
Please fix the Huntress hum audio. Its very echo-ey. Add to the fact that there's also a bug with endless "survivor carry" music...I cant play her at all.
---
I watched a few tutorials on YouTube and they‚Äôve all said something like 2.1 seconds into the animation. Also try practicing in a custom game with friends. I‚Äôve only ever gotten one flashlight save and let me tell you, that was probably the greatest moment in my entire DBD career lol. Just keep practicing and you‚Äôll get it
---
Why is giving last survivor a hatch a thing, but sacrificing one survivor when all 4 can escape is not?
---
Fewer
---
Jane got an artist cosmetic and isnt even a real artist according to her lore. Jeff deserves one
---
WHAT SORCERRY! inpossible. An entitled prick Will always be entitled how did you. WITCHCRAFT!
---
I don't recall him ever saying that. As far as I know, it's a few people taking things out of context and twisting them.
---
Fun? Not specifically, no.
---
Unbalanced or needing to be nerfed into oblivion? No, as well.
---
I‚Äôm not so weak or whiny as to think the killer killing me is somehow toxic or unreasonable. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs called a versus game.
---
If you find that you have no fun when you lose and can‚Äôt handle that, then you shouldn‚Äôt be playing versus games. Simple as that.
---
But that‚Äôs a **YOU** thing. No one else has to change just because you‚Äôre incapable of losing without throwing a tantrum.
---
Yes it would considering skill in EU or whatever is determined by tournament standings and there are none of those.
---
Im sorry im bias against Charmander,
---
name or not that was slightly rude of them, idunno aint got the context but still

Do it directly after rank reset. I had a lot of trouble but i got all but hag's the day after rank reset. I got all of them in 1 day

Lmao I was that hag, you guys worked really hard to cleanse the TotH, unlucky lol. Cya in the fog!
---
*BLAGH!*
---
But then like you said, "I dont have such time to put into gaming" You can say its difficult because you are inexperienced or bad. Which comes back to my original comment, if you dont have the time or are not willing to put the time into it then you are gonna be shit ,and thats completly fine. But then dont go and say that its difficult because of bad teams or other excuses. 
---
Especially this game where you can carry yourself fairly easy if you play for yourself in a solo surv mindset. Its not a good look to instantly point fingers at others to why you dont succeed.
---
#Hag is unstoppable at rank 15
---
I get it, you connected with a different starter pok√©mon...I SEE HOW IT IS
---
A killer can only see their hex totems, not dull totems.
---
I will certainly expecting a whole lot of teabagging and I'm thoroughly impressed that you all just left
---
Similar situation as the trapper; was perpetually ‚Äústepping‚Äù into my own trap for about two minutes. Real fun stuff
---
Any buff would make me happy. IDK what would make him fair better against SWF other than darker traps, but anything would be good in my book.
---
david's thirst traps
---
They're related,  S W E E T  H O M E  A L A B A M A

You should find it fun though, shouldn't you? You're sitting here trying to defend it, so obviously you should enjoy it.
---
Trapper doesn't need a rework
---
I think he is perfect as he is right now
---
(trapper main btw)
---
But it doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. I think it looks like an interesting addition to DBD and Behavior already got a partnership with Warner Bros. Don‚Äôt you like the idea of the DLC?
---
who cares, jontron and Jon Jafari are two different entities
---
Build idea: do not spend bloodpoints on him.
---
What is the 'proper way?' Strategy, build,  etc.
---
Salty messages are entertaining
---
Monitor and abuse to give them a bit less time to split up (you want them to be close together) enduring bc the cooldown is long and if you want to get out of frenzy much quicker you can sometimes get a survivor to stun you. Can combo with spirit fury if that's your thing. I liked the third seal on them but I don't actually know if that only activates with basic attacks, if so it won't work anymore.
---
We'll start a petition
---
In what way is she broken? She‚Äôs definitely not a top tier killer and a good team can win against her
---
I thought you meant while in second hook phase.
---
There's nothing that can really be done abput these people, beyond reporting them.
---
I love that build but I've replaced it for 
---
Ruin / Sloppy / Thanat / Dying light
---
I call it the "fuck your gens" build
---
I switched it to RT on Xbox because it is more comfortable plus my RB has broken on a couple controllers. Using items is RB now.
---
oh I didn't know that
---
you say that yet I can bring about 100 different comments ive gotten that even something like getting looped around a hooked person is camping or not choosing to follow someone to a part of the map I know has a good amount of windows and pallets is still camping that is why I said you can just throw out camping as a whole bc nobody can agree on what is actually camping
---
&gt;Even then, I don't know the truth of this. Has this legit happened to... anyone? Ever?
---
Yes, lots of people. 
---
Some people know because it happened to a friend, others know because someone had the courage to post here only to be immediately attacked by the community (reason why we don't see many posts).
---
The whole "devs don't ban anyone" is just an ignorant myth.
---
Decisive Strike: At the beginning of a trial, your first 1/2/3 basic attacks deal two health states of damage. Survivors hit while Decisive Strike is active become the new obsession.

I'd assume that unkillable would not protect you from Myers's Tombstone, since it technically doesn't put you into the dying state.

And you're wrong.

Dude, he straight up said that black people cause a majority of crime, and then brought up the Bell Curve (a widely disproven social darwinist book).

He's a bad dude.

How do you holding game hostage as a killer?
---
I hate that I can barely see shit BC of the puke

Can‚Äôt relate
---
Actually i would care if someone posted a 4k with no perks and no addons doctor against a 4 man rank 1 swf with meta perks and items.
---
That carried guy was probably just screaming ‚ÄúYOU BETTER STOP! STOP!‚Äù
---
Practice. That's it. Maybe increase sensitivity.
---
&gt;There's nothing that can really be done abput these people, beyond reporting them.
---
Why would you report someone for not wanting to play a match for whatever arbitrary reason that person has... Like, what is the goal here? Do you want the person to pretend to play against you to dodge a ban? There are multiple ways to **not play a game**. You can just sit on a generator and wait for the killer to grab you. 
---
I am honestly curious, how would you force someone to play when they simply don't want to?
---
Thanatophobia, blood echo, discordance and corrupt intervention.
---
Aight imma tunnel
---
You‚Äôd rather take the DS and not apply any pressure to the survivors ultimately ruining the match. You seem to hate DS so why care?
---
Killer has to deal with way more at one time than survivor. They have to worry about the whole map while survivor thinks about gens, teammates, and escape routes/loops. They both take skill, but killer is not easy against competent survivors, you find this out when you get to red ranks
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/
---
Lol.
---
*oof Shape noises*
---
Just because Moris have been in the game since the start doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs nothing wrong with them. I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to reddit and just see a single post and change it, that‚Äôs just not how it works. However, as much pressure as this community puts on them when it comes to issues they think are important, they listen. So this could just be a part of pressure.
---
Are you done? Because clearly you‚Äôre the type of person to just chill next to a hook and wait for the save so you can mori some random person for giggles.
---
Yeh i only play on ps4 and can indeed confirm sony its strict with message reports, just for petty revenge for people getting salty and messaging me nothing but insults ill report them and get them banned for a couple days lol
---
Seems like someone is salty.
---
It's a matter of how good the plague user is. I use plague too but I find her hard to use whenever they cleanse far away from a gen. But then I had a game against an apple plague who killed us with 5 gens remaining. I got hooked, everyone wants to save me. Game done.
---
u know it is perfect bc Vaggie pushes Alastor away and Charlie has fun bc we know Killers love a throwing survivor
---
What are the pin buffs?
---
It would most likely be a status effect on the HUD. The status effect would be called "Blessed", the icon would be a cross, along with the name of the survivor being blessed. So if Dwight was blessed, the full status effect would be "Blessed: Dwight Fairfield". The blessed totem would look the same as a hex totem, except that the light from it is blue.
---
Like hex perks, however, the killer wouldn't know that there's a bless perk in play (nor what the perk is) until the effect occurs. So if Unkillable is in play for Dwight, the killer won't know that it's in play until he hits Dwight with a basic attack while he's exposed.
---
They usually kill themselves on hook or just dc when u get em.
---
batteries dont work either.
---
Blood echo, discordance, ruin, barbecue and chili.
---
When you put white text on a white background.
---
Cause I want to rank up. Slugging everyone leads to no chases and you cant pip if you dont chase.
---
I like to run no ed on plague to punish people who cleanse even more
---
Name one way.
---
When you're sick, you
---
1) are injured
---
2) cough violently
---
3) get other people sick
---
4) can't be healed
---
When the plague is corrupted, you can just kinda chill out. 
---
I've never gotten all the hate on cleansing. You don't even have to be that smart about it. And I've never really bought that the plague is somehow bad because she's easy to counter by not cleansing. It seems like a huge disadvantage to give yourself. 
---
Makes more sense to cleanse far away, make her walk all the way there, and make her waste 30 seconds going to something important.
---
*Angry Bubba Noises*
---
Cant catch me is just a buff on sprint burst
---
My sensitivity is all the way up dude. Lol
---
He was in my game with no mither. Healed me to 90% than ran away to open the gates. I never get last 10% and he was only one survivor escaped, abandoning his whole team
---
Did you just unironically link Behavior's garbage stats? Lol
---
God I hate seeing this "race realist" crank job get posted as a meme.
---
I slug DS users on the regular and I‚Äôm rank 5
---
That won't work as easily anymore 'cause now I only go back to purple rather than the easy green ranks. But that's not really my point anyways, it's just poorly designed and conceptualized.
---
Seems more like you‚Äôre an idiot that doesn‚Äôt understand people can defend something they may not fully agree with.
---
But this whole thread is full of fools and idiots. Having one more with you around won‚Äôt change much.
---
So continue not actually talking about the topic at hand. Continue focusing just on me instead of what we‚Äôre discussing. You‚Äôre not adding anything and you‚Äôre not changing anyone‚Äôs opinion.
---
You‚Äôre just making yourself look more and more like an idiot.
---
Im sorry,is that some sort of low rank juke im too good to understand?
---
O u t p l a y e d
---
Yeah I‚Äôm kinda starting to find that out. He‚Äôs fun but idk how much fun he‚Äôs going to be on console now that I‚Äôm at red ranks and people actually dodge my attacks now.
---
Ussylis is NOT irrelevant.  
---
Hes a salty survivor main. He always has his friends play along side him, gen rush while he 'runs the killer around'. 
---
I take what he says with a grain of salt. 
---
Survivors DCing is an ISSUE. It ruins the game for everyone. Its a GAME. Play it out, even if you lose. 
---
No shit, People can still give up on hook. But its better than DCing. At least the killer gets points, wastes a BIT of their time, and maybe it will lead to better habits.
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs constantly 4k-ing my matches, can‚Äôt anyone stop him?
---
Which is also why Freddy is missing from the Switch Port of the game. They had issues with Leatherface but those seem resolved as he was added to the Switch last week. Which is also good news overall for the game and character because now there's a possibility to add new skins to big boy Leatherface
---
You seem delusional, I'll let the stats/other people disagreeing with you speak for themselves.
---
THANK YOU for finaly saying this. I've been preaching this practically since plague came out and no one believed me
---
Yes, as it's considered to be a killer instinct effect. Found that out the hard way against legion. You can't see the **aura** of a survivor in a locker, however, and survivors get the blindness effect until they leave the locker, too.
---
Is THAT how it works!? I thought it was based on how much of him was onscreen! Man I feel like a fucking idiot now
---
This is so fucking cursed, I love it

EDIT: spelling and grammar
---
Maybe youre just not good enough with the non-top-tier Killers . i see people having no trouble with a lot of Killers except maybe clown bubba doc and pig
---
Me either, I had to force myself to finish it. 
---
The Killer doesn't have any backstory, the final confrontation seemed nonsensical, and the protagonist was incredibly stupid at critical moments in the film just to lengthen the movie.
---
Which is a shame, because the concept is a pretty cool one.
---
It is, but he also has to be at the center of your screen
---
Trapper needs small changes, doctor needs massive ones. And legion, he needs changes and a whole goddamn rework.
---
yep, i think its a span of 4 meters where he can stalk but you cant reveal
---
For one: things that seem "serviceable" to us don't to him for a number of reasons. Part of those reasons might just be that he's bad, but he's playing at a very high rank. He also has a different playstyle than others which is why certain perks that are good for us aren't good for him.
---
But overall I think just the second-hand salt from getting half a dozen funny No Mither builds makes him a lot more cynical of "viable" builds as a whole. Perks like Stakeout, Distortion, Knockout, and Tinkerer all have their uses but if you've been given non-stop F tier perks even a B tier perk starts to look awful.
---
You contradict yourself with 
---
&gt;Unless... You're willing to spend a lot of time practicing it.
---
Nope. You cant get anybody at any normal loop with his ability because of the inability to turn quickly enough.
---
Yeah,you're really salty. That's tough.
---
I play against a lot onis. Wierd
---
You seen "Afro Samurai" , or just like bears in Japan
---
i play ps4 and he got me to purple ranks, he's great
---
I really haven‚Äôt played against plague too much, so please inform me. Why wouldn‚Äôt you cleanse? Doesn‚Äôt the sickness leave you in the injured state?
---
To use frenzy to injure and locate all the survivors. He‚Äôs versatile with a lot of builds since they have basic killer traits, but I think he synergizes with injure builds the most. Bring Thanatophobia, and use the Smiley pin for Mangled or Legion Pin for Broken status, and maybe even Dying light for extra slowing since Legion can offset the Obsession‚Äôs faster heals with their stabby nature. Injure as much people as you can, finish a chase and use BBQ n Chili to see where the next survivor is and snowball. You can also bring the Monitor and Nurse‚Äôs combo with this to locate healing survivors and possibly jump them. 
---
I‚Äôm also wanting to try bringing the Oni‚Äôs blood echo to make chasing injured survivors easier.
---
Basically reworked Legion has a lot of potential with injure based builds, but overall Frenzy is a great informational tool and now a pretty good mobility tool with the speed buffs. Some other things you can do:
---
- double duration add ons. These make your frenzy last just about forever and can be used to just make base legion gameplay more consistent.
---
- Iridescent Button. Still probably Legion‚Äôs best add on. Let‚Äôs them break pallets by vaulting them and makes their terror radius map wide, which makes them way less predictable.
---
Overall Legion is a decent and a very versatile killer that has potential, but in my opinion a higher than usual skill ceiling due to how easy it is to screw up and lose the power. You have to make sure you make your swings count, play unpredictably, and juggle to the best of your ability. People who learn Legion can be threatening but I don‚Äôt think to the point that they can be considered top tier, but when played properly can preform great!
---
its not that i care that people dont click on it. indulge in whatever ***"c o n t e n t"*** you wish, i more so have a problem with what this sub classifies as something worth discussing and talking about. i have a problem with how this game's community would rather just keep upvoting shitty memes that take &lt;5 minutes rather than something that actually took a lot of work, or something that invokes discussion about the the game, its developers and/or its community.
---
stop acting like such a smart ass because its not getting you anywhere. its proving my point moreso.
---
I always see these memes and am like wait people are actually like this? Than I started playing killer. My first game as Myers a Nancy kept t-bagging me and I finally got her and she DC‚Äôd. if you t-bag but can‚Äôt loop than stick to gens
---
I tried sitting through his cringy response to Scott "DamnNoHTML" response vid to his video about Spirit... 
---
Your comment holds true
---
r/Suddenlyincest
---
Well, I believe he might be playable with a lot of practice. Like 8 hours day for one week or more. Otherwise, he will be an entity displease machine.
---
Again, I‚Äôm a survivor main. Don‚Äôt know why so many people seem to think that just because I‚Äôm not an entitled asshole that wants to nerf my opponent into the ground means I‚Äôm a killer.
---
But hey, I suppose that‚Äôs your mentality, isn‚Äôt it? You don‚Äôt actually have a valid argument, so you strawman me instead. You don‚Äôt have anything intelligent to talk about or debate with, so you attack me instead.
---
And then you wonder why so many people complain about entitled survivors, right? You bring nothing but whiny and bitching to the community, you scream and cry and throw a tantrum because your opponent dared try and win, and all you care about is your own bias. Hell, most of y‚Äôall don‚Äôt even consider that the killer is a Dead by Daylight player who‚Äôs part of this community as well. You all cry about how your fun matters, but you don‚Äôt give a fuck about the killer‚Äôs fun.
---
God fucking forbid someone disagrees with your biased, entitled, self-important bullshit, right? Ever fucking wonder why all these complaint threads don‚Äôt escape /new? It‚Äôs because no one agrees with your shitty little opinion of how you want the game to be easier because the big mean killer tried to win.
---
Get the fuck over yourself. And once you do that, go to your high school English teachers and fucking apologize for wasting their time. I‚Äôm sure they tried extra hard to teach you the basic structure and rules of an argument, but it‚Äôs painfully obvious that nothing got through to you.
---
Yes because 99% of this reddit are trash in this game
---
well tbh Nemesis is a good perk so u either wait until it is in the shrine or buy him for it especially nemesis and PWYF
---
I mean, I believe you‚Äôre overblowing it. On switch at least, he‚Äôs an absolute blast dude
---
Yeah... Lol OK.
---
What glitch?
---
Does that really work?
---
Dude what are you talking about Hashinshin tactics is the best perk
---
The way it'll work is that you won't get a full-screen view.  
---
Killers get a 45-degree cone view  
---
While survivors get a circular view around them, and a 25-degree cone view in front of them. The circle goes through walls, while the cone doesn't.
---
Instead of having to hit the same person twice with ur Power now it will BE applied to every hit that is discoverd by the killer instinct
---
But people don‚Äôt have time. I got him yesterday night and I have had more success with nurse than him ever. There was a girl being farmed and I had my ability active, they were both standing still, I try to curve and miss them both. I hate it because he seems so much fun on PC but console players can‚Äôt have the same experience.
---
I personally like to run thana,spirit fury, enduring, and then switch out the last perk between bloodhound or discordinace. It is really nice for legion since bloodhound can help you find survivors (you can't see scratch marks in fury so when they break line of sight it can be difficult to refind them. Especially if they run spine chill and iron will.)  And enduring with spirit fury has helped me MANY times with my chases as legion. I'm still learning new things every day (I'm not a killer main and legion is the ONLY killer I ever give the time of day anymore) but for me personally, this build has definitely improved my game play. Happy hunting üòÅ enjoy the speedy boi
---
And it works
---
I'm serious, his mobility is amazing and if you don't try to go for hard demon mode hits hes great, just only hit if you have a good chance of hitting them, use specific perks and you're good to go
---
Oh, no.
---
I play him on ps4, hes incredibly fun and effective.
---
Hes a difficult killer to play well, that doesnt means hes bad.
---
Is there a video?
---
Wow!
---
Bubba doesn‚Äôt need a buff, still most op killer in the game.
---
Iron grasp + agitation + insidious + 1 survivor in basement + altruism = 2/3/4 survivors in basement.
---
Can‚Äôt fix what‚Äôs not broke. Never play bubba that‚Äôs just the only thing I‚Äôve seen him do in 3000 hours. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs other ways to play him but no one seems to go that route.
---
M&amp;A really worked out well! Just had my second match, the thrill of panicking Survivors as you run up on them is bliss!
---
Ah, I thought they were allowed to see the dulls too.
---
What are you talking about? I constantly get 4Ks in red ranks. He‚Äôs amazing and the killer I get the most 4Ks with. I play on console and he‚Äôs completely fine. Just put in a bit of time, get used to him, you‚Äôll be getting 4Ks in no time. You must have played him for a few matches and then decided he was a horrible killer.
---
You will still be able to flick when the bug is patched. The bug is using q and e to have extra flick capability
---
I'm not playing your stupid game
---
Didn‚Äôt know the fact that people disagree invalidated someone‚Äôs opinion. Thanks for the lovey education.
---
Moris are punishing for killers from your point of view for, ‚Äúshortening,‚Äù gameplay.
---
If you mori someone off first hook more than once you likely won‚Äôt pip and will get less bloodpoints.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to run a mori other than to use it to be toxic.
---
Oh and, ‚Äúsurvivor main,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make your point stronger especially since I‚Äôm a killer main.
---
It‚Äôs much easier to play survivor than it is killer and Moris are horrifically unfun for everyone, survivors and killers, as are keys.
---
Sounds like perfect game design with a high level of logic. Maybe we don't get it why they nerf pig or legion.. Maybe we are not smart enough
---
This is historically amazing
---
Or the lack of effort to try
---
They said that they are gonna look at leatherface but I do not know if that means that they are just gonna touch up his add-ons like the doctor but knowing BHVRs current course of action they are probably just gonna do that then nerf him more as if that is even possible. Bubba needs a total rework imo. His power is fucking useless in chases cus he cannot get close enough to survivors to down them with his power with that slowdown. Pwyf helps but a perk shoud not save a killer and their viability.
---
Get better at the game?
---
I‚Äôll get over the salt. Gonna forget about all this in a few minutes.
---
You‚Äôre forever gonna be an idiot with absolutely nothing but disappointment to provide to the world.
---
in the game, it is most likely intended from how it works just like how No Mither drops blood but logically it makes no fucking sense and also Lucky Break would be better if you didn't leave scratch marks either
---
Oh, so you can't prove it. And even if he did, how long ago was it? Hmm? Can you answer THAT?
---
Thanks! Had two matches so far, both been fantastic, really enjoying the chases. Discordance is MVP honestly, such a great Perk!
---
I mean the difficulty says **Hard** in bold so I assume it's not a character just to pick up and instantly dominate with.
---
Survivors are cancer. Get chased? Tunnel. They hide in a locker in the basement and get caught? Camping. Get downed in the first 5 mins? DC. Get mori'd? 'Lol bad killer'
---
Yeah, yeah I know 'not all survivors'. But a shit load of you are the problem.
---

---
You've come to the right subreddit for getting build ideas sir. :) While I myself don't have any builds, I'll list some good perks for you:
---
**BBQ + Chili** (Good on any killer)
---
**Ruin** (Good on any killer)
---
**Pop Goes the Weasel** (Good on any killer)
---
**Thanatophobia** (It's very easy to injure people as Legion, this is a benefit for his ability)
---
**Discordance** (So you don't have to waste time going to every generator to find a survivor, plus you can hit multiple survivors this way)
---
**Monitor and Abuse** (Both decreases your terror radius out of a chase to make you not as predictable and increases your terror radius in a chase so that when your using frenzy it can be easier to find and hit survivors)
---
**Thrilling Tremors** (So you know which gen to go to after you hook a survivor)
---
**Sloppy Butcher** (To increase healing time on top of the time it takes to mend, works good combined with Thanatophobia and Dying Light)
---
**Bamboozle** (Legion is a basic M1 killer, he'll need something to counter looping. Plus he can vault windows faster when he's in frenzy so this can benefit that as well)
---
**Nurse's Calling** (So you can see survivors who are healing, although it doesn't work with the mending time it could be useful combined with perks to slow down healing so they waste more time in one spot patching themselves up)
---
**Dying Light** (Another slowdown perk that piles on top of the healing time and mending)
---
**Dark Devotion** (Again, it's very easy to find and hit survivors as Legion, and if one of those survivors that you find is your obsession, you can very easily get 0 terror radius for 30 seconds)
---
**Franklin's Demise** (Once again, very easy for Legion to hit survivors and make this perk valuable on him)
---
**Infectious Fright** (So that you can potentially find many survivors when you down one survivor and cause a lot of pressure for them)
---
**Enduring + Spirit Fury** (Good on any M1 killer)
---
**Fire Up** (Again, Legion vaults windows faster in frenzy, he can also vault pallets in frenzy. This can be a benefit to that)
---
**I'm All Ears** (So when a survivor vaults a window or pallet in a chase you no longer have to predict which direction they'll go or what they're next move will be)
---
**Save the Best For Last** (As long as you don't find your obsession, it's very easy for you to get stacks and reduce the cooldown of your hits)
---
**Remember Me** (Again, it's easy for Legion to get stacks and slowdown the exit gate opening time, only with this perk you must find and hit the obsession)
---
**Stridor** (So survivors breathe louder so you can find and hit them with frenzy which will then potentially allow you to find and hit other survivors with frenzy)
---
**Blood Echo** (So when you hook a survivor, all other survivors can't use perks such as Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Sprint Burts, etc for 45 seconds due to exhaustion)
---
**Surge** (So when you down a survivor, all gens in your terror radius explode and regress. A bit outclassed by other slowdown perks but still useful on Legion)
---
**Nemesis** (Would've been completely broken on Legion if it didn't get changed after the PTB, but it got changed and isn't as useful as it would've been but is still a pretty solid perk in general.
---
Good luck. I hope you like Legion.
---
I always assumed time didn't work in the Entity's realm. Everyone is frozen at the exact moment they were kidnapped, like a living photograph (except for those who died, who were obviously healed/resurrected).
---
Proof?
---
Why should the survivor be punished for the game screwing them over though
---
You accuse people of trying to attack you, but then you make comments like this. Funny. Stay salty.
---
Convince me why I should listen to stats that only cover two months and is also not even relevant to anything I said.
---
Easier to swing his knife around, if you know what I'm saying
---
No. Its literally impossible with the senstivity. And some loops like the curved junk loops on autohaven are impossible to curve
---
Change was made several months ago. You can look for it if you want
---
That's awesome! I love M&amp;A on Legion!
---
Awe I see.
---
Like I said, lack of effort to try
---
I really like Bubba. Love to bash through pallets that survivors drop like it's nothing. Plus he gave us BBQ and Chili
---
Not the word id use, but sure.
---
cuz the guy that got killed just instantly loses the game regardless of how good he was doing in the match.
---
adrenaline is bullshit as well though, i will admit
---
Oh I got what you mean, maybe the text below I should write "Steven Crowder" instead of "the guy above". A nerve in my brain snapped somehow and I didn't think of that
---
His tweets most times are like survivors need everything or stuff like that, i think i made a poor selection if words but what i mean is that he makes most survivors feel entitled like they should be the only ones to get stuff you know
---
im on ps4, how do?
---
Probably best to mention ranks, I'm low teens in both
---
I really hate true talent he is annoying but otzdarva is funny and doesn‚Äôt take this game (a casual game) that seriously
---
Me, rank 20 killer: *looks at pallet 10 meters away*
---
Rank 20 survivor: *throws down pallet then proceeds to tbag aggressively*
---
I recently started watching him but all his videos are solo queue. I know a year ago his videos were swf because he played with noob but he no longer does that
---
what an absolutely glory hole
---
When did I say remove them all together? Never, I also carried on when I said ‚Äúfor shortening the game.‚Äù Didn‚Äôt know you were incapable of reading.
---
I also never screamed or cried while typing this, I‚Äôm just disagreeing with you and you jumped to insult me earlier on. Definitely the way to change someone‚Äôs opinion.
---
# *EXPOSED*
---
getting generators
---
you?
---
I like his complaining so much so he become a clown for us good side of dbd community, with his top tier gf and wraith, constantly believing in sfw while playing against pepegas, using 3 slow down perks to make killer OPTIMAL, and his clowny community who believes in everything he said, also hilarious to see his chat 
---
-tru winning "wow youre such a god
---
-tru losing "oh my gosh we cant believe it it was so hard god loops all around and survivors using pallets, and windows oh god and its sfw jeez gg tru you do your best!!!"
---
Sfw is a crime you know guys? Imagine having fun with friends?
---
Short answer: Lighting Bugs
---
Long Answer: Letting players influence the lighting occasionally produced amusing albeit annoying graphical glitches involving the lighting engine. In addition, devs wanted more control over the lighting of each map. Therefore, the offerings were removed.
---
And when you down them you see their body just die and you get hate messages
---
True Pigs will always spare Survivors who boop the snoot. Pig's my main Killer and it's an unofficial rule of playing The Pig as far as I'm concerned, haha. :)
---
And the debate goes on as to whether or not I should get the switch version...
---
Maybe it's better in higher ranks?
---
Glad to hear at least survivors match quickly
---
Stridor counters Iron Will. No Mither and Lucky Break should counter blood orbs.
---
yeah, i saw a youtuber that healed fully in 5 seconds but he was using other perks and a friend to help with effects to do it
---
I didn‚Äôt accuse you of attacking me, you did just that.
---
Then I attacked back.
---
Don‚Äôt want to be attacked? Don‚Äôt start attacking.
---
Fucking idiot. Your projecting is strong.
---
get out + bbq seems a bit too op
---
Pc servers are up..
---
Doesn't exist
---
You guys are getting 4K‚Äôs?
---
The time has come. As the prophecy foretold.
---
Jesus, 5 second heal time, you could heal at the pallet and when they're done breaking it, you'd be ready to go again.
---
Hear me out:
---
Tbh if I‚Äôm teabagging it‚Äôs tactical 
---
Say it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs final hook and the killer is just about to pick them up. 
---
I teabag to get the killers attention and make him chase me, giving my team more time to heal the survivor.
---
Discord app is down but DBD is fine.
---
https://status.discordapp.com/
---
That's my favorite thing to do as Huntress. It's like people don't realize she can throw hatchets over pallets and hit them if they run in straight lines.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to change your opinion.
---
I don‚Äôt need or care about changing your opinion.
---
You‚Äôre the one that wants a change in the game. It‚Äôs your job to argue it well enough to change other people‚Äôs opinion.
---
I mean, not everyone comes to r/deadbydaylight everyday. So some people missed it. 
---
I'll never get why people complain about reposts. If you've seen already, then why not just ignore it?
---
ps i like your flair
---
yeah his buddy would distract the killer for a bit and then boom, all fully healed, kinda broken
---
Happy cake day üñ§
---
Thanks I hate Steven Crowder Ash
---
that's broken af lmao
---
You‚Äôre a sped, you‚Äôre the one that went at OP for having a different opinion, so he‚Äôs the one that stated his opinion, if you were going to bother commenting you should‚Äôve tried to explain your position, you should go back to the doctor and ask for a late term abortion.
---
I didn't attack you a single time. I made a joke and you got salty then started accusing me. Keep being salty.
---
The entity reaches up from the ground, grabs the killer, and pulls them into the ground
---
Ah thank you. I did not know that. Not that I have enjoyed playing him on console anyway lol
---
Wipe a booger on the middle of your TV screen. Or put a piece of small tape, either way.
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/516929937
---
3:48
---
Because it's against the rules, first of all. This post breaks two of them. And 2nd of all because it's very annoying to see the same post from different people several times a week. I don't even come to the actual sub, I just see the endless reposts in my home feed. Stop making unoriginal "jokes"/memes that clutter the sub up and hide actual funny or interesting shit.
---
I didn't say he's bad, just unfun and requires hours or practice.
---
It‚Äôs not really whether he‚Äôs ‚Äúbetter‚Äù or not he‚Äôs just more interesting. Hillbilly‚Äôs power is just big chainsaw, which is effective, but boring af.
---
Didn't know that took 20 minutes
---
i don‚Äôt think anyone comes to dead by daylight because they like first person shooters, buddy
---
The problem is altruism. If he's camping in the basement just genrush his ass. Good job, you won
---
Your grammar irritates me
---
Yeah, I think i'll pass
---
I also don't care about your crutch perks carried ultra mega no one left behind escape full of 360 and console low rank killers thank you
---
I just got the game and everything is locked
---
What about using Pop instead of sloppy?
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
It was about damn time let's see it how they like it...
---
Then you dont play enough killer to witness it, you can't say something isn't OP because you don't use it and don't know how is it to go against it
---
still stan
---
He‚Äôs pretty easily to pick up just find someone hit them with frenzy move on using killer instinct and get as many as you can into deep wound, make a counter loop and intercept for a down and then rinse and repeat
---
It ain‚Äôt taking his feelings out. He‚Äôs legally entitled to a portion of the franchise which he‚Äôs responsible for the creation of.
---
That‚Äôs true I just killed myself in hook (don‚Äôt hate me lol the killer had a pink mori with iridescent head I wasn‚Äôt having fun so I did that, at the end of the day dbd it‚Äôs just a casual game I think dc penalties are going to kill the game because if the lobbies take a long shit time to find with this shit it will take 47 years more but tbh I can‚Äôt say anything till it starts happening)
---
Platform: Ps4
---
Description:
---
Sometimes when I‚Äôm playing as Nurse, survivors scream randomly when I‚Äôm nowhere near them. I know she has an addon now that makes survs scream when she blinks, but does it really have that big a range?
---
Sometimes they do but if I see them going or a pallet I start winding it up because I know as soon as it drops theres that tiny delate before they move again and if my aim is true they get smacked right as they move
---
_Cute Pig noises_
---
hard reset switch or redownload game
---
I have this little trick I do with Hag where I throw down a trap next to pallet in the middle of a chase. Then I chase them around the other way and they pop the trap and throw down the pallet. Then I just stand there. Half the time they think I'm gonna teleport to the trap, so they vault over the pallet, directly into me. I've pulled it off a surprising number of times. Shit is hilarious.
---
And with a name like that he really doesn't need any help thinking any more of himself.
---
"TrueTalent" lmao, I know nothing about this guy other than his name and he's already making me roll my eyes into infinity.
---
So you just got into DBD?
---
Say goodbye to your sanity.
---
Say sike right now
---
Really it was took like 2 hours to download
---
Im playing him only since update is come out at 1st rank(if only its matter somehow) and win every single match, even i played coldwind all fucking day today, his speed buff is awesome, his vault speed buff is wonderful, i know reddit is whiny bitch, but i impressed how nobody knows how to play in this game, and you know you not stuck in 4 perks and can try to use your brain and change perks to your playstyle
---
*leans in to Claudette as he kills her with Michael‚Äôs mori*
---
‚Äú...a piece of me is inside of you.‚Äù
---
I think you might have to do the tutorials. That should unlock the rest of the stuff for you, give it a try.
---
&gt; Because it's against the rules, first of all. This post breaks two of them.
---
The last two rules are really ambiguous and that's why the mods don't really bother with these post.
---
&gt; 2nd of all because it's very annoying to see the same post from different people several times a week.
---
*"Very annoying?"* Seeing the same post on Reddit is one of the last things that keeps me up at night. But hey, to each their own I guess.
---
I did both survivor and killer
---
I think the solution to your problems is to try playing a different killer until they fix trapper. Obviously he's broken right now but you choose to punish yourself and then cry on reddit about it the same way that people could have avoided being near the basement but decided to go down right in front of it then cry that the killer took them there.
---
Y'all aren't really bright are you?
---
Unfortunately, you must do tutorial first
---
Clearly this means that Legion is still to powerful as a Killer
---
I did already
---
Do you have the internet membership? That could be a possibility as well.
---
All of it?
---
Is it fully installed? If it is do the tutorial
---
What about finishing the tutorials? Maybe it's locked because of that.
---
it could?, how so?
---
Thana, Monitor, Corrupt Intervention, Dark Devotion.
---
That's my build that I use on Legion since I main them and it works surprisingly well
---
It‚Äôs a lot better than what it was 1-2 years ago.
---
Does everybody remember Pallet Vacuums? Super fast heal speeds? No bloodlust? No vault-blocking? Flashlight Stuns that could cancel and drop you no matter how you timed it? Moonwalking Legion?
---
It almost makes me sad because a lot of people who left the game back then most likely won‚Äôt ever come back because of how broken the game used to be.
---
I‚Äôm not following you. Rank 18 as legion, I also can barely counter loop and end up mind gaming myself when trying to hit a survivor right infront of me
---
Then do the tutorial
---
Here's True's POV, for posterity: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/516947661
---
2:28
---
I did
---
I love this reply lol
---
The difference is that survivors generally have a ‚Äúlot‚Äù of time to be doing things, while killers are pretty much constantly trying to choose between 3/4 different objectives that need their attention.  It *should* take a long time for survivors to interact with totems because the survivors have time to do it.
---
Its so fucking weird to me they gave an artist skin to Jane but not Jeff
---
Just like spirit I picked her up and instantly destroyed survivors so you can‚Äôt base everything off a word. Duh
---
What are Doctors issues? Kinda new to the game and haven't faced him or played him much.
---
Should put a warning for that lol
---
Insert meme of nea killer
---
Perk vs power. I'm pretty sure the devs don't want perks countering a power. Thus why undetectable was added. To stop things like object from destroying stealth powers.
---
3 hours 48 min I imagine
---
He gets all of entity's power
---
top notch video quality
---
nooo, he doesnt deserve the money ):
---
Sorry
---
I‚Äòm that fucking killer. Like this poor guy doesn‚Äòt deserve this.
---
That glitch has been happening I heard it could be because your to close when you start kicking but I can‚Äôt confirm
---
Very nice
---
Congrats!
---
I like that you can see the resemblance to Naughty Bear in this footage.
---
The walk/injured animations, the foliage and crouching, it‚Äôs interesting to see BHVR where they are now in terms of modeling/animation now
---
But thats the exact problem that right there, that mentality. The only limiting factor in this game is your own performance and how you play, so stop trying to push the blame or say stuff like "teammates may actually be a limiting factor" no, thats not what is limiting you, you are what is limiting you.
---
I had a moment as hag earlier this week where I got stuck on a generator (fix your shit BHVR). 
---
After flashlight clicking, trapped hooks, and a pallet teabags, this one Meg I hadn‚Äôt seen all game came over and worked on the gen, allowing me to grab her, and freeing me from my prison. I let her wiggle free and followed her around for the rest of the match without attacking just to ensure she got a bunch of points.
---
*DoYouThinkLoveCanBloomEvenOnABattlefield.jpg*
---
Thank you :)
---
I thought he is German. He yelled "Schei√üe" once
---
That is true, pun unintended. He takes the game way too seriously. Probably one of the best examples is his one Ghostface video where a Steve teabags literally once and he spends the rest of the video complaining about teabagging.
---
I think once you've played a game too much you stop having fun with it. He's said that he doesn't like Fortnite but I think Tru3 would be really fun to watch play Hearthstone or some auto-battler.
---
Would be a cool feature in-game. Would help for chases as Killer a lot
---
Welcome to hell
---
That‚Äôs exactly what you did. Now shall we let this rest
---
I just had a reverse of that. 4King a full flashlight teabag team without getting blinded, and punishing all their altruism. GHOSTFACE BABY üò´üò´üò´
---
Because you still have it bound to spacebar instead of something like the mouse scroll wheel.
---
And she's a *poser* artist anyway, it even says so in the skin description!
---
No it's not killer good survivor bad it's because people are quite tired of the teabagging shit that toxic people do and yes their are toxic killers but we also get told how to play all the time and you hardly see killers telling survivors how to play ... Why? Because most people with some sense don't tell others what to do on this game because no one payed to get bullied
---
What happened to the other survivor that completed the gen?
---
Oh mb
---
Out of topic a bit but I remember in the starting days of DbD people really did think this perk was OP.
---
If you read all these threads and took it all as "mindless raving" it only proves your own personal bias.  Whether you agree with them or not, there were plenty of comments framed intelligently enough that consisely specified their opposing opinions to his viewpoints.  Don't marginalize thoughtful responses to your post as "raving" just because you're a fan of someone.
---
I played trapper a few days ago for the archives. Map was haddonfield, which is my most hated, but trapper can be really good on. I placed some random traps and first gen pops, fuck. But after that I snowballed so hard because they always stepped in traps. I received a message mid-match from the Feng, that stepped in 3 traps in a row, that told me that I'm just an incredible noob. Ok, I guess
---
good perk to pair with things like save the best for last or remember me. Its also just kinda bitter murmur but with a bonus effect.
---
because the 'day of the dead' skin makes him shirtless
---
At this rate we‚Äôll have to
---
Show em who‚Äôs boss !
---
Idv literally forces the killer to camp to win, should be really be taking ideas from that game?
---
Sure
---
Just my opinion but No Mither should be default, at least for the last survivor. It‚Äôs just not fun crawling around until you die because the killer lost you and your teammates are getting chased. It‚Äôs also not fun to lose a survivor as killer and know that you‚Äôll be wandering around aimlessly for the next few minutes. 
---
Maybe perkless players could only revive once per trial? I feel that‚Äôs fair.
---
have you even played that game? i used to play it alot and they are definitely not forced to camp lmao

Guess im just dense. Now excuse me as i go play some perkless solo survivor at red rank and still pip 90% of the time. Can you explain how the game has changed immensely since then? Inb4 insta heals and broken perks got nerfed even though they ran 0 perks or items. The only people that think killer has the upper hand 75% of time are people that dont play killer at red ranks.
---
Hahahahhahaha I got the best build for you, survivor will love it. Ruin, thanphobia, dying light, pop goes the weassle
---
...what am I looking for?
---
I think the duration is fine, I just think it should not work if someone else got hooked since you got unhooked. You can't call it tunneling at that point imo.
---
Doctor really needs one though. Trapper has a really high skill ceiling so you can do some interesting plays with him. Doctor you kinda just shock people and reveal their location and it‚Äôs pretty lackluster except the few times you get the opportunity to prevent a vault or pallet drop. And this is coming from a doctor main xD
---
The higher you get as killer the faster the games are, the opposite for survivors
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be against that.
---
Then he lies to his ignorant viewers about making up builds and play styles and wonders why no one takes him seriously.
---
Yes, I even joined their subbreddit*, you get shit talked and downvoted into oblivion for saying camping is a bad strategy, look at my account I posted a comment on their subreddit saying its a bad strategy and I had to say ‚ÄúOk I changed my mind‚Äù for them to stop downvoting me
---
I just started using him so I‚Äôm not sure how he was before the patch. But I‚Äôm not a fan of how you can‚Äôt down people in frenzy mode. Like if you hit the same survivor twice it doesn‚Äôt do anything to em and triggers your cooldown. If it weren‚Äôt for that I‚Äôd consider maining him instead of Mikey
---
Yesssss
---
The rules I'm referring to are not ambiguous at all. They're the rules against Unrelated Content and Oversaturated Content.
---
I didn't say it keeps me up at night, I said it's annoying.
---
Adam has been in the game for how long and only has like 26 cosmetic pieces???? Give the guys of dbd some love
---
Thanks, yeah Dark Devotion seems like a trip for Survivors, oh the mind games, lol!
---
Yup, always get it when I play survivor but never killer. It sucks cause I wanna get my challenges done but I just can't
---
Seems brutal! Will give it a shot though! Haha!
---
And when you break the pallet and get to them 5 seconds later they're the first to call you sweaty and say you tunnel. Bitch, if you didn't do stupid stuff you wouldn't be so easy to kill.
---
He started the match with it, he had it all match, and once I closed the hatch he flashlight flickered at me. And it still wasnt depleted.
---
i would try to run but they wouldn‚Äôt stop healing so i was locked in position while they healed. i kept spamming buttons but they wouldn‚Äôt let go
---
A fleshlight you say? üëÄ
---
You want to back up where I ‚Äúwent at OP?‚Äù
---
How about quoting from the original comment?
---
Otherwise, you‚Äôre just spewing shit like always.
---
when talking about queues, please, always say where you're from (at least US/Europe/Asia) and platform you're playing on (Xbox, PC, PS4, Switch)
---
rank would also help a lot
---
Also, Searching as a killer, mentions survivor rank in the post, this is confusing :((
---
Actually no one has anything against BBQ, lol. It should be ruin and noed.
---
If I put all my settings on as low as I can get them from ingame it doesn't look like that
---
Plateform: PS4
---
Type/Bug: Visual
---
There is a bug with Oni mask, Sanguinary Mask that is making the red eyes appear on the screen. Seems to trigger when in demon mode.
---
That would be a solid argument if the perk didn‚Äôt release the same time as the killer. You have a killer that‚Äôs ability revolves around blood and they drop a killer that has a perk that stops you from bleeding.
---
One of his dead teammates had probably brought/found a key and the player just picked it up when you were not looking
---
Like I told everyone else, he had the flashlight even while falling in the hatch. It's hard not to see a giant stick in a black guys hand compared to a tiny key I can only spot during lobby time.
---
As spirit stay still for 2-3 seconds and they'll think you're haunting. Dummies jump right over that pallet and it's easy pickings at that point. Works 80% of the time.
---
I was considering NOED but I didn‚Äôt want to list 2 Hex Perks
---
Yeah I was on lowest settings
---
You can decide to run actually. They can‚Äôt force you to be healed
---
Mind game killers really are the best since it feels so satisfying To just straight outplay someone
---
If you have a clip of the escape I'm sure someone here could tell you what happened, but going off the info you have, they shouldn't be able to escape.
---
I didn't love the movie, but i did love the parts where the guy used a faceless mask
---
Yeah I can find the post of you want
---
maybe it‚Äôs a PS4 problem
---
During a chase tho? you cant run and pick up packages like this is mirrors edge. And my eyes been on him none stop.
---
&gt;Afk'ing is against the game's rules, and is reportable under "Unsportsmanlike Conduct".
---
The in-game report list is outdated. 
---
In here there is no mention of AFKing being bannable (it also doesn't list it as allowed):
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system#latest
---
&gt;This isn't about that one person, but the 3-4 others in the match. Everyone * hates AFK'ers in *every multiplayer game.
---
I'm not sure I fully understand what this even mean after saying all the issues with forcing someone to stay in a match he wants out.
---
I was correlating it with lizard squad coming back, I thought they ddosed all the servers again lol
---
Well I would have left that out of the title. Or maybe explained it. Just this seems like the typical ‚ÄúRank reset bad‚Äù repost, but not even at the right time lol
---
Please do, I'm curious about how this actually went down.
---
That's wild accusation you can't even back up lol if anything you're on your high horse claiming you just "dominate" with Spirit. Like I said not everyone is you or OP.
---
I ran that and kept getting found first anyway... eventually we got the new map which is so dark it's hard to see survivors that want to be found and I got it
---
I was done with immersed playstyle after a single match... this is painful to play, how can so many people have that as their default playstyle?
---
I tried to record but I only can record 2 minutes previous on xbox. And all it caught was just me sitting at the end game lobby.
---
that's a very good observation you have there u/kingreaper504 
---
probably because no mither is literally being a one hit down for the entire game. there should be no reason that the oni can track a survivor in the start of the game and get that survivor downed with one hit. also allowing him to receive his power for absolutely nothing, just following around a no mither, then using his power to down the other survivors when he hasn't hit anyone else yet is also unfair. why? why? and again why? why should killers be allowed to down a survivor and know what perk they're using simply by looking into the bottom left at the start of a match?
---
*Ghostface while camping the hooked survivor. 
---
FTFY
---
&gt;That's why right there. People left if the others weren't "good enough" for them because of the rank.
---
I mean... there is no fun in being a survivor rank 10 ~ 1 being put together with 2 or 3 rank 20s. It is frustrating. Specially when the killer you are going up against is the same rank as you. 
---
People rank up to hopefully get better teammates only to be cucked  by matchmaking.
---
Yes dodging teammates might be a problem but hiding everyone's rank is not a solution.
---
*When the killer try‚Äôs to break pallet and accidentally get raped by flashlights*
---
Depends on what you consider "viable". 
---
Every killer is viable at any ranks unless you want to 4k at 5 gens every game, then you might struggle with some.
---
I was permabanned from him for a long time for getting into an argument with him about this way back during For Honors release, when he beats someone it's because he's really good and the other player is ALSO really super good, he's just way better. When he loses, the person is either a bug abuser, lucky, etc., Nobody was ever just better than he was, always an excuse.
---
I never called it bad. It's just that I don't play this game for long periods of time and then I get placed like 10 ranks back due to rank reset, which is what happened here. I didn't even look at the date, but I guess you are right it's a bit out of place.
---
*all of this*
---
Plus, as a survivor I prefer having two health states and not getting my teamates sick/one hit to down.
---
And also her vomit isn't hard to avoid. As long as you get behind cover around a loop, she can't hit you.
---
Then stop playing my dude. We all play games for fun. If it ever gets to the point it‚Äôs really affecting you, put it down and return later down the line.
---
He's hit or miss.  I've had great games against good groups at red ranks and I've also got dunked on playing him too.  His biggest strength is Self Care Gamer lobbies.  You get a couple of them in your lobby while you run his typical anti heal perks along with some gen slowdown perks and you just watch them heal the game away as they essentially get their whole team killed.  It's pretty great and you notice it as you see it and just feel firmly in control of the whole match throughout.  Then again you could get a solid swf that knows to stay hurt and just plows the gens and his games can go very differently.
---
It's not dumb to want to try and actually get to play the game. That situation isn't survivors not knowing how to beat it, it's an issue of that whole schtick being boring and people would rather throw and have something to do than be made afk bots.
---
That whole playstyle needs to be removed.
---
r/woooosh
---
Insuppose everyone could use some practice. I hope you also practice and get good enough to experience red rank killer. Good luck to you as well
---
It happens but it takes a lot, i guess. I'm unfortunately a red rank killer and i used to disconnect constantly to go back to green/brown ranks and i got banned for a week. now i just suck it up and lose to the seal team six SWFs
---
You can't hide when sick and loud, always cleanse near corners if you can.
---
I use a stealth build so fuck not cleansing
---
I think doctor is great and his zap stopping people from doing things for 2.5 seconds can end chases quite quickly also madness is just annoying in general
---
shock range, without an addon you've to almost be on top of them to get a shock on a survivor. Survivors can also just run right into you and avoid being hit by it. The effect can help prevent pallets and loops but its not guaranteed as a smart survivor can just keep running around if its a normal loop or a loop able wall.  Time to swap from shock to mele hit might make you miss the hit aswell
---
He might feel strong from ranks 20-10 but after that you run into survivors who know how to deal with it and you've yet another killer that needs hex ruin just to extend the game
---
Some addons are lack luster aswell. Red stain doesn't do much, illusions are only good for pinpointing locations and illusionary pallets don't help too often.
---
Also fuck hostage doc  
---
And fuck doc's that camp in treatment for the ez grab
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs player count or if the servers for console are down but whatever it is I hope that I can at least do one match as the killer
---
I just want to play in lower rank lobbies welters I can play the game casually without anyone ruining the game for me, I definitely don‚Äôt think I even belong in red ranks considering I‚Äôve been playing the game for 4 months I feel like 4 months is way too quick to reach a ‚Äútop tier level of play‚Äù yellow and green ranks was filled with fun times and laughs with my friends but now it‚Äôs just us being angry and screaming because the matchmaker is actuall dog shit, idk why they thought that the highest rank player should make the match making
---
I used to love tru3, but recently he's so fucking whiney. Saying 'this isn't an opinion, it's fact, and I'll keep saying if until people admit it' just makes him sound like a child because he thinks killers are so hard done by. 
---
Yesterday he moaned about killers and then in the same sentence said out of his last 16 games, 15 were a 4 man! Bet the game he 'lost' had meta try hard SWF. Yawn.
---
Thats a console problem...
---
It lights up on other platforms too
---
I can‚Äôt play the game anymore and in red ranks 9/10 killers are oni
---
"Oh a mechanic that makes me not die in one hit, I'll use this mechanic!" &lt;- literally no brain
---
Cool, I play him at Rank 1 on Xbox NA. I have won 13 games in a row with a 4K with him. 
---
All of the Survivors made terrible mistakes that I capitalized on, for example, body blocking to hook and heavy altruism. I could have done it with Leatherface. 
---
That doesn't make Legion good.
---
Welcome to 3 gens being popped in one chase, 98% of your matches will be vs. SWF, Adrenaline/Dead Hard/DS and I'd anyone escapes, tbags at the exits.
---
Ok....
---
When they see that there's Bloodwarden active, then start crying
---
And you‚Äôre making it sound as if those are rare, which they are not. Countless times I‚Äôve had to disconnect because of a bug
---
Once you get the hang of them it‚Äôs pretty easy to do but it never gets old
---
Well you can kinda mindgame as surv as well if you pretty much get q&amp;q and dwm, but you're right
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and yeah I get it a lot especially after getting a 4K
---
Bhvr needs to fix this game it‚Äôs bad right now
---
i wonder how the after game chat looked like
---
Nice work
---
you gens, doing?
---
Someone in the comments mentions wanting to do this, guess that could be where you got it.
---
I was curious for the same reason they got shut down there. In order to pull it off all gens would need to be done with at least one gate already openand you wouldn't even have blood warden to keep them in if you're going for moris's, so the amount of failure from the survivor's that is required is astronomical for this to work.
---
Nontoxic survivors are rare, but we exist.
---
Have you tried playing on a PC yet?
---
And that's why killers have powers at the use to take survivors out in a matter of moments, opportunity provided.
---
Survivors don't have a whole lot for defense. Luck and a couple meta perks, ability to outplay the killer at walls and tiles, etc
---
Even as a wraith main, I agree.
---
just so you know, the statistics are out there..
---
I have always wanted a naked decapitated young girl for xmas
---
‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù
---
Yeah so sexy
---
&gt;What's a survivor's greatest asset? Stealth.
---
Maybe in yellow ranks. Survivor's actual greatest asset is good looping, which is harder to do when the killer has a ranged attack.
---
You see the thing with that is, both of those scenarios don't fully counter the killer. Put yourself in worse case scenario for all 3 killers. Trapper gets all of his traps sabod pretty rough, but that's a lot of game stall, and he still has carried traps, along with his traps recovering. Doctor against 4 man calm spirit. You're not screaming to reveal position, sure. But you aren't stopping the skill checks nor the other affects that insanity comes with. But with Oni if everything made sense, a 4 man no mither squad would cause him to become the worst m1 killer. Sure, he passively gains power and when he hooks he gains 2 orbs so theoretically he could get how power. However being injured isn't as dangerous as it seems. There's a reason plague and legion aren't great. Both 115 killers but if you just stay injured they aren't dangerous. So while I think you could do something with it, maybe drop 50% blood. You can't remove it without destroying him.
---
Also I am aware worst case scenarios are not likely, it is an interesting way to gauge how weak someone can be, regardless of skill.
---
But that contradicts what you think of people posting 4K wins, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
If only she didn't want me dead, I would gladly invite her any time.
---
Ah, that explains why the Dwight next to me got pissed off when I cleansed. Thanks!
---
DS is BS
---
"I'll forever be inside of you now."
---
I will only be okay with an Amanda without a pig head only if they get Shawnee Smith for facial capture.
---
Only ever posted my first one. Ot was a big moment for me.
---
Leatherface mains? That‚Äôs a thing?
---
I played yesterday, so yes
---
I pulled it up to that moment, 3hrs and 48min in and I didn't see it. Every one got out on Coldwind. In a 7hr video, it'll be hard to pin point. Ill try 3min 48sec but that seems too short
---
Been doing this a lot today. So many toxic SWF. Just turned a 0K game into a 4K game because the altruistic SWF couldn't let their buddy die. T-bag and spam flashlight, and you will receive no mercy. Your arrogance and disrespect will be rewarded with equal toxicity.
---
That said, I did have a somewhat wholesome game too. Two survs were left and I had the last three gens dead-locked. I couldn't find the survs for like four minutes. They failed a couple skill-checks to get my attention, and I found them huddled in a corner together. Turns out, they knew they were screwed. I decided to just take one of them, and gave the other hatch.
---
the issue is no mither vs. oni.
---
Totally agree imagine if survivors were doing it too that would be crazy!
---
What? Almost no one is playing him at red ranks. You‚Äôre delusional
---
Haddonfield is an absolute bitch to play on for killers
---
lol if anything Oni is incredibly underpowered in console but okay bruh
---
This is nice. As someone who hasn't played very often in the last 6 months, the cleanse/don't cleanse argument is always a pain the backend.
---
I realize that, he is absolute dog shit but he lags the game so much that he is good idk how it is on Xbox but PS4 is unplayable with him
---
Agreed. I shamelessly admit that I dc every time ghostface marks me while I'm literally staring at him with him not even moving
---
Yeah, we exist. He‚Äôs my second most played killer, purely because how much I love the TCM franchise. You just don‚Äôt see him picked very much at higher ranks because even his most dedicated playerbase knows that against a good team, it‚Äôs going to be just not fun.
---
lol holy shit you‚Äôre fucking insane
---
Goddamn nut job
---
Wouldn‚Äôt get hooked 3 times in a row if they stopped running directly into my crotch every time they get unhooked.
---
Against potatoes, sure.
---
Against coordinated 4-man teams, no.
---
I‚Äôm rank 2 and I‚Äôve played 6ish games today and faved him 5/6 games
---
I agree with most of your killer tiers, though I‚Äôm not sure where to put oni (because he‚Äôs so new) or nurse (because I haven‚Äôt seen very many good nurses since the nerf).
---
Doesn‚Äôt help that in almost every game the Pig patrols the boxes and tunnels me when my trap is almost done so when I do escape it just goes off lmao
---
I play on PS4 and I've never experienced this lag against Oni and I've played against him a lot.
---
I honestly haven‚Äôt had too many laggy experiences, and I‚Äôve played like 10 Oni‚Äôs in the past 2 days at red ranks so i feel you on that
---
Please stop stalking my profile, you‚Äôre a fucking prick
---
I hope to one day to play some lol
---
What do you mean "still" , they never really were
---
I rarely come up against Ghost Face, love the look of the killer, is he worth getting, I've been thinking about buying him
---
ok damn
---
"Both those maps are extremely survivor sided actually."
---
&gt;Data shows them to be the least survivor sided maps in the game
---
"Not even relevant to anything I said"
---
Lay off the drugs buddy.
---
Ah, that's on you to be honest, I would've hit the record button while loading the scoreboard if not just to rewatch and see what I missed. 
---
As others have said it should not be possible going solely off what you said for this to happen. 
---
So without video and it not supposed to be able to happen that's why we are all saying you missed them picking the key up.
---
People who post opinions is equivalent to both no body cares
---
Yea this is very annoying. So many killers dc after a couple loops and you get nothing. Also it‚Äôs even worse when you lose whatever item you took and offering.
---
One time I had 3 Gel Dressing, 3 abdominal dressings add ons and I decided to put a pair on a yellow medkit. I had the killer DC mid game and I lost ALL the add ons. My friend I was playing with asked if I used the other accidentally but I remember wanting to save 2 abdominal for the two green medkits that I had.
---
i just dont like the hypocrisy he has going for him
---
he complains about toxic survivors but when playing killer he will do things like slug so the hatch wont spawn which is a toxic killer move as its ruining the game for the slugged person while creating an unwinnable situation for the last person. when killers do that to me i DC so the last person can get the hatch
---
My game literally fucks itself, do you think that‚Äôs my PS4? My internet isn‚Äôt laggy typically unless it only lags against oni. Same thing happens when demogorgan teleports for me but his isn‚Äôt nearly as bad so I ignore it
---
Is Ussylis a actual stupid Survivor main? Or are they just wrong about this? They always seemed reasonable to me...
---
TBH, some of the only situations where Survivors can actually get stuck is the second floor of Thompson House with the Killer bodyblocking the stairs and getting stuck in a corner of the map by a Killer + another Survivor working with the Killer, maybe.
---
The former is the only thing resembling a noteworthy complaint, however that is a map issue. Adding a deliberately unsafe vault to the top of the stairs (that lets the Survivor fall down right next to the stairs inside the house. Not outside.) would fix this. A Survivor could escape the Killer by using that vault if the Killer refuses to down them. And if the Survivor is downed somehow and the Killer tries to carry them back upstairs, the Survivor could use DS or other Survivors could bodyblock/flashlight save.  
---
I can't wait for the DC penalty. :D
---
I don't watch any of the popular streamers but I don't know why it's suddenly become 'cool' to post negative stuff about people? Is it so hard to let people watch who they want to watch? It's the most playground-bully type thing possible and does my head in. The fact this post has hundreds of upvotes is crazy. The guy is playing the game how he wants to play and his viewers clearly enjoy it. If you don't like it just don't watch. Don't make a Reddit post about it so a bunch of people can all agree and throw irrational hate at someone because they want to do well in a video game and try and justify their childish behaviour.
---
I'm personally not a fan of the not cleansing tactic to be honest. It's fine if this is a pro gamer esport tournament tactic, but in reality under normal circumstances, it's pretty stupid. You're intentionally one hit/Myers3/NOED + extremely loud for the whole match just to avoid the spitting attack that doesn't even insta downs you, it just makes one single hit and for that you throw away an f'n insta health with the cleansing, that's insane to me. In my mind, this doesn't make much sense. Being intentionally one hit is a huge disadvantage even if she doesn't make anything else then hitting you completely normal.
---
On console he‚Äôs a really bad killer but he just makes my shitty PlayStation lag so much
---
For a "weak" Killer, he is actually quite loved. And I'm quite honest. I have a heart for him as well. Bubba is Love, Bubba is life.
---
No you said me. Quit changing your story kidüòÇ

Thicc Latina MILF gets Impailed in the Woods
---
Youve always been able to 99% sprintburst
---
I‚Äôm rank 1 and like 50% of my games are Oni but I don‚Äôt get the frame drops. I also have the launch PS4
---
Using no mither is intentionally putting yourself at a disadvantage. You can't expect to use this perk and have an upper hand against the killer. Why should a killer know what perk someone is using before they even see them? I could answer that with my questions. Why can a survivor know that I am using Huntress lullaby before a single stack is applied to the perk? Why can all 4 survivors play as the same character and dress the same so I cant tell who I am chasing until I get a hit? Why can all 4 survivors have the same name and fuck up the game so it doesn't properly track who has been hooked or downed or hit? There are some things that seem fair to one side but they don't look at it from the other sides perspective.
---
He's actually said he likes Otz and thinks he seems like a nice guy.
---
Not really, he just cheeses ranks really easy since you're basicly getting hits and chases forever which means you have 2/4 emblems iri with no effort, then use ruin and corrupt and you have gatekeeper gold pretty much every game
---
I love your art style it‚Äôs so cute
---
r/ialreadyknewthejoke
---
No you‚Äôre just stupid
---
Happened to me today with the Plague. She just follows us and head nodded to let us know that she was going to let us escape and stuff.
---
Once all gens were done, Boom Noed was rained down on us. Seriously fuck that plague. And fuck me for falling for it.
---
That amazing I LOVE IT
---
Fucking incredible, they deserved nothing less. Bodyblockers have no rights and you're amazing.
---
Looping is a survivors best asset, even if they are a one shoot, you can't avoid the puke if you are in an animation so you can't use pallets nor windows, how do you avoid it?
---
all of your posts on this sub have been shitty zero effort memes

Huh, they added another new killer: choke jerking.

I know right?

Thanks laddy

The Killer running no perks addons

never hooks anybody just slugs

but gets called a dick vs a lobby of meta builds in red ranks

Me: if yall would have just stepped in my traps 5 times this trial, and not tbag me this wouldnt have happened
---
The wraith is soooo cute along with the Billy
---
I seriously hate when people bring up the idea of a killer disguised as a survivor. BHVR has already said they won‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs also fucks with gameplay a LOT. Get over it.
---
They extremely rare compared to when people DC because of salt
---
Idk what to tell you then, I‚Äôve played against a shit ton of them today and whenever he uses his power he lags my PlayStation so bad
---
4 out of 91 comments are complaining, and 2 of those comments were downvoted into controversial. This is hardly a 'cesspool of whiny survivors'
---
I‚Äôve only played a few matches against Oni because no one is playing him on PS4 but I‚Äôve had no lag issues with him
---
Sounds like a you problem
---
Depends on how they get a 4k
---
I don't think killers internet matters with dedicated servers. The servers are generally pretty shitty
---
So I should stop playing Spirit, Doctor and Ghostface as well? It didn't happen with Trapper only. 
---
Oh right, maybe I should uninstall the whole game because there is a bug here and there. 
---
"survivors could've avoided the basement bug by not being near it" 
---
This is literally the dumbest solution to a problem I've ever read.
---
(edited because I forgot to quote)
---
This is such an ignorant meme considering the almost endless list of bug fixes every patch. 
---
Besides, how else would they make money to pay the people fixing bugs? Hugs?
---
Ok you can leave now

Doesn't do a mistake, surv escapes with 3 gens done slowclap

Just some child who was being toxic over someone not liking his angry pug. Typical fan in his fan base
---
I'm on ps4, so we still have the host.
---
I agree some times I sit well over 15-20 mins. Other games it's like 5.
---
&gt;There's always a possibility they were thrown back by not play though. The reason my friend was 16 is because he was thrown back for not playing a lot and we were bringing him back up
---
I know that but your friend probably has a character leveled up which would be a good indication for people not to dodge him but this is not the case when someone rank 16 with a character level 20 joins the lobby.
---
Why are you complaining about camping a person on hook? This was designed for people not to camp so if you did there would be consequences.
---
And also ask any killer with a large amount of games and they'll tell you that playing against immersed survivors is way more boring than ones who are ballsier.
---
Love it. Loud noices coming your way seas leeping gorgoon coming your way. You start runing. He shreds you down, then start's to heal you. Mfw
---
my bad for giving the wrong impression, 
---
good luck on your challenges, and have a blessed weekend in the fog
---
Right now the med kit add ons are broken. It is 16 a heal just the game isnt adding the add ons to the charge amount. It's been happening since oni came out.
---
And medkit and toolbox and, well, everything you see there lol.
---
I just searched for the word "charges" and this came up as first result:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e69sr6/psa_medkit_charge_addons_are_broken/
---
Witchcraft, I know.
---
I've not really watched any streamers for this game. They usually are either super toxic or annoying.
---
Ahh right that explains it! Thanks for letting me know
---
http://www.gadgethelpline.com/rebuild-sony-ps4-database/
---
Saw this on this reddit and the dude said it helps him a ton so worth a shot
---
Good luck on yours also and if you're all finished hopefully you have good/fun games and don't have terrible hook sabotaging swf lobbies!
---
Pins are 60 secs each and it works only on secondary targets. They're very bad
---
Yeah whoops I only just found that post, I was searching for the wrong things, will delete the post now ^^
---
tbh i just use noed because it counters adrenaline
---
It's not. That's a modified render.
---
This is what she really looks like: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e7d38h/closeup_shots_of_amanda_youngs_face/
---
I‚Äôll try it, lag has been ruining this game for me recently might aswell try it
---
OoO doesnt require you to be the obsession, it just gives you more range.
---
Spirit kinda cute tho
---
Yah I wasn‚Äôt a fan either you should check out ‚Äúyou‚Äôre next‚Äù it kinda has the same premise of home invasion but with a family reunion it has dark comedy and a mix horror it pretty cool
---
I think people know. They just want to play with their friends.
---
You don't have to be the obsession to use OoO so I don't fully understand the thought process here.
---
I'm personally waiting for a bit if Lebowski skin and have him as the dude
---
I‚Äôve been wanting to try it just haven‚Äôt gotten around to it
---
There's a easy solution; don't queue with them or they'll just learn the game the hard way. You can't balance otherwise or you could really easy abuse the system to boost people to rank 1
---
Updated the post, thanks for letting me know
---
They just can't use OoO aura reading for 60 seconds, they can still use it to track you like a no cooldown premonition.
---
I mean, people will always want to gloat on social media, it's just the nature of the beast.
---
Adam only has three outfits that are not recolors of his trench coat, it's honestly a crime.
---
And one of his only head pieces, just increases his flat top a few inches, you can barely notice it.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat my dude. I enjoy the green/yellow ranks more but I always wonder if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm able to pull off the loops more and there isn‚Äôt so much of a learning curve.
---
I've seen it 4 times in the past week including a few hours ago today lol.  I commented on it earlier.  But yeah even this week aside it is a greatest hit and something I've seen mentioned on here numerous times.
---
I just don‚Äôt like the game at higher ranks, I don‚Äôt belong there and I don‚Äôt want to be there, I can barley loop the safest pallets in the game
---
I wanna see someone 4k exclusively downing people after theyve been exposed by iron maiden.
---
Gen speed is absolutely fine üòÇ
---
Well, she did get nerfed
---
Took them long enough to implement the punishment for something it's never been ok to do.
---
She‚Äôs really fun to play though
---
Basically the original writer of the first Friday the 13th script or w/e sued the company that was holding the rights to Jason and the franchise.  As a result, Illfonic had to freeze development of the game so they wouldn't get caught up in the lawsuit.
---
A solid 3-4 steps away. Probably what caused it but a stupid flaw nonetheless
---
I started using the built-in target reticule on my monitor. Not for learning Huntress but just to play vs Ghostface.
---
God help anyone who believes this
---
A little bit to much but eehh better than nothing
---
The speed buffs are nice and all but they took away some of the only perks that work well on him and gutted most of his addons and mending time, getting a kill at rank 1 doesn't prove anything.
---
She is still top tier so that clearly wasn‚Äôt enough.
---
why BBQ in a slug build?
---
THROW ANOTHER ~~ROCK~~ PALLET
---
the problem is that gen speed is fucking terrible at low ranks, but if you get the dream team at high ranks they just pop at once through ruin
---
It's perfectly balanced
---
Granted med kit charge add-ons are broken at the moment, a medkit with 32 charges and adrenaline is all you need for 3 quick heals throughout the game, countering sloppy butcher and nurses calling to some extent too. Self caring against sloppy butcher is 40 seconds, or half an entire gen. A med kit with speed add-ons can cut that down to half. Self care can cost you the game. A med kit could win you it.
---
Platform: Ps4 
---
Description: It‚Äôs not a bug but can you please increase the maximum sensitivity for survivor and killer
---
This is fucking hilarious, the timing
---
I actually had this happen about an hour ago. A Nancy brought a flashlight into the game. Used it all match and still had it at the end. 
---
Managed to get to the hatch just a split second before it could open . (She was waiting nearby) she was clicking the flashlight at me when she saw me coming, I managed to body block it and close it before she could jump in. She turned her back to me and then opened it up with a key. 
---
There was the sound of hatch closing, it triggered EGC, and then her opening it also made the usual hatch open sound when a survivor uses a key. I was thoroughly confused.
---
He's not, you and most of Reddit just like to circlejerk for karma over it.
---
Doesn't sound like Umbra to me.
---
That ace was a toxic asshole to be fair. Spam clicking flashlights is different then getting aggro. Him always being on top of tru3 too try and get saves and simply be annoying. He was toxic, though I agree that one key is a bit much too say OP. Multiple keys? Sure but one isn‚Äôt that bad unless they are all on top of each other.
---
I know it wouldn't make sense film lore wise, but I'd love to see a Billy (like the mascot puppet) mask for her.
---
Yeah me too, it's my favorite perk to use because instead of finding cover to heal, you just run away and make space between the killer and yourself.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e7kypj/camera_glitch_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
His only condition was downing him, hitting anyone else gives everyone time to escape to the building with healthy bodyblocking the  only entrance. Unless he had full STBFL stacks no matter what everyone escaped there. He should of just forced you guys on the grass side and looked at you till timer expired instead of looping
---
I‚Äôd purchase Laurie and then go for the perks Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and Bond
---
Let me know bruh
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-
---
Why aren‚Äôt there more posts asking for more gamemodes and different objectives
---
probably bc there are more killers on currently
---
Nah self care is garbage and wastes time. I would absolutely not recommend running it. At this point it‚Äôs basically a 5th killer perk.
---
To be fair I had no idea it buffed her until I got reamed by my mate about it
---
When you‚Äôre playing her it‚Äôs fun but for the survivors it‚Äôs so little fun playing against.
---
Ghostface, michael, oni etc...
---
that's why I usually hit a survivor immediately after I hook them, just to avoid having my ear blown out
---
Yuup. Done it twice, didn't get progress either of them. The challenges seem to be really fickle with when they want to give progress and not.
---
Not OP at all you can hear what direction he‚Äôs coming from when he walks, and he‚Äôs giant so it‚Äôs almost impossible to mindgame. The only way for him to get his power is if you‚Äôre bleeding so heal as soon as you can.
---
Only until you're charged, he certainly discourages abandoning a chase since you don't want blood sitting everywhere but his ability to down from healthy is pointless when someone is injured and bleeding.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I really don‚Äôt mind going against her.
---
well this post basically is it
---
i think
---
on the first day of christmas this sub gave to me
---
a naked decapitated young girl
---
(i know this sucks)
---
Also he really hates Botany Knowledge for some reason.
---
Keep it up
---
If you absolutely had to choose between those two, get plague. Console oni sucks from the word on the street, and plague does too since aiming is sus but you don't really have to be perfect like huntress axes.
---
Her perks are overall viable too.
---
I honestly don't understand how much worse Oni is on console bc I doubt M&amp;K has more turning while using the power but I would say vommy Mommy if that is the case
---
Survivor: *DC's with that as their name*
---
Killer: Well, I expected that...
---
It‚Äôs not even an interesting idea, and is so unfun to play as, so weak yet so boring to play against.
---
There‚Äôd be so many issues.
---
The survivors would have to see a copy of a player‚Äôs characters and cosmetics which is weird. You‚Äôd have to either slow to 100% and fail to catch a survivor, or move 115 and give it up instantly. SWF and comms would give it away immediately, as would any teammate aura perks.
---
Would you do a face forward ? I‚Äôd like to see that ! Awesome art btw
---
I think rank 1 posts are ok cause it takes work, if it‚Äôs killer you could explain your main and how you used them,  same with survivor
---
True. Guess i gotta git gud lol
---
yep makes sense
---
Who hurt you?
---
Spirit makes the game exciting for me. Thinking outside the box.
---
Identity v is full of children it‚Äôs worse than dbd I had no interest in ranking in idv though
---
Gotta disagree. That ace was super toxic and tru3 had every right too shit talk them and be salty. If he salty if I had too deal with a survivor like that. 
---
You don‚Äôt have too sit there and clickclickclick until the killer gets so annoyed they chase you. That‚Äôs not aggro and being better, that‚Äôs being toxic and trying too ruin the killers day.
---
That fucking sucks. From what I know DBD is horrendous on every PS4, even the PS4 Pro, but it seems like it decided to eat your PS4s ass
---
We actually out here asking for sloppy butcher nerfs now? Is this what the game has come to?
---
Believe it or not for some reason I'm doing better with Legion's faster running doors than before the patch..
---
It's in the rules
---
The moment a survivor tbags you have a free pass to camp
---
Tbh I‚Äôm also loosing, and I never complained about DS or smth. I‚Äôm just trying to show a build to some people that are new with oni just because I started playing it sooner or I‚Äôm just more experienced then people that are looking for advice. Not here for complaining.
---
Yeah this is the only game that does it too
---
It‚Äôs okay if you‚Äôre starting out though which it seems like OP is. I don‚Äôt run it personally but when I first started I did quite a lot.
---
People mostly dc as a way of saying "screw you" to the killer and taking away theyr points, and to give the hatch, neither of which happens if you kill yourself on the hook so yes dc penalties will have a positive impact
---
that was clearly a heated gamer moment which justified anything that can be said (and seriously you downvoted me over what was clearly a joke post? dude relax)
---
Big yikes that‚Äôs how you think, my dude.
---
It is good, shush had a good idea  to be honest I love the idea of the main character being a deaf mute but I feel like the movie losing suspense one you know who under the mask and I don‚Äôt know it not my cup of tea but I‚Äôm not a movie critic
---
nice
---
Probably
---
Possibly a bug? If it's on pc it might be a cheater. Console? Most likely a bug.
---
just get better bro
---
Probably a cheater. They are very rare but not extinct.
---
When I turn my camera it go's really slow
---
I didn't hit that downvote my friend, I only downvote people who spout actual harassment lol
---
A cheater. Sorry mobile was being dumb.
---
Then I'll say my preemptive, click the huge ass touchpad
---
It looks like when you got blinded it canceled your power but didn't give you the cool down afterwards? Very strange interaction for sure
---
Everyother killer: \*Is Either to strong or weak\*
---
Leatherface: \*BALANCED\*
---
Also survivors using a new moon and 3 mist offerings pretty much made finding a p3 Claudette impossible.  Remember this is before they updated her p3 outfit to be a little bit brighter.
---
Death garden gives the survivor/scavenger side way more mobility and camera view than those of dbd, you can outmaneuver the killers in a much more enjoyable way. The hunters in this game need a lot of time sunk into them in order to use them properly, unlike those from dbd.

well i didnt play when BBQ event was on and i think thats is the one where eg billy's hammer comes from so shouldnt i get it? What i understand is that as long as i had no way of participating, i should get it right?
---
Depends on what you are talking about. From what I have seen, it seems like at lower ranks everyone wants to be the killer, so que times are very long. That said, once you get to higher ranks people find out that running all the meta perks can make things very unpleasant for the killer if all the survivors take them and use them in an effective way. That means that as you go up in ranks there are less and less people who actually want to play killer. That means that que times get shorter and shorter.
---
Or, all survivors are bad meme
---
They made it so you had to participate to get it since they aren't giving it out unless you earned it.
---
Made me laugh, thanks for brightening my evening
---
had one similar game just a few moments ago. 4 swf sabotagin serveral hooks swarming and bodyblocking annoying with flashlights. so quite annoying. got one in the basement so they started swarming i got a few and killed everyone except one hatch was close so i closed it. so he sabo every hook and hid in a corner so i couldnt sac him.
---
Playing solo survivor lately is just getting harder with time. Rank reset nerfs so you stay around a rank level where you can still get rank 15/16 teammates but get rank 10 and under Killers. "Bug fix" for the lobby so you can't see teammates rank anymore. 5 minute survivor queues (though that isn't limited to solo). Praying the killer doesn't play like a shithead, praying my randoms aren't useless immersed shitheads, praying the game decides to work properly (and start instead of having someone crash in loading), etc. 
---
Solo Survivor is a 1v4v1 venture, its you vs the killer and your team vs the game itself.
---
I haven‚Äôt been in his streams a lot but I‚Äôve went against him in the past. I was running Dead Hard against his Ghostface and made a few plays which he complimented, only to then take back saying that he wasn‚Äôt using his build. While it may have been tru3, it just made him seem quite obnoxious as my first experience with him, furthermore putting me against the idea of visiting his streams.
---
It's just, if you ask anyone on this reddit why they do something the answer is ALWAYS the same. Don't question me, I'm rank 1 and super good, and if you ask for proof they call you toxic or smt
---
Not that I agree with him entirely, but DS and DH are not overpowered perks. Dead Hard becomes predictable and DS is barely a nuisance unless you're playing a 4 man SWF. Then again, everything can become a nuisance when you're playing a 4 man SWF.
---
Ah yes, he can get an easy first stab on you, then again, then again, then again and oh wait they're gone because their power is fucking useless
---
You can justify various orders for this list based on personal preference but here is the perks to headhunt.
---
David - Dead Hard, WGLF (don't farm brah still give them good unhooks)
---
Meg - Adrenaline, Quick &amp; Quiet
---
Jake - Iron Will
---
Bill - Borrowed Time, Unbreakable
---
Dwight - Bond, Prove Thyself
---
Adam - Deliverance
---
Jane - Head On
---
Claudette -  JUST SAY NO TO SELF CARE.  IT'S HOT GARBAGE ON A HUMID SUMMER DAY.  Empathy's cool though.
---
ya the thing is, playing with strangers, you just never know what they‚Äôre thinking so it‚Äôs hard to co-ordinate and assume that they will NOT cleanse recklessly, but that is usually the chase ! e.g. a survivor cleanses near the plague but then they decide to immediately unhook the sick survivor... :S
---
What's the value proposition on getting downed to give your teammate time to struggle? It seems like it's low...
---
You may get some ideas from this game.  [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/249505/nyctophobia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/249505/nyctophobia)
---
There's some wholesome ones I could recommend for sure
---
Rank Reset is 6 days.
---
Pretty sure you're in the minority.
---
This is why I'm complaining, either way you lose points
---
As a Bubba main, I totally agree. There are a few simple things that would make him more viable:
---
* Make the Beast's Marks speed buff his base chainsaw speed.
---
* Fix the acceleration addons to actually make a visible difference.
---
* Shorten the tantrum by 25%.
---
Now, they said they'll be giving all the killers the same number of each type of addon, and Billy and Bubba will be included. So, seeing as Iridescent addons should change the core gameplay dramatically, here are a few suggestions:
---
* Double the duration of the chainsaw charge, but increase the charge time significantly.
---
* Whenever a Survivor is downed by the chainsaw, reset the duration.
---
* Cause all nearby Survivors to scream when triggering a tantrum.
---
Both games play very similarly. Survivors complete an objective and run away from the killer. Survivor feels VERY satisfying in Deathgardeb, running around and climbing everything is really fun, and you feel super agile. Playing killer on deathgarden is frustrating though, mainly because of the way that you're still in a first person perspective. Unless you happen to be playing a killer who has a shotgun, survivors can run up around you, and you'll be spinning in circles like an idiot while they spin around you. There's no dragging attacks like in dbd. 
---
Dbd just feels like a much more polished game if I had to summarize.
---
Like how we had a post eairler saying the Oni breaks the game... seems like Yamaoka enjoying fucking over survivors.
---
 I tested in kyf and it worked again
---
Spaghetti Code. BHVR Pls.
---
That would be cool! I don't even mind if they have inappropriate humor, just don't care for toxicity. I've seen true, didn't care for him, and pug.
---
Also 4k don't mean anything, you don't pip with a 4k... Bloody useless balance, suvivors don't need to do 3 Gens and escape for a pip, why must the killer do worst to win?
---
Or all killers are bad meme.  Double the cringe level for both if it isn't a shitpost and they legit despise the other side with a biased fury that rivals the might of the Norse Gods themselves.
---
Dead hard is a great perk, you need high skill to use it at its full potential, but it's also a "press E to dodge everything, even your mom" and yeah idk how to feel about that. DS, you eather eat it and feel the consequences, or slug, and 5he guy then gets picked up, each survivor has the chance of using it twice in a match, and so we want to talk about the shitheads go for the rescue as sson as they're unhooked, and as they hear or see you approaching they hump the fucking locker, nah mate that doesn't feel right. Ah and last thing, people who get saved with BT and charge at the killer like a fucking bull because if they don't get something out of the unsafe unhook in front of the killer it doesn't feel right, like you should at least try to be scared of me.

I‚Äôve asked the spirit and noed questions. The unique survivor shit is stupid I hate that idea the killer idea is bad.
---
I mainly said "my exclusives REEEE" because of Umbra. She has a "days without a complaint about dbd" counter, the exclusives being given away made her complain a substantial amount of times an hour about her precious hound mask and she never reset the counter. No offense to the people who actually didn't want the event exclusives to be given away free.
---
Fair. I was just making a stupid joke. "Spaghetti Code" is an expression for a game that is badly programed, so it has lots of janky interactions and corner case scenarios that wouldn't be obvious. "BHVR Pls" comes from League of Legends, which is made by a studio called "Riot Games". "Riot Pls" is a very common expression that people say when something strange or unexpected happens. If you haven't played League then I could see how my post is hard to understand. I tend to take niche jokes and say them like I expect everyone is familiar with them.
---
I just do for the first time the other day because a killer slugged me as the last one alive and wouldn't even consider hooking me and I wasn't going to allow him to close hatch if he wanted to play that way.
---
Fuck that. It was unfair, just a free de-pip if you where trying to rank up, as killer you got less blood points and straight up unfun. Before anyone tries to make the argument that as killer at least you got some, yes some blood points is better than none but in the same time you could get into another match, make more and wouldn‚Äôt be unfair for the survivor.
---
why was it removed anyway? was that killer main streamer who complains about everything on about it or something?
---
It's almost as if you want to be competitive, you need to use the most viable thing to do so. Who would have thought, certainly not me.
---
killer mains will make posts like this and when they have to give a real recap of the game it's them tunneling a single person for five gens
---
Bubba works well if you use good add-ons and PWYF every game. Problem is he shouldn't be balanced around that.
---
That nerdlaugh was obnoxious as Hell. Very nice clip nevertheless
---
Thats exactly the same complaint, it makes me so mad i want to go back and argue from this comment from like years ago
---
"oh, so when my mom calls me or I have to go im goinna get punished?"
---
If your mom is calling you over and over and you cant complete a single game...yeah, maybe dont play for a while. Nobody wants to play with you
---
Then they hit u with the ‚Äúoh I was gonna let you leave‚Äù
---
Literally just had a game like that.
---
Had a baby steve who kept running into me and other objects, he was very bad at stealth and even worse at looping. I let him on the ground 2 times because I felt bad and wanted to give him an extra chance. He still died first.
---
In post-game chat he called me a tunnler, insulted my mother and told me to kill myself &amp; that I deserve to die.
---
gg
---
Tried it's not that
---
No, you would have to say much meaner stuff than that for PlayStation to ban you. Like cursing and using extremely profane language
---
at this point 4ks are so common it's not even really considered a feat anymore unless you're new to the game
---
Dead Hard has a high skill ceiling for sure. Very good survivors are not going to use it to dodge a hit oftentimes. They're going to use it in order to give them just enough room for that vault or pallet.
---
In my return to red ranks as killer after taking a break from this game, I've only faced a handful of people that use it this way. The rest just seem to look back at you constantly while being chased &amp; injured and at that point you bait the DH when you get close to them.
---
The only time where DS does become annoying to me is when I'm snowballing against a SWF and I'm hooking left and right. Other than that I think it's in a good state, along with BT, in solo survivor gameplay and even in a 2-man SWF. But with a 4 man SWF everything tends to get annoying because they're on voice comms and they coordinate their every move and their cheesy strats. This is the only time that I play sweaty AF as killer otherwise I pretty much have my ass handed to me.
---
taking aggro isn't toxic though...I can understand if Ace teabagged at every pallet and trash talked Tru3 in end game chat, but he didn't do that.
---
Tru3 was complaining that he was facing a decent survivor, and if the whole team was decent he probably would've lost, I'm sure he would've had an excuse lined up and ready for why he lost too like he usually does.
---
Legion should be on both pictures
---
Oh alright i get it now thanks for explaining I don‚Äôt play PC games that‚Äôs why
---
I'm pretty sure we'll see Oni far more than Clown, Plague, Legion and Demogorgon. Unless they really shit on him with nerfs.
---
He literally has said that Otz is a decent guy, and told peeps watching the stream to leave him alone when they got to complaining.
---
PSN is fine, on XBOX LIVE I told someone to go commit scooter ankle and I got banned
---
It looks like a recticle
---
It means nothing if we dont know how people see or move
---
You got outperked. But in all honesty, that's terrible.
---
Good Ghostface players will mostly cover themselves and make it impossible to reveal them. It comes to a point mid chase where you have to decide between giving a free hit or let him expose you.
---
What's scooter ankle?  O.o
---
CHANGES TO EVENT COSMETICS UNLOCK
---
In the latest Dev Update, we announced our plan to unlock a large list of exclusive cosmetics to all players on PC and console. According to the feedback we received, we decided to review the unlocking process for the following cosmetics:
---
Hound (The Huntress ‚Äì Event Mask)
---
Untamed Donkey Jacket (David King ‚Äì Event Body)
---
Pro-Pain Hammer (The Hillbilly ‚Äì Event Weapon)
---
Free Song Bird Slip Dress (Kate Denson ‚Äì Event Body)
---
As it was mentioned by many players, these cosmetics were earned during events and were representative of the player's dedication to the game. The way these cosmetics were stored created an issue where a loss of progress was possible, we've since switched to a more secure method of storage for event cosmetics. 
---
At the time of the announcement, last month, we had no way to isolate players who had earned these cosmetics. Since then, we have found a way to isolate the players that have played the event and will be able to restore these four cosmetics on a large scale, only to players that earned them during the events. Keep an eye on the news, this will happen Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Oh sorry that was confusing, I meant when hes in his power and gets blinded it switches to his basic attack just like this footage
---
I think it‚Äôs fine cause they could tunnel me and I loop them for  another few minutes but it‚Äôs bullshit that it stays active even if another survivor got hooked and you aren‚Äôt downed. Like if gotten someone unhooked and I go across the map with BBQ and down them and hook them and go back to the original guy and down him and he hits me with a DS, that isn‚Äôt ok
---
IT MEANS DEATH, A SLOW AND PAINFUL DEATH
---
She is a crutch and you definitely don‚Äôt need her to be viable
---
Oh...
---
Just google it
---
I'm on console, do I have to be in a demon dash in order to break pallets that quickly with Oni by just pressing R2?
---
Ive been maining legion this whole time but I dont think they‚Äôre useless at all but hey if people complain enough im not opposed to a buff lol
---
Well I think the dumbest thing we've seen this day is this post ... XD
---
That was amazing
---
Wow. Feels bad man. I mean, his profile picture is from HAZE, so that should tell you something right there.
---
I mean he isn‚Äôt wrong about Reddit being like that
---
Im high ranks too bruh and self care isint as bad as u think
---
I mean the exact same can be said for the killer. Hes got to play basically  a full game yet hes forced to dc because someone wants to be a selfish twat and hold him hostage? I'm not saying that if a survivor gets caught in that bug it's their fault and they should be punished. I'm saying it's on them to suck it up and take the dc.
---
Not a good analogy. Tier 3 myers not only insta downs, he has a longer lunge and fast window vaulting. As a plague player, I want survivors to cleanse.
---
well cool then i got david's jacket for free, suits my moro pants soooo good
---
As I've said, if you don't get chased, you never have to worry about it. Same applies with huntress, if you're in an animation, you can't avoid her hatchets.
---
Imagine hitting it and having it not count for zero reason.  
---
That happened to me last time I used it.
---
I mean, you made a statement of fact. If someone bans you for that then that would be absurd.
---
And yet I don't see people complaining about huntress. Double Standard much?
---
I just seen this right after playing Legion. The pins at least work better now.
---
I saw Scott jund go on a 30 plus win streak as speed limiter bubba, he needs a nerf honestly. Too op. &gt;:(
---
No the optimization on console is just poor as is. Some maps have worse frame drops than others such as corn maps. Nothing you can really do except hope they eventually optimize the console performance to be better.
---
Interesting, yeah that seems like some intense pressure, cool!
---
It's amazing how many survivor mains hate tru3 lol. Like, it makes me giggle so hard.
---
He plays random ass builds day after day, and still manages to pull out mostly wins.
---
He will say when people -whether their his teammate or not -are good players, he admits when he messed something up, and he explains what he's doing as he's doing it.
---
But because he says gen speeds need to be changed, and he won't give yall hatch, that he's an asshole.
---
He calls out toxic behavior, on both sides when he sees it, but because he didn't bow down to the DC'ers who got Spirit nerfed, he's a hypocrite.
---
Because he says that survivor mains set the tone, pace, and win viability of the game, he's a douchebag.
---
Like, the amount of hate and shade yall throw at him is almost cute. Especially when peeps start claiming that no one likes him. Cuz for a guy no one likes... yall sure do spend an awful lot of time bitching about him.
---
People always cleanse when I play Plague, I still get looped they dodge and everything, except when matchmaking is totally perfect, give me a rank 10 a rank 20 thennn
---
Yea my fav killer so far.
---
Even when i'm a survivor i'm terrified of pink bob Neas. I own the cosmetic and i'm still scared of them
---
Exactly dude full of Kpop stans and weebs, not saying they‚Äôre all bad people but kids jesus christ
---
He needs a jesus robe!
---
Correct.
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: Kicking a gen from the push bar side causes you to get glitched and stuck in the gen itself
---
Steps to reproduce: Known Gens: Badham front of school gen beside garbage dumpster, damage generator ends with killer stuck in the gen itself, unable to move but can still grab others and lunge. Grabbing a survivor fixes the problem.  
---
Expected: I don't get stuck in the gen
---
Actual: I got stuck in the gen  
---
Reproduction: Twice from same side
---
More tiddy?
---
I swear to God-
---
This isn't a shitpost or a picture of Otzdarva so I am contractually obligated by this subreddit to downvote and report you, sorry.
---
there's a lot of newer players trying to just get bloodpoints as quick as possible to get a P3 or something. it's not always about bloodpoints though, these challenges are pretty ridiculous, I'm surprised there aren't more farmers. if it's really that big of a deal, I suggest doing exactly what you did. killing yourself on the hook or dc'ing.
---
What happened with Wraith's and Spirit's powers?
---
Cause it's more reliable then ruin, I quit using ruin months ago. And lets face it when motherfuckers get cocky with gates open noed ends that bs and you either get your 4k or close to it.
---
Any rarely played Survivors but in P3. For example P3 Quentin‚Äôs, Ace‚Äôs or Adam‚Äôs.
---
Nah this one guy thought camping was patrolling a hooked survivor even when I was walking half way across the map.
---
I see those occasionally but they aren't too common on here.
---
I think most of us are still holding out hope that they'll eventually get this first one right.
---
I don't know, I feel like he could be a standalone killer with emphasis on terrorizing your obsession with stealth and debuffs.
---
i agree, fuck spirits.
---
but god you really just sound like you complain about every top tier
---
being flashlighted can take you out of frenzy I've gotten so many lucky double hits because of it
---
Still can‚Äôt agree mate. Mass clicking the flashlight until the killer gets so annoyed they focus you is not taking aggro. It‚Äôs being a toxic dick. You can take aggro without having too be toxic about it.
---
I love it
---
Summer lul
---
Poor Bubba üò•
---
I‚Äôm crying with laughter, wtf.
---
just wanna say your videos are super helpful even if I have a thousand hours already
---
U talking like the old pins were any good
---
the speed curve on their reappearance is broken and fails to activate meaning that they lack the ability to lunge out of their uncloaks making Wraith literally feel like a killer without a power and spirit feel slightly more fair to play against.
---
Watch her stream then
---
I'm pretty indifferent to it.  Doesn't typically bother me when they post those.  The only time I ever find them annoying is when they post the 4K Brag Post and it was like a Prayer Beads, NOED Spirit or something.  It's like dude....how is that a post?
---
Survivor bad is 10x more common
---
ok go cry
---
The new survivor makes my headset crackle when she gets hooked
---
Nobody asked.
---
Its robot santa
---
I've had games were I've done 3 dull totems + heard the ruin pop. That should be fine, right? ONE of my three teammates must have done the last totem, right?
---
NOPE. I still get hit by NOED. Great.
---
It really isn't.
---
I see you everywhere, you are a shit killer main who sucks at the game gtfo
---
The spirit's nerf made her speed bonus weaker, but now it just doesn't activate lol
---
You‚Äôre just as good at falling for bait as you are loosing against a spirit.
---
Disagree on that lol. Go visit the dbd forums.
---
no it sounds like you just don't like farmers. there's already a solution to it, just die on hook. it won't kill you (literally) to just go for the bloodpoints/challenge either. you sound like a little bitch.
---
Now it's more used for finding suvivors and injuring a bunch in 1 frenzy
---
The common thing people ask for is 2v8.
---
I haven't seen it before either, although I kind of think it makes sense to give survivors something besides teachable perks and add more variance to games.
---
Obviously if this were to ever happen Claudette's bonus would just be "Blendette"
---
it's good!!
---
Wow, i just did it because everyone did it
---
&gt;Sexist homophobe transphobic bigot
---
Ah, Reddit will never change
---
Banana Hammock Ace (happy trail NOT optional)
---
Speedo Quentin (movie accurate!)
---
Dwight in full lingerie and corset (finally coming out of the ~~closet~~ locker)
---
You're better off not knowing. Trust me.
---
Had a game where a guy "Looped me the entire game" and i gave hatch to someone else, the salt was unreal
---
Thanks ^ ^ !
---
But.. that's like.. fucking mean.
---
I must say you have..cough good taste,
---
Very nice art aswell
---
they must be dumb to be complaining even after getting out.
---
not really, you still get bloodpoints
---
And as someone who mains a slower killer, I'd be pissed getting matched against whoever had the +speed attribute.
---
very good
---
I mean yea, she is broken in a shit ton of ways, but state that at first.
---
People only like her bc they cling onto any top tier they can get, and she is so easy to play people just pretend she has counters, when litterally the person used in a lot of arguments saying she is balanced, tru3, is just wrong in so many ways
---
DS is now only active for max. 60 seconds after being unhooked - getting picked up 61 seconds after being unhooked? Tough luck. 
---
Also DS skill check happens during the pick up animation so the killer cannot dribble you anymore.
---
Ptb kate anyone?
---
What‚Äôs wrong is you can‚Äôt loop while broken, and it sounds like you have a problem with your team cleansing not the plague, without her power she‚Äôs just an M1 killer who can be easily looped, blame your teammates for giving her her power, not the plague
---
and? I don't understand what you are implying.
---
what is it with ormond and demo, everytime I play demo I get this map lol
---
Bill or I‚Äôm not interested
---
What about the fact that survivors‚Äô footsteps are waaaaaay more quiet than before ?
---
Mad Grit Mad Grit Mad Grit!
---
Also /r/infectiouslaughter
---
love itüíñ
---
He brought the offering lol
---
^is ^it ^bad ^im ^happy ^about ^this
---
you stated she‚Äôd no longer be pig, but would it matter if she didn‚Äôt have a mask, she‚Äôd just be the pig with a different skin, just like how clown has a santa skin.
---
Then he does that thing where he looks away and you think "oh he didn't see me" but then somehow he's inside your asshole, ready to sacrifice
---
Crowder isn't any of things he said but ash sure as shit is. Lol has this dude ever even watched ash vs evil? His entire character is a sexist, slightly racist, alcoholic asshole
---
As survivor: Frosty Eyes on any killer or Pumpkin Head Nurse.
---
As both: Period blood Feng
---
That's lovely! Streamers should support each other instead of trying to bring others down. :)
---
Which tv serie is this
---
Also o ly gets like 1 heal, rather bring a toolbox or flashlight.
---
1 survivor busy for less than double the time that 2 survivors would have been busy. Finding time plus healing, you'd rather I work on a gen, I'd rather you do.
---
The base value is still 1 though since it would be all 1 equation.
---
"And I love you, random citizen" ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yes I want this and also want some long locs hair outfit !
