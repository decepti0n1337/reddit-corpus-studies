There‚Äôs only one person here that‚Äôs pissed... and it‚Äôs not me mate. I‚Äôm really sorry things aren‚Äôt going so well for you Irl. You have quite a lot of hate and anger. And there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the result of random stranger on the internet about a video game.

Hopefully next year is better.

Lmao

My wraith is like level 15 right now and i don't even have a purple add on. Is the yellow bone clapper a good sub for the red add on?

Nice dude

Survivor: Borrowed Time and Botany Knowledge | Killer: Shadowborn and Hex: Devour Hope
---
Outstanding move!
---
One bad perk to balance out the good perks on there. Very nice.
---
Nope, actually.
---
If the survivors are dumb enough to turn a 0/1k into a 3k because they keep getting downed in the endgame, it's on them for being greedy and overly altruistic
---
god you're fun, aren't you? don't mention my real life because you can't think of an actual argument because you don't like how someone plays.
---
Alexa,
---
I don‚Äôt think BBQ needs to change.
---
&gt;Good perk
---
&gt;totem perk
---
Pick one
---
But like you said , other way around would be shit too or had been shit. Killer would dodge if they see swf or get bullied to dc because the survivor that play with low rank friends would bully them to DC.
---
I get both side but for you at least you can talk with your friends even if they get destroyed, the player who play killer had no one to talk to and get all the bad feeling alone
---
Is it ? I know the terror radius starts at 20 so you would start hearing the heart beat at 12 meters which could catch some people off guard because they'll just hear the lulluby and not be to cautious.
---
What does the hex do
---
Gotcha does sound better but I often think against it because of the humming she does would make survivors stop or something.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that this thing existed, omg. Will be using it for the memes lmao
---
This isn't even a bad Shrine. All these perks are usable and have value (Shadowborn having the least value) but man, I'm starting to realize I'll be waiting awhile for the few perks I want from the otherwise shitty pool of DLC survivor perks.
---
Just please give me Make Your Choice BHVR.
---
I mean you can also instantly cleanse every time and if your whole team does the same, you'll prob win cuz not many plagues know how to use their power efficiently. I don't do this often but it definitely works
---
They mean it‚Äôs in a good place and balanced. Not better use wise. Don‚Äôt pick up a survivor until a minute after he is unhooked. DS is then useless. But the stun is longer. I would like to see it become even stronger but more situational as an anti tunnel perk.
---
Yeah those survs just sucked major ass. Once the gates are powered theres no reason to die
---
I'm guessing shadow born ? It's not too bad on nurse or huntress let's you see a bit more to aim your blinks or hatches a bit more out .
---
You can also loop her around Short Loops/Walls and wait until you can bait a pallet hit, since that removes her Corrupt Purge and forced her to either get another or just chase you normally.
---
I was about so start leveling up Bill so I could get BT, I‚Äôm so HAPPY
---
I clicked this and the vote count went down 2. Guess I just seen some of the culprits in action

Pretty much
---
&gt;  Hex: Devour Hope
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Devour_Hope
---
its a stacking perk with multiple effects
---
haste/exposed/mori at 2/3/5 stacks
---
At Tier 3: 
---
2 tokens give you 5% Haste 10 seconds after hooking a survivor, for 10 seconds.
---
3 tokens give every survivor Exposed status (One Hit Down)
---
5 tokens let you kill the survivor without a hook.
---
Tokens are gained by survivors being unhooked when you're 24 or meters away.

It was there once, ever. And it still never shows up on my blood webs, I have it on like 3 killers.

It‚Äôs not NECESSARY for Spirit Fury, but is super useful.

I use it on Pig on its own just so it can help me delete Pallets faster

Spine chill, We‚Äôll make it and Bond for sure

Yes but the difference between having red and yellow is they don‚Äôt know where you are or when you appear
---
Is not a ghost
---
Most Survivors will hug corners/walls, so it‚Äôs easy to see when they snap into the dead-center to do a Vault/Pallet Slam.

Something can be nerfed and still be good

DS is one of those things. It *did* get nerfed, this is undeniable fact.

---
If she spreads out her vomit, it should cover the entire area though, unless you‚Äôre referring to ducking behind objects that cover the majority of the survivors body. Got a video to explain?
---
People deliberately derank on purpose so they can bully inexperienced players. There's a good chance you got into some games with a few of them. Without proper perks/addons and enough experience as killer it'll be very difficult to even kill one of the four survivors.
---
but not too horrible or you're whole team foes gens and there aren't enough left
---
Yeah, that's my case, but I can't do the crossplay between those platforms, my DBD is from the Microsoft store
---
I don't get why people say it's a reward for playing badly.
---
It's a momentum changing perk that is hilariously easily countered: either you cleanse all the dulls, cleanse the hex, or you stop dive bombing the hook.
---
If I see a teammate get downed immediately, I hide and search for the totem. Or, if I see that it'll be difficult (the killer is camping the hook), I generally just leave.
---
All NOED does is punish stupid survivors
---
Dont bother these dont get upvoted
---
The community would rather feed EA lite than actually have a good game
---
I got in 5 games in a row and I want to hang myself.
---
Who do I have to suck off in order for Ruin or Corrupt to appear
---
OMG THAT WAS ME!!! WE FOUND EACH OTHER AGAIN SKDKSKDKKS
---
Don't you feel like smashing it into pieces when facing scummy players over and over? I would.
---
Say sike right now!
---
It's only a thing if the killer swings in the same frame or if there is bad ping. Not a hitbox issue, just surv and killer having the same reaction speed
---
i got lucky and got it first try. had a group of survivors who hated people who dc
---
That's a good point, but I think you misunderstood my opinion, the crossplay is between steam (pc) and Xbox PC, both are from PC, so I think doing the crossplay won't be a problem
---
We don't have another ghost other than Wraith.
---
It‚Äôs because the slash can touch you while the pallet falls. It‚Äôs one of the few interactions in this game that actually has some sort of logic lol.
---
The speed you spin doesnt effect wiggle speed. As long as its moving you're fine
---
Honestly a pretty good shrine for both sides. Still waiting for MYC though...
---
After 3? Mine gets cleansed in the first minute of the match
---
Ya but honestly what are you gonna do with the killer right there? He's just gonna hit you and re-hook you
---
Im so annoyed its always a bunch of free character perks
---
Detective's hunch.
---
It rewards you for doing objectives by allowing you to easily get more points and negate NOED, literally no down side.
---
Make it average. A rank 8 killer would make more sense
---
Present
---
Right. Like just put it up. I refuse to buy Pig now that I have Surveillance, which I don't use anyway. And Hangman was just up.
---
 
---
Just give me her real perk.
---
I totally see your point, and of course would be unfair people with keyboard/mouse playing with controller players, the game would be very unbalanced. But in my post I'm talking about the crossplay between steam and Xbox PC (or Microsoft store) that are both from the PC and all the players that play on the Microsoft store uses keyboard/mouse
---
I was playing Billy.
---
I got a build centered around picking people up with thrilling tremors and pop. Helps speed up the process
---
Yeah, we can use the huntress for example, I played her on my PS4 and the aim of the axes are terrible! I'm pretty sure playing her with keyboard/mouse is way easier
---
Well if you gave me this and said it was a survivor I would instantly think Kate, so
---
Yeah I had to get those on farming games :/
---
Honestly a meh shrine. Shadowborn and botany are terrible, devour and borrowed are good but they belong to characters who have other great perks (ruin and unbrekable) so you still want to level those characters anyways.
---
The hyper speed I'd be moving in if it was the other way
---
Bill is good though, you can also get Unbreakable.
---
There are plenty of loops that she cant vomit over properly if looped correctly. But if you are just arriving to the loop I can see your point. You just need to get her near the loop which then makes it impossible to vomit on you unless you are minigames badly
---
Its more of a bitter murmur.
---
Huntress is one of the better killers to use it, because she gets value from the locker speed for reloading. But I don't think it's a perk she really needs to run.
---
Can you give me and example of a tile that she can‚Äôt vomit over? Nothing comes to mind.
---
What map did you play on friend?
---
Bbq is honestly overrated when it comes to winning games. It is only really good for high mobility killers like spirit billy nurse and freddy, but also for killers like huntress that can be deadly at long range.
---
If you play pig go for a hit and run tactic. You'll catch survivors by surprise and don't have to play their loop game. Run perks like sloppy butcher, nurse's calling, whispers, ruin and maybe im all ears.
---
Good Job.
---
Treatment Theatre.
---
While we are at it, killers stop skipping lobbies due to survivors having skins
---
It's actually been on the shrine twice this year, and once in it's release year, once about 2 months ago, and the other about 5 months ago.

Dude what are you even talking... her lullaby is not directional for a long time

I like iron maiden because Huntress is the only killer that gets consistent use out of it. Also it's super fun because no one ever expects it, so people trying to dodge my BBQ aura read get their location revealed anyway.
---
The moment they give survivors even more space to loop a killer more effectively is the moment I stop playing this game. Survivors can get away with so much shit in a chase and not be punished for it.
---
Yeah, but that means that I'll have to main the Hillbilly first, and i hate him
---
I am on laptop
---
OH MY GOD HI üò≠üò≠
---
Pig can be hard to get that lunge right and is hard with chases. I never could get the chainsaw working for Cannibal but I‚Äôve seen a lot do it well. 
---
If you‚Äôre having issues chasing people then Hag might help. Put traps all over near doorways and gens and any place that will be high traffic. Then be ready to hit the button as soon as it triggers. They will trip the trap then you teleport and swing. You can get an easy first hit without chasing. 
---
Once a trap is used place another one. Trapper is same idea, traps in high traffic areas and as long as you are kinda close by you can get them before they escape.
---
But once i hit them, they run away and I am lost
---
Why are his perks powers?
---
Noice üëåüèΩ
---
Yeah, my Piggy is at 30 right now and I might as well just finish getting her to 40. But I keep hoping that MYC will pop up and save me the time and BP.
---
woo Im so sorry. Major F for you, poor unfortunate soul
---
N o
---
Nah they definitely don't mean it's good and balanced.That guy mentioned Otz who, for example, thinks DS allows survivors to get away with stupid plays.
---
You can say that of every challenge though. Literally every single challenge in this 4th tome can technically be achieved in a single farming match each(minus repairing 10 generators) with no struggle at all.
---
That doesn't excuse the difficulty of them for people who try actually going for them through normal game play.
---
YES, this happened to be but with the repair 4 gens with dark sense. I wanted to die. (I don't play SWF)
---
Legion looking like sans right now
---
By chase, I meant looping
---
Whoops my bad, I was think by of discordance for some reason!
---
That is the funniest thing I‚Äôve ever seen on this game, I‚Äôm so doing this next time I get this map.
---
What‚Äôs worse is when I selected the challenge  and did it on my first try but had an archive bug that made the logo/challenge disappear on the right side of my screen after the match. So I never got credit for it. And then it took 5 more hours before I actually got it a second time.
---
Tell me about yesterday my god, when I played killer my Ruin got destroyed within the first minute every time, and then genrushed. Then I tried to play Survivor and got the laggiest killers with some questionable teammates for rank 2.
---
Anything with tall things like rocks, walls, etc.
---
 Not too much about any of the unseen characters besides Benedict. All we know about Vigo is that he k owe a lot about the Entity‚Äôs inner workings and has been able to ‚Äúbend the fog‚Äôs irrefragable rules,‚Äù the most notable invention of his being the hatch or ‚Äúblack lock‚Äù or whatever you want to call it. He‚Äôs also responsible for his jar of salty lips, and a lot of people are certain he‚Äôs the Alchemist, and is responsible for the Blighted Killers from numerous experiments and such.
---
I will correct myself on that then. The lullaby gets louder when she gets closer. Monitor is still not very useful on her.
---
Do you have anything you want to discuss or are you going to disregard everything I said with just that?
---
Did he go to high school with them? I thought he just lived in Ormond, and they were the first people to commission him.
---
Lmao I rather be injured and have dead hard at hand then be healed a health state and stay exhausted for the end game.
---
This comment was brought to you by *The Hope gang*
---
I'm away from home right now but wouldn't an easier way to do it be to have a team based build like prove thy self, better together, streetwise and  dark sense, then have as many people work on the same Gen as you?
---
I‚Äôm at red ranks. If you go in with bubba people just straight up dc.
---
For a laugh
---
Heck it dude I need that bloody Nea outfit
---
Mine refreshes at 11am
---
I mean it's all shit if I have it all.
---
I haven't been able to play the game in months, so I haven't done one yet
---
Ultimately yes. But while generators are in play, the killers goal is to prevent them from being completed
---
The Oni has always felt really clunky to play for me and after his recent nerf, it's almost impossible to actually get an insta down against good survivors. Plague is much better and more fun IMO.
---
If you're lucky you can get Enduring from the shrine. Also you could play survivor to get BP and use that to get the teachable.
---
Aw hell yeah
---
Stop wasting the killer's time
---
what killer does the logs hint for?
---
Survivor challenges: yes
---
Killer challenges: Need 8. I'm not even trying the 4 sacrifices in the basement.
---
I‚Äôd say they are both about B-C tier and they are both pretty fun to play as. As survivor I would rather play against an oni (if you care about survivors having fun). You should watch some gameplay and see which one you like better.
---
Finished the agitation one on my first try. Felt so good
---
a-a-a-aaaa....
---
Yeah don't care really about your 15 options to cheese the game. Sometimes you have to admit defeat. Keep it in this way. It wastes less time and it doesn't allow bad survivors a free escape
---
I thought they were going to punish DCers more? Clearly its not enough whatever they did.
---
I gave up on the "2 sacrifices after egc" challenge after the one time I completed it I got shat on by the survivors and I didnt even have the challenge selected. It is incomplete to this day.
---
Yea it sucks but I hate more the single pallet I think it's called, where it looks like an "E without the middle line" and has a pallet in the middle. I always get hit there because no matter how the killer moonwalks I can't see anything. If I'm injured I just drop it Immediately because it feels so much safer when it's down.
---
he doesn‚Äôt really need to save them. probably couldn‚Äôt burn them if he tried
---
Sloppy is not good on huntress. I can think of a lot of perks more worth the slot. Like whispers.  There's a reason most huntress players use Ruin, Whispers, BBQ, and Nurse's. Ruin - Early game. Huntress is slow and on some maps it might take you a minute just to get to the other side where they spawn. Whispers: again, she's slow. You don't have time to walk all the way to a gen if there's no one there. BBQ: Again, helps you know where to go and get some sick cross map shots if you know what you're doing. Nurse's: Healing hitboxes are the same size as if they're standing up and a bit wider. Someone healing behind a bush? Throw over the bush and you'll hit them. Behind a corner? Throw just on the outside of the corner, you'll hit them. 
---
Sloppy is useless since you shouldn't be M1'ing often, and monitor and abuse is completely meh since it doesn't affect the lullaby. Iron maiden is fun to run with her when paired with the gloves, but overall those 2 seconds saved reloading are nowhere near the value that something like Nurse's and whispers give you.
---
Happy chridmus
---
On loops you want to go as close to the wall or object as possible and watch the survivors feet. Don‚Äôt be afraid of pallets, if they drop one just break it and get back to chase. They‚Äôll leave scratch marks so as killer you should always be looking for those. If they lose you in a loop their scratch marks will give them away. 
---
And if it‚Äôs taking forever they‚Äôre probably in a safe loop that you can‚Äôt get through. If it takes longer than 30 seconds move on to another survivor.
---
The dc penalty ended around Thursday, so no.
---
Yes the skillcheck needs to get smaller and smaller the longer you are on the hook. And unnerving pressence needs to affect this as well
---
I think that anything that could break undropped pallets would be op as you could just destroy the most powerful pallets on the map without like shack pallet or any kind of really safe pallet; the cost for such a power would need to be so high that it would make the perk useless
---
I hope this never gets implemented. Shame on DBD if it does.
---
What about all the items and offerings us players have lost not just due to DC, but any time we get booted out of the game.
---
What about lag? I was in a game where the lobby ping was under 130. I get in the game, someone gets on hook and then some weird thing happens where the person is off the hook and on the floor. And then I hear the killer heartbeat with no killer around and the next thing I know I‚Äôm downed. This is on console.
---
Too many problems with this game to implement this. 
---
You can‚Äôt force people to stay committed to a game when other players farm, good around, act stupid, etc.
---
Cause DS is not powerful enough?
---
True
---
Unnerving Presence definitely shouldn't affect Struggling Skill Checks but the longer on Hook the smaller the Skill Check might be a good idea.
---
On PC she‚Äôs DLC.
---
Play with your food and nemesis is currently the strongest one from what I know
---
I would say Ussylis if you're only talking about survivor mains. I know a lot of killer mains who are amazing survivor players but that is until you see me in the conversation in a few months :P
---
They stay unlocked though, so you don't have to worry about being able to use them for other characters.
---
BHVR is Behavior Interactive, the developers of the game.
---
5 bucks
---
I tried it, it seems way too boring for me. I'm sticking to DBD, thank you very much
---
Merry Christmas to you too
---
And? It‚Äôs still paid DLC that some won‚Äôt want to buy just for one perk.
---
The entire reason I switched to PC is cause of PS4's terrible ToS. Love it here and never going back
---
I've had to go afk because just as the loading screen started I almost shit my pants. The survivors were confused and I ended up just memeing and farming when I got back cause I had already lost.
---
Don't worry, that's just the council, deciding your fate.
---
dude, I havent even started tome level 3...
---
level 2 is like half done I think
---
I just made it yesterday so I guess we will see how it goes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
As we say in the dark souls community git gud
---
Plague is probably stronger if you have a good map, but otherwise oni is better. I love plague and she has some broken overpowered addons and builds. Haven't played much oni as I didnt find him fun.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that monitor doesn‚Äôt affect the humming, so either way the humming is the same radius
---
I have mine at 33, but at this point we might as well just level her up. I‚Äôve been waiting so along for MYC so I can run it on my hag :,(
---
Yesss finally! I didn‚Äôt get a Christmas present so this will have to do.
---
Has this been the first time bt has appeared on the shrine? If it isn‚Äôt did consoles got bp? Since they had bt as a non character perk and could get it regularly in the bloodweb
---
I miss f13 :(
---
It was just a test. IMO the dc penalty was bad because if you want to die you can just kill yourself and some matches you can be held captive in so dcing is necessary (just letting you know that their is a downside to dc penalty).
---
You should consider investing in Ghostface if you like Wraith
---
All your perks can be taken from you as a survivor if the killer is good because you will be dead
---
I wouldn't mind The Krampus as a killer
---
Need advice! Gonna get some new characters. 
---
Ghostface or spirit? I‚Äôm leaning more towards Ghostface.
---
Kate or Nancy? I like Nancy‚Äôs perks more, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind having dance with me. Halp!
---
But how whispers precisely work? The closer I am to the a survivor, the louder the whispers are? Or is it just making the same noise intensity? Because this is what is making me mad about this perk.
---
Hundreds if hours yet you throw the race card, lol what a dumbass
---
If only this were true, I could actually finish tome 2 of the archives...
---
Git gud
---
**Small Game** Ruin is run in 90% of games, find that shit quick. Even if you know all the spots, its makes it very easy to scan the map quickly. Survivors have 16 perks each game, Killers have 4. Trading 1-for-1 is so much free value. 
---
When they dont have Ruin, it also counters Noed and all the other gimmick hex perks. 
---
If the killer doesnt have any hex perks... Oh well easy boldness and no ruin = EZ game.
---
not even close, i have played against pug over 20 times and he only beat me once, and that was bc he had a squad of insta heal spammers.
---
But if you cleanse you're creating map pressure since you know that Plag is going to be going to that shrine. If you're smart about it you should cleanse near a completed gen then head to the other side of the map.
---
That's not even that bad
---
Ok then don't farm and don't care about what other people say?
---
Before I even saw the video, and only saw the title, I pictured Ace saying that title
---
Thank you for validating my pointüòÅ
---
It's not a bad game though
---
I just got home and checked! YOU‚ÄôRE A SAINT
---
Well, you guys convinced me, even though I‚Äôm lazy af. I agree with you, and I think that Unbreakable is one the best perks in the game because of its impact. Damn, I wish they put two of Bill‚Äôs perks in the Shrine, just like they did with Ace‚Äôs last week
---
Mathieu: "ok, ok, hear me out. Dark elves.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pull the race card‚Äù lmao racism blinders are something else. I never said that‚Äôs why she gets tunneled, I just said it was interesting that the only black woman in the game gets so much hate. The fact that everyone got so defensive about it only proves my point.
---
P.S. I don‚Äôt do Christmas so stfu about it
---
Botany can save your life.
---

When there is a survivor within 32 meters (the perk being at tier 3) the perk lights up. So basically imagine a circle of 32 meters around you, when the perk is lit it mean someone is in that zone. Really useful on finding the first survivor fast and also in the 1v1 end game collapse. Pig has in addition to that the trick I described in the previous comment. Whispers makes you just more effective when looking for survivors because you know when they are around.
---
Devour hope on the shrine is a truly beautiful xmas gift
---
I did this challenge first try the other day. I was scared that people would d/c vs insidious leather face. It worked.
---
Hatch if I don't wiggle?
---
If you are a good rank 7 you will probably be fine trust me matchmaking can get much worse then that.
---
Bruh santa REALLY came through on this one. like borrowed time AND devour hope MMMMMM
---
As always, my dude!
---
I literally did insidious basement bubba and got it first try lmao
---
Except I didn‚Äôt? Lmao literally all I said was she‚Äôs black and gets a lot of hate and y‚Äôall went BUt WE‚ÄôRe nOT RaCIStS on me. How predictable
---
As it was before they changed it
---
Get ruin for 4th perk, otherwise the game might end too fast. Corrupt Intervention also works. You can also replace Mad Grit with something else, depending on rank (a lot of people don't really bother to bodyblock). Remember, they just have to die in the basement, not get hooked there. If you think the basement is too far and you won't make it, just hook them close enough and next time they will be closer to bring them there.
---
Remember to also, while in a chase, herd rhe survivors closer to the basement. Replacing Mad Grit with Brutal Strength might help with ending chases faster.
---
Deerstalker is also good if you plan on slugging alot (or do it with a killer that has an addon to see survivors aura like Pig or Wraith, Ghostface also works because you get a notification when they look at you even when downed)
---
Hope these tips help.
---
By god its an idea fuck off unless your not a kickass and will say something nice
---
Yes, depending on the situation no. Most of the time it's bad though
---
Heh they all had full 4 perks and higher ranks yet i still bambozled them good!
---
Why complain, you have a purple flashlight
---
Game is a really good map for survivors
---
Literally me with skill checks.
---
There's no issue here
---
My first 4k was as huntress against some rank 19-20's.
---
Well I'm sorry but I did it first try and I was pretty proud of myself sorry if I pissed you...
---
Look at all these people saying they would help. Where is this lot when I que? Last time I got trap bug, all 4 survicors surrounded me and started teabagging trying to flashlight stun me and take the game hostage till I was forced to dc. I was rabk 8. They were all rank 1 and 2.
---
It hurts more when you see the killer suddenly speed up
---
Sounds like an easier mode for survivors
---
Sarcasm?
---
Try hard
---
DA DA DA DADADADADADADA
---
Oni is much stronger and has more potential, though Plague isn't do bad either
---
I was hoping for bbq &amp; chilli for Christmas but I guess I‚Äôll take borrowed time anyway
---
It's actually a fun game.
---
It‚Äôs shadowborn
---
Yikes bro  delete this
---
yeah now he‚Äôll just go do that to four more people.
---
you sure showed him lol
---
When is the ds nerf coming
---
I mean i didnt say to kill yourself, if your response to negative comments in response to your dumbass post is that you want to kill yourself then you have some serious mental problems bud, you should go to a psychologists
---
Imagine trying to open a locker and ghostface is in there and closes it on you
---
Why thank you  XD
---
Indeed merry Christmas to all
---
F
---
Nice
---
Best gifts
---
I actually got it without anyone dc'ing and it still didn't count :(
---
Most skulls are symmetrical
---
Me and and my potato PC agree with this.
---
Then I'd say Fungoose is one of, if not, the best survivor player in the game. He's very tactical and underrated and not many people know about him but definitely check him out if you don't know him because he's a killer main but he's one of the best survivor players I've ever seen.
---
Noob3 and aaronplays are the best for me personally.
---
What's the point though? I just wait until I see one I think I can down quickly and chase after them. If there are multiple I'm not going to injure one and then stay at hook waiting for someone else. That's just being a dick for no good reason.
---
Sweaty just means that someone is playing very competitively in order to win.
---
I have the same problem but it going inverted. Always happens if I struggle to hard
---
It happens to the best of us
---
Crap thought ypu were talking about mike
---
Franklin's on hag and trap their items. Best tactic
---
so skilled
---
On the latest stream, they indicated they are going to focus on fixing matchmaking after they return to work from the holiday break.
---
GG even the dbd twitter acount found you're art great!
---
idENTITY
---
Lmao thanks for an extra DC idea, LO V E I T
---
Baby Dwights are more important sorry
---
Botany Knowledge, Borrowed Time, Devour Hope, Shadowborn
---
#FLOWER IS OP
---
that's why you should use it first, then enter the locker again for ds
---
Idk but im betting its claudette and nea
---
A little ???
---
The spinning has messed up my joystick though.
---
She shouldve kept running, it wouldnt have hit her. She panicked, made a mistake and gets to pay the consequences
---
Autodiadact
---
Ruin is a hex perk and it's the #1 most picked IN THE GAME
---
Not really, the game isn't balanced more for one or the other. Its just bullshit to get hit through a window vault when I'm 15 feet away. And I'm still keeping my views on pallet stun slugs lol. If i stun then he should be stunned without the hit. A lot of the bugs I've encountered have been killer sided. Like huntress axes hitting me through walls or corners. Or ghost face not being revealed when I'm staring right at him. The only bugs I've encountered survivor side was me being unhooked and i was floating in the air and couldn't do anything. The other being some weird dead hard bug i cant recreate where it gave me a infinite sprint boost until i touched a generator then it stopped. But of course these are all just my personal experiences.
---
Freddy would definitely fit the Ghost of Christmas Past, then.
---
Why is everyone trying to call out the edit when the post is flaired "shitpost/meme."
---
I‚Äôm kinda sad you didn‚Äôt piss on me
---
You didn't see anything.. lol I got it from a chest, I'm just item hunting for now. I ran out of items on bill
---
Probably why Phillip looks so annoyed, some creepy guy peaking around the corner taking pics of your quality time with your girlfriend
---
Not survivor/killer main but I think FunGoose is one of the best players in this game.
---
Great argument but not logical. Sujan has 15000 hours in dbd so you're saying whoever has the most hours is the best. Even people with a lot of hours can play well but usually don't try hard and thus aren't as good as someone focusing and playing seriously. 
---
In addition AngryPug has said himself that No0b3 is the best survivor in the game and I also agree. Pug is great but doesn't play very seriously
---
Well not necessarily. Teammates could not be doing gens and still get the bonus. If they wanna EARN it, maybe it should proc if you completed the equivalent of a gen (Just an example).
---
No way you down that man after that.  Hahahahaha!!! I would personally escort him to gens.  Then out the gate or down the hatch.  Hahahahaha!
---
"The game isn't really balanced  more for one or the other" do I need to explain that that statement completely doesn't make sense?
---
Anyway are you of the opinion that when you stun a killer you NEVER can get hit at the same time? Regardless of how for apart the killer and survivor are.
---
Very true.
---
I would have waited
---
They are absolutely terrible. Most unpolished looking thing I have ever seen, next to Freddy's little gimp hand on the title screen instead of his clawed glove. If they can mirror the Pig so her blade is on that side, they can mirror Freddyboi.
---
How are you sad?
---
I mean unless you're playing blood lodge or any other map with low walled loops...
---
I got a Myers to let me do gens and escape because I tbagged at hatch then pointed to a gen. He then let me touch his dick afterwards.
---
Id say fungoose is one of the best players all around. I dont think he‚Äôs a survivor main but he‚Äôs genuienly one of the best survivors ive seen. He‚Äôs very tactical and smart and really knows his stuff.
---
So like is Plague sitting in Clown's lap or...
---
That's not plag, she is only big tiddy
---
Ooooo ;}
---
If only Oni wasn't nerfed to the point I could actually land mallet strikes.
---
Sorry i didnt get back sooner but yeah this is sadly probably in the ballparj
---
Well yeah, it shuts down debates and it should be used for comments that aren't relavent.
---
Considering your rank, it‚Äôs nothing special but hey if your proud
---
That is correct.
---
Its only worth paying for now if you‚Äôve got far enough that you feel its worth paying for what you would have unlocked so far.
---
By that I mean if you‚Äôre level 55 and you bow buy the rift, you‚Äôll unlock everything in the premium track so far up to 55
---
But yeah, it ends in 2 weeks then pay again when next one starts
---
When you win while only using noed as billy
---
No, reddit has vote fuzzing.
---
Calm down jfc
---
Nah
---
Agreed
---
Unpopular opinion: I preferred dealing with old Dstrike as a killer because non -obsessions couldn't use it if I downed them under a hook.
---
Yup, its screwed 2 of my controllers
---
Nah he spitting straight facts right here
---
&lt;Insert jigsaw closing the basement saying "game over"&gt;
---
Your literally hurting yourself and your entire team regardless if u cleanse or not, cleanse so you dont go down in two hits, she still needs proper Los to hit you with red puke
---
Its #1 because its basically a requirement unless you're running a gimmick build
---
Also fun fact theres a bug that stops ruin from even working
---
Bruh the ranking though poor killer
---
This is what I tell my friend all the time but he doesn‚Äôt listen.
---
BHVR can‚Äôt just give buffs they also nerf one add on or something that was completely fine for no reason
---
What I'm trying to say is nor killers or survivors are over balanced or OP. But the bugs I've personally encountered have made the game feel more killer favored.
---
poor Pig, Oni and Legion
---
Never gamble. Lol
---
I played with aaronplays a few weeks back. He was fucking useless.
---
That is also true, reddit messes with upvotes and sub counts a lot.
---
Theres a few political sub reddits that reddit doesn't like but cant ban so they lower the count to make it look less popular
---
No one minute as in, the killer has 1 minute to use it after a hook action
---
I'm waiting for "Mori 4 survivors during the End Game Collapse without using the perk NOED...Must complete in a single trial"
---
I was myers and stand right in front of a claudette she thinked I wanted to team and just stand there and moved a little bit then I came to evil within 3 and killed him
---
I love the hunters in Identity V tbh. Some of them are very wacky and unique.
---
Oh... then thats a bit broken. That perk would literally be used to kill god loops right away lol.
---
I got it first try!
---
Except the one that would have been 4th disconnected as I picked them up.
---
No it used to give a killer who‚Äôs rank was the same as the person who hosted the lobby.
---
Oh ok thanks! 
---
I really just wanna buy Myers. Is that possible by gathering in game currency? If so, bout how many hours? My Bill is lvl 21 but my overall is like level 10, I believe
---
so this is why everyone is running agitation and iron grasp
---
If I see a killer going for it and he needs me I'll run to the basement and let him hook me. Idk if I die what's one game to make someones week.
---
There are many perks that reward good play as killer. BBQ, tremors, pop, and more.
---
I got this one today and I got it as GF but I wasn't running agitation so I almost didn't get it. I closed the hatch and this Dwight kept running away from the basement and getting downed and wiggling off on the stairs and running away. He finally let me down him inside the basement when the timer for the EGC had about 5 seconds left, but I managed to hook him before the timer ended so I got it.
---
I love autodidact. It sucks at first but after you stack it you basically heal instantly.
---
Survivors are evolving. They know every trick to guilt the killer into letting them live.
---
I agree with the Myers buff he got.
---
Back in the day he needed to stalk a whole day to get one tier 3, he only could injure people after tier 3, and you still could get cucked by DS.  
---
Twice. 
---
By the same survivor.
---
I feel personally attacked! Lol
---
Over balancing is a good thing right? You think the game is balanced is what I think is you are trying to say. You have to be 10 times the killer to get a 4k in this game. You can't afford to hook 12 times, there is just not enough time. If you chase a survivor for an entire game and they throw down pallets the moment they get to it, playing it as safely as possible they will outrun the clock 100% of the time.
---
Sad thing is, they're only gonna get worse.
---
Right? You'll get screwed by adrenaline if you over-chase one survivor instead of splitting focus and keeping survivors off gens. And you'll get screwed by NOED if you don't keep on top of the totems.
---
People need to relax in this game some dude said he was going to murder me after I beat him while I was playing legion lol
---
Forgot the /s my man
---
Damn thats the worst.
---
This would be better if it could render undropped pallets unusable for a period of time instead of destroying them.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Someone else experienced it aswell and recorded it, [https://youtu.be/kFZHVx8H39s?t=577](https://youtu.be/kFZHVx8H39s?t=577)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Looks like the survivor takes the spot of the killer (Looks like it has a max. 5 players on a lobby), the match starts and ends since there's no killer on it.
---
It would've been cooler if you could actually 5v1
---
he is prob less then 2 ranks away from red ranks, how is that bad?
---
Merry Christmas
---
She got hit through the pallet lmao, it was just lag
---
Happy cake day and Merry Christmas
---
...so it's a hex perk that's so good it's a requirement? Meaning hex perks can be good. Both Ruin and NOED are meta hexes.
---
/r/titlegore
---
Until they got sued...
---
Oh wow, this random post is definitely going to make those people stop.
---
&gt;Thank you for coming to my TED talk
---
ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ This just makes me want to DC against basement killers ~~more~~ again.
---
You know I felt this same way but wanted all the killers. I hated the Hag until I got to level 15 and just realized she's not to bad. She's not as good as say Freddy but she's got a decent play style and if you play her right she can make some nasty plays.
---
Very nice meme, Merry Christmas
---
This happened to me when i did the "hook your obsession 10 times" challenge
---
If it was the sacrifice 4 in the basement challenge id punch my monitor, luckily the obsession one made me learn to double check shit.
---
The reason you can‚Äôt find anything is because after you get lots of teachable perks there is nothing special about survivors unlike killer my suggestion for people with good beginner perks are Dwight,Meg and fing min

"Im better than the people I play against" -op
---
You have to work for it, that is one thing. I honestly don't know why you are defending the existance of god loops (being uncounterable loops or unmindgameable loops), they are unfun to use and to unfair to play against. Most god loops are windows though and I don't see you complaining how broken bambooxle is.
---
Love this pic
---
Just shouldnt have dropped it
---
There is double BP on the 2nd of January.
---
Merry Repost.
---
Can't you buy the hag with shards as well?
---
Why?
---
Also, 6 winter skins were released lol
---
Still doesn't change the fact that he shouldn't have hit her.
---
Fuck how long ago was this posted before me
---
They wouldn‚Äôt really be considered Master Challenges then
---
As a pig main it hurts my soul too
---
Not necessarily, there are plenty of other ways for a killer to catch up in a chase lol. Slugging through pallet stuns isn't the only way for killers to get ahead. There is bloodlust, mind games, perks, killer abilities, killer add-ons.
---
I mean you are not wrong, but instead of blaming the game. You can blame the play, there is risk in dropping pallets as you have to stop to do it. So you can't just drop pallets willy nilly and expect them to save your ass all the time
---
I don't think that hooking 4 people in a basement, or your team being potatoes and requiring you to complete 4 gens is a good indicator of a master challenge either.
---
I sure the piece of metal that scratched is more than bent now
---
Yeah if that does happen I just won't bother with them period and ignore the archives.
---
that you need to pay $10 each for
---
Itz a faze gamer dudeeeeeee
---
Merry Christmas to you too &lt;3
---
Use the killer you like and then spend the blood points on Billy, I used that to get BBQ on bubba
---
That is too much wear and tear for actual buttons.
---
They arent uncounterable or unmind gameable lol. They are just very good loops survivors use to stall the killer for a reasonable amount of time. The perk idea you have would be reasonable if the killer could only kill the pallet for a set amount of time. Maybe 40/50/60 seconds based on perk level.
---
Decisive strike is a one and done situation too though. I stopped running DS if I play survivor because if some dickhead wants to facecamp me or come back to hook immediately and go after me it just means they're getting me out of a boring ass game with a shitty killer faster.
---
It's on the list, as soon as Quentin's face gets reworked
---
The whole point of pallets is to keep the killer from hitting you, she was injured and used the pallet for it's purpose but instead due to clunky hit boxes, she got hit from 6 feet away.
---
Does the lullaby gets affected by distance? I know for a fact that direction doesn't affect it anymore
---
#BetterLoveStoryThanTwilight
---
You are filth on like any other and you disgust me you may never said son of a bitch!
---
you're on console and got it on some characters before they released bill(it was just a perk with no associated character before) when they released him on console they made his perks teachables so now you can have it sometimes without actually owning it
---
Just got Bill to level 30 this morning lmao. I'm just gonna level him up and get it rather than buy it. I'll get Unbreakable too which is nice
---
No.
---
I mean survivors are just reskins unlike for games like Apex legends and overwatch who actually have characters you can be maining.
---
That drawing is nuts
---
yes it‚Äôs possible just takes a little longer with in game id say it about 10 20 hours game time but that all depends in the player
---
&lt;3 they aren't all winners, but sometimes being aggressively nice in postgame chat will start the wholesome-train :) It doesn't always work, but when I do it it always makes me feel good, at least. And I think it makes the person telling me to uninstall look a little more silly when I am telling them GG and have a great night haha ;P
---
This explains it! Thank you!
---
You present very reasonable points and get downvoted for it. Nice.
---
I agree with pretty much everything you said. Bonded is limited by its range and doesn't give you as much useful info for the map as a whole. All it tells you is that someone is near, which is only useful if you team mates are keeping super hidden and immersed. Most of the time they should be doing stuff and it is easy enough to spot them with just that.
---
I really like Alert
---
Making it average doesn't make it fair.
---
i mean it's mobile. They are trying to entice people to play it there.
---
Same dude and they recently had botany in the shrine 2 weeks ago, they're basically putting in perks nobody likes, I wanna see dead hard in the shrine and like urban evasion
---
Pffft, Claudette and Wraith are obviously made for each other, I mean, they're both invisible and everything!
---
Calm Spirit
---
No, you didn't. Before Bill was added as a character, borrowed time was a general perk. When Bill got added it became a teachable.
---
I actually think the icy blue skins are badass
---
People who do this are garbage bags.
---
The dark sense one was ez boys
---
As a PS4 player, I find small game such an underrated perk. Most killers I‚Äôve come across run ruin and it is pretty hard to hit great skills checks on PS4, so I‚Äôm usually spending a little bit of time looking for ruin. It also comes in clutch now that a lot of people are playing trapper.
---
I don't think you know what a god loop is. Common examples are the god window in ironworks, suffocation pit and groaning storehouse. Killer shack and long wall jungle gym might also be added to this list. But what makes these tiles strong is the window not the pallet. I agree shack might as well be a tl wall without the pallet. Big fucking deal, survivors get like 8 of these OP tiles. If you get rid of the pallet in a tall wall jungle gym, the jungle gym is still powerfull.
---
Yes.
---
And let me ask if you're in any decent ranking. if your rank 20 I would imagine this challenge is very easy but the higher the rank you go the harder it gets to complete.
---
Was this the style back then?
---
It's literally one of the first things when you google "dead by daylight memes"
---
Bc I had lots of power ideas and no perk ideas lol
---
Pallets are there to keep distance from a killer, not to be garanteed safe when you are close to one. If that would be the case, survivor wouldnt involve any skill anymore
---
Im fully aware what they are lol, but they are counter-able. Its not easy to accomplish but it is possible. And you strike me as a killer main, the life of survivors isn't as easy going as you make it seem. We have to deal with killer bugs and killer sided maps too.
---
Actually Bill perks arent in pools anymore since he was added.
---
He mains The Crapper
---
Happened to me bruh. I feel the pain
---
Making it low rank doesn‚Äôt make it more fair either
---
Hag is god-tier in the right hands. Someone who devotes themselves to mastering her is absolutely unstoppable. A master hag can outperform a master Freddy
---
The Cringle's Power: Naughty and Naughtier
---
The Entity has bestowed upon the Cringle the dark gift of improvisation. Gone are the days of giving, the Cringle now harnesses the gifts he once taught- and gifts he received- as his powers. Teachables used by The Cringle are manipulated and formed into his power, based on the combination and teachables used.
---
finally im so glad that people cant leave just because they went into 2nd tier on their first hook
---
Who made this original photo please stand up
---
Try playing killer, downing and hooking other survivors, then your dumb*ss gets downed again, but you get away because ds is still up.
---
In online games in general, ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù and ‚Äútryhard‚Äù mean ‚Äútaking winning more seriously than (the speaker) is.‚Äù
---
Can mean a person who is prioritizing winning to the expense of having fun‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt always.
---
It makes you feel dirty doesnt it. He is my main killer so I love him, but scratched mirror is totally unfair.
---
I agree.
---
you guys even have the ability for it to exist?
---
Yea, I do try to play more, but I think I also need more friends to play with.
---
this guy gets it \^
---
LMAO
---
Ironic because I wasn‚Äôt even using the phrase ‚Äúcrutch perks‚Äù in the context you assumed I was using it. But I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt read. Your reading comprehension already says enough ;)
---
anyone want chocolate brownies?
---
Imagine being the exact person the post was aimed at and still not getting it.
---
It would make a cool chapter I would like to see stuff done with STEM
---
That....doesn't rhyme lol
---
Perhaps with a perk that helped you during chase or an information perk to find people the game wouldn't have ever gotten to the point where you'd need NOED. The reason most high rank killers don't run it is because it's basically a perk saying that you accept you're going to lose and it happens often enough that you waste a perk slot in anticipation.
---
You don't always need to tunnel, it mainly depends on the situation, like if there is 1 gen left, you basically have two different places to go.
---
This is outrageous, it‚Äôs unfair!
---
Anyone get the reference
---
I never said it did.
---
Faced off against a Hag with MYC the other night and I never realized how good of a perk it is on her. Now I'm planning to prioritize Pig since Hag is one of my most used killers.
---
This is some r/comedyheaven type content
---
I cant find it on my phone is it for a certain type of phone?
---
"I will handle it" lmao
---
Basement builds aren't even good, the counter is literally just to do gens
---
Falling for them is on you
---
That doesn't really work that often. The basement can be away from everything else. Like you said, survivors can just run to the opposite side of the map. So you might have to adapt to only playing around the basement. That includes going after someone who might have ran closer to the basement even if they were the last hooked person
---
That killer sure loves abusing lag.
---
wow u r so cool
---
Isn‚Äôt borrowed time already reachable for everyone
---
I mean, this is... a reach, to say the least.
---
Yep, it was turned on, but even with that activated, I couldn't even find my friend's nickname on the friends list. And yes, I linked my Microsoft account with my steam account, but even with that, it didn't worked
---
There going to handle it op no worries.
---
Map awareness? what if you are the first survivor in a chase with 5gens left? youre teammates can be everywhere. doing gens or a totem. no matter what rank.
---
or you are going against an instadown killer like billy or bubba or whatever. empathy wont help you here.
---
If some aura reading ability was added to WGLF that would become the perfect survivor version of BBQ
---
We will just have to agree to disagree.

They did give us Decisive Strike a few months back though.
---
I would just leave that challenge on until you get a game where you shit on the survivors, then when they‚Äôre death hook just slug until egc.
---
That‚Äôs not Claudette
---
I agree that it totally sucks. Nothing like a 3v1 because someone suicided early in the game.
---
have we?
---
I've found it fun to mind game people who run Spine Chill while being Spooky Myers
---
Merry Christmas to you too! In my mind, you're the Santa Claus skinned Clown.
---
How is hooking someone when everyone leaves a free kill. You were downed, you lost. Not even you second chance perks can help you.  You are the kind of survivor that runs dh, bt, adrenaline and ds every game. You escape because of your perks, not because of outplaying the killer

Hey if you keep that up you might hurt my feelings. I'll tell on you.
---
Nah can‚Äôt get stacks if you‚Äôre getting chased... for whatever reason. You‚Äôd have to either forget about that perk for that match or just run with the killer as they‚Äôre chasing someone else
---
Ds locker is the most cancerous thing I face as killer but the head on ds locker is next lvl
---
I see the purpose of them being there but yeah, it can make this game so much more frustrating than it already is.  Especially trying to do the challenges as the role you dont main.
---
The only reason I think NOED is a problem is the fact that it punishes solo players far more than a group. If you're in a group you can constantly communicate and ask if your team has cleansed a totem, how many they cleansed, if they have seen any that aren't cleansed, and one person can go through the map to get them before the game is over. If you're solo you don't know how many your team did, if they saw any and where they were, and if you have time to look for dull totems before the last gen is popped. It's why I think a perk that would create an aura around totems within 10 meters that have been in your teammates' line of sight and have a counter on it for number of totems left would be a good idea. H
---
ell, you could even make it for if your teammates interacted with it. See a dull totem? Just tap it and now anyone using the perk will see it lit up if they come within 10 meters. It isn't ridiculously strong, it doesn't have game breaking value, and more often than not it won't even be necessary. It will synergize well with perks like inner strength though and give a modest amount of information to solo players that those on a team have inherently.
---
UwU such a cute couple am I right
---
Honestly, i used deja vu for the first time and it was actually ez
---
This is barbaric
---
yeah, I was trying to be sarcastic, I forgot I even made this comment anyway
---
(Because the killer tunneled)
---
Believe it or not, EVERY time I run DS it is ONLY is useful against tunneling killers, rarely will I use DS aginst a non-tunneling killer, if ever. Same thing for being killer and not tunneling. I never get hit with DS unless I'm tunneling. Tunneling isn't really toxic if you have a reason for it, DS is just a counter to that. And if this is a reference to "Just git gud," sometimes you need a safety net for the mistakes. It's like NOED, most people use it because they know they're bad with that killer and will likely fail that game, it's their safety net.
---
Also, look at that again, I believe your uneeded rage made you forget what you were saying, as the perspective switches from playing killer to getting your dumbass downed again. Last time I checked killer doesn't get downed.
---
Because destroying undropped pallets is pretty overpowered, and this is coming from a guy who basically hates survivors. Having a "pop goes the weasel" type perk that disables an undtopped pallet for X amount of time (after either a down or a hook) would be more fair. It would have to have an obvious visual effect too, like entity blockers preventing the pallet from being dropped. And of course a cooldown. I can get behind more strategic perks.
---
This exactly happened to me yesterday, but tue survivor disconnected when I was going down the stairs, fucking up my challenge. I was so mad.
---
I'm sure everyone stood up and clapped
---
But...isn't the killer supposed to make YOU shart your pants?
---
We can all agree that The Plague is waifu material
---
He gets points for doing it and if you‚Äôre a doctor playing against a loop and you time it right you can keep them from throwing it down.
---
That's pretty much my view on the archives. I'll just look up the lore I will inevitably miss, since that was the only aspect I actually cared about.
---
Don't worry ladies and gents, I will update this so we can find out what happens to me because of my "Cheating" üòÇ Current update is I asked him to explain how I was cheating and he refused to answer.
---
Pour one out for each
---
Those toxic survivors trying to escape lmao
---
I would be so fucking pissed if I was that trapper. I love it
---
True, that‚Äôs unfortunate but still pretty cool
---
And you know that because you were in every game he played, isn't it?
---
No I run Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing, Kindred, and Botany Knowledge. The game doesn't know if a door is opened, at 99% open, if the trapdoor is right next to the hook, if there is a key on the map, etc. There are so many factors in play. Most of the time, a survivor being hooked at the end of the game is the end of that survivor, but a survivor shouldn't be punished for having evaded the killer the entire game. He should get his chance (even if it's just 4%) at unhooking himself. It's a free kill for the killer if the survivor would have been able to get out, and he is denied that chance.
---
I actually brought this up during the Wednesday Rage Thread and some dude started telling me that Decisive Strike was the more appropriate comparison
---
Took me 3 games to do it. Just had to play nurse with iron grasp and agitation. Would've had it first game but people dced, and the second game the last one got the hatch.
---
This happened to me with that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get hooked‚Äù challenge
---
Fuck an a.  Cane here to ask how this challenge is supposed to be fun for anyone involved?
---
Were you just on yamaoka estate like 15 minutes ago?
---
GO TO THE BATHROOM AND TAKE A SHIT! NOW!
---
If you are OK playing causal and dealing with seeing the same faces in lobby and post game. It's definitely fun but you will have lag spikes, graphics down, stutters, and random forced disconnect (hope you dont mind forced depip). Overall I say dock the switch and use a pro controller to have the best quality of life but honestly get the ps4 version or tell your boyfriend to suck it up and deal with you playing on pc (his family too if they are the ones say no to pc set up).
---
Compares a single health state heal too instant crutch downs for bad killers -- retarded killer main confirmed.
---
Well on the plus side reporting does absolutely nothing so you are good!
---
Most survivors are in green and below, in which case they are actually right to say Bond is better. They are just not reading my disclamers about what rank this starts to apply at.
---
You will never unlock Myers without paying, he costs 500 auric cells. You only earn auric cells from the paid battle pass.
---
If their camping do gens
---
Save without Borrowed Time. If the Killer camps, they are wasting time chasing and downing other Survivors who are doing their objective. Hell, saving with Borrowed Time when a Killer camps can be a bad idea.
---
Me and my friend have realized that if you do something hilarious in front of the killer, more than likely the killer will spare the survivors. My favourite technique so far is the human centipede, but this only works if there are at least three players downed. So it's a risky maneuver, but so far it's worked three times lol one player even went as far as to carry us to the exit gate lol
---
I downed the Steve near the hook and he crawled over to Nancy. Thought it was a cute pic lol
---
No one cares you‚Äôre shit. Get good
---
I‚Äôm straight the fuck up gonna be a piece of shit if I see the killer trying to do it. I won‚Äôt DC but I‚Äôm sure as fuck gonna beeline with sprint burst to the other side of the map and crouch in a corner. I was showed no mercy, so I give no fucking mercy
---
I was. Let a Jeff and David go
---
Ram ranch?? Just give up, billy is shit
---
I have had that happen except mine was with legion
---
Finally a good post
---
Dude I had a very similar dude on PSN. He sent this humongous paragraph saying that I was sad because I didn‚Äôt give him a free win, like I‚Äôm not playing the role that is SUPPOSED to kill.
---
Okay. I wasn't sure. Because I managed to get all 5 gens done while the other two kept getting slugged trying to save the meg and I felt so bad. I didn't wanna get caught in the middle because I was worried he'd slug three and then hook us one by one.
---
"i will handle it" so ominous wtf
---
you can argue for both depending on what condition you look at:
---
Who triggers it: BBQ and Dark Sense are equivalents because it's when your side completes their own objective, and bitter murmur is survivor Kindred, since it's the other side doing their objective that shows you where they go after that
---
When it triggers: BBQ and Kindred are equivalents because they trigger when someone is hooked, while Bitter Murmur and Dark sense are triggered when someone completes a gen
---
Rank 16 btw.
---
What makes it so good is that it lets you know so much. You'll know if the killer has Bbq. You'll know if they're camping. You'll know where your team is and if they're going for a save. If someone  is going for the save it lets you know what you should be doing. Help on a gen, take a hit for a team mate, hide from a killer that is heading for you.
---
4% Gang where you at?? Oh? That's right, They're dead because it's a stupid fucking idea
---
I know how it is. You feel bad, but you gotta focus on the objective and punish the Killer. If you see a surv getting camped, do the objective, no matter how much it sucks to let them die on 1st hook.
---
Fighting/playing hard, as opposed to chill. Which can mean the other guys were really tough opponents.
---
Heh, had something similar.
---
I was having a really bad day playing demi, getting destroyed, teabagged, flashed etc...
---
That until i played against some dudes in the cornfields, bill looped me for a little, and i hit him just as he dropped a pallet, aparently that broke the space time continuum, because 
---
1: i appeared on the other side of the pallet.
---
2: bill started to raise into the air, slowly going upwards, he just kept looking around confused (and aparently unable to move). I just kept staring at him going up, at certain point the other survivors appeared and we just kept looking at bill going up. He eventually disconected.
---
We just stared at eachother for a bit, then continued the game.
---
The endgame chat was esstentially: "well that just happened" but they were surprisingly friendly, laughing at glitches really makes games better.
---
And you cant get a hook until end game
---
Yeah I don't blame you xD
---
Friday 13th is low key decent, it‚Äôs just a chill version of DBD where you don‚Äôt have to try hard. For ¬£4 it‚Äôs well worth it
---
So basically, get within melee distance, press the attack button, and once the grab animation starts playing, make sure to hold it? Might explain why the one time I was able to grab a survivor mid-rescue, it ended up canceling itself.
---
Also is it true that the Doctor can still grab survivors even when he's in Treatment mode?
---
Considering how god tier 60 seconds of complete immunity is, ds is useful no matter what.
---
at least give us the gift box in the blood web
---
Well hopefully they've been running the killer if they haven't been doing gens, in which case they did earn it
---
 The shark from Jaws would be better.
---
By that logic Trapper=Hag because you abandon chases without traps and maintain your traps in a 3gen area if you want to win.
---
To be fair most killer powers don't require skill lmao.Billy,Nurse,Huntress and Oni are pretty much the only ones that require actual skill.The rest are basically gamesense that you gain over time.
---
Also if you have a sweater on I'm not allowed to kill you but, I have Franklin's on. No gifts allowed lol.
---
You think it‚Äôs fair if you would go against a weak killer? Then you destroy him/her by yourself. When they have no control over who they play with, whereas you can play with or without friends
---
Good players dont co.plain about the killer not giving a free win lolololol
---
Clowns my favourite big titty anime waifu
---
If they are camping, you don't have a choice. You don't have to suicide for anyone else.
---
That icon pose looks familiar 
---
‚ÄùYou son of a bitch‚Äù
---
This happened to me with getting two hook rescues in endgame collapse
---
Could the killer see it? If I saw that as the killer I'd be very terrified
---
Just bouncing ideas around, dude. At least it isn't 'killer disguising as survivor' post #96718 lol
---
I mean.. what about people who are running the 'Fuk the Huk' build where they bring slippery meat and Vigos jar of lips? Does that still count?
---
The most useful thing I can see with it is taking a quick snapshot of which gens are being worked, which is invaluable during chases. I'm just not sure if I'm ready to give it my Empathy slot yet, just due to the fact that it's only active when someone is on the hook, and doesn't assist me with being there before they go down.
---
Ok gotcha. What about legion? I like their lore a lot. Gotta spend money on them?
---
That‚Äôs like saying nurse is just ‚Äúhold m2 then press m1 4head‚Äù
---
Just giving an opinion
---
No? It‚Äôs like one of the smallest maps in the game with lots of small rooms and a second floor that make it hard to tell where the killer is coming from and if they‚Äôre even on your floor. Also, all the rooms are very similar to each other so it can make it hard to find generators and especially totems.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know but my friend in the match said I looked normal lol
---
That's a shame, I guess with dedicated servers it's all client side now
---
Whatever keeps me on my gens eh üòÇ you wanna be a distraction? Shit I'll bring you an extra light lol
---
Different killer then. This guy killed us all. My teammates were potatoes and I just wanted 4 pallet stuns :(
---
Even if you doubled your luck, its 6 attempts at 8% chance of unhooking yourself. You can try, or you can wait on the hook for the 15 seconds it takes for someone to run towards you. If all those tries fail, you're now on death hook less than 2 minutes into a match.
---
I like the idea:)
---
But don't you get BP from struggling anyway?
---
No, you can earn legion through shards. You earn shards each time you level up your overall player level. All licensed killers are money only, no other way to get them. These are Michael Myers, Freddy Krueger, leatherface, Pig (Saw), deomgorgon, ghostface. These are all paid only. Whereas all others can be purchased through in game currency, 9000 iridescent shards
---
Why was this removed? I was going to say that the funny thing is that saying what clown skin you're running and which platform you're on is probably actually enough info to personally identify you lol
---
Yeah ik. You've got a point tho
---
and then they can just keep running and loop u all over again cuz u lose bloodlust from it
---
I did the Dark Sense ones both in one try lmao
---
I know what tryhard is, I just never heard sweaty until I started playing DBD.
---
They literally don‚Äôt even matter lol
---
The rule is, if they are vaulting they need to be injured, otherwise its fair game, you can grab survicors off of a hook, gen, totem, and even gate switch and it doesnt matter if theyre injured.
---
To grab you cannot lunge, you have to tap the melee button.
---
If youre farming grabs for the archive you can propose a farm to survivors and just grab them from gens. Or if you get a 3k and close the hatch you will usually catch the last guy at a gate halfway done, just walk up and stand behind them and follow them, they will realise theyre screwed and often open the gate in front of you, then it's an easy grab.
---
Thats not even close to what mobile got or what we got in previous years. 
---
Do you remember when they made whole items for events? sure they where just reskins of the fire crackers but they where cool!
---
but now its acceptable to get a sweater for a character that almost no one mains, and a shitty charm that is hardly noticeable in game and isnt even as interesting as some of the other DECENT charms.
---
Yeah make sure to hold it. Also that other commenter was right, my bad, unhooking survivors can be grabbed even in healthy state. Im pretty sure Doctor can grab in either mode but not 100% sure
---
The Legion now listens to Gojira and Cannibal Corpse. Good job
---
Awesome! Thank you 
---
I was saving up my shards to buy one of those perks in the in the Shrine of Secrets. Is the SoS just a fast way to get good perks without playing that character?
---
If this wasn‚Äôt so funny I‚Äôd be mad I had to dc and depip lol
---
I got it first try
---
Hehe
---
Bobie
---
I love it when they purposefully play bad to get hit, and later in the game when they actually need it they don't have it.
---
BTW, if you have an opportunity to  possibly down a survivor you take it even if they are fresh off the hook
---
But it's a meme build..... I was being sarcastic, if you take the game THAT seriously where you don't want people having fun while making it more likely I mean.. you are kinda just being THAT guy. But if we are having an ACTUAL debate...
---
I understand your point but if you are doing the fuk the Huk' build you usually have 1 or 2 friends that also bring vigos which stack (to my knowledge) and with that on top of something like up the ante you are just unlucky to not get off.
---
Ghost face is fun to play.
---
Well you don‚Äôt have to play the character at all, you just have to level them up for teachable perks. 3 per character, unlocked at levels 30 ,35,40.    Shrine of secrets is good but I recommend saving it for licensed killer/survivor perks only, if you aren‚Äôt planning to buy them. Other than that save shards for buying unlicensed characters
---
Is there a colour tier rank demotion in place with this as well? I glitched out during a game (the survivor got stuck in the kneeling position), and voluntarily disconnected from the match. I began the match as rank 5, and afterwards was rank 9.  
---
If that's the case, they really need to re-consider this.
---
I'm not against fun. And the original post was describing people who put themselves into struggle phase the instant they get placed on a hook. I don't know any meme builds, so I can't really comment on that.
---
Yeah, but save at least 800k before prestige, so you start getting some perks fast
---
Awesome. Thank you for the help! I‚Äôve learned a lot
---
Those feels bro
---
It was removed?
---
O.k.
---
Wait isn‚Äôt that the place where he did it to em?
---
You'd be suprised how much it helps
---
Yeah Hag is usually a fun time for me, just being able to teleport all around the map. Though I did have one game where like two survivors had flashlights, that was less fun.
---
I imagine others killers with teleportation skills like Freddy and Demogorgon can make great work of MYC too or any killer with good mobility like Nurse or Spirit.
---
It makes no difference to me
---
On the 12th day of Christmas Behaviour gave to me:
---
* Fucking garbage
---
* Fuuuuucking gaaaaaaarbage
---
* And fuuuuucking garbaaaage
---
Oh fuuuuuck that lol
---
Did you just kill him?
---
Yeah, no. Iri head huntress with infantry belt is still the most broken and OP thing in the game.
---
What rank are you at? Because I tend to hover around rank 1-5, and whenever I see someone with object, I tend to ignore them completely. Mainly because if someone is running Object at these ranks, they‚Äôre good enough to run me around. I hate loading into a game and seeing someone with object, yet I like to run it when I play survivor just for the meme of it all. 
---
TLDR: don‚Äôt chase anyone who‚Äôs running object, it won‚Äôt end well
---
*Dr
---
You wrote all this text to tell us that camping and tunnelling is annoying ?  No shit
---
A lot of the old hair cosmetics look terrible after the hair update. I'm still waiting for them to fix Jeff's eyelashes so he doesn't look like he's crossdressing.
---
The UI is the size of your hit box
---
At least you tried I guess lol. Merry Christmas!
---
Gave up on that whole thing long ago. Too grindy. Too specific. Make me play in stupid ways or worse ways. Doesn‚Äôt make it fun. It makes it more frustrating. I regret buying t he pass but it‚Äôs the last pass I‚Äôll buy for DBD.
---
I enjoyed all the challenges.  Maybe unpopular opinion.
---
is that gud?
---
Guess you didn't see the part where I was face camped.... within the first 2 minutes of a game.
---
You're right. I forgot about that.
---
Umm if your laptop has bluetooth enabled you can actually sync a ps4 controller(maybe xb1 too idk) and use it normally. I don't recommend using it to play though, as your camera turn speed is still hard-capped on analog sticks. You just have to practice, a lot.
---
I did sacrifice him a while ago but I let the last guy take hatch...I brought Lightborn because 3 people in the lobby had a flashlight and I guess he wasn‚Äôt a fan of that. Oh well...can‚Äôt please everyone
---
Not me. I have been letting everyone escape unless you are the obsession. I still need 3 more but I'm not running an obsession perk so these matches have had no obsession. I'm Sinlayan on PS4.
---
I liked the Commodore 64 version way better. I might of just dated myself.  Hehehe.
---
Which is most likely the next chapter as the killer‚Äôs backstory is already flushed out.
---
Susie has a present on her head! YES!
---
2 out of 4 said it back, so it was a still a pleasant experience overall, considering it‚Äôs red ranks.
---
Mods in here being nothing but grinches tonight
---
This happened to me on the four pallet challenge. I thought ill just farm blood points and maybe try someone else to drop four pallets. The next game after I swapped I dropped four.
---
I had no flair. I hope I don't have to repost. I added flair.
---
ok yeah
---
lol Merry Christmas! üéÑ 
---
Fuckem
---
Another reason to not buy it from the shrine is that you already have Bill. My advice is to never buy perks from characters you already have unlocked. Getting 9k iri shards to unlock a perk takes way longer than lvling a character to 30/35/40.
---
In my opinion, if you don‚Äôt have BT, work on gens the entire time. 2 hook states last 120 seconds, which can (potentially), waste 4 gens of a killer‚Äôs time. Whenever I‚Äôm on the hook and getting camped, I always tell my friends to just work on gens and don‚Äôt bother with me, and they always get at least 3 done. So to answer your question, it‚Äôs worse to try to save someone while they‚Äôre being camped
---
Report button in this game does Jack shit. Also, tunneling, camping or being a dick in general is not a bannable offence. The only time you could get banned is for keeping the game hostage e.g. blocking survivors in the basement.
---
I disagree. Infinite T3 Myers is more op. Always insta down and running. Take less skill to use and don't have to reload like hatchets.
---
And then that‚Äôs when you blind them, when they least expect it
---
Just tryna spread some Christmas cheer in the absence of a Christmas event
---
Actually he lives alone, so nothing like that. It's just my tower has two glass doors and a water cooling loop, so transporting it back and forth every weekend is a major pain in my butt! :[
---
"How to counter NOED: cleanse the damn totems"
---
God I hope I run into you and I'm not the obsession. I've gotten 3 pallet stuns in 5 or 6 games now, I just cant get that 4th one
---
What did they do to ms.oinker this time?
---
My collection of teached perks is not really big but I have all of those 4 perks XD Fk me
---
eye like that
---
How did you come up with all of these? Like I get the Jeff and Legion one, but why Plague and Clown for example? Either way, great job :)
---
Deliverance is different. You aren't putting yourself into the struggle phase.
---
And the survivor could have just made a mistake and been downed randomly without doing anything to deserve it
---
that would be a painful trophy requirement to have

That's exactly the reason why this battle pass bs doesn't suit this game. Challenges such as these are completely broken with how the game is played in reality.
---
tbh those frozen skins look really good it would be nice to have more but in pc/console
---
Lol classic. I‚Äôm in the same boat as you except for   Shadow born. At least it‚Äôs not like that time I got David to 35 and the shrine got dead hard the next day.
---
"Merry cristler"
---
What happened to ms.Oinker
---
I‚Äôd debate you on the range of her M2. It be quite large. Either way, I don‚Äôt see a point in not cleansing if everyone is infected and there are gens you can do that aren‚Äôt. Because either way, it‚Äôs gonna be a one hit down situation.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm not learning one of the four shitty button layouts they have preset.
---
 It‚Äôs unreasonable for me to do because it would just wreck my muscle memory and I‚Äôd play like shit for months before I actually mastered one of the other 3 (bad imo) button presets they have on console. 
---
I think it would just be a one time fix, there‚Äôs not much to lose at all giving players some choice to this and it would just be a win-win all around imo.
---
You almost DONT want ruin, if you have ruin it makes people look for the ruin and then they can find devour, if anything you would want thrill or something like Make your choice/infectious fright/Haunted Grounds to try and keep momentum and snowball
---
This is not meant to be rude. I‚Äôm not sure what else to say except to make that disclaimer. 
---
It always amazed me the number of artists that take into account a woman‚Äôs mons pubis when drawing them. It can really change a drawing. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be sexual. Just part of the figure.
---
The key to doing this mission is agitation and iron grasp. I used both of those on trapper, and got it on my first try. I felt really bad for the survivors, (even messaged them after), but it did the trick. With those two perks you can carry them from almost the other side of the map to the basement.
---
Monitor and Abuse, a perk that lowers your terror radius when not in a chase, and increases it when in a chase.
---
What presets?  All I had to do is change the action key for healing and gens,
---
Didn‚Äôt they just nerf his ability to turn like a race car while empowered? Which seems justified.
---
Yeah, maybe it doesn't have to be bloodpoints. Maybe you could do stuff to slightly benefit your team or something. Idk
---
Countering NOED and finding Ruin after pushing through it for a gen/being chased is definitely worth the perk slot. Exhaustion perks are a crutch and my playstyle clashes too hard with DS. So personally, it's totally worth it.
---
I brought padded jaws any time I intended to farm traps for the archives. The survivors were very confused when traps didn‚Äôt injure them.
---
They were cuties, though.
---
I love empathy. Its range is huge, and keeps you up to date who is where and who be runnin from killer.

But doesn‚Äôt noed last after your first hit on each survivor?
---
Like people who create posts because others aren‚Äôt allowing them to play like a dick?
---
Botany knowledge for me. Self care is better, MedKits are better, sloppy is worse.
---
You have been chosen. You have seven days.
---
This is the dbd subreddit where playing like a dick is Ok as long as you‚Äôre the one posting about it and complaining about _others_ that were the ‚Äúactual‚Äù dicks. It‚Äôs the most hypocritical post I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs pretty funny.
---
Wanna watch this really cool movie I made a copy of?

Neither could the other 200 people that posted this lol

She's got a fertile crescent, jussayin.

Try to communicat with survs in the lobby,thats how i got my one!

Are you even on console?

Bruh

Imagine exploiting this. I hope you reported.

Killers are weird :/ what rank are you at?
---
Oh boy! I only have VHS player, is that a problem?

If you do run up and point at me. I'll know it's you unless this is your ps name

Forgot NSFW tag. If my boss catches me looking at this at 11:30 PM Christmas eve, that's what will happen to me.

The absolute madman.

&gt;*DBD mobile? Who needs it!*
---
What rank are you at? I main myers and played many rounds just doing challenges and camping is not a requirement in any of the challenges last time I checked maybe they‚Äôre new killers or just some hook camping cult idk about
---
nah i just got out of the womb
---
Survivors are so toxic on console. I play strictly toxic now because very rarely do people end the game happily.
---
Ikr, just a normal day in dbd
---
I've noticed some killers try to get too fancy in loops so if you just run away from where you were planning on looping it takes them a second to realized you left lol
---
BHVR is trying to give some much needed love to the brave underdogs of DBD, the basement camping Bubbas
---
I'm sure he was just mad he died, not about the perk. Also, unless he was grouped with him, letting the other guy go probably just made him angrier.
---
^(I play devil's advocate for fun and no one can stop me.)
---
Look at the doors and you can find a gen. As a killer, a lot of times you're left wondering if you'll be able to make it to a hook or not.
---
Anytime you kobe (even with deliverance) on console you get the worst rubberband, as if the game can‚Äôt possibly fathom you escaped the hook by yourself.
---
&gt;Countering NOED and finding Ruin after pushing through it for a gen/being chased is definitely worth the perk slot. Exhaustion perks are a crutch and my playstyle clashes too hard with DS. So personally, it's totally worth it.
---
Noed is used in 12% of matches. That means any time spent cleansing dull totems, while worth some juicy bloodpoints and lightbringer points if you care about emblems, is a complete waste of time in 88% of matches. Then add in all of the matches when you dont get to power all 5 gens vs a noed user and that is even more often that cleansing dulls is a waste of time.
---
I dont..really know how to answer to "exhaustion perks are a crutch". You're literally saying "I dont want to use perks that are good because good perks are a 'crutch' so instead I'm gonna use perks that are worse but I find more fun." So uh. Fair enough! Go for it.
---
Yeah it is, but it doesn‚Äôt do the best job. Since it‚Äôs a hex perk, survivors can disable NOED while Adrenaline can‚Äôt be undone or stopped, aside from careful Legion stabbing (adrenaline clears the deep wound and not the injury, though I‚Äôm not sure it still does that) or carrying, hooking, or killing them before it happens.
---
You gotta sacrifice two people before the last gen pops, then if you down last two after it‚Äôs completed. Awful challenge tho.
---
This happens all the time when I play xbox. Like all the time. I could send pictures for days of people calling me trash for not being nice to them.

Good luck my amigo
---
Trapper is way better for snowballing the game honestly.For hag all it requires is 1 or more flashlights and your hook traps are gone.Or a coordinated SWF could completely destroy your web while you're carrying a survivor.I had many times when as soon as I pick up someone 5+ traps would be activated,effectively making me waste more time setting traps up back again.
---
And as hag you can hit 1 survivor at a time,while trapper can make places like haddonfield balconies and buildings inescapeable,which is extremely difficult for survivors at times like basement saves.2 downs at the same time and after that you make a vicious cycle basically.
---
If trapper got some buffs like tar bottle base kit and centralized trap spawns,he'd easily be top tier.
---
I'm not saying hag is braindead to play though,like objecting "draw triangles and win" as you say.
---
If you escape the killers grasp and he chases after you, its not tunneling. 
---
Tunneling is when the killer ignores all other players to chase down one player over and over, usually right after they are unhooked.
---
I asked them first what happend and they were as confused as me, they ended up killing all 3 of us (and i lost my damn skeleton key to this) they worked together to corner us so yeah, you know i hit that report button
---
Oof
---
Everyone thinks everything is toxic. I can‚Äôt possibly see how anything in this game is toxic. There‚Äôs a consequence to almost every action.

Ps4?

Ladies and gentlemen: the Xbox dbd community rofl
---
That actually makes a lot of sense. I've been wondering how I've been getting so lucky with those
---
Good for you. I hope the others did as well. At the end of the day, it's BHVR's fault for literally allowing this to be possible, but also the players fault for playing normally after they see what's going on.
---
It's still MORE BHVR's fault, btw, but the players should still be reported as well.
---
Get your fucking shit together BHVR.
---
This is a hidden easter egg referencing ace's sunglasses, a nod to him being "four-eyed".
---
Likewise, really jealous we can't get them on Steam. Signed up for mobile just to get em.
---
What's the purpose of dcing last second?  It should count as a sacrifice if someone DCs while downed.
---
He's still an M1 killer. Most safe loops are still safe and unsafe loops are slightly less safe. He doesn't move faster at EWIII than EWII, only his lunge is affected. You also have to build up evil within, which is not easy against good survivors. 
---
Sure it takes less skill, but that doesn't mean it's more OP. A bad killer playing leatherface would do better than if they played old omega blink nurse, does that mean leatherface is more OP? A good huntress with 3 insta down hatchets is in a whole different galaxy than a tier 3 Myers.
---
You are a nice person. 
---
I think it looks great as well. Keep up the great works :)
---
and the perks are the size of the survivors hitboxes when you play killer
---
I am speed
---
Adrenaline can be taken away by not going to endgame/not letting 5 gens get done.
---
No problem with all the offerings I have saved up
---
The challenges are all doable, it's only qualifying for one at a time that sucks. I recon you should be able to select all challenges remaining on old tomes that you have reached the last node on.
---
When was this game ever marketed as being a game where a killer and survivor help each other?
---
Wait your getting an achievement for playing the game?
---
It is called "Master challenge" for a reason.
---
LOL
---
&gt;Noed is used in 12% of matches
---
And that's 12% of matches where I hard counter the killer, snowballing the advantage for a 4 man escape.
---
&gt;a complete waste of time in 88%
---
The killer is almost always running a hex perk, and I run Inner Strength with Detectives. The only time it's a "complete waste of time" is versus a plague with no hex perks.
---
&gt;you dont get to power all 5 gens vs a noed user
---
If they run noed, every game is going to endgame unless my team literally all run at him and kill themselves. A killer being permanently down a perk hurts them more than you think. That's one less slot for Sloppy, Ruin, Thanatophobia, Nurse's, etc.
---
&gt;You're literally saying "I dont want to use perks that are good because good perks are a 'crutch' so instead I'm gonna use perks that are worse..."
---
Except I didn't say that. I don't find the need to use exhaustion perks because I learned how to loop without them. I won't deny that they allow you to get away with riskier positioning/mistakes, but I'd rather run perks that help me finish the game and counter the killer, rather than perks that fix errors.
---
Idk, we can argue the theoreticals and make either one sound stronger. If we are gonna be fair and say hags traps can just get burned out by flashlights, we also have to point out that anyone can disarm a trapper trap with a standard 3 second action. Areas only become inescapable against trapper if he is physically there to apply pressure such that survivors who try to disable his traps will just be m1'd, while hag pressures a 40+ meter radius at all times (I always run the + teleport distance addon).
---
Hag also has drastically more area coverage than trapper. He can hold 3 traps at absolute maximum at one time, with a smaller radius of effect on each trap than hag. If he wants to trap the shit out of a specific location, he has to spend time setting his 3 traps, then walking a wide loop around the map to gather three more and come back and set more. 
---
A coordinated swf can just as easily have 1 member follow trapper and disable each trap he sets as they can run through hag traps while she carries survivors. And both can be watched with object of obsession.
---
I can agree a dream scenario where 3 people run in bear traps within 30 seconds is a massive snowball potential. But while hag doesnt have an effective one shot without perks like make your choice, she has the benefit of a 24 meter terror radius. Typically I will slap people once and let them run off if they are going somewhere without traps. Once I have several injured, I patrol around with monitor and abuse + nurses calling and the 16 meter terror radius + aura reveal makes snowballing very easy and very consistent.
---
Both killers have potential to be very good, but as territorial/trap based characters they are both gimped hard by survivor teams that use a spotter and communication.
---
Are you fr? Or just messing
---
Well that's just poor planning.
---
‚ÄúSee‚Äù nice one
---
Huh?...
---
Get dark sense man its great
---
True ;)
---
I started with trapper and hated playing killer. His play style just wasn‚Äôt for me. Seconding what other people said and go to who‚Äôs more appealing to you and your style!
---
That's one of the reasons I stopped playing. Doing what the daily asks and it fucking up and not giving me my points I rightfully earned.
---
Sometimes NoED really hurts. Once I did three totems and still got hit by NoED at the end. There was also Ruin in that game, which meant that there was just one totem that caused it.
---
I played hag for devour hope because I had ruin when It came out in the shrine of secrets
---
Damn, I clicked this post expecting another unrealistic survivor main wanting something op, but this is actually kind if sick
---
The facial expression is just perfect
---
Friends :)
---
Dam that as- I mean ponytail
---
I dont know about that. With addons maybe but as far as base character goes I think Freddy reigns supreme.
---
Don‚Äôt worry you can practice playing him before you decide to purchase him...oh wait.
---
just go to the recent player tab on steam
---
I love playing Legion, it just hurts sometimes.
---
Game was fun as he'll, until they got sued
---
With the Nurse but you can only do it playing on console
---
n0 HE is aCTuaLlI rAnK dr, dUMbERr
---
How did you did dark senses?
---
Yep, definitively works if the killer is the slightest nontoxic being.
---
I got to shake my head and point at a Wraith, and in the end he helped me get my safe unhook challenges while I allowed him to carry me to the basement a few times for hooks. It was great.
---
I love Legion. I play them different than others though.
---
Am I the only one who actually enjoys playing Legion and the pain that comes with it
---
Leatherfaces are the common predator of the Claudette.
---
as someone who plays console this is true
---
No idea why you got downvoted because a lot of killers I see even say relying on no ed is a bad strategy since you basically lose the game even if you kill some survivors.
---
For that one I actually had to open the exit gates (as killer) the begin the egc and then bait the survivors to that door with noed waiting. These challenges have brought out the worst in me :(
---
My ruin checks when I hop on someone's gen.
---
To be honest, I started playing legion more recently and god is it fun! Just bought new Susie outfit with iridescent shards and about to hit p3
---
Yes, they had a rocky process with the fixes, but they were still improving with a small, but growing team to do it. Still, the potential too see more improvement from Illfonic was killed by the effects of the lawsuit that is going on outside of the game. Imo, dedicated &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; content focus, because it gets VERY redundant that a match is ruined for everyone when the host quits after getting mad they are gonna die. RIP Jason X content forever, but it was the better choice for a healthier game, aside from its issues. Not everything's perfect after all :(.
---
Yeah I'm a bit confused about that myself
---
where is the credits? Or did you draw that and then put it into mematic? lol
---
No. Just, no. I would absolutely hate to see this in dead by daylight. Fnaf doesnt have dbds atmosphere at all. what would the power be?? teleport? not like we already have 2 other killers with teleportation abilities. Imagine freddy running at you. Its just dumb.
---
Not yelling at you OP. Don't take it the wrong way. But wow this is a huge no from me.
---
Bing Bing Time!!!
---
People are still DCing over Spirit. I used to until I started to realize she‚Äôs loud af in phasewalk.
---
If the killer is camping I always say do gens and get out punish him for camping by forcing the 1 k pip down
---
*breaks keyboard over knee* *throws monitor out window* *punts cat across the room*
---
Ah yes a Detroit become human reference I like.
---
Legion best killer
---
*screams in blind the killer two times in one trial*
---
Similar thing happened to me. I spawned nearish to claudette and downed her within 30 seconds. She dc'd and messaged me that she would have me banned for abusing a glitch that lets me spawn near her(?) I asked her about this but then she went rambling on about how I am toxic and that any further messages by me would be taken as "harassment" smh survivor mains man
---
Fuck your faggets devs your unworthy piece of shits. Fuck yourselves and fuck your ugly parents
---
When you have people who were just unhooked hopping on gens infront of you and then running into lockers so you can't slug them, meaning you have to leave them and let them get 3/4ths of a gen done by the time their inviniciblity field wears off, I'd say there's an issue with that perk design.  
---
BT is an actual anti tunnel perk, Ruin just slows down the gens so one doesn't pop at the start before you can even get there (though yeah, it can last too long and it becomes unfair), Devour Hope is an RNG perk that rewards you for not camping and I'd say the only real get out off jail free card exhaustion perk is dead hard (I hate dead hard for that reason but I'm not deluded enough to expect it to ever get changed). I don't see how those perks reward bad play but NOED and DS absolutely do, yeah.   
---
If you're actually getting tunneled off hook, DS should proc and stay proced regardless of how long it takes the killer to down you. But to give a survivor invincibility for an entire minute when the killer wasn't even nearby when the unhook happened is just silly, especially when you're playing a weaker killer.
---
Cleansing totems means taking time to find, taking time to actually cleanse them, and then, maybe, the Killer will have Noed. If he doesn't? You did that for no reason and you wasted a lot of time.
---
So no, it's not easily countered and not only does it allow killer to down survivors in one hit, it makes the Killer go faster, during the end game, where most of the pallets have probably been used already and most likely survivors still alive are on death hooks.

Using your own feelings as an excuse to DC is just childish. DC'ing ruins somebody's day, I don't where you got this idea that leaving a co-op match where teammates are needed to escape is making everyone else happy.

ok boomer

How did you trigger? üòï
---
Balanced Decisive Burst
---
I was not planning on doing that but I definitely won‚Äôt now.

Makes sense. Unfortunately survivors tend to cleanse every totem they come across, dull or lit but haunted grounds would be a good hex to pair with it.
---
It‚Äôs watching me
---
No
---
Wdym? 3 out of 4 are good.
---
Do you not have phone's?
---
More than 2 DCs should give you no unpip andno pip.
---
It‚Äôs an add on for the map, let‚Äôs the survivor mark a location :)
---
Congrats on the climb
---
Devour Hope wins games.  
---
It + haunted grounds on a spirit is devastating
---
Only if you play Dbd on the Soulja Boy console.
---
Oh god my highest was 9 idk how 4 goes maybe it gets more sweaty the closer you are to the 1 players
---
He got nerfed a bit recently despite being in a good place
---
Iron Grasp and Agitation and patrol 3 closest gen around basement. Did both sacrifice 4 and hook 5 challenge in 1 try.
---
I‚Äôm guessing it can be use efficiently for hatch?
---
NOED hurts like hell, especially when you've done a good job in your chases, only to die instantly because  everyone's exposed for doing their objective. The amount of times in the past few days the killer has 3k because of this crutch is insane. NOED along with monstrous shrine should be top priorities for reworks. (At least make it T3 noed makes everyone exposed, not T1)
---
Ram ranch? Are you playing with one hand?
---
No I mean isn‚Äôt it already in the blood web I got it on nea and haven‚Äôt bought it or levelled up bill
---
Yes, I solo queue a lot too so I sometimes use it to mark hex totems or even just the location of a gen that I‚Äôm on
---
I did pallet stun him once in those 2 minutes. Apparently he really took it personal...
---
I play on the handheld Soulja Boy

Hm. What do you play on?

I bought two of them for the BP so I could prestige Demogorgon (it went really good, I got most of my old build back before level 20).

Yeah, this event may get a new player to start, that'd double the playerbase.
---
I did it with huntress without any of that tbh I was lucky they had a baby survivor and the last person didn't wiggle and understood I had the challenge.
---
I had the huntress basement perk, ruin, not sure if I had iron grasp or not and nurse calling
---
Nothing, they just recalled the Vietnam flashback.
---
And you can't even play if you're in NA.

I love thinking that they're all actually friends and hang out outside of trials. Reminds me of Ralph and Sam from Looney Tunes

then why do we have to mash a button to struggle on the hook

I didnt realize this was r/deadbydaylight and thought I accidentally joined a cultist subreddit

Were they running DS and adrenaline? If that's the case, INVALID.

Yo dawg! I heard that you like Myers, so we put myers offering for you so you can enjoy Myers while playing as Myers.

I just got Legion today and the first game I played I got 32k Bloodpoints :p

How does this look like Claudette?

I always find ir funny when I see survivors complaining about the slug meta whenever they're the ones causing it by all running DS lol

Uhhh, o
---
This is the first time I've ever seen someone call for a nerf for monstrous shrine. It's the worst killer perk in the game and anyone who runs it is wasting a perk slot.
---
Amazing
---
You hate to see it. I wonder if changing it to hold a button would fix. Or simply having struggle automatically happen and have them push a button to end it. 
---
You know, just some ideas not based in reality at all.
---
If I fail as survivor I can blame my teammates, if I fail as killer I have no one to blame but myself
---
Do you play killer, survivor, or both?
---
I hope this is a joke
---
Oni if you like movement. You like sprinting, smashing, overwhelming with demon dash
---
Plague if you like strategy. You like planning ahead by infecting pallets and vaults and figuring out when to collect corrupt purge
---
I always do this on this map and the killer always just beats me to death :(
---
Wow, my last game some guy told me that he hoped for Christmas that I wouldn't wake up the next day.
---
Literally looks nothing like Claudette lol.
---
I just can‚Äôt get the four pallet stuns in one game. Looping has never been my strong suit to begin with so this is the worst one for me. Also they keep psyching me out and making me drop it before they go through, so no stun. At this point I think I‚Äôm better off ignoring it and hoping that I find a farming killer eventually.
---
Literally what brand new part used to be and it got nerfed. Moris should‚Äôve been changed during that update too.
---
I think holding the struggle button is a really good idea tbh.
---
Theoretically you have 100% chance of winning at any killer.
---
I doubt they would teleport maybe something like Freddy where if you‚Äôre awake he‚Äôs less powerful maybe they wind a music box or something? I‚Äôm sure the devs could come up with a cool idea for em it‚Äôs all about power and how the killer would behave
---
You probably levelled Jake up before Bill came out on console. 
---
Borrowed time, unbreakable and left behind used to be perks already unlocked on every character on console. 
---
Bill was added to console a little earlier this year
---
Are you on console? Jake got Borrowed Time when it was a generic perk before Bill got introduced to console
---
Are you on console? If so, he was added later and his perks were already in the game so if you had the game and leveled up a character then you have a chance to have t
---
Depends on how many adrenalines. If it‚Äôs 3 or 4 then yeah it‚Äôs fucked up. If it‚Äôs only 1 or 2 and it doesn‚Äôt activate during a chase then it‚Äôs basically just an extra sprint burst
---
Today I got called Baby killer and shit talked because the last survivor let his teammate die on first hook and then dipped out the hatch. I guess he‚Äôs just a really good player or something.
---
That's because he's a little busy handling the cheating situation. Give him some time to clear his schedule.
---
How are you blaming the devs for this one?
---
His fucking neck
---
I can counter her if no one in my team cleanses. However, if so many of them cleanse, I always fail countering her Vile Purge. It's even more dangerous than Huntress's hatches.
---
just hit 0
---
like my life support
---
Okay now before you get bombarded started by a bunch of Survivor mains. I play Both Sides so here's how I look at it.
---
1. This can be very useful solo if your teammates don't bother healing or anything for that matter and you have to to become self-sufficient.
---
2. Has a killer I kind of like this park because if I have Sloppy butcher combined with nurses calling or any other anti healing perk then it's an easy game to a degree. If I'm still dealing with a survive with friends Squad I might just get defeated regardless
---
Dark Devotion.
---
I really hate bbq chips . Such an op perk . I can‚Äôt resist eating them everytime the killer using it . Bbq chips are just too good
---
He relaxed to hard
---
I got to 3 the begged the last guy, and he gave his life. Enough to make a grown man cry
---
dont quote me on this but it is only obtainable by setting your region to denmark, *i think*
---
game ain't cheap with all the DLCs and AC-only cosmetics. These are dummy reskins, but still better than nothing imo.
---
Borrowed Time is probably the best perk on the Shrine this week, but it's also available by levelling up a free character.
---
Hex: Devour Hope is a fun killer perk, and can be incredibly strong if you get a good totem spawn. It suffers from the weakness of every other Hex perk though. It might last you all game, but it might last 30 seconds too.
---
Those would be my two picks for this week. The other two perks are available by levelling up the characters included with the game.
---
Maybe cause you brought a dang yamoakas offering
---
Probably Hex: Devour Hope if anything imo. The other three can be taught off free characters. That being said, Borrowed Time is meta. If you're playing killer consider buying Hag and learning Hex:Ruin, it only takes a few more levels to unlock Devour Hope as well.
---
Coming from another killer main, I don't use noed because it's easily countered by cleansing totems and I prefer to kill everyone before the 5th generator is powered. As with everything else in this game, the balance of this perk is in its trade-off. It doesn't do anything until the exit gates are powered, so essentially it's a paperweight for 90% of the time you're playing killer. Furthermore, unlike other hex perks, you could lose this hex before it even activates and you wouldn't know it until it's too late. Playing with this perk is like playing with only 3 perks for 90% to possibly 100% of the game.
---
Tldr: This perk is a crutch for bad killers but in my opinion it's only actually dangerous against bad survivors.
---
Use whispers to help you find the survivors and don‚Äôt chainsaw when it‚Äôs lit up to help you hear the survivors better.
---
How do you even.
---
Ram ranch.
---
Such a victim
---
Not completely their fault, but that mission promotes a basement centric playstyle that leads to extra tilt and toxicity on both sides. The challenge is annoying because it‚Äôs hard and not in your hands at all. Hard challenges that the player controls are fine but this challenge is controlled by killer choice, basement RNG, map, survivor perks, SWF, DCS, etc,
---
Pallets are part of game balance I dont think removing any strong loop is a fun idea
---
Playing Basement Trapper is the most evil fun I‚Äôve had in DbD for sure
---
it doesnt make it unplayable or anything, its just a little annoying when you get a facecamping bing bong boi, escape, then bc you escaped, he tunnels and facecamps the next game bc he recognizes you.

You say you would be fine with more grindy challenges, but level 1 and 2 had easy, but grindable challenges and everyone was complaining about them too. Out of whatever number of challenges there were how many were actually difficult? Maybe 7 or so after the challenge nerfs? I disagree with the sentiment that challenges shouldn't change the way you play in fact I think they're the perfect opportunity to make people try out new things they otherwise wouldn't. My problem with the challenges is that I've all teachables, but my characters aren't that leveled up so I've to see which random character has whatever perk is needed. Not only that, but hope that they also have other perks that can provide synergy with what the challenge is asking.

Why did you make the plague so t h i c c

This had better not awaken something within me

Don't take it personally, some survivors are toxic every time they die no matter the circumstance and others can be toxic if you use specific tactics. You're not on their team though, and its your job to kill them. If you played by the survivors rules you wouldn't get a single hook and all 4 would escape every time.
---
I'm a killer main but I also play survivor occasionally (to study their tactics and learn how to beat them). There are things the killer does that suck for survivors, for example: if you get unhooked and the killer immediately downs you and rehooks you it sucks. If you get chased all game and you're the only one killed it sucks. If you get camped by the killer or hooked in the basement it sucks. All of these things are 99% controlled by the killer but also all legitimate tactics
---
Tldr: you're just doing your job but it can make it not fun for survivors sometimes. Try to remember that the survivors are playing a game also and we all just want to have fun :)
---
I only bring a Moro when I see scoops ahoy Steve
---
Why report them though? They obviously didn't know how it happened and decided to just play the game and end it. Do you want them to sit in a corner and let you win? Jesus...

Apart from latency shenanigans, yes, killers have priority at the hatch.
---
Insert so you have chosen death meme
---
There's a streamer killer main on twitch named "Otzdarva" and he's a god in this game. He's also extremely wholesome. Watching his channel and his YouTube videos (his YouTube is "notOtzdarva") teaches you how to get better at the game but also how to deal with toxic survivors and be a less toxic killer yourself.
---
Congrats, you just proved his point
---
Part of me thinks they just want survivors to disconnect so that the survivors get a temp ban.
---
*sees borrowed time*
---
I gotta get me one of those
---
They're called challenges and they're supposed to be hard. You're mad that no one is giving them to you for free so I have to ask: do you really expect sympathy from those of us who earned the challenges?
---
Good for a team support build. Other then that I personally prefer prove thyself for the extra bp
---
I‚Äôve been away for about two months, is Spirit more balanced now? I miss playing her but I always felt bad given how broke my strong she is.
---
Looks good I like it. :)
---
That's your choice. My choice is to make survivors earn their challenges when I play killer and make the killer earn his challenges when I play survivor. Neither one of us is wrong.
---
Thanks for the clear up, I was confused as to why I couldn‚Äôt buy BT for bloodpoints even though my Claudette and Meg have it already
---
Demogorgon with Territorial Imperative, Make Your Choice, and portal speed/recharge addons (I also used Agitation for an easier first hook and Ruin to make the game last longer). Took me a few attempts, but I got it
---
Otzdarva has a video on YouTube of basically this exact build. He was just trying to meme with it, but boy it certainly works for real
---
Interesting, *unzips* very interesting
---
They way I look at kindred is, it helps when you need it the most, aka someone is hooked.  If noone is hooked, you're winning unless its a slugger.  Helps prevent time wasted from someone going to stage 2 from no rescue, or from 2 ppl going for the rescue.  I also run open-handed for it, 8 extra meters on it is real nice.
---
I was actually hoping they‚Äôd give really good perks for Christmas like perks for survivors and killer you need to pay for. To say the least I‚Äôm pretty disappointed once agane
---
its the exact same as someone else healing you. self care = 32 seconds. being healed = 16 seconds. BUT for that 16 seconds the other person could be on a gen. 16x2 = 32
---
Controller players cannot compete with mouse keyboard players. They've tried it in several games over the years and the data doesn't lie. Even at the professional gamer level, controllers get slapped around by keyboards 99% of the time. Crossplay doesn't exist because it wouldn't be fair to console players.
---
Then you don‚Äôt even know what his point was.
---
I got this today by sheer luck. Rotten fields is basically a shoe in. The basement is usually in the middle of the map so as long as survivors aren‚Äôt on the periphery you should always get an opportunity if you‚Äôre using iron grasp and agitation.
---
lmfao at the cucks downvoting this, you people wonder why no one likes this community or interacting with anyone on this game and subreddit. im just gonna leave and any info i need ill just watch some streams or something since everyones opinion pretty much just comes from like 5 youtubers.
---
I got a call from the place I work at this morning causing me to literally just stand still during a chase and then quit out...
---
Someone said I was bad for losing the chase after I said I got a call from work twice.
---
I am just trying to start a conversion about this, so please do not take it in a mean way as I do too play both sides.
---
1. This may be true, but there is a much better Nancy teachable that you can run that will heal you way faster than Self Care. I do understand free to play players, but sometimes you have to spend money on this game to get more fun out of it with different perks. Plis a lot of the stuff goes on sale more often than not, so why not grab the dlcs?
---
But it will help you with the solo aspect of the game, as Self Care is way slower and you won't waste as much time healing as other people. Plus you can get this perk to work up to 5 times a match and generally, you only heal about 0-4 times a match, so it is a perfect replacement.
---
2. I do like seeing people using Self Care and all as killer, but in red ranks, you will only see solo players use it about 1 out of every 10 matches and even then you might not ever see them use it during the matches they might have it equipped. So it does not impact the game as much, except that more medkits would be used which frees up a slot so that the killer won't have to worry about stuff like keys and toolboxes. And more people would run perks that help each other for healing, which frees up a slot or more that the killer does not have to worry about.
---
So overall, i do believe getting rid of Self Care would be very beneficial to the game, but I would like to see a replacement perk for Claudette that involves healing in some way, as that is her character's theme.
---
An idea that i just came up with as I was typing this is a perk, with no name yet, that would only take effect 2 times per match, but if the killer is in chase with you for 120 seconds (2 mins), then you are able to heal yourself by 1 health state, whether it would be from injured to healthy or from downed to injured. This action would require 4 seconds to do though and will reset every time it is stopped and the time will not be effected by anything, it will always be 4 seconds.
---
If anyone has any thoughts on my ideas, feel free to share.
---
The last livestream they mentioned plans to change docotr and the whole chat exploded telling them their bad at balancing. It's clear they don't listen and don't care.
---
Your flair is outdated.
---
What were those tips?
---
I got a 4 man with my level 1 plague when I was just doing the infect daily, because of this reason. Also really lucky over the wall vommys.
---
Epstein didn't kill himself
---
When I do doctor daily. I just follow people shocking them until they envitably win. Its annoying, and fun for the whole family.
---
Personally I think he's not only the best but the most entertaining as well. You're talking about a survivor that'll run a killer (no matter the rank) for 5 minutes straight and give hilarious commentary while doing so.
---
stats do not lie. look it up. #1 in escapes, skill checks....saves.....stats dont lie haters. sorry my streamer is better than yours.  Pug is GOAT survivor #shikaka
---
Whenever someone starts watching me I just start messing around. I somehow play better when I'm sitting on top of the table on Mother's Dwelling than when I'm actually trying to run from the killer.
---
This happened to me except bubba kept revving his chainsaw in my face till I went into struggle and then it "glitched"
---
r/forhonor
---
Just run No-Mither you absolute spoons.
---
Never waste time healing again with this perk.
---
Uh I think they are right. Even Rainbow Six Siege, one of the most toxic games I ever played (and it even has friendly fire) is not nearly as toxic as a red rank Nea that gets caught slipping. I‚Äôve had two people make another account after I blocked them just so they could keep harassing me. Xbox support did nothing.
---
Even the other day, I beat a red rank in the endgame and the dude starts throwing party invite after party invite my way. When I don‚Äôt join his party, I proceed to get ‚ÄúJoin.‚Äù 50 times over with the occasional n word and shit.
---
DbD has by far the most toxic community. I never had to deal with any of the above until I started playing this fucking game lol.
---
And that‚Äôs not even talking about the tunneling, t-bagging, bullying new players, etc.
---
Its true though. Waste of a perk slot.
---
What about teachables?
---
Extremely true that Pug is the best survivor main in DbD. However, even when he goes to play Killer, his display is extraordinary. You ever seen that thicc Tum Tums? He has at least a 95% kill rate. Might as well call him the best DbD player full stop.
---
Is that the regular skin for trapper? I don‚Äôt remember that much blood on his arm. Also, lame DCer. Surv mains always DC when their ego is damaged.
---
(We all do it.)[https://youtu.be/i9H2m0mpkn4]
---
For stealth killers like pig and ghostface, try sneaking during a loop. The survivor may get confused trying to guess where you're going
---
Exactly, plus BHVR has said that they want to make it so perks only have 1 tier instead of 3 to unlock in the future. This way people can get all of the perks on a character faster, plus they have a system to give you more perks if you are level 40 or higher on a character, so I think that we are fine for now tbf.
---
Don't forget Wraith.
---
When they nerfed Spirit's post-phase haste, they accidentally applied the same nerf to Wraith's uncloak haste.
---
As a result, it barely speeds him up at all and doesn't amp his lunge.
---
*visible trembling*
---
Lol. Not quite.
---
Thinking that artists who create New skins should work with game code and fix bugs PepegaHammer
---
They gave da like two/three weeks ago
---
yes because we all know that Doctor should be left unchanged for the rest of its life /s.
---
most of the nerfs and changes were asked by players (Nurse rework, Spirit changes, instaheals nerfs) so the "they never listen" critique is stupid. they DO listen, but they don't HAVE TO please everyone, else the patch notes would be a shitshow and nobody would really be happy with balance.
---
the game tends to be killer-sided at low ranks, but starts to get survivor-sided at high ranks. How do you balance around that?
---
Dwight, you son of a bitch.
---
I can freely move my camera while doing that on ps4 at least
---
It‚Äôs xmas day
---
It‚Äôs more complicated cuz it also depends on ranks. On PC, survivors start with a short queue and it gets longer as you rank up, and the killer is the total opposite of that
---
if u stand on the top u will block their command to open it...and vice versa
---
Some of these challenges are just poorly thought out, requiring you to play somewhat unoptimally/stupid for some of them or even get really lucky with some like the "do X with Y perk".
---
Preaching to the choir aside. It would've done people good to play this game. It's not perfect, but there are many things that it got right from day one that are still issues in dbd. It's funny to me when people act like dbd's perfect and f13 is broken on all aspects and then ask for elements that are present in f13.
---
\-"Devs should add a secondary objective besides gens like you need to find gen parts before being able to fix the gen!"  
---
\-"You need to get parts to repair the objectives in F13"   
---
\-"No. Not like f13 that game sucks lol"   
---
\-\*facepalm\*
---
I'm pretty sure it's the regular skin. I'll check and get back to you.
---
okay weirdo, sorry someone downvoted you luv. xoxo
---
His santa pubes jiggle
---
They jiggle when he thinks about survivor‚Äôs tasty fingers
---
&lt;3
---
I noticed this a good month or two ago, Kate's boobs also bounce if you do a quick crouch and uncrouch.
---
I‚Äôd switch out inner strength for unbreakable, just because a killer won‚Äôt be able to slug a DS with it
---
If you get broken early in the game, cleanse at the nearest fountain, then almost immediately get sick again then yes it‚Äôs bad. You have to know when and where to cleanse. 
---
Wait until at least mid-way through the game when some gens have been done and some pallets are broken, and cleanse in a dead area of the map. This way you put some pressure on the Plague with finished gens, and you force her to choose between pressuring survivors and active gens and going away from everything to get her power. 
---
Cleansing isn‚Äôt always bad, but cleansing at a bad time out of desperation is pretty much always handing the win to the Plague. Like everything else in the game you have to do it strategically.
---
Actually its not do hard, did it on Residence as mayers, 2 attempts
---
after losing 5 lerys offerings with ghostface i finally took them off and completed it in a corn map of all places. With the dark senses I got lucky and was working on a generator when the last one went off on the other side of the map which somehow for whatever reason counts, so as long as you are working on 3 that pop, someone else can finish the last so long as you are working on a generator at that time.
---
Reverse bear traps only kill on exit Gates of they're active, so if you have any traps after all gens are done they're useless
---
If anyone is looking for advice against Plague, I can share a couple of things since I‚Äôve been investing a lot of time into her. If you‚Äôre going to cleanse, do it in areas that Plague has no reason to go to other than getting corrupt. This means dead zones and areas with no objectives (gens/gates). It‚Äôs a lot harder for her to capitalize on corrupt if she has to go across the map to get it. Also if one person cleanses, everyone should immediately cleanse, and as soon as you get sick you should cleanse. Plague gets corrupt once all the fountains are corrupted. This means she might get it when outside of chase or nowhere near any survivors, again, making it harder for her to capitalize on it. As long as you remain strategic with your cleansing. Also keep in mind that Plague loses Corrupt Purge is she gets pallet stunned (and maybe other stubs but I‚Äôm not entirely sure). This isn‚Äôt stated anywhere in her power description or on her wiki page.
---
Traps only kill at the exit Gates if they're beeping
---
Why teabag?
---
I actually finished all of it earlier today, so I feel quite accomplished. Now I'm taking a short break so I don't lose my sanity lol
---
Imagine having that stuff on 4 people against only 1 person using BBQ and Ruin, even though we survivors get many chances throughout the game to live like with keys, exhaustion perks, and perks that give us second chances. Sounds unfair for the 4 people, am I right? I mean, just imagine having to learn to hit Ruin skillchecks! That is just too difficult for people to have to do, so killers shouldn't ever run Ruin, so that the survivors can be jerks at the end after they complete the objectives faster than a killer can end a chase.
---
Also, I do not mind tunneling at all throughout the game, but I do believe that as a killer and survivor player, that you should not camp unless it is at the end of the game and you have lost miserably and want to secure a kill. Then I do believe that you have all right to do so, but then again, people have spent their own money on it, so they can play it anyway they want to.
---
I hate you with a burning passion now. It took me like 20 games to get a competent team and a potato killer so I could do this
---
You used to be able to flick and hit people on some pallets in a chase. Now you pretty much cant use it on loops anymore so you just eat the pallets until your power runs out
---
Exactly how I got this challenge.  Took several attempts due to rage quits and people DCing before final hook to deny the challenge, but finally got it.
---
Eugh, teabag.
---
She was reworked recently. Changes include making Prayer Beads emit the phasing sound everywhere outside her terror radius and adding a vault animation.
---
Survivors recently have had a sense of entitlement. I get more hate mail for running Ruin and NOED when I kill a squad. But rarely when I play a survivor does a killer message me complaining about DS, flashlights, or a lot of meta perks. The complaints, imo playing both sides, have come from survivors complaining that I player scummy. This shows that the game has a slight advantage to survivors.
---
Now I only need 3 more survivors for my lobby, I've been waiting five decades for this match to start.
---
their msgs are probably off bc of salty ppl msging them so.
---
It actually loses time of potential gen repairing because more often the survivor is not close to you and you have to run to the hook from a far, all that for them to unhook infront of your face
---
2k Iri shards (2.7k if first time a perk is on the shrine), not 9k.  9k is just buying a new character.  For new killers especially you generally wanna skip the perk if you can buy direct, this is quite worth it as you get the perks for 8.1k, and spend 900 Iri shards for the killer themself for a different playstyle.
---
Not worth at all for the survivors to buy, though, unless you really like their looks.
---
Game‚Äôs perfect.
---
That would be interesting.
---
First hook, you wander around, everything is a bit chill, and if you attempt escape, it can have a running animation of you breaking through the fog and you jump off the hook.
---
Second hook, you wander ar- JUST KIDDING THE ENTITY IS PISSED! STRUGGLE! STRUGGLE! STRUGGLE!
---
woah there buckaroo, although I agree this game is 90% of the time a huge frustration circle jerk filled with assholes; you cant just SAY it out loud! people dont like it when the game they defend as though they made it themselves stumble across someone who is frustrated, theyll take it personally!
---
you can do this on xbox too! its a nice trick to know when ur trying to snack too
---
God dammit
---
Wow I like the icy trapper, wish we had these on console. Or a winter event.
---
Most likely. Whenever I encounter a tunnelling/camping killer, their messages are almost always off. Especially in red ranks.
---
The projectile vomit has a certain velocity that causes it not to fall over walls that are close together very well; I believe you can also see this in actual function if you are crouching next to the Plague (unless they changed it).
---
Unlike Huntress, she can't aim it as freely, and a proper stream to dose an area with red vomit is going to slow her/take awhile.
---
Oh, ok and for the red one instead?
---
Until you start loading the map and someone DC‚Äôs
---
weird how ppl dont like random angry strangers sending hateful msgs lmfao
---
I‚Äôve had this issue frequently in the past; I also play on console. I think it‚Äôs the game &amp; it‚Äôs servers cuz you can play solo and you‚Äôll most likely find a game waaay faster than you ever did while searching with friends.
---
LMAO. You're not wrong. Most of this community (on Reddit) is extremely sensitive and I have no idea why. You give any constructive criticism, downvoted. You vent you anger on a match you just experienced, downvoted.
---
Basement trapper is more fun/funny imo. Legit had everyone run into traps to get that one person from the basement and laughed at their foolishness. Basement trapper is one of the strongest (and most terrifying) thing a non coordinated (and sometimes even coordinated) team can go against
---
Very weird indeed
---
das hot
---
Yeah this keeps happening to me and others I see in games recently, it‚Äôs so annoying.
---
Laughs in Basement Demogorgon
---
and yes do feel free to comment about the bubba's basement build
---
Saying you know its annoying doesnt somehow make it okay to post. Do everyone a favour and delete your post and never make another one
---
good job getting them all tho!
---
Playing solo right now and finding games pretty easily
---
thank you, could've gotten them all but the last guy hid and I couldn't find him
---
Dwighlight*
---
This is actually intended by the devs. 
---
There is chance the rank 2 are rank 3 or were rank 3 when the match started, which would put them 6 ranks from yours. 
---
"This is unacceptable". 
---
Well, they can't make things stricter because of queue times.
---
Reporting the thread so mods delete it ASAP because there is nothing wrong with your matchmaking on top of being against sub rules.
---
It's generally easier to be downed when she can one-hit you with an M1 (she still does move 115% and can bloodlust you) since part of the reason most survivors even reach a safe pallet/loop while repairing is due to riding the post-hit speed boost.
---
And even if you're really good and reach one despite being injured and loud and puking and loud on a generator that is loud, you also have to loop it properly without any margin for error, so it really depends on how strong the tileset is (and that there are tilesets that can loop the killer for 5 gens is a whole other issue).
---
I prefer to cleanse, you can wait out her corrupt if she decides to walk over to where you cleansed (by completed generators in a far corner) and waste that much time, or just find properly packed walls that her vomit doesn't fall over very well.
---
killer is so fun to play fo to the challenge and well kill people but those queue times are too big, I am literally right now searching for a killer match and didn't find yet in like 5 minutes and that's a shit
---
Exactly my thoughts on that challenge. To get it you need to be bad at the game and just get lucky at the end. I either spread the damage too much to get everyone hooked twice and all 4 survivors were alive at the end, or I did too well and killed everyone before endgame.
---
You can still do the flick, the timing of it is just different
---
yeah, i understand, it doesn't have the same unpredictability as when you're in an actual match (imo)
---
Why do you need to select it?
---
His dad owns bhvr
---
I have no idea mate
---
Thank you so much, this is exactly what killer mains have to deal with and it's so fucking irritating it's like BRO I know you have DS but it can hurt to not pick them up just as much as it can to pick them up, if you slug them it doesn't take long for their teammates to come and one tap them and get straight back on gens. And because gens time are so fast the time they spend on the ground doesn't make up for their 3 teammates rushing the shit out of gens. Literally the only counter right now for DS is to play clown and throw all 4 (7 at max with add-ons) bottles and block off every path so no matter where they go you will catch them quickly. They should have never nerfed enduring if they were gonna make DS this strong it was literally a buff not a nerf or a rework. Hell even for pallets it's not 75% stun resistance anymore it's 50%. Yes killers have gotten plenty of QoL improvements recently (I remember years ago when pallet vacuums were a thing and before exhaustion perks stopped recovering when you run) and I think for the most part they are in a better spot but the way DS and BT work where you literally get punished for killing fast and killing more than one person at a time killers are actually even harder now. I'd rather have enduring to make DS and pallet stuns 75% faster and not have to worry about DS with non obsession when hooks were nearby then knowing everyone gets a free invulnerability period. Yes it is good to spread pressure but you need to get someone out of the game early right? Trying to outhink 4 survivors and out chase them and their godloops is hard enough so limiting it to 3 is paramount. 1 guy going for the save 1 guy on the hook and 1 doing gens. Maybe then you can afford to actually spread your pressure more and keep a rotation but 4 people is a whole different story.
---
Claudette looks like she has seen some shit.
---
Finally, I have them all.
---
I hate that so much, leave the jiggle physics with Jane
---
Legit everything DBD related(This reddit,Console players, pc players, streamers)
---
Is sensitive and dont give a shit about others
---
Everytime i get on to play killer(I play as fair as i can sometimes giving the last surv hatch)and i still get at least 5 messages a day telling me to kill myself or something
---
And i try to explain to others what happened but they legit dont care
---
Cause BHVR hates making challenges easy
---
Yeah I understand your pain
---
real gamers would have sat in it until the match was over ü§°ü§°ü§°
---
It'd be way better if it was just sacrifice 3 people in the basement in one game. The forth guy either DC's or gets hatch. I don't think I've ever gotten 4 sacrifices in the basement even before the challenge.
---
The dark sense one wasn't *to bad*. You don't have to do entire gens, just be on the gen as it pops. I was in a two man swf and I got it in 2 games.
---
Even if the challenges are ass, if it was automatically procc‚Äôd if you complete the objective, nobody would complain nearly as much
---
Quite a lot of perks need buffs. Here are some ideas I have.
---
Safe:
---
This is Not Happening - make the bonus 10% bigger for each tier, and either make it apply when healthy too, or double progression when injured. (2% to 4)
---
Deja Vu- quicker repair speed to revealed gens, OR reveal aura of your worked gen to other survivors.
---
Lucky Break - Longer times, and reduce scratch marks as well. Way too weak for what it actually does, Iron Will is far more powerful of an effect and has no timer,
---
Second Wind - proc on 50% of a survivor heal, and work with medkits.
---
Camaraderie- Works on first hook too
---
Technician- At tier 3, gens never blow up, and silences work noise for your buddies on the same gen as you.
---
Ambitious:
---
Babysitter: Earn a bat as an item after getting safe unhooks and healing survivors for a good amount of heals. Can hit and stun the killer, causes exhaustion and hindered
---
olidarity- Save charges when healing other when injured, next time you‚Äôre injured, you‚Äôll passively heal for a set amount.
---
Just some ideas for perks I really enjoy using
---
The way I see it is whoever gets to the hatch first wins, but the surv still has a faint chance if they get lucky. 
---
With egc the important thing is that the game ends in 2-3 minutes. That means that after the hatch is closed the survivor has to make a move. Before egc the surv could wait 10 minutes if he wanted until the killer started to patrol. 
---
If the survs lost the game it would be over quick. If the killer lost the game he had to forcefully make all the survivors leave. Now the survs have to leave on their own. The late game depth was just needlessly making the game longer, wasn‚Äôt very fun.
---
idk, on console i just made another acc. yeah I was more experienced but then i was stuck with one perk and 0 items until i got bps and stuff. i guess some could argue it doesn't change much, but ü§∑ what else can you really do, idk. doing it that way helped my friend get a lot better, i didn't do much but coach through the matches. we both now sit at ranks 7/8 (on the new acc + her acc) after only a few weeks ! sorry if this upset anyone and sorry if it didn't rlly help, its just what i did
---
Sneak 100
---
We‚Äôll make it would be more fun if your unhooked teammate didn‚Äôt run to the corner of the map immediately after being unhooked instead of healing under the hook with we‚Äôll make it.
---
Emergency (Green) Medkits:
---
Charges reduced from **24** to **16**.
---
Speed bonus at which you heal **others** increased from **35%** to **50%**
---
Speed bonus at which you heal **yourself** increased from **0%** to **50%**
---
Item efficiency (charge consumption reduction) removed entirely.
---
You used to be able to stick 28 extra charges on (52 total) and get 13 as a "bonus" from the 25% efficiency for four full heals without a perk (4.0625 heals) which allowed you to keep the medkit as well with a sliver remaining without even needing to hit a great.
---
Ranger medkits only do like 3.6 heals with the same addons without perks.
---
Now emergency medkits only do like 2.6 heals with the addons (+16 and +12) instead of 4, and only 1 heal without (instead of 1.5).
---
Botany Knowledge alone was enough to get 2 heals out of a green medkit, now it isn't.
---
So they lost the ability to get 4 full heals without being expended, and lost 1.4 heals total with the addons; then again they did get other buffs, and syringes no longer remove charges (previously you wouldn't ever run a syringe with a green medkit, now you can do both). They heal you faster than they used to, so they are more solo-friendly...
---
Friday the 13's license rights is a fucking nightmare so I don't think Jason is coming anytime soon, I think the next killer is that woman mentioned on the archives
---
i play killer occasionally / for dailies / for rift, but other than that, im a survivor main. i don't get as mad as i do when im a survivor ig, and i honestly like hitting skillchecks LOL
---
dang she thicc tho üò≥
---
okay this is wholesome fuck
---
2 ranks away from expected matchamking and you still complain.
---
Would you rather not play at all because there isn't a killer the same rank as yours? Or this could be the case for the killer, not enough survivors so you got thrown there. 
---
Waiting for your reply.
---
for all I know, 3 of those guys could've been rank 1s, 8 ranks between the killer and majority of the survivors is little bit over the hard limit no?
---
You seem upset!
---
The matchmaking in this game generally sucks, but I'd wager that one of your members has strict NAT which drastically reduces the possible hosts you can connect to.
---
*My proudest

Learning to mind game as demo is really useful. If survivors see you charging up your shred they will usually try to zigzag and this will make them slow down making it easy to hit a regular m1 instead. Mastering shred distance will separate the pro demos from the noobs. Stbfl is also a great perk to run due to being able to hit obsession with shred and no stacks lost. As for portals, I like placing about 3 near gens and holding the rest in order to teleport on command.Hope this helps good luck
---
This has happened to me as the person with the key. Consider:
---
\- Maybe I'm injured
---
\- Maybe the killer can instadown and I don't want to risk it
---
\- Maybe the killer has spotted me so it was leave or get downed.
---
\- Maybe I don't want to stray too far from the hatch, so that if I take a hit I can still make it back in time
---
\-  Maybe I don't have any perks that can help me find teammates, like Bond or Empathy
---
\- From a purely points/pipping point of view, there is zero benefit for me to bring others along.
---
\- Maybe I didn't like my teammates. If they let me reach struggle on first hook, or didn't heal me after unhook even though it's safe, or accidentally sandbagged me once, I'd probably just leave them to die and maybe have a laugh while spectating.
---
Wtf is expected matchmaking
---
This game does favor survivors indeed, but I do enjoy both sides, whether with friends or not, and tbh this is the only game besides Bloodborne that i have put many hours into and enjoy playing a lot.
---
But yes, I do get way more hate mail as killer. Before they changed Nurse, I played a round of No Blink Nurse cause I was bored that day and wanted to be give some people a laugh. So I get Gas Haven and immediately find a P3 Claudette with a flashlight trying to get my attention, so i chase her and they all find my Ruin within 30 seeconds of the start of the match, but luckily I got my first got because she didn't realize I was playing No Blink so she ran right into me. We chase for 3 gens and I get her downed next tocbasement in the gas station and as I start to leave, I get a message from the Claudette that I am bad at playing Nurse and should go kms. So I tell them I am doing No Blinka and she responds with, "I don't care, No Blink is retarded and you should just play normally instead of being a pussy and just chasing me normally with Nurse."
---
This changed my tone that i had for the rest of the match, because this person was litterally yelling at me for handing them a free win. So i camped her and her friends tried saving her, but I knocked 2 of them down as the third got Claud off of the go ok, but with my STBFL I got Claud downed after I proc'd her borrowed time and she ds'd me so I chased her again and downed her cause I mindgamed her aorund the truck in the garage of the gas station lol. 
---
Put her in basement as they were all coming out and she was now on her second hook. Then I started chasing another person around the gas station and downed them with ease, so I put them in the basement as they the rest of them were finishing generators. Then I go over to a gate to stop it from opening, but I see someone rush towards the basement so that is where I went, I used Bamboozle on the window and hit the healthy person down with NOED before they could unhook Claudette, but the other one got away with BT. So they both died and the game ended.
---
After that, the Claudette kept spam inviting me to a party(PS4) after they kept calling me trash and a dumbass for wanting to have fun with "your trash ass build". So i joined and they there all 4 of the survivors were that were in my match, they were an swf group, but only the Claudette ever talked.
---
They told me that they wanted me to join a kyf game so that we can redo the round and show me how much of a trash ass killer I am and how I should just quit this game, because I am so bad. I said "no" and the guy flipped and started cussing me out, so i just left and enjoyed the rest of my day knowing that i made someone salty over playing No Blink Nurse. Best day ever on DBD.
---
These are all fun, but Last Fight shouldn‚Äôt exist; that would be way too annoying with a SWF abusing BT. Perk 3 should give some Hinderance for a bit because that would also be gamed hard. I like Cold Blood, but it would lead to ridiculous Hope + Breakout late game builds where the Survivor is faster than the killer. But it‚Äôs definitely the most balanced.
---
This is blindingly accurate üòÇ
---
&gt;Wtf is expected matchmaking
---
So you don't even know how matchmaking works but decides to post this useless thread anyway? This community in a nutshell.
---
Thank god I am forever alone and play solo  B)
---
Finds a match in like 3 minutes or less
---
‚Äúwell would you rather not enjoy the game you play, or not play the game you enjoy‚Äù why do i have to choose?? 99% of other online games that do ranking have NO problem getting fair games.
---
BHVR: So we know matchmaking is broken and we're leaving for our break without fixing it (they said this in the stream)
---
Also BHVR: So if you want to leave a match early because it's unfair we're now gonna test our system of forcing you to not play any other matches.
---
Like...I get they need to test disconnect penalties, but they should've waited until after they fixed matchmaking.
---
I didn't try to "master race" anything
---
I just know a LOT of console games have autoaim because you can't be as precise as a mouse
---
If this was a PC only game my money says autoaim wouldn't have been added
---
Which by the way it wasn't, until it got ported
---
You‚Äôve literally just made that phrase up mate
---
Mm... no thanks.
---
You can try but the mods don‚Äôt really care much, these late game screen shots of ‚Äúmuh matchmaking‚Äù have been here a while unfortunately
---
Whiny bitch
---
never heard that phrase before, and its not expected bc the matching isnt CONSISTENT enough to expect ANYTHING
---
This honestly would be so nice. While trying to do the dark sense challenge yesterday I had so many matches where I easily could've gotten the "leave the game without being hooked using spine chill" on at least 4 different occasions.
---
Can you explain how I‚Äôm two ranks away from expected matchmaking then.
---
(even though you‚Äôve just made that up)
---
I only got it because lobbies are so bad and buggy that I am rank 7 getting put in rank 18 lobbies.
---
Yes its better to all go down and be hooked than using shack pallet.
---
Rank means absolutely nothing of survivor skill, only how frequently they play. Emblem system is way too lenient on them; meanwhile it‚Äôs very strict on Killers, and a rank 1 killer should be feared. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why you think it‚Äôs  such a crime, you did well, get over it. Unless you love long queue times it just will happen. You will lose some games, absolutely nothing wrong with that.
---
ive literally saved up so many shards p u r e l y for waiting for head on
---
Is English your first language?
---
&gt;‚Äúwell would you rather not enjoy the game you play, or not play the game you enjoy‚Äù why do i have to choose?? 99% of other online games that do ranking have NO problem getting fair games.
---
99%? [x] Doubt. There are quite a few games out there that suffer from matchmaking issues despite having a huge player base. They might not be as common as in DBD but they aren't impossible either. 
---
But, ignoring your delusional number and back to DBD: 
---
Other online games don't have a 1 to 4 lobby. 
---
Other online games don't have 20 ranks to separate their players.
---
Other online games don't have SWF and killers requesting the devs to make their party search for the highest member, which removes lower ranked players in their group from the rank 20 to 10 player pool.
---
But most importantly, other games have ten times the number of players DBD has and that still doesn't stop them from having issues in lower populated regions or time of day.
---
Guys I want them really badly too but they are made for mobile which is lower quality graphically they would look silly upscaled ... also can we not just be thankful we got things for free? Does it matter I mean sure they look awesome but we have A LOT that mobile does not have count ourselves lucky and have a good Christmas guys! Haha ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
This is true, but.......you have to admit that there are some killers loadouts, add-ons, offerings, or maps that really give the killer a big advantage, which is what you see when you play both sides.
---
For example, Freddy with his old gen slowing add-ons with Ruin, Pop Goes, Discordnance, and more to make the game really boring and more killer sided if you cannot complete objectives as fast as people are getting downed.
---
A good Huntress with Iri Head on a small map can be devastating as well. Or even an infinite tier 3 Myers(is not that hard to counter, just be smart about it) or an outright ability to kill just by using your power. And there are more, but this ends my point anyways.
---
but you have to b u y bubba
---
I am!!!! :(
---
?? weird comment but go off, sorry for trying to defend you lmfaooooo
---
Oops sorry! I thought you were the original guy. I read your comment in the context of what he was saying that‚Äôs why I was so confused.
---
It makes sense now.
---
Not a bad idea if a cocky survivor thinks they get away with the unhook tech.
---
When you on a hook and dream about escaping.
---
Ma‚Äôam this is a wendy‚Äôs
---
&gt;You can try but the mods don‚Äôt really care much, these late game screen shots of ‚Äúmuh matchmaking‚Äù have been here a while unfortunately
---
Its holidays and mods is a voluntary work so its understandable. We can only hope that these get removed quickly. Some times they do, often times they stay here a while.
---
Here's another one: bear traping every inch of the hooked survivor
---
Sir this is a wendy‚Äôs
---
oh okay, sorry!
---
That‚Äôs just how red ranks are lol. Merry Xmas to you too.
---
I'm currently in rank 4 and I notice that I got killers' from rank 8-13 more frequently than before. Maybe one week ago, I usually got the killers' from the rank 1-6 though.
---
me tooooooo
---
Ohh, I love the idea of pushing through the fog
---
keep defending a part of the game that even the devs, on a live stream, thats public, that you can watch, that you can listen to, that clearly states, that they, are in fact, aware that their matchmaking sucks
---
But they even give adrenaline to a hooked survivor after unhook *roll eyes*
---
i bet you‚Äôre a real fun guy to have at parties
---
&gt;Sir this is a wendy‚Äôs
---
No idea what this means but ok.
---
i dont think you understand that its not my JOB to read everything the devs do. if i am experiencing something that a lot of other people experience, how are you going to tell me im wrong? that just sounds pretentious but im glad you think of yourself as someone whos so much smarter than a core group of the people who play the game.
---
Why is your interface white and not gray  ? Ew.com
---
Depends on how you used the Mori tbh. Moris and keys are items that need to be nerfed. If you tunneled someone off hook then yeah fuck you but if not fuck them type situations.
---
ahaha ! it's my xmas treat to you :)
---
Really depends on how the mori was used, same goes for the flashlight and key (using coldwinds or map offerings in general is a pretty good way for lots of killers to hate you).
---
If you tunnel right off the hook for the mori, you are a dick.
---
If they use the flashlight to click at you or use their key to get an escape right in your face, then they are dicks.
---
yeah !
---
He means that if you wanted to buy Oni for 9000 shards, you could consider the price as 2700*3 shards for his teachables, and 900 shards for his playstyle.
---
Yep, tasty 5k points delivered very soon
---
Well i wanted to do a selfie with Clown, and i couldn't use any licensed characters. For the choice of the killer, i really wanted to show all the original killers (Trapper, Nurse, Billy and Wraith) but also the most recent one, and since Legion was already on one i decided to go for Plague as i thought it would be funny to make her use a camera and do something really modern as she is the oldest killer in the game :)
---
Sorry I forgot I made the game, look how many people complain or get macros.
---
It‚Äôs not what we asked for but it‚Äôs what we needed ü•µ
---
Yeah :) wasn't allowed to draw him due to licence but he is still here in our heart &lt;3
---
thx ! :)
---
DCs while on basement hook is even more frustrating.
---
The thing that hurt the most is that they said after these changes to Legion which the devs state weren't a nerf, they have no plans to touch Legion for a while even after admitting that they are below mid tier in terms of effectiveness.
---
Probably would be stuck in the back giving juice for the xmas lights xD
---
&lt;3 thank you :)
---
yeah sorry XD
---
yup he is &lt;3
---
I‚Äôd want it only for the shits and giggles cause having someone like Freddy or foxy chase me sounds hilarious
---
I'm not yet at the second one, but the first (3 gens) I got first try:
---
just solo'd 3 gens from zero to 100% while my team mates were being noobs (so nothing new there)
---
4 seems insane though
---
:(
---
ahah
---
thank you &lt;3
---
Aw hell yeah, finally gonna get Devour Hope.
---
thank you ! &lt;3
---
thanks :)
---
At least 7 Auric Cells.
---
anw &lt;3 i love how i created new standard for people ahahah
---
It's good if you get headaches from base FOV.
---
With Plague ? :3
---
Merry Xmas :)
---
at least you can see all types of the hooks in one image)
---
ahah yeah Santa Clown endured way worse than some vomit
---
She is good, but she's also really boring playstyle wise imo.
---
"So what do you do for a job?"
---
"I'm a programmer at BHVR and I animate bouncing titties for a survival horror game"
---
*slowly moves away*
---
it's been like that for a while, also idk why any sane person would think it'd be ok to have the traps work like they did before with the EGC being a thing now.
---
The bigger problem was her dash getting the same treatment of "well it's technically not a basic attack, so it won't work with any on-hit perks anymore."
---
In fact she got many more buffs than nerfs lately, especially compared to Legion and Oni. Her RNG power is still just hit or miss regardless.
---
I get the idea, but do people really bring an Ebony and NOED together actually expecting to still reach the end game?
---
For me the green one is totally fine (but shouldn't work if you tunnel), just the pink one is too OP
---
You might be thinking of the fuming cordage, the common swamp addon.
---
The numbers for them were ridiculous when they existed though. Common had a modifier of 2, uncommon had 5, while rare has 9999.
---
Is that lightborn or shadowborn?
---
should've been around last year. used to be that anytime you'd get unhooked period you'd rubberband back to the hook. it was impossible to play most of the time.
---
Exactly I've done nothing wrong
---
they will get a cosmetic item that is exclusive to the dlc pack, that is all.
---
a majority of the dlcs come with both a surv and a killer.
---
&gt;can swap out adrenaline for adrenaline
---
Yes, it is. 
---
Being broken all game is not a big deal if you know how to loop and utilise perks that synergize with being injured (Iron will, sprint burst, dead hard. NOT SELF-CARE, that perk is absolute garbage). 
---
Low-rank survivors who are terrified of being injured and hearing the heartbeat love to cleanse, fucking over the team. When you get to red-ranks you see nobody cleanses because we've all already agreed that the best plan. You will realize being injured isn't that big of a deal when the killer takes 1-2 minutes chasing you just to hit you once. (Again, for this to work you have to actually be good at survivor and be able to loop. So it's the low-rank survivors who like to cleanse since they can't loop).
---
When you refuse to cleanse, the Plague loses her power and becomes a literal M1 machine who has nothing. Plus, she is very tall and so its easier to win mind games against her.
---
ahh i was hoping they would probably get auric cells as compensation if they have the killer or survivor already.
---
With playing like a dick I mean basement trapper. I admit it's a scummy playstyle but it's the only way to do the challenge :'(
---
But if you cleanse you're losing map pressure since you are not doing a generator. You will have to also run away from a gen, find the shrine, cleanse, then run back to the other side of the map. All of this could be fixed by you just sticking to a generator and pushing through.
---
The red-rank mindset is this - survivors exist is TWO states.
---
State 1.) They are buying time (Looping the killer, unhooking teammates, picking up downed survivors).
---
State 2.) They are doing generators.
---
When it comes to other objectives, like breaking totems, looting chests, being immersed, self-caring, and cleansing a shrine - you don't meet either state. You are not buying time, and you are not doing a generator. Therefore it can be easily argued you are giving away map pressure as you are not fulfilling the survivor role.
---
Something that only works if you wiggle out of the killer's grasp, which means you only get one 'guaranteed' use out of it if you happen to activate Decisive Strike with it, or have a teammate make a pallet/flashlight/head on save. Using this instead of sprint burst or any other exhaustion perk (Because you'd have already used them during the chase, potentially) would be the worst move you could make.  
---
Sounds like a trash perk you couldn't use in solo and would just make the gap between SWF and solo even more sweaty.
---
BT and Devour Hope on the same shrine feels evil.
---
The Entity might have had a hand in this
---
Yep. Her vomit is a stream of particles, for the want of a better term, and for every one of them that hits you, you'll gain infection progress. 
---
It's explained very well [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOxpBwyhz-w). Your Plague play will get a significant boost when you fully understand when you want to fully charge the vomit, and when you want to just spit and run.
---
Some people DC after being downed first, so I don't think these people are trying to unhook themelves
---
I was a rank 8 playing against rank 19's
---
&gt; That's exactly the reason why this battle pass bs doesn't suit this game. Challenges such as these are completely broken with **how the game is played in reality.**
---
That's the actual problem. Most of the challenges were fine, but some of the challenges rewarded gameplay that the majority of the community has considered unfun for a while, to say nothing of how unbalanced they make gameplay. 
---
I normally hate when people say "don't devs play their own game," and I'm not sure I'm quite ready to go that far with this game, but these challenges definitely reinforce my desire for the devs to be a lot more clear about their design philosophy for several aspects of the game, most importantly camping, tunneling, and the basement.
---
Olay, so would you mind explaining what makes a survivor "toxic" then?
---
I get killer matches legit instantly like 2 seconds and survivor in 3mins
---
For me its EU PS4 killer is always instant you cannot even do your loadout whilst searching
---
Basic math tells you that 6 unhook attemps with an 8% chance only equals 40% chance of getting off.
---
.92 (chance of staying on the hook)^6 = 60% staying hooked
---
I read that in Zepp's voice lol
---
It's still 92% chance staying on the hook. Each try is still only an 8% chance.
---
Hitting you with a hatchet isn't cheating
---
But it was across the map!!
---
Bruh watch YouTube watch what they be doin
---
Survive With Friends
---
Wait till you have to pallet stun the killers. That challenge makes my blood boil so much. All the killers i found either thinks im a toxic survivor or they just evade my stuns and respecting all the pallets. Its hell i tell you.
---
How I felt when I got Freddy's perks a whole agoü§£
---
Damn, people really feelin that fucking spirit of christmas
---
Devour Hope is paid DLC perk.
---
Various firecrackers. A one use item that you drop on the floor to try and blind the killer. it can also blind any survivor looking at it from close range when it explodes.
---
But it does not feel casual. If you rank up without noticing it just gets harder and makes you play even more... sweaty? You cannot go back in the ranks, just to do challenges without screwing you team. I actually enjoy the rift story telling and would like to get them without all the sweat.
---
Ahhh Thank you
---
OFC they could make a new game mode or casual that isn't ranked I suppose. As I see it there are a few issues with it. First of all rank doesn't matter as anyone can get to any rank by just understanding how emblems work, but I can see how some take it more seriously cause of the rank, and that is competently individual. Second issue is that queue times are kinda long for killer (maybe that's just me), so by making a new game mode the queue times become even longer, I remember back in the good ol' days of March 2017 when I bought the game, I queued up and were on the map barely 1-2 min later, know it can take ages for me to find a game, and I am not a fan of waiting longer. But if DBD would get even more players or the queues just became a lot more stable I see no problem in adding a game mode for people who are afraid of losing rank or just want a casual alternative.
---
(as killer)
---
Aimbot time
---
It's invalid either way, people are allowed to use whatever perks they want regardless of what their opposition thinks of them.
---
i completely agree, id love to get more into the actual story of the game without feeling like getting a small paragraph equated to me playing like an asshole to other people and vise-versa
---
Welcome to the most useless comment in history!
---
[Tell me about it](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/509863877253660682/657965046428860434/unknown.png)
---
They nerfed his flick from 180 degrees (counterplay is not being anywhere near him) to 30 degrees (counterplay is turn any corner and he will never hit you)
---
Patch notes 3.1.0 I believe it was. 
---
Matchmaking for Ranks 20 through to 17 are *turned off* to speed up cue times for them, as finding a match can take up to half an hour at Rank 20.
---
Can someone link me this weeks? can‚Äôt find it
---
Am i the only one who hears all of their night shrouds deactivating in my head
---
To be clear, two Blinks will mean you travel further - but it also means a "stock" Nurse will be able to do almost nothing on arrival, and the time you lose at that point is arguably greater than any gain you made by burning through all the Blinks.
---
If you use one Blink for travel then there's always the *chance* of using the second Blink for a hit if you happen to bump into someone when you arrive.
---
yeah cause all the killers complain here lol. A SWF has a advanatge but a solo team is pretty even imo. Most solo red rank games for me personally are fucking painful. I dont see how survivors complaining means they have a slight advantage.
---
Y'all be complaining about anything now, huh
---
I miss that event with the lantern. I hope they do something like that again sometime
---
Daaaamn, a 4k even at your rank against reds isn't too bad, though. You mori'd but still decently impressive unless your true rank is higher than that.
---
People sometimes forget there‚Äôs not a malicious robot behind the killer‚Äôs screen.
---
Walk around the whole game working with at least one person. Don‚Äôt work on one by yourself. I got it first try like this
---
‚ÄúI cry‚Äù
---
I got my 4K in basement and 5 basement hooks in a match both on Hawkins lab. Must be my lucky map.
---
Ebonies, learn English you tard.
---
There's always that one guy.
---
People were complaining that they were busy during holidays so they start the "xmas event" with double bloodpoints on the 2nd january
---
I know this sounds far fetched, but what if they released a new survivor with this idea, and made it a teachable perk? something not too overpowered, considering you would lose the ability to make call outs anyway if you were playing with friends, but it would be a way to implement the idea without a complete game redesign!
---
  
---
Personally, the struggle phase has always been a "Filler phase" in my opinion. yeah, it was cool at first but now everyone is setting macros and looking at memes until they have been unhooked. what I'm saying is maybe to keep it balanced, rather than every time you get hooked, only when a survivor is on the second hook, or reaches the second phase could you be taken to that "Plain", which could potentially create a type of lore for the second phase of the hook?
---
With this idea, you could create a character where all their Perks work with this idea of some type of Inter-dimensional traveler
---
With perks such as:
---
1. Brink of time: Upon reaching Phase two on the hook, you travel to an alternate plane
---
   There could be multiple ideas for what you could do in the plain, maybe something that grants tokens, so when returning you have some sort of buff you carry with you, such as cleansing plants, doing some sort of Interdimensional Objective
---
2.   Out of body: Some type of token perk
---
if you complete some type of action, such as Maybe stunning the killer, doing gens, or something, you are granted a token. something like 1/2/3 tokens where when you are hooked on struggle phase, you last maybe 3 seconds longer per token, giving potentially 9 extra seconds to fulfill your objectives within the alternate plain. While also still being a valid perk on its own
---
3.   Witch Hunt: Gain a buff
---
Cleansing a Lit hex totem gives a token? something either 1/1/1 or 1/1/2 based on what the buff could be. something like cleansing the totem reveals you to the killer for 5 seconds, then gain maybe 1% faster actions per token like spine chill gives.
---
Now obviously the perk ideas and names are temporary, but with all these perks combined they all should somewhat pair with perk #1 sending you into the other realm, What you do in that realm and how long you sit on that hook in phase 2 would potentially set to tempo on that "last life" of your game. you could get tunneled immediately and it wouldn't matter. or you could use as much time as you can on your second hook while your hanging to potentially pull yourself back into the game.
---
The biggest idea with those perks is the use of tokens, totems, and perks that work by themselves, but when paired together, create a functional build. 
---
I want all the critique you can offer because I am a survivor main, so it is difficult for me to consider Balancing, But this gives something else to do than slam your face on your spacebar knowing your teammates aren't coming to help you.
---
When I try kobeing like that I do it more as a meme, don't really care about the points
---
Not 360s themselves but the fact that they‚Äôre awful when combined with the tiny FOV and weirdness of melee attacks.
---
I do like existing!
---
This also happened to me, the first time I managed to do it for some reason it didn't register. Grinded it out and it registered the second time thank god.
---
Think your seeing things?
---
Now what about ghost face because I play him and honestly it‚Äôs quite straight forward but he‚Äôs a viable killer.
---
&gt;I've been playing Single Player to try and get all the challenges done (success there, just 5 more levels to go until I can never play that mode again), and this game has got to be one of the most toxic ones I've ever played. Killers at higher levels use the same strategy everytime and it's practically unavoidable.
---
No shit. Like anyone would use the best strategies to win, it goes for any game
---
&gt;Even if you're a great survivor and run the killer for multiple gens, there isn't anything that you can do against being camped and tunneled.
---
That's so wrong at so many levels. Camping? Killer get punished by emblem system and by the other survivors who's doing gens. Tunnelled? DS exist and BT as well so if you do any of these mindlessly, you lose as a killer
---
You have to punish people mistakes and if your team just bomb rush the hook everytime, I'm not gonna leave asap but patrol the area for example
---
&gt;I just played a game where I was on the hook and a survivor came and got me off immediately after I was hooked. Killers on this subreddit keep saying it's a legitimate strategy to target the rescued survivor but all events that transpired after the hook are out of my control. The same goes for camping. 
---
It's your team fault not killers fault for bad team mates. Ofc people will punish dumb plays, what do you expect? It's a 4v1 not a 1v1
---
&gt;If the killer decides to walk in small circles around my hook, how am I supposed to prevent this?
---
You can't but it's up to your team to punish that. If the killer just patrols around the hook, probably is because people bomb rushed the hook before
---
&gt;If another survivor has the right perk, they might be able to save me at the risk of them taking a hit or getting downed but that's their perk choice, I have no control over it.
---
So what? As I said is a 4v1, a team against a single unit. You get punished as a team, you cannot expect to control every situation. You'll know that if you played any team game
---
&gt;I could take DS but that brings up another point. There are about 75 survivor perks and most of them people never take. A game shouldn't force people to grind (or pay real money) to get the best perks to be viable at the top
---
I agree and disagree. To be clear, yeah the grind is too overwhelming and they should totally look into it since anyone who start the game would be discouraged to keep playing noticing the amount of grinding required (more than an mmo at this point)
---
On the other hand many perks are free (iridescent shards characters and shrine but is very RNG based). I agree some perks are behind paywalls and I'm against it personally, I would make a shop for perks that you can buy from iri shards, without relying on the shrine. I would've paid anyway for Yui regardless of the perks because I liked the character but many people, me included, would buy even someone who will never use just for perks. And for a Pay to play game it's not really fair
---
It's not a free to play game so it should give more options to get specific perks
---
&gt;Perks should be balanced so that each one is useful in it's own right. This applies double for Killer perks. Ruin isn't something that needs removed, but it certainly isn't balanced with the other perks. That's why people always see it and why it's got such a negative reputation. If it was balanced and only taken periodically, it would be enjoyable to encounter it.   
---
I don't get it the ruin argument. With practice you won't even feel it, plus it gets destroyed very fast very often.
---
Isn't balanced in what way? It's meta just because gives some extra time, that's it. At best gives 1extra min on gen progression, **at best**
---
&gt;Anyways the real point of this rant is the ranking system. The ranking system judges a player based on Objective, Altruism, Boldness, and Survival. At rank 4, you need to get 13-15 points to rank up and you get 4 points for an Iridescent, 3 for Gold, etc. This means that you need at least one Iridescent to gain a pip. [...]
---
Yeah emblem sucks since force you to do specific tasks to pip, no matter what happens. You can die and pip or survive and depip, same thing for killers. It's flawed and it's already well known
---
&gt; I don't expect players to do this because it sacrifices rank but I think I'm safe in assuming most people here are better killers than I am. Both the killer and the survivors can gain pips in a round, if the game is played properly, how it is designed to be played.  That's all I wish for every time I play a game, not to necessarily escape, but to have a fun time trying. 
---
In my personal opinion they should go back to X amount of bp = pip/depip/double pip
---
Make a new objective for survivors to give more time for killers
---
Increase the amount of pallets slightly but making them more unsafe and mindgamable.
---
They probably added because every female character felt jelous after Jane was added to the game
---
How do you find out what killer you're up against? I don't think DBD shows recently played/currently playing ever since dedicated servers.
---
What's the best way to counter the ruin? I agree on a 7 years old pc, I get 40 FPS and skill checks always lag. It's almost impossible for me to do a great skill check. Is there something I can do other than looking for the totem?

Imagine not knowing how to use apostrophes or how to form plurals. You actually have to be a subhuman third world pajeet to not understand these simple things. Don't defend that shit.
---

---
English isn't my native language either, plurals are part of basic grammar.
---
I agree, once my team cleansed on plaque and almost all of us died i got out through hatch due to people cleansing.
---
Someone's upset. Who hurt you friend?
---
Not complete 4 generators look closely its says finish
---
Why do ppl play as Ace so much
---
I literally got BT today, fuck me
---
Gen rushing is a thing. It's the objective, right but that's the point
---
A gen is done in 80s, the killer is a single unit and there are 4 survivors. The killer can chase one survivor then by the time he down a survivor at best there's 15s to 3 gens to be completed
---
The time you pick up and hook the downed survivor 3 gens pop, now repeat
---
That's why many people slug these days and try to avoid looping but to share the love with everyone or you'll get rushed in 4-7min
---
That's gen rushing. It's a thing and is a devs problem that needs to be acknowledged and fixes. Survivors like you who deny that's a thing in the first place is the problem
---
*queue the people who are still going to say that this is perfect and that its in fact your fault for some stupid reason
---
You have to slow the game down with demi, either by using 2 perk slots with ruin / haunted grounds to back it up or dying light. You can also play for immediate pressure with monitor and abuse and any perk that gives you vision  on survivors so you can get into a chase immediately. I main demi and I find I play best with nurses calling, BBQ, sloppy butcher and dying light. If I'm having a bad day I take off BBQ and dying light and plop on Hex: Ruin and Hex: thrill if the hunt or haunted grounds for a fast down. Stick with it, hes a snowball when you get going and figure it out, a good demi really gives survivors a bad time !
---
Can u buy these ?
---
Yeah actually now that you explained it more I do agree with this.
---
But I doubt most players will be able to tell when it's a good idea to cleanse or not, so I'd rather them just not cleanse ever until they learn more game sense.

It's what we do

or they do it like riot games. in league your mission would look somewhat like this:  
---
sacrifice 4 survivors in the basement (complete in single trial)
---
OR
---
hook 30 survivors in the basement
---
This. I wish more people would do this.
---
They nerfed him too far. Now his dash is mostly only for mobility since any competent survivor will just dodge it. It's also completely useless at any looping tiles
---
Its Wednesday my dude

---
This is so sad can we remove keys
---
Using a firecracker for the "Blind the killer while carrying a survivor" is the easiest way to win the challenge.
---
Yes, because every game you'll ever play all survivors will just spawn spread out on different gens and immediately start working on it.
---
No one's fucking around for even a single second, and obviously every survivor hits every hex skill check while cleansing the totem at the same time (because obviously every game ruin gets cleansed in the first 20 seconds).
---
yeah it is but its also a mind game situation. if the killer sees that someone is obsession hes gonna asume we have DS so he wont tunnel... If theres no obsession, killers do scumbag things more often... so for me its more like a mental thing that helps you know.
---
1. Spooky medkit and normal medkit are different?
---
2. All six toolboxes are the same? (Engineer and Alex's look bigger)
---
3. Broken Key is smaller
---
4. I don't remember two different firecrackers...
---
The only time I intentional ruin this challenge for someone (never by dcing, mind you) if I get the"I just wanna farm above the basement trapper" in red ranks. Boy, you get genrushed, I ain't falling for that bs.
---
It's a guaranteed get up, yes, but you're using two perks for the privilege. 
---
I could certainly see them earning their slots if the goal is to constantly be in the killer's face while everyone else does gens (and thus *significanly* increase your chance of being slugged or eating a tunnel), but otherwise I'm not sure sure it's worth the investment *in general*.

You can just gift them auric cells via a steam gift card so they can cherry pick the characters they'd like. It comes to about the same prices.
---
As a red rank player I would love to play a mode where I can play against only fun killers. Spirit and Freddy are super boring to play against and they get the most play time I feel
---

ah yes I've never thought about it as a sexual thing so dw. I usually draw it because it creates these overlapping lines that can show the volume of the upper thighs but there are lots of body parts artists use as a shorthand to do just that. We're just happy whenever there's an overlap

Done this before, was in the middle of a MK match online, pushed out a fart and shit came with it. My opponent was probably real confused when I just went afk mid match.

I want that little hag one so bad. Cute lil baby ;-:
---
gen rushing is a thing, and it is when you focus solely on generators and no other objectives like totems(to prevent noed), teammates, or looping the killer for a distraction for dispersing gens. not focusing on other things but only gens often leads to getting hit by noed and people like you who get mad over a stale argument with nothing to be argued.
---
Yeah
---
If you urban evasion around the map, don‚Äôt do gens and don‚Äôt get in chases, you don‚Äôt get value out of adrenaline. I don‚Äôt know why people also pull up this argument that a survivor doesn‚Äôt need to do anything for adrenaline, just their team does. Adrenaline is useless if you didn‚Äôt do anything to help your team.
---
Sometimes i try to tbag signal the person on hook in certain situations like is it okay to unhook u now?
---
So 1 person looping and 3 people doing gens is toxic? If you don‚Äôt get all the totems that‚Äôs just poor planning, I‚Äôm a red rank survivor and I don‚Äôt really understand what it is. So if we don‚Äôt ‚ÄúGen rush‚Äù we have the right to complain though?
---
And it can be used in the insta heal autodidact build
---
Exploiting is to use a bug to your advantage, they both are doing that
---
This kind of shit always makes me snort so loud
---
Cute mf boi
---
So that‚Äôs how the yamaoka family continued
---
I honestly have way more firecracker saves than flashlight saves. Which is to say, I have more than zero.
---
You just mad because the killer finds you by following the munching sounds.
---
Old ds = noed
---
Reward for failing
---
New DS = ruin 
---
Slows the momentum of both sides, so the other side has to pause and take a moment. Even has the same rng element that you won‚Äôt get use of out it every game.
---
yes, i am also a red rank survivor and that‚Äôs not exactly what i‚Äôm saying. i‚Äôm saying if the match s going to lean more towards a survivor victory, they will most likely either have a spread out objective over time and not be hit by noed because they were more evenly dispersed or they will genrush and get hit by noed if the killer has it. overall noed is used by killers who know they‚Äôre vulnerable to this and it‚Äôs a basic counterperk like decisive or adrenaline.
---
Yeah but he did that for like 10 seconds straight and killer was dragging somebody else
---
Play trapper, drop a trap below the locker when they jump in during chase. It's hilarious
---
Pfft, the nicest ‚Äúhate mail‚Äù I‚Äôve ever seen!
---
Which is caused by... Well, let's face it, both sides have a lot of people who are just dicks, but also the game is super unbalanced still, and really promotes the unfun playstyles because of it.
---
All boobies jiggle no matter what sizes they are
---
That was pretty good
---
Does is work for the Hag too?
---
WAIT... I dont want to see that!
---
Yeah, and next thing you gonna say is killer players in game don't want to murder anybody in real life.
---
Wait do the asylum hooks actually have a cage on top?? Holy shit I never noticed that
---
T-bagging after pallet stun, pointing to where other survivors are (as a killer, if someone does this, I ignore whoever they pointed at and then tunnel them) to name a few.
---
Racist ramblings of a depressed man child. Not repeating what they said but that Leatherface hated my Claudette. Me escaping must have killed their soul.

---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good shrine it‚Äôs just I have borrowed time and devour hope already shareable
---
The issue with it was a lot of survivors complained about the particle effects. I liked it personally but that‚Äôs life
---
Right when everybody goes back to school or work...thanks DbD!!!!
---
Well they said that before this one was announced so obviously that time has passed
---
But it is their fault for proxy camping and not doing their objectives. Which is what is required to tunnel. Tunneling only happens when the killer is an asshole or is bad.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ perfect
---
"  play the game how it‚Äôs supposed to be played " - More than half of the challenges you need to go out of your way to get them and you wouldn't normally get them if you played how you're "supposed" to play
---
They can give him tshirts, maybe a formal suit or something. Or we could have gotten a sweater. WHERE IS MY SWEATER?!
---
Just saying dude. Decisive Strike is a full 60 seconds after being unhooked. If I can hear/see you, I‚Äôm going to go after you and down you/hook you.
---
It‚Äôs not really tunneling if I‚Äôm just using game-sense and basic map awareness to find you, and then down you because you‚Äôre one-hit.
---
I‚Äôm not going to just ignore you and not follow you because of a fake rule you‚Äôre trying to push on ms
---
It can work like a T'V show too alright. I would love to see something about the og killers. I would love something about the oni or wraith. Trapper in a movie about a long discontinued mine people find and try to explore can be cool too.
---
Groovy
---
I agree with a lot of that, but the game shouldn't be balanced around every killer taking ruin
---
The people who dc when you almost did the six feet under. I have a list of your names and a mori for you next time i see you.

---
Filthy console peasant
---
I gotchu fam
---
it is in interactable props folder, so i assume when you are near)
---
Well keep doing what you're doing
---
We got it, you don't sandbag and never start to do objectives while DS is up, and of course if you get unhooked unsafely, you never run to the closest locker and let killer slug you like a good survivor you are (because DS supposed to counter tunneling, not camping, right?), and never use your DS if you was healed.
---
Could you update it to new killers and survivors? Is really cool this Character Portraits

I run it for traps in the first place. Trapper is a common killer on higher ranks. In a chase I will know if I can go for a vault or pallet or not. Also works on Freddy and Hag (especially for unhooking with Hag killer).
---
The totems are just a bonus point to make it easier to pin point them down.
---
She ain‚Äôt got no edges ;-;
---
Ahh another post full of people who believe survivor mains are the only toxic ones. Poor baby killer.
---
He‚Äôs good in chases but lacks map pressure. So you‚Äôll want perks to slow the game downnd give you early pressure.
---
Ruin/Corrupt intervention
---
Pop goes the weasel
---
Then the other two can be whatever. Sloppy, bbq, enduring, STBFL, Discordance, thrilling tremors etc
---
Stbfl can make his chases extremely quick but if its a large map gens will still get done fast. Try to have something that will slow the game down or buy you more time.
---
I met an Ace main through a friend, and honestly they‚Äôre one of the sweetest, nontoxic players I‚Äôve met. They‚Äôre also super badass. But I feel that because that‚Äôs my experience with Claudette players.
---
I was playing a game on Temple of Purgation as the last Survivor. The Billy didn‚Äòt even close the hatch and just downed me and carried me to a gen and told me to do it. I did and he downed me and carried me into the corner of the map next to the gen to wiggle out, but also so I couldn‚Äòt get hatch. After getting downed a few more times on the gen he carried me to what I assumed was the hatch and just hooked me. Yeah, I also fuck with Survivors when they‚Äòre the last one left, but I still let them go. Some people are just tryhards.
---

---
Honestly the gates are just shit. Either their right next to each other and the killer has won or their on opposite ends of the map (e.g Treatment Theatre) and all the survivor has to do is wait for you to patrol their gate once and they‚Äôve won.

---
You have to have real good timing though. Too early, it happens mid pick up animation and you don‚Äôt get the wave. Too late and the killer can just look up
---
Being toxic to killers is shooting yourself in the foot. If you want chill killers who actively try to make a match enjoyable for everyone. Killers who play killers that are not top tier, and/or don't use the same top tier perks every game, then survivors shouldn't be toxic asswipes by berating them and teabagging.
---
Plays ^trap card
---
Lmao. Okay buddy. I‚Äôm done trying to reason with you, because you obviously don‚Äôt want to hear it.
---
Keep thinking the Killer is an asshole for not following your fake rules.
---
Well, how old are they? 16? 17? It doesn't have to belong to a survivor, not everyone knows how to fix generators and dress wounds
---
Most people run it to counter noed and ruin but like why run that when Detective's Hunch literally shows you where everything is
---
Everybody gangsta until Maurice starts standing.

---
I got it first try and was lucky because hatch spawned right next to where I place a trap and was able to teleport to it and down the last dude near basement before the other guy fully died on hook.
---
Yea, but you know. It actually barely counters totems cuz totems barely need countering. totem spots are too predictable to requite a counter. 4 in/around corners, one somewhere else, usually middle.
---
Trapper? it tells you where disarmed traps are, so it warns you for nothing
---
Freddy? it will tell you that at least one of the two pallets is fake, which is known already, and won't easily let you know which one or if either is actually real. It won't do anything to a snare either, just warn you about something you clearly see.
---
Hag? Well, that one is actually quite good.
---
sometimes you'll even try to sneak by the trap and it turns out it's just a totem, and the wide cone + long cooldown won't let you know exactly where said trap is and you might accidentally trigger/step into it when trying to walk by it
---
I was gonna say, I didn‚Äôt even know a mobile version existed lol, I imagine the controls are dreadful
---
The hag is free though?

but why tho

How do you misspell ‚Äútunneling‚Äù that badly?
---
r/factsaboutwasps

If your lucky they will chat you XD
---
The only problem is that voice chat makes perks like object overpowered, as one person can communicate to everyone where the killer is. Voice chat also removes the need for aura perks like bond, empathy, aftercare, etc as you can just say where are.

I once did this as killer as well.

Unpopular opinion but I‚Äôm ok with this. I wouldn‚Äôt mind playing against or as a animatronic.
---
Much like sex, there should be consent given from the survivor on the hook as to whether they wish to be taken off it. Whether it's in the form of a skill check or just a simple button click.
---
.... huh?

You do know they do it to stack up madness?

Survivor mains.  Is there a reason you feel entitled to not be attacked after you are unhooked?  Where does the entitlement come from?

That t-posing crow is the stuff of nightmares

They should be rewarded more for doing so, it is a killers job to stop it though

The only buff she got lately was the Undetectable buff in stealth, which all the stealth killers got
---
That is actually a really unnerving legion mask.   Nice.
---
I love Dwights face.
---
I mean, these guys killed only one unarmed and unsuspecting person before being pulled into the entity‚Äôs realm if I‚Äôm not mistaken. So either they decided to disfigure the first ever person they killed on impulse and managed to pull out the eye with bare hands or a knife without slashing it to pieces, and being totally not grossed out by gouging it on a pen or the skin just wouldn‚Äôt be canon like almost every other unlicensed killer skin.
---
Btw that comment was a joke based not on lore but gameplay mechanics, I thought it was obvious
---
It doesn‚Äôt help that the game kinda encourages farming with one of its achievements. 
---
Taking One For The Team: Take a hit for a survivor recently unhooked, 250 times. 
---
Literally, the only way you can get this is by farming your teammate. Most killers don‚Äôt camp, so they will never be close enough for you to get hit in the very limited time frame you have (about 7 seconds or so before the unhook is no longer considered ‚Äúrecent‚Äù). Personally, I run Borrowed Time, and will eat a hit to try and chip away at that achievement all the time. There‚Äôs no other practical way to get it. Even with some of the unhook challenges, survivors were just throwing the game to get the unhooks. It‚Äôs pretty annoying.
---
I had a game yesterday, where I killed a guy rather early in the game,secured a solid 3 gen strat with pop, but the remaining survivors just couldn't do the last gen. I purposefully let them finish it only to find out that they had cleansed all totems anyway.

Who cares what others think of the way you play, as long as you're having fun, do what you want.
---
Why not? Yeah it's rediculous, but how often do you get to try having two killers. I mean it sucks he lost an iri key, but as a survivor I wouldn't take it personally, although I definitely wouldn't expect to win.
---
Actually no, the range is 96 metres at tier 3
---
It‚Äôs science!
---
I bought it and got a refund cause the matches took too long to form RIP
---
The council will decide your fate
---
Spine Chill will light up in your Perk slots, and add 2 Effects to the Gen Progress Bar/Healing Bar/Action Bar, so you can pay attention to those to see if you‚Äôre being looked at or not.
---
Premonition plays a moderately loud noise when you activate it by looking in the Killers direction.
---
Maybe adjust your Audio Settings if you can‚Äôt hear it over a Gen, because it‚Äôs pretty easy to hear ingame
---
Not from a survivor main
---
Yup, literally everyone in the community is already aware of this lol.
---
I‚Äôm fine it was the pc I got was not working but now it is  so I hope you have a good day I know I will
---
You put all your points into him, but you won‚Äôt bring him to his best potential? For shame, good sir
---
It should be proximity based like in F13. I shouldn‚Äôt be able to tell you I‚Äôm looping the killer, if I‚Äôm across the map while you‚Äôre on a gen. But if I‚Äôm right next to you on a gen, then we could talk. Empathy and After Care would still have use, as you get farther away, as would Bond if you don‚Äôt have a mic/don‚Äôt feel like talking to randoms. Also, talking is nice, but knowing exactly where you are with Bond would help to not accidentally bring the killer to you. There‚Äôs a difference between ‚Äúbro I‚Äôm near the shack‚Äù and knowing exactly where you are by the shack so I don‚Äôt run in that direction. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt use Bond, but aura perks would still have use the farther you get away.
---
Actually spirit has jiggle physics
---
SWF is already a huge balancing issue, if they use voice. Now if they voice to the actual game, then they will have to rework half of the killers and their perks pretty much. Imagine playing a stealth killer, with voice chat right now.
---
No this is the worst thing in the game hands down
---
Yes. I read your post - and I reacted to it appropriate. 
---
Its not fake rules, you legitimate get more blood points and better pip if you dont tunnel...
---
The killer should be played 1v4. Not 1v1 like you attribute your playstyle to. I suggest getting better at map control as oppossed to thinking low scoring fast kill games are how you play.
---
Demogorgon at red ranks, bless your soul
---
Yes. Not toxic. I could be. I‚Äôll tbag if my friend is getting tunneled off hook all game to adjust the killer focus. There‚Äôs time to be toxic( which is kind of relative) on both sides. I‚Äôm not trying to say there aren‚Äôt toxic survivors. It‚Äôs just that toxic killers are just as prevalent. And I‚Äôm also not saying you can‚Äôt be toxic. I don‚Äôt care either way. I mainly try to be chill and friendly to everyone.
---
That doesn't really have any meaning. DS counters killers just playing the game regularly, not tunneling.
---
The two perks in the game that I automatically assume every killer to have
---
Hey I totally played against you guys yesterday! Was the killer huntress or Myers? That's all I played yesterday. Regardless, murry Chrysler to you guys as well.
---
It's meant to be David King, but I see how you can see Bill. Art is open to interpretation, so I guess it could be Bill. üòÑ
---
Speaking of interpretation, he probably didn't want to wear tights, so he had to settle for a St. Patrick's day outfit.
---
Most Snapple facts are wrong if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
---
The first blink will have the shortest fatigue, and is affected by the Fatigue Time Add-ons.
---
The second/third blink fatigue however will be much longer, and is only affected by that one Chain Blink Fatigue Add-On. 
---
The second/third blinks should only ever be used to correct yourself or score hits. If you just want distance, charge up one full blink at a time
---
Eh, we got one for free. And they made a pack of them I don't see the problem.
---
They didn't do it for tomes or challenges.
---
"Must Unhook Safely".........
---
It's shocking how many people don't know that shit though.  I'll still see farming killers fuck up the hooks on survivors by instantly downing and rehooking the saved survivor which isn't a farm for anyone making them saves lol.  People still don't understand how unhooks work/are credited and it's legit pretty funny/sad.
---
Dude, if you dont at least farm to 32K then your f u c k i n g toxic, mate
---
She was ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù before. She wasn‚Äôt better than Nurse who is complained about less. She just kind of sucked the fun out of the chase from the survivor POV for some people due to her having a big advantage in the chase.
---
Or when a survivor is getting chased running near the hook ur on like why?
---
I thought you were referring to those changes. Green medkits used to be my favorite addon, but I hate that without a great skill check you only get the 1 heal and you lose the item
---
high ranks dont really use ruin though
---
But which one though? I heard that ghostface doesn't have good perks
---
and I took a potato chip, THEN I ATE IT!!!!!!
---
Technically no, since they are all different sizes, have different breathing/moaning volumes, and some are easier to see than others.
---
Wait no way! Thats mad ahaha, if you were Myers I 100% remember that game it was so difficult, merry Crambo my dude
---
Reading all these comments why don't I get these survivors when i play plague the only way i get to use corrupt and slug everyone is when i bring an apple otherwise survivors only cleanse endgame smh
---
Or they could let killers pip for playing well, and not having to 4man.
---
That way, I dont have to spend 5 min on the floor AND the killer doesnt get super fucked for it. I have no idea why so many people think you need one or the other.
---
"People must enjoy being slugged because its mandatory due to how shitty the ranked system is!" Then maybe fix the rank system instead BHVR?
---
You should probably reply *directly* to the people asking you questions
---
If I remember correctly I only killed 1 of you, you guys had me working for it lol
---
I really don‚Äôt like that I can see your eyes through the mask. It‚Äôs very uncomfortable
---
I was told a few people to watch (fungoose, scott jund). I rewatched scott‚Äôs tile running video and it really helped.
---
The things you MUST do though are:
---
1. Leave bad chases. They‚Äôre at a god loop? Nice. Get a pallet if you can within like 10 seconds. Outposition them later.
---
2. It‚Äôs not a 1v1. It‚Äôs a 4v1. Juggle the survivors to cause the most time to be wasted. I‚Äôve heard an old saying from soldiers that goes something like ‚Äúshoot to wound. If you kill them, you take one person out of the fight. If you wound them, you take multiple out.‚Äù  This is because a slugged person has to be healed by another survivor, thus wasting more of their time.
---
3. Know when to slug and when to hook. Ideally you want 1 hooked, 1 slugged, and 1 in chase. This forces the 4th into altruism and off of gens.
---
4. If someone gets unhooked in front of you, hit them, then chase the teammate. If they have borrowed, it forces a mend and wastes a little time. If not, see point number 2. You can usually get a free hit before they attempt the unhook and catch them a few seconds after.
---
5. Look at your survivors‚Äô status icons. Have an obsession? Play around d strike. Count a minute when someone is pulled off of a hook. If you invest the time in a chase, you really don‚Äôt want them getting away for free.
---
6. Positioning is important when picking up a survivor. I have lost way too much time by getting flashlighted when picking up a downed survivor. Face a wall to avoid it. If no wall is available, bait the pick up and check to see if someone is there. Also, pallets always warrant a quick check to make sure they‚Äôre not going to pallet save.
---
7. Know where all of the survivors are. There are plenty of information perks available to killers. Don‚Äôt rely too heavily on BBQ and Chili, it‚Äôs easily outplayed. Try thrilling tremors, whispers, surveillance, discordance, and nurse‚Äôs calling. 
---
8. Exhaustion perks. Oh boy. Chase the sprint burst/balanced landing/ lithe person unless they made it to a god loop. These perks are one use and gone. Bait the dead hard. Don‚Äôt swing unless you know they don‚Äôt have it. Head on is a meme. It happens randomly. Just roll with it.
---
9. Most of the time, it‚Äôs safe to ignore your object of obsession. They want to be chased because they‚Äôre good at looping. Let them waste their time chasing you or being clicky clicky. At that point, they‚Äôre not helping their team and you can focus on the ones who are. When you do have to chase them, keep point 1 in mind.
---
10. Not every chase has to result in a down. Getting a pallet is huge when there are still gens on the same side of the map. Be conscious of how long you‚Äôve been chasing someone and set a short timeframe for it. If you start to exceed the time limit, leave the chase and pressure gens. Very similar to points 1 and 2.
---
11. Not every pallet can be mindgamed. This is one I really had to learn. Pay attention to whether or not the survivor actually watches you or autopilots their loops.
---
12. Admit your mistakes. You‚Äôre not going to get better at killer if you don‚Äôt. When you don‚Äôt perform as well as you want, think back on what you did during the game that cost you. Don‚Äôt blame the survivors, they‚Äôre not holding your controller/mouse and keyboard.
---
These are things that I‚Äôve picked up from playing. Hopefully they help some.
---
Half the time I forget to even look where anyone is when I get a hook. I literally just want those bps.
---
Yeah, this achievement is a motive for betrayal
---
Shadowborn.
---
Some people just want to see your rank burn
---
It‚Äôs honestly a lot easier to use the Hay Bale to reduce your stagger, and then just loop around the whole thing again back up to the top.
---
Although the strat OP showed is pretty good if the Killer has no idea how to run it.
---
You can only speak to what you know I've got a few thousand hours on DbD PS4 and though me and my friends use the report system when needed none of us have ever seen BHVR ban someone. Perhaps i should have specified the system I'm on but on PS4 it looks like the only way to get someone punished is to report them to Sony.
---
OH I HATE THIS! When they run around your hook like running around the rosie. I wish I could kick them in the jaw.
---
No. Voice chat cannot be implemented in dead by daylight. Go look up the depip squad. They were a team of 4 survivors who used nothing but voice chat to play. no perks, no items. Almost every game they were able to have all players escape, often they beat the killer so bad they deranked said killer, thus the name the depip squad. Everyone of the survivors on the team were rank one when this was going on.
---
global voice chat is so overpowered in asymmetrical survival games any game that has it as an option limit it massively. Friday the thirteenth is an excellent example, global chat only works between players who have the in game walkie talkies. Outside of that you have to use regional chat. However we still need to compare that DBD has aura reading abilities like object of obsession that when used with regional chat would be broken.
---
Rarely and only at end game. Otherwise the killer has better options and more important things to do. DS should be a learning tool for killers to get better and learn how the game actually works.
---
Oh no, not chatted! 
---
P.s. Merry Christmas

Actually, it‚Äôs to give an update and credit to the people who did offer advice and help where I can. In the end, it‚Äôs a video game. I have real life accomplishments to be proud of moreso than what I do as a hobby and to pass my time.

Noed doesn't have to be active for the quest,you just have to have it.Like if you're using the perk "this is not happening" for the great skillcheck challenge,you don't have to be injured(to activate the perk),you just have to hit greats.
---
And she escaped, the thot

I‚Äôd like to see a ‚ÄúCompetitive Mode‚Äù where no Items/Offerings/Add-Ons/Perks are allowed. You are required to lobby only as Solo and you won‚Äôt know which team you‚Äôre on.

Hahahahaha Is there a subreddit for salty DBD post game chats?
---
When someone sends me hate mail I just reply with random shit. My favourite is ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 20 years since I‚Äôve been the Batman.‚Äù
---
Communication is the biggest strength in this game.  I don't want to even think how many more absurd buffs they would be forced to give killers if they were to ever implement voice chat natively into the game.  It would be a balancing nightmare for both sides.
---
I'm here.
---
Tried it, no
---
FUCK THE TOME. BS OR GRINDY QUESTS.
---
FUCK THE SIX DEEP UNDER QUEST. I COULD DONE IT 4 TIMES. BUT CUNTS DC AT LAST HOOK. I WAS NEVER ANGRY AT SOMETHING IN A VIDOE GAME BEFORE. LIKE HOLY SHIT, I DIDN'T CAMP AND WENT AROUND THE WHOLE MAP AND YOU DC AND CALL ME A CAMPER LATER???
---
Everyone knows this. Literally everyone.
---
*M o a n i n g?*
---
Your totem point is pretty outdated.  These maps do have some legit incredible spawns at this point you could spend the game looking for.  They aren't all out in the open anymore.  This isn't 2017.
---
Not ghostfaces perks, I meant myers but ghostface as a killer is really good.
---
Myers is good too but maybe not s tier.
---
That's not true in the slightest.
---
Doing gens too quick is toxic, healing is toxic, looping is toxic, bringing items is toxic, etc. It goes both ways.
---
I started laughing when it happened. The best part was I was gonna go chase after another survivor to give that one a fighting chance, but nope. I emded up letting the other 3 farm since it was still the beginning of the match.
---
Thanks. I try that, but on the shorter loops I just end up wasting time because the survivors don't drop the pallets
---
I go to this sub and the first post I see is a wasp carrying a dead spider
---
I'm going to r/eyebleach real quick
---
Has BHVR announced what/when they will do something about the Oni flick? I‚Äôve heard some people say they said that they were changing it on discord but I have no way of confirming for myself. I hope that they can do it before the mid chapter patch since they were able to change him in a hotfix originally
---
How I'm all ears and thrilling aren't good??
---
I'm all ears is good for loops, thrilling if you don't have BBQ.
---
For Myers he has play with your food and save best for last. Pick what you wish for.
---
Perk wise, Myers is better. Game play wise people say Ghostface. Gf is op since he can tea bag.
---
What better option is there other than hit the person that's running in their face? Or grabbing the survivor that's getting in and out of a locker? That's how DS is used most of the time. It teaches that the best way to play is if there's an obsession then slug everyone. Survivors don't seem to like it when slugged.
---
Fantastic
---
*-sets up cameras and video recording-*
---
I‚Äôm listening
---
No, she's been jiggly since her PTB.
---
Yes I admit on other systems other then my own I shouldn't speak but come on there was a 66.6% chance I had the right answer for him (your words) and since I dont play on the others how am I to know that BHVR only intervenes on PC? Btw seems a weird brag that you've been banned twice, maybe sharing why could help OP out with his question?
---
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt hear footsteps or outrun a decloaking Wraith‚Äù starter pack
---
I meaaaaan... it makes sense. Pipping is worthless. Escaping or killing everyone has a much higher sense of victory than pipping since you get nothing for it.
---
Yes if they dont drop the pallet you should be able to hit them.
---
They are in alphabetical order.
---
Now I‚Äôm imagining a little gremlin-Nea sitting in a locker just munching chips with her mouth open.
---
thanks!
---
made me laugh
---
thank you
---
I also feel like a fair amount of players admit they had to play like a dick to do some of these challenges. I think if the players feel forced to be a dick to progress, the devs need to rethink certain challenges though.   
---
It seems to happen most to the challenges that have to be completed in a single match.
---
No it's not.  It's the killers job to kill everyone while preventing gens from completing.
---
Good killer players focus on their next down and keeping the gens from being worked on they don't become preoccupied with guarding their last hook.  Always look forward playing killer not behind.  That's how you depip from 1 hooking survivors even with a 4K which you probably won't get anywhere close to anyways since if you're playing to deny unhooks you're just serving the survivors up your gens uncontested and free af.
---
Hook it and book it bro.  Unless they all swarm instantly just hook, leave, pressure gens/initiate your next chase.
---
Legion‚Äôs pretty bad these days, but I still play ‚Äòem. They come with Discordance which is a good perk, and they come with Mad Grit which is essential to any basement builds
---
Yeah.. He was making a joke.
---
The new killer has to be Maurice sprinting at you on his hind legs.
---
*‚Äùwhat an idiot he‚Äôs not even breaking this pallet lmao‚Äù*
---
They are, just they‚Äôre not born fully grown.
---
As a rank 19 killer I got paired with a SWF of two 4s, an 8, and a 10. I got one down the entire game and I thought I may just be the worse killer to ever live until I saw the lobby.
---
That‚Äôs tunnelling off hook. Tunnelling is refusing to go after anybody except one particular survivor, even at your detriment.
---
Im rank 1 survivor and encounter ruin in 90 peecent of the games at least.
---
Tunnelling*
---
Tha is so cool!
---
Mad grit is in no way "essential" to a basement build.

Not really
---
SURVIVOR MAINS COMPLAINING ABOUT KILLER STRATEGIES
---
Yes, what a productive mindset. I really hope you take some time to play survivor. Maybe you'll get out of green ranks when you figure out how the game is played.
---
Yea i've heard that leather is good but i already have bbq and chili . I'm a huntress main and i point feed the nurse since i want nurses calling. I know that Myers i pretty good but eh like i'm not an extremely good killer
---
she also got the faster crouching and the fading TR from coming in and out of crouch. Which also was a nice buff.
---
The only other thing that could've been considered a nerf was going to be the paused timer in her TR, but luckily that never made it out of PTB.
---
Also just because other killers got it, doesn't stop it from being a buff.
---
Go for it, Deja vu
---
Ruin is basically a necessity for most killers, unless you're a very good player who can quickly get a snowball going from the early game
---
BBQ's aura effect really makes it good for map pressure but most people just run it for the double BP
---
How am I bragging
---
PADORU PADORU
---
Very  few killer addons actually boost them to the point they don't deal with  the issues of being an M1 killer, they're traditionally  rare/ultra-rare, and are of course consumed each match.
---
Myers hitting EW3 even without infinite is counterable, and while I  do agree Freddy running Ruin/Pop/Dying Light with both his slowing  addons was brutal for solo, he STILL got rushed out by groups.
---
The older stats for SWF from BHVR indicated that what, 90% of games  have at least a 2-stack? Streamers contest the "2 survivors a 4-man die"  claims by at least attempting to track their own games.
---
My point was that you cannot pressure generators in any sort of  meaningful fashion without an instant down (and even in some cases with  an instant down), if you ever M1 a survivor you can't afford to chase  them through the speed boost.
---
This even applies to Spirit to some degree because she averages less  than 115% over the 28 seconds despite being able to phase walk - her  strength is being able to phase and catch you on the wrong side of the  pallet, but Trapper actually moves faster over 28 seconds than Spirit  does.
---
To be fair I feel toxic playing killer today, how can I do anything but try hard when I have to wait 30 minutes to get 4 survivors.
---
I want legion because i like the aesthetic and i like his power... Yea his perks aren't the best i know that discordance is the only best thing you can get out of him but still i kinda like him.
---
Notice the recent influx of Xbox posts, I fucking hate it
---
STOP MESSAGING ME SALTY SHIT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T LOOP AND YOUR TEAMMATES DC. AINT MY FAULT PAL IM JUST TRYING TO FUCKING CHILL AND PLAY THE NEWEST KILLER.
---
That‚Äôs the same reason I‚Äôm still playing them lmao, the aesthetic is edgy and fun
---
Wt ring u got bithc?
---
They may have patched this back in, but they also put that little barrier there so the killer can't actually get anything  out of it.
---
Yeah, a good portion of snapple "real facts" are not real at all. I rarely drink snapple but I'm not actually sure I've ever gotten a real one.
---
Haha post of a game similar to dbd and me saying I wont buy it, updoots to the left folks
---
Oops! The image I used as a ref showed the pocket on his right, but it must have been mirrored. It was also hard to tell the shirt colour in the images I used because of the lighting. Should have checked the actual game :p
---
from pc what?
---
I love standing up for killers that are genuinely just trying their best &lt;3
---
Keep up the good work soldier, soon we‚Äôll outnumber the 10 y/o and ochido fans.
---
&gt;Why does not playing to the rules of the game not make you a good player?
---
I don't get your point here. If your "skills" are not objective based then your skillset is for the wrong game. We are given the version of DBD that exists not the one where there is a COD mode. If you play outside the games norms then dont be surprissed if you are called out for it.
---
Herman's laugh is just way too sexy.
---
What else would you call the noise jane makes when she gets slapped by daddy myers

---
I mean i play nurse and billy, 2 killers that can down nearly the while team in 60 seconds if played well, im not taking a ds if you've let me snowball....
---
The "fully grown" bit is a bit off. So, the egg js laid in the little chamber in the hive and they are little grubs, but they never leave that chamber until they arw fully grown and it looks like they are "born" when in reality it is coming out of the pupa stage. The larval stage lasts like 3 days or 5 days while the pupa stage is, like... 14 days? So it's not really observed, but yeah.
---
I think it means that they emerge from their comb fully grown, but they do start from eggs and grow through larval stages in there first
---
Thing is, if you are obviously dangerous like that, some people will not go in for the save and will stay clear away from the basement. I'm not sure of max range of Agitation+Iron Grasp, but unless it holds up across the map, it may not be workable.
---
Yessss! Megs ponytail with the white headband is a nice ponytail. Nancy‚Äôs is a great ponytail. However Kate‚Äôs, and Fengs ponytails are sad and look like floppy turds.

Oh hell yeah the good ole "Looping is toxic". Honestly whenever I am having a very good chase as a surv I start preparing for the facecamp, luckily havent met too many bad killers past few months.

---
That grab though damn
---
This games community is the most toxic I have ever seen. It's impressive and sad.
---
It's a combination of shit+fart. When you think you're about to pass gas but it's liquid instead.
---
Yeaaah, well you talk about "camping" and "tunneling" without thought behind it, as well as "gen rush" that gets punished because survivors didn't think about anything else (if they had a plan, NOED wouldn't be destructive to them).
---
BTW 2k is a perfectly balanced kill rate, 4k is a luxury (BHVR told so, not me). And easiest way to get 2k is camp first guy, then get second one with NOED and camp him (not trying to promote it, I have a strongly negative opinion about that).
---
Have you tried Basement Hag?
---
Ty for confirming it
---
That's what these archive challenges do to us killers
---
Oof.  Wants 4k every game. Doesnt care about objectives. Or ranking. And mains billy/nurse. 
---
Complains about DS. Lmfao.
---
Oh yea, if the killer doesnt know its a much stronger loop
---
That's called "Look at lobby, see flashlights, take Franklins".
---
It‚Äôs obvious he wants to make something harder for survivors. Mashing the struggle button isn‚Äôt even accurate because of lag or if you stop pressing for half a second, your dead. You can see he‚Äôs default meg and has one perk because he‚Äôs probably a killer main. I get it‚Äôs a suggestion but it‚Äôs like if we said, ‚Äúkillers should press a skill check when carrying a survivor to the hook and when they miss, the survivor escapes their grasp‚Äù. I‚Äôm surprised most of these comment are agreeing
---
an add-on refresh could help any killer at this point, which is what devs are doing 1 at a time. Chances are if she is on the list Pig is below most killers in terms of priority.
---
I still think her biggest problem is the RNG nature and actual outcome of her RBTs. You got to be careful when you have a power that can just outright kill the survivor if it goes off, with the added effect of how random it is to get the key out of the boxes and that the killer can still very easily interrupt you out of them, it is hard to justify making them any more deadly.
---
you hold the middle button down, go to dead by daylight, currently playing with, and if the killer is appearing online you'll see their name
---
Running out of things to compare. ;)
---
The teammates will always be the hardest part of survivor. It's not even too hard to run a killer for longer than a minute. The first time they hit you gives half a minute of free running even without loops.
---
tractor tech but uno reverse card
---
Merry Christmas everyone
---
They add new totem spawns with numerous updates.  There are some ludicrous spawns man.  They aren't all next to gens or at jungle gyms and T L Walls anymore.  Like sure 4 of them usually pretty easy but there's always that one spot.  Some of the spawns you can't even physically see even if you know it's there.  You have to feel around until you happen upon a prompt like that one in the bushes at Spirits Map at that long stone barrier loop.

Lol again if you're playing for a 2K you aren't playing to win the game.  Campers are not playing to win the game.  A 2K is a tie at best and a hard loss if you camp because your emblems will guarantee derank you.  At least the survivors doing gens is optimal.  You're just supporting nonsense here.
---
WHY DOES PIPPING FEEL SO HORRIBLE? WHY IS IT WHEN I GO UP IN RANK ALL I FEEL IS DREAD AND ANXIETY? MAYBE SOME ACTUAL REASON FOR RANKING UP WOULD HELP BHVR, LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR ENDING A MONTH WITH A HIGH RANK MIGHT MAKE IT SLIGHTLY LESS AWFUL TO ACTUALLY PLAY AT THOSE RANKS
---
Whether you agree with the idea or not isn't the point. The point is that they merely made a suggestion ‚Äî not an intentional meme or shitpost. They would have flaired it as so if it were.  Not everyone will agree with suggestions, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a suggestion.
---
I showed you my broken ruler pls reply
---
After relooking at this post I realized that it isnt a shitpost about the dumbass struggle phase, and is in fact a genuine rework idea. Apologies for the sarcasm, I just really hate struggling. I think hitting regular old skillchecks instead of mashing one button for 10 minutes would be better, but a bit weird
---
I'd be on that every day.

I don‚Äôt understand it at all, you spend a majority of the game trying to build up this power (slowing yourself down during the process) and when you finally get it, it‚Äôs unrewarding and disheartening because you can never hit *good* survivors unless they run in a straight line in the open. Meanwhile killers like Spirit get this awesome power without having to do anything with maximum reward and results.
---
Allow me to elaborate, I mean do toxic things. I‚Äôm not a toxic person. I‚Äôm not the type to tbag at the exit or at a pallet. If I‚Äôm trying to get the killer off someone else I will. Only in strategic situations when it‚Äôs best for the team. Or should I take a page from the killers rulebook for survivors that say I‚Äôm not allowed to try to do anything to get the killers attention?
---
Dude objective is chases, hooks and deviousness, i lose out on those from DS.... 4k is the best way to do that....
---
Really hope he gets buffed in the next patch.
---
I WAS 1 FUCKING PIP FROM RANK 1. LITERALLY A SINGLE PIP. SO NATURALLY I GET A FUCKING PLAG THAT CAMPS BASEMENT IN THOMPSON HOUSE. I'VE BARELY BEEN ABLE TO GET A SINGLE GEN DONE AND THE REST OF THE TEAM HAS DONE NOTHING. THEY ARE ALL EITHER DOWNED ON THE BASEMENT OR HOOKED THERE. I LITERALLY WANTED TO JUST LET THEM DIE AND GET HATCH, BUT MY ALTRUISM MEDAL WOULD BE NONEXISTANT, AND I WOULDN'T PIP NO MATTER WHAT.
---
SO I CLEANSE AND GO THERE. SHE IMMEDIATELY VOMITS ON ME AND MAKES ME BROKEN AGAIN, BUT IN THE MEANTIME I GET A BT SAVE BEFORE SHE DOWNS ME. I DIE FIRST HOOK AND DEPIP BECAUSE MY TEAM CONSISTED OF NOTHING BUT BOOSTED APES. I TELL MYSELF ITS FINE, SHIT LIKE THIS HAPPENS, LET'S JUST CLEAR MY HEAD AND GO FOR ANOTHER MATCH. POOF, INSTASAW SHITBILLY WITH A MORI. I'M THE FIRST ONE FOUND AND HOOKED, AND ONCE I'M UNHOOKED, A FUCKING NEA SANDBAGS ME AND POOF, I GO DOWN AND GET INSTA-MORIED BY THAT PIECE OF SHIT. ANOTHER FREE DEPIP.
---
NEVERTHELESS, I PUSH ON. NEXT GAME, TRAPPER ON BADHAM. I'VE DONE 2 GENS AND MAXED ALTRUISM FROM UNHOOKS AND HEALS, WHILE BOLDNESS IS ALSO PRETTY CLOSE TO FULL. FINALLY, I THINK TO MYSELF, I CAN AT LEAST GET A PIP THIS MATCH. AND THEN MY INTERNET FUCKING DIES AND I DEPIP INSTEAD.
---
4TH MATCH, ANOTHER FUCKING PLAG, THIS TIME ON AUTOHAVEN. AGAIN, DEPIP BECAUSE GOD FORBID I CAN HAVE TEAMMATES WHO KNOW HOW TO FUCKING PLAY AGAINST A PLAG, AND DON'T CLEANSE THE MOMENT THEY GET INFECTED. 
---
I'M LITERALLY PISSED BEYOND BELIEF. ALL I WANT IS TO REACH RANK 1 ONCE TO GET MY FUCKING ACHIEVEMENT AND THEN NEVER GIVE A FUCK ABOUT RANK ONCE AGAIN, BUT NOPE, I'LL GET NOTHING BUT POTATO TEAMMATES AND SWEATY KILLERS WHO WILL ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO FULLY EXPLOIT THE MISTAKES OF SAID POTATOES.
---
You have no idea what I have planned for you. It'll be in the news for weeks. I'll make sure of that.

I played against a cute af baby ace earlier with a sweater and kept finding him hiding in a corner as nurse. One time it was him and a swell just hiding. I had to let them do gens and escape it was too damn adorable.
---
Stop it.  Please stop pretending Legion was ever at any time a strong killer and that the rework didn't make him more viable.  He began as a tunneling tortoise who couldn't do shit.  All he could do was cheese survivors down individually in chase but even that took him way too long and was only viable with the use of the most broken addon in the game that has since been fixed.  The increased speed and duration made him far better than he began.  
---
I'm with you 1000% that it is ludicrous for any survivor to still be salty over Legion.  He's a perfectly normal killer now.  But seriously you members that try and pretend that his rework was a "nerf" annoy the shit out of me.  That lie is right up there with "You can only play Nurse and Spirit at red rank"...
---
GOOD LUCK WITH NOED! I'VE BEEN RUNNING DETECTIVE'S HUNCH COUPLED WITH INNER STRENGTH. IT'S MY GOAL TO ERADICATE TOTEMS FROM THIS FILTHY BALL OF DIRT.
---
But it's fast to just power through the gen than just looking through the entire map and hope that the totem u sensed is ruin
---
BUT WHAT IF THEY'RE USING ZANSHIN'S TACTICS? IT'S CLEARLY OVERPOWERED A NEEDS A NERF!!!!
---
when stealth is an actual viable mechanic we can talk about her overperforming

Then you should take Empathy over Bond. You shouldn't have any trouble finding your healthy teammates in red.
---
although the xp bonus from emblems is piddly, best way to rank up the rift is to survive 9 minutes and die, then repeat, using whichever queue is faster
---
I'd love to have PVC statues of the OG Killers but Funkp Pops are a good substitute, even if I wouldn't buy them personally.
---
Jeez. Literally out at the last second.
---
Super impressive!
---
then that is not crossplay u do know hat crossplay is? what you're saying makes no sense bc crossplay is literally console to something like PC not pc to pc
---
Better be non fun facts about wasps
---
that was a nail biter haha nice job!
---
YEAH UHU NICE TOTEMS BABY
---
Yes, I know... it‚Äôs a meme. Plus let‚Äôs take into consideration that killer do not know this, they only know how to kill for the entity
---
Sometimes it takes several minutes till you receive them.
---
I own 3/4 perks. I wanna buy devour hope but will probably only get to use it 1/100 games because I am in red rank and everyone here knows totem spawns
---
This is...a good use for the like, 50 Snapple bottle caps I have. God damn Snapples are tasty.
---
You too
---
FUCK BEING A SURVIVOR RN. FUCK HITBOXES. SO TILTED AFTER BEING HIT 2 SECONDS AFTER I FAST VAULT THE WINDOW. ALSO TILTED BECAUSE I DROPPED THE PALLET EARLY AND STILL GOT HIT. FINALLY, FUCK DEAD HARD. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I USED DEAD HARD AND DIDN'T GET HIT. IM BLEEDING OUT ON THE GROUND WHILE EXHAUSTED FOR FUCKS SAKE.
---
KILLERS PLEASE DONT TRY TO KEEP THE GAME GOING WHEN YOUVE SLUGGED EVERYONE.  IM NOT MAD ABOUT SLUGGING ITS YOUR ARROGANT ATTITUDE THAT PISSES ME OFF DURING THE GAME.  
---
FIRST OFF WE KNOW YOU HAVE A MORI SO YOU CAN END THE GAME AND THEN WE ALL CAN MOVE ON TO ANOTHER GAME.
---
SECONDLY DONT MESSAGE SAYING ‚ÄúI GAVE YOU GUYS A SECOND CHANCE SINCE I DOWNED YOU ALL SO QUICKLY.‚Äù
---
WHAT IM TRYING TO STRESS IS.....END.  THE.  GAME.  PLEASE.
---
Where do you get them that cheap??
---
I've only been playing this game for about two months now, I thought that was just a part of her power, I didn't realize it was a nerf
---
Even that is a stretch because they spend most of their egg and larvae life in the cell uncapped so you can clearly see it's not a fully formed bee. 
---
It's only the larvae to bee transformation that they are hidden in the comb with a wax cap
---
Whenever I think of what ruins dbd, Legion is not even on the list tbh. 
---
Bad map design is my #1 for the record.
---
Im saying when you play with your swf thats running like a well oiled machine where no one makes mistakes you can use whatever perk you want.
---
I made it to rank 3 as survivor on xbox and im mediocre at best. And i play mostly with randoms who make every mistake you can imagine.
---
Considering my survivor and killer mains are both on this, I need to have it. I know what I‚Äôm getting myself for Christmas today... üòç
---
I know what a crossplay is, but this case is a crossplay between virtual platforms, steam and Xbox PC
---
The problem with the rework is that in order to win while playing Legion as they seem to be intended (go feral, stab, fuck off, repeat) would rely heavily on certain add ons and perks such as sloppy and thanataphobia. If you can keep survivors injured constantly and halt gen progress, great, but I don‚Äôt really like playing like that. I like Legion but I also like following through with chases and not drawing out a match for twenty minutes as it tends to be with ‚Äúgood‚Äù Legions. My other issue is that their power is worthless other than tracking now due to the nerfed add ons, in my opinion. I definitely agree that the original mend function was pretty fucked up towards survivors but now I‚Äôd be lucky for someone to go down even if I was playing against rank 20s. One specific complaint I have though is that at least there was an add on that would trigger the broken status for a minute if you hit them twice. Now, it only activates if you leave the person you‚Äôre tracking and find someone highlighted by Killer Instinct. Either than or the game is just broke again... but the point is that now I‚Äôd have to be lucky with survivors being in close proximity of one another to actually get the more useful add ons to work or adjust the rest of my layout as well. 
---
Legion is definitely a viable killer and I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs impossible to 4K, but it also requires a specific play style with changes to most player‚Äôs preferred layouts in order to function well. Plus they constantly get bitched at for no reason. I‚Äôve gotten countless threats of being reported for the most random shit (please guys I‚Äôm not smart enough to know how to lag switch, etc. even if I wanted to) just because people seem to be so convinced that they‚Äôre impossible to play.
---
That is exactly my point though, when you do that this community screams ToXiC!!!
---
Really, bet
---
Jesus chris you're all autistic.
---
Awww &lt;3 I love the Legion one! These are just so cute :)
---
The number of times I‚Äôve gotten hit with ds after hooking one or even two other people is pretty damn high lol
---
Gonna be honest... the first perk is what inspired me - the rest was ad hoc... It is hard to find something new that is 1)balanced/balanceable without 2)being otherwise useless or not worth trading current meta perks and finally 3) well... novel and "neva been dun befo."   In the movie though chalk is used to make a portal to he afterlife so it makes sense she has a connection to the entity and make an escape hatch out of chalk.
---
Merry Christmas my dude &lt;3
---
It literally just takes away your perks for a game
---
Ps4 player here, this glitch actually saved my life once against an oni. I vaulted an L wall which he moonwalked but teleported back on the other side while he swung towards me. He was bamboozled.
---
Yeah, I agree with you. There‚Äôs toxicity on all sides on all games.
---
Hope it was as good for you as it was for me üíï
---
that's what she said
---
Ded 'ard man, I swear. /s
---
Cool shirt tho I feel like the pig should have been bubba chainsawing through them all lol
---
Since you only assume i only play survivor (https://prnt.sc/qfmyp3 )
---
Yea, Guess what. DBD isnt a polished game, hell we dont even have actual quality settings like most indi games do.
---
if its that big of an issue then you can use shadowborn or Monitor, or hell boost your FOV in the game files.
---
This post was literally complaining about 360s and how survivors shouldnt be able to do them. If you actually get spun in 2019 consistently enough to COMPLAIN about it, then you should go play a different game. Especially if it hurts your eyes or head
---
Love me some fans of Death Note
---
Use shadow born or Monitor, or you can up your FOV in the game files.
---
This is the 2020 vibe
---
I could feel the panic
---
Wait, that last paragraph confused me. You were following Steve BECAUSE he was sandbagging?
---
Better bee*
---
Nerves of steel there!
---
I finished it with Ghostface, Lery's offering, using the Lean Stalk add-on, using Surge, Ruin, Iron Grasp and Agitation. Would have done it in the first couple hours trying if survivors dont DC as soon as they know youre a stealth killer on Lery's :)
---
Lol
---
There is no XBOX PC it is just XBOX what are u on about?
---
excellent work!
---
Very true, but remember, it is only a video game, and we all go overboard every once in a while. And I‚Äôm not a toxic player. I see how you get that from that post. I actually have more fun in close games, I just want everybody to have a good time, that is why we play this game after all.
---
Ah, I see, thank you!
---
teach me plz
---
Good anatomy is super helpful :D I agree, OP did a great job!
---
Make an original power.
---
I agree! She is super expressive, I love it.
---
Like u/FelicitousJuliet said: Emergency (Green) Medkits only have enough charges for one full heal now. While I like the faster self heal it's an annoying and unrequested change for them to only have enough charges for one full heal, and it cucks Quentin mains to hell and back since now you *have* to bring Botany Knowledge / Self Care in order to get more than one heal out of Pharmacy, which was already a pretty bad perk in comparison to Plunderer's.
---
The definition of YEET!
---
It bounced off the jingle bells
---
Pretty woman bubba!!!!
---
I always try to make the killer feel good about the match even if he got stomped, because it's difficult knowing everyone escaped and it feels terrible, especially if you're playing a killer that you don't know, or played rarely, (plague, clown, etc). My favourite killer is plague and i let them know I appreciate them playing that as it'll increase that killers playerbase.
---
This is so weird to me, like that kind of shit is gutter-tier childish nonsense - are we 10? Can we not just play a game and be good sports about it? It's a game! Geez.
---
I had to restart my game and they showed up.
---
That first misuse of Dead Hard hurt but you brought it back with that last second use that was epic.
---
you forgot Oni in the customization menu looool
---
I always take my headphones off when i do bloodweb haha
---
What? Why would I do that? Lmao
---
Thank you very much!
---
Sounds like you want Kindred then, my man. Bond's range is too low to tell you what gens are being worked or if someone is going for save. Unless you're playing in an SWF where you deliberately always stay within Bond range, but in that case you can just communicate with each other and you shouldn't be running info perks.
---
Pallet is bigger than a locker and killers still hit me through it while they're in the stun animation and didn't even finish their full swing.
---
I don't get it
---
I know right! As soon as I found it out I was like, I NEED TO USE THIS IN A PUBLIC MATCH
---
You must've never hooked Laurie.
---
Lol and? Do you know how hard it is to think of original power? That‚Äôs balanced plus these powers are fine they are different enough to be a different playing experience
---
Yup this 100%.  He was good at one thing and one thing alone.  Tunneling down survivors individually one by one in an uncounterable fashion.  The issue was it took way too many hits to accomplish this tunnel fest so by the time you got your single down they completed X amount of the gens.  Now rinse and repeat for every individual hook state.  Say bye bye gens.
---
Yeah you're right the people that would dispute this are the ones that have no idea how to play killer and relied on his 50 missed swings into that one connected shot to decrease that Frenzy timer further as they 1v1'd each individual survivor instead of facing against the group.  He stunk out loud he was just God awful to play as or against.  As because he sucked and against because he had no counterplay to an individual chase.
---
Shape and Nightmare.
---
More specifically, that jet-like sound it makes when it overheats during the uncapped loading screen. I'm always high af when i play and it systematically scares the shit out of me, think that shit is gonna blow up soon or later..
---
Slaps on a few meta perks and gets a build named after him lmao.
---
when they mean "work on the game" they mean DLC and cosmetics, not bug fixing
---
Killer can also do it, yes but sometimes the killer has too much momentum and can bounce off the hay bail. And sometimes due to latency the game can just glitch you back onto the ground.
---
The icon for Escape at the end always looks like it‚Äôs giving the Killer a middle finger.
---
Ghostface is a lot of fun, especially when you get sneak stabs
---
Yeah but it works doesn't it and he was the one who mainly advocated the idea of it
---
I think thats the exception, but at that point its an optimization issue, not an FOV or survivor moment issue
---
S tier
---
Definitely Ghostface, he's so much fun to play as!
---
Survivors might need some buffs next patch lol ! :P
---
Thanatophobia is by no means a Meta perk without the other perks with it
---
Literally the same thing it has always been. How are you gonna crouch and repair while being carried?
---
Ghostface and the oni
---
I was attempting to do it in the first place because killers don't expect you to do the tractor tech like they can.
---
Oh yeah, that makes sense now.  I was wondering why you didn't have an ability icon.
---
FILTHY BALL OF DIRT! :D :D :D
---
9imagien using
---
Sod that the loudest sound is the intro introducing yui and oni....
---
As a killer I tend to use this tactic so damn much. People don't seem to know that they should climb up the window back again. So I simply yeet myself over to them to smack them and then they're like "oh shit I should climb back". It's great cause that's basically a guaranteed hit.
---
No more exclusives right *ba dum tsss*
---
Very true.... but let's be honest. You can't be angry at that cute piggy for killing them!
---
:) after getting downvoted to hell I honestly didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd find common ground with anyone. That‚Äôs all I was trying to get across. Thank you. Have a Merry Christmas!
---
I mean if I ever ended up so bitter I sent hate mail to somebody in any video game being sent a bunch of TIL facts would be really cool
---
For sure. It's the only killer that you can boop
---
Remember boys: never be cocky.
---
I only have my headset on in game
---
Why are you running dead hard and bl after nerf tho
---
Then again Franklin‚Äôs is now worthless to Legion as their ability won‚Äôt work with M1 perks anymore. And I do run Ruin to do something about gen rushing, but it‚Äôs mainly so that they‚Äôll leave my Devour alone until it‚Äôs too late if they manage to cleanse it. Not a fool proof strategy, but I find it a lot more fun than the thanat/sloppy combo I mentioned before. And it might not make me a good killer, but I‚Äôm not typically the kind that refuses to let survivors get any done because I just don‚Äôt find that fun to play against. I‚Äôd rather that the other side also gets to have a better experience than both of us being bored with my 4K.
---
"ItS jUsT (insert killer power) wItH eXtRa StEpS"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say that a new character, able to do a long range attack or stalk a survivor, are a copy and paste of Huntress or Michael. Those are their characteristics so it‚Äôs not lazy for killers to share a base idea.
---
theyre so adorable
---
And friendly reminder to the devs. Please.. give us party starters or we riot
---
So who did the clown's manly meat bun then?
---
If you loop I will camp you? That makes no sense so what I just have to let them catch me?
---
I can‚Äôt believe my mind buzzed right past that pun -.-
---
Ghostface for sure, and then i'd go with Myers or freddy. I'd personally go for myers just for scratched mirror. (Most fun build in the game IMO)
---
Nurses surprise ability nerf when we were told it was just addons :(
---
Like what per say?
---
i consider billy the #1 most fun because u can drive around like its a racing game. after that maybe shape because it's nice to stare at ppl and then get an easy lunge attack
---
What's scratched mirror?
---
This is the real power of booty rubbing.
---
Did he run in immediately after the Spirit hooked you though? Or did the spirit follow you in?
---
Tunneling/proxy camping is so bad in dbd right now.  Every spirit I‚Äôve had today does the old trick of walking away from the hook then phasewalking back, over and over again. I had a spirit who kept phasewalking back to the basement every time. There was no safe time to unhook, the killer wouldnt allow it via proxy cping. They kept phasewalking back hoping yo catch someone going for the unhook.
---
Sometimes you gotta just unhook and try to tank a hit before the survivor goes into the second stage. 
---
But again for those that rush in to unhook instantly before the killer has had a chance to walk away then yeah there‚Äôs no excuse
---
I looped a killer for 3 or 4 gems for my first time like two days ago and told my friend about it then, as soon as he joined me, the first thing I did was drop a pallet on the wrong side and get downed by the killer before even one gen was done.
---
Very nice job! I wonder why that huntress wasnt just taking you to the hook...
---
What is bl?
---
I think Kate does also, especially when you tvag with her

That‚Äôs cool, we don‚Äôt have to agree on everything, nor should we(no conversation to be had). What killer streamers do you find toxic? I‚Äôve always watched true talent‚Äôs vods. Ive never really found him toxic, a bit delusional and one sided( Just In my opinion). I mainly notice toxic survivor streamers. The only toxic killer that comes to mind for me is monto, who is essentially memeing. I also don‚Äôt touch twitch though only the people who upload games to YT
---
Well its all about time consumption, low ranks waste a lot of time hiding and being scared, high ranks gen rush and dick around with the killer, upper yellow to green is a mix of the two and that is where most of the salt is generated. Needless to say as a nurse main I feel neutered. I was hella exited for add-on changes, but the surprise ability nerf has sorta kinda really screwed me, its a sweaty shit show Without add-ons now, a show in which instead of grass vision like the pig or ghostface, I have ground vision from fatigue most of the match 0.0
---
Aww, they‚Äôre not delivering to where I am. I will be keeping a close eye on it though, thanks for the link!
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone would play that but you do you
---
I was literally just thinking if Mikey was in this, it'd be perfection.
---
you can't make everyone happy, but your message did make me smille. merry christmas!
---
I had a situation like that once as a killer, and there just was no hooks close enough, I didn't mean to be "cocky".
---
If you're unable to control your emotions and actions towards others, especially whilst knowing what you're doing is 'wrong', don't play Online games... There's seriously nothing wrong with that.
---
After like 7 years of playing League of Legends, I was so mad all the time, so rude and difficult to talk to (by people I was playing with, online friends, etc) that I had to take a break, it was making me in to a shitty person. Picked up single player games, had fun for a couple years, actually **enjoying** playing games, and then went back to Online games, with a new perspective; It's for everyone's enjoyment. Fun can be had in losing and winning.
---
Losing is not an excuse to be angry, winning is not an excuse to be rude, and so on.
---
Seriously mate, take a break from competitive multiplayer games if that's a way you do/know you will act. You don't have to be friends with everyone, but it takes no effort to not be rude. Merry Christmas mate.
---
\*nurse mains would like to know your location\*
---
you could also copy them, act like you have no idea what they're talking about or advertise otzcheats.com
---
It's an add-on that makes it so you can see through walls and have zero TR. It's like GF but with wall-hacks. Really fun. 
---
You don't go that fast (If you could i'd be really op) so you have to jump out and hit then leave then, then do it again. It keeps them on edge. :)

As long as you're not toxic about it it's fine imo, but if you get duped then you shouldn't cry in DMs.

Ah yes Snapple facts. They‚Äôll never know what hit them.

It sure is, good luck for the future fog escapades, I hope you nail it! I'm stuck on the 4 gen dark sense challenge now, it's my last one üëé

tell that to looping and pallets, stealth barely works with all the aura reading abilities and powers, or anyone with half decent headphones
---
I can only comment from what I see on his YouTube but then he can manipulate that to show only good games/plays. From what I've seen on there I think he's decent and entertaining

this needs more upvotes

Happy cake day üòÆand maybe there just wasn't any close enough? Or maybe she wanted the EGC down? Who knows. She definitely got hers for it though lol

It‚Äôs actually fucking aids on both like literally I cannot count the times that I‚Äôve been screwed over by it in both ways it seems like a 50/50 split to if it will laser to the target allowing you to snap around 180 degrees and hit them or it completely fuck you over
---
Psn: XcuseMe4Laughing
---
Whys he complaining about ruin you basically have to run it past yellow ranks if you're not a really good killer
---
Traps are for stalling, not killing.
---
No I doubt it
---
People get so toxic

This reminds me of the arguments i'd have on xbox live in the MW2 days when I was 10. Good times.

My go response to salt messages is ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
---
This was handed to you, I‚Äôm sorry but for your greatest escape this is kinda sad...
---
Marry christmas to you too my friend
---
Lol why would they give out teachables for a killer that just came out? The whole point is they want you to buy the dlc
---
Am I the only one who thinks shadowborn tier 1 should be baseline? Playing killer for more than a few games in a row gives me a headache. I NEED shadowborn if I‚Äôm farming bps

I‚Äôve been flaming and getting flamed sense when I was 9 playing Black Ops 2 in my Wii U
---
&gt;I don't think you know what this means.
---
I dont think you know what countering means lmao. If you're cleansing dulls, you arent doing gens. You arent countering the killer, you are doing exactly what they hope you will do. Dicking around and giving them extra time for free. If you arent doing gens or running the killer, youre wasting your time and being a shitty teammate.
---
&gt;Potentially countering the strongest comeback perk in the game is a lot stronger than you think. Also, 4 survivors can go perkless and still beat a killer with minimal teamwork.
---
If you are beating the killer so soundly that you have the spare time to cleanse all 5 totems without putting your team at risk of not powering all gens, it means the killer is shit. Noed isnt going to save them if they suck so much that survivors have that much spare time to dick around.
---
Use your D tier perk if you want to dude, just please dont end up on my team.
---
You never seen a killer walk up to a gen, not see the survivor and then have the choice of spending 2 minutes searching the area for them, or walking away instead of wasting time but then letting that survivor go back onto the gen?
---
Or how about losing a survivor in a chase which is a HUGE loss of time for the killer?
---
People pick stealth builds for this reason. Claudette, iron will, urban evasion, spine chill etc
---
You‚Äôve obviously never gone against survivors who are good at stealth. Bbq and the like does very little.
---
Yeah that's what I figured happened here. Killer was most likely banking on the clock since she knew she couldn't get me to a hook safely
---
Cum boy hmmmm tell me more.
---
Played at rank 1 with teammates at rank 15, with a rank 1 killer the other day. Needless to say, it did not go well
---
Huntress, Ghostface and Hillbilly in my opinion
---
I was gonna keep playing that game but for some reason I lost all my progress.
---
Hours of grinding, lost...
---
Balanced is still a good perk after the nerf. Only use it once per chase typically anyway and never relied on cheesy infinites to prolong chases
---
Ives seen it happen, but that is way outshadowed by the survivors that just run loop after loop and just run the killer for a few gens
---
They are?!
---
Op is the cocky one, he could have escaped through the exit gate easily, but he waited for hatch. Then all the stars alligned and he got out anyway.
---
When you activate your power huge crystal butterfly appears in the sky and fires spears, orbs, bombs and rays at survivors.
---
That's the one thing I miss about console, all the toxic arguments i'd have. Lol
---
I don't think this game has a spot for what looks like janky 2D placeholders made in Photoshop in a matter of seconds
---
Anything is viable if the killer sucks donkey cock. But if you are facing someone competent, you're gonna want perks of actual value. Not perks that synergize with urban pussyvasioning around the corner of the map cleaning dulls and hiding from nurses calling/any other detection perk because you can't win chases.

Killer or survivor?
---
forgot ruin lol
---
Streamers. Watch them. This game is played differently than how you think.
---
Did you think you could talk sense into someone that sends messages like that?
---

Refund it while you can.
---
There's no reason to run 2 exhaustion perks though. They just interfere with each other
---
Yes but why two exhaustion perks
---
Filthy neckbeard
---
Doesn‚Äôt fit the theme neither would he make a good killer
---
Merry Christmas!
---
Not typically for me. Balanced is often too situational for me to use it every time (especially on maps like Shelter Woods), but it's very handy when I can use it (in which case, DH isn't really important to me)
---
The hatchet at 1:20 went right through you :/ 
---
Good one though! Just had the dedicated servers on your side for the added luck :D
---
So you‚Äôre not a proper killer if you use Ruin? I guess 90% of red rank killers aren‚Äôt good at the game then huh?
---
So doing the objective? The whole point of surv is do gens
---
That dead hard though...
---
PreTeNdiNg To FaRm Is a LeGiT sTrAt
---
Just looked like impossibly lucky DH timing to me, but maybe the servers did help me there
---
No they're not
---
Meg's aren't good they're called Meg heads for a reason
---
I'd by a trapper and mike and ash and probably the clown...
---
Wow all before level 20? Lucky man. I have yet to have the nightmare of leveling a bunch of times without getting level 3 for all my perks. But i also only have 9 people that have teachables so not likely for a while.
---
&gt; PADORU
---
Missed a chance to use the superior version:
---
WAHDORU WAHDORU
---
See, that's even better. That's atleast twice that DS has been on the shrine this year then.
---
I was criticizing your viewpoint but not in a venomous or personal manner.  You're really conducting yourself in an extremely immature manner.  I meant no personal insult.  We were just two people discussing something that honestly wasn't a big deal to begin with.  You need to work on your social skills a bit.
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs worth it man. I‚Äôd rank BT as a top 5 perk hands down.
---
Every escape should be as epic as this
---
I would‚Äôve LOL‚Äôd all in their chat. Well done. Sluggers are the worst.
---
It lights up. I think the range is 32 meters though.
---
That is some fishy stuff right there. Hmmm...
---
Aight ty.
---
Had this happen. But with 3 different challenges. This one was enough of a bitch without that already.
---
Guys don't support this guy.  He got butthurt over a completely innocent comment of mine on a completely different and unrelated thread and now he is literally spamming my recent comment history with this.  He isn't participating in the thread he's just trolling me across multiple posts.
---
If you hear the terror radius, don't unhook unless they're either seconds away from dying or you have BT. I don't get how this is so hard to understand
---
Bees don't give birth people! Open your eyes! The government is hiding the truth!
---
#beeslayeggs
---
I was wrecking him with him till rank 8. Now I'm just matched with red rank swfs who shit on me repeatedly. He gets looped soooo easily. He counts on out of place survivors way too much.
---
Seriously man are you like 6?  Why spam my comment history with this?  It just shows how petty and small you are.  Just move on dude.  I promise to never make the mistake of thinking you're a rationale sub member worth engaging with.  It'll never happen again.  I'll know how incapable of objective discussion you are.
---
Yes it is, I‚Äôve watched a few people play on Twitch and I can‚Äôt wait to get started!
---
I just looked.. It was actually created a month ago lol
---
ojk
---
Someone else said the same :( maybe I could buy a few and ship them over!
---
Yeah i wouldn't follow a meghead's lead
---
It must be exhausting for griefers to whine the same way over and over again
---
Me neither but I don‚Äôt have a choice...
---
This so hard
---
I literally took twenty seconds at the end of a normal match to get this challenge done with someone willing and let her go as agreed.  I don‚Äôt see how I ruined the match.
---
I seriously hope that they release those skins on the other platforms eventually.
---
I thought everybody knew?
---
You are indeed wrong on this
---
Who tf is Mickey?
---
I get bullied trying to practice with him, and I don't have a great deal of fun. but I'm trying to learn
---
It‚Äôs because when he‚Äôs raising his kanebo it blocks like most of your screen, so when it‚Äôs in the air and you‚Äôre already attacking, you just have to hope they‚Äôre dumb enough to be in the same spot.
---
I managed to do it on one game because I was against survivors who were farming eachother
---
This fckn sub, I swear.
---
But did yall actually wait?
---
Not nearly enough Dwights, Santa‚Äôs workshop is so understaffed
---
Seriously it is silly how some of these members are lol.  I said that comment to him in a non-offensive way on an unrelated thread and he lost it and started spamming my recent comment history with it.  It is absurd how childish some of the members can be here.
---
DH was used at 1:25 :P
---
Button click so you can kick the farming claudette off your ass.
---
"Get the fuck off me you monkey, not when the Wraith is literally around the corner"
---
one is annoying
---
the other literally denies someone the ability to play the game
---
youre totally justified tho. tunneler
---
Oh shi I didn't even notice Myers till you mentioned.
---
Bing Bong Boi is the cutest here.
---
Killer main here, even I can say well played.  Entire she should have hooked you lol
---
I just got gf on sale leveling him up, any tips.
---
Freddy's in the dreams.
---
I would own that Ace one already if it were a thing, great job OP!
---
Ah, my mistake. That first one probably just looked weird due to a bad camera angle. From the killers perspective I think it would've missed to the left
---
And Bubba loves his chainsaw.
---
"Six feet under" nervous laughing...
---
Ds nuts
---
BHVR literally said Jason as a free pass into the game as soon as he‚Äôs open
---
I am completely justified I also didn't completely tunnel him  He just kept coming straight up to me trying to get my attention because he wanted to loop me so I gave him what he wanted and I kept going after him.
---
 If you're going to run in front of the killer when hes chasing someone don't get mad when he switches targets when you literally started the game by flashlight clicking him.
---
 I didn't deny him the ability to play the game in fact all of his team mates got away and everyone was hooked twice his 2nd hook I just made sure he died because he deserved it
---
Yeah could've been that too :)
---
Get pig and have fun having your snoot booped. Then even if you lose the game you win!
---
Would totally buy one.
---
nah if you see people right there why should you leave. ignore these ignorant people
---
Over 90% of all players matches? I don't think it's that common tbh
---
Don't want to piss on your bonfire but BHVR have come out a while back and said they won't make a killer that disguises as a survivor. But they also said they wouldn't make a clown killer which they did.
---
But if they were the make one this is probably not the power they would have chosen. The power seems very weak if I understand correctly, so you can see who is the real one and the fake one. The perks are also killer specific, all perks int he game are neutral IE anyone can sue them and they would work.
---
That's a really shitty way to escape.
---
Had to go poopoo
---
How is it the Jake‚Äôs fault that the newer players were getting tunnelled? That‚Äôs on the killer.
---
Some people just choose to play more altruistically. 
---
Was he farming off hook, or what? Because I don‚Äôt really see what he was doing wrong. If gens were getting popped, why would he not go for saves
---
I disagree
---
below that is "Oni in the cosmetics store"
---
Ok boomer
---
Fun is subjective, if you like sneaking up on survivors play a stealth killer like Wraith, Pig or Ghostface. Maybe you like to play more strategic so play Hag or Trapper. Maybe you just like to wreck everyone and their families, play Nurse. play a few games of the killers you got and see if you find one that you really like.
---
Also a killer can still be fun even if they are considered bad. For example, before Freddy's rework I had over 700 hours on just him, why? Cause I found him fun the play and I also really love the movies.
---
From what I was able to gather only stuns that caused a regular stun animation to play counter. So no saving, no invis wraith stuns, even a Myers mid-stalk stuns didn‚Äôt count. Just regular stuns.
---
Seriously. Ace is the quietest survivor. 
---
https://youtu.be/P0aFo4lPARw
---
say goodbye to event items since we're likely never having an event again
---
The F13 game is officially dead. So when ever the lawsuit is over, which could be next year
---
guess I'll have to play with my non-existent survivors to finally rank up and get a game then ;-;
---
It's OK they can do it again in 40 seconds provided they stand still.
---
You realize you have no argument so you go to insults. Nice. Continue to have ass-backwards logic, "dude."
---
I could just farm Bill, but... tHe BlOoDpOiNt eCoNoMY
---
wdym by copyright hell?
---
Laughs in Doctor and Freddy.
---
Idk for sure but it might be a copyright thing since it isn't officially being sold by behavior and looks fan made.
---
I‚Äôm not a baby but I sometimes drop pallets way to early because I don‚Äôt expect them to respect
---
To be fair, Dead Hard is so buggy nowadays that you gotta use it early sometimes. Didn't work out in this case.
---
Can really only see it being console crossplay if or when it happens
---
36m is too low? it's 1/3rd of the freakin map when you're on a gen near the corner. It's big enough for my liking.
---
This comment makes zero sense. You quite literally cannot get stuns it you ‚Äúpreemptively drop the pallet early.‚Äù That inherently means throwing it in a way where you simply head off the killer without a stun.
---
Also, in regards to your point later down about stuns and hits, you don‚Äôt actually block the killer until the pallet is down so they hit you before it goes down then it goes down and stuns them but in real time you can‚Äôt tell.
---
He's the guy with the teir
---
Don't be a dick and never visit the forums.
---
Just... Walk towards them and start hitting them?
---
He was aware that his unhooks led to this Claudette getting tunneled. And it‚Äôs the killers fault for doing what they are supposed to do? He had enough experience to know what was going on
---
That hatchet bounced off you at the end, nice. I can just imagine the killer panicking and slamming their drink down and grabbing their controller when you got up
---
I love running I‚Äôm All Ears on killers who struggle with loops that have windows.
---
Thought Huntress was Jane at first
---
Yeah two of the other survivors were like "Jake shut the fuck up and read you dumbass, he literally just said..."
---
The fourth was like "What kind of fucking business calls their employees on Christmas Eve?"
---
Thanks for the comment; I didn't feel bad about this happening, since I don't really care about escaping too much and this was so hilarious I was laughing.
---
Also, I asked the claudette in post game chat and they apologized to me for leaving. They didn't even know they body blocked me, and they also apologized for that. It was all around incredibly unlucky and ended up pretty funny.
---
Or if some teammate who doesn't run it gets the unhook like a second before you'd be able to.
---
can't argue with the math, thanks man
---
Ok, a question. What are you doing about the other 2 survivors? Just because you feel that easy targets exist doesnt mean they should be priority. Go after the other 2. Until end game there is always other things you can be doing to gain map advantage or pressure survivors without downing someone whose just been hooked. 
---
Also if you have 2 survivors hooked at once, thats major pressure. The last time ive ever gotten pissed because survivors were unhooking each other and needed to pressure just unhooked survior was when actual infinite loops existed. Before ds existed. 
---
I main wraith 1/3 of my games are merciless. And its only when faced with a red rank swf that I have trouble breaking 25k. Never has someone DS'd me and it's really effected how the overall game was going. If its a bad game and I get DS'd, its a bad game. If its a good game and I get DS'd it remains a good game. Even in end game collapse and the survivor escaped. Usually they deserve it. Usually they are good players. Usually I'm not going to throw a bitch fit when the game ends, I end up with ruthless and 25k bps instead of a 4k.
---
lmao, thanks shrine, second time he give exactly what i want
---
You really shouldn't interact with these types of people.
---
He's in tier 1 so he's hard to spot
---
Spine Chill underrated lmao
---
The devs said it‚Äôs not the intended playstyle/is not very nice. But like I just said, it is still a play style and obviously killers are allowed to do it.
---
That isn‚Äôt Jakes fault. I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre blaming him for the killers choice of play style. 
---
Even if you unhooked, or if your other teammates unhooked, the survivor would still be tunnelled. So why are you blaming the Jake? 
---
You just left a teammate to die for hardly any reason at all. Jeez grow up
---
And Jason's soo snug
---
Sure, Jan.
---
Can't spell waste and wants your address!!?!
---
What a freak.
---
I had a game running furtive chase for the challenge resently so I was hooking my obsession all the time. When there were 2 people left and obsession killed herself on the hook I hooked Claudette and then made her DS me so I have obsession again. When I hooked her she killed herself and I gave the last survivor the hatch. In the post game chat Claudette told me I'm a tunneler and commented my steam profile saying I'm tunneler and facecamper (I went on the other side of the map for last survivor to save her cause I wanted to hook obsession 1 more time). I still do not understand why the fuck did she call me facecamper and tunneler when I was the opposite of that
---
To be fair he spelled waist right. Just the wrong kind
---
Honestly so excited for you, I got introduced to it by my roommate on PC about 2 years ago and fell in love with the damn game. As soon as I could I got the game and a PS4 after playing it off other people‚Äôs consoles. It‚Äôll be rough at first but I hope you enjoy it!
---
The main reason is because of map pressure. If I go after the two other survs I‚Äôm in a 1v1 chase while the other three are doing things, if I come back to the hook I can pressure and track 2 (and sometimes 3) survs and keep the pace of the game under my control.
---
Also worth noting I main Hag so the unhooked players are also in my web which is the area of the map I‚Äôm trying to control and pressure (with the closest 3 gens on the map to keep regressed)
---
This isn't karma. This is a toxic survivor letting a Jake die for no reason
---
this always goes both ways. The simplest thing you can always do is ignore it, people who plaster every single hate message they get on forums and reddit and actually give the BM a reaction, or even worse BM back at someone else are just as guilty as the toxic assholes.
---
You know how many times I don't bring DS or BT and am met with a facecamping killer who Mori's someone like a minute into the match then viciously nods over their corpse just after having smacked them half a dozen times on the hook? Plenty
---
You know how many times I let it get to me and ruined the next match for the next killer/survivors by bringing the "OP" stuff. Never. It isn't hard to grow up and not let what someone does in a video game trigger you so much.
---
This is commonly known as "tractor tech". It's easy to do as killer by lunging towards the hay bales then at the singular bale at the top.
---
Between Nurse blink hits not working, Myers can't stalk properly half the game, and Huntress hatchets hitting targets and not doing anything... makes playing medium to high skill killers harder to play.
---
SOMEONE SHOULD PUT IT IN A POST WITH SOME EXAMPLES AS IMAGES.
---
It depends honestly, most of the time it ends badly
---
Lol!
---
All of these ranks are within +6 or -6 from the killers rank. BHVR says there isn‚Äôt anything wrong with this.
---
No idea, perhaps it was a camping Spirit
---
I know it's commenly know as the tractor tech, I use it as killer all the time. It's not commenly done by Survivors at all.
---
Did this doofus message you and then tell you to go away?
---
what do you use to edit?
---
Don't mind me I'll just be over here with my camera, carry on gentlemen.
---
Note that I only put on hexes so survivors would destroy them and get more BP. Everybody's gonna get double BP, it's gonna be great.
---
Imagine complaining about people complaining about survivors doing the objective.
---
Hey! I got the trophy! I did around 6 full heals to other players.
---
I dont think they dont understand its more like: I unhook infront of the Killer and if he goes for the poor soul we can blame the Killer for tunneling.. which is worse than not knowing what safe unhook means...
---
Camt to bbq for the aura 
---
Stayed because it's a free survivor pudding
---
Exactly
---
In the name of survivor mains, I apologize for the first one.
---
You didn't, people just need stuff to complain about sometimes.
---
This is normal matchmaking not a post.  You're within the 6 levels.  Please refrain from oversaturated posts.
---
Bless your soul x4
---
Kill them. They don't deserve mercy
---
no you :*
---
If I wasn‚Äôt poor I‚Äôd give gold lmao
---
Hey, you know what? If you could get a high res scan of the print and upload it somewhere then anyone who wants it and can't get it can just go to a T-shirt printer shop and get one. Much easier.
---
that would heal me too ngl
---
Not_Queen (BhVR dev) stated we would see different things like this with the ranking system over the holidays on their live dev stream last week. They are aware of a ranking problem and won‚Äôt be doing anything until after the first of the year.

Had a killer today that got toxic within one minute... Tried to hook me in the basement and carried all over the map. After my escape he camped within the range of kindred and reported us survivors in the end.

Bruh Im rank 19 killer and I got rank 4

Yup, that was too early.

She was still in the pickup animation when the blind happened, which leads to essentially nothing. Keep practicing the timing and you‚Äôll get it!
---
Kinda confused why the nurse just doesn‚Äôt blink tho.
---
it would seem you were just a tiny bit too early. that's a shame
---
him too
---
He saying you should kill yourself XD it‚Äôs called game mechanics and anyone can chose to use them
---
No no I mean specifically you're in a farming game with a farmer killer who is actively trying to farm with the 4 survivors and hook each twice while providing unhooks to everyone and they'll still immediately knock dude back to ground after unhook.  In that scenario I have to assume the killer doesn't know about the safe hook rule because otherwise you aren't really farming unhooks you're denying the person making those saves every time when all you had to do is alternate between the survivor hooks so the 15 seconds passes.  I literally had to dead hard immediately and juke for 15 seconds just to make sure my teamate gets the credit against these guys lol.  I just don't think they understand the mechanic.
---
Thats why i would love to see a Killer Perk which blocks Survivor from unhooking a First Hook for 60sec. (Similar how Thrilling Tremors blocks a gen)(Hook Timer would be paused for its duration and resume after he is unblocked).
---
I wasn't planning to be toxic in fact I was planning to show mercy just because it's Christmas.  But then this God literally started the game by flashlight clicking me and tea bagging he then proceeded to consistently get in my way when I was going after somebody else because he was trying to get me to Chase him so he could distract me.
---
 Clearly he knew the loops very well because he was doing a very good job of staying away from me which didn't bother me but he decided to be talks a great at the very start so I decided to be talks a great back and win the all the generators were powered everybody had been hooked twice except for him I ended up catching him off guard and getting him so I camped his ass and let everyone else escape
---
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS FELLOW FOG TRAVELERS!!! HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A HAPPY FUCKING NEW YEAR AS WELL AND FUCK ALL YOU CAMPERS LATELY, SANTA HATES YOU!

THE FUCKING DEVS ARE AWARE OF THIS AND SAID THEY WONT BE FIXING ANY FUCKING THING UNTIL THE NEW YEAR!
---
Once the exit gates are open I don‚Äôt even go to them. You ain‚Äôt tbagging me!!
---
Well yeah, you directly said you do toxic things so naturally I'm going to get that you're toxic from that post. 
---
It's only a game and everyone having a good time is why I don't add on to the toxicity. It doesn't end the tunneling, it throws bad feelings on the killer and stops the immediate impact of tunneling. The feeling from being tunneled is still there. Now it's just the killer is annoyed too. It's only a game, so don't be toxic in the name of winning it
---
I think flip-flop should be increased by 10 percent atleast and Buckle Up should increase the healing speed of Survivors in the dying state
---
Happened to me too. Exact same thing on Gas Heaven.
---
I was so happy that I didn't have to deal with and DC's.
---
Its spanish for son of a whore.
---
Long story short: the original creator of Jason and the studio that has made the Friday the 13th films are in the middle of a drawn out lawsuit over who has the rights to use Jason. Until it's decided, he can't be used in any way.
---
That being said, the devs have said multiple times that Jasom has an open invitation to the game so if/when the lawsuit ends, he most likely be added.
---
Woah these are so good! I‚Äôd get every DBD Funko
---
Yeah, I've just stopped using it all together. It's very frustrating.
---
I'll see what I can do :D
---
sounds like a shit ton of work
---
As a fun little tip, I personally try to start the bling whenever the killers hand is next to their head, when they do that last little ‚ÄúOomph‚Äù to get them up on their shoulder and the survivor does a little bounce. Shoddy description but if you look at the pickup animation a bit, you might see what I mean! Hope it helps and merry Christmas!
---
Freddy next to Jason is just asking for trouble
---
Yeah, it was worth it though.
---
Agree. I don't know what the reasoning is for not counting it as a kill, but I think it would be a positive change if DCs did count as kills.
---
Wawawawawawawwawawawawawawwawawa!
---
judging by the direction they went this year with the nonexistent winter event i think we're in for a disappointing Lunar New Year this year. It's a shame because it was really popular
---
This is something...
---
"Its insane how little I care." Me literally always
---
wanted to start making videos of dbd because me and my group are pretty entertaining past midnight. Figured editing would be hard but not that many steps for a SINGLE frame
---
merry Christmas!
---
I wasted a lot of time I didn't need to.
---
I've been doing Burger King Myers all day, I've actually killed a few survivors with it
---
I don't like those players as well... Trying to distract, okay, but the kicking is bullshittery. I hope you'll get more of the decent and nice or at least quiet players
---
Wait theres voice chat on dbd now??
---
Baby player located

I had someone tell me to uninstall after he was hooked and died. I didn't get hooked the whole game and almost escaped yet I'm the shitty one. He didn't even get a gen done then told me he's played with kids just like me and hates it because we have no idea what's going on. I'm not going to save you when the killer is face camping, shit happens. He was like, well you could do both. Nah I'm good man. He got upset about that. It's a game, you're supposed to have fun. If you have hate and rage the whole game, maybe it's not the one for you. Not a big damn deal
---
Play the tutorials in game - they give you the basics and some bloodpoints. Play the game without the expectation of nailing it right away - luck and chance play into this game as much as skill and ability, so just try to enjoy the fun of the game whether you are winning or losing (whatever that even means in this game). 
---
Watch some tip videos to gain some extra knowledge. Check out the DBD official forums, there was a contest a few months ago for new player guides, I am sure you can find that stuff there still!
---
And have a good time :) Don't sweat it, don't worry about the salty folks, enjoy the game.
---
I admire moments like these!
---
No that‚Äôs the Xbox party voice overlay option turned on
---
Just sayin operation health was a disaster game seemed to be at its worst during it so be careful what you wish for
---
Omega oof
---
dude how did you get so much of every item
---
Fair enough. I dont know anything about it as I dont play siege, but on paper it seems like a good idea. What was so bad about it?
---
yeah sounded like you did a lot
---
And maybe a hit to the head
---
Merry Camper, Christmas.
---
If so, can you provide a source with the autoaim patch?
---
Holy shit! That's what that killer gets for playing around lol

First: Tue Basic Game

Second: DLC you want (I prefer the licensed DLC like Myers, Stranger Things, Freddy etc)

Third: Maybe some clothing for your Favorite character (if you have one)

I would choose wisely and just buy the things that you REALLY want and then wait for the next chapters so you have enough money ready if you like them to buy.

IT OK SHE IS FUN AND HER OTHER PERKS ARE FINE.
---
Yeah, I'm used to after effects on PC but I don't have a computer
---
Confused, but okay üëå
---
I already had them;-; she's fun I'll give you that
---
This is one reason I wish we had a few more emotes. Nothing elaborate, no dancing, but still.
---
Always boop the snoot.
---
when are they gonna bring back the firecrackers like they said they were going to
---
I just got one so I figured I could edit on it since it's a decent laptop. But literally no idea how to lol
---
I've leveled up Freddy since long before his rework happened, and have been sitting on them all ever since.
---
Clown has the best anti-loop potential in the game, but zero map pressure. Clown tends to get stomped pretty hard. Of all the non-licensed Killers, I'd personally suggest Plague. She has a similar focus on range, plays well with other freebie Killer perks like Thanatophobia, and two of her perks, Corrupt Intervention and Infectious Fright are meta perks on most Killers, especially the latter. Also, she's more likely to snowball compared to Clown.
---
Clown is still a good pick since Pop Goes the Weasel and Bamboozle are good perks too, but the Killer flies in the face of running loops and isn't really the best pick for a newer player.
---
You may also want to consider Doctor soon, considering he's getting his revamp soon, and Monitor and Abuse is a great perk on a number of Killers.
---
I FUCKING JUMPED FROM THAT HOLE ON FLOOR 2 OF HAWKINS, JUST TO GET FUCKING TELEPORTED BACK TO THE TOP AGAIN FOR NO REASON AND THAT FUCKING BUBBA SMACKED MY ASS FOR IT

Ohhhhh thankyou lol that explains, i was bouta hop on and HOPE someone tunnels me üíÄüéÖüèø merry christmas man

hopefully if they ever do cross progression they‚Äôll let us have our cosmetics on every platform

"Ignoramous cum boy" I'll have to use that
---
THe spirit goes "WAH" a lot, especially in the select screen. She was worse about it on the PTB so it became a joke.
---
Kills also shouldn't depip when someone dcs and the survivors get crushed
---
I can't think of one (an editor) for pc since I only used after effects when I had one and it's been years.
---
Nothing toxic about SWF. Enjoy the game, have a great time, get some beers or drinks and just have a blast with it. It's great to see more people playing, welcome to the Fog!
---
In B4 the dumb ‚ÄúAdrenaline is survivor NOED‚Äù. Even though you get to use adrenaline when you win and you get to use NOED if you lose.
---
Should've done bones instead of genrush
---
This was my old runescape username I created when I was like 7 lmao. Didn‚Äôt realize how gay it was until I was like 15 and was too lazy to change it until like a year ago
---
Honestly that feels like it should be an accomplishment.
---
Instead of Urban Evasion, use Quick and Quiet. Become a ninja.
---
sorry for the grainy image, had to use my phone camera and it is not good at getting moving images
---
If they show up in the he shrine of secrets you can get them. 
---
Don't know if it finally got fixed but using an offering to play as bubba would "unlock" him and if you had the bloodpoints saved up you could unlock his perks then.
---
If he didn't cover his eyes when he attacked with his power, it would be a lot better.
---
I wAnT tO sPeAk To YoUr MaNaGeR
---
Yeah that makes sense. The streamer I watch is a high rank. My friends and I just want to dick around and have fun. We‚Äôre just not huge fans of toxicity and we don‚Äôt want to be part of the problem.
---
You can try submitting a support ticket on BHVRs website
---
Yos thiccness side boob
---
(Survior main)
---
Yea NOED is a pain in the ass, but you should only be upset if its run on (spirit, legion, trapper, or nurse) on top of ruin and youre choice of meta perks
---
If youre against a wraith or leatherface, then you better be cleansing totems.
---
NOED on strong killers with good perks means your boosted  
---
NOED on medium to weak killers is to be expected
---
Run a map and punish killers who boost themselves with NOED
---
CAPS, WHERE ARE THE CAPS?!
---
Nah just get them from the Shrine of Secrets.  Both perks show up there sporadically.  Double check the Shrine everytime it updates to see if they have any useful DLC perks for toons you don't own.
---
I'm glad that's true. This game has more than enough toxicity as it is lmfao. If you want the least toxicity then stay at low ranks and keep having fun with your friends, the moment you start taking it seriously and going for high ranks is the moment it becomes less fun and more toxic. The problem with a game built like this is that everyone thinks they are entitled to win every game when that's just not the case. Then they get salty they didnt, and all the bullshit comes out full force
---
Did he just drop a "ur gay" at the bottom is he literally 13
---
But muh feelings! Evil survivors pressing crouch key :'(
---
I wish I got responses that interesting. I think the Christmas period is doing something, though. Usually people just call me out for being a terrible, camping, tunneling crap player (sometimes I camp and tunnel simultaneously, apparently, and tunnel three out of the four survivors), but I had someone wish my mother dead yesterday. After a fairly standard Myers game that they lost because they're terrible at prioritizing.
---
Is there any way to not increase rank. It does it just come naturally.
---
We have no interest in red ranks.
---
Who cares what others think? He can play however he wants to just like all of us can play however we want to.
---
It's all cool mate. You're important to you, if that's all you're able to comprehend. We wouldn't want you getting all stroppy and confused that other people exist.
---
Always a good idea to step back if you are feeling salty :) If it ain't fun, put it down! Hope you are having a great day tho!
---
When I don't camp, matches are easy for me until I get to the ranks where people have played longer than me.
---
There's nothing strong about survivor right now. It's the maps that can make the game harder for killers and the fact that there is no second objective to make up for the fact that chasing one player without Ruin can allow gens to get done fast.
---
I've never seen anyone call me boosted in post game chat because I run Ruin or NOED unless that survivor did shit all game. Most of the time the survivors don't give a fuck about me having brought those perks or are just like "Close one but he had NOED." 
---
"FYI you cant "counter" a face camping leatherface." Say that to all my survivor maining friends. They'd say "Do gens and get out" because even if the camping killer has NOED, most of the time they'll stay camping whoever is on the hook even when the gens are finished.
---
good killers have been able to kill survivors even when they had "insta med, insta blind, more pallats, more windows, more "infinites", better items, better perks"
---
I never said insta heal is OP. Pallet spawns on preschool were nerfed because it made the game harder for killers because of how safe those pallets were. M1 killers easily ate those pallets because of that. Inside maps suck for non stealth killers because they're generally easy to loop if you know how to use the windows to your advantage. 
---
This game is literally a casual game. You don't need to be so salty over camping. If the game was competitive, then camping and tunneling would be nerfed and Wraith would get a buff.
---
When I get hatemail I just reply "*farts" and say nothing else after cuz it looks funny lol
---
I prefer not too, nor ruin. Devour hope, is a suitable enough replacement, and it feels good when I earn all 5 tokens. More enjoyable for sure.
---
"Special" Editon
---
Farming is super fucking annoying honestly, I want too play not be held hostage in a match for 15 minutes because you can't get a challenge.
---
You can spend any points you earn on any character, so no need to feel locked in to any character you want to level :)
---
Do people actually say that
---
Who do you already have?
---
That's a tough question. All I can really recommend is to not play well lol. If you arent too good at the game that shouldn't be a problem but as you get better you may start just ranking up without even realizing it. At that point all I can reccomend is intentional deranking on your own time, which in itself is a pretty toxic thing to do, but if your just dicking around with your friends and you dont want to play sweaty rank 1s all should be good. As long as the intention isnt to bully low rank killers then your safe in my books, but as I'm sure you noticed many people that play this game have conflicting opinions. At the end of the day just do what you feel you should be doing to have fun without ruining it for everyone else :)
---
Oh you were in injured state, that makes more sense
---
Yea i either do that or just tab out and watch a vid or something
---
I don't know who he is, but there's always going to be a toxic survivor or SWF squad. At the same time, there's always going to be toxic killers, camping/tunneling killers, etc. It's just something in the game that we have to deal with. 
---
I don't think people like or have fun going against toxic killers and survivors, but there is a certain satisfaction you get from overcoming an extremely toxic survivor (team)/killer.
---
exactly, where did I get wrong, can you explain me so I can learn
---
Bigbrain: do totems
---
You see where you messed up is you actually hit him. Everyone knows huntress hatches only hit when they miss.
---
*instead of the objective
---
Well i upvote yours, because negativity cant be fixed by more negativity &lt;3
---
Mainly grammatical using the word worst instead of worse and stuff like that
---
uhm, yeah it is :D
---
If they added a totem counter I would have 0 complaints about noed.
---
ugh what a massive waste of time :( Sorry you had those buttheads bothering you! Geez!
---
i love how u barely got any perks but have a full set of cosmetics
---
thx :)

Uhm, yeah, it is. Do u wanna be my friend? :D

For a long time, after getting hate mail I would just reply either ‚ÄúRobin Hood Enriched &amp; Pre-Sifted All Purpose Flour,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBetamethasone Valerate‚Äù
---
Got lucky with flashlight clicking corner camper who was to dumb to not step in the trap I set mid path on her 3rd attempt to wiggle and flee- and her buddy who couldn't do gens for shit after the first 2 deaths
---
&gt; Yeah but those focus on a lot of the new bugs created with the new chapter
---
I take it you don't understand how coding works but still feels knowledgeable enough to tell devs what to do. They can create new bugs when fixing other bugs due to how their coding is written.
---
For this reason, stopping new content to fix bugs that might never end would be a mistake. They fix what they can along the way of the roadmap. 
---
&gt;And theres still issues that those dont fix.
---
Every patch they fix a shitload of bugs (and introduce new ones) but people never bother to read patch notes. Give me some examples of bugs you want them to fix, so I can understand what you are talking about.
---
Good. It absolutely neutered stealth Killers prior to them getting Undetectable. Someone could run OoO on a SWF and completely deny any form of surprise by Wraith or Pig, and made Trapper virtually useless.
---
I'm sorry, but where the fuck do you see them waiting for the hatch? they ran right past it then ran back once they saw the huntress coming that way
---
For such a dead looking woman the Spirit sure has that hair game on point.
---
Totem counter? What do you mean by this? I mean I'm not gonna be one to defend noed, I just want to very clearly say fuck noed, but there are counters, totem spawns on most maps are braindead easy, usually takes me under 2 minutes to find all 5 totems on coldwind, azarovs, Macmillan's, etc. And there are maps that can also find totems so there are definitely counters, people just want to do gens instead of looking for totems because we like games that only last 5 minutes here
---
You can't fight crime if you ain't cute
---
Where could i find the hand?
---
ALL YOU UPPER RANKS THAT DC ON FIRST FUCKING HOOK ONLY TO ABANDON THE LOW RANK NEW PLAYERS DESERVE TO WATCH A TEN MINUTE CUTSCENE OF BABY DWEET CRYING ON GAME RESTART
---
Nobody mentioning the steamboat horn? I never want to work or patrol that gen because I don't want to get tinnitus.
---
Youre killing me with how dense you are.
---
" There's nothing strong about survivor right now "
---
yea thats right, it was all nerfed to oblivion. You want to tell me maps are hard for killer. really? there have been nerfs to pallats, windows, infinites,  jungle gyms, and tile orientation. If you havent realized you basically said "the only thing hard about killer is the map (survivor sided maps)" So tell me, if maps werent "hard for killer" then you would be playing fish in a barrel...
---
I dont know what kind of crap youre saying with "my survivor maining freinds say 'do gens get out'"
---
yea obviously, but it would be nice if i had the miniscule chance of saving someone on hook against a leatherface who is close proxy or face camping. tell me exactly how youre 'survivor main' freinds are able to save their face camped teammates without doing a 1 for 1. 
---
DBD is a casual game, but at the very least killers shouldnt be surprised when they are called boosted playing like \*above\* and at the VERY least you can at least admit its a whole lot easier killing survivors now than pre patch 4.0 because all the "op" parts of survivor have been nerfed.
---
As long as you don't try harder than you want to, it should solve itself. Don't put on meta perks you don't want, take some chances on some cooler plays, etcetera. It's hard to avoid getting ranked to the start of the 'black pips' (used to be 16, at least for killers, I don't know if they've changed it), but beyond that you probably need to try somewhat to hit red ranks even with inherent talent. Especially with SWFs, since that means more than 1/4th of the survivors are on the same page, so you can't get accidentally 'carried' by harder-working Survivors. If you absolutely want to derank, I'd advise 'gimmick builds' (perk choices that are decidedly sub-optimal, but may be fun) or leveling other characters, rather than intentionally losing. If you can't derank by playing a 'bad' build competitively, you might belong at your current rank.
---
It's not that uncommon to run specifically these two.
---
BL is really good when it works, but it's pretty situational
---
Dead hard is easy to use, but also somewhat glitchy and unreliable at times, but great for when you can't trigger BL
---
I love how we don't have Jason in DBD,  but the community has already fully accepted him as our own.  
---
It's so sweet in a weird murdery way
---
YOU‚ÄôD THINK THIS WOULD BE UPVOTED SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN JUST GET THIS FUCKING CHALLENGE OVER WITH ALREADY
---
#IT‚ÄôS RANCOR TIME
---
This is pretty accurate.
---
Counter as in a visible cue onscreen displaying how many totems are left on the map, similar to how it displays how many gens are left to do. Counting up the totems, not counterplay.
---
APPARENTLY SHARING MY STRATEGY IS BAD?
---
If you have time to "complete the objective" in under 5 minutes then I'm sure you have time to rub some bones :) just so it while your looking for ruin
---
He doesn't like it when you're IN a gen
---
My only issue is that the servers are god awful and I feel like there is quite a bit of accidental dc due to the game. 
---
That being said that‚Äôs the only reason I have dropped from a game and I find it frustrating when people see ghost face and dc
---
I've actually had people get too cocky with the t-bagging and end up getting tombstoned
---
THEY DON'T EVEN GET THE PALLET STUN. THEY DROP IT AS SOON AS THEY SEE IT AND THE KILLER IS 10 FEET AWAY.
---
Uhhh wow I'm fucking stupid lmfao. My bad. Yeah a counter would be nice
---
Plenty of people do.
---
OR MAYBE I‚ÄôM JUST SICK OF THE KILLER‚ÄôS FAT FUCKING ASS STICK SMACKING ME WHEN THERE IS CLEARLY A COLORFUL PIECE OF WOOD BETWEEN US 
---
SINCERELY, A SURVIVOR BANNED FROM PROPER VAULTS
---
save them to buy the next pass for basically free
---
jUsT sAy No
---
Tunnelling is focusing one survivor until they‚Äôre dead. Trying to take aggro means nothing if a killer is tunnelling. 
---
Also it‚Äôs not ‚Äòhow dare the killer‚Äô because they can play how they want, it‚Äôs just not fun for either sides. This isn‚Äôt even an entitled survivor hates tunnelling thing because I can see why you would tunnel, but it‚Äôs weird that you‚Äôre blaming the killer tunnelling on a survivor.
---
Awesome
---
Damn bro :o How long did it take?
---
I'm sure killers endure a lot of BS... but man the amount of times i get hit by hatchets that completely miss or get hit through windows after i fast vault and lithe-sprint 3 meters definitely balances it out
---
I've been in a single match like that as a killer. It... Wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped. I'm guessing the other killer was cheating somehow (I certainly wasn't), so I wouldn't even have tried to play, except I was curious just how badly we'd steamroll. But he followed behind me a while, did some gestures I didn't get, and wandered off somewhere for the rest of the match.  
---
I would legitimately like the option to do two double-digit-rank killers against three red-rank survivors. If it wasn't for the anti-loop capabilities of dual killers, I'd still have given the advantage to the survivors if they're near Rank 1.
---
He's getting another rework?
---
I‚Äôve been here when this comment was cursed with *666* likes
---
What? He‚Äôs never had one before.
---
Added Spirit Closeup
---
This is dead by daylight?
---
so what are swf players?  I have never heard of them.
---
Head on isnt meta. its good sure, but not meta.
---
Opening the hatch more than once on the same trial with keys annoys me more than getting hit with Noed.
---
Survivors with friends.
---
yeah aim assist on console is the real killer tbh
---
fuck I see way more pics of xbox being toxic, then any other platform
---
You're a brave soul going for the 4 basement sacrifices. Took about 3 days of DCs on PS4 before giving up, even if its the last challenge.
---
Wazzzzzzzuupppppp
---
Biggest issue about trying to do totems if your not in a 4 man... you have no idea if your the only one breaking them or if someone else already got the other 4
---
I‚Äôm actually heading towards that as I‚Äôm currently getting my meg teachables
---
idk what game you're playing but ok to each's own
---
Well, I am level 238, but not all this time I was working on the trophy.... I cannot really answer this. Also, most of the difficult ones I did them by farming (a clean word for cheating)
---
That is quite unfortunate for you. I was lucky enough to get it in my first game trying as LF with Agitation and Iron Will
---
My friend told me about thid build cause I see people complaining about ruin
---
1. No Mither
---
2. This is not happening
---
3. Resillience
---
4. Dead hard/spine chill/prove thyself (fpr SWFs)
---
Item: Purple toolbox witg Brand New Parts and an add-on of your choice
---
Hope this helped some of you guys out
---
DH, SB are meta. Just bc somthing is used a decent amount doesnt mean its meta. and its not as strong as those 2.
---
I DONT CARE IF YOUR TWO TWITCH VIEWERS SEE ME, IF IM ONLY GOING TO GET ONE KILL IM GONNA TAKE THAT KILL, TUNNELING OR NO
---
The fact people complain about SWF but refuse to mention how shit solo is hurts
---
If you want to be a cunt:
---
Distressing/BBQ/M&amp;A/Ruin maybe with both Calm add-ons
---
Personally I use:
---
Overcharge/Thana/M&amp;A/NOED that I will change for Distressing
---
Add-ons: Order and Discipline
---
Billy is likely the best balanced Killer lmao what??
---
Tons of map pressure from mobility, amazing lethality and a huge skill cap, while still being fair and counterplayable.
---
How do you downvote twice

I dont play doctor so I don't know but a lot of streamers say you shouldnt go into Schock therapy right away.

I WAS MOSTLY COMMENTING ON THE BAD PALLET EFFICIENCY PART, FLAMERS ARE LOSERS
---
Dont have thana, bba and ruin yet  kinda hoping i can get them  in blood  web
---
I would normally agree but they said that before the event depicted in this post, and now they have this event. Obviously I disagree with the fact that this is labeled as an event but either way OP's logic is flawed
---
Well, playstation says so, yes
---
I think NOED is a great perk for weak killers that need some kind of edge. Like Legion and Clown. They‚Äôre weak as shit, any advantage for them is one that should be taken. And NOED can be countered by just doing totems, which is exactly why I run Detective‚Äôs Hunch, so I can do totems while I do gens.
---
The first one xD Saying you‚Äòre a waste of oxygen and more, you say ‚Äûok boomer‚Äú, he just ‚Äûwow you‚Äòre a nigga‚Äú. HMMMM
---
You mean never? Lol. In the like 40 games I've played as Plague I've gotten to use Corrupt Purge like 5 times, and 2 of those were because of her apple add-ons.
---
Dweet! Hit me on the noggin with this here slab of wood! Do it Dweet! We have bloodpoints, Dweet!
---
ghost face isnt very hard to pick up in my opinion, however being  more add-on dependent than spirit to help with stalk rate, power recovery, etc. he also has more trouble at loops because he‚Äôs essentially just an M1 killer at loops with no line of sight blockers. this makes him less viable at higher ranks than spirit but in my opinion is much more fun to play. my friend recently started dead by daylight and i recommended ghost face to him. he seems satisfied with it. 
---
hope this helped!
---
They carry it.

Happens a lot on console lol

You'll soon learn how weak he is, billy has no control on when he gets downs, relies on survivors making mistakes completely. Even watch tournaments if you dont believe, there was a 1v1 with cracked billy add ons and 3 of the best billys, against random survivors who enter, best time was 6 minutes 52 seconds, yes obviously this could have been an unlucky game, but the average times were between 1-4 minutes. Thats long af, yes if a chase takes to long you leave it, but if all survivors play like this against a billy, no chance.
---
WAAAZAAAAAAAAAA
---
I DID THE 4 STUN CHALLENGE BUT IT DIDN'T COMPLETE, FUCK THIS SHIT.
---
They're hard to see both in lobby and in game but they are visible.
---
ah okay
---
Crow T posing is more intimidating than any killer
---
Youre the kinda person that sits on Tru3talent streams just typing "tunneler" and "bad nurse"
---
object can be a real pain while playing GF, i‚Äôll tell you that. it‚Äôs the same with any killer tbh. though i‚Äôm pretty sure object doesn‚Äôt show the aura of killers with the undetectable effect applied to them (so cloaked wraith, shrouded GF, and so on.) but maybe i‚Äôm misinformed idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôd rather an option to rebind the stick wiggle to other things
---
Why not. I play sometimes doc and I tend to go into shock therapy straight away with two calm add ins to find survivors and get alerts straight away. Idk who have said that but your shock therapy alerts the killer where survivors are in your terror radius. At pallets/loops shock to prevent them from pallet throwing or vaulting windows/pallets. You know. Basic stuff really.
---
*runs to new locker*
---
Hate to say good sir but that's impossible. You may be ranked in for now but you're still going to be fighting against survive with friends regardless. Believe me it absolutely sucks but there's not much you can do
---
Good Luck, I hope I helped you, and that you will find one of the bulids good
---
Ignore this please, Clown is one of the worst killers in the game. He's good at anti-loop but has the the worst map pressure. If you get a survivor chaining pallets, there's not much you can do.
---
You're both children, go back to school and maybe you'll grow up a bit.
---
And a farming killer
---
Or any other key
---
Imma use the build  you said in edit till i get  the othrt perks,  Thanks :)
---
No problem
---
Dude any discussion about anything with this nuclear toxic waste have a community (and yes I know it is in all of us) is only going to pretty much result in Failure as you have some people that have no idea what asymmetrical means and the other half that refuses to play killer because they know how bad it is.
---
Actually talking about doc builds. I run distressing unnerving presence hex ruin and whispers. That works well at r5 currently. Hope that helps :)
---
I screamed with anxiety not knowing if you were going to make in time omg
---
You! You're the reason I can never not bring ruin.
---
It's sad that Boil Over won't receive his proper rework because of this perk
---
When i get more perks ill try that too
---
Do you have the perk Decisive Strike? It's Laurie's level 40 perk, but I'd recommend getting it of the Shrine of Secrets if possible.
---
Something that I forgot to mention in my previous comment: don't let my opinion (or anyone else's) keep you from watching Aron-whatever. If you like his gameplay, watch him. Far be it for me to tell others how to play and who to watch.
---
Some characters change their pose when holding an item too. If the pose is changed and you can‚Äôt see a toolbox, medkit or map, then they have a key.
---
IKR? I PLAY KILLER BUT I STILL CRINGE WHEN I HIT SOMEONE AND THEY DONT MAKE USE OF THE SPEED BOOST AND INSTEAD DROP THE PALLETS. I UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE NEW AND SCARED BUT SOME SHOULD KNOW BETTER. THEN I LOOP SOMEONE ELSE AND THEY SEEK THE SAME PALLET AND THEY DONT FIND IT AND I FEEL THE LAD PAIN. LIKE DAMN DUDE, STOP WASTING PALLETS!
---
Waste of time Bro i literally made a long ass post talking about this same thing... guess people are happy with noed rn lol
---
I'll be honest I don't really care much for the perk. Has a Survivor I cleanse every totem because I don't trust the Killer. I have even seen Michael Myers running using the perk. 
---
Has a killer I'll only use it if I plan to make an end game build and I'm just goofing off which is rare sadly given the fact that dealing with survivors are so stressful
---
Lmao larvae of insects are always larger than the adult because metamorphosis takes a lot of energy. And most people probably would consider metamorphosis to be a second birth
---
Link to said stream if you can
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like the killer is trying to be cocky. She could have played better by staying right next to the Nea, but it seems she dropped the Nea because no hooks nearby perhaps.
---
Most recent video on dead by daylight YouTube channel
---
I am aware, with "birth" I meant the moment they leave their egg.
---
You're getting downvotes, but I can't disagree with what you say. People usually use your same reasoning to justifiy toxic behavior on both sides.
---
Holy shit, nicely done.
---
They still have some power at least.
---
That moment when I realise that you have to get the same amount of emblem points in red ranks to get a black pip, as it needs for a pip in brown ranks
---
Yeahh! Welcome to the Fog.
---
NOED and DS: the two best perks in the game. Also the two most boring perks in the game.
---
Same I was so mean I trapped basement and used logwood dye so it took me like five seconds I hooked one trapped it and made it so if they escaped on there own they‚Äôd go down and I had deerstalker I had it all planned out
---
anime freddy
---
Don‚Äôt listen. Clown is one of the worst killer in the game and not that fun to play. He is down there with bubba
---
Delete game
---
So here is my take. I play both sides equally but I have never played swf cause I'm antisocial. I know the pains of playing with randoms. But as a killer? While 2 or 3 man swf is bearable half the time a 4 man swf is massively overpowered and will wreck the strongest, sweatiest killer. In a perfect world, a 4 man swf would have the decency to not run a full meta build or bring purple toolkits.
---
Getting out is the objective.   Dull totems represent a possible issue with getting out.  Do the dull totems. Profit
---
No. And yes more to come
---
Remove huntress
---
As far as touching goes I had spitballed the idea of a "The Blob" type killer. If they had a high ms during their power and had to stand on top of a survivor for a set time to deal damage I think it could be interesting.
---
This is one of the reasons I stopped playing the game. I saved everyone but no one saved me ever.
---
Lmao the killer thought he could confirm the kill with endgame rather than risking a hook transport. 
---
Good thing he was punished for it. 
---
If I was the killer I would risk the hook transport and not let the entity have the kill
---
Yay Jeff mains. There are dozens of us! Dozens!
---
A few perks I like on Doc is Distressing as it works great with his power. Another one is Iron maiden, not as good but it work. The only way NOT to gain madness passively while in the Doctors TR is in lockers. SO some survivors may choose to hind in them, after they leave they will scream and also become exposed.
---
As a daily Xbox player, almost every match no matter what I get hate. I got reported by a guy I let go for "throwing the match".....
---
Dude this is exactly how I feel. After I die to a try hard killer and spectate then chasing the Claudette that has been hiding all game, they turn into a potato it‚Äôs weird
---
Art design team and game design team are entirely different things.
---
I thought your username was clownjizz
---
I do not. Fairly new as well do I don‚Äôt have enough shards to buy anything from there
---
He‚Äôs definitely worse, but you kind of fed into the toxicity a bit. 
---
That other dude is way too angry at a video game though goddamn
---
Maybe they'll eventually get smarter
---
They really arent....they have an egg, larva and pupae stage just like every other holometabolous insects.
---
I think jake‚Äôs more popular since the Halloween skin
---
Yeah do it. It‚Äôs fun. When it comes to add ins. I don‚Äôt know how experienced you are but what works well are the two calm addons. 
---
Another set is the high stimulus electrode and interview tape for sniper doc. These work well but you could switch it up with restraint add ins or others. I hope the doc changes are good honestly as they butchered nurse in my opinion bearing in mind I play on PS4 so I‚Äôm on controller. I need a new killer to play and I have just been switching with Freddy for a while.
---
Well fun is subjective. But I would probably buy Pig cause I find her more fun to play than the new Freddy. But Freddy isn't a boring killer.
---
Bubba cutest
---
Jason :(
---
That‚Äôs what correcting is. It‚Äôs turning after a blink essentially. I used to think the difference wasn‚Äôt big until I started playing on PC. The only killer who had a bigger console vs PC difference is pre hotfix oni imo.
---
If in gen benig crime then I am arrest.
---
 &gt;I want a killer who is both fun and top tier to play.
---
Maybe give Nurse and Billy a try or a second chance? They have high skill floor but very rewarding and high tier. 
---
Otherwise, hag is great fun. Doctor is getting reworked so watch out for that.
---
I dont see how he's toxic. What's really toxic is being a douchebag in endgame chat or doing things solely to piss off the killer. Coordinated survivor perk builds and playstyles intended to please an audience and provide new "flavors" are not "toxic".  His "bullying" killers is just what it seems like when a killer is below average and plays against a coordinated SWF group with a gameplan.
---
This is only for mobile, and its not really an "event" just cosmetics
---
Dear lord what an amazing play. Congrats.
---
Like oh my god my dad owns Microsoft!!! Hahah okay tommy go drink some milk and get ready for bed haha
---
Did you noticed Nurse aswell?
---
This is the reason why people use NOED. Sometimes you surprise one of those fuckers.
---
Would this game be dead by daylight by any chance?
---
Get out as you still can
---
And I think people leave if a certain map is chosen it‚Äôs so dumb takes me so long to find a match at times and they just exit
---
Freddy is a better killer overall but I usually have way more fun on the pig
---
Head on is not good by any means, it‚Äôs really fun to use but it‚Äôs not meta.
---
"Now that right there is some fine work."
---
Take my upvote you thrill seeking beauty.
---
Wraith had you all dead to rights. But then the imbalance showed itself.
---
no that is shit complete shit and only for fun and a waste of 7k bp
---
I play killer enough to know what im talking about.
---
have they addressed SWF matchmaking being terrible or no? just picked up playing again after a year and i played on PC before and never had a problem with finding a lobby but on PS4 it takes our 4 man ~10 minutes to find a match seems backasswards and i‚Äôm sorry if this is already being addressed and merry christmas y‚Äôall
---
Pig needs a good snoot booping...
---
Where did I say it should cost 7k?
---
I plan on buying myers   sooner or later  because his power set similar to doc fits  my stright  forward lazy  personality
---
Wait... til daylight
---
nugget biscuit nugget in a biscuit
---
I want a Dart cosmetic :(
---
bc if ur gonna nerf moris eb moris are the only ones needed be nerfed while remaining the same cost
---
You're absolutely fucking right. You're being downvoted because we've got triggered killers who suffer from PTSD against coordinated SWF teams destroying them and then BM'ing them in endgame chat.  The playstyles builds and perks are NOT TOXIC, its how you treat the other player with gamesmanship and respect, during the game and after. No staying behind at the exit gates to twerk, no BM'ing in endgame chat.
---
Okie, not home at my computer, which is why I asked
---
So here is a question, why did you not open the hatch or go through the already open door at the very beginning?
---
Ayyyy congrats. As a PS4 nurse main how long did she take you. I bet it was annoying learning her lmao. That‚Äôs what would take the longest I think. Now go for evil incarnate for Micheal. Gl!!
---
You actually have to preemptively drop pallets sometimes to get the stuns. Latency and servers seem to be inconsistent with vaults and pallets lately.
---
Where did I say ebony should be nerfed?
---
I think you're misunderstanding me. This isn't a replacement for ebony. This is an idea for a NEW Mori.
---
Ye
---
It‚Äôs because they need to re-do the emblem/ranking system. It‚Äôs not really about skill because people in SWFs get boosted then they play solo and don‚Äôt know how to play correctly because they aren‚Äôt getting constant information from their team.
---
What a rollercoaster
---
so u want a new mori that is completely useless?
---
Yeah if someone slugs to keep the pressure on is bad cuz it makes it harder for survivors.
---
How is it completely useless? It can be used as long as you get to hooks and has the benefits I described.
---
It's more useful than a Mori already in the game, the yellow one.
---
Dwelf
---
is your ego so fragile that you dont want the extra 1500 for 4 whacks plus chase start?
---
r/uselessnobody
---
1 hook to death vs 2 hooks to death? what?
---
Oh yes me too and its so good
---
https://youtu.be/vde613ZMd88
---
My Myers is P3 today. Spirit P3 nurse P3 Freddy p2 50. They are probably A rated killers in my opinion but Myers is super bad on loops so that‚Äôll be the one thing that screws up high rank games. Spirit is an all round good killer because she has speed. Billy is probably the best of the list because he has transportation. Put on play with your food and it‚Äôll be speed boi. Also really simple to run. Freddy is another one that is fun but to learn is awkward. Also. Only use fake pallets. The dream snares are a yikes honestly. They slow survs at loops but suck in my opinion. If you got any questions just ask on this thread. I‚Äôll try answer :)
---
I don't understand you 
---
After you down a survivor who is on death hook, they can be moried.
---
It appears you are not as dignified and educated as the genius, u/VelvetNightFox. You should reconsider your position on the earth, unintelligent waste of oxygen.
---
Such a tired argument. The perk isn't even good.
---
It should replace the yellow mori IMO, as that thing is a complete waste.
---
Make it one time use, so that it's still worse than ivory for all i care.
---
It really could have just been the plus signs and then the Survs just show up like they do when switching between characters.
---
Man it‚Äôs almost like a ton of people haven‚Äôt already said that or something. I get it. I just thought it was funny
---
Steve mains rise up
---
Are they holding it in their hands?
---
Just 11 actually, so not even a dozen lol
---
I mean even with it working on all survivors, ivory is still better since for this one they need to be on death hook anyways.
---
Run Kindred and consider less expletives in your next post.  They only serve to cheapen whatever it is you want to communicate on here.  Let's raise the bar around here one post at a time.
---
As if players didn't troll enough in Ranked with rampant rage DCs, farming, ect. I can't even begin to imagine what a casual mode would be.
---
I love the people faulting the killer for toxic survivors.
---
that's something people who are bad at using Head On say ;)
---
And it shouldn't. You're the last person alive and to drag the game out possibly another minute or deny the Killer a 4k because DS is poorly designed is retarded. Your team lost. You lost the final chase. Why the fuck should you get _another_ chance???
---
Who is this?
---
Oh boy. 300 extra points, and gloating. Just swallow your ego and/or stop BMing killers. Just leave and move on. Its free escape points, yo.
---
people who don't think it's good are people who are bad at using it
---
Jesus
---
You sir, puckered my butthole so tight it disappeared.
---
Yea no DH and SB hardly have any counters, while head on you can bait it or lunge at the locker and hit the survivor while they are jumping out.
---
its not meta, its just good.
---
Yeah, the way it was worded it just sounded like a rage post.
---
he really isnt 2 toxic, not compared to other Youtubers or streamers. He is just good, and a shit head, but who isnt a shit head from time to time
---
Pig if you want better killer perks in your pool, Nightmare if you want a better killer. 
---
Fun is subjective, but I prefer pig far more. Plus she has cosmetics and new SFX on two weapons.
---
I dont like that idea. Part of the fun of this game is not knowing wtf your teammates are doing.
---
DH you have to be injured. SB you have to walk until you need it
---
Head On you can save a survivor being carried. it's better and it's meta ;)
---
Add a counter to a perk. I think the devs mentioned Small Game. This way new players don‚Äôt see it as a mandatory objective, and noed haters can counter it easier.
---
I agree
---
There are situations when noed is good and situation when it is bad. I used to often run noed if I had say a full swf with 4 toolboxes. You run it as  back up for of you lose. Itll probably either not get activated or broken in the first 30 seconds. People who camp and have noed activated at the same time are garbage people. I will defend camping when you are losing heavily but you only get one.
---
How do you find British accents annoying? its literally just english but spicy
---
I'm sickened, but curious.
---
Omg! Nice!!!
---
Why? So you can cry like a manbaby?
---
Myers
---
That's because you killers are boosted and can't get any kills unless your lobby is uncoordinated solos
---
Honestly I thought thats what it was first time seeing it.
---
&gt; SB you have to walk until you need it
---
Thats something someone who sucks at using SB would say
---
So you agree that the weight is irrelevant, that's why I gave two examples, because neither of them effect the concept of being born fully grown. No duh your kid would be overweight, no duh the larvae needs energy to transform. All you really need to say was, yes I consider it a second birth.
---
If that was Xbox and you reported it he'd get a communication ban for a week.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Keep playing until you get to a group that plays well. Lots of survivors in the Upper Gold to Green typically save and play generally-well in my experience.
---
Point out where OP got mad for no reason and messaged someone calling them trash please.
---
Expensive NOED on weak killers or Leatherface
---
Otherwise you're a boosted killer if you use NOED and ruin and meta perks
---
Cant find a mori during a trial.
---
That's why. The majority of people who complain about perks are low rank nooblets.
---
I honestly just think they need to make it so he doesn't slow down when absorbing blood. No idea why he has such a massive slowdown speed.
---
Yes the pig is best
---
you guys need a scenario ? Or should I just be the one saying   
---
"**Action"** ?
---
I. Want. This. Fucking. Mug!
---
As big of* Can't*
---
I tried yesterday and never got a pig üò£
---
iden (.Y.) 5
---
This guy is such a dad. But also a bit of a douche for tunneling and then proceeding to be more rude by ignoring everything he says.
---
Last time I checked farming Isn't against any rules. It's a  very grindy game its literally a necessary!
---
Doesn't matter who messaged who. What matters is continuing it via stooping to the sender's level. Literally no one will ever care who started it, but how it continues.
---
"But he/she started it!" has never been valid.
---
I feel ya. I've had some success with perks like bitter murmur, discordance and tinkerer with him. Just one of these should be good enough but if you have blood fury on standby and any of these perks go off it's a good way to catch a survivor or two off guard.
---
Leave the game. Not everyone wants to sweat every game.
---
He‚Äôs ruined deep wounds that‚Äôs for sure
---
He's the Krampus
---
Same for when he vaults. When he vaults I feel like it covers way too much of the screen.
---
Yeah as a killer "main"(debatable) every game at purple and above = hate message after its so bad
---
who cares. he messaged him and acted like a piss baby so he insulted back. there is no high horse in this situation
---
I'm a console player and I'm pissed that I have to unlock BT now. It used to be a default perk
---
This is why I mute deadbydaylight application when I'm spending bloodpoints for more than 50k.
---
It‚Äôs the index finger. But it looks so much like the middle without a closer look.
---
Damn thats really weird. Can‚Äôt believe that happened...
---
he's keeping an eye on freddy
---
Yep same, they always pull the tunnel/ camper card just cause they are mad lol
---
There‚Äôs mobile ??
---
Gonna start doing this actually. Thank you haha
---
**waist** of oxygen is my favorite.
---
Yes and for some reason one good thing about mobile is that for survivor the queues are instant.
---
Pig so I can boop your snoot
---
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
Its only in like eu and its in beta
---
Idk about you but ass gives me life as well
---
Yeah, he looks WAYYYY down, too. Like, all you see are his big feet and the ground.
---
Those look awesome! I really wish they made DBD pops because some of the killers would translate soooo well. They could make the oni one of those 6inch ones, have a scene one with like a Meg working on a gen with wraith coming around the corner (thinking like those star wars pop sets of famous movie scenes).
---
The good feeling when Unbreakable actually makes a play! Good stuff :)
---
I got it with the clown, the basement was in the suffocation pit, knowing i wouldnt make it to basement i still tried going as far as i could anyway slowly inching my way there and then they just suicide on the basement hook, they all started on the other end
---
I had someone do this to me today! Made me laugh so hard
---
I see Jane ass I upvote
---
Dont forget the camping!
---
90% of the Killers on ps4
---
I always stay only the weaks leaving even if I get rekt lmao
---
Ignoramus c u m  b o y
---
A man of culture.
---
I had a really dumb Claudette gloating on Hawkins lab one game I had as pig. 1 person was dead and the other 2 escaped and this person just ran around during the EGC instead of teabagging safely at the gate. I hit them once and then they ran to the gate, so a second hit would make them leave but they fucked up; they weren't close enough to escape, so I hooked them.
---
Doesn't make it any less trash, just like keys. You one of those killers that still bitch about DS being OP too?
---
Both shit, all you scrubs are locked at 4 FPS lmao
---
Deep wounds ruined deep wounds. The whole concept is shit.
---
Im Going to do this instead of being angry because they tunneled,  camped,  etc.
---
[Link to download it](https://ibb.co/xX92h8b)
---
How do cosmetics have to do anything with perks? Prestige exists too so you're just being stupid
---
You got a waist made of oxygen?? Damn send pics I‚Äôm tryna see something üò≥
---
It‚Äôs me
---
Who said anything about sweating pissy boy I said I wanted to play the game the way that the people who made it said it was meant to be played, not be stuck with a r17 trapper that keeps smacking pallets.
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
Honestly I understand, apart from the characters i‚Äôve been gifted (which is about 3 survivors and a couple hunters) I have gotten all of them myself. Plus a bunch of skins. If I lost all my data now id probably quit the game too.
---
Between Dead Hard being so buggy and Huntress chucking fucking shotgun shells at everyone, dedicated servers have been such a nightmare to play, I swear.
---
wtf
---
David's face at the end says it all.
---
"My dad works for BVHR".
---
I've never seen or witnessed a glitch like this before..
---
How did that happen?
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be.
---
Its only Amanda
---
I have no idea, I have clips of the game starting with only 3 people in the lobby and everything. I'm so confused lmao.
---
Same here. I was on swamp and purposely carried the last survivor to a far corner because I couldn‚Äôt get to a hook. It gave me enough time to catch them again before they got out of the door. The survivors were all pissy but it was all I could do to keep them from getting out, so whatever. lol.
---
Actually mobile can run 60fps
---
Change your mindset. Instead of ‚Äúdammit another pallet stun‚Äù think ‚Äúyes thank you feed me more pallets.‚Äù Pick a survivor who‚Äôs trigger-happy with pallets and let them ‚Äúloop‚Äù you for the first 2-3 minutes, breaking pallets all the while, then proceed to snowball everything straight to hell after that. 
---
If you know which pallets are unsafe, leave those intact and mindgame them. 
---
If all else fails, try watching Otzdarva if you‚Äôre in to watching gameplay vods/streams. He‚Äôs where I learned my killer PMA. It can still get tilting playing killer after a while, but changing your mindset definitely helps stave off the tilt for longer.
---
How recent was this clip?  It used to be an actual thing.   Also sprint burst and dh noice.
---
**URBAN TIME**
---
Yeah, I have a horrible defeated minset in a lot of things
---
People like you embarrass the PC platform. "Console peasants" are console fanboys, not just anyone playing on a console. You fucking donkey.
---
Best childhood meme format 10/10 good sir
---
WAH!
---
You have a good point
---
Which I why the Soulja Boy Console version is far better.
---
I've always just walked onto it as Freddy lol
---
No you guys I‚Äôm pretty sure have all the dlc
---
freddy is fine, but u will sure have more fun with pig
---
My noob overwatch playin ass was about to ask how you got a gold gun for wraith
---
Luckily once you grab them it counts as a kill even if they d/c
---
Freddy's the better killer, but Pig has the better perks. But since you can get any perks on any killer, I'd suggest Freddy.
---
Omg GG!
---
DCing against it just makes them do it again...
---
5 party streamers and more Double Blood Point events
---
Don't get penisy kid!
---
Got a lil impatient on that first dead hard but nice job recovering in the end. No idea why dumb dumb dropped you it literally cost her the kill
---
Depends, if the killer helped the survivor with challenges I think it‚Äôs right for the killer to get the kill, same thing with survivors helping killers, they should be allowed to escape.
---
If the killer decides to farm mid match because he‚Äôs killing survivors too quickly and they‚Äôre not getting any BP, but after a bit kills them, no problem with that.
---
There is unspoken rules to farming.
---
console is like 30 fps
---
Gold is valuable in overwatch and puss is valuable to vigo so i see you‚Äôre error
---
Nope. But once again a comment about 1 thing turns into another because everyone has to validate their "side".
---
Okay, I‚Äôll just leave a hooked survivor. He has all 3 of his buddies touching my ass because that‚Äôs how close they are.
---
Yeah, gens are so important. Very important to just like... disregard survivors health states right? Those aren‚Äôt important
---
Huh
---
Wow! By the skin of your teeth!
---
Any particular reason for Claudette and billy being together? I‚Äôve seen it many times but don‚Äôt understand why
---
Damn, not only was that a lazy attempt at a burn, but you got the quote wrong. R.i.p

I'm not validating a single side. You are. I said they're both trash. The only person being biased here is you.
---
Oh I see
---
Commodious tool box, with BNP and the swivel. Run better together and pray your teammates are super altruistic. I got blessed and did it on my first try
---
Yea
---
Esp hacking the fuck is that
---
I wish this would happen in any of my games as killer lmao
---
Had the biggest wtf moment when I saw wraith and then heard Michael's music.
---
I love it ! Pure skill !
---
pressure? the chase ended up happening anyway lol but i guess laying on the ground and having a staring contest is completely not a waste of time huh?
---
I had this once happen to me as a killer and I can say that she probably was fucking pissed for the rest of the day
---
This Spirit left these guys on the ground the entire 4 minutes. And to add insult to injury he animation cancelled the mori all those times to BM because he‚Äôs salty he was getting looped so badly. 
---
For starters, once you engage in the Mori animation, it should lock you in. 
---
And regardless of anti slugging perks being a thing, you shouldn‚Äôt have to stay on the ground an ENTIRE 4 minutes of doing absolutely nothing. Of course slugging for DS is acceptable, this is different. Don‚Äôt know how it can be changed but that‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Not whole of eu I'm in England and no sign of dbd mobile
---
I miss the old days when the type of hook was determined by the killer instead of the map
---
I said something about keys. You took it off topic and started talking about moris. Am brain not work.
---
Idk what the fruit loops guy wasn‚Äôt getting. LOL this is the nerf that should come to ebonies tbh
---
Shhhhhhhhh, Just do it
---
Before the end game mechanic, I was so petty once that I waited a 2 minutes for the survivors to stop t-bagging and leave or else I was gunna pull the plug but they just kept on messing around... I was already heated from the game before that and probably should‚Äôve been taking a break
---
My skills are obviously objective base because I use them to contribute to the main objective, which is to sacrifice all the survivors, or to contribute to the survivors escaping the match.
---
And I don't understand how you're getting your arbitrary definition of how the game should be played. Is it the ranking system? Is it just your made up ideal version of dead by daylight? Idk about you, but going to https://deadbydaylight.com/en/game, it clearly says "As a Killer, your goal is to sacrifice as many Survivors as possible. As a Survivor, your goal is to escape and avoid being caught and killed". The game is advertise and literally tells the players that killing and escaping is the objective. Trying to deny this, and state that playing to this objective is wrong would be going against what behavior is literally telling us.
---
And if you want to define the way to play by the ranking system, then I would like some clarification. If I'm a bad player or if I'm playing the game incorrectly for playing with the mindset that I only want to 4k or only want to escape, then why am I red ranks as both survivor and killer? Is the rank system just flawed and is mistakenly rewarding my "improper" way of playing the game, or is the game's ranking system rewarding me for completing the primary objective, and is allowing me to ignore secondary objectives of the game because contributing to the primary objective is more important in the ranking system?
---
If the ranking system is garbage, then I can't take you seriously trying to attack people's way to play the game when the system itself is flawed to begin. And because it's flawed, it shouldn't be looked to as a way to judge or define how a person should play the game because it is unable to provide a clear cut answer.
---
If it's the latter, then the ranking system is actively rewarding me for playing the way I am playing, and that means that the way I'm playing is not only legitimate, but that my play style can only be deemed as correct and appropriate for the game.
---
Old 360 was actual trash talk with the ocassional shit head. I remember good ol Halo days of back and forth trash talk that had some meaning rather than this sorry shit of trash talk in the OP. Call of Duty was a different breed I'd have hardly called it trash talking ever since MW2. WaW and CoD4 had good trash talk.
---
"Be good at trash talking or get reported" is my mantra. Literal no substance in the OP but malice.
---
As an ace main, I approve this. I would buy the entire stock
---
Ok we can all agree that you did good. But why both DH and BL. Just curious
---
For mobile players... Did you know you can self-care or use a medkit IN a locker?
---
I always just flirt with them, they get really defensive anytime another dude flirts with them
---
And of course you playing swf
---
If I play with my friend we have to dedicate at least an extra 45 mins if we go as a 3 or 4 man just because somehow one person will get left behind randomly. 
---
Even when we two man the queue times are just a slog. 
---
At this point I don‚Äôt lobby dodge anymore as killer cause I‚Äôm betting the groups I get have been waiting an age.
---
Yeah, I'm just gonna write you off as a killer main troll at this point, lol.
---
That was fucking nerve wracking
---
I SHARE YOUR RAGE RE: DEAD HARD. I STARTED SWITCHING IT OUT FOR SPRINT BURST A FEW WEEKS AGO AND HAVENT LOOKED BACK. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU GIVE THAT A TRY.
---
Merry Slugmas, I guess
---
I knew you could self-care but not medkit
---
I use bond to find out which gens are being worked and then prove thyself to get them done quickly.
---
I've gotten to the near end of my 4th gen twice now, but the first time the killer found me and I was on death hook. The second time a few hours ago I was working on the last gen with another survivor (we were around 85% done), but some Claudette with a key found hatch while being chased which ended with the killer slamming it shut and starting egc.
---
Im actually a survivor main.
---
They didn‚Äôt come out for everyone only people who earned them and lost them due to bugs. If you weren‚Äôt around to play it or didn‚Äôt get it, you won‚Äôt be getting it.
---
I don't intentionally tunnel, and I have played enough survivor to empathize with being unable to play the game because the killer camps/tunnels. My point is that the killer isn't necessarily bad or playing incorrectly for doing so, it's more just rude and not nice for the killer to do so.
---
Thanks
---
The idea is to only catch one survivor with the static field at time - you go into t1 madness way faster than the others, so using your therapy is a guaranteed way to find each survivor once a match - if you hit two people with it at once you can only chase one and the other will be able to stealth easier
---
You mean the mechanic that Legion introduced?
---
Is your ego so fragile that you can't just leave?
---
Plus a sad source of BP. So many better ways to catch 1500 than hitting gloating survivors at the exit gates.
---
As an ace main who plays with a nea main. I approve this post. Also it deserves way more upvotes
---
Eh. There was no hook nearby (I checked the clip many times) and probably tough that the struggling bar was almost full so he left him on the ground to make sure to get the survivor killed. That wasn‚Äôt anything toxic it was the best thing to do in that case. And the reply was about slugging being toxic when it‚Äôs in some situations the best option.
---
Well there are already two different pops of Ash, one for the movies and one for the TV series. My best friend got me one for Christmas! They're expensive for Pops though, around $30 when most are $8-$10.
---
What's esp again?
---
I mean, his team threw the game, all 3 of his teammates went down at the hook, trying to protect him (or whatever their plan was).
---
While yeah, the spirit was mad, what should he have done? Abandon the chase while the other 3 survivors are on the ground? To go hook them so he can come back and pick two up while he is hooking one guy?
---
Duude, give me my boi Joseph. Holy crap
---
Identit
---
I want to speak to the entity.
---
Well as I said EU. At least you got "Dead by Brexit"... I'm sorry
---
Happy cake day :D
---
Yes. I say he but really the devs have just kept bugging BT and making his power worse
---
i didn't mean it like that. I mean that buying it from the shrine didn't work. I spent the amount of shards needed, but i just lost them and the perk didn't show up in my bloodweb. When i looked in the shrine it said i bought it, and i couldn't buy it twice, but i somehow don't have it. I have screens too, but it's really not a big deal so i probably won't bother anyone to look more into it.
---
Wallhacks
---
Wall hacks
---
I never understood the concept of X main. Like, does these people play one side only and not the other? You're missing half the fun of the game.
---
Why she's moaning like she's in a step sister video?
---
Oh do tell what addons and perks
---
tiny crow tiny crow tiny crow
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
Oof, anyways I literally just created a fake German account and an currently downloading dbd from the German appstore so yay I guess?
---
What's cs?
---
First game of Freddy, only one perk and it was blood warden.
---
I got 4 party streamers and 1 bound letter earlier. Someone didn't load fast enough and the game called it quits
---
How far you've done it? I'm 70/70 and buyed it right after I unlocked the Nurse Skin
---
CONSOLE ONI IS TRASH. HIS FLICK CAP FEELS LIKE HALF OF WHAT IT IS ON PC. ALL THE SURVIVORS HAVE TO DO IS HUG A SMALL LOOP AND I AM MORE USELESS THAN IN NORMAL MODE!
---
THE JOKE ABOUT HIM BEING A WORSE BILLY IS FUCKING TRUE ON CONSOLE! I WASTED SO MUCH HYPE...
---
You started the nastyness.
---
I just think they use 'X main' as an argument whenever someone has an opinion about something that the caller disagrees with.
---
You can dodge the lobby if you see 3-4 Survivors loading in simultaneously or just check the user names. If there are like 3 people called Clown‚Äòs bitch, Clown‚Äòs side-bitch and Clown‚Äòs waifu you can recognize that they‚Äòre a SWF.
---
The only reason why I love hooking him
---
Umm, then you get exhausted and can't use the other one. So pretty useless to run both.
---
1) Stay on the gen, then get off as soon as the pick up animation is done. Go get your mate while the killer is distracted with the gen.
---
2) n o
---
I hooked him ran cross map (with billy) downed and hooked someone else then saw him on bbq after he was unhooked and fully healed lol
---
Chill. It looks like got it out of a chest. No add ons.
---
Who‚Äôs disgusting
---
How do u get beat by a 4 man squad that ONLY has no mither lol
---
My anxiety was having anxiety
---
I wish we could remove that word from our lexicon.
---
Ya but like, I'd you were gonna use a mori why use this one instead of another one? Like this one you need two hooks and the others one (0 hooks for a yellow mori)
---
man said piss baby
---
Your thoughts are nasty.
---
I wasn‚Äôt even making these decisions on logic but rather scared instincts lol. Just went with the flow and glad this was the outcome.
---
and so it is
---
we drinking water tonight bois üí¶üí¶üí¶
---
True, but it's like that final spit in your face. I'll never understand why people gotta be such dicks. Again, as a survivor main I avoid all that toxic behavior. I just wanna have a fun match man! Whether I win or lose there's no reason for it.
---
br uh
---
Pretty sure the Freddy lullaby gave me tinnitus. I just randomly hear it sometimes
---
Well done considering the circumstances lmao
---
??
---
Why use a brown toolbox when there are yellow toolboxes?
---
This is a rhetorical question. The answer answers your question.
---
Anything you could‚Äôve suggested or recommended doing instead of the approach I took as a survivor?
---
NOED isn‚Äòt even remotely the best perk in the game. It‚Äòs just either a crutch for very bad players or a fail safe for getting the last 1-2 people alive in the trial. You see NOED almost exclusively on low-tier Killers like Bubba, Doc or Legion for a reason.
---
Lol ok boomer we still did the same in old Xbox days cause people get more triggered over a com ban than anything.
---
What the fuck is CS
---
Dude! My heart was racing with that perfectly timed dead hard cus I knew the hatchet was coming. Good job!
---
Omfg I thought I was the only one, like sometimes it'll just lock on to nothing? Like what? Pisses me off every time, especially If they T-bag after
---
Nioccccceeee
---
Exactly easy ban an easy week long rage üòÇ
---
Ideally I wouldve just hid or prepped myself on the opposite end of the loop, after seeing her descend from the building, and then loop the pallet till she breaks it.
---
Ok BoOmEr
---
A trendy dork that follows whatever everyone tells you to do and say. Good job.
---
Kinda ironic the comments turned into a discussion about perks
---
The vtol ship should be at the top
---
By just playing the game? Again, do you want them to sit in a corner and lose a pip? Stop your whining and give up this faulty argument.
---
Bill isn‚Äòt a DLC survivor
---
Lol I see you didn‚Äôt last in the old Xbox days cause you easily triggered üòÇ
---
They use 'X main' as a way to describe that they primarily play one side more than the other. They can play the other side however play one side mostly.
---
Yeah. Me making fun of you is me being triggered. Fucking nerd.
---
Pretty sure it's Counter Strike
---
It kinda IS reportable since you refuse to participate in normal gameplay and ruining other people experience. That said I doubt anyone can get ban for it and if all players wants to farm it‚Äôs not ruining anyones fun so no harm done.
---
Lol look at that Last sentence üòÇ be careful might report you for a one week com ban
---
I mean how many more things can you do in this game? At this point every challenge is gonna be a rehash of an already existing challenge. I feel like they haven‚Äôt thought this through and every challenge will be super repetitive.
---
I‚Äôve been banned from half the sub Reddits on Reddit I don‚Äôt give a shit. lol. I‚Äôll just make another account.
---
W-A-S 
---
S-A-W
---
I did the same, just takes time to figure it out but sequence the keys like that to look behind
---
FUCK BHVR FOR BREAKING WGLF
---
Wait mobile doesn‚Äôt have the bloodweb? Lol wtf
---
I mean, with what you're currently wearing, the cosplay is done
---
I switched to PC just a couple days ago after playing on console for over 2000 hours as a rank 1 survivor. Keep practicing, it'll come. I find that I'm gradually improving every minute I play.
---
If it doesn't work out for you though, you always have the option to connect your controller to DBD on PC. Good luck.
---
Game is balanced around solo survivors. Felt like you needed to know that.
---
I have no issue buying the DLC's, I already bought Michael, Ghost Face and Legion through their respective DLC's, it's more the fact that it adds up quickly (¬£56.99 I believe for purchase of all DLC's available, though part of that is like soundtrack), which is quite a big investment if I want eg, 6 perks that are in 6 different DLC's. 
---
That's ¬£24 (with the winter steam sale) for 6 perks (Yes, I get a survivor and a killer too, but if I'm ultimately buying it for the perks, that's an absolute insane amount to spend)
---
It has the‚Äùblood market‚Äù which sucks. But you don‚Äôt need blood points to level your characters
---
This just proved my point though in the irony of you saying to someone you wouldn‚Äôt last old Xbox days. BOY you couldn‚Äôt even last a reddit comment chain without blowing up like a child üòÇ So please don‚Äôt go acting tough like you made it though the ‚Äúold‚Äù Xbox days
---
Must be your mouse. I've never heard of anyone else having an issue like this.
---
Get the fuck outta here. You know damn well I‚Äôm talking about the Mori spamming and leave all 4 of them slugged the entire 4 minutes when he‚Äôs already won the game and could‚Äôve just hooked them. I showed like 5 seconds of the chase so obviously that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about.
---
That was fucking amazing! It even got MY heart beating faster. That was a great play.
---
Holy shit
---
I didn‚Äôt blow up. You‚Äôre such a fucking virgin.
---
Another shining example of how the game's core issues are really the result of poor map design. Scott jund was right.
---
It's the same kind of fucker that insta DCs when he sees a Spirit
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP CAMPING AND TUNNELING !!!! AGHHH
---
You really want to change a feature of the game that doesn't happen every single match or really frequently at all? Just bring Franklin's if you're that scared of survivors finding keys.
---
These devs should add new things to the game without the need for a perk. E.g. Lifting the pallets back, it just should've been a feature, not a perk.
---
Adding more killers and survivors won't make the already stale game any better. Add more features and ways of playing the game, increase the skill gap between average Joe's and gods. Allow killers to spend X amount of time to tinker with a single window which would disable it for X amount of time. Allow killers to tinker with totems to make them e.g. take longer to cleanse or harder to spot. Allow survivors to lift pallets back and maybe spend an X amount of time opening up a boarded window.
---
And it should neuter stealth killers. Perks and powers are like Rock Paper Scissors: if you bring OoO you picked scissors against a stealth paper. Now surprise grabs are common and stealth mains shouldn‚Äôt ever lose.
---
all u need is to not post an opinion for people to talk about that they will ultimatly dislike
---
How much would this mori even cost? Bcuz depending it's pretty useless and toxic, this is the nerf ebony moris need, the game doesn't need more moris, and it would just fill bloodwebs with more moris, so like have fun playing against a mori pretty much every game (Also browns are worst but cost less, this is a worst version of other moris that is going to cost about the same or more, making it pretty pointless)
---
Well, men have two holes at least. Otherwise you'll need a lot of goddamn fiber.
---
damn üò®
---
think of WASD like a compass for DBD W will always go north meaning in this game north is where you are looking meaning S will always go to the south meaning behind u.
---
I think that is some good advice to get to learn how to use M&amp;K
---
I don't know if you got out from a cave, but Microsoft has created a platform that is similar to a steam that is only for people who bought the game pass for PC, and there you can buy and download games that are included in the game pass, and dead by daylight is one of them, UNDERSTAND NOW?
---
Not much to work with? Boy you have spine chill. That is all you will ever need.
---
Did it first try on PS4 with leatherface.. but I was very lucky and saw it was full SWF
---
At the end I sent everyone of them a "sorry"
---
just normal way of fixing PC problems plug it in and out
---
Microsoft is still PC u dingus it isn't Xbox
---
Not their fault you're bad at the game.
---
I will wait for the next pass
---
Ok, this needs to be said. If you get so angry about losing a video game that you feel the need to message someone, you should probably not be playing video games.
---
Sick of seeing shit like this. Everyone is just trying to play the game, no need to get so butthurt about it and spew so much hate. Like if they're really that mad and they think u cheated just report and move on. People really get mad when you play the game and don't follow certain rules that aren't even legitimate rules of the game. People like that need to just grow up.
---
As in I know it‚Äôs a generic-stacked build, and was expecting people to give me shit for it lol.
---
