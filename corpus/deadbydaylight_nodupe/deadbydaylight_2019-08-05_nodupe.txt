So the last survivor is getting chased and you... don't open the gate for them?
---
---
---
People are upset because some feel that if the gens are done then they‚Äôve won and the game is over.
---

---
Surprise, game isn‚Äôt over until you eacape
---
&gt;Iron Will
---
Stridor
---
&gt;Spine Chill
---
Walks backwards
---
Your move, Claudette
---
It's always the Pig..
---
&gt; You play you. Games are for fun, so have fun. If they can't get each other up it is on them and their skill set.
---
Yes essentially, i keep 4King every single game, but i usually let the last person escape, so i only get safety pip (quick game and 1 escape doesn't give a pip). So the result is i stay at rank 9 but i'm skilled like a rank 4, so guys get destroyed lol
---
Back when i was in red ranks, many players were able to loop me then i cant slug them. Only reason i can slug all 4 of them is none of them can run me around for very long,
---
Prestiging him will help him blend in a bit and definitely get iron will
---
Someone tell Brock we found Hank, god.
---
Okay thanks for the advice, are his footsteps as quite as everyone else?
---
Nice! I usually miss my ds in those situations. My adrenaline is pumping at that point üòÑ
---
Jane yes bill no. Jeff is louder
---
These are the teammates I get
---
You‚Äôre right in that it does; break dem bones though, if you‚Äôre worried about NOED. Or, failing that, play as best you can and escape anyway.
---
Them hitting tier 2 struggle phase is worse
---
Dark Sense procs when a generator is completed.
---
Kindred only shows the aura when the user is hooked and the killer is in their radius.
---
I expect every killer to have noed until someone gets hit at the end.
---
Hahahaha, not really no. Most of my hours are in Survivor, and I only recently again began to play Killer
---
Adam is louder too , well sometimed
---
Hallowed Grounds sounds good. Nothing too big in terms of movement speed, but still something.
---
Would Sanctification cause Exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds like the other exhaustion perks? It also sounds pretty good.
---
Dying Rites seems a bit underwhelming since Kindred already does that and more. However, the revealing of a downed survivor added could make a small difference.
---
Yeah ill try if they come into the shrine as ive got quite a few shards. And my only 2 survivors that ive leveled up are ash and adam francis.
---
Spine Chill is pretty good for stealth.
---
See how they don't like being told they could be great. They stay mediocre and downvote me lmao.
---
For the record, spine chill has become a meta perk,  Myers, ghost face, spirit, nurse, and to some extent freddy, are all taken down a notch by this single perk no matter what addons they are using (except infinite t1 Myers, but that's a whole other thing) so choosing not to use something that can very clearly shut some killers down, including 2 top tier killers is your choice but that doesnt mean it's not accurate, just that you are personally choosing not to use it.
---
When I said tap the gens,  I simply meant get them started and walk away, I didnt mean gen tapping, sorry if that is confusing.
---
I feel I should also point out, since you brought up that apperently you only come across spirit/beads in 5% of your games (that 5 out of every 100 for those of you keeping track at home) this shouldnt be an issue anyways. Survivors do not get to make builds that are going to shut down every killer build every game. Choices must be made, and sometimes those choices open you up to getting beaten by some builds. If you are coming across this build 5% of the time, and assuming you die every one of those games, that means you still only lost 5 games out of 100 to a specific build. Seems pretty far from overpowered to me.
---
prove it
---
Dude I literally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played him‚Äù as in I‚Äôve played as him. Read a little.
---
[removed]
---
Oh and david
---
Ah, okay. I can't even buy Legion. Check.
---
Ok , good luck finding them cause we have time without seeing stake out or iron will in the shrine
---
Excuse me
---
L A S T.      P A T C H ?
---
I havent heard of that perk what does it do?
---
Go fuck yourself. I‚Äôm a rank 1 killer and survivor. I‚Äôm not a noob. I know what‚Äôs fair in this game and what isn‚Äôt. Dick.
---
Because the main building and the killershack are one of the best areas for looping. The basement is the price you pay if you screw up containing the killer in these areas.

Forcing the killer to go around one pallet (at most) per chase isn't OP. Perks like Lithe, Balanced Landing, or even a well timed Dead Hard can let a survivor cover the same amount of ground, and none of those are OP.
---
If a 2.5% increase to movement speed is so game breaking that absolutely everyone would run it, then why isn't Hope, which gives a 7% movement speed bonus, the most popular perk in the game? I play killer mostly, but I doubt that'll mean anything to you, since you have already decided that since I dare to suggest decent perks for one side that I must only play that one side.
---
Yea. Gotta treat it like the nurse's ability now. Before it just wouldn't work. Now either it won't work at all or you trip over your own foot, best way I can describe it anyway lmao. I still keep it in my build tho. Treat it like Nurse's ability and look up while using it. It will work again.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! How long did it take you to model and make?
---
Well i was mostly talking about Bills scream when hit as it's long and pretty noisy at least for me and for Jeff yea he is by default louder then Bill.
---
Yep.
---
When you‚Äôre on the hook, two other survivors downed and that one clueless teammate still on the gen.
---
Modeled with blender. Printed on an Ender 3. Painted with plain acrylic. I wanted to design something completeley from scratch, so i started simple.
---
I‚Äôm getting downvoted because salty killer mains can‚Äôt handle it.
---
You‚Äôre probably fine just watching the Starz series, they pretty much recap the movies in a way that makes the show still move along well.
---
Stake out function is 
---
"Each 15 Seconds You are standing within the killer terror radious and not in a chase you gain a token up to maximum of 2 tokens, each token makes good skill checks turn into great ones
---
No one out hassles the hoff
---
Provide absolute evidence for an absolute claim. Waiting.
---
This perk is very good when u are hiding in a corner
---
? I just did. It's impossible to earn adrenaline without surviving to the stage where it kicks in. That surviving is in itself accomplishing a major part of the survivor game. Do you not get this?
---
Stridor is useless on spirit and I don‚Äôt see any spirits walking backwards.
---
I would say the gameplay and strats are the same the only difference in gameplay is nurse is significantly better on PC
---
like ice heard it from so many people on this website ask someone else
---
All in i would say 2-3 hours modeling over the course of a week in my spare time. Printed the small one and made a few adjustments for the full size. Its 3.5 inches on each side. Took a week for me to get around to painting it.

---
Hahah me too, i was afraid i was gonna mess that one up too
---
Lol there's a ton of counters
---
Sound whore and hear her footsteps, and spinechill for a couple
---
But can you jump through it?
---
Either Feng or Dwight.
---
Feng‚Äôs great for a first maxed out survivor, because her perks make for a good build that can keep you away from the killer‚Äôs blade. They don‚Äôt require much skill to use, so they‚Äôre great for starters.
---
Dwight‚Äôs perks are also rather simple, and can help quite a bit if you‚Äôre put with more experienced players.
---
The worst survivors to start with have to be Jake and Nea.
---
Jake‚Äôs perks are actually totally useless at earlier ranks. Baby killers usually aren‚Äôt very good with doc or spirit, and saboteur isn‚Äôt useful at all anymore.
---
As for Nea, her perks are just really difficult to use at the beginning.
---
I remember the first time I failed a skill check. I freaked out, hardcore. I was terrified. At the first stages in the game, especially those ones, adrenaline will do nothing. You likely aren‚Äôt going to get the gates open, or anything close.
---
The only exception there is if it‚Äôs a friendly killer, but there you don‚Äôt need Adrenaline.
---
Personally, I‚Äôm not a fan of Nea‚Äôs other perks, and I don‚Äôt really know how difficult they‚Äôd be to use in early ranks.
---
What‚Äôs unfortunate for me is that I actually started with Jake.
---
Why?
---
Appearance. I didn‚Äôt do much research when I was choosing which survivor I‚Äôd main, and I liked the way Jake looked more than the others, so I looked into his perks, and I didn‚Äôt know how little they would play into the game. They look super useful at first glance.
---
I now have my appearance locked in, and I‚Äôm trying to get the teachables that I wasn‚Äôt from other survivors.
---
I‚Äôm level 13, and I still don‚Äôt have my perks figured out....
---
Because I started with Jake....
---
Don‚Äôt make the mistakes I made.
---
i like the design of the head it just doesn‚Äôt match with anything
---
they made his skin grey in that outfit?  his actual skin color is a reddish/irritated dark skin
---
Look, I'm a survivor only main, who runs adrenaline on all non meme builds. But I don't complain about perks, just "play styles"
---
I guess so but that‚Äôs still a very specific situation, the killer gets two hooks, and on the third pickup they have ds? Like that‚Äôs definitely not worth wasting a slot for.
---
It's not.
---
Head On; Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Try to get make your choice on her ;)
---
Uh, did this guy survive this?
---
I'm pretty sure I already went into all these details. Just read some of the other replies on my comment.
---
Oh. I haven't got to red ranks as survivor in this season. But I'm doing well with him as killer in red ranks, I supposed he would be popular.
---
Can you see him, it is David and he is now with the Entity.
---
It's boring as hell. I'm not sticking around to lay on the ground for 4 minutes.
---
Good idea but I feel that would be kinda of a let down as people would want the real thing not some off brand but hey I would be fine with it
---
*calls your mother*
---
Behind the bushes on the left, in front of the wall
---
Of course both are boyz
---
Well, an ebony mori IS pretty toxic. It‚Äôs no fun to get hunted down by the killer after you‚Äôre unhooked(and you will almost never get rid of a killer who is really determined to down you if they‚Äôre competent). Plus, there‚Äôs almost no chance to escape the mori-no ds, no wiggling free, no sabotage, no bodyblocks. Just because something makes the survivors feel more fearful doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good-spirit with prayer beads does that and many people consider that add on op. Iridescent head makes survivors feel more fear and most people consider it op.  It also requires pretty little skill on the killer‚Äôs part: hooking survivors is pretty easy.
---
Battle royale /s
---
Found in 2 seconds, just like the simulations.
---
Obviously Gamer Girl bath water that makes survivors puke randomly and Yeet my Cat which grants immunity to stuns. That's all I got
---
Xbox has the same party system. Just one big group chat and even invite all options. It's our one-up from PC. But then discord enters the chat.
---
Alright, I guess it‚Äôs nice it‚Äôs nothing to get worked up for it‚Äôs just some hypothetical perks, but I see where you‚Äôre coming from and what you‚Äôd be concerned about
---
I always expect the first game to be trash. Never put on good items or offerings for the first game lol
---
Heck u DS is the best
---
&gt;:(
---
I had this happen except I was directly in front of the locker the killer swung at it and then I hit him with head on
---
Mettle of Man is 100% not worth it anymore. Bhvr killed it.
---
I know I just like to debate. Especially when I'm right lol.
---
thats not how that works
---
Yea
---
&gt;Stridor is useless on spirit
---
Iron will is useless against spirit too since they can just hear your footsteps and breathing, but that doesn't stop rank 20s from recommending it to begin with.
---
&gt;I don't see any spirits walking backwards
---
That's probably because they're not visible? I can assure you there are red rank spirits on PC that moonwalk / crabwalk to generators, so you're not really engaging with my argument.
---
And im a survivor main and Noed is pretty much the only perk in the game that I think its ridiculously OP. It should be reworked to be like devour hope so it actually makes the killer put in effort instead of rewarding bad ones.
---
*happy Pig noises*
---
That‚Äôs why I play both is to experience both and killer gets more blood points, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use franklins and NOED because it‚Äôs just salt‚Äôs a win. If they win against me with a good perk set and a completely fair game I see no point in running those perks. If I use all of my moon walking faking and ambush to my best and they win. They deserve it. :)
---
My boys, 10 and 12, want to sign up on Discord so they can start a little group for their cousins and friends who also play Fortnite. Any recommendations or anything I should be aware of with Discord? I'm about to do my research. Could I be the mod for that group?
---
How dare you find it in the first 2 second's. TASTE MY NOED GAMER.
---
Anything is OP against bad killers. And shack is meant to be strong, it's a solid building on which you can always rely on, and it's called the "god pallet" for a reason.
---
Still too small. Her hand would have to be as slim as her arms, which isn‚Äôt normal, the thumb side is supposed to push out but it isn‚Äôt, that and her hands would be too short
---
Constructive criticism my dude. No worries, just adjust  the sleeves so they are a lil shorter or at least a little less... cone protruding. (The sleeves look like a pyramid that had the sharp end removed, not normal for sleeves no offense mate. Simply shorten them or make them more square like, then add in the hands poking out just enough so that you can see where the knuckles would be, and that would work well with the clenched fist)
---
Can confirm
---
Is.... Is she single (sweet cosplays) 10/10 would get stabbed again

First person games with aiming tend to be much easier on PC due to the precision of mouse.

I‚Äôm not sure what it would do to survivors outside of potentially better FPS/resolution/etc on a graphics level.

TBH I wish NOED wouldn't pop if there was only one totem. Or that the NOED totem was more noticeable. IDK.

Yes, you could. Be the server admin, so that way they cant ban thier friends if they get mad. Keep a filter or watch thier chats every now and then. Besides that, it's just what you want to add/customize to it. Ranks, emotes, rooms, etc. Just watch over it. TL:DR Yes absolutely be moderater and admin.
---
It isn't a bug, its a surprise feature!
---
Pyramid head is a great choice. Mori could be degloving people
---
You're a fucking idiot
---
If you want a quiet survivor, just go with Ace. He has Iron Will pretty much by default.
---
Thanks so much, man. That was really helpful. I was expecting the worst after I mentioned "Fortnite" lol
---
Nice flair haha
---
They can‚Äôt use any actors likeness. Laurie, Quentin, and Tapp don‚Äôt look like their actors

wow for real? I play on PC and I always get bp when someone DCs and I don't. That's pretty dumb to penalize everybody
---
That happened in one of my Doc games today. I was chasing Claudette (as she was one of the remaining two) when Jake went to open the gate. I downed Claudette, Jake just opened it and straight up left her... I let her struggle off and looked after her while opening the other gate and escape. Felt bad for her. She was like an abandoned puppy.
---
Shame on you, I know every totem spot in every map!
---
bully the swf
---
Entitys grasp and surveilance sound like a good combo
---
if used correctly, perks like Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, and Lithe literally allow you to run around a loop an extra several times or get to an even safer one. Not to even mention Balanced Landing allowing for literal infinites even while in exhaustion. Sanctification will be no better than any of those, and if the pallet in a loop is already gone it becomes useless, not to mention something like Spirit Fury existing as a counter to a perk like this.
---
If wanting myself and others to have fun makes me stupid, then I'd love to be an idiot.
---
This isn‚Äôt a FPS the gameplay and mechanics are super easy. There‚Äôs nothing you can learn from watching a PS4 player that you can‚Äôt learn from
---
watching a PC player. It‚Äôs all mind games and proper camera control
---
It was close tho XD
---
I'm not trying to be smart though plus I don't plan on using sprint burst or adrenaline in any of my builds
---
sTraWMaN
---
It can be other way around though
---
Don't listen to the reddit killer mains.  They've literally complained about everything survivors have and now that no one wants to play survivor and they have 20 minute lobby times they have nothing better to do.  The basement was made to counter saboing hooks.  Now that hooks regenerate, they should remove it.  It's way to easy to camp, tunnel, or body block and it just encourages shitty play.  Have the time it's impossible to avoid it as it spawns in the middle of the map.  They could at least add a pallet or maybe another set of stairs so it's not such a killer sided place where the only thing you can do is take a hit a run.
---
Congrats man. Now work on rank 1 killer.
---
His power would be to go in and out of sight at well but in sight he can only stand still and survivors have a meter where when they look or are in his immediate vicinity too long it builds up and they go down
---
oh god. i only ever get 360‚Äôd. i‚Äôm scared of that life.
---
It's also used for vaulting silently, great vs spirit and nurse
---
I love the smell of cheap Halloween mask... in the... daylight.
---
u a whole bitch then
---
DBD definitely isn‚Äôt easier on PC, especially for survivor. You‚Äôre playing against a bunch of handicapped killers. Not sure why you‚Äôd think it‚Äôs easier.
---
Ya sadly I do see that. I had some hope there for a bit (I genuinely just enjoy these types of logical arguments, don't intend to get emotionally invested). But ya, you appear to be right.
---
I really appreciate your response &lt;3 DBD has been such a big help just passing the time and venting frustrations. As for stuff working out in my relationship, as much as I'd like that to happen. I just don't see how it's going to. We both want things to work out, just differently and neither party seems to wanna put in the effort despite caring about each other.
---
Myers' mirror make it so he's stuck in Evil Within 1 which means he has a very low range and he's very, very slow, you need to stay in the open as much as possible, look around, to take tight turns. And if you think he's on you, stay at a pallet, you can loop a Myers like this for double or triple the amount of a normal killer on most pallets. So make sure you have a pallet nearby when you do a generator. Not much to say otherwise, just abuse loops, it's his weakness.
---
Na man you‚Äôll get the hang of it!
---
"Adrenaline is a reward!"  
---
Four generators pop before your average killer can get from #1 to #7 in a patrol path (once they stop checking the nearest generators).
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
"NOED is a crutch!"
---
Sheesh I wonder why killers run NOED when generators take 50\~ seconds each, maybe because the two minute EGC timer is longer than the actual game itself?
---
It can be, especially when you're being face camped by a Myers in basement lol
---
Whoa lol that's rough.
---
Lemmings thats all they are, kull the weak my dude
---
crouching with urban evasion also leaves scratch marks
---
Second set of stairs is a great idea
---
No I'm just selfish for my own life
---
Get rekt n3rd, that's plus one for the console p1ay3r5 *fortnite dances in Arabic*
---
Ding ding ding you're a moron
---
It seems hella fun with unbreakable or tenacity. But I haven't personally used it.
---
I've never won in situations like this.
---
The killer assumes the last is going for the hook save in desperation and tends to get all four of you slugged, or camps the bodies as bait with LOS of the hook.
---
At least I don't recall the last time going for the hooked survivor with two slugged has worked out for me, they usually tend to be over-altruistic survivors who all went down underneath that one hook instead of waiting for a safe save.
---
Nah this will help with the immersion
---
For some reason I read the last card in noob3‚Äôs voice.
---
Cringe ass naenae baby in dead by daylight
---
Just to clarify, these are all my own ideas, I saw some other nemesis concepts a while ago, but I didn‚Äôt think they represented the character fully, so I decided to create my own take on him. I think he could be a good addition to the roster. His power resembles other killers in the game, but I added a few gimmicks to really convey the character and give him his own sense of identity. Nemesis is sort of difficult to fully balance since he is powerful in resident evil 3. Please, by all means, leave your thoughts in the comments. Enjoy :)
---
Why is it pointless?
---
Seems great for tracking injured survivors. Especially on legion who injures many people quickly
---
I think you mean the entity
---
I‚Äôd love to see Jason too, but time will only tell.
---
First, you're never ever supposed to give survivors a chance, the killer is supposed to kill as many survivors as possible. This is also the argument used for why the killer shouldn't camp, so unless you're arguing that killers should camp...
---
Second. I think you underestimate the number of ways a survivor can fuck up in under sixty seconds even if the killer isn't tunneling. DS is not always deserved.
---
Potato mode
---
Despite all the shit slenderman has gotten. His original design and story was horrifying before the internet destroyed him.
---
I think he'd be a super interesting idea. Possibly functioning different to other killers by not having a "base killer kit". Completely different way to move, injure, hook survivors would be great. But it wouldn't follow the structure of all killers having movement and M1 at base, which means he'd be turned into a weaker/stronger nurse to fit with the killer's base kit.  
---
That being said he could work like this: 
---
* 110% MS (I guess hovers or uses tentacles to 'walk'), 32m TR (which isn't a heartbeat but instead static that doesn't intensify the closer you get, chase music also never triggers for survivors).
---
* Having the ability to teleport to designated spots on the map within 48m (unseen to survivors) means you'll have to catch survivors off guard by teleporting ahead of them, or elsewhere. This would have a short CD, short 1 second cast time and can only be cast while not in view of any survivors camera (cast wont be interrupted by a survivors spotting you during cast).
---
* You can also stalk survivors to put them into paranoia which causes survivors to have negative effects. Stalking works similar to GF however slenderman cannot move while stalking and the survivor will be notified if being stalked. One of these effects are chosen randomly each time they reach fully paranoid.
---
   * Hallucinate Slenderman moving towards them at a distance, TR will trigger from these hallucination but will have no collision with survivors, slenderman doesn't see these clone's auras but can still see their models.
---
   * All other survivors emit a small (16m) static TR, the survivor also no longer can see the status of other survivors in the status bar.
---
   * Survivors are too distracted watching out for slenderman to focus on generators, great skill checks no longer exist while paranoid however, slenderman's TR returns to a normal heartbeat and chase music returns while paranoid.
---
* Survivors can calm themselves (removing paranoia) by collecting two pages. Once paranoid, two pages will spawn on the same side of the map and their aura will be shown to you. You can collect these the same way you'd pick up an item (doesn't actually act like an item). Collecting a page notifies the killer.

Jesus what the fuck did I just write.

A lot

Default weapon too. Didnt have enough AC to get the whole fit

Can also confirm
---
But it‚Äôs an anti tunneling perk. It doesn‚Äôt work that way. Therefore you were tunneling, you tunneler. Probably camping too.

He didn't even jump! He just kind of stopped and tilted, then pushed a little like this was a swim meet instead of a life or death situation.

I've come across survivors who don't know how to mend. At Rank 3. With 700+ hours played.
---
I don't even know whats going on anymore.
---
Seriously everyday
---
Hell yeah! I love seeing people as passionate as this!
---
Not trying to be a dick, but I don't think a perk being used primarily in green/purple ranks is a good sign for its usefulness. 
---
&gt; Honestly I'm just getting tired of hearing how everything that killers have access to are over powered, or these killers need nerfed, or any of the other arguments being made about how survivors have it so hard against killers they just dont have a chance against.
---
I can understand that, but I don't think complaining about prayer beads is unreasonable. There's complaining about something like Ghostface, and then there's complaining about an already S tier killer getting an addon that gives the most potent stealth in the game with no downside.
---
It takes two minutes to die on the hook, however, a full **120** seconds.
---
Meanwhile you have three other survivors on generators, each of the **three** taking **80** seconds, who can then hop on a **fourth** together for **33.33** seconds for **113.33** seconds total.
---
Keep in mind that this is before figuring in how long that survivor (the one getting camped) manages to run the Killer around beforehand, how long it takes the Killer to find them. How many times they can pallet stun the Killer and prolong the chase (this is why you always use a few pallets in your first chase, just in case you get camped).
---
If you don't get found for 20 seconds and run the Killer for 20 seconds, that's enough for five generators to pop and the exit gates to be opened before you're dead.
---
Now we have to beg the entity
---
Honestly it should just tell us that NOED was brought at the beginning of the game. Helps to level the playing field for non-SFW while it doesn't really matter with SFW. That or give us a number of how many totems are left at least.
---
[Aw Damn.](https://i.imgur.com/aQKRkzs.jpg)
---
You don‚Äôt need to play that specific character to get their perks. Just play as another killer you enjoy and use the BP you get on either doctor or hillbilly.
---
This is definitely a whole ass man. Nice lipstick bruh.
---
Funny levels don‚Äôt go to the 1000s
---
They prestige like with survivors and killers
---
Or be me and thinking the crouching teammate is pig.
---
How does it promote tunneling? Because it can counter one meta perk? Second, If I‚Äôm gonna tunnel you on my killer, guess what, it‚Äôs not gonna matter if you have DS or not. You‚Äôre getting tunneled right? So after your DS is gone, that‚Äôs a first class ticket to Tunnel City.
---
Also, yea your #2 point is usually fairly obvious, but thanks for the tip regardless. I‚Äôm meaning for other things like impossible hook rescues, or impossible gate exits, or just overall newby gameplay. If a newb is caught twice in a row because he‚Äôs bad, then the killer isn‚Äôt exactly tunneling is he? It‚Äôs just rewarding bad gameplay.
---
Username checks out
---
Perks that rely on being slugged are unreliable, Unbreakable is pretty good because it does the most important thing (getting you back on your feet) when you're slugged.
---
Other stuff like Tenacity and Flip Flop are way more niche than that, they do work if you get ignored for long periods, but unless you're crawling for the hatch or something...
---
TY 4 Donation :3 : Every time you hit a Survivor, you steal 200 Blood Points from them.
---
Cleavage Distraction: If a Survivor can see your cleavage while a skill check activates, they automatically fail the skill check.
---
Hex: White Knight: When a Survivor pallet stuns you, The Entity prevents all BP gain for 15 seconds.
---
Jokes on you, the real gen-rushers were the Neas all along. And if say you didn't see any Neas, that's only more evidence that they were there, urban evading behind a 3-tire stack!
---
I‚Äôm aware of the intricacies of a skillcheck reliant perk. Thank you though.
---
Once you hook a different survivor, DS should temporarily deactivate, for real.
---
The amount of survivors I find with DS still active after hooking someone else is unreal, generally because they're healing and BBQ&amp;C procs on them in a corner.
---
Yesterday I was playing on lery‚Äôs as Myers and while I was still in tier one, I turned a corner and got jump scared by an ace. He was probably as surprised as me. I couldn‚Äôt hit RT faster.
---
Perks and abilities?
---
The thing I notice most newer survivors seem to do a lot is fast vault when not in a chase and run into lockers, I guess some people dont realize it sends a noise notification.
---
I feel like I need to say howdy to Jake
---
It's by your own hand so facecamping would actually lose him it
---
If you don't care why are you complaining? You don't have to play a killer to get their perks, just dump BP into their webs.
---
... no...
---
I know. I wasn‚Äôt saying that‚Äôs what the bounty was. I was saying that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs not.
---
Lol shush
---
Fuck double bp I‚Äôll take being able to load into a killer match please.
---
I wish all killer mori's were done in a 1st person perspective :(
---
I had a match that I had a pretty good team of randoms on and we would've got a 4k escape because the killer gave up when just 1 gen was left. After the endgame started I snuck up behind them and when the timer ran out I ran right in front of them out of nowhere and they literally backpedaled when the entity spike popped up. One of my most proud moments!
---
This is why I don't even dare to play DBD if I had a bad day. Literally.
---
Ironically this is what I dislike about Ghostface, permanent stealth without the movement speed debuff of crouching Pig or EW1 Myers.
---
Anywhere, behind any tree, around any obstacle, could even be from behind; and being able to stalk and expose infinitely and 99 survivors just kind of makes playing against GF incredibly frustrating when you have to repair a generator.
---
Revealing him is sketchy at best.
---
It was nerfed significantly. It went from being a regular perk to a hex perk instead. I prefer it this way much more better than what I've seen for the old version.
---
Haha good one, as the running animation we could have that girl 'tweaking' with her back :D
---
Daaang, nice cosolays
---
If they're hanging by a gen or two that's almost done and I know there's a survivor hiding nearby. Leaving the area in that case makes no sense.
---
Play with your food is a must
---
This doesn't give much information if everyone is off a gen and moving around.
---
I play SWF regularly, and even with just 1 random, we have a hell of a time figuring out if one of the survivors is a friend or the random. It usually takes around 5 seconds of talking to figure it out.
---
more the bagging
---
Nice looking perks.
---
Rotten Oak  &amp; Spirit Fury in tandem would really f!ck with em!
---
Nice
---
Had someone send me a recording in my twitch chat of them as a random group of survivors all running around me and I was 100% oblivious to it all. From my perspective there was nothing but a gen to slap. From theres it was the dumbest killer alive.
---
Big feelsbad

Nea gives Quentin a run for his money in the ugly contest. Only a killer could be that hideously deformed.

I had this happen to me even so, was facing a Hag.
---
I found her Thrill totem and cleansed it, she chases me and draws multiple traps around my hook, the person who rescues me has Borrowed Time.
---
I get caught eventually anyway, she loses her Ruin totem after I popped Thrill.
---
She draws three traps under the hook.
---
Keep in mind at this point, the other survivors have finished three generators.
---
I get unhooked, person takes a hit for me, Hag still tunnels.
---
RIP game.
---
Rip this happened to me with Ghostface chilling at the gate.  When I walked back in he moried me. Never been so tilted in my life.
---
That‚Äôs great.
---
thank you
---
Its for the pleasure
---
What makes me mad is The survivor know's their dead like their is no point is toying with people either just kill them and be done with it (My personal Favorite) Or let them go.
---
I've been in games where my teamates are just dumb and show the hatch to the killer and the killer most of the time closes it and guard the gates where Once that light pops up on the door its over then toy with me even though I'm dead like I won't even run as last survivor in endgame collapse your screwed; but they'll let me open the door then crawl close just to pick me up then drop me further away.
---
Sorry for the late response just now saw it
---
The trapper who is at the hatch with you is also camping your friend on the hook? I might start playing the trapper if I can figure out how to make him teleport
---
Yeah I have that issue too but it works on some rounds, maybe it‚Äôs just ping? Not sure :/
---
Ik but most of my friends I play with stopped playing games for that reason and went to Monster world hunter or Minecraft where they don't rely on randoms; The only reason I don't is cause I can play killer and not feel like its my team at fault but me
---
He was camping everyone else before. My friend told me to leave because there was no way I could get him off, both of us finish the gens, and both escape.
---
How did I misrepresent his argument? Cite sources, please.
---
What logical fallacy did I commit? Cite sources, please.
---
I'm always a potato. Of course ice only had the game for two weeks though. I'm that straight line runner that can't find pallets or window while. Lol
---
This has been suggested several times already but perhaps showing the hatch aura at a certain range say 32m for example might help. I was thinking perhaps it could reopen the hatch by hitting 2 tremendously difficult skill checks and it's not like instant opening like a key it would take around 15-20s and failing the skill check would reset progress and notify the Killer. Again this is all theory so don't it too hard.
---
I‚Äôve pissed off a few killers in my time and always get this treatment when I face them.
---
This is late but I just feel like teabag sounds weird lol
---
Where the hell are th-*pallet to the head*
---
I'll wait 3 centimetres from the exit line make sure the rest get out yes
---
If you're having trouble finding Pallets &amp; Windows I strongly recommend unlocking Kate and use her teachable perk Windows Of Opportunity, it's a great helper perk for starters but even vets can pay off from it.
---
Exactly! No one ever likes to admit when the other person is right. Even when all they do is babble nonsense while I present clear arguments accompanying hard facts. It's tough when I'm always right and can prove it. Yet the other person just can't stand to be wrong. So they fight it.
---
You're the kind of person killers have nightmares about
---
What did I say that was false? Make a claim and provide evidence. Why are you repeating these like it's some game? Do you think I say strawman as an insult or something? A strawman fallacy is misrepresenting someones argument in order for it to be easier to dismiss. I say false when I have evidence to say so, not to play a toddler insult game. Why do you keep acting like that? I've cited all my sources, explained my epistemology, and explained why I am claiming you used a fallacy. You have done nothing close to that. Come back after you learn the difference between a debate and someone using big words to sound cool, because your immaturity is a waste of both of our times. I am here to have a conversation, and learn. You are here to insult and run away.
---
*Laughs in Lightborn*
---
Really? Huh, I never got that impression, but I‚Äôll take your word on that. I‚Äôll have to be more objective on his perspective moving forward.
---
We should start a support group for traumatized killers
---
No she doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs assault
---
By the mistakes they do. Usually new players drop pallets too fast, they run in straight line to open areas, and such. 
---
In short, when you catch them effortlessly you know they are new.
---
Siege and DbD have been my main games for a while. DbD since last March, and R6 since maybe late 2016?
---
Yup, just DC when this happens, it's impossible to leave, you'll clip through the exit
---
Thanks, i'll go by this metric, seems most reasonable
---
Wow, nice.
---
A hatch aura would be nice, I‚Äôm not sure how skill checks would work as then the endgame could pause and then the killer would have to find that hatch again If there were some notification the killer would get around 5 seconds in while the hatch loudly creaks and shakes and then it forces open again. Those theory‚Äôs are good, but the dev team could do some tuning to it and could perfect the mechanic. It would actually be a clever perk that every killer has to remember where the hatch is if they just rush to the exit gate
---
It went back to the drawing board like they did with Decisive
---
That‚Äôs kind of dumb. The smart move would be to ignore them and go for other survivors, then you have a survivor that‚Äôs busy getting chased and a survivor that‚Äôs busy chasing you while only two are doing gens
---
And Pig is just watching from outside the map as a monitor appears before all of them with the signature John Kramer voice: *"Hello all, I want to play a game."*
---
You keep your BP when the killer DCs unless they changed that and I don't know.
---
Naw I grab dat ass every time
---
Don't blame ya i'd rather die on my 1st hook
---
Oh my god it‚Äôs awesome!
---
depends on how bad the slugging is for me, I don't think it's unfair cause it can be countered if the survivors play it right
---
it can make the game annoying and unfun if the killer is trying to slug excessively, or when survivors aren't in close proximity to each other and there's more than 2 of them, etc.
---
I feel you bro but sometimes I just gotta admire that ass then chow down!
---
Wtf?
---
ye i know it used to be like that but apparently you don't get BP when the killer dcs anymore and i really hope this wasn't intended
---
It‚Äôs a UI glitch
---
Hmm?
---
Breakdown should be built-in with Jane
---
If there's a couple people left in the end I'll go scout for NoED with small game to make the save more equitable.
---
Now it's really over iron will users that were escaping my spirit!
---
Simple. If you look at who the most viable killers are, they‚Äôre all ones with simple powers (Nurse, Billy, Huntress, Spirit). The ones with complex, multi variant powers just have each individual part be too small to be significant.  I‚Äôd rather have one good power that gives good chase potential and gen pressure than three bad abilities that don‚Äôt help out a lot.
---
are you sure? i had like 4k bp before this match started and after the killed dc'd i still had 4k bp. I restarted the game and i still have 4k :/ i really hope this gets fixes soon(tm)
---
Last I checked it depends on how they DC. 
---
If they use the in game menu you keep your stuff, but if they directly turn off their device or internet it can deny you your bloodpoonts, take away items, and occasionally remove pips.
---
IIRC Dedicated Servers are supposed to address these issues, so hopefully they come sooner rather than later.
---
SWF are normally better for a killer as they get over altruistic.
---
FALSE
---
UNDERRATED SHITPOST
---
well i mean if i wasn't playing leatherface i wouldn't even bother chasing a T bagger who wants my attention , but since i was leatherface im like hmmm why the fk not since he had a death wish .
---
From my experience that's not the case at least most of the time as it seems that whenever a Chase starts the other 3 do gens the whole time and they seem to be using mics to give themselves perfect coordination making it insanely hard to win as gens will get done pretty quickly
---
Note this is from y experience and I don't know how it is for other players as the ones I've gone aganst always carry instant heals and flash lights
---
That seems a tad broken in my opinion.. I think the bonus of extra blood points is a fair exchange for the communications the survivors should have.
---
I'd be ok with that too I suppose
---
That's not the point, the point is to make them eat their shit for being cocky. Sometimes it's worth it to throw a game to kill the one scummy survivor.
---
If swf play poorly their altruism will be their down fall.
---
I played against a toxic cannibal. He slugged me and the claudette and went to hook her. I just worked away to make it hard on him. Well she dies quickly and next thing i hear close by is that tell tale sound of the hatch opening. I get it right in time as i heard a heart beat. He was a camper. Also sort of proud, I made a Billy rage quit from looping. Mind you I wasnt trying to get his attention nor did I teabag. He rage quit after he lost sight of me for the second time. Getting better at looping.
---
No u
---
Need more killers like this, my buddy and I rage when a fellow survivor DC‚Äôs at the beginning of a match just because he got downed first.
---
And with trapper. Impressive!
---
Keep up the good work, serve the entity loyally and for its unholy sake keep chat closed =P
---
I was just about to say this.
---
Damn, didn't know DbD was coming to PS2!
---
Oh shit he's got airpods in he can't hear us
---
Now not only are you feeling down, but you ARE down
---
I purchased this game for 3 of my friend's recently, they're all babs and I've been enjoying them trying to learn how to hit skillchecks :') They went against their first hag yesterday, oh how they screamed.
---
Let them fight...
---
Sanctification actually seems legit. As a survivor main, looping pallets and forcing killers to break them when dropped is good enough tbh, but it‚Äôs a sweet concept for us that aren‚Äôt the best at looping, giving us an extra few seconds of surviving haha
---
Icon packs? This perks my interest sir. Let me know what you fund out.
---
I have a rule that I follow in with most of my games and its I would rather die saving the person who got hooked than leave, Most of the time I'll still go after them. But I'll only have 1 exception to that unless I'm on BT and on my last hook wont try to save then unless I get mended.
---
This happened to me earlier as Clown, I got spooked lol   
---
They poked my belly and waddled off
---
Ahhh
---
Man, you've just reminded me how much I love Hellblazer.
---
WHoah that was CLOSE!
---
no matter what i did i couldnt get to the perk i wanted before the entity
---
It's described as a rotting pigs head in the cosmetic description. I'd imagine it smells pretty vomit inducing on the inside.
---
Nice, I started playing the same time as you and just got rank 4 as a killer main. Feels like I've put a lot of time into this game already.
---
Think he‚Äôs talking about different matches here
---
Myers, simply because of the scares.  I‚Äôve yelled louder when he surprises me than I have against any other killer haha
---
i'll continue to do my part, but is there a term for what i got?
---
I love when they teabag in the gate and lose their item on the way out. It's like a douche tax.
---
it was for last years halloween event, where you collect there juicy goo for points
---
Close but nah she's been revealed as the entity itself as per like 2 Saminations ago which I'm using as a measurement of time.
---
PainReliever did a sound comparison video a while back. [Here you go!](https://youtu.be/ccDueW0jvjY)
---
That's an old screenshot it still has the quarter moon bouquet
---
Thanks I love it
---
Hahaha! Bruh!!
---
no just an old bloodweb
---
The problem with the first perk is that it‚Äôs hardly above meme worthy. Even if you brought Hope, got to end game and cleansed all five totems, you‚Äôre not getting much effort out of this one. Plus it‚Äôs another SWF booster because most solo players hate doing generators, let alone giving someone else a negligible boost. 
---
The second perk is just disguised OP. This perk has the old Mettle Of Man problem where one person with it is not a big issue but four players, let alone four solid players will just make this effect blatantly easy to abuse. Think about every safe pallet in the game, and how there‚Äôs no mindgame at those pallets because of the area around, nearby walls too low to do anything at or it‚Äôs a pallet between closed off walls that offer nothing but a save zone. When you get to those pallets the killer has no choice but to break it because otherwise they‚Äôre gonna waste even more time in a chase. Now imagine those same pallets but instead you had to waste an additional 8 seconds before doing anything just because. Imagine running to any safe pallet and getting 8 seconds or however much time the killer wastes going around the long way of invulnerability where you could practically heal in front of them or just tick down your exhaustion. All this does is further reinforce the gap of the strongest meta killers vs the others. All I see is more people playing Nurse.  This perk is just frustrating to even imagine being fair or passable. Side note: what about Spirit Fury? Does that top this perk or does the killer just lose 100%? 
---
Last perk: Buckle Up levels of niche. 12m isn‚Äôt very far and for a downed survivor I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôd ever want to see the killer aura at that particular moment cause you‚Äôll see the survivors aura after they go down anyway. This feels like a worse version of Kindred but with an extra hoop to jump through for an effect that is already in game by situational awareness.
---
Granny is gonna kick your ass if she catches you touching her generators
---
Saaaaame.
---
That kind of defeats the entire purpose of NOED and makes removing dull totems pointless. I'd honestly be a lot happier if there were more end-game totem perks that made removing dulls more important.
---
Oh I see
---
If you love bugs and glitches, you're gonna love Bethesda games. Oblivion and Skyrim are instantly 100% better when it starts to make no sense.
---
How so? Make a claim supported by evidence, as I have.
---
running in a straight line, waiting to drop pallets on me when I'm a Huntress, not very good at looping and failing mindgames, running into lockers, not aware of their surroundings (how did I manage to yank you off a gen when I'm a Huntress?), very, very dumb unhooks like attempting to do it behind me right as I'm stocking up on hatchets from a locker right in front of the hook
---
I was using ruin, pgtw, myc and save the best for last because you don't loose stacks for ambush attacking the obsession
---
League of Legends had a cool system of public judging. People from the community could help with toxicity by judging the person based of the game chat and info about the person. I don't know if that could be good for this game, but i would like to see something happen about this problem. If they cant hire moderators or the devs dont want to be so involved, than this public judging could be quite helpfull.
---
Using Ghostface detection addons yourself: I am the sneak man

Playing against ghosface detection addons: what the fresh fuck, he is right there! I can see him, reveal already!

Hey, i could really use a SWF buddy. I rarely ever get to play with anyone. I'm rank 13, and still learning loops but I'm getting better!

---
Nice man, Would make a pretty dope wallet
---
if we could put a timer on the 2nd perk that'd be nice, maybe cant be broken for like a minute, if it couldent be broken at all certain killers get fucked over, and can be infinitly looped over the pallet
---
Once two survivors are down in the beginning of the match its time to go for saves. Lol
---
You unlock Sprint Meg‚Äôs 3 Specific Perks at Lvl 30/35/40 (They Appear Orange in your Bloodweb). Once you buy those, you have a CHANCE to unlock it in other Survivors Bloodwebs. So to get Sprint Burst on Claudette, you have to Unlock the Teachable on Meg, then start leveling up your Claudette until you find Sprint Burst :) Hope this helps
---
I think I'm like rank 16 or 15. I keep getting thrown under the bus by team mates lol. Wanna send your steam name or discord in a dm?
---
doubt
---
FYI, the perk is called sprint burst
---
When you got sprint burst on meg, was the perk yellow or green?
---
It‚Äôs not just the results screen. The main menu shows less pips as well. Closed the app and opened it again and it was still down one from what it should have been. Same for my teammates. It‚Äôs not just a one time occurrence either
---
I literally just had this happen to me last night.
---
First game of the night, I spawned in and started work on the gen. I was in a corner of the map, so I kept an eye to my front, watching for the killer.
---
Just as soon as I think to myself ‚ÄúHe must be chasing someone else because it‚Äôs been quiet,‚Äù the loud as fuck Exposed Sound blasts my eardrums and scares the shit out of me, followed directly by ghostface coming up from behind me to play tag with my kidneys.
---
I jumped like half a foot out of my chair.
---
Purple
---
Their called emblems.
---
I believe it‚Äôs a Perfect Game
---
really.. you're that fragile that 4 strangers you don't know and will never likely see again in a game words make you feel bad? lol, ok.
---
[You need to watch this](https://youtu.be/2s8BSiTf1kQ)
---
Well, to get it on other characters, it needs to be orange or teachable. You will get it somewhere between level 30-40
---
Had some non toxic swf recently, theyre a lot of fun when they play nice
---
Legit one of the scariest things is not seeing a survivor hiding by a pallet and getting stunned when not expecting it
---
Games are more fun when you get to reasonably put nostalgia goggles on to play them. They gotta live that long first
---
I would recommend playing other killers or survivors. I understand that kind of playing because I do it too. If this is a sliver lining I once had to play billy for a ritual I refused to delete it so I played him over and over. Eventually he became one of my highest level killers and on of my favorites to play. It‚Äôll get better over time. You just need some practice.
---
It made me smile that I cracked rank 3 on PS4 today. That is the highest rank I've achieved.
---
He ran, slowed, did some weird baby steps and then slammed his face on the concrete. I'm guessing...not a track star.
---
that looks incredible! and a small question I hope doesn‚Äôt sound rude, but can I ask where your boyfriend got the jacket? (I wanna cosplay Frank myself, and his jacket looks incredibly accurate)
---
Use Lery‚Äôs offerings (hospital map). If you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll probably get fucked with an open map.
---
So simple yet elegant
---
Ya know what? I gotta admit this would be cool, I think his power would be like a reverse ghost face
---
If YOU look AT HIM then you'll get exposed and also when you do look at him you'll get the cool glitch effect on your screen kinda like doctor I know it should be like teleporting but bish we already have the nurse.
---
He got a bug in the last patch
---
Does this actually take a saveable picture? I assume people just take screenshots on their screens?
---
yeah OP added saw theme music to this version though
---
Been looking in the mirror lately?  Yes, I read it, and a killer's ability to move fast doesn't equal camping.  It's not our fault if you're unable to think on your feet and deal with MYC.  Billy doesn't even need to be counted, since he his mobility IS an instant down.  Nurse will need to fatigue after returning to the hook.  Hag can only come back that fast if you're an idiot and pop traps or she has to use an ultra rare with a 15s cooldown.  Spirit can make it in, but she'll be blind on the way in and put her power on cooldown getting there, which means she can't use it to chase you. Freddy can only get there if threes a Gen nearby and it takes a while to channel in and warns you he's doing it.  Your lack of skill and critical thinking is only surpassed by your ability to bitch about petty shit.
---
Especially since I‚Äôm 12 so it‚Äôs good I‚Äôm a virgin üòÇüòÇ a 15 year old bragged to my 10 year old friends that he‚Äôs not a virgin üòÇüòÇüòÇ he‚Äôs not accomplished he‚Äôs irresponsible üòÇüòÇ
---
You have to do something special to get hatch from me, usually, or just be painfully bad.
---
Like there are some people who go "if you run X perk if use Y survivor, you get hatch" and I think it's ridiculous; are you really gonna give Kate or Shirtless David the hatch no matter what they do or what anyone else does?
---
I do have a soft spot for Feng, but I don't give them the hatch just because of their survivor choice - now if it comes down to two different survivors that impressed me and one is Feng, well...
---
Lol why do i get downvotes? I didnt said anything mean just a little critic. People are really that thinskinned here?
---
He doubted when he should not have. Remember Miyagi's words:Walk on road, hm? Walk left side, safe. Walk right side, safe. Walk middle, sooner or later, get squish just like grape.
---
That sounds about right but I think spirit will be there but not Legion
---
idk why the downvotes? i didnt know this either, as far as i can recall there is zero indication in game that this the way to rotate them.
---
Yeah, I play SWF usually with two other friends and we can still get our asses handed to us if the killer is really good.
---
I think Legion would be easier to implement than Spirit and its more switch friendly, only reason why I thought that.
---
Yeah either way a Rank +2 in one match is really good. Congrats man
---
toxic survivor. 
---
literally everyone teabags so i just ignore that but if i catch them sandbagging others or farming others off the hook or leading me to the injured one in chase (clearly on purpose not coincidentally) in a really terrible or excessive manner i‚Äôll get them out of the trial, then resume normal gameplay. sometimes i purposely let everyone else live.

So in retrospect, 8 seconds is definitely a little long in comparison to other exhaustion perks. Reducing it to 2/3/4 seconds would definitely be better, and put it more in line with the distance gained from something like Balanced Landing or Lithe. Alternatively, a survivor choosing to vault the pallet could remove the sanctification.
---
&gt; what about Spirit Fury? Does that top this perk or does the killer just lose 100%? 
---
I think the reasonable change would probably be to have Spirit Fury cancel out with Sanctification, and that the pallet can immediately be broken if the killer chooses to do so. It's hard to gauge exactly how they should interact since this is all just hypothetical, but I'd prefer if one perk didn't just completely override the other. 
---
Regarding the first perk, it's mostly just meant to incentivize the cleansing of totems more, and make it so that it's not a total waste if the killer wasn't running NOED. While the net 2.5% speed gain doesn't seem like a lot, it can help out drastically in a chase, particularly toward the endgame. Reducing the difference in movement speed from survivors and killers to 12.5% from the normal 15% (with many exceptions) should extend chase length by ~15%. 
---
You do bring up a good point in bringing up how these perks interact with Nurse, already one of the most played killers. Frankly, most looping perks aren't going to do much against a killer that can teleport and ignore walls. The Nurse doesn't play by the same rules as other killers, and so most perks of this vein are going to be largely ineffective (see Lithe, Balanced Landing, Sprint Burst).

Missed the opportunity to use make up and go for the Meg look
---
Lol what the fuck?
---
Least played are literally all the males(excluding Quentin and David), top 3 are Nea, Meg, and Laurie, and my fav is probably Nea or Quentin
---
&gt;Now that hooks regenerate, they should remove it.  
---
  
---
And hooks take THREE minutes to regenerate, I'd have some understanding towards that point if Tier 3 Hangman's Trick was an innate thing for all killers, but it isn't.  
---
&gt;It's way too easy to camp, tunnel, or body block and it just encourages shitty play.  
---
First two points are a playstyle that is widely regarded as an inefficient strategy unless gates are powered, the third point is simply not true considering both the basement stairs and opening have been widened on maps where killers could potentially hold survivors hostage. The basement is the most efficient way to put pressure on survivors given that there's only one way in/out, it encourages anything but a shitty playstyle.  
---
&gt;They could at least add a pallet or maybe another set of stairs so it's not such a killer sided place where the only thing you can do is take a hit a run.  
---
So you want another pallet on the safest loop spot of any map without the influence of perks? A double pallet shack would be almost comparable to the infinite on the Myers house with Balanced Landing. If you're getting hit at the shack while looping it, maybe you should work on not getting mindgamed by the killer.
---
I'm not saying they faked the footage, but I am skeptical.
---
I disagree. Anyone who has played MMO‚Äôs or really any RPG will be aware of the common/uncommon/rare/epic blah blah of item levels. I quickly understood which was worse and best. On the other hand knowing these numbers has made me reevaluate these facts and it genuinely is a little infuriating. Why would you use what looks to be a pretty basic understood concept of tiers and then make them this weird wonky change of values with no discernible way to know besides, presumably, looking in the game files.

Chucky lol

What am I seeing here?

Great killer idea but 25% gen progress is a lot maybe 15%?
---
I never said it was lit I said he payed money for this game just like anyone else and os welcome to do anything he wants to in a game because he payed to be able to do so. Anyone who tries to police what people can and cannot do in a game is a knobhead plain and simple.

Je ne parle pa fran√ße
---
Got hit by a hatchet that flew through the unhooked player
---
That should be a thing except it only gives 2% extra progress
---
I have chat screenshots where they say they do it on purpose as well...
---
So not slamming the pallet for the stun save was purely so the killer would continue to haul that survivor around and give you time to free yourself?
---
Im fuckin yelling
---
Before you make that assumption or allow someone else to make that assumption for you, are you using a wired or wireless connection?
---
No, she is a mid tier killer. she doesn't need any nerfs, and this one would be a fucking gigantic nerf.

This looks amazing!! This is a great cosplay. Keep doing more both of you because this is just gold.

‚ÄúMy friend‚Äù - every throwaway account
---
that 4th idea is terrible considering survivors get 15-20k bloodpoints a game, not every swf is full of tryhards, a lot of them are casuals and fairly easy to 3k/4k
---
Happened a few days ago.
---
Three people were left at the end, Tapp got hooked and Meg opened a gate on the other side of the map - the second one was somewhat closer.
---
So I make my way over to Tapp, seeing the Nurse hover around nearby. Meg was nowhere to be seen, but Tapp was about to die, so I went for it.
---
I got downed after unhooking him and he went down too shortly after. While on the ground I saw Meg's aura still on the other side of the map by the gate. And she left.
---
I died on hook, but luckily Tapp got the hatch.
---
In the post game chat I thanked Meg for being "helpful" and she was like "It was a Nurse, I don't go back for that! And the gate was too far away!"
---
Well ... you could've opened the gate that was closer? There was also no NOED? If we were two to save, we would've had a bigger chance of escaping all together? No? Okay then.
---
I'll say it again... DCs. ARE. NOT. BANNABLE on an individual case.
---
Yo no hablo espa√±ol
---
I prefer the clown to to the 3 of them, but Plague isn't bad by any means.
---
Then again I really like Pop Goes The Weasel so that's part of it.
---
That said, obligatory "Leatherface for BBQ and Chili!!!"
---
That said are you buying with money or shards?
---
Did he eat you? Asking because your name is cool beans
---
you two definitely took that to the bedroom and role played
---
Wait,  isn't he jobless too if he uses that logic?
---
Shards, so these are my only options. I do really want pop goes the weasel but I hate clown lol
---
I love how you can tell how pissed off he is that you didn't stoop to his level and throw back at him. Well played üëèüëèüëè
---
For the record, in case you were unaware, if all the pools are cleansed with and reset, it gives the plague her corrupt purge then and there as it resets, so that‚Äôs a thing to keep in mind as well
---
If you knew, that‚Äôs fair, it‚Äôs just something to be cautious for if you go for the reset the pools stratagem
---
Why get mad at swf god sorry for having friends
---
Lol I love him for his Santa outfit. 
---
But yeah I would go clown then plague then legion but that‚Äôs just me. I assume you already have spirit.
---
Honey I was outside at a campground üôÉ
---
I'm sure you were, lol
---
Decisive... isn‚Äôt what it used to be. As a killer, I don‚Äôt mind it now
---
Surprise pallets are how this game got its horror categorisation
---
I have receipts.
---
I'm sure
---
What would be the escape for all survivors?
---
I miss these :(
---
Intense and very sweaty what!?!? I need to know that they're doing that is intense and makes them sweaty.
---
can i hack then
---
Just play a lot. But I also started playing almost all the time with a friend. But I got to rank 4 on my own once so it is just grinding sometimes.
---
Get clown or plague, plague is an okay killer as she has the ability to either insta-down or injure survivors with her vomit. Clown, he can stun survivors for 2 seconds out of his gas, making them move at 90% speed, unless with addons, where it would be 85%, 80% and 75% speed.
---
I ignore bad messages. I always type ‚ÄúGG!‚Äù and apologize if i did something shady in the match or accidentally had a ping spike or something. The loudest ones are the ones that get noticed the most, and sadly negativity is very booming in the community.
---
Not gonna lie, these fries taste better than any other type. Sucks i can never find a place that sells them
---
Yea i normally do the GG thing and every once in a while I'll text a couple things if provoked, but I went off on these kids lol I'm probably gonna get comm banned again but they pissed me off üòÇ and ive noticed the negativity, its as thick as the fog in the game lol
---
You didn't even use the roboto font :(
---
When you have a shitty day you already feel bad. This just pushes it a little more.

how about you turn back, good sir. there's nothing to see here
---
would you happen to know that youtuber's url?
---
&gt;The 4 survs in the chat: "YOU FUCKING CAMPING TUNNELING CUNT KILL YOURSELF NOBODY LOVES YOU"
---
&gt;-Cackles evilly and says GG EZ before exiting lobby. Is in a much better mood.
---
Fixed that for you.
---
These are the only reasons I camp ever. I hate people who point out other survivors, I will tunnel and camp idc if the other survivors escape bc of it.
---
The devs have already said not to report DCs. Escalating soft bans are issued for repeat offenders. Until dedicated servers are implemented, that‚Äôs all they can do.
---
We expect them to be turned off eventually, i don't DC if ruin is found immediately, i just wish the totem spawning made them last a few minutes atleast
---
The devs intentionally made her this way unmasked, because they wanted inside her mask to be black, but at the same time, they wanted her to have skin so they can edit her model in the future for cosmetics. good theory though.
---
As a killer, hate mail are just love letters. Thats exactly the emotion you are supposed to generate in the survivors. You are their killer, after all.
---
What did the clown do to deserve this tho
---
I'm confused as to how this isn't fixed yet

Top 3 Survivors:

Least played:  Claudette Morel, because I ain‚Äôt no ‚Äòlil bitch
---
Killer being on the same map = camping.
---
I bet these dweebs were trying to unsafe unhook and getting mad that you wouldn't let them. No use even trying to explain to these people why their strategy is wrong, when they don't even let you take two steps away from the hook before dive bombing it. You can't fix stupid.
---
Im pretty sure blocking someone doesnt stop you from being matched with them
---
ty :D
---
I agree with everything besides calling it cheating, it's not cheating, just a shitty way to play as Killer.
---
Not saying OP did that. Otherwise, the message isn't bad at all tbh.
---
Actually 1000 hours here and I still drop pallets early
---
Hillbilly, Nurse, Spirit, and Huntress were the most common. I did get an occasional ghosty or clown though.
---
Don't even get me started on the teammates. I cant tell you how many times i've been sandbagged or seen people crouch around corners rather than unhooking and the like.
---
Dude thats rough. You can do it though! Make sure to practice looping, or be like me and avoid the killer all together if possible.
---
Can I escape with this?
---
Yep, I've had a douche that was so annoying when I queued back into them I strung them up, watched them die and let the 3 others live
---
On top of it all, there is a literal perk that compliments tunneling. Dying light is actually a good book if you can eliminate the obsession fast enough. But other then that perk I avoid tunneling whenever I get the chance. If I see another survivor after you were unhooked the I will just ignore you completely
---
no just no. Great art tho :)
---
Or the bloodwarden and this happens: https://www.twitch.tv/madpandalord/clip/TalentedExuberantTrollSoBayed?filter=clips&amp;range=30d&amp;sort=time

Well, BHVR has been copying almost everything from Ubisoft anyway so why not this?

thank you!

Ghostface isnt a person though. Its the mask. Theres been many Ghostfaces. I think what we got is better than getting Billy/Stu and Sydney Prescott as a survivor from the original Scream.

After rank 10, rank begins to mean very little. I‚Äôve seen immersed red ranks and loop god green ranks.
---
Yeah. It's not a perfect idea, but it still provides a small safe zone, and you can drop the pallet before the blink if you want to be on the safe side. 
---
I posted this idea in response to rumors that devs may be changing nurses kit a little.
---
Yeah I see shit like that a bit, I don't bother typing anymore I just leave straight away.

Well for a build that doesn't rely on other killers teachables, a loadout I have used is:
---
Whispers (helps track survivors general area)
---
Distressing (larger terror radius hides phasing sound in a larger radius)
---
Sloppy Butcher (Survivors spend more time healing or choose not to heal)
---
 
---
Rancor (Spirit Perk (A detection skill to find survivors on gen completion. With an added bonus to Mori your obsession in end game collapse;))
---
May I ask why?
---
Bless the Clown that farmed after someone DCd when I had the daily to escape with Claudette that I just couldn't seem to be able to do otherwise, ur a great guy

I love this game.

But what I love more than it is the

M E T A
---
Watch game play and if you‚Äôre buying spirit save up shards not money
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt matter
---
1663 hours and I'm a god who escapes every game/s
---
I die every game because I'm terrible at unhooking others because I assume the randoms will TOTALLY go to unhook so my teammates die early so we don't get many gens done. And then to add to that I drop pallets too late at times and then others times a bit too early so I either drop no pallets in a chase or I drop 5 pallets in a minute chase.
---
Sanctification would be suuuper broken though. Killers are already slow and hindered by pallets, making them unbreakable for X seconds would be a must have for any survivor.
---
I know Its a meme but many take defeat negatively,even in the game which because your attitude towards the game is related to your state of sadness/exhaustion ,you take defeat in a game too seriously .
---
Advice-play a game like a game ,if you lose learn n move on , dont let a game ruin your mood too.
---
It's a sense of entitlement that people have, and if the other players don't conform to their self inflated ego, they go and attack them for it. It's human nature. dbd and the way it works just happens to bring out the worst in people.
---
Favourite/Top 3 most played survivors:
---
1. David King
---
2. Jake Park
---
3. Kate Denson
---
Least played: Claudette, Dwight, Laurie, and Quentin.
---
Agreed, fuck NoED. I ain't gonna reward the guy running an overpowered perk with additional kills for doing so.
---
To be fair you can achieve a similar result using distressing. There's no phase sound when in the terror radius. Although it is true that the survivors will be more uneasy and may hide before you reach them
---
This is a really cool idea. I love the idea for Hallowed Ground. Honestly I think it could be a bit stronger. Maybe let lit totems count and give 2 tokens.
---
This isnt any of the Ghostfaces from the movies. They only got rights to the actual mask not the movie itself
---
I guess I will save shards for spirit and buy Halloween (It has Laurie too so I‚Äôll be both enjoy as the killer and the survivor)
---
They paid for the mask not anything else, cheapskates really
---
I've started just DCing whenever they teabag after a pallet stun/drop. I know it's shitty but I just don't want to deal with these manchildren in any capacity. I'd much rather just get to the next game and hope that my next group of survivors aren't complete shitbags
---
I always go back but I usually regret it.
---
It is not being a pussy it is being smart.
---
"I want to keep the mask on"
---
You okay fam?
---
I mean Spirit is the better killer and comes with better perks, but you can just earn her with shards whereas Micheal is real money only. So if you can only buy one it makes sense to get Myers.
---
You doing alright?
---
You alright man?
---
Yikes
---
But why
---
why not
---
It‚Äôs a mutual agreement between myself and my duo partner, that if NOED takes one of us out, the other‚Äôs free to leave. We aren‚Äôt arguing or letting a killer get another sacrifice.
---
In terms of points they didn't
---
you aren't alone
---
I think the point is that the hatchet went through Tapp into Bill.
---
‚ÄúHey that game went pretty well. I have only 15 min before bed... let‚Äôs play one more so I can go to sleep feeling good.‚Äù
---
You survive being camped, tunneled, you did your objective, you avoided getting death hooked, you played your cards right. You EARNED that 4 seconds Spring Burst, and that Instant Heal.
---
And what the fuck do you mean like everyone else? You make it seem like EVERYONE lives every game and if they do, don't punish the survivors, that's the killers fault.
---
Oh I‚Äôm fine at looping it‚Äôs the mind games. And then since I looped them a while they will probably camp because of the rank I‚Äôm at, but hopefully the build I‚Äôm working on helps.
---
PTSD
---
Post traumatic Saw disorder
---
True
---
I don‚Äôt think there is eithee
---
Then there's me straight up not bothering with adrenaline because of how fucking devasting it feels when there's 2 or more in my killer matches. I would just feel cheated out of the challenge of surviving on my own
---
Didn‚Äôt think it out yet, some first ideas:
---
- he can give a survivor a beauty pageant crown, and she becomes some an obsession, which makes her profitable for other survivors to be around but also an easier target
---
- he can spread ice cubes which makes it harder for survivors to move through 
---
- survivors should be able to sabotage his hook with a tool box while being carried
---
I am agreeing to that.
---
This is the correct reason rather than baseless hypothesizing.
---
You're in the second highest tier of ranks so yeah I'd say 6 is good
---
I'm sure they weren't playing for points, they didn't touch a single Gen all game, they just wanted to mess around with a Killer I guess.
---
This made my very bad Monday extremely bearable.ty!
---
We've found it:
---
The most pointless thing on the internet!
---
You really can't go wrong with either, in fact I think that the Spirit and Michael Myers are the two best designed killers in the game, although the Spirit is a bit overtuned in terms of power, especially regarding her purple add-ons, which are some of the strongest in the game. As far as perks go, Save The Best For Last for Myers and all of the Spirit perks are really solid. Dying Light and Play With Your Food are both mediocre at best though.
---
I posted this on fb and twitter so i thought i would post it here! The ghostface was a random and we were fucking around lol
---
It's even better when you watch the 3 man swf who left you to die on your first hook get blood warden/noed üòÇ.

Then again maybe I'm just salty from my last match.

Well all have that "Oh i found a survivor in the locker while reloading" Huntress moment. For it was the time i hooked a Meg on Lery's Memorial and ran out of hatchets. I opened a locker for the sole intention of reloading and a Nea was in there. Suffice to say, i won that match.

---
It makes me laugh when people think *not cleansing* is a viable counter.
---
Against a rank 20 Plague, sure. But if they have any semblance of skill, and/or there isn't a pallet/window nearby, Survivors will be going down so fast that gens will grind to a halt. On top of this, sick Survivors are easy to track and can't hide in lockers.
---
End of the day, if you're not gonna bother cleansing against Plague, you should never bother to try and prevent NOED.
---
What does the red bar mean
---
the progress bar? the line you see when you fix gens, heal, sabo
---
You're actions are slower
---
true that
---
No i know what the progress bar is i meant what does it being red mean when in dream state
---
They aren't hard to get, especially if you also run Black Wards. The perks you are talking about are only semi-useful and only give you a vague warning.

Treat it like Myers, Pig or Ghostface, don't commit to finishing the gen in 1 shot. Keep moving.

I remember back when I thought that was true too. Red ranks is just full try hard on both sides. I made rank 1 as killer one season and I played so scummy for it I never did it again.

Despite the theme conflict, Constantine would work more as a killer than anything to be honest. I have no difficulty imagining him walking around with a terror radius at any rate.

I bet they were the one unhooking their team right in front of you, making it their fault

What the hell...

Just stop cheating 4head

I wonder...

If GF stalks you, can Trapper then instadown you?

Oh dont get me wrong I love the current version of the game...but to play it with a two year old in the house would be very silly haha, has it is I wait until my little lady goes to bed and then I can play.
---
All I'm suggesting is a more colourful version of the game (one that would only change the game for me and not other online players) so I could play it with my daughter not being terrified if she was to see it haha!
---
I be you can hear this image, can't you.
---
If you're asleep, you are influenced by dream powers aka snares and dream pallets. If you're awake, you cannot see them and you're not affected. Also the vision in the dream is more foggy and freddy has a lullaby as terror radius, non directional and it has the same intensity, so you don't know where he is.
---
Did he rape you afterwards?
---
The first 2 perks are pretty bad. I would switch them with Bond/Empathy and Borrowed Time to fit your protector build.
---
Clap clap clap üòÇü§£üòÖ

What‚Äôs that 2nd perk
---
Idk why people say Mettle is "bad" now, it's still pretty usable, for me anyway. And I already run borrowed on Bill, I'm weird and don't like repeating perks lol

If you want to play it on pc there's the pc version. Mind that the plastyle is almost the same, but there are some mechanics that can be abused like insta turn and no collision with killers.
---
&gt; "it allows us to actually tweak the numbers and not have to modify the item description for every small change."

It's not very difficult to programm it so these change automatically by just displaying the same number that's used in the code though.

If you genuinely think they didn't attempt to gain the Scream license, that's moronic.

But hey, it's trendy to shit on BHVR right?

if only I would have decided to keep moving a bit lol

Haha! So true üòÇ this is why I'm not a creative thinker haha!
---
This looks like Billy from stranger things.
---
I also had how borrowed time is there for anti tunneling but after a save they can body block a door way or something and force you to proc borrowed time or get stuck and do nothing when I don't want to go for them because that would be too much tunneling but they force you to hit them...I'm getting aggravated just talking about it

I‚Äôll never understand people wanting to farm, it‚Äôs so boring and you get enough points just playing normally

DUDE WHY ARE YOU TAKING SELFIES AT THE HATCH, QUICKLY FIND THE EXIT, THE KILLER CLOSE THE HATCH AND THE END GAME COLLAPSE TIMER IS ABOUT TO END
---
Just kidding that looks cool dud
---
It's purpose is to deter camping.
---
It does infect them if they aren't already infected, it's actually really important if you're downing people with Corrupt Purge - once you've downed someone and Corrupt has run out you can infect them on the hook or ground, which means you continue the cycle of producing corruption without having to vile purge someone in a chase itself.
---
This looks great!
---
I leave them at 99% and try to save my teammates, then while i'm saving the hooked ones, One random survivor goes at the gate, doesn't give a fuck that it's at 99% for a damn reason, opens it. The One teammate i saved doesn't save me back so that's why i always get fucked playing with randoms
---
I always ugly laugh when I see someone say "DBD is a dying/dead game"
---
Yeah, random teammates are bad, and painful to play with
---
It extends the duration of the tantrum i think
---
Imagine doing a gen and then seeing a face inside of it

I literally have no idea what I just watched but I still enjoyed it

well he is stupid.

The Wiki does not say any such thing, you simply didn't read it properly. It is unique to the Cannibal and needs to be unlocked first.

Sydney Houston? You mean Sidney Prescott?

Smh shake my head smh

nah, you can double pip with 3 iris and a gold.
---
The key is this is a game not real life. The game is very difficult to balance and their are things both sides can either use or do to swing that balance heavily in their favor. When this is done the opposing side feels cheated for lack of a better term. They are forced to play a game they have no chance of being able to compete in, or in some cases such as tunneling and camping even play. That is why people get mad because they, like everyone else who plays this, just want to chill and have fun playing a videogame so when their put in an impossible situation they will target the one who did it to them. Not condoning it just explaining my theory.
---
Playing the game as a killer with the intent to kill survivors is frowned upon, don't ya know?
---
Somebody else said this and now I'm concerned about what porn y'all watch
---
You mean how massive the trapper is

He actually picked up the jacket at a thrift shop! &gt;&lt; Sorry that doesn't really help, but best of luck with your search ;_;

---
The thing is, by not trying to get better at chases you probably never will be good at them. Sometimes you just can't escape and have to loop, if you can't do that you're going down. That's why I think an aggressive playstyle is almost always better than a stealthy one, it helps you get better
---
Once you know how to master fred then it's not that much of a challenge. Just the ppl you go against.
---
Lets not forget NoED Rancor Devour Hope and Haunted Grounds
---
Doesn't it do that already?
---
It's so satisfying to cleanse all totems before the endgame, escape and find out killer actually had NOED
---
Nah you go back, farm them, and then leave.
---
Gotta get them bing bongs all you can. It‚Äôs the only true purpose of the bing bong boi seeing as he‚Äôs so easily looped.
---
I kinda understand your sentiments, I hated being killer so I only wanted to farm but honestly it can be more tiring than a normal game, esp getting them to realize you're trying to farm. I mean, most people still have a daily or something they need and farming is a good way to get it over and done with so you're not deranking cause you need to escape as Jane but she's a level 3 and you're a rank 6
---
Think they will add her tho? I‚Äôd pay $5 for Sydney from scream, heck I‚Äôd pay $10 if they added Cindy Campbell from scary movie, or a map to go with? was really bummed we didn‚Äôt get a department store map

Hell nah, I'm taking him to the basement, and facecamp him with leatherdaddy, won't even hook either, just slug to death

Haha so true. Only I get revealed by a Kate behind a tree every time

Congrats man!
---
I‚Äôve only had a couple of 32k games, but I‚Äôve had a SHIT load of stuff like 31,950 or 31,250, close enough to make you sigh and go ‚Äúreally? I couldn‚Äôt have just kicked one more gen or something?‚Äù
---
yeah, camping is fine, that‚Äôs why it subtracts points from your badges and makes you de-pip.
---
because that means it‚Äôs an intended start that isn‚Äôt toxic and doesn‚Äôt ruin the fun for everyone. and bugs are fixable, anything added would bring bugs. of course they do need to polish the game a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt mean they shouldn‚Äôt add anything.
---
Spirit and Nurse will ALWAYS be S tier. Nurse is literally the most powerful killer in the game. Nurse, Spirt, and Billy will always be top 3.
---
it does literally nothing, it has been tested a lot and it does nothing, it just increases your tantrum duration, that's all
---
what?
---
Had this myers who went insidious with ew3 after hooking me.
---
Result? 3 downs.
---
Nothing wrong with good perks or offerings, they wouldn‚Äôt be there if we shouldn‚Äôt use them

You know you can grab them while invis right?
---
Happened to me yesterday, pissed me off too because I had to perfectly stealthy to open the gate vs a spirit and I just died to the timer
---
What does efficiency do?
---
Is Helen SMG character?
---
Alright, when I said not giving the survivor a chance I was more just implying that if you're tunnelling you're being a dickhead, and that you're most likely gonna make the survivor angry and make him depip, because you were consistently on his ass. I mean, how would you feel if just the entire game you had no chance of survival or even no chance of pipping up because the Killer just wanted you dead as quick as possible. Yes, I agree that DS is not always deserved, but I'm saying that being the anti-tunnel perk that it now is, it's pretty damn weak.
---
Omg. I cant believe idiot killers like you still exist. Please uninstall. Didnt you read the "Survivors Rule Book for Killers?" Chapter 4?
---
Rule no. 3843 clearly says: *clears throat*
---
"If the Killer hooks the survivor (which is absolutely unacceptable btw) and is still in proximity of 10000 meters from the hook, he camps and should get banned"
---
Also, rule no. 9217 says:
---
"If the killer hooks a survivor, that survivor is rescued, and later killer looks at this survivor for 0,0002 seconds, its considered tunnelling and that killer should immediately get banned"
---
Only if we can also have Valak as killer. (‡∏á Õ†¬∞ ÕüŸÑÕú Õ°¬∞)‡∏á
---
I keep my killer in the 12-16 rank range just for this reason (and for farming reasons). If I wanna go on dbd and have fun I play killer. If I wanna have a bad time I play survivor in red ranks.
---
These are the worst fucking perks i‚Äôve ever seen, decisive thinking would only be for hurry megheads that tun away after failing a single skill check, reporters enthusiasm is literally just shitty quick and quiet, rational plan would give survivors no help, just shitty OoO
---
I'll see it when I believe it

*perk memes are on the rise again*
---
Me : ah shit, here we go again.
---
Its not problem with you, its with the entire community

all survivors are skins tho

stop using adrenaline if you don't want NOED to be so common, simple as

Dont be surprised that i brought franklins if i catch yo stanky ass with a key in your hand before the match starts.

Meh, who cares. I'm not made of sugar, who cares about bm? It just looks silly.

For honor is coming down like a brick wall. since the start of y3 the game has been losing between 20-30% each season, if this goes on it will be down to 1500-1700 average players by the end of the year.

All survuours are good in their own way. Best is to just play all and get the teachable perks.
---
I misinterpreted your comment, I'm sorry
---
My crutch perk, I feel naked without it
---
but aren‚Äôt they just skins with perks? once you have all the teachables why use any other survivor apart from claudette and ace?
---
Pharmacy, ace in the hole, streetwise and botany knowledge. (Have fun)
---
omg nerf piggy she‚Äôs too op what the fuck

Well it's all up to who you like the most. But yes, when you have all of them it's just skins with perks.

What about achievements?

You get downvoted for the truth.

Down from 6700 average. And with raider and Hitokiri still the same unfun noobstompers I doubt that they can retain a lot of new players from the giveaway.

why the frick are you using boil over and why the frick would you make it level 3??

Well... You just paly who u like/identify with. Noone good rly needs P3 Claudette or silent ninja Ace.

You've brought the Sin to my dashboard, how dare you.

Soo you played both perkless and addonless freddy because you burned the smokijg splinter and got merciless, how bad were the survivors?
---
Just git gud and escape lol
---
For bloodpoints
---
Aesthetic
---
From a lore-wise standpoint it makes sense you'd get more rewards for winning a long game because the Entity feeds off emotions such as hope and desperation and when the gates are opened the hope of survivors reaches a climax. But when they get captured anyway the Entity is even more pleased because it would rather consume a survivor filled with hope than an 'empty shell'.
---
Honestly they should give survs slight stat boosts / nerfs just so they have tangible differences other than skins
---
not many are saying nerf him though
---
HEEEEEEYYYYEEYY YAAAAAAAH
---
As I'm aware the moddles can be edited as can in game icons so in theory you could make it have a cutesy feel the only thing is animations can be changed on your end. You will still get hit and hooked but  it could be a bright pink hook.
---
Ps look at potato mode mod
---
Just kick the kid out
---
There's no such thing as genrushing you twat
---
I think 20% (16 seconds) would be ok
---
sorry i dont take advices from incels
---
Back in like 2013, I decided I wanted to take LoL seriously and played for rank. I forget what it was but I eventually got to the second highest rank in the game, and then I realized something:
---
I wasn't having fun anymore. Every choice was the Meta or how to beat the Meta, I wasn't playing my favorite champions anymore, and forget off the wall builds.
---
I legit don't care about ranks anymore. I'd rather play Piggyback Trapper at rank 12 than play Nurse at rank 1.
---
Maybe give her one RBT and remove ambush attack
---
jake/ace/dwight/etc. repairs faster, but debuffs last much longer and healing is very slow
---
meg/nea/etc have quicker exhaustion recovery but are much much louder
---
claudette/laurie/etc heal faster but skillcheck lines move much quicker
---
jeff/bill/david run longer after being hit but repair slower.
---
these are only examples or placeholders, but something among the lines of it
---
What's there to nerf? Freddy is a good in the middle killer now.
---
They're at Wal-Mart in the frozen section.
---
The same way your mom reacted when you were born you scumbag?
---
Surveillance does a lot of wonders
---
No one knows yet, but soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
And how the hell am I supposed to show them DCing more than once?  Pretty sure they can only DC once per match genius.
---
I've been getting an insane amount of killer dailies lately too
---
I main David for the body.
---
Also, Ace? Quiet? Have you heard his pregnancy breathing? Probably, because it's the loudest shit in the game.
---
We live in an entity
---
Um, tf
---
you will never pip up twice if you dont save anyone. how would you feel if your random teamates let you die on your first hook? pretty damn mad.
---
Top 3 (unordered) would probably be Feng, Nea and David
---
Least played would be Jane
---
Nah, he is quiet as fuck, quietest survivor in the game
---
Hopefully soon. I'm tryna prestige Bill and Tapp!
---
It's a term (mostly used wrong) for when a killer has tunnel vision on a survivor that just got off the hook, no matter if someone tries to take the heat or bodyblock.
---
Workout. That's why bringing Meg is the best strategy for this daily, she's an experienced athlete.
---
Simpler abilities tend to be more mechanically demanding and rewarding, and more complex abilities tend to open up a wider range of complementary playstyles and strategies. But it's also that stronger abilities lend themselves better to different builds and approaches simply because you have a more reliable baseline performance no matter what. Simple abilities can also be more mentally than mechanically demanding, such as Trapper's or even Hag's. And then add-ons usually add complexity to most of them, anyway.
---
I prefer simple abilities, if only for the reason that BHVR has not often shown to be good at designing more complex kits that are as useful and powerful as those simpler ones. 3 mediocre abilities in one killer don't compare to a single strong ability in another, especially given that the latter usually has a wide range of utility, as well. Add-ons can then be used to diversify the simpler base kits, which they have managed well enough with some killers (such as Myers, Wraith, old-Freddy, Trapper...).
---
Something I would be interested in for example is a grappling hook ability similar to Apex's Pathfinder. That would combine their scrapped concepts of a climbing and flying killer into a design that can actually work in this game. The ability is mechanically simple and a lot of fun, and given DbD's maps, would have a high skill ceiling due to how much you could grapple onto, catapulting yourself in chases, to traverse the map, or to get up to places you have reason to get up to. Potentially even grappling survivors, to some effect. Add-ons could then complicate the ability, such as allowing it to go around corners, or arching over structures, or even allowing the grappling lines to persist in the map as obstacles survivors have to play around, in one way or another (e. g. having to vault over or crouch under them).
---
Warning! If you decide to become a blendette, expect to get moried here and there. If you dont mind this, then go ahead!
---
Just calm down!
---
Lmfaoooooooo üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You think you could make some coasters like this? I‚Äôd totally buy one :)
---
Yeah I mean as the killer, love it as survivor cause it‚Äôs fun and kinda easy to escape sometimes, but as killer I find it pretty difficult, I too love the saw franchise :D 
---
But you describe it the exact why I feel about it as well haha :D
---
Same. Whatever happens is absolutely worth getting hit
---
Oh man that's annoying! I understand 99%ing, but at least have the door ready for when it's needed!
---
A lot of variables. If I'm playing killer, I usually like it. I play spirit tho so that's probably why. When I play survivor, it depends a lot on my build, the killer, and the killers build. I will say that I get lost a lot more on that map and can't ever find gens as survivor, or stairs as killer/survivor. It's still a game of dbd though, so I'd overall say no, I don't hate it.
---
How could you say something so brave yet also so wrong.
---
If you put Ace's smug face over Cole's it's perfect.
---
BUDDY!
---
It's also always fun to ignore that person entirely. They put everything into a build to loop me, and I just don't give them the pleasure and instead have fun with this Baby Meghead around the corner cleansing a dull totem.
---
literally stands still
---
Yeah that‚Äôs fair enough, I play as the legion (level 31) and I just struggle but mind you I‚Äôve only been playing the game for about 2 weeks now so maybe that‚Äôs why? I just get frustrated because every other map I play on no one Escapes 90% of the time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Theres like, a million safe pallets. But somehow totem spawns seem to be elusive for what is a fairly small map.
---
It used to be the most killer sided map in the game, but I dont believe thats the case anymore after the adjustments they've made. 
---
Id like to see more indoor maps for diversity.
---
I leave regardless.
---
U a whole bitch too
---
Yeah there‚Äôs a lot haha I‚Äôve noticed that, indoor maps are cool but the saw map seems to be my cryptonite haha

As a survivor main, this is the realest thing I‚Äôve read all week. I hate my own people.
---
Is this true? I'm sorry that I ask this again, I'm new in the game and have not played that many hours to found any difference. However, I have read here [https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Survivors](https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/Survivors) that all survivors are equal and only thing that differs are indeed the audio. I‚Äôm confused now.
---
There‚Äôs literally no reason to have to earn a high tier offering that the devs treat as a basic feature of the game
---
That‚Äôs fair enough. Should I delete the post now or later?
---
Hex Devour Hope and Pop Goes the Weasel on Ghostface. I get a couple mori's a match as long as I don't use another hex perk
---
I'm offended
---
The only problem with this idea (imo) is that it would be hard to detect if a killer plays in a scummy way
---
No bro. Idk how long you were looping for. But devs said 2 years ago that they like the ambiguity from not giving exact numbers all the time.
---
You need a feather duster ASAP.
---
Had a Spirit game the other day, a survivor was unhooked right in front of me. I make it a general rule to never tunnel unhooked survivors but they both ran towards a pallet and the unhooked survivor immediately began flashlighting me at every single pallet. Maybe it's supposed to be a game mechanic but you bet I mori'd her before second hook just to get rid of her
---
I'm confused on how that brown add on is uncommon. It's so good. Should be rare or very rare
---
I main Billy so no, not a fan of it. Kinda hard map
---
At least its coming
---
Oh shit, this happens to me in every game.
---
Even things like cookie clicker.
---
I make every game into a big ass unfun task and them just rotate games so i can have a few hours of non-meta fun again qq
---
No i think it's 5% not sure tho
---
No. It doesn't currently work like that. That was just an example of how it could be.
---
Inb4 downvotes by angry morispamming killermains.
---
Head On might be my favourite perk now that it is easier to use. These sort of stuns are amazing to do and even when I‚Äôm playing killer I can‚Äôt get mad at a good Head On play.
---
&gt; I honestly don't understand why people hate slugging so much. As long as the killer's goal isn't to camp a downed survivor, waiting to get a 4-man slug, a DC, or a bleed out, otherwise slugging is fine.
---
Na that's opposite of what i do. I only slug if my IF activates and then i go after that person.
---
Probably more like battleship for the killer and candy land for the survivors
---
Wait, a moon boequet offering? I haven't seen one of them for a while
---
You cant rely on devour hope if you just want to kill a specific type of ppl.  You bring in something more reliable like a mori.
---
Everyone has it. I would totally recommend taking advantage of it because I absolutely love both games.
---
* Screenshot highlighting 4x emblems.
---
I love the Saw Franchise but jesus christ I hate the map with a passion. I hate trying to find totems and generators on it and I prefer a good open map (like Coldwind) where I can see people easier.
---
I mean go ahead but you could always just find friends to play with
---
No downvote. Just my opinion
---
Feel free to improve upon my idea because I do agree it could be very hard to detect "scummyness".
---
Sure buddy.
---
It‚Äôs worse when you‚Äôre hooked and see what everyone is doing. WHY ARE ALL 3 OF YOU COMING TO SAVE ME STOP‚úã
---
i see now who reported me
---
Can't stop me. I will camp you till the end of time.
---
If we get a hook handed killer, I'd prefer the Candyman, honestly
---
outskilled and outplayed
---
I dont think we are on the same page. Im not talking about camping the hook. Im just giving him a heads up for being a blendette. Many killers like to pop a mori offering and kill the blemdette(s) and hook the others like normal.

Can you not punish both? Get rid of the spamming of buttons. Have an option for hold to wiggle and spamming space bar or whatever controller button that is. It ruins hardware anyway and is useless. Then you'd know if they just gave up because it's not exactly hard to hold down a button.
---
Yeah a survivormain defending ebony mori's is definitly full of shit, hard huh to understand things?
---
I downvoted without giving an opinion because I'm on mobile.
---
By the time I get home, probably going to forget about it.
---
Bro everything gets downvoted here. Unless it's a meme. I get downvoted all the time for basic responses.
---
Yeah keep telling yourself that my dude, why can you make this post but not an argument? You're a brainlet tht's why.
---
Yes as a feral child
---
Ah to someone that hasn't hit rank one it's a nice milestone, but yeah I'd agree after you get it once and have the moment of "fuck yeah, I did it" theres very little reason to hit it again. Unless you really, really like playing against spirit and hillbilly.
---
Of course it is, I mean maybe not taking the game seriously and just thinking moris are cool are the things made of myths, I must be imaginary this is mindblowing
---
The solution ; git gud
---
Big brain post, I like.
---
&gt; if you don't camp much and tunnel much you'll earn karma 
---
Define camping and tunneling, because they both are in a grey area
---
What does "swf squad" mean?
---
maybe they have bad internet? idrk, i get its a problem and its soooo annoying but im just trying to play devils advocate, very badly at that.

You can't introduce karma system for killers only.

I wish i could say the whole game went like that but it didnt. I only killed 1 guy lol
---
you do notice how dumb this is, right?
---
You want the Killer to play in a way that benefits Survivors and want Survivors to dictate the flow of the game.
---
This is just a heavily biased shitpost
---
*MORI TIME*
---
They should give every survivor team comms by default, then buff killers and balance accordingly. The problem right now is that it‚Äôs impossible to balance killers for everyone when there‚Äôs such a huge difference in survivor teams.
---
Because no one cares.
---
Not gonna lie, this post could have gone a bit better. While it is an interesting point and all with the whole karma system and stuff you acted as though someone had already attacked you on it and now instead of a discussion this post is more of an office trash bin with molten lava spilling out the sides.
---
"Bug" Kappa
---
Exept now every other killer seems to be Freddy using bbq and chili and teleporting to my generator and using pop goes the weasel and then using those fake pallets because my teammates through down the real ones 2 seconds into a chase
---
I think a cooler killer concept would be the shape shifter. When ever he successfully stalks someone for 20 seconds he gets to turn into the exact survivor he just stalked. Then when he goes to do a strike then he returns to his original form.
---
More like ranking up as survivor lmao
---
smh you hoes dont understand art

He's the definition of twink tf u mean

We just saw this meme bro this isn‚Äôt the dankmemes subreddit where everything gets reposted

People need to remember that salty killermains re constantly downvoting everything on this subreddit or else they might think my idea is just a shit idea "because of the downvotes". Trust me if I didn't put those things in this would still get downvoted to shit, even my messages to other people saying "yeah I agree" would get downvoted for it, it's just a cancerous subreddit which needs to be pointed out.
---
Still survived ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

What were you doing jumping in and out of lockers lol

If your on console a little fake in 1 direction and a sharp cut the opposite way works great to bait swings

None of these guys have F13 on console and it shows. Literally the worst patch I have seen in any non indie game ever. Glad they didn't release it on PC.

2 ataxic respiration'. mmmm juicy
---
oh i completely understood good sir or maam
---
r/woooosh
---
I do exactly the same thing. Also, when I play survivor and see another survivor who tbags and flashlight clicks i report him cuz i feel bad for the killer
---
Basically you win if you pip, surviving gives you just more bp
---
Bill would probably get pissed and just attack the killer upon that happening
---
?
---
I‚Äôm a newer player. I carried a Dwight to the exit when his teammates escaped and left him bleeding out. A week later I randomly played against him in my other favourite game (Battlefield 5). We‚Äôre now friends.
---
You can use it for window jukes too, it's a pretty good perk.
---
Downvoting my comment won't change anything, bud.
---
Yeah and you enver camp either but everyone was around the hook right? Everyone is a good guy rank 1 who plays both sides 1000s of hours when they're on reddit that never camp tunnel or ebony mori and everyone believed you. 
---
Anyone who doesn't use ebony's because they know they're fucking broken would understand that changes need to be made and my change is a pretty fucking good idea but pointing out that someone lost to a mori once, I think it was more like 4 mori's yesterday, but you're not one of those people.
---
Don't suppose you were a Feng at the top of Ironworks, and the Killer was Huntress? If so, you're welcome :D If not, still a great feeling when this sort of thing happens!
---
They aren‚Äôt over-altruistic. They want the sweet points
---
I didn‚Äôt really refine my statements but you brought up some really good points that are the main concern I have with your perk suggestions. 
---
Like you said with the first perk, how it extends chase times, that‚Äôs already a bad thing because that‚Äôs where the killer gap starts to exist. Killers who have non-lethal powers or powers that do not assist in a chase are at an even bigger disadvantage because no only do they rely on capitalizing on survivor mistakes to get hits in, but at certain tiles or structures, there‚Äôs already little gameplay and with more speed, it makes them unbearable. Imagine the Coal Tower, Grim Pantry, Abattoir, or Myers House loops and how it already has such a boring and poorly designed interaction and you‚Äôre extending those chases by even more to where it feels like a ‚Äúoh the survivor is over here, if I chase them that‚Äôs game over for me‚Äù but then all four survivors run this loop/tile meaning you‚Äôll never be chasing people. 
---
My first part about the second perk again about the interactions is what I dislike the most. No one wants to feel robbed of a perk, so when you take the survivor perk and have it negate/be negated by another perk, it‚Äôs a sour feeling for both people. Plus if you still had to break the pallet with Spirit Fury, you‚Äôre still double robbed of your perk because not only do you consume your Spirit Fury trigger but you still have to manually kick a pallet that the survivor is still protected by. 
---
The last part about what I meant about the Nurse: when you have perks that extend chases, like how I said about the first perk, you only widen the gap of the killers who have chase control flow vs the killers who don‚Äôt. Nurse and by extension Spirit are able to create openings for themselves to get hits in but every other killer needs to mindgame (and that‚Äôs not a bad thing) or rely on the survivors mistake but when you make the survivors faster at the boring no mindgame loops or give them the ability to have super safe pallets or even remove the fear of their pallets getting destroyed, all that results is people gravitating to killers who ignore those rules, I.E more nurse and spirit games.

Doesnt it sounds familiar?

hey man are you sure you got the right post because your not making any sense.
---
Here's an idea: how 'bout no. 
---
I HATE the mummy. I don't know what's wrong with me but even as an adult I still get night terrors. No joke. I'd wake up and literally hear the moans and groans of the pharaoh and his mummy's. 
---
It scares the willy out of me.
---
He‚Äôs so far from daddy, he‚Äôs a power bottom twink.
---
Horses in Skyrim are so bugged that sometimes I think developers designed them like that
---
You can act ignorant all you want mate, you posted this earlier today, the post was called pointless by multiple people, and one person called you racist.
---
As I say, play dumb all you want, you've only wasted your own time reposting it.
---
They nerfed her again for some reason.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how this bug has gone on for so long. Hell, why does it still exist? I remember seeing it in the beginning days of this game on consoles. That was 2 years ago!
---
I‚Äôm hoping for this change too. Didn‚Äôt the devs go from saying voice chat was bannable a few years ago to basically saying it‚Äôs fine now too? Completely different aspect from the devs these days and for the best imo
---
*unzips and starts suckin*
---
I wouldn't care, honestly.
---
I agree with you, weird Quentin who hates NOED camping
---
Fuck I had a game like this last night. Solid survivor did 3/4 of a gen and looped the killer long enough to let me finish one. Got hooked and face camped so I finished his gen and then did another. So I did 3 gens and when I get hooked, I see the other 2 just circling the map over and over until they get downed and hooked too. They never touched a single gen, never attempted an unhook.
---
I have no idea what the hell their plan was. I was surprised to see they were rank 8 and 10 since they were completely useless.
---
He‚Äôs always been Daddy,
---
Tou know the first time you could open the locker cloaked for extra spook factor
---
That happened to me yesterday 1on a hook and 2 people down in the first 3 mins...
---
Yeah but at least there wasn't the Entity ready to kill you back in the days üòÜ
---
Go do a Gen.
---
Glad I'm not alone. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Do it now on surv good luck ...
---
Sometimes you just want to fuck off
---

---
Epic shot man. What's scary is people that main her and can hit shots like that constantly. Zubatlel on YouTube is ridiculous when it comes to those
---
I'm not racist tho jeez why can't I just post something I did without being harrassed
---
To be honest, after all the shit Frank put his friends through, I‚Äôm really positive that Julie‚Äôs done with Frank. If my partner forced me to help kill a janitor that did no harm, and bring me to a realm of eternal suffering, I wouldn‚Äôt be happy with them either. Especially since Frank made Julie‚Äôs best friend, Susie, help kill the janitor as well, which Susie definitely didn‚Äôt want to do, and probably messed Susie up mentally as well. At this point, I‚Äôm pretty sure Joey is Franks only friend left, or probably just an acquaintance at this point. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to find out if Julie and Susie despise Frank.
---
I‚Äôm not harassing you? Your post just looked like the repost from yesterday which clearly got deleted
---
no I didn't please stop
---
Are you trolling? They literally can'y get banned from this. The devs have a DC threshold, where if you dc more than a certain percentage of your games, you get a temporary ban. You reporting them will do nothing. I don't know what more I can do to convince you of this.
---
This is why kindred is a god tier solo survivor perk
---
Look if I get a Jane or Kate in a game I'm gonna make sure I get this daily done.
---
Yes he killed me
---
Actually makes nightmare/huntress scary, best balance update imo
---
I had a similar experience. I was playing billy for an ritual and I was on leri‚Äôs the last gen got completed. Then a Claudette started to be fast as fuq. She explained later that it was a glitch with a certain pallet on the map and it was the third time of it happening.
---
Yeah she was out like for 30 seconds or so but it didn't worked I guess
---
Finally someone else noticed Trapper's massive schlong and why he keeps catching me!
---
True. The first two are pretty terrible.
---
Ever tried playing red ranks without ruin? It's not even an experience because it doesn't last long enough to become one

What did he say?
---
This was me ahahaha.
---
I think there is legit people that downvote everything in this sub lol
---
Yes! I wouldn't mind some small increase of phase speed or reduce in the phase CD in exchange to she losing the collision
---
I've been screwed over by this mentality. Was looping a killer around the pantry for over 5 min, with the hatch next to the basement. If the last other survivor left I would of made it. Plus as soon as I was downed he left, didn't try to help. Like, thanks? lol
---
You're not wrong.
---
Mostly camping and tunneling, but you dont have to care about it, people are just salty. Play how you like to have fun. Both of those can be viable strategies at times.
---
Your change outright destroys any use ebony mori had, doubt anyone will run it after that or be scared by it, allthough better than the mori we have now it seems kinda... boring, also I mentioned your original idea in my OP as well. Mine keeps mori's alive and scary and fun for killers while at the same time not giving angry toxic pieces of shit unlimited amounts of them to use whenever they please, I'd say my idea is better and killermains are fucking rejects who will attack any post regardless whether I bait them to do so.
---
Spine chill = wraith no more
---
&gt; Flashlight clicking
---
In my opinion this isn't even BM. They're just looking for attention for whatever reason. Yesterday i had a dude constantly do it but he wasn't even good at looping i'd down him almost instantly. Post game chat he explained he simply had a chase daily lol
---
It‚Äôs generally frowned upon to tbag or flashlight spam the killer and as killer face camping or tunneling. Chasing only one survivor until you 3 hook them
---
Yeah, I definitely think there's a time and place for "toxic" strategies.
---
Dude you shouldve put survivors faces on the dudes walking too üòÇüëç
---
Right that's fair. Flashlight saves can seem like a game to many survivors, and tunneling seems to be a strategy for new killers to take on.
---
I'm sorry I don't understand your post, why would you only see negative scores? Why would you spend more time outside the trials than in them?

Maybe add a cooldown timer every time you abandon a lobby, while the timer is in effect you can't see groups.  Flag accounts that constantly dodge groups so they can't see them anymore for a longer period of time.
---
photoshop some blood effects onto the walls and you can say this took place in Lery's!
---
I tried it, but couldn't get the masking of the faces to look like how I wanted. They stuck out at really weird angles so I eventually scraped it.
---
It's a good thought though! Great minds think alike. üòÇ
---
See, I do that to purposely draw the attention of the killer whenever I play survivor. Once you've pissed someone off it's easier for your other teammates to escape.

"You guys are so mean, someone will say something nice about me in the comments."
---
What? Like I said in PM, I can't see your hours, can't see rank-achievements, all I could point out was that you haven't played since the 14th so it's kinda easy to say "just keep ebony mori the way it is" if you play this game once a month.
---
It's the first time the guy has got one, this post does nothing to negatively impact your experience, just ignore the post and move on.
---
It's happened to me twice. Dunno what triggers it.
---
Being the killer in this situation is always so rewarding, especially if it‚Äôs the one survivor you haven‚Äôt seen for the whole game.
---
I had similar thing happen to me yesterday. I was running infectuous fright and they kept being right next to me after i down them. So they end up 4K slugged. Post game they complained about slugging... but i mean... i wasn't running a slugging build but if you are stupid and stand next to me after i down someone, you are going down too lol
---
I'm not sarcastic, for real. It was ez kill...
---
You're also a massive fucking hypocrite considering your post history, grow up.
---
The graphic should just say 3/4/5% movement bonus. Writing it out as percentages with decimals makes it look like you're saying .5 (50%) instead of .005 (5%).
---
or at least according to this team, so basically i downed the Ace and kicked the gen and there was Feng literally standing next for me trying to get my attention and i go for her.
---
anyway i down the Feng and go pick up the ace, but the claudette sprinted right next to me so i heard her and i went for the chase and downed her and hooked all to end the game for us and move to the next one.
---
Not exactly, but you know Ghost Face? When he stalks someone, the icon of a survivor has a circle around that it fills as the killer stalks, and Slenderman would do the same but that instead of giving him a buff of his attacks, let's say you give that person some psychotic experiences or that slowly dies (like when the timer of the helmet goes when the Pig was there), and to get rid of this psychotic crap, you get notes.
---
Would be cool if they gave her some award for hitting ambush because it just sucks so much when it does only your normal M1. I was thinking about her being able to have no collision in dash and she can hit multiple survivors at once in one dash. So you would sneak on 3 toxic bastards on gen and slice through them thats would be rewarding more that some useless jumpscare pig noises and M1 injury.
---
The pigs make your choice is a solid pick
---
That wasn't the question and relating to perks I only asked what are some metas. After some googling I found a few meta builds.
---
I see you are new to Reddit, enjoy
---
OHHH you said me and my boy so I assumed it was a couple thing HAHAH I‚Äôm dumb. I can probably play later so I‚Äôll try and add you !
---
You would think that
---
And yet, you got downvoted.
---
Ok. You around today at all?
---
i looked, idk maybe it helps a little bit, but sure it's not "unbelievable fast"
---
I find it pretty good but only at the end of the swings
---
what history, exactly?
---
Me when I first got the game
---
That's a mori? üò≤
---
I literally couldn‚Äôt care less about votes
---
Then why did you even say it
---
A large number of your posts to this sub are just screenshots of leaderboards, yet you rip into this guy for essentially doing the same thing.
---
If a killer rush right into you after hooking someone, he have it
---
r/dbdLFG
---
I've not bought any DLC and I don't plan to. I only have the free ones and plan to get Spirit once I get enough shards.
---
Was just wondering because I almost never get flashlights in my bloodweb for any of my survivors
---
If the killer goes straight to you after a hook, if you use one of the jeff teachable perks (I don't remember the name). It's a strong perk so every people who have it will use it most likely, so play like they always have it
---
How killers think we communicate: I'm at point B2, and haven't used any pallets, my exhaustion is up and I'm by Ruin, I will lure the killer away so you can cleanse it, and make sure to go down on a pallet so you can save me, I also have unbreakable so if he slugs me I can pick up myself, make sure you get those last 2 gens done before he gets his first down!
---
How we actually communicate: I'm by trees I think, hurry at least finish 1 gen before he downs me I'm on death hook!
---
Watch that ban risk, I guarantee survivors are shitheads in more than 50% of the games you play :/
---
My favorite is when they're not even good. Like fam, you're a bm tbagger and your chases are shorter than everybpdy elses, now you're the first dead, dumbass
---
After the hook you can see the killer's aura. See if they are looking at you /teammates that are far away.
---
Rofl nice one, glad to see you already triggered one killermain with this, they really can't handle anything.
---
In the current state of the game, slugging is the only way to win against good teams, if you're not Spirit or Nurse. You have to know when to do it tho.
---
Break
---
It sounds like you need a break. All these Me Vs Them posts on this reddit is the real toxicity. I'm sorry someone hurt your feelings online, don't let it shape you and ruin your experience.
---
It's because those perks only trigger on *basic attacks*. They recently changed it because (I'm assuming) they don't want Hunting Hatchet, Chainsaw, or Feral Frenzy attacks to trigger perks like Franklin's Demise of grant Tokens to perks like Save The Best For Last. It's confusing because they made these changes without also updating the perk description to specify that they only work with basic attacks.
---
Also The Pig's Ambush attack is roped into this because Ambush attacks don't count as basic attacks either. Kinda sucks because it's just another Pig nerf but whatever.
---
Not skip the levels, just the perks. I was hoping to avoid two unwanted teachable perks in other character's blood webs.
---
If the killer has Bloodlust up and they lose the chase, as survivor, you‚Äôll know the chase is over cause you‚Äôll get your bold/chase points. As a killer the music stops and you don‚Äôt enter a seamless chase from one person to another. I believe chase is lost after 2 seconds or so with broken LoS and distance of at least 10 meters.
---
I NEED THE REST
---
I think the devs should just balance the broken addons and offerings, instead of dictating how people should play.
---
Was it the black or white one?
---
This would be nice. I don't want cross play because of the difference between pc and console that would be a nightmare.
---
But they have our data its stored on their end. If we could "sign in" on whatever platform we choose and use our accounts as is would be great.
---
Was it the black or white?
---
That would require skipping the entire level.
---
Even I do it sometimes with 1k hours in this game so I know this feeling quite well
---
Time for a failed pallet stun that never hit, resulting in me getting downed, placed on a hook, saved, downed again, and mori'd
---
Relax. 
---
Dbd. 
---
Pick one.
---
I'm sorry, little one.
---
I just had one.
---
What movie is it?
---
Lmao that killer just dunked on all of you baby survivors
---
https://youtu.be/Qmb9cnx__hA
---
Very quickly
---
But how?
---
Saving Private Ryan
---
You can also use flashlights to blind her
---
You can only gen tap. Prayer beads are hilarious to play as and awful to play against.
---
Lol you shouldn't try to speak the truth on this sub, its a quick way to get downvoted. Even if you do it in a polite way that doesn't accuse OP of anything like you did.
---
Oh yeah he's a blast...until you geta OoO swf cunt brigade. Which seems like every stealth killer game of mine.
---
Does anybody else think Freddy rework doubles up nicely with Thrilling Tremors?
---
I'm confused. Wouldn't you be happy if nobody used them since they seem to upset you so much? And it wasn't my idea. I read your post and saw that you mentioned the 3rd hook option and agreed with that as a change. The karma system you brought up is what is meh. The 3rd hook option doesn't have to be boring. Just make a change to the mori that by killing the player with your own hand you get bonus bloodpoints. Now there is still incentive for the killers to use them while not ruining the game for the survivors. Also, you keep bringing up killer mains like its an insult for players that only prefer one side. That doesn't help your cause and makes you sound like a salty survivor. Debate your idea off of its merits or continue to look like a fool.
---
What did they do exactly?
---
which freddy movie is this again? the reboot?
---
Fantastic plan man.  One group of toxic players just convinced you to play like a toxic asshat to every group of survivors moving forward.  Really sound logic there.  Players like them and killers that respond like you are the problem.
---
***DARN***
---
I actually agree with you. Against a strong rank 1 SWF team, even if all of your chases are short, gens are just done way too fast.
---
uUUUuuUuUuUh
---
LOL
---
They definitely played it terribly so it is their fault for sure.  That being said I wouldn't have bothered slugging to kill all 3 at that point since you still had 4 gens up and a DC.  Pretty unnecessary to end game that quickly in that situation.  Unless you're still low rank that looked like a safety.
---
If survivor go in locker where dwight is they instant die and dwight power is to force survivor to use locker üòÇ
---
Are you sure it wasn't there when you returned to the lobby because there's a known visual bug that can make it look like you didn't gain a pop in the scoreboard, but then it's there when you return to lobby. Usually it only happens when the Killer disconnects but maybe it's happening to you differently.
---
Yes
---
i think what he is pointing out is that its impossible to practice a new killer without getting teabagged, bullied and called baby by the survivors you get put against, i agree hes not helping the situation but he isnt wrong in saying that you cant pick up a new killer without sacrificing your rank and sanity most of the time
---
Nah cuz we checked the top right and I had been a pip from rank 7 and I was still rank 8
---
It's possible to complete a Bloodweb without purchasing any perks.
---
no worries! thank you anyway!
---
STICK IT IN ME DEEP DADDY MYERS UwU
---
Did she have lithe?
---
This post literally has two periods. I don‚Äôt understand any of it, except the part where you apparently got beaten bad and have now come to mash your keyboard on Reddit.
---
Even in the lobby? Because that's what the bug does I'm the scoreboard.
---
*Michael Myers Disliked That*
---
that actually looks perfect, thank you!
---
I can make a guide for addons too!
---
that's not how the emblem system works. # of hooks doesn't matter since the 4th got away, you got a silver devout then, if 4 gens got done rather quickly you most likely got a bad gatekeeper, depending on how lackluster your chases were, you could've gotten really good or really bad chaser/malicious. Perhaps the chases were long and you got little points, if there was possible facecamping involved that could've deteriorated your emblem more as well.
---
it sounds like you didn't perform too well which led to the depip, while I agree the emblem system needs tweaking, making it solely based on kills is awful as that's what it was before and that led to awful killers being able to rank up easily, because contrary to popular belief it isn't that hard to get kills as a killer.
---
Nah it's always a ton of toxins survivors  I just reached my limit today it was so toxic I litterally  wanted to dc so noone would get points. But I continued to play and suffer through it. Idc bout what survivors  cry about anymore that won't happen again
---
Here's my counter to that.  If you know you're attempting to learn a brand new killer you can't play as yet simply go into the game assuming the loss since you're there to learn the mechanics of whoever youre playing with be it Nurse, Huntress etc...Like you should be able to tell yourself of course you guys destroyed me I have no idea what I'm doing with this toon yet lol.  Then just laugh at how pathetic they are for bm'ing and feeling like they're hot shit against a beginner Spirit, or whoever it was they were learning at the time.  That's the approach I take during Nurse dailies lol.  Like why even get mad about it let alone to the point where you solemnly swear to ruin the experience of all future opponents.
---
We have thressome?

Ah, the problem then might just be the fact that survivor webs are a bit bloated. Once you get to about level 40-45, the webs are pretty much maxed out in terms of nodes spawned. From there you can expect the following:
---
* 7-12 Common nodes
---
* 7-12 Uncommon Nodes
---
* 6 Rare Nodes
---
* 3 Very Rare nodes
---
* 0-1 Ultra Rare nodes
---
Now, as pointed out there have been some wild variations but those are definitely outliers. Specifically for flashlights you have to consider what they are competing against to show up in your bloodweb.
---
Now, just by quickly do a count, you have the following
---
* 39 different Uncommon  items. So ~2.5% chance of a Flashlight per yellow node
---
* 35 different Rare items. ~2.8% chance of a Flashlight per green node.
---
* 16 different Very Rare items. ~6.25% chance of a Flashlight per purple node.
---
So yea, if you're specifically looking for a flashlight you'll probably end up frustrated more often than not. Trying to get anything specifically for a survivor can be hair pullingly unlucky at times. The only silver lining is the fact you're at least 'rolling the dice' 7-12 times for Uncommons.
---
how did he not hit you through the pallet? 0ms ping? xdd
---
And it could have an animation like the acid traps in the movies. That‚Äôd be cool.
---
Good idea
---
Exactly and I've went through this multiple times learning new killers this will not happen again
---
That would help a lot. I'm so confused with the many addons when going through bloodwebs. I've played this game for some time too and it has discouraged me from using items.
---
You sound like someone who has no idea how the killer ranking system works, shocking literally contributes 0.
---
And the BP numbers are so far off I don't even know where to begin. But hurr durr survivors get no BP right?
---
Freddy &amp; Ghost Face are both very good. Some do like Plauge and Clown though. I wouldn't go for Legion.
---
Well Freddy is probably the most viable out of the bunch and has some interesting stuff he can do with his teleport and dream snares and pallets plus his add-ons are fantastic so probably him.
---
It's a repost but in lower quality than before
---
Wow bonus bloodpoints that's not boring at all /s. Also your idea has been suggested 3000 times and clearly BHVR doesn't like making mori's useless but they should understand how OP they are so this is a great solution to keep them in the game but make them way less common kind like an inbetween solution, but I guess it's "meh" because... reasons.
---
Killermains are an insult at this point, go read some of the shit you say, go find any thread nerfing killers and see the autistic downvoting, they're complete morons 90% of the time.
---
Freddy or Ghostface
---
Congratulations you just became as toxic as the very survivors you despise.  Ironic and sad dude.  This community is way shittier than it needs to be because of both parties in your example, their actions, and your planned response.  You're all toxic turds lol.
---
I kind of hope the basement could look like an Egyptian tomb and that other maps could get themed basements.
---
I think Freddy is the best of these, and also fun to play.
---
making it soley based on kills would be bad, BUT, if the killer gets 3 kills then they killed 75% of them, the fact that i didnt even get saftey pip is bs, i did good that match but got punished, as a killer the job is to kill so i dont see why killing over 50% of survivors dont garentee atleast a saftey pip
---
I must of had the same idea as I literally just made this
---
I was being sarcastic
---
personally ill go with ghostface
---
Never said it wasn't, but they want to avoid the teachables which would require the entire level to be skipped. This is so it wouldn't trigger the teachables and make them appear until they got them.
---
It's almost impossible to escape her without iron will, and idk why people are OK with that.
---
Hag sacrifices chase power for map pressure. Nurse is hard to play. Spirit????
---
Yessir
---
Agreed, been trying to get his Adept achievement for a while now, had quite a few 4k games, but never managed to get anything better than a Ruthless killer so far. Granted, the Adept achievements for killers need a rework anyways, but Trapper in particular is unnecessarily difficult.
---
Exvuse me?
---
Yeah I always chuckle in my head when read on reddit how much territorial awareness killer mains think SWF gives
---
I thought you can't get it with a mori
---
Oh No!!
---
Ok sorry then :) The idea is really funny tho
---
Hag for Hex Ruin, Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili
---
Well, why not skip 30 perk and see if the 35 pops up at 35?
---
He's top 3 worst killers in the game IMO. I hope the update ther are planning for him will make him better, because I love the design and the idea for him.
---
Jokes on you, game was always toxic.
---
It‚Äôs even more frustrating when you‚Äôre seeing red ranks do this shit like all I can think is ‚Äúyou really fucked off your teams all the way to red ranks eh?‚Äù
---
Idk why but i misread the first label as "Pig penis"
---
I'm actually thinking of bond or empathy not spine chill like others suggested which have more use. Idk i just don't think the beads are op survivors can get pink keys out of chests like it's nothing and yeet out of the trial but a stealth add on for a killer is op? Im a survivor main but these are two sides to the same coin
---
Fuck bro in my experience kindred makes it worse. lol everyone can see each other and they start overthinking shit
---
While I agree Doctor is trash, TydeTime isn't trustworthy. He puts Hag in low tier and chases with her without any trap set. In his tier list Spirit is in mid-tier, because her "mindgames are 50/50"...
---
Dude are you trolling? It wasn't my idea. You literally brought up the 3rd hook option in the last paragraph of your post. It's meh because what is and isn't scummy is subjective and would be hard to determine how exactly to award or remove karma. Like you think ebony is scummy, however, Behavior hasn't displayed an official stance on them and leaves them in the game in a way indicating they believe it to be fair play. And honestly, you're most likely not getting downvoted by "killer mains" but more so because of your abrasive attitude and using things like autistic as an insult. Grow up. Trying to be edgy doesn't make you look cool, it makes you look ignorant.
---
The doctor has a perk called overcharge at level 40. It can be pretty good as long as you hit gens every once and awhile
---
Not really lol
---
If you keep the game going long enough you can.   As long as you get a merciless killer it don‚Äôt matter.
---
I think the main advantage is less farming because people see the killers aura.

BBQ &amp; Chili, Knockout and Franklin's Demise?
---
It was a whole team of Rank 2 + 3 and one 18. I'm trying to learn how to play with spirit at the beginning of the match I couldn't find anyone but generators were going off left and right. Extremely rushed which I don't mind because that is the objective of survivors but upon me finally finding someone they all had high-level flashlights and for some reason every time I get close to them they would get a speed burst which looked like a lunge. And One Survivor literally ran in a circle around this extremely long rectangle pallet Loop and even when I was blood lusted could not catch them because of that lunge. So I gave up on him moved on finally down a person put them on the hook and left trying to find the rest. He gets off I give Chase last generator left I'm figuring they're going to bang it real quick while I'm chasing so try my best to hit this person but they don't instead they continue to teabag and run around the map speed lunging whenever I get close and tea bagging when they got enough distance. Like I said I wouldn't have minded any of this if they didn't literally try to do this 4 up to an hour literally one of the survivors must have finally gotten tired of it and triggered the last-gen and I still try to give Chase and play instead of being a sore sport about it and at the end I got the exit gate tea bag Circle run every Survivor get hit once Escape. It's just uncalled for
---
I‚Äôve had the most fun with Freddy recently but the legion and ghost face are solid picks as well
---
Is not shaving and ruining my experience I'm going to make my experience fun again by playing the way I want and not worrying about people complaining.
---
Wouldn't hurt to try. Im not a 100% sure about perk teachables anyway
---
You completely didn't understand my use of the word counter at all there.  I wasn't providing advice on how to beat them just how you can respond internally thought approach wise to their actions since you're just there to learn a toon.
---
But sure let's talk about countering them play wise.  There are absolutely counters to high rank survivors.  It's called make great decision making with chases and pressure the hell out of the gens.  I've beaten countless red rank sweat squads over the years.  Don't tell me they're invincible because that's just something an inexperienced killer tells themselves out of frustration.
---
And good killers can win without resorting to playing toxic and using babystrats like camps and tunnels.  I do it all the time.  There is room to play fun competitive games for both sides and still be successful.  You just sound extremely inexperienced man.  You'll improve if you keep at it and don't freak out like a toddler at the first sign of bm.
---
Why would they need to do that?
---
Me trying to make sure every Survivor has a chance to get points and do things is starting to ruin my experience because I always end up regretting it's
---
Because they want to skip the teachables for those levels.
---
I honestly don't know what to say except that your plan literally wasn't going to work, even if you managed to unhook him and that's a big if considering he was sitting two feet away with a the chainsaw ready to go in that second it take to heal you he could've still sawed him enough to down him through borrowed time and then you again if he got you up. Good on you for trying to save him though most people just let them die
---
Sadly you can easily get to higher ranks by acting like this. It‚Äôs not fun for long but some lower IQ‚Äôs will be stuck on it longer than the average player
---
Stalk
---
Uhm... there is a crow... oh no, it flied away.
---
lol you should tell your friend dbd isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúrole‚Äù player type of game meaning he should really do a bit of everything instead of what‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier‚Äù
---
They can "skip" those teachables by just... not... purchasing them... I don't understand.
---
You are just a cunt
---
Them scores don‚Äôt look like a merciless victory to me. 
---
The 2k either suicided on hook straight away or got chainsawed down straight away. 
---
The 6k seems to have been tunnelled or found very quickly after being hooked and mori‚Äôd.

i've spent the past week solo queueing specifically because i want the rank 1 achievement and nothing more. i forgot how much worse the higher ranks can be sometimes. :( on the bright side, i'm good enough to get from r17 to r12 on my own merit?
---
I would've but I didn't even know that was a sub.
---
I dunno where this idea that Ghostface is one of the worst killers is coming from but I hate it. If all you're doing is crouching around and trying to rely on getting the instadown every single time, you're playing him wrong.
---
Oh my God I'm an idiot.
---
Balanced with Lithe? Do you mean Dance With Me and Lithe?
---
Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica
---
Like I said they're in a rough spot with ebony, if they truely think it's balanced then they're fucking idiots over there but I really doubt that, the thing is they don't wanna make them useless like your suggestion (oh I mean my suggestion that you think is better or whatever the fuck who gives a shit) but also probably don't want some angry guy to be able to use ebony mori's for 100 games straight. This is the solution they couldn't come up with or deem too much work. They can figure out what should give bad karma or not, just play the fucking game some more like when Cote got flashlighted by a bunch of asians and all of a sudden he realized those were overpowered.
---
Also very sad that you can't just admit that any idea to nerf killers gets shot down with downvotes on this shitty subreddit where you practically spend day in day out, first thread you've seen downvoted right? Only because of what an asshole I was and totally not because I wanna nerf their pathetic crutchofferings right? Wanna bet that if I make a similar thread in 2 weeks time without being a dick it'll get the EXACT same response vote-wise and argument-wise? You wouldn't bet a cent on it because you know this place is a shithole.
---
Yeah bro I know how to counter high rank players with my monsters cuz I know how to play but when I am two matches into a brand new killer I'm out of luck
---
That would be awesome to try to survive
---
use your power to down survivors
---
Yep
---
I feel I am quite a good killer and good at skill checks and stealth as a survivor, but I cannot for the life of me escape a killer once they're on me.
---
Get moried because I want his attention more
---
They are only forced to purchase one of them if they want to get the third teachable perk.

---

---
Nope I mean Balanced with Lithe.  Situationally I can choose the vault or the drop depending on what's around and the map.  Dance with Me is a great perk but my issue with it is I don't like running perks that help me lose the killer since I soloqueue primarily and my teamates are usually potatoes that can't chase for more than 10 seconds without eating a down.  I'd rather keep the killer on me so they can hopefully gen jockey.
---
Nice edit, fam. Also, if you‚Äôve decided to edit your post and have dedicated your life to one of toxicity now, don‚Äôt censor your words.
---
So you forgot to switch accounts huh? Which is hilarious because this account your on now commented agreement on this post! Fail.
---
Oh yeah. Freddy has the mobility to slow progress from the info TT gives. It‚Äôs a bit easier to just use bbq and PGTW but Tremors is just as great.
---
Clarice
---
bloodwarden got nothing on SWF groups
---
idk maybe look for subtle grass movements and crows where survivors give away their position i guess.
---
You literally just learn how to run tiles and survivor is incredibly easy.
---
I main The Pig at high rank too but that doesn't sound right.
---
BBQ has been on the shrine, you might have to buy learther  dlc depending  on how much you need it, plus i think its the cheapest as well
---
That makes sense but I think the first one should be a short one then a thirty minute just in case they actually did just lose connection
---
Ok. I just didn't think of having 2 exhaustion perks being useful.
---
But it really didn't seem like that.
---
I would have hated you for that move but the explanation justifies your decision. Thanks for giving toxic Nea players what they deserve. I hate Nea.
---
And the survivor HAS to as well. You don't auto escape by hiding in a locker, infact if you literally just stand there, you make other survivors have to pick up slack, become an easier target for the killer with crows, and gain nothing.
---
It's much more impressive 2-3 hooking everyone than facecamping everyone on first hook, which is why you get a different amount of points despite the end result being the same
---
BBQ has been on the shrine 3 times, once this year and twice 2 years ago
---
I know him and pig can get stuff done with good map RNG, and all the stall add ons with stall perks...
---
But if you look at nurse spirit and billy, they can win with no perks and no add ons... it's a fuckin struggle and map RNG is practically required but at rank 1 I can 4k with a naked spirit  that's viable...
---
Just cause doc can win on the game with a skill check terror radius build, doesnt mean hes viable... hes still one of the weakest out there.
---
Imagine the jump scares
---
It's really only viable with beast's marks, since it increases top speed. Even then you have to charge your saw for a while.
---
Ooh have they made it more reliable now? I know that when I was playing Jane, it barely seemed to trigger when I felt it should have.
---
Hell if I drop a 2k with trapper at my play level I feel like a lucky son bitch...
---
Why drag out the game unnecessarily. They barely got a single gen when i got like 6-7 hooks with ruin still up on the other side of the map. Also the guy DC'd after i downed him (30s before the vid starts
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
hopefully people don't randomly calls me racist this time
---
There's a reason killers dominate at lower ranks tho. It's easier to be good than survivor is.
---
So you mean your reward for *surviving* as **Survivor** is to [**survive?!**](/intensifies) Waow value!
---
Again Adrenaline isn't "earned." You didn't do fucking anything to get Adrenaline: you survived as Survivor and got to the end game which you're supposed to do anyways. Stakeout is a perk that's earned because you need to actually go out of your way to do something. Diversion is a perk that's earned because you need to actually go out of your way to do something. We're Gonna Live Forever is a perk that's earned because you need to actually go out of your way to do something. Adrenaline isn't "earned" because you survived as Survivor.
---
The only real difference between Adrenaline and NOED is that Adrenaline is a win more perk while NOED is a lose less perk. In a lot of ways I'm more fine with NOED as a concept than Adrenaline, since I think if you build specifically around making the worst out of a bad situation you should have some payoff for it. But the thing is that NOED is way too strong and there's absolutely no beating around the bush in regards to that. I just really hate how NOED's mistake of balance lets so many other major issue perks slide in people's eyes because "at least it's not NOED."
---
To quote YongYea: ["I can be both extremely concerned about ~~climate change~~ the strength of No One Escapes Death and also have mixed feelings about ~~Epic Games Store exclusivity~~ Adrenaline."](https://youtu.be/xdfB8VDCVtQ?t=1225) Do a think there are issues far larger than Adrenawin that need to be balanced before tweaking that perk? Yes. Do I think there's a lore more nuance to Adrenawin than just "Instaheal bad plz nerf?" Yes. Do I think that Adrenaline is perfectly fine because of all these other problems, and henceforth doesn't need change? Fuck no. The perk is far too strong and there's absolutely no beating around the bush with that. You can't look at the [second most used perk in the game at all ranks (second only to Self Care ~~and Dead Hard at top ranks~~) run by nearly 10% of **all** players](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/417/AX2DY4DTKOE0.png) and say that it doesn't need changes. Yes 10% doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that there are 65 Survivor perks in the game and the statistical "average" usage rate of a perk should be 1.5%. Even the most run perk (Self Care) is only run by about 14% of Survivors at high ranks.
---
Sorry about that rant but it just really pisses me off how many people dismiss the obvious problems with Adrenaline as a perk because "NOED bad." Do I think it needs immediate change? No there are a lot of other perks that need tweaking first, as well as overarching game mechanics to make Adrenaline less of a game changer and make Killers less reliant on NOED. But the perk definitely isn't fine and definitely needs tweaks overall.

Sure that's a good idea upvoted.
---
or  change  the  trophy?  is  that  really  your  defense?
---
Ok....
---
I mean that seems to be your whole policy on killer mains right? But I'm bored at work so I'll humor you and continue to play this game. Yes a lot of things do get downvoted here I can admit that, however, most of the nerf killer posts come from salty survivors. There was a post yesterday about removing the basement from the game. The FREAKIN BASEMENT. Anyway, the karma system would be extremely flawed because again what is toxic or scummy is subjective. Is tunneling scummy? It can be yes, but sometimes it's the optimal play. Is camping a hook after last gen scummy? Again it can be but it can also help to secure another kill against an overly altruistic team. Lets flip it to the other side. Is body blocking a hook  toxic? It can be but it also helps to save a fellow survivor. Is running the killer to directly to other survivors working on a gen toxic? Yes, but it could have just been an accident.  How would your karma system deal with these instances?
---
Pig can stall a game, if you get a small map to patrol better she can win... but this is crutches on addons, and perks and not the killer itself
---
Bro what are you talking about? There's clearly multiple reddits of people who get angry when they play games. If you were born in 1993 you certainly don't have enough sense to be as old as you are.
---
I‚Äôve never seen a throphy being changed on the ps4. 
---
So yes ... that is my defence.
---
I think that the second perk and spirit furry can exist together. Spirit furry overrides second perk because the plaster can just throw it before the killer is there. Otherwise blessing the pallet could just increase the duration to break The pallet.
---
i did this *once* AND I WAS S A D
---
The only exhaustion perk you can't run with another is Sprint Burst.  Pairing them up can be quite effective situationally not to mention there are a few maps where you practically can't use Balanced period.
---
I mean when the game is in your favor, of course you‚Äôre gonna dominate at lower ranks. Killers are better than survivors until survivors learn to play the game. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean the learning curve for survivor is high.

Disconnects and people pointlessly killing themselves on first hook are definitely a huge problem. But I also want hard tunneling to be addressed because it has been ruining multiple games for me. Bonus points if it happens 3 games in a row. DS isn't enough to stop it. Killer lobbies are really long right now for a reason. And it's because survivor right now is pretty freaking lame for a few of the reasons:
---
* Disconnects
---
* Boring, quick, easy objective (literally just hold M1 on 5 generators)
---
* Killers hard tunneling someone out of the game 2 minutes in
---
* Bugged perks and shitty hits that shouldn't have landed
---
On top of the regular pressure that survivors have, the hag doubles up on that because the jumpscare gets me so hard every. Single. Time.
---
I'm really not wrong.
---
That, my friend, is your body telling you to be a Pig main. JOIN US.
---

---
if the survivor can hide the entire match then gets the hatch or escape cause the other 3 did everything, killerhas to kill them, if the killer face caos its basically garenteing atleast 2 survivve, but if they play corectly 3 will, qnd once in a blue moon all 4
---
Hit them one by one war of attrition eventually they will go on the hook
---
i cri :(
---
Legion 2.0 I see
---
I'm a killer main that plays survivor a decent amount. The game is heavily in favor of killers as of right now. I don't know how anyone can play survivor and enjoy it.
---
tbh its not really his chase that makes him a bad killer, a decent bubba can end loops pretty quickly if he catches the survivor out with his m2, but bubbas are notoriously bad as their mobility is very limited, so although he will down most of the survivors he chases, the gens will get done and he most likely wont get more than 2 or 3 survivors killed, although in a chase you can loop him like any other killer and if he uses his chainsaw try to run around objects while hugging the corner and hope he bumps into it, then you have quite a bit of time to run if you manage it
---
Well Plague kinda does

that‚Äôs what i wish legions ability did tho. have to hit several times, no bleed out timer, but no cooldown, doesn‚Äôt give you an aneurism after hitting same person twice, and a tiny bit of hit cooldown.

That's a shitty suggestion though. This is about ebony mori's getting some much needed nerfing which most people agree with, I even went out of my way to make it so that fair killers can use them more often so only the most toxic douchebags get shafted by this suggestion &gt; 14% upvoted. The bet is still open if you think that my suggestion would get upvoted if I wasn't such a meanie person.
---
Yeah those things are scummy tunneling and camping. Sure you'll be able to find some grey areas that you can't just punish people for so we don't or we figure it out along the way. Also it's not a real "punishment" anyways, you can't use ebony mori for slightly longer than you could've normally, wow huge deal. Anyone who plays fair consistently and anyone who plays like an ass consistently will notice that those small grey area incidents aren't a huge factor for them. I don't know I still like the idea but I'm willing to admit it would never be perfect.
---
"They're just really good friends :)"
---
Personally I'm not interested in ranking up never have never will. I'm playing to have fun and most my games i farm and let them escape when someone DC early and if i kill all with 3 gens left i give the hatch but this game wasn't competitive or interesting as you can see all the chases doesn't last that long and on top of that I'm not good with huntress so that says something about them, so i decided to end the game and they can collect BP and rank up if they want on the next game instead of wasting everyones time by dragging it more
---
do got to admit that is true when it comes to spirit that the killer does not really need to be good at mind gaming but just stand still so the other person has to guess
---
If you're saying it's difficult to use Balanced on the specific map called "The Game" that's actually probably it's second strongest map other than Haddonfield.  You can proc it on every staircase as well as two of the vault spots.
---
That‚Äôs totally me

A good group of survivors have a very high chance of winning, especially since a lot of maps are typically survivor sided. There's nothing more frustrating than trying to just enjoy a survivor game, but nearly every game results in getting tunneled immediately, or teammates quitting for no reason mid match. Both of those things have to be addressed sooner rather than later otherwise we're going to keep losing our survivor playerbase.
---
Nah, deadass. Killer que times are ungodly
---
This dude is trolling. He's intentionally spelling wrong it's obvious.
---
nope
---
Body block is mostly just free hits most of the time... Unless you are stupid and miss the hits lol
---
You actually framed your counterargument pretty well.  I can understand the thought process behind it. Just getting it over with so everyone can queue to a better game.
---
Oh, sorry! I misremembered. Maybe someone could hop into a KYF and post it?
---
Spirit is Best Girl
---
Which page are you using? The site I used must be out of date...
---
&gt; Zubatlel on YouTube is ridiculous when it comes to those
---
No, he's not. He just does it 10 times a game so you're bound to hit one.
---
So I'm assuming that you don't have much of a life.
---
Mad Grit.
---
I mean it smokes
---
The fact i see people do this all the time in red ranks drives me nuts. The killer will be standing 5 feet from them hit them, and theyll continue to try to flashlight.
---
I honestly think its burnout plus dealing with the sniper dudes he's had to deal with recently compounding said burnout.
---
It could be do to the stream sniper that has been sniping him for 13+ days.
---
Along with him facing toxic people alot more recently
---
I think hes being funny and making the point that ranking up for killers is undeniably easier than it is for survivors
---
I‚Äôve prestige‚Äôs him to 3 LvL 50. He has a VERY. VERY high skill cap. Arguably harder than the nurse if you wanna use his power properly. You have to not only manage to not get spotted in order to get a stalk off, you also have to manage your time well enough because his map pressure is garbage. 
---
Don‚Äôt bother with his stalk boosting addons, just lean stalk. It‚Äôs already 2x faster (Better than any addon will get you). Focus on power recovery, reveal reducing, and crouch speed.
---
1. Ruin is a must. 
---
2. No-Ed
---
3.Bamboozle is recommended
---
4.BBQ, Whispers, Tremors, or Surveillance
---
What a dickhead
---
Correct, lied to us.
---
There has to be a spark in there
---
This is a lip sync, we need to see your lips.
---
it takes time to charge up their one hits.  
---
Meyers in tier 3 is very good, but it takes a lot of time to get there.  Hillbilly and Leatherface have to charge their saws for 2 or 3 seconds, so it's pretty easy to counter in a chase
---
These are all my complaints as well. She's so anti-fun, which sucks because she's one of BHVRs best designs.
---
why is mettle of man bad now? what made it so good?
---
only idiots play on pc lol ps4 ftw
---
so I mean is it not insane that he can hit at least one of those 10 when most people will never hit a blind hatchet throw?
---
‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôm in the cornfield.‚Äù That‚Äôs me telling them where I am lmao.
---
trapper is weak, the only thing that helped me was early game snowball with 2 good traps and alot of slugging, 1 got 1 other trap that they instantly got out of aswell, its all about building pressure by slugging for lower tier killers
---
Oh shit my b
---
Just close out your game mid loading screen
---
Yea sorry, I did this at like 2:00 in the morning and I was just going off memory
---
That guy is definitely going to report you
---
The script wasnt great, but jackie was a solid freddy and id love it if he came back in the future
---
*"Why would you say something so controversial, yet so brave?"*
---
I just liked it how dare they break that number :'(
---
leatherface is actually really good tf
---
Ambush is great, it'll help you stop loops if you learn it and sync with it well enough. RBT are great in combo with a hex because then survivors will have three objectives to focus on which buys time. I've played pig most out of killers and I think she's pretty viable, especially since they buffed her crouch speed by just a lil bit at 3.10
---
This is a mess...
---
Calling for Michael to fix his problems.
---
If you have to charge a full chainsaw, it‚Äôs just faster to break the pallet normally.
---
What's a good build for Legion and do you guys think the devs should buff him/her?  I'm struggling to keep any real threat to survivors with Legion and I know they "reworked" them before but maybe too harshly?  Thoughts?
---
Luck??? Nah man all skill, I see you.
---
This is true. Started playing and played him cause of BBQ. Now got the teachable and playing Hag. Every game 3-4k now. With Leatherface that was a rarity.
---
The sad part is that the AMA had so much potential to address many actual critical issues. Yet the sub uses it as a platform to ask some of the dumbest questions possible. 
---
I saw plenty of excellent questions in there being downvoted because apparently, people don't want them fixed.
---
üò¢ relatable
---
ok but that doesn't mean anything
---
2 borrowed time for sabo build. Why?
---
This is the first time I'm finally seeing reddit show signs that they know Spirit is like a "not as bad" Legion pre-nerf
---
I thought I was alone
---
Me: ‚ÄúRuin is by the shack‚Äù 
---
Swf: ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the shack?‚Äù
---
Me: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the uh big blue fucking thing. In one of the corners‚Äù
---
*5 fucking minutes later*
---
Swf: ‚ÄúSo where‚Äôs the gen?‚Äù
---
*me instantly dc-ing and realizing this is why I play solo* lol sorry I know that comes off rude I don‚Äôt actually dc I‚Äôll just wait until the game is over and go play solo. One of the many reasons I almost only solo que. synergy between randoms can be so much better than with swf and some killers need to understand this. I think for some people the sense of security that swf gives them causes them to lack awareness or something lol idk but it gets on my nerves.
---
How does it not? You were saying that the post did not exist after the other user said you reposted. You really gotta hide yourself... even the mod deleted it for being a repost
---
I have a spark for the clown tho
---
my friends and I always yell im dead even if it is first hook lol
---
now that is what i was lo0king 4
---
Just break his ankles goddamn
---
Mettle was OP before because you got stacks on taking normal
---
Hits and after getting hit three times, the 4th hit from injured to downed was ignored. What made it so powerful was the ‚Äútank‚Äù builds people were doing where they would try to heal mid chase with either insta heals or just staying at 99% healed because the closer you got to end game, the more difficult everyone became to down just because having to add in an extra hit to downing anyone as most killers was just annoying for majority of the killer cast. People were really playing Huntress Plague more and Nurse/Billy were even more played. 
---
Killers who didn‚Äôt have alternate forms of damage had much rougher games because of old mom.
---
A lot of the comments thus far are accurate but there‚Äôs also just the way this subreddit and the forums have been over a longer period of time. For a bit now he‚Äôs been getting a lot of undeserved hate and it could be weighing on him too. It sucks cause I know in his position I‚Äôd be taking it a lot worse.
---
Mettle of Man used to give the player a free hit without going in to the dying state if they had been hit 3 times previously with a regular attack (hatchets, chainsaws, etc didn't count). If an entire team was running it (it was more common at red/purple ranks), it could have a big effect on the outcome of the match.
---
They recently change the perk where you have to take 3 Protection hits, which is a hit where you prevent the killer from hitting someone else. These kind of hits are more common when unhooking someone near the killer, or when blocking for someone near the exit gate. The issue with this is that people feel protection hits are buggy and don't register when they should. It's also difficult to get protection hits without the risk of farming someone off a hook.
---
It should be equal to a grab for the killer too!
---
Holy crap wtf
---
Right? It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm by the farming equipment‚Äù but there‚Äôs like multiple ones so it‚Äôs a coin toss.
---
weird flex but ok
---
Bruh, that's even if you get passed the matchmaking my dude
---
I keep seeing this color filter for perks and whatnot. Would someone share what it is?
---
I still like to look back on TydeTymes tier list and see that he put her in lower mid tier next to leatherface. Gives me a good laugh
---
Wow! What a play! Replayed it like 4 times!
---
Change "spirit" to "killer"
---
For me it‚Äôs more like, stop sandbagging you piece of shit! Or I‚Äôm gonna die IM GONNA DIE!
---
Lol low-key looks like that dbd employee with the glasses that everyone memes. Sorry I don‚Äôt know his name
---
IT HELPS VS DOCTOR
---
I would say stop being a bully but at this point I know your just gonna say something unrelated so
---
Bye
---
I know a bunch of people who would but I just don‚Äôt understand it. Out of respect I would have to stay.
---
So you ignore my statement, I wonder why. Bye.
---
I'm trying to get discordance on my freddy if the blood webs would cooperate (and I do have the teachable version).
---
10% is pretty good if you‚Äôre shooting from half court.
---
I have the same issue, playing Spirit is super irritating for me atm, since I start charging my power and randomly stop so I have to wait out the cd...
---
says who?
---
Oh you‚Äôre the meta-only guy
---
Why did the other Claudette just stand still and take the chainsaw to her face?
---
Dang didn't think people would hate that idea, sorry. What's would your killer concept be?
---
Yes and no, people would still loose to lag the player base would get better and the dc rate would sky rocket
---
Most of them lack pressure, and are very loopable.
---
Billy has plenty of pressure, which is why he is top 3.
---
Honestly I might start bringing kindred because low rank players are too braindead to see how good bond and empathy are...
---
Once again you‚Äôre not wrong lol. The learning curve isn‚Äôt high but it is difficult to master, consistently running a killer with a brain stem is not easy at all. By your logic anyone who knows how to run tiles and pallet loops is on no0b3‚Äôs level of skill. 
---
I can see by your profile you are a hard killer main, so I can understand why you‚Äôre biased against survivor.
---
Sloppy butcher is a good one
---
Rank 20‚Äôs are allowed to kill babies tho. Babies killing babies is fine
---
You shoukd replace noed with blood warden in this one
---
Yea streamers that pull off the multi genre experience naturally and organically come across much happier and overall more fulfilled with streaming for a career. They know their fans watch it for the streamer and won't leave if the game changes
---
I wouldn't expect people not to use stuff designed by the devs.
---
The question is why did the devs design such shit designs
---
So you have chosen....
---
To be moried
---
As far as im concerned juking isn't losing the killer, but rather finding creative ways to play him. I might not have the right interpretation of the word tho
---
It‚Äôs the new ultra rare add on. It also grants ability to Mori everyone before they‚Äôre hooked once.
---
Alright, thanks! :)
---
Yea but sometimes its harder to pull off, depending on your main game. One of the most extreme example is the mario maker streamers. If they try playing anything else, their viewers drop by like 90% lol
---
Hexy played other games recently like hide or die, or Hello neighbor, and still had plenty of viewers. But he carefully choose games his viewers will be interested in.
---
Spirit is literally nurse with no cool down
---
We're not shooting basketballs in real life, now are we? We're playing a video game that you can easily find the center of the screen so you can land your shots.
---
‚ÄúThe Ruin is by the barrel.‚Äù 
---
WHAT BARREL? There‚Äôs just as many barrels as hooks. ü§î
---
In terms of pure speed, just kick the pallet for faster results. However depending on the loop and if the survivor is sticking to it once the pallet down, you can bait a chainsaw attempt as you walk around the loop and just break it when you're near full charge.
---
If the survivor sticks around, suddenly they've lost a decent chunk of distance they could have otherwise gotten. And if they bolt, depending on the map you might be able to run them down with a chainsaw
---
Bitch wtf can you not read if you don't want to continue arguing over a simple post for no reason then bye but you better not continue stalking me and being an overall dickhead
---
the perks I use most for legion are save the best for last, thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, and for the last you could use pop to slow the game down even more or perk that helps you find survivors easier like discordance. With thanat and sloppy itll really take them a long time to heal wasting a lot of time for them and alongside with stbfl you can down survivors recover quickly and move on the someone else if they happen to be close. And for add ons I use anything that increases duration (stolen sketch book) and anything that increases the range of killer instinct (Susie's mixtape) detection range will help you know where everyone is if they're too far for you to reach in time. This build has helped me get to rank 2 this month
---
Wym
---
Since when has reddit had good observations
---
How am I stalking you? I‚Äôm reading each post and saw you contradict yourself to someone else. I‚Äôm being a dickhead for proving you wrong?
---
Yea, I see it on hybrid pandas YouTube. Any other games he uploads videos of have just a small fraction of the views, and it's unfortunate cause it makes him depressed
---
I'm about to get my BBQ &amp; Chili teachable, what teachable should I go for next? Billy's? I don't have Hag, RN, so I can feed her for Ruin.
---
I don't understand what you're trying to say in this message.
---
Sorry, should've added my usual perk setup
---
Ruin/BBQ/ Thana/Sloppy.
---
BBQ/Ruin/Spirit Fury/Enduring.
---
Neither one feels very good at slowing the game down but even more so the SF and Enduring build. Since the power doesn't really have any threat and doesn't have good add-ons, I feel I'm struggling to even make an impact or punish mistakes.
---
Invisible hatch, double speed boost, ghostface potatoeing
---
BBQ and 2 party streamers plus full bp
---
Good bye
---
Thantophobia, Bamboozle, BBQ and hex:ruin
---
you could run discordance instead of BBQ if you don't have it. and Sloppy butcher instead of Ruin.
---
bamboozle increases vaulting speed for pallets and windows, but only use it at tier 3 to increase window block timer.
---
My problem with Tru3 is that when he plays killer he makes bad reads, stupid mistakes, and greedy plays and then blames the game. The game is still survivor sided, but most of the shit he loses to is his own fault, and it irritates me.
---
What does "M1", "P3", and other terms similar to those mean?
---
Same man
---
Yeah that hatch was weird
---
As a killer main this is why I'm not worried about SWF groups. Most people aren't super-intelligent tactical geniuses who know every map like the back of their hand.
---
Thanks! I'll try this out, I never paid too much mind to the KI range increase ones but just knowing where survivors are is a huge deal so I'll give them a go.
---
Good cos that op shit has to go, idk how they're only green smh suck bad devs
---
Anyone else getting the glitch where deadhard gives you the cooldown but it doesn‚Äôt go off? 
---
Like you don‚Äôt dash forward, and you don‚Äôt dodge a hit. It only happens randomly, but I feel like I can‚Äôt be alone in this.
---
if you removed the censor of joy it would‚Äôve been the other way around for me
---
Instead of breaking pallets, I vault them and then come back later to get them
---
I'm absolutely horrible with the flashlight. I never seem to time it right and end up getting mangled.
---
Yeah, with modded perks and what looks like Discord on the bottom right..?
---
Had a bad case of this last night. I helplessly watched from my hook as the entire team made their way over to me. The Trapper was still nearby since they had just hooked me a moment ago, so they came back when they clearly noticed everyone else was around and got easy downs.  
---
It was a horrible game overall, largely because of that play. Two survivors disconnected after that, one of which stuck around post-game to trash talk the killer for "camping." Shocking, right?
---
Thank you, I'll also try this one out.  Bamboozle seemed silly to me because we already vault but after being at rank 2-3 this month, having it block off windows will actually be a huge help.
---
I'm pretty sure m1 means left mouse click, which would be attack for a killer. Looked up p3 and mainly got that it means prestige 3.
---
Okay I meant to put this as a shitpost how do I edit on mobile
---
Me, when I join a SWF group:
---
For the love of GOD, STOP HIDING NEXT TO THE EXIT GATE! WE HAVE THREE GENS LEFT!
---
This is good
---
Why do I not get my blood points if the killer dc‚Äôs mid March?
---
It's because their priest raped them. That was revenge!
---
Makes sense
---
When DBD came out i was an huge fan and played it for like a year. But then i took a much needed break of like 2 years lol
---
Almost any games gets boring when you mass play it for a full year
---
I used to do that but being at rank 2-3, if I'm in FF and do that they just sit at the pallet and I either hit them in FF and go on CD and they run to a new loop or I cancel early and they just continue the loop on the pallet until I inevitably break it.
---
if you count fire then ye
---
I‚Äôve had the exact same thing happen to me twice today. Even brought a BPS and still got zero points. I‚Äôm quite annoyed.. idk if it‚Äôs the killer doing something or if it‚Äôs a bug.
---
This was a really thought out explanation thanks for that
---
The doctor IS my spark ‚ù§
---
Maybe "can't see survivors", but completely blind is too much.
---
Wholesome. I gib 10/10
---
You absolute god
---
bless this baby boy very Good
---
Nurse isn't that hard after a while though. At some point it becomes as easy as breathing.
---
\*really fricking angry oink\*
---
some survivors try to become noob3, and do the window trick(crouch at window and vault back inside after the killer vaults it) so it will usually get you a free hit.
---
First of all, thank you for the extremely well written and thoughtful response. 
---
Im a huge Saw fan. So im certain ill enjoy the references. Saw 6 is easily my favorite. The Shotgun Carousel is so sinister and brutal, makes me shiver.
---
However, you analyse does open my eyes on some concerns i did originally have before.
---
I wasn't sure how her crouching and ambush worked exactly and i would've most definitely tired using her like Ghostface.
---
Im going to get her since she seems to be really fun to play. I admit theres times playing Ghostface isn't just fun even if i get 4ks. 
---
My playstyle favors stealthy characters so im hoping the transition isnt to extreme
---
I can't even remember the last time I used a Mori.
---
Why don‚Äôt you run ruin?
---
The exit gate powering audio would‚Äôve been perfect omg
---
I feel like the blocking totems could potentially be too op
---
Oh? You're approaching me?
---
Try to get out of tier 1 as fast as possible. Stalk a lot and don't be afraid to lose a few chases because of your reduced speed while stalking. In fact, if you know how to use Play With Your Food properly, letting survivors get away from chases at the early game will make your job significantly easier later.
---
Once you reach tier 2, keep charging EW, but don't fully charge it. Leave it at around 90-ish% charge so you can immediately pop it when you happen to need it (prime opportunity to do so is when there are multiple survivors close by). 
---
If someone drops a pallet on you and doesn't immediately run away from it (instead he sits at the other end and tbags you or has his flashlight ready to blind you), don't break it instantly. Instead, take the opportunity to charge EW even more and stalk his obnoxious ass as much as possible before breaking the pallet and continuing the chase.
---
For the most part, Myers is a fairly straightforward killer, and you shouldn't really have much trouble to do well if you follow the above tips. When it comes to perks and addons, i can't really help you much. I played him quite a bit so far, but since i was aiming for the adept, i never used anything other than his unique perks (which aren't bad, but aren't great either). I suppose Ruin/BBQ/Monstrous Strength/Save the Best for Last would be a pretty solid build, and you can go from there.
---
Probably the demogorgon from stranger things (they did a deal with BHVR and we have no clue on what it is so it's a guess) or some people have been saying Pinhead which is also likely but the one I'm hoping for is Harry Warden from My bloody valentine.
---
It‚Äôs by the gen at the side next to the killers power stuff!
---
Who's arguing?
---
"we're over here by the log pile"
---
Dude, there's two, which one?
---
"Idk were in a corner"
---
THEYRE BOTH IN CORNERS WHAT ELSE DO YOU SEE?! 
---
"Uuuuuh...the killer?"
---
Wdym? That‚Äôs potato salad
---
No interest in cheating in a game I haven't even played yet. Not sure how well cheating would go down at a LAN with mates :).
---
Not in the newest reboot
---
Still toxic, but not as bad as the earlier days
---
well one thing for sure is that he got at least 4 killsü§î
---
he gets religously stream sniped alot so makes sense he not happy still like his stream tho
---
Scratch marks to mislead him too, well played.
---
I main the doctor. I also play Billy, sometimes trapper, and rarely play wraith. If I get ghostface, legion, or myers. I might play them more.
---
maybe its cos 
---
A:the killer is near you
---
B:you are too far away
---
C:cos of the way you played in game
---
D:cos ur acting like a baby
---
maybe before you post something after a single person wrongs you in a game you think ‚Äòwill people care‚Äô, ‚Äòwill it help in anyway‚Äô, ‚Äòdoes it even matter‚Äô and ‚Äòam i being a bit overreactive‚Äô
---
Like i‚Äôd understand if you were complaining about game design but over something non-existent? no
---
I'm glad I posted here, I've never used Reddit before but asking this question has really opened my eyes to some of the interesting combos you guys have found.  Personally, I've never been a huge fan of rank so I typically go for BPs.  So naturally I closed my mind off to other things if it didn't include kills and BBQ.  Boy have o been missing out.  Thank you for the idea, I'll be sure to test this one out!
---
Yeah I saw the Netflix tweets between them, I think there‚Äôs a good possibility for this, I was more curious on when you guys think they‚Äôd reveal some info about it.
---
I mean we can guess September it releases based on their schedule but do t we usually get some info like a few weeks in advance along with a PTB?
---
Or better yet from this morning with my sef "I'm on a gen by the uhh, big yellow thingy"
---
The bus? "No, no it has a claw thing on it" the crane??? "Yeah the yellow claw thingy"
---
Evil zappy boi
---
#*Big Brain Time*
---
Pressing the power button
---
Depends on what you don‚Äôt have I guess. Enduring, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Discordance, Spirit Fury (Get Enduring first tho), Bamboozle, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Ruin are amongst the strongest perks you can get from killer teachables
---
jfc this is terrifying delete this now
---
I will say though, a Bubba with Play With Your Food has potential to be a God.
---
How would that make removing dull totems pointless? It would make it mandatory if anything. 
---
More end game totem perks that encouraged people to remove dull totems could work too but even the issue of solo players being unable to cleanse all 5 by themselves isn't the only issue with noed. A perk really shouldn't reward you that much for failing the primary objective of the killer.
---
I actually disagree, I think ranking up as survivor is just as easy. Doing 1 gen, unhooking and healing 1 survivor and then running the killer until you die will give you a pip until you reach purple ranks. You just can't play immersed, hide all game and do nothing but gens and then be surprised you only black pipped. The emblem system just doesn't work that way.
---
Aren't you supposed to put controversial opinions on this ?
---
very violent ass-ripping gay sex on a generator
---
+hatch closing +franklins
---
lowkey fax
---
It should be giving you your blood points, but it can be glitchy. Sometimes I get the 5k points for escaping when they DC and sometimes I don‚Äôt ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
exactly, moris tho
---
What does p3 claudette mean?
---
Call Lauri Strode
---
Yeah it‚Äôs happened to me as well. I‚Äôm done using dead hard until it‚Äôs patched.
---
‚Ä¢So if the killer is near someone, I should let them die?
---
‚Ä¢I was on 2nd hook and they took the hatch which was right beside where I was hooked.
---
‚Ä¢I played like everyone else, so if I play 
---
badly I‚Äôll survive by what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Is this how they pull him into the real world to beat him?
---
I kind of like moris depending on the killer cause the animation can be cool haha but it does offend me occasionally depending on the match üòÇ
---
Well, have fun playing with 3 potato team mates it you do solo queue
---
no mither is basically a direct upgrade to iron will
---
Tell that bitch she owes me an eye
---
That would be the most sold chapter few hours after the release.
---
Quentin and GF are BF
---
1: Yes unless you have borrowed time
---
2: I‚Äôm calling your bluff
---
3: Option D
---
If he camps, gen rush his ass.
---
Then get better.
---
i can understand wanting people to be nicer in post chat and wanting people to not camp, but if i want to absolutely explode people with a mori i dont see the issue
---
Camping is a tactic. Not fun. But at the end of the day, sometimes just works out for the killer. Just let it go
---
Yeah we tried but it was me and a friend and then 2 fills and they kept trying to get each other it was a mess lol.
---
They deserved it! HAHA!
---
They'd probably "accidentally" leak it like they did with Ash and Ghostface a month before or release information about it at the middle or end of this month then release the trailer and PTB
---
- killer camps
---
- survivors rushes killer whos camping
---
- dies
---
"WHAT THE HELL DUDE MFG"
---
Lol I wasn‚Äôt holding on to anything üòÇ he messaged us
---
Yeah I noticed that too.  I guess the viewers don't really care about the streamer just the game.
---
The concept has been used plenty of times and doesn‚Äôt work. Look at any other Thing killer concept, you‚Äôll see why
---
I just wanna know what amanda is about to do
---
Bitch you get the fuck out of here. Eat my entire ass. Take your fucking stupid ass emojis and fuck off. You want me to whip out my Perfect Grammar ‚Ñ¢ Cock? Okay, you got it. Now, please refrain from using those awful emojis. It would be VERY  much appreciated. Thank you so much. Now, you go and have yourself an amazing day/night.
---
Speaking of that actually does anybody have a killer recommendation for me to main. I would do pig but I don't have her
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ bitch saltyyyy hahaha foh
---
all this does is make the killer stand there
---
Billy has a decently large terror radius, what are you on about
---
He's the only killer that actively rewards you for *truer* mindgames than any other killer, since that chainsaw is a hefty risk he's taking to try and use at most points and will only slow his ass down if the survivor uses it against him.
---
Matches against billy's not using "no fun allowed" perks (that i listed) are my favorite by far. Tiles get more mileage, you're on the edge of your seat, you can make Billy feel like a dumbass without flat out bullying him
---
Idk, I'll take Billy literally every match till kingdom come if it meant I didn't have to play against Trapper or Spirit.
---
Hey, my bad dude just thought I'd put my two cents on it maybe if enough people talk about it, it'll happen idk.
---
Oh and... no üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
"MAN ITS NOT FAIR SURVIVORS KEEP DOING GENS I WANT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF"
---
‚ÄúYou are really gonna camp like that? Even though another survivor unhooked me two seconds after you hooked me?‚Äù
---
Always pullin a sneaky, I didn't even see her at first glance. I'm downed and on the hook now.
---
Yes why did you run when he didn't even see you and waste your sprint burst?
---
The flashlight only stuns if the killer is carrying someone and you actually manage the blind. Otherwise it just blind the killer screen, you have to do it when they are stuck in animation, otherwise they can just look up and smack you.

Sometimes I depip when a killer DCs mid game. Nothing like losing a rank because someone disconnects. Fun fun fun
---
Though the stalk process takes a bit longer, Myers and his tiers offer more bonuses and perks (such as increased vault speed and lunge distance) and the ability to use his power regardless of whether he‚Äôs been seen or not. 
---
Myers is a wolf, able to put his prey down effectively head on.
---
Ghostface is a Jaguar. He‚Äôs deadly, but he can‚Äôt take his prey head on.
---
How about you add a rule so you don‚Äôt camp and be an asshole
---
feel free to pick apart the idea's i've had and add your own dude cause it might actually come together nicely
---
Just win lol
---
No it‚Äôs that they leave me to die.
---
Thanks pal
---
r/antimeme
---
Ah, the poor bugger doesn‚Äôt even know....
---
I would reccomend meg (for adrenaline and sprint burst) or nea (for balanced landing, or urban evasion if that is your playstyle). If you are willing to spend some money I would go for laurie strode (object of obsession and decisive strike are nice perks once you get a little better at the game).
---
If you want to farm bloodpoints easier I would recommend getting the free DLC that gives you David king and the huntress. David's perk we're gonna live forever allows you to get up to 100 percent extra bloodpoints and gives incentive for altruistic actions.
---
Wtf r u on about
---
pair this with calm spirit and see how confused and annoyed doctor gets
---
couldve at least let him hit you smh
---
Maybe it's a technical glitch on there end.
---
Don‚Äôt mean to sound dumb but what is SWF?
---
‚ÄúThe survivor‚Äôs rule book for killers‚Äù
---
The teachables will appear in order until you unlock them. If you don‚Äôt take Third Seal at Bloodweb 30, it‚Äôll be there at 31. So on and so forth
---
Which two are megs better teachables? 
---
Adrenaline seems pretty lame bc as soon as the gates are powered it‚Äôs pretty much gg. Plus it‚Äôs wasted 95% of the trial
---
Sprint is cool, is it activated by the user? Or certain criteria, it doesn‚Äôt say. 
---
And quick and quiet is meh.
---
Cause of the summer outfits?
---
Was [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cf5fsx/first_time_playing_against_the_pig_we_were_so/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) you?
---
Maybe someone else playing on the account.
---
Nah screw that I‚Äôm with the killers rulebook for survivors
---
Maybe but we don‚Äôt what caused or how to fix it.
---
Maybe if this thread wasn't directly related to this killer.....
---
Angry survivor main pretending to be a killer. Downvote and move on.
---
I play on Ps4
---
https://youtu.be/mz296Izw-S8

---
I meant that from the killers point of view.  Them "being nice" is letting you escape.  Especially in yellow ranks being overly altruistic is a death wish, you cant expect to make it out every match.
---
You can leave it be, but you can't get devour if you haven't unlocked at least one (btw if you keep third seal locked, it will appear in each bloodweb, reducing your perk choices to 1)
---
I‚Äôll probably do David first just for we‚Äôre gonna live forever, but to clarify, the perk says each safe hook rescue you get 25% more stackable up to 50% not 100% correct?
---
What are your main survivor perks? I always thinks it‚Äôs interesting to hear what other people run.
---
bc it takes half a second and you dont detriment in any way
---
It's just a joke, people thought that legion would work like that but they just made him run fast
---
Also my killer Idea is my only post
---
i'm not proud to admit it, but yes. matter of fact at least a few times a night for me.
---
If I could lock myself into rank 10 or 11 I‚Äôd be happy. I don‚Äôt need to be 15 and bully killers, but I don‚Äôt wanna dip into purple ranks and stop having fun.
---
Well yeah because if you don't bring any hexes that involve dull totems then there shouldn't be a reason besides 1000 BP to cleanse dull totems.
---
I was talking about Amanda getting sneaky on u haha
---
I like to be a sneaky sneak so I run urban evasion, spine chill, balanced landing, adrenaline/self care
---
At level 1, you can only get up to 50 percent stackable. But at level 3 you can get 100 percent.
---
Lmao then yes. I was confused cause as killer I main Amanda
---
I've only recently started using iron will, it is INSANELY underrated.
---
I would only care about hitting gold each season for the victorious skin. But then I realized I only really like one character
---
Not for me!
---
Private messaging exists. I get a ton of salt as a PS4 Killer main.
---
Adrenaline is actually better than it leads on. It allows you to pump out the last 1-2 gens without wasting time healing, or it can pop mid chase to save you, or while you are hooked giving you a much better chance at escaping after your unhook. 
---
Sprint Burst activates automatically when you sprint if you don‚Äôt have exhaustion. It isn‚Äôt the best exhaustion perk, but it gives you a head start to a loop when you‚Äôre caught working on a gen and gives you a much better chance at getting away after an unhook.
---
Quick &amp; Quiet is only situationally good for locker jukes and window mind games, but it is way better than the other bad perks survivors have.
---
Same lol
---
The problem is you would have no chance regardless.
---
You're the last survivor, the killer knows that. If the game were patched allowing you the opportunity to get off the hook, guess what every killer does? Stand right next to the hook until game ends. Even if you get off the hook, it's instant down.
---
Okay, I appreciate the advice and shall try it next time I go up against them :)
---
Bt is one of those perks where it's just good to have for late game moments and it guarantees a safe unhook emblem wise. It's better to have it and not need it but that's just me.
---
I'm gonna do that I'm at level 34 with him and want brutal strength but not unnerving presence (or is it overwhelming I always get them mixed up) contaminating my bloodwebs
---
I assume you only watch his highlight videos on youtube. I used to watch him stream, I saw all his games, not only the ones he wants to show people.
---
Yah my bubba still sitting at 40 he was worth the $5.00 he alone has paid for himself and I thank him for it! But if your in the purple ranks or higher bubba isn‚Äôt that good anymore and will get shit on and steamrolled by a good team or even half ass potato‚Äôs... Shirtless Myers gets them every time!
---
They did and I can‚Äôt wait!
---
My only concern is, what does it look like at the start of the game? We don‚Äôt know the things true form
---
I meant ridiculously small considering how quickly he can be on top of you. I think it should definitely be larger than it currently is.
---
Most of the ones i face will usually just have it perma-revved and always ready to cap your ass the moment you turn into an even slightly straight part while you are trying to loop them. Plus it can completely negate pallets and is on a ridiculously small cooldown, so i wouldn't go as far as to call it a "hefty risk". Like, yeah, if he manages to miss, the survivor might be able to get some distance, but i dont think he will completely lose him.
---
If you feel like you are having fun against him, power to you, but i legit can't. I'm also really interested to know why you feel Trapper is unfun to play against. I get that most of them will usually bring Ruin and NoED, and that is definitely unfun, but as a whole, Trapper is significantly hard to do well with, and experienced survivors will have no problems bullying him by defusing his traps and genrushing him.
---
Does it do it on any other game? If not maybe uninstall the game and reinstall it.
---
Bubba can be good against altruistic potatoes.
---
It‚Äôs not the game it‚Äôs the party chat system that won‚Äôt work.
---
I think that's how everyone communicates, at least thats definitely how my friend and I communicate.
---
Any secrets? I just couldn‚Äôt get him to work for me after playing him for for 2 weeks and went back to Myers, I kept getting my ass kicked by rank 4-6 players but Myers put a stop to that...
---
Id say it depends on what kind of toolbox/Medkit youd bring
---
I consider basement camping a legitimate strategy as Leatherface, believe it or not.
---
Fuck
---
no one on earth thinks iron will is underrated
---
Nice repost
---
How am I stupid, you absolute baboon
---
Won‚Äôt work from what someone else said and I‚Äôd trust them more
---
So would you recommend trying it instead of adrenalin because all 3 quick and quiet, bl and self care saved me definitely dozens of more times more than adrenalin
---
I literally made this earlier
---
All this does is make the killer wait longer in a game he's already won.
---
Because you posted a moronic comment with absolutely no basis in reality, for apparently no reason.
---
Get a life, you cretin.
---
I played a little when the game was free on PS+ but haven't really touched it since.  I'd love to get back into it, but has the skill level online gotten too high?
---
I would prefer to play as killer, but I always used to get looped and not know the maps and really would just get destroyed every time.  It took so long to get the bloodpoints just to piss them away as well.
---
I see his stream a lot of times actually and my opinion is the same.
---
round starts
---
they see it's the blind
---
4 men start operation noise fast vaulting and downing pallets everywhere
---
Freddy makes sparks with his locker grab
---
I didn't spent $5 on Leatherface, I spent $5 on Barbeque.
---
Shake his hand and wish him a happy trial
---
*WAKE ME UP! WAKE ME UP INSIDE!*
---
We need more survivors like you
---
BTW I am rank 17 not 16.
---
I get that...just seems like absolutely no fun to pick on lower ranks. Everyone's different, I get it, but that just seems like absolutely no fun at all. Just my opinion.
---
"AUGH!"
---
I recently saw a video of a priest using a censer for the bottlecap challenge. This is also good Plagueposting.
---
That‚Äôs just how I feel about OoO regardless
---
Wtf are you talking about? Why would I be salty? Over what? I-
---
Oh I‚Äôm reading the level 1 of adrenaline and it says it‚Äôs only activated after the exit gates are powered? Is the lvl 3 different? If so you have changed my mind lol
---
I took of my build and replaced ot with Bond + kindred + Dead hard + Spine chill, that's the first time in 200 hours that I had fun as a solo survivor, got hit by two noeds and didn't even got mad
---
^^^
---
Wow. That helped me so much... thank you so much. I‚Äôm shaking.
---
You got a 3k, don‚Äôt see the issue
---
Even if it doesn't glow, it goes.
---
When you pick Legion on the menu
---
I'd personally go 15 minutes for the first and an hour for the 2nd. 15 then 30 for two DC's that fast is way too lenient. It resets every day so it's not like it's a huge deal if your internet just happens to be crapping out.
---
ur coment is not funny, i didnt laught, and its actually not hard to do it, loser! git gud! 
---
5th legion's gonna cum on u!
---
dead ?
---
I have to agree. When I play killer I'm not able to relax. I play survivor probably 80% of the time, and during that I rarely get to relax either. Only time I relax is when I'm on a gen while the killer is face camping. Only time ever. (Which isn't often, usually I'm the one being face camped because I play as Pink hat Claudette/Kate.)
---
Tbh even a really fucking good Bubba that completly outplays survivors will probably lose to a strong red ranks SWF team that knows how to gen rush and coordinate the tasks.
---
Well only tier 3 is worth it
---
Balanced landing (its like a couple extra pallets/windows on each level), Adrenaline (the strongest endgame perk on the survivor side), and stakeout (the best counter to Ruin in the game today)
---
I just restarted to play as killer, this is the first game I get, yea not that bad but it was so extremely toxic...
---
Damn i didn't face a Doc for such a long time ! completely forgot about him.
---
Yeah, next rank reset I‚Äôm not planning to go higher than purple until maybe rank rewards are added.
---
also not funny and i also didnt laugh
---
Can‚Äôt wait :D Very very bored of red ranks now lol
---
ur not a good example of being a good human being, fuck you u coffe penis.
---
ok i dont know if this is happening for anybody else but my daily challenges just seem to vanish. i know what it will be (most recently unhook as jake), i play as meg and then after the game the challenge is gone. any idea if this is a bug or how to fix it?
---
Yah I think the devs did that on purpose so friends playing together wouldn‚Äôt be able to landmark anything to give them more of a advantage. Out of my years of gaming mostly with online shooters, landmarks or nicknames was that big ace in the hole to get guys in spots when you needed them and everyone would know which one you are talking about. But with this game it‚Äôs like walking thru a maze at times.
---
Memes are love, memes are life
---
I actually ran bond, like I said, and my problem with it is that I don't know if it's my luck or what not but almost none of my teammates actually know when to heal and when not, that's why I switched to self care for the time being in the green ranks
---
I recently finally started leveling Nea, and she‚Äôs the only survivor I got Iron Will to 3rd level. I absolutely love losing the killer in a chase because they can‚Äôt hear me, or just plain doing generators while injured without too much worry for getting caught (besides just plain sucking.)
---
Ruin, chili, Franklin's demise and pop goes the weasel(use it every time possible, even delay chases). You could sub out Franklin but many players will come back for their item. which is like a lure.
---
I've knocked several items out of players hand then feinted going after someone else only to come back for them and down them.
---
Makes sense to me
---
exactly
---
**don't let your memes be dreams**
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm gonna try that build tonight
---
That's not toxic.
---
Honestly I still instinctively do this sometimes even though its never worked once. I guess I just get desperate to try to defend myself in any way.
---
Girl get the hell out of here jeSUs christ üòÇ all extra annoying.
---
It's a terrific perk, unless you're being followed by your trail of blood.
---
Which one? There are 2 of them? Lol I wish they would tag shit in the game to pinpoint spots, Nea needs tot get to work tagging shit!
---
Lord of the rings had nothing on this epic tale.
---
I'm glad everything worked out
---
That‚Äôs an SWF lobby, it‚Äôs very hard to balance low and high ranks in the same group, so they very well could have gotten a rank 8 killer and the survivors would have had the same experience ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Not many killers perform well at high ranks, and thats because of poor design- of either the killer or map. If more killers could hold their own against good surviviors I'm sure we'd see more variety. But with how much people complain about Nurse and Spirit I doubt the devs are going to buff any of the killers we have now
---
Let the body‚Äôs hit the floor
---
Please yes
---
Yes, the devs are definitely part of the problem!
---
I'm aware that some people only have fun when they have a high chance of killing everyone - which is perfectly fine - and therefore grab the strongest killers.
---
If the devs would get all the killers to approximately the same level of power it'd solve lots of issues in the matter of variety.
---
Though, it feels like some people see every other killer than Spirit, Nurse and Hillbilly as entirely useless in high ranks, which isn't correct (in my opinion).
---
And that's a damn shame.
---

Yes. He's fun to play as or against right now, he's better/more viable than before. He's still not "top tier" but you can do well with him.
---
Flashlights aren‚Äôt toxic. It‚Äôs one of only a few ways to defend from the killer. It‚Äôs a tool. And how is he aggressive towards a literal killer who can 2 hit him and then camp? I don‚Äôt like camping personally but if you play like a douche you deserve it. Toxicity works both ways.
---
Then stop replying. *Laughing emoji*
---
not gonna lie the reboot wasn't a good movie at all but they made Freddy one creepy bastard
---
Sprays would be really cool. Though I'm sure everyone will just start tagging their friend whose currently downed or being mori'd
---
Well, that's a fact, but it doesn't change the fact that it's boring as hell!
---
My other teammates survived at least haha
---
swf isn't an issue until red rank where all the competitive swf obviously are. 
---
But here again since as soon as they reach rank 7 everyone and their mother play rank A or S Killers both sides get what they derserve‚Ä¶
---
And solo players are like‚Ä¶ fuck that shit i'm out
---
No, but I wish I was
---
Tfw bond
---
haha I always love doing that
---
Here's my two cents.
---
When some Billy or LF is right behind you and there are no safe windows or pallets in sight, find something like a crate or stacked tyres (something with a small but decent hitbox) and run around it. For LF, that increases the chances he bumps into it and gets stunned because his chainsaw hits in a wide arc. And for Hillbilly because he needs to have a straight line from himself to you to hit you, so by looping something so round and small he just might miss you.
---
But keep in mind every killer can M1 to death either way. Chainsaws aren't the only thing to avoid.
---
If you're in the husk's terror radius, no.
---
They don‚Äôt
---
the fuck I didn't know that was possible
---
&gt; I meant ridiculously small considering how quickly he can be on top of you
---
You can hear him coming from a mile away though- you know when he's chainsawing and he's quite tall/ easy to spot
---
&gt;Most of the ones i face will usually just have it perma-revved
---
It slows them down though; you can run around a small cluster of trees and Billy is incapacitated. Get to corners quickly when they start revving, and they literally can't catch up due to how slow they are.
---
&gt;Plus it can completely negate pallets
---
Don't drop the pallet then; just keep running. This is actually how you mindgame then; good Billy's rev only up to 5% next to pallets on survivors they haven't gauged behaviour of, so they can bait them into skipping pallet and get a free hit (or sometimes chainsaw) in after catching up the short distance
---
&gt;and is on a ridiculously small cooldown
---
Add-ons are a different story
---
&gt;so i wouldn't go as far as to call it a "hefty risk". Like, yeah, if he manages to miss, the survivor might be able to get some distance, but i dont think he will completely lose him.
---
Winning a chase isn't about losing the killer, it's about wasting their time. If you can stall out the Billy this way like 5 times in a row, that's like a full gen finished by combined effort of teammates.
---
&gt; I'm also really interested to know why you feel Trapper is unfun to play against
---
From survivor perspective, what you have to work with is totally RNG. Oh, thought you could try and loop the killer at a certain tile you didn't get the chance to check? Go fuck yourself :)
---
Chases are *fun* on both sides of the coin, and Trapper's mechanic shits on that premise. Maps are more often than not barren with how quickly moron teammates use up pallets and how nerfed survivor has gotten every patch- so what you have to work with is equivalent to pennies.
---
&gt;I get that most of them will usually bring Ruin and NoED, and that is definitely unfun
---
I mean, I don't mind those perks
---
Just hit skillchecks/ work through ruin and leave games against Trapper when NOED is proc'd. Sticking around on a *trapped* map with no pallets (endgame has no pallets left) is suicide.
---
&gt;and experienced survivors will have no problems bullying him by defusing his traps and genrushing him.
---
He's a coinflip killer to play. Either really easy or really boring. (one could just simply say "really boring overall" even)
---
Cuz it's a great idea dorito ass
---
This sounds like it was written by a 12 year old
---
Congrats, you basically have a CS degree now
---
You have to out sneak him. I love Spine Chill/Premonition and Urban Evasion against ghost face. My favorite thing to do is to just troll him by sneaking around and exposing him (doesn't always work, but a lot of fun when it does).
---
My mail priority is to be extra stealthy against him and to keep my head on a swivel.
---
Being a 4 man is automatically toxic? I think you need to narrow down on what's really toxic because camping because a group is a four man is absolutely out of line. They're just playing the game with friends, it'd be like 'am I justified for being toxic against killers who play nurse? I just think she's a toxic killer'
---
I want a spectator mode so I can watch all rank 20 games as a crow flying around or something
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ look at it
---
Shut Legion main
---
Swf but I keep getting rank 20 and I am currently rank 12 even if they all coming in at different times. I am sat here with platinum trophy playing with players that have 3 percent trophy‚Äôs it‚Äôs a nightmare but when playin killer I love it when they are toxic swf mostly always get them all they always come back and try to save the freind almost everytime.
---
it depends on the survivors. potato swf are never a problem. but if you have 500+ hours in the game you should know which structures spawn in which approximate area of almost all maps and its really easy to have a quick look around in the first 15 seconds of the game.  
---
its something easy like 'im getting chased at cowtree' in comms that will let every person know exactly where the killer is. beeing able to get an update on info permanently is unarguably the most op thing in the game
---
It's true, the devs could definitely solve a good bit of the issue by bringing all killers to about the same level of power - which probably isn't that easy though.
---
But it doesn't mean they'd all have to be at Nurse/Spirit level!
---
In my opinion, it'd be nice if they'd all have a decently high skill cap, so it's not brainless gameplay. Learning how to effectively use the killers power and use it creatively makes it so much more exciting!
---
(Sigh) we‚Äôve talked about why the Thing wouldn‚Äôt work as a killer for the 5726382^th time now, just look at any other thread
---
Lol literally the sweatiest build he can run
---
Sometimes i get a very quick 4K because i completly demolish survivors and the game still only gives me a safety pip. The system is utterly stupid.
---
I stopped caring, i rather stay low rank since its more fun to crush people :P
---
Well that seems shitty they could have at least gave Auric Cells
---
rule 6
---
You clearly haven‚Äôt played against a good billy, spirit, or nurse.
---
Iron Will is top tier against two of the best killers in the game. Even Quick and Quiet could be argued since you can lose the two top queens much easier. Combine with adrenaline and then exhaustion of your choice for an awesome, selfish build.
---
I dunno dude, I played five games with nurse and sucked absolute ass, not a single survivor acted toxic about it. No one even teabagged at exit gate.
---
Wasnt that patched twice?
---
Even if yes, why? Killer is letting you live, just do gens and get out. Be grateful and don't waste his time.
---
So relatable lol
---
They say that; and when they do anything the survivors will come out of the woodwork to bitch that into being negated.
---
that gets a pog from me
---
I guess most people agree he needs some adjustments to have higher potential, but he's not THAT bad. He has an insta-down ability after all.
---
Not sure. I'm talking about a while back ago.
---
The problems is that those survivors make it unfun to play, and the only way to have a fair match is using those 3 killers, well excluding nurse,2.
---
I like that killer, but why should I play him if everytime Im gonna lose, I understand that I should lose, but I want to win some matches aswell.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Crouch and you won't trigger them. Flashlights can remove them, too.
---
Iron will is good but is only top tier 'cause of the fucking spirit.
---
If it wasn't for her there are 4 other perks you want to pick over iron will.
---
Doc or Huntress. As a 3-killer and surv main (the three killers being Doc, Pig and Huntress), these two are really fun. Hitting a Hatchet at a cocky survivor is really funny.
---
I'm not that great at killer though, so play who you fele comfortable with/who interests you.
---
I mean you were gonna die on that rock anyway lol 
---
A smarter play would've been to just run deeper into the map and try to find a pallet or something
---
Huntress already exists though.
---
Being a swf is not toxic I have no idea why you think this. But camping at end game is legit so he was crying over nothing
---
This is such an underrated post lol
---
Shit's so good it has her speaking in tongues.
---
Any good builds on Myers at high ranks?
---
LOL what a joke
---
This is good lol
---
GF is my boy. Last month I got to Rank 2 with him but every single game I played with him I was shaking with stress to keep the map pressure going against red rank survivors. Im current at rank 6 with him and that where I have fun. My usual build is:  
---
Whispers: For finding people quickly at the start and to know if someone is working on a gen Im walking up to because if i know before I get there I can reposition for a good stalk on whoever is on the gen. 
---
Devour/Haunted Grounds: I've recently moved to Haunted as Devour was hit or miss with me getting 3 tokens but I run it so I can get a down or 2 or 3. If Haunted breaks at the right time it heavily helps your map pressure.
---
Discordance: I run it for nearly the same reason as whispers but its more of a map pressure triage. If discordance goes off and youre not already preoccupied by a chase or stalking someone it is important you break apart the survivors at that gen. If the game is going well you might actually let the survivors finish it while you stalk them to 99% for a later down.
---
BBQ: Because BBQ.
---
He's extremely fun in my opinion but if he's not right for you he's not right for you.
---
you an utter simpleton: iron will top tier
---
me a big brain ace main: wrong
---
I play on ps4 and I would prefer pc
---
Omg dude that clown has a family
---
It just Fixed I don‚Äôt know what happened but it fixed. Thanks for trying to help
---
Lol no, he wasn't better before. Maybe more original, but he's much better now in terms of actual gameplay viability.
---
Bill: You know what you are? You know what you are? You're a clown..
---
Clown: .....I'm a clown?
---
In my opinion, definitely. He is really dynamic to play as and against. You will struggle with him in the high ranks, but if you play casually, I think you will enjoy him
---
Yeah, like I could have earned at least 700.000 bp and around 1500 shards, for the same amout of time that it took to play the 20 games.
---
Survive With Friends
---
He's essentially Billy whitout the insane map presence and pressure. And maybe because i'm a billy main, but i actually find Billy's chainsaw easier to hit.
---
And Billy himself is weaker than nurse....
---
I knew that haha I was pretty over it at that point this isn't the first time he had teleported at me like that plus I knew the other teammate was going for the unhook and escape just wanted to buy a bit of time
---
But you see it's possible if you actually put the time and practice into it!
---
He can do it, so other can do it as well - you just gotta make an effort and do it!
---
Yes, the top 3 killers are the faster and easier options if you play the game in a competitive way, but once you took the time to learn another killer and actually become really good at using them, it'll be both fun and satisfying to get a 4k, I imagine!
---
Those are delicious. There mashed potatoes!
---

But I agree with most of your points except Freddy being 4K viable at high ranks. Like do they need 4K potential? Killers should have 2k potential at least but like 4K isn‚Äôt necessary:

As a killer, I have caught so many players because nobody takes time to heal and I can hear them groaning in a corner.

M1 is left mouse, aka left click on mouse, the default attack for all killers. An "M1 killer" is a killer that can only injure/down survivors with their default attack. Sometimes it's used negatively, ie "Just dont cleanse against plague and she's an M1 killer with no power."
---
P3 means prestige 3, as in you've hit level 50 with a character and then reset to level 1 at least twice. It gives you bloody cosmetics as a reward.
---
And that's why you only see 3 killers in high ranks, they give up in the middle of the road and stick with those options!
---
He seems to associate survivor coordination and optimal gameplay with toxic behaviour - an unfortunately quite common and wrong view on the matter.

This. You always have to consider killer Field of View is so much more limited than survivors due to first person that one of the most popular perks (monitor and abuse) helps to mitigate it. Keeping watch all around you against ghostface is so important. If you start to hear his terror music when facing a direction that means you can see him and he is currently stalking. Listen out for this when doing 360 degree sweeps and keep your eyes on the area until you can confirmed see him. Side note: hooked survivors can still reveal ghostface so even if you're on the hook keep an eye out to help your fellow survivors!
---
Looks to me like they were just bad. You were even trying to hook her and not Mori and she escaped and then you easily caught her. Sounds like whiny people that just aren‚Äôt good at the game, doing what they do best. Whining

How do I beat a survivor at the central house in Ironworks(I think. It was a house with a window on each floor, and had 2 floors.). If I chase a survivor there, they loop me infinitely and I can't gain distance. If I don't, they get a free gen and they can still go there to loop.

Quentin and Freddy are best friends.

Also remember ghost face is unique in that he's one killer you have a "power" against. A lot of ghost face players will have a small panic if they start hearing the THX sound and will kind of scatter around. They're focused on their stalking and prefer to not allow it to be broken (even though it's not that big of a deal if it is).
---
I actually made a Dwight Killer awhile back. It was awhile ago, so may be a bad power, but it was actually an Obsession power. You could change your obsession via an old Freddy putting you to sleep type thing, and when you hooked the obsession, you'd apply action speed penaltys to the survivors. His perks thus naturally were all obsession perks that helped when hunting the obsession, and had a small, minor bonus when the obsession was dead.
---
Would it be more balanced in this situation if the speed boost runs out when you run out of exposed hits?
---
Nurse is prety good. I play on console and never have I played against a nurse as good as the ones on PC. Still a force to be reckon with but wouldnt say impossible to win against

when i hooked one of them in the basement i placed a trap on the stairs then i went out of the killer shack and saw claudette‚Äôs arm behind a tree and i managed to hit her and catch her in the trap. then they all saw i was tunneling again
---
hopefully he will lose‚Ä¶ imagine a killer able to win against very coordinated SWF ? that would be stupidly op for solos !! XD
---
‚Ä¶ wait

Right around there, there is a skill ceiling. Those ranks are the ranks where things start to click with survivors and killers both. Which is why you might be feeling it on both sides. By no means are you a bad player you obviously did well enough to get the pips in this weird ranking system to get there you just have more to learn. keep at it :)

---
What‚Äôs the nerf I keep hearing about?
---
not every killer needs to be viable at high ranks, it‚Äôs just not how the game works. if you give every killer some way to patrol or end chases quick then nobody will be special. ghostface is quite strong at lower ranks but weaker at high ranks, it‚Äôs just how these games end up working. some killers will be much better against low rank players
---
I messed up once and brought the toolbox I got from the game before and lost out on the full reward...

I bought Jed solely because his grunts are relatable.

Also I want him to ram me from behind but I want Amanda to do that to me too so it were the grunts that sealed it for me. It was him or Amanda and she lost

The first time you hook your obsession, the entity progresses 10 / 20 / 30% faster. After being unhooked, they cannot be affected by this perk. If your obsession has changed, then the first time you hook them, regardless of how many times they were hooked before, this perk applies.
---
No he just has a really good gaming chair.
---
I don't think it's a bad habit at all, in fact I don't think there's anything better to do when you're searching out of a chase. Even in a chase it can sometimes be a good idea to spread the damage and not let the survivors think they're free to go setting off traps when you're occupied with another. 
---
Only time I would avoid it is if you know that a survivor knows where a trap is placed and is trying to intentionally draw your attention by triggering it, but that's pretty specific, if somewhat common with better survivors.
---

Can you still killer burn the wraith?
---
I only found this out the other day that if you shine your torch at the wraith it forces him to uncloak and burns him and stuns him like a killer blind would. Is this still a thing and can you do this with any other killers? :-)
---
I'm usually on PS4 at night. What's you name and I'll add you when I get home.
---
Delete it from the game
---
So the. Again, what‚Äôs the issue?
---
Like everyone else said. He has been stream sniped for about 2 weeks and, he has been trying to advocate less toxicity and taking Dead by Daylight from being ‚ÄúBully Simulator‚Äù into a balanced and fair game for both sides. There is a decent sized Toxic player base, there are so many salt diaries and shit like that for views it‚Äôs like some people antagonize for attention or whatever. I would imagine consistently being exposed to that sort of shit for views and working against that could be exhausting. Honestly all we can do is speculate.
---
Pretty much every killer that relies on stealth
---
So finally got a friend to buy this game and we're having quite a bit of fun. However, after every game he gets a "cannot update rank" error. I've looked online and can't seem to find a fix? Anyone know what's up?
---
Tier 1 built in Iron will at best
---
Yeah, I always like watching babies kill other babies, it reminds me about Dead by Daylight

They nerfed a while ago, the blind time is something around 1 second and can't go faster, no matter what flashlight/addon. Also, the only add-ons worth running nowadays is batteries and low amp filament, odd bulb is garbage

He is (till now) the only killer who I couldn't beat
---
True chaotic neutral

I feel the doctor is severely underrated as a killer. I'd put him in the top 5 killers for console imo.

no offence bro im not interested in what u beat ur meat to

*on a side note could u hit me up w some leatherface material*

Which is the same way I feel, it's really odd and doesn't fit in.
---
I hate it
---
Yes it‚Äôs still a thing but it only works while he‚Äôs moving. If he‚Äôs completely invisible, then it won‚Äôt work. Also no, this only works on the wraith
---
It‚Äôs bugged
---
Fair enough, as long as you‚Äôre not the person who does it like 50 feet in front of the killer
---
Its bugged. Sometimes it makes me stutter in place and sometimes it works normally.
---
It sucks :(

Don‚Äôt need items to do a gen...

Bro I just posted cringe I‚Äôm gonna lose subscribers
---
Where's my Iron Will and No Mither group at?
---
But there are times it makes Sence to camp and then there are times where camping is just stupid camping when everyone is alturistic somewhat coming back to check on the hook is a good idea or producing around to see if people come but if they aren't running for save immidatly yeah I'll leave and look for others but if i down one person and door is open I will camp if they don't leave to scare them off because it's securing a kill at that point because it's either you get the kill or everyone escapes
---
No, the only things you lose when you prestige a character is any perks they currently have in their "inventory" and any items, add-ons, or offerings they have. You also get a sweet item! Also, once you get a certain perk's teachable version, it's unlocked forever and will eventually appear in other bloodwebs.
---
The hero we need

Keep trying. It worked once on me so far out of about 100 attempts but it did work sooo...

Damn nice catch guess  im equally blind as a window of opportunities player

---
I cap when it makes Sence too if your hooked in endgame I'm going to secure my kill not going to risk losing a kill. If your team is running to save everytime I hook yes I will stay near by to get the person who is saving . But if your team isn't alturistic I will leave you alone come back if I'm in the area and lost a chase then be on my merry way

Survivors sabotage them and they start untrapped until you set them down.
---
Like I said people are gonna play how they want
---
It‚Äôs still camping
---
This movie was pretty mediocre, it had it's moments but overall it was pretty weak. Damn I wish for actually good remake like Halloween got.
---
It‚Äôs definitely my video
---
Is there really any way to win against survivors using dischord/voip?  I'm starting to realize I get annihilated anytime a SWF group joins.
---
Who gives a fuck what the answer to those questions are? In no world should 3 kills equate to losing "rank".
---
I'm confident that rank in dead by daylight is a net negative.
---
Gotta love pewdiepie
---
Why not both
---
They're planning on fixing that FYI
---
How rude
---
I play PS4 and 100% of nurse I go against are just bad? Constantly missing blink hits I stay 8-12 range tho so idk if they get better lower
---
This has happened to me as well, but it fixed itself when I closed/quit the game completely and reopened it. (I play on Xbox)
---
Lmao wtf no it shouldnt, the game is easy enough for survivors as it is
---
I have all the important ones like reach rank 1 and use ability x times, but some are impossibly difficult to get. like the tombstone Meyers one.
---
Wouldn't survivors want to derank then? Seal Team 6 SWFs could destroy low rank killers even easier
---
Escape is not an escape
---
I think it depends on your luck? I've gotten my adept Trapper about a week ago and it took me only a couple of tries. I had purple add ons and I was on Crotus which helped tremendously.
---
 (I was also probably rank 9 which also definitely helped, no red rank survivors. I'm guessing you are higher ranked than me which makes it harder)
---
I thought I saw on the DBD forums that they're going to need the amount of dream pallets based on add-ons and the snares are going to slow you down less.
---
I got the idea from OTZ, a very good killer btw his videos helped me improve a lot. It revolves around the perk play with your good, I like furtive chase as well. The other 2 you can pick whatever you like. For addons I usually go with the grease and carburetor tuning guide. You zip around when you get stacks.
---
Yet you take it out on me? Why? Couldnt you try being helpful, it would have made the whole situation a lot better.
---
Either derank and enjoy the game more casually or accept the sweat and start doing meta build
---
Sorry you don't know how to press a button? Or look at the options menu?
---
Lol
---
Problem with this logic is this assumes a few things about killer mains.
---
1)They have all the perks they want/need on the killer. With the grind in this game, both new killers and old killers alike can be without the works needed to make their killer shine. 
---
2) Time not every Pig main is bout to dedicate hours upon hours to to just become good enough to sometimes 4k when a few hours can just be spent maining the top tier.
---
3) Most importantly, you assume the killer controls the pace of the match. They don't currently. As someone who plays both sides frequently, the amount of mistakes a survivor make is directly tied a killer's success if they aren't top tier. Not slightly influenced by, almost completely.
---
No matter the perk loadout the killer runs, the survivors have the numbers and the perks necessary to make the killer's life hell and the only thing that the killer can do to regain some control is bring OP add-ons.
---
But as a survivor, you won't believe the mistakes I seen made (even by myself) that has a snowball effect. I watch Otz play and very rarely I have I seen an entire match where they used a mid tier killer, with no OP add ons *and* damn near perfect survivors, to good effect.
---
He's completely fine now. I don't know why people want everything they don't know how to play against to be trash.
---
Also it's fucking Freddy Krueger after all, he shouldn't be easy to play against.
---
Love this so damn much
---
I always run this and Adrenaline
---
Hag doesnt chase though. Theres not really much of a sacrifice. What Hag sacrifices is getting countered by a flashlight that a survivor brought/found in a chest.
---
Yes. When I play killer I always use my ears and I will loose a survivor using IW.
---
No
---
Whos perk is furtive chase? Im too lazy to check.
---
There are reasons to camp you can't get mad at that I play both survivor and killer but I'm not gunna lose a kill because some survivor says it's aginst the rules to camp when it really isn't
---
Not exactly, it‚Äôs effective against every killer when it comes to ending chases
---
I play too, but I don‚Äôt camp, and it‚Äôs not against the rules, it‚Äôs just frowned upon and people don‚Äôt like it.
---
Problaby just a add on, its not like she has op add ons already
---
You killed them, so clearly it was a good match
---
You can set down basically all of your traps if you‚Äôre efficient, be smart with them and place them in front of pallets or around loops so survivors either get caught by them or have to spend time to avoid them. A popular place to trap is the killer shack at the corner near pallet door or the window. You are one of the fastest killers (115% speed) so use that to stop loops. With ruin you can slow the game down somewhat so you can place your traps, if you place them well enough some survivors will get caught in them
---
Scream face
---
Every once in a while you get a competent team and it helps man, I've been face camped and the guy told me it was cause was in a swf when I only play solo so as much as it sucks man the only way the game really seems chill is when you can handle the killer otherwise they hunt you down lol

---
Rank is how good you are at the game as a whole. Getting a 4k by hooking everyone 2-3 times before more than 2-3 gens got done in rather quick chases shows more skill than getting a 4k by smacking each person on the ground once and watching them slowly bleed out.
---
There's no actual gain in BP, rewards, shards, etc. in rank and it's main use in theory should be to pair you with equally skilled players, if you're unable to gain pips consistently then maybe you're where you belong. There's 4 different categories for  a reason
---
It lowers terror radius in a chase per token you get. That part is whatever but it also changes the obsession to the person getting the unhook, which can make it easier to get tokens on PWYF. It's a personal choice thing all you really need is PWYF
---
Please make one of Mimi Imfurst as a killer üòÇ
---
Thought this was an announcement about them from BHVR &gt;:'(
---
That‚Äôs like millions of hrs put into the game
---
If you really played both you would understand there are times to soft camp someone to secure a kill and times when to just hook and leave
---
The thing is, if you're 500+, you probably will know that killer is chasing someone around the infinite even without any comms
---
I did on my first win as killer, as wraith. Never again üòÇ
---
How steep is the learning curve? I'd bought the game a while ago but never played because I'm afraid of being really bad and ruining my team
---
I've had it for awhile and I have no virus.
---
Which path of you chosen if you don't mind me asking
---
That's just what they call it. It looks like it goes into the phone instead of popping out.
---
There are few things in this game as satsifying as making that one toxic survivor eat shit and hooking them. Catharsis incarnate.
---
This is soo good.

Ok but why remake leatherface

---
You would not have earned more Shards in that time, however. The real reward here is the Shards.
---
Maybe, I was hoping they'd prefer a challenge over ez wins.  That said, with the status quo they already would benefit from deranking, wouldn't they?
---
I understand people not trusting it but I've had zero problems and zero popup ads for it. I just figured people that love DBD as much as I do would want to have it. I'm not lying. It's pretty badass.
---

In terms of survivor bp, those are hella good points

Why not a Prada or Gucci handbag

How so?

Especially in DbD as there is really no time to aim vs. time to aim type of competition in it imo (as opposite to usual multiplayer shooter games)
---
If you're in the husks radius it might not be as surprising when you're picked off a gen.
---
reread. I never say it wasn't effective. I said there are other perks you want to use before picking Iron will for every other killer but Spirit.
---
Do you think it's combined with some sort of turbo programming, or legitimate?

---
Step back I think i'm gonna vomit, HUUUUHHHHH
---
It was pretty funny. Thanks for the clarification. I don't have legion, so I wasn't familiar with mad grit.
---
It‚Äôs a bit of a meme build. With Agitation the Killer moves faster than Survivors while carrying another and then Mad Grit gives 0 cooldown for missed attacks, so they can keep swinging again and again. I believe it‚Äôs a bit bugged right now though and it actually gives them a speed boost with each swing as well, making the Killer even faster.
---
What‚Äôs funny is that it‚Äôs actually the opposite. Survivors run this sub and will continue to complain about killers nonstop while you guys have broken perks and shit.
---
Probably ‚Äúdon‚Äôt gen rush, use flashlights, insta heal, use DS, etc‚Äù.  Both sides have expectations for how others should play, unfortunately.
---
How about you play killer at red ranks and then come back and see why killer mains despise survivors.
---
How?
---
You do seem to get a lot of spirits on PS4 I have noticed.
---
It‚Äôs nice to have one speed boost perk. Look for Meg‚Äôs Sprint Burst or Feng Min‚Äôs Lithe.  Meg‚Äôs Adrenaline is nice (heals you one health state when exit gates are powered and gives you a speed boost). Bill‚Äôs Borrowed Time is really good for altruism (allows people you get off hook to take two hits instead of one).
---
You keep bringing up this because you know your wrong for being mean because you cant handle your own problems, it doesn't have to be like that if you just try to be a good person

Huh that's funny for me it's just all DC and crying if one of them gets downed

I also try my damnedest to not be found by the killer because I'm garbage at chases. And a common trend my friends and I noticed is that whenever I run my medic setup, I get tunneled to no end, leaving with a whopping 3-4k because I never had a chance to get away and do anything productive.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just not seeing it‚Äù

U laught. We cry. Ur the big sad

Adrenaline, balanced landing, dead hard, decisive strike, borrowed time
---
On killer: ruin, enduring, bbq, nurses calling, spirit fury
---
Just google who has these perks
---
**no don't do it**
---
The best killer perks are;
---
- BBQ &amp; chilli for both killer bp and tracking. Once you get this teachable it will make killer so much more profitable.
---
- Hex: ruin for slowing the game down. (Hag perk)
---
Rest is kind of your choice as these tend to be the most popular perks. You could go for enduring as that is a great perk for any killer. 
---
I personally love having Pop Goes The Weasel (Clown perk) with ruin as it helps slow gens down tremendously.
---
For Survivor;
---
- We are gonna live forerver for bp. Its a David King perk.
---
- Dead Hard or Balanced Landing. Both are really good exhaustion perks. Dead hard is David King. Balanced Landing is a Nea perk.
---
- Borrowed time to allow you to save survivors without worrying about farming them. Bill perk.
---
- Adrenaline is one of the best perks in the game. Provides you a free heal at the end to increase your chances of survival and rewards you for working on gens. Meg perk.
---
- Decisive strike is a great perk for tunneling killers. Will practically grant you 60 seconds of hook immunity after being unhooked making it a very good perk. Laurie strode perk.
---
Prime content. 
---
She can be both killer and survivor. 
---
As killer:
---
Lip Sync for Your Life - The Entity Empowers the Killer to hear the life giving energies given to a downed survivor. When a survivor is healed from the dying state lithe killer gets a notification and can see the aura of the healed and healer for 1/2/3 seconds.
---
Shante You Stay - The Killer is imbued with a charismatic calling to survivors making them want to stay in The Trial. Survivors in the dying state are unable to crawl and recovery is slowed by 5/10/15 percent. Does not effect healing from other survivors.
---
Hello Hello Helllooooo - The Killer believes in making an entrance. The Killer is able to hide in a locker and burst forth to surprise survivors. While hidden the Killers heartbeat is hidden and aura and detection perks will not work. After 5/3/2 seconds in the locker, the Killer May burst from the locker causing all Survivors in range to become injured, or enter the dying state of injured.  Perk has a 60 second cool down regardless of success.

---
Did she get nerfed again?
---
I'm running self care on there too so grunts of pain aren't a problem generally this isn't my normal build. I was just playing with some friends who are lower rank so I'd feel bad running all the top tier perks üëç
---
I like to juke, personally.  My favorite, however, is hiding in plain sight before or during a chase.  The tall grass in Yamaoka is my home.  Call me a Pokemon.  That's the best place to fuck with killers and head game them.

Why the hell didnt you put a fucking sea goat km the background -__-
---
Alright so I was about to downvote and continue on my way, but... This actually seems like a good idea.
---
I‚Äôve always felt bad about running NoED as a crutch, but I run it to counter 2+ adrenaline stacking. I‚Äôd feel a lot less toxic with this sort of counterplay, instead of needing to find ALL 5 totems or all your work is null.
---
*Happy Oink Noises*

Oh I diddnt know sorry, I'm new on reddit it suggested I tag it as that and I went along with it :o
---
Let press alt+f4 simutainiously

---
I believe it does, but it wouldn‚Äôt really counter nurses if you are healing someone and they don‚Äôt have it. Their aura would still show
---
No emojis mate 
---
Thanks
---
Yeah, so DCing is only an option when you get upset?
---
Thank you so much!
---
People actively try to be offended by everything.  When everyone is a victim everyone loses.
---
Also for whatever reason people take this, and every other game way too seriously.  Instead of having a good time they have to be the best and ultimately just get salty as hell because it's kinda a random game sometimes.
---
Lol I feel like its killer tradition when they see 4 of the same character to bring a mori. It's honestly pretty funny haha
---
Do you normally run pwyf on myers?
---
I asked McLean about even just a HUDless mode, and he said they have a tool that does it, but I doubt we‚Äôll ever see a version we can use. We‚Äôre pretty much limited to cropping half our screen and reusing their cinematics.

Its an old screenshot, perks used to place like that
---
Okay, thank you for the clarification. ü§ó

How I need this lore XD

If you photobomb me as ghostface I‚Äôm giving you hatch

Well if he's in Night Shroud you dont get borrowed time

That‚Äôs the tea

I know, but toolboxes are the main way to gen-rush
---
Replace Self Care with Bond. That way you can easily find people to heal you, and also you can see if one of your teammates needs to be healed.
---
Should be a killer
---
Nice scam lmao
---
I don‚Äôt have friends who play DBD. Do I just stop playing completely?
---
DC on loading screen if the killer is any DLC character. Survivor requeue is seconds, DLC killer suffers.

It's not a scam but think what you want. I'll enjoy my Nurse wallpaper.

Why low amp if the timing is the same? Run double batteries
---
Most people run double batteries so it can last longer now. Odd bulb is trash
---
PC, ingame: i just had a game as a survivor versus a Legion and none of us could mend at all. Not by ourselves and not each other so we kept falling until we died. I forgot to see the add ons he used in case they were related with the issue but more people must have reported this.
---
I don't think you know what that add-on does
---
Well that's sad, hope they fix it soon. In really wanted adept min :(
---
I thought it was in the cornfield at first, then I took a second look
---
Yeah, I've paid for it several times but I can't help myself. Revealing ghost face is like a favorite hobby of mine.
---
I‚Äôve had times I‚Äôve seen him for half a second, and looked away praying he didn‚Äôt notice. If he doesn‚Äôt see me no reason to give myself away.
---
I never said its not but it's a nesaacary evil that's where by and ds come in handy or if the person 4% I will let them go because they just did it I'll let them go but that's it
---
And is also the shortest I think.
---
It‚Äôs odd, because whilst I‚Äôve only gotten Adept on three survivors (Ash, Ace and Quentin), I‚Äôve never had an issue with actually getting it when the conditions were met. Killer is understandable- there are plenty of variables for Killer to get Adept- but survivor is generally straight forward and I‚Äôve never experienced issues nor heard of any. Weird.
---
I‚Äôm unable to play as the killer currently because doing so makes me the host of the match, but my internet isn‚Äôt great, so usually everyone leaves because it makes everyone lag. But once dedicated servers are added to the game, this should fix this problem, right?
---
I can play as a survivor just fine. I just hate how I‚Äôm missing out on a whole aspect of this game because of my internet.
---
Hiding is not a juke imo lmao
---
I believe it shows the depip on the results screen but doesn‚Äôt actually take away the pips, it‚Äôs weird.
---
This is exactly why I try and do short chases. Injure the survivor or just try to get a pallet out of them and then leave to find somebody else.
---
What killers does the flashlight work against?
---
I‚Äôve seen this happen in my games too, but what I‚Äôve never seen is someone bind their interact key to fucking E
---
I really don‚Äôt get the don‚Äôt cleanse people, I‚Äôd say giving everyone broken status is pretty good.

Awwwwwww ur so niceeeee

im less annoyed by that than that they can take the trap off before it's even been activated or that a generator has to be completed before the trap is activated in the first place
---
noice

I removed the tag anyway as too not cause any unnecessary confusion :)
---
The only reward for ranking up is no longer having fun.

This was my first one but I would like to start my Wraith and Nea cosplay soon. Sadly I can‚Äôt since I won‚Äôt be home for 4 months later this month. But after that I will most likely do Wraith
---
Ayo I haven't played in a while due to a couple bugs ruining the experience, have been into Minecraft and R6 Siege again. Fuck man the break has been worth it and those games are so fun when you haven't played them in a while. I'd come on some time just hit me up with a friend request. My PSN is TheManiac021.
---
*hello there*
---
Y tho?
---
I had an SWF of 3 people, all three of them named after a survivor in DBD (no naming and shaming). It was quite sad to say the least.
---
I do use ruin can never get totem to last more than 20 seconds tops. I get tons of 5 to 6 min games (rank 1-2) almost always black pip because I keep getting such short ass games. I do gen kicks but not constantly sometimes it's better to end a chase rather than going to kick a gen I apply loads of pressure as to get iri chaser u need constant downs and wins to get it iri which implies if you have iri chaser then gens should last at least 8 to 10 mins but nope I get tons of 5 to 6 min games.
---
Well do you have discord or something because I would love to keep in contact with you and see more of your cosplays when you do get to them
---
Well done! Looks like ur floating

Like my changes if not could you suggest some?

Claudette just wants some healer points

Yup anytime

r/cursed_comments?

To be fair, Bubba in the original film managed to come across as a genuine threat while still seeming doofy and bumbling. It kind of feels thematically correct that in a lineup of Killers in the Entity's realm, he'd be the least capable, considering he's mentally handicapped and behaves like an uncoordinated toddler with a chainsaw and mallet. He's also kind of sympathetic in the first film, so everyone in DBD thinking he's an adorable non-threat is fitting.
---
u stop and respect them; then stare as they t-bag and feed you evil within
---
Nerf Freddy? What you talking about? Since he came out reworked they were hot and heavy the first 2 days on PS4, every game or every other game it was a Freddy and for the last week I haven‚Äôt played against any! Just the normal, spirits, pigs, Billy‚Äôs and a wacky nurse here and there, few Myers after dark...
---
That's *Queen* Amanda
---
Here's one; me being taken to hook, I see a teammate crouching around the corner from said hook.  The killer hooks me, my 1st hook, and as they turn to go to gen that busted the team8 runs and gets me off hook.
---
The killer, who was only 10 meters away, 180s and tunnels me, who doesn't have endurance from borrowed time.  My 2nd hook, the same team8 tries again with same timing, but luckily; for me; they're pulled off me before they get the "save."
---
At the end of match I see that no one in the game  was running 'We're gonna live forever' or 'borrowed time.'
---
Congratulations
---
"Oh shit, I'm sorry"
---
"Sorry for what?"
---
I'm only rank 5 so that's probably why I feel differently too you if your against top tier survivors I'm not surprised your having a rougher time but in the lower ranks it seems fairly well balanced just my opinion on it has to be an accessible atmosphere for pros and casual players even at rank 5 people can't repair through ruin haha
---
That's awesome that you have to queue with a rank 20 to win games. It gets too hard playing against good killers huh?
---
Good work, bruv!
---
They‚Äôre good ideas
---
u know what, i agree with u. i was kinda just jumping on the bandwagon of taking the piss out of how non-threatening he is to go against, like good survivors won't die to him but in the movies he's a pretty savage and ruthless killer

---
Stop being a toxic killer ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Uh...source?
---
Yes megamind nice
---
The game has a shit design. It is basically a farming simulator, where you have to make sure to do a decent amount of everything and get points in every category.
---
Never mind that you wipe out all four survivors without a single gen done. Never mind that you've achieved your job incredibly efficiently as a killer, it's not good enough. Because you didn't chase everyone for a few minutes each.
---
It's the same with survivor. You can escape killer all match. Entire team never gets hooked, plays the best they could possibly be, and all four escape. Oh, that's a depip, because we didn't rescue anyone off hooks.
---
The game's levelling system is a fucking joke.
---
Remake LF is more imposing than 74 LF., Not to say he's better, per se. In the 74 movie he was kind of sympathetic because he was just a mentally handicapped person following orders. The remake tried to make him gritty and tough looking. So to answer your question, there's less of a contrast, I suppose.
---
Honestly mate, the game was giving me trouble about a month ago. I took a break and came back last week, man oh man I wasn't expecting the devs response of "play a different game if you aren't having fun" would have worked. I got to enjoy so many games I literally haven't play in months - years cause dbd had taken me from the start of playing it, it was only when the repetiveness starting to overcome me, and the whole thought of losing the fun of a game because I played it too much started to become apparent. Splitting between multiple games fixed the problem, enjoying a different game when I got frustrated made be feel a lot better. And now dbd feels a little new to me, since I gotta get my bearings and work out what's happening again. If you are having problems with the game consistently, I'd suggest taking a short break from the game or switching between a different game you haven't played in a while. It's a lot of fun.
---
no pip, 4 man
---
I usually don't have this happen bc with kindred, the ghostface looks like a dumbass, and when my teammate had borrowed time, he can reveal him, unhook, and then the Ghostface dc's
---
That‚Äôs fine! My DBD insta is @urbannea :)
---
Wasn't your daily mate. Was your reward for participating in the vanilla experiment.
