Now instead of one button I have to hit two, unplayable
---
---
---
Exactly. Nancy‚Äôs new one where she has to be injured, cleanse a dull totem, go into a locker for 10 seconds is beyond stupid. I cleanse every totem I see so good luck with that, Nancy. Maybe players will actually help me cleanse for once instead of me having to loop back to a clearly visible totem next to a completed generator...
---
Just think of legion as a ugly version of Billy and you‚Äôll be alright.
---
I would recommend slugging....especially if you suspect you‚Äôre playing against higher ranked survivors. It may not be the most fun thing in the world but until the matchmaking is ironed out, it‚Äôll be effective
---
Nothing wrong with a brojob. I'm straight but have given a fair few. Just make sure there is no kissing.
---
I agree, i do just ignore it and usually refuse to make contact with anyone. But man its so bad now, people really gotta stop, its gonna kill the game
---
Theres some good ones out there.
---
Oh, and the update turned out to have as many bugs as the PTB as usual. Fucking shocker!!! üò±üò±üò±

This. But I actually bought Myers with Laurie, Pig and Ghostface. Wont buy anyone ever again tho ;)
---
Its very rare you stumble across these people, theyre the diamonds in the rough
---
I really don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs an invisible box behind as far as some people think. A lot of people don‚Äôt try killer all that much and don‚Äôt understand their lunge like they should. I‚Äôve had a newish player legit teabag by a window because she thought I couldn‚Äôt hit her and she was literally right next to the thing so I just stared at her for a second confused and downed her. I‚Äôm hoping that meg learned her lesson. But the same applies to loops. I notice a lot of videos where people will say ‚Äúhow did this hit me?‚Äù But they aren‚Äôt looking behind them while the hit connects so it‚Äôs impossible to even observe the situation. Just taking their word for it with no proof to make hitboxes smaller would be a bad move for any game.
---
Thank you , and thanks for the constructive criticism ! I try really hard to improve myself , and since i am not naturally "talented" , i have to work to do anything good .

What does immersed mean in this context?
---
Level up the survivor/killers bloodweb to level 30/35/40, and a teachable perk will pop up. It will be one of the special perks
---
Is literally everyone getting BBQ on Demo level 1? Happened to me too.
---
They absolutely don‚Äôt need to be longer
---
i cant think of a single perk like that, any specific examples?
---
PC actually.
---
All of the unlicensed characters, you can get without real money (by using shards you get in the game instead through playing). When it comes to the licensed characters... that‚Äôs all a matter of preference. If you did only ever get one, it always sounds like Leatherface is the best way to go, but like someone else said, you can get the perks in the shrine, so I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it too much.
---
TL;DR - You can get half of the content just by playing through the game. The other half is mainly for nostalgic purposes!
---
Well, since they made it so friends joined the main lobby instead of swf, I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd complicate things if you had a full team and pressed switch to killer.
---
It's out now baby!
---
Level them up to levels 30-40 and then you‚Äôll unlock the ability to teach them. The perks will show up with an orange background in the bloodweb. After you teach the perk, it‚Äôll show up in every other characters bloodwebs
---
Rancor is a must-have for tackling Mori dailies easily.
---
Then say ‚Äúscrew company policy‚Äù and take the hat off in every lobby
---
All I want to know is why Ghostface doesn't get the "Undetectable" status effect while in night shroud. One of the biggest complaints is that OoO neuters him entirely (yes OoO users are rare but I still feel its an issue). I would love if someone could explain this to me because I am just confused.
---
haha yes time for 300k bloodpoints for steve instead of buying actual perks i don't have
---
Xbox One. Same. Also matchmaking is significantly worse. Constantly over or under matched with significant gaps between ranks.
---
Thanks
---
Thank you
---
I was playing with friends some customs earlier this evening, but since two hours we couldn't start a game either.
---
NEA NOOOO
---
Balanced landing with vaulting high windows is mainly what I try to do. But some vaults are still a great idea. Or you can go for a fake vault and juke at the last second. I‚Äôve pulled that off a couple times but tbh I forget that move a lot in the heat of the moment.
---
Ash? Yeah it's his season 3 outfit IIRC
---
Yah I got on and saw the updates ;)
---
Jeez this is a really old meme format
---
50% off the game and all DLC packs excluding Stranger Things.
---
Yeah, they 'oPTimiSe' all right. It's actually worse on console. Before menu loading was at least instaneous. Now it's crawling to a halt.
---
the toxicity spreads exponentially, once exposed, it never fully leaves
---
I also play on both consoles and my Xbox One X is faster than my Ps4 Pro, but my Ps4 is Faster than My Xbox, and almost on par with my Pro. I think everyone's consoles run differently, and that neither of them are more superior.
---
And gemodecorgin
---
Yeah, I've been using dying light. It might just be a coincidence but I'll take it off and see if that changes anything.
---
Lol, I had the same thing
---
I'm actually the exact opposite. All talent, no technique :u  
---
I do try hard to give constructive criticism though. Like here specifically, it's the area between his right shoulder and the elbow that I don't get. It's like his arm and his torso blend together or something. Also, is he wearing long sleeves?
---
Lithe is probably the worst exhausting perks for my play but I know a couple people who‚Äôs brains are just wired for that perk and they use it really well. Most of the time.
---
This is BS, BHVR. This on top of Jake and David getting the shaft for new outfits. *smh*
---
"talki g"
---
Guess they're saving the real showstoppers for the rift/battle pass coming soon
---
Can agree.  One tome I was lucky to find a wholesome group and we all finished a single gen in a half a minute
---
Ugh iron will, I'm expecting to see lots of stealth builds this week now. Kill me.
---
I'd like balance to be first and seeing the stain under walls on low is bullshit.
---
Fucking rip
---
It could work
---
(Credit goes to @SenzuDuck on Twitter for the screenshot)
---
It's free for the weekend, 5 days
---
So by that logic, you should stand idle next to a person on the hook and not look away for one second and savour every moment as their life clock slowly ticks down and blood trickles down their body....then you would be effectively doing the opposite of camping and tunneling by the definition you were given...right. :P /s
---
That's really weird. I've heard some people saying that this update has reduced the optimisation so maybe there's a few bugs hidden in it. Hopefully it gets addressed soon cause I'm loving playing the dlc so far!
---
Yeah I wanna level up Nea for balanced landing but I'm lazy. Yeah I got my Jane to P3 took like a while but I presitged her twice during the summer
---
I love playing Spirit a lot but people like to hate on her for some reason
---
Stalk around corners. Cannot say that enough. Right now i am running Barbecue and chili, discordance, hex ruin, and a nurses calling. I wanna know where people are so i can find the beat vantage points to stalk around corners. The reason why you stalk around corners is it is 2 times as fast than regular stalking. Wish you luck, try to stay in nightshroud a lot.
---
Oh I see, another question: these shards are too hard to get?  (Just curious, I decided to buy the game anyway)
---
Rank 15 is the lowest you can derank.
---
STEVE AT CAMPFIRE
---
I‚Äôm stuck on a vacation with my significant others parents. I‚Äôm an indoors person and we‚Äôre at a beach resort. 
---
Less than a week until I can get a go at this!
---
I‚Äôm like 90% sure that was lag. Not trying to be rude but it looked a lot like lag.
---
Boom kinda sounds overpowered.
---
Yeah you are right! Its missing a separating line between his arm and torso . Damn my eyes . Also , he is wearing long sleeves .
---
Sad oink doesn't own pig yet but yeah I really like playing her with my splinters.
---
Even though I don't play Quentin much he is my second favorite survivor but everytime I play him I get bad luck for some reason
---
Is the killer 500 auric cells?
---
Just bought the skin it better not happen in my first game
---
Most definitely! I know everyone wants IT (i do too), but i almost want Jack Torrence instead :]
---
BUBBA!
---
This DLC needs the Wassup face cosmetics for Ghostface. All three of those masks if possible
---
Yeah that was always bad but now it takes me much longer to actually get mismatched vs the usual 10 seconds on PC as survivor.
---
[removed]
---
Apparently you never played League of Legends
---
Stridor directly counters Iron Will if you have it, and Infectious Fright which is on this shrine can help keep you safe from injured iron will people going for flashlight saves
---
That lobby was a green ping lobby. Dedicated servers need to fix this shit.
---
Stridor be like.....
---
I like a killer where i can hands off the controls to get a drink or eat something and the survivors im chasing will climb over the pallet to me.. lol
---
Oh, okay. I don't think his head is big, by the way. I assumed that's just the mask.
---
I‚Äôd like to enjoy it but the servers are so garbage rn
---
Yup. KYF is broken as fuck. I haven't tried public matches. This is frustrating as fuck!!!!
---
I literally did lmao. Just because ‚Äúyou‚Äôve seen it‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. You could just be some salty kid who is angry they didn‚Äôt make it first, KID. Go get a life instead of dissing people‚Äôs MEMES. I just wanna make people laugh
---
For killer: BBQ, unerving pressece, enduring, Bamboozle. Anti Ds build. Just tunnel off of hook and everyone will miss ds.
---
survivor:We're gonna live forever(BP's), Q&amp;Q, head on, dance with me. Stun killer and they can't see where you go bc dance with me
---
It *was* used. When the Halloween chapter first came out, that sound (which is taken from [The Hedge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My9I-S82hJA) ) would play when Michael was stalking you and was close to entering his next tier, but they removed it later on to give him a bigger element of surprise.
---
They both left the match. People will call it DC or Dissconecct
---
Pennywise is the obvious thought but King has a whole lot of properties
---
Ah, you're right. I keep mixing up the effects of Undetectable and Oblivious.
---
Survivors floating up into the air, game glitchy AF, completely bugged. Smh.
---
I‚Äôm so fucking pissed. I just leveled Jake up for it yesterday.
---
Didn't for us today.
---
Breakdown again?!?
---
Same here
---
Yamcha and his weighteÃ∂dÃ∂ Ã∂cÃ∂lÃ∂oÃ∂tÃ∂hÃ∂eÃ∂sÃ∂.
---
I can't get invites and kyf to work at all
---
I doubt they would do so many licenses in a row. If they do want a Stephen King chapter it would probably be after the next one for some original content.
---
Yeah we were literally on our way to running out. One game the killer DCed because we got someone off hook and away when he was facecamping him at the end.
---
okay i did that thank you. do you know how long till i get a reply??
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and I don‚Äôt lose anything but offering either
---
No, you‚Äôre not a specialist. It‚Äôs open. It‚Äôs the game. I‚Äôm not the only one having this issue.
---
Nope infact for me it's better
---
No.
---
I actually get less frustrated the more the DLCs come out. Stuff like BBQ used to be piss me off no end. Then distortion came out. People hated being killed straight off a hook, then decisive strike got made into anti tunnelling perk, camping got nerfed with borrowed time.
---
I'm on PS4 so there's a lot less messages after, but the more of the bullshit gameplay the devs removed the less frustrating the game becomes. Still a lot to fix, and theres still a bit of gate teabagging and ghostface teabagging. But in general, its getting better. Still needs more anti tunnelling and anti bubba/myer/ghostface camping fixes though.
---
Mine says social services unavailable when I try KYF or SWF
---
I beg to differ, that's a rather harsh statement
---
Where are you when I need that lol
---
It's full of baby killers who I try to encourage to keep it up, and baby survivors who block Windows while you're trying to get away from killers, just wonderful.
---
Erm I saw this too, Dead by daylight have been following Stephen King before they even followed Patricia and content creators such as Bryce Mquaid. With this Bryce Mquaid has a tshirt in the charity case which was released on August 10th 2017, which suggests that dbd have been following Stephen King for over 2 years. This is all from Paul Esthers YouTube video, he does really good predictions on dbd. Should check out his video on this.
---
David is another Hawkins Lab experiment gone wrong
---
Same for me but it also says there are connection errors that then make the invite menu stop working so my friend and I have to reopen the game
---
I've read that changing your NAT can be troublesome and isn't very secure. I currently have a router from my ISP and then a Nitehawk modem. I once asked my ISP about it and I got the impression he didn't want to change it, said he would but security would be an issue. He said I could change it on my modem instead.
---
Should I get Infectious Fright or Rancor?
---
Not PS4 but it's definitely happening on Xbox as well. I'm seeing posts about it happening on both today.
---
Not even a healthcare collections threat can stop me
---
SO MANY WET MEN
---
He might need new teeth in his chainsaw. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be cutting into the tree that well which is a sign of dull teeth. He should probably run down to a hardware store after the match to grab a new set.
---
The shirt!
---
DARN! Yesterday I started leveling Jake up to get specificaly this perk, hes level 25 already or so and youre saying its in the shrine this week and I didnt have to waste all my bloodpoints on this jerk. Lucky me.
---
I live the devil one
---
Not even the bank calling me to tell me I have no money can stop me!
---
I ended up getting red body (not devil outfit), devil mask, and bone clip blade
---
My first match was with a scoops ahoy Steve
---
Mr. Popo, please get the sacred ointments.
---
Aight
---
I like that rebalance. If you just ignor damage its a better dead hard, but not every dead hard is used to dodge attacks. It would be a fun pairing of those two perks.
---
I mean, it's exactly how he looks in the show so. Why would they change his look.
---
Its not even mechanics, its just the bratty community
---
I had this in a laggy game too lol
---
Well... idk but imagine the velociraptor really in the game.
---
r/dbdgonewild content
---
Oh boy, campers!
---
I highly doubt it, since as soon as I disarmed the trap it turned back to the normal colour.
---
Licensed killers brings in so many fans though, e.g. on twitch today dbd had 50k viewers, normally has less than 20k.  Plus the next chapter may just be a survivor or a killer. As it doesn't come with a map. So pennywise as a single killer would be alright as map would be challenging for such a killer.
---
I do play both sides. Speak for yourself. The vast majority of toxicity I've seen is unwarranted face camping, perceived toxic-ness when survivors are just trying to loop, etc.
---
I have ran into survivors that teabag and flashlight click at every opportunity. But they are rare for me, since I'm a solo survivor I suppose.
---
Don't try to tell me what sides I do and don't play.
---
This just makes me sad. I'm a streamer as well, and I dont appreciate the hate this community gives to anybody with "ttv" in their name. But seeing this, it doesnt make me surprised that people hate to see ttv.
---
Welcome, please stick around to dbd, it's an enjoyable game, and we arent all bad.
---
He looks like a texture-less white blob in the show?
---
No, dont think so bud.
---
Yes, the community is like this because they have nothing to fear. 
---
Tbag? Yeah whatever
---
Facecamp? Yeah whatever
---
BHVR doesn't give a single fuck, until they don't punish people, this won't stop.
---
Of course I just levelled up Plague enough to get Infectious Fright.
---
Same can be said for survivor, why be toxic in the first place?
---
I'm the other way round really, I can still have a lot of fun with Apex, especially ranked mode, without feeling like I'm competing for a million dollars. Not Fortnite though. The thing with Fortnite is that everyone who plays it literally only plays that game, so I can't have casual fun I just get clapped with the latest meta that seems to change every 2 weeks.
---
Oof that is definitely one hell of a meme build
---
The screenshot is from steam.
---
As both a console player and a PC player, I can tell you, it's very unlikely to ever be on sale on the PSN or Xbox.  At most, maybe 10-20% but that's wishful thinking.
---
Shouldn't give survivors anything this is why they rage at other killers for not doing it
---
in the future, can i suggest that you go ahead and lead with what you said here? i'm actually interested in what you had to say here and i actually totally agree with you, but your initial comment wasn't super helpful, hence why i asked for clarification.
---
i appreciate you taking the time to reply! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
It's literally the same model, with less detail.
---
Clean your glasses bud
---
And I agree. Like it‚Äôs not fun for either party to be toxic to one another for no reason. It just. Ruins the game.
---
This has been a feature for a few months now, but it‚Äôs cool for anyone who didn‚Äôt know.
---
I don't think anyone would've thought the demogorgon possible a year ago. "Nothing is too big for us"
---
Yeah, so when are we getting ebony moris nerfed? When are survivors going to start bitching and moaning like killers did about MOM and DS?
---
Me except i won't let me plat KYF at all
---
I didn't know that ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yeah but it requires two rare items to be used. The game is basically balanced around swf rn anyways so it's really just a cute buff when you're unfortunate enough to be in solo.
---
I regret pouring everything in to the killer whom I can't play as
---
I love Bubba so much
---
The show actually sent them the rig, it‚Äôs not their design it‚Äôs the one Netflix used.
---
Its too harsh to punish people for that (like banning), bhvr probably probably go about it with the mentality of "dont be a toxic PoS" most of the issues i have is with swf who go super toxic like unnecessary flashlight,t bag, body blocking, and just being annoyances.
---
Oh my god, I love the gate tea bagging because it‚Äôs so satisfying to just use spirit to teleport behind them with NOED and hook them. Even more so if you have blood warden.
---
Look's pretty accurate to me. Look at season 1 demogorgon or end of season 3 demogorgon and compare. Dont compare to season 2 demo-dogs, as i believe they werent fully moulted yet.

---
Finally wow
---
Who do you wanna play as more? Nancy has the better perks but I levelled up Steve first because I rather play as him.
---
blendettes with new left behind
---
There is always soft-banning or post-game chat restriction like LoL.
---
The option for reporting for toxicity IS there. Too much reports? You can't play SWF for the next 3 games. 
---
Too much trash talk? Can't chat in post-game for 5 games.
---
Face-Camping and Tunneling every game? Queue times get longer for you. 
---
Getting too much soft-bans? Well, here's your perma-ban.
---
All of this can be added with dedicated servers, there's no excuse after that.
---
The option to report IS there for a reason after all.
---
He looks scary! What's he from?
---
You take his life, but he‚Äôll take yours too.
---
thanks chief, I'll keep some aside for a 750W, can't believe a game requires such a dramatic surge (no pun intended) to run or startup. Truly sickening when you see all the cosmetics they keep releasing rather than focusing on literally any other aspect of the core coding of the game.  
---
Thanks for your haste in resonding to this thread, much appreciated
---
It was impossible with the system they had before. At least so they said. So the moment dedicated servers came out it makes sense this would come out
---
it looks like a vortigaunt from half-life lol. I don't mind it.
---
Is breakdown worth it? Or iron will?
---
It's still impossible for the killers to deal with the organization of good teams. It's pigeon holes killer builds and killer choice.
---
A good team will depip an adept killer player with consistency, and unless balance is changed solo players will either get shit on, or have few chances to escape.
---
The game needs to have the competition factor, but it loses all fun when a killer is out matched, or vice versa.
---
When I did it I received an email within a day, it shouldn‚Äôt be too long. The email will be asking for info to load bloodpoints on to your account if the ticket was accepted.
---
He‚Äôs one version of the mascot for Iron Maiden
---
That would make a really good perk
---
menus are laggy as fuck and skill check pop ups are more choppy than usual for me on the X.
---
iron will is better, but jake is free so.... it‚Äôs up to you
---
Also body blocking isn't really toxicity. Getting a save is vital to the game, if you're in a position where you can blody block someone to prevent a hook, you should go for it.
---
Fair. I just feel BHRV would want a new killer instead of licensing after 2 licensed killers and survivors were added. Doing a new killer or survivor would bring something fresh and BHRV, imo, usually has better ideas for new killers and survivors compared to licensed.
---
Fucking same.

Unbreakable, flip flop, tenacity, boil over.
---
Solid shrine this week tbh
---
This is a very toxic community. Last night I was playing The Pig and in the endgame chat I was told, "Oink Oink bitch! Go kill yourself." Now that I think of it, it isn't just this community that is so toxic. It's mostly just humans in general that are pricks.
---
I would personally go Infectious Fright and Rancor is really good too. Idk if i even have the shards for one right now so i might not be able to choose myself.
---
Dope, he‚Äôs been hitting the weights it seems.
---
I think if you play a match it will give it to you. I did the tutorials and got 50k bp and it didn‚Äôt automatically distribute it but when I played a match it gave it to me with the points I got from the match. 
---
I know the tutorial isn‚Äôt the same as the shrine but I think you should test it
---
Ok
---
1 person DCing at the start as they get downed isn't enough to throw the game, so having someone in your rank with knowledge comparable to your level isn't either.
---
3 solo players can beat the killer if they all play well, so a 3man SWF with a solo is still going to be tough for the killer.
---
okay i will give it a shot thanks
---
Nope. Dedicated servers have been delayed
---
No idea what‚Äôs going on in this image.
---
How do you know when it's fully charged?
---
Pig is head and shoulders above Clown, Legion, Wraith imo
---
I expect it to be like Huntress.
---
Ace kinda stole his thunder
---
Why would it be unfair? Camping makes you lose more than actually playing the game.
---
It isn't fun seeing a survivor tbag you, but it also isn't fun expending the whole game on the hook with a Leatherface face camping you while revving his chainsaw.
---
No idea what‚Äôs going on. All i know if the sounds is... interesting to say the least.
---
It's an issue for me because I'll always hold shift to be ready to break away and will usually start running right as I throw the pallet. Now if I start running while also trying to throw pallet, prompt goes away and killer just runs on through for hit.
---
Nothing stops whispers from working- hooked, lockers, downed, healthy, etc. only stops when the sacrifice completes
---
How the actual fuck did you already prestige her?
---
Left is Infectious Fright, a killer perk that makes it so when a killer downs a survivor with an attack, any other survivors in the killer's terror radius scream and reveal their location. 
---
Right is Rancor, another killer perk that makes it so the killer is obsessed with a survivor, and every time a generator is done, the killer sees all survivors and the obsession sees the killer for a few seconds. When all the gens are done the killer can instantly down and kill the obsession.
---
Military Steve
---
No it's good, the more people complain about the more they are likely to fix it quickly
---
Can't wait for all the little blue hooked Steves.
---
Do it with the doctor, or another killer
---
But did you make the image after seeing the other one? This looks more like the equivalent of copy and pasting a paper but changing around some wording and sentences. Still plagiarism.

IKR, at least it‚Äôs somewhat balanced. Like you have really good gen pressure as you can just yoink someone of the gen from 100 metres away, then hook them on any hook you want

2000 for a shrine perk, 2700 if it's on the shrine for the first time.

Killers and survivors are 9000.

Skin prices for shards vary, but generally:

Common skin pieces: 900 shards

Uncommon skin pieces: 1800 shards

Rare skin pieces: 4500 shards

Very rare skin pieces: 7200 shards

---
Shining would be great, jack Nicholson  is a legend. One can hope.
---
They're good, they just don't stand out as a "gotta get it" skin.
---
Im saying it would be unfair if people got punished for being reported when they didnt do it due to no way of proving tunneling or camping (camping can be lroved but you already get punished for it by it lowering your chance at pipping)
---
‚ÄúUgh your suck a meg‚Äù

Why? This game is trash. Play literally solitaire if you want more enjoyment out of your time.
---
It‚Äôs a way for people to feel validated, there‚Äôs not much beating around the bush. As long as they‚Äôre getting enjoyment out of it how they look really doesn‚Äôt cross their minds.
---
B*tch I‚Äôm fabulous!
---
Literally love Jane but the motherfuckers wheezing when she runs for like four seconds like damn Jane I know you thicc af but calm down
---
Head On, Lithe, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard. If you're lucky, you'll get to use one per chase, and confuse the heck out of your killer
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Vigil, Hope, Open-Handed, Sole Survivor. Some of the weakest perks in the game, and therefore some of the most unexpected (NOTE: Unexpected does not always mean they'll be useful)
---
Calm Spirit, Left Behind, Mettle of Man, Deja Vu. Give thanks to BHVR for trying to improve their game by using perks that have had major nerfs/buffs since their initial release
---
WRAITH BUILD: Sloppy Butcher, Thanatophobia, Whispers, Dark Sense. Try to have all four survivors injured at once - don't down them or hook them, just slap the first survivor and move on to the next one. With Self Care, medkits, and the new Inner Strength, it's harder than you think
---
No Mither. Just No Mither. Bonus points for running it on a character that's not traditionally known for being super tough and resilient (it's one of the first perks I unlocked for Nancy, and No Mither Nancy is one of the weirdest runs I've played in a while)

You gotta get shirt and shorts I‚Äôm sorry but it‚Äôs ritual. Shirt looks weird without shorts and shorts look weird without shirt. But you can live without the hat. Remember Steve when he‚Äôs like ‚Äúscrew company policy‚Äù he looks as sexy as that.

He‚Äôs not called Steve ‚ÄúThe Hat‚Äù Harrington!

Not working for me on ps4 for survivor
---
1. David used his unique perk, Dead Hard, to gain a half-second of invincibility and ignore your attack
---
2. David clipped through the ground, because the new map probably still has a few bugs like that
---
3. David (and the person on the hook) disconnected from the match
---
Spirit's unfair and you know it. I hate having to swap to Luigi to counter ghost killers. Counter-picking in general sucks.
---
EPIC RANK DIFFERENCES
---
I think we need new game mechanics to make perks around. I could see some perks based on the Endgame Collapse that are pretty simple being added.
---
But overall, they've done a pretty good job at mixing in simple perks with the new ones. Using Nancy as an example, her new Inner Strength perk has a lot of numbers to it and changes your playstyle a lot, while Poised and Better Together can both be described in two sentences, and don't change your playstyle much unless you synergize it with other playstyle changing perks like Sprint Burst or Prove Thyself.
---
True, but then that requires 2 perk slots just to bring the game up to what should be a base state for those killers :|
---
I work 9:00-5:00 I just played during my lunch
---
Y'all making dan schneider jokes
---
But what about that second autodidact perk
---
Not everyone cares about ranking up, so the pip thing isn't enough. 
---
Ranking is another issue, everyone can get to Rank 1 with time, even the worst killers/survivors. As of now, Ranking doesn't mean anything. 
---
Also, yeah, I suppose it would be hard to prove that you're tunneling. 
---
If they really wanted to commit, they could add a replay system like LoL and manually watch the gameplay from the perspective of the killer and the survivor who was supposedly tunneled, but maybe that's way too much work.
---
Even if Infectious is a better perk I would choose Rancor because of how useful it is for killer dailies (kill a survivor yourself with [killer])
---
People are toxic. Coded ones and zeros aren‚Äôt. Js.
---
Me and my friend had the same issues. The lobby either froze while connecting to a game or we got matched with killers that were literally newbies (rank 19/20). In the past two hours we managed to play three games. What helped was to completely restart the application.
---
And mixed textures? If a trap bridges two different textures, which does it choose? Transparent would work best as it will be more consistent regardless of surrounding textures, grass, etc.
---
We don‚Äôt have the new servers yet so it‚Äôs not that. I had the same daily change on me tho
---
CLAUDETTE WHERE WERE YOU THAT ENTIRE MATCH?
---
Doing Gens, you?
---
God what a meme that video was
---
Yeah, what's your point? Banning isn't a valid option? What else then? Talk to then and hope they stop being toxic?
---
It is too much work for a smaller company i guess
---
I would just want Chris Pratt as a survivor from this
---
What'd you do exaactly to get him so butthurt?
---
While I agree that this is not a reportable offense I still side with the other person. It‚Äôs not only unsportsmanlike but also scummy to go all after one or two survivors while leaving the others. That‚Äôs actually pretty scummy.
---
Well, they are getting bigger with time, just look at the licensed products they are getting and the companies they are involving themselves with.
---
I hope that someday they get big enough to do something like that. I like this game and it can be way better, just gotta give it some time and some love.
---
You have to unlock it on laurie first...
---
I kind of hate the struggle mechanic, I don't really understand why it's a thing.
---
When you swung at David, he had actually unhooked the Nea. You turned around to hit the David but he was too far away and you auto locked onto the Nea. The David ran all the way up the top of the stairs and ran away. You then went to mori the Nea but she dc'd
---
My second match was absolutely great I even recorded it
---
For background information - It was my first time playing on the new map, and it was while I was doing two dailies for Nurse. I wasn‚Äôt planning on letting anyone live, but the two Nacys were the last two alive. They gave up and stopped running from me so I decided to let them live and finish the last two gens.
---
Once you unlock the ‚Äúteachable‚Äù version of DS on Laurie, DS will start to appear in the blood webs of other survivors
---
Understandable it just gets a little frustrating having to carry the team at times.
---
... The point.. was the game isn‚Äôt toxic, it‚Äôs the people who abuse it. There‚Äôs a reason why people lobby dodge and use mlga to block people. Some people just need to grow the hell up.
---
At levels 30, 35, and 40 the three perks each appear to be learned as teachable, the icons are orange when they appear at this level. Laurie's Decisive appears at level 40, once you unlock it it'll then randomly appear in the bloodwebs of other survivors to unlock. Meaning you'll have to level up Dwight until it appears by chance at any given level after it's unlocked in Laurie's bloodweb.
---
A real life baby Dwight. The legends!
---
It's not that serious in my opinion
---
I guess.
---
The fact you get downvoted for this speaks volumes for the skillful of this sub.
---
Not serious but there was no need for it. Same with changing invite settings on skill your friends.
---
Oh yeah, maybe chose the wrong words. 
---
I said this game was toxic because the community has always been like this (was even worse back then), I didn't mean the game itself was toxic.

A dev confirmed on stream that was a rumour.

Apparently he only joined a month or two into development but swf was always planned, it was just a ton of extra work to do when the game was completed much quicker without it.

isnt this post warranted for removal for being posted literally every other week since DbD came out
---
It doesn't, you gotta kick the gen
---
I'd guess it is a thing to do with the new swf system. Its as if every game you host as survivor will be a swf game.
---
That's not how the entity works though, it knows everything that happens in it's realm and controls what does and doesn't happen. It wants the games to commence, if it wanted to it could just kill all the survivors whenever it wanted. There is no threat to the entity, it let the guy experiment because it was interested in him, just like how it let Vigo's creations stay in the realm (tool boxes, flashlights, maps, hatch, etc).
---
I main Quentin because hes so handsome and well dressed and he moans nicely when injured.
---
As for the killer its 50/50 Legion and Freddy. Legion has good power despide being nerfed af and really nice design (Frank one love). Freddy is...im a NOES fan, I can't resist. Also dream snares and fake pallets are a thing, along with gen teleport. Im glad they made him fun to play as and against, hes good.
---
I feel that Claustrophobia is way too powerful. Maybe if it made it so that the Killer couldn't see the basement hooks while carrying you or making the Survivor struggle stronger while nearing the basement it would be better. Other than that, this looks like a great character and I'd love to see it in the game!
---
You husband now.
---
Not really exaggerated at all but ok.
---
coming from an absolute avp fanatic, i dont think there should be any chapter with either of them. they arent at regular "killer" levels
---
any of the predators weapons would be insanely op. youd also have to deal with thermal vision and his cloak which we already have in the game. you also couldnt have the lore make sense. 
---
the aliens signature abilities are scaling terrain, and sensing enemies through terrain. both of these would be insanely broken, and if not implemented, he wouldnt even be the alien.
---
I was not aware of the first picture's existence until one of the commenters pasted it on this post. [If the "people" must ABSOLUTELY KNOW I pasted Ash over this exact picture.

Nah don't worry about it, it's not something the game teaches you, just gotta work on it when you can! At least you even know pallet saves are a thing! It's so frustrating watching people crouch near you when they could have got the save!

Is that really his campfire pose/animation? Well damn, goes quite well with him.
---
I'm saying that looping doesn't need to be as strong as it is, and stealthing/map control/etc. on the killer side needs to be more in the gameplay. Basically, what I'm trying to say is that stealth, looping, etc. etc. all need to be equally a part of this game, and not just looping being viable. That way, stealth killers can be anti-stealth, anti-loop killers can still anti-loop, etc. etc., so each killer focuses on or is a detriment to a part of the game.

I got hate mail for being a baby Dwight, i will never switch survivors, baby Dwight forever
---
There was the Entity on each hook in the screenshot, 2 alives and 1 DC with 4 yellow hooks aura, 1 survivor hooked and 1 more hook at mid-right too
---
Bruh, I haven't played killer in so long I went all the way down to rank 18, went up against purple rank survivors SWF stacked with 1 green rank. It was the easily the most confusing experience I have ever had, especially when I brought in my baby ghostface.
---
Infectious Friiiiight! So hyped for that one!
---
I got M&amp;A in my second bloodweb but I STILL can‚Äôt get it with Myers
---
Reasonable because then the Legion perk that gives extra struggle would be a counter to this.

Had a game like this with trappler.  I nearly ran out of hooks at the in.  Imagine having to down people enough to get 12 separate hooks.
---
The Scoops ahoy outfit is a separate $10 outfit, yes.
---
Could you imagine being salty because of people asking a question?
---
DS can be denied by not tunneling, deadhard can be countered by not swinging early, deliverance can be countered by being hooked first, unbreakable can be countered by not slugging. I don‚Äôt think survivors are the root of unhealthy gameplay issues ...
---
Why do people go into a match and them do other things? I've found so many crow covered survivors. Who message me later like "I was getting a drink I and you killed me" I'm like..... ok....
---
There‚Äôs rumours about it but no one is too sure. But the devs are very aware of Pennywise but it‚Äôs hard getting licensing and making a killer. For instance pennywise is pretty much like the entity and has control over the mind and can make you see shit. Very powerful so they‚Äôd have to dumb him down. Plus there already is a clown but I guess Myers and Ghostface are similar.
---
Not on console there is a way to dc without losing items or blood points it‚Äôs abused enough as is so I dont want to say how
---
Plead some more
---
Yeah FPS has plumetted on my end, PS4.
---
The game‚Äôs matchmaking is completely flawless in every way
---
I got all three adepts with no issues
---
Yeah I've noticed that. I've had some pretty rough matches where it feels like the killer/survivors are just running circles around me (literally when I'm the killer, boy do I feel dumb), but I've also had some strange games. Had a trapper who killed two of us, left just started a loop of downing a survivor, picking them up, stepping in his traps to drop us, and then repeating. 
---
I'm assuming it was some sort of BP grinding behaviour, but after a solid 10 minutes of trying to avoid that shit, heal the other survivor and hit the last two gens, he ended up killing the other survivor, then carried me to the exit gate, and just... watched me open it and leave. It was fucking terrifying to be honest.
---
Ye but also the dlc should also have like 2 characters
---
Happening for me too D:
---
Same here on Xbox.  We need a hotfix ASAP!
---
Im stuck behind a work firewall, is there anywhere with the patch notes posted/written out? 
---
Would be awesome to have something to read while i wait out the remaining 210 minutes at work till i can go home and play...
---
...209 minutes! aww yes
---
Yep same.
---
I bought the DLC like 2 minutes ago :'(
---
Same here, just came to make a post if there wasn't one already..
---
I‚Äôve only played against it once, and the person using it was none too skilled so I can‚Äôt speak to how good the Demogorgon actually is. The terror radius being messed with when the Demogorgon takes a portal was weird at first, but didn‚Äôt really do anything to catch me off guard. From watching people play it in the PTB, it seems really strong around the shack, and using Shred when survivors are in the open or forced into long halls seems great.
---
I haven't been able to connect to a single host when playing solo survivor. It'll say there was an issue connecting to the host before booting me out of he pormpt, putting me back in, then freezing me on 'Connecting.'

no thats the part where the solo D/Cs after his first down before even getting hooked and then the SWF get rekt the rest of the game

I played like 4 games before I went to work without any issues. On PC for the record.
---
Well that was a lie
---
They should be asking themselves the golden quest: If gens don't pop fast, why does every single killer (that's not the top 3) have to run ruin?
---
It's bullshit. Why does she come to a standstill before she's about to ambush? Demo can walk forward while he charging up his lounge, Ghostface can walk forward while he's in shroud, Wraith can move while he's cloaked, Billy still moves when he's revving up the chainsaw. But the Pig stops all movement before the ambush is unleashed. 
---
And like you said, Ghostface can crouch just as fast as a survivor, but the Pig crouches like a 80 year old in a commercial, while the devs give us some bullshit "Pig's crouch speed increased by .0025%" foolishness that they made up months ago. As if they expected Pig mains to go "Oh wow what a buff - she's high tier now!".
---
They created her with shit addons, they gave her only a few base reverse bear traps thus making you have to use said shit-addons,  they made said reverse bear traps RNG dependent then got defensive and flat out lied when people correctly said that their traps were coded to give survivors a much higher probability of finding the key in first or second box, they made said lackluster ambush not count as stacks for actual useful perks, they stripped her endgame, and now they are making it so that even if a survivor has the exposed effect that the damn ambush doesn't down them. Just what the fuck.
---
They don‚Äôt want the game banned in some other countries
---
You could have just been being a blendette and pissed everyone off honestly. It may be that they weren't teaming, but they came together over their mutual hatred of you. They also could have been teaming tho. I just see scenario 1 a lot more than actual teaming.

It‚Äôs just annoying to me. It‚Äôs a bit of an eye sore.
---
One of my completed ones was replaced. Still had the other two tho
---
Urban is so damn op
---
Oh nvm it was buggy
---
lmao
---
***ahoy ladies!***
---
I'm like half asleep I'm sorry I didnt see it untill now
---
Wasn't locked before, you're mistaking it for someone else.
---
Gj then.
---
It's not just toxic play if you're really good especially as killer you are expected to let survivors go. Now I don't agree with killing all survivors every time but it is definitely the choice of the killer he does not have to give the hatch to anybody. I get messages all the time for killing all survivors or a Survivor who got off the hook and literally ran into my chest.

That second Steve one with the shades and the bat on his back would be sick

I managed to get Steve just fine on XB1
---
So I think it's really sucky that I have to pay an extra $10 for this outfit
---
Same here! I was shook

He let you get points, he didn't have to do that. It seems though you're pretty entitled
---
I wanna be green man
---
Yeah but Steve &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jonathan so I like it this way lol
---
I just had a glitch where I dropped a firecracker and blinded a killer. Since I was close to it, I got deafened. However, the deafness persisted throughout the whole game.
---
omg thank you so much for this, i can read them now :D
---
Constant host unreachables and disconnects. Seems they released their update waaaay too early and a free weekend of crashes isn't going to attract much of shit :|
---
I recognize that huntress cosplay from last week, I guess you‚Äôre the one in the scoops outfit then

Ah yes, because it's such THRILLING GAMEPLAY for survivors to hold m1, let's make them hold it EVEN LONGER.
---
You ain't even wrong.
---
r/subsifellfor
---
He can still get a decent amount of bloodpoints farming 3 survs.
---
Chance to escape for them is virtually none if 5 gens are up.
---
Looks amazing!
---
Hell no! I live in germany. While taking the pics an old lady stalked me, just waiting for call the police XD
---
I prestiged him and am yet to get it :c
---
Baby killer here, I don't see it being nerfed tbh. If anything I feel it'll be buffed first to work better with head on
---
Ahh shit, here we go again
---
Yes happened to me and my buddy. Where you playing in a swf?
---
They better fix matchmaking and disconnects before then.
---
Going to take some getting used to lol
---
It's fixed now. Tried and lost my items. Not sure about bloodpoints tho
---
Huh, but I didn't steal their meme. Anyways, if you're going by this logic then tell the OP of the other post that they "stole the meme" from the original creator of the "Big Coat Season" meme as well then.

Fourth, she works so hard to achieve her goals to become an artist. If you are going to be negative, be negative towards me, not her. 
---
Fifth and final one, Those comments show how toxic the DBD community really is. That‚Äôs all I got to say, peace ‚úåÔ∏è
---
Ok Thanks the way its worded and the way they put out the videos made me think they were coming with the pack
---
Yep.
---
Nothing implied that and it has never worked that way
---
The servers are acting up. Half my matches, we lose at least 1 person, sometimes the killer.
---
Are you standing on top of one and looking at the portal you want to go to
---
Context - It was 30~ seconds into the match when this happened.
---
Other Context - I've had 4 disconnects in a row trying to get this Legion Mori daily done, running low of moris, please send bloodpoints.
---
I don't care what it looks like however it does concern me that he seems to have some back problems
---
You need to stand on one and then look at the others. They will have red arrows above them. You can only traverse from one portal to another. 
---
Another thing to note is that survivors can not see your portals until you use them once. Once they are active, the Survivors can see and destroy them.
---
Nice camping build
---
Well, that‚Äôs just arousing.
---
It really is. I am so done with this game until it can get its shit together.
---
You inspired me to not be nice to survivors anymore lol
---
I marked NSFW because of language
---
I kinda hope he has something to do with tag. He's an awesome character and I'd love to see him again
---
Yeah, if two people leave at that point I will let them leave if they have any item usually but imo you can make a decent ammount of points in a 3 man team, even tho probably you won't escape. I should edit the post and mention that I do not blame those people is an understandable point since they have a ruined game for something out of their control.
---
It has been broken for a long time. This is a common problem.
---
Where are the gens???
---
I've seen the three times in the last 5 mins. I feel like I missed something
---
hag is alot of fun, good perks to unlock as teachables. Leatherface also for BBQ and chili perk
---
Leatherface
---
Leather face for his team perk. The nightmare is pretty fun to play as but not really the best.
---
1) It's close enough.
---
2) Congrats. Maybe lurk more and learn?
---
3) Welcome to the internet.
---
4) That's great. I hope she achieves her goals. You'll notice everybody commented on your post, not on her profile page. So they were negative towards you, not her.
---
5) Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
Each character has their 3 special perks. If you level them up to 30-40 you'll find orange versions of those in their blood webs. Then when you play a different character, you'll have a chance of finding that unlocked perk in their blood web. So if you want DS you have to level Laurie up enough to unlock that perk, then play Dwight until it shows up in his blood web. Also check the Shrine of Secrets every week for perks that will unlock on after purchase.
---
Stranger Things DLC because the Demogorgon is a great fuckin killer or Leatherface for the perks. Ghostface is pretty fun too, and Freddy is supposedly one of the best after the rework.
---
Spirit, imo is a bit strong

I don't think you need skill to play any killers.  
---
More like experience.
---
I could never land a lunge on the PTB
---
One guy uses this format and everyone jumps on the bandwagon
---
It might be a problem on your end, since they can connect to one another but you cannot?
---
Same on Xbox. Also have been mysteriously losing BP all day. Every time I have to restart the game, it doesn‚Äôt save my progress.
---
Truth be told, this video came from the sub Reddit funny.... I reposted
---
No it‚Äôs like...really bad now. I‚Äôm a rank 5 getting matched with brand new players all day.
---
Low level killers who don't have better perks on their bloodwebs yet maybe?
---
Running different perks, change up the playstyle you usually go for. Makes the game more fun in the long run
---
I don't really want to go into the discussion about Self Care, but 99% yourself to keep using perks like Resilience has always been an option so Second Wind "abuse" probably wouldn't be that OP. The perk can only activate twice a match anyways.
---
He's a pretty bad killer, basically an M1 killer if survivors know how to loop.  If you have bbq, he's not necessary unless you want knock out or franklins too
---
It's a bug. When someone walks over hatch (or where it appear at) it opens. I had a game with 5 gens 4 survivors that ended in 1 minute because I walked over where hatch was going to spawn 10 seconds into the game. I ended up letting them go even if I had NOED
---
Only the first part for me. It‚Äôs universal on Xbox for some reason idrfk
---
same here
---
There are always bonus cosmetics when you buy the full chapter from the platform store. But no, not the full outfits like Scoops. They want to make actual money from those.
---
It's insanely detailed that is for sure
---
good thank you thought it was just me started to freak out.
---
That anesthetist doctor outfit looks [thicc](/intensifies)
---
This happened to me literally ten minutes ago. Was so confused when the game ended lol
---
My first match was a tunneling Wraith who played an Autohaven offering...
---
True
---
wait I thought it was channel
---
Same... my 4 friends and I are stuck there.
---
I'm getting the same thing. Is the server down?
---
Looks like servers are down right now. I'm having the same issue. https://downdetector.com/status/dead-by-daylight
---
Nope
---
Yes, but not skins they advertised for weeks knowing they could make a fortune on.
---
You mean having the same metas for over a year at a time? Mercy making or breaking matches. yeah loads of diversity there too
---
I like hair gel and ice cream
---
Steve
---
Same here fam
---
Tru3Talent made a good point about this perk
---
even if it was mapwide it still wouldn't be that great
---
Say theres 1-2 gens everyone is working on you get -16% mapwide versus pop goes the weasel -25% on the gen you want
---
You'd have to hit 3 gens with a mapwide range to make it even 24% which is still less but about the same as pop
---
[here](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us).  I‚Äôm having the same issue on Xbox. Submitted a ticket myself.
---
LOL THE PERSON TALKING SHIT IS RANK 14!!!! 
---
Omg that's great
---
Haters gonna hate guys best piece of advice I got is dont fucking worry about it have a good time and play what you likr
---
I don't care how overdone this meme is for this game, I will upvote it every single time.
---
I feel it even more today than normal. Today is my birthday and it's been a really rough day that is nearing its 14 hour mark at work. And I'm too broke to get the dlc right now too. Great day
---
Servers is having problems right now
---
exactly the same for me on that part too
---
No. I said that. But the OP wasn‚Äôt technically wrong. They heard there would be alternate pieces, and that part was true.
---
I can connect to people and them to me, but some of my friends can‚Äôt connect to anyone with the new friends lobby...
---
I want to take iron will from Jake to start leveling my survivor that i am going to use. I have him at level 10.Is it more efficient to level Jake to take his teachables or take it from shrine of shards?
---
Right, literally every killer is the same, no one is unique? Seriously? Every killer is different you cant face a Doctor like you do a Plague or Nightmare. You can say that about literally any game lmao
---
Servers are fucked right now, most people are just crashing out of lobbies.
---
You still watch Rupaul's Drag race and it's the same season after season.
---
Same, ruined my grind.
---
They had to do this because they reached the trophy limit.
---
I don't see a problem with it I mean you have to cleanse a totem as soon as the match and remember that there is 3 other greedy bastards so best move quick
---
That might be because PlayStation limits how many trophies a hand has, so to get around it maybe they just made another list?
---
Dying Light has been know to crash some games so try to avoid using that.
---
It needs to be tied to the TR, and raise the regression to at least 10%. Devs like to forget that there are people with higher skill than them who play the live version of this game.

Games bugged right now, if someone dies second hook with certain killers the game just ends.
---
Was that a Josuke pose.
---
Was this after the update? People get mad when it's not the new killer haha
---
same here...
---
Yah I just did a match and did allot of stuff with it being a 15-20min game and 2 of us made it out alive and I only got 9k points and burned a escape cake and I have my objective maxed out, survival was a few hundred, my altruism was at 75% and boldness was maxed....
---
This is a PlayStation issue, not a dbd issue.
---
Yeah. I never saw Inner Strength as more than a gimmick. People saw "heal in 8 seconds when you destroy ruin" and freaked out but that's the best case scenario. Mostly I'm gonna find a totem on accident to activate it, and when I get in a chase, if I'm hit and ignored, I have to spend time to find a locker. Don't get me wrong, when I unlock it on Kate (main), I'm gonna try it out just like I do most new perks. But the 3-4 games I did as Nancy before I ran out of cakes and moved onto Steve, it was never better than just letting my teammate heal me or self healing via a medkit.
---
Most SWF suck. They're really just Brown rank solos. I had a two man SWF who used a key and escaped while I got hooked a second time. They said "don't unhook when a killer is near". I unhooked, took the hit, the asshole stood there instead of running. He used DS to get away. Then they proceeded to unhook me right next to the killer, who was camping the entire match. Ibdidn3 gens, they did 1. They unhooked the other solo survivor right next to the killer. They got downed and inevitably quit. It's ok, I'll get them back, I'm a killer main and those dudes were garbage.
---
On what? Im fine for now at least
---
What the fuck is a Yamcha?  One of them Pok√´mons?
---
UHH I MIGHT . SOMEWHERE. LEMME SEE......
---
You have to put more than one down, then stand on one while looking at the one you want to go to. If you channel your power, you can see if anyone is near your portals.
---
You clearly don't watch, queen
---
Servers are prob down check back in a while your computer is fine
---
nah. No point in getting it twice.
---
Its really small, like really really small. But at the same time theres tons of places to hide and theres multiple floorsaking hiding even easier. I actually teally like it as a survivor because its really fun. I imagine distressing builds are really strong on it but any killer that needs clear vision is going to be severely gimped.
---
Nea's blue 80s hair lookin' fabulous however.
---
Ew, a mod that is gonna talk smack about a game they don't play? Bye.
---
Ya it was my first game back after the update lmao
---
We on here cryin bro
---
*~~Laughs~~ cries in 2:30-11pm job*
---
Woooooow. Good job devs making broken game !
---
Definitely something going on. I keep crashing when I hook someone every other game, frames get whacky once in a while, and people get kicked from my games too.
---
Not really, hooks spawn close enough together where the odds of it being useful are very, very low.
---
Running it with friends and sabotage however is a nightmare for the killer
---
It‚Äôs stays at 8.
---
Shhh, not broken, just hardcore mode
---
It was a joke, because Nancy was the one that escaped.
---
Basically what happened is that for whatever reason, after the first Nancy d/c'ed, the hatch spawned, despite there being two other live and walking survivors, and Nancy was allowed to escape and the game ended there.
---
Oops. I was playing Legion earlier for his ritual. I am sorry to whoever expected demo
---
Did you see his new haircut?
---
god why are these perks legitimately good concepts
---
That‚Äôs a really good point, what if I myself brought Jake and started sabotaging early? And about how long are the hooks unusable?
---
FLEX ON 'EM DWEET
---
That makes sence
---
Damn really? What a weird bug, my games down now too was wondering if it had something to do with that
---
I'm gonna chalk it down to lack of map knowledge for that for sure. I still don't think the perk will be strong but I want to try it out once I know maps better
---
Not a good map for Billy :)
---
Wot
---
You should ask for refund cause u broke
---
Love how she drew 2 killers! That must be hard to fit in.
---
Yeah I guess but memes
---
I have been using my controls for so long it would throw me off to use the regular controls. Its just L1 is such an awkward button to run with and so I had to readjust everything accordingly
---
True. But in all honesty i like the perk a lot because of the potential with other perks like the new DL, and Thanatophobia and pop. It is pretty weak by itself but i personallity find itll be more useful then other perks in quite tired of using.
---
I feel like the ptb did nothing the only change they made that people wanted was buffing surge they didn't buff any of his other perks, remove the shadow people, buff dying light, or anything else the majority asked for.
---
Cannot connect! :(
---
I had this happen, bought the DLC and the download button did nothing, once I started up the game aftee the update downloaded however it was installed, not sure how though
---
I mean, killers like Billy and Huntress have always been at a disadvantage on indoor maps. However I havent gotten to play the map myself yet to see it
---
Worst player I came across today was a rank 20 Nea who threw a pallet down and teabagged. I caught and hooked her. She got saved from the hook and I was a decent ways away. I started to head that direction and saw her running towards me. I caught her and she got saved again, then I caught her a third time and she died. We finished the match and she went off in the chat about how I tunneled and her teammates farmed. 
---
The funny thing is she teabagged at the pallet but then couldn‚Äôt loop me at all. Anyone can throw a pallet down. Looping the killer around is the part that takes skill.
---
Humm... may i ask you,
---
How exactly is it scummy?
---
Ahh yes the leaf and... broken coat hanger?
---
That‚Äôs really weird wtf. I‚Äôve never seen that happen before.
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt get it. Hard joke to get
---
Yikes
---
What all the perks ? There‚Äôs not that many,it‚Äôs only Ruin and Pop Goes the Weasel.
---
Your not gonna use thanaphobia unless you‚Äôre Plague or Legion and your not gonna use surveillance unless your Ghostface or Maybe Freddy and Pig.
---
Where are the many perks you speak of ? Corrupt Intervention?Lullaby ? Thrilling Tremors?
---
Nobody is gonna use that because they suck.
---
Corrupt: you can go do another Gen.
---
Lullaby:Since your always looking at the screen it‚Äôs useless.
---
Tremors:it only last for 16 sec which is nothing and it has a cooldown 
---
Gens are Fast and the can be even a faster with Survivors perks I don‚Äôt need to cite those since I think your already too familiar with them.
---
Before dedicated Servers(and rank Reset) Waiting for a match with Killer usually took 5-10 mins. At Red Ranks.
---
I had it easy,some people have to wait for 20-30min.
---
Only for the Match to end in 4-5 Min by good survivors or SWF
---
That sucks and gens without perks to boost the repair speed,they still get done pretty fast.
---
That‚Äôs without adding a terrible map for a killer, a chase can cost 1-3 gens(3 if they decide to power trough Ruin).
---
You had me in the first half,not gonna lie,but saying gens are not fast means you don‚Äôt play against Good Survivors or SWF.
---
Yeah Ive had a different bug every game. Now my friend and I cant find games without one of us being kicked due to hodt unreachable or join game failure. Been like this for 30 min. Its funny how the new system means we dont have to send invites every game but in reality we pretty much still do. I expected qeue times to be near instant but they are pretty much how they have been for a long time. They shouldnt release updates that break the game
---
That's how it works for most of the DLCs. Cheaper option to buy pieces but as a bundle you save money and get a little bonus.
---
However said "little bonuses" have been getting worse and worse. Before they added the in-game cosmetics store you'd get whole secondary outfits. (These used to just be general alternative outfits that were moved to being DLC exclusive when the option to purchase characters individually was added.) But when Clown and Kate were added all buying the DLC would get you is a white dress for Kate instead of her black one.
---
This was then followed by Adam who got a slightly different vest, Jeff who got a slightly darker jacket with a different coloured shirt &gt;!(I actually don't have Jeff's DLC purchase cosmetic; I grinded Shards to get Jeff and Legion. To my understanding though it looks about the same as one of the recolours you can purchase in the store)!&lt;, Jane got a floral shirt which tbh looks like they got their texture off a stock image site, Ash got a barely noticeable recolour of his hand, and now Steve and Nancy get their base clothing with rip textures photoshopped onto them.
---
The exception to this problem was Ghostface who got a white hood but... I'm not going to wear bright white on a Stealth killer, thanks.
---
I know that the old cosmetics were from a time when the characters were all paid but I really wish we'd go back to that instead of these crappy recolours. Or at least if we're going to get recolours let them be *actual recolours* that people will notice. While I'd never wear Kate or Ghostface's bright white cosmetics at least they look unique? But Jeff and Ash's exclusives are barely noticeable, and Adam and Jane have their undershirts recoloured which means the Killer won't even see your cosmetic while running after your back.
---
I'm just saying it wouldn't kill them to give us a blue shirt instead of one that's a slightly darker shade of brown.
---
That'd be to good man. Not in a way of being too powerful but that well never get a gen regression perk on the same level as ruin.
---
Yah pussys on PS4 already started that camping bs with the demogorgons and tunneling like crazy! DS is now permanently equipped &amp; narrowed time and has been for over a month now. BhVR needs to really crack down on the amount of people camping. It‚Äôs gotten to the point it‚Äôs every other game now, people just refuse to play the game as it was designed and to lazy to try and play the right way. It‚Äôs ruining the game...
---
They're keeping it worldwide. Meaning too much gore and China is outta here.

New best tactic,  camp the camper, I like it.
---
I cleaned the portal right when the game started cause I spawned next to him and the white squares appeared. I thought that was weird cause I‚Äôve been playing all day and usually only particles pop up so I chalked it up to an add on. I cleared the portal and it was still on my screen. 
---
Then I got hit and my screen just went nuts. I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore because it was near impossible to locate pallets and keep track of the killer so I instantly left. So frustrating
---
Really? I played overwatch until moira came out, then I got bored from overplaying. My friend said "Oh mercy is still meta defining all this time" which has been horseshit i guess. I have a question: how is that new character baptiste? Looked really fun and I was thinking about hopping back into the game to se how it was

Oh hey, I know you I think. Were you playing in chapel?

The fucked MM is why I haven‚Äôt played in a long time.  Was hoping this patch would have fixed it but evidently it has not.

definitely longer than normal. But I figured it was just a lot of people playing rn. but I have been crashing out of lobby‚Äôs a lot
---
I hear you, I'm probably still going to use it 
---
I think it's cool seeing the gens pop and when I was playing survivor and a demo did that to me it jumped me a bit
---
So I read through the changes and see nothing about dedicated servers, were they added or no?
---
Hi friend on the hook here, I messed up the struggle from laughing too hard ü§£

Not in my region ? What‚Äôs the sale
---
If you're still in game go to options then under the help &amp; tutorials tab there is a customer support option. If not then imma sure you could just google dead by daylight customer support.
---
Now we just need someone to camp the camper camper.
---
But why
---
Without using the perk sabo: Hooks are down 3 minutes: with sabo equipped 4 min 30 seconds. Unless you have coordination sabo can be a time waster for YOU more than the killer.
---
Sneak 100
---
3 minutes by default IIRC.  Note that if a Breakdown/Sabo meta ever returned to play (early days of DBD were dominated by Sabo before hook regeneration became a thing), there is a killer perk that absolute hard counters it (Which is why Sabo meta will pretty much never return).  Hangman's Trick makes a broken hook repair in 10 seconds.  I don't know if it overrides Sabotage (which adds +30 seconds to the timer) completely, or just massively neuters it (By making it a 40 second to hook restore vs 3 minutes 30 seconds)
---
reddit is being drowned with complains from players, its obvious its from the game, they should fix it, i thought i might just state it out for everyone to stop thinking it's their own fault
---
just dont log off
---
Yah that‚Äôs the only time I will run it, is with friends and we start saboing hooks left and right, plus if your playing random solo and depending on your rank you might just be left on first hook to die...
---
This is wholesome
---
What the McFuck^TM

It will end up just like MoM so I say a month tops.

How long until Steve and his perks are reworked? First of all they need to fire who ever was in charge of the voice acting decisions. He‚Äôs so overly whiney, loud, and out of character it‚Äôs ridiculous. Steve does not whimper and whine that way. And second, they need to change Second Wind. It‚Äôs virtually like MoM in the sense that the requirements to use it are so hard to meet it‚Äôs not even worth it anymore. Cooperative healing doesn‚Äôt count for Second Wind but it does for Aftercare? Is that a bug? You literally can‚Äôt use two of his perks together or it doesn‚Äôt make sense. (Babysitter And Second Wind) Why the heck do you have to solo heal someone just to use it? And even then there were times where people were going out of their way for entire round to try and meet the requirements to no avail. Camaraderie also has drawbacks. It literally TELLS the killer when someone is 16 meters or less from a hooked survivor in phase 2. Something that‚Äôs supposed to help against camping killers literally gives them more reason to do so, because they see the special bar under their hooked icon that gives it away. (Like Legion with the old Deep wounds bars when they could see a persons bleed out) 
---
Even Babysitter isn‚Äôt the greatest, if the killer has Make Your Choice you‚Äôre basically fucked. You can‚Äôt combine it with We‚Äôll Make it because then the killer just sees you healing. I‚Äôm just really disappointed with his perks. I hated Steve in Season 1. But by the end of Season 3 I liked him WAY more than I like Nancy. (Kinda disliked her by the end of Season 3) It just doesn‚Äôt make sense that she got 3 decent perks and Steve got KIND OF one.
---
Well its takin a decade to fo anything so maybe i shouldnt have said anything lmao
---
I‚Äôm not talking about wait time to get in game I‚Äôm still updating.
---
same
---
Oh yeah. Can't have a perk that is both non-destroyable and effective at gen delays, can we?
---
I‚Äôll be quitting too if this keeps up. Which sucks because I‚Äôve enjoyed this game and it‚Äôs rare that I find a new game that I put a lot of time into.
---
I‚Äôve had so many campers since the rank reset
---
You need to reopen the game (either that or verify game integrity) forgot which

Another gay just wanting attention. Gives the rest of us a bad name. Did you not get enough love as a child?
---
I jumped in a frikkin' locker to avoid a lunge. Was fully inside the locker, door closed when he actually landed. I still got hit and knocked out of the locker into dying state.
---
I was so friggin' pissed at that bullshit.
---
Other than that, you can hear him wind up for the pounce every time, so you know to not run in a straight line and to dart around a n obstacle to avoid it.
---
It's not much worse than a Billy with his chainsaw dash or Huntress with a hatchet.
---

---
They already did that to a degree.  They baked in his lowest version of Windstorm into his kit, and fully reworked his addons to have a fair amount of decent ones.
---
His stealth move speed is currently 135%, base movespeed is 115%.
---
With that, the stranger things dlc with influx of new noobs and the match making has been fucked for the last few months!
---
They might as well add in the space monkeys from COD black ops zombies and let them throw peanuts at us while on the hook and saying slurs!
---
This definitely wasn't crashing out of lobby. We had gotten past the lobby.
---
Yeah I believe that on PC it‚Äôs space bar for pallets and m1 for healing with self care. And yeah, I feel you.

Change the button then?
---
Yeah I came on reddit to see if other people were having this problem and glad I‚Äôm not alone but damn
---
Nice
---
So you haven't played in over a year and have the audacity to claim it's redundant because a friend said so? Baptiste and Brig are currently more meta as they break up bunker comp.
---
 Baptiste is good, and fun to play as. I'd recommend him. The newest tank Sigma has brought some wonderful new playstyles to the tank pool. Role Queue improved quickplay and competitive. Multiple heroes have been reworked. The workshop was released, the replay system, the endorsement system.
---
Overwatch has seen the *most* change in 2019.
---
Modify your buttons, put healing on Y or something (I have it on square on PS4).

just don't run self care 4Head

Camping isn't against the rules though, and in many situations it's a legit strategy.

I‚Äôve had a ton of people running Hex: Devour Soap for the past week on PS4 it‚Äôs been weird with how many are equipping it...
---
More killer mains complaining about a pro survivor map just like they always do 
---
Note this map is pretty good for stealth killers for example ghostface 
---
some maps are better for different killers just like big open maps are not as good for stealth killers
---
There just too scared to make really innovative perks when it comes to slowing the game. If one or two really good gen regression perks come out and make killers truly better then survivors for a period of time, what harm would that do?
---
My issue has been loading back into the lobby after a game
---
TAKE MY STRONG HAND!
---
They tweaked the demogorgon's power and add-ons. Or will in a hotfix with making his shred break pallets by default. It helps them work out any potential gamebreaking bugs that might exist in that build. Its hard to gauge balance on a build with worse matchmaking than the normal game.
---
most of the demogorgons I've played against just facecamped with shred ready
---
Spirit and Freddy are two of the better killers so they are good choices, personally I love ghost face and pig but they are not great, especially ghost face compared to Michael.
---
Sounds like I'll have to give it a shot then. Last piece of major news I had heard was that they nerfed brigette sine she was considered incredibly annoying to face
---
Same.
---
I had a spirit farm points with us the other day after 2 DC and she kept swinging on pallets and gens for us to do. Really a commanding HAH. Best coop farming killer noise imo. I was afraid to disobey
---
Gibbby!!!
---
Yeah bro
---
That really sucks man. I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen again
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know tbt. The only Demi *lovato* I went against didn‚Äôt do portals
---
hopefully they fix it soon
---
Yeah i was going to use it on Ghost face especially and jump scare as mutch as i can.
---
I agree to disagree. Most of the pallets are unsafe. You have to get the stun on almost all if you want any play out of them. 
---
That right there cuts out the best defense of survivor.  Some killers will still hurt on the map sure, but for the most part? It's pretty balanced in MOST killers favor against your typical survivors.
---
I wasn't aware that I could.
---
):
---
Don‚Äôt run self-care, it wastes time and slows the game down.
---
Don‚Äôt camp pallets it‚Äôs way to predictable now ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I am sure playing as killers will get better as you get better at navigating the map. I think that's the biggest problem right now. Not knowing where everything. 
---
But I do agree, some killers like Billy, Huntress and even Nurse will probably suffer because of how easy Survivors can go out of line of sight.
---
Sort by new and you'll see there are like 10 posts already about it.
---
Sweet
---
It‚Äôs because everyone and their mother is trying to play killer at the moment for obvious reasons, so cue times are longer.

No download required. Upon purchase it unlocks the DLC in game.

It lags pretty hard on my 1st gen. Xbox one :(

Plague is super strong against noobs lol.

server is down atm i believe same thing happening to me
---
As survivor I couldn't find any damn gens. All the hallways seem to loop around on themselves.
---
Oh so it's affecting everyone. I got stuck on "Checking Platform Services" and had to close Steam. Came here to see if anything's going wrong.

I finally got on and I just wanted to check out the new Stranger Things DLC!!

I have the same error.  üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Oh awesome, thanks for letting me know! I was starting to wonder.
---
Free week so probably new players using it more since it pops up often.
---
I‚Äôm getting the ‚Äúno network connection‚Äù bug. Anyone know how to fix it?
---
True.
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is about PS4 man, even on days like this. Any time I see a thread like this for PC or XBOX it‚Äôs always the reverse on PS4. Killer lobbies boot up so fast on PS4, but Survivors take ages.
---
Found it stressful as a new Demogorgon. Got completely turned around a bunch of times. Had a few times where I couldn‚Äôt find a hook upstairs so iron Grasp might be necessary. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a learning curve and we‚Äôll all have it memorized soon. Love the new scenery and atmosphere. Would have liked to take a minute just to look around but was too busy fumbling with his powers and tripping over my own flower petal head.
---
It‚Äôs new map,it‚Äôs indoors,has multiple floors. It‚Äôs a maze
---
yep! the new map and new killer are both very survivor-friendly and anti-killer. i read that most of the userbase is survivor, so that would explain why there were less complaints during the pbt. i'm a killer main so i was very frustrated today. BUT i got all of the trophies except for the hatch one that i'm still working on.
---
Got the same thing.
---
There is literally nothing good about a shift like that. I‚Äôd rather be forced up early in the morning and leave be 3-4 or have an evening/night shift but never in between.
---
Steam login is down ATM probably related to their new beta client they pushed out today, most games that require Steam login/authentication will not work atm.
---
Us survivor mains like to play the game and have a fun competition, instead we die when we go down once cause y‚Äôall pussy killers like to facecamp because that‚Äôs the only way y‚Äôall can get kills
---
Connect to the internet
---
It's saying same thing for me so I came to Reddit
---
I am connected to the internet. Thats the first thing I checked
---
So I just charge the dash attack and that works?
---
Awesome thanks for the information. Do we know how long this is estimated to last?
---
Why would Inner Strength be nerfed? Seems like an okay mid-tier perk, far from meta or even OP
---
Are you in another country? Because Im european, but in america rn, so I thought maybe thats the reason
---
Idk I don‚Äôt play pc and this has never happened to me
---
Having the same issue; I think they're doing some server work.
---
It's back it's back!
---
No idea but I do know it‚Äôs on steam‚Äôs end not DBD‚Äôs. I would check their twitter and see if there‚Äôs any update
---
Most games deal with this hwen they either launch for the first time or launch something big, and the servers melt as a million billion people log in. Sit down and listen to the tale of Error 37.
---
I kind of have to when my team refuses to heal and just stares at me.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty hardcore origin story.
---
How comea every time thereis a new update they fuck something up?
---
Why am i getting downvoted üò≠üò≠üòü
---
Check you key-bindings in settings. I should be the same button that the Hag uses to teleport.
---
The thing is, if the devs actually asked the veterans of this game (with more than 200 hours logged) what the biggest issued with the game is, they'd probably all agree that the gen speed is the main issue. Not so much that it needs to take longer to do, but there needs to be ways for Killers to impede it more effectively. When there's 4 solos, then the gens aren't *as bad*, but with 4 people who are communicating where the Killer is, who the Killer is, where gens and totems are, then that is where the issue with gens becomes apparent.
---
That's called game development.
---
Nah I made it all my self, but I can make you a format
---
What?
---
I guess we will get better when we figure out how to navigate the map better.
---
well, if I knew that, I'd probably be getting paid a lot more than I am now.
---
For awhile there, I had to verify my game files after EVERY UPDATE because EAC would say "Hey, you modified something, gotta kick you out".
---
Or you could just msg me the pics and I‚Äôll make it for u

Vigo a foot fetishist confirmed.

Srsly nicely done.
---
Definitely experience. Trapper main in red ranks weren't there day one. Learning survivor behavior, finding the best spots to place traps, studying the map layout (changes every time) and developing strategies to place the traps took time, trial and error, and painful 0k games to master.
---
He's bad and you wanna make him worse
---
I get that you got facecamped, but that's how he works
---
If you wanna complain about it that's cool, salt is literally oozing from this game and is expected tbh
---
But you can't make a bad killer worse without proposing a buff alongside it just because you had a bad time
---
Survivors escape every time with this one easy trick. Killers hate this strategy. It‚Äôs just that easy.

Oh, okay. How long might it take until I can play again? And why does it look like I can play as the killer though?(I didn‚Äôt go far enough to see if it actually worked)

Truth brother. Truth.
---
Eddie would have an endless amount of amazing cosmetics if he were in this game
---
I mean, it's 11pm. Can they sleep or what?
---
wait what's that from
---
The way it's always worked (can't say if it's still the same as the new patch may have changed things/messed things up) is that an offering will guarantee a map being played. If there's another offering, each map offering has an equal chance.
---
it‚Äôs almost 100%, extremely rare to not get the map.  It can happen but if you‚Äôre the only one bringing an offering you should be very surprised
---
Nah, it's just the cooldown that gets better. 40 seconds at Tier 3
---
Wait, this game is not supposed to be like this?
---
I really hope I can finally get my Myers achievement now.
---
ur so cute ily
---
Get Optimization PASS'd, kid.
---
I got 30 of them with Infantry belts.  You sure that they're rare? if they were rare I would get them ever 15 bloodwebs
---
Well, when you think that way... But if they don't wanna monitor if the game is at least playable 24/7, then don't try to make a huge community, it's not a ordinary bug, players literally can't launch the game, they should have a eye on at that (at least)
---
Most chapters have 1 killer 1 survivor. Ghostface and Ash are cheaper but sold alone. Makes sense this chapter is more expensive seeing as its 3 characters and 9 perks.
---
As a by the way: Licensed content does not necessarily need to be money-only content. BHVR could totally pay the license-holders from general profits, rather than on a share-of-sales basis. So don't just accept "licensed = money" as a law of how these contracts have to work, in reality it's more that BHVR likes money-only content, for obvious reasons.
---
I had no issues today
---
Do you recognize it lol?
---
Stock up and med kits mate.  Also learn when to heal and when to just do gens.  Promise you you‚Äôll rank up and will have less issues with ‚Äúrank 20‚Äù team mates.
---
Please tell me how everything about her isn‚Äôt a mind game.
---
Damn I closed the game to prepare something for dinner, when I came back I got the log-in issues, it was perfectly fine before.
---
No after every match it won't move evn tho it's says I've ranked up it resets again
---
No issues for me apart from when OP was in my game he disconnected on his end but just disappeared on mine and I got no quitter bonus or anything, it even said he was still alive on the final scores, see: [https://i.imgur.com/xC76Uwy.png](https://i.imgur.com/xC76Uwy.png)
---
You didn't answer my question. Does the exhausted status effect actually persist past going off the generator longer than 3 seconds? Because otherwise it's pretty fucking useless.
---
So it's utterly useless.
---
I‚Äôd like to play the game rn too but maybe play a different one for the day? Posting on Reddit won‚Äôt make them drop whatever they‚Äôre doing just to fix it asap, if anything they‚Äôll fix it tommorow
---
The time cost and scarcity of it is what balances it out. Like Diversion, it's very strong but has limited use. Maximum five times per game, but when you take into account hex perks taking up a totem that you may not get to, best you may get is 2 uses. Especially since it doesn't stack. And this problem is multiplied for each survivor. All in all it's a well balanced and strong perk, which survivors dont have enough of imo
---
I hope not. Though,
---
I'm skeptical about the crashing on hooks thing being a "bug". /s
---
Nerfed why?
---
They should have a night shift probably, right?
---
This is why I *want* to like Surge because it saves some time, but it's not just as good as it could be.
---
Chill man they‚Äôre probably new to the game and don‚Äôt know any better yet. Give it time and it‚Äôll die down.
---
That also assumes 1) no one else gets a totem (because I'm always cleansing them for free BP) and 2) you can FIND all of them (sometimes it ain't easy).
---
I'm on pc and the same thing is happening to me.
---
No, i'm in anger and I must rebel /s
---
Yeah, I just gave up, I was really excited to play against demo, whole day waiting to end my work to this, I just wanted to know if anyone knew any dev news
---
Same thing. Servers might be dead
---
Yes.
---
I haven't tried survivor yet, but i played a fewnrounds as the demogerkin earlier and my fps has tanked since the patch.
---
Hey I‚Äôll buy it
---
Also people not running it who just want the BP. Or if the killer has a hex, and they cleanse to destroy the hex.
---
Also sometimes finding totems is a pain.
---
No, it doesn't persist- meaning after 3 seconds has passed it goes away (at tier 3). 1/2/3 seconds respectively. It's not really that great a perk.
---
ye, had a Flashlight clicking mag trying to distract me while the others all ran around the hook, downed them all, got called a Camper, laughed and ate Lunch.
---
PvP Communities have the weirdest People
---
it always lasted 3 seconds after getting off the gen or 3 seconds after the gen get passed 50%
---
it do!
---
Nice. See you on the front page.
---
So does Feng.
---
Legion's add on makes sense given his power and how it works. Its a free pallet stun he vaults over with no stun. Its less downtime them Demi has when he shreds a pallet. Don't get me wrong Legion needs add on reworks but I think iridescent button is fine as is.
---
i like fire trucks and moster trucks
---
This story really interests you? It isn't even a good one. It is a paper thin narrative used to explain GAME MECHANICS.
---
I actively fool myself into forgetting it exists, because I find that it detracts from my gameplay experience. Just because it is so poorly written.
---
Not every game needs some story to explain it. Especially online multiplayer games.
---
Some people relieve stress and anger through trolling. It's very therapeutic
---
OoO is used to loop killers.  The aura revealing is actually a bonus if you‚Äôre good.  This perk is nowhere near as good as hex ruin, and you want a downside to it?  Low terror radius is counterable by 3rd personing around walls and audio.  That‚Äôs why scratched mirror is bad against good survivors.  It takes a long time to build stacks too.
---
Not at least until you get a hang of survivor it helps.
---
Your post seems innocent enough but the flair has me questioning your intention...
---
Maps are chosen completely at random (unless somebody brings a map offering), so yes any killer can be on any map. Welcome to the community :)
---
Any killer any map
---
Nothing is tied. Map is randomly chosen every match with the exception of offerings being burned (multiple offerings can conflict with each other) but other than that it's always going to be random.
---
Also good thing to note is you don't have to own map-specific DLC to play on DLC maps, they're open for all.
---
Oh boy
---
Yes! Any killer on any map!
---
It's not my huntress cosplay from last week but I do enjoy this person's
---
... Do you not know what words mean? If they got it's range back to what it was before but reduced it's actual effect by ONE THIRD then that's a gigantic, straight nerf.
---
People getting little success out of it doesn‚Äôt justify a perk slot when other perks give far better use.  It‚Äôs a cool idea if it actually gave you zero TR in chase
---
I would love a version of him in a hoodie
---
Doubt there will be enough players on switch for it to matter
---
I just realized that‚Äôs another survivor in the back holy shit I legit thought it was a ball
---
I only go for safe unhooks if I'm running BT. Otherwise, it's usually not worth it. You might as well just focus on gen rushing at that rate. (Then again, most randos you get will go straight for the unhook, and then sit there next to you and wait for you to die instead of realizing what's happening and doing the objective...)
---
Is it bad I‚Äôve seen what this is from before
---
I'm aware, but this is the first time the achievement description has reflected that.
---
The charge inconsistently counts as a hit. So alot of things that care about regular attacks dont interact with it like exposed

---
Thank you very much! :)
---
That's fair enough, as I said I put it out there on the chainsaw dance, but I'm honestly kind of trying to hear ideas on how to actually make this work.
---
So then, would you rather just remove the speed penalty for charging up his chainsaw? 'cause that could definitely help, though maybe you could give him a faster burst once he does finish revving?
---
What kind of reward or ability do we give him if we want him to have to leave the hook? I had toyed around with the idea of a 'station', briefly, that would be similar to the Plague, but I couldn't come up with anything at all that made any sense to me.
---
Tier 3 intensifies
---
Or its YOUR Killer weapon
---
think about it
---
All my friend and I wanted to do was play around on the new map in a private match. Out of 3 hours we got in 2 and a half games. PS4 also.
---
I don‚Äôt know why, but I always saw David throwing something out in a garbage bin.
---
Yeah I wouldn't mind them making survivor adepts more challenging. I got Steve and Nancy's within my first two hours of playing.
---
Thank you for the information! That‚Äôs awesome about DLC!
---
Hows jane down there...?
---
Oh r/dbdgonewild
---
For me personally I think playing a bit more ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù as killer when there are disconnects benefits everyone including yourself.
---
You don‚Äôt have to let them escape but letting them save one another from hooks, letting them do a couple gens then they don‚Äôt leave empty handed and hopefully safety pip. The more you chase and slash and kick gens the more points you get as well. 
---
They‚Äôre not expecting to survive so most will appreciate you backing off the accelerator a little.  IMHO
---
\&gt;no network connection
---
:(
---
It is down again as of 8:35pm. It was up for maybe 30-40 minutes.
---
Revolt against the modern world
---
You do realize that the actors already knew since bhvr have to ask for their looks right?
---
Didn‚Äôt realize rank 10‚Äôs were new
---
Unless the killer gets stunned by them or decides to break them they are often useless, especially on the new map which has almost no windows.   It‚Äôs really difficult to get away
---
yikes i can only imagine
---
It‚Äôs happened before. It‚Äôs been posted here (albeit it was a very long time ago) and I‚Äôve personally had it happen like two or three weeks ago. Friend but a Coldwind offering but we ended up on Autohaven
---
Ah I see I'm not alone in these desperate times.
---
Saw Hex: Leukemia once.
---
 No he is based ln the movie Toy Stories
---
Technically yes because if you buy it now, it can appear in survivor's next web after purchase. Especially with the updates. I think you get Iron will at 30, so that's 20 levels worth of BP. 
---
But it's still all RNG at the end of the day.
---
You didn‚Äôt state that they were rank 10‚Äôs did you? So there‚Äôs no need for the sarcasm, I was just giving input
---
It‚Äôs not a 100% guarantee to go to the map, mode like 99. 
---
You‚Äôve had it happen, and I‚Äôve seen it happen as well. It‚Äôs possible to burn the offering and not go to the map, but it‚Äôs extremely rare.
---
yeah i got screwed looking for hook up there aswell lol. After playing it a couple of times with the demogorgon i have started to learn how to put pressure with the teleports and the matches are much more positive now
---
Is it not suppose to work with his lunge specifically? Or is that how it is with every killers lunge?

I had no idea which flair to put haha. Any suggestions

I think a token system on an actual power wouldn't be very good, I get what you're saying and it makes sense and seems fair, just tokens on powers doesn't seem proper I guess? I have no basis as to why, bit I have a different proposal. 
---
I feel like his Sprint or "dance" shouldn't get one hit downs but is much faster than it currently is, and you can hit the survivor twice in a sprint, they'll have an invulnerability window, but no speed boost if hit with the chainsaw. It can still serve the purpose of downing multiple people but it's more useful in chase now too.

#SUMMON THE BLOODHUNT!
---
Trapper! Trapper! Over here!
---
They need to tweak hatch spawn criteria. Shit like this happens too much
---
Removing the penalty altogether would certainly help him but I think it would be too strong. I think maybe giving him a faster burst after the rev is definitely a great thing to test as that sounds solid but maybe not overbearing.
---
I think as long as Leather can down multiple people with his chainsaw people will camp with him, but I think removing that removes his defining feature. 
---
However, I think removing the ability to down multiple people with his chainsaw allows for easier balancing and would probably open up lots of new possibilities for him, so maybe that's the way to go!
---
did it work?
---
They made it so pigs ambush doesn‚Äôt work anymore.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not happening for me. It‚Äôs entirely possible that it‚Äôs not the demo lovato that‚Äôs the issue, it‚Äôs the pesky survivor internet

You have a point! I think discussion would work better though.

yep but that was back in december last year

Where did you get your suspenders

Oof. I see why you didn't try to Juke, weren't close enough to the edge of map. In memoriam of this ghostface I'm not giving hatch for the next week lol, he must've hated this game

I thought it was my internet which was always good. Not the game, tbh not suprised this happened with free week and new DLC

A true champ.

Why did it say ‚Äúentity displeased‚Äù

I'd recommend it
---
Yeah, been complaining about this for a little while now. Sitting at 42k shards just waiting for dlc to spend them on.
---
Seriously, some of the Adept Killer achievements are fucking horrid. They need to be changed asap. Getting a 4K as the killer is still the simplest fix.

Legion, Plague, Spirit, and Clown, 4/6 of the past killers have been original, and all of those were back to back, I‚Äôd like to see one more licensed killer tbh before they go back to making originals, as the ST chapter is absolutely awesome and ghostface is a pretty decent and fun killer as well
---
I'm getting the same thing is Australia right now so it looks like a server issue.
---
Oh thank god I'm not alone.  I can't get in right now at all and it fucking blows.  Before that I was "In" but couldn't connect to any game as the game would boot me to menu.  I thought I was getting dodged HARD but I guess not.
---
I literally just spent like $60 on all the DLC lmao, figured I might as well go all in since I spend so much time on this game

There's a different post from them about dedicated servers, I think Live testing is in October

I main Meyers with Monitor and Abuse(That sweeet 8m terror radius in T2); I live for the jumpscares.

Who hit you as a kid?
---
Meh?  This meme is like the 3rd one.  As has been stated before Self Care is basically made useless by a bunch of different perks and this is just another one that is better than 40 seconds of healing.
---
Of course I run Botany Knowledge, Pharmacy and Self Care for the very obvious absurdly low heal times on EVERYONE if I ever do run Self Care.
---
We are retro comic now
---
Imo running distortion kinda defeats the purpose of babysitter, which is making the killer target you so your teammate can escape. I would much rather run aftercare to see their aura after unhooking or the good ole dance with me/quick and quiet combo
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll help, but I validated my steam files, rebooted steam, and relaunched. Gave it 5 mins to load and got it working.
---
This complain is a little weird.
---
Year 2 we had 3 back to back licensed DLCs (Leatherface, Freddy and Pig). 
---
Year 3 we had 4 back to back original DLCs (Clown, Spirit, Legion and Plague) and one licensed (Ash).
---
Now we are on year 4 and after having 4 Original killers, we just got the 2nd licensed one.
---
Me not understand.
---
This patch? Because it was working yesterday.
---
Idk, i upgraded from 550W to 650W. But only because i'm going to upgrade my pc in the next months

Yeah but this is the second only one on rising.  Don't worry I checked!

I hate when people do that shit. Some dude disconnected while we were *in the middle* of the last tombstone animation for me to get Evil Incarnate and I didn't get it. Honestly, it pissed me off enough that I just gave myself that achievement with SAM.
---
Lol for a second i though this was an in-game image, good job
---
Throw in Poised or whatever the Jane perk is to leave no scratchmarks after gens are completed. Then maybe Quick and Quiet so you have a limited scratch theme build

That's unfortunate, Why would they nerf pig X_X
---
1. You can use it to help you loop Ghostface, sometimes Pig/Wraith. That's it.
---
2. No it isn't. Giving the killer information is strictly negative.
---
3. Just gonna breeze right past Hexes as an example of 
---
4.  Yes, it is. If this perk launched as described in the post, it would break the game. Before OP tacked on the "one at a time caveat", this would absolutely need to either be a hex or have a detrimental interaction with the obsessino.
---
5. No, it takes a long time to reach *max* stacks. You don't *need* max stacks. Even with just two hits on each survivor you've halved your terror radius.

Adrenaline removes the need to mend. Idk about other one.
---
Swiggity Swooty I'm coming for that scoops ahoy booty
---
Happens all the time just report and if enough people report the same person then behaviour will take action
---
Having this happen to me as survivor. Basically I am force kicked from the game and it acts as if the killer leaves. My buddy in the game tells me that my icon never changes ingame, but my character is nowhere to be seen and like this video, it ends properly since they aren't ingame. Very annoying.
---
Unbreakable works once. Nurse had each person down 20+ times. Please tell me again how unbreakable is the answer dad.
---
I almost prefer originals
---
I dunno, I didn‚Äôt really think about this on a technical level lol. I think I just keep thinking this game is going to become a mash of crossovers so to say? Reading your comment and some others do make sense to me, Im just seeing lots of posts excepting certain licensed characters to be in the game (most common is Pennywise) Guess I just like new original stuff rather than characters that already exist. (apologizes if this also makes no sense hah)
---
It really is. I‚Äôm hoping it gets better, but with my taste of the playerbase so far, I‚Äôm just going to immediately exit out of the post-lobby chat once matches end.
---
You sure know it, I am the Doug DimmaDemoGorgon owner of the Dimsdale Dinmademodome
---
You can 99% your recovery bar for an even better tap up by your teammates. Only use your "once per match" if it is your last resort.
---
Also, I didn't realize this immediately, but Legion having no terror radius is actually gamebreaking.
---
He's currently kept in check by "Deep Wounds does not progress in the killer's terror radius".
---
*Legion with this perk can moonwalk people again.*
---
Sounds more like you just spent a lot of time being downed. 
---
Learn to juke Nurse. Unless she's running "fuck you I get more blinks" then you can juke her. Learn how to, and you'll get better trust me. 
---
You'll never escape rank 13 if you can't figure out how to juke trashy rank 10 Nurses
---
Looks like theyre doin it
---
Still better than when the legion released
---
I guess I'll just enjoy the RoR2 update instead.
---
I just want more maps ... that would go along way in making the game feel fresh.
---
Thank you all for the advice, I reported it and they responded within 2 hours and thus gave me back all my bloodpoints. :)
---
Oh really? Gosh.. what a revelation /s
---
Killer camps? Stop trying to force an extremely difficult altruism play, and punish the killer by focusing on gens

Adrenaline states that it heals "one health state" which makes sense as to why adrenaline only removes the deep wound status affect, but second wind states "injured to healthy", which is why I wanted to know if it works differently

I mean, they are mind games. They dont require any skill and are a 50/50, but still mindgames

Oooo 2 licensed killer gap -.-

Yamcha and the weight of his sins.
---
I have to agree, I love Aftercare and I run it on every survivor (that I don‚Äôt have Bond on).
---
You could consider Lightweight, Iron Will, or the famous Dance With Me/QQ /Lithe combo for added getaways. Though not a getaway perk, We‚Äôll Make It could be a good addition if you are saving a lot. I‚Äôll even gladly take hits for fellow survivors when I know they‚Äôre running this. WMI users are rockstars in my book.
---
Oh. Then here lemme suggest a perk. 
---
It's called "Unbreakable"
---
Yeah, this is me also.  Guess I'll go play Risk of Rain 2 ;\_;
---
Why would it be useless?
---
OMG you're a whole new man!
---
Cause if you get moried that means you‚Äôve been on the hook before which means you can‚Äôt use deliverance
---
Thanks tips. Seeing as your flair is nurse I‚Äôm gonna make a bold assumption you‚Äôre justifying slugging for 30+ minutes because you do that sorta thing so you don‚Äôt get bullied. Gotcha.
---
Am I the only one who doesnt mind them?
---
No. They added the ability to retain parties and it‚Äôs not working.
---
Nope not that one. Its giving us connection errors when we try to invite each other into a lobby.
---
There is no bundle
---
Noed: Alright on my head out
---
It is a straight nerf honestly.  Reducing the chainsaw tantrum doesn't really have any real effect or benefit to his gameplay.  Good killers don't tantrum into walls and even if they do any amount of tantrum gives survivors free range to continue the loop safely anyways.  You start your post off stating how weak he is so I expected some quality life changes to improve his performance to be suggested but instead you took a 180 on your initial statement and turned this into a rework to nerf his ability to trashcamp survivors instead.  Just a little lost connecting the dots on where you start and where you end up here.
---
Probably an unintentional bug. They will probably patch that soonish
---
idk I love DBD but I just can't imagine playing a game on a 5 inch screen where 50% of the screen is covered by thumbs. Especially DBD.
---
That being said, I'll download it out of curiosity but there's no way in hell I'll be able to take it seriously.
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
not same
---
Um, no? Most times it‚Äôs actual toxic BM‚Äôing towards NEW players at rank 20 that haven‚Äôt a clue on what it takes to win at that stage. Or bm‚Äôing towards a killer simply hooking people or slamming the hatchet shut. I main a survivor, and may be new, but I will ALWAYS commend the killer even if they camp/tunnel me and I may die early on, and I hope to continue this going forward. No matter what ‚Äútoxic‚Äù things people may do in this game, it really doesn‚Äôt warrant the over-the-top shit-slinging once the match ends.
---
Well 99/100 twits i run in to are exactly as i described so agree to disagree i guess.
---
1. Slugging for 30 minutes is impossible. Even if you time out the bleedout so they're all separate it isn't possible to slug down a Survivior and let them bleed out for 30 minutes. They'll all bleed out before you get even close to that mark. 
---
2. Killers are allowed to execute whatever tactic they want so long as it isn't cheating. Chastise them for it as you want but in the end you were still a victim to them. And since it's Nurse, it's pretty clear that the Nurse outplayed you. 
---
3. Yes I main Nurse. I slug, when I'm avoiding perks like Decisive strike or when I'm trying to dodge pallet/flashlight saves.
---
 I don't need to slug so I don't get bullied bc usually if you manage to evade me long enough chances are when I find you, 2 out of 3 of ur friends are dead and that 3rd guy is one hit away from death hook and I want my 4th BBQ stack more than I want that kill. 
---
And even if I did, what of it? You have a way to counter slugging. It's called Unbreakable. Use it or stop complaining.
---
My friend has made a lag switch, literally just wires and a literal light switch, its basically bitches who are bad at the game who have to resort to cheating to get any sort of W
---
I made a good meme but I didn‚Äôt convey the caption well enough I don‚Äôt think; my friends are in green ranks and I‚Äôm a red rank survivor (at least I was til rank reset) and they always roast me when we get bodied by a red rank killer and I can‚Äôt carry them üò≠
---
Are you on console? Cause before bill came to console his perks were just normal perks that would show up for everyone.
---
Givin how fast gen speed already is, I would mori myself if I was playing wraith against a full team of iFocus
---
*I don‚Äôt know what this ‚ÄòYamcha‚Äô is, but it sounds like Radditz*
---
If you played and opened bloodwebs with characters before he came out on console, then you could‚Äôve gotten his perks before they were his.
---
Did you have a 4th perk?
---
Yeah I am. I wasnt aware of that.
---
You gotta SCREW THE COMPANY POLICY
---
I would love to have the "big one" from the first Jurassic park.think about it.the 1st Jurassic movie was very much a thriller and you could say it has some horror elements.like when the raptors are stalking the children on the kitchen? I don't think it's gonna happen but I would god damn love it if it happened.
---
I have only been playing for about a month. I'm not sure when he came out.
---
No. I only have her leveled to level 10. So only the three slots are unlocked. :(
---
Yep on Xbox as well, mainly the new map

Did I say they were on the ground for 30 minutes? Or did I say they were slugging for 30 minutes? Ya I got ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù all right. üôÑ

Really wasted opportunity to not have it last weekend- Friday The 13th AND a full moon.
---
Right, the multi-down is kind of his big 'feature' for his chainsaw, since Hillbilly is high mobility but only 1 down per saw attack, as it were.
---
Leatherface is in a really terrible spot, all told. He's in the bottom half of the tier list, and nobody seems to want him to be more like Hillbilly as that defeats the purpose of having different killers, but it's really tough to figure out how to get his chainsaw to work differently and still be satisfying to go against and play with as well.
---
At this point, I can't see how to make that work somehow, because it's clear that he's definitely not getting enough in return for losing his instant down power on multiples, and it doesn't seem to give him enough to warrant wandering around.
---
This is amazing!
---
Damn I was hoping that would work. Probably would be the best anti-tunneling perk in the game if it put you back to healthy state
---
I disagree with almost this entire chart.
---
Needs nerfing? Wraith, trapper, hag and leatherface? Killers you can basically loop for 5 gens?
---
"Balanced" - Nurse. Funny.

Then specify that in the original post holy fuck

If I do get a "GG" it's usually in a patronizing or condescending way from all of the SWF squad

Nerfing yes, too easy to camp with all of those. Balanced yes, because on PS4 it's literally the easiest, or the hardest killer lol.

It takes a few tries and the login is very slow but it‚Äôs working now.

There is a certain degree of skill though some loops require prediction some tiny mindgames confuse the oponents so i would say - skill is involved in confluence with experience.

Got a video that includes the scream?
---
Yes, I guess there is a learning curve. Near the end of the ptb test going against demo became a nightmare
---
One of my middle school teachers was named jason myers. Fuking friday the 13th lands on halloween
---
I‚Äôd say no - not all loops are safe. You can mind game them with your red stain to trick them into sliding over a pallet and use your speed while lunging to hit.
---
They said the live test would be in october after they fix the bugs concering interactions and projectile interaction.
---
Dear God, he's OP now... Demogorgon has a t-bag!
---
I would imagine a lot of it has to do with scoring events. He gets like 3 seperate scoring events for hitting someone with his lunge. It's sort of like with Hag where yoh just always max out Deviousness when you do well because of how often you get to use their powers.
---
Be like what? I teabaged once and the killer didn't even see, I didn't loop no Decisive Strike or Borrowed Time is it my fault the killers bad? If you watch the video he would've had me at the window but couldn't even manage that!
---
Care bear is the next killer confirmed
---
Cums
---
I've tested by switching between Ruin and Dying Light. Every Dying Light game has resulted in this as I hook a survivor. No errors when running Ruin.
---
UPDATE: started yo play a while ago and I'm having a really good time! Thanks to everyone!
---
I just realized that from reading the demo bio that he was probably One, the first of the test subjects like Eleven.
---
Did it work?
---
Me thinks i sees a yellow rank
---
It‚Äôs a fun 1v1 chase game with some cooperation tied in.. your not always depending on your team to carry the game for you and the feeling of actually understanding game mechanics/getting better is there. 
---
I‚Äôm just curious why you didn‚Äôt have the thought that all games are fun to people for vastly different reasons.
---
Absolutely not
---
Deadhard does not work once again
---
His charges shouldn't be stopped by an already pulled down plank though.
---
From what ive seen you can fix it by grabbing someone out of a locker. But good luck with that
---
I ran it with Small Game and found it very useful!
---
At least you are playing against Demo‚Äôs! I‚Äôve played 10 games today and not a single demo on PS4
---
Evolve
---
I just powered through it! Keep clicking my friends! Stay strong! I got in after about 15 tries!
---
You should mention, this is a PS4 tier chart. A lot are thinking it‚Äôs based on PC.
---
Are you playing on PS4 because I‚Äôve been going thru the same damn thing.
---
I think the only version available now is the deluxe edition but it gives you like 4 extra killers and survivors
---
That‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm looking forward to getting better with his teleports.
---
You gotta teach me I'm complete trash.
---
It's a shitpost that literally says who i enjoy playing against. Not a "which killer is good" serious discussion. üòÇ.
---
Thanks ! &lt;3
---
You‚Äôre a good man
---
No problem ! :D
---
Fall 2019
---
Red thanks. It's not a tier about who is easier than others, read the title little fella.
---
Er deres struggling with kyf. "Couldn't connect to host" or something like that. Idk why though. I haven't experienced being kicked from pubs, but i also Play om PC.
---
Damn, jus buy me a PS4 and I got you bro

Same here but on pc

For me, the MM has been fucked for awhile.  The past 2 weeks it's thrown me into games as if I'm GD Fungoose or something where my 26 hour rank 16 Killer (18 survivor) ass is placed into games with red/purple ranks and people with thousands of hours.  It's literally stopped being any fun on both sides.
---
There not common on ps4 thank god. I've had the rare one that just snipes the hell out of you no matter what you do haha
---
Amazing
---
Only if they follow it on Twitter
---
It's a glitch that's been around for a while that's just unlucky
---
I'm always impressed how quickly they forget their older killers.
---
Yeah, the map has nice long corridors and is basically a maze which makes demogorgon really strong on it. And then you get this map with Plague, Hillbilly or Trapper and are like "The fuck?".
---
You don't have an internet browser?
---
ughh. reminds me whey i have that crap disabled
---
That‚Äôs so weird I‚Äôve never had that happen before lol. Oh well
---
It‚Äôs too quick to activate to be able to destroy pallets by default and still be balanced, considering both Billy and LF have decent charge times for their powers to break pallets
---
How? Those people wouldn‚Äôt care about their reputation, they already get reported over and over. And at rank 20 it‚Äôs a huge issue, my girlfriend hasn‚Äôt been able to get a single killer game in the last month that didn‚Äôt have at least one player that was clearly too good for that rank playing like a douche. It makes her never want to play killer, it‚Äôs almost made her cry a few times. I‚Äôm sure that it does vary slightly from region to region but we‚Äôre in Canada, where people are typically polite so it seems to be shockingly prevalent.
---
And newbie hunters?
---
Take a look if some files are damaged
---
I was in a single game with 2 Nea characters and both of them were not able to escape. One escaped once the Pig picked them up and let them struggle out. The Pig downed the other one as well before the exit after they ran back in, but the killer just hooked them instead of letting them struggle out.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs all about perspective! Saw Nurse at top and knew this was a PS4 list. Doc is at bottom for frame rate drops?
---
The no fun infection got us on console too üò≠

I keep getting clowned on too, I‚Äôm getting so pissed off

Called it a night I keep getting looped on. 
---
 
---
Especially when a survivor goes into that corner so you can‚Äôt hit him. So annoying
---
idk what happened but a file literally cannot be "run on windows" or "has broken down" and i have to reinstall the game, but the twist is i already did it twice and nothing
---
I'm fully aware of this happening before, but I've never seen it so consistently with a single character model in such a short time period.

Heres my clip from today.
---
Well you look like a neon haired bitch that‚Äôs going to try to make me miserable. 9/10. Get a flashlight.
---
Haha, it‚Äôs a great map for her.
---
Is it for the whole duration of the game? I saw a fat glitch all night whenever the Demogorgon used his pounce power on PS4.
---
Play with your food
---
Same, but I don't complain, puking on people is fun.
---
Just me that liked this one? I hated the old version.
---
It's a bowl cut... it really doesn't suit him
---
Lol there is actually a demogorgon add on that lets shred break pulled down pallets. It's overpowered to say the least.
---
Shred is the main source of his power. It can end loops early and sometimes stop them from being started if they're in a bad spot. I'd work on mastering his Shred first and work on the portals when you've got a bit more experience with him. 
---
That's what I've been doing anyway. I managed to get the adept achievement within 3 games or so.
---
Yeah bad framerate + variable lunge range = *almost* unplayable on console. I need to keep using him but I'm probably just going back to Spirit/Nurse.
---
God I need to learn Billy :\
---
Spirit main BIG brain
---
I'll be right back.  Gonna make myself some popcorn to enjoy while I read peoples comments on your Quicksilver suggestion.
---
Jesus christ, I was joking, I have a broken-screened 2013 Dell laptop and I currently play on a PS4 0_o
---
New killer in new map is unplayable , high frame drops . And dont get mw started with the bugs on survivers side ... (Ps4 pro)
---
Ouch! The SWF I normally play in, most of them run Calm Spirit because they despise the Doctor and clown lol.
---
Equivalent of the adam head cosmetic making his hair slightly shorter ehhhhhh
---
I've had it happen in my games and both were with Kate.
---
Thank you! Hahaha
---
Sounds about right üòÇ
---
THE GAME LAGS SO FUCKIN MUCH TOO
---
I just feel awful being someone who‚Äôs been in purple ranks playing against a brand new playing giving them the under 8k killer smackdown. Like...ugh
---
Wow, this is amazing! I saw something like this the other day and I was hoping I could find it somewhere
---
Yeah like I'm trying to rank up and get better but when I'm the first one to die due to the killer just going for me first is annoying
---
Yes, this is the price
---
New killer leak
---
&gt; just hide on the maps sides or corners until the timer is done.
---
Uh, that's not a counter, that's part of the benefit of the perk. If you're hiding in the corner, you're not doing gens. You're gonna hide in a corner for a full minute? As a killer main, I'm gonna ask you to keep doing this.
---
What Did You Expect Seriously?
---
Yeah had a group for kill your friends and it kept kicking us all out.
---
A Rainbow
---
I'm giving the guy a compliment, not hitting on him.
---
actually, it's fairly easy to get used to the map. I've played a few games on it and already picked up a sense of how the pallets are laid out for this map. It seems like in each corner generator on the first floor, there's most likely going to be a pallet next to a generator and at least one pallet inside of the room next to it. If you are being chased, it is easy to go in the middle of the first floor where all of the windows are. These windows are crucial when looping especially if you have balanced landing. Another way to prolong the loop is if you go to the top floor, there will be windows again and a drop back to the first floor. With many corners of this map, it doubles the chances of you escaping.

Oh he's totally fun to play as haha... Just not against.

Just goes to show demogorgon is a trash tier killer
---
Yeah I need to get better at looping and memorizing pallet spawns
---
For Example: Spirit + Adam DLC Cost 7.99
---
The new map is horrible. A labyrinth with few safe pallets and dead zones. Trying to figure out where the portal zone is was an experience
---
So How Tf Did You Expect Its Gonna Be Lower Than A Normal DLC Price
---
one of the two also can help when ruin or huntress lullaby or whatever is in play. idk, i had fun with it :)
---
It is intended.
---
Why does Kate have a 5 o'clock shadow moustache?
---
I'm so sorry man. People on the game can be such jerks, and a lot of them seem to be particularly venomous to new players for God knows why.
---
Jake is actually the lead singer of The Counting Crows. FYI new lore update.
---
Hahaha right?
---
Bruh i could show you rn that the dlc does not in fact cost more than the game

I didn't even buy the hat. He looks so good like that

---
Every game I play as Killer at least one person has Borrowed Time, every game I play as Survivor nobody ever had it.
---
Meanwhile I have an unbreakable baby dweet, nobody ever expects it.
---
Nah this demo was just really bad lol. He might be new or something idk but he was swinging when he was nowhere near in lunge range, not using the full lunge range at times, standing under pallets etc.
---
I don't get it
---
Drake got balanced landing
---
I quite like Alert as it does give me a lot of info. As if the killer breaks a pallet or a gen then I'll know who they are and where they are, so I can then plan accordingly. If the killer goes one way, then I'll go the other.
---
I used to be bad at Plague and still have bad games, most recent one I had was a bad game. Spent a lot longer than I should have going after one survivor. But after reading up on Plague and watching plenty of videos, I've gotten better with her. I try and play in a way I punish survivors for not cleansing which seems to be the way to go
---
And my god its buggy as all fuck. I‚Äôm on xbox and was playing with a mate this morning. It kept doing this weird thing where we would be shown to be in a lobby together, we would both ready up and only one of us would go into a game lobby while the other was still searching. But it would show the person in their lobby still, but it says they‚Äôre in a match. We kept backing out and even restarting the game to fix it, first time restarting the game work but the next time it happened nothing worked until it just finally put up both into a match lobby.
---
I'ma just buy Steve and Nancy and save 5 bucks.
---
They are literally rank 14... Like what?
---
Can you actually set these as your icons? ü§§

---
I know this gets reposted all the time, but I always find it funny. The first two Scary Movie's are national treasures, and I love dead by daylight memes based on them.
---
&gt;Why does this game focus on leeching money off of people instead of being good and working? Stupid 12 dollar dlc for two barely different outfits and 10 dollars for cosmetics? This shit is insane, I'm surprised this isn't commonly known. BHVR needs to fix their game instead of making this feel like Fortnite.
---
Do kids even read the patch notes? The list of bug fixes with every patch is huge and yet people are always bitching about cosmetics and them "not fixing stuff". Just because they didn't fix a few specific bugs you were hoping for, doesn't mean they are sitting on their hands. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/87825/patch-notes-3-2-0-stranger-things-chapter#latest
---
As a Spirit main, I agree she doesnt really takes skill to play. You need to have experience to mindgame properly hovever (and ofc headphones)
---
Nancy main
---
Yeah Bill was never on console til recently. His perks were just basic perks in the game that everyone could get.
---
It‚Äôs $9 more
---
You can't change what I've been seeing for 10 months dude, they are sitting there thinking about how to get more money in their pockets than actually making their game good. They try to trick you into thinking they care so much by fixing bugs and stuff but really what they do isn't big and they don't focus on it more than making cosmetics.
---
Turn up your settings m8...
---
Fuck yeah, Infectious Fright. Finally, I think I‚Äôve collected the Infinity Gauntlet of must-have perks for Myers.
---
Damn just looked him up, he seems to be a great match with Leslie.
---
&gt; Stupid 12 dollar dlc for two barely different outfits and 10 dollars for cosmetics? This shit is insane
---
You don't have to buy it to play the game
---
&gt; I'm surprised this isn't commonly known

??? Everyone who plays DbD knows it. What "common knowledge" are you talking about? You mean, DbD is more predatory than EA and/or Take Two?
---
Not to mention that map
---
Both. Both us gd
---
Just shut the fuck up. Just shut up. Your not even thinking about what I'm saying.
---
&gt; Do kids even read the patch notes?
---
Why? It's a lot of work. It's better to swarm forums with "where are dedicated servers" days after official announcement of delay.
---
I really got down voted for liking someone's content? That actually kinda disappoints me. Genuinely kind upset ig.
---
&gt;Is the Bernie any different?
---
it, instead, opposes the working class
---
Steve is Myers confirmed
---
STBFL does not work with Shred, same way it doesn't work with Huntress' hatchets.
---
You spelt mobile wrong
---
Just take away all of the survivors perks while they‚Äôre at it, they get nerfed every fucking patch
---
Yeah but you're missing the part where I said 'killers or a survivor leaving right at the beginning of the game' because I didn't know which one as it was as soon as we loaded in so obviously it was at the start. I didn't leave I play SWF and they lost theirs too and we play survivors. Like wtf is wrong with you desperately looking for an argument out of thin air no one attacked you..
---
Can confirm on PS4. Though, I've only played Demo since the update but I can't seem to get many hits with Shred because of how easy it is to dodge. The frame issue has been noted by numerous people as well. BHVR needs a post-update optimization patch. It's Curtain Call all over again.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
The killer must have left at the beginning then because we all lost everything.
---
The Myers I drew looks extremely depressed
---
Bugged by Daylight, amirite?
---
My friends and I SWFd most of the day and encountered nearly all of these issues. The most common for me were the random DCs from lobbies and in-game, and getting stuck at loading screens. It would just turn black and I'd have to leave the lobby to get out.
---
He's a whole new man
---
* Common media repost (e.g. Sharp Hand Joe, kid dancing in front of a Myers mannequin, "Die, Bitch" scene from Scary Movie 2, the "Your eyes on drugs" meme featuring The Doctor, ...).
---
&gt;Queue times are even longer
---
&gt;When you do get a game (finally) it's horribly unbalanced due to the piss poor matchmaking
---
wat
---
how can you complain about queue times and then matchmaking in the next line
---
pick one
---
Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, bro, you're actually gonna get banned...

Not got letting Nancy's live, but for actually killing survivors. Stupid, noob, baby killer &gt;:(

Thank you, i didnt have blood warden so i will put . furtive chase on and rememver me is a nice choise
---
That's nuts. I wouldn't be surprised if it's true. I rely on BT all the time with campers and tunnelers. :/
---
I wasn't aware that it doesn't work with hatchets. I don't play Huntress.
---
I mean i want that clown ass so i get it to.
---
I think how we've seen him be used by people isn't how he needs to be used. Though Shred has only one real usage, the portals require some tactics. Putting them near certain places, but not *on* those places seems to work. The stealth out of teleport helps get to the target faster before they react. Of course, not all maps can hide portals that well. There have been some games where the Survivors chose to not seal my portals and I kept teleporting to where they were.
---
But yeah, he's a mix of Freddy, Huntress, and Bubba. Portals allow teleportation and minor detection, and Shred is a charged range attack that has less range and slightly less cooldown on collision. Which means he's overall not viable past rank 10, and against 4-man teams on coms.
---
Nope, hillbilly is hotter than bubba.
---
It could work but only if both survivor and killer are in VR so it's not unfair on the killer with the survivors being able to 360 or easily flashlight blind them.
---
map offering is free, just keep updating your bloodwebs.
---
Yeah, can guarantee you if they released DDS with the one hit down huntress bug they would still bitch.
---
Isn't pebble master a monto build?
---
I don‚Äôt care how rare it is. Ever giving the survivors a guaranteed win is absolutely ridiculous
---
It‚Äôs my pleasure :D
---
You have a point good sir
---
Nope.
---
sarcasm?
---
This and the one he wears when he goes into the Tunnels!
---
I do prefer just the base outfit but with the scoops t-shirt , looks great that way
---
Hope you're a survivor main because Hawkins is easily the worst map for killers so far. Except for maybe spooky myers.
---
Insta heals, whatever, but giving the survivors a way to just win, whenever they want, is atrocious
---
u could get it for like 5eur on cdkeys.com
---
It's not whenever they want. In order to leave through the hatch with a key, there has to be a certain amount of gens done depending how many survivors there are. it's not a free win.
---
I understand that's how matchmaking works but your reply suggested you didn't understand how he could complain about queues when they were getting games.
---
Personally yeah I'd rather wait for better matchmaking if it's going to be terrible. There's nothing worse than being rank 7 and trying to get back to red ranks only to go against a rank 3 killer and your teammates are yellow ranks and are all urban evasioning around the map to save sprint burst and self caring in corners rather than getting shit done. 
---
Same goes for killer, I'm currently rank 9 and it's frustrating to go against red rank survivors. Makes the experience not fun and it's the main reason I mainly play swf these days and even then quite often our swf which is purple and reds with end up against rank 15 killers and it's a bit of a shame for them.
---
It's only guaranteed for the survivors who know about it because it only stays open for 30 seconds. Think of it as the equivalent to a killer's Ebony Mori.
---
They were like that for me before the update
---
We can do gens after that minute, if no one gets downed, you just wasted a perk slot. It's simple
---
Yep, the new system is kinda wonky at the moment. They'll probably fix it soon.
---
&gt; Personally yeah I'd rather wait for better matchmaking if it's going to be terrible
---
This is you. 9 out of 10 players (specially streamers) would rather just play the game.
---
I never teabag unless i need heals from a fellow survivor, if i see that the killer is being bullied and we are winning at the end i just let him kill me because he deserves it after enduring these toxic players, i wish survivors woulent be so toxic im a surv main myself rank 3 atm but i really dont care if i get sacrificed or not, id rather have fun i hope toxicity will die in this gsme cause its a lovely game, just try to ignore them is all i can say no matter how furious you get, just go in reddit and let em finish the game or somethinf, or get noed and fake afk and get em back hehe, gl mate
---
Man, I have the opposite luck most of the time. Two or even all three of the other survivors, slowly crouch walking their way to me.  Despite the killer or their terror radius being present, they all act immersed af.
---
Then, they unhook me just after I reach phase two, or are a few feet short of me when I die.  If they do reach me in time, it's after alerting the killer, in which case they unhook me right in front of them.
---
I really gotta crawl outta these green ranks.
---
That's why I said personally and I get that, I stream the game from time to time myself. We can dream tho...
---
Yes, and they should have given up a black eye and a busted nose for his bloody head as it‚Äôs a reoccurring thing in the show where he gets his ass kicked

This is so fucking awesome. I love it. The perks and especially the story. If only BHVR had a suggestion box. Only problem is BHVR might see this as too political.

Yea, it‚Äôs very risky going political, especially in video games nowadays. I‚Äôm just glad someone liked the concept lmao

Also it‚Äôs a perfect excuse for him to have the hate, even if it‚Äôs in a backpack :P

They have to have done a certain amount of gens defendant on the number of remaining survivors.  But keys are still dumb regardless.
---
Hi, just hopping in to write that correct spelling of meme is "ight imma head out", for future cases.
---
Steve screams like a bitch
---
^no
---
this bug is really annoying. they fixed it for a while but its came back.
---
I mean I'll do this if you farmed me. Like no you screwed me so I'm taking you with me. I've actually had a few killers give me the hatch if they got the other survivor since I prevented them from escaping. That's rare though
---
You‚Äôll change your mind about keys once you see some good killer addons in action
---
i play ghostface so i down them and start t-bagging back
---
oof
---
No, that's Yanma
---
Like an ebony mori? Lol
---
Only the last one looks good
---
I never considered bearded Chris Evans before and now I can‚Äôt unsee the similarities. This has made my day XD
---
Just don;t get downed DOLT!
---
So that's how it must really look to play the Demogorgon.
---
Even as a shitpost, I‚Äôm horrified about the idea of an LF nerf. Like what could they possibly do to make him worse, aside from like, making his chainsaw heal survivors and disabling his M1
---
Yeah i hate it aswell, i also only played on low but just because i like it that way. Playing on ultra is like not having your glasses on its just all washed out and not really sharp. Now i have to play on Medium or the hair looks like shit and the offerings also look washed out as hell
---
Whose that bottom right? üòç
---
/rant
---
I hate indoors maps, they're just so oppressive to both killers and survivors, hear an aura? 
---
\- Outdoors map: ok killer must be close
---
\- Indoors map: ok killer is either in a room that doesn't connect to me, killer is close, or in some cases killer is above me.
---
Nice.
---
On the subject of traps... What would allow a survivor to run over a trap without setting it off? 
---
I put a trap directly in the middle of a pallet (fairly certain no way to avoid it, unless you were being really careful and even then it looked like it would be tough. Ming looped me through it once, I ended up having to take a really weird route to avoid it, but luckily she ran back through it and got caught. I was about to start recording in case something was funky, because it was so weird to see her miss it.
---
we loopin
---
Yes, those HEX: '*funny name/joke/whatever*' I see every third game are so original.
---
like they said its a separate trophy list. instead of it being with all the others (Dead By Daylight 1/2) it'll be in a section labeled Dead By Daylight 2/2
---
It probably just means that it doesnt leave any flesh for literal scavengers (rats, condors, or w/e).
---
sorry i need to prestige Demogorgon fast and ive been spamming legion for points :/
---
I had a game where I literally DIED after using and insta-heal but i kept the medkit and only lost the addon.
---
Or nobody memes where nobody isnt appropriate is unique and funny
---
I'll have a look later tonight. Thanks guys. Out of curiosity are there any difficult ones like the bill ones? Do the last gen as the last survivor and open the door and escape aha!

I like the concept, I want more killers like Legion customization wise. I do also respect how you see how going political is risky. If they were to add this I could see people from both ends of the spectrum complaining. People who don‚Äôt want games to add any form of politics would complain that adding LGBTQ Characters is political. And I‚Äôm sure some of the LGBTQ community may complain that adding LGBTQ Characters only to find out the characters are cold-blooded killers is distasteful. Personally I love this idea, only things I would not want to see in DBD are characters that are obviously only there to make a political statement and killers based off of real life killers. Other than that, New content is new content!!
---
That‚Äôs one way to look at it.
---
My original intention was to create a killer that forces survives to play defensively rather than uber aggressive like a lot of them do nowadays (myself included). That‚Äôs why I specifically made him a counter to altruism and healing; it makes survivors play much more stealthy and tries to punish them for trying to grab the killers attention in an attempt to keep him/her distracted. It punishes group healing (which can be viewed as a survivor buff if you really think about it, less people healing in a group == more gens being worked on) and also in a way forces people to just push through gens since healing is much riskier.
---
Anyway, I could always make it so that downed survivors don‚Äôt gain bloodclots and just lose them instead. That way, the others gaining bloodclots from healing will be much lower if they wait for a few seconds so the person can regress out of a stage.
---
I will never understand people who don't just level up the free default characters perks and get their teachables for blood points instead of being mad they spent shards for them.
---
Dude lookin like Undertaker
---
I was playing with dude like that. What's wrong with u ppl
---
Ugh happened to me, we got destroyed and had no chance of unhooking him and winning as we still had 4 gens to go, round hatch and they wouldn‚Äôt just die killer looked for hatch found me and we all died
---
At least it activates for you, mine doesn't seem to ever light up no matter how many people i heal.

Second Wind is so good, I dont understand the hype of the locker heal. Inner Strength is over all more time consuming than just self caring or using a medkit...
---
r/gayporn
---
At the very least I wish they'd fix matchmaking then. I'm a mediocre killer. Gens should be getting done at a moderate pace at my rank but there's always a red rank or two mixed in.
---
What would actually help is adding a secondary objective that's actually impactful on the game. Tons of ideas have been thrown around, but so far BHVR has shown no signs they intend to add any.

So did you guys swap nudes?

i am constantly getting attacked in twitch streams because i say old freddy was better. i dont understand this "bottom tier/worst killer in game" mentality. he was fucking fantastic and i too mained him. almost never went without a 4k with him and made it to rank 5 (the highest rank i hit with killer) with him solely. ive tried, and will continue to try, playing new freddy but honestly i dread it and second guess myself each time i start a match with him. it almost hits me with some feels "man i dont know if i should play him this match im probably going to depip" etc. etc. its nice to see more and more people coming out of the closet, as it were, as old freddy lovers. honestly, and i hope they are paying attention, i think BHVR needs to allow us to CHOOSE when they rework a killer... be able to choose between old and new. so those of us that still want to play old freddy can and all the others that want new freddy can as well. same goes for any other killer with a rework. it would add some fun to the game not knowing which is which "oh its freddy but is it dream pallet freddy or pull you into sleep and can see your aura while you're in dream state freddy?"
---
you're welcome
---
Oh man, that's so much needed, because I want to try so many different combinations and I just dont have most of the ones I want, I tried using different survivors, but then I have to spend bloodpoints on each one...
---
So there's a risk of running full build of second chances. Neat.
---
It was an honour doing this with you.
---
/s?
---
Its all fun and games until you face off a terror radius doctor with ruin in the new map

---
Second Wind is incredible. I made a very rudimentary build using his 3 perks and Empathy, I‚Äôd always go try to heal the injured and when I finally got hooked and unhooked, I was able to just get right on a generator and save a bunch of time. I think once I get it all wprked out, I‚Äôll be using Second Wind, Babysitter, Empathy, and Botany Knowledge. At least until the new players figure out what they‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt need me to protect them anymore.
---
For one, Xbox doesn't have a ptb. And two, I get perfectly fine frames as demo. The only time I ever get 10-15 frames is when I'm playing as any killer on Ormond. Otherwise I get pretty decent frames.
---
I've given hatches to new players numerous times tonight. Every time I've had to drop them and shake my head to teach them to stop struggling.
---
I had to leave the country for a month the day it dropped.... so I get to watch everyone else play and miss the blood hunt. Yaaaaayyy.
---
"Dark Sense: Now triggers from any generator completion instead of only generators completed by the perk owner."
---
Going to try it out now, yes, might be really good for your standard gen rusher.
---
I liked Old Freddy too (I used to main Doc and Freddy just felt like a sneakier Doctor. Good stall, good tracking, constant target switching, and you want a small TR on him compared to Doctor typically using an obnoxiously large TR. Zapping at pallets was replaced with mindgames or using his tiny TR with Monitor And Abuse to disengage and reengage from an unexpected angle) but he was unhealthy for the game.
---
Survivors had issues with the fact he had nearly perfect tracking on you at all times. A Freddy refusing to disengage and tunneling one person could quite literally chase you forever. 
---
I miss Old Freddy but when it came down to it, my main strategy with him was to waste everybody's time via juggle-sleeping everyone and getting 50 concussions from pallets on my head and survivors were fucked when pallets ran out. 
---
I do miss having somewhat flexible builds because Freddy had great built in tracking and stall. Red Paint Brush + M&amp;A was hilarious on Lerys.  
---
New Freddy lost his tracking and stall but at least he's very good in chases now which was where Old Freddy faltered. There were plenty of times with Old Freddy where I gave up and just flung myself at survivors eating pallets until they ran out. 
---
I want a killer like Old Freddy with the same hit and run playstyle but less irritating for both killer and survivor.
---
Spirit! She‚Äôs very strong once you learn her. Plus her perks are not bad. Spirit fury can be combined with enduring for M1 killers.
---
I wish they were actual 3D models, not just flat png files
---
What a pay 2 win game pay 2 earn op perks
---
I really hope so I'm loving the chapter though
---
It's the best survivor perk of the Chapter precisely because it helps you if you're being tunnelled. You just have to survive 30 seconds in the chase after being unhooked, which is totally possible for a good survivor. Then you get an on-the-run insta-heal. It's great.
---
And with the outfit if you use decisive you pull out your bat and clobber em
---
Why is it a major irritation to you?
---
I thought we would get the Scoops Ahoy when getting the DLC.. Turns out it's a separate purchase for 10 bucks. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
Plunders instinct, ace in the hole, pharmacy and borrowed time
---
Ability: has blendette sneakiness.
---
Mori: absorbs you into themselves and forcing you to join their legion.
---
Perk 1
---
Dark rising: when a generator is completed, a random generator that has at least 75/50/25 percent finished regresses by 10/15/20.
---
Perk 2
---
From within: you become obsessed with one survivor. Upon hitting your obsession they gain a 5/6/7 meter AoE that slows healing, generator repairs, and sabotaging by 15/20/25 percent. This debuff is permanent and stacks.
---
Perk 3 
---
No way out: after successfully killing a survivor during the collapse, the entity becomes enraged.  The collapse is sped up by 20/20/25 percent and survivors still in the trial cannot hear the killers terror radius.
---
How so?
---
Just getting the characters doesn't automatically shove them on bloodweb
---
You can use shards in shrine as well
---
Sorry game devs would like to be paid for work they do?
---
Sorry BHVR needs to make money when they pay to liscence content?
---
Like it's 3 characters all with unique perks
---
Like your argument would have ground if legion counted as 4 seperate characters and they charged for that.
---
But like it's $12
---
4$/ character that's consistant more or less with everything else
---
Wait a minute..? WHERES THE RUM HAM! RUM HAM!? NOOOO RUM HAAAMMMM!!!

---
The old pulling survivors into dream world was very cool! All this fake pallet / dream snare stuff sucks. Always just going into the dream world for no reason sucks. Rework could have gone way better.

It's a bug

the same thing happened to me too :D
---
context: I went back to unhook him at the end of the game when we had the escape open and he was hooked all the way in the basement (which was legit like halfway across the map). The killer was camping everyone the entire match, but we both managed to escape.
---
Just made me really happy.

(also; used the wrong flair at first because galaxy brain 4 am me is dumb and misclicked. F.)

Thank fuck it's not just me. Performance has been dogshit since this update.
---
They reached the limit for trophies in a single list and had to start a new one. Kinda lame but hey
---
In order to beat tunnellers, my tactic was take a hit, and unhook in the blade wipe animation. Yeah you get hooked, but the faster that cancer achievement is done, the better.

Second Wind just doesn't feel worth it. Need more playtime with it, but it feels weak. Might as well just bring a medkit for most situations.
---
And to add to his tip, whenever you are roaming the map occasionally channel the Abyss to see if someone is on a portal. Best way to keep good map pressure.
---
I dont have the perks yet but would they work fine with head on, and quick and quiet?

I don't want spirit reworked and I'm a survivor main. The only bullshit things are prayer beads and collision while she's in her ability. The fact that she has no animation for vaults is kinda bullshit too. It's just so unnecesary.
---
would probably be more helpful to see the questions being replied too as well...
---
I can still 4k with my P3 leatherface at high ranks. Having an insta down is what saves him. Playing as demo is so frustrating. I'm not sure what they can do to fix him tbh. Maybe remove the ability to clear traps? either that or make the speed a lot faster.
---
Meg's default braids have really cool physics now.
---
I stalk, they tbag, im lvl3, they run, I one tap, they disconnect... the daily routine :D
---
I totally agree with you. Old Freddy felt like an entirely different playstyle than everyone else, sort of like Hag - not committing to chases but juggling, disrupting everyone, disappearing and popping up when they didn‚Äôt expect you. 
---
I tried to like new Freddy but he feels bland to me now. Chase, hit, chase, hit, hook, chase, hit, rinse and repeat. The match feels the same whether I‚Äôm playing him, Clown, Doctor, etc. except he‚Äôs stronger than them I guess. 
---
RIP old Freddy.
---
Valid question, but I have to admit I fucking lost it at the "demoGORDON". I just imagined some demogorgon chasing survivors who are running away screaming "Ahhh, a monster!" and it just stops in its tracks and in the most generic male voice you can think of, says "Well actually, my name is Gordon..."
---
Why???

Thank you.

You see your Scratch Marks exactly how the Killer sees them, so they change with Legions FF, Spirits add-on, Dance With Me, Predator, etc.
---
The but doesn't affect anything if you're still more likely to get the bad spots

That poor Nancy. And she was the hooked one too...
---
Yes, new meta inner strength, head on, Q&amp;Q, DS. Maybe not new meta but deffo viable.
---
if I could love react on this
---
Hatch is there as a means to help better players escape potato ranks. There are some teams that can‚Äôt be carried no matter how good you are. When all 3 of someone‚Äôs teammates go down after 5 seconds of chase, the only reason a player (who‚Äôs half good) would stay is bc there‚Äôs a chance they could get hatch. 
---
I‚Äôm not gonna say it‚Äôs not annoying as killer, but it‚Äôs an incentive for survivors to not give up 
---
(Which also fits the lore of the entity as a sliver of hope, but DbD lore is all over the place so it doesn‚Äôt really matter)

That'll be $19.99 plus tip :)

have posted this on r/LeaksByDaylight ?
---
Didn't watch Demon slayer, I play on watching it though
---
It's not just a free win they have to have done a certain amount if generators for the hatch to spawn.
---
Yeah, they are usually pretty boring. The best one that I've seen was *Hex: Gon' Give It To Ya.*
---
It sounds like Steve's hooked cries and moans are coming from everywhere around the hook and not from Steve himself. It's very weird.
---
You're not going "out the hatch"
---
Gosh, I thought I was the only one going crazy with swf connection issues. I haven't had any problem ever playing with my NAT type until this patch came out. Playing with more than 2 people in a party is virtually impossible on Xbox.
---
"Just do bones"
---
... oh wait, that's a solid advice
---
It's a bug a friend of mine experienced earlier today and I've seen on the BHVR forums. Hopefully it gets fixed soon along with all the other things they broke in the update.
---
Had a very new player do this was playing survivor and got matched up with a plague and the killer obviously just started playing as she was constantly missing her hits got lead into being looped in a circle for nearly the entire game and didn't even try and use her vomit attack and didn't even know how to hit generators after they hooked someone for the first time they just stayed there watching them and eventually I managed to get them off the hook and the killer ended up gett a 0/4 anyway
---
I'm actually hoping the next killer is pennywise I'd be super hyped of it was
---
Yeah Plague specifically is disgusting with CP+IF.
---
Who needs friends anyway
---
I like the trilogy of Laurie's.
---
As an ace who plays with AITH and Plunderer's this is definitely relatable
---
Some killers think any body blocking is toxic and just don't want to engage with the survivor at all so perhaps it was also that
---
You leaving the map tho there for going out the match  your not gunna say I‚Äôm going in the match to leave are u big man
---
Actually since WGLF doesn't come with Aura I'd be ok with taking away the aura from BBQ and making it strictly BP related and then making the aura default for all killers IF you'll accept Kindred for all players :P  
---
Double up on the not-camping feature.
---
Tell that to Kyle Gallner.
---
Having the button to insta-switch instead of having to go back to main menu is a convenience thing if you swap frequently. Not the biggest deal, but it's more annoying now because the option used to be there, especially if you play the game solo.
---
dont want to get political or some gay shit like that in a gaming sub but
---
women are indeed female and men are indeed male
---
I bought the full chapter then realised i didnt get the nancy cosmetics then realised that i would mainly only ever use Nancy so i refunded then go just her and her part of her cosmetics for the same price as full chapter :D
---
No
---
No problem man. Good luck out there.
---
Lol all this time I thought these second skins are just a full package you get from buying a character (I always bought full chapters). If those are meant to be something exclusive, they are extremely lame
---
mostly fine, tho breaking pallets with his Addon feels weaker than Brutal Strength and its weird that you cant place any Portals once you reaches your Limit
---
This would be a great addon tbh
---
I had fun on legion when I started playing again but now that I‚Äôve been back awhile gosh I cannot play a game of him without switching to another killer
---
You can edit your game files to lower a few more settings. Look up a YouTube tutorial on how to play on 144 FPS and it will get you to the screen you want.
---
Yeah when he got released on the ptb i first thought breaking pallets with his shred was in his kit, but you do get stunned for quiet some time
---
That aint hair un my book
---
Yea body blocking is definitely toxic. I mean you dont see survivors in movies body blocking powerful killers. In dbd that's definitely bullying I think. But also it's a free hit whereas the person being chased is at full health. And hooking a body blocker is satisfying lol
---
Nice to see Steve getting some revenge for Jonathan. Nancy deserved it.
---
why would you use that even as a common rarity...
---
You rule | You suck
---
 ________|____ *////* /
---
Too early to tell for me. Only played against one and they tried using shred to cut off pallet loops on the new map. I‚Äôll reserve judgement until I face a few more and the killer mains get a better handle on him.
---
This post was made meaning that Dedicated Servers is going to be possibly even worse than this, hitbox wise anyway.
---
Did *your* dumbass not read that this is an original game so original characters should outnumber crossover characters?????
---
You know this argument wouldn‚Äôt be so heated if you hadn‚Äôt been a dick in your first comment
---
I still like it but it does feel a little not worth it, especially since it does not work with delivrance
---
It's a fun show! I do recommend it.
---
Patience...they'll come maybe before the end of the year
---
I had this happen yesterday, I got off a gen as a skill check popped up and it popped the gen while I was running from it, would have recorded it but
---
Wraith on autohaven is good for survivor tho. You always have a pallet or a jungle gym near gens.
---
Shining justice
---
I cant wait üò¢ its really hurt
---
I don't think body blocking as a tactic to save team mates who are getting chased or about to get hooked is toxic, but I've definitely had players seek me out randomly just to body block, and that behavior is definitely toxic and obnoxious. But I'm not gonna turn down the free hit
---
Me as a survivour since st comes out
---
how would it stack? they would occur on two different occasions wouldnt they?
---
Yes I can go 12 will my fucking Legion and it doesnt pop up... I'm calling some BULLSHIT

I‚Äôve moved to a different country and cant play until christmas when im back :‚Äô((

IMPORTANT: 
---
Patrolling a hook to make sure they aren‚Äôt unhooking isn‚Äôt camping. 
---
Camping is when you just sit by the hook and wait for another survivor to attempt a rescue.
---
The liscensed killers yes since they already have "themes", but oc characters no. They could easily make one for the pig, freddy, leatherface, and ghostface but I feel like it would be a lot of money to implement it
---
He does
---
Well i dont habe that Problem in Konsole
---
Angry people shrine
---
Do you respect pallets or not? That is your answer
---
More new killer advice: Remember it's a 1v4. Your time is more valuable than an individual survivor's. So if you're spending a long time on one survivor, whether chasing, searching for them, or camping, the other 3 survivors are doing gens ensuring your loss. That's why hooks/downs are good - it forces 1-3 survivors to stop doing gens and save/heal, usually while you can have already found and be chasing someone else during that time. That's how you build momentum, ending up with more downs/hooks, more injured survivors for shorter chases, and eventually dead survivors. Camping might get you a kill, but you'll still lose the game overall.
---
Related tips: If you realize one survivor is really good at loops? Stop chasing them and find the others, because they're probably weak links. Does it seem like a survivor wants you to chase them? Don't do what they want, cause oftentimes they know they have an advantage. Been chasing a survivor in a big circle, oftentimes around/in a large building with multiple windows? Stop chasing them, the loop they're in is a (near) infinite, meaning they can loop you there for a *long* time. You'll quickly start to recognize these really strong loops and just stop chasing survivors that run to them, and instead go looking for a better targets further away.
---
Final tip: You have a lot of control over which generators survivors will do simply by being nearby, because survivors tend to want to do gens away from where you are. Survivors can 3-gen themselves by accident, which means they did all the generators except the last 3 (which they need to finish 1 of) all near each other, creating a very small patrol loop for the killer. In addition, pallets are not infinite, so patrol unfinished generators that are grouped up and with no pallets nearby more frequently than that one generator across the map from the others with a strong building loop nearby. You won't always manage to control it perfectly, but you can definitely slant it in your favor.
---
If you sensitivity is not at absolute max for killer and survivor in console then it is too low.
---
Hell max is still too low but we make do lol
---
even without Spirit Fury, Enduring is the better choice. there are simply pallets you DON'T want to break as they're incredibly unsafe if played correctly and they become basically free hits with Enduring.
---
Someone who is experience in DBD would not respect pallets. So Enduring?
---
Really? Maybe that makes sense since the game has really aggressive aim assist for hits. I'll try it out.
---
It's an acronym, but you wouldn't know that, you seem really angry man, take a breath
---
Nice vid
---
Shouldnt it be the other way around? You know because usually the console community is always has been bigger than the pc community

---
You make a fair point, but if you don't have BBQ, there is something in the map which tells you where to go: auras of unrepaired generators. Just go patrol them, if you find someone, chase. If you don't, go back to the hook when you get notified of the unhook.
---
I understand new killers get anxious, but not having BBQ is not an excuse.
---
Steve is just looking for B E A N S
---
Will definitely watch it!(heard good things) atm though, I'm watching black clover
---
Nancy's Jacket s1 and Steve's Tunnel Outfit s2 are the highest cosmetics on my list. I would pay top dollar if I can get dressed up in tunnel gear and a scoops Ahoy hat
---
Not very cash money of you tho is it
---
I feel you. I made a post about Nea's hair and I can't play her atm because it physically pains me to look at her.
---
Enduring will probably help in more situations than brutal, so Enduring should be your pick
---
The Demogorgon is probably my number one least enjoyable killer to play against. With his ability and only 1 gen left to go.. without a full team it's practically impossible it feels.
---
Yeah, some unsafe pallets you don't want to break as they can be free hits if you're fairly patient. I will take your opinion into consideration! Thanks!
---
personally he is meh for me interesting to play at best but nothing good
---
Bubba reminds me of Spinner Dunn from Death to Smoochy.

Brutal strength should be a free unteachable perk.

Get enduring because there's a lot of pallets you get smacked by and you can run around and be right on their ass

BOY did they shit the bed on matchmaking on this one. Terrible, terrible, terrible.
---
Sucking all of the fun out of the game and a brilliant introduction for the new players the DLC brought in.
---
Good job, guys, brilliant as always.
---
I was referencing hot fuzz haha
---
Pretty mediocre to be fair, not saying he's not fun but damn some games against good survivors that already know how to play against him are complete pain in the ass and frustrating.
---
Kinda expected him to be stronger, not saying Spirit or Nurse level of strong but just a little bit more.
---
I like this idea. The only thing:Perks do not effect a killers ability, so you would have to change that.
---
Damn Hawkins scientists, theyre onto us
---
I'm wrong about who I like to play against? Ok master.
---
Perks have to work for all killers. Just something to consider
---
Here we go. Another killer wanting the game mechanics changed because they didn‚Äôt get 4K. Nobody owes you a sweep. Killer mains stay fuming, calling the police to report a hate crime, writing their congressman, and creating petitions any time they don‚Äôt get 4K.
---
About the nerf. The rest, you do you. But they dont need nerf

When ever someone says I tunnel them I tell them ‚Äújust don‚Äôt die‚Äù

dont press on the item that is up on the offering part but press it in your inventory, it will remove it from there. had the same problem for ages

Maybe nerf was the wrong word to use... Rework is probably a better way to put it. I find they're just the exact same damn game every single time lol. It's just not fun at all anymore with them. Literally roll my eyes as soon as I see one of them. Haha.
---
Dwight‚Äôs changes were a subtle but much-desired improvement. Can‚Äôt put my finger on it exactly but it seems like they updated everyone‚Äôs older hair models to have more texture with some kind of fade effect when you rotate angles. Overall I think the thicker textured design looks better across the board but I can see how some characters might need some tweaks still. 
---
Also I might be tripping but did they add a subtle change to the characters‚Äô base skin too? They look less derpy imo (especially Quentin).
---
Yes but like, god damn, these are bugs that, as you said, were found little 12 hours in. Honestly, do you think that proves they actually test their content?
---
we got outplayed
---
It‚Äôs 2019 and big game enterprises still don‚Äôt expect the big influx of players oof
---
I like having keys because hatch usually spawns by the killer instead of me ;-;
---
Alright Dwight.
---
It happened to me too months ago and I restarted the game and it was back
---
*cries in nurse main*
---
I swear I got more non-Demogorgon killers last night than actual Demogorgons.
---
I would be as well, but we already have a clown character. I wouldn‚Äôt mind Annie with a really cool obsession perk. Or, whomever is the new antagonist in his new book. ‚ÄúInstitute‚Äù, which I still need to pick up. Maybe even ‚ÄúThe Shinning‚Äù would be cool. Either way I‚Äôd excited to see a Stephen King inspired chapter being released.
---
or you could spend those 16 seconds on gens instead

If we're going with something from The Evil Within, let it be The Keeper.

‚ÄúOh. Keep running!‚Äù
---
"Could have left me on the ground to have another chance"
---
Guys this isn't some PC Viva Pinata game. You aint entitled to shit. Killer will kill and survivor will run and piss off the killer. 
---
Saying that it is always nice to see random acts of kindness and wholesome chat after a game. 
---
Also tunnelling is only a thing once you give it a word. There are deliberate tunnels but - that is a legit strategy (just not a very good one at the expense of one survivor). People really shouldn't get so upset about things that are possible in the game - otherwise take it up with the devs.
---
Happened to my friend
---
If there‚Äôs scratch marks and people say it‚Äôs camping though they become a laughing stock.
---
The best feeling is when a group is super altruistic and they count camping as not falling for all of them trying to bait while another saves. Like if you‚Äôre all not doing generators why should I stop defending? I‚Äôll bait just like they do until they mess up.
---
I liked Hex: Devour Hope
---
Thanks!  I'll try it out next time.
---
I feel you are pain
---
Removed we ask for you to take part of this sub before posting your YouTube thank you
---
I mean just because we have a clown killer already doesn't mean we can't get pennywise like we already had Billy a chainsaw killer but we got leatherface anyway
---
IM NOT THE ONLY ONE!
---
I'd prefer their abilities buffed. Like trapper could colour the traps with paint to make them less visible (colour of the floor of course). Make its challenging for survivors and gives him more usage.
---
Lmao this exact thing happened to me except blendette somehow found her way into stranger things
---
I don't know why the community is being such a dick to this guy. You are literally talking about hardware and graphical performance - which is the only difference between the versions of consoles - so yes it is likely to make more of a difference between using Xbox one and Xbox 1 X - more so than between PS4 and Xbox 1.
---
He said it in a pedantic way. But he is right.
---
True, but a chapter usually contains a killer and a survivor. We could use the MC as the survivor, but he's pretty generic tbh (excluding his backstory). Leslie could have potential to change things a bit since he's very different from other characters (and an inpatient in the hospital, which hasn't been done yet).
---
Nancy cause it looks like a pewdiepie outfit lmao
---
Sorry guys i meant this as a suggestion not a question
---
It doesn‚Äôt even activate of someone even helps you heal for a second. It‚Äôs really underwhelming and is useless in most situations
---
Lmao I love reddit
---
No I actually haven‚Äôt played in 4 days and I was watching YouTube. It‚Äôs just people get 4K‚Äôs robbed from them just because of the hatch. It just annoying that‚Äôs all the stops you from pipping sometimes and it just is annoying for people like me trying to get to red ranks for the first time. That‚Äôs all.
---
Mookle is done with your shit
---
Just lost my wig playing as Nancy too D:
---
OI, JOSUKE! I WAS MASTURBATING BUT I ACCIDENTALLY USED ZA HANDO AND MY DICK IS GONE; OI JOSUKE, CAN YOU FIX THIS?!
---
Point proven. I was going to use the argument, that Leatherface is a staple within the horror genre. Can‚Äôt do that since IT is as well, SO I‚Äôll retract my original statement and just hope it‚Äôs IT lol
---
Enduring, not only does it give the chance to leave pallets down, it counters head on and ds a lil
---
So camping isn‚Äôt camping if there are scratch marks or you know a survivor is nearby? Oh ok. So when survivors are repairing generators‚Äîlike they‚Äôre supposed to‚Äî it‚Äôs gen rushing and when they‚Äôre trying to save someone on the hook‚Äîlike they‚Äôre supposed to‚Äî then it‚Äôs baiting and being super altruistic. Oh ok.
---
I know, just stating it doesn't suit him
---
cute onion is cute
---
Laughs in console
---
O N I O N I S B A E
---
He used it correctly, bud. You‚Äôre the wrong one here.
---
they removed Enduring's ability to reduce stun time from everything but pallets, just fyi. it only affects pallet stuns now.
---
That was nice writing tbh
---
Time to watch some stuff
---
He has layers just like a certain ogre. This is a hint that the new chapter will be with a VERY hot killer and a swamp.
---
Yos
---
‚ÄúWhat are you doing in my swamp‚Äù ‚Äú I just wanted that fat green dick‚Äù
---
Tbh going out the hatch makes no sense unless you are exiting the hatch, not entering it. In this case, the player is entering the hatch, so it is indeed ‚Äúin‚Äù.
---
YO I literally told my mate that we need this today!. PLEASE BHVR get this outfit please!
---
XD
---
Anyone else have super fast waiting speeds for lobbies? I used to have to wait 3-5 minutes as killer, but now I find a lobby after 3-5 *seconds*.
---
You're good, I was just confused
---
Okay then cunt
---
Oh. When was this changed? I haven't played killer since forever sorry.
---
*THE HAIR CANNOT BE CONTAINED* 
---
**THE HAIR CANNOT BE CONTAINED**
---
That..might've been me. I played Ghost Face like twenty times.
---
Thanks, I got lucky that they 3 genned themselves so surge really shone. Sorry to hear that mate, hopefully you've had better luck since or will do soon.
---
‚Äúrobbed‚Äù
---
The only robbing that can occur is when precious killers throw tantrums and DC because they were outwitted by better players and cost the entire lobby bp. ‚ÄúHello.... officer. Yes, I‚Äôd like to report a hate crime. I was maliciously bullied in an online game and literally robbed, literally.‚Äù I can see the Change.org petition and tumblr posts now. ‚ÄúStory time: I was mugged and beaten by a group of men. This perpetuates rape culture and violence against killer mains. When killers are trying to kill you, listen. It‚Äôs time we have a conversation about the systemic oppression killer mains face.‚Äù
---
when are they going to ?
---
I play pc but I agree, the matchmaking is a joke. I was in a lobby yesterday with ranks 12‚Äôs and 14‚Äôs and a baby Dwight rank 20 joined. And the killer is was a rank 12. He got destroyed 3 minutes into the game
---
Thanks, congrats to you too. How'd your game go? I got really lucky that they accidentally 3 genned themselves
---
This does not apply if all survivors are hiding nearby waiting for you to leave the hooked victim, because they aren‚Äôt doing generators, so why should you leave the hook to stop other survivors if they aren‚Äôt doing anything you can stop?
---
TL:DR
---
Don‚Äôt camp if survivors aren‚Äôt nearby waiting for you to leave. Do camp if survivors are nearby waiting for you to leave.
---
While we‚Äôre on the same note, survivors be nice to the new killers and those who are trying to learn him. It doesn‚Äôt make you good to call people trash who have .2 hours on a killer.
---
Based off the Amazon description; ¬†"(base game) - shattered bloodline (chapter) - curtain Call (chapter) - spark of madness (chapter) - of flesh and mud (chapter) - the 80S suitcase (cosmetics) - the Bloodstained sack (cosmetics) - headcase (cosmetics)"
---
He‚Äôs actually pretty powerful and I guess being a hardcore killer main that kinda helps but with map knowledge and an overall sense of how to shred around loops he can dominate but if people try to play him like hag constantly teleporting then they‚Äôre probably gonna get fucked
---
Brutal is a better SF except one slot.
---
I straight up cannot play survivor on it I always die like instantly
---
patch 3.0.0. I think? the release of Ghost Face.
---
When they're ready.
---
I still wish I could get a perfect beard like that
---
\*gasp\* he witnessed the community of the gods...
---
WE ACCEPT HER WE ACCEPT HER GOOBLE GOBBLE GOOBLE GOBBLE ONE OF US ONE OF US

Or two people keep healing one side never letting you do the full meter.
---
Bill and his smoker's cough would like a word.
---
The hell are you goin on about, mate?
---
He's just such a likable guy.
---
... kick them?
---
Because they probably didn't compare it to breaking a pallet normally for some reason. Imagine if Bubba and Billy needed an ultra rare ro break pallets with their chainsaws. Guess the devs figured a massive monster shouldn't need an add on to so massive monster shit.
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Agreed, it‚Äôs too much criteria for just getting healed.
---
It‚Äôs like jumping through hoops for a extremely situational thing.
---
I only do it if I‚Äôm swf cause we decide who gets it. If I‚Äôm not playing swf I‚Äôll just let someone else get it.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5wuir/is_this_a_known_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
It‚Äôs ‚Äúdon‚Äôt‚Äù not ‚Äúdo not‚Äù shithead
---
Last night, just before the game fully shit the bed, I started in a match where one person played a Gallows and another played a bloody streamer. 
---
Then the game was stuck on the loading screen. 
---
I was mad as a Billy on Lery‚Äôs.
---
I don't. It saves you a few seconds at most unless your computer is a calculator. I'd rather them remove it than leave it in and break the game.
---
Yeah, well I'm always of the mindset of gens before heals, even before this perk, especially against sloppy butcher and whatnot. So it can definitely be useful in those situations, but is it really worth taking a perk to save 10 seconds gen progress? Might as well just take a gen perk like leader or prove thyself. 
---
Just feels like it could be better, especially considering how good Inner Strength is.
---
PepeLaugh üëâ KEKW
---
I mean, I started with Feng Min and had put enough BP into her by the time I found out about some of the better teachable perks, so I've been focusing the hell out of generators and just trying to stay out the of killers sight because I'm terrible at routing. That doesn't stop older players from flaming me every second game (some even multiple per game). 
---
So far I'm pretty bummed out about how toxic players seem to be. At first it seemed a pretty chill, albeit strange community, what with killers dropping you in hatches sometimes and the like, but the more I play (and rank up) the more shitty people seem to be.
---
If going back to the main menu in a video game is such a "major irritation" to you, I'd hate to see how you handle actual problems.
---
I was in the same exact boat. I got it from the shrine and it ended up on the first Nancy web. My thought was that would be too many bloodpoints on a survivor (Jake) I wouldn‚Äôt use as much. If I only want one or maybe two of the teachables I will try to shrine them but for the few survivors where I want all 3 I level them. Most of my leveling is done to killers since they all have different powers. Survivors are just cosmetic once the teachable is unlocked.
---
It might be just me but it feels like softballing new survivor makes them more privileged and toxic and other survivors in general.
---
5000 ping is just playing nurse as a survivor
---
swf is survivors with friends?
---
Then don't play if this bunches your panties so much. It's hardly a large amount of time, and you're going to be sitting in queue for a few minutes anyways. Some of you people are the biggest crybabies I've ever seen in my life.
---
I didn‚Äôt log on because I don‚Äôt want to get bullied by deranking killers or deranked survivors
---
Unrelenting only works with basic attacks. As for Enduring working with his pallet breaking add on I‚Äôm not sure.
---
My thoughts exactly haha. I don‚Äôt play enough to level a lot of survivors. I level killers and shrine survivors. Well, try to.
---
Yeah, i had to live with low fps on console before the patch dropped but now the constant freezing combined with even lower fps is killing my enjoyment in this game
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
Amazon would be great
---
It's a nerf. If your obsession dies, all effects stop. Dying Light is even worse now, and to top it off your obsession is buffed with no danger to them since you have to hook everyone except for them. Lame perk. Nobody is going to use it.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it shouldn‚Äôt happen, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not fun for the survivor getting tunneld, and he wasn‚Äôt actually trying to tunnel. I see were your coming from, but this happend literally in the first three minutes of the game
---
I‚Äôve got to edit it a bit tonight I recorded 3 matches
---
Jesus Christ sorry buddy I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with you but when I‚Äôm watching twitch and I see a legion with no perks or add ons get a 3k with 4 generators left yes I call that being robbed of the 4K.
---
Thank you. People here don't understand why "win more" perks and abilities are trash.
---
Thanks ^_^
---
Oh fuck me I'm so sick of it. I've never been more tempted to block communication in general man.
---
Did you lack of oxygen at birth or are you trolling ?
---
I made this with snapchat please dont judge
---
I really want to get Jeff I really like his perk distortion also because I don't play many male survivors tbh
---
I play killer but only at night since killer queue are so long in the afternoon for some reason. I only play Wraith,hag and plague when I have a daily. I mostly play Michael and Ghostface and Spirit.
---
just as helpful as the loading screen tips at least.
---
lolwut
---
You do realize that in exchange for losing this button we got never having to leave lobby with SWF, a friendlist, and even the ability to go to the shop in lobby now, right?
---
man people just love to complain about minor crap
---
I like it :D
---
It's the locked characters.
---
Like a record, baby.
---
Yuck
---
If you don‚Äôt get hooked you don‚Äôt die, 4head
---
i like how i said overcharge is useless against a competent survivor but when you say it nobody downvotes, sad times
---
Thank you very much for the write up. Is there any site that I can use to check out perk rankings for the current build of the game?
---
I hope the community meme headcanon becomes demo acting like a dog.
---
I can agree that every killer needs experience, but high-tier killers like Nurse or Spirit require things like muscle memory and at least a rudimentary understanding of how to read survivors.
---
My first match with a Demogorgan, he was AFK the entire time. Only once we had both exit gates open did he come back, and obviously by then it was too late.
---
Remember also not to bully the new killers
---
Moris are also bullshit to play against.
---
Though that wasn‚Äôt me it made me feel good about my last game I was sad about giving up adept but you just made my day
---
You're either trolling or you had a lack of oxygen at birth
---
I only bought the Demogorgon. I honestly have no interest in Steve or Nancy.
---
Walter
---
Now this is a good shitpost.
---
I don't have Legion but I really like Discordance I have put off on buying them since I'm not sure I would enjoy playing them or not. But I really like Joey's cosmetics and I feel somewhat alright if I'm killed by Joey but if I get killed by Frank got mad lol.
---
I haven't leveled up Nea yet so I don't have balanced landing but I have urban evasion helped me juke some Spirits
---
It's a knowingly sarcastic response when people complain about how killers play when they're on the hook or just got unhooked.
---
That's the second time I see this meme. Nancy's actress was still just as non-expressive.
---
Do you want to play some swf?
---
 Its gotten so terrible lately.
---
This is a really good point and I‚Äôm glad you mentioned it. I wasn‚Äôt gonna get any of the perks at all but now I might get rancor
---
200 IQ meme
---
No I‚Äôd say the demogorgon is angry beastly screeches
---
Banger tune though
---
You wanna break that one down for me? Just got into DBD, so I‚Äôm massively under leveled compared to most other players lol
---
Same I really like to use Head On paired with quick and quiet but I rarely get to use it on some killers.
---
Yeah I main Ghostface I like using devour hope on him so I don't have to spend time stalking a survivor. I only get gen grabs with scratched mirror Myers sadly.
---
Big brain time.
---
For now, I think most people are still figuring out how to play Demo
---
cool steve is best steve
---
Seems like a fact from the actual show
---
I'd rather spend my BP getting items and offerings on the killers I actually play
---
Remember Me, Rancor, Blood Warden, No Way Out
---
If u check out my Twitter u‚Äòll see - I have a flashlight, don‚Äòt worry! ;P
---
Of course, I understand. And it is frustrating when the killer doesn't have that common decency.
---
That is what makes killer toxcitiy worse than survivor "toxicity". People complain about teabagging and flashlights. If they are complaining about it, then it is working. But killer toxicity is more about camping and tunnelling, - which I think are completely legit. But it is just sour grapes, because you are sabotaging your own game to get petty with 1 survivor. - That is the true defintiion of being toxic in my opinion.
---
But saying that - I just try and enjoy the game - and never get too upset about anything. I joined a random kid last night and was explaining to him that just because we got moried by the demogorgon, doesn't make the killer a bad person. Quite a funny conversation actually.
---
Me: "Let them get it out of their systems, its the new DLC, they'll want to see the animations"
---
Raging kid: "THEY CAN WATCH IT ON YOUTUBE FFS".
---
I‚Äôve been enjoying it, I feel like you just had some bad experiences. Once you get the general layout figured out, it‚Äôs pretty easy to loop killers and keep them in prolonged chases.
---
I think my main problem is looping so I gotta grind for enduring and brutal strength, and hope bamboozle comes out soon
---
I only got the Demogorgon because I hadn‚Äôt played as it in the PTB (I wanted to wait until it was released). Last time I played as a trap-based killer was a month and a half ago, and even then I sucked at it. Not to mention that every time I played as it I would be matched up with SWFs of 2 or 3 each round and would be genrushed before I got a single sacrifice. The ironic part is that I got the Plague before getting Demo, and I would only be matched up with baby survivors as her. So you can imagine what I think about the Demogorgon...
---
Now do baby meg pleease
---
Damn bro, that's a extremely rare bloodweb
---
You getting good frames doesn‚Äôt denounce other people getting terrible frames.
---
https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/killer/ &amp; https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/
---
Perks are rated by the community.
---
Hardy Fix I take just makes the killer hit it a second time before it starts regressing? They don't damage it outright. If it's like 5hat, it's not that useful.
---
Quicksilver is ridiculously overpowered
---
Engineer doesn't seem bad but the gens get done way too quickly already. It'd force every killer to run Ruin (even moreso) and every survivor would run this.
---
Unruly is pretty much the same as Boil Over.
---
Back Breaker seems pretty weak when compared with Pop Goes the Weasel, but more regression speed wouldn't be bad IMO.
---
Grim Determination would be way too overpowered. I love it in concept but 100% is way way more than what you are picturing.
---
Awww.  He's adorable!
---
I don't play clown but his perks are great. Bamboozle Myers is op sorry.
---
It's just the mend, no heal.
---
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs a game, and sure, your playing to have fun, but it‚Äôs not right when your having fun by ruining someone else‚Äôs fun. Also, you basically just said lagswitching is ok because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the way they want to play‚Äù
---
Yay new flairs now I can show that I'm a demogorgon main
---
So you are a killer and you notice that the survivors are going for the save, do you really just ignore it? That's a pretty shit tactic, if they are stupid enough to try to unhook inmeadiately when the killer is nearby, then they deserve to get punished for doing so.
---
Good survivors will keep doing gens to force the killer to leave the hooked survivor, and then when the area is clear they go for the save. If the killer doesn't move, he gets punished by only getting 1 kill and throwing the match.
---
Bad survivors will go to the hook and attempt to "bait" the killer by running around the hook while the other survivor tries to go for the hook. That usually ends in a 4k and a team of salty survivors in post-chat lmao.
---
Damn didnt know that
---
I've noticed a weird killer bug where the obsession doesn't have to escape in order for the game to end. I've had two different games end with someone getting hatch and the scoreboard shows the obsession didn't escape. I'm not sure if that's a bug with the icon or the gameplay but either way it pisses me off
---
Half the time it's easier playing against swf, they go for the absolute bonkers saves that are never going to work.
---
I don't get what they're trying to achieve out of this. It's not like the game is running better because of these changes. They're just upsetting the fans who have stuck by them for a long time.  :(
---
He‚Äôs not bad, I overestimated his lunge so he‚Äôs rather easy to loop; the amount of time you get to react on his portal is generous as well. I died to him yesterday purely due to bm and some bad positioning due to lack of knowledge of the new map. All in all it‚Äôs the individual and their experience/perks that will make the biggest difference.
---
Surge and the gen blocking upon knockdown (ghostface?) perk work incredibly well together though so the theory crafting for builds has already been well underway. 
---
Ruin and Noed are of course staples so gen rushing is of the upmost priority with how much of the map he can keep consistent pressure on and the addition of the new status effects his portals are pretty safe with the amount of time they take an individual to destroy
---
I can totally understand his reasoning. You play to have fun, not to get tilted.
---
I like using Botany Knowledge so I can heal faster without relying on medkits
---
Nice I love dedication to your main I need to level up other survivors to get those perks unlocked on Jane.
---
Nice I dont play Freddy nor Amanda but I really like their powers and such and surveillance is really good helped me when a group of survivors three gened themselves.
---
‚ÄúWhat if I can‚Äôt do the gens bro‚Äù
---
So plague like??
---
Randoms don't do the objective, nothing will get done ever.
---
You get a lot of BP using legion as well üëåüèºüí™üèº
---
Yeah i assumed ruin was a must but damn if all the gen block perks are locked behind killers i dont have that just fuckin sucks. Guess i‚Äôll have to get lucky from shrine
---
Hes fun, but he takes a lot of practice.
---
He has a lot of map presence. I managed to 3 gen across the map.
---
It's free to play for a week now, give it a 2nd shot and see for yourself, I personally like how the game feels like a game of tag but you could be different so I can't say if it's worth buying for you or not
---
Do people really need a 6 second boot-time on their PC or SSDs that instantly access files rather than taking a second like older hard drives or zero load screens in games. Nope. Do people like having those things? Clearly, yes.
---
I also don't know how you reached the conclusion that the only result of BHVR leaving the feature in the game is to break the game. As opposed to, say, fixing the new lobby system to also work with the swap feature, which they will undoubtedly do...eventually.
---
I like the way the killer is LF all should I said T H I C C boi  ;-)
---
Yah it‚Äôs gotten to that point with me as well and when ghost face came out I almost uninstalled the game. I‚Äôve talked to the few who would talk, after a face camping Match and they aren‚Äôt doing it for points and don‚Äôt care about pips or ranking, they are simply just camping people because they know it will ruin that survivors fun along with the game for everyone else and they get a kick out of it! 
---
So at that point that falls under griefing and that‚Äôs a bannable offense per BhVR.
---
Lol you must didn‚Äôt get hugged a lot as a child, also you ain‚Äôt shit, you built like shit, smell like shit, you will never amount to shit, you just called yourself a background nigga which means you just watch from the crowd you useless sewer rat. Also look at your down votes
---
Trying to win &amp; get a 4k is how I have fun &amp; if a survivor gets tunneled, to damn bad im here to win &amp; sacrifice them. And saying that I approve lagswitching is a ridiculous assumption, thats not a playstyle thats actual cheating. Not the same
---
Yeah he can pretty much 3 gen no matter what which is always good
---
That's a good idea.But I think mindbreaker needs to do something more than just counter sprint burst to be a more used perk.Still making it useful in generators almost done is a great,and balanced, buff.
---
just dodge and try again, survivors lobbies are quick
---
isn't this against rule 8? then again 90% of this subreddit is spongebob memes and this stupid meme
---
Whats wrong with a flashlight?
---
Sounds op to me
---
You have to constantly make sure more than one portal is up though in each area which is annoying.
---
I like this
---
Lol it does and thanks for watching and also thanks for making sense
---
https://youtu.be/WYEd4dOK8is It's uppppppppp
---
Yeah considering how fast they can close those portals is ridiculous
---
Well you do have to take a short or long rest between uses. If you take a long rest you typically automatically mend depending on DM; it's when you take a short rest that this question is important. You can spend any number of your hit dice at a short rest to mend up, but I don't think it's necessary to regain Second Wind. But what if you go into a short rest already at full health? You still get Second Wind back!
---
Yeah I don't have stranger things dlc yet but I'll get it soon though. But I went against one demogorgan yesterday and got slugged to death when there were two of us left really sucks but yeah all these new survivor that came for Stranger things are really salty like they called me trash because they died and that I suck for a rank 10 says the rank 16 who started playing a few days ago.
---
We got discordance a few weeks ago
---
Rawr
---
Well keep in mind, if they are injured and it‚Äôs 97% and your right next to them they can‚Äôt use dead hard to bait a host to finish it, but yeah, maybe 10/20/30 seconds
---
Isn't it great when the Devs of a game truly listen to their fans? I love BHVR my guy so much

It takes 1-4 minutes to find a lobby as a killer here on my Xbox.

Anime profile Nea OMEGALUL
---
Missed opportunity to add the 3 dashes
---
The first day when I was survivor, I played with the same Blendette and a Nea who new what she was doing, and faced 50% baby Demos and 50% Leatherface. When I played as the Demo, I faced really great survivors who completely destroyed me in game.
---
Managed to escape on my first Steve game fot the adept, I didn't have Scoops Ahoy though :(
---
nothing, the remaining survivors still have to their quart. If anything, with the improved genspeed even with two survivors if they play smart or stealth they could beat the killer.
---
Rank 15 is the lowest you can de-pip to, but you can go even lower on rank reset.
---
Best selling doesn't mean most active
---
You do realize that not everyone farmed up 1 million bp ahead of time to level the new characters, and not everyone bought the DLC, right? Can't get down on people for that.
---
And we still don't have dedicated servers, so your shit internet will also disappoint you when the update is completed.
---
His name could be like the remnant
---
We've had long queue times long before this game even was on consoles.
---
Ok thanks!

We played (PS4) for an hour yesterday and were only able to get 2 matches. IDK if it was new-patch bugs or if hardly anybody is trying to play killer. Demogorgon was hella scary though.
---
Love it
---
I‚Äôm not saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try and win‚Äù I‚Äôm saying try and have a fun match. And the devs promote this, if you get everyone downed instantly, you don‚Äôt pip, but if you have Hook them 8-9 times (can‚Äôt remember) defend your gens, keep pressure and chasing them well grants a merciless victory, you need to get a 4K, yes but if your willing to do literally anything to achieve your goal then at what point does the other side have fun? Same can be said for survivors pursuing killers just to be toxic but still. The only way for all the toxicity to leave dead by daylight is if everyone is actually willing to get rid of it.
---
You do realize this is just a meme to laugh at cause there‚Äôs people who relate too it and chuckle
---
Those aren‚Äôt even close. The toxic SWF group legit ruined the game for me for a bit. Especially since I have nothing really good on Ghost Face and Legion. No Ruin, no BBQ .etc
---
It‚Äôs especially annoying when I‚Äôm Ghost Face and they are doing it, I struggle to catch up with them because he has no mobility. 
---
And it‚Äôs never people who are newbies like me. It seems to always be people with fully stacked perks and amazing items. And I‚Äôm here with my best item and offering being a Mori that lets me execute the last survivor.
---
He's a good looking guy but his beard is all patchy...
---
Not that I could do it better
---
Danke
---
I have the game in both PC and PS4. In my two years of having this game, queue times on console after 10 pm take quite a while when finding matches (7-10 min. for survivors).
---
yeah sometimes you DC but don't leave the game, happened to someone in one of my games too.
---
Also, to damn bad? That is exactly what I‚Äôm taking about. No one thinks of the other side.
---
I‚Äôm not brand new, but I‚Äôm new enough to where I haven‚Äôt mastered every killer, and when I play a killer I‚Äôm not great at the possibility of running into ‚Äúgg ez baby killer‚Äù people kinda makes me wary about trying new killers.
---
Ik these new servers suck
---
Idk man I didn't have any issues with queue last night, queues been much worse before
---
And it‚Äôs not a ridiculous assumption it‚Äôs literally what you said. You said killlers should play how they want and if they want to lagswitch then that‚Äôs you basically saying ‚Äúyeah that‚Äôs how they want to play‚Äù
---
No, people are perfect since day 1, don't worry.
---
And now i join a game and its stuck on infinite loading :) good ol bugs
---
lmao no ps4 gang
---
I would invest in a stick of ram.
---
I could literally stare at this all day ü§§ü§§
---
It should be two players but both need to hit the survivor to down them or it takes 3 hits
---
Mind if I use this template? Thanks
---
damn that is op, thx for telling me
---
Ghostface
---
Same with me lol
---
When you get palleted and 3 generators activate in the same second:  
---
"MINDBREAKER"
---
Also took out being able to chat in the new survivor lobby.
---
Jeez. I had it a lot yesterday after I made that comment. And I only saw one offering
---
He's really good in the right hands,  anyone saying he's mediocre is a bad killer, no offense
---
sweet
---
"Don't get hooked"
---
*Monto with Deliverance, DS, Head On and fire cracker sliely comes into view*
---
Would he make people get cancer? I think this is kinda unecessary, idn ...
---
Idk, as you make it work, you slow the game down more and more.
---
Your comment reads like it was in the wrong meeting room.
---
‚ÄúRule number 587, if a killer does manage to kill any or all survivors, they must then admit to the rules they had broken‚Äù
---
no
---
It actually works decently in gameplay, but downloading and updating games always takes a small eternity
---
x3
---
Then Demo is getting a special skill that only 2 others have.
---
You would assume that but I couldn't even find broken totems. It's very difficult to find totems on this map so far lol.
---
ESCAPE! CAKE
---
Yeah i learn that the hard way yesterday
---
I want all of them back
---
Checking out the DLC like most ppl, the game isn't worth playing long term until the devs do more for endgame rewards and actually police the bad actors out of the community... But playing with friends once in awhile ain't so bad üòÇ
---
You could also try We'll Make It for those faster heals and We'll Gonna Live Forever if you want the extra bp for being the healing/rescue role, have fun! :)
---
I think with the new system it‚Äôs hard to have it since now you‚Äôre always in a lobby as survivor, if you were to switch to killer as like a friend joins it would probably break the game or some shit.
---
Yeah that worked for me too.
---
Either do the gens or be the distraction, and choose quickly cause I just used up my deadhard.
---
We'll add him (and the other missing Prestige flairs) later.
---
Reddit's limit for user flair templates is 300, which we already reached when Ash's DLC released. I had to delete some older flairs to add Ghost Face + basic Stranger Things flairs. Currently, the following items are considered "default user flairs" for each character:
---
* the portrait from the character selection screen
---
* the Adept achievement icon
---
* the Killer Power icon
---
* the three unique perks
---
* the default Head piece 
---
* the prestige'd Head piece
---
That's a minimum of 7-8 user flairs *per character*. Dead by Daylight has currently 36 characters, so it's a total of 288 user flairs. Add some extra flairs (meme-ish things like Freddy's Sweater, naked David, offerings, items, Prestige I-III icons) and we're at the limit. There will be a new DLC in 3 months again with at least one new character (or up to three like the Stranger Things chapter), so in three months we need another 7-8 slots for the default flairs. And so on.
---
Which is why we're thinking about streamlining the user flairs a bit. Cutting the default flairs down to 6 per character would give us more free templates for future DLCs, but it will also mean that there's less variety (or less extras).
---
Yeah, you see the scratches just like the killer sees them.
---
Me n the bois at 2 am lookin for **BEANS**
---
Because I'm sure you were great from the start.
---
It's a high risk high reward perk for me so far, either I can't find anybody to deal or get downed while broken, or second heal comes in clutch and heals me during a chase
---
I think I‚Äôm just gonna crouch in the corner of the map
---
OMG SAME  
---
I was the solo survivor though and they called me ugly XD
---
Bro if my BBQ pops and there's no auras anywhere no shit I'm gonna check the hook every once in a while lmao.
---
Hatch available when 3 gens are left. 3 people left.
---
That‚Äôs so silly too because you can use IS anytime you want, so you should make a play for it while you‚Äôre alone since it‚Äôs active until you use it. If somebody wants to heal you, let them. You can use your perk later let them use their stuff. Also- points n all.

I‚Äôm on Xbox

Are you sure? I mean Dwight's current hair matches his portrait and art more than the last one before the update.
---
No, he was fine. He kept mining the ground before hand, and invited us to his basement of his house called ‚Äúthe killer shack‚Äù. So glad he gave me a pumpkin pie! It was awfly meaty, though.
---
Oh DEFINITELY  
---
I'm like PLEASE DON'T LEAVE THE CHAT SO I CAN GIVE YOU THE FRIENDLY HEADS UP
---
Lyonboum that is pretty mean ngl
---
Otz is different. In one of his videos he called survivors trash and wrote a pinned comment apologizing for it. Dud is super friendly and super chill. 10/10 good boi.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to be tunneled as tunnel Steve!
---
It also means "Did the penis swing?" in couple of Balkans languages.
---
I'll just note that you could mind-game sleeping survivors even without Oblivious, since sleeping survivors can't hear Freddy's terror radius anyway.
---
I just wanted to play killer for once \*cries in Spirit\*
---
Yes!
---
I healed someone from Dying to full and I didn't get it.
---
What do I do to tighten blood points?
---
verify the game files, restart steam if that fails restart PC.
---
Thats ur loss. Farming is no fun
---
always step one for any game when it breaks
---
well the game was supposed to do that before, yet we could still do double and even up to quadra killer games doing exactly that before.
---
\*cries in Spirit Main\*
---
Not logged in
---
I play my usual game no matter how many streamers were offered.
---
You can do whatever you wish.
---
Some people are okay with being trash and that's completely fine too. Enjoy.
---
Damn get a better internet provider..... it‚Äôs 2019
---
Of course he is great, he's Spanish!
---
PLEASE  
---
I NEED DEEP FRIED SPIRIT
---
friend tried all that and it doesn‚Äôt work. there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a solution online too, don‚Äôt think its a common problem
---
Infinite killer lobbies?
---
Cause people are starting to realize how rediculous charging us the same price of **three** characters is to get **one** cosmetic set. Buying two for $7 versus a skin for $10 feels less rediculous than a skin for a dollar less than three new characters.
---
Spoken like a true selfish killer
---
Auric Cells baby!
---
On top of all this, the devs removed Nancy's screaming face that occurred when Freddy pulled someone into the dreamworld, and Freddy's laughter. I miss that little effect.
---
Don't call people shitheads then if you can't take it when they reply
---
Ignoring the reality of it and making a chapter out of it WOULD be really cool, and could flower some really great ideas, but I agree it's too soon, like that shiz is still happening
---
Bird Box dlc confirmed.
---
Netflix strikes again
---
&gt; So you are a killer and you notice that the survivors are going for the save, do you really just ignore it?
---
Nah, I hit the dude.
---
Now he has 2 options - Run me away from the hook so someone can save his team mate or keep kiting me around the hook.
---
His choice but I WILL chase him even if I suspect someone else is going to unhook behind me.
---
Watch PainReliever and No0b3 on youtube. Just binge their videos and you will get a pretty good understanding of how things work and some strategies.
---
Make sure to get my 4 BBQ stacks then max out my other categories without killing anyone.
---
How do you get a flair?
---
If you play killer then Spirit is very powerful (right behind Nurse), and comes with strong perks that work well for a number of other killers. Legion is easy to use, Discordance is good for killers that benefit from survivors grouping up, they get BP very quickly but they struggle with downing survivors. Plague is underappreciated, she has some good perks but has a very specific playstyle that not everyone enjoys (kind of Huntress-meets-Pig). Ghostface is similar to Mike, but his instadown is applied per survivor, so you have more control over when to pop it. Very tricky killer to use if you can't think like a survivor, and his perks aren't particularly powerful.
---
If you play survivor then Adam's Deliverance can be very strong in any SWF, since your buddies know to stay on gens and not come to save you while Deliverance is available. I'm not sure you'd get significant benefit from any of the rest, unless you're building for a specific "role" rather than "meta".
---
Swf ?
---
Everyone is new once
---
You save 1 buck. May as well get Demo tbh. They were really fun on PTB, and it looks like they'll be buffing them soon.
---
This is the bane of my existence.
---
I'm normally a rank 7-10 survivor and I never seem to get anybody lower than rank 11 in any games I play.
---
On the flipside I'm a rank 10-12 killer and I always seem to get at least one red rank. I'd class myself as an average player and you can tell from a mile away when you're playing against survivors waaaay better than you.
---
Also, our consoles take off before every game
---
The update isn't that wonderful. The characters are good but the map is the most annoying one yet and there's a litany of new massive bugs
---
Because they probably had some % of recovery progress. Could have even been so little progress that you weren't able to see it on the bar.
---
Basically what was said.
---
Ben
---
I play the game. Fuck farming ima win my bp fair and square
---
Lol I mean in the future. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do I got him slightly over p1
---
It looks like a testicle
---
yeet
---
yeah pretty much. first killer game played got matched against 3 swf and all were rank 10-7
---
I just lost faith in humanity.
---
The first time you encounter someone named ‚ÄúHex: Devour Ass‚Äù is a truly magical time.
---
Otzdarva. He has two channels, and when he plays he basically gives a real time explanation of what he‚Äôs doing that makes it a good or bad move. He‚Äôs been pretty helpful to me
---
Idk why I tried a slow vault I wasn‚Äôt thinking lol
---
It depends on how I feel like playing in that moment. Tbh I hardly pay attention to what offerings are thrown out while the game is loading. If it‚Äôs double bloodpoint season I‚Äôm more aware of people wanting to farm but usually if I do end up working with the survivors it‚Äôs more for the memes than anything else.
---
Are you really stickying this over the update announcement when it hasn't even been 24 hours yet? Really?
---
Botany knowledge and a medkit
---
Send name
---
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF GENRUSH, I DID A GEN IN 9 SECONDS!
---
Enduring only effects pallet stuns. If you were stunned during your Shred then yeah you will recover faster.
---
I am loving inner strength.  I usually have mall game in my build so it really was a no brainer. It takes a lot less time to heal yourself.  üòä
---
I love ps4 dbd for this reason. So much salt comes from just being a killer on this great ass platform
---
fuck how do I download this
---
*AHHHHHHH*
---
Console lobbies arent actually ad bad as you'd think after they added the game to xbox game pass
---
I wanna be able to put a pic unto the flair!
---
decent at best
---
I run with the survivors gen to gen and help my homies max out and occasionally pick off the slowest to hook so I get my 2 hooks each. Once them gates are open... gloves may come off for the stragglers or excessive tea-baggers / flashlight users. But we should all get our 400%!
---
Oh lol I reported u just tryna act innocent lmao
---
Ingame it looks like something you fight in RE: Outbreak. Its terrifying. The music is amazing and no killer mains have his ability down yet so its GG EZ PZ. Great update. 10/10 would be toxic in exit gate again.
---
Espada Muerta is my gt, everyone on Xbox feel free to add me.
---
Ruin gone in 5
---
I really wanted nancy with her jacket and pony tail hair, kinda sad she got the outfit from season3 cause its not that great lol
---
Usually I'm the one who can't connect cause I have shit luck, but I was actually able to play with only minor disconnects. Are they gonna be doing a patch soon to fix this shit?
---
Everyday i play dbd in a nutshell
---
Why are you playing with rank 20s is the real question here.
---
Surveillance isn't very good since I usually know where survivors are anyway and don't like to waste time kicking gens. Thrilling Tremors is just a straight up bad perk in my opinion. Haunted grounds can be be good, but can also just do nothing.
---
Bet
---
Too many new survivors not enough killers
---
Why must you do this to me the saltiest man alive
---
I dont care if I'm killed but I swear I get tunneled and killed right away, why not just try to hook them all twice before killing them. To be fair if they run back into you and tbag kill them. I'm not saying throw the game but make it worth bring the offering.
---
I can imagine 30 trappers spawning in searching every locker for a baby Dwight.
---
The new chapter brought a wave of new players who will one day be just as good as any of the rest of us, be patient and grateful, we need new players to keep the game alive.
---
How? If they can only do a quarter they can't complete the gen.
---
This is insta lose if you're the last 2.
---
Its waluigi
---
This isn't his start at streaming or even DBD. This man had almost beaten the ENTIRETY or Dark Souls 2 without taking a single hit. He got hit at the very last boss of the 3rd DLC, the last obstacle. Instead of going berserk like many others would, he just got angry for about 10 seconds then went back to being calm and even being relieved that it was over. He has the patience of gods and I don't see that going away from him.
---
stupid question guys, how do you turn on the icons and stuff? I can only see text for my flair? I really want the dead hard icon haha
---
Can you upload the footage?
---
Only camp if its the last throw of the dice when gates are powered and you havent gotten any tbh. Its what i do, i aint gonnq roll over and let all of em escape
---
I bought it, then didn't play it at all yesterday.
---
I think what I‚Äôm going to try out tonight when I get home is running sed care and either inner strength or second wind. I wanna try this cause if you unhook somebody or cleanse your totem you pretty much have a heal that takes a very short time to activate. And if the situation is bad and you can‚Äôt find totems/unhook someone you can just self care. I hope it‚Äôs useful lol
---
Starved troll looking for a new hit from an old source, how sad
---
Instead of dropping Prove Thyself, I would drop Distortion in favor of Spine Chill.
---
Especially if you are playing SWF its easier to stack on gens since you can tell people where you are. So, Lithe, Dance With Me, Spine Chill, Prove Thyself. Thatd be a pretty solid build. 
---
Distortion is cool but very underwhelming as it works on a token basis. Spine Chill, if used right, can actually give you almost the same effect. Ex. If you are healing and Spine Chill lights up then it's safe to say the killer has Nurse's Calling and you can react accordingly to that.
---
*Usually* nobody will initiate that. If you message someone after the game then that's like a 50% chance that they trash talk, if you complain about their playstyle or something along those lines then I would say 80-90% they trash talk.
---
I've got advice for both sides. If you don't want to get camped, don't unhook someone 2 seconds after they walk away from the hook. Also for the demogorgon players, take make your choice. Portals make it easy to proc. It is more beneficial to one tap someone who is healthy because the other person has to heal. Also inadvertently helps tunneling. But yeah, camping makes you lose most of the time so don't do it.
---
TL;DR: If you see a Pig, don't run, boop the snoot! (Caution they may bite...or hook)
---
it took me 30 sec to find this
---
idk fam I played killer for a long time yesterday and the queues were just as short as survivor
---
Playing survivor during the day is fine.. at night it takes FOREVER to get into a lobby
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/vzJhc4l](https://imgur.com/a/vzJhc4l)
---
Always happy to help fat yoshi :)
---
Aw shit bro the freddy went back to check on hook after leaving to check on gens and he found a survivor unhooking his teammate? Bro what a camper! And he hit the person i unhoooked in his face to prevent me from getting bp for a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù unhook? Fucking tunneler bro unbalanced game smh
---
I agree, but I think people just want to use their shiny new perks right now
---
I don't say "you're trash" or insult anyone but I either give people tips or advise them to play differently if they're being an asshole.
---
Puppers, Chala, and Zubat are also worth a watch.
---
Yeah sometimes it shows them getting ready again even they already hit ready, the character's model becomes dark and my friend constantly gets disconnected from the lobby.
---
I unlocked it. I'm playing on console btw
---
Well I've found Second Wind is directly at odds with Babysitter. I get heals when I unhook people but with babysitter, I'm dancing with the killer and running away from my adorable, unhooked child.
---
PS4 doesn't let me put only 2 dollars into it. I have to get either 10 or 15, and I'll choose 10 since I like playing survivor more.
---
You should give it a go.
---
Season 1 and 3 were okay,but season 2 is probably the best thing that I have ever watched.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs said to be the worst season.
---
I have been awake too long.
---
That's what I figured, also that it probably cost them more because the Netflix knew it would make DBD money, not just in DLC, but also in new players, since the franchise is still new and popular. Just didn't seem like a linear cost increase, since part of the "new content" with the DLC is supposed to be the map, but I guess since anyone can play on those, even though they might rarely get sent there, there's non-excludability there.
---
Yeah, there's definitely no synergy.
---
Wow yet another bitch
---
Yeah it‚Äôs very lame.
---
All survivors are the same, if perks work good on one survivor, they will work just as good on any other ones
---
Yeah pretty stupid imo, you can already only use it twice, so why not just making it activate on health state change
---
Had a Claudette run away then self care in front of me when I was trying to get my second wind up
---
I've been told season 2 is the worst by pretty much anyone I've asked. Like objectively flawed. The main crops I've heard our character criticisms or bad character development. Haven't seen the show though so I can't say if I subjectively like it or not. Definitely plan on watching the show now that it's in dead by daylight though. It's the reason why I checked out the Evil Dead tbh.
---
It‚Äôs buggy af atm. Last night I kept running through exit gates only to be re-transported to the center of the map until the Entity killed me.
---
Finish chases faster and gens won‚Äôt go so fast.
---
Killers with traps are really bad aout this, tehy'll just set traps around the map and expect to down the entire lobby and just hook them, hags are much better about this because they can just trap and walk away to do something else, but even then, new players don't realize how much BP they can lose just by standing near a hook.
---
Almost missed it boi
---
Tempted to do one of those "Making a shitpost about how un-friendly the aura and scratch colors are to colorblind folks every day until bhvr lets us change them" type things but I'll be honest I'm not sure I could keep up with it lol, but it might be a way to garner some attention for it on a regular basis
---
So were okay with sexualizing younger people of they're male?
---
Wheres the hatred and fervor like when people sexualized susie/julie?
---
I loved it more than the others.
---
There was a lot of Character development and the DemoDog hunting scene was amazing.
---
Can they just make swf a separate thing again, this really makes me feel like shit for having no friends to play with. Also, i think my lobby times are being effected by the change.
---
The Demogorgon's model looks so.. underwhelming... It looks like raw chicken running around the maps
---
Handy fix - because gen tapping to stop regression wasnt enough of a problem /s .  Maybe if the perk only worked on the last generator you touched,  and had a 90/75/60 cooldown after activating.  Would this hard counter PGtW?
---
Quicksilver - Deliverance is fairly strong.. and Camaraderie seems solid too.  So lets combine both into one super perk, and toss in some BT and a sort of oldschool DS during the last hook just to be sure.   This would be the most meta of meta perks.  SSS tier.   Its effectively 4 perks in one if you are not the first found and tunneled.  
---
Unruly - almost a reverse agitation? likely to throw off allies flashlight saves more then anything. Maybe your most/only balanced idea but doesn't really bring anything new.
---
Engineer - why not affect hook sabo as well?  Its an obvious gen jockey perk, and it buffs the maybe strongest item in the game. May help survivors manage to escape in under two minutes of the match starting.  
---
back breaker - even if it increased regression speed by 100%, it would still be weak.  hell, at 400% regression speed it would only regress at the same speed as a perkless, toolboxless survivor working on it.  And its still stopped by gen tapping. 
---
grim determination - The opposite problem as quicksilver, this would pretty much require the use of both enduring AND spirit fury to be of use some of the time, as with out those you would spend 2 seconds being stunned and 3 seconds breaking the pallet.  Although maybe if you stacked it right you could have silly situations like a wraith moving at 15 m/s for three seconds, or Myers with a 15m lunge.  I also wouldn't put it past crashing the killers client or triggering the anti-cheat in those silly situations.   Easily countered by dropping pallets early which is what is going to happen the second survivors see you are running enduring.
---
Yes, yes.. As you will..
---
I highly doubt they will listen to an illiterate upset teenager
---
Well, I can see dying light being meta for killers, so I would think it would be better, even more if they slam sloppy on top of that
---
How does infectious fright work with Monitor and Abuse? Since you end the chase as you down the person, do you get a +8meters or a -8meters on the screams?
---
Unfortunately, I think it only works in the old Reddit...
---
To many killers, lobby times for survivors are fast unless  someone leaves the lobby.
---
Bigger subreddits outsource the user flairs entirely, but it involves a specific bot and a separate website, and both things need to be maintained and updated frequently. I've been in contact with the developers of our u/rDbD_bot to see if they can help us with this though.
---
What's your goal?
---
I'm on pc, did you do something different from what I described?
---
The shattered bloodline is a a great one. Spirit is one of the best killers in the game. Halloween is an ok one. It has save the best for last on killer and DS for survivor.
---
Can confirm, this is accurate
---
I believe that it's a pretty good game, and it's getting far better with every update. I mainly play killer, simply because I prefer the gameplay and characters, but survivor is pretty fun, too! 
---
I'm not going to lie, the game and it's players can get under your skin, but at the end of the day, if you can get past that, you're going to find a really cool game
---
Yep. Keys and Moris are pretty equivalent imo, in terms of how they make it very hard for their respective teams to lose.
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
From within sounds incredibly overpowered
---
IKR, they grow back before each match anyway.
---
I mean, it looks like you're on low settings, and low settings tend to lose quality to help improve performance.
---
Just to have some killers and survivors I can have fun with. Kate and clown fit that well so
---
Fuck 'hem, shouldn't have chose to play killer, that is for the people that enjoy suffering. /s
---
Oh wow. Sorry for spreading wrong info
---
This really how it be tho when you run second wind :(
---
I respectfully disagree
---
Solo‚Äôs can all join in at once now
---
Which platform do you use? PC? Mobile apps?
---
Had the same bug right now, i understand your frustration
---
Im on mobile
---
Self Care v2
---
This. As killer ALL survivors are my level or higher.
---
As survivor no matter how high I go, I get lumped with rank 16-20. So even though the killer might be rank 11-15 and not so great, it doesnt matter because the rank 16-20 players I get stuck with cost us the game.
---
Its infuriating and the reason I stopped caring about rank as survivor. Whats the point in ranking up if I keep getting put with conpletely new players that get pulled out of lockers every 60 seconds?
---
It‚Äôs funny cause these perks actually aren‚Äôt half bad
---
Lmfao the perk is one of the best released lately and you want a huge buff on it whereas Demogorgon has low tier perks, no thanks.
---
If they changed it to how you want then it has two upsides and no downside. Making it a game breaking required perk and in turn making all survivors only truly have three perk slots and all killers become unbalanced as they‚Äôre 10% slower than intended.
---
I actually do like how pig plays, and her stealth and aggressive mechanics are a draw, but I do have videos saved on all the killers and survivors I want to see if I‚Äôd like them and what the consensus is behind them
---
&gt; And the fact that no major bugs, as of today, have been accidentally added in, is amazing!
---
Well. I agree that the chapter is excellent, but there have definitely been a lot of new bugs introduced with this update. Infinite loading screens are back, SWF and matchmaking in general is super buggy, portals sometimes cause semi-permanent obliviousness, Dying Light crashes the game, and these are just the ones I‚Äôve seen personally.
---
Yes. Hopefully they add more cosmetics in the future. That red/brown jacket she had on in season one would have been good.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, she is indeed a great killer. Wasn‚Äôt in my interest until I heard about how good she is, and how frequent Adam Francis is now
---
The only experience that I had where I could relate with this problem was playing PSX NTCS games on a PAL TV (it turned to black and white - and in Silent Hill there is a colour puzzle).
---
&gt; Last time I played as a trap-based killer 
---
Are you sure that you are talking about the Demogorgon?
---
I will Play the game normally, I am a killer after all not some survivor controller muppet bound by any made up rules
---
To be fair the hitbox is kinda garbo
---
Perhaps get the hag one. She can be hilariously fun and you get the best killer perk in the game ruin
---
They could at least make a perk that would benefit colour blind players
---
Not really, unless by "baiting salt" you really mean making yourself look like a foolish prick.
---
As far as I understood it doesn't work on wielder, only on those who are in vicinity of 5/6/7 AoE. Which doesn't seem really that OP, just means that if you are an Obsession - you become the stinky
---
If I somehow manage to learn where to go on this map I‚Äôll really be impressed lol... pretty much a maze from what I‚Äôve seen xd
---
She‚Äôs a character you get base. Or at least on console.
---
I honestly want this way more than scoops ahoy
---
And this why survivors describe killers as "sweaty."
---
I'm on Xbox, and in the morning, survivor queue times are instant, killer takes 10 minutes, but in the evening, killer queue times are instant, and survivor takes 10 minutes
---
Fools rush in.
---
Int3r4ct has some pretty good killer guides, I think the series is called entity education
---
please stop
---
you know what, FUCK COMPANY POLICY
---
The option was able years ago, but they took out because killers were dogging lobby‚Äôs when  higher rank survivors entered.
---
&gt; what the consensus is behind them
---
Consensus won't be about how fun a certain killer is, just how strong/weak (and even that is debatable).
---
And survivors are just skins basically, so maybe just browse through the store to see what outfits you do like the most?
---
usually it'd be 4 default including me, it felt nice that way.
---
but prob just coincidence
---
If you can get a good basement spawn and all four of them are playing together, if you hook one in the basement it‚Äôs almost always at least a 3k.
---

A. We‚Äôre not all supported by trust funds, good internet is expensive.         
---
B. Also, I live out in the country, there aren‚Äôt a lot of options.          
---
Stop being so ignorant that you think everyone can have good internet in this day an age, not everyone can.
---
&gt;if they changed it to how you want then it has two upsides and no downside. Making it a game breaking required perk....
---
By this logic BBQ&amp;Chili is "game breaking"
---
Weird, I never see people with cosmetics
---
I always felt that it is rediculous that a skin costs more than two playable characters.
---
That part I kinda like, but there's so much background noise it's hard to tell what's going on around you. Which does make things a bit trickier, I guess.
---
It was a question but okay.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought colourblind meant they could still see the colour but not like we do, for example, seeing dark blue and dark green as the same thing?
---
That‚Äôs like big brain plays
---
I base mostly survivors on the perks they have and their design so. Plus what i mean is what the community thinks of them overall
---
I guess Steve being trapped by the entity means he is in his own Neverending Story.
---
Oh so it‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúthis is why we can‚Äôt have nice things‚Äù moments
---
&gt; you get the best killer perk in the game ruin
---
best perk? more like "most overrated"
---
Gotta agree, I'm loving how they managed to get the new killer so perfect
---
Oof does this mean I‚Äôll get jumpscared even more by stealth killers? F
---
I have the same question
---
You‚Äôre correct.
---
For me it greatly depends on the survivors. I usually only farm if multiple dcs occur, so even with 4 streamers I‚Äôll play normally. I did have one game on a double bp event we‚Äôre all 5 of us used streamers, and they all lined up on the steps. I really just wanted to play the game, so I shook my head at them for a few seconds before attacking. Game went on normally from there, but I did have one guy dc before I ever hooked him.
---
Played only 1 match as Dwight, got 4 out of generators before getting caught by the demo-gorgon, thought it was a good match so I tried queue for a second got a matchmaking error than a 3rd before it went into a infinite search loop forcing me to quit the game.
---
The swamp maps are very weird. They are the only maps in which totems and gens spawn on the perimeter of the map.
---
Note: In my experience, totems always spawn in the corners (like this one) behind the fallen trees.
---
Start a queue after rank reset is your best bet
---
Xbox is my platform it usally takes about 10 seconds before i join the lobby
---
We played against each other? Where did "sweaty" come from?
---
Die
---
There's no way in hell they didn't look ahead for future cosmetics, especially since Stranger Things is so big and Ash is getting cosmetics

I heard Shock Therapy is a good way to cure it!
---
As a survivor main this map will be a pain ahah
---
Stop what?
---
I got dbd to play as a Ruthless killer, not some farming simulator 2019 dbd edition.
---
Til you figure out how to loop every killer to oblivion on this map xD
---
She got key.
---
This is due to a bug where he killer's game crashes when they put someone on a hook. Happened to me too last night. This update has issues.
---
Gotta watch the scene after the credits of season 3
---
Beans
---
Oh I really hope so lmao
---
Otz is such a nice guy. Really love the content and I am happy to see everyone recommending to new ppl!
---
They have done this since the Clown. It‚Äôs not something they did just for Stranger Things.
---
I haven‚Äôt been so scared of this game since Michael came out
---
I dont really see this as a developer issue, stale mates happen
---
The delusion you have of survivors is amazing. Unless you‚Äôre doing SWF, survivors are usually selfish and don‚Äôt do totems during a match, don‚Äôt save unless they are guaranteed to escape, and yes, they do usually solely hard focus gens to insta escape now that you bring it up. Don‚Äôt be an ass and try and tell others how to play, I still max out my blood points playing normally, not camping, not tunneling, and not farming, which used to be known as boosting honestly.
---
Let‚Äôs see you do better :/
---
Halloween III season of the witch?
---
Oh ok! I suggest spirit then, also good perks!
---
Didnt expect them to buff wraith by giving him a sniper rifle
---
Well yes you can physically reach where she is, just so happens if you tried she‚Äôd escape. There‚Äôs spots like this on lots of maps.
---
Just so ya'll know, if you hit the obsession with shred while having STBFL it doesn't take away your stacks
---
Camping and tunneling is allowed.
---
This makes it seem almost sweet üòÖ
---
He seems pretty balanced tbh with this new change
---
I was playing Huntress yesterday on the new map and a Steve asked me why I wasn't playing as demogorgon. 
---
because.... I'm all out of MONEY!!!
---
If you hadnt have said it you wouldnt have found it
---
Idk, i think the new map is incredibly well made
---
Rank has his head so far up his ass it‚Äôs incredible, I doubt we will be able to reason with him.
---
I never said it wasn't...

---
I'm killing myself if they add another stealth killer, just saying
---
but personally i don't manage to make it activates itself. I heal someone to full with a medkit and the perk stay grey
---
But it‚Äôs end game collapse so you get her either way.
---
Yeah but it's not fun for when you're playing the survivor.
---
That's essentially in essence what it is, yes. The problem is with Protan and Deutan colorblindness, Greens and Reds and sometimes Oranges and Blues blend in together. With the heavy reliance on all four of those colors for various realm colors, and dark red being the aura color, without a filter that makes my game look like [this](https://imgur.com/ujiSADT) the game is extremely hard to play as killer, to the point of it basically being like playing without any of the aura-related info whatsoever
---
JEEPERS CONFIRMED
---
Tweet it to Netflix they were all aboard for scoops ahoy
---
Ight imma sprint burst outta this thread
---
Good.
---
meta is still is the same for 1 year or more for survivors.
---
Oink
---
Jeez.
---
Probably because everything is on sale. So this includes charity case, head case and the blood stained sack. These are all cosmetic DLC‚Äôs
---
Okay the only thing that needs buffing is to make it so so walk fast while injured. Urban evasion used to only work while uninjured. Anyway it's just my opinion
---
I wanted waxhead DarkSouls 3 wraith but I settle for hallow eyes :D
---
Oh well. Getting hit by DS after you hooked two other people isn't fun. Getting gen rushed isn't fun. Having three Survivors DC so their friend can get hatch isn't fun, especially when you de pip because of it.
---
I mean, I was decayed from rank 1 to 18 so this was pretty much me yesterday. Although I was doing perkless demogorgon.
---
:)
---
btw guys it let me in when you reverify your game files and relaunch steam :) hope this helps
---
&gt;"I mean.. what's wrong with that?"  
---
They are terms which are often used by incels or people who think they're much smarter than they really are.  
---
&gt;"If anything he is using the MOST proper terminology. We should be scoffing at you for using the term "woman" to refer to a female human. Jeez read a science book."  
---
Oh. Oh, I see. You're one of them. Ew.
---
it's to be used with a full ninja build. Something like Inner strength, Dance with me, Q&amp;Q and Lithe or Fixated
---
Maybe dont play with rank 20s 4head. You can see ranks before the game starts now. Use the new feature
---
IM GETTING DECENT AT THE NURSE AND IM FUCKING HAPPY ABOUT IT
---
.
---
BBQ doesn‚Äôt give you a solid edge like 10% speed. Killer perks that allow such speed are super strong but require effort to keep them. So if 10% was allowed in any heal state it would need consequences like actions stop the speed boost for a minute or even in injured state the boost is reduced to 2%
---
Ive played enough solo games to know that most killers will do whatever they have to do to win with the least effort possible. BP doesnt matter. Enjoyable games dont matter.
---
Doesnt matter if its a 3v1 with 4 gens to go. Sweat sweat sweat. 
---
Doesnt matter that half the survivors are clearly rank 20's with no concept of how to play. Sweat sweat sweat. 
---
Doesnt matter that slugging survivor #3 to deny survivor #4 the hatch will make the match take 5 min longer, nope, gotta guarantee that 4k. Sweat sweat sweat.
---

---
So it's not just me then. I guess that's a relief‚Ä¶ Still, if they could fix that, that'd be amazing.
---
I do, it would have been a nice addendum to the roster of maps
---
Democorgin!
---
&gt;10/10 would be toxic in exit gate again.
---
You're so cool.
---
I wish the devs would add more mori animations for a the killers. I would gladly shell out some cash for cool looking moris
---
YES!
---
How would the entity manage to get the demogorgon to hook survivors? I even feel like mori would be a default for it.
---
They said it works only outside of TR on the chapter reveal stream, but actually there's no such condition in the game. Maybe they got rid of it in the process.
---
I didn't know this was a bug, however, he didn't hook anyone. Claudette DC'd after getting picked up, the killer stopped moving after about a second (you can see him in the background) stood still for about a second and then the game ended
---
I SUCK AT DEMOGORGON YES I UNDERSTAND HE JUST CAME OUT BUT IM DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF
---
GET ALL THIS AWESOME CONTENT AND NOW THE GAME IS BROKEN! IM A RANK 8 SURVIVOR SOLO QUEING AGAINST RANK 19 KILLERS AND I JUST FEEL ASHAMED AND BAD! DEAD HARD DOESN‚ÄôT WORK ONCE AGAIN
---
Botany and pharmacy is a decent combo
---
As cool as you?
---
Those two perks don‚Äôt interact at all
---
So your logic is that it doesnt matter if it isnt fun for survivors the killer can do it. Yet, the other things you mentioned isnt fun for the killer so they shouldn't do it? Also, people still complain about DS?
---
Have you been a killer with 5/10/15% speed boost? It‚Äôs insane and a team can easily lose vs someone who can instantly down or noed. So 10% flat out for every survivor forever would make the slow killers need even bigger reworks imagine if they gave bubba 10% speed plus his incoming rework to make him better.
---
I'm talking about scratch mark jukes. If you run round a corner you can walk over to that corner and hide while potentially causing the killer to walk on in the direction of your scratch marks.
---
Congrats! I just got mine the other day on my 2nd attempt (really my 1st true attempt). I used Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, PWYF and Whispers. I also waited until rank reset so I could go up against babies. Whispers was super helpful throughout the whole match for finding survivors. When it came time to close the hatch I found it pretty fast and the last survivor was a meg with a crow, probably shitting her pants in fear.
---
OH FUCKING MONKEY BALLS BUT I DESPISE THE NEW MAP!! WEIRD LIGHT, BODIES THAT MAKE ME THINK I HAVE FOUND A SURVIVOR AND WEIRD GODDAMN FLOW!!!
---
So if I get the +35% on a skill check, that does not count up with second wind?
---
Found the entitled salty survivor... Which page is it in the survivor rule book for killers ? And also, if i‚Äôm at 1 000 000 BP why would i give a shit about 4 BPS ?
---
Literally just had three red ranks and a rank 10, and I'm a lowly rank 17. I just wanted to get my ritual done, and instead I got a SWF butt-dancing combo in my face.
---
The actual truth
---
Found the salty killer
---
Something not recommended but it allows you to do stuff that Apple don‚Äôt want you to do. It also puts you at risk of getting a virus or download malware as you can download more dodgy apps.
---
Top 4 imo
---
doesn‚Äôt really ruin anything for the killer..
---
Lmao so basically what you're saying is "they're used by people who think the words they use are better than the words others use"
---
While you tell someone that the words they are using are wrong and they should use different words lmfao
---
Hypocrite alert!!! Also spoilers: I was joking dumbass. The entire point was to show how ridiculous you sound telling someone what words to use. Which you agreed with. Sooooo you basically agree you're being an ass lmao 
---
But you're right. Your way is best any anyone who is different must be trying to be a prick. You win grammar nazi of the year award.
---
True is pretty similar to Otz in terms of personality. True just has a "resting bitchface" and gets consistently stream sniped along with his more irritable British attitude to make him seem 'bad' but he really isnt. Most people who play killer at rank 1 act pretty salty because of how broken survivors are when they know what they're doing. Otz is a standout because he is particularly chipper regardless, but I would doubt most people can replicate this chillness he has.
---
WHY THE FUCK SPIRIT EXIST
---
I think season 1 was incredible, meanwhile other two were still good but I enjoyed them little bit less.
---
added them as well!
---
What you fail to realise is that this is a good marketing strategy for them. They are not trying to satisfy or make people that only want to spend "A few dollars" on skins happy. They target the people that happily spend 10 dollars on a skin. I'm one of those people and if a skin i like comes out, i will buy it. Because you know what? I can afford it and at the same time i support the game i love. If it's not worth it to you then stop whining.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people don‚Äôt play Hag more. I main her all the time, and I haven‚Äôt fought against one in over 3 months.
---
[STILL NO FUCKING COLORBLIND SETTINGS FOR AURAS AND SCRATCH MARKS, IT'S BEEN CONSTANTLY REQUESTED FOR THREE YEARS NOW SINCE THE GAME RELEASED, THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS. JUST LET ME PLAY THE GAME WITH THE INTENDED AESTHETIC SO I DON'T HAVE TO USE AN AWFUL COLOR FILTER FOR FUCKS SAKE](/intensifies)
---
Survive with friends, yeah. We use discord to talk and work through things.
---
Please don‚Äôt
---
You're a fucking clown dude. An absolute fucking clown.
---
That's some hard backpedalling there, honey. Bye-bye now.
---
Steve's perk never works for me I healed 3 people with no medkit and it did nothing
---
If the self care can heal chainsaw hits, why it can't heal cancer
---
We need Corpsepaint Jeff flair!!!!!!!!
---
Means you're a crap killer tho.
---
Happened to me too. Had a cannibal daily trashed and got a repair gens one. Went Surv to equip perks and checked hiw many I needed, then it was a Trapper daily.
---
I play against at least one Hag on most game sessions. They're definitely around, just most folks don't play her because there's easier options. It's why you see Huntress, Spirit, Billy, Nurse. They just have an easier time. Hag is just Trapper with more map control.
---
Honestly, bond/empathy/Nancy‚Äôs perk that lets other see gens could probably be more useful if your team isn‚Äôt full potato
---
And the cashier
---
I agree, new list is:
---
Nurse
---
Spirit
---
Hillbilly/Demo
---
Hag
---
Huntress
---
Freddy
---
Ghostface/Myers
---
Pig
---
Plague
---
Trapper
---
Clown
---
Legion
---
Wraith
---
Agreed.
---
So your asking if you heal someone with autodidact does it count towards activating second wind?
---
More or less but the top is just like my list
---
*realizes I'm right * promptly ends conversation to prevent further humiliation* 
---
Lmfao I love it. Have a nice day sugar-tits. Or am I not allowed to say that either?
---
I'd shit if they did a Mystery Inc Chapter....!
---
You heal a Survivor to get Second Wind. When you are unhooked, being outside of the Killers Terror Radius for 20 seconds, triggers the perk and it Insta-heals you.
---
WHY THE FUCK CAN THEY NOT RELEASE UPDATES WITHOUT EVERYTHING BREAKING! TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES TO DO A KYF LAST NIGHT WITH NOTHING BUT "DISCONNECTED FROM HOST" OR SOMEONE NOT LOADING COMPLETELY INTO THE LOBBY. THEY HAD THE LOADING ISSUE IN THE PTB, FIX YOUR SHIT IF IT'S ALREADY KNOWN!
---
NEW DLC FINALLY DROPS AND GAME BREAKS DOWN SO I CAN'T EVEN PLAY IT. I HAVE A VERY LIMITED TIME TO PLAY GAMES AND IT CHOSE THAT EXACT TIME TO GO DOWN. IT BETTER BE WORKING PERFECTLY TONIGHT OR SO HELP ME
---
What launcher?
---
BECAUSE SHE FUCKING CAN
---
They shouldve kept it as an add-on, imo
---
What‚Äôs yours?
---
Perk 1. Hook transport: screw all the current saving perks just take the hook with you usable 1/2/3 times per match 
---
Perk 2. Switch-a-roo: give the killer a taste of their own medicine and put them on the hook for 2/3/4 seconds they can always get off useable 1/1/2 per match
---
Perk 3. Cartoon Reality: literally anything shaggy and scooby do in any of their chases (look them up)
---
Did you fully heal them? 
---
And remember if you are afflicted by the [Broken status effect](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Status_HUD) the perk does not activate.
---
Also, it only happens when you get unhooked!
---
If you do all of the above and it still doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs probably a bug and I expect that it will be fixed soon!
---
WHY HUNTRESS ISNT NAKED
---
forever mooooooood
---
I even came up with some joke perks
---
FUCKING HELL, P3 LEVEL 50 AND I STILL HAVE NO GOOD LOOPING PERKS FOR MY DOCTOR
---
I reckon it'd be worth it if you ran we'll make it to get the quick heal off hooks
---
he doesn‚Äôt seem to bright lmao
---
he had a hard night respect him
---
Demo Dog
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm replying to the guy who seems to think that the perk grants you 10% speed boost while running or something. Walking survivors are slow as hell. You can try juking with it but you can juke with plenty of existing perks, and yet the meta remains perks that support an aggressive playstyle, not stealth. Fixated SHOULD work while injured, it would make it better but it still wouldn‚Äôt disrupt the meta imo.
---
3v1 games don‚Äôt even load anymore, everyone just gets kicked to lobby.
---
If I‚Äôm somehow matched against low rank survivors, I‚Äôm not gonna tunnel or play dirty, but I‚Äôm not giving them handouts either. 
---
I could argue your last point, but it is pretty obvious you‚Äôre just entitled honestly, and want bp to be handed to you, and anything the killer does to earn bp (you know, the same thing survivors are doing), is ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù. 
---
I really like how you try and justify it by saying killers don‚Äôt care about a fun game. They wouldn‚Äôt be playing if they weren‚Äôt having fun kid. It is not the killers job to ensure the survivors have ‚Äúa fun game‚Äù, which usually means the killer lets them all escape to the entitled survivors.
---
AND ON THAT SUBJECT I WISH WE COULD GET AN ACTUAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM THE DEV TEAM THAT THEY KNOW THIS FEATURE HAS BEEN REQUESTED BY MORE THAN A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE OTHER THAN ONE OR TWO DEVS REPLYING TO THREADS ABOUT IT ONCE EVERY 6 OR SO MONTHS WITH "I'LL SEND IT UP THE PIPELINE" AND THEN NO FURTHER NEWS ON IT BUT HEY WHAT THE HELL CAN YOU DO
---
Nah mate, best. Perhaps alongside some of the other staples like spirit fury
---
Locker jumpers where the hardest part of getting Evil Incarnate. I ended up doing something a little cheeky to counter that though. I'd grab them from a locker and try to get to an area of the map where, if they did wiggle off, forced them into a position where they were body blocked between me and something else. I wasn't sure if that would work, but turns out it worked like a charm. They obviously weren't very happy about that, but hey, gotta do what you gotta do to get those achievements.
---
I SPIT OUT MY DRINK
---
Doesn't seem too far off honestly with the way he screams
---
I dont run no mither or deliverance and I fully healed 3 people before I was unhooked
---
By that do you mean I can get a virus by choosing to download other stuff or I‚Äôm at risk of a virus by just having it?
---
I‚Äôd personally wonder why you wouldn‚Äôt spend some of those points if you plan to keep playing, but agree otherwise.
---
Its the same model they used in the series
---
That‚Äôs odd. It really should activate! It works fine here
---
FUCK THAT STUPIDNSHAPE OFFERING THAT LETS HIM STAY T3. WHAT THE FUCK THE WHOLE POINT IS TO EARN A SHORT PERIOD OF EXPOSURE.
---
He had a lot to make up for
---
Eh, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too op. Especially since the recovery is the same as a whiffed attack. Rest assured he won‚Äôt devour pallets like Billy does for breakfast.
---
Yeow
---
Are you PC or console? I play on ps4 and it doesnt work
---
PS4 mate
---
Right?  xD
---
Hmm that's weird, well thanks for the help
---
I didn't have any problems on ps4 lol
---
Oh the recovery is the same? That's fine then
---
Yes thank you mods I feel complete &gt;:D
---
I use nova launcher but I think any other popular one has the same feature
---
I like how sexual images of men are upvoted on this sub but if it's a women it's demeaning and needs to be on a porn sub.
---
I ESCAPED USING NANCY AND HER 3 PERKS AND STILL DIDNT GET THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR SOME REASON
---
I usually spend 50K bp, then rise back to 1 000 000 then spend another 50k etc
---
While I don't know the details others have reported a similar issue
---
BECAUSE HER OUTFITS ALL LOOK AWESOME AND GETTING HIT BY A PALLET WHILE NAKED HURTS PROBABLY
---
he's beautiful.....
---
And all the rest is in the middle
---
The ability to break pallets with shred is actually slower then breaking a pallet normally meaning if you spam it on every pallet the survivors will just gain distance, it's just meant to allow you to play more aggressive not as a alternative to breaking pallets I also feel it won't buff him that much as the add-on didn't really help at all against non potatoes
---
I ACTUALLY THINK HE IS QUITE STRONG SO FAR!! I ALSO SUCK WITH HIM BUT I THINK HE IS AROUND NEW FREDDY LEVEL ONCE WE GET GOOD WITH HIM!! JUST KEEP PRACTICING
---
Ah, that's actually pretty smart. Glad it worked out for you!
---
I‚Äôve been on reddit for a while but never really understood how you feel these, can I get an explanation?
---
Yes it causes crash on pc too
---
I FUCKING NEED MORE BLOODPOINTS!! THIS GRIND IS RIDICULOUS DROP THE DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS!!!
---
You wouldmt downvote this puppy üê∂

YES I KNOW I SUCK I'VE BEEN PLAYING FOR TWO DAYS. I DON'T WANT TO PAIR WITH RED AND PURPLE RANKS EITHER. STOP FUCKING TELLING ME I'M SHIT AND TELL ME HOW TO GET BETTER YOU FUCKING NOODLES.
---
^^^
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
ALL THESE PEOPLE PLAYING DEMO ARE ALREADY TRYHARDING AND FACE-CAMPING AND IT'S SO DAMN ANNOYING. ALSO WAAAAY TOO MANY BUGS THAT THE GAME IS ALMOST UNPLAYABLE.
---
FUCK! THEN MEG?
---
I misworded the original post never meant to throw the game or just farm but make it enjoyable for everyone and let everyone try ti get some points not saying killers should sacrifice their points but without the survivors they couldnt get those points. Was just asking for a little more chill game if one were to come across that
---
JESUS CHRIST, WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE TO LITERALLY GO SUPER SWEATY TRYING TO GET A 4K?! I HAD A MATCH THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OVER IN LIKE 8 MINUTES BUT TURNED INTO 20 MINUTES CAUSE THE KILLER SLUGGED THE ONLY OTHER SURVIVOR JUST SO HE COULD KEEP LOOKING FOR ME. THEY WERE RANK 16 TOO, I EXPECT THIS FROM PURPLE OR RED RANKS BUT NOT IN THE LOW RANKS.
---
Most wholesome post on this entire sub. I wish I could get more survivors who acted like this

HOW COME DEMOGORGON‚ÄôS TELEPORT ISN‚ÄôT NEARLY AS GOOD AS EITHER OF THE OTHER TELEPORTS? SHRED ISN‚ÄôT NEARLY AS GOOD AS THE MAP PRESSURE THEY PROVIDE.
---
EXAMPLE: AS HAG, IF SOMEONE TRIPS YOUR TRAP, YOU CAN INSTANTLY ZOOP OVER THERE AND BEGIN A CHASE. PLUS, HER BLACKENED CATALYST IS MUCH FASTER TO SET AND HAS LESS VALUE AFTER DESTRUCTION. FREDDY CAN APPLY GENERATOR PRESSURE AND FEIGN A TELEPORT IN ORDER TO DRIVE A SURVIVOR AWAY FROM THE FEIGN AND TOWARDS FREDDY. NURSE IS NURSE.

DEMOGORGON, HOWEVER, REQUIRES YOU TO PLACE TRAPS IN KEY POSITIONS THAT WILL SEE FREQUENT USE, BECAUSE ONCE THEY‚ÄôRE DOWN, THE SURVIVORS DETERMINE IF YOU GET ANOTHER PORTAL AT ALL. AND HE CAN‚ÄôT EVEN BREAK A CHASE AFTER A SURVIVOR STEPS ON AN ACTIVATED PORTAL BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT YOU NEED TO REACH ANOTHER PORTAL OR WASTE A PORTAL IN ORDER TO GET TO IT, AND HIS STEALTH IS COMPROMISED BY HOW FUCKING LOUD HIS FOOTSTEPS ARE. PLUS, 9/10 TIMES IT FEELS LIKE KILLER INSTINCT ON HIS PORTALS DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN WORK! WHY IS HIS POWER SO INFERIOR? GRANTED, IT IS A TREAT TO HAVE A SURVIVOR DESTROY A PORTAL TOPSIDE IN THE SHACK AND YOU EMERGE FROM BELOW AND GRAB THEM OFF A GENERATOR, BUT THAT‚ÄôS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ITS LACKLUSTER EFFECT ANYWHERE ELSE.
---
MAYBE IT‚ÄôS JUST ME, BUT DEMOGORGON DOESN‚ÄôT FEEL SATISFYING TO PLAY OR EVEN THAT EFFECTIVE. I COULD BE COMPLETELY WRONG THOUGH.
---
Whatever man. 
---
When i play killer and the survivors all offer BPS, which rarley if ever happens, i take advantage. 
---
When i play killer and run a train on survivors that are clearly solos amd worse them me, I make sure I hook everyone 3 times and max my BP. Why? Because its clear as day the game is already over, so im going to get the most out of it. 
---
You have zero fucking self awarness and think all survivors want to be gifted an escape. Theres no reason at all for me to attempt to explain this to you.
---
YEAH BUT IT TAKES TWICE AS LONG TO REACH T3, WHICH BASICALLY MEANS TO NEED TO FULLY STALK 3 (OR ALL 4, I ACTUALLY DON'T REMEMBER BECAUSE HONESTLY I DONT PLAY MIKE THAT MUCH) SURVIVORS JUST TO ACTIVATE IT, AND IF ONE OF THEM IS PARTICULARLY SLIPPERY OR DISCONNECTS OR SOMETHING IT'S JUST A FUCKING WASTE OF A RED ADD-ON
---
I still wouldn't agree that demo is the worst. His lunge is serviceable in chase and the traps cant be cleared until they are used once. He does need better addons tho. The upside down travel speed is way too slow.
---
DEFINITELY NOT 4 BECAUSE I HADN'T SEEN HIM ALL GAME MY DUMBASS TEAMMATES HANDED HIM T3 A MINUTE INTO THE GAME
---
Dude. Come now. The question is can he use Autodidact to heal the survivor, or will it negate the full heal required for second wind, because of the skull check bonuses?
---
Unrelated note - I play killer around R15 and I'm seeing a LOT more kinda-clueless Steves and Nancies. I suppose that'd be alright, but they also seem to be extremely salty and DC really often, so...
---
I think they're point is more "if y'all can use cheese tactics so can I".
---
That would be absolutely fantastic, Im pretty seasoned at the game, But using an app for it would be fantastic.
---
I‚Äôm curious now too.
---
Dart did nothing wrong.
---
I'm 99% sure that it's +8 meters. I've seen a lot of nurses run ruin/monitor/infectious fright/nurses. Outside chases it hides your terror when you're on the outer edge of nurses calling, and inside chases it gives you a 40 meter infectious fright.
---
But... Why would it ever negate it? Lol
---
That actually caught me off guard and I barely avoided laughing out loud at work
---
Think of shred like revving a billy saw. If know a survivor will drop it early than it‚Äôll save you time walking over and kicking it. You can also cancel the activation start-up like a billy saw creating mind games with survivors. 
---
So for example, quickly activate/deactivate the shred ability pressuring the survivor to loop the pallet again allowing you to get a free hit. If they start to drop pallets early than preemptively use shred to delete the pallet.
---
That's actually really interesting
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night, delude yourself if you wish. Convince yourself you aren‚Äôt entitled because someone doesn‚Äôt play the way YOU think they should play. That‚Äôs my whole point, which just flies right over your head, you have zero right to tell others how to enjoy the game, or how best to play it. See you in the fog junior.
---
THAT'S A GALACTIC SIZED BRUH MOMENT TO BE HONEST. DID ONE OF THEM SHROUD OR SOMETHING AND THEY ALL SPAWNED TOGETHER? THAT'S THE ONLY REASONING I CAN THINK OF. MAYBE IT'S 4 WITH TOMBSTONE AS WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT I'M THINKING OF.
---
Hag is Trapper who traded in loop breaking power for incredible map pressure. She‚Äôs certainly not bad, but you need MYC to make her really damn good.
---
I see what you are saying OP, and i agree. These guys have no fucking self awarness at all.
---
He is such a good boi. He gets face camped with noed and he will still be nice.
---
I played a game a while back (maybe a year and a half), where there was a hag on swamp and she killed everyone because they kept searching for the totem (it was rank 20 gameplay). It was all the way in an isolated corner of the map behind a tree that it didn‚Äôt even seem you could get behind. She was nice enough to show it to me before giving me hatch.
---
Because BHVR sucks, and they could very easily have forgotten to code in healing progression bonuses from autodidact to still count towards second wind.
---
I DONT KNOW BUT FUCK PLAYING AN ENTIRE MATCH EXPOSED
---
its 12 dollars..
---
Made a video for you https://imgur.com/a/QNvwZVL for mobile reddit app
---
WHY THE FUCK FACECAMPING STILL A THING
---
Reddit app? If so I have a video I just made for you guys https://imgur.com/a/QNvwZVL
---
Honestly... I'd SLAM
---
HE GOT A HAIRCUT? fuck that shit
---
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO RUN AROUND WITH BARE FEET
---
Convinced that myers has a teleport power that barely anyone knows about
---
Ghostface and Ash got/will get cosmetics after release. It could be a scenario of the outfits agreed upon when they paid for the license, and then BHVR is just polishing them to release them. They prob prioritized scoops because of the hype.
---
Dudududududduuduudududududududududududuuddududududuudududududududududuudududududjdu am i funny yet
---
I've been using it on my Kate all day. It's fine where it's at.
---
You‚Äôll be burned at the stake for this opinion, but I agree
---
You can only get hit by DS if you tunnel LMFAO.
---
What I never said it gives you a running speed boost tf
---
This happen to me this morning!
---
I know right? I‚Äôm glad he is becoming more popular and with ochido banned AND the stranger things dlc coming out I hope he raises a bunch of strong and nice killers
---
Pedophilia vs Normal, Regular human behaviour
---
I despise Ochido, can you tell?
---
It‚Äôs totally fair for survivors to see if killers want to boost, just not for survivors to get pissy  when they don‚Äôt. Not saying that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre doing, just putting the other sides perspective out there.
---
Just happens again. Appears to happen every time there‚Äôs I get a hook with 2 survivors remaining.
---
The Gorgon has scared me more times on this game than any other killer. It‚Äôs that roar üòÇüòÇ
---
Actually shred won't really save any time because it's longer then the regular cool down I believe meaning the survivor will still get distance even if they drop pallets a little early also even if you charge it up then cancel it you still lose distance because of the slow down, the buff definitely won't place the demogorgon high tier as it's slower to break pallets with,faking a pallet break still makes you lose distance and it's just better to break it normally.
---
Yes. Let‚Äôs repeat this with earape over 100 times for cash money
---
Yeah, thanks for doing the community a service.
---
Damn you Americans and your sales.
---
Exactly. Just stop tunneling and you‚Äôll only receive it once in a while.
---
Yes and no one blames you
---
Good boi points +7393
---
Are you on the reddit app
---
I know. It makes them looks so out of place. I think it‚Äôd look better if they were 3D
---
i hope they release more non-human killers in the future, they really add a special type of variety to the game i feel  
---
The animation of the demogorgon crawling over windows is really really nice
---
SPIRIT IS NO FUCKING HARD, JUST FUCKING GET OVER IT
---
I mean, its fairly easy to despise a pedo, what a disgusting human being
---
The sub reddit has flairs like mini pictures next to others names
---
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda weird how little the ST subreddit is even talking about this game. I think the trailer on their reddit, barely got 300 upvotes.
---
They must be a noob lol
---
I didn't get to play against a single Demogorgon yesterday, but I did play against a pig who trapped me first, tunneled me off my first hook, and proceeded to chase me around the entire match. I just want to enjoy the new content :(
---
Wouldnt it just be easier to bring a green mori and that's it?
---
I was mainly on the garage maps but it was super super bad in the Backwater swamps
---
I don't deny that it is good because it really is. I just think it would be more useful if you were injured. However people don't understand an opinion
---
what did we get instead i dont know
---
Iron will all the way. Incredible perk.
---
Nothing we only got the killer .-.
---
It‚Äôs just a customization thing for Reddit
---
What exactly are they, can someone explain? Just stories?
---
NO MITHER FOR THE WIN!!!
---
IMO it‚Äôs because everyone is all separated. Like Mike and Will are only with the group for 2(?) episodes, and then El is on her own basically the entire season. Plus there‚Äôs that episode in Chicago that takes it even farther away from the story ‚Äúwe‚Äù care about
---
Here comes the trapper
---
Yea pretty much. Its more to slow gen rushing and stuff tbh.
---
I mean, what‚Äôs not to love? He has jojo references for crying out loud
---
I don't mind facing swf, I find myself learning stuff when facing them. It's the taking the piss part they all seem to do. Youre better player congratulations but just pure toxicity.
---
The best teachers are the nicest teachers, God i apreciate that man.  
---
Also fuck the pedo he can go to heck
---
It‚Äôs always going to be easier to get bps as killer honestly, part of the balancing of having to play alone and earn everything alone. On my end I always try the same no matter what because otherwise I don‚Äôt get many points, if I let up and survivors don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm shot out of luck
---
This ain't a killer thing. I play survivor and if me and my buddies throw up 4 party streams I want the same thing to play the fucking game.   Fuck farming or anything else I just want to play the game. if Im killer I'd do the same thing. Im not here for bloodpoints ill get them eventually.
---
even then, good survivors will generally manage to save their teammate even if you're camping, by tanking hits for the injured one
---
Oh cool!
---
Absolutely awesome
---
Do you know what a console is?
---
Big brain time
---
That'd be like paying for a fatality in mortal kombat.
---
Boy I got dbd on xbox
---
Your lobby times will be worse if they do this as well you know?
---
I hope due to the stranger things dlc bringing in new survivors and killers that otz will be able to make them good at the game while also teaching them how to be respectful
---
Me to
---
So I keep seeing this dude on the right but I don‚Äôt know him, what‚Äôs his channel called so I can look him up?
---
Killer: "Wow! Great job guys!"
---
Survivors: "Excuse me?! What the fuck did you say?! *Wooow*, reported!"
---
Like I said farming was the wrong term I just dont wanna try hard game if we do that. I dont enjoy being tunneled which seems to happen everytime we run a bps.
---
From my experience the best thing you can do is just play respectfully. Be a non toxic survivor or killer and when people are toxic towards you you can quietly observe their desperate need for validation
---
Here comes the fortnite community. Making dbd "content".
---
WHEN YOU SPEND THE WHOLE FUCKING GAME RESCUING TWO SURVIVORS WHO KEEP GETTING HOOKED AND THEY'RE THE ONES TO ESCAPE IN THE END WHILE I DIE ON FIRST HOOK
---
The perk is coded to activate on fully healing a Survivor. Autodidact doesn't change that so unless they made Second Wind trigger on accumulative heals, than there is literally no way it wouldn't work.
---
There are mentions of a Halloween event, as well as skin placeholder files for Spirit, Hag, Plague and Clown.
---
There's been leaks pointing towards a Halloween event but we don't know and the leaks in question are Clown,Spirit,Plague, Legion and a survivor and killer skins
---
Correct. If we grade of off fun, Killer is a whole lot less fun at red ranks.
---
By that logic Billy has no counterplay either during the chase. He can do everything Demo can do. Bait survivors for loops and instantly break pallets. You might say something like, ‚ÄúWell Billy has a charge time,‚Äù which is true but Demo has something to counterbalance. Billy recovers from the pallet destroy way way faster than Demo does. Demo recovers at the same speed as if he hit a wall. Billy also insta-downs a survivor for making a mistake at a loop when Demo just does 1 point of damage.
---
Demo isn‚Äôt on the level of spirit, not even close. And this is coming from someone who‚Äôs been using the red moss add-on exclusively at high ranks. Run him around with the same mindset of billy and you‚Äôll realize he definitely has counterplay.
---
Played one game against a Demo who had Devour Hope and Monitor. It was actually a genuinely terrifying experience.
---
Then we went back to Oops All Spirit.
---
REALLY I'M RESERVING COMPLETE JUDGEMENT BECAUSE DEMO IS NEW AND WE ALL KNOW HOW PEOPLE LOVE TO SWING THE NERF HAMMER AND BUFF BATON AT THINGS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE UNFAMILIAR AND THEY HAVEN'T PRECISELY FIGURED OUT THEIR PURPOSE OR HOW TO UTILIZE THEM YET BUT I DO THINK SHRED NEEDS A LITTLE BIT OF TOUCHUP, YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOCKED ONTO THE VECTOR 100% THE SECOND YOU SHRED, IT JUST MAKES IT TOO EASY TO JUKE, MAYBE GIVE LIKE 25% TURN CONTROL OR SOMETHING, I DUNNO.
---
PORTALS ARE NEAT BUT I FEEL LIKE THEY AREN'T REALLY AS EFFECTIVE AS CATALYSTS OR NURSE, I AGREE. DEMO IS GOOD BUT NOT OVERPOWERED WHICH IS DEFINITELY WHAT I THINK THEY'VE BEEN AIMING FOR BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT ANOTHER NURSE SITUATION WHERE THEY BECOME THE DEFINITIVE HIGH RANK KILLER, BUT THEY COULD TOUCH UP PORTALS JUST A LITTLE BIT TO MAKE THEM A LITTLE MORE EFFECTIVE
---
Fuck yea ps4 nurse ytiodkenf
---
Oh sorry. Still new to Reddit
---
It‚Äôs still Steve‚Äôs best perk on its own. Babysitter is better when you have BT and camaraderie requires you too be on second hook and only helps when you try to kobe before going into struggle
---
His channel is not otzdarva. He posts more on his second channel then first so yeah. But he uploads videos of gameplay of dead by daylight while also explaining why he is doing certain things. I highly recommend him
---
I dont get it. What's thr difference
---
There are some small changes but the main reason I gave Evil Within Tiers names is because Evil Within is the only power to work by tiers, while other powers have names for their different abilities.
---
Sorta, it‚Äôs basically a delayed teleport from what I understand. I‚Äôve played 3 games and one game they kept cleansing them on the far end of the map. Just try your best to hide them but don‚Äôt go out of your way to defend them.
---
AND REPAIRED IT WITH ONLY
---
Resilience, Engineer's Toolbox + Socket Swivels, Leader, Prove Thyself, and three other survivors with the exact same build
---
That was a 5 gens loop
---
Because we like to kill baby Dwight's too. And sometimes we like to troll shit new killers.
---
Killer crashes too?
---
Well I mean the game is free currently so that's probably why as matchmaking has been off so it's just pairing you guys with killers they can find regardless of rank
---
How do you use a fliar?
---
I always forget nd it rots when survivors are geared with weapons they don‚Äôt use on killers.
---
I see her enough to run urban evasion, only to get doctor and Huntress with Whispers.
---
I know. He was super pissed. So odd. Got to love toxic survivors.
---
And look where we are now
---
Because people want to feel special for bullying new players. Deranking scums lol.
---
Maybe the amount of newer players is far too big at the moment to actually find people who recognize certain mechanics (no offense to anyone, not meant to come off as rude but rather attempting to help and inform)?
---
For example, had some trapper matches recently against people who failed gens so often across the map that it kept happening until I caught a guy I was chasing, and continued once I hooked him.
---
Vince McMahon is the Entity?!?!
---
Should I do it?
---
Halloween is one of the best chapters at least for me.
---
The DLC made me finally go back and watch season 2, which was fantastic. Im looking to watching 3 now.
---
I've never understood try hard as an insult. If youre a playing a game yyou should be trying your hardest to win at all times.
---
Yes. As Survivor i‚Äôve had it cause a blue screen crash twice and the other few times it‚Äôs sent me to the menu with ‚ÄúDisconnected from Host‚Äù message.
---
Yeah maybe. Especially after the matchmaking went to shit after the new update
---
What happened? Did they box you in?
---
Wraith isn‚Äôt bad with distressing (the perk you mention) either.
---
Dont use Dying Light, its crashing the game
---
Hadn't even thought of billy's charge time, what im concerned about is the recovery from faking his power. Doesn't billy get slightly slowed down if he fakes using it? I might just be wrong. Im not saying the Demo is on par with the Spirit, what im saying is that I thought they shared the same concept of "mind gaming" where its actually just a guessing game for the survivor.
---
Maybe if they made it so its a temporary kindred that lasts as long as the killer's BBQ effect, so you can kinda just tell if someone's close at the time of hooking, but not after. Permanent kindred would be really strong.
---
I think precisely because it's the only power to work off of tiers is the reason they shouldn't be renamed. The different tiers are less of a separate power from each other and more of a straight buff to buff of the same thing.
---
I know how the perk is meant to work. However plenty of times perks haven‚Äôt interacted the way they were supposed to, and this could be no exception. It needs to be play tested.
---
IT TOOK ME THREE ESCAPES UNTIL THE ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED.  THAT'S OK BECAUSE I HAD FUN DOING IT GODDDAAAAAMMMMMMMMIIIIIIIITTTTT.
---
He's pretty mediorce, the lunge is great at window tiles, and areas without any pallets besides that it's kinda weak, for the portals they get destroyed quickly if the team is actually decent, they offer great mobility but it gives any near by survivors a head start, I feel once people get used to the demogorgon he'll just be a regular ol Mid tier killer
---
As a survivor main i personally hate playing against him. His shred goes for fucking miles and he has next to no punishment for missing his attacks and its almost impossible to dodge his attacks. It doesn't help that you play against him almost every game atm.
---
When playing against Plague you‚Äôre not really playing against Plague. You‚Äôre either playing against a Huntress with a machine gun or a T3 Myers.
---
I think he is the cutest killer. When he does the little lip flappies I can't help but coo.
---
excuse you, us pc players were the original long queuers
---
back in my days, we had to wait like an hour or so
---
Yeet
---
***please yes pm me when it‚Äôs done I need this ok***
---
Get good scrub
---
truth you on ps4 or pc
---
25k stop complaining
---
Sorry to point it out, but it looks like the closing ** has been missed off (7), which means neither it nor (8) are properly bolded.
---
Been getting baby survivors and killers. when im killer i try and be nice and escort the last survivor to the hatch but he keeps running away in fear.
---
you on ps4 or xbox
---
its a pretty huge waste of time plus it makes the game really boring for both sides it takes two minutes for one survivor to die
---
I play kyf so I can learn how stuff works and practice before jumping into games. It‚Äôs no fun getting tunneled so I changed what I was doing. There‚Äôs no way you are getting tunneled in 100% of games you play or even close to that unless you‚Äôre taunting or being dumb.
---
I use Make Your Choice and Haunted Grounds. Makes it really easy to down people/trigger Make Your Choice with so many easy early swipes.
---
I feel like as long as you play her right, she‚Äôs really fucking good. She‚Äôs the only Killer I can reliably 4K with, because I understand her Traps and where Survivors like to go.
---
But because it's so fast it hits 90% of the time unless you are looping the killer
---
i need to find someone to try a kyf with
---
You never know, sometimes the matchmaking shits itself. I‚Äôm a rank 12 survivor and had a match against a Rank 20 killer last night.
---
The new nurse skin

Thank you for the update. I honestly think that you should do an upload from your perspective as well. That game was awesome
---
Anyone doing that is a terrible Hag, lmao.
---
I let all my Traps do the walking for me. Dried Cicada and Eggshell can dominate most small/medium maps. And once my Haunted Grounds pops, you‚Äôll see the fear in how they crouchwalk and cautiously enter rooms. I love it.
---
And do not watch tru3 ffs
---
Trial by fire üòà, for 3/4. #4 gets to learn looping and hatch use, but Noooo doors. No no no.
---
SWEATY KILLERS, DID SOME SWF STICK FLASHLIGHTS WHERE THE SUN DONT SHINE AND YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT OUT ON SOLO PLAYERS? IT'S NOT ENOUGH THERE WAS A DC IN THE BEGINNING, DOCTOR IN THE NEW MAP THAT CAN SHOCK PPL THROUGH ALL FLOORS STILL HAD TO TUNNEL EVERY HOOKED BASTARD.
---
OR WALLHACK SWEATYS WHO STILL HAD TO SLUG EVERYONE
---
OR INSTA DOWN CAMPERS THAT JUST STAND IN FRONT OF EVERY SURVIVOR THEY CATCH UNTIL THEY DIE.
---
I'M A SOLO PLAYER, I DON'T MIND DYING EXCEPT THE LEVEL OF SWEATYNESS IS UNWARRANTED SINCE YOU ARE GOING TO WIN ANYWAY.
---
i totally agree espescially with ruin up and i hit a good skillcheck and get off it and it ends up regressing even more
---
It's a mid tier killer, his lunge works against shack and jungle jims and occasionally on loops. That's all he has, portals are too easy to remove so his mobility sucks
---
Lol is It really that hard? I got It without wanting to, ill admit It was in The Game map and they didnt find ruin early
---
I had it proc in a nice spot too.
---
Killer chased two other survivors out while my friend got me off the hook, they got out taking a hit from him since he was camping the gate, second wind kicked in for me off the hook and let me just run right past him taking a hit
---
I quote my sister (who actually watched Stranger Things) "He looks gay as fuck."
---
Errmmm not American. It's on sale everywhere
---
Feel free to ask, they had a ton of lovely artwork in their twitter :D
---
Everyone knows the matchmaking is bad. We don‚Äôt need a post about it every 2 minutes
---
0 points objective, holy shit what did you do, hide all game?
---
Andy Sandberg?
---
I don't get it either.  I just started playing her and she is tons of fun.  Her traps are really great if you know where to place them.
---
I actually would love it as a magnet aswell, if you have a twitter why not give the suggestion xD I don't use it :(
---
Source?
---
There's no way Insta down huntress is at the bottom :P the Pig has way lamer add ons imo
---
Well see why would any survivor drop the pallet early just because the demogorgon gains the slightest amount of distance? He still gets stunned and they can just go on a side of the pallet to avoid a hit for maps like haddonfield most loops are unsafe or really sad still with the lunge as most loops have just a pixel blocking it, asylum only has one loop that's really effected by the lunge,The game just has unsafe pallets in general no point in using the lunge there and the map had alot of curves meaning even if it's good against pallets you're lunge is pretty bad, for swamp loops you can't really mindgame them with shred as they are just odd and curve slightly, over all we should wait until it gets added until we can agree fully or disagree
---
Yeah im not having that problem i have like from1 to 3 min queue
---
I healed someone and it didn't activate. Buggy maybe?
---
I cant wait either man I want to  have challenges and lore and rewards
---
i would personally prefer pennywise coming to the game instead of this.......................
---
Tru3 isn't bad don't listen to this guy
---
Yeah, that could work. I only basically have Meg levelled to 40 and I have no other teachables, so I cannot try any of the more interesting builds yet.
---
Never, it's dumb and I'll continue to call it dumb, because paying for a skin that costs as much as two new playable characters is ridiculous.
---
DID THE DEV TEAM FROM FRIDAY THE 13TH: THE GAME WORK ON THIS UPDATE????? JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! WE TRIED KYF LAST NIGHT FOR OVER 2 HOURS AND KEPT GETTING A "CONNECTING TO OTHER PLAYERS SCREEN," WHICH WAS INFINITE, AND JUST KEPT REPEATING! FRIENDS LIST IS BROKE AS FUCK....NONE OF MY FRIENDS WOULD SHOW UP, DESPITE BEING ONLINE (AND VICE VERSA!) IN SWF, IT WAS BRINGING 2/3 OF US IN A LOBBY, AND PUTTING THE 3RD PERSON IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LOBBY!!!!!! THIS IS CRAP! FIX IT!!!!!
---
I was also confused by the question
---
He looks like him you're right but it's actually David Fajgenbaum who is in this meme.
---
You can look up the news article 'medicine student heals himself'.
---
They definitely need to buff it with an effect similar to sprint burst.
---
I almost feel like she should be a ‚ÄúMeta‚Äù-Tier Killer. Honestly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever lost all 4 Survivors to her. She‚Äôs the only Killer I can ever reliably kill with, mainly because I also play a lot of Survivor, so I know where Loops are/popular areas to go.
---
I remember Hag used to be garbage before she got buffed, maybe people still think that about her?
---
Thanks to all who commented and upvoted seeing the community liking this meme has made my day! THANKS Y‚Äôall Appreciate it!
---
Welp time to handicap myself and play wraith with full terror radias
---
Looks like the thing that in the corner of my room doin sleep paralysis
---
Ah, then I'm guessing it's a PC thing. Nothing is on sale on PS4 for me.
---
BUT RACIST PUFFS ARE PART OF A BALANCED BREAKFAST MAN
---
They were the same rank as all of us. And again they were P3.
---
You are in for a treat. S3 was IMO amazing, they really stepped up in just about everything. Great story arc for many characters, amazing chemistry between the groups, top tier cinematography (so many times you can just pause and screenshot for a wallpaper lol) and they managed to capture the 80s atmosphere so well.
---
I don't find that fun to use. Amanda's Secret and Amanda's Letter are why I consider her better.
---
You're friend probably just sucks
---
Not atm, should I download it?
---
SWF, the 20 would have dragged them into your game.
---
Ah I see I play deathgarden but not dbd on pc
---
Yea definitely you can preemptively shred to gain distance if they drop early and for m1ing before they reach a pallet that could situational. Anyways as stated we better wait until we get our full opinions on it
---
I love Hag and intend for her to be one of my mains, I'm just not running her right now because I'm trying to get other killers leveled up for perks so I don't want to spend points on her web at the moment.
---
Now that's playing dirty in a good way
---
I‚Äôve made it to rank 6 killer and I use default sensitivity.
---
thank you üíñ Ghost Face is the best ü§©
---
Considering he‚Äôs at max boldness, probably got chased the entire game
---
Tnx dud but how i dowland this icon
---
So what happend here: Mate got hit with legion ability and keeped his hurt sprint boost. That is the result
---
All he does is close loops down faster, that‚Äôs it. And even then medium vaulting loops can still work with the weird i-frames still in the game. No map pressure and no tracking. Decent against meh survivors but he gets demolished against semi-coordinated survivors.
---
Wow, really hope they add in options for colour blindness soon then, I can see how the current build can be frusterating

I also main survivor so I quickly learned where to effectively place traps. I still struggle on big maps like asylum though. Do you 4k with her without ruin? I get rushed pretty hard without it but I hate using it. 
---
I dont think she was ever bad tbh their used to be some really strong hag mains back in the days bc shes always had a loop counter but most killer mains just go for the super camp strat. They almost always had noed too. Man I forgot how annoying hags used to be lol.
---
I think it would give extra charges. Since the healing bar actually regresses then you have to re-heal again. So possibly yes extra charges but if you are healing solo then it doesn't really matter. I'm not sure if double healing would give enough charges even with the regression though. 
---
Next time you are playing the combo keep an high on the Second Wind perk and see when it lights up during the heal. If it lights up before you fully complete the heal then you know for sure it counts as extra charges  : -)
---
These are confusing times. Why the downvotes for disagreeing?
---
Well you pretty much explained why it was easy for you. The most killer sided map and they had a permanent gen slowdown. Most people when they try to do this always seem to get one of the larger maps (Temple, mothers dwelling) and get ruin cleansed off spawn. Congrats though!
---
they are both garbage perks
---
Dang, didn‚Äôt know it was a PC exclusive :/
---
Obviously for gamers it is not a horror, but you would be surprised by how many casual gamers (or non-gamers) are scared from this game. My gf is a light gamer and she is scared AF from games like DBD.
---
Wow.  I made a post about this once. It got SO much hate.
---
cool! thx you,
---
It wont change anything, it breaks pallets so slow lol
---
Ah yes. Whispers is just pretty much active all over the map lol
---
I felt the separation more in Season 3,which I hated.
---
The melting blood monsters ruined it for me,and the Soviets made it way too cheesy.
---
I get kicked from 4 games last night. No thanks
---
This happens a lot. I'm not sure if it's the matchmaking system that doesn't work correctly or it's because they're in a party but let's hope they fix it with the new ranking system coming next year.
---
I'm thinking about those beans
---
Yesterday, I was doing a gen and a skill check came up.  I did it, and it showed "good skill check" on my screen but the gen blew anyway.  
---
That was some bullshit.
---
I like it, though it almost sounds like the opening to Papers Please.
---
I'd never be able to get away, it hypnotizes you.
---
Survivors arent broken. Killers have the most broken things in the game by far. If I wanna win I play killer.
---
Might as well just put Golden Feng down. Shit costs $800
---
No one used cheese tactics though .-.
---
Change it from exhaustion to oblivious. It's the only status effect that would be useful.
---
Damn first line literally a spoiler
---
Yeah that's how I've been running it but still feels a bit underwhelming.
---
Looked everywhere for this guy, didn‚Äôt find him only guy named NotOtzdarva
---
Camping is fun. Do it boys
---
Yea see, *my* stereotypical bad guys are Nazis, so I didn‚Äôt really notice the Cold War cheese that everyone else seemed to
---
Has tuft of hair and tombstone
---
So what's being rewritten here?
---
Ain‚Äôt that neat?
---
I think you get objective points if you get chased and gens pop
---
Ooooh I see, nice
---
Entity:  ok, so after you slug them, you hook them
---
Demogorgon: Eats them
---
Entity: NO, BAD *sprays*  BAD DEMOGORGON!
---
I think pretty much every outfit they had in the show will make it in. I even expect them to add outfits to fit with Season 4's release(whenever that comes out that is).
---
Literally the entire description.
---
IM RATHER NEW TO THE GAME AND EVERY MATCH I PLAY AS KILLER EITHER DOESNT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF A DISCONNECT THAT LEAVES ME HANGING ON A LOADING SCREEN FOR LIKE 10 MINUTES OR IT ENTERS ME IN A GAME WITH IMMOBILE PEOPLE WHO JUST SPAM THEIR LOCATION I JUST WANNA PLAY KILLER MAN IDK WHAT TO DO :((((((((((
---
I really love it! I hope you display it, it looks like an awesome print.
---
It's like turning safe search off. If you click the wrong stuff because you have no idea what you're doing and should be using safe search after all, you can hurt yourself. You CANNOT get a virus simply by disabling Apple's parental controls, don't worry.
---
Goddamn it I was going to make this meme
---
Thank you. Glad someone can see the tuth.
---
nice
---
Oh ok well then ima get it for this
---
That looks almost exactly like the Zuni-warrior-doll killer from Amelia in the Trilogy of Terror. The scariest doll I‚Äôd ever seen as a kid.
---
You deserved it for bringing noed. Im killer main btw noed is just a trash overrated perk
---
What is this for? I am qualified but I want to know for what.
---
Death garden hasn‚Äôt come out on consoles yet
---
Yeah i was shocked like when Boob3 just bought it along the way it costs fucking 800 dollars and he just casually buys it along the way without even playing feng like weird flex but ok
---
Were do I go to get it?
---
They changed it for the release so that it starts ticking down the timer right after the unhook. Camraderie is also buffed to be 30 seconds I think at max level.
---
I think Inner Strength still might be better because you can choose if you want the heal or not but at least Second Wind isnt garbage now
---
Only worth it if you really want the bloody clothing and/or the achievement.
---
What changed?
---
No, you get light bringer emblem points but not objective blood points
---
There is a better chance for higher rarity but it's not very noticeable. I prestige just because I play so much I might as well dump my points towards progression. Its nice to say "yeah I've got them P3 50" lol
---
That seems so obvious, yet bhvr gives exhaustion.
---
As a pretty oppressive spirit main I rarely get toxic end game chat especially to that degree so I really have to wonder how yall are playing killer lol. 
---
Not that theres any excuse to their behavior...
---
The demogoron is op and annoying
---
Web application
---
This isn't necessarily true.  Running two exhaustion perks that don't conflict each other isn't uncommon.  I've ran Head On alongside, Dead Hard, Balanced, Lithe etc...
---
Being a content creator, it might have been gifted to him. I bought a dweard for my 1k hours mark since I main Dwight, and I don‚Äôt regret it at all.
---
Oh.
---
Nea looks like a female dwight
---
Doubt considering I've been at Rank 1 since Legion released.
---
A 10 paragraph rant? Yeah, you're just salty.
---
I like it, more perks need to have updated description.
---
Cursed
---
The new stranger things DLC is bringing fans of the show to the game. Ive being going with a lot of rank 20s as survivor and most of them are playing ST people
---
He‚Äôs to run to play against but I don‚Äôt like playing as the demogorgon
---
I think the longer you are waiting for a killer lobby the wider the allowance of ranks becomes. So to avoid having queue times up to hours long they just give you whoever is available despite ranks.
---
Why would you need ruin for Chest Protector memes?  It's not like you're actually going to win those games anyways they're just for meme lols for both sides.
---
People just get mad if you start talking balance on a meme post.
---
Like I get it. It's a shit post. Can we not use it to start a meaningful conversation? Or the entire post and all replies have to be complete shit?
---
Hah, friends.
---
What runs through people‚Äôs minds when they do this
---
When survivors message me insults on PSN after a game, I just record 15 seconds of a crying baby (from YouTube, people) and send it back to them. Haven‚Äôt got a single response from that.
---
Thanks a lot bro! I didn't know about that. Played some matches here and now it's fine! Thank you too!
---
Increased the range at which Sacrifical Hook auras are hidden from the Killer.
---
What‚Äôs the revenge?
---

---
new players might not know throwing down a pallet does a loud notfication for the killer I know I didn't
---
I think it should also silence the people running away. Or at least make their steps and grunts of pain quieter.
---
That was awesome...rare moments like this we need to cherish it
---
Noo I knew they screwed up a lot of the survivors hair but i never went to check on my spirit!!!
---
Thanks, then id just recommend going there to try
---
I just don't find her playstyle particularly fun
---
Any lower and it isn't deterrent enough for babykillers not to tunnel you.  The timer is fine switch targets and that survivor is a 3 perk player.
---
how is selfcare useless?
---
So I manage to down them all at the same time and yet I get toxic messages saying ‚ÄúI suck‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre trash!‚Äù etc etc 
---
Usually get a DC or two followed by a salty message üòÇ
---
sorry
---
**I AGREE GOOD CHUM**
---
It's a very common thing on console face camping or hardcore puppy guarding it gets really annoying and makes it feel like playing survivor not worth it from time to time like yeah you don't want the survivors be unhook there team but do light puppy guarding man leave the hooked player come back like 15 or 30 seconds later or when you have that gamer sense of there probably about to get unhooked time to go back I had a game where my friends and a random went against a leather fact all he did was hookamd just stay right in his face it's so boring and as a personal killer main trying to learn survivor I would hook someone do one full rotation around the hooked survivor if no one is there then I go gennie and survivor hunting if they get unhooked then I go back and try to find them
---
I also have slow internet. I wish people like KingFerocious would understand that it's not as simple as "get a better provider" or "do something about it" when we usually only have one option out here, if anything. Let's both look forward to dedicated servers: Our internet is too slow to host as Killer, but with Servers we'll finally be able to play the other half of the game!!
---
&gt;While you're spending two whole minutes standing there watching someone die, you know what everybody else is doing? Repairing generator
---
I wish this was the case. Seems like lately I hook someone and his friends are immediately there trying to unhook him. Then I get called a camper because they wouldn't let me leave the hook. It's like some survivors just expect you to ignore them running right up to the hook in full view of you.
---
Hell, even when I make it halfway across the map I get accused of camping if I put a single trap down near them as trapper and someone steps in it, or I make it back to the basement just as they are coming out the door and down them again because I saw the unhook notification and they were slow to leave.
---
Ok it's not a specs issue, the other problem it could be is his antivirus have him create an exception to the file path containing the EXE and this could fix it.
---
Some overzelous antiviruses block random steam games.
---
Your wisdom.
---
No but seriously it‚Äôs for a new web application that I‚Äôm working on. I figured - who could be the best source other than the players of DBD!
---
Chernobyl was a national tragedy that led to the deaths of countless men, many of which died knowing that they would die. I really don‚Äôt think it would be very appropriate to create a chapter based on a national tragedy.
---
This post probably will get removed for over-saturated content
---
Ok, what do I need to do?
---
They made Quentin's hair even uglier too. Poor guy cant catch a break.
---
Actually would be a decent buff, though it would be extremely annoying on inside maps, especially the new one or Lerys.
---
I‚Äôll contact you :)
---
GIDEON MEATPLANT SHOULD NOT BE A MAP OR FIX THE FUCKING TERROR RADIUS FROM WHERE I CAN HEAR IT FROM UPSTAIRS LIKE I CAN THE KILLERS  HEARTBEAT FROM DOWNSTAIRS WHEN IM UPSTAIRS AND IT FUCKS ME UP
---
If the Killwr tunnels one Survivor, they are garenteed to loose. The current Mori incentives tunneling to an extreme level.
---
I'll be honest, I logged in yesterday to play against demo and mess around with the new perks, ended up instead facing omega blink Nurses and instasaw Billies with ebony moris, 1500+ hours playtime and somehow all at rank 15+. And a couple other times I got paired with 3-man SWFs with instaheals and commodious toolboxes against rank 20 one-perk Wraith or Trapper.
---
That's just really, really pathetic. You can't stop people from being sweaty tryhards even when they're playing against noobs so at least fucking fix the ranking and matchmaking system.
---
I always thought it looked like David dribbling a basketball
---
Why do they even put their time into making basically the same cosmetic!? (If they put any time...)
---
why the doctor hate?
---
Its 2700 because it's the first time being on the shrine
---
honestly same argument could be made for my boi bubba
---
Get Rancor, (It's literally on the shrine right now.) change your steam name to "One Punch Man" follow the obsession around for 5 gens, instadown and Mori before they can react.
---
If you want to waste your own time doing something that isn't even fun, then I guess be my guest.

People always DC from Moris because they think it's bullshit (And tbh the pink one is bullshit.)

---
&gt;This post was made meaning that Dedicated Servers is going to be possibly even worse than this, hitbox wise anyway.
---
That hit has nothing to do with hitboxes... You or the killer had a lag spike, your character desynced and stayed up there, which allowed him to hit you. 
---
This is the only thing dedicated servers will fix, lag spikes caused by the killer.
---
Just google "jailbreak ios" or something similar, there are hundreds of tutorials out there. :)
---
They were probably playing Demogorgon and quitting because he's F tier.
---
They should do what overwatch does when someone dc‚Äôs, give em a 10 minute time out
---
I use **Ruin/Haunted Grounds or Make Your Choice/Monitor and Abuse/Surveillance** when I play her. 
---
Usually I pick a section of the Map with Gens that aren‚Äôt too spaced apart. Any Gens in the corner/far away I just mark as a loss. Defending an area until Haunted pops off is usually what starts the steamroller, if you pair both Haunted and Make Your Choice, you can make for some easy hooks in the first couple minutes, especially if you‚Äôre near the basement
---
It was pallet peggy after all.
---
I don't mind. Hag and Plague are the most unfun killers to face in my opinion. They're so dependant on how your team plays.
---
I personally feel the demogorgon has the perfect amount of counterablity, he isn't too easy to counter but not too difficult either
---
Head On would be a great perk if you didn't have to be in the locker so long for it to be usable. Otherwise you need a lot of coordination to make it more useful than other exhaustion perks.
---
Listen here, this isn't fair and you know it
---
You will never get to Rank 1 if you camp. Gens go too fast for Killers to be able to do that.
---
Tbh I feel like Rank reset brings out killers who are bad but bring things like noed and camp/tunnel so it‚Äôs not that fun regardless
---
I paid 10$ to get the full Scoops outfit and not wear the hat.
---
You could something that actually helps your team in the year you spend self caring.
---
Every fucking time I bring streamers
---
üÖ±Ô∏èead dy üÖ±Ô∏èaylight
---
I more mean you'd have to settle with being exhausted for a bit after using one preventing you from using the other, not that you can't run both on one build.
---
Wha-
---
To each their own. Fundamentally I think the Spirit/Clown/Doctor have the most ‚Äúfun‚Äù playstyle, but I‚Äôve grown a soft spot for Hag.
---
Lol I never chase the person doing that. I feel like it‚Äôs a gamble if they‚Äôre cocky as shit or are gonna waste my time looping for 2 gens so I don‚Äôt bother risking it.
---
Actually you can by chasing and camping every now and again. You're not a good killer if you resort to camping and tunneling it means you're not skilled enough to get points without doing that.
---
I mean if I could earn lootboxes just by playing that‚Äôd be great. Because then I could just continue to no life this game and I would eventually have every cosmetic without ever having to buy auric sells
---
That sounds like someone has gamer rage
---
Are you tryna play?
---
Any idea when you could make matching icons for Qatar? (stranger things?)
---
I believe you can tell but iirc you need to be on top of another portal
---
&gt;this all boils down to the dev team needing to make disconnects more punishable
---
Punishing disconnects even more (there is a punishment already) in a casual game would be a mistake. 
---
The problem is, OP had disconnects on his games but that doesn't mean those players do that **every game**, do you want them to get punished for DCing once in a while? 
---
From our killer perspective it might look people DC every match but perhaps they had been playing "normally" throughout multiple matches and just DCed against us.
---
Corrupt Purge.
---
How is this better? at most you will only get 6 uses.
---
Yeah also chaging the mori, instaheal and all sort of pink stuff..they really make the game not fun
---
&gt;They should do what overwatch does when someone dc‚Äôs, give em a 10 minute time out
---
10 minute timeout in a casual game?
---
r/bottomtext
---
he didn't do any objectives hence why it's at 0
---
WIGGLING FEELS LIKE THE MOST USELESS MECHANIC IN THIS GAME. EVERY KILLER KNOWS HOW TO AVOID GETTING THROWN TOO OFF TRACK AND HOOKS ARE SO DAMN CLOSE TO EVERY SPOT ON THE MAP YOU ALMOST NEVER GET CLOSE TO GETTING OFF.
---
ALSO, Y'ALL CRAZY, BABYSITTER MEME BUILDS FOR LIFE. BABYSITTER, DELIVERENCE, DECISIVE STRIKE; COME AT ME BRO.
---
Like i get that its fun for survivors (who some are also total stranger things fans) playing against the demogorgon with him beeing actually scary and counterable, but damn my portals just get destroyed the second i leave, and sometimes the pounce doesnt connect even tho its right at their bootyhole. im usally at red ranks but im struggeling to get a 2k at rank 7 with the best add ons. Maybe i just dont have him all figured out yet but he isnt too fun aswell because new killer are pretty much just the power of 2 killers combined like we already got teleportation on 6 other killers and the pounce is from the pig. i know its kinda different but think about when the last time was that the killer didnt run on a timer or was just pretty much 2 killers combined. i know its hard to come up with something with the tight schedule they have but damn i suffered some bullying today, and when i want to play survivor i get teammates that either do nothing or basically kill themselves against a noed nurse.
---
They definitely need to increase the aura distance. I would also like it for Tier 3 to give you a 5% increased wiggling speed.
---
What the hell is a "*Clown main*" I didnt knew they exist
---
100K BP match?
---
Jesus
---
i mean... plague exist and killed almost half of the world
---
They only do that in competitive , not quick play
---
i can only hope
---
God. That terrifying **B O N G** sound as your 4 Broken and Sick Survivors turns into just 3.
---
Plague isn‚Äôt fun just because the ‚ÄòCleanse‚Äô mechanic has no purpose. There is literally zero incentive to cleanse yourself and give the Killer a free Machine Gun for 60 seconds.
---
I really hate loot boxes but i think the best way to do it would be to increase the amount of shards you get when leveling up and make every skin purchasable with shards. Even if the orange skins are extremely pricy at least id be able to get them at some point. Unlike atm where i will never get Scoops Ahoy
---
It wouldn't make self care better because it's not a common perk. Killers might start using it if Inner Strength becomes meta but it's not really possible because there are only 5 totems.
---
I know this is kinda within the "failed" action but, it should mention that you are unable to progress the generator for X seconds after hitting "good skill check".
---
Which is funny because when I see him standing there when you‚Äôre doing his loadout or whatever he just seems so cute lol
---
Then ingame he‚Äôs SCREAMING
---
11 I got no games against it :(
---
He was trained aka brainwashed to do that.

For me both Ace and Bill are one tier higher

I think some skins are well worth the price if you like the character enough but some are a bit meh.

Free week I think

My favorite streamer is FunGoose - most informative player I know and he's really good at the game.
---
There was someone telling him to die. He must have deleted the message
---
&gt;They only do that in competitive , not quick play
---
I was talking about DBD. I understand the time ban for competitive modes but DBD is basically a casual game with ranks as an attempt to  have a matchmaking to exclude brand new players from the rest of the pool.
---
I agree. You can try to get the pallet stun and run away. The other options are stay at the loop and get hit, or leave the loop and get hit. The killer never has to break pallets on that map. How hard is it to actually balance a map in this game so it's not completely dogshit for one side?
---
And yet Void doggo doesnt even get to taste without offering a Mori..
---
Talk about taking advantage..
---
This game can still scare me sometimes (I‚Äôm looking at you Meyers).  Even after over 200 hours.
---
It would show the message, but the username and text itself would just say "Deleted"
---
Lol absolutely horrid advice man.  We are offering advice to these new killers because they won't figure it out for themselves.  They won't know any better and all killers camp initially starting the game.  Camping is never a valid full game strategy because it will lose you nearly every game once they're out of potato ranks.  Get high enough and you depip even with a 4k camping.  Instead of telling them to use babystrats since their rank 20 and it'll work there why wouldn't we offer advice that will develop them as players and allow them to rank up higher while also rapidly speeding up their character development with perk selection by increasing their BP gain.  You're not helping anyone here with this advice you're basically telling them how to set themselves back.

Unlike me many people in this community have accepted their prices for cosmetics. Most outfits cost 10 US dollars, and they look worse in-game than in renders. Hell when they released the Pig cosmetic they increased the Auric Cell price ever so slightly that you were forced to buy $15 worth of Auric cells. Yet there was barely any criticism from the players. And people keep throwing the money at BHVR so they're gonna keep doing it.
---
Ok, so the prices are different on PC which is understandable. However, the DLC for Ash &amp; Ghostface is still $5. I‚Äôd argue for a licensed character that provides a decent metric for how much each character is valued.
---
PATROL YOUR GENS USING PORTALS, DONT PUT THEM IN SIGHT OR IN OBVIOUS PLACES. BEHIND WALLS CLOSE TO THE GEN OR IN GRASS IS A GOOD SPOT. I'VE BEEN HAVING LOTS AND LOTS OF SUCCESS WITH SURVEILLANCE, SURGE AND SLOPPY BUTCHER IF THAT HELPS. I'D USE TREMORS OR BBQ IF I HAD THEM BUT THEY HAVEN'T POPPED IN MY BLOODWEB YET, SADLY.
---
Oh, so if you rush gens as Survivor you aren't skilled enough to get points without doing that? Tunneling is efficiency, just like rushing through gens as Survivor is efficiency. However, is it fun? No. It is not.
---
What‚Äôs your psn?
---
There was something there. No clue why it disappeared
---
Of course they had to have 2 weeks of bad perks after having bbq then ruin in consecutive weeks.
---
I did the same but with legion so I could get BP for my new boi
---
Ah if it isn‚Äôt a fellow bloody meg
---
Pretty Balanced
---
It's a lot of fun to play too
---
Oh haha
---
Camp with gens up - you the dick.  Camp with open exit gate and they complain postgame -they the dick.  Their only argument against what you did is entitlement.  There isn't a single logical counterargument they could provide you for why you shouldn't do what you did.
---
Cool
---
I thought it was just for Steam cause on the DBD PSN page it goes back to the priced game
---
That‚Äôs true but constant dc‚Äôs are frustrating. There‚Äôs really no perfect solution, even with overwatch I‚Äôve gotten the 10 min bans for dc‚Äôing only because of connection issues but there‚Äôs no way for them to verify that. Maybe they should drop someone by an entire rank as punishment if they dc.
---
You clearly don't understand how the perk works.
---
[Here](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Fixated) you can read what it does.
---
Killers only have one speed setting, usually 115% speed.
---
Survivors have 3 speed settings (not counting crawling and sprint bursts):
---
Crouching (28.25%, with urban evasion 56.5%)
---
Walking (65.5%, with fixated 67.8%)
---
Running (100%)
---
If you are chasing a survivor they will always run, so it's your 115% vs their 100% no matter if they have fixated or not.
---
Most of these were probably rank 20 baby demos.
---
Patrolling hooks is also a losing strategy.  Babykillers get wayyyyyyy too focused on the dude they have on the hook now they don't think about the person they should be chasing and hooking next.  Patrolling hooks loses gens and games against good survivors.  You aren't pressuring gens they'll pop fast.  Youre basically playing for a maybe 2k patrolling hooks hard.  Hook, leave pressure pressure pressure.  That's the recipe for a successful high rank killer.  And if you play this way at potato ranks it'll just be doublepip city since their emblems are a joke at that rank.
---
**meatcrab**
---
It's your job as a killer to make them split up not resort to toxic camping and tunneling. Them doing gens isn't toxic it's their freaking objective. Skilled killers would be able to split them up without resorting to that.
---
Isn't that even in the Film? That woman torchures (because of stupidity) and finally kills the hooked guy in the basement
---
Maybe not NOED bubbas already an insta down killer
---
you say it like there were multiple, I can only remember the blight event where we had to do the plants but other than that I can't remember any secondary objectives. I wish BHVR would just implement a secondary objective. Playing on high ranks is just annoying as fuck. Some games are fun when they actually do totems but then there are at least 50% of the game where they just focus gens, game is done quick, everyone gets only about 15k BP and thats it. Even as survivor I hate these games... Sometimes they even use BPS and still gen rush, what a fucking waste of BPS...
---
As a (mostly) legion main I think this would be a cool idea to change him up a bit
---
For now you have to apply them manually through a custom launcher
---
I think they were you're right lol
---
They are not necessarily broken, this is just ping plus being hit with a basketball, it caught the very tip of your hitbox (which was a little behind than what you see in this screen because of ping). Hatchets have this shape because survivors can't be hit on their limbs and their hitbox doesn't extend if they are in "running position".
---
The only broken aspect of her hatchets is related to being hit behind a generator while working on it, which causes your "hitbox to stand up" even though your model is crouched plus the cylinder is actually higher than most survivors models, specially females. This also happens when healing or being healed.
---
If it‚Äôs not pc exclusive, then we have a swf and a couple all unlocks w full perks.
---
Farm. A short time of farming for a fuck ton of blood to help everyone with their perk progressions is worth more than getting some kills. 
---
Hell, I'll do it for two BPS.
---
I think Biker kate is on sfm
---
5, actually. While Self-Care has unlimited potential, Inner Strength is more powerful in the arts of countering Perks/Status Effects &amp; instantaneous healing. Here‚Äôs what Inner Strength can counter:
---
‚Ä¢Mangled
---
‚Ä¢A Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
‚Ä¢Thanatophobia 
---
‚Ä¢Dying Light
---
‚Ä¢Coulrophobia
---
‚Ä¢Hex: Huntress Lullaby
---
And the fact that this Perk encourages Totem hunting makes people gain more Bloodpoints and increase the chances of denying NOED. 
---
And for the final reason why, let‚Äôs say the Killer is coming back to you after you‚Äôve been unhooked. You don‚Äôt have Iron Will or just not enough time to go unnoticed, so you head to a Locker to hide your groans of pain but most importantly, to activate Inner Strength. Self-Care can‚Äôt do that.
---
Get out of here with your negativity
---
Neat idea but perks are to busted and thats coming from a survivor main
---
&gt; Maybe they should drop someone by an entire rank as punishment if they dc.
---
For veteran players that usually are annoyed by red ranks queues, this wouldn't be a punishment.
---
I‚Äôm more of a STBFL and Grandma‚Äôs Heart/Pussy Willow gal. People will pop multiple traps giving me 0 and showing their aura and I just hit and run and by the time people try to go for saves they either rush and try to save vs 30% faster hits or pop a trap and spazz out. 
---
Hag is easily 4th best killer in the game but she gets no respect because people only want Ruin and don‚Äôt wanna set up for the long con late game.
---
In general he's just loud as fuck.
---
What is unrelenting again?
---
g
---
Leopard gecko I use to have one "Becky" lol
---
Well in that case there‚Äôs really no perfect solution
---
Hold the fuck up... did you photoshop the headcrab's legs onto a... blob?
---
Oh. Good to know. Ty.
---
Payed btw
---
That's strange but eh we just gotta wait and see
---
I've still not seen one in game yet, but I'm definitely familiar with the map...it's the only map I've played today, over it.
---
During the PTB people were saying that he was top tier, even better than Huntress or Hag. And I was like hell nah. Now that he's out and I've used him a bit, I'm still like hell nah. I like using Demo. He's fun to play as. The Shred can counter some short loops and be great at tight corridors but I think his portals could be more useful.
---
The perk which no1 uses cause its worthless.
---
Nope unrelenting only works your main weapon(m1) meaning it won't effect  Shred if you miss
---
"Aimlessly look around"...have you considered looking at the remaining gens lol.  If they want to survive that's where they'll be no BBQ required.
---
I wish Second Wind worked with Deliverance. It would be strong, yes, but it's very situational to set up and it takes 2 perk slots for something that can only be done once per match, if you're not the first one hooked.
---
I disagree your Idea makes the killer focus a survivor and with no prerequisite mori the rest.
---
Which platform do you use? Mobile? Or desktop PC?
---
I assume its caused by the explotion and that's why I didn't include it.
---
I had the same experience because the game decided to uninstall itself.
---
Ah thanks mate lol
---
r/uselessnobody
---
&gt;Well in that case there‚Äôs really no perfect solution
---
I think what we have now is a good solution. If people are DCing too much, like 20 games in a row or something, they will get banned. 
---
The problem is, we go against people that DC once in a while and think there isn't a punishment.
---
More like: PC players when they see the frame rate and graphics on console and realise paying for the game was worth having it properly optimised on their chosen platform.
---
Only 200? Ha! I have 172,000 hours so come back when you‚Äôre a real gamer like me üòé
---
The less hags I face, the better. Remove hag please
---
Self Care wastes time
---
I remember what it is now, and no.
---
That‚Äôs a Meghead if I ever seen one
---
idk maybe you don't play enough killer but on red ranks against swf teams during prime time you'll get a LOT of flaming, don't have to say a word, you'll get a ton. Usually only when they escape with 3 or 4 people but if you get a game like that most will flame you. At least on PC that's what happens, overall the survivor swf community is just toxic af.
---
I honestly think that the game would be in a much better state if they removed 3 or 4 man swf and limited ranked play to 2 man swf while 3 or 4 man would HAVE to use kyf.
---
I play on Xbox and played. And I also play it on PS4 and played for it. And I played for the PC version too (not playing because my PC is shit). I'm not one of those who started only because of PS Plus and then call me a fan.. ha!
---
Thanks m8
---
So you rather the Killer tunnel everyone individually and kill them after just one hook?
---
This makes it look like the stranger things chapter is free to play. Is that the case?
---
Do you know when the change will occur? I was surprised the first time that it didn‚Äôt break it.
---
The way how to access the flairs is different on PC and mobile, that's why PS4_Lover asked if you're using the reddit app :)
---
True. And its not like I was tunneling either, the guy I camped at endgame didn't even get hooked the whole game, he was pretty immersive.
---
No this is just an idea to fix broken mori's lol
---
It reduces to cooldown on attacks. Its minimal.
---
There's like a pallet every 10 feet. Good survivors that know how to loop will have little to no problem with this map. You just need to learn it.
---
Which in turn makes Plague boring to play because you're just a 115 killer with 3 stacks of devour hope.
---
I just wish the price to get them with iridescents wasn't so ridiculously high. About 22k, might as well not even have them unless you have absolutely every perk already.
---
Case and point.
---
I disagree, it would help balance out the SWF and solo disparity and discourage camping. I'd be ok with shortening the proximity to the hook. Killers already have the far greater advantage.
---
Lobby dodging will still be a thing with dedicated servers, even as a killer. If your regional server is full, it will throw you in the next nearest one. It could be 100ms, it could be 300ms.
---
DUD ochido is my favorite XD don‚Äôt you love when he says DUD and when he tbags LUL
---
Oh I forgot that only the blight event had that, sorry
---
I can too, but at the same time I see facing people like this as an opportunity to get better. Besides, you still get blood bloodpoints out of it lol.
---
Prayer beads, like most people
---
Unrelenting only works with basic M1 attacks.
---
Zip zoom
---
I'm with you, while I don't hate new Freddy, I just loved Freddy's old kit and I was a fucking machine with him.  He was my go to red rank killer.  People played him like a mindless M1 tunnel machine which is why they lost all their games playing him which is why he was "the worst killer in dbd".
---
That's no headcrab, itsa meatcrab.  \~\~gorgonzola's\~\~ Demogorgon's pet.
---
See. This is what I was thinking but thats why i made it to where survivors would start with the jacket on. That way it can help catch even SWF off guard
---
Yeah and I feel like that‚Äôs the bigger problem, the people who dc every couple of games. They‚Äôll keep doing it without any punishments.
---
Where do you even see cosmetics like that XD? What you people talking about?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm probs not going to buy demo, despite all the salty survivors telling me to.  His perks just aren‚Äôt good enough to be worth $5. 
---
Killer main btw
---
Learn the maps. Pallet spawns and jungle gyms might be different but the main structures are the same. Knowing where you are at and where to lead a chase is a survivors greatest way to prolong your chances of survival. (And always be productive)
---
Moris are not broken if insta heals and keys arent broken lOl
---
It is actually better to let them stay together, they get more done when alone. Anyway, what is the Killer's objective? 
---
Oh and camping isn't toxic. Some players don't know any better and sometimes Survivors stay around the hook, why should the Killer leave in that situation? Sitting in front of someone for no reason is pretty toxic tho.
---
I want this to be true lol
---
Idk about you but that's the scariest raw chicken I've seen chasing me.
---
It's no headcrab, itsa meatcrab. ~~Gorgonzola's~~ Demogorgon's pet.
---
I had that same daily and same thing earlier. Played an Ivory and was planning on using it on 3rd hook. Feng Ming suicides on her first hook. The other 3 try to suicide as well but they are insta-saving each other. Nancy DC‚Äôd when I found her again. Let the Nea and Steve complete 4 gens and heal each other but then I had to mori one and could only find Steve. Sent them an apology and explained I had a daily.
---
Get out of here with your unnecessary comment
---
I think you replied to the wrong guy. :)
---
Well then have fun being the complety worthless vs SWF
---
I think they are ALL broken. I play both sides at high rank and I feel they all need to be changed.
---
So your post isn‚Äôt unnecessary ü§î
---
I hope that one day us console players get the option to wear this mask. 
---
Is Deathgarden EVER gonna be released on XBOX?
---
I've been red ranks every season. The map is awful and the fact that you're saying "there's a pallet 10 feet" makes me realize you're also low ranked. A pallet doesn't mean anything if there is no way to loop around it. The loops on this map are short and got nerfed from the test realm to live. Your rank 20 is showing
---
hover over the "play free now" button and press X.... then let us know what happens... would be more helpful to do that...
---
spirit, nurse and maybe are the only killers that aren't complete shit on rank 1... It does sound like you don't play killer on red ranks though.
---
THIS KEEPS HAPPENING!! Also robbed me of two achievements!
---
SWF matchmaking is so bad that it doesn't seem like it matches people based on rank anymore. I'm in red ranks and I constantly got killers and survivors that were rank 16-20 yesterday. Only once did I get someone that was close to my rank. Unless you're in a full group, SWF matchmaking is miserable, and even if you're in one, expect most killers to be nowhere near your rank. I felt bad for the killers and gave some of them free hooks.
---
Um...surge was buffed from the ptb. and demi is getting a buff too
---
Ik your pain but its wierd i only get booted off when im doing swf and when i do its not just dbd its completely off my xbox at first i thought it was my wifi acting up but my friends were having similar issues
---
It's called an ethernet cable, and they are dirt cheap.
---
Same on Xbox. Every since the update, it's been running like shit.
---
Genrush is usually the result of an incompetent killer player unable to apply enough pressure so I mean, they might have the right to be offended
---
That's not my experience on PC at all. If you play poorly as a killer you get shit talked.
---
That was pretty hard to watch such serious survivor misplays. That nancy could have definitely gotten out if she ran past you and went straight for the gate instead of going around. Regardless dead is dead.
---
The only problem is not knowing the map you're going to unless I spam map offerings. I'd rather use lithe or the new combo of Fixated/Sprint burst
---
Tone can be odd online and come across different as intended. I'm not justifying what happened to you but from another perspective it could seem like salt or passive aggression. I am a survivor main that only ever plays in a full group of friends. Because of this killers often subconsciously go on the defensive and flame when we congratulate them on some of their plays because they mistake our words as sarcasm. Because things can get a bit heated sometimes it's good to look that it could simply be a tonal misunderstanding between both parties. It happens.
---
I r·∫£ely see ping 100ms in my region. Normaly 170-250ms üò¢
---
No. I'm simply expressing what I had to deal with in my first match after the dlc release. I guess I forgot how ignorant people can be in the dbd community. That includes you
---
Yup, all it does is rob them of their own points and gives survivors the satisfaction of getting their opponent to rage quit.
---
Easy to say for a killer main.
---
What if the game introduces a dog killer?
---
Payed? I thing you played yourself there
---
Maybe I'm not sure what exactly gen rushing is I thought it's where they're all together doing a gen. Camping is toxic especially when it's the first on the hook. If a survivor is around the hook then that's fine that's the survivor's fault but they didn't do that in my games in the video it doesn't show when the killer camped or tunneled either but you'd understand if it did.
---
Its slower with the billt anad lf too if you time it wrong. If you time it right you can either hit the survivor or break a pallet by using it instead.
---
A reference inside a reference? That‚Äôs like... 18 walls!
---
Yeah, whole DLC 12$ and just a little outfit 10$? Crazy.
---
Just buy another DLC for 8$ or wait until sale and buy 2 for 8$.
---
With they would at least make sales on the outfits like 30-50% like in RL haha
---
Oh wow you really put me in my place üôÑ
---
Don't know how you get offended about that but good luck to them
---
the situation should improve after they fix matchmaking. they somehow missed it in the last big update
---
Who's ochido? (Serious question)
---
If you're going to increase the Aura distance then you're not adding extra wiggle speed
---
I love the sound design for this killer.  I'm just wondering how I managed to get a gen grab yesterday after exiting a portal with how loud his stomping is.
---
I‚Äôve sucked on many ballsacks, never have I seen one look like this, dude you have weird balls.
---
i just add ppl i find randomly and sometimes they invite me
---
Go ahead and keep saying dumb shit. You're only proving my point üòÇüòÇ
---
Honestly i think he should be able to switch between tier 1 and 2
---
I play on ps4
---
FEEEEEEED MEEEEE
---
It‚Äôs only 5% and besides, once you memorize hook spawns you really don‚Äôt need their aura.
---
Read above.
---
How would that catch them off guard?
---
‚ÄúAre you running to the gen by shack?‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh its the killer‚Äù
---
Yep I‚Äôm proving your point üôÑ
---
I play with 2 of my irl friends your welcome to join
---
Yeah...and the plague also took place in the 1300s, not 1986 like Chernobyl.
---
Oh for sure I get that. And once he got offended, I was like no wait man like I‚Äôm saying good job. You did your gens way faster than I could handle. Hats off to you. But the fact that I called it gen rushed was mean apparently. Lol
---
Pc gamers when they have consistently 60 FPS and don‚Äôt have to pay to play online :))
---
I have an Ethernet cable dipshit
---
Because moris are bullshit from survivor point of view. Even the green one.
---
Oof
---
But then you either break the pallet and keep chasing, or you just hit the survivor instead, so it does acaullty save you time.
---
Yep üôÑ
---
Lol at paying a monthly sub to play console games online.
---
Hook always spawn in the same spot same thing with totems same thing of generators.
---
5% when you're searching for something can be quite a lot especially when you have to take the time to look and you're being knocked around a lot more
---
I'm confused you're defending DC's if they decide they want to ragequit but don't do it every game?
---
This is not a PS4 specific problem
---
The chase music is good though. It's not as loud as the original (I think).
---
On a side note you got massive balls brining a haddonfield offering as killer
---
Had this happen to me in one of my games. It‚Äôs terrifying! Hahaha
---
Aside from Balance Landing being too tier on this map. I have to agree, there a thousand pallets and they all are all unsafe. I'm not a good looper, nor do I like that kind of playstyle but is it too much to ask for all the pallets not to be complete deathtraps? I swear I saw some pallets that I would have been better off not even dropping and just keep running.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d619fh/fixated_is_bugged_right_now/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Gen rushing is when Survivors are only interested in gens. I.e. Gens pop within two minutes and game is done within five. What rank are you at?
---
Its always terrifying when they want spare you after they pretty much *destroyed* the team, because you know you have no chance to escape even if you wanted to lolol
---
You'll get used to it. Just say thanks at the end chat and be in your way, maybe do some friendly chat, its a great way to meet people. Scary but friendly killers are fun people to play with.
---
I think he's one of those killers who take 5 steps back at every pallet :D
---
Yea but the stun is way longer than breaking a pallet normally meaning it's worse and  you probably won't hit them if they atleast have half a brain and stick near areas that are curved or have cover against the shred it's really only good if the survivors just drop pallets immediately when they see the demogorgon open his mouth
---
Tnx bro
---
You gotta learn to ignore the trolls. They're bored with immersion and role-playing so they pick on you to feel smart. Ice them out so they're just playing generator simulator in cyberspace by themselves while you have fun playing with the others
---
I did, took me straight to the priced game and nothing free
---
Run Small Game (doubles as Ruin finding tool)and Inner Strength for multiple insta-heels.  You'd be surprised how many totems go uncleansed throughout the trail.
---
Hmm that‚Äôs very odd I was rank 11-10 yesterday and was facing him plenty. Now I‚Äôm back to purple rank and I‚Äôve stopped seeing him. Demo takes skill to use and people just wanna tryhard. Feelsbad cause I really enjoy going against him.  I hope you get to face him soon he‚Äôs super scary
---
(: sounds fun!! I‚Äôll dm you my psn !!
---
Oh I thought it was something else and I'm a 9 right now as a survivor I usually play as a killer but my noob friends got the game so I'm helping them in SWF
---
Already put the ticket in to customer support. Its the only time that this has happened so far and I cant recreate it to see exactly how it works, but Killers watch out if you see a Nancy running like the wind. Im a survicor main and think this is fucked and unfair if it is found out how to be exploited.
---
Why? I've learned plenty from him.
---
Get over it, people are new they have to learn how to play.
---
Still new players should know they can stun killers with them right? Wait I just got an idea, they think it can block the killer and they actually don‚Äôt know they can break it
---
Nope, I haven‚Äôt bought the new chapter yet so I got excited but it‚Äôs not free lol
---
For what it's worth i don't think it "needs" a buff, i'd let it be for a while and see how people react to it and with it (it's been on live for a day or so).
---
However i also don't think buffing it to work injured would throw balance off and make it OP.
---
I think the devs are watching how the perk is used and collect data on it, then make the decision (they probably considered making it work injured at first but feared it would be too strong)
---
PC players when they have a consistent frame work, access to the PTB, and a community not filled with 13 year olds only playing because it's free like Fortnite
---
Same, hmu fellow ps4 users
---
But then you force them to drop the pallet or you get a free hit thus it still has uses.
---
Were you serious?
---
Thanks dude. Hopefully I get a game
---
&gt;I'm confused you're defending DC's if they decide they want to ragequit but don't do it every game?
---
I am not necessarily defending it, just pointing out that DBD is basically a casual game with no actual competitive progress gain or loss. When someone DCs, the match just becomes annoying for the remaining survivors and dull for the killer but if you wrap up the game quickly, just jump in the next one. 
---
I don't think harshly punishing casual players for DCing once in a while would be the way to go, specially since DBD doesn't have the biggest population to start with.
---
Clown and Trapper are my personal favorites. I enjoy the playstyle of closing off loops and predicting where survivors will be, but something about how the hag does it isn't for me. Maybe the teleport is such a commitment
---
Ash vs. Evil Dead Season 4 leak
---
Ye I was hoping for that look too.
---
Head On, Inner Strength, Quick and Quiet, and Decisive Strike is a really fun build to run
---
Yeah a lot of players like that, it happens on both sides. Unfortunately it's not an issue unique to survivors, it's a community issue. People are far too defensive. When me and my party loaded into a game the other day, my game crashed on the loading screen and it cancelled the match. The killer then spent a stupidly long time flaming the rest of my friends in the lobby despite the fact it was a cancelled match and he kept his mori. I mean I get that it looked suspect because there was an unknown offering and the match crashed but I never even reached the offering screen. It's about perspective and the unfortunate lack of it each side has of each other. Unfortunately though the communities toxicity issue comes from the fact that a lot of people cannot see past the fact that at the end of the day it's a video game, it's not that deep. None of this is directed at you in anyway just a food for thought reflection on the weird headspace the community is in. This weird us vs them dichotomy that we have going. It's still very strange to me years later.
---
I've heard good things :)
---
They said they‚Äôre aiming for this Mid chapter patch, but after dedicated servers just got delayed I‚Äôm not very confident that it will release on time.
---
Literally this
---
the big deal is that you waste a perk slot, since you really dont need items to win.
---
last night my killer queues were like 5 seconds long for a bit, it was incredible
---
Babyragers completely ruin the survivor experience and make the game shitty for killers too.  This should not be acceptable behavior and there should be punishment in place for players that do it otherwise they'll continue doing it at will everytime they get a killer or addon they don't want to play.  A lockout timer would help discourage it and if they decide to leave the community so be it they were worthless cancer anyways.
---
I'm not sure it's a match making problem, as it seems to be way too much salt. Playing with a group all at similar rank here.
---
lol that's hilarious, mans cosplaying the movie
---
Well it depends on the loop if we're talking autohaven or any of the Wraiths map they curve enough on each side and are long completely negating the lunge as it's still loopable and you'll have to run it like any other M1 killer
---
Yeah, I really like the music
---
The way I recomend you use inner strength is as a last-resort healing tool. I just break a totem when I see one and play the game like normal, when there are no teammates to heal me, I get into a locker
---
high tier in low ranks, shit tier in high ranks. Why do you care anyways? play for fun
---
Exactly
---
oh shit didn't notice
---
yeah just saw it
---
It will always be like that near the first day of a DLC. It'll go back to normal once the developers can deal with the rush of players.
---
&gt;Babyragers completely ruin the survivor experience and make the game shitty for killers too.

---
yikes.
---
Fuck Skips Ahoy...THIS is the cosmetic we NEED!!!!!!
---
My biggest problem were the survivors dcing tbh.. Out of 15-17 games , they escaped/i did 2 or less kills in 3 games, rest i managed killing 3 survivors in and expect a couple that last surv got hatch , all rest !! #BlessRNG
---
Where do I get it
---
Doing gens, you?
---
The actual yikes is you on here defending the practice of ragequitting like a toddler.  This is such a weird weird thing to defend.  It ruins the game for every other player and costs survivors games.  You defending it makes it look like you're another infantile asshole that does this in game yourself.
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug: Audio
---
When a firecracker/party starter goes off, the Killer will have the deafened/muffled sounds for the rest of the game. Just experienced this as Spirit and couldn‚Äôt hear anything - everything except hook screams were barely audible. I didn‚Äôt get blinded by the firecracker but it went off nearby and caused the rest of the game to be almost silent.
---
You can also join the discord that‚Äôs how I met all of the people I play with.
---
If you have headphones it‚Äôs really not that much of a problem, maybe that‚Äôs just me though
---
Nea has balanced landing which is a pretty great perk on some maps and urban evasion for sneaking around, if you play console David King has dead hard which is great for extending your life and we're gonna live forever for more bloodpoints.
---
Well offended is probably the wrong word, I just find it hilarious how bad killers will instantly blame ¬´genrush¬ª when they lose, when in reality they just arent good enough
---
yes, i know we pay annualy, i know i spelled paid wrong, i know we dont have PTB, i know the frame rate is shitty and etc.
---
but you guys still paid for it lol
---
I have a better idea, how about it gives the rescuer bonuses as well? 
---
If you‚Äôre injured and unhook a survivor within the killer‚Äôs terror radius, the rescuer is given the endurance effect for 6/7/8 seconds along with the rescuer‚Äôs aura being revealed. 
---
If the rescuer is healthy, then the unhooked survivor is given a 150% speed boost for 3 seconds and exhausts the rescuer for the 60/50/40 seconds along with the rescuers aura being revealed. If the rescuer is already exhausted, then the exhaustion time stacks.
---
PC also gets david for free.
---
They still can't escape whenever they want to...
---
If you play a bunch, sure. If not, no. 
---
You get a bloody cosmetic, but it's called 'prestige' for a reason...
---
Yup! Haha. I've done that myself with the Prayer Beads add on. I'm sure they didn't find that fun lmao.
---
GET SELF CARE, the ability to heal yourself is amazing, even if it‚Äôs at 50% rate. 
---
I would get adrenaline, technician if you‚Äôre bad at skill checks, Decisive Strike (or DS) can be really good, and then I‚Äôd do windows of opportunity, or Balanced Landing
---
This probably wouldn‚Äôt work very well. Survivors just would avoid each other at all costs. Perks like bond would either be extremely overpowered, or basically useless. When sitting on a gen to regress it you‚Äôll just get gen rushed by the other gens. The ability is basically just a worse version of PGTW.
---
Yes I‚Äôm from the future Pennywise and Jason get added but don‚Äôt anyone ü§´
---
Cujo maybe?
---
du heck?
---
Since starting a few months ago queue times have been getting progressively shorter for me
---
Lol its pretty obvious you just got outplayed /s
---
yep! same here. its very unnerving
---
No, *you* should read above.
---
MinotauroBigNog
---
Adept Braincell is pretty good.
---
But have any of you fools seen a *Prestige III Braincell?!*
---
Literally no-one says that, but I wouldn't expect a Blendette to understand what anyone in this game thinks.
---
Head On absolutely destroys in SWF groups, because you can coordinate your downs in good positions or transfer a chase to someone not injured. It's just not as useful in random matches.
---
That's how it looks
---
Was about to say something like that 
---
But also remember you get the ability you heal your Friends faster and Unhook them so try to play and get those points.
---
And I agree if the obsession dies I think you should keep them but lose half of them or something like that.
---
Dude same
---
Survivors when I play as Demogorgon leading my eventual bashing in of my own skull this asshole killer is a damn potato.
---
Which platform are you on? On ps4 it's 2000 shards for 150k BP. I can provide a screenshot this evening if you'd like
---
I personally just like doing it for extra progression objectives. I'm a bit of a completionist. But outside of personal achievement, there isn't much benefit. 
---
With your amount of hours, I would honestly recommend getting everyone in the game up to level 50 before taking a prestige plunge. By then you will probably have a better idea of whether it's something you want to do.
---
Yea I'm pretty sure everyone agrees that Freddy didn't need this buff and it should get removed like why make the only thing survivors can use against campers negated by being asleep I mean you could wake up but what if the survivor will die soon and I mean what if you're already near the hook it won't hurt to save but oh you're asleep your teammates can just get tunneled now
---
It must have been reported. 
---
And when I first came across this comment he had 20 downvotes
---
Biggest complaint with Trapper is the whole "set traps at the exit gates and get notified when one is disarmed" tactic. Pretty much guaranteed you're not escaping if you're the last survivor. And same with Hag and the basement hooks. Both valid strategies of course, but it's every damn game lol.
---
I personally hate the change to dying light. You know what's worse than getting tunneled and sacrificed? Getting tunneled and lying on the ground for four minutes while your bleed out timer slowly kills you.
---
Yeah I had that problem too people be dc'ing against Myers like wild. Even more than doctor in my experience.
---
The problem is those pallets are unsafe. Ya there are tons of pallets but you have to get the stun to not get hit. The killer doesn't need to break the pallet either.
---
Bye bye eyes.
---
*drops*

"Henderson!"

*Thank you*. I was afraid I'd get downvoted into oblivion if I were the first to say that. Chernobyl was a terrible disaster. And it wasn't just "oh no you all have cancer now, whoops." Three brave men sacrificed their lives to prevent an even worse disaster that could have wiped out Europe. Trying to make a video game out of Chernobyl (not saying you can't do it, but it'd have to be extremely serious and thoughtful) is like trying to make one out of Hurricane Katrina.

A toxic nobody would gained a lot of popularity (and notoriety) from being toxic. He had been banned numerous times, for numerous reasons, such as exploiting bugs, rallying his fanbase to harass other streamers, starting witch-hunts etc., until finally he was permanently banned from both PC and PS4.  
---
There was talk about him potentially being paedophile, but like most cancel culture crusades, there was never any substantial evidence to back this claim.
---
I played like 6 times on the new map and 10 times against Demo.. sorry for everyone who didn't had that much luck. I'm not sure if I should buy the DLC or wait until sale. I don't have any BP and still need to level my Laurie and Bill. In addition to that I want to buy Freddy on next Sale and I want to buy the Metal guy with shards .. so .. I'm confused haha
---
And from a survivor point it will probably make them stay away from others (unless it‚Äôs swf) making them easier to pick off
---
Wtf are you talking about, I made no mention of teabagging hindering me. Its not fun to play against them at all, and just makes me not wanna play the game. Especially when I have 2 perks of which they are all tier 1, and im fighting a full stacked SWF.
---
Put on Object of Obsession and look at how cute/derpy Demo's aura looks from a distance :P Lil' feetsies go stomp stomp stomp...
---
It works more often than not lol
---
The Shadow Person.
---
Survivors are equipped with cameras. The killer is invisible to the survivors unless they are captured on camera. A Shadow Person can angerly affect lockers, gens, and similar but can not interact with the survivor until exposed.
---
To ways to meme this
---
To be continued 
---
Or
---
We‚Äôll be right back
---
To clarify since so many people are hung up on the "nerfing" part... I should have said "rework", would be more accurate for what I had in mind. I want them changed because it's always the same damn game with those killers, they don't need to be weakened. üëç
---
Actually, the Plague was from Ancient Babylon. I'm sure diseases happened back then, but the Plague's backstory is 99% fiction.
---
It should be the upstairs gen yeah, but it has not worked once for me on pc whilst other platforms got the achievement that way
---
Please somebody put the chase music on this
---
Don't worry about people who shit talk, they're usually not that good.
---
I threw in bps and could game end like 2 minutes into the match as billy (someone even DC'd) on haddonfield.
---
So I faux played, intentionally threw chases/ kills and only committed to EXTREMELY ambitious chainsaws all match to get my BPS's worth.
---
Got called a noob idiot in postgame chat after letting them live
---
I just played Deathgarden during the free weekend and it gave me both Meg and Trapper's masks.  There was a twist though, it turned out Deathgarden is pretty fun so I bought it anyway.
---
nay
---
Otherwise, if you want some help from experienced players on your platform check out: [https://discord.gg/UUqMd4K](https://discord.gg/UUqMd4K)
---
Yay*
---
I really don't mind playing against basement leatherface, much better than a ruin nurse or try hard spirit or insta saw Billy.
---
DC
---
Yeah I get this for sure! That‚Äôs why I always try be positive in post-game chat regardless. The salt is real!
---
The wiggle effects really don‚Äôt do much. It‚Äôs very easy to counter it.
---
He's too dangerous to be kept alive
---
Unless the killer is close by I usually don't run when I leave the gen because if you don't leave tracks and they happen to come by, they will usually spend time patrolling the area. If the killer is in a chase I will continue to work on the gen.
---
Wiggle effects on the Memorial Institute will beg to differ
---
It's not just you, any survivor that is not a potato knows how mediocre demogorgon is
---
I stay on it until Spine Chill activates üòÖ
---
Tru3 not that bad first dbd streamer I watched and learned stuff from
---
&gt;Nah you DC there should be a cooldown of 5min. And get increasingly higher if DCd over a period of 24 hours. Up to a 24 hour ban. There's no excuse to DC from either side.
---
I disagree. Not only because DBD is a casual game but you do this and then killers start complaining about queue times. When a survivor DCes from one game, he immediately joins another that he probably won't DC again because most people know there is in fact bans for DCing but only if you do it too much. 
---
Ultimately, even if they add this 5 minutes to 24h ban, people will just start dying on hooks which would lead to the same outcome, 3v1 early in the game.
---
Nice hook placement bhvr pretty good job
---
bhvr making random changes based on god knows what or who...idk what the hell are they doing

---
Yeah getting teabagged infront of pallets because the survivor stunned you midshred is really.... annoying. Im happy that they will add the shred pallet break to his basekit atleast
---
I will fulfill my duty and your desires. Soon.
---
I upvoted you so you'd be evened out
---
I think they have a whole lore writing team so it doesn't affect the people who work on the health and other stuff on the game.
---
Count on it.
---
Just hide the chat. Looping, flashlights, tunneling etc are part of the game and going to happen. Some of that stuff you learn to counter the better you get at playing. I hardly ever get blinded anymore by flashlights unless someone is very good with them, and if someone is looping you and you‚Äôre struggling with it just leave them and go looking for their team mates. All their looping will be pointless if you ignore them and go after their generator doing buddies.
---
I've yet to play on this map as survivor but have played it a lot as killer and I would say the best thing you can do at an unsafe pallet is camp it and try to get the stun to run away but if the killer has enduring then it doesn't matter that much. Also if you have just enough distance on the killer I would just drop those extremely unsafe pallets early as fuck and keep running, making the killer have to go around the pallet, giving you a bit of distance.
---
A combination of screaming profanities and running away as a distraction so others can stay on the gen. If I'm by myself, stay on it no matter what
---
By the time I figured out how his controls a gen was f9ne. Rank 5 never again.
---
Counter PSA: camp if NEEDED.   If you just hook and book especially if there's a survivor or two (or three) nearby, that's instantly lost pressure. And for Entity's sake DON'T HOOK AND BOOK WHEN ALL GENS ARE DONE.  That's a guaranteed lost kill.  And make absolutely sure you punish hook diving.  OP, stop trying to neuter new killers before they learn what's what.
---
Same it would fit perfectly
---
Thx
---
How do u get tyw5 meg thing anyway
---
1 - 2 Hurts just a bit because I got Deathgarden back when it was crap.
---
Game is pretty good now though. :) I recommend it at least to try. If you don't like it you can just refund the game on Steam, but I really recommend getting a few friends (maybe your SWF group) together and running some blood.
---
Lol, are you wanting to have a rememberance day for people that died over 700 years ago? People that you have no idea who they are and have never heard of? My point is that Chernobyl happened fairly recently, while the plague did not. People's spouses and kids are still alive while their family members died. We don't know anyone that is directly related to people that died from the plague. I think that's why a Chernobyl DLC wouldn't be a good idea, because it happened so recently.
---
Give 2-3s(which is the time the gen needs to start repairing again) and keep working on it.
---
I barely ran into Demogorgons somehow, I did run into a lot of people running Dying Light though lol.
---
I hate the new map.
---
Otherwise it's fine
---
You can't avoid flashlight while breaking pallets? Good to know, thanks!
---
It was a promotional cosmetic for an eSports event in Korea.
---
With that being said you can honestly just buy a recolor of Feng's default cosmetics for 900 Shards. Looks about the same and doesn't Mori your wallet.
---
I just pissed my pants
---
&gt; You red rank every season right? So you got to be capable of doing that.
---
Yes because most maps have loops that have counterplay and are balanced between the killer and survivor. The person who comes out on top is who is better at reading the other. 
---
With the new map, I'd say about 90% of the pallets are extremely killer-sided. You're literally better off throwing the pallet down without looping a single time and then just running for it and hoping the killer is bad by wasting his time breaking the pallet instead of just walking beside it and chasing/downing you. That isn't good game design and makes it unfun for everyone and unfair for survivors.
---
Self care isnt shit because randoms dont know what healing is.
---
U r pbbly a urban trashy player... I really hate those guys.
---
Also if someone is blinding you with a flashlight anyway you can typically listen for their footsteps(or moaning if they‚Äôre injured) as they run away. 
---
Against flashlights isn‚Äôt so bad in comparison to instaheals, purple/red keys with addons etc
---
TAKE MY MONEY !!
---
But then u ain‚Äôt using spine chill at all...
---
Nope, you‚Äôre just bad with him.
---
I do play rank 1 killer. Many times before all the nice buffs killers have got now. Imagine being a Myers main in 2016. If you think only s tier killers are viable you probably think you have to 4k to win and isnt it nice you have at least 3 killers that can 4k effortlessly every single game? Spoiled killers are nowadays. You arent supposed to 4k every game. That's called being broken.
---
Not to mention Freddy can just slap the rescuer and not even worry about the save during the hit cooldown, because now the rescuer is asleep and BT can't proc.
---
Me and my friends when we realise the killer is a baby killer will always give him a free kill, however because we don't really care about rank, just fun we'll fight to be the one to be sacrificed and will let the killer chase us for a while too. We play in a way so that they can learn affective patterns to use against survivors for their future games. Sometimes we'll lose them then start again. It's really nice to see them get better bit by bit. Once they are one of us will stop in the open and die. That way not only did they killer get some nice farm but hopefully he picked up a few tricks too.
---
Especially atm with rank reset and the new chapter almost every killer has been super low rank and we've done the gens way too fast.
---
I built a new PC to be able to play as Nancy with ultra settings.
---
What do you expect them to do? Run into your arms? Grow up.
---
He is so easily dogged I have yet to come across a good one
---
The queues on console are actually really nice , in the afternoon there‚Äôs a bunch of people on so you don‚Äôt have to wait long ,
---
I thought it worked with Deliverance? Did they change it after the PTB? If I remember correctly, the requirements for the perk to activate were 1 full heal and not being broken when getting hooked. Deliverence breaks you when you get unhooked, just like second wind, so it should work.
---
I could care less for that 6% gen increase üòõ I only use it to know if I think the killer is closing in on my position
---
Looping is fine.
---
Tunneling is something the killer does, so not sure how that can force him to camp.
---
Flashlight spamming - Yes. If you *click*click*click* and follow me around spamming flashlight at me I'm going to put you on the hook and *stab*stab*stab* I'm just repaying your friendliness.
---
Ayy
---
oh wowww they changed it? so all this time that i was hunting it at 3gens was for nothing? geeeez. no wonder i had such bad luck finding it. thats crazy
---
I installed Netflix on my laptop to watch Stranger Things after the DLC came out. I've also heard that Ash V.S. Evil Dead is on Netflix, and there are some other things I want to watch like the Invader Zim movie.
---
Yeah I thought you guys meant there was like a higher class store or something :P
---
Cant be me, I've been haunting the hawking's lab with Spirit today
---
I think the thing about survivors turning into mori-able and hook-able husks upon DC was said to happen soon at some point. Maybe with dedicated servers, I forgot.
---
Playing the game like everyone else?
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
I cannot imagine how scary Spirit is on that map. Spine Chill is mad unreliable so either nothing gets done or you get the grab every time
---
In case your wondering what happened afterwards, after I believe an hour and a half, the legion left the game. Random got double pip and 30,000 BP. He says that the greatest achievement that day was breaking the killers will.
---
That's every game for me.   
---
load in,walk 3 steps,killer eats my face.
---
The only change I would make is to let the unhooked person see the killer's aura when they get unhooked, so they don't just run straight into the killers face when they are unhooked.
---
No. It's a shit move. Don't excuse it.
---
I don't know???
---
20, will probably never get better
---
... i can't
---
Not BP.  Emblem points.  More specifically, the Chaser emblem decays if you're within X meters of a hooked survivor unless:
---
You are in a chase.
---
Another survivor is also in that same radius.
---
He‚Äôs really fun but average.
---
I wasn't sure which would take effect first but I suppose this does cover that.
---
Just know if you get caught youll be camped af. Because you are a hated breed.
---
Well im sorry for your poor experience. The game is very frustrating for both sides atm and naturally every end game chat is 4v1. Also I think if the survs have had a string of toxic killers they will be less kind to the nicer ones so dont take it too personally.
---
 It's sad this game gets compared to LoL the more popular it gets.
---
Even if it is, I doubt you‚Äôll get the cosmetic. The devs already said all exclusives are only on pc.
---
r/dbdtrade
---
Don‚Äôt overly use shred. If you can just basic attack em. Using shred in deadzones is easy, wait for them to line up with your lunge rather than adjusting your aim for their movement. Shredding a survivor on a loop is like billy, charge up and attack right after rounding a corner.
---
Portals should be hidden around generators. Since you‚Äôre undetected a couple seconds after teleporting, use that time to get the first hit on unsuspecting survivors working on gens.
---
BBQ, STBFL, Ruin and Whispers/Discordance are my perks.
---
I expect them not to be arrogant pieces of shit when they know full and well they are using shit moves. And youre telling me to grow up, when looping is the equivalent of a five year olds tag strategy? Alrighty then
---
What if you don't run to a corner to self care? Would it still be useless then? I'm having a really hard time understanding why *selfcare* is apparently so bad, other than "because the streamer I watch said so".

Yea I was expecting it quite a bit but only ran into him twice and the second one camped and tunneled pretty hard

Hmmm, more of a free time sketch not really a "official" sketcb they do on the computers in their work environment.
---
Couldnt take the laugh had to stop watching
---
if you dc by turning off your console or closing out of the game on the ps4/xbox menu, everyone gets 0 bloodpoints. Even though the game counts up all your bloodpoints and shows you how many you've earned st the end you won't get them. It's baffling how they haven't done anything about it in the very long time it's been in the game, and since everyone knows about it, if you piss a killer off or they just bad they can disconnect like that so you don't get any bloodpoints.
---
For the record the hatch doesn‚Äôt just rely on gens, the number of survivors matter as well. It‚Äôs when the number of survivors +1= number of completed gens
---
Also give us a holstered nailed bat across his back! Something along those lines would be awesome.
---
I would just skip around and you‚Äôd get the point
---
I seem to spawn near it every time
---
I guess that‚Äôd work, but it‚Äôd be really cool if the perk was more dynamic. The perk should be more engaging for the rescuer so it makes them feel like they‚Äôre actually protecting someone.
---
Same here.
---
If you don''t run into a corner to self-care, it's a waste of a perk slot, since you aren't suing the perk.
---
If you do run into a corner to self-care, you waste time.
---
It's bad in the same way that any other perk is bad-too weak to qualify the perk slot.
---
Lanterns too from a while back
---
Completely forgot he can just smack the rescuer to deny the save also. That just makes the buff even more unnecessary
---
Leveling up a low tier killer?
---
Being toxic is a shit move, sure. But using an item in the game for its intended purpose isn‚Äôt a shit move. Flashlights are very easily counter-able. You are obviously just being outplayed. 
---
Instead of complaining about it on reddit, perhaps you could use your time to learn to counter flashlights easier and listen for the footsteps, or watch some YouTube tutorials for killer and looping. I‚Äôd recommend OhTofu or Otzdarva
---
It's from benedict bakers journal
---
Rank 15 killer is why you suck, not because you're using a new killer. Get your rank up little one
---
Best perk imo.
---
It's Chinese. It means "Mcote was here".
---
It was at this moment Steve knew. He fucked up
---
I have played 850 hours on both sides combined and I've encountered nothing that I could link to your "hand holding". Please, enlighten me, what is this "handholding" you are talking about
---
Ah yes, me being at rank 15 means i couldnt have possibly played the game and deleted it for a few months. I was a rank 2 huntress awhile ago. Stop speaking out your fucking ass
---
Just screw company policy.

Someone's going to find a way to consistently do this and just sit there teabagging.

The disease that the Plague has was made up. BHVR fabricated a nameless disease for the Plague. And she definitely does not have the bubonic Plague, since that wasn‚Äôt located anywhere near the Fertile Crescent (where Adiris likely lived) between 500-600 BCE. It‚Äôs okay for BHVR to make up tragedies that act as the origin stories of killers since nobody can be disrespected by them due to their fictitious nature, while it is *not* okay to take a national tragedy that could‚Äôve left most of Eastern Europe irradiated for centuries, which in turn would‚Äôve led to the deaths of hundreds of millions from radiation poisoning and the lack of clean water, and turn it into the backstory of a killer in some slasher game.
---
Oh, and the Black Death didn‚Äôt kill ‚Äúalmost half of the world‚Äù. It only killed 30% to 60% of the population of *Europe* a long time ago. Only about 25 million died from the disease, which is only about 1/13 of the total population in the 14th century.

Nope, PS4 PRO

Try to get as many perks on the web as possible to eliminate them from the pool and increase the chances of it showing up
---
doesnt matter still give money to bhvr lmao
---
Looping is a legit tactic. What else are survivors supposed to do? Let you get them?
---
Tunnelling - most killers do it and there are perks to counter it. Learn when to unhook and when not to unhook. If you can't help, do something else.
---
Flashlight Spammers - they are just toxic.
---
This happened to me and my friends when we all brought bps and were about to escape after getting our friend and we all got 0 blood points.
---
I'm on PC and my frames took a big fat shit while playing killer. Not so much when playing survivor tho,oddly enough.
---
He‚Äôs not low tier. He‚Äôs the complete and polar opposite of low tier. You just need time to figure him out like every other top tier killer.
---
ok now my strategy is to be afk killer until all 5 gens are done, then search for it as they finish up. i have the game on while i do other stuff and this is my final trophy. thanks for the info!
---
TBF Balanced landing goes well with head on even if you are exhausted(on certain maps)
---
Yeah but the stun would be longer than just baiting and breaking it only go for people who wait by the pallet of you‚Äôre really sure you‚Äôre gonna hit
---
Monto and noob3
---
But he's also notorious for camping.
---
If you are being looped, accept they are better at mindgaming you. That's all looping is. Mind games.
---
Usually in a SWF they have 1 person good at looping. Ignorw them and go for the easy meat. Ya'll are acting like people shouldn't want to survive. Looping is a legit strat.

Why does he look like an absolute unit?

If he was good they wouldn't have planned a buff as major as baking in one of his rare add ons into his base kit.

Everyone be saying pennywise and jack Torrice but the god of the lost would be awesome for this game.

its the alien facehugger cuz we're gonna get teh alien eventually. though if they wanna attract fans of other properties, maybe theyd add a monster from game of thrones or walking dead or toy story

I sense toxicity coming from that. Neon Feng and Nea are gonna have a 3rd for their sweaty SWF team.

Really like Billy,who takes no time to learn...

Free weekends are hilarious, I played 4 games, 3 as a Trapper and 1 as Spirit on rank 15-14, and to discrepancy between ranks is staggering, from rank 20 to rank 10.
---
The lobbies are fucking broken on ps4 and even when you finally get the squad together, you‚Äôre being split up for no reason (plus you get rank 20 killers even though all of you are rank 10 or below and honestly while ‚Äúbullying ‚Äú is a bit ‚Äúfun‚Äù ,you‚Äôre just making the new kids experience horrible and in the end you don‚Äôt even get much bloodpoints out of it so it‚Äôs kind of a lose lose situation )
---
1. If they aren't on a gen, they can't work on it for 16 seconds.
---
2. You can hide behind a gen and be invisible to BBQ.
---
3. Surveillance let's you know *exactly* when they hop on the gen, without having to check.
---
Blushing hag üòÅ
---
Why the obnoxious thumbnail?
---
Literally broken lobby loading. Even a few months ago, a bug would sometimes prevent a 4th person from joining a lobby.
---
Although back when the game was new, Survivor queues took forever because nobody wanted to get bullied.
---
To catch the viewers eye I guess?
---
How is puppers toxic??
---
borrowed time has never been anti-camping, it's anti-tunneling i guess- but if you unhook while they're camping you'll likely just trade with the person you just unhooked
---
you can't do anything about camping- the only thing you can do is have kindred so everyone knows if the killer is camping so they can keep doing generators instead
---
That was like 4 months ago. Surprised he still hasn't finished editing it.
---
Sounds like things are sweaty out there if people are pulling Spirit on DLC noobs.
---
Good. If there are still 4 survivors alive and theyre tbagging at the exit gates, i force quit every single time so no one gets points.

Nope ... maybe on Garry's Mod but port an model from Garry's Mod to SFM is just boring because rigs are REALLY bad. But i will keep watching if i see that !
---
ps4 gang. Are you a new player that came for Stranger Things?
---
You must not be using Billy right if he‚Äôs easy. Getting chainsaw downs at high ranks is actually difficult and requires a good amount of skill along with his other mindgames. Nurse, Spirit. Huntress, Hag, Demo all of them require more time to get good at than your average killer.
---
?
---
I mean freddy doesnt have a terror radius once survivors are asleep so no terror radius = no borrowed time its a logical change but not a needed one
---
true dat yo. i didnt realize it was just for demogorgon but makes sense since i was playing as him all day yesterday
---
EaterOfTacos123
---
Watch them make you pay for lore
---
Maybe the unhooked should see the killer, leave no scratch marks, and get a 150% boost for 2-4 seconds?
---
Physician, heal thyself.
---
...
---
Oh shit he actually did it.
---
Shit my bad it was gmod. Then again i figured since gmod models look shit and yours look way better even for sfm standards
---
Uh no, its way better than self care, its not affected by things such as sloppy butcher and rewards you for doing an objective, self care is an awful perk.
---
That's two cosmetics, though. Not

$25 for one outfit. The Meg mask comes with purchasing Deathgarden, which was $30 at the time.
---
oof thanks i‚Äôll definitely try it out
---
What a mind-breaker
---
Eh, I‚Äôve seen stranger things happen.
---
... fuck.
---
Looks like bloodyface from AHS
---
Definitely not top tier, maybe once they fix his lunge he could be a contender, but he's not too difficult to loop at the moment, especially compared to actual top tier killers.
---
Checkem
---
Still 15 just for 1 of the outfits so still more than 10 bucks for ahoy. Amateurs.
---
This post has been given the N O seal of approval from me. Bad post &gt;:c

Pretty much.
---
The shadow people haunt me.
---
hey look it's George Memeulous
---
If you want a killer to do kyf with to practice im open to doing that
---
You haven't seen the generic knife changes for ghostface, that change the handle colour,a handle that is covered by his hand
---
Well...it's not like they're good writers, anyway. I'm just hoping the lore progresses enough that we get an Entity Killer.
---
No, Patrick, Nea is not a Killer.
---
YES
---
You're doing the Demogorgon?
---
C‚Äômon, cut her some slack. She‚Äôs just a baby Claudette. I mean, she didn‚Äôt even think to turn around to see an insidious Trapper right behind her.
---
You should switch to Identity V.

I saw another screenshot a month or so ago with similar shit, like a rank 20 killer with 4 rank 1's.

I play both survivor and killer and I don't really mind the amount of pallets, as most of them are unsafe and easy to mindgame. The second floor is even more dangerous.
---
Generators and totems are hard to find. 
---
I don't really like indoor maps, but I don't think it's as survivor sided as you say.
---
too much ramen noodles and fried chicken my friend
---
Gym
---
Entiti
---
Wait, they set traps, then stand there to scare people away?
---
Because nobody EXPECTS traps around a hook. I've gotten a few salty picks with those. By not being in the area.
---
New killers,
---
You WILL have games where people are being rough as fuck, it's like having four bullies fucking with your head, just disconnect after the match is over, you're not obligated to stay for chat.
---
You WILL be called a camper and a tunneler and some will tell you that they'll report you, neither one are a bannable offense.
---
You WILL be teabagged often, just play through it it's not worth getting upset over there are other matches where you'll have a great game.
---
Me either I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh when I saw it. I feel like there‚Äôs usually at least one person close to my rank and even then the rest would be green or purple.
---
I only spent like $5 on the Meg mask when they did a DBD/DG bundle since they gave the discount for already owning DBD.
---
Well i always have fun playing him, i dont know if the survivors have so much Fun tho
---
Predator is where they got the idea of the neon orange scratch marks the killers see when survivors run.
---
I mean, it only ruins one players fun if you choose not to fucking sprint downstairs into his open arms
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound dumb but I don‚Äôt know what this means lmao I‚Äôm not that nooby I promise
---
Meesa poor
---
I‚ÄôVE ONLY HAD FUCKING LERYS AND CORN MAPS SINCE LAUNCH. NO GRASS TO SPEAK OF. I REALLY MISS MY GEN SLOWDOWN PERKS BUT I HAVEN‚ÄôT GOTTEN ANY YET.
---
Bruh that is honestly the dumbest thing ive heard. If u expected them to release a dlc where they had to make new models, new animations, get the rights to the characters, get the rights for the actors likeness etc for just 5 dollars ur honestly stupid. While they may just be cosmetics there is still alot of shit that goes into them. And if u really feel that way just buy the killer. Ur paying for a killer two new survivors nine new perks in total and ur also paying the company‚Äôs and the ppl thet worked on the dlc. So in turn it makes sense for this dlc to be more pricey.
---
It could be due to the new survivor perks. Survivors spend less time healing each other and can heal themselves more. Translates into more time spent on gens for the team overall.
---
I still find that crazy. I live on the east coast and I have a hard time believing there's literally no one else in the world to match up with me when I get these types of matches.
---
That's called proxy camping and frowned upon, but it's really just about moderation. If you can cover a gen or two without being an unchasable distance from the hook, let their team commit to a gen on the other side of the map and risk 3genning if they insist upon it. It can be a worthy trade as long as you're doing something and not crippling yourself by being right at the hook.
---
Otz is a complete gift to both the Dark souls and DbD communities. Such a great lad
---
Not even about being poor. It's everyone using all my money to do everything in the fucking house.
---
Gets really tiring, especially when I say "Make sure I have 15 dollars at least
---
Yeah, I wish it was the same. Demogorgon has a boring chase theme when you‚Äôre playing as him.
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
I just watched this twice, waiting for something epic to happen, like a key hatch escape with BT or something, maybe the video didn't load completely I thought... 
---
Yes, it took me that long to realize that Bubba was stuck behind the hook there. :D
---
I don‚Äôt use self care but I can tell you people are going to realize this later.
---
Self care sucks but is still way better. Why?
---
-you don‚Äôt have to spend time looking for a totem then get to a locker, then wait.
---
- you can heal anywhere at any time
---
-there‚Äôs 5 totems and 4 teammates running inner strength....then what.
---
-you go against a plague...
---
Self care is indeed better but wastes less time.
---
Regardless I will never run either, I‚Äôm not a scared little bitch, I‚Äôll do gens injured.
---
Hope I didn't come across as a dick. With reddit formatting you have to press enter twice for it to be on a new line in the actual post BTW.
---
How would it reveal you? If anything, it‚Äôll make you harder to see since it is dark gray.
---
JUST move to a different country 4Head. JUST move house 4Head
---
I guess where it gets toxic is that if you're good enough, you'll never reach a point where you benefit from camping, much like NOED, hence those tactics are frowned upon.
---
Though realistically, you can't expect everyone to be good enough in a game with terrible matchmaking, Survivor advantage, and players who have thousands of hours.
---
Then you‚Äôre a bad killer lol. You see a teammate nearby trying to pull you away from the hook? It‚Äôs because there‚Äôs obviously someone else nearby. gate open with no kills? Why not. Some guy was teabagging and generally BMing? Heck yeah. 
---
Stop being salty and just let killers play without all these dumbass made up rules that survivors make.
---
I really though that was a PTB bug when I first saw it lol. I wonder why they don't.
---
You get rewarded in bloodpoints, but as far as ranking goes you need to have a good challenging game to pip.
---
Myers is not a great ranking up killer as his points are aimed at rank 20-15.
---
HERE FOR IT
---
Make Your Choice is a Pig teachable. You're telling noobs to buy another character and level them up to like 40. They're still in the threat zone of ragequitting already.
---
Nea: Why would a Meg do that?
---
Bill:  Well, because she thought it was good sport. Because some Megs aren't looking for anything logical, like Rank, bloodpoints, or survival. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some Megs just want to watch the world burn.
---
Many people don't know this, but there is a hidden button that prevents your from getting hooked. They tried to hide it in the corner of the menu, but I found it regardless.
---
You can thank Fortnite and Fortnite players for skins that doesn't change anything to cost a ridiculous price.
---
Weird how both killers and survs are saying it's the "Worst map" for them.
---
I think it's fine from both sides. There are a lot of gens with highground to make quick escapes but there's also a real lack of loops. Quite alot of pallets though.
---
You ain't getting me with that noob shit but that doesn't help all the baysurvivors in this game that can and will fall for that.  It's just an incredibly lame and skilless way to depip, earn shit bloodpoints and piss players off.
---
It's all good dude.
---
The Huntress has the ability to throw hatchets from a distance, so taking a moment to drop a pallet in between you and her leaves you open for a good hatchet to the face.
---
I don't see a problem with that since they're supposed to be seen.
---
The mori is being covered in slobbery kisses XD
---
Yes...let the hate flow THROUGH you...but while you feed your rage, your gens are forfeit in the process.
---
Look it's not my fault that two of you came for the save, and then proceeded to unhook their teammate wit me just standing there... /s
---
But seriously, dont farm(unhooking a survivor just for them to be left in a bad spot *immediately* either. Unless you have borrowed time or you know they have DS, it's just a bad idea. And if two of you end up trying for the save, that's 75% of your team injured and all in the same area.
---
I played the map for the first time earlier and I think it looks amazing but someone got hooked upstairs and I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get to them. I kept running into dead ends. Sorry, bro! My intentions were good!
---
Is that...fun, or are you like, some kind of hate-slug?
---
Gal, and I'm aware.
---
My point stands.
---
Treats and headpats
---
Spirit and Demogorgon are the scariest to me.
---
I guess I understand this point now. The other day I got real salty at a Spirit in postgame chat because they camped me at the hook. They already had 1 kill, but it snowballed into a 4k because my other 2 teammates tried to save me.
---
I think it was their approach to it that I didn't understand. They said "every killer face camps when gates are open lol", which...I have not encountered very often. They usually go for the other teammates before they can leave. It seems like a terrible strategy, but I guess it worked, because they got the 4k. /shrug 
---
I was also annoyed since they only got that first kill by tunnelling the shit out of a teammate early in the game.
---
Oh that's awesome! I really like playing him and I thought it was weird that the thing called shred couldn't shred through wood haha, any ideas what they're going to replace it with?
---
Nea
---
Don't forget to point at the guy who made the gen explode during that time
---
It makes me sad that Meg has that rep because she‚Äôs my favorite one to play.
---
Bitter Murmur is pretty much dead now, right? Maybe making that passive would be more reasonable.
---
Although Whispers is always great, and not tied to a paywall.
---
Spirit is up there for me as well. Seeing her in the distance twitching about and then she‚Äôs suddenly on your backside. Looping her becomes much more dangerous than with other killers if she‚Äôs controlled by a good player.
---
&gt;just get ready for the trolling and teabags
---
Regular player been playing demogorgon for a while now, been tea bagged, body blocked, palleted, sworn at, taunted, ect.

Holy fuck man, it just never ends.

---
I had a faced a Ghostface on Lery's while 3 people were running Spine Chill including myself. Because of that, the Ghostface made the excuse of why he only got 1 kill (and the survivor with no Spine Chill was the kill). He said, "A SWF group of course you guys would tell each other I was coming." But we were all solo.
---
on PS4, the regular theme music plays and not the stranger things version. is this happening to anyone else?
---
To be fair, there is an add on that makes it impossible for the obsession to wake up but considering it‚Äôs ultra rare I think it balances out
---
There‚Äôs also a bug at the moment where survivors can see Hag‚Äôs trap auras, so it might be worth avoiding her until that‚Äôs fixed.

---
Lol it's not a rant. There's some actual good advice here for new players on how to be a better killer and not piss off everyone in the process.
---
A lotta people seem to forget it's a game. If I'm playing killer, I want the survivors to feel like they had a fighting chance and enjoy the game.
---
That bitch is pbbly at the other side of the map by the time u can start repairing again
---
You‚Äôve judged the map in a timeframe of a day of it coming out. Give it time for you to learn the map and the killer for it before sticking it with a bad rep.
---
You kill one *survivor*

Nah. Be patient with those loops. I've looped killers just fine on them. The game needs more small loops, not safe ones.
---
Also Balanced Landing on this map is very strong. But not everyone runs it.
---
Yes, it was on the patch note. Whether you live or die, you get points for being the obsession.
---
Are you dumb? 99% of the pallets are dogshit. Generators are hard to find, easy to patrol, same as totems.
---
This map is completely killer sided.
---
i have both xbox and pc but i was playing on xbox lol
---
1. Keeping then seperated can work for picking them off.
---
2. Its only on gens. Survivor coming over hop off gen. Run for 3 seconds. Exposed gone.
---
3. This is based off survivors as that it what ur literally hiding as.
---
Free week
---
As killer it is me hearing lockers slam shut and finding a survivor inside that just healed to full. Be quieter locker using people.
---
To be fair you can p3 a character without playing then a single time.
---
It's pretty good for stealth lol
---
I run ruin, BBQ, Make your choice, and PGTW. Basically, my build revolves around teleporting either to kick gens after hooking, chase survivors after hooking, or using MYC after an unhook.
---
Interesting idea of tinkerer, I‚Äôll have to try it out.
---
I stopped playing killer for 3 months so my rank go way back just so I could enjoy feeling like the survivors are actually afraid of me, best time I‚Äôve had as killer in a long time. Red ranks suck.
---
If you don‚Äôt play the game normally how are they gonna learn things? As long as you don‚Äôt camp or tunnel id say you‚Äôre gonna be fine

Same, I'm Noggin 17 on xbox
---
it will never be as vapid as I could imagine
---
First off, I already said I was a bad killer, and even I do better than campers. If you're fine with bad players being bad then keep that to yourself; I don't understand what's wrong with players sharing knowledge instead of everyone having a bad time.
---
Groovy
---
*smooch*
---
Then draw it yourself? Or just use I M A G I N A T I O N
---
I mean if you were halfway decent at the game you would rank up enough to not be playing with rank 20‚Äôs. Everyone is new once, give them time to learn before you start to bitch.
---
Head On is good for coordination with other players through direct communication or being able to read other survivors well. Me and a Quentin both had and I could tell he did by him using Quick and Quiet. We both jumped in lockers when we knew the killer was coming and I stunned him first then lead the killer to his locker and boom, 2 Head On stuns. 
---
Of course this is the fun part of the perk. The time Head On really saves you is in the basement as well as having Decisive Strike and/or Inner Strength.
---
I once ran into a basement Leatherface and I was running Head On, Quick and Quiet, Up The Ante, and Slippery Meat. I ended up unhooking myself then jumping into a locker. He came down and checked and I end up stunning him and getting out. 
---
Sadly that game I had survivors that all got hooked in the basement 2 minutes after.

Before I had BBQ and chili I used rancor and yeah, its funny how much rancor angers survivors. I liked it though. I used it with save the best for last and basically ignored the obession, maybe just chasing them off a gen while patrolling, focus on the other three, then if the gens get completed I just mori their ass.

Well seemingly both the hag and wraith refused to kill until the entity tortured them into submission. Hence the hags appearance and the wraiths blank stare. They aren't exactly relishing in the suffering, they just are the entity's tools now instead of themselves

That's how I've always seen it, just thought this was a funny edit to make after it happened.
---
what do you think killer means? YOU HAVE TO HOOK THEM TO RANK UP AND GET BLOODPOINTS
---
It's far from competitive. If you go to rank 1-3 you will get really good killers but if you are able to get to a rank you will be able to win in those ranks. And yeah there are 5 more killers now.
---
And there is this new thing called 'End game collapse' idk if you already know but if there is only 1 person left the hatch will spawn no matter how many gens are done but the killer can close it, when the killer closes the hatch EGC (End game collapse) starts and it's a 2 minute timer so if the survivor doesn't escape in those 2 minutes they will die.
---
But if there are more survivors left the only way to begin EGC is to open a gate (the killer can open gates too, but only when all gens are done and there is no gate open yet) this is to prevent survivors to stay in the game for 10 minutes.
---
It changes my direction
---
If she is used in the right hands she can also negate loops and delete infinites from existence.
---
I remember seeing adds for a ‚Äúspring blade‚Äù replica in a ‚ÄúBud-k‚Äù catalogue a long time ago, they also had an rc billy doll, double layered predator masks and other horror stuff. Later on that year was the first time I saw assassins creed being played, I‚Äôm pretty sure that the hidden blade in saw was actually a wide flat blade as opposed to a long knife because the replica was huge.

It's insane how it hasn't been fixed yet. Most of the time it does work as intended but you get these moments where it just fucks you

Thats it, when you hit red ranks and stay there for a while, sometimes it feels like a chore, I enjoy the feeling of just absolutely obliterating some SWF flashlight Claudette‚Äôs ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
As will I.
---
I see you play the game while making your own horror story up for each match like me :).  
---
In my head she didnt let me live because Bill threw his life away for a noble reason at the end of L4D and she can't think of a way that's actually a bad thing so she just killed him out of fustration.
---
It amazing, looks stunning as well
---
It's an artistic representation of the Entity, it depicts her grasping claws that come down when you are sacrificed.
---
Just like you can easily counter Adrenaline by scouting gens better. Doesn't mean it's easy. You go find totems? You aren't doing the objective which is making the killer's job easier. It also means that you have to trust your teammates to do something. Not a very good idea considering all the noobs that you'll most likely encounter as of now. You're basically saying "Don't do the objective. Worry about totems in the hopes that you can stop a killer from potentially using Noed and one -shotting you. Trust your teammates who are will probably be noobs 9/10 times." Stupid idea.
---
Nice slow vault bro

You can still pip at purple ranks by not killing anyone but it‚Äôs hard. So long as you get Iridescent in the other 3 categories and Bronze in Sacrifice you‚Äôll pip, don‚Äôt even need to 2 hook everyone.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm not sure how that was a slow vault

She‚Äôs like a real woman, you gotta rub her the right way. I see you like ghostface so I‚Äôm warning you she‚Äôs not as good as him at downing survivors, but she‚Äôs fun as hell and nearly impossible to predict if you get good at using her crouch and dash during chases
---
Yeah the hitbox needs to get a fix very soon because it feels so small. And the pallet breaking thing is also something that should have been there since the start.
---
Boring? More alike haunting yo. I get creeped out from said chase theme.
---
I thought u were supporting these ppl, I guess you are reasonable, tbh idek why I bother with noed, I don't even use it in most cases, I got BBQ and chili from the bloodweb so imma use that instead, thank u for being reasonable
---
I sense bait
---
Everytime theres a hit: "LAMB SAAAAAAUCE"
---
Same shit with XBOX.
---
I‚Äôm kinda new but I know how to do everything on ps4 tell me if y‚Äôall want to play btw I‚Äôm 13 if that kind of stuff matters to u
---
There is a Twitch streamer named HybridPanda who puts out these great YouTube videos called Shrine Watch. I‚Äôve been playing almost a full year now, and he has taught me how to be a Killer main. There are literally 10x more Bloodpoints per game when you‚Äôre a semi-decent killer.
---
You brought up over 7 perks because someone complained about 1. You also brought up windows and pallets. Wow.
---
I don't get it and I was seeing that he was OP before release. I watched Monto, Ortz, and Noob3 play as it. It came off as being a fun, powerful killer upon their impressions.
---
But it hasn't "clicked" for me yet. Other killers I can pick up, play with, figure out, and something "clicks" in my head and I know how to pressure and control the map. 
---
This guy comes off weak, to me. The survivors don't seem "scared" of it than others I play as. The portals are easily destroyed whereas Freddy can manage to control the gens to keep his power. It seems so easy to punish the killer. Hopefully it clicks over for me
---
You clean bones. Period.
---
Oh I was aware of her big disadvantages, that's the reason I play Ghosty but not her. That's actually good to know though because I've been wanting to play her
---
Well it looks like you‚Äôre enjoying it so far. This game‚Äôs a little tough on beginners, but once you start to get perks and characters and all that, the game can either get a lot more fun or a lot more of a debilitating and toxic experience that can diminish your urge to play the game. Just stay wholesome, and it‚Äôll be alright :)
---

I hate her height anyway, but she‚Äôs my main source of xp as her BBQ is max and I only have ruin on Demogorgon and her but no BBQ on Demo yet.

Chase them, hook them all twice, kick gems, get survivors to drop pallets to break them.  Do not get caught in a long chase with the all star looper.  Literally just walk away if they are a loop god.  
---
Even in bad matches anything under 20k BP is pretty rare.  
---
After two hooks hit them but don‚Äôt slug them.  It wastes everyone‚Äôs time.  
---
The only time I don‚Äôt score big points is when it‚Äôs a 5 minute match or I decide to follow the loop god across a bad mad layout.
---
I‚Äôve played pretty strict friendly killer with certain exceptions for over a year.
---
Pay attention to which categories you aren‚Äôt hitting 8k BP in.  This will likely show you the issue.
---
They added a new endgame to prevent survivors from bullying the killer in the exit gates and get rid of hatch standoffs.
---
They release new chapters every three months (usually a killer and a survivor, sometimes just a killer or survivor but the Stranger Things chapter has two survivors). If you stopped playing after the clown's release they released five killers since then (the spirit, the legion, the plague, the ghostface and the demogorgon)
---
If you're starting again now your rank will be back down to 20 so the game should match you with inexperienced players.
---
Rancor

When i do that the player runs turns and runs.

My first impression of DBD was: "HOLYSHITFUCKHELLICANTLIVE2MINUTESBEFOREIFUCKINGDIE".  I didn't feel I would ever survive a trial.   Got steamrolled for a week solid before I even opened an exit gate.  Didn't play any swf, I didn't care about bloodpoints, I just wanted to get out of that gate once.

If a sequel to this had a single player with different levels and a campaign, then this would be like the greatest horror franchise ever.

Had a match where I spawned in and went straight to my hex.  It was out in the open next to a gen.  There was someone working on it and two other people doing the gen 10 feet from it.

This was 10-15 seconds into the match.

Hmm, that's very weird. Someone on this subreddit actually told me that the users of this subreddit don't have enough faith in these devs so it's a big shocker üò± to me that I'm hearing your friend is encountering a bug. Very, very weird that.
---
I never wait very long on ps4, except for maybe like 3 am on a Tuesday or something, otherwise its usually pretty quick.
---
Also you will probably feel the urge to tunnel survivors with a rbt on but it‚Äôs way more efficient to let them search while you chase others,

---
This is cool but looks like a design class assignment/exercise. In my design classes, we would tack them up at the front of the class and receive critique from others. So, my critique: the generator in the body is distracting and hard to make out and the background feels empty. I would try moving the gen to the bg solving both issues.
---
If you want a slow beginning then I‚Äôd recommend corrupt intervention instead. It allows you to only worry about the gens bear you for a bit. Cruel limits and tinkerer sound good in concept but....
---
Survivors if they see your portal and you teleporting are going to run away or seal it.... and tinkerer‚Äôs effect beyond notifying you is useless as the demogorgon has the ‚Äúundetected‚Äù status effect while teleporting and coming out of teleporting. So you‚Äôre never going to be able to teleport at all or not going to make use of your perk slot...
---
That‚Äôs just my opinion though
---
The only thing to make it worse are mirrors on every wall
---
If it can happen it means we‚Äôre doing something wrong imo, there shouldn‚Äôt be bugs that are find that obviously in game, like, maybe this super ultra specific bug that only triggers once a full moon, then yeah, I get it, but bugs that happen so often everyone knows about them by now? Nahhh.
---
I'd assume it means we get to kill people, but we really can't even do that without a mori, some perks, or add-ons for some characters.
---
That one kid who all the girls have a crush on but he‚Äôs low key a little jerk and even the teacher secretly hates him.
---
Commit to the gen!  Unless I hear the nurse charge up her blink right when I miss. Then I slowly walk away until I see if shes incoming.
---
Which would be absolutely useless because it's not actual gameplay so people can just upload footage or text from the game to either YouTube, dbd wiki or for example reddit. Lore will not sell unless they reward you with cosmetics or anything that actually improves the game
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that she‚Äôs worse than Trapper, but she isn‚Äôt as effective at shutting down key loops as bear traps. Granted, in the right hands or with the right conditions, the difference is at maximum 1% less effective, but the right hands requires extensive play, and the right conditions are rarer.
---
She‚Äôs worth it if you don‚Äôt enjoy using Spirit, and can excel indoors, especially on cramped maps where a single range add-on makes her oppressive as all hell, and can shatter loops like glass.
---
That's your fault for not timing it
---
GODDAMMIT I HATE MY OWN TEAMMATES SO MUCH MOST GAMES.

I'M SO FUCKING USED TO BEING FARMED OFF THE GODDAMN HOOK WITHOUT BORROWED TIME THAT I LEGIT DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT WHEN I ACTUALLY DO GET IT.

ALSO GOT IN A MATCH WITH A FUCKING MEG AND WE STARTED IN THE KILLER SHACK.  SHE DROPPED THE FUCKING GOD PALLET IMMEDIATELY.   IT WAS HER FIRST FUCKING ACTION IN THE GAME.  WHEN I LEFT, SHE WAS JUST SLIDING ACROSS IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
---
AND JUST TODAY, I HAD A FUCKER WATCH ME WHILE I WAS ON THE HOOK.  HE WAS CROUCHED 3 FEET AWAY BEHIND A TREE AND WAITED UNTIL I WAS IN THE STRUGGLE PHASE TO PULL ME OFF.  THE KILLER WAS NOWHERE AROUND.  IN FACT, THIS FUCKING GUY DIDN'T PULL ME OFF UNTIL THE KILLER HAD DOWNED AND HOOKED SOMEONE ELSE.
---
lmao right? im for ps4 gang tho

Exactly, you can only take so much bm before ya gotta roll back and vent those frustrations
---
-New mechanic are
---
:EndGame Collapse, now theres no hatch stand off, who ever gets to it first gets it (killer can close the hatch, survivor can jump immediatly since the killer cant grab survivor from jumping anymore)
---
Theres a timer after you close the hatch or the gates are opened so survivors have to get out as soon as they can (although not so alarming), When the timer runs our the entity fucks them up.
---
:Dying light is crashing the game at the moment (atleast on ps4) so dont use it

-It gets more competitive the higher rank you go, in the low ranks its easy (unless its rank reset). Once you get to higher ranks you have to step up your game since generators fly like mofos.
---
That's for you emblem points.  Your BP score is detached from your emblem score.  Emblem score is what ranks you up.
---
An entity killer? The entity is the 'God of dbd', survivors are killed for his pleasure. We will not see an entity killer because why would he enter his own torture rooms to do these trials he created himself. Maybe we will see a more detailed version of its appearance instead of the claws we see in game.
---
Its your first game man, did you expect to just immediately stomp everyone? 
---
Looks like you got unlucky with the matchmaking. At rank 18 you shouldnt be getting green rank survivors, let alone 4 of them. 
---
Take your licks and work on improving. You'll get em next time.

Pretty much my experience with both trapper and hag. Like, can you not just sprint straight to a hook and throw the whole game?

I personally found S3 to be the weakest. I still think it's an amazing show, and better than most other shows I've consumed, but when compared to S1 and S2, I find it the weakest.
---
I don't know if it's because I feel like I've "found the rhythm" of how the show works, or if because I feel like there's too much plot armor happening for our major characters (Quick sidebar, I don't think [certain character] died because the death wasn't shown, and because of the after credit scene). I do also feel like some of the comedic timing felt a little bit off in some parts, but I can't bring a specific scene to mind at this moment.
---
That said, the 80s feel was so so good, the chemistry is perfect, and overall I'm glad I marathoned all three seasons in like, four days when I heard about it being added to dbd.
---
I JUST WANT A PONYTAIL AND NICE JACKET BHVR PLS WE ARE LITERALLY BEGGING TO GIVE YOU MONEY
---
One tip based on something you said: you can tell when survivors start destroying your tunnels. If someone does, teleport to it (or walk if close) and that survivor will not be able to hear your terror radius. It can usually be a free hit and saves your tunnel from being removed.
---
Self care is the best killer perk
---
Thats disappointing to hear, thank you
---
They should, and they will, but if *nobody* brings an obsession perk you're suddenly in huge trouble because the killer knows they don't have to worry about it.
---
I agree
---
I haven't touched it since the rework. Seems pointless now.
---
Love people that self care, they slow the game for you.
---
What about SWF but the load in separate because servers or someone's connection, etc?
---
Me as Demogorgon just now
---
Double post btw
---
It's literally their job. Killers shouldn't get punished for mistakes made by your teammate.
---
Yes back when the game first came out you could sit in a Killer lobby for... ever. The lobbies would glitch where no one could find it. You wouldn't realize it until you wasted 20+ minutes waiting.
---
Sad pig noise

Maybe a purple add on removes his red stain, like ‚Äúprototype serum‚Äù
---
I wanna see that too
---
A survivor dc'ing when the game isn't going their way? Wow! So surprising!
---
Oh man this is brutal
---
‚ÄúThis sub claims the reddit isn't toxic its just the people in the game‚Äù iv never actually seen that and it made me laugh, this sub is by far more toxic than people in game
---
All the pallets are unsafe though, so it‚Äôs more killer sided
---
Not as bad as when I got reported for teaming with a random survivor and I didn't know what he reported me for until the guy I was supposedly working with sent me a message
---
I see it on pretty much every baby dwight thread.
---
Lucky
---
Just play the game normally,  you'll get 20k minimum per game, 40k if you you hook a few people with bbq,  you must have high standards for BP gains
---
As a survivor main I'll take rancor over mori any day of the week but I've known a lot of toxic survivors to give killers abuse for using rancor lol
---
I just played a game as killer where to Megs hid in the basement lockers... found them because of crows. It was embarrassing
---
D/C'ing because the killer plays like a cunt? So surprising.
---
Looping is godlike if you have unbalanced landing, it's still an ugly and cluttered map though
---
It's their job to sit in front of the hook? And go after one person to ruin the game? If gens are getting done and killer is camping the survivors should try and give that person a chance. It's the survivors job to do gens and aid the teammates as well and they get punished for "gen rushing" and unsafe unhooking when the killer is sitting in front of the hooked survivor. So dont come at me with that classic excuse. "Its their job to kill" ya and survivors have jobs that they get severely punished for as well.
---
He is pretty ass, he gets looped so easily.
---
Yeah it gave everyone the masks for that weekend, but after that it revokes them from your account if you don't own the game in case that wasn't clear. I had the same happen to me.
---
Because unsafe unhooks are the reason why killers tunnel off the hook? If you make a dumb play I'm  punish it
---
Yeah the add-ons on the whole are rather lame and mostly useless
---
The whole game is fine as it is... didn't see a bug in months ..
---
I was dared to say the "N" word, in post chat, but all I said was GG, and XD.
---
They then went on a rant about how I would have let them all live if they were not playing Claudette, and how I am going to be reported for racism.
---
Out of nowhere. Survivors are scary.
---
Mkay bud
---
***FUCKING PREACH BROTHA***
---
YES PLEASE THIS SKIN WOULD BE SO GOOD
---
they gave Kate ice picks so they could strap the baseball bat on her back or something just ughhh please we want it
---
You will literally depip as survivor for doing only gens and totems...which is the survivors job. So by your logic and argument of the killer getting rewarding for hooking and drowning survivors then survivors should be rewarded for doing only gens and escaping but they get minimal.bloodpoints and depip.
---
While that is technically true. If the killer is camping and the survivors "gen rush" i.e. do their primary objective they get minimal bloodpoints and will depip even though they did their jobs perfectly.
---
Should have used the Demogorgon skin in Fortnite.
---
The lore of a game is that the killer and survivor are trapped within the entity
---
She feeds off of the emotions of hope and fear. By all standards of the lore, if you kill all the survivors instantly without playing with your food, yes, you're doing it wrong.
---
Get some good head phones
---
OK I'll try to edit it if I can
---
Oh snap I didn't see that! I'll go upvote it as well!

Yepp. I can have a fun game then survivor chat just pisses me off accusing me of whatever they felt I did. It‚Äôs fun man. Lol.

Ye, I was a bit bummed by BHVR once again doing a, in my eyes, half-assed job by pinning something as an official guide, without actually fine-combing it before. It's just another issue of unprofessionality, similar to the "Well, then just go play Civ VI or something" thing that I'm still fairly pissed about.
---
They have a solid game concept and, after many other games (such as Evolve) failed, the community to actually support it for years... and then you have such obvious incompetence. It's frustrating to me.
---
Haha  one of my accounts on Xbox is my name on here but with a space
---
Their the turtle beach elite 800x, so idk how much better I can get for ps4 other than a mic
---
Downvote for the repost and also phone recording
---
Gen rushing is also a made up word. It is simply doing the objective effectively. If a killer is just sitting in front of the hook and camping then they are punished by being rewarded less points. If all survivors start doing gens when they realized somebody is getting camped then by the time they die all the gens are done. If you try to be altruistic when a killer is camping you are not only feeding them easy points but you are also rewarding that particular playstyle.
---
If you 100% solo player, I STRONGLY recommend taking a "Bond" first (from A tier, Dwight's perk). This is a top-notch perk for all ranks. It will give you a TON's of information which helps you decide what to do and where you shouldn't go at this moment. Also, you can use it to find someone to heal you.
---
You can bait your portals, place them near gens and use them and after if you hold M2 you'll get a notification if any survivor is trying to seal them. Teleportation is prioritiesed so you can tp to that portal they are are trying to seal.
---
When I could get a game last night the frame rates were horrible after a couple of games. Currently can‚Äôt get into a match, get disconnected every time in loading screen.
---
Ok I will go for bond after I get adrenaline
---
Same goes for the killer if he either camps or downs all 4 survivors in 2 minutes and kills them all
---
Me as a survivor
---
Fair enough point. Sure they will somewhen find out. But especially since we're talking about something that could be considered 'bad behavior' and that's an issues that epidemic in the current gaming culture (as in, it's a rare event when you play a competitive multiplayer game and do NOT get insulted every other match), I feel like being overly cautious and pre-emptive is the only way to try re-educating gamers.
---
A single wanna-be-asshat, that doesn't figure out that camping is great for pissing off people, even if it lasts for a single day, might prevent a few players from being pissed off into reproducing that bad behavior... enough of a gain for me to be upset at the guide. And the professionals who should have watched out for that.
---
it still could be. they got these paragraph updates, full chapter updates, why not an addendum?  
---
it's quite polysyllabic and very languagey sounding too
---
The hashslingingslasher?
---
There is literally no easier way to explain this than through the logic of the game 
---
You are not supposed to win, you are not supposed to survive, while it's possible, the entity doesn't give a flying fuck either way, she's just tryna eat. 
---
For a killer, this entails that you chase the survivors, hook them, and generally play with your food, letting them get so close to escaping, but dashing their hopes at the last second. 
---
For a survivor, this is a fight for your life, but these are also people who are going to be returning to the campfire with you should they survive. Your ***job*** is surviving, the generators are something that stop that from happening. As such, by doing ***only*** the generators, you are fueling some of the emotions of hope, but the entity doesn't care so much for hope, it's like giving someone bepsi when they asked for Cronk. The entity wants you to have your hopes ruined, it wants you to feel the dread of knowing you're about to die. When you throw one of your own out of their "safe" haven ( obviously hooks aren't safe, but they are safe to the point where a killer can't further butcher them because the killers have to sacrifice ) and back into the killer's arms, this doesn't spark anything other than resentment. The entity doesn't give a fuck about resentment, it wants hope and fear. If you save someone far enough away from the killer, this gives both you and the survivor hope that you can get out, and once again that hope can be taken, and replaced with fear as the killer continues to stalk you down. 
---
When you give the entity resentment instead of its juicy fear and hope, it gets salty and decides you were being a bingus, as such it penalizes you for denying its only way to survive. 
---
It's why killers get penalized for schwacking survivors, it's why the entity really, really doesn't like tombstone Myers. It's why you don't get points for urban envisioning around the map and playing stealthily. It's why killers get penalized for using Mori's. It's why the entity brings in tortured and broken people, because it's easier to manipulate those people.
---
I don‚Äôt see it
---
One guy is trying to KILL you and the others trying to SURVIVE  
---
  
---
you do the math now.
---
Uhh ok?
---
It literally always does for me, and the post is asking what you do personally. And I find the hatch literally 9/10 times with running around the edges (not the very edge, but along it kind of)

So, (much like the Scream franchise), I've never been a big Halloween fan, but happy with how this turned out. I wanted to do something a little different with this one before I get into the clown re-design. I struggle pretty hard with the licensed killers, oddly, but I think this one came together.

**Next up**: Probably re-doing The Clown, but I have some good ideas for The Plague
---
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy. 
---
More of my work ca be found on my IG at: [@gopencyprep](https://www.instagram.com/gopencyprep/) give it a follow - especially if you like horror stuff, inktober is coming up.
---
I think there are apps to just change the icons
---
I don't think it matters wether a killer is original or liscensed. I think what does matter is if they are fun to play and well made. This post seems like it's just looking for something to complain about :P
---
Whys that
---
It‚Äôs a map add on
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
i watched the 3 seasons of ST because of the DLC :) it was good. i now get the references from the DLC's items and stuff lol
---
Welcome to Dead by Daylight, one of the broken games ever
---
Hes fun to face though
---
If you see one it means someone marked it.
---
Happened very often today with my mate
---
I gave a killer a gg recently after a 4K and he replied ‚Äúlol you call that trash good?‚Äù That shit goes both ways.
---
When Object of Obsession, Dance with Me and No Mither have a threesome.
---
his perk needs to be "if I'm not back in five minutes, call the pope."
---
Spirit is prob the most hated killer in the game right now. me and many others think she is way too easy to play. She is the 2nd strongest killer in the game and is one of the easiest to play. 
---
Her counter play is almost none existent, you NEED iron will to play against a good spirit or you will die, Unlike nurse where yes, she is stronger, but you dont need a perk to counter her 
---
Me and my friends all hate spirit bc she feels like she is Anti skill.
---
What's the problem with bringing up things in a discussion that are commonly brought up in the community as problems?
---
I'm not going to lie I may be like that simply cause I don't like playing against her and would like a short game so I can face a killer.
---
I don't like facing her just because she's boring, not cause I think she's OP or anything
---
So you're just lazy? :p
---
I literally never said that lol you‚Äôre just straw manning because someone disagreed with you. Sad state this sub is in.
---
I just did it on PC and I didn't get the achievement after I escaped either.
---
Sadly game wont improve until people will get bored of going against the same shit. So many stupid players that think the game is totally fine, while they play maybe 2 games a day and casually win by hiding the whole match and talk so much by literally copying anything streamers/youtubers say
---
Well you know in Dbd there is no form of practice or anything so the only way to learn is to jump right in, but it's hard to have fun and at least accept some losses when people sitting at the gates teabagging you and sending end game messages about how bad you are
---
you're probably not even in green ranks, demogorgon is tragically bad
---
Survivors get offended whenever killers mention gen-rush. For what reason ? Idk
---
That's crazy bullshit.. Hope they will change it.. tunneling Freddy ignoring the only perk against this, except maybe DS
---
It wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't hypocritical.
---
Meanwhile I had a game where I got 0 boldness since preform Freddy Tunneled my friends while I did 5 gens
---
I dont really agree with this statement, Of course a good player playing a low rank will do decent, but if that player put the time they did into the low rank into lets say Nurse. they would be doing much better.
---
Not too bad as he moves slower when he has it charged.
---
It was one game man and looking at your rank you're clearly new.  On top of that you had 1 single perk on him.  How did you expect it to go?  This game isn't about instant success as killer it's about learning the game at that point.  Unlock some more perks for him, play some more games and don't concern yourself with winning initially just work on improving your killer play.
---
*facecamping demo screenshot* 
---
And here we see the beautiful tale of demo the Gorgon, who refused to leave his master's side no matter what taunts people threw at him. Attacking any who got close, he granted his master eternal peace.
---
Um.. How do I get these???
---
Right?!  Like, there should be an option to say "no thanks" besides the constant not choosing of it.  Like on Pandora and I keep downvoting all Coldplay songs (no matter what channel I have created) but they keep throwing me Coldplay.  Like, please take the hint already?!
---
Rank 7 and there were 60-70% Demos since yesterday for me
---
It do be like that sometimes!
---
You passed on it 10 times. If you had just taken it three of those times it would stop showing up for certain giving you 7 chances to get the perk you want.
---
I agree.
---
It makes it so survivors can't numbly loop a strong pallet for a long time. It makes it so you just run until you are caught. (Unless you run balanced landing then you become a god on that map lol)
---
I personally really like this map's pallets as killer and survivor. Its mostly unsafe pallets and a handful of good ones. I'll need to play on it a lot more and learn the layouts to form a very solid opinion of it though.
---
Okay........ Nothing new obviously. You got a good amount of BP so it doesnt look like it reallyyy affected you. You just didnt get a 4k BFD
---
I havent played since reset this has nothing to do with just me?? I wouldn't wish this upon an actual green killer learning the game. You're defending something that shouldn't even be happening in the first place
---
People have no patience anymore
---
Better Together, Spine Chill, Prove Thyself, Resilience? Maybe change out one of these for Iron Will?
---
Whoa!
---
It may have been a latency issue. I can assure you his Shred is not THAT broken. I see demogorgons running into a lot of shit but it stuns them and they dont hit through it.
---
Survivors tend to bully the killer if they feel safe . Once they feel in danger and might loose the match survivors will stop act like hot shit.
---
The hero we need but don't deserve.
---
Right here chaps.
---
No. Suffer.
---
NICE
---
It's strategic! You wanted to put them closer / further from that one gen there ... yeah :P
---
You can have fun and get tilted in any game. You're also 1/5th of the game. 
---
It sounds like he plays to win easy; in which case, he needs to avoid any competitive game at all costs. No one is gonna coddle you
---
I love playing him can get 4ks alot IDC about tiers I care about if I'm good with him and is he fun to play both are yes and with upcoming hotfix it will be better. But if I were to put on tier list. A steady a A or B would do well IMO definitely not s though I would say about on par with Billy due to demo also able to be quick with lunges and portals plus you feel strong as both of them
---
I'm not defending it, I just dont get triggered by a multiplayer game where skill levels will obviously vary. What would you guys complain about if they remove ranks completely? I'm sure you would find something.
---
ah, yes
---
T R E E
---
If you truly want to be stealthy, Myers as Spine Chill won‚Äôt work when you are in Evil Within Tier I. He‚Äôs the only killer that bypasses just about every stealth perk survivors have until you up your Evil Within to Tier II or III.
---
I think it would be nice at least if they were really more random, there's like 10 spots any hex will be on any map and everyone knows where they are for the most part.
---
Thanks! I'll try it out when I can get all the perks üòÅ
---
Yeah I‚Äôm running dying light that would explain why it crashes thanks
---
What is that from, it looks so familiar
---
Ok. This works for both ways.
---
Except the cases were the killer is stupidly strong or easily "cheat" by abusing the Power (Legion when launched) or stupidly weak or power glitched or something (PTB Ghostface) you can't just decide if a killer is weak or strong after so little time after launch. He isn't going to be a new option for rank 1 killers, but he sure is a very fun killer to play in all ranks (probably except red ranks). 
---
Give it more time.
---
Only if we get a 2 towers map and a plane killer dammit. Equal opportunity I say!
---
Sometimes but rarely DBD cause it usually takes me ages to find a lobby.
---
No-one wants to watch a loading screen lol
---
OP talks about how there should be no problem with them using NOED and that people should stop complaining, but then they decide to bring up all the things that killers commonly complain about. No problem there right? They talked about survivors complaining about NOED like there's a problem and they defended killers using it. Where is that same defense for survivors with the things that killers complain about though? OP is a biased hypocrite.
---
Gonna be honest this chapters lore was disappointing.
---
To think we've went this long doing this and are only now getting dedicated servers makes me laugh.
---
You‚Äôre literally just making things up that I didn‚Äôt say and ignoring any points that I make. You‚Äôre not being constructive you‚Äôre just being flat out rude and toxic.
---
Christ I wish I could bottle the tears in this sub and make them into a fucking soda. Toxic is going out of your way to be an asshole, it's not winning. If anyone thinks toxic == winning they should stop playing. Anything. Ever.
---
Lmao, well, at least you also got a Trapper mask with it and some items on Deathgarden too.
---
One of the main reasons that made me purchase Deathgarden were the cosmetics though.
---
Didnt know there was a blink addon
---
Hey vsauce, michael here.
---
Average 3 skill checks per gen? Are we playing the same game? Come on now you sure you aren‚Äôt remembering wrong so that your buff ruin claim holds up? 3 skill checks per gen. You must be the luckiest mofo around.
---
Where were you when we got 4 original chapters and the gap between licensed content was even bigger?
---
Ash and Ghost Face are basically one chapter since Ash got released outside of the usual timeline, making Stranger things just the second licensed chapter since we took a break from 4 back to back original ones.
---
Second time in the last 24 hours I see someone complaining about this. Weird.
---
My guy still got a 2 k
---
Truly fascinating.
---
fair and ebony mori dont belong in the same sentence together

wait, Pig is decent and huntress is not?
---
I like how the T-bag just slightly moves the camera up and down.
---
How exactly would you learn playing against potatoes that run towards deadzones nonstop? This matchmaking is not even that bad to begin with.
---
What do you stream on? You seem entertaining
---
wahh the game wasn‚Äôt easy wahh take it on the chin and move on. It‚Äôs tough but it be like that.
---
r/angryupvote
---
IT'S BEEN SEVEN HOURS AND I'M ACTUALLY STILL FUCKING MAD ABOUT THIS. [WHY THE FUCK SHOULD THE GAME HAVE TO LOOK LIKE THIS](https://imgur.com/ujiSADT) JUST SO I CAN SEE MY AURAS ON EVERY GODDAMN MAP EXCEPT FOR GIDEON, WHICH FUCKING SUCKS ANYWAY
---
The moral, wake the fuck up!
---
Bro this isn‚Äôt true, the gens would all be done by the time the map loads even with corrupted
---
It's been like that every game since the update. I haven't had a game without at least 2 green ranks.
---
This has gotten worse since recent update. I am a level 17 survivor and I'm getting put into games with level 8 survivors etc and killer can be anywhere in between
---
Anything that is not default chase music makes me scared and I disagree
---
Ugh, whyyyyyyyyy
---
Tough
---
"The matchmaking isn't that bad" THEY ARE ALL GREEN RANKS. Are you blind?
---
Purple Flashlights. I'm happy to see flashlights as killer as they waste time attempting for flashlight saves they'll never get. Someone tried to do that pallet tech with me and a downed survivor and well, that ended up being an easy 4K.
---
I avoid survivor lobbies with 2 or 3 flashlights. Time wasters and basically the worst item unless playing against specific killers or killers that don't do proper flashlight counterplay. And I'm sure the killer won't play Hag if they see multiple flashlights.
---
Everyone has bad games, they can all be good sadly.
---
Yeah this map is pretty cancer and I don't enjoy playing it all. 
---
Tons of killers I've had today are slugging omega hard and it 100% benefits them on that map when chases are very short to begin with with the poorly placed pallets and awful loops. I also don't think I've been able to escape from that map once besides using a key.
---
I'm not saying that we should have strong pallets where chases can last for 3 gens, and despite how amazing the map looks, it feels very poorly designed overall.
---
Demogorgon?
---
So many people trying to get into lobbies (not that it‚Äôs necessarily a bad thing)
---
I've seen worse cases of matchmaking and the killer still gets a 4k. Don't be discouraged by rank. But do your best, learn, and try to have fun.
---
If you are really frustr just start farming with the survivors. It lowers the heat and benefits everyon
---
Read it again closely. 
---
Or I could just tell you: The misspelled the name of their new chapter. "STANGER".
---
I love it, favorite chase music in the game.
---
How I miss the days when this game was fresh to me. It was an experience I'll never forget.
---
&gt;"The matchmaking isn't that bad" THEY ARE ALL GREEN RANKS. Are you blind?
---
It isn't that bad. If you looked at this sub before adding another useless thread to the pile (which is against the rules btw), you'd see people playing against 4 red ranked survivors.
---
I‚Äôm enjoying these cursed offerings keep up the good work dude
---
Gg
---
Am I the only one who enjoy being low rank playing against high ranks? Not just dbd but any game. Idk I believe getting wrecked and own will make you a better player as you learn
---
You know there's missing sarcasm because it's over the internet, and then there's just willfully ignoring the context. I even put a lil /s there for ya.
---
I find him fun. He's not insanely powerful but isn't legion level bad.
---
Just wake up before you save
---
Man so much hate towards the TC. This is pretty bad for matchmaking for sure. Gray rank matched with all greens. Doesn't sound like a fun game when learning to play killer.
---
Free heal mid chase like adrenaline, it sounds good but it just doesn't work out everytime.
---
I saw the thumbnail and thought the demo's head was a penis for a hot sec.

I personally only prestige characters with no cosmetics as the only real reward for prestiging is cosmetics. Up to you though, but remember any bloodpoints you use on them past level 50 will be completely wasted if you prestige. So choose wisely if you chose not to
---
And here you are "crying" about someone's opinion so take your own advice next time
---
The game is not a killer sided map. So many of the pallets aren't even mindgamable and the area around the basement and above it can literally spawn 4 pallets that have no counterplay against anyone other than nurse, spirit, or hag. Combined with balanced landing, the game map is very survivor sided map against survivors who run with plan, i.e, not totally bot like.
---
That‚Äôs bound to happen. You just have to keep playing. It *will* get way easier, I assure you.
---
yeah but as survivor it takes me a full 10 minutes to find any lobby let alone one with good ping
---
also even after the battle pass expires you will still be able to unlock the lore bits you just won't get the timed exclusive rewards like cosmetics or whatever else they add to the tier progression portion.

So I'm poor for not wanting to pay for overpriced skins? Is that where you are getting at, Hibbsan?
---
Well he does act like quite the... *dickhead*
---
I'll see my way out
---
Could you elaborate on the loop breaking power? I don't use or see Trapper very often on PS4
---
Scoops. Scoops. Scoops. Scoops.
---
Long ago the Scoops Troop lived in harmony. 
---
Then everything changed when the Demogorgon attacked.
---
Fun, but sadly he‚Äôs mid tier, when shred kills pallets by default he‚Äôll be better.
---
Consoles can take screenshots too.
---
No it was a family video I believe
---
I wish.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about demogorgan, I‚Äôm talking about his perks, if you don‚Äôt have any valid input into the discussion don‚Äôt comment.
---
Same with Legion as their ability (Feral Frenzy) let's them vault over the pallets
---
Wanna know why? It‚Äôs a weak killer.
---
We need more unique chase music honestly.
---
I got it on sale for 6 and some change after the taxes.
---
Our little Freddy is all grown up :‚Äô)
---
That‚Äôs gotta be outdated.
---
You get Diversion points in the Objective for being chased and thank god for that,if I didn‚Äôt get diversion points,I probably wouldn‚Äôt had pipped the other day.
---
there's also this one really terrible pallet that's up against a wall leaning against an object that's literally a foot in length lmfao, totally going to stop you from getting hit 100%
---
Isn't this a Kitty0706?
---
Did you have a stroke?
---
Dont be sad he is mid tier. It just means it isnt over powered and thats a good thing
---
It was gibby
---
In the business I call it a fake out, false hope if you will....cus I totally ment to do it.
---
Bruh a bioshock dlc would be lit
---
Watch it be Christine
---
This is why I usually just leave the lobby after the match. Sometimes I throw a gg if its deserved, but mostly no.
---
It also means he isn‚Äôt viable at high ranks,
---
Lag switch?
---
I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre wrong cause I definitely know the levels of salt players of this game can get to, but since the patch I‚Äôve been randomly disconnected from matches pretty often, as survivor or killer. The amount of disconnects I‚Äôm seeing has increased, so probably a bit of both.
---
You brought up some good points, maybe I need to test the perks on the killers you mentioned some more. It just seems that they‚Äôre are some way better alternatives to surge and cruel limits only working when gens get piped make it so you‚Äôll rarely be able to take advantage of it since you can‚Äôt choose when it goes off, and mindbreaker is only going to work once when the survivors don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre going against a stealth killer.
---
Insidious camper finally gets his just desserts.
---
Nicely done. I gotta try doing an adept build on a S/K
---
The gens could be on different ‚Äúisles‚Äù then when a gen is powered the speakers go ‚Äúclean up on isle x‚Äù
---
There‚Äôs a few reasons. The first is it was the PTB where ranks are all over the place and they went against really shitty/low rank survivors. 
---
Also, they can hand pick which games to show on YouTube.  Obviously, games where they get beat down aren‚Äôt going to be shown. 
---
Also, he got nerfed from the PTB, which I find to be a bit crazy. His portals can easily be removed making him an M1 killer with just a lunge mechanic that can be easily avoided.  The fact that they upped his cool down from shred is really killing him right now. Plus he‚Äôs a lot slower when using it, now making it akin to the Pig‚Äôs dash, which isn‚Äôt a selling point at all.
---
I bought all killers since there was a sale... I really like this game tho so I don‚Äôt mind thanks for this!
---
I mean theres otto stamper and the staff of Lery's memorial institute.
---
I once accidentally marked a spot with my map and all of my teammates came and worshipped it with me. None of us had ever seen one.
---
I hate the new map
---
Lol, think about what the reverse would look like.
---
I'm waiting until they fix Jake's hair. Otherwise, no coin from me.
---
I play spirit so darn :/
---
What rank are you?
---
I watched one of my friends fast vault into a locker to hide because he didn‚Äôt realize it notified the killer
---
I agree on surge, but i honestly think that‚Äôs not good enough, I prefer my idea. I feel like if they removed the 50% it would be so much better and might be useful in the situation you mentioned. I agree cruel confinement sounds really cool, I wonder why they changed it.
---
1. Nancy's perk 
---
2. Steve's perk
---
3. A med kit with 32 charges
---
4 self care in a far 4th place. 
---
Sloppy butcher with self care is 40 seconds, or have an entire gen. Totally not worth.
---
Lmaooooooo
---
Good at 3 gens. I like him at the moment, but he is really weak against good or coordinated players
---
He's and easy yet tricky killer to play as, just remember to like practice and that you got this I was the same way
---
Nope I think it‚Äôs same Thoe don‚Äôt quote me on that
---
&gt; AND REPAIRED IT WITH ONLY
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Resilience, Engineer's Toolbox + Socket Swivels, Leader, Prove Thyself, and three other survivors with the exact same build
---
and your point? The fact it can be done in the game that way proves it is broken and should be balanced. You balance the game from the top down, or where the skill ceiling is. Doesn't matter if less than .00001% of the people might be willing to do it. The fact is, 4 people could easily throw together a SWF to do just this and spend the entire night just shitting on killers if they wanted to.
---
It looks like Risk or Rain 2.
---
It be like that sometimes.
---
Dissing self care = guaranteed negative karma.
---
I feel you though.  There's nothing like being on the hook, and seeing all your teammates' auras in seperate corners, all healing themselves.
---
Don't stream, do YouTube instead.
---
What‚Äôs your YouTube channel?
---
I wish I had amnesia or something so I could go back and experience games for the first time good times like the days of yonder
---
&gt; you could just take Bond and find someone to heal you in half the time
---
As someone who runs a "best buddies" build with Bond/Empathy/Open Handed it can easily take 2-3 times as long to find someone else to help you heal.  20 seconds is perfectly fine.
---
It‚Äôs random I think on the what spawns seems like you had a crappy spawn
---
I hope they give us this outfit and then Tunnel Bandit as well. Differences are the backpack, open jacket, mask, dirt/blood, tunnel vines, and the mask and goggles. It can easily be two separate outfits.
---
Killers: Go about your business and ignore this post
---
Yes clown,spirit and legion have unique main menu music I‚Äôd love unique chase music
---
Nice I wanna watch for a sale because I love the mask
---
I do it as a goal like I wanna P350 all killers then prob gonna move on to survivors
---
Honestly, he‚Äôs pretty bad. His teleportation takes time to set up and use.  All that time is easily wiped away by how quickly his portals can be destroyed.  Survivors are easily erasing his number one tool. 
---
His shred ability is in a bad place at the moment. The hitbox is pretty small, he moves a lot slower when powering up, and he has a long delay after using it, which was a nerf implemented after the PTB.  It‚Äôs also a very situation ability that survivors can easily avoid.
---
He‚Äôs usually delegated to a strictly M1 killer that has a power akin to the Pig‚Äôs dash which is hardly used/useful on her.
---
Also it doesn't make others waste gen time healing you
---
Our Current Version Goes Something Like:
---
1. Friend gets hooked in under 1 minute = 1 Drink
---
2. Mori = 1 Drink
---
3. Drop God Pallet = 1 Drink
---
4. 1 Hook Death = 2 Drinks
---
5. Friend makes an insane noise in Discord when the killer finds them = 1 Drink
---
6. Blowing a Generator = 1 Drink
---
It'll have its moments. They dont want to make killers to OP. As fun as they can be
---
That‚Äôs interesting. It‚Äôs always random as hell for me. So random I can‚Äôt even give an average skill check amount. They move like mood swings.
---
If you would have just walked out you would have been fine lmao
---
You finally find a lobby after 20mins and the killer is rocking 600ping. You then say "fuck it" and ready anyway. It loads midway before you get a "Match Cancelled".
---
you got so lucky there, I mean that was just one close call after another
---
Honestly, same... I love Scoops and I‚Äôd riot if we didn‚Äôt get it but I mean, this outfit is so damn cool.
---
I think better together and prove thyself is good enough. If you want to maximize your build you can replace spine chill with leader.
---
Bro I know my ass was clenched the whole time
---
Just because you don't like my input doesn't mean it isn't valid.
---
My input is the perks are fine, you just need to learn how to utilize them
---
Swf like this are rarer than anything else, almost all swf are just fucking around, and it doesn‚Äôt need a nerf because it‚Äôs balanced around people queuing solo not as a swf. Like sure as you said a swf could put this build on and destroy killers but I can almost guarantee you won‚Äôt get a team like this
---
Yes. I tested it in custom game with a friend.
---
Noice
---
BECAUSE THEY GOT BILLS TO PAY AND ITS BETTER TO RELEASE BUGGY GARBAGE KNOWING THAT WE'RE ALL TOO ADDICTED TO DO SHIT ABOUT IT THAN IT IS TO FAIL TO COME THROUGH WITH THEIR CHAPTER
---
I SECOND THIS SHIT
---
made with mematic
---
Gotta love the teammate who's just sitting there doing nothing
---
Which outfit is that? i don't remember
---
THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT JUST BOOPER ZAP THEM ITS WHAT THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED!
---
To clarify, I'm not shaming the players in the screenshot, they were very sportsmanlike and were respectful with their escapes.
---
yeah i have to admit i bought deathgarden for that mask, still didnt got to play it since the open beta/ first free weekend but love that mask so it was worth it
---
THE BEST WAY TO GET GOOD IS TO PRACTICE AND TO LEARN THE LOOPS. MOSTLY THEY ARE A SERIES OF SET MOVEMENTS WHERE YOU RUN AROUND CERTAIN OBJECTS. YOU CAN'T LOOP EVERYTHING
---
Wait. The Red is the one who quit?
---
Yeah I get destroyed by SWF a lot as soon as a teleports up it's taken away basically negating his ability.
---
Chase music is awesome. On survivors' side it's really sounding like ST theme but much more tense and dangerous, while on killer's side it can be monotonous, but those distorted sounds really show the nature of Demogorgon - violent, feral, merciless
---
Too real lol
---
Links to the other ones?
---
I see this a lot in DBD and it really makes me laugh sometimes, I think the fact that both sides often thing something is unbalanced in the other side‚Äôs favour probably means it‚Äôs more balanced than they want to admit
---
*Finds and downs someone in the first 40-50 seconds of a game, hooks them, goes off to look for other survivors. 10 seconds later, two gens pop.*
---
Lol, you're just not good enough.
---
Clutch bro!!!
---
Time to make my friend salty cause he thinks demegorgen is op
---
He needs tweaking he has the potential to be powerful but shred need to break pallets without add-on
---
Perfect flair. Same friend, same.
---
Wait you get the mask for owning death garden? Why dont I have my mask then :(
---
If your first post was 
---
&gt;	My input is the perks are fine, you just need to learn how to utilize them
---
Then I would haven‚Äôt replied how I did, your first post in no way conveys what you said here. 
---
It might be true, however when compared with the survivor perks, in which you don‚Äôt have to do anything different to a normal game, you can see why I think the demogorgan perks are lacking. Sure they might be good in certain situations but there are so much better alternatives that they might as well not even exist. I don‚Äôt see why I would choose surge over ruin or pop, or cruel limits over bamboozle, or mindbreaker over literally any other perk.
---
The almighty is being chosen to lead us into freedom!
---
Yea I‚Äôm on Xbox it takes forever people just end up leaving.
---
I have done this 3 times in 1 day already.
---
IF THEY DON'T GET THE 4K THEN THEIR PARENTS ARE JUSTIFIED IN VIEWING THEM AS FAILURES. THEY NEED THIS WIN BRO!
---
Or the Goblin Truck.
---
BECAUSE IF EVERYONE HAD TALENT WE'D ALL GO ON CRUISES INSTEAD OF CAMPING TRIPS!
---
THIS IS WHAT PARENTING IS LIKE! BE PROUD YOU CARRIED DWEETS HIGH!
---
&gt;sadly he's mid tier
---
What's wrong with that? Mid tier is good..
---
Yes it increases its range ? Or yes it‚Äôs a fixed range ?
---
I love this a lot
---
Because I wanted a huge hulking best to be a decent killer,
---
Yeah, but spine chill kinda help me be the gen jock, so I use it to not confront the killer
---
Yep just got off work too. Boutta eat some faces soon
---
Every killer is viable at high ranks. I see plenty of low tier killers at rank 1
---
Got matches like this literally all day. Killer was always way lower than the lowest ranked survivor :(
---
Well, how about S.T.A.L.K.E.R?
---
Lol if I see a survivor go into the coal tower I leave.
---
just trying to stun the killer
---
Tbh u did pretty good for less than 20 hours dude keep up the good work!
---
I had that on my first bloodweb for Myers and Wraith
---
Leader doesn't do anything anymore in regard of gen speed
---
Real pros don't use flashy cosmetics
---
I HAVE SEEN LOOPS TALKED ABOUT AND I KNOW THERE ARE SET PIECES THAT ALWAYS SPAWN THE SAME (CERTAIN WALL SETS AND SUCH) IT'S JUST A LOT TO LEARN REAL EARLY. THIS GAME IS REAL FUN, BUT IT HAS NO TIME FOR CASUAL PLAYERS IT SEEMS.
---
If matchmaking wasn‚Äôt like that your queue times will be even longer.
---
Level 5 Killer gets level III with Tombstone and kills the baby dwights on the other side of the pallet. Baby Dwight: "Whaaaat?! That's BS! This game is lame!" \*Continue to play for 100+ hours\*
---
Baby Dwights become Michaels and the cycle starts over.
---
Don't do that, don't give me hope
---
yeah I tried that every time but the survivors tend to stick near the damned ironworks
---
