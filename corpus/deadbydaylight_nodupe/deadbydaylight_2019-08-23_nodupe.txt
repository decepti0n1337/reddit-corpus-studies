Feng or Meg??

---
Wow that’s lucky.
---
It's usually habit now to heal under hook and experienced players don't fear the heartbeat whatsoever. 
---

---
If someone is healing you and you find it unsafe just run away, they can't stop you.
---
Severely downplaying these changes. I went through ~120-130 bloodwebs just to get bbq tier 1 on legion, thank god I burned through most of the perks and I was able to acquire tier 3 rather quickly.
---
A sunflower costume
---
No problem, also I came across [this vid](https://youtu.be/dMSjcbZhCw8) which gives some good tips on plague perks. It's a summary of this week's shrine, the plague content starts around 7 minutes in.
---
I got Ruin, Bamboozle and all Myers, Wraith, Trapper and Nurse. I wish I had Spirit Fury and Discordance now...
---
iron maiden does not show aura
---
Yea true but they'll probably tweak it when the PTB comes out plus was exist and pallets,windows etc
---
Hey Otz! Love your streams. Thanks for this, really helpful!
---
I mean most perk grinds start at that point
---
I get that it would probably be faster to let another survivor heal you, but to me the main benefit of second wind is that you can be healing *and* doing something else at the same time, like fixing a gen.
---
Its like a breath of fresh air, not having to be eating splinters
---
My current build is BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury and the 4th perk is open for changes at any moment. Currently using Discordance but also switch to Bamboozle, Whispers, Deerstalker, Infectious Fright, Nurse's, etc. Never a game slowing perk on Billy because he is insanely strong and chasing / information perks are more fun.
---
Even Nurse's has its use on Billy because you can find people healing mid zooming around the map with your chainsaw.
---
U realize that with iron maiden u get a notification after they exit right? in the right mind will get into a locker during a chase, you still lose time if they hide in a locker and you check the wrong one. Huntress is an exception where i can see it being usefull, but hasnt she an addon for that?
---
I mean, from what they shown, you can charge it and hold it, then use it when you can get a good attack and its hard to dodge
---
Im playing an amusing scenario in my head where a survivor uses babysitter only to discover the killer has make your choice
---
BTEC?
---
Oh true lol. I thought you meant in chases, I’m dumb.
---
For some reason I couldn't post it on Horizontal. My Bad..
---
Second wind is actually genius as some people don’t go and get healed up after getting unhooked so go work on a gen and done healing it takes about 20 seconds
---
Mid tier in my opinion, the ability to teleport is decent but it can be cancelled but the demogorgon does get no terror radius which is kinda situational. The pounce is well interesting but seems weak also but it could be great we just don't know alot about it
---
Adrenaline who? Self care what? We dont know her.
---
I'm sure any rank has a hard time hitting 5 token lullaby
---
Even with small game it's fairly likely that finding a totem to cleanse and then sitting in a locker for 8 seconds will take longer than just using self care in the first place.
---
That's assuming people are trying to get every perk. Not many people want or will use every perk in the game, so the additional choice helps them get what they want faster.
---
Even if someone is trying to get every perk, and there are three times as many perks as levels, that still cuts over one third of all bloodwebs. People trying to do this will be saving millions of BP. That's pretty significant.
---
How many teachables do you have?
---
You need to get unhooked for perk to heal you? or it heals you as long as it is active (After you heal other survivor?) I am confuuuuseeeeeed.
---
Hubtress is one of the most balanced killers in the game, probably freddy is better than her
---
i have 69,000,000 BP. Back in the day your profile could randomly get deleted. Mine did and I emailed the devs and they gave me 150,000,000 BP to get all my stuff back. No legacies but i've riding these BPs for a couple years now.
---
&gt;I got Ruin, Bamboozle and all Myers, Wraith, Trapper and Nurse. I wish I had Spirit Fury and Discordance now...
---
I would go with Bamboozle instead of Nurse's Calling until you unlock Spirit Fury and like I said, Whispers instead of Tinkerer.
---
You mean 1/3?
---
Unnerving presence, distressing, Huntress' lullaby, Ruin and playing as a doctor is how to stop skill checks properly.
---
Sadly yes, i really miss those new powers who feels so diferent to other killers
---
Looks mid tier to me. 
---
For the tunnel it took about 20 seconds for nancy to cleanse it solo. Granted she pulled back twice so.... Potato devs failing skill checks making it take longer? Either way I am looking at it as a win win. If survivors take 20 seconds to cleanse a portal thats 20 seconds they aren't doing gens. If they don't I can pressure gens better.
---
The pounce is getting a lot of crap already and I can sort of see why since it slows the demo's movement speed which frankly usually seems unnecessary in the killers they do that to. Most killers they could speed up a bit and they probably still wouldn't break midtier like Hag trap setting or Clown bottle mixing.  So its quite possible Demo's pounce is getting a taste of the unnecessary power slowdown devs like to dish out. 
---
On the otherhand on the stream the lunge seemed to have pretty good reach thanks to Demo's weird alien arm proportions. It'll be interesting to see how it feels. Especially around vaults and pallets. 
---
Obviously at a bare minimum the pounce needs to get the Demo more ground then he get by just walking at a survivor and lunging at them.
---
I'm sure bad survivors will complain about him in the same way they complain about Hag and Freddy. He can travel across the map and the devs specifically said hes pounce is hard to stun him out of with a pallet so I can just imagine the salt that is going to flow from mediocre survivors who just run to a pallet and stand on the otherside waiting for a killer to charge before dropping it like some kind of "GOTCHA" only to get pounces and smacked.
---
Prestiging a character doesn't change the available perks.
---
I meant in terms of how their powers function.
---
Id like to introduce you: Mama Oink also known as The Pig
---
Yes, and again, why is comparing anything to her fair?
---
I pushed to rank 1 solely using spirit,for the achievement as you do too.She's really easy to get used to(defo easier than nurse),and your only problem will be Iron Will users.
---
I first used BBQ-Sloppy Butcher-Enduring-Spirit Fury but then swapped enduring and spirit fury for ruin and pop goes the weasel,and I almost always used movement speed and recharge time addons.
---
This way I went all the way up to 1 from 10 in like 3 days,and that was around the first week of June,so I didn't take advantage of rank reset.
---
The pounce is probably my favorite power, imo its gonna be a hogh skill cap thing that good demogorgons are gonna abuse it to destroy survivors and most likely gets nerfed then.
---
Yea but from what they show is usually atleast slightly different like plague actually having a ability not being denied. The footage is also staged so can't judge it very well from that.
---
If you're just trying to prestige a killer, bloodweb changes wouldn't affect that unless they reduced the number of items per web. Is that what you were hoping for?
---
totally lagswitch
---
[removed]
---
&gt;please don't riot
---
[honey, you've got a big storm comin](https://youtu.be/O5WbFb_Hi3E)
---
Yea probably but in my opinion not being able to move the direction is kinda a kick to the killers tier rating in general. We can't judge the ability at all until the PTB(or full release)
---
Left click: bottle. Breaks after a set amount of hits, causing mangled status effect
---
*”... yer arses arse and I’m the grass man, punk yeah ya havin heathen.”*
---
Right click: brings out a stickybomb launcher to set up traps, pressing left click will launch stickies, up to a max of 8. instantly put survivors in dying state if blown up. May also be used to sticky jump for movement. Pressing right click will detonate all sticky bombs on the map.
---
*”Yer like a little bunny... scurryin’ around, eatin’ up yer lettuce and berries!”*
---
Control: takes out the eyelander with guaranteed crits active, beheading and instantly killing survivors, but slows the demoman down.
---
*”There can be only one!”*
---
Passive ability: when taking a swing with the bottle, a luck check is rolled and may result in a critical hit, downing the survivor immediately.
---
*”Oh, they’re gonna find ya all dead in the alley, with cats lickin’ at ya!”*
---
*You*'re not funny.
---
&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!It's true though, honestly it's getting a bit old.!&lt;
---
Hope Myers skins baldy alive.
---
Otz low-key wishing these perks will be underused so he can do a "most underrated perks" video with them.  
---
We love you Otz!
---
What does that have to do with anything he littrely went up an entire staircase with it
---
The point isn't about throwing out ideas the point is the with no clue on how the power actually works or the potential it has your ideas are essentially a fish trying to climb a tree.
---
I think the devs have recognized that the current meta perks are already as strong as they want them to be. So instead of trying to create new perks for the meta that will either be too strong or unused they’d rather create perks that fit a more niche style of gameplay.
---

Idk maybe a real demogorgan skin

Imagine him getting hit by a pallet.  
---
\*Surprised Thanos face\* *Impossible*
---
don't run away if you see the we'll make it icon pop up.
---
When does this DLC come out?
---
There are dozens of Claudettes in this picture.
---
If the Gen perk works *with* PGTW, I could see that being insanely busted. 37% regression on everything in a decent radius? Holy shit that's good.
---
Also, we don't know if there's a cooldown or not, so if you down two people next to a generator it would be 24% regression and two downed Survivors. I know that won't come up every game, but it's going to be strong when it does.
---
Surge is super cool, even as a survivor main thats just a neato idea. Doctors with that gunna be aids though
---
I mean the gorgon already seems kinda mediorce so I don't think he's getting nerfed however those survivor perks I can already smell the complaining from here.
---
Or the new survivors become like Ash.... because mettle of man is useless now. Don't want to see the new survivor perks get fucked up too
---
Impossible, my unyielding anger, angers me to complain like a warrior.....keyboard warrior.
---
any more than 3 safe unhooks would be too much since in a match a survivor can only unhook other survivors 6 times total.
---
Yeah, I feel like a lot of people aren't understanding that it goes away near immediately after they stop working on a generator. I think the best potential it has at being powerful is the secondary effect of stopping any other exhaustion effects while a survivor is working on a generator. That's truly going to disrupt some people.
---
Pretty sure the HUD was off?
---
Hex: Ruin, Discordance, Corrupt Intervention, and Mind Breaker, the "Don't you dare touch a single gen for the first 5 minutes" build.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel, Overcharge, Surveillance/ Brutal Strength/ Tinkerer, and Surge, "The Generator Killer" build.
---
Bamboozle, Overwhelming Presence, Franklin's Demise, and Cruel Confinement, the "Fuck that goddamned, loop hungry, clicky bitch" build.
---
My problem is that the number of times a player runs from safe heals (the killer is known to be chasing someone else not in terror radius) is far greater than the times healing someone under the hook ends up being the bad decision. Like I shouldn’t have to chase someone for 30 seconds for us to find a corner to heal.
---
You know she can’t see blood without an UR add on right?
---
Oh my god me, this is going to be me. lol xD
---
Inbefore people just go and hide in the corners of the map instead
---
Ugh I'm so ready to see all the gen sluts 🤪
---
I feel like he’s gonna be a good killer at least b tier. It’s just gonna be new for everyone and I know people hate adapting to new things because they aren’t used to it.
---
Agreed, I’m very excited for this chapter
---
Steve's perks are built for altruism. I hope everyone trying to farm BP that way will play as steve from now on, it even fits his character.
---
(:
---
I feel as though you should mind your own business.
---
????
---
Yeah but that Exhaustion only sticks around for a maximum of 3 seconds.
---
Honestly if I were running inner strength the first thing I'd do in a match is cleanse a totem so that way it's prepped a head of time.
---
Eh I can see b tier I guess just the teleporting seems alright and the lunge seems ok also. But yea people hate adapting so I see complaining from both sides.
---
Doin us Dwight mains proud
---
Oh my god can you not? He DC'd for comedic reasons. Do you really think the survivors would've been able to escape if he didn't DC? It hurts no one in that situation.
---
Our explanation has been told many times by a lot of people in this thread, yet you either ignored, pretended you didn't see it, or are literally oblivious to the fact it's there. Not only that, but you feel it's okay to fall us all fanboys and to say "fuck all you guys". Like come on
---
Oh shoot that's right! Man I'm so excited for this chapter
---
SOFT serve AND WET
---
same
---
Do you know if Second Wind is a one-time perk or if you can get the benefit on both hooks?
---
You should use Kill Bill flashback soundtrack.
---
Is Pig perceived as an easy killer to play? I feel it's closer to the opposite tbh.
---
Yes and no. The gen has to be below 50% for this to take effect, unfortunately. That be said, exhaustion is applied automatically and immediately to the person working on the gen. If you WEREN'T exhausted when you started working on the gen, you'll have 1/2/3 seconds of exhaustion applied to you. If you WERE exhausted, it basically just pauses the exhaustion timer (idk if you get the additional seconds added on or not). Once you hit 50% on that gen, your exhaustion meter will go down/behave normally. It IS worded strange, so while I'm pretty sure this is how the perk works, dont take this as absolute fact! Personally, I think the only way I'll know for sure is once I see actual gameplay of it!
---
I JUST FOUGHT A NURSE MOVING AT 4.6M/S WITH NO SPEED ADD-ONS OR SPEED PERKS. WTF IS THIS GAME SHE DIDN'T EVEN CHASE LONG ENOUGH FOR BLOODLUST. SHE JUST RAN STRAIGHT AFTER ME WITHOUT BLINKING AND CAUGHT UP IN SECONDS, EVEN WITH THE INJURY SPEED BOOST. THIS GAME IS BROKEN AF
---
The way I see it is this: you down someone, the gen nearby is instantly kicked. You can then take them to a hook near a different gen, and kick that one. It saves like 10 seconds or so each time you down someone, but it all adds up.
---
I guess we'll have to see how it all shakes out.
---
So you run around, checking totems and count how many you see
---
Might have missed it I watched on my third screen at work and could have easily missed a shot where more than two portals were present.
---
cool

What I mean is that chances are people are already going to make their way over to your gen. If they come through the area they most likely want to do a gen or are looking for something else and weren't going to do it with you anyway. Prove thyself is still the strongest gen perk by a mile and half, this perk won't change anything about the way people do gens.
---
You'll be in broken during second wind, which means nobody will be able to heal you. Though it's definitely possible her perk stacks with it.
---
Been there, Done that.
---
This is pretty big tbh. Assuming you can get 2 perks somewhat consistently, this cuts the amount of BP needed to chase perks in half, as well as more choice in which perks you get.
---
35-39 will actually be the least efficient levels post-change.

Honestly not a fan of these perks, they are just way too niche or specialized. I can’t see myself using most of these in a practical manner.

Not if you only cleanse a totem if you happen to go near it.

---
Holy crap - 360 balanced landing with a overcharge skill check and a hook save
---
Good work friend!
---
This. This right here. I farm BP on Bubba and I'm a survivor main. I'm the fucking Disney of killers. Everyone gets 1 hook ride and then they all go home. I even chase down lazy survivors and bong them and bring them to gens with everyone else so that we all get out of here faster. But just now I had to get my first 4k cause some dipshit no-talent Claudette decides to teabag constantly when she's dropping pallets that aren't even hitting. She didn't loop me for 10 seconds before we moved into a hook together. Don't be an ass. Some of us are survivor mains trying to just have fun :P
---
Fixated only effects the walking speed and doesn’t stack with running, as far as I could tell, and the increase definitely does not make you faster then the killer when walking
---
For me: Plague is most fun, Spirit is strongest, and Legion is neither. Although it’s worth noting Legion is weirdly popular at Rank 1 on Xbox.
---
And the pizza was still on time!
---
Well that’s what I call a rank 20 play
---
you WALK 20% faster. Walking speed is 2,6m/s,with fixated it’s 3,12 m/s.
---
Um no, prove thyself is not all that strong in red ranks. Lol -
---
Bond on the other hand does see some use in Solo Queue red ranks because it prevents you from interrupting survivors on gens among other uses.
---
You’re wrong. Survivor [walking](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds) movement speed is not the 100% base speed everyone always talks about. It’s 56%.
---
Yah everyone was and almost every game on every survivor it was used because the influx of shitheads ruined the game.
---
Well it’ll be less embarrassing than the Nancy player who gets killed by iron maiden.
---
It might not due to it being such a weird interaction. If you heal in 20 seconds with second wind but the effects of deliverance last 60, does second wind negate deliverance or do you have to wait until 60 seconds pass to get your full heal? Do you even get to heal at all during those 60 seconds? It's an interaction we haven't seen before, so there's no telling what might be the right answer.
---
Oh I see what you mean, that does sound good
---
Forgive me lord for what I'm about to do 🙏
---
No, you got that wrong. I'm saying pig is a bad killer, yet it takes more skill than a top tier killer. There's something wrong there...
---
Thank you!
---
Goddamn it, now I want a Nazgul Killer
---
Yeah there's definitely nothing in between left behind and a perk that makes you walk faster. That makes no fucking sense. Clearly you've never played ring around the rosie with a killer because this perk is going to make hiding behind something 300% easier.
---
Edit: To clarify, it's basically urban but for when you're standing up. If you want to tell me urban is a bad perk I'll sit here and laugh at you all day.
---
You forgot the meta perk d strike that is disgusting with inner strength
---
Prevents Sprint Burst and can guarantee that they wont Dead Hard your hit. It works best on Pig/Wraith, who get dicked on hard by Sprint Burst/Dead Hard/Lithe if a window is by a Gen
---
Unless you're already exhausted after loosing a killer
---
I think Hex perks are gonna take a huge hit with Nancy’s Inner Strength. Devour Hope will be no more. I love running that one with Ruin because when they get ruin they stop looking for totems and then I start massacring people when it hits. Not anymore. People will scour all totems.
---
I will say let ppl complain after maybe 4 days of the PTB about certain things after all a PTB is for testing and see what works and what does not
---
"Remember when we had a killer that did this thing, and they were so horrifically awful they needed to be reworked entirely? THE NEW KILLER SHOULD DO THAT AND THATS A FACT!"
---
Lol mmmmmmmmmk
---
no, that's just a normal concept art like any other
---
As a Doctor main I found that trophy easy. Just keep zapping people.
---
Killers already have pressure issues.
---
If you chase someone for 30 seconds, the other three survivors are at least 20% done already (three survivors can repair all five generators in 2 minutes and 26 seconds, this is reduced to 2 minutes and 10 seconds if you add toolboxes without addons, 1 minute and 57 seconds if you add Prove Thyself on top of toolboxes \[only impacts the two generators being 3-manned\] and 105 seconds if they want to meme with Resilience/be injured/No Mither/body block and run in separate directions).
---
Survivors getting to do a random totem and heal up when the Killer can hardly patrol dull totems and locker-into-DS is already a thing is just going to be painful for already strained Killer momentum.
---
I hope that since she has different hair, and clothing in her perks that it may be a hint for some of her cosmetic options. *fingers crossed as I pray to the Entity* I need a ponytail option for Nancy.
---
I got a meta to invent. I’m an innovator baby, change the realm.

I was sure they said "Human" without the oid because thus far everything has indeed been human.

I just hope they won't give him cooldown on teleport and stupid slowdown while charging his attack would be removed
---
I don't know. One day I had levels on my characters, the next, all reset to 1
---
20% is quite a bit dude. I think if you run sb this is a great perk to pair
---
Erm, wrong meme template I think
---
Why not? 
---
Cute couple.
---
Tinkerer is a very meh perk. Even with Billy’s speed you will probably be too late to save generators with it. I would replace it with Pop if you’re confident in your ability to down survivors, Ruin if not. You could easily replace BBQ with Thrilling Temors unless you are farming bloodpoints and get more usable information I feel.
---
Even with a brain, understanding your broken ass English in this comment is a challenge
---
It'd be pretty scary working on a gen and hearing a Nazgul scream
---
Surge won't be "pointless" at all. If you hit two gens with it, you're regressing as much total time as PGTW. Not saying its gonna be meta either, I just see it being far from useless!
---
They never said that one tho...
---
It’s a new thing so it’s gonna take some time getting used to and finding new perk builds and stuff like that, I feel like 2 weeks is a good amount of time
---
You're not able to heal or remove any previous Broken Effect Status' with Second Wind. So if you've been broken by Plague, hooked and then unhooked, the perk will not heal you.
---
The soul stone: Force any survivor to DC whenever you please
---
The mind stone: Force any survivor to stand perfectly still while screaming
---
this is very correct
---
NOED is perfectly fair, hell you can go a match without ever even getting to use it if they do totems. Survivors have adrenaline and hope to easily counter it and even small game.
---
An easier way to look at it... hatch spawns when the # of generators left = # of survivors dead
---
Yes, the basement is pretty hard to see in on some maps. Whats so weird is it changes map to map
---
They shouldn't change it because it would in turn be a direct buff to Dead Hard, which is in a good place atm (minus the connection issues)

I think Fixated will probably need the movement speed buff to be removed. Won't know until we play it, but that sounds busted.

There’s nothing wrong about this, I’ve seen a decent amount of people selling keychains, shirts and posters with a DBD theme
---
then you hear a bing bong
---
So strong versus randoms but 100% useless versus SWF who can just post a "lookout" survivor?
---
I feel like it would be a waste tbh, totems aren't difficult to find until end game
---
The perk has literally nothing to do with dead hard
---
Oh its definitely not op. I wasnt the one who said that
---
You could walk 20% faster while injured, thus allowing you to cover more distance while the exhaustion goes down.
---
Yep, but it doesn't make Pop Goes the Weasel obsolete because sometimes the gens around the guy you down don't have any progression on them to begin with, or sometimes you'd rather specifically want a certain Gen to progress faster with Pop if you're looking to get a 3 gen setup or lead people toward a trapped area.
---
Really good perk and I'm happy it's not just a better version of another perk.
---
Well,the bloodweb change is pretty underwhelming, imo.
---
I mean, it's something i guess, but i was really hoping they'd just do away with perk tiers altogether.
---
Or just do away with the random ass perk nonsense and allow them on all characters once unlocked.
---
The more characters added, the worse the grind is going to get.
---
This is just a band aid, really.
---
Oof, a whole new account just to criticise a game? You need to get yourself a girlfriend mate.
---
Looking for totems in NOT a waste of time. They are everywhere. It’s almost impossible to not run into one during the game. I’ll just cleanse one early in the game (15 seconds), wait till I get injured and hop into a locker (8 seconds). That’s 23 seconds, 17 seconds faster than self care. This perk works for me personally because I tend to cleanse totems and not run self care. This is not a perk that everyone will benefit from but people like me will.
---
The only downsides I can see is that if it becomes popular, it will be less useful. However, if it doesn’t become popular it will be a lot stronger. Also, it may actually be a time waster in certain maps, like Haddonfield or any indoor map. Aka, maps where totems are actually hard to find, which are not many
---
And yes you are 100% right. I cringe when I play with Claudettes because 90% of the game they are in one corner of the map healing themselves. In my opinion, survivors shouldn’t heal themselves more than 2 times per game. Otherwise you are pretty much giving killers the victory
---
It's kind of a good thing though. People would bitch if it never ever changed
---
Camaraderie should have been for Nancy bcuz no one will ever hook Steve.
---
I doubt it
---
Like you mentioned, the charge of it isn't slowed... At least it doesnt look like it! But holding it does look like its slower! Think the Plague, where you're normal speed when fully charged n ready to puke but slower during the charge up, but just opposite. I feel like it makes sense that way too because it prevents the killer from always having it charged up n ready to go while also not allowing the survivors to gain additional distance just because you're using your power. But you're right! Theres only one way to find out for sure and that's through actual gameplay!
---
Are they adding mindflayer or the doggo?
---
"A locker"; please don't patronize Dwight's home, it's very nice inside.
---
I take it you are new to the game or at least post emblem era. Victory Cube was way worse than emblems.
---
You can recover exhaustion while healthy too. Who stays injured just for dead hard. Oh resilience, so doing gens... there’s a perk that paused exhaustion while on a gen that I also said should be buffed.
---
Nah, it wont. Fixated only applies when walking in the healthy state, whereas urban only works when crouched.
---
Pig is mid tier, but I agree she takes skill to play.
---
How is noed the perfect gen rush counter?
---
My bad, I thought you said that you were mad
---
Me not seeing the exposed status effect: I see this as an absolute win
---
I think Mindbreaker is pretty bad. It's so insanely specific that you'd be a fool to run it. It looks like it's there specifically to counter guys who Sprint Burst or maybe Dead Hard and stay glued to that gen until you're just about to hit them. If the effects lasted like 20-30 seconds than good. But 3 seconds is literally nothing. 
---
Cruel Confinement looks okay. The problem is that, again, it's situational. It depends on the map. On a map like The Game it's garbage except for that one specific spot they can drop down. But on Lery's it would be great. 
---
Surge is great. They might nerf the shit out of it. Wouldn't surprise me. But I think you'll still have to pair it with another perk that affects the gens.
---
... I see you're committed to your lack of knowledge, so I'm going to leave you with it. Have a nice day.
---
i don’t see inner strength getting nerfed as it can only be used a certain amount of times.
---
Then there are survivors, who are legit easy mode ans there are 4 or them lol
---
Hook up: Kate
---
Marry: Nancy
---
Kill: Jane (sorry thicc bricc, one of you had to go)
---
When they release a perk that buffs make your choice.
---
I thought about this same exact build when they mentioned Inner Strength lol
---
If I’m being ignorant you should enlighten me right? I clearly missed something.
---
Gotta stick with Kate on this one.
---
Yeah iron maiden will probably get used more since it's a hard counter
---
Once each for survivor that have it which is what he’s talking about
---
I mean even if we don’t get the outfits we want (scoops ahoy) that doesn’t mean we won’t get them later down the line like the pig cosmetics
---
Detectives hunch, inner strength and a map would be better
---
Perfectly Balanced As All Things Should Be
---
Shit killer perks, Fuckin OP survivor perks
---
It's just a pun, and it's relevant and amusing.
---
It's far better than people who keep posting the exact same Simpson meme day in and day out, fifty times an hour, twenty-four hours a day, every day, for three fucking years.
---
Three years on Dead by Daylight's reddit, which they started doing after spending the last decade posting it fifty times an hour, twenty-four hours a day, every day, everywhere else.
---
No. I dont care enough about you to spend time explaining the concept of game balance to you. Nothing personal, though.
---
Bit late of a reply, but this fix didn't work. For some reason his account is unable to play the game. His wife can login fine on the same xbox, but switching to his account fails the license check. He has never played the game so it can't be corrupt save data. Really frustrating.
---
But by god am I gonna try
---
Killers already have less perks overall.  This is BS
---
You’re taking a position of superiority without any way to back it up. That’s ridiculous
---
Don't check steam dbd forum, baby killers are going crazy, in their heads these survivor perks are crazy op.
---
I’d be careful what you say ‘round these parts, partner... I’ve heard the Doctor Mains are a merciless bunch.
---
It's not a position of superiority, I just dont care.
---
The killer ones are lackluster.  Having exhausted status for 3 whole seconds after repairing a generator?  Seriously that's it?  It takes 3 seconds for the killer to even reach the survivor after they get in heartbeat range, and usually people stop the repair action when the heartbeat occurs.
---
As usual, the survivor perks are strong by themselves and the killer perks need to be paired with 1 or 2 other perks to even be somewhat viable.
---
All of Steve’s perks seem pretty bad or just mediocre in my opinion generally promoting bad plays all of Nancy’s are really solid and good though
---
So if I play GTA I can't make GTA related merchandise, fuck off
---
Shoot I just realized what you were talking about what I meant by charge is the stae when your face is open before you lunge
---
Ooh, hadn’t thought of that. Clever clever. Not to mention the walking speed buff
---
Do you mean for survivors? That seems really unfair on the killer to me. It almost makes a random survivor game like an SWF match by giving them too much information.
---
The beauty of hexes is the element of surprise, the whole point of NOED and Devour Hope etc is that you don't know they've got it until you're hit with it. With a totem counter for survivors they'll just do all five before doing any gens, in theory this should happen now but no hex counter negates it. Plus, totmes spawn in the same locations every game, with four survivors searching they'd all be gone within three minutes.
---
Hex perks are super strong because they carry a risk of being broken, they really shouldn't be nerfed more. NOED will be useless because there will never be five totems left by the time the gates are powered.
---
Been playing since launch. Just really frustrated after a night of three 4ks in a row (all brutal. One spirit two plague) followed by one bad 0k match and ending with -1 pip for the night.
---
And you edited your comment. It sounded much more sarcastic originally, which is why I dismissed explaining what I meant to you.
---
Granted I dont know shit about how all of this works, but would it have really been that expensive to have those 2 do voices for their characters? I mean, they got Bruce to do Ash... I cant help but think it maybe was just a scheduling thing. I know those 2 are both super busy, but I feel like they would have been up for it at the same time
---
You said I lack knowledge and am wrong, then said you do t care enough to explain. How’s that not what I said?
---
Thrill of the Hunt meta.
---
the joke has died down its not as bad as before and your right. the simpsons memes and all that are super lazy and have little to no effort, i wish memeless mode worked on mobile
---
Overalls, bear trap, you can probably get a replica mask on ebay or etsy
---
Lol who cares, not like survivors talk, you really care how he screams seriously
---
I mean it's not like I'm a fucking Legion main or anything I probably know nothing about one of his perks.  Also whatever point you tried to make must not have made it past the language barrier because yikes
---
Nah, PC. I've had the game since the first day.
---
Probably might talk in the lobby like ash
---
Adding on to this, as someone with contact with TWD but not having sat down and watched it start to finish, Negan was extremely sociopathic, but also authoritarian, he was... Knowing, coldly malicious, sadistic, but he styled himself as an enforcer of a way of life and a mini-Emperor demanding tribute.
---
Amanda Young/Pig was obsessed with trials in her former life.
---
Most of the rest of the cast are basically either serial killers (Myers, Clown, Huntress, etc), driven insane (either before or after joining the Fog, such as Hillbilly and Nurse were insane before) or tortured into it (I consider Spirit's conversion to still be torture-related given her demise at the hands of an Entity-driven maniac, for example).
---
And then of course the few that hunt willingly, but does that really fit Negan?
---
I specifically get on every couple of months now just to use Leatherbutt and insidious. Game lost flavour and fun but at least I can ruin someone else's fun! :D
---
The BP thing happened before DBD was on PS4
---
He is using premonition and this is not happening. I guess we know who the baby is
---
He pulls out a gun and shoots the survivors
---
Maybe at low ranks, other than that useless.
---
It only triggers once when a survivor is in the radius of the hooked one right? Well as the killer you should be able to deduce that there's a survivor nearby and go find them since you also can see the timer stop.
---
Kicking myself I didn't buy it on the Shrine of Secrets.
---
And it goes for both sides
---
It’s awful. It was the one perk I saw that I think immediately needs a buff and even with a buff I wouldn’t take it. Why would you need to let another survivor see your aura who’s ALREADY in a short radius of you?! 
---
If the radius was the whole map, it still wouldn’t be a top tier perk or that amazing but it would actually be good in some builds. The short radius on the aura reading makes it useless though :/
---
It says that it removes the blood too tho
---
Distortion "counters" Iron Maiden because you don't have to get into a locker to avoid BBQ &amp; Chili.
---
No word yet but I'm hoping no more than $10. I could see them trying to charge more though.
---
Well, ok then.
---
Being honest I also hate when I try to do a drive-by and the other guy hasn't recovered at all. It's like, why not? You're not crawling, did you go afk?
---
Me uwu
---
Jeez sorry I just thought...
---
I genuinely hope you’re being satirical.
---
😂
---
Nancy's Perks look dope.
---
Some killers will tunnel you for the pettiest of reasons, or maybe you're not very good at looping so they're going for the easy prey. It's only natural for the killer to play like a predator.
---
SPEAK HOW IS THE ABILITY TERRIBLE
---
I'm going to get deranked to killer20 from all the MOMMA STEVES!!! D:
---
Yes, nothing that makes you scream works against Calm Spirit.
---
By that logic, was Ghostface cheaper? I don't remember.
---
I'm buying regardless, but I'm curious.
---
the stranger things dlc is huge for them honestly didn’t see this coming.
---
Dedicated servers, this dlc, etc will help this game a bunch
---
Oooh thats a good idea!!!
---
Yes, so was Ash and Leatherface.
---
hahaha "Gen Slut."
---
Better Together+Prove Thyself tickles my synergy bone.
---
Without giving anything away, if you can figure out how to hack legacy cosmetics you can figure out how to do a lot more damaging things using similar processes. You absolutely will get banned if you're caught with hacked cosmetics - there's even been a popular streamer or two banned for illegitimate legacys. I would not ever equip those legacy cosmetics if I were OP and wanted to limit the chances of a ban.
---
In that instance though I was actually nowhere near the survivor, I remember it because my pizza got there so I went afk mid chase with a teammate
---
Wait is that the real otz?
---
Iron maiden is purely scream
---
HmmmmM
---
But general yea nothing bothers me more than when survivors prioritize crawling away over recovering
---
Calm spirit makes it so you can slow leave, actually
---
You make excellent points.  Its as strong if you think its useful to _not_ bring survivors together at generators.
---
But remember that you actually have to down people for it to activate... as a Doctor
---
If i had a dollar for everytime a survivor dced on me because i downed them ONCE, i'd have enough to buy a DLC when it goes on sale. Honestly tho had cheeky Claudette or Nea mains who tea bag on windows and pallets and dc the minute i down them like....bruh. If you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen, right?
---
Unexpected jojo
---
Where do you think you are?
---
True, but they didn't consider those chapters, so I wasn't sure if the pricing would match. Thank you btw
---
Since there's only so many meta perks that people use, you're effectively guaranteeing more of the same. I'd rather they stick with 4 perks since 90% of perks are useless anyways.
---
But the basement should have a lab counter around the four hooks and-
---
its really one of the easiest and fastest ones of all. you can even bodyblock a survivor and do it until the trophy unlocks. i remember doing that to one poor soul years ago when going after this trophy, and because they were the last survivor and i had a yellow skull in play, i even zapped the poor thing to death afterwards. some thanks, huh?
---
Probably not.
---
Or suffer my curse!
---
You could say its BigWack no?
---
Kinda late
---
haha i'm just glad we get a new killer every 3 months, with new trophies, as i'm a trophy hunter
---
Legion. Every Feral Frenzy hit will get you points in Hunting, Brutality, and Deviousness.
---
No it shouldn't
---
Sad tho
---
It's only been like 5 hours xD
---
Honestly one of my most panicked games this week was against a rank 19 Nurse that didn't know how to aim post-teleport but was still accurate enough to get close like five or six times in the chase.
---
They would have hit me repeatedly if they had just done one more more precise blink, it's not really hard, and I was spooked for my life.
---
You are about 7 hours late.
---
well a dash would have to inherently be fast, otherwise it would have to be renamed 'retarted leap', or a more PC variation of that
---
Sorry to hear that. Really odd, I've had the same issue but was able to circumvent it that way. The silence from the devs is pretty disappointing.
---
How...how can survivors camp?
---
For the record, I agree with you, I'm just downvoting due to the use of the aggressively overused Robin meme format.
---
Sorry I'm new
---
Of course not but the point is that survivors have the ability to do so that matters. It basically removes all of the killers interaction with that trial. Also it's way more common if you play for example red ranks right after resets
---
I’m gonna check after u say that lol 
---
Don’t go to steam forum anymore coz I got banned xD
---
this made no sense and i like it
---
Likely color swaps to start with, or something bestial/hairy, or plantlike because of the face,   would be my guesses
---
Irony: Sitting in a thread bitching about a circlejerk while participating in an upvote circlejerk.
---
Is it possible to save vs. Bubba? In my experience even if the person has Borrowed Time, they will just get hit twice before exiting chainsaw range (since they HAVE to run in a straight line up the stairs).
---
It’s official. u/DarkendSouls80 is the clown that’s why he doesn’t need a costume
---
Side note: I did not actually play a match like this. I'm a killer, not an asshole.
---
Don’t tell me where, but I just want to know if someone is actually there
---
“No you’re thinking of a guy with two knives”
---
“I gotta tell ya this feels pretty great.”
---
Yeah it might be annoying sometimes(as a survivor main) but I always look for totems when their is one or two hens left and for the most part I get them all, sometimes teammates get them. I am also a high rank player.
---
Surge sounds like a bitch when paired with thrilling tremors.
---
Most survivor mains are completely oblivious 100% of the time.
---
I see where you’re coming from, but I think this would just make the game a lot more hectic
---
Most likely happening. Stay up to date on r/LeaksByDaylight
---
I'll do you one better. Tea bagging plus flash light clicking near a fake pallet and you downed them and they immediately DC.
---
We did it boys, huntress is no more
---
Wouldn’t using camaraderie allow the killer to just watch when the timer stops and then know when there’s a survivor close to the hook?
---
I respect you
---
I guess but what if he just places a new one where he's at and then teleports. As long as he's not in a chase he would probably still get the person that's sabotaging it
---
If I were any better at this (or remembered the rest of Steve Jobs' lines from ERB), I'd try and continue it.  As it is seeing an ERB reference makes me happy.  Have an upvote.
---
They do interesting things but they're too situational it feels like. We'll still have to see it ingame to be 100% though
---
I think it’s only 20% on walking not crouching.  Crouching already has a huge buff from urban evasion by taking it from 50% walk speed to 100% walk speed when crouched.
---
Literally the entire chat was saying “a good job so far”
---
And honestly I doubt half the people saying all of it don’t even know how to end a line of code much less program one so yeah I have to agree with you that the chat was really annoying.
---
Yes, but then you'd probably see more people use Calm Spirit.
---
Buenos Dias Fuckboy
---
This has fewer pixels than my Ruin's lifespan
---
Ash is annoying, his grunts are worse than bill
---
Who am I gonna main now?! ;-;
---
It’s the only map I get nowadays and I can’t get a huntresses dwelling so I guess just bad luck
---
My personal opinion is that Iron Maiden's exposed effect isn't that good.
---
Survivor is exposed for 15 seconds.
---
Survivor runs at 4 m/s.
---
Killer moves at 4.6 m/s.
---
A 115% Killer covers 9 more meters than the Survivor in 15 seconds.
---
A 110% Killer covers 6 more meters than the Survivor in 15 seconds.
---
An exhaustion perk allows the Survivor allows the Survivor to run at 6 m/s for 3 seconds, covering the same amount of ground as a 110% Killer in a 15 second duration.
---
Therefore the fastest Killers are only guaranteed to close 3 relative meters towards the Survivor while the Survivor is still exposed.
---
It gives you the Survivor's location briefly, but you already have to be pretty close to be able to M1 them down in time or spot them before they hide.
---
Steve and Nancy can come to my studio and grunt anyday 👉😎👉
---
Hunter, the daddy version of huntress
---
Baby sitter was a perk made by fans
---
I have always thought that weakening a perk on a totem cleanse would be good.
---
This way if the totem is lost In 30 seconds thanks to crotus pen asylum spawns your not running a dead perk.
---
Ruin could only activate once every 3 skill checks.
---
Devour Hope and huntress lulaby can't have more then 2 tokens.
---
Third seal only works for 1 survivor at a time.
---
No change for NOED tho.
---
[Everything i’ve ever worked for, gone, right before my eyes](https://youtu.be/5XvpHVCp2oU)
---
Can't Inner Strength proc only five times in a match (if it's that healing in lockers after cleansing a totem one that I'm thinking about)? And that's between all four survivors, too.
---
I agree, but its nice to dream. Urban is already massively helpful at avoiding the killer, and that extra 20% while crouching would probably be a little overkill.
---
what's that?
---
And you definitely would not be if you played with that build, addons and offering. It is part of a game. Desire to win or go easier way should never be considered bad, toxic or anything like that.
---
And healing by a corner is super unsafe. I never get why people run towards a comer. Always run to a pallet and heal so you can have a safe place to loop of the killer finds you
---
Nothing can replace ruin
---
As a wise Redditor once said, bowler hat Demogorgon
---
This is the reason why I run spine chill and iron will.
---
Hmm... this is a tricky one, but I think I’ve got answers.
---
Firstly, Nick Castle as Michael Myers. Idk, the guy just seems like the right fit.
---
Similar case with Leatherface- Gunner Hansen seem like a good choice.
---
Now, Freddy. Jackie Earle Haley is a very good actor, so I think he would be a perfect fit for the Freddy written about in the character bios.
---
Pig can be played by Shawnee Smith- I think she could pull off the sneakiness Pig brings with her.
---
Now, here’s a bold take; Ash can be played by Bruce Campbell. I mean, just look at that chin. Something in the back of my head tells me that Bruce Campbell was born to play Ash Williams. I dunno, maybe it’s just me.
---
Can you say how it synergizes? I’m not doubting you I’m just actually wondering
---
A trick i learned to counter getting 360 ed is to just tap the attack when you see it. If you linge you whiff entirely. The tap sometimes connects 50/50 in my experience. Otherwise just dont swing right away and gst them a second later
---
How do I get closer? I have trouble with really following them when it happens.
---
Lol exactly, best setup... Maybe make it so that they can do gens but it cancels invulnerability
---
He hasn’t been released and people are already demanding to pay more money
---
Ah, I am a console player and didn’t know that it was up for 2 weeks. That will change my opinion to a week and a half. That’ll give people time to somewhat adjust to everything but I’m just nervous for the gorgon to get nerfed to hell.
---
I had a game a few hours ago where i decided that for once i would use stbfl. I hooked someone and saw someone searching the basement chest with my barbecue. It turns out that it was the obsession and they dc’d as soon as i downed them. This is why I don’t use stbfl
---
Same. I dont really, though. New maps sure but considering you only need a dull totem for IS to work it shouldn't be too hard to find at least one.
---
You're not a child at seventeen in most places anymore, and some places sixteen. I'm talking like "ages of consent" in North America and some parts of Europe, as well as the requirement to be tried as an adult in the legal system.
---
This also applies to alcohol in certain regions, and I believe some games rated M are now 17+ instead of 18+
---
Literally the only two things you can't do until you're 18 is a porno shoot and voting, you can drive, drink, bang, rip someone's guts out with a knife and get tried as an adult, and have a job, all 100% legally.
---
Just wait to swing. Dont swing as soon as possible, be patient and wait a moment so you dont need to lunge as far. Itll take a little bit to get used to, but itll stop the 360s
---
How do you follow them to hit after a second?
---
Have you read inner strengths text? You can literally just cleanse a totem at the start of the match or at any point and then wait til you get injured and just get into a locker. Better yet, if you do that, then get hooked, taken off and the killer chases you and you have DS just get into a locker and the Killer can't do shit. It's fucking disgusting and I already hate it and I hope it gets nerfed into the ground. Killers get situational crap and one sorta good perk and survivors get this kind of stuff.
---
I have to disagree with this entirely. I main survivors but I play a lot of killer too. Survivors in 15+ ranks are usually pretty aware.
---
I have a really good headset and great awareness, I am new to killer should I try spirit?
---
Awwww maaaan
---
Imagine getting offended by someone screaming insults at you because language is just superficial sounds that only have meaning because you *choose* to apply context to them, and it's absolutely your fault that someone is offending you, and you have no right to be upset or protest their behavior.
---
Because it's all in your own interpretation and you're 100% at fault.
---
FUCKING LOVE WHEN THAT HAPPENDS DURING A CHASE.
---
Or the 60% of brain dead Survivors will wonder what that weird object the other people are touching is, then decide to go back to crouch walking around the map
---
Basically its something you'll learn with time, you just need to train those reflexes. It gave me a lot of trouble and was super frustrating when I was new, but more often than not when they try it now, it basically just gives me a free hit on them.
---
This sub goes bonkers for Amanda's stun noise so...maybe?
---
How will it connect if they're usually out of my field of view or mostly out of it when they start?
---
I wish Claudette’s hair actually looked like this
---
I see your point and that’s why I try to say if killers can’t use things like Mori’s survivors can’t use something like d strike because a great offering beats a great perk if you didn’t have a mori then d strike is so hard to beat naturally because at endgame you can just lose a deserved kill
---
Bruh literally when has anyone rioted on perks? This is just stating the obvious.
---
If you dc I report, plain and simple.
---
## bruh 💯😝🤤😫😫
---
Very true it would def be overkill.  I already judge everyone I see with urban as I feel it just slows down the game because people that run it seem more reserved in gameplay with hiding excessively etc.  If Urban got a buff it would intensify my judgement
---
&gt; Survivors going against every other killer besides Nurse or Spirit
---
"Ok, I have to guess which way they'll take this loop, it's a 50/50 shot if they try be tricky on this pallet. I get hit if I guess wrong. This is fine and expected game play flow"
---
&gt; Survivors going against Spirit
---
"FUCKING HELL, IT'S A GOD DAMN COIN FLIP 50/50 CHANCE. THIS IS SUCH BULLSHIT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GUESS WHAT THE KILLER IS DOING."
---
Some guy once said I only won because of NOED even though I was using a Black Splinter
---
Y'know, that's a great question u/TaylorSwiftsFatCock I wonder if he would!
---
A question 70% of all Survivors wonder while they run in a large circle injured, with me behind them cursing up a storm
---
Now people can stop saying 'BUT THEY WON'T ADD WEREWOLVES IN THE GAME"
---
Still takes more skill then mindlessly running a loop with 3 teammates holding a button
---
Definitely* it’s horrid
---
Are you going to be able to down a survivor before they traverse outside of the activation radius though?
---
A survivor that you M1 gets an extra 6 meters and their exhaustion perk gives them an extra 6 meters for 12, and in those 6 seconds they get their normal 24 meters. This means that a running survivor who you M1 is going to be 36 meters away.
---
**How are you going to proc a 32 meter perk?**
---
Guess what: you won't. That survivor WILL get 36 meters away and it WILL be out of range of the generators and therefore the perk WILL not hit the generators being repaired.
---
You can tell when a killer is running NOED 80% of the time from how they play. There's hardly any surprise there.    
---
The meta's been "Ignore Altruism, Do Gens, Get Out" for ages now so I doubt there will suddenly be a flock of survivors cleansing totems. I've stopped running Ruin and use Corrupt Intervention because they just power through them regardless if they can hit the skill-checks or not. It's why we need more ways to slow the game down in general without having to introduce mechanics that are simply not fun, as holding M1 on a generator is already mind numbing enough.   
---
If survivors are totem hunting at the start of the game, guess what? That means they aren't doing gens and that directly applies pressure on them just from ignoring the main objective. In that scenario, if in those "three minutes" a killer can't take control of a game where no gens are popping, the problem is with how they're playing, not losing totems for a situational NOED break.  
---
All I'm asking for is that survivors see how many are left, just how there's already one for generators left. A solo survivor's experience should not be a handicap, the issue lies in a well coordinated SWF (which are extremely rare, by the way) having too much information and solo survivors either getting curbstomped and/or barely scrapping by.
---
Yeah the DLC is up on the PTB for two weeks, then one or two days later (like clockwork since the Spirit) the DLC is released for everyone
---
I doubt it becomes meta because the perk gets *much* worse when everyone is running it.
---
Just use Dance with me to escape the locker and leave no trail after Head-On-ing
---
It starts deactivated and activates each time you cleanse a totem, the activation charges don't stack, but you get five total potential activations per match and one survivor can use all five.
---
No, he'll make sure your ass isn't tight no more
---
Say someone like Freddy.  Surge knocks out the close gens, then teleport to a far gen and PGTW that one.  Would work even better with Thrilling Tremors
---
The game already does that by itself though. There is literally a perk that counters the game revealing downed survivors.
---
monkaS
---
Sound it out with me... COP P RIGHT. Morons I swear
---
Their weapon is just colliding into survivors while using her ability
---
to slow the game down.....
---
I can understand Mori’s since it’s very annoying to come into a game randomly to find that after a single hook everyone can be wiped out especially if you brought a very good item. As for killers and perks it’s always just annoying to die but that’s why you get better.
---
Babysitter+deliverance+We're gonna live forever+whatever
---
Then you break then and replace them with fake pallets. I have yet to experience a match where they just drop every pallet out of paranoia because paying attention is how you win against Freddy, or waking up.
---
Also you don't know how many totems are left after early game.
---
All that running around and you could've just had Self-Care instead.
---
Have you ever heard of partners of companies, you know, kinda like what Sam is...
---
U get ashamed, I don’t give a f***, I play both sides and idc what the other side says, I ain’t toxic to any side unless I feel they deserve it.
---
I bet ya babysitter is gonna be great In SWF
---
"You lose the Broken state"; that's all it says on a separate sentence, it goes full-stop, period.
---
it looks more like this in her concept art! which is coincidentally what I used as reference haha
---
I think this has been said before, but if you take Calm Spirit you won't scream based on Iron Maiden or Make Your Choice or pretty much anything that would usually make you scream.

i never saw stranger things but i sure hope thats not relevant. that would be toooo strange
---
Good god Rin just shove that sword up my ass why don’t ya
---
Freddy.
---
Need I say more.
---
haha it would be! it would mean she went thru like 8 yrs of college and never decided to just be a nurse
---
And if I were ever to engage a combat I wouldn't lose to anyone
---
Have to take into account the new map, which I believe is a factor in pricing. Ghostface and Ashe had no map ($5).
---
That's my fetish.
---
Yesssss
---
Yes
---
Just kill two birds with one stone and say scooby is the killer

They got so much better at 3D modeling.

Since Quentin that is.
---
It's kinda dumb that 360s are even a thing, but basically you just need to have your sensitivity cranked, and then lunge while swinging your camera view left and right like your having a seizure.

---
MLGA won't work after dedicated servers, don't know why it would be bannable. It will be useless... 
---
I highly doubt anything will change regarding perks and portraits as well.
---
Major respect man, I’m the same. I just hit 50 ebony moris cause I don’t ever do shit with them😂
---
In my experience survivors cleanse Hex totems 9/10 times they see them. I even lose thrill of the hunt which is generally worthless if they already got Ruin or whatever. Survivors only tend to ignore dull totems. And thats only half the time.
---
Think of it like this: run up to a gen, meg SB away so there's no point in chasing. 
---
She comes back to work on the gen and for an additional x seconds on the gen + normal exhaustion time she won't be recovering her perk.
---
Same thing with balanced on certain gens. The 3 seconds isn't the useful part so much as the general delay in exhaustion
---
Swap shaggy/Freddy imo (Dwight is a leader plus I think jake looks more like shaggy)
---
I think it's a glitch, I had a couple of daily rituals just disappear on me before as well
---
Right click cycles through bottle, grenade launcher and sticky launcher. There are ammo packs on the map that you need to reload.
---
It doesn't really fix facecamping anyway, if the Killer is camping one Survivor, the other Survivors already have enough time to crank out the generators unless the one getting camped literally went down instantly.
---
If you can run the Killer for 30 seconds and get facecamped for two minutes then all five generators should be done by the time you're dying. 14 extra seconds won't help *anyone*, it'd just be time wasted off a generator to travel to you and back.
---
I love surveillance since they reworked it, I'll work it into certain builds. Helps me figure out if a survivor beat feet or simply found a good hidey hole near the gen
---
So it’s just gone right? They won’t just pop back?
---
Remember that it centers on the gen, so you'll have to plan accordingly.
---
People have been talking up tinkerer with it, seems decent
---
i dont even like pennywise so there might be a little bias in here but honestly he just wouldnt even fit in the game anyways because he can literally do ANYTHING which would make sense and as you said hes an entity
---
Nope they're gone, gotta wait till tomorrow for a new 1
---
your smart
---
wait is there no /s on this
---
Somebody gets unhooked with Dstrike. If they hop into a locker, you have to grab them and they get the stun off and run. If you don't grab them, they get to heal if inner strength is active. It's a lose lose and you just have to abandon them. Normally you could just slug them to avoid the dstrike or let them sit in the locker injured but it got even harder.
---
I don't see it unseating adrenaline in the meta build but people might drop borrowed time or unbreakable or something.
---
Not really. Inner Strength applies upon entering the locker and Iron Maiden applies upon exiting the locker, so they don't really interact. And even if it happens, unless you're a Omega Nurse having a revealed, exposed survivor across the map doesn't help you.
---
I was assuming closer to $15 because it's licensed content and they might have a few basic extra cosmetics tossed in, they probably want people to buy the entire DLC and not just put money into Auric cells though, so it could be an even $12.
---
calm spirit doesn't counter Iron Maiden because Calm Spirit prevents you from giving a scream notification but does nothing to stop aura reading which is what Iron Maiden does
---
Yesterday I got a Plague, trapper, Hag, and Billy
---
well his perks seems really meh
---
Personal opinions on two of them.
---
**Bond** \&gt; Better Together.
---
Surge's radius is easily outran unless you have a one-hit down (survivors get enough of a speed boost when hit by a regular M1).
---
Distortion is a lot more useful because the chances of running into BBQ and chili or Nurse's calling and to a lessor extent bitter murmur are much much higher than running into a group of survivors who constantly use lockers.
---
I was getting a little bored of dead by daylight mainly because I feel like the formula needed to be changed somehow and I was a bit disappointed not getting Sydney as a survivor with ghostface(for license reasons)
---
Not only are these survivors exciting to play as, but the entire premise of Strangers Things coming into the game is exciting and refreshing! 
---
I really like the respective perks as they fit to their character. 
---
Kate is always going to be my bby girl but wow inner strength/Better thing + Nancy bias is going to make me a Nancy Main for sure! 
---
What perks would you combine with Nancy’s perks out of curiosity?
---
Reeeeeeeeeee
---
I once camped a survivor because he tried to teabag me at a fake pallet!
---
Sniper Shock Add-ons
---
-Unnerving Presence
---
-Distressing
---
-Overcharge
---
-Ruin
---
Patrol the 3 gens closest to ruin. Snipe any and everyone. You'll get the Claudettes walking up to you asking to kill them in no time. ;)
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
A ton first console or PC?
---
If the killer is good enough they will know that you have no mither, I mean if you will injured the entire game, they just won't see your broken status effect.
---
I still love him
---
Yes, so you’re likely to get it once or twice, depending how many other survivors are running it. 
---
Also the time finding a totem, cleansing, finding a locker and waiting in it for the duration to heal would probably take like a decent percentage a gen could’ve been repaired. Not sure how anybody would even complain about the perk lol
---
It doesnt look like it has a reduced movement speed, it's only reduced if you hold it down, I think you instantly jump if you just click
---
Case in point
---
Inner strength / Head on / DS / adrenaline 
---
New meta
---
it doesnt have to be an infinite, plus the timing on this is more luck based rather than just initiating it cuz the elevator has its own routine and to know what the routine is at all times youd have to basically camp near it, which no ones gonna do
---
Still more rewarding when you double pip and recieve all iridescent  but you can’t do that if you don’t prevent all gen completion.  Though redeeming oneself in that manner is satisfying.
---
For what? Killer or survivor?
---
Well I actually like BBQ and chili. I use it to trick killers into thinking I’m going one way and run in the opposite direction. I always assume killers are using BBQ and chili or discordance.
---
It’s parody
---
Nah. I reject this and choose to believe that it was shit. It’s funnier that way.
---
You've never seen a surv get shamed for running strong perks? Have you never been on this sub before. Old MoM, old Ds, people used to complain about sprint burst a lot, so many survivor perks are called "crutch perks" because killers want an excuse to explain why they are inept at killing, and so they look at a strong perk and throw "crutch" at it all the time.
---
I think he ghost edited survivor or it was in the body of the post the whole time
---
11 to 12 usd calling it now
---
Yeah, one shot killers
---
i would argue ,i am not saying he is bad ,but he does seems like a weaker hag to me
---
his pros:
---
\-good hex protector
---
\-good overall map control
---
his cons:
---
\-his powers doesnt really help against looping
---
\-his size gonna make it hard to mind game survivors at certain loops
---
\-his powers dont really slow the game 
---
\-his portals waste time when youre setting them and when youre teleporting 
---
\-his power act like a portal,meaning you need to be on one in order to be ably to tp so if youre in a chase you cant really use your power to apply pressure on survivors and switch targets like the hags does
---
Bro you touch a flashlight and people call you toxic 😂 despite the fact that it’s the item most easily countered
---
It will be 11.99$
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
Never have.
---
HEY! You forgetting surveillance!
---
It doesn't need to be. There's an ass load of perks in this game already that are completely useless in competitive play but are fun to use when you're just fuckin around.
---
Something tells me you like to put weird things in your butthole.
---
Actually I like starting off injured with no mither so I can run my fast as fuck gen build with resilience. Honestly it doesn’t matter if the killer sees that you have it or not once they figure it out it’s the same tunnel vision. Is it gonna give you one extra hit before done for the whole match? Yeah but if you’re worried about not getting a fair amount of time alive due to running No Mither run D Strike, Unbreakable and just jump into a locker or force them to let you get up fast or tank a d strike.
---
Those perks can be buffed too
---
only cucumbers laced with humus
---
Mindbreaker, Surge, Overcharge, Hex Ruin
---
Need I say more
---
Actually its really good. Considering that you can just cleanse any totem at the start of the match and have a pocket heal for whenever you're injured and find a locker. Hell, once you have the perk active and also DS and you get unhooked and chased if you can get into a locker the Killer can effectively not win that scenario. Love how powerless the supposed powerrole can be made to be.
---
You forgot to replace Whispers with Stridor lol
---
Play wraith and practice hitting people. I used to miss 90% of my swings. 500 hours later and now I only miss 87%.
---
I prefer wasabi.
---

Weird things happen in "Dead By Daylight" all the time, like sometimes a killer becoming more interested in helping than hurting (or at least whatever plausibly counts as "helping", as far as killers go). Dwight and Ash here are trying their hardest to repair this generator, but not even Ash's mighty screwdriver finger seems to be working. Can Wraith's attempt to cheer them on, with the help of some friends, push them both to victory?
---

Game parody pages tend to be pretty fun to draw, and I have to say the last panel may have one of the funnier things I've ever done.
---
[i](NOTE: The person posting this on Reddit was specifically the comic's writer.)[/I]
---
It takes 80 seconds to repair a generator, assuming no perks, toolboxes, or multiples. 85% of 80 seconds is 68 seconds meaning that Billy has 12 seconds to get to the generator that procced Tinkerer. Most of the time Billy has shit to do, making it an opportunity cost to have to break off the chase, orient himself and zip over there.
---
I’d rather get camped by a Insidious Leatherface then click that link.
---
Yeah... I guess. it's only until 50% though, which is literally seconds for a swf team.
---
Injured without being chased is anytime you escaped or most times you are unhooked and the other survivor runs off. 
---
Finding a single dull totem is easy and can be done in advance of being injured at the start of the match to prime the perk. That is quick. 
---
Lockers are basically everywhere. They are easy to find in any jungle gym or major landmark. 
---
A quick heal or two should be easy to get with this perk. 
---
I do agree that we will have to see if this perk is actually going to be made into the meta and regularly used. It would absolutely counter thanotophobia or sloppy butcher or even Nurse’s Calling. What would be a 45 second self heal could be a 8 second heal primed in advance with a 20 second full totem. You are cutting time in half, but most of the time spent is when you are not in a chase and time is not as critical (gens are more spread out and there is less pressure). It is absolutely a worthwhile perk.
---
he is nothing like Freddy and his power works in completely different ways
---
I just wish they wouldnt release single maps into the pool so that you never get them
---
But shittydarksouls is still active.
---
Are you a partner of rockstar games? No. Then stfu
---
What do you think about Deerstalker instead of Whispers?
---
If they got the actors, he probably would.
---
But they didn't, so he won't.
---
That was slick
---
George RR martins new novel, what the fuck my guy.
---
Huh?
---
Spine Chill is better
---
The perk build I could think of is head on, quick and quiet, and inner strength.
---
True very true.  That was another problem I thought about as well with having to find totems once you’re safe and staying safe until you find a locker.  So in the end I agree that healing yourself might  be better.
---
I currently play on Xbox and hope we get cross play with Psn just for the queue times. I’m grinding up a million BP for the ST chapter right now too!
---
Maybe the rank 13 and 16 were doing gens while the other two were distracting the killer.
---
Why on Earth would you ever want to force more people to hear my voice?
---
I'm pretty sure that what he's talking about is the person is visably injured while in the match but it doesn't show injured/broken on the status bar.
---
This is STILL going to be a hard no from me from a survivors viewpoint this shit sounds busted as fuck especially with other perk combos and the new perks coming out in the next few weeks. If my friends and I ran these perks with the bullshit suggestions that people make on the daily, we would curb stomp every killer and make them look like bitches. It would become boring, unfun and uninteresting to play. 
---
The people that make these absurd suggestions forget that other perks exist and new ones will be coming.
---
exactly. id rather have new strong perks instead of having to use the same meta perks over and over whenever i choose to do a survivor game
---
I am more interested in combining it with something like surveillance or overcharge. Instantly get a lot of regression and information without having to interact with the gens directly.
---
hahahahaaaaa...your hope won't save you
---
My spirit has Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, BBQ and Chili and Stridor/Franklins/Corrupt intervention/Thrilling Tremors And is far spookier And has a Kawaii cute as fuck school girl outfit. 
---
Also I have 30 Ebony Mories on her, 25 prayer beads, and 40 of her pink addons and 40 of her considerably increases charge time 😍 
---
 
---
It’s okay though cause I never use those Mori’s or prayer beads lmfao.
---
the demogorgon is the first testing ground of the two new stealth mechanics they are adding in. After teleporting, he gets the undetectable status, and while survivors are trying to break his portals, they get the oblivious status.
---
surge  could be alright in maps like the game and maybe institute but beyond that it's pretty underwhelming perk
---
I said weaker perks could be buffed, not sent into orbit...
---
These are really cool perks except for Cruel Confinement. It makes finishing gens in a critical situation VERY unrewarding, especially in inside building maps. It’ll be really frustrating to play when you’re in a tight space or when gens are close to each other.
---
Take out Lullaby, our Thrilling Tremors. And probably Overcharge too, at high ranks people won’t miss it and if they do it’ll only be because the perk is so bad they aren’t use to killers running it, so they’ll only miss once. Maybe Corrupt Intervention if you want to really only your skill, what you can do in 180 seconds. 
---
With Inner Strength it seems hex perks will get somewhat a nerf. Survivors will do totems much more often now, possibly. And if they do that’s also good for killer, as you get 70+ seconds more (5 totems x 14 sec, not including travel and search time. And time wasted if a totem isn’t found). 
---
Haunted Grounds will basically be buffed, so what you can do is Infectious Fright and Haunted Grounds so you can go for the slug if possible. Put that with Confinement and if there’s another survivor in terror radius then you’ve got to guys slugged. Deerstalker and/or Nurses Calling for a slugger build (ignore salty survivors, I don’t have a problem with sluggers). Even though that’s a bit off topic to the gen protection build, just something to think about.
---
Wont fixated make you faster than alot of killers? Thats kinda op
---
It was the beginning of a pattern with Ash. If they get the likeness, they get the voice as well, especially with how much they pushed the fact that it was really Bruce.
---
Nobody thought it was **ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED** that we'd get the same for Stranger Things, but you have to at least see why some people expected it to happen and might have been disappointed.
---
Would it be posible to get healed from no mither if u have second wind ? That sounds interesting
---
Only purchase the killer if you dont give a shit about the show. Killer perks are very strong.
---
Survivor perks are basically flip flop 2-7. They are all conditional and there is far better options.
---
MoM, WGLF , Babysitter and Borrowed time/ second wind is gonna be prime Steve build
---
Unrelated but pro tip for Haunted Ground is if you think it’s haunted ground or an even sneakier devour hope totem just wait until you see someone go from healthy to injured and then start cleansing it. If they get hit they were insta down regardless, if they go after someone else that’s still only one person downed and hooked which would’ve been the same outcome anyways. 
---
Don’t flock together and you’re golden. Also those new perks look fun can’t wait. Oh side note No Mither hard counters being exposed. ;)
---
Yikes, I forgot that the new surge of popularity would bring *these* people too.
---
What about solidarity?
---
"So if I play GTA I can't make GTA related merchandise, fuck off"...
---
Self-Care will still be the way to go if you're only concern is healing yourself. Self-Care takes 32 seconds from start to finish. Inner Strength requires you to find a totem (which in itself could take upwards of 20 seconds even if you're lucky), spend 14 seconds cleansing, run to a locker (another couple seconds), and then wait 8 seconds for it to finish healing you. If you're really lucky Inner Strength might work faster, but Self-Care is significantly more consistent and on average will be better.
---
at whats ranks you playing that survivors dont do totems? survivors nowadays even do dull totem
---
You need to be on PC to get that perk. They had it a few months back...
---
You’d only gain 20% more distance you’d gain from walking, and if you’re not making mistakes, they’ll never even come close to pulling another speed burst out of their ass.
---
I enjoyed it. You dedicated a lot of work into this and did a great job! Excellent concept imo
---
For people who don't understand the context.
---
On the Stranger Things Reveal dev stream, the devs talked a bit about the making of Demogorgon and how Netflix sent over the mesh for Demo for Behaviour to modify. The mesh was smaller than dwight, so they had to "beef him up."
---
&lt;3
---
This guy was on the design team AND is on the best competitive team in the world, better listen to him
---
I don’t ever use them, I enjoy the swfs personally, they are much more fun and challenging then the solo queues
---
I do not consider her ugly from that angle either. She looks good.
---
Called it. Babysitter perk
---
But what do you even do since he doesn't need you in the dream to hit you?

Oh yeah it'll fit well in any anti-gen build. With pop goes the weasel as well
---
No need when you're 3-genning. Ruin WILL get cleansed in 30 seconds every time I've ran ANY hex perk that wasn't NOED, and Dying Light slows them down even more + lasts the rest of the match allowing you to win the war of attrition.
---
8 seconds at tier 3
---
Basically gonna be playing Steve for the hair and Nancy for the perks lmao
---
I was really hoping for Lifeguard Billy -_-
---
I just went on there an now I want to die
---
congrats
---
He’s fucking rek’sai!?!
---
Eh. I’ve mained doctor to rank 1 for 2 years now and dying light isn’t consistent enough, with a Mori yeah but tunneling isn’t super fun. By the time they get down to the last few gens PGTW And Sloppy make doing anything take forever. With the doctors built in tracking (I prefer restraint) you can see where people are and know when they’re starting to try to work on a gen that’s not nearby. Even 30 seconds of survivors wasting time finding ruin is 30 seconds 4 different survivors couldn’t maximize great skill checks and progress on gens so it’s still a win in my book.
---
So, does Second Wind wait for a mend status to be resolved?
---
Iron Maiden makes you scream, revealing your location. It doesn't show auras.
---
It was the Demogroot from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2
---
Brilliant.
---
Machine gun build, nurses calling changes, shadowborn, brutal strength, sloppy butcher, unrelenting, tinkerer was gutted, Thanatophobia, BBQ with lockers blocking auras, Remeber me, literally Freddy himself for two years and poor Legion
---
Please go on aboi t how killers were never touched
---
Bet, Cruel Confinement is going to be a new meta killer perk. Seriously it sounds just as essential as BBQ or Ruin.
---
Let the salt flow through you Anakin
---
OMG thank you, I was expecting Survivors mains to complain about how The Shadow was too op or how the "Hex: I put a spell on you" was op as well. but I really appreciate it, you just made my whole day 💖
---
Has happened to me countless times. Hoping for a fix soon.
---
It's a troll. Move along
---
surprised you're not being down voted into oblivion. a lot of killer mains on here are definitely suffering from some sort of superiority complex where they intentional try to ruin peoples day and be a dickhead, the same killers you'll see who say something like "GG EZ 4K TRASH SURVIVORS LOL U SUCK" when the survivors all rank 15 and have no idea how to even play.
---
How do you know which version is the current one?
---
My man otz. Love your streams, man
---
Sounds cool, but I’d like to see him get perks
---
this is perfect
---
The flashlight isn’t centered on your screen, it has a weird angle you’ll kinda just have to feel out yourself by watching the beam.
---
Never try to blind the killer unless you know for sure they’re going to be stuck stationary; usually only breaking a pallet or picking up a survivor.
---
If you’re doing a flashlight save as they pick some up up, wait just a second after they start picking them up. You *can* do it too early which will blind the killer but not make them drop the survivor.
---
I ain't readin all of that
---
Bro the new players perks are litty
---
I don't remember any discussions on the dbd forum about flashlights, but I surely remember billions about noed, mories and etc
---
Then how about the ability to swap them out for similar rarity items?  I'm never going to use Prayer Fragments but I wouldn't be against more Limestone Seals or Olibanum Incense.

considering the fact that 90% of the totems spawn is near genz ...

is alot more punishing to try random new build as a killer considering the fact that ranking swarming with sweaty swf

Which character are you going to use it on?
---
I hope you enjoy your Bloodpoints Ted
---
I’m with you, the map is definitely interesting. I get Five from cod zombies vibes, but that’s just me.
---
We can agree to disagree but the bottom line of my original reply was that not every perk needs to be meta in order for it to be viable or fun to have/use.
---
For example, that new perk that heals you after sitting in a locker because you rubbed some skulls... completely useless in the first few weeks. Add that shit to your loadout after the new content craze dies down and it's stupidly broken when your whole team isn't using it. As it stand now, 5 totems, 4 people using the perk they all get 1 free heal. 1 person, quick and quiet and that perk can waste a huge amount of your time for free. It's broken but won't be meta and is only going to be beneficial for 1 person in the long run after the hype dies.
---
That's basically how all the useless perks work now. They only benefit 1 person but don't need to be buffed to be useful to them. It's a meme perk for fun.
---
As we all know, when confronted by a Vengeful Japanese Ghost,
---
Power Walk Away!
---
....Is that not giving someone information as spirit? You're standing still, so you're either phasing or just standing there baiting them. With this shit logic no pallet or window is mindgame able either, because you either get hit or don't get hit.
---
Was that when his stealth was impossible to be broken out of?
---
Whats a 360 balanced landing? I thought balanced landing activated on its own?
---
Why did he touch the gen before unhooking?
---
Why did the hook have a skillcheck?
---
Oh man am I excited.
---
Yeah it looks like the lab area on five I can agree with you on that.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted without explanations here. Steve's perks are garbage and I will never use them. Nancy's, however, make room for great mind games possibilities.
---
Perfect answer for everything:
---
"Cry me a river"
---
Pain Reliever too, he’s kinda soothing.
---
What everybody else sees: 8 SECOND SELF CARE WHILE HIDING IN A LOCKER, NOED COUNTER, LET'S GOOOOOO
---
What I see: Getting hit. Breaking chase (or getting hooked). Looking for a totem (if there are even any left). Finding a locker. Sitting in there doing nothing for 8 seconds. Pray for no Iron Maiden and continue on.
---
While it sounds great on paper, it might end up wasting even more time than Self Care. Though it's great to have in your back pocket if you end up spawning near a totem at the beginning of the match.
---
I don't think Pop will work with it. I think Pop will need you to kick he gen to activate otherwise it would be an insane combination. And if you are already regressing perks, you can't kick them.
---
I love this
---
Is it Bubba?
---
Is she like, almost T posing ?
---
Nice
---
And even then. I ran OoO when Ghostface was released, and still got exposed because of how the exposure works. Yeah I still saw him coming, but Calm Spirit counters doc, so why can't OoO just counter Ghostface?
---
I'm just a simple huntress main and I guess you're correct. This and iron will are unstoppable, I just hope this doesn't completely make her useless.
---
I don’t think people actively clean NOED itself unless it’s by accident. Since usually people just clean all totems for before NOED triggers.
---
Claud is trying too hard to blend in not ur fault
---
Thanks for being oh so helpful
---
I’d say make it more like unbreakable 1.5 healthy until you pick yourself up and then permanent injured but still able to get back up.
---
I wasn’t. I was just so impressed. But thanks for the detailed summary.
---
no
---
Its really bad on the survivor side for some reason. Obviously you get some sweaty killers as well but its not nearly as bad. Maybe its due to the fact you encounter 4x the players as killer but it does seem worse either way. Best to just drop a gg and leave immediately sadly.
---
If you own him, definitely just level him up. It's not great to start with, plus you already have a method of getting it without paying rn.
---
It’s gamers’ version of exaggeration, like when basic white girls say “that is literally my favorite thing ever”.
---
Sorry that not every player is a born monto and dares to heal more then once :/
---
but why :(
---
Yeah this community is up there for the worse ive been in
---
Just ignore the messages and play how you wanna play(Just dont camp unless gates are open)
---
Oooh yeah, like you could mantle up edges, following the same places survivors can jump down such as windows.
---
Inner strength is going to op unless bhvr pulls that stick out of their ass and finally buff iron maiden
---
Hooked 3 Dwight's before you kissed a girl.
---
I'm Nurse your Bubba, I'm Ace your Nea.
---
Beating you is GG too EZ
---
Holy shit he can do that
---
Demodwight when
---
TFW noed's nerf is just incentives to get survivors to finally do bones
---
Kindred trumps the Killer's stealth abilities. Tier 1 Michael isn't stealth, he's just Michael and Michael trumps detection perks. So it makes perfect sense.
---
I didnt know until then but yeah
---
ya that perk has always obviously never been worth the tradeoff
---
my main account is banned hhere already, coz the community here are fucking dickhheaded mothertitsuckers who get offended by any word
---
I remember when he first came into PS4 I’d stare right at him and it wouldn’t break. Must have overcompensated. It’s fine now though which is good.
---
Mmmm, I’ll bet.
---
Not really poorly written, people just don't really pay attention to the wording. Kindred trumps the Killer's stealth abilities. Tier 1 Michael isn't stealth, he's just Michael and Michael trumps detection perks. So it makes perfect sense.
---
Sadly, no. But they were able to get his hair's stunt dpuble
---
you've finally acheieved the purpose of DBD. you're free!
---
what?
---
This may surprise you, but this is an open forum where anyone is free to comment.
---
y'all do know you have to fully heal *another* survivor for it to work right?  like it requires so many things
---
1. a survivor be injured
---
2. you, and only you, heal them, otherwise you don't fully charge the perk and it isn't active, and you must heal someone else when they're injured
---
3. get hooked and unhooked, and stay out of the terror radius
---
4. healed

Perhaps they spent a small fortune obtaining the license and just didn't have the money to go all in or there wasn't much there to for them to say. BHVR is still a small studio. 
---
With Bruce, you want his dialog. He makes the character. I laughed hard the first time I heard him say  "look who's shitting in the tall grass".  I don't care if they do the voices or not. I can't imagine they're saying much. Laurie Strode is a popular character and they didn't get Curtis. Nor does she say anything.
---
AYE you know their the most badass
---
More like Demogorgan and Myers
---
there needs to be a suicide option for survivor that counts as a hook and sacrifice for the killer and lets the survivor keep all their bps
---
I really cant understand the people calling Inner Strenght a NoED Counter.
---
What? You will just recently now start popping totems because you can sometimes heal because of it? Im calling it now: it will be a rough month after DLC where nobody does the fucking Gens because they're searching for totems that no longer exist because another one of the players already popped it
---
You know whats a Anti-NOED perk? Small Game, and I assure ya, if its not me using it, or that perks that lets Detective Tapp see totems after completing gens, nobody is fucking cleasing them.
---
I really hope you are all in the right with this one, because I despise NOED, a lot, I would gladly accept people finally cleansing the fucking totems if that doesnt mean to just throw away the game by gifting free momentum. But If im honest, I dont think this is going to change anything, we well just stack it with Small Game in a closet like every other fun perk that isnt the same 4 Meta-Shits.
---
As long as you plan ahead, you can ALWAYS get two perks per level from 40 and up. More than 2 perks appear, so you may not get the two that you want, but you can always get two if you prepurchase properly to set yourself up to get two.
---
it's called A posing dink donk
---
STEVE THE HAIR HARRINGTON!!
---
He's super toxic in all his videos, he's a jerk in that context
---
Fixated is the new perk that lets you see your own scratch marks as a survivor and walk 10/15/20% faster right? I just wanna make sure we're on the same page here.
---
This has happened to me numerous times (but thankfully not for a while...) I hope they fix it soon, because it’s super annoying.
---
It's an extreme buff to the 3-gen strat. It will be interesting to see how badly it can affect survivors.
---
The most Pig main person you'll ever find uses Enduring, Whispers, Brutal Strength and Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
I thogh lery doorways and windows were dead enough with him but nope he just looks through a little crack and slaps you
---
Im sorry you dont find it funny. But some of us do. I started the whole idea. Do i think it will actually happen? Lol no but still fun and funny to joke about it happening.
---
Yes. All I wish is that you still go 20% faster while injured.
---
Right now it turns off if you get hurt
---
That’s what urban evasion used to do. Back then it was hot garbage. Not even meme tier.
---
Fixated is still gonna be good for scratch marks, it sure ain’t trash, but it just seems like an unnecessary restriction
---
I always trigger Sprint Burst by accident. Always. I never run it because I just use it to sprint into a cornfield by accident
---
No
---
I mean yeah, that's true, but ya gotta admit some Steve and Nancy voice lines from the actors themselves would have been cool. I wonder how much they would have wanted to do it for
---
Normally in Canada the chapters are $11,
---
3 gen doc is getting aroused by the surge perk
---
Spoken like a true non-altruistic survivor. 
---
I'm stoked, because this will make altruism plays so much better!
---
Cause he cool now shut up
---
a killer that can use their power while carrying someone? i hope not
---
Well, now I seem very, very silly.
---
How would second wind work with no mither, given that it heals you while you are broken.
---
*Muffled* heavy breathing
---
Yeah didnt think about it that way
---
And yes,that also works
---
\*hasn't played him or even seen anyone actually use his power yet\*
---
"Excuse me, I want it changed!"
---
They haven't earned the hatch though, if I get gen rushed and have 0 hooks why can't I have one of the survivors at the exit gate just randomly have a heart attack and die or some bs. You need to earn it, its unfair and lame to do well and lose some well earned prey because of this whole hatch mess.
---
It is if you aren’t playing the meta killers. I’m a rank 1 killer pretty much every season and it isn’t rare to have 2-3 gens pop by the time you down a survivor as say, Trapper or Wraith.
---
Believe me. I hate using meta builds as they get boring but when it gets to the point where you need certain perks to even have a chance at getting a kill it’s kinda ridiculous.
---
If that's the information you gather from the comment then probably your way of thinking is wrong/inefficient
---
“You’re literally fucking garbage dude. Spamming the fucking map with a chainsaw, you’re so ass bruh. And you wouldn’t have even caught me if I didn’t go back for that one guy, so yeah don’t think you’re good bitch, fucking ass”
---
AHAHAHAHA THAT PETK IS SO BAD NOT EVEN NO MITHER MAINS USE IT
---
So far
---
are we about to enter a golden age of excessively altruistic dwights running this with head on?
---
Update: I did play a match with this build to vent my anger after being bullied by 3 toxic swfs in a row
---
Sorry I didn’t mean to put console. Lmao I just realised what I put. Let me edit it.
---
I get the feeling Dead Hard is going to be more meta than Mindbreak tbh. Especially since Mindbreaker is mostly just there to stall the CD provided the exhausted person touches a gen thats &lt;50% complete already.
---
I'm glad to hear you still like the killer idea, what do you think of the other perks in general?
---
If you're buying a game you dont expect it to change 
---
RIP metal of man
---
Self care creates REALLY bad habits though. Survivors get hit and go sit in the corner of the map and heal for 32 seconds, then go get hit again rinse and repeat. Running adrenaline is a better plan, and if you really need that heal, get someone to heal you real quick
---
You can always max out, spend 100k and repeat. You can still get your Myers brutal strength and still get 1mil for Steve.
---
Put this on freddy with "people can't wake up by failing skillchecks" and "increased missed skillcheck penalty when dreaming"
---
I didn't I thought my friend was being chased. He didnt say anything next thing you know I'm just getting smacked in the head and im on the floor. I was like "oh. I know who it is now guys"
---
I know the feeling - I lost progress at 300 hours and received 33 000 000 blood points. It took me a week to spend it all and I couldn’t play till I spent them all since I wouldn’t receive any more bps. I did manage to get all the teachables and both a p3 Claud and Nurse all perks.
---
Imagine being toxic only 5 days into getting the game
---
Takes most people months
---
Gee, I wonder why...
---
Doc. If you play him right with distressing (the heart perk that increases deviousness) you can get a hefty sum of bp. I got 96k but i think i may have had an extra boost or something.
---
Maps shouldn’t matter because they’re free
---
People seem to think Steve’s perks are great for SWF from reading other comments but I can’t imagine how, Baby sitter seems below average as most of the time if the killer is too far away to see where the injured survivors tracks lead you’d be better off without it just healing you your teammate and moving on and if he’s close enough to see where the injured person’s tracks lead it’s just going to be ignored. Camaraderie seems mediocre, if the killer is camping to the point where you need camaraderie you’d probably rather just take borrowed time only seems good in very niche scenarios and the bonus doesn’t seem to even help much in the intended scenarios. The last one is mediocre, it punishes teammate’s for safely saving you as they then can’t heal you and get points, it punishes teammates for saving you while in a dangerous situation as the killer will just smack you down, it’d be much better for the team to run we’ll make it or you individually run self care which has much more broader uses even if it’s slightly lower and limits you a little more  (also you can still just get quickly healed by a teammate) .
---
It depends on the survivors. If they are very altruistic then you probably won’t need it. If they are smart and do the objective you do need it. Unfortunately you can’t tell which category they fall into until the game starts.
---
Ruin is used to buy time. If the survivors are optimal then the game could be over in a matter of minutes. Ruin is a band-aid fix which is usually gone within a minute of the game starting, but that time it was up is precious for killers.
---
The killer doing well all comes down to the survivors. A killer with thousands of hours still has to deal with looping and relies on the Survivors’ mistakes and capitalized on it.
---
Ghost face is spoopy and oh god the horrors of scratched mirror Myers
---
&gt; considering the fact that 90% of the totems spawn is near genz ... 
---
that's more of a thing that gens and totems have a similar spawning pattern.
---
a totem can spawn for each tile. every tile has exactly one totem spot and you can expect a totem in each corner of the map and one in the middle (sometimes they are closer to the center of the wall)
---
gens spawn... one in the middle and 6 closer to either walls or corners
---
yEs
---
I can foresee a perk that makes survivors oblivious while cleansing totems. Would work really well with Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Don't you still become exposed though? I see what you're saying but it's not an 100% counter
---
Yeah when your usually waiting for specific perks
---
Yeah. I found that sub somehow, I honestly don't remember. Sent some of the pics to my regular group I play SWF with. We had some laughs. I'll never go back though...
---
Actually camping is a terrible way to get kills.  You *will* get one (if you do it right) but no more.  If you actually play the game youll probably have more fun, and get more kills!  
---
Also try playing survivor so you know how shitty facecamping is.
---
Yeah doing counters isn’t very effective imo. Choose perks based on your play style is much more effective.
---
One time perk
---
I'd really have to play around with them to know.
---
I'll for sure tell you that something tiering up like "1/2/2" is not how BHVR does things anymore
---
also, one survivor perk ranks down for some reason
---
I know but I don’t have bbq yet and generatiors are being done too fast so I’m pleased with a kill or two max
---
Steve because I want that second wind
---
This is a bad take
---
I thought using her crouch makes her terror radius completely goes away
---
You dont need BBQ!  Just make sure you patrol the gens.  The more people you hit, the less theyll do gens.  At the beginning of the game, walk to the furthest generator, and then go in a circle.  Make sure you keep your volume up and eyes open!
---
you don't have to but okay.
---
The Flesh version
---
there's actually no risk.
---
both sides (EAC and BHVR) told us they don't mind us doing that
---
Right here, with Haunted Grounds.
---
That means Dwight is actually 12 ft tall, and everything in the entity realm is out of proportion to reality.
---
The entity is really bad at recreation of scale.
---
Camping is the worst way to get bp and experience. You wont improve at all if youre just camping the whole time.
---
it is, barbecue and chili. It shows you the aura of the survivors that are 40 + meters from the hook after you hook a survivor, and adds 25% extra blood points up to 100. It’s very useful for killers such as hillbilly as you can chainsaw over to the aura quickly; but is very useful on all killers
---
I always feel like shirtless David King with a battle mullet could just beat up Legion or Ghostface
---
Or good at following through corn
---
Now I’ve seen everything
---
Holy crap. I've never watched stranger things but these perks are amazing.
---
What perks do you have on her? If you’re having trouble finding survivors I’d recommend Discordance and Surveillance. Discordance so you’ll know when 2 of them are on a gen together and surveillance when they hop back on a gen you’ve kicked. Whispers is also good as it lets you know when survivors are and aren’t nearby, thus wasting less time. Hope that helps.
---
If you want to use those perks, just use Q&amp;Q, Dance With Me and Lithe together for the Houdinni build.
---
I believe that, if you want to use Urban Evasion and Fixated, you should combine it with an Exhaustion Perk and Iron Will.
---
Why the nobodys tho
---
wow so cool
---
Even still, after you surge a generator nearby, hook them and then kick another you're ravaging gens
---
Patch notes:      
---
•Gave legion a Stinger.        
---
*”Fuck You, that’s why.”*            
---
-*BHVR* team
---
That’s even better, when they message you post game with their salt and you know you haven’t been toxic or sweaty and they just complain anywas😂
---
He shat my dude
---
Adrenaline trumps all other heal perks at high ranks
---
And self-care is the best for low ranks since killers suck and you can afford to waste time
---
This perk, the other new one and pharmacy are just wasted perk slots because if you want limited fast heals you just bring a good medkit in the first place.
---
Yeah, you can just lose every game instead.
---
And it’s a bigger title right now, so Netflix prolly wants them to pay more for the DLC
---
Tbh, if this dlc is more money than the others, it wouldn't matter seeing as Stranger Things fans are going to buy it no matter what. The thing is, this is the biggest chapter where Behavior will gain a lot, now my last concern is if we are actually going to keep the new players rolling in because of it, or will the mechanics/aspect of the game drive them away after trying out that of the Dlc.
---
Self care is slow AS FUCK though, especially if you plan on using it multiple times in a round. I think you can have all your healing bases covered with inner strength and like a brown med kit
---
&gt;Pennywise isn't human, nor is he an actual clown. Pennywise is the form "It" likes to take to lure children into the sewers.
---
Neither is Demogorgon yet it came to be. 
---
&gt;"It" is an entity, just like THE Entity. It just doesn't make sense to have two entities in the same realm.
---
An entity is defined simply as an existence. Technically all of the Surviviors are entities. 
---
&gt;That would be like having both god and the devil ruling heaven/hell.
---
False comparison.
---
Classic hammeredshark. The only broken perk being added is inner strength. Imo they should remove the closet all together. After all the ate old saying goes you can run but your cant hide.
---
I’ve seen people say that Corrupt Intervention is good for Hag / Trapper since they have time to pick some generators to defend, set traps, all the while survivors can’t really do much besides find the 1 generator they can actually do.
---
Well at least the bloodweb changes are coming in to mitigate some of the grind. Granted most seem to feel the changes are pretty underwhelming.  Personally I think getting more perk options in each web will make getting builds on a few characters a lot easier.
---
That means you get no warning that the demogorgon is running up to ambush you while disarming it's tunnels.
---
Freddy doesn't have any cosmetics. Demogorgon doesn't need them either.
---
inner strength and second wind aren't THAT great. both have uses in swf and completely useless in solo. you are better off running self care instead of using any of these.
---
babysitter is another perk that only helps in swf, where you have that one teammate you are teaching the game to. very weird to see swf perks like these, as if the devs want to convey something to us.....
---
fixated is pretty good, for anyone interested in learning how the killer tracks you, but I don't see any use for it in red ranks, since most pro survivors already know how to trick killers. the movespeed bonus is good though.
---
the other two are probably the worst. one won't even have any chance of being useful since most killers have mori/rancor/devourhope these days. the other is just an inferior version of bond, which is way better because it allows you to see survivor auras unconditionally.
---
We are still in shock.
---
I'm sorry you ask dumb questions
---
Don't sleep on Discordance. It's really good on almost every killer
---
People are finally going to start using small game
---
Nurse, Billy, Spirit, and Freddy are the strongest in the game because they have map pressure AND an ability that helps end chases quicker. 
---
I feel like with how he is now, the demogorgon will be a pretty average killer.
---
I facecamped against a ttv just now and 4kd
---
Am i the only one that's waiting for Jū-On?
---
Lol I think I mad the child angry.
---
That's a lot of assuming there.
---
Nice.
---
His hair asserts dominance already but the t-pose vaporizes the killer
---
The devs said this, multiple times lol.
---
That sounds a lot like "We have no idea how to fix anything at this point so we might as well roll fanservice and hope something solves itself."
---
Would fixated work with urban evasion. Paired with print burst ylit would be awesome.
---
There’s a way to play around it as Spirit, which is to just moonwalk up to the gen, but nobody does that. I’ve known about it and I don’t even do it.
---
Holy hell these perks are awesome!!!!
---
I'm fairly convinced that most players will pay ANY AMOUNT for DLC by now. BVHR could and yet may collect newborns for an OP perk.
---
Inner Strength is Nancy's worst perk and probably the second worst perk next to Cuckradarie. You can only use it five times and you have to waste time totem hunting to activate it, and if your teammates do totems instead you're cucked.
---
Surge is easily Demogoron's worst perk since gens are never going to be within 32 meters of eachother if the Survivors have a quarter of a braincell. Saves you a little bit of time so that you don't have to kick shit but you're far better off running Brutal instead.
---
Could see IS taking slightly longer but that's about it.
---
I mean idc but still why you ask they can cosplay any character they want no need to question
---
This happened to me while playing with a friend lol 
---
"Why are you running?? We need to do the gen!?"
---
At the time I couldn't bring myself to say MM is stalking you and could only muster the strength to gasp "No reason"
---
Second Wind does not remove Broken from other perks/effects. (Plague)
---
So no you can't have No Mither and two health states lol.
---
I agree, though I think fixated turning off when injured seems like an unneeded effect
---
I can ask whatever I want because it was an honest question like any other. Things didnt have to escalate but you decided to respond like that.
---
Which is funny bc killer mains would love for Surviviors to have every reason to do totems to stop Noed so they'd stop bitching about it.
---
Survivor decided to “come with me” emote right before I downed her. Then after she gets off the hook, guess who I run into first? Yup. Same survivor. 
---
She tossed the wrong side of a pallet and got downed yet again. 
---
I’m sitting here with a green mori. I think “Do I use it? Nah. I’ll wait for one that’s not so dumb.” So I pick her up to take her to the hook.
---
Decisive Strike. Oh heeeeell naw.
---
Less than 10 seconds after that, she screws up a pallet drop again and gets downed.
---
She got the mori.
---
Ye well have a great day bud
---
If they are breaking one(or just close to one) while you are standing on one yourself, you get a Killer Instinct notification on the survivor's location
---
That's not the point
---
Same to you my friend~
---
Honestly I think people are just wrong about Inner Strength.
---
This isn't a token system, the perk is either active or not. This means players who run the perk are discouraged from cleansing a totem until they've used their heal. This means you're likely to only get a single use out of the perk since your team will likely be cleansing those totems(Either to deny Noed, looking for ruin, or getting their own activation on Inner Strength). Worth noting this also means players are unlikely to deny your activation requirement since they won't want to cleanse two totems without getting the heal to proc. If you start the game getting chased before you find a totem, then your teammates likely already cleansed 2-3 totems. Meaning you'd either have to waste a considerable amount of time in order to gain the benefit of saving time to heal while hiding your aura, or just hope you happen to see one during normal rotations, which means there's a fair chance you won't use it at all in some games. Self heal takes 32 seconds, and medkits or ally heals take 16. If it's taking you more than 8-24 seconds to find a totem, then this perk didn't even do anything for you. 
---
It's honestly a B-tier perk at best for solo players. Though in SWF it's probably an A at least.

Remember, in the livestream, they mentioned how they got spoilers for season 3 as they were working on it. Sooooo
---
Maps are free for us but I assume BHVR still needs to have income for the dev-time spent on maps (which is probably packed into the DLC pricing).
---
I prefer a one shot build with pig. Devour hope, NOED, make your choice, then a perk to help you find people. 
---
I hook someone. Run away and crouch just outside the MYC and DH range. I face the hook and wait. Once they take the bait I go after one of them. 
---
Pig isn't a great killer but has 1 thing going for her...she has built in Hex ruin. People can't do gens if they're running around getting bear traps off.
---
Little hints to do with like the mind flayer and the rats being a thing.
---
Yeah. I'm wondering the same thing. Then again an icon would make the newbies better understand that they are under an effect. But then again, playing against Myers or Ghostface is also probably going to be a shock also for a first-timer.
---
Can’t decide wether I like second wind or inner strength more. I think I’ll make up my mind when I try them out on the ptb
---
Fixated is a lot of fun. I'm always curious what my own scratch marks look like. I run dance with me/lithe, and I'm always curious when exactly 3 seconds has passed that I start leaving scratch marks again, stuff like that. Looks like I'll be putting some points into Nancy.
---
You don’t get a notif when a dull totem is being cleansed
---
But from what I can see it's not just "kicking them all at once" but causes it to explode and does additional regression and THEN regresses as normal.
---
I guess now i read more into them calling them crazy is a bit of an overstatement. Either way my point is that they're pretty good and so are the surv perks.
---
Corrupt intervention is decent for bringing survivors closer to you in the early game. What add ons have you got for her?
---
I can smell some bias.
---
BL will be even more meta now that DH is out of the way lol
---
I feel it'd be a nerf, in a way. I kinda like the static range of it.
---
Honestly, Corn Vision has lost me many kills.
---
Mostly just stuff that increases the duration of corrupt purge so far. I do have the first level of corrupt intervention but that's it.
---
Every killer perk is worthless, as usual
---
I wish they made it so when you unlock a teachable perk it would unlock the first rank by default across all your characters.
---
Hahah. They could potentially stack wonderfully, yeah.
---
Danke
---
Maybe Self-care is a better lone wolf perk, in the end.
---
Cuz he is leaning to me and not standing straight
---

They definitely could.

Power is a little underwhelming from first impressions.

"What makes me a good Demogorgon? If I was a bad demogorgon, **I WOULDN'T BE HERE DISCUSSING IT WITH YA WOULD I!?**"

Keep in mind that killers are *WALKING AT 4.6 METRES A SECOND LIKE IT'S NOTHING*
---
Wow let's quit over an optional DC that we don't even have to purchase. lmao! What a joke.
---
self care died in 2018
---
I'm also rank 1 prove thyself is not that great unless the killer is a potato.
---
I currently am!
---
$40
---
What Nancy? I'm going to do that as Ace and then spend the rest of the game opening chests!
---
Man that sucks!!
---
I don't think in a normal game the killer will notice.
---
Seems kinda boring tbh
---
I'm pretty sure it only triggers once period, like as soon as a survivor triggers it that's it.
---
Each person will probably only get one use per match out of it at best and that’s taking up an entire perk slot to do so.
---
These seem really good and fun
---
Yeah, not gonna lie. Reason I stopped it there is because I couldn’t think of a way to continue it. Don’t see how I can change “Fortune 500 ‘fore you kissed a girl” into a dbd line.
---
GOD DAMMIT BHVR I CAN ONLY HAVE 4 PERKS!
---
&gt;\*stupid enough\*
---
about the hook progression, only \*when the gates are powered.\*
---
If I made the EGC I'd just make it so you can mori people in the end-game or that hooks insta-killed them, but well, that's a bit harsh. I just really don't see how the world is falling apart, you got downed, dragged on a hook and you still have a chance to escape. this makes no sense to me. 
---
When I play survivor and I get hooked in the end game I just straight up kill myself on the hook to make others just leave and stop going for a stupid suicide mission
---
Niche
---
Fucking stalker
---
I’ve never rage quit, so ya fuck them lol
---
He has a point though, different combination of perks can still be good. Sure meta is best but other perks can be up there but not 'best' in terms of theoretical power values meta = 10, other good perks=8 and you can still win. 
---
I don't mind people using meta perks. I can't name a single competitive game that has no meta. it takes a lot to balance strengths thus meta always arises. Having other playable perks is good enough  
---
You assumed you lose every game if not using meta perk
---
Nancy but said
---
True, but imagine comboing it with huge terror radius, infectious fright Myers?
---
T3 is already frightening, now add to it that with every successful hit, Myers just tanking progress while causing pure terror.
---
Not really I mean he deserves that one kill unless he was playing toxic the whole game I usually give the last guy the hatch that's only if I rek the team tho
---
"dear diary, OP was a cool guy today"
---
WGLF, Babysitter, Deliverance and BT would be my go to tbh.
---
It is but I’ve seen many say they have no other choice. Every other survivor can leave except the one that is hooked and they feel the need to get a kill which is understandable.
---
The match was entirely fair up until that point. So this doesn't seem wrong? I never do it as killer
---
https://imgur.com/580k7ip
---
they’re thinking of Iron Will. Calm Spirit reduces the chances of alerting the crows :)
---
Same thing i do, glad im not the only one
---
Literally me
---
Same I love how goofy the pic makes his face look!
---
&gt;Is this not unsportsmanlike?
---
Camping is not unsportsmanlike in any situation. If the match just started, the killer hooks you within 1 minute and sits in front of the hook, still won't be unsportsmanlike. Very frowned upon but it stops there.
---
this is absolutely gonna be my new survivor troll build
---
Screams and aura reading are different. Screams give killers notifications at the moment they screamed. Aura reading can last seconds instead of one exact moment.
---
The only thing it gives is an increase in rare items appearing on the bloodweb
---
Yeah, NOED is so common where/when I play that people cleanse totems very often. It happens so much that I sometimes get fucked if they cleanse near my generator and I didn't hear them.
---
I'm loving its perks but I'll need to try it out to be convinced because on paper its power sounds underwhelming.
---
They’ll still have some leeway of getting the survivor, with the survivors having loud footsteps and all.
---
I can see Fixated being paired with Lightweight being pretty great, Lightweight is already pretty great at losing a killer, but being able to see your scratch marks plus them going away faster and you moving faster so you can stop sprinting earlier would mean easier jukes and escapes.
---
I dont see nothing wrong honestly not saying I agree with facecamping tho
---
bruh moment
---
Who... Says that?
---
also, why would anyone use small game, when you KNOW where ALL totems are at the start of the game?
---
one in each corner, one in the middle. if not, look around a bit
---
each tile has exactly one totem spot. check it, if not there, then leave the tile and go to the next one
---
I noticed the 1k for dulls but I thought maybe it was a special thing I didn't hear about. Glad to know it's permanent!
---
You can have a point and not sound like a total douche. There's a reason there's a meta. Survivors and certain killers have more leeway in what they can run while keeping competitive, but at a certain point you're giving yourself a needless disadvantage.
---
Surveillance plus surge sounds pretty good
---
It really does feel like this!
---
it be like that sometimes
---
They have similar ideals
---
WHYYYYYY
---
Camping isnt wrong in all situations.
---
Sometimes it's the best move, sometimes it's the only move.
---
Other times it's a bad idea and loses games.
---
Like traits on ck2?
---
Dwight running in and out of lockers scooby doo style
---
What I would want is to have interchangeable bundles. Like I want Demogorgon with Nancy or Demo and The Hair. Those could be normal chapter dlc price. Then you add a third bundle that’s just the two survivors for say $6 compared to $7. Then you add the $11 bundle that’s all three with a special (read as recolor) cosmetic for both survivors.
---
Camraderie, Slippery Meat, Borrowed Time, DS
---
Why does it matter how many overall perks there are? Honestly id say right now killers have more viable perks then survivors do
---
You know what they say, laugh loudly and carry a big stick
---
The point of it is to do work over the entire course of the game. You may not feel it throughout the game, but the more you keep people injured the more the time they spend healing starts to add up. If you use it a lot then suddenly stop using it it makes heals feel insanely fast in comparison.
---
Strategy: a plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major or overall aim.
---
If your aim is just kills, it's a strategy.
---
Inner strength isnt that great. Plus it gets worse as more people run it. Plus it causes noed to be better because people will save dull totems instead of cleansing them immediately
---
&gt;People would bitch.  
---
FTFY.
---
About noed, do bones. You KNOW where ALL totems are at the start of the game. One in each corner, one in the middle. if not, look around a bit
---
Each tile has exactly one totem spot. Check it, if not there, then leave the tile and go to the next one.
---
the EGC should be the last rush to the escape, where survivors struggle to get out and have to leave friends behind to barely get out. 
---
What we get? "lets leave the gates at 99% and bomb rush the hook with out Borrowed Times and DSes to go in a line, teabag at the game and say 'EZ CAMP' in the chat"
---
that's gonna be a bruh from me
---
IMO the gen should blow up immediately if you get off it during Overcharge skill check.  This just proves how useless overcharge is.
---
Ok that would be so bullshit with ruin though, imagine taking forever to find ruin and it just goes back up again. Maybe it could work if it took a really long time
---
Since you've ranked 1 him! Can I get some advice from you? I love playing doc but I have real trouble even getting a 2 k most games. I dont know if my playstyle or build! I have videos up on twitch if youd like to see how Iplay!! Bro straight up any advice is happily taken!!! Its gzmo12 on twitch
---
No one really cares about the rank (unless you get no pips for a 4k)
---
also, 
---
&gt; it’s only advantageous to your emotions 
---
Isn't that why we play games tho?
---
If you see a gen being worked on, but you can’t see the surfs, just puke on it. If they get sick, go back to the gen
---
I like it. I think people are underestimating a few things. 
---
Yes the tunnels can be destroyed, but its a side objective that gets survivors to do something besides  gens.  In the video we saw Nancy took 20 seconds to destroy it. Thats more time then it takes to cleanse a totem. Whats one thing Killers want? Something to slow the game down and take the edge off gen rushing. The tunnels do that either by letting Demo pressure gens or getting survivors to cleanse tunnels. Also worth noting that the Demo seems to be able to place this burrows in like 5 seconds. So its significantly harder for survivors to dig them up then it is for him to place them. Some people compare him to Hag in terms of downtime to set the power up but I don't think thats entirely accurate It seems like he can place fewer portals down and considering they are resusable (I think) it actually means he should have significantly less downtime using his powers. 
---
As for the lunge the video made it look a bit better than some people are implying I think. 
---
just [look](https://youtu.be/BjoZSP8_Ce4?t=965) the jump make seem short for a pounce but the cone of the attack itself with the Demos long gangly arms goes quite a bit  further than his body does. I want to play it just to see what the cost/benefit comparison is between a pounce and just running up and lunging but the video didn't make it seem that bad. 
---
Few things I want to know. 
---
1) can Demo travel through portals being destroyed by survivors? If so that makes breaking these things a huge risk.
---
2) does the pounce attack go over pallets and vaults? If so Demo can be a great killer to built aggressive pallet disrespect perks on
---
If all of this is the best case scenario for him then he can be a solid upper midtier I think. Theres a lot of perks to try on him and I got some ideas already for some builds. 
---
Either something like enduring/brutal strength/spirit fury for a screw pallet build or Surge/Pop goes the weasel/something else for a gen guarding build.
---
I think people are just a little underwhelmed because his powers are a bit grounded compared to the flashier or weirder  killers like Plague or Spirit.  But I think they fit the character pretty well (Demogorgan is a animalistic brutish extradimensional beast) and the tunnels/portals are a big part of the show. And I think they have potential. At their core they have everything a killer needs to be strong in DBD. A power that helps in chase (pounce can do this especially if he can hit survivors who are just on the otherside of vaults and pallets with it) and map pressure with the tunnels.
---
No. I disagree. The map would need to be incredibly big or have 2 equally gigantic floors and its still not worth doing. Good idea tho
---
$9.99
---
how tf
---
Seems ok
---
They probably meant writing wise and not in terms of the costume design since that is 2 different people in   
---
 different departments.
---
Inner strength seems more easily usable, but second wind seems very convenient if the killer isn't a camper
---
True the maps are relatively small
---
Second wind could be hard to proc when solo queuing as well
---
There's a reason I watch it via streamers like Cahlaflour instead of the actual dev stream
---
only big brain gamers could understand
---
Pop goes the weasle would be good with surge, no?
---
How dare you say something so smart yet so brave
---
I’m literally saving my blood points till it comes out
---
If you're new, I suggest you start with Trapper. He'll teach you how to trick, prevent loops and delay better. Putting a trap around a corner, behind a window or inside a pallet will be incredibly strong. The other thing is as killer, you should try and chase on foot and avoid breaking pallets or climbing windows as it slows you down much more than a survivor. Most times instead of chasing a really good player you're better off chasing the clumsy ones.

but they did used to be based on killer which was an interesting time in the game
---
The game is smaller, as when it has over 8k m\^2, it's two layers one over the other, making it much smaller than Lery's

whoa whoa sorry bro! pc master race, we get it.

A bad strategy is still a strategy. You cannot change the definition.

I cant wait for her to proc haunted to heal,then get insta smacked

Important dominance
---
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. At best it's a screw-up and at worst it's a bait-and-switch to get your money. Both should be called out by consumers instead of just accepted however.
---
I love doing that, they freak out and it's precios
---
There's no "PC master race" when I just tell you how it is
---
A pattern doesn't consist of just one thing.
---
Professionals have standards.
---
And then its even smaller when you consider that Dwight is like 3 feet tall if the big doorways in "the game" are 6 feet tall.
---
I cant change the definition, but its still so bad you cant call it a strategy in my opinion and I agree with OP on the meme.
---
It just fuels your hatred towards the survivors. 
---
It just ends up stirring up more toxicity.  Idk why I said that it was more advantageous towards your emotions, it really isn’t 
---
I usually just ditch the hook to intercept the saves at a distant. I ( and everyone should )  hook survivors far away from the gates. If you’re afraid of getting body blocked, just force the survivors out. It’s much more satisfying gameplay for you and the survivors. 
---
If you hook them near an exit gate, the survivors will usually get the unhook and all end up escaping ( except if you’re bubba ).
---
Im gonna be real, that is one of the funniest but at the same time out of no where excuses I've ever heard.
---
No it’s not, it’s the same que only in a party, I guess last night not a lot of people were on?
---
Oh wow, these are gorgeous, do you take commission work by chance?
---
My friend and I have already agree'd and we'll poke him to feed him his 3 Musketeers.
---
Trash
---
To the OP: Its okay. Its just one game with a toxic person. Take a deep breath and enjoy the next one
---
My original post was referring to killers that facecamp with 5 gens left first chance they get
---
Same thing has happened to me, and in the same match I couldn't escape, even if I left at the exit, ran back in, and tried again. I had to close my game and re open it
---
I fed leatherface until i got the teachable... Its literally only appeared on my bloodweb once... For hillbilly. Who I suck as and hate playing...
---
I can’t fucking hear that statement anymore “do bones” they say. I do bones, but I’m not the only survivor in the damn trial.
---
And with that last statement, i figured what the problem is. You just hate survivors. No point in arguing then. You’re right, I’m wrong. Have a nice day.
---
wait did they specify  you'd still get the points from healing using it
---
*fists in the sky! 
---
Kuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnn
---
god I love and hate this cornfield so much lol
---
it still doesn't change the fact that the way EGC works is just stupid.
---
the EGC should be the last rush to the escape, where survivors struggle to get out and have to leave friends behind to barely get out. What we get? "lets leave the gates at 99% and bomb rush the hook with out Borrowed Times and DSes to go to the gate in a line, protecting those who are injured, teabag at the game and say 'EZ CAMP' in the chat"
---
This ain’t the reason bud. Nice strawman.
---
English please?
---
These are the dead hours my friend.
---
Well, they can't all be winners.
---
Certainly not impossible according to the two red rank survivors I had in my rank 12 Hag daily tonight ha. At least not on PC.
---
*frowns in xbox*
---
If you can stand still for 2 sec and people spasm they are shit players. even prayer beads spirit still makes footsteps and grass move so if you actually use your ears on survivor side it will help immensly
---
but it not only doesn't do anything to the fact that they can hear you when you're injured, even with Iron Will (stridor), but it also doesn't work when you're injured
---
Honestly I feel your pain I have an ass pc
---
Even if I want mah Bois and gal Legions buffed, you are making him broken. He had this issue on release. Nerf him he becomes shit, buff him he becomes god tier
---
What a wonderfully well thought out and insightful criticism, breaking down the intricacies of the perks and how it could possibly affect the meta of the game. You've certainly changed my mind and are not a troll in any way shape or form.
---
If you drop a pallet and teabag, you have just bought a ticket to be facecamped. As long as I’m not running mori or any red items... you have just become my primary focus. It’s fun for me.
---
I dont get it.
---
but hmm that's odd they weren't out of my terror radius and I only hit them once with deep wound
---
OmegaLUL
---
i’m pretty sure i made a clip doing EXACTLY THAT when first learning survivor on stream 😂😂 it was terrifying ahaha
---
👏👏👏👏
---
gameplay is going to be insane
---
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Surge affects all gens in the radius. I am not sure if Pop will go well with this. But if you down&gt;surge&gt;hook&gt;and the survivors touched the gen that got surged so you can pop goes the weasel it you are going to essentially demolish all progress on that gen. Comboing surge with PGTW has some ugly snowball potential if the survivors get genlocked i think.
---
&gt; Personally I would've loved to see some sort of "autopick" feature where the bloodweb takes the cheapest route automatically for you
---
... no seriously ?
---
It is worth noting that because of the Killer's lunge range (the 0.3 seconds they move faster during a lunge - which is actually faster than a Sprint Bursting Survivor by a small margin, in case you ever wondered why you can get hit while under 150% move speed) and the reach of their weapon...
---
That the nine meters for a 115% Killer is probably more like twelve meters.
---
And the six meters for a 110% Killer is probably more like nine meters.
---
Of course that's still reduced to **6** and **3** if the Survivor has an exhaustion-sprint perk ready, the Killer has to be *very close* to actually catch a Survivor with Iron Maiden, like probably about to check the locker close.
---
Even compare it to Spirit.
---
Survivor moves 60 meters in 15 seconds (or 66 meters with Lithe or Sprint Burst).
---
Spirit moves for 5 seconds (no duration or speed addons) at 7.04 and then returns to 4.40, meaning she moves a total of 79.2 meters, for +19.2, and if you add on 3 (for a lunge) that's 22.2, and her Terror Radius is 24 meters.
---
Meaning if a Survivor exits a locker against a Spirit with a fully charged Yamaoka's Haunting while outside of the Spirit's Terror Radius, they will *still* get away even without an exhaustion perk ready for long enough to take a hit unless they happen to run towards instead of away.
---
Hillbilly moves fast enough to take advantage of Iron Maiden, but is unable to (he has to use his chainsaw to move fast enough, and chainsaw hits don't proc Iron Maiden - this is redundant anyway since chainsaws one-hit-down without a speed limiter anyway). He has to M1 the target to use Iron Maiden, not chainsaw them. If he doesn't chainsaw sprint then it's useless.
---
Legion can't do it, he moves 50 meters in Feral Frenzy over 10 seconds, but then self-stuns for 4, and then moves at 4.6 m/s last second (54.6 meters total, plus 3 for a lunge, falls short of the survivor's 60 default).
---
Huntress moves 110% and her hatchets don't count.
---
Only Spirit and Nurse can really make use of Iron Maiden - Spirit because a 22.2 meter advantage is still a hell of a lot in 15 seconds. Nurse because of the whole teleporting thing. Hillbilly could if he wanted to chainsaw close enough and not actually land the chainsaw, but who would?
---
Nothing about Legion's power makes sense. I don't get why they let it be so bad.
---
The reason Inner Strength is good is that it encourages randoms to do totems. As an actual perk I dont think I’d run it. Maybe as a meme with Iron Will and Quick and Quiet and see how many times I can “heal mid chase”.
---
A perk that gives survivors incentives to do totems other than Hex totems is really good for the game. Especially for those survivors in Yellow-Green ranks. 
---
I think you are underrating Surge. The extra regression makes it a lot better. Sucks that it only works on basic attacks though. I could see it being really good on Billy if it worked with his Chainsaw. Hag can probably use it pretty well, same with Nurse and Spirit but thats not saying much now
---
Only with Frank's Mixtape. The worst add on in the entire game.
---
Sorry let me snap my neck so i can look at this properly (*CRACK*) YEAH LOOKS FINE
---
This just gives me PTSD of perk stacking... Those were the good old days

no we just need a better overall balance between every perks. Look at meta perks, see why they are always pick at high rank and nerf them accordingly. Look at Low tier perks and do the contrary.

you can see the broken totems on the ground you know. you can just ask "who cleansed that one?" and if it was none of you, it's the one some random did

Okay, but we're just stopping the timer it looks like not the animation. Sure they can tell the timer has stopped but it's slow enough that it will be very hard to tell unless you aren't even looking for survivors.

Lmao I just got all the perks I own for my P3 Dwight and then this bloodweb change is coming
---
&gt;Most? I think they're in minority, sadly.
---
I was referring to a single person, which is the biggest Pig main. Perhaps the word "most" doesn't apply in that context. Non-English speaker so I am not sure.
---
Wouldn't even be surprised if he still fell straight down as usual even while in mid-jump.
---
I do like all 3 of these perks, but I can't really imagine using any of them. Babysitter is basically a less effective borrowed time. If the killer is nearby then it does nothing because they will be swatted anyway, and if the killer is far away, you didn't really need babysitter anyway. 
---
Camaraderie is just way too niche in its application to ever be useful. Again, unless the killer is camping you, in which case, the extra time probably makes no difference, or the killer isn't, in which case the pause makes no difference. 
---
Second wind definitely feels like it could be useful, but unfortunately, it has 3 seperate activation conditions that need to be filled for it to work, and that is quite a bit for what amounts to getting a heal while you are doing a gen. Needing to get one full heal on a teammate isn't too bad, certainly manageable (though babysitter encouraging the teammate to run away off the hook you rescue them from doesn't synergise well at all). You have to get hooked which... sure, it will happen in most games, not a problem. But then you have to stay outside of the killer's terror radius while the killer is fully aware that you have this perk that will heal you because they can see that you are broken. All of this in addition to the fact it is coming out at the same time as Nancy's healing perk which is just a much more efficient way to heal yourself quickly. Second wind is definitely a cool perk and the one of the 3 I would be most likely to use, but it just has too many caveats to really justify the only sort of decent effect it does.
---

---
I'm mostly talking about it like an extended lunge or something like T3 myers lunge. Just enough that you want to get away from windows/pallets if you see the flower mouth open and dangerous to sit on a pallet and wait.
---
Ah yes, not the only huge bullshit double or triple window building with like four pallets along the outside to make sure you get to loop it three or four times and toss one down and do it again (since it has good doors as well to avoid window blockers).
---
But the corn maps gets most of the worst ones unless we're counting Haddonfield w/ Balanced Landing.

Yeah i would like that too

---
Oh ffs finally, the buff stealth killers needed. Thank. God. Was so sick of getting Object of Obsessioned (the main offender) and etc
---
The game is all about map knowledge really. The biggest hurdle in the game was learning all the maps. I started a month before Spirit was released. Dying on maps like Lerys were especially frustrating because that map was designed to be confusing as fuck. 
---
Of course a new player is going to get wrecked by an experienced player. The experienced player has multiple perks, map knowledge, general game experience etc. This is a given in every multiplayer game.
---
A big problem is how you derank past yellow ranks if you dont play for awhile. I havent played in awhile and my killer is at rank 17. I’ve also seen rank 20 killers with full kitted perk builds and vice versa. If you’ve gotten to red ranks, you shouldnt derank past 10. Something like that.
---
People are going to find SOME way to abuse camaraderie.
---
That's actually really easy to do but ok.
---
Are you Otzdarva
---
“If you stick to like a rock or jungle gym, Urban is a massive waste of a perk slot” 
---
Great observation. It’s a shame that there are plenty of gens that aren’t in those places. Being able to avoid the killer in places without tall cover is pretty important unless you never leave the edges of the map.
---
I mean if you just got off a chase and you are exhausted you either wait and do nothing or complete a gen
---
Hopefully surfers doesnt change,  would be perfect for my pure M1 legion
---
Oh, Josh. I see now.
---
MoM was so stupid because it was especially broken against M1 killers. It didnt really hurt Spirit and Hag because of how strong their power is but you straight up could not play killers like Wraith or Clown when it released. The perk was only released in that state to sell the DLC.
---
Iron Maiden’s exposed effect isnt that long... even if people are using Inner Strength I would still not use that perk
---
Yes lets ignore the numerous teleport portals and ability to hide terror radius.
---
You forgot to add "Small Game" for the "Inner strength".
---
I actually dont know why everyone think nurse is so hard on console, you dont get bad frames with her anymore.
---
YOU HUSBAND NOW
---
How do survivors stun you? Dropping pallets?
---
Current changes would be already very nice if applied to all levels. Important thing for me when prestiging is to find BBQ and Chilli, because then I can more efficiently get BP once I start using the offerings I got along the way (because most of the time you'll get some BP offerings). If I do, I can get up to 200% bonus BP on most of games, which is pretty big.
---
why would you even compare a healing perk to an instaheal lmao. Those are obviously not fair or balanced in the slightest.
---
Also, survivors working on portals are Oblivious and it looks like demo gets Undetectable after porting.
---
no...
---
Mathieu the Forbidden One
---
I love the ST memes, they’re too good hahaha !
---
You are right that they do complement each other, but the problem is that using both is half your loadout purely for the niche situation that the killer is closely guarding a hook. Babysitter doesn't really add anything that borrowed time doesn't already do since if they are far enough away for borrowed time not to trigger, babysitter won't add much, and if they are close enough for borrowed time to matter, well, they probably don't need to scratchmarks to track them down.
---
You mean rank 2-20 play
---
Oh I’ve seen plenty of people who are new to the game DC. Almost always are low level ranks (20, 19, 18).
---
Do not run Detectives Hunch...it is so bad.
---
I seriously wish the developers would put a punishment in place for obnoxious Survivors where if they won't stop clicking and teabagging the Killer then the Entity automatically bursts out of the ground and kills them like in the Endgame Collapse. It'd be fun to watch someone teabagging get destroyed all of a sudden. Lore-wise they could say the Entity is displeased that the Survivors aren't following the rules of the match and doing their job. I honestly think hard camping for at least a minute should give everyone working on gens a speed to repairs until the camping is over because that'd further discourage campers with how camping can result in an easy gen rush.
---
Sometimes it does. Sometimes I’ll get the 5k points and other times, nada.
---
I compared an instaheal to pre nerf MOM, showing than MOM is better, then I compared he instaheal to the healing perk, showing that instaheal are waaay better. This disproving OP’s argument that the new healing perk is gonna be like pre nerf MOM
---
I think it lets you do other things while you passively heal
---
I also own it and I'm also in red ranks most of the time 😂
---
explain why they are bad please, and any arguments that include "they just are." and "Look for yourself" will not be acceptable for the criteria.

The 1000 Steve mains

For an anti-bullshit build, you can run: Small Gane (to counter NOED), Inner Strength (synergy with Small Game and lots of easy heals), Babysitter (to prevent the Killer tunnelling the person you unhooked) and Second Wind or DS (if the Killer tries to tunnel you).
---
Ye but unless you do a 200 iq play with ds it usually results in a hook swap
---
If you want to practice hitting them, I'd recommend running Shadowborn, a wraith perk, which increases your FOV making it easier to keep track of the survivors who try to spin you.
---
It's fact.
---
Mind Breaker causes exhaustion though, making it difficult to sprint burst away, especially on a stealth killer whom you won’t know is coming to give yourself recovery time to end the exhaustion
---
ohh okay thanks
---
So now we have people saying they don't want anything to speed it up and it won't help either. Can't have it both ways 🤔 also, seconds matter in this game. If everyone ran it and knocked 13 seconds off it (not even counting prove thyself) would that not help?
---
I know this has nothing to do with the post, but that was a really nice thing to say :) just thought I’d say that
---
Maybe it could apply the broken status?
---
Interesting idea. I worry that the survivors with strong meta perks would be a bit OP. Meg would turn into super Meg. Having an even stronger Dead Hard or DS would be crazy.
---
"English mothafucka do you speak it"
---
Money, time, copyright. It's easier to licence a look than it is to licence a recognizable voice.
---
You opinion is very welcome here but please refrain from spamming the sub.
---
You are really overrating her perks. In my honest opinion the only (Survivor) strong perk is Second Wind.
---
  It is a good alternative for We Will Make It because you do not have to waste time to heal and can go stright to the gen since you will autoheal and not geting downed 20 sec after being unhooked is not a big chellange.Also it will work well with Empathy.
---
Speaking about the girl perks.
---
  Better Together - First part is just Bond but instead of seeing survivors for 36 m all the time you highlight a gen for 32 while you are repairing. Seconds part only adventage is that you can see who is closer to the downed person so you know who is going to unhook him thats all. In my opinion Bond is a better option but this is a solid alternative.
---
  Fixated - I do not get why people get so hyped about this. Seeing your scratchmarks is not a such important information even if you want to mindgame you can just count to 10 since scratchmarks are visible for 10 seconds (after 7 barely visible) and 25% faster walking speed does not convince me.MAYBE with Sprint Burst it is worth,MAYBE.
---
  Inner Strenght - Now this looks great on paper. Destroy a totem and go to a locker to heal but there is one important problem. There are 5 totems on the map if all 4 of you run this perk than it is not so good counting that you have to run across the map to find a not alredy destroyed one than destroy it which takes 14 sec (if im not wrong) and than wait in a locker for 8 sec. In a perfect situation where the totem and locker are right on your face  it takes 22 seconds to heal yourself.But there is a good side effect,you destroy totems you get bonus points and are closer to counter a NOED (if he has one). I imagine that it could be a nice combo with Head On during a chase but it can be situational since the killer cannot find in 8 seconds which may not work vs a smart killer.
---
Conclusion? Her perks are ok with a slight potential but they are nowhere near as good as people are saying.
---
say sike right now
---
If killers can have infinite Insta downs then why can survivors have one time use insta heals?
---
that would be too easy
---
There are many perks better than Sloppy but you are unlikely to unlock them early on. Sloppy appears so early and commonly in the web that you may as well use it until you unlock better ones, the added BP is a serious bonus too.
---
Maybe if they add 4 new perk slots... lol
---
Talk about situational
---
Hey op, don’t use the odd bulb the add on only makes your flashlight worse. Just use batteries instead.
---
Not bad at all. Just underrated and never used.
---
Great example of it being used here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y2KWJp-rDNU
---
It already counters itself UNLESS you've wasted an entire perk slot on Iron Maiden lmao
---
I'm saying that people don't even know about the fact meme and they get all triggered. I never said the power should be a old Freddy v2
---
Some licensing is harder to get than others, but I guess naaa fuck them for not giving the players a Friday the thirteenth chapter.
---
To flex. I got another one of me Moriing the obsession and the others immediately DC. People downvoted me saying Dying Light Doc is garbage but I completely disagree. It's an instant win button.
---
Great so my brother lied about that transaction. He said he bought it with my card, that's my bad. I don't own him personally,  I deeply apologize.
---
Insta Heal, Second wind, self care and inner strength. We did it boys, injured state is no more.
---
Why Doctor mains? The perk has a hard radius of 32 metres, it isn't affected by terror radius. I say this as an ex-Doctor main.
---
Am I the one who posted?
---
Are we going to ignore that fixated contradicts the lore? Scratch marks are visible only to killer's because The Entity is connected within them.
---
i would be glad to pay a bit extra since "stranger things" most likely get some of the earnings or something and well i want to support BHVR
---
That makes sense, well theres always the PTB so it might change to that, no one really knows at this point in time. Either way i think it'll be a pretty decent perk to take if your aiming for early game builds
---
if you’re rank twenty
---
You can buy with shards earned in game.
---
People bitch.
---
Yes. Gameplay over lore, every time.
---
What perks are „reusable” so i mean the last one or the struggle thing and the others that are using word „activates, deactivates” is for more than one use? As MoM was finally usable once and i am confused
---
Nancy: if I can heal it’s a deal
---
they get stealth when they teleport
---
Its only an instant win if you bring a mori with it imo and if you hardcore tunnel. Which even without dying light is an op (and very unfun to play against may I say). Dying light just justifies it.
---
#TOKI YO TOMAREEEEE
---
Actually the perk description says "each time you cleanse a totem" so it can actually be reused.
---
The only one of these perks that is not re-usable is Camaraderie.
---
Babysitter, Borrowed Time, We're Gonna Live Forever, and We'll Make It.
---
Running it on a Prove Thyself build seems really good. Assuming the killer isn’t running Discordance.

---
They normally start it at 2 pm est and it goes on for about a week or two
---
See? Now you contradict your own statement. You can't just give survivors a mechanic that killers have as a core gameplay mechanic. Anyway. I don't say it's not useful, but good survivors know in which area scratch marks are going to affect.
---
Man you are so right tho. My current build for solo is DH, Iron Will, Bond, Adrenaline. Adrenaline, DS and an Exhaustion perks have been meta for ages. The truth is the survivor meta perks are meta because of good they are in so many situations without them being gimmicky. Plus the fact that every build should have an exhaustion perk, it leaves us down to 3 perks to chose from :/
---
 If we think in that manner the only perk that has a chance of becoming meta is Fixated, since it is the most universaly good without having huge drawbacks or conditions. 
---
But still I dont know how I would fit any of those perks in my current build.
---
&gt; my question is around what time today would they most likely be doing the snapshot?
---
Why do you think it will be today's snapshot?
---
It might inflict '0 seconds' of exhaustion and a debuff preventing you from lowering exhaustion timer for 3s.
---
There is not a single statement in your post that I can agree with. Besides that, it looks like you got some information wrong
---
What part of the title are you struggling with? It’s English and it makes complete sense, it’s just colloquial

demogorgon has no stealth, but the survivor become stupid while working on the portals and forget to check their heartbeat .
---
It actually might need re-established, with the influx of new players, but up until now it *generally* is used to signal that you are being camped.
---
you get bloodpoitns when the killer disconnects, because their client is the host and it has to give you your points.
---
you don't get them when the killer pulls the plug (either internet or power), because the game has no idea how many points you've actually got this match and it's waiting for the killer's client to give it this info (and the killer's client doesn't reply)
---
Yeah this has happened to me a couple times. You can escape through the hatch but usually by the time I remember the killer and I are staring each other down through the barrier.
---
I can’t even hit Overcharge normally
---
Inner strength in terms of strict time is longer than just using a med kit on yourself, but it is more about being able to use time effectively when it matters. Because you can just pop a totem at the start of the game (and there is usually one nearby your spawn) you can just have that 8 second heal in your back pocket to use at any point for the rest of the game. Sure you would have wasted a bit of time at the very start, but the start of the game is when you can afford to do that. Fixation I don't see being that useful, it is more just going to be fun for the gimmick and pair well with sprint burst. Better together as you said is just a bond alternative, I would still rather bond but it is like putting kindred on yourself rather than letting the other survivor do it for you. Niche, but justifies its existence.
---
BHVR: releases good but not broken perks for the first time
---
some people: bruh those perks are shieet if I've ever seen one

Well, if the killer don't leave at the very start of the game it should be like I said, but I think that it doesn't work for the adept trophies but haven't tested it

Well I keep getting toxic survivors who teabag and genrush with instaheals, including people who dive with a syringe at the downed survivor to insta-rez him and revert all my progress which is frustrating, so I'm allowed to run whatever I want to accomplish my objectives. If Dying Light 3-gen doctor gets the job done, so be it. Either way the salt I mine only adds to the Doctor experience.

Why?

What these 2 item does? I don't play freddy
---
I leveled Trapper from 5 to 25. No BBQ. I level up Wraith one time, I get BBQ. I’m not complaining because I usually get around 25 blood points from her a match already so probably best one to get it on for me. 
---
Plus I had two bloody party streamers and survivor pudding with an amazing game just 2 games after. 145K blood points was a great experience.

Shame they protect the injured person. They should probably just leave their teammates on the hook and just leave.

I don’t understand how killers even have fun with that shit

Well yes but actually no.

green one makes the charge time way too long to be used properly

yellow has good-enough range and a faster charge

why doesn't this have more upvotes

also CLAUDETTE'S HAIR

giving u silver just for that
---
That's what I'm talking about. the hooks should kill you faster in the EGC.
---
Doesn't self care five you survival?
---
I think killing the process on PC also works like that
---
lol why? having survivors come and try and save increases your chance of getting more kills.
---
How much do they normally cost
---
I can literally open the locker and you're fucked.
---
Fixated I think would work for newer players and also you can walk faster when injured so good
---
It's a time management thing. Without Second Wind, your team mate unhooks you and has to spend ~16s healing you changing on what perks/status effects you've got.
---
With Second Wind, it takes 4 seconds longer to heal, but both you and the guy who unhooked you are now on a generator. By the time the Gen is halfway repaired (44s for two people to repair one generator), you've been healed anyway.
---
It's not super powerful because it's flashy, it's powerful because it essentially allows you to do two things at once.
---
Also with the new anti-camping perk theres an even less of a reason
---
Being able to see your own scratch marks sounds good. this will help some of the new players. Would be funt to check with lithe and dance with me.

---
They would for the most part he able to expand the range yes, but remember, old Freddy was the only killer who could create a unique strategy with overcharge by offering a free wakeup for the price of fucking up a gen, which in turn allowed him to do it again and again, etc.  
---
32-20m (Huntress) is still a decent range of control, but just like stridor on Spirit, some perks have a bit more synergy with some killers than others.
---
Thats the 'betrayed' scenario from F13

because you're not kicking them

---
I play on PS4 Pro and the graphics are really good. Ive played on PC too and they are better on PC but it still looks really good on PS4.
---
fair
---
I thought the same thing
---
Basically all survivors start the trial in the Dreamworld when you equip the red paintbrush, failing skillchecks do not wake them up. When you add the swing chains it becomes deadly because for every survivor in the Dreamworld there's a reduction to sabotage speed, healing speed, and repair speed, if all are in the Dreamworld the reduced speed is capped at tremendous speed, it swings the game in your favor entirely from the get go.
---
Inner strength is an indrect nerf to NOED
---
Fixated might be my new favorite perk
---
If you are new its ok and you will learn how to use them better. If not you are pretty bad in the game lol
---
First of all, I run into every pallet as soon as possible to eat it, its not special to stun a killer with pallet. Good killers just eat them asap on purpose.
---
Second you killed 5 pallets with camping them and not even slightly looping around. Maybe you got 2 gens out of it, but everyone is gonna die because there are no pallets left if the killer is slightly decent in the game.
---
Ufffff I see, that's op
---
bubba has to make a stupid mistake
---
bubbas do that a lot tho. they aren't the smartest

I thought the perk just reads ‘their location is revealed’ wouldn’t that still proc then or am I missing something

Np
---
Im Killer main, don't want to be toxic but these survivor perks seem a bit op to me. If not op then survivors Will be amusing them. Please tell me your opinion, in asking mostly killers.

Worst part is popping haunted is a sacrifice im willing to make
---
I mean the last 3 releases have been liscends
---
MoM should have never existed.
---
Those perks aren't nerf worthy tho
---
Shadow Dance makes you move at 310%???
---
#Excuse me?!
---
yeah, that's a thing but he can be on 99% with a survivor. But yes...The survivors are on 99% in that situation.
---
Tombstone doesnt give a lot of bloodpoints or allow you to rank up because of how easy it is to kill people with it. It's more of a gimmick or fun build (to play as).
---
"How easy it is to kill people with it"
---
Try playing it a rank 1
---
Hell, try playing it against anyone that knows that jumping into lockers gimps tombstone
---
I think he’s done a pretty good job so far
---
Prestige should give more than just a boring cosmetic. A 5th perk slot would be the ultimate reward for spending those blood points. 
---
Players with fewer perks to choose from are always at a disadvantage. That’s what the blood points are for, to be spent. Not to be accumulated until you cap. 
---
Adding a perk requirement would encourage players to earn and spend the points.
---
So inner strength is once per game?
---
Ridiculous. I've seen people justify it saying 'killers shouldn't rank rank up against bad teams'. Guess what, now we're going to play against worse teams!
---
There’s already a whole Friday the thirteenth game, which is also caught up in legislation. The license holders have been in court for quite a while now and nothing can happen with the rights.
---
At least people will actually do bones
---
Anyone have an idea how the dlc will cost? I have 10$ in wallet, it would suck if wasn’t enough.
---
Bloodpoints 20K 'fore you got a kill
---
At least we have microsoft rewards so we can get the killer for free
---
I don't want to disappoint you but let's do the math. 
---
First you run around while injured looking for a totem. It could be around the corner or it could be who knows where, and sometimes they are well hidden. And most of the time several of them are already cleansed by the midgame. 
---
Let's say you search for a totem for 10-20 seconds (if you're lucky). Then you spend 14 seconds cleansing a totem. Then again you run around searching for a locker. Again it could be just around the corner or some distance away. Let's say you look for a locker for 3-7 seconds. Then you have to sit in a locker for 8 seconds waiting for a heal.
---
So basically you run around while injured, leaving scratchmarks, doing nothing in some really unsafe places for ~35-49 (or even more!) seconds to heal. 
---
Instead of self-caring where you want for 32 seconds, as many times as you want, not reliant on totems that are probably don't exist anymore. 
---
And people think out of self-care and inner strength the latter is the better?
---
As far as I know, it shouldn't show your location if you're using Calm Spirit. It's kinda confusing because it doesn't specify that your scream is what reveals you (and doesn't even mention screaming in the description, even though you DO scream). Rancor makes it even more confusing because it has the same "location revealed" text, but the Survivors don't scream.
---
I could be wrong though, since I've never noticed someone using Calm Spirit while I was using Iron Maiden.
---
Nancy: "You're BULLSHIT"
---
I used to play on PS4 and recently switch to PC so I can compare the two. I was playing on PS4 slim though, not a pro. On a slim, there were definitely some noticeable differences in framerate, particularly when you're doing a generator.
---
In this game the main objective for survivors is doing generators. While doing denerators, you're constantly doing these little quicktime events called skillchecks, where you have to press a button at just the right point while watching a little high speed slider. On the console version, that slider is much harder to track because of the framerate which causes skillchecks in general to just be harder on console.
---
There's little differences like that, although the devs are supposedly working to fix these things constantly. Small lag spikes during chases and other small performance issues. Consoles will also have bugs that aren't on PC and can take a longer time to be fixed.
---
All of these things are very minor though, and I would say that the console version is definitely still enjoyable and worth buying. Hell, you may not even experience a lot of these things on a pro. I just thought you should know what to expect going into it.
---
emblems give a minimal amount. so minimal, in fact, that I wouldn't care about them
---
Playtime gives the most. Just play a lot to earn it
---
Yea I’ll have to test that out in kyf,
---
I never use calm spirit but from what your saying, if I run calm spirit will it stop me from notifying a doctor whenever I scream?
---
They could at a story element from this spoiler. They could say that he was taken to an other dimension. The upside down (the serie)or the fog with the entity(in the game). Sounds like a nice explanation why he is in this realm.
---
yes, it is
---
Don’t watch it just to understand the memes, watch it cuz it’s worth it. Watching cuz it’s the best.
---
Fixated + no mither + self care here I come!
---
/s
---
The bamboo estate map is also pretty nasty for hiding especially for Blendettes. I recently had a match where I was struggling to kill a Claudette for the longest time because she kept becoming one with all the bamboo. She's just turned a corner and she was gone. Just gone.
---
Yup! It'll stop the random screams from his madness and it'll stop you from screaming when he shocks you (though he still gets points that pop up indicating that he shocked someone).
---
It also stops you from screaming in Clown's gas, Freddy's dream snares, and Infectious Fright.
---
Better than it was, they're trying to get it to 60 but that'll probably take a while
---
Nothing better than healing yourself fully in a locker so that the killer can catch you while being healthy in the locker.
---
I can imagine people wasting time the entire match trying to find a totem on swamp to heal
---
You and me both, buddy.
---
"Lookin' at you, roast beef"
---
I'm that person who wanted eleven as killer
---
You can send a support ticket if you have a link to their profile
---
It takes 10s to heal
---
Could have like a two minute timer before you can rebind it. I'd be open to the idea as a survivor main. Losing 1/4th of your perks sucks when you're potentially going up against 16.
---
 I think Aftercare is better than Better Together when playing Solo. You get to see if players are in gens, being chased, rescuing, opening gates, etc. all the time.
---
Dwight looked like a ninja.
---
It runs like ass on console but it's playable, I always recommend PC though, if you can't afford a good computer then console is the way to go I guess
---
Thanks. I will when I get on my computer tomorrow
---
If there is a two minute timer then there is no point in reworking totems.
---
What happened?
---
I'd say during learning.
---
I play on Xbox and I definitely would recommend picking this game up. As a survivor I can find a game pretty quickly maybe less then a minute. Killers load times are a little longer but I can still find a lobby in a short amount of time. It’s definitely picked up more players too since it’s on the gamepass.
---
That's exactly what I said. They are only useful in swf. In solo, you are better off carrying self care since you have no way of communicating with randoms.
---
Survivors have 4-SWF running instaheals, DS, Dead Hard, Adrenaline and old Mettle Of Man while running around teabagging and clicky clicky. The fact the guy DC'd (and I have footage of another round where all 4 DC'd as I was mid-mori on the DL obsession with 5 gens left) goes to show that they're likely Ochido wannabes (bright clothing, etc.) and I am perfectly justified pulling out all the stops.
---
That's true, my bad. Still, BT is probably going to still be a hell of a lot better in 90% of the situations, which is kind of the problem of DBD. Why grab a meh situational perk when you can grab DS, BT, SB, DH, SC, etc.
---
Hello players, ❤️
---
🤔Who has not yet installed the new app for free gifts?🤔
---
You have to use the new application :👍
---
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=free.giftcards.giftsforgamer
---
Pharmacy is cool if you're playing the same survivor a lot. Imo medkits are the second best item after the toolboxes
---
It'll be $12 as a bundle or $5 per character using Auric cells.
---
It’s better to cleanse immediately because it saves the heal for later though
---
Spirit is less fun to go against than Nurse. Good Nurse are so rare that most of them can be bamboozled by going to walls but the only effective counter to spirit is to run iron will and iron will is such a boring perk.
---
Requiring two totems would kill the perk.
---
this thread gave me a bit of inspiration so I made this, I put it on r/coldwindfarm cause I was worried it would get removed for breaking Rule 2
---

---
You deserve that award.
---
This is very off-topic, but your flair is hilarious
---
Actually I play at red ranks :) Most of the time I end up getting facecamped xD But tbh I feel like playing like a potato ...
---
Ok will do ty
---
Yes the dev team are sorry you think like that, they'll make sure to give the survivors godmode and a shotgun next time
---
Nancy character development went up significantly in the first season though when we became a leader like character.
---
Plague
---
Exactly.
---
I don’t ever see how Robin could replace Nancy, it just doesn’t make sense.
---
This is going right over my head... someone care to explain it to me?
---
Refresh my mind, why is the lawsuit still going again? This was about 2 years ago how did they not get things solved yet?
---
Well they are high quality and there isn’t much of them anyways.
---
I hate trickshots in all games but this was actually good
---
fixed it

---
Oh my god there will be a lot of memes had with haunted grounds and that perk
---
That's a killer tho and what does she even say I dont have her? Lol
---
I think his cosmetic was also from cote since he usually wears a vest
---
i believe is a glitch in some players because when i play with my swf, my friends get 5000 if the killer dc and i get nothing. who knows, maybe they get nothing and its just visual. I deffo get zero for survival
---
I'm not sure if Fixated will work with UE.
---
It increases your speed when *walking*, it doesn't increase your walking speed by 20% (which is what UE takes it's 100% speed from)
---
Idk tho, the chapter isn't even out yet lol
---
I feel you on this one. I mainly play survivor and when I get unhooked like this I'm really not happy about it. THOUGH, making the unhook impossible wouldn't be the solution to me. People just need to get some brains... Or some bans.
---
Shitty survivors will keep bming and flashlight clicking unless measures to stop them is taken by BHVR
---
Sounds like something that Dwight and Claudette would do.  Not Nancy.
---
Thank you
---
Knowing where the image of his face is from is blessed knowledge
---
1/10 Doctors: *screaming*
---
It is a strategy. Debate the merits or effectiveness all you want, but it is objectively a strategy.
---
It's still spaghetti code. Survivors shouldn't be able to hear how loud they are and know right from the beggining of the match that killer runs stridor. It should only make it seem like they are louder for the killer. Especially since description of this perks says: "*You are acutely sensitive to the breathing of your prey."*.
---
So if the killer is sensitive to their breathing, why would survivors be louder for themseslves and other survivors? Only killer becomes more sensitive, it doesn't make sense for me.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Does no one notice how garbage this perk is? It states after healing you it deactivates, that meand it heals you one single time in a game and that's it. Why tf would you think this is a good perk???
---
Nancy's but said?
---
I would assume so
---
take Rancor, PWYF,
---
stack PWYF 
---
run around zapping ppl
---
kill your obsession in the end-game for fun
---
Profit
---
That too.
---
Dbd gone....Corrupting the youth since 2017.
---
When you also run Calm Spirit so that you don't scream, making the killer none the wiser.
---
Are you the Nea on the picture? No offense tho.
---
Something doesn't stop being a strategy just because it doesn't work well. The killer could close their eyes and move in a random direction pressing the attack button every 6 seconds and that would still be a strategy even if it is a terrible one.
---
because Stridor is an actual disease.
---
if the perk was about hearing shit better, I'd be called something like "I'm all ears" or "Pain Sense"
---
Probably not. Ash gets to talk because he's Bruce Campbell
---
this is really well done but it looks like their hair is twice the size it should be lol
---
almost great
---
now make her look at the arrow and I'll be satisfied
---
Yeah, you're right, I didn't think about it :P Thanks for pointing it out. Maybe don't nerf it to the ground, but make this perk active only for 60-90 seconds after cleansing a totem. On PTB there probably will not be that much use out of it, since everyone will cleanse everything to test this perk out, I'm worried about normal game after relase of the chapter.
---
Fixated only increases walking speed, so urban + fixated is 120% walking speed, 100% (or possibly 120%) crouching speed
---
Dead hard doesn't work half of time ._. Garbage
---
I got it immediately with one killer. I felt lucky
---
DbD doesn't require big quality iirc
---
Looking at you, Quentin
---
Imo not ranking Up is the best , you get to give It your all and not rank Up so you can use almost anything and have It work more often
---
Honestly when I see Pizza Time I also think of John Wolfe.
---
Have a huge pie!
---
Bans sound good too, but it pisses me off so much like wtf is wrong with some people.
---
Flashlight is best imo
---
Me levelling up my Meg, only getting Deliverance at level 45.
---
But only if gen progression is smaller than 50%, so survivors will just rush it to 51% and boom, mindbreaker perk is useless. They really need to buff it.
---
I don't think that is that bad, but only if it work like just stopping the timer, if it make the sacrifice bar change that is a very bad perk, like, if it stay réd but just don't go down it's good, but if it make the bar to turn idk white or something like that, it's very bad since it's much easier to notice, but I think it can be very useful vs overall campers
---
OK thanks
---
no he's too pure, let him rest in peace
---
Killer: *Laughs in joy*
---
It can be useful for late hook saves as well but we will have to see this is just speculation until it gets released i hope its good
---
Why
---
QnQ, Head-on, DS, IS
---
‘nuff said
---
My brother said that only the killer perks are good. Which is not wrong, ofc, but I feel that Steve's are very good when saving people and being on the hook, and then Nancy's aren't as great as Steve's or the killer perks, they do help when it comes to strategic gameplay. (Though we don't talk about Inner Strength as strategic)
---
You can save for the Next original chapter
---
Probably 500 auric per character.  So like buying it outright like $21
---
She says gibberish
---
nah im gonna be the weirdo thats call them "demodaddy" (or maybe demogordaddy)
---
When you hook a survivor you're almost guaranteed someone is going for the save. This is how it is now.  
---
While I can see situations where having this perk will help the killer, it will definitely reduce the chances of them face camping as a survivor can keep ducking in and out and stopping the hook from timing. Imagine doing a Leatherface camp and someone is sitting up the top stopping the hook from timing, it'd force him to come out!
---
I hope his charge attack can break pallets.
---
Literally facecamping takes the fun out of the game, though the survivors who want to bully killers and be toxic deserve it, but beyond that there is no rhyme nor reason to facecamping. If anything you won't get as much blood points, as you would if you weren't facecamping because you can go and put some real hurt in to other survivors while having someone on hook.
---
Other way round for me on ps4.
---
Wraith and legion are my guilty pleasures only because they both have such great cosmetics
---
It doesn’t have to be a Hexed totem though, you just have to cleanse. So it can be a dull or hex. Doesn’t make the meme any less funny though lol
---
that's a good thing, if they make normal solo survivor play closer to swf play then they can buff the killer accordingly and make swf less powerful compared to solos
---
lol you're one of those, also its not just this community, its every pvp game when they add new heroes and abilities like ow for an example.
---
that's a basic gamer talk, op and stuff
---
you need to cheer up baby glum glum
---
Face camping is a strategy. Stupid and ineffective against at least a little decent survivors and also boring for both sides.
---
But you can play like this if you want. I'll be there hanging on that hook till the end so the other survivors will get at least 3 gens done.
---
Nah he said git gud
---
Michael only needs to use 3% of his power
---
Nah, the flavour text has to be 'This guy blows dead dogs'
---
God forbid we give the Doc something
---
I don’t think it’ll be that simple, though
---
I could be wrong however
---
Lots of survivors are toxic like that it really sucks
---
&gt;MoM, WGLF , Babysitter and Borrowed time
---
SWF with my sis, its gonna be so damn good
---
I would suggest watching it, it’s a good show in my opinion
---
lol someone is ready
---
This just makes me sad as a killer main
---
Pig or ghostface because sneaking up on people is epic. And hag because I like the lore and power
---
And for babysitter use make your choice
---
Oh wow I didn’t know about that, thanks
---
In the stream the killer had 3 portals at once so im sure we will be able to place a lot more
---
When I was watching the clip I kept thinking "why  would you pick him over the Nurse?". Now I play on console so she isn't exactly OP over there, but I can't think of a reason to pick the Demogorgon over her. Doesn't her power deliver the same result, except faster and no way for survivors to sabotage?
---
I think he will be a very strong killer with the right perks
---
Don’t give up hope, trust me we all have bad matches and remember when in doubt meme it out!
---
A three stack was trying to farm yesterday and I was playing killer. I dont like farmining so I hooked one and they all DC, I just give the random the hatch. I felt like a good person
---
What are you guys doing that long in the game? Playing ng+\ng++ or pvp mostly?
---
the same goes goes for ghostface lmao
---
Well it's my favourite item as a killer if I'm not Hag because survivors have to distract themselves from doing objectives to use it and as a result I tend to not use it as a survivor because I view it as an inefficiency item but I might be wrong ofc
---
Run BBQ, Distressing, Unnerving and Overcharge. And learn what 3 gen is and how to do it. 
---
Not saying do a 3 gen strat every game but if you can push the game towards it then it's a win win for you. 
---
Also learn the timing of shock thearpy as it's the only thing to counter looping Doc has
---
Just a friendly reminder - toxicity is a matter of perspective. Things you wrote, that is your perspective of what is/isn't toxic.
---
Toxicity is a part of every competitive game, and making a 10000th PSA about it is pointless.
---
This sounds as a " i want Billy to have bubbas chainsaw control keep the speedboost and be able to have wallhacks everytime i inevitable down someone
---
Don’t apologize to me, I didn’t take the statistics.
---
Sadly no.
---
Yeah I can definitely see the use of the perk, I just don't like having a dead perk after some time.
---
As a non stealth killer it’s halerious when you walk up to a survivor while they stare in the opposite direction oblivious to your location
---
Camaraderie is way too niche of a perk to be viable in anyone’s build. Even then it’s not very powerful when it does activated because a lot of times you will get saved anyways
---
Most of them will be dramatically changed before the PTB. And then some will be changed after it.
---
Been running it for months. Even if the killer doesn't have hex perks, I still get 5000 sweet sweet points and I have one less thing to worry about in the end game
---
He was talking about the fact that the outfits they're seen wearing are not from Season 3, but from earlier seasons.
---
True true
---
The person getting rescued can run iron will, no grunts of pain.
---
Don’t get triggered.
---
Why would killers want to nerf their own perk?  Shouldn't it be survivors taking offense to it instead?
---
Thank god for these bloodweb changes, this makes getting all perks on bill much easier.
---
Honestly might be better that we don't have to hear the screams of pain and death from these characters we love lol
---
Well if someone helps you heal the person it just activates faster
---
No.
---
My first and easy form of advice is don’t level up hag for ruin, there are perks that could work as a easy substitute such as pop goes the weasel. Another thing and also very easy is don’t play average height killers when first starting out, they can’t see over things and it makes survivors difficult to track. A suggestion I always make is trapper or hillbilly for starters.
---
Not all SWF are toxic.
---
Hm unfortunate
---
Putting a trap around a corner, behind a window or inside a pallet will be incredibly strong. The other thing is as killer, you should try and chase on foot and avoid breaking pallets or climbing windows as it slows you down much more than a survivor. Most times instead of chasing a really good player you're better off chasing the clumsy ones.

I think they said a while ago that some survivors are based off of BHVR employees
---
McLean already is a Dwight cosmetic xD so why no MCote
---
With speed add-ons he’s faster than usain bolt
---
What’s the point of progression or the blower at that point? You might as well ask for free add ons every game. Without grind there would be no long/ mid term fan base
---
Make your choice will be somewhat ok against it. He wants you to chase him anyway
---
 ou open [Lockers](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Lockers) 📷 **30**/**40**/**50** % faster.

Survivors who exit Lockers suffer from the [***Exposed***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Exposed) ***📷*** **Status Effect** for **15 seconds** and their location is revealed for **3 seconds**.

*"This is no place for cowards." — The Legion*
---
Evil Within -1
---
He's back!
---
I know I know. Survivors having this problem is usually worse though. Killer can dodge the lobby, we can’t dodge bad ping because we’ll have to wait again... 
---
I guess we don’t have to wait as long as killers on pc though. It’s weird that it’s different depending the platform. I guess killer is a bit more enjoyable on pc
---
Yes, but I was referring to the identification of survivors triggering it
---
If you use calm spirit, and leave a locker, it gives no indication to the killer that you are exposed and makes that aspect of it virtually mute
---
You still get the exposed status, but if the killer isnt there nor knows about it, they can’t really capitalize one it
---
I downvoted this, then I get the jk and laught my ass off
---
“This video will be a full match against a spirit with commentary mixed in at key moments.”
---
You act like I’m defending Self Care, but literally BHVR posted their most used killer and survivor perks across all rank brackets and platforms and Self Care is STILL in the top four most chosen perks. 
---
Like I’m not the majority of the player base still using Self care, buddy. Instead of missing the point and turning it on me, why don’t you go realize that iron grip of “Do Gen no heal, get adrenaline 4 minute game” is the most boring meta we will ever experience.
---
True, was playing against piggy running iron maiden ... not scary at all....she couldn't make it in time before 15 seconds lol
---
its useless imo i can still make distance from the killer and usually my friend would take the hit if i'm exposed or i'll take the hit for her if she's exposed 
---
pretty lame perk, NEXT
---
I really hope not...
---
IMO every perk in this DLC other than camaraderie is good
---
4th perk: **"My Turn Now"**
---
"When you have been saved from the hook twice, enter a locker uninjured/uninjured/injured to activate the perk. After 15/10/8 seconds of staying inside you activate your inner rage and will be able to use one of the hatches inside the lockers to attack &amp; kill the killer. "
---
Prove Thyself or We’re Gonna Live Forever. Both give bonus BP. PT gives bonus for combo’ing a gen with a teammate. WGLF gives stacks for safe unhooks, taking hits for people on the killer shoulder or getting pallet/flashlight saves and goes all the way up to 100% bonus.
---
But the demogorgan looks like the one from the end of season 3 and they even said they had access to behind the scenes concept art from the show.
---
I would tunnel any Dwight I saw like that all day everyday
---
Dbd isn’t canon to stranger things, so it wouldn’t matter
---
i honestly don't see Inner Strength being better than Self Care when Self Care has no strings attached and you'd still be spending the same amount of time searching for totems as healing
---
I agree. I was someone who was rioting about the $15 dollar pig skin back when it came out, and I stand by that, but this is something where it’s sensible. You get extra content, not to mention licensed content that BHVR probably had to bust their ass to get.
---
hahahaha last night i fucked with leather face, myers, piggy and a trapper
---
i got face camped lol, it used to bother me when i was new but not anymore, now its funny because of how much i looped them i know they are tilted af and i know the face camp is ready
---
salty killers are salty
---
the best thing is, i still escaped three face campers last night with my DS lol killers are just so sad when they can't catch you, a legion leaving the game because i escaped him a myers dcing because i have a key and found the hatch so many stories about salty killers and thankfully i record all my games so i can go back and laugh at them + its good to record incase of cheating/lagswitching. to have proof and ban the bad killers
---
Well, I'm pretty sure the lore only goes one way. Things and people from movies and series effect the dbd lore but not vica versa. Like the MCU movies arent effected by the series they have.
---
IKR, if any perk will see more play to counter Inner Strength I think it might be Haunted Grounds definetly not Iron Maiden (although the name is cool).
---
ew i don't like him
---
you're cute tho sis
---
Would surge proc overcharge?
---
**Calm spirit**
---
Babysitter, Borrowed Time, No One Left Behind, We'll Make It. "IMMA GET YOU OUTTA THERE"
---
However this otherworldly can’t just be killed like regular guys. Shotgun to the face of ghostface would make him noface. And this otherworldly being isn’t really wanting to kill u. All he wants to do is torture you unlike any torturer before. He’s master of pain and suffering &amp; knows exactly how to make you feel the worst pain imaginable continuously for eternity.
---
Have my upvote. Came for this. Thank you
---
But my meme has 1.1k upvotes, so...
---
They’ll work as read. Down a survivor with M1 and blow nearby gens. Down a survivor and the others scream in your TR. They don’t do anything with each other, but there’s the obvious synergy.
---
I said that in the show they can just say he got trapped in the upside down or both he could be in the entity realm and the upside down at the same time,  because the ray did something weird maybe  two time lines or he just a copy of him.
---
Don't overthink things. Think like you are the survivor. Make sure to Apply map pressure, and Don't worry about being "toxic" do whatever you can to get the 4k wether it be face camping, tunelling the only good person, etc.
---
Monto isnt as tall as I thought, or you are just tall as hell
---
Sweet sweet babies 😍
---
omg ew ew ew ew i just went there EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW GROSS
---
That's what I always think. When there is a meme about toxic survivors almost everyone is agreeing and I don't see anyone saying the opposite or they probably will get downvoted like i was once. It's scary to reply to entitled people. Cuz they won't listen. I wish i saw more survivors defending themselves in the subreddit. No way survivors are at fault that much as much as they are made to be in this subreddit.
---
behind you crouching

no its not that it was a bad team. Tombstone with tuft. It makes it take incredibly long to reach tier 3, but it means once you get to tier 3, you stay there. Then you are also able to just kill people at tier 3. He didn't get a single hook all game. He didn't hit anyone the entire game. He just walked up to them and moried them while they were still standing. Thats why he got no points. Even with that, someone got out. Id imagine by hatch, but still, I doubt he did anything to defend gens. So he got 3/16 kill states, lost every chase, did 0 gen damage, got 0 hits, and still didn't kill anyone. What do you expect to happen?

QT
---
As someone who plays both killer and survivor pretty much equally, all of these perks are gonna be a pain in the ass.
---
I dont think so, sorry. No ways that would be supported
---
there has always been different hooks for almost every realm
---
Lery's Memorial Institute has hooks that are made out of medical devices
---
The hooks at Ormond are made out of what looks like Ski lift supports
---
Yamaoka Estate hooks are stone pillars
---
Red Forest hooks are sticks and branches with animal hides
---
Springwood has hooks made of pipes and chains
---
The Gideon Meat Plant has hooks made of various pieces of scrap metal and appear like a jigsaw trap
---
Backwater Swamp hooks are a rotting support beam with a log holding up the hood
---
Haddonfield hooks are street lamps
---
Crotus Prenn Asylum hooks are ornate metal
---
Autohaven Wreckers hooks are woods held together by bandages (of all things)
---
Coldwind Farm hooks are made of rusted scrap metal
---
Macmillan Estate hooks are made from steel beams and rope
---
and then there are the various event hooks like Summer BBQ, Hallowed Blight, Lunar New Year, and Christmas
---
Thinking like them is hard for me. Im a rank one survivor so I don’t know what the fuck the noobs are thinking
---
&gt; I guess killer is a bit more enjoyable on pc
---
I'd say (solo) survivor is quite unenjoyable currently. Mostly because of DC epidemic.
---
Hard to say. So gar a one character DLC costs 5$ while a two characters costs 7$. It's their first three character DLCs. I expect the pricing to be higher. If you are lucky 10$ might be enough, but a price like 12$ would be possible as well.
---
Its like pallets don’t exist to them
---
Tbh, demogorgon can live a happier life with Entity, it doesn’t need to eat rats anymore.
---
Add iron will and you will walk 20% faster without making noise
---
So you say that you started playing because you saw a beautiful character and even if he is bad or you play him badly, do you still continue to play him? 
---
Heh ... I thought I was the only one!
---
^(P.S. Pig a number one. ;3)
---
What? The highest it's been is 8 dollars, it would probably be around 12 if they do increase the price
---
she sure makes me feel stupid
---
i'm trying to get gud against some killers and on my list now is spirit but fuck me sideways I AM SO FUCKING STUPID even tho my husband is a spirit main and he kept on teaching me how to avoid him i still panic when i hear or see her big hair
---
at least nurse doesn't scare me anymore, i need to work on my movements around spirit and get better. so far she's the only killer that makes me shit myself
---
OP is bad at the game. How's he rank 13 with that many tier 3 perks... All from other killers, which takes a whole lot of time and STILL lose with 0 kills. Come on 😂
---
The kids on this sub hate the truth or are to stupid to see the truth through bullshit so they always downvote since it's easier than using their brains.
---
This guy over here has never played against a good spirit
---
yea but i miss playing competitive games right now i loop killers for days and when im killer survivors are just sitting ducks. i miss competitive matches
---
Sure but perks which aren't effective or useful just get put on the back burner after two weeks.
---
How menu of you use Poised and Buckle Up, despite them being fun departures from the usual shit?
---
Honestly interested to see what the lore is behind the Demogoron going from serving the Mind Flayer to serving the Entity since they're very similar beings that run strange parallel dimensions. Did the Entity breach the Upside Down and steal the Demogoron? Will they suggest the two beings are cousins or something?
---
Yeah.  Haha my bad for not considering the regional differences.
---
I meant I've only played killers like Myers, Wraith and Clown, never touched nurse before
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cucwhs/really_annoying_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Play a higher tier killer to get BP and then just level Hag with those points. You don’t even need to play her. It’s all up to you
---
o7
---
"you’ll end up with less points than you would’ve if you let the surivor go"
---
There you are mistaken. You assume that you will catch that surv again, which is not always the case.
---
Yes. In your easy escape you mention: 
---
&gt;Get hit once, and hide and lose her in a chase. 
---
Are we factoring this strategy to work against baby Spirits or people who haven’t purchased a headset?
---
It's good to have diversity. Some people running pharmacy and some Inner Strength means there is no rivalry over chests/totems.
---
All I'm saying is there is no point in leveling up a single killer for a perk that is semi-par in most builds that's it and I would rather not start an argument in this comment thread.
---
Honestly Iron maiden is trash even when you use it to counter things, If they know you have Iron maiden they just wait until your long gone and then leg it in the other direction, 15 seconds of Exposed isn't long enough.
---
Jump into locker while he's stalking you or while he has EW3 active?
---
I can’t read this comment with a serious face ;D
---
EW3 active
---
With the agont of killers running sloppy butcher in my games, self-care is borderline useless.
---
*New perk: pretty good job, so far... When 3 generators are completed, all remaining generators are reduced to 0% completion.
---
You honestly sound to new to even be giving advice of any kind to be honest. Either that or you don't play the game at all and are only spitting out what stupid advice you seen on a YouTube video.
---
He’s just god now. Just hope for the hatch.
---
Can we agree that it's only gen rushing if all 4 have mechanics/commodius with brand new parts or just 4 brand new parts?
---
Don't do it out in the open. Start by doing it when they are breaking pallets, licking up survivors or vaulting windows. Aim for their neck
---
Say Sike right now!
---
Now it has to eat toxic survivors, that might be worse than before
---
Seriously. I think about this flair a lot
---
1000% this. I'm a survivor main too and if you act like a dick we're moving into the hook together and the rest of your team is probably walking out.
---
And now running any sort of hex perk is even MORE worthless than normal.
---
Thank fuck for Corrupt intervention.
---
Jfc people actually think Spirit is hard to play? She literally requires a set of ears and 3 brain cells.
---
I really would want a random perk mode
---
You can still know where they are, at the very least
---
Soo, you will be watching the bar all the time whatever you do and then run from the opposite side of the map because it stopped?
---
Oh my God I am so excited for the power now
---
Whooo
---
it kinda depends on the situation like for example if you have one person your slugging and one person close by on the hook theres a reason to camp but other than that theres practically no reason
---
Yeah, I do that too. The moment I get tbagged, I'll chase and facecamp that survivor the entire game. It's usually quite fun too as most of the time they will be in a swf, be pretty good and have meta perks so the chase can take the entire game and they'll get rescued as well.
---
Oh yeah my bad I got it wrong
---
Third cousins twice removed.
---
That, or maybe step brothers similar to Drake and Josh
---
Yeah I see. Survivors on ps4 don’t usually DC all that often because they waited too long to find a game
---
Hahaha was that a thing? Freddy the fish
---
I wanna see this changes, but RIP OoO? 
---
Just when I started using... :/
---
Someone else thinks the same?
---
I read _Second Wind_ and thought it said _Golden Wind_ . 
---
*SAD PIANO NOISES*
---
pretty sure i remember Mcote saying Dwight is not based on him, but on someone else (Dave i think?). You'd have to scour the old Devstream Vods, but it's there.
---
So when a chapter has only a killer and no survivors(Ghostface) It's ok to charge the full amount.
---
But when a chapter has an extra survivor, we need to suck it up if there's a price increase?
---
did they talk about the bloodweb changes in the stream?
---
PT is decent I suppose depending on another survivor which is far from guaranteed as a solo player. WGLF is good and I always use during x2 BP events but it doesn't do anything else.
---
Imagine having to cleanse Lullaby twice.
---
That sounds extremely fun
---
you got me
---
dbdgonewild is basically ded
---
He’s going through a lot. Best not to invite him to any other games.
---
I don’t get the reference but I laughed
---
i want her outfit when she went into the upside down in season 1 as well!
---
*Angry Hag Mori Noises*
---
No hook, just straight up kill everyone
---
Lol bye irrelevant trash
---
Iron will. Fixated. Poised. Ears
---
Spine Chill and Premonition *might* still work against killers with Undetectable active? (Ghostface, Pig, Wraith, etc.) But we don't really know. All we know for sure is they're immune to aura reads. So Dark Sense, OoO, Babysitter, and (I think) Rancor's effect for Survivors when a gen pops.
---
If only he could go into a crawl mode that way I could act like a dart :)
---
I mean OoO literally defeated the purpose of playing any stealth Killer in the game so you know lol
---
Taste extra salty
---
Starts consuming Dwight and takes his identity.
---
Or Surveillance
---
He is basically mince rag hag. Some guy insulted me for being annoyed that the recent killers are just basically the old ones but revamped except for hag.  
---
They had so much potential and yet again they threw it away.
---
I've had DBD since day one and have 5500 hours. He should know who I am.
---
Stealth killers don't apply Oblivious to Survivors, they gain Undetectable on themselves. Oblivious' only use right now will be when Survivors are destroying a Demogorgon's portal.
---
I hope inner strength becomes meta.
---
I love making it obvious im running BBQ and also run iron maiden
---
I still love Kate, but I think I'll use Nancy when I'll prestige my Kate
---
You can't even change direction of the pounds so it's a weaker Pig dash
---
Dwight is definitely based of Cote, is Dweard based off Puppers though because that is so similar to him it's uncanny lol
---
You just described Wraith ability. And Wraith is among the saddest killers in the game. Figuratively and literally speaking.
---
I would propose to make all her durations and cooldowns 4 times shorter, so she could jump more often, but for way less duration, that way she could be visible to a survivor far more often, and her mindgames would be workable only when you try to loop her on short loops.
---
Yeah I'm noticing a lot of folks are kind of glancing over some of the more subtle elements, such as being able to hold your power, and track any auras hanging near your portals. Yes, the main aspects are the portals and the lunge, but there are several secondary aspects of the portals that provide some incredibly interesting build options.
---
r/tihi
---
Fun fact:
---
Identity v players actually think camping is a strategy and they get salty af when you say otherwise
---
It’s okay... the offering is there for a reason
---
Yeah, I feel the same. Blinding at a pallet has some use, but it's very limited
---
If it’s not supported I don’t think you’d want to play it. It would run like crap.
---
Dead Hard, look at foliage and birds, hiding, Quick and Quiet
---
I don't think you can. Once you down someone and have Surge the gens start to regress and can't be kicked until someone touches them. I still think it would pair very well with Pop since Pop lasts a minute.
---
Every moment that pallet hits me the one who dropped it gets tunnelled
---
The only times “camping” is valid is when one or more survivors are idiots and crowding the hook or it is directly near the exit gates. Those are the only 3 valid times to camp
---
Spine chill. 
---
Dance with me / lithe / quick &amp; quiet
---
Iron will.
---
Walk frequently.
---
Dont try to mindgame her.
---
Take a flashlight to check if shes whooshing or mind gaming you over a vault.
---
Lmao some idiot called me stupid for thinking that behaviour kinda stopped making new original abilites. And now the subreddit is full of people saying the same hhahaahahha
---
Don't laugh at me but I actually get so proud of myself whenever I hit a great skill check
---
Self care was never a friend of mine😴
---
Just added!
---
I’d have a dart.
---
And apparently other perks that take effect when you kick gens will kick in. Otz noted that if you pair it with Surveillance that all gens affected by Surge will then be affected by Surveillance. That could change of course. Behavior could nerf such an effect.
---
or maybe he hasn't ranked back up recently because the rank reset was 10 days ago
---
Lets be real, the PTB is just for advertising so people can try them before it's live. Character releases were fine with the bug fixes happening in live servers and they only end up doing like one or 2 small bug fixes in PTB anyway.
---
Gotta love the good old overreacting on this sub. We didn't even have a PTB yet and the killers abilities are already branded to weak because it doesn't insta-down.
---
I'm just sad that we're getting a Licensed Chapter that's *not* Friday the 13th for Chapter 13.  I'd have rather had an original killer for Chapter 13 and Stranger Things as Chapter 14.
---
Back in my day it didn't have the rescue mechanic. Downed? Just wait for the killer to pick you up and succeed a skill check to win
---
Killer: “What did you do the the gens?”
---
Matthieu Cote: “Gone! Reduce to atoms...”
---
Like I said earlier, when it comes to vanilla perks available to everyone there's better options like NOED, Deer Stalker, Whispers, and Bitter Murmur. 
---
NOED is a great insurance policy against being gen rushed. Deer Stalker is great for slugging. Whispers is good for locating the first and last survivor. While Bitter Murmur shows you exactly where they are and where they are heading -I don't wear headphones and a lot of the time I cannot hear survivors until they are injured and they can just run Iron Will so Bitter Murmur helps.
---
No Rip NOED
---
I only camp (not face camp) toxic swf.
---
Kate definitely still has my heart just cause she has the face shape I normally find pretty attractive on female characters, but I honestly find something nice about all of the female models in game.
---
Yeah, a lot of luck. For example if i check a gen, I act like I'm walking away, phase while facing away then whilst I'm invisible loop back to the gen. You'd be suprised how many people fall for that. 
---
I love playing as her. Hate playing against her.
---
I run it in my build currently.  I am the Hex Destroyer.
---
Ah, I see you are a man of Bengt as well.
---
Camaraderie will be the reverse BBQ lol
---
"Just a friendly reminder" and then starts giving opinions. It's like those Lisa memes where you just want to try and look like you know more than someone else or give your opinion as a matter of fact. You wrote a small novel for seven upvotes, gg.
---
It's opposite when I try haunted grounds with ruin. Ruin gets thrown out and HG stays until the end of the game.
---
20 levels and literally every single one has had the exact same two perks: insidious and spies. I want Meyers to tier 3 me in my sleep.
---
The Xenomorph is now 100% possible if they use the one from the original movie, the tail isn't even a problem since they did the cloth physics for Ghostface so they can literally do the same but with it dragging on the floor
---
Oh yeah, we're overdue for a projectile-tossing killer.
---
Oh boy we're going to see this template over and over, certainly won't get old
---
https://i.imgur.com/cQG1rxh.jpg
---
the ultimate survivor rule book for killers
---
Iron Maiden would like to have a word.
---
Haha, he had no problem commenting on the guy that agreed with him, but since you didn't take his "friendly reminder" as a fact he just downvoted and didn't reply. Cute.
---
Yeah I'm definitely confused on the perk because the way I read it you will become exhausted and it will be paused for up to 3 seconds after you leave the generator. We'll have to wait for the test servers to find out
---
Babysitting Bill
---
Either way, why would you buy a DLC with auric cells if you're going to buy all of them anyway, you can just buy the chapter.
---
If you're playing any good killer that's kind of easy to do. It's not like my brain stops me from doing ANYTHING ELSE while I look at the bar. Unless I'm winning a chase (in which case I have no reaspn to return to hook) I don't need 100% of my attention and as soon as I see the bar stop, teleport back with nurse, sprint back with billy, phase closer with spirit, prepare the angle for a hatchet throw with huntress, teleport with demogorgon, run back with swift wind wraith, set up an ambush with pig/ghostface/myers/leatherface, etc.
---
Old OoO users will start using this perk
---
It appeared in my bloodweb after I bought it. Probably because I have... no other perks...
---
You do gens and escape
---
OP pls nerf
---
As far as I know, and I could be wrong,Monitor&amp;Abuse doesn't really do much for him.
---
Just gonna throw this out there for a sec; anyone that thinks these are OP, they're probably gonna get reviewed and revised during PTB just like Infectious Fright did with plague. Everyone just hold your horses and wait for judgement, and let's just have a nice discussion! Personally I think the perks are awesome and none seem too OP, they all encourage fun and interesting synergies!
---
Not
---
For once
---
It’s actually a jojo recerence
---
Here’s how to dethrone Borrowed time/ Decisive strike: don’t tunnel or camp! I know such a crazy concept right?
---
The Entity is taking full custody.
---
borrowed time and decisive strike. one person distracts while other goes for the save.
---
He doesn't need to be voiced by him in my opinion, Bruce Campbell's voice is very iconic and unique so you'd probably need him as the voice actor. Laurie and Tapp had similar voices to their actor either way.
---
Gotcha so who cares tho? Lol ash should be the only exception survivor wise hahaha
---
bait them by trying to unhook and releasing so they dont grab you off. then while they’re in cooldown animation unhook and flee. Borrowed Time is great incase they’re also a hardcore tunneler. 
---
run kindred so others can see the killer is camping and where he is.
---
Ghost face agrees.
---
I have never heard her say that, I have just heard her say "oww" followed by a tantrum.
---
Damn if it can jump over pallets ill be maining that thing lmao. Imagine it just jumping over those weird small scrap piles that are always at autohaven lol, so op that i think it wont be a thing.
---
Can someone explain what happened? I only recently started to play dbd
---
That's not camping. It's the correct play.  
---
But survivors will still call you a camper because they always need to blame someone else for their own faults.
---
Used Quick&amp;Quiet, and to my luck got matched against another spirit and got out for the very first time! Progress!
---
Get unhooked.
---
Killer starts chasing you?
---
Jump in a locker.
---
Now the killer either has to take you out of the locker and get hit with Decisive Strike or let you stay in there until you're fully healed with Inner Strength (as longs as you've cleansed a totem) and can use Head On to stun the killer and run away.
---
Or letting hex totems that gain stacks only light up after getting at least one stack would be a good idea imo, wouldnt be too strong of a buff and make these perks less frustrating to use.  (devour hope, huntress lullaby and others if i forgot any)
---
She actually says "Drink from a thousand fountains" if you translate it right.
---
Makes no difference it would just be another pre rework freddy
---
Are their perks revealed?
---
Prestige 3
---
It can be, it just depends on the average intelligence of the survivors you're facing
---
If you have gotten a gen skill check it will give you the “cursed” status effect from ruin so once you find a lit totem and cleanse it and the cursed status disappears you know you got ruin
---
I know that but what does it mean like how are you a prestige
---
I've already been using that! Now it's even more precious.
---
Because they are dicks. Just try to ignore it.
---
Your team: Doin gens, running the killer ans generally being useful.
---
The Dwight in the locker: Pretty good job so far.
---
I think chases the game requires more attention than you're giving it credit for
---
Ah cool, just wanted to be sure. My current build is Ruin, BBQ, Pop and discordance, which should be good (once I get BBQ and pop)
---
My strategy is being as toxic as possible so surviors checks my weeb profile and write mean comments on it.
---
Algorithms!
---
Watching spacelion be a killer the other day and the survivors were being that super altruistic team of idiots that don't understand that the killer won't just leave if he knows all the survivors are right there at the hook. Ended up being a 4k because they kept trying to save each other with him right there.
---
*So one of them literally made a Twitch account to come into stream and whine that space was "face camping" acting like they weren't just terrible players*
---
It was hilarious.
---
Let's say you main trapper, you get him to level 50 and then you have an option to prestige him, after that you have to get him to level 50 again etc . the max amount of times is 3
---
This is why I dont bother playing the ptb for new killers
---
Lol two exhaustion perks
---
No he wouldn't. To make him different you only need to make upside-down different from the dream world. And i never said he could only hit survs in the upside-down.
---
Pancake 3
---
Thanks
---
Whenever your character reaches level 50 you have the chance to prestige them. Doing this resets all your perks, items, and offerings along with your level. In return you receive a bloody cosmetic. The max amount of times you can do this for one character is 3.
---
Only if you have pallets/vaults. In the start of the match what are the chances to run to a spot where there's zero gens? If they're SWF and say "Guys! This guy's got Surge and I'm going to run to this side!" So they then have to avoid looping in XYZ spot unless they want Surge to take effect. So the survivors would then have to be very confident of their looping abilities or be close enough to a broken loop. And what if they're facing a killer that can shut down looping? Or a one-shotter like Myers? 
---
The way I see it, Surge is a win/win perk without much they can do to counter it.
---
That's exactly what I meant
---
Loop a bit,  throw a pallet,  walk away,  voila dh active and run to the next loop 😊
---
Still don't understand why rank reset is a thing...
---
I prefer not wasting my hard earned Shards on perks I can easily get with Bloodpoints. I'd rather save my Shards and buy new killers/survivors so I can level them and get their perks as well as more variety since I have another character to use. That or buy cosmetics. And if it's a perk by a licensed killer/survivor then I'mma wait til the dlc goes on sale or wait til I have extra money THEN level them up for their perks, just like I did with Freddy, LF, Mikey and Pig.
---
-Oink
---
DID YOU JUST ASSUME THEIR GENDERS?! I kid. Though I'm pretty sure the Entity is female, or identifies as such, since its half-arsed human form is Nea.
---
Real talk, never understood why some killers play for kills instead of maximizing BP. I always play with Chili &amp; prioritize getting 4 stacks, meaning I try my best not to tunnel.
---
Win for the survivors because they get me to play by their arbitrary rules of fairness and win for me because I get upwards of 25k bp every game.
---
You don't have to blot out names unless you're shedding the names in question is a bad light, like saying they're bad or dumb or something, this post would've been completely okay to leave the usernames visible
---
Exactly. This is going to be problematic for sure.
---
I don’t understand, in the slightest, why people camp with killers who can teleport or who have movement abilities. If it’s like, the doctor I can at least be like “okay you’re scared you won’t get over here in time to make up for it” (and still be salty) but with somebody who can teleport or be back on you in a couple seconds makes no sense at all
---
I don’t know anything about hellraiser so what would his power be?
---
That's just a nonsensical argument. Yes they both have alternate worlds, but that doesn't mean the ONLY possible way different worlds could be implemented was pre-rework Freddy.
---
There's basically infinite ways the upside-down could have differed from the basic world, even just splitting objectives and totems between them so they aren't all on the same plane of existence.
---
Just boiling it down to "nah it would've been Freddy" is the same as people who said we didn't need Ghostface because his power HAD TO BE the same as Legion's.
---
Fellow survivors aren't actually your teammates unless you're in a SWF group, some will screw you over for fun, others to ensure their own survival, nothing wrong with the latter but the first is a bit of a dick move I guess
---
If you intend on playing solo you should really learn to rely on only yourself, random survivors are worthless
---
Aight bro, I’m boutta head out
---
The solution is to get DS'd so they don't have it anymore
---
I've seen people on this subreddit complain in comments about it being op and that it should be nerfed, which is bs.
---
People seem to think that anything that is remotely situational is trash. lol  Perks shouldn't have to be game changing IMHO, they shouldn't have to effect your entire game, because that's when they become a crutch. It's just fine when they're a ... perk. Something that when it procs you are REALLY glad it does, but it's not something you rely on over and over.
---
Dont play billy in a boring way
---
They said though that they were either going to do Hawkins Lab, or Starcourt Mall. If they had enough time for Starcourt to have been an option, then surely they'd have had enough time to develop a Scoops Ahoy skin
---
I'm just hoping Nancy gets one alongside Steve based on Robin's
---
So players have an incentive to get back in the game so they have that “clout” as some people say on xbone and PS4
---
That's what happened. True True
---
Teabagging saved my life in my early DbD days. There was a guy I had ran into and I knew I was dead so I just just teabagged. Then he killed everyone else, picked me up, then carried me to the hatch. Was a true hero. I asked him after why he did it and he said because he found teabagging funny so he made it his rule if you teabag then he lets you live. I miss him.
---
kinda looks like willne with that chin ngl
---
Is rank reset every 13th of every month ?
---
Look, all I'm saying, is... It takes a meme to beat a meme. ;)
---
can we do a hatch reveal? i’ve always wondered where it lead
---
If you think you’re going to main a new character it’s a good idea to bank as much BP and shards as you can.  I usually like to have a million BP and 2K shards ready for a new release.
---
That’s a decent stun now. They can make distance and start a whole new chase. Then you better lock on and destroy them or they get that free heal. It sort of forces you to tunnel that survivor down.
---
Broken survivor
---
Yea u will see a lot of ppl like that. Hook tbaggers, hatch campers, bush ornaments, faint heartbeat gotta runners, killer trains, sandbaggers, etc
---
Just try to look past it buddy, playing with RANDOS can be stressful depending on how they are. I can't tell u how many times I've been on hook and died on 1st hook cause everyone is off doing gens/totems or even crouching/hiding the entire time, that or camping hatch.
---
They really wasted this license, its a shame
---
Yay
---
Dwight IS Mr Cote

Yeep

They come in thirteens...

I have had solo teams that just rush me in basement and then talk shit about how I camped when all they did was go for unhooks and right before I even got one hook, they did 3 gens instantly. Try to bully me once, thats on me. Try to bully three times over, you are getting camped, no way around it.
---
Actually, how is it that camping is bad when you force it on the killer to actually have a chance at winning or at least getting a 2K?
---
Think about it. You hook someone, go to patrol the area and see if its okay to go and check on gens, suddenly you see the whole team huddled up in formation ready to kamikaze into the basement or hook and just have it all end miserably cause non of them committed to actually going down so someone else could be saved and then having them be saved while other people do gens. Instead of maximizing and profiting from efficiency, they end up killing themselves.

I always thought of the campfire area as DBD purgatory so the hatch would lead staight back to the campfire for them to wait until hell starts over again.
---
Cote wearing no tie and his causal open collar is making me thirst on main.
---
Yes 
---
Ash and Ghost didn't have a map
---
only in pips, not in bp
---
I always say as it is. They can report all me for it all they want, but they are crazy if they actually think ill look at all three of them and dont attempt to protect the sacrifice proggress.
---
Peepee is 3x longer
---
Still 3 stacks is weak. NC can consume those stack within the first 1-2 minutes of the game.
---
They’re introducing so many interesting survivors I don’t know what to do.  I left Claude and Meg for Ash, Shirtless David and Bill (new on Xbox).  Now Steve and Nancy???
---
Meanwhile I mostly play killer for BP to rank up my survivors.
---
They just mean.
---
It’s a skin... not a medal of honor. It offers absolutely no gameplay advantage. Like, lmao, let  people enjoy things, it doesn’t affect you in the least.
---
Lets be real
---
Characters used to be revealed the moment they became playable and that was much better, but the patches were FILLED with bugs that had to be fixed over the next few months.
---
When patches still roll out with bugs, there usually are over 40 bugfixes from the PTB
---
The actual point IS finding bugs. Getting to try out new shit is just to encourage people to play the test version
---
I thought I was saying hello to others by tbagging twice
---
no Sprint busting, dead harding straight away. Love it
---
But the [first teaser trailer for S3 shows him wearing the outfit](https://youtu.be/aXyju7zFwyE) and that was a year ago.
---
I love him too but he's a fucking unit. I feel like he'd be as big as Trapper (or it wouldn't do him justice).
---
Well I mean yes ur right but u also gotta see that there's a LOOOT of bugs in dbd atm. I don't think they wanted to make any new mechanics and stack even more on us, granted the Stranger Things will give us more bugs regardless but that's also less they gotta deal with. 
---
That or they just running out of ideas or they couldn't think of anything else for the Demogorgon
---
So you already have pressure and you don’t need more of it, neat
---
weak jump animation, 3/10
---
Love that you used the Funko Pop version of the demogorgon.
---
It's always been p2w. The people that stuck around this long are clearly okay with that.
---
I personally really like the insane map pressure his rework gives him. I just wish they kept the dream world mechanics the same. The new alarm clocks are just 2 second pig boxes. He was the only DLC killer I had for a while, and his old playstyle combined with palette vacuums, and toxic survivors made me quit for a year. Though as a result I'm still a new-ish player. But, now I can actually have fun, before it was just *click click click* *Blinded* *palette drop on face* *palette looping*
---
Yes!!!!!! Thank you!!Haunted grounds would be great!! Rather than iron
---
Well the reason why people don’t consider P2W is because the new killers aren’t required to play the game and be good at it or at least that’s how I see it.
---
Fair enough but not giving any explanation and just saying it should've been able to go to the upside down isnt really explaining how it would it be different from freddy due to it being the same concept aswell i have no clue what you are referring to on your last point. there was no real debate over why we shouldn't have ghost face due to their powers being completely different from each other and only really sharing the m1 aspect
---
That's all? Meh. Assumed they would categorize the addons and perks so that we get more of what we want and less of the unnecessary forced junk.
---
Because I play lots of Ghostface I walk over doing it to them when they do it but they just leave and run away.....
---
Awwww, baby Demi is super cute ;__; 
---
Don’t hurt it.
---
I was scared of snakes :(
---
not possible
---
Same, especially with Ruin
---
I'm one of those guys that dropped Ruin completely. So I run: BBQ, Pop, Corrupt Intervention, and Thanatophobia. When I use Thana I always pair it with Swing Chains and either Red Paint Brush or Jump Rope. If I see a medkit or two I'll swap out Corrupt Intervention for Franklin's Demise. I'll most likely swap out Corrupt Intervention for Surge when that's out.
---
Also it wasn't really an argument you just perceived it as one since all i really said is it that it would be a the same as freddy Being able to pull you in his realm
---
I guess because i’m in the green ranks. Killers don’t do well with using their pop. It never effected the game for me or my team
---
I take what i said back then. It must super strong in the higher levels 
---
My apologies and thank you for explaining, kind stranger
---
Good lord, just get them individually with auric cells.
---
FeelsBadMan
---
Iron Maiden Huntress is queen
---
I kind of agree. However, the add ons will determine if he’s mid tier or high tier IMO. If they’re useless and don’t do much, I’ll have to agree that he’s missed potential.
---
The “counterplay” is running iron will and not running when she is phasing. Other than that, it becomes a guessing game: you can throw a pallet and slow vault to the other side, fast vault a window and slow vault it again. Don’t wait at pallets. 
---
While in a loop, don’t stand where she can collision with you.
---
But like I said, it’s a guessing game. You have no way to tell what she’ll actually do.
---
it doesnt, the devs said already in the stream reveal that the heal system works based on charges, you need to reach a certain amount of charges to activate the perk, if someone helps you to heal a person yo dont reach the required amount
---
You would guess wrong. Spirit before her release was buffed and again after she came out. Legion, though shouldn’t have shipped out in almost any incarnation, had two stuns in the fatigue and vaulted even further than normal. Plague did have a nerf from testing to live because she used to hold her vomit at full speed, but that’s actually op for her. Ghostface was terrible in the first half of their PTB because you could break him out by just spinning your camera and tagging him somewhere and he had an unnessicary whooshing noise around him that still gave him away. I’ve been around for a while, my friend.
---
I wasn’t clear enough in my original post. I meant the pounce attack cone is just long enough to reach a survivor on the other side of a pallet or window similar to how Myers extended lunge can net himhits.
---
If he’s 12 feet tall how many inches is his sausage pizza?
---
The game isn't pay to win.
---
Pretty sure surveillance and thrilling tremors are the only perks that will actually work with surge
---
I feel this
---
This is so fucking perfect, lmao.
---
Don’t worry, The Entity isn’t going to hurt its new buddy. The survivors and their pallets, on the other hand...
---
Oof ok so I facecamp, BUT only under the conditions of: 
---
I have a daily ritual that should be done
---
 or 
---
if these groups of people are just demolishing me.
---
I'm sorry :'(
---
&gt; Yea u will see a lot of ppl like that. Hook tbaggers
---
I have like 1400 hours and i don't think i've had this happen to me more than 3 times. Its rare that people purposely won't unhook you and t bag in front of you.
---
Tf is a pallet gonna do to it its gonna yeet the pallet at us
---
So, am I wrong for purposely going after those? I have the “if he dies, he dies” mentality when a hex is present.
---
I mean obviously I'd state opinions. But most of them are fueled by what the devs said about them. But anyway, no need to let your petty self out my dude. See a post you don't like? Scroll past it instead of trying to put yourself above the person who made it.
---
Well yeah but Im just curious how much a freddy with regression addons and those perks would regress a gen with 99% progress
---
*Killer enters bloodlust*
---
“You’ve got red on you.”
---
Oh, uhh, ok i got it. I cant believe they........ gave a perk to help.......... make the killer not tunnel??? Thats the best i git this chapter is unsalted
---
I got a nasty 3 gen (unintentional) while playing as Freddy today and legit gen was 99'd right infront of hooked survivor so it was seriously 
---
Face camp and delay the game by like 75 seconds while they go for another gen and also get a free kill
---
Or
---
Respect the survivor handbook, do a lap of the map and come back to a rescued survivor, a completed gen and an open gate with 3 teabagging fuck bags that get would get salty at getting 4k'd by a level 23 freddy with only level 1 perks and brown addons using noed (and not even having it activate in the match mind you) because what would i rather use, the level 1 noed or the level 1 insideous?
---
Personally i picked the first one sorry, in MY OPINION... it was the most obviously effective way for me to win the game... sue me for using that in a competitive pvp game.
---
But ok tldr basically i never facecamp in any regular games (ok unless i RARELY play some sort of dickass basement bubba build just because, BUT THAT'S RARE PLEASE DON'T HURT ME) but if it honestly is the safest way for me to achieve my goal then so be it. Man's gotta do what he gotta do, son. Kevin. Forsen.
---
Oh yeah before I forget PLEASE SOMEONE SEND THIS TO THE TWITCH STREAMER KNOWN AS desTINY (JK I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING MAN LUV YA CUNT(PS I TRY NOT TO SWEAR THAT VULGARLY HOPE THAT'S A WORD BTW)) soz about caps but yeah anyway I've been watching your youtube since you spoke on the mrdeadmoth situation and drew me in by surprise about how similar our opinions are on the matter, since then you've really changed my mind on a lot and I honestly don't know if this is coincidence or not but christ i swear my life has gotten better ever since you shifted me towards the liberal capitalistic lsd trip of a generation's worth of lifetimes. Ive even reduced myself of saying gamer words by at least 95% (a new record since 2003!). But yeah also i would really like to talk about that emmia (hope that's her name) situation with hasan and I'd like to get a sort of update of what's happened since the youtube video went up. I genuinely do hope you see this so we can talk sometime...... TALK ABOUT HOW TO GET ME $500,000+ PER YEAR OFF TWITCH IN ONLY 12 SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS (WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS OFF STREAM DW I WON'T TELL NO ONE WON'T WANNA FLOOD THE MARKET OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN ALRIGHT) nah but seriously how should I invest my money I'm not spending my paychecks all that much so I'm just sitting on cash that's not doing anything. I want something really risk free because seriously if I get a bunch of money, invest into the life that leads to and then have everything crash to 0's in an instant i probably would just have to blow my brains out i wouldn't handle it... so basically anything low risk but still has some decent gains attached, it might sound lame but it's my number 1 dream to love forever and i guess i feel like the more money you have the closer you get to that goal and the more people you love that you get to bring with you to immortality. But ok oh shit btw if none of this makes sense shout out to young manz pizza4god u no who u r for hooking me up with some i guess lifechanging weed holy shite MY BODY WAS IN SYNC WITH PINK FLOYD'S - TIME IT WAS AMAZING so yeah I'm high as balls off two puffs of a skinny ass joint and idk why tf i thought this was a good idea because knowing my luck this message might actually be the literal death of me somehow... but yeah idk dood (patch 1.01:- fixed the bug where "dood" in sentence above showed up as "fam" for some users. Our sincerest apologies to anyone who may have been offended by this unintentional glitch in the game) hmu if you interested idk I'm out before i post more cringe OH FUCK WAIT THAT GIRL YOU PLAYED MINECRAFT WITH THAT SAID MURDER AND YOU THOUGHT IT SOUNDED LIKE GAMER CRINGE I JUST WANNA SAY THAT LITTLE PERFECT AMOUNT OF RASP IN HER VOICE IS WHAT I LIVE FOR HOLY CHRIST, IF YOU WANT HMU THEN HMU TOO BUT IF NOT THAT IS TOTALLY ACCEPTABLE I WOULD UNDERSTAND IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO MUCH MORE THAN CHUCKLE AT THIS POST HOLY SHIT what am i saying. just say she has a nice voice christ. Thats it. So easy. Oh yeah shout out to jerma985 he's just a champ and i love him so much i imagine he would be such a brilliant aspect to have in your life. Destiny u cool hmu. And cute raspy voice girl (i think your name was kaaaaaate? Not sure I'm really sorry I'm so bad with names i need to hear them like 18 times before i even remember just the FIRST name) keep doin u girl u cute

KAAAAAAAAPA123 LOOOOOOOOLE PEPE

Oh fuck ps i almost forgot, give me reddit gold you pay piggy bitches. I love people that HATE MONEY.
---
Oh PPS THANKS PINK FLOYD FOR TURNING A REALLY BAD GREEN OUT INTO A LIFE CHANGING (IN A POSITIVE WAY) EVENT OF EMOTIONS I'VE ONLY DREAMED OF WHILE LISTENING TO YOUR SONG "TIME", WHICH WAS ALWAYS SUCH A CLOSE CONTENDER FOR MY FAVOURITE SONG OF ALL TIME BUT NOW I KNOW IT WILL NEVER LEAVE MY HEART AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE
---
 *SWF is not toxic. Some people that play SWF are toxic, but the very concept of it isn't.*
---
Not toxic, just unfair and unreasonable to the solo survivors who have no way to communicate.
---
*Teabagging isn't toxic. It's stupid, completely stupid on the survivor's part, but if you get angry at this oh boy you got some weak self-control. Get over it, just punish it with a hit and here you go.*
---
Definitely literally exists to BE toxic so yes it is by proxy toxic and disrespectful behavior. Comes from teabagging people's bodys back in old FPS IIRC.
---
*Flashlight and pallet saves ain't toxic. Saving people, sometimes at the cost of taking a hit, is one of the objectives of the game for survivors. Altruistic behaviour is one of the objectives, literally.*
---
Correct. Not toxic.
---
*Sabotaging hooks in front of the killer holding a survivor isn't toxic. It's another altruistic behaviour. Though it's really dumb because sabo is the worst playstyle right now, it's so far down in the meta holy fuck.*
---
*Bodyblocking isn't toxic. Saving people by bodyblocking the killer is an altruistic AND bold behaviour. Still part of the game. Same way: bodyblocking survivors that got themselves in a bad spot is a normal behaviour as you'll easily get them down after that: and that's the killer's objective...*
---
*Flashlight clicking isn't toxic. Sometimes they do it to get your attention, sometimes to piss you off. Either way, it's the same as teabagging: if you're angry at this, what a legendary self-control... Honestly just ignore them, or wait for the right moment to get a hit on them, when they think they're safe.*
---
Depends. If they are doing it in your face just to be a dick when there's a clear distinction in skill level due to shit matchmaking I'm going to say this falls under bullying and 100% toxic. 
---
*Instant heals and instant downs ain't toxic. Survivors complaining about instant downs while using instant heals are stupid. Killers complaining about instant heals while using instant downs are stupid. If you can use an instant, others can too. Get over it.*
---
*Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time and Adrenaline and other perks ain't toxic. Some might be a bit too strong (I'm talking about Adrenaline and NOED here), but that's all there is about it. If you feel like someone having the ability to escape you instantly because you want to ruin their game by tunneling them is toxic... Well get your shit together honestly.*
---
*Tunneling isn't toxic. Yeah I know I just said "get your shit together" to tunnelers, but yet it's not toxic. It's kinda unfair, I know, but it's not toxic. If you're getting tunneled, try to run the killer around for the longer time, and when you're dead, just remember that you're finally out and you can move on to some other game.*
---
Definitely ruins the game for one person and also a flaw in the matchmaking system that leads to straight up bullying of weaker players. It's a dick move when there's a clear discrepancy in skill and 100% toxic as fuck. When I play killer I either never go for the same person twice or I intentionally tunnel LITERALLY to ruin their fun. 
---
*Camping is not toxic. Facecamping... Well you could discuss it. But camping, playing around the hook, isn't toxic. Survivors got ways of dealing with this. If you don't use them... Then don't complain and blame yourself.*
---
It's toxic. Definitely a dick move to ruin 1 person's game at the expense of losing your own. Yet again I only do this to people I'm pissed off at and what I'm doing is toxic with the intention of ruining that one person's game. Same as everyone else who does it. 
---
*Mori after 1st hook isn't toxic. It stops the game real fast for someone, yes, but at least they can move on to another game. Just deal with it.*
---
*Slugging until bleeding out isn't toxic. It's a bit not nice to play like that, you're litterally holding people hostages in the game when you could hook them and end that game quicker... But well, if you wanna do it, I'll just go and grab some food or coffee while my character's dying.*
---
If there's 2 survivors left it's a valid strategy to keep the hatch from popping but if you're just making everyone bleed out slowly that's holding the game hostage and 100% toxic. Anytime you do ANYTHING to ruin another person's experience beyond the scope of winning or losing it's fucking toxic. 
---
*3 gens strat isn't toxic. If the survivors don't have enough brain to avoid this situation... It's their fault for having a bad strategy.*
---
*Gen rushing isn't toxic. Even more: gen rushing isn't even a thing. It's literaly the objective: doing gens and escaping as quickly as possible. If you got gen rushed, you just didn't put enough pressure. Try another build, another path, watch videos to get better. You can do it.*
---
Correct. The opposite of toxic. Do the objective. Do gens. Drop survivors. Hook them. End of story. That's the game.
---
*Taking a last hit before going out isn't toxic. Most of the time, people do that to let the killer get some more points.*
---
It's usually a sign of respect, like leaving behind your item. So actually opposite of toxic.
---
*Insulting in after game chat. Why the hell would you do that?*
---
To be toxic. 
---
*Saying "gg ez" like you need to belittle others to feel good: you don't, you just won, enjoy it and stop being an ass.*
---
That's insulting. You addressed that. The purpose is to ruin someone else's day as much as possible. 
---
*Commenting on steam profiles to insult people.*
---
Never even heard of this.
---
*Holding people hostages in the game. I'm thinking of that clip where we see a Doctor that trapped 4 people upstairs of the thompson's house.*
---
Clearly toxic and as with everything else toxic should be punishable to keep the community free of disease.
---
*Farming survivors. Unhooking without BT in front of the killer is a shitty behaviour. If you do it, you deserve some kind of punishment for ruining others game on purpose.*
---
Not toxic every time, sometimes just stupid. 
---
*Pointing out where are other survivors. I sometimes do it with my friends but only because we do that to each other. We have fun betraying each other. But don't do that to people who didn't do anything to you.*
---
Toxic and IIRC punishable by permaban.
---
Tf is that hair?
---
or you could just get rid of the different tier for a perk and just be one. that would make it faster to get perks
---
Unescessary subreddit link
---
Yep, and if we look at the statistics the lower ranks use self-care more than the higher ranks.
---
As I said before, at high ranks there is no time to waste using self-care. People are finally starting to realize this, buddy.
---
I really like How you explain it to him like he’s never been playing the game before
---
I'll have to give him (her?) a try, I've had him for a couple of weeks but haven't played him yet.
---
You’re a monster
---
I’d love for some more lore, this is my favorite game rn
---
Once you hear her Whooshing sound, don't panic, just walk to the closest wall and try your best to make her not see you. Once in a chase, don't stay too long in a pallet, she will know how to mind game you, what you can do is mind game her when she tries to phase walk into you, by running away from the pallet, she might get lost thinking you are still there.
---
Is he human? Isnt he a demon that takes human shape? I dont know much about it but i think i heard that but could be wrong
---
Hellraiser chapter with pinhead and Kristy cotton with labyrinth map please
---
LAMP?!
---
Fixated + Sprint Burst + Iron Will + Spine chill will be a really good build against all sorts of killers, even spirit. You'll be able to sprint away when the killer is near, if he follow your scratchmarks you'll receive the notification from Spine chill, then all you have to do is to walk away to hide.
---
Also you can use it not in a imersed way, can loop the killer in a T wall into the shack, the lack of visibility can give you a free scape. Fixated is a really strong perk, the best of all 6, hope it don't get nerfed
---
Even if you pay for new killers with the purpose of getting their teachables, you still have to grind for hours to get them to level 40 not to mention how many blood webs you go through to unlock the perk on the character(s) you want.  I think the reason many people over look the P2W aspect of DBD is because even if you pay, you still have to grind for everything.  Weather or not you buy a character it will boil down to your hours not your money.  If you could purchase a level 50, all perk, 3P demagorgen for $20 that would be some P2W.
---
She looks closer to Nancy in this pic.
---
I'm still a relatively new killer, and quite new to DBD as a whole, so I don't have BBQ yet. I only stay in the area if I know they're close by because I've seen them physically, or their scratch marks. Obviously I can't talk for everyone, but that's me personally. If I don't see anyone or any scratch marks, I'll go hunt, but turn around to check on the hook every 5 seconds or so whilst I'm walking to a different area.
---
Oh wow. So the reason that game died off is because they wouldn't let them add new content to the game?
---
In total square footage of playable area, the Game is still larger than the Institute
---
You're ruining my immersion.
---
Awesome thank you!
---
Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they never stopped to think if they should.
---
Even the entity fears you now.
---
Drake, where's the Demogorgon?
---
Same
---
&gt; Some guy insulted me for being annoyed that the recent killers are just basically the old ones but revamped except for hag.
---
Because you said that Legion is the same as Spirit, moron
---
Death
---
Yes however if you were safely hidden, and begin healing, (knowing that the killer has NC) you could still be caught off guard if they're TR radius is smaller than the NC radius, which results in losing the distortion stacks pretty quick

They gotta add a minigame where, as revenge for getting a minion stolen, the Mindflayer has to go around stealing survivors from the Entity. Bonus points for how many times you can taunt the Entity and still leave with the survivors.
---
At least they brought the babysitter over too.
---
Ur late hombre
---
This game isn't pay to win and if you think it is then you're delusional. We haven't even seen surge in action yet and you're saying it's pay to win. Gtfo.
---
Some of the things you answered are actually interesting. Just to be clear, the "teabagging" point was not about people seeing they are clearly better and doing it to make fun of the killer. I was more thinking of those who are like "taunting" at the pallet, like "come on, try and hit, come on". You see?
---
But yeah the bullying way of using a flashlight is toxic, completely, and should be heavily punished. Though making matchmaking actually better (or just making a real matchmaking instead of the trash that exists nowadays) could help this point.
---
To me tunneling is not toxic because you're actually not focusing on your win if you tunnel. Going for someone else actually buys you time as the chased survivor can't do gens and the one you let go first needs healing. So you're consuming the survivors' time this way. So, tunneling instead of doing this is counter-productive, and even more than that it's mostly because of a lack of skill. That's an actual tactic to get someone who isn't better than you on hook to trick others to the hook. Your point still valid though
---
And camping is not toxic. Facecamping i'd say yes, but camping isn't as you not always go for the person who was on hook when they get unhooked. It's unpleasant as it is most of time tricky to deal with.
---
The slug one is... very arguable. On both sides. I hear you out and feel it too as I suffered it some times, but it really almost never happens... It's a shitty way to play but I wouldn't say toxic because you know, you spot it straight away and can just do something else in the meantime. (though I get why you'd put it as toxic)
---
And about that "insulting on steam profiles" thing, I always check steam profiles of people I'm playing with and some have that "-rep fuckin asshole" and other nice little words lol

---
Is unhooking really bullying? serious question because if someone gets hooked I always drop what in doing and go for rescue
---
Alright that’s perfectly fair then. I just hear a lot of people claim to “know” someone is nearby when in fact a few people hid in lockers so they couldn’t be seen with BBQ. But it’s totally acceptable to check on the hook every once in a while.
---
Why would you post this
---
Or chocolate or pet cats
---
Or PGTW?

Ignorance

I would assume it would work.
---
NO FIGHTER HAS EVER ESCAPED THE THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK.
---
thats honestly surprising. i feel like Joe would be the type of person to find it cool hes being added to a video game, and thus would happily help out. but realistically speaking they've probably just been wayyy too busy to come to the studio and record grunts
---
Most of the things I stated are labeled as not eligible to reports by the devs themselves, meaning they're not toxic... But well... The people that make the game and know what they want it to be surely are wrong.
---
Inner strength is gonna suck in the beginning due to everyone using her and breaking all the totems but once fewer people use her, combined with quick and quiet and it would probably be op

Looks like Myers is being influenced by Ghostface.

People like to throw the term pay to win when they don't truly understand it. Pay to win means you have to pay to get an advantage or have to win.
---
Dead by daylight is not that. You can play the entire game with the base perks and killers and do fine.
---
You can also just buy the perks directly when they show up on the shrine, or killers, without real money.
---
Dead by daylight is not pay to win.
---
No chapter
---
This really confused me, cheers for clearing things up.
---
“It’s right over there. See, I threw down a pallet and stunned him.”
---
The survivors are the bad guys
---
They need to a cosmetic for dart
---
I noticed a looooot of confusion so I thought I'd try and see if I could clarify a bit for some folks, really happy that Jannick is also now stepping in on the forums and offering a very similar explanation, some people were getting really uppity about how they believed it worked.
---
For me it is smooth most of the time but sometimes it goes a bit low, nothing unplayable tho (on standard ps4).
---
If this was the case then he would have been reset from rank 7 or 8 to be at 13 after reset. He's bad at the game if he's getting stomped on by a rank 16 and 13.
---
Wha
---
Why is it not called r/DBDick?
---
I’d probably put Adrenaline as the fourth perk. Get another burst of speed right at the end game.
---
Honestly I never thought they sounded quite different. Like if you’re listening to just the audio files there’s obviously some differences, but I don’t know why anyone would say the voice actor “butchered” it. It still has a solid semblance to bill, to the point that I can only really notice if I compare the two (here’s a [link to his left 4 dead original pain sounds](https://youtu.be/O8IJepb-hlQ) at 0:42)
---
Mind flayer is the entity. Until stranger things we just didn't know.
---
Cute
---
Immersed time then
---
Umm it’s a 20% walking speed boost that’s up permanently as long as not wounded.
---
That alone is absurdly powerful.
---
The question is does it impact or stack with other effects?
---
Does a 150% boost from sprint or lithe start at base or does it go off of the adjusted speed with Fixated?
---
What about crouched movement? Is it effected?
---
The way we’ve seen the game coded all states are just % modifiers of base speed...  so if you have a base speed increase then a crouched speed increase could we have characters walking crouched faster than those who are normally walking?
---
There is way more here at play in terms of value... the scratches thing?  Who cares if you’re moving around the map like a bullet without leaving them.
---
"Our" minion
---
Oh piss off with your perk-shaming.
---
Way to completely miss the point. In both scenarios you still have to make a "coin flip". It just turns out, with Spirit people feel dumber when they guess wrong so they get salty.
---
I today as  rank 12 killer got a full tema of purples but they played like they were rank 20s with some better looping and map knowledge

And it teachers survivors to cleanse those totems. But hey, who wants to run small game when you can get unhooked, run to a locker to use DS then get back into the locker so you can use Head On.
---
Can’t iridescent shards also by killers? Also another point I thought was a bit iffy. This is not the first time a game has done this. Look at R6 for example. they have the same situation
---
So the entity just simulated alien stuff so sticky walls with eggs instead of hooks still gens for survivors
---
What if the killer isn't bad. What if he can end the game beforehand. 
---
Nothing wrong with a little surprise &gt;_&lt;
---
Not a killer.
---
I don't care about the exposed effect, I just want to know their location
---
Down voted for truth.
---
That's.. What? Thru both have map mobility and chase powers
---
Tbf hag is only free for consoles
---
Bill you're holding the light wrong
---
I thought it would only activate if you are in the injured state
---
Sooo every single killer in the game? Lol
---
I'd rather they take 3-6 months to balance the game rather than dump new DLC onto us and expect us to buy it to slow the game down.

“I just got wrecked by NOED so I’m gonna cry about it on Reddit”

And that’s a fact!

---
Scooby Claudette when BHVR
---
Jesus how does blood lust affect the speeds?
---
Jus sayin for all those that stumble across this post. This is  an ‘A-pose’, not a ‘T-pose’. All the character models from dbd use A pose. Spread the truth    ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ
---
Good survivors don’t hide in lockers.
---
Yup. Also doing the objective also effectively counters NOED
---
Baby killer didn't even try to close it
---
Yeah but it’s like a stage in its evolution, like baby frogs start as spawn then become tadpoles etc
---
100% I actually prefer to walk everyone out the gate like a gracious host as long as I get 1 hook from everyone for my chili. But if someone acts like an asshole karma points are worth 10x more than blood points.
---
This just makes people want to do it more that’s all
---
I play alot with friends but we still get rekt more then I like to admit. Playing with friends is just so much more fun.
---
Fact my ass. The only factual thing here is that you are too damn stupid to cleanse totems. Go cry somewhere else.
---
Cote said they will support the game until 2020. So, when DbD 2 happens and none of your DLC costumes carry over and not every licensed character carries over then what then? 
---
You're trying to paint a picture that these are poor struggling developers who deserve a dollar when they have a company of 500 employees and made over $30 million last year. They're not some struggling indie dev scraping to get by.
---
I mean it's certainly a strategy, a losing strategy, but a strategy none the less. If your intent is to upset the person you're camping and you're willing to throw the game to accomplish it then there you go.
---
If you actually believe survivors are the weaker party at high tier play, I got news for you.
---
Yeah, fuck that. Great perk that
---
Actually, that' what we call an "opinion."
---
Maybe you do bones next time.
---
Will this perk only trigger on hex totems or on dull totems too?
---
Good Thing We Have a Dr. Running around in are Realm!
---
Never said that, just said their perks are weaker
---
Or give demogorgon 6
---
Nope. I just never liked the perk, even as killer.
---
Killer brings add-ons, offerings, and perks that help them accomplish their objective and reward them for doing it: This is good, this is okay.
---
Survivors bring items, add-ons, offerings, and perks that help them accomplish their objective and reward them for doing it: Toxic gen-rushing survivors.
---
Should we just petition BHVR to either remove gens as the survivors' objective or make them take five minutes each no matter how many people are on it or what toolboxes are used?
---
Demons to some. Angels to others.
---
You’re right you’re completely reasonable, i’ll just leave you to holding the devs hostage if they change the game. Take care.
---
True. Now they have a reason to so the objective lol. But i do get what you mean.
---
Watch uyliss and demi, monto isnt that good at game sense.
---
After 5 years of service I will be glad to purchase and support the next DBD.
---
Bruh that's all perks in the game; It's the literally the point of them to give bonuses that help you play above the level you're capable of without them, that's why they're perks and not skins.
---
I noticed
---
Well dead hard isn't a crutch perk. 95% of survivors don't even know how to use it correctly. It's a strong perk yeah. But it most definitely is not a crutch perk.
---
They were probably SWF and intentionally deranked
---
Fly you fools!
---
And not otzavarda is probably the best killer on yt
---
Okay. Whos your main killer, how long have you played killer. Depending on your awnser you will look even more stupid.
---
Can someone point out where the survivor is in this picture (if there is one)? I’m so corn blind
---
I think this new DLC will bring a lot of unused perks into the light with indirect buffs due to their interactions with the new perks. Make Your Choice, and Iron Maiden seem to be the most obvious. Small Game got a small buff with the introduction of Inner Strength especially at lower ranks where Survivors aren’t the best at finding totems. I think Decisive also got a small buff from Inner Strength. (Get unhooked, sprint to a locker, killer either has to wait for you to heal in the locker, or pull you out and take the DS, basically eliminates the risk of being slugged) I think Mettle of Man got a buff from Babysitter as Babysitter encourages taking protection hits. Better Together buffs Discordance. 
---
Maybe I’m being too optimistic, but I think this DLC will change up the survivor meta drastically. I’m very excited to see how the new perks pan out for the future of the game.
---
The cosplay on the left is ass ngl
---
I play killer about half the time, and I main hillbilly and Nurse.
---
I'm pretty sure it triggers on both
---
Oh no, please don't remove the terror radius from Ghost face and pig's powers. Whatever will we do?
---
A opinion cant be wrong though. So its called being wrong.
---
Bold of you to assume the doc wouldn't just torture the shit out of it. 
---
You know, that makes me wonder if the killers would just start attacking each other if the entity didn't keep them in check.
---
Okay. So why isnt hillbilly bad. He has 1 shot by default. Why arent you crying about that.
---
“Alright then flashlight blind him.”
---
“Okay I will.”
---
*pallet is smashed by spirit fury* 
---
“Ok I see the problem”
---
It still tickles me that some people consider Freddy "OP"
---
Photo quality is bad, it is way more detailed in rl and we took the picture spontaneous so we didn't have much time to put it on perfectly.
---
No need for negativity
---
The military mullet
---
Wow...
---
I'm not exactly sure what I said that made you feel the need to start calling names and making personal attacks...
---
I'm sorry if I did something to incite you to treat me like that, but I'm a human being and I really don't think it's okay for you to say the kinds of things you did to me just now.
---
I understood that reference!
---
The average rank for those survivors is 11.25 so it’s certainly not that far away from the rank 15 killer. 
---
Also, the killer managed to kill all of them (and as Wraith!!) including the rank 4 player. So I don’t think matchmaking was a big factor in this one.
---
Let’s see.. I can buy 1 apex skin right now for 20$ and I can’t ever see the skin in game, or 3 dead by daylight characters, and get 9 fucking godly perks. Pretty easy decision for me. Dbd for the win.
---
Could’ve named Mindbreaker, Mindflayer instead.
---
Shorter than Dwight
---
U should stop playing the game for a while if those look like them
---
Tbh that's literally the only thing Spine Chill won't help you with, and considering how many times its gonna save your ass against Pig/Ghostface/Tier 2+ Myers in particular, it's well-worth the perk slot IMO.
---
So honest question: What is the solution when a high rank player and a low rank player want to play SWF together? 
---
Because everyone complains about matchmaking but I don’t hear any actual solutions.
---
I would too, but thid doesnt really have anything to do with the discussion
---
Base dwight is based on a different employe i don't remember which one but it's not MCote
---
In the first film (s)he's a interdimensional pervert from an unspecified origin. I think they ended up giving him a dumbass backstory that should be ignored.
---
Yeah that's fair, face camping at EGC to secure a kill or second stage can be tactical and efficient. But I was mainly referring to the instant face camping you see at lower ranks.
---
but in the actual size, it's not
---
I made a post about NOED. It doesn't mean I dont like some survivor perks either.
---
Are you able to use Inner Strength and the Second Wind only once or multiple times as long as you fulfil the requirements?
---
Stake out
---
Rushing hooks is kind of considered bullying cause the killer can only hit you so many times and in theory it would take 6 hits to actually down 3 people. So if you have coordination you can rush the basement have everyone leave injured. The killer can only chase one person too.
---
Damn I’m into some weird stuff then bahahah. They’re jus different. Not sure they’re even comparable to each other.
---
Genius! Why didn't I think of that?
---
When you make a double back at a shack doorway and see survivor make an awkward circle in the middle of it instead of vaulting over a window.
---
Okay. You have a fair point. Now why do you think NOED is bad? Other than the bad meme. How do you think it could be very easily countered?
---
Is it stupid? They are the only running killers with hillbilly. It would be a stupid statement if running was the ability of every killer which isnt the case in dbd. Checkmate.
---
Well said. I loved the dream world aspect as that’s what he does in the movies. He doesn’t teleport in movies haha
---
noed is adrenaline for killers, so they should nerf adrenaline as well
---
Your opinion is wrong. EARTH IS A CUBE! IM RIGHT. REEEEEEEEEE (im just fucking around. Your opinion m8)
---
That's the one
---
The game really wants you to P3 your perks. Hmmmm
---
Definitely downsides, yeah. I think it is absolutely worth taking in the slot a person would usually pack self care though, even if it comes with the risk of being only used once per game because other teammates thought the same thing.
---
I don't know what it was. Never had that happen.
---
I never said noed was bad. It's a great perk. So great that its overpowered. To counter it, you cleanse totems. But I refuse to waste so much time being the only one cleansing totems because literally no one else cleanses.
---
It takes 8 seconds (currently) at rank 3. Chances are you will usually have 8 seconds before the killer gets to the basement and checks the back locker, which will be the optimal one to WALK to. Most killers returning right to the basement with no scratch marks are gonna check the front two lockers first, cause logically if they check the back one, that's just a free escape from the other two.
---
Don’t forget you can literally buy non licensed killers (ex. Hag and her teachables in the store) for shards (F2P)
---
I mean I don't think I have ever pipped up on a 14k game as a killer.
---
It should
---
&gt; Second Wind (3/10) - Not a big fan of this perk. You have to heal someone, then after being unhooked you cannot be healed by others or with insta med-kit (both ways are faster). It will also make you unable to use adrenaline for around 20 seconds. You'd be better off taking a med-kit or even Self Care.
---
as someone who doesn't heal very often, this sounds dank to me
---
There is. The Upside down is blue, normal is normal :3
---
The skills? What are you talking about? I didn't mention anything about perks.
---
It's not even 50/50. You have to make guesses, the spirit doesnt really have to guess she just has to listen. That's why shes overpowered. The mind game is heavily in her favor.
---
Sounds good
---
Heres the downvote you ordered
---
I believe it will. Second Wind has a Broken status of 20 seconds while Deliverance has it for 60. So you'd have to wait the full 60.
---
so you want more of "I want easier pity kills to make me feel better and not 0k and the survivors deserve no opportunity whatsoever of trying to make a save"
---
I suspect because it doesn't affect uninjured walking, that they aren't changing the base speed, this is just modifying the base speed when certain conditions (uninjured, walk) are met. So it shouldn't have any effect on crouch or run speed.
---
Wait. They said they started working on a BIG chapter right after ghostface and it isnt stranger things cause they started with it right after releasing the Plague. You can be right and if its pinhead i will suck my own peen
---
Ithey did say the Netflix team gave them a lot of free range. So hopefully some cool alternatives that wouldn't be in the actual show.
---
I dunno. Just play “I love you guys!” Fragtrap with excalabastard and every kill should heal ya
---
No wait that’s borderlands presequel... whoops.
---
I've got about 400 less subscribers than him. 
---
So that's a huge compliment! Thanks!
---
Quieres?
---
Honestly you could have got one if em because they were one shot and all clumped together, Accidental body blocking would have got you a kill
---
I will pack survivors I downed to the gate if the game is played fairly (I normally just play killer for rituals) and I love that! Karma points 😂
---
How can I delete someone else's post?
---
The movie ends with Dwight hiding in a locker and Nea endlessly chanting "EZ BABY KILLER"
---
Yeah, I get where you're coming from. There are certain situations where I could maybe see it being better than just playing the game, but I feel like those are fewer and farther between than the people who just dc willy-nilly when things don't go their way.
---
What I'm Thinking Is It Will Heal You Through Deliverance.
---
I honestly consider BBQ to be more mandstory than ruin.
---
Because game is balanced by a 1v1 logic. Cooperation is not something devs counted on. At least not that big which SWF enabled (Which was not present in game before)
---
Combined with reducing hitboxes for survivors and keeping them same for killers, make survivors way faster in loopings then they should be. 
---
Which results in one looper perk guy and three generator repair survivors. Which results in REALLY FRUSTRATING match for any killer. 
---
So no cheating, just really unbalanced and unfair towards killers. Only two killers which are able to deal with this are Nurse and The Spirit.
---
Except when you run iron will. You run into cornfield and than just walk to the side. Spirit stops phasing where scratch marks end and start to look around and sees corn. A lot of corn. Unless it's father's glasses, of course.
---
Your love for the Doctor is fucking adorable and what I strive for.
---
Sometime in September, that's all we know for now
---
I’m still waiting for it on Freddy... I unlocked the teachable 4 months ago
---
I can get a 4K without BBQ on most killers, but if I don’t get ruin the gens will be done by my 3rd hook if I’m not absolutely destroying.
---
September, A Week After Whenever PTB Is Live. No Confirmed Date
---
Oh ok well thank you for your help anyway! 🙂
---
But they're absolutely different. Very rarely is there a time when there's a true coin flip with the rest of the killer roster (only ever happens on short loops that you can't see over) and even then you have something to go off of if the killer doesn't hide his red glow perfectly, and you only have 2 options. With Spirit, you don't know which way she went and you don't know if she even phased in the first place. If she's doing the mInD gAmEs tactic of standing still, then you're boned no matter what you do. If you run to one side, she sees where you're running and phases to there. If you leave the loop, she sees you leave and follows. If you stand still trying to wait out her standing still, then it's a guessing game as to when she phases. 
---
With other killers, the odds are 50/50 at worst, moreso if the killer doesn't play it well. With Spirit, it's like 80/20, no matter what you do.
---
It was a fun game but to me it seemed like the devs didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. Lawsuit aside, they barely put out any content and the one new gamemode they had planned got scrapped. A real same.
---
Not really dude, it's also to get the perks working in as many scenarios as possible to find bugs and imbalances. For instance there may end up being an obvious exploit combing a killer power with some new perks, that only gets spotted if people play as all sorts of characters and perk combos in the PTBs.
---
I’ve kinda got the same issue with my Myers... the game refuses to give me any perk but Surveillance
---
September. We dont have a specific day yet but my guess is early September
---
Yes. It is very fucking stupid. Their playstyles and *actual* abilities -absent the totally uninteresting "running" facet - are world's apart
---
you have no confidence of your ability as killer then if you think the best you can win is that single chase and never be able to catch them again. A survivor dying on first hook is lost points in 3 categories(4 depending on what killer you are) of Brutality with hits, Hunting with chases, and Sacrifice for multiple hooks, and Deviousness if your power is applicable.
---
Followed by the Melee theme
---
yeah i imagine you spend a lot of time looking for that 6th totem
---
The  stranger things mindflayer queen/ hivemind thing is possibly the closet paralell we have to the entity. 
---
I mean os you've seen s3, the other killers could all potentially be hosts...
---
More like when any SwF group loses a match
---
Honestly I agree with most of that shit besides tbagging, cuz it basically is saying “gg ez” it’s bragging and that’s toxic (other stuff can be irritating but it’s part of the game)
---
/r/excgarated
---
5*
---
If I become a survivor character in DBD, the Doctor will be my obsession forever EVEN he’s a killer.
---
To be fair everyone's chances are different lol. For example u could get it like once a month and someone else could get it once a week. It just depends on how unlucky u are
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Except those guys that use a meme build because he wants to have fun and doesn't care about others dying/losing.
---
Tbh this DLC is like a dream starter pack for the game. Rather than picking up 5 different dlc with relevant perks across them, you just get this one which comes with sidegrade Urban Evasion, different kind of self heal, pop goes the weasel like perk, etc. It might feel like power-creep in some ways but I think it's a great idea that will help newer players a lot.
---
The lawsuit is still going. The writer and alleged rights holder to Jason went to court, and a judge ruled that the writer held the rights to the first screenplay. Apparently that wasn’t good enough so the rights holder appealed it. This was around April 2019. Larry Zerner, a lawyer involved with the case, said that it likely wouldn’t be settled until around May 2020. If the other party tried to appeal it to the Supreme Court, then October 2020.
---
people are over hyping the shit out of 90% of the perks being released (in their current state). they love their dumb netflix tv, and cant accept that Behaviours perk designs are still doodoo. 
---
the most I can say about the nine perks being released is that even the weakest ones can likely be coupled with other already existing perks, in order to make goofy combos. nothing meta-shifiting in my opinion, though.
---
Oh...this is just my Stand...PURPLE FLASHLIGHT!
---
im not agreeing with op but id like to point out that anytime someone says "noed bad" there is ALWAYS someone there waiting to say "OH YEAH? ADRENALINE BUDDY HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT?"
---
Why would someone blame you for cleansing haunting grounds? What if it's not haunting grounds?
---
honestly radical larry seems like he would fit into dbd very well
---
I dont get why people want Pinhead when he doesn't even kill anybody in the movies. Hes a demon holding the rituals with the cubes.
---
Surge, overcharge, pop and huntress lullaby. Kick all gens back to 0
---
Just stop chasing and check the gens if ya wasted too much time in a chase, “gen rush” should just be called playing the game because that’s your main objective
---
It goes based on the average ranks of the swf. So prob green ranks would be most common, with some purple and yellows
---
This looks like one of the more decent builds, as "gimmicky" as it is. I'll definitely at least try it lol
---
Some countries, I want to say Germany in particular, but EU countries, have laws prohibiting depictions of children in violence. China and South Korea also have some stiff laws regarding depictions of humans and violence.
---
No, why should we?
---
I use all white coloured cosmetics for meg because I want the killer to  chase me (and because I always seem to get found first anyway), if anyone else gets in a chase they go down in the first 20 seconds.
---
Claudette and Feng art? Easy upvote. Great job btw\~!
---
Too time consuming and we're getting perks that use totems as fuel xP Maybe increase the count by 1 (4 Total/5 max), They start with 3 And have players gain them for escaping chases to ensure they can't kite a full match
---
And the extra sad part of the wraith lore come from there, since he was one of the sanest killer that got kidnapped by the entity the wraith had to be tortured until he finally broke
---
Hence rework.

Well, yeah, because one is a survivor perk.

When you install the ptb it takes an image of your save and transpose it into the ptb. You can level up and use all your items but because its a temporary isolated save once the ptb is gone then your save is back to where it last was prior to the ptb installation.
---
Is that a bug, I always got that so I just thought it was intended
---
**and then** realize that their characters are trash until they run through a couple hundred thousand blood points to get decent perks and addons.
---
Maybe but I think the entity would torture them anyway so that they take their pent up anger out on the survivors. And if they brutally tortured by a entity displeased they would get to have a mori, think of it as a way to murder the entity in that eyes but it's actually a survivor.
---
Wow Nea's into some weird shit
---
It's not that serious. Just play with his friend lol
---
I swear some survivors will complain if the killer doesn't do nice things during the game and complain if they do. I've had a lot of people tell me 'FaRmInG iS bOrInG', so the next time I see them I put on NOED. 
---
Killers who can have a bit of fun are so cute and I'll love them forever. I had a Pig who let me boop the snoot once. It was a good game.
---
Poor Phillip we love you &lt;3
---
So this is the way youre seeing killer abilities. In your Logic every killer is unique then. 
---
And how does legion move? And how does spirit move?

Dont make shit up please.

It's not so much a stealth killer as it is a surprise killer.

If mindbreaker causes survivors to just sit around for 40 seconds dear god that's great

Hello Drake and Josh I'd like you to meet my friends at bhvr they have a business proposition...
---
There's a lot of perks that become useless past a certain point in the game. Hex totems, bitter murmur, corrupt intervention, etc.
---
So if i were to take exactly hillbillys chainsaw but make it apply blindness and dizzyness upon a hit and it doesnt instahit its a unique killer now?
---
I’ve never understood how being teabagged and pointed at as Killer prevents you from playing all aspects of the game. Getting facecamped however means your game has ended and playtime/points in that match are no more.
---
really? you keep getting the same perk until you max it out?
---
Just admit you want that spiky dildo
---
Yeah I agree, I really don't see the point in adding a 5th perk to the Shrine.
---
I would totally okay Claudette more if she had this hair option. Kinda gives me a 80'e vibe.
---
Someone explain how to play nurse because I played nurse like once and I sucked so bad I lost my shit. I couldn't control the blink at all and it was the first time I dced as a killer and I've never done it again. Like that's how bad I was
---
Yeah, it rocks if it’s a perk I like, but it usually isn’t
---
Funnily enough, when I'm running Freddy the survivors usually thank me for not killing them sooner. Same with Pig, who I main. Truly bad players tend to be the toxic ones, and I guess I'm lucky enough not to find many recently.
---
Maybe let that be part of the perk progression. Tokens 3/4/5
---
No?
---
PTB always drops on a Tuesday, so two weeks from the PTB.
---
If ANY SWF group loses, the killer should ALWAYS expect hate messages, that's just how most survivor mains are for some reason. Pretty easy to assume most of them got bullied growing up lol
---
Bonk!
---
Maybe it's just confirmation bias, but I've had a lot of luck stopping and then taking a step or two backwards. Survivors seem to like trying to double back on you and this lets you spot them more easily.
---
Beautiful.
---
I mean hell, Scoops Ahoy is by far the most awaited-for cosmetic. Even if they started in Season 1 or 2 I'm sure they could get some emergency meeting done or something just cuz of all the extra money they would make for having Scoops as a cosmetic.

Cute lil survivor main, you’ll understand eventually.
---
(TL;DR below)
---
Okay so i'm not saying DBD is P2W (I'd say more Pay 4 Convenience imo but definition depends on each person) but comparing one issue in a game to a issue in another game that looks/is worse seems like downplaying it.
---
Yeah sure $8 dollars is a much smaller cost than $300 but when the games are different in design, mechanics, or the what the issue is then comparing them probably isn't the best idea (How exactly do you figure out if a perk or killer is better or worse than a collectable card?)
---
If the potential issue is a certain perk or multiple perks are "P2W" then we need to focus on that issue instead of downplaying it because there's something worse out there.
---
TL;DR: If there is a potential issue in DBD then we shouldn't downplay it by comparing it to something worse, if you like something but find issues with it then having a vocal concern about it is fine (just please be nice about discussing it)
---
Let one live to tell the tale.
---
&gt;Ever see a guy say goodbye to a shoe?
---
Yes, once.
---
That's the only reason I don't want him in the game
---
"base speed" is defined as running speed. since they use percentages running speed is 100% speed, walking is 56.5% speed and most killers move at 115% speed (115% of the running speed of survivors). The walking speed boost changes it to 67.8% of the running speed.
---
Bloodhound Freddy with hemorrhage block has been a meme build I’ve run into a few times. Add sloppy and PGTW and Ruin for added laughs.
---
Here's one- Playing a killer that has an insta down power or exposed status power but camp and tunnel and never use their power.
---
Rip to your karma. It’s so funny reading all these comments posted by killers who rely on noed
---
Got it, thanks!
---
Dwight is based on another BHVR employee who’s name I don’t recall.
---
Before DBD came out, BHVR did a charity auction where employees got to bid on different things for the charity fund. One of the items was to get your face on a character in the next BHVR game, and the guy who won the bid ended up getting his face on Dwight.
---
The difference is that with Adrenaline you get it through doing all the generators. NOED activates when you lose the game.
---
Adrenaline: Earned         NOED: Not earned

There’s definitley a difference between NOED and Adrenaline and I’m kinda tired of people comparing them like they’re the same when they aren’t.

&gt; I think it's going to work like Blindess, where you know you have it but don't know if it's actually affecting you.
---
if you know you have blindness it is affecting you
---
It could be useful in making the killer wiff a swing but that's about it due to it being predictable after you do it once.
---
Not one name right
---
dh is really meh, balanced landing is a much better exhaustion perk. even if youre already exhausted it still has a passive effect that can be very helpful in certain spots

Fell to rank 19. It's taking me 5 + min on PS4 to get a match. Then it disconnects half way through.

Nurse is literally the most broken thing in the game and she’s free.

Mindbreaker and scratched mirror Myers say howdy
---
My only complaint is that Relentless Pursuit encourages bloodlust cheesing chases. Bloodlust is supposed to be a bandaid fix to poor map design, not a means to consistently downing people. 
---
Otherwise, I think it’s a solid idea. Good job!
---
My name is Barry Allen and I'm the Fastest survivor alive
---
Can't wait for all the stranger things kiddies to give killers a bad name by playing demogorgon
---
yes, that's what BHVR said. "if EAC bans you, we can do nothing about it."
---
and do you know what EAC told us? "as long as it doesn't affect gameplay, we won't ban you, but if BHVR chooses to ban you, we can do nothing about it."
---
You enter an exit gate before exiting right
---
MmM yeeeeessssss, lemme get in a sewer drain real quick
---
*Zooweemama*
---
They should buff distortion to 4-5 stacks so it would be worth an entire perk slot.
---
Lmao
---
Pig does she count?
---
Oh god i will olay this game if this happens
---
If you watched it already then nah it kinda branches off on its own for that season so you would be fine for the mostpart unless you forgot about the giant spider dude you do you tho
---
I'm currently rank 6 on Survivor and ended up in a match against a rank 5 Killer... and 3 rank 15+ teammates. I'm not going to lie, I was salty at my teammates for most of that game, until I saw the rank disparity. At which point I wept a little bit on the inside.
---
BHVR wtf
---
I’m gonna be maiming Nancy tho. Second wind is cool and all but I N N E R S T R E N G T H
---
There aren't any real good survivor perks though?  The perks this time weren't very good and they are gonna make killers unbareable.
---
Why is always there a bloodlust perk
---

Rework is beter, but he was fun

I'm fairly critical of this DLC and I'm still buying it too.  I love this game, even though it hates me. lol

I love your username!

people are already begging for them to be nerfed. insane. hopefully bhvr ignores them

They didn’t say. Only showed that and said it is to catch up with survivors

MoM was genuinely broken, unlike these perks

You have just been awarded the *Best DBD X Stranger Things meme of the Day* award.

Congratulations!

Oh cool thanks for telling me
---
When it’s rank reset I generally try to be as fair as possible. It’s pretty easy to tell if’s someone that’s new vs someone that just isn’t good at the game.
---
Wraith got buffed so hard that its like a new character, its not the wraith I used to know but im sure it is *the best*

teammates who run Sprint Burst are garbage so thank fuck if it stops some of them

Ohh I see what you mean now

There’s gonna be PTB soon so we will be able to find out.

Did you mean to reply to me? Spine chill doesnt deactivate. Mettle of Man and DS deactivate. Deactivated perks can not be used again.

[Thanks! ](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/clownopedia/images/c/c5/Clown_%28Spongebob_Squarepants%29.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140829024416)
---
 A deactivated perk can not be used again. Its like DS and Mettle of Man.
---
Dead Hard is good because of its **versatility**. I dont really understand why this is so hard for players to grasp. 
---
Oh hey, you're injured? While heres an out that might help you survive. Need to escape the basement? Ok cool. Lets see Lithe help with that. Close to escaping but the exit is just out of reach? Dead Hard has your back. 
---
To all the selfish care users that insist being injured ia the end of the world; Instead of wasting 32 sec healing every time you get hit, maybe try running a perk that makes you not completely helpless when the killer finds you injured?
---
This would be awesome!
---
Yup.
---
The most satisfying part of the game is killing toxic players.
---
Hell no.
---
Can't protect totems, can't get Gen grabs, can't redown someone that pops adren, can't hit someone immediately (especially if they make a mistake and run at you), can't protect against insta saves or protect hooks in general, can't block pallets during the transition like Wraith or anyone else, can't defend gates, can't stop the Gen rush in his face. 
---
Has to walk his simple ass across the map like a chode, has no chase potential...
---
He had a cool ability, and some neat features to his kit, but it was all downsides with no upsides. New Freddy has a lot going on, and he didn't lose all of the cool stuff.
---
*selfish care*
---
Was that on purpose? Lol
---
Whilst I'm search for 5 totems, spaced around a massive map, my team is being killed.
---
That is a fair point, but saying dead by daylight is pay to win is wrong. Espcally if you consder both Billy and Nurse are free, two of which are the best killers, and you can get most of the good persk from the base killers with little issue.
---
Yes.
---
Me too!
---
There's no reward for you directly though. Any benefits of this perk are given to another survivor and you reveal your location to the killer. BT still seems better in that it ensures the saved teammate can still get away if the killer is near and you are still able to try intercepting the killer yourself without the need of aura reading.
---
As shown in the picture, MYC will literally make this perk horrible to run, then you have other perks like Furtive Chase to indicate who your new obsession is very easily if they have Babysitter so you can play accordingly around that as killer, as well as just giving the killer a target to go after without needing to worry about BT or DS.
---
I like the idea of it, and it can be used similar to OoO to lure the killer to you if you're confident in your looping abilities, but you might as well run OoO for that.Idk I guess we have to see it in play first, but if only it gave you as the unhooker some sort of benefit aside from the mutual knowledge of you and the killer seeing each other.
---
It’s not effective. Anyone telling you otherwise forgets that once you’ve used it one time that match, or you give signs that you’re about to use it then it becomes useless and killers just bait it out. Not to mention how many times it is inconsistent and doesn’t work or leaves you exhausted on the floor. 
---
However sprint burst and lithe and Balanced Landing are MUCH more useful as they can’t just “Not work” when you activate it like dead hard does constantly at least on console. Plus it’s pretty obvious when someone has dead hard once you’ve been playing for a while at worst you test survivors by waiting a second or two more than normal before swinging.
---
Theses posts are posted way to often. They are a waste of time to make since the people who do this are not going to read this post then go "Oh I guess since reddit said so I will stop" also just because you think this, doesn't mean everyone has to play the game like that.
---
Or a killer with no survivor. Like ghostface..
---
Gotta remember that one, when my friends think it's the greatest perk in the game.
---
Bleen
---
I thought the game had gone free to play, guess not....
---
&gt; Not toxic, just unfair and unreasonable to the solo survivors who have no way to communicate.
---
SWF is not unfair to solo. This is silly. The game is not complicated. You do not need comms as solo
---
They really do home in on dailies. Though to be fair I get it on survivor two. Need to break two hooks? Prepare to get found first, tunneled, and promptly moried after being chased across the map.
---
I mean that would be nice too but still. They did mention about changing up the formula a bit
---
I don’t get it
---
But the purpose for Dead Hard isn't meant for it being in long chases I thought. It was meant more for close calls when trying to reach an important vault or pallet.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
As the lone user of Iron Maiden, it's just a scream.
---
Don't dig too deep into the bloodwebs for it just yet.
---
You can give it a go, and hope it eventually pops up, but after the next patch drops it will be a LOT easier, due to the bloodweb changes, where at level 60 it will offer you 4 perks instead of the 2,and you can buy up to 2 for sure.
---

---
You can tell who are the solo survs and who regularly plays in a SWF in here. Anyone saying the new surv perks are lack lustre are either high rank or never play solo. A lot of these new survivor perks fix problems players are having that are inherently solved by playing in a SWF. Im glad BHVR is looking out for the little guy!
---
If anything Nacys healing perk will make ruin less used since everyone will clense totems even more
---
It’s actually just a foreign exchange student program where the Entity traded Freddy temporarily. Now Freddy’s all buffed up from his training montage and a new kid has joined the class.
---
Killers are harder to create than survivors because of the power
---
Huh, guess I remembered it wrong, thanks
---
I doubt it because the perk is dependent on your finishing a chase fast and close to a generators being worked on, where as ruin is a passive effect until they find and destroy it.
---
Well then they should change it back so the DS, HO, IS combo isn't too strong
---
i feel like pennywises power would be name" every 27 years" and i feel like it would be a power similar to michael where he tiers up except every does something entirely from the last because pennywise practically has every power that a super hero has. also he collects fear like michael  excpet instead of stalking he uses shapeshifting to gather fear
---
To be fair Self Care Gamers waste a hell of a lot more than 32 secs on that heal.  You forgot the mandatory 20 seconds they use going to the corner of the map to start it.
---
Happens everytime. Heck dude even yesterday I had to play hag and slap people after they activated my trap (card), and this dude got super salty and was like "imagine using hag, and imagine using her for ruin" and it was just excessive. Very obnoxious
---
Yeah I know. But still, would be lovely to see two that have a connected backstory
---
Diversion does the same. You get pebbles for staying in the TR
---
Nice 👍🤘🤘😆
---
its probably a glitch
---
Oof, so true.
---
This is so irritating to hear, because you don’t even get a lot of bloodpoints from this. There’s literally NO REASON.
---
Quality
---
Sprint Burst wastes so much time walking to conserve it though.  For that reason it's out for me.  I feel like a Claudette walking everywhere when I run it.
---
Im not saying to hyper focus the damn totems. Im saying keep that as your quest and help your team while you are doing it. Multi-tasking should be pretty damn simple. Do a gen, break some totems, help a teammate, lose the killer, escape. Its not rocket science.
---
But why are you here....
---
Downvoted for the truth lel.
---
Personally, I run Monitor and Abuse, Dark Devotion, Save the Best for Last, and Thrilling Tremors. Excellent stealth build, with decent tracking and even if you hit the obsession by accident (and cancel out STBFL) You get a zero terror radius!
---
the only thing dead hard is truly useful for is getting to pallets or windows when your too close to the killer
---
Just saying
---
I'm going to take a stab at this. 
---
First time you lost a toolbox with hacksaw.  From what it sounds like you used up the item.  Using up items, or death, counts as losing the item.  There is nothing to save the item when it's used up.  You lose both item and add-ons.  If you die, but have a white ward offering, you don't lose anything.
---
Second time it says you gained a tool box.  This means you must have used up your previous toolbox plus the hacksaw, and then gained another item in the map.  I'm guessing it was of the same color at the vary least, which is why you didn't really notice.
---
Third time you lost only one add-on.  In actuality you lost both.  What happened, I think, is this
---
You kept your med kit but not the add ons.  The reason why it shows gel dressings is because you had multiples in your inventory.  However the other add-on you only had one of, so nothing reappeared in that slot.  You need to get more from the bloodweb.
---
what you described isn't tension. It was, if the survivors are close to escaping, I should be able to kill them a lot more easily and punish them for trying to help each other.
---
Even if it does work it double dips and surveillance is still very weak I believe it's 16 seconds of not working.
---
Surge alone won't beat ruin it's too gimmicky while ruin alone is at least equal to surge+surv
---
In my opinion surge will be roughly weasels power but potentially worse
---
Then again on certain maps it could be strong like the game doctor
---
In conclusion is rate it niche
---
But when it’s most important it becomes useless essentially. You can make it another pallet or window with DH OR use Balanced Landing/Sprint Burst/Lithe to flat out LOSE the killer. Or even better yet make it to a whole different loop, break line of sight, make it to a save you wouldn’t of normally been able to reach and giving you more time to sit on gens before they struggle/die, make the killer whiff or entirely give up on you because you made too much distance. 
---
There’s just SO many more situations Sprint burst and the other exhaustion perks are more helpful.
---
You're welcome fam.
---
Oh yeah STBFL could really work well! Interesting
---
Why would they teleport farther away when the perk tiers up?
---
I run everywhere and then just get back my sprint burst while on a gen.
---
I mean the synergy is cool but Furtive Chase, Remember Me, and Racor aren't very good perks and Make your Choice is arguably not necessary on GhostFace.
---
Yeah it's boring but a more standard build like Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring will do you a lot more good. 
---
With your build the only perk you're really seeing benefits from is Make your Choice which is pointless on GhostFace with how easily you can mark people. Your build preps you for remember me which was niche even before the nerf and is not very good anymore so it's a bit of a waste of the other 3 perks.
---
F to pay respects lads
---
Wow, you literally just reuploaded the dev stream from yesterday.  
---
Very cool and legal Kanye.
---
This is just how the killers like to start the game.
---
Stun or not, that's a lot of pallets gone. Especially the God pallet.
---
Yea stay in rank 20-17 cause that won't happen in purple ranks unless someone has a vendetta against another survivor.
---
Well we already have Mcote vest Dwight, just not the new Mcote suspenders Dwight, comon BHVR we gotta collect them all!
---
Had a SWF call me a neckbeard when I killed two of them as Clown (they burned an Ormond offering). Claudette d/c'd when I wouldn't open the locker to eat her DS. She was on death hook anyway. They didn't like my exhaustion add ons. Remember, survivors can be on comms and have instaheals, but if you take away their Dead Hard, you're a....neckbeard. Never seen people so mad over a 2k.
---
ITS NOT A CULT DAMMIT
---
it was exactly this way.
---
I do agree to an extent, but not only does this make it very difficult for the new survivor, it also makes it much easier for the high-ranked killer. Since the killer is (more often then not) playing a strong character with strong addons/perks, they are almost in a 3v1 and the new survivor may be more of a handicap than a help. Not that it should be this way, but it seems no matter what, it will be unfair for someone.
---
What about it are you critical of?
---
i would agree with this without addons i think he sucks, his shock range without addons makes it really hard to use
---
&gt;gains token from competing generator
---
&gt;instantly loses token from bitter murmur
---
Hahaha fuck no. It's shit.
---
Noed is totally fine, and also just got an indirect nerf due to inner strength existing sooo
---
Yes Madame Piggy! Love the art style man!
---
That's if Nancy beats out self care there's only so many totems
---
I don't think it will out do self care which is incredibly reliable
---
The problem with the totem perk is that you can be put onto a totally naked side of the map and end up not having squat to deal with
---
Where as self care works no matter what and doesn't require you to take risky actions like running around the map and potentially finding the killer
---
However I guess it's a soft counter to nurses calling but then again just don't heal in terror radiuses
---
Okay, interesting. I kind of got bored of the meta to begin with though, which is why I went to some less used perks. I've been having a lot of luck
---
About damn time
---
Not even remotely similar 
---
Confinement is *much* more situational. It has 5 uses max and its range is only around the completed generator 
---
It sounds remarkably unhelpful if anything
---
ok then, I'll describe it differently. 
---
I want the feeling of I HAVE TO LEAVE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, FUCK OTHERS, I HAVE TO SAVE MYSELF!
---
yup.
---
&gt; The only broken perk being added is inner strength. Imo they should remove the closet all together. After all the ate old saying goes you can run but your cant hide.
---
Trying to figure out what's more braindead: op's post or yours
---
Just explaining
---
How about when you unhook someone Pinheads chain hooks come up from the ground locking you in place for a period of time. Could be like trappers traps where you can unhook yourself too. Slippery meat would help here
---
awesome! thanks :) i was worried i wouldn’t be able to get iron will on claudette after getting the teachable because she’s p3 level 50
---
Its buggy; guaranteed points to the perk are safe unhooks and saving from traps; and usually taking a hit near a survivor that is hooked. 
---
Your supposed to get it if you take a hit for an injured survivor but it’s dumb and buggy
---
Hm
---
It’s not a failure of game design, it’s an adaptation of playstyle.
---
The addons exist to facilitate multiple play styles. You choose the way you want to play, and therefore, have fun the way you want. However, don’t complain that the way you chose to have fun isn’t the most efficient way to get points.
---
The way you can use this exact same build while still getting points is by stalking as normal, going for hits and hooks as normal, prolonging the game by protecting the gens, and generally you’ll finish soaking to tier 3 close to end game. Usually around 1 generator left, or even after.
---
Then you grab people and Mori them. Game ends, you get brutal or merciless depending on if you hooked everyone twice, you get your pip, and you got to play with the addons the way you wanted.
---
The game design didn’t fail, you just played it however you wanted, it’s not gonna hold your hand and tell you how to beat use the addons.
---
It’d be like playing Billy and never swinging your weapon just because you have chainsaw addons.
---
psst they're obviously being sarcastic
---
That's why he has such a stoned cold face
---
Aight I understand the enthusiasm, and discussion threads are super cool
---
But
---
THIS EXACT POST IS MADE SEVEN TIMES EVERY SINGLE DAY
---
well at least there is more outdoor maps than indoor
---
It's a good trick the first time, it might buy you that window or that pallet but after that?  I always remember which survivors have dead hard after they use it on me the first time.  All you have to do to bait is ride right up their ass in the second chase and wait until they do their invincibility dab, then you pop them.  
---
Balanced Landing is sort of the best exhaustion perk, but I don't use any of them anymore myself.
---
tnx
---
AAAAAA OKAY ITS A RELIGION JUST PUT THE LOCKER DOWN JESUS CHRIST MAN.
---
Now these are the surprise mechanics we need in gaming
---
Why would it have gone f2p and what gave you that idea...
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cugfxh/the_mad_grit_exploit_is_still_a_thing/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I didn't say it would out do self care, it will just make people do totems more often which means ruin is more likely to get destryoed even faster
---
Self care is objectively better in most situations
---
1. You control where the healing is
---
2. You're not in a locker.
---
3. Infinite uses
---
4. It's always to be to able to be used
---
Downsides
---
Nurses calling and sloppy butcher
---
Nurses calling is easy to out play if you know they have it
---
Sloppy butcher is just a few extra seconds and not quite meta so you won't find it too much
---
This new perk will let u fight against said downsides while losing self cares greater buffs
---
In short you don't want to find the last totem in order to heal up when you could quickly self care and do gens
---
i mean david already has we're gonna farm forever. i dont think he should have two/both farming perks.
---
It’s not good for learning loops; you can get reliant on it if you start with it, but that honestly applies to all exhaustion perks. I would say use sprint burst until you can get a feel for the base timeframe you can safely loop on different tiles, then use DH. 
---
I personally like balanced landing the best for its passive ability too
---
That's if it's even run.
---
This mans got sent to the shadow realm shit
---
Killers have two. Why should survivors only get one?
---
Its def not replacing ruins. But i think running both ruins and that could make sense.
---
The big advantage of surge over weasel is you don't need to find a gen to kick, it just works passively in the background.
---
that is not a bug. the teachable is gonna show up until you grab it
---
Idk, some others have said it looks like the demogorgon has stealth when it uses it's portals
---
Freddy Porker
---
Just slowing the game down a little bit
---
Have you watched the video?
---
Like what the fuck?
---
in other words, you want the killer to have easier kills, I know what you're trying to describe and it's dumb and you just want it tipped MASSIVELY into the killers favour just because.
---
You can still do good without buying a single killer or survivor for their perk, or even using they're perks, it's just a matter of convenience. So please......shut the fuck up :)
---
Maybe Predator?
---
i’m saying you can’t counter barbecue w/ a locker bc when u come out you’ll reveal ur location anyways
---
&gt;The point is playing DBD for its full value (having all perks all killers etc) cost around 8$ every new release, so roughly 8$ per season, which is something everyone should be able to afford with no issue.
---
Well if we're going for full value then it gets kind of gray due to cosmetics as how some people feel like looking a certain way in a video game is impactful for them.
---
Also some people still may have financial issue with $8 dollars but I see your point.
---
&gt;Doing the same thing in HS cost 300$ per season, which imo isn't very reasonnable for a video game, which is why i stopped playing it.
---
&gt;Its not about comparing whats better or worse, a card or a killer. The point is i get access to everything in DBD for wayyyy cheaper than in HS.
---
I understand as I also quit due to that however DBD and Hearthstone are still two completely different games which affects what exactly is considered "P2W" or how much something should cost in each respective game and comparing them seems somewhat irrelevant.
---
&gt;But in my opinion the price they are charging us is very reasonable. They do need money to keep paying their artists, programmers, pay for the rights, publicity, etc.
---
I agree with your opinion that $8 per major dlc is reasonable and that they are still a business who does need money but I can also see why others think that DBD should just go Free 2 Play due to all the microtransactions they have that Free 2 Pay games like to include. I feel that the devs aren't doing their best and need to focus a little more on fixing and polishing the game but they do care about their fans more than just seeing them as a source of income.
---
at the same time the other perks showing up in your bloodweb is completly random so its no bug
---
It's not about doing fine or not fine. SWF should be an entirely different game than solo. Killers should be able to choose which they want to play and SWF should be allowed to play with less than 4 and solo should always have the 4. Solo people can't speak to each other and that's how the game is meant to be played.
---
So they get exposed to BBQ? Great survivors indeed
---
I thought the whole purpose of DbD was that the people died in the real world. Like every Killer and Survivor has died at least once (looking at you Laurie) in their worlds in order to come to the realm of DbD
---
I agree, Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury, Enduring looks a lot better than OP's build.
---
i’m still laughing ab this
---
Sure but are you really going to run calm spirit? It’s a perk that counters one perk and one killer and if they’re not running Iron Maiden or playing doc *congratulations* you just wasted a perk slot on something that won’t help you.
---
It has 5 uses max. 
---
 It's kind of weak, and will not be nerfed no matter how hard you try to make it OP. It will never be too strong, even in swf, because medkits and we'll make it are better. 
---
And if someone likes to cleanse totems (trust me, you can't convince everyone to allow a possible NOED just for your silly healing perk designed for Dwight) you will get fewer uses. Maybe 0. Like plunderers, it relies on your team leaving things for you, which is not likely. 
---
The players running this will be hard pressed to make it work more than 1 or 2 times a match, and it requires them to be looking for a bone, and then doing nothing in a locker for a total of 10 seconds or 9 with noise notifications.
---
It's a shit perk, for memes. 👍
---
As a killer you don't choose where chases end up only where they start most people tend to run away from heavily sounding gens as a good practice the problem with this perk is you don't get a choice the chances are the survivors will be doing gens far from you or at least out of range still this perk gives itself away so hard that once someone sees it once they'll know to counter play it
---
Imagine chasing someone and then getting thwacked in the back of the head by a rock
---
How about you remove behave friendlier. All of your insults dont even make sense. 
---
Why should my mom wipe my ass becaue i think that spirit and legion have similarities?
---
Yeah, in my experience, safe unhooks are still the biggest guarantee. Protection hits near injured survivors are finicky and you have to be really close to them for it to count as a token. I feel like it needs to be an 8m radius or something. Instead, you guys basically have to be on top of each other which runs the risk of sandbagging them instead of protecting them.
---
What do you mean?
---
Honestly, BHVR doing a non human killer for the first time unlocked so many opportunities.
---
Imagine mega immersed people
---
yeah i guess it would be OP especially if paired with MYC
---
That killer was salty hahaha
---
I understood *that* reference
---
This is why I can never wear my legacy Dwott...people would make funna me.
---
Reminds me of the big weapon bug in F13
---
when u can’t get any kills but it’s fine bc you rely on your noed
---
Your dad
---
I want to clap Claudettes cheeks
---
I can’t argue against Balanced Landing but a lot of times you won’t need to run. What I normally do is walk if I’m in terror radius or I’ve just finished a gen or if the killer lost me to a gen. I lose maybe 3 seconds usually compared to running? Or I 99% my exhaustion to loop a killer and use a surprise sprint burst mid chase to save my ass or waste more time. I’ve used all of them before and found Dead Hard to be the least consistently worth bringing because of so many red rank killers knowing how to counter it and because of how readily available exhaustion addons are for killers and having a perk that you need to be injured to work it’s really bad to last minute realize they’re running an exhaustion add on and you misjudged how safe you actually were. On PS4 half the time Dead Hard does NOTHING. If they had dedicated servers dead hard would be better in niche situations. But right now it’s to unreliable.
---
sorry, I'm quoting one of the team members that was recently on the 8-4 podcast.
---
Won't be many of those, mostly shittalkers
---
If someone can do something you can't in the same game, that's what unfair would be.
---
Lol it has happened to us in one too many games lately
---
I'm hoping it will be worth having. As it is, it's looking like a purely map transit power with no way to close loops. He may end up being an easily bullied character like the wraith
---
Actually, diversion should be buffed to work similar to firecrackers as an addiction to what they do now.
---
Yeah took them an entire year to change DS and bring out EGC, so yeah its always a long ass wait on previous killers,always too focused on the 3 month new chapter cycle
---
I support this 100%
---
I like a good chase build on her.
---
Brutal strength, enduring, and save the best for last save a lot of time. Bbq is good, but if you don't need the points, I'm all ears is strong on any killer.
---
Eh we have a portion of an inter-dimensional hive mind as a new killer so IT could be on the table one day.
---
Only if it's pre season 6
---
Truth.
---
What people consider P2W differs so even though you say it's not doesn't change how others may see it but I agree DBD isn't directly you fork over cash and instant win your matches.
---
Yes Nurse is still the best due to the fact she ignores almost everything if you practice enough but Spirit is probably just slightly better than Billy due to she can mindgame you better at a pallet.
---
Perks although I can see how may be seen as P2W (precisely Pay 4 Convenience) using BBQ&amp;Chili as an example and how it's a pretty good perk that helps with the endless grind and that it has only been on the Shrine twice since it's release and that you either have to wait for it to hopefully ever come back again or spend $4 for Leatherface just so you can guarantee you unlock it as you will eventually get him to Level 35 to skip the process of waiting a undetermined amount of time.
---
That's so boring though. I can always run the others on another person. Ghostface is perfect for this because i can sneak right up on the rescuer without them knowing. Plus it'll be great against Steve's!
---
I doubt it'll be a strong killer. My guess is another mid-tier killer par the course.
---
I timed the killer's "charge" when it teleports - 6-7 seconds to come out of teleport. Utterly ridiculous. And who wants to bet that there will be some sort of visual warning given to the survivors who are trying to destroy his traps that the killer is coming? The pounce could be ok, but I don't like that it can only be done in a straight line. 
---
As for his perks - all of them are survivor-dependent and thus are easily countable and aren't good. 
---
Surge depends on where the survivor leads you in a chase, and if they lead you to a place where there are no gens or worse - completed gens, well.. your perk does jack squat when you down them. And it has a lengthy timer par the course for BHVR.
---
Cruel Confinement - also survivor-dependent. Why am I seeing a pattern here? Why should a killer perk depend on what a survivor does rather than what a killer can do? Where they complete a gen is only where you can use your perk, and if you aren't near the area where they completed said gen and they haven't stayed in the area to wait for you - your perk is useless. And the timer for it is short of course. Garbage perk.
---
Mindbreaker - Could have been nice but it only works on survivors who are repairing gens under 50% - why is this limited to only under 50%? So damn situational. It should be any %, not 50% and under. Unless it that percentage is raised this too is not a good perk.
---
But solo players 100 percent have the ability to find people to play SWF with. Nothing is being withheld from them
---
and even if you were right (you aren't), it's hard to care if it doesn't even impact the game
---
Jokes on them, only find them faster. Also, they could add a selective mute feature in the pause screen, in case someone is extra cringe.
---
I get shit-talked enough after the game, I don't want to deal with the toxic prestige claudette yelling russian obscenities at me while clicking her flashlight at a pallet.
---
Now that I'm looking at it, it looks like that plant from that event
---
Don't get me wrong, i still love daddy myers

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cugpda/steve_is_getting_his_scoops_outfit/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;

Self care still has far more upsides.

It lets you decide your healing location.
---
It works anywhere

It's not limited to consumable totems

Good luck finding some totems without a map
---
I could go on but it's only going to be a thing for a few weeks before it's going to be like weasel is to ruin
---
So glad this is happening
---
because it's another sprint burst.  Hope makes you run faster at the end of the match.
---
I feel that

I keep getting Thompson House whenever I play as Pig and every time it’s like https://i.imgur.com/BmShJGl.jpg
---
She’s too short to see through the corn :(
---
Welp I’m buying this as soon as I get the dlc
---
Suicide rates drop to 0% :,)
---
Imagine their difficulty scales by rank. At red you are going against a level 3 bot from for Honor. The bot would hook you HIMSELF.
---
I honestly doubt bad players will stray from the meta at all for only a .25x bones, lol. At least not during regular matches. They'd lose immediately with it and say, "fuck that, never again" and run back to their ds, dead hard, self care, adrenaline build just like they do with every other perk
---
it’s porn
---
So only play Nurse
---
Steve mains rejoice!

[You lost this time.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cugozw/scoops_outfit/)

Just like that half of the fanbase goes broke.
---
Except those people are probably nancy and they'll have Fixated, so I think it'll still be hard to find them if you're too far away.
---
This with the P3 head.
---
Yaaaas queen. It'll likely be the most purchased skin in the game like overnight
---
couldn't figure out how to upload the clip from Netflix's Twitter so I just took a pic
---
Ugh, these kind words of “fact memes” are incredibly lazy and dull, hopefully the sub bans them.
---
It's funny because the actor who plays shaggy is also the one of two that is the original ghostface
---
Dammit lol
---
This is a good way to work against SwF cheese. Which, believe me, I’m fully behind.
---
100%
---
For real, if someone throws a rock at your face you are probably gonna drop your hostage.
---
I am now a survivor main
---
I actually like this idea.
---
Lol!  I absolutely cannot argue about the PS4 comment.  I play on PS4 and it definitely does flat out fail at times.   And while I agree good killers can counterplay it in many situations typically in the open away from loops scenarios, it still for me just comes in very clutch when it comes to making the pallet or window I wouldn't have otherwise to extend the chase.  That and it can come in clutch end game heading towards that exit gate, over trappers traps, different little situations where it does something for you the others couldn't in those situations.  
---
Exhaustion perks are all viable options though.  Largely comes to personal playstyle preference.  Each has its merit.
---
Shirtless clown when?
---
Why aren't you using Bond and Prove Thyself?  Those are dwight's two best perks and are both better suited to an objective based build.
---
Havent seen a plague in awhile
---
I can already imagine the lobbies. Just 4 Steves with the scoops ahoy outfit.
---
Be funny if they were killers
---
Yes!! Is this a confirmed cosmetic? 😍
---
Groot.
---
You sound like a fucking dweeb, dude.
---
Except Michael, the Entity fears him because he is just that evil.
---
It’s either Clown or the Plague.
---
dark devotion is not going to do anything to second wind
---
Yaaas
---
Yea true. Guess I wouldn't mind it but I like no mither having no incentive for some reason.
---
apology for poor english
---
when were you when scoop outfit announcement?
---
i was sat at work doing job when mcote ring
---
‘Steve have scoops’
---
‘Yes’
---
There's a good bit tied up in BBs journal entries. Lots of interesting tidbits.
---
this would at the same time mean no standing still for 20 seconds to open the gate and stuff like that. I want shit to be speeded up for both sides
---
Gimme Clown with a Scoops Ahoy! outfit.
---
Specifically, Steve's outfit.  It'll look like a crop top on him.
---
Nice b8
---
By walking backwards, I have erased your escape route and leapt past it. You've been hit by, you've been stuck by the power of my stand 「SMOOTH CRIMINAL」
---
For a sec i tought you could use 5 perks on mobile
---
What do you mean
---
People need to stop making they own concepts for real
---
considering wraith can cheese away from Borrowed, that's totally fair
---
I dont have enough MONEY!!!!!!!!
---
Imagine not watching stranger things so you only understand half of this meme haha am I right guys
---
im confident Resident evil and Alien are not gonna come into DBD for sure. The rest is a big question mark
---
I never understood why people do that... I usually play survivor with 2 of my friends, and our main priority every single time is to save our random teammate. Even if all 3 of us die for the random, we call it worth.
---
Dev already said no new modes they don't want to split the player base. Wait times get bad as is.
---
A new mode would kill potentially die on arrival or the old mode would.
---
Like i said an option to opt out would be all od need.
---
This game was designed originally with no mic play in mind
---
They said it’s based on season 3 Steve and Nancy.  Netflix gave them ideas for cosmetics.  I don’t know what other cosmetics there would be for Steve honestly
---
How do you mindgame a Spirit anyway?  
---
I have been playing her for quite some time and I have no idea.
---
You didint find an exception. Freddy in lore is basically omnipotent in the dream world, he can and has manipulated Dreams into all manners of insane things. He made a tv eat someone.
---
Freddy using blood to teleport is by far one of the most mundane things he could possible do. 
---
The Demogorgan on the other hand is a very grounded character that has been clearly shown to be limited to certain things.
---
Hahaha I know you’re being serious but I pop’d at the simple ass chode part. Well said.
---
oooh I gotcha now.
---
Play a few games of her and you'll understand her weaknesses and how she works.. I personally hated playing against her, and since I know how she works cause I played her a bunch, she's probably my favorite killer to play against at the moment.
---
I have never been happier in my entier life
---
Hooked Pun intended? haha. Ya I didn’t stop playing the game but I did stop playing Freddy.
---
Like I said, a good way to fight SwF, not a guaranteed way.
---
I'm guessing someone just died to a NOED recently.
---
SCOOPS
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. This DLC is the most hype i've ever been in this game, thank you SO much BHVR.
---
You gotta love when a new player thinks they’re looping you as ghostface then they start teabagging when you’re stalking them. 2 minutes later they DC.
---
I never said it didn't, but let's say you're you're late in the game. Healing for the gates is very crucial. If you can't manage it you might be body blocked out of the gate. How many heals are you going to need a game? How many totems are going to be done by your teamates? Is someone else running the perk and screwing you over? Is there a 3 man cleansing for noed? When you want to pip or win consistently you're going to run self care. 4 people with this perk is a nightmare. It's not reliable enough to be meta. 
---
I still don't think it's always faster, it's a toss up, I will say if you spawn in next to a totem you're golden. However, realiability is king.
---
Meme lost all credibility soon as it said "Has interesting perks" :fail
---
I just have to keep working on understanding new Fred.
---
Gratz friendo, so sorry for what happens on the 13th :(
---
You should play more killer to get a real glimpse of the hook situation. In some maps there are too many hooks, in others too few. If they mess with wiggle speed you won't be able to hook people in half the maps. 
---
Say you have someone hooked and you down a survivor right next to it, in some maps there will be a hook right next to it but in others, you'll easily count 7 to 9 grunts (they wiggle off on the 10th) before you are able to hook them. If someone body blocked that would be an easy grasp escape. 
---
I remember the day I played on The Game map and there were ZERO hooks in the lower level.
---
"There's no rule that you can't equip the same perk multiple times!"
---
BHVR: "Actually, you shouldn't be able to."
---
"Shut up, it's **P E B B L E  T I M E**."
---
It really should give some Altruism bp bonus, in all honesty.
---
The most important thing is to learn when to give up chases. If you spend a lot of time in one chase, and you realise that the survivor is running towards another incredibly strong map-tile, it's usually just smarter to leave it and search for others who are in a worse part of the map with weaker tiles.
---
Thanks! I’m not sure what you mean???
---
Took the words right outta my mouth
---
Ahoy gamers
---
I didn’t lag at all. And the people I played against last game said the game ran smooth
---
Quentin obviously
---
Nooooormieeee
---
A few months back, there was a stream where they showed an early alpha build of the game for throwback purposes. McCote showed early Dwight, which looks nothing like the Dwight that was released, and mentioned that this version of Dwight was originally based on a BHVR employee who's no longer with them. but that version of Dwight is gone.
---
Rank resets.
---
Too hard. I only gen tap on tier 3 ruin though.
---
Agree to disagree.
---
I will say it could bring the line between a solo player and swf.
---
Just give an option menu for those of us that don't want to hear or be heard. Long as its optional I could care less.
---
Boobs
---
Feng is a cutie
---
I got the game for free with Xbox game pass. Only for a limited time a couple months ago.
---
I cleanse every dull i see and i easily see 2-3 per match. If everyone had that mentality then NOED wouldn't exist.
---
You have the option to remove it and you don't even attempt to take it, so you lose any ground you have when you try to complain about it.
---
How do you know this is official? Link? This is literally just a v.reddit video.
---
On PS4? It feels like no time at all really. I was playing as a killer had one broken went back after hooking the saboteur and the hook was back.
---
You don’t think they would perm ban me or anything all I want is my account reset I would even take a temp ban
---
incorrect, both parties said that they won't stop the developers from adding additional content to the game, both Cunningham and Miller. Gun Media just stop updating for no reason aside from saying that the lawsuit won't let them, even though the people involved in the lawsuit said it's fine.
---
Pathetic....
---
I'm around rank 7 and honestly it still consistently happens. One person gets face camped, and while I'm doing gens my entire team runs in like apes
---
FUCK YEAH
---
*Facepalm*
---
No shit? Of course you need to hide in a locker when it’s time to hatch hunt. When was I ever talking about hatch hunting though? That’s another topic. I’m talking about...you know....before it ever has to reach that point.
---
A good survivor(s) wouldn’t really have to worry about hiding in a locker when they are about to be the last alive because good survivors wouldn’t allow the game to reach that point.
---
A bad survivor concedes early and throws their teammates under the bus by waiting for them to die to start hatch hunting. What kind of survivor are you?
---
Oh ye DUH I completely forgot 😂 well I know now that I am good enough to make it to green so I’ll just keep pushing each time to get back
---
Oh yes please
---
Long as we get a cool killer out of it too.
---
Holy shit, I'm at a loss of words. Can this chapter get any better?
---
Thats true, but it can be faster and easier it just depends alot
---
official page posted on twitter, here's the link: https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1164946135150190593?s=19
---
Its not a direct benefit but it does increase the chance of safe unhook points.
---
You have to think about it from a new player's perspective, though. Demogorgon's perks are really good when you're going to be playing in rank 20 and everyone is actually a potato.
---
CEEEELEBRATE GOOD SKINS, COME ON
---
I guess so.
---
what gameplay problems are being bandaided here? Specifically in context of the parent comment
---
Legion, I like his power, his skins, and for some reason I have way more success with the backpedaling jukes on him, probably because he's shorter than most killers.
---
Also, unless you AFK and do nothing all game, it's basically impossible to downpip with him.. You stab people so much with your frenzy, you'll get way more bloodpoints (and rankpoints?) with him than any other killer.
---
Oh fuck i never actually thought about that. Now that you can essentially get a free full heal per totem cleansed i'd be interested to see how much NOED actually procks now.
---
Nice, they finally git his nancy then..
---
Thanks!
---
It was just announced on the official DBD Twitter page.
---
PS+ gives you a set of free games every month to keep permanently as long as you have PS+.
---
Wraith
---
You ready to admit you were wrong :)
---
Every survivor can run decisive strike and use it once per game, the way the dude I was responding to worded it like only 1 survivor got to use the work once. So if 5 survivors ran the perk only 1 would get the use off rather than 5 getting 1 use. That or they just didn’t understand my wording.
---
YASSSS
---
we didn't do shit tho, this skin must have been ready months/weeks ago
---
Yeah but the key difference is that people wait until the arguement against NOED is made. You very rarely see Threads about Adrenaline being started.
---
My current theory is that the portal squishes/moves/glows or something as an indicator that the Demogorgon is about to crawl out and an add on will make it so that there’s no warning. My other idea was an add on that gave the Demogorgon the new “Undetectable” Status effect for a certain time after exiting a portal so you can use them to spook people off of gens
---
If this is the let me in thing I swear to God...
---
We need this feature! For... reasons. Being able to change outfits at least once inside a locker.
---
God damnit
---
except.... hes not really? Hag sets 10 traps that have to be triggered by survivor which she can then teleport to the trap.
---
Demo digs a system of tunnels which he move between. Probably has fewer charges to boot. They are also relatively obvious compared to Hag traps and can be destroyed easily by survivors.
---
Hes as much the Hag as he is Freddy.
---
Well yeah but it would honestly be better if the killer went after the unhooked person if he got unhooked at 1st stage and you are on 3rd stage
---
no, it's you and all the other baby players
---
I was literally thinking the same thing actually, but then I thought of ALL the things they could do with a Xeno.
---
Tail attacks
---
Acid spit
---
Wall climbing
---
Some sort of Face-Hugger system?
---
It could go any direction really
---
In that case thats perfectly fine
---
Also adorable you're 5 year old enjoys the game
---
Some people take it way too seriously and personally in a video game. It’s not just SWF
---
I think it has more to do with the Sloppy Butcher meta and for solo players
---
HELL YEAH! Definitely getting this day one. Super excited for this chapter.
---
Short term gen tapping is a good idea if you fail most your great skill checks. But long term i recommend trying to hit them so you actually improve at it.
---
YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAH
---
There are no more good excuses, by oh dear there will still be excuses
---
I didn’t mean it in that way i just like that you took your time to explain it really clearly and more dbd players faster matches
---
Leaked cosmetic
---
Its nice to think our feedback worked tho.
---
it is really crazy  how 1 perk in the game can affect so many builds and other perks in the game .. i kinda like it
---
I swear people in this sub see a post like this and start talking about how it’s ok to facecamp sometimes but if the topic was about tbagging survivors they would be all over that shit saying you’re a fucking degenerate for hitting the control key after dropping a pallet
---
god help us if someone like you ever got on the dev team
---
From BHVR twitter
---
Why does it not make sense for there to be more of them? Surely whenever there's anything intelligent or conscious, the last assumption you would have is that it's the only one of its kind. Because that is not a thing ever in real life, why would it be in lore? 
---
The Entity, more likely than not, is not the only one of it's kind, unless we learn more to suggest that. Same with the Mindflayer. There's no reason to suspect it at all.
---
I agree there's no reason to assume gender though.
---
I feel like Billies could use cruel containment well with tinkerer. Lots of window hopping happens with billies, and you can zoom over to the gen about to be complete and catch them in a blocked up t wall. Yeehaw.
---
babysitter is big dick. i like it
---
Especially because in the show the kids (iirc) couldn’t really do anything to close the portals with the obvious exception being Eleven
---
I call him Fredrick the Pedo to my friends
---
A *lot* of killers are explicitly called out as being totally fine with this "endless killing" deal even without the torture.
---
Clown, Ghost Face, Pig, and Shape are all specifically described as not thinking it's a bad gig or being willing to kill in the realms; with a bit of extrapolation from their personalities and the way their stories are framed, it's likely Doctor, Nightmare (sort of; I'm sure he's happy with the murdering and less happy with spider deity holding him hostage,) and Huntress feel the same way.
---
I'm pretty sure they actually outnumber the non-willing killers.
---
And then Demogorgon doesn't really count considering it's more bestial than anything else.
---
#"Ahoy ladies"
---
Better be a lobby voice line
---
The hot fuzz villians should replace Legion imo.

#**👏 Chapter 👏 Review! 👏**
---
**Killer Power** - "Hey so we heard that you liked Freddy and how he was Clown / Doctor with a global map teleport, so he's Nurse with a global map teleport!"  
---
Jokes aside I like the concept of a "counterable" Freddy teleport that has more locations than just gens. I think there's actually potential for a lot of really dumb memes (as well as actually legit builds) such as placing a portal in the basement and defending your basement chest from across the map with Territorial. There's definitely a lot of room for mindgames both with using the portals for mobility and with putting them in stupid locations so the Survivors start to cleanse them and let you sneak up on them.  
---
The punce feels kinda tacked on but I do love that we have a Killer with more engaging gameplay than "me run around loop." I hope the pounce has some relevance beyond being a glorified lunge, and I also hope that the pounce isn't Behavior's justification for making the Demogorgon 110%.
---
**Killer Perks**
---
*Surge* - Unless you're playing on The Game the average number of gens you hit with this perk is one. Two if you're lucky. With that in mind why the fuck are you taking a perk to kick a single gen and nothing else. This perk's range is far too low to be useful and you're much better off running Brutal Strength, Pop Goes, Overcharge, or Infectious Fright instead. **C** tier perk because it at least does *something* but you're far better off running literally anything else.
---
*Cruel Confinement* - Great on instadown Killers and actually makes Tinkerer not ass, since now you can go to a gen with Tinkerer and then punch the Survivors in the face with all the blocked windows. Thing is outside of instadown Killers this is Bamboozle+; a good way to get cheeky hits but not the deciding factor in a chase against any competent Survivor. **B+** for Shirtless Daddy Myers.
---
*Mindbreaker* - Holy shit this perk is *crazy* for stealth Killers. Finally Wraith and Pig can sneak up on a gen and not have the Survivors immediately Sprint Burst away! :D This perk buffs stealth Killers massively but for regular Killers it's kinda meh. Just let go of the gen early if you think the Killer is coming? I'm definitely going to want to try Mindbreak on my Wraith. **A+** tier perk.
---
**Survivor perks**
---
*Babysitter* - This perk suffers from two problems. The first issue is that Breakdown has proven that a perk just to reveal the Killer's location when you unhook someone isn't that great, and the added "benefit" of cucking yourself by giving yourself Object of Obsession for 10 seconds really doesn't help. The other big problem is the eternal "why not Borrowed Time?" question, which I really don't think Babysitter has an answer for. You can do some cheeky shit on maps with a lot of walls like Lery's, especially if your allies have Iron Will. But is that better than them taking a hit for you with Borrowed Time? **C+** tier because it *could* be useful but it feels more like a joke perk for David King mains. The Object of Obsession effect ironically makes this perk a lot weaker than it already is, as it disables all sneaky play by having you literally shout where you are to the Killer after doing an unhook.
---
*Camaraderie* - And the award for new most worthless perk in the game goes to... I get the concept of this perk: if you're being camped you can get a few extra seconds to maybe be saved but... your allies shouldn't be going to unhook you if you're being camped; they should be doing gens. Ultimately 14 extra seconds of Struggle is rarely going to be the difference between being unhooked and being camped to death.  
---
Basically there are three scenarios with this perk:
---
* You aren't being camped and get unhooked normally, henceforth this perk is useless.
---
* You are being camped and the Killer doesn't let your allies unhook you, henceforth this perk is useless.
---
* You are being camped and the Killer actually *does* get distracted by your allies and they manage to unhook you, in which case the extra 14 seconds *may* have been the deciding factor to help you escape, but probably wasn't.
---
In two out of three scenarios Camaraderie is useless, and in the final scenario it'll rarely be helpful. **D** tier perk; don't run it.
---
*Second Wind* - Great for you "Self Care wastes time" types. I do really love this perk since it allows you to save a lot of time but comes with a lot of inherent risk. This perk uber cucks you if the Killer is camping / tunneling you which makes me think that it'll be run a lot with Decisive Strike. One thing for sure is that this perk is definitely potent and really helps save time. Being able to do a gen while healing is huge. Getting this perk to activate is also really easy. I think Second Wind + Empathy + Decisive Strike + (IDK probably an Exhaustion perk) is going to be a very potent combo. **B+** tier perk because while it's incredibly strong the downsides keep it in check.  
---
Will say that I secretly love how hard this perk cucks your teammates. Got the guy with a "heal people" daily who's running We'll Make It? LOL FUCK THEM I'M BROKEN BITCH :^)
---
*Better Together* - More commonly known as "I'm running Prove Thyself." The question that needs to be asked is if this is better than Bond for doing the objective together. It's... eh? I think the Kindred effect when someone goes down is interesting but it really doesn't make-or-break this perk. Good **B** tier perk for anyone running Prove Thyself.
---
*Fixated* - Immersed Claudettes rejoice! You Urban Evasion faster! (At least, I think this works with Urban.) It's a very interesting perk that will definitely be run by a lot of immersed gamers, and I definitely know that I'll consider it in a lot of builds. Being able to see scratches is interesting but I doubt it'll be used that much. At best people might loop back to their old scratches before walking off in order to confuse the Killer. Real strength is obviously the faster walk speed which lets you reliably stealth around and potentially stop running mid chase to hide in a locker. Another **B** tier perk that will definitely see a lot of experimentation. Also probably safe to say this perk replaces Lightweight for the "mobile movement" perk.
---
*Inner Strength* - Easily the most overrated perk of the bunch. Yes "super Self Care" sounds great but you have to realize that this perk only has 5 charges total technically. And finding and cleansing a totem also takes time. I'm definitely hyped to see all the Twitch clips of Streamers hiding in a locker just to "instaheal" mid-chase but I have a feeling that this perk is going to be quite akin to We're Gonna Live Forever in standard play. You're going to have a lot of babyrage moments when someone cleanses a totem that you needed for Inner Strength. The greatest irony of this perk is that it's actually better to *ignore* totems now unless you have the perk, since someone else might have it. So the perk that "promotes totem cleansing" actually does the exact opposite. Yeah this perk basically pseudo-buffs NOED. **C+** tier perk that's really overrated. Definitely going to be some awesome Twitch highlights with this one but people will soon realize that Self Care or Medkit + Botany Knowledge is far better.
---
Are you new to the game, OP?
---
Literally every update since the game was released has in some way been a buff to killers or nerf to survivors, with the only exception being Legion nerf.
---
The killers are the real cry babies. You need to get your head out of your ass if you can’t see that.
---
I played this game so long without it I have a ton of perks to go through and BBQ and chili refuses to show up on most of my killers even with it unlocked. Sad times.
---
You can unlock this perk eventually through the shrine, with in game currency.
---
&gt; The killer ones are lackluster. Having exhausted status for 3 whole seconds after repairing a generator? Seriously that's it? It takes 3 seconds for the killer to even reach the survivor after they get in heartbeat range, and usually people stop the repair action when the heartbeat occurs.
---
you do not even understand how this perk works lmao
---
&gt; As usual, the survivor perks are strong by themselves and the killer perks need to be paired with 1 or 2 other perks to even be somewhat viable.
---
This is the direct opposite of reality
---
I mean, I'm a Wraith, Billy and Clown player, and Coldwind has always been good to me. It"s actually my favorite map to kill on next to Shelter Woods.
---
Yea I recently got a one X, it's helped tremendously (especially on the killer side), but there's still a few instances of bad connection and whatnot.
---
Oh well I definitely get destroyed some matches don't get me wrong but if I'm worried about pips(which is rarely), I generally get a black pip even in those matches just because I may not kill anyone but get 5-7 hooks. Headphones also saves me so much as a killer haha
---
Stupid fucking team, Everytime they suck ass, do stupid shit like that. I'm a killer main now lol.
---
[Unfortunately, no. And if there is, then it won't be Joe saying it.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cu3yiv/natalia_dyer_and_joe_keery_are_not_voicing_steve/)

At that point its their fault for not paying attention.

&gt; 14 seconds longer is actually almost game breaking.
---
the fucking shit people say is actually mindblowing
---
The cake ;) 🍰
---
Who you calling Pinhead?
---
Jesus man. It's just a video game
---
If someone DC their body should stay in the game for 1 minute for example, to prevent people from abusing the system, leaving the game to prevent blood warden or giving an instant hatch to his friend for example.
---
That's racist!  /s
---
Oh yeah i hated playing myers and always lagging when getting tier 3, huntress hatchets etc
---
Ever since i got an x its been way better
---
Yeah if someone plays this game without headphones they crazy IMO
---
I understand the concept behind Babysitter's double Aura reveal but *jeeze it's bad.* It eliminates any possibility for a stealthy unhook by literally screaming at the Killer "I'M HERE BITCH COME KILL ME!" And basically all the scenarios where you'd use this perk Borrowed Time is just better.
---
You're assuming I don't mean he sucks dick
---
Perks aren't utter shit. Ha sad but true. Thats where the bar is. We didn't get a bunch of useless perks to fix some minor QoL things that should honestly just be fixed with baked in mechanics or something so ridiculously niche it will never be useful.
---
They don't
---
I know they won't be voicing them and I don't care. If it won't be added, then somebody better make an edit of Steve jumping out of a locker with the line added.
---
 one of the harder things with MYC is knowing exactly who unhooked the survivor since you have to be a decent distance away for it to activate, especially if you're seeing 3+ people in the area. Babysitter will literally tell you exactly who is exposed and allow you to focus that person for an easier insta down.
---
Ngl tho, I think if they take the body blocks for it they deserve to be wiggled off.
---
... Nani?
---
Hell yeah
---
I mean it's only like $20 for the game and an additional $10 (probably) for the Stranger Things DLC. They're also most likely going to do a "Stranger Things" bundle ~~on Steam~~ to get both the game and the DLC for like $25.
---
&gt;Different killers do different things. Shocker.
---
Yes, and sometimes those "different things" are incredibly unfun and bad for the game. Turns out, if you spend 3 years creating an intricate chase system between killer and survivor, and then introduce a killer that shits all over it, survivors don't like it. Who'd have guessed??
---
Speaking of killers bad for the game, your entire argument feels very similar to those who thought old legion wasn't a problem. Which I suppose isn't shocking.
---
I kinda wished we got rotting Barb.
---
you read my mind
---
I was pooping, good news on the toilet!
---
Again. The perk is meant to make the killer focus on you. You being the person who unhooked them. It’s the entire point of the perk, you’re buying the other person time to get away.
---
omg and a cane so he can do the little cartoon frog dance &lt;3
---
I barely fcking play killer, Only got huntress to 40, Threw thousands and thousands of BP on billy and I cant get my goddamn BBQ!
---
It does not.
---
Bloodlust 1 takes 15 seconds to kick in, by the time you get Bloodlust the Survivor is no longer exposed by Iron Maiden's 15 second timer.
---
Hypothetically if you were *already in a chase* when someone procced Iron Maiden, each stage of Bloodlust adds 0.2 meters per second to the Killer, which is an additional 3 meters every 15 seconds per level.
---
3 total for Tier 1, 6 total for Tier 2, and 9 total for Tier 3.
---
Which if the Survivor does not have an exhaustion perk and the Killer is in Tier 3 Bloodlust:
---
9 meters for 115% Killer + 9 meters for T3 Bloodlust + 3 meters (lunge) = 21 meters. Reduced to 18 meters if they have an exhaustion perk or you are 110% and reduced to 15 meters if they have an exhaustion perk and you are a 110% Killer.
---
Even with Tier 3 Bloodlust the Survivor will still be safe unless they're well within your Terror Radius or run towards you instead of away.
---
A Spirit doesn't keep Bloodlust during her Spirit Walk/phasing if I recall correctly, so her equation stays relatively the same (she moves faster in Spirit Walk than phasing) but she would still be able to ride the Bloodlust for a few seconds as she changed targets before she started to phase, meaning that it would probably bump up her to 24\~ meters with no margin for error at Tier 3.
---
That still requires Spirit to within exactly 24 meters of you with Bloodlust 3, actively chasing a completely different Survivor near you for 45 seconds, and find you when you're not injured (since otherwise the exposed doesn't matter).
---
Iron Maiden sees some use with BBQ&amp;C, but usually the Survivor is too far away when they scream to make use of it, and even if it does start a chase, it's so conditional on lockers and being super close for the reveal time that you'd probably be better off with an active tracking perk like Spies from the Shadows or Whispers.
---
It's just the oversensitive and extremely hurt killer making one of these posts again. As if killer mains have never been toxic, in more ways than just camping.....
---
Just do them most are easier then survivor and the match usually makes you more blood points then spend that on your survivors.
---
But yeah I too get about 95% killer dailies.
---
Shaun: Throw it.
---
After being hit by 3/3/2 projectiles the next time you would enter the dying state instead gain deep wounds.
---
Ed: King of the Zombies.
---
For every survivor in the dying state or struggle phase gain 1/2/3% run speed.
---
Am I wrong?
---
I just want a Captain Spaulding skin for the clown already, like fucking please
---
Bruh the only reason I even get new survivors is for the new sound and design, how tf am I supposed to enjoy it when these iconic characters are getting voiced by your standard Behavior employees?
---
I don't know why so many are crazy about the perks here, they are mediocre, and as so often, far from having a chance to impact the meta, not even scratching at the S tier.
---
Then again, saying they aren't utter shit is accurate - as opposed to not few other perk releases, these aren't utter shit.
---
## bruh 🤡🤡🤡🤡🙌
---
I dont think the new update will increase the cost of the bloodpoints (at all hopefully) because they said that with the release of so many sure perks that they wanted you to have more options, if they increase the cost too much it would limit the effect.
---
I was hospital with a dislocated knee when I found out
---
An extra hit is equivalent to an insta heal anyways. Your comparison makes no sense
---
*Finally some good fucking food.*
---
Haha he already has it
---
As a Plague main, I’m always hoping to go against her as survivor but I rarely get my wish. Also I have only seen Clown like 4 times.
---
It's been announced, it's coming and they alreafy have it in game
---
/r/agedlikemilk
---
But that Doctor only works on brains.
---
Which AFAIK the Demogorgon doesn't actually have a real brain.
---
saying solo players should just play in a SWF is not a valid counter point my dude...
---
&gt; it's hard to care if it doesn't even impact the game 
---
It does tho, why do you think all these killer mains are salty about four man SWF? Its because it makes the game a lot harder with all the free information the survs give each other.
---
I'm actually also a Plague main! I've played against her once, but she sucked and the only time I ever got infected was from a gen.
---
I am so mixed on this because I LOVE LOVE Hellraiser and I have so many feels about good old Pinhead and I would just hate to have him added to the game and be disappointing &gt;.&lt; I REALLY hope that if he makes it in, they do justice to all the weird cool bullshit in the Hellraiser films :D
---
We have Bill though...
---
Kate was a stretch, but meg was there
---
You’re a god
---
Then you must be playing against potatoes, because if they don't genrush the shit out of you immediately, they need to get better at the game
---
This. I would pay atleast 50$ for that.
---
where i live it costs 12 dollars and all dlcs cost 4 dollars
---
Why not a bot? What if the DC is early in the game and it screws the other 3?
---
Yeah, the second round of reports confirms this, as well as the announcement being the reason that David Koch died.
---
... Yo, I'd take a Dracula tho
---
I just read that the bloodweb is the same till level 40, so leveling up is fine, good fucking news
---
Or maybe they are playing with a low level player because they trying to introduce someone new to the game. Seriously, no one does this. I've not once seen a group invite a new player just so they could fuck with new killers. What are you supposed to do when a friend is interested in the game, tell him to go play until he hits rank 1 so he can play with you?
---
&gt;Payment model based on cosmetics is the polar opposite of P2W...
---
Cosmetics may be potentially a form of p2w as it could help you camouflage better into maps but that's besides the point.
---
&gt;The point is playing DBD for its full value (having all perks all killers etc)
---
And cosmetics are part of the game which means you do have to consider them into the full value as some people do like to have their characters look certain way as to how some people may want to collect every card but even then they're both still different issues as getting every card may cost millions as to whatever the total cost for every single cosmetic with or without the gruesome grind to get all the ones available for shards.
---
&gt;What's so different in HS that justify costing about 30x more than DBD? If anything creating new cards seems way easier than creating new killers and maps.
---
I mean is Hearthstone a asymmetric survival horror game? Joking aside there is no set price for what something should cost for every video game to go by, one online card game may have a single card pack going for $1.99 while another online card game has it for $0.99 but there is no universal rule of "X packs must cost Y dollars". Do you feel $8 dollars per chapter is justifed? How about $10 for a Cosmetic Set? Just because another game may sell something similar for cheaper doesn't mean anything more expensive is immediately unreasonable in its price and is up to your judgement if the amount of effort put into something is worth the pricing.
---
HENDERSON!
---
Can't wait for this to be to Steve mains as the Puppet is to Ash mains.
---
&gt; saying solo players should just play in a SWF is not a valid counter point my dude...
---
Yes it is. It is not unfair if everyone has equal access. Full stop.
---
&gt; why do you think all these killer mains are salty about four man SWF?
---
Because they want something to blame when they lose.
---
&gt; it's hard to care if it doesn't even impact the game
---
&gt;&gt; It does tho ... Its because it makes the game a lot harder with all the free information the survs give each other.
---
Then explain why 4 man SWF barely has a better escape rate than solo?
---
32
---
Wtf Canada is capitalist
---
I know. You asked why MYC is a big deal against this perk. You are literally exposed for a minute and highlight yourself to the killer for a few seconds, letting the killer know exactly who activated MYC and where to go.
---
As of now the killer is just told MYC went off, they aren't given an indication on who activated it. You as a survivor don't know about MYC until it activates either so if anything Babysitter just makes MYC a stronger perk which seems backwards.
---
wE GOT IT BOYS
---
Hey, dont mind me, ill just put on franklins and omega blink and go slugging :) GL with those flashlights tho
---
I do
---
The thing is they could've done other things, such as hacking DLCs or shards or he could've hacked in the game. Hacking is hacking, even if it is just achievments
---
&gt;Ngl tho, I think if they take the body blocks for it they deserve to be wiggled off.
---
I'm not saying its a bad thing. Body blocks are often a misplay by survivors because they get injured and you are still able to hook whoever you are carrying. A well placed body block on the other hand, is a great outplay because the killer can't even drop that survivor once the wiggle bar is filled enough. 
---
Which is why I am pointing out that in certain maps, specially if another nearby hook is being used or was removed, you can easily get your wiggle bar to over 70% and a body block would be enough to free the other survivor. 
---
The wiggling and hook placement is fine as it is.
---
I'm a killer main too, but playing survivor with my friends is too much fun not to do it
---
 n e v e r m i n d
---
generally refers to their unique perks and how difficult they are to use based on situation
---
Or maybe a chonky perk for Ed:
---
While being carried by the killer, reduce the carrying speed by 3/6/9%
---
I gen tapped the first week I played because I legit did not understand how it worked. In a party with a girl who was tapping, I explained how to do it and asked her if she knew and she also didn’t realize it was so easy. We crushed the gens after that &amp; I still play with her. I just think the game needs to force players into tutorial the first time you open it.
---
Yeah I thought about it and realized it's shit-tier
---
Opinion A: it will let teamates know when you die, therefore unhooking you last second only to get ambushed by the pig seconds later.
---
Opinion B: survivors that act altruistic and dont only care about themselves will be able to know when to save you while getting facecamp/ tunneled resulting in a situation where both survive or both die.
---
[HA FUCK YOU](https://twitter.com/nxonnetflix/status/1164945466405998592)
---
I would recommend switching unbreakable for prove thyself
---
It generally has no meaning for survivors, and for killers it's typically accurate as for how difficult it is to use effectively
---
Yeah, funny part is he says "I'm not going to give my opinions, just what they said on the dev stream". Boi giving your opinion is what keeps this from getting copystriked lol
---
Because they have potential when garbage like mad grit, iron maiden, dark devotion, hangmans trick, Left Behind etc are worthless through and through. At worst most of these perks are just innovative fun memes or outclassed by current perks it seems. People are just excited to see some common sense and innovation go into perk designs instead of some filler thats just a bad fix for complaints about SWF or some basic gameplay  design flaw that deserves a patch not a bandaid perk.
---
Thanks, Ill definitely try to apply to bhvr
---
It's not that hard. 100% to 51% is first stage, 50% to 1% is second one. Half and half.
---
It's a strategy. It's just not a good one. It only works against bad players.
---
I got downvoted?  That's how you work through ruin and improve your game at hitting great skill checks.  But hey, keep on gen tapping until it explodes and maintain your inability to play the game at a higher level.
---
You never improve if you take shortcuts Lolololol
---
The post we all needed clogging up the sub.  Really thoughtful, impressive, artistic work.
---
Idk for sure on some of them but like, Bill died in LfD, Tapp died in SAW, and from what I know All of the killers have died in their stories.
---
Maybe if they made it work on your first stage of the hook then it wouldnt be as useless. But even then i couldnt see it being good enough to use
---
Like u/Signmydeathnote said the F13 license is caught in legal hell which is why the F13 game can't continue development. It's probably the same for a lot of other licenses.
---
Still -9 and -2 points :P
---
The difficulty rating for survivors is based on their 3 teachable perks. It tells you how challenging it might be to survive if you were to use their perks and only their perks.
---
See I agree that wiggling and hook placement is fine, the wiggling is just a timer for the killer to hook them aka to punish the killer for being greedy / slow. It's most likely the killers fault if they aren't able to hook a downed surv or some great bodyblocking which has now made 1/multiple survs injured. Its a win-win imo.
---
An instaheal requires you to stop for a few seconds to use up the instaheal. Instaheal also don’t work at tier 3 madness, when getting 1 shot ( exposed or chainsaw), The madness can be lost through Franklin’s demise,  Does my comparison make more sense now?
---
Yes yes yes a thousand times Yes
---
Okay, fuck the fact that they for 2 years promised optimization for PS4. Im returning to this game
---
BHVR can just take my wallet at this point.
---
I had to check the players add one because I was in a game just like this last night with a friend. Could’ve sworn this was our lobby for a second.
---
You could just say he is if a BDSM fan turned psycho
---
Yup. That's where I got my info from too!
---
I was a newbie Nurse on Haddonfield of all places (which really messed up my blinks because of bushes, walls, multiple levels with small rooms) once upon a time, it was frustrating, but getting to blink through even some of the most annoying obstacles meant I still got the 4K.
---
You can add up everything that makes survivors frustrating to play against and you can certainly escape a low-to-moderately skilled Nurse, but someone who actually mains Nurse is still going to crush you into a paste.
---
Holy SHIT its official I’m so happy
---
I'm sure they'll get good impressions. The unfortunate truth is that getting the voice actors just to record them panting and screaming would probably cost a hella-lot of cash, and they had to no doubt pay a lot to get the rights to everything else.
---
Basically the real voice actors would probably for BHVR to charge $5 extra per DLC.
---
Lore says that the tunnels are dark and cramped but eventually let out near the campfire. Death is not an escape.
---
Are you sure? Two days ago you posted on reddit asking what Thanataphobia does. I have the feeling you're quite new and don't understand exactly how toxic this game is.
---
Same. For me its pretty much with the pig: oh boy level 49. I hope I get level 1 BBQ. *one match later* alright its time to get BBQ! Bloodweb: thats good, but what about....... Insidious and thanataphobia. At this point I think the game is making fun of me playing a mid/low tier killer
---
I would honestly love this.
---
Speak for yourself, that sounds amazing.
---
~~Also I can't imagine it'll be too long until someone clips screams out of the show and finds a way to replace the in-game screams with them without it triggering some sort of anti-cheat.~~
---
They meant like a non human creature killer that would have a non humanoid skeleton model. Pinhead has technically always been on the table.
---
You gotta chase a lot to learn what chases are not worth it imo. Every now and then i get matched with *that guy* that run me around like its nothing and i commit 100% for that sweet sweet practice.
---
Not to mention the fact that they put it on sale every other week on steam
---
I'd shell out so much money to do that goofy little dance BHVR HELP!!!
---
Wait dont leave me! I must ask further questions!

I do wish that breaking LOS for long enough just reset the 99%

Baker proves that it is possible to escape the nightmare by dying enough times and simply fading away. I think that means the Entity ate them, but at least it’s over.

---
Am I beeimg whooshed or is this idea the spirit but ever so slightly worse
---
If you're also planning on camping the hook, then yes.
---
Just to add, this perk singlehandedly adds 20-30 seconds onto 1 person doing a gen if they have been hooked.
---
I agree. You pair some of these perks with other perks and you have a solid but niche build, but imo they’re not nearly as strong as people are saying they are
---
I pretty sure you are not. (please correct me if so)
---
I would still spend the $8 for the entire licensed chapter just so you unlock everything instead of spending $10 with Auric Cells or even more.
---
Jonathan is a character from Stranger Things. I'm not gonna say anything else unless you want spoilers.
---
There are other better tracking perks if you practice (Whispers being the big one, but some people swear by Spies in the Shadows) that are so much better than Iron Maiden's extremely conditional 3 second detection of one survivor when they exit a locker. If they hide in a locker at all.

I'm guessing next Tuesday but is purely a guess
---
It is OP with dream pallets
---
I used to really enjoy running Rancor and Furtive Chase until they "fixed" it.  When Furtive Chase first came out the obsession would change to anyone who unhooked somebody, even if the hooked person wasn't the obsession.  It was a lot of fun, now it's too specific and much more difficult to get the stacks.

This is quality, I laughed out loud and way to hard at this.

Thank you.

Plague, Freddy and Legion are probably the least common in my experience. Hag and Doc are 2 of my mains so I'm glad to rep for the minorities. I just started with legion too, haven't face him/her many times.
---
I SAID AT IS IN DWIGHT SUCKS DICK. There that is all
---
Damn. I play ps4 US servers. I haven't been face camped in the last maybe 15-20 matches. I apologize for your luck of killers

r/UnexpectedJojo
---
Every killer will run Make your choice, Iron Maiden, haunted grounds, and Thrill of the hunt to counter the new perks
---
Not a meme build, quite actually a strong build, especially for someone that takes awhile to set up (Trapper, Hag, etc) since you can slow down gens once set up. You could also run Distressing instead of Overcharge because everyone in 16 and below goes absolutely bonkers at any hint of a terror radius.
---
But you don’t know if they hacked other things. No, “hacking is hacking” no, not all hackings are the same. Hacking to get a skin in no way affects gameplay, hacking to get an infinite speed boost does.

Her deep wounds timer was probably at 0.005 sec since you can't see the progress of it, but it pauses there while she is mending. That's why she didn't stop to run because had to get the mend off first. When you hit her, you interrupted this and the timer went down to 0.000 sec, sending her down as soon as she was interrupted.
---
Yah Michael is one of those killers who are just a straight up demon from hell and fears nothing and no one including the entity!
---
Too many times I've been a rank 18 killer against a rank 15, 12, 6, and 3 survivor swf
---
Fuck off with this shit BHVR. Why are you punishing me just for trying to play the game instead of the swf players with massive rank disparity? Do the matchmaking based on the highest survivor in the group, not the lowest.
---
Don't worry totem you live another day
---
Yeah as a person who is mediocre at huntress the only times I can hit skilled players around a loop is at windows and pallets. It’s a mind game because if they keep going they might be safe if you wind up too early they’re safe if you wind up too late they’re safe if they drop it they’re hit if they don’t and you fake a throw they’re hit. 
---
She’s like a 50/50 at those locations and it’s hard with the way frame rates effect her power sometimes seemingly chugging when you hold back L2 to make throws in general. I feel like she’s playable on console but it’s going to be that much harder. You can put a piece of tape or something in the center to slightly help. Like huntress training wheels until you get used to the screen field of view and where your hatchets actually go.
---
Because not everybody is a sweaty tryhard and actually plays this VIDEO GAME for fun.
---
Too bad they can't just make gens involve more steps so you don't need to buy DLC to prevent rushing.
---
I’m just laughing at the idea.
---
What's the meme template?
---
Ruin and NOED are big for a reason.
---
You okay dude? Just finish a match you got tbagged or facecamped? 
---
Seriously tho positivity in the community is a good thing. Makes everyone less toxic and salty.
---
I think it's less talking about how teabagging and all that stops you from playing and more talking about how getting on The Killer's nerves is most likely going to result in them being incredibly toxic to you
---
Casual would be exactly the same as this, because, this is casual.
---
Not a chance.
---
I want her red jacket outfit from season 1!!!
---
eleven did this not the rock😬
---
I always hear this excuse, but there's absolutely a difference between prioritizing gens and allocating all of your resources explicitly to optimize gen time and voice-chatting to be sure you can work on them safely, all while ignoring bones and inevitably complaining about NOED.
---
I agree just cause a killer can lay an object on the ground to teleport to, doesn't make them the same as the hag. Is every teleport killer just a worse nurse?
---
Casual doesn't have any fucking ranks, just fucking have a ranked match making option and most of the BS will go there, not a perfect thing but it would be at least a little bit of a QOL improvement
---
You're really overstating how effective Iron Will is vs Spirit, a decent Spirit isn't that reliant on injury noises, if she were then you'd never be able to hit healthy survivors in the first place, considering getting a hit without using your power as a 110 killer is really tough.
---
Head on is in the meta of swf, as a bully tool. Don't feel bad if someone is triggered by its use.

I'd love this very much.
---
3 seconds, wow!
---
I watched horror movies all the time by the time I was 5. So did my mom, and her mom, and my two little sisters. We’re all fine, nobody is psychologically damaged or ready to kill someone or anything.
---
Bleed.
---
I'm not talking about something situational-specific, like someone running NOED. I'm talking about the culture, in general, of bitching and moaning because survivors have the audacity to do their objective. I'm also not just talking about SWF, as being accused of being toxic gen-rushers isn't specific to SWF.
---
People seem to forget the killers aren't entitled to a 4K any more than the survivors are entitled to escape.
---
What was endgame chat like?
---
NANI?!?!!? Wait you mean hes gay or hes bad?
---
Anything to help killer queues.
---
It sounds like we play Ghostface in a similar way, which I don't see too many people doing on streams.  I really don't even stalk that much, I mostly go for gen grabs and suprise attacks, making sure I'm in stealth mode as much as possible.  A Nurse's Calling goes great with Make Your Choice too.
---
then the only thing wrong there is the description.
---
You misread my post. He was saying I was bad at the game for using it. He got a 4K and I was the only one using it.
---
/s ?
---
Yes, as stated, they are not utter shit, but they don't have potential to become metagame perks either. They line up pretty well with the lacklustre releases of the past, that left the meta mostly unchanged. Only killers have gotten at least a handful perks throughout the last years that are now assets to the meta. Which, even that is still decidedly too few. And from how these perks sound now, none of them will impact the meta.
---
Either way, I am talking about people praising these perks to high heaven, saying they are awesome, and such. But I know that reddit is usually like that, and I have seen some more reasonable takes on the perk releases here, as well.
---
i praise iron will because without iron will, there is no counterplay lol.  Iron will lets a mindgame even happen.  A good spirit, there is no mindgame.
---
Now put steves on quentin
---
Are there any flickering light when Demogorgon come?
---
Unfortunately yes. Well guessed!
---
lol that’s what I’m saying, you are complaining about stupid stuff
---
That's exactly how I play. I use stealth to walk straight towards a rescuer that is running away without them knowing I'm coming. They're usually reckless and sprint from the hook so I catch them easy!
---
Ouch.... my soul.... it hurts..... why have you hurt me so.....
---
Nurse teleports behind you     
---
*Nothing personel, kid*    
---
Gets slapped by Noed
---
Ayy same! Luckily I haven't face one in 2 weeks.
---
&gt;I've not once seen a group invite a new player just so they could fuck with new killers.
---
Then you're lucky because people have been doing this forever.
---
No /s. It's just like a easy way to get it across that your are being sarcastic without saying it.
---
I can't give you gold, but please know that I laughed so hard I hurt my throat.
---
DOES THIS MEAN WE GET GUN JACKET AVIATOR NANCY?
---
Not to kill anyone, i watched adult films aswell through my siblings. But like getting nightmares or being a bit, irritated i guess. But its fine, as long as shes okay
---
OP here,
---
damn didn't realize all this.
---
which one is the god pallet? and why is it the god pallet?
---
Actually that perk is quite underrated. 
---
Using it in SWF help you and your mates to know what perks and (some) add ons the killer is using. But yeah, it's not that useful to use it in solo queue.
---
What’s wrong with Quentin?
---
just add /s at the end?
---
old mories are bad, might as well not give him a hard time
---
I'm literally just refuting your point of "Spirit must be difficult because there are people here that say they can't play her". There's a difference between being good at a killer and a killer being good. I can practice all I want and be the best Leatherface on earth, and I'll still be pretty bad at high ranks, because Leatherface is a killer that is difficult to get downs with. Spirit, on the other hand, is an easy killer to get downs with, once you know how to play her. Therefore, she's an easy killer. 
---
And yes, she's viable because she's easy to get downs with, very astute observation. She ignores the main way survivors have to kill time, with little to no counterplay opportunities from the survivor. Again, because she's an easy killer.
---
Okay, whatever you say.
---
They said in the Dev stream that it does NOT combo! Second Wind will not activate if you are Broken from something else. So if you are infected by Plague, use deliverance or a killer add on applies it to you, Second Wind will not work.
---
 If you Deliverance, Second Wind might wait out the Deliverance broken timer before it heals you. We will find out for sure during PTB though.
---
Dbd is the smash bros of horror
---
Maybr
---
Just ask them to open the gate for you
---
&gt;So escqping should be impossible?
---
When the Killer closes the hatch in a 1v1 it should have the Killer have the advantage especially since the Survivors failed twice to escape.
---
&gt;Should the survivor do 5 gens?
---
No? the Survivor should try to find the hatch because that's their second chance.
---
&gt;Usually when the hatch is closed for me it is usualky 3 gens or 2 gens because I like everyoje having fun qnd not ruining there experience.
---
Killer's job is to ya know... kill, not baby Survivors because they failed to outplay the Killer and do their job.
---
also fun is subjective.
---
&gt;Thanks for the downvote, stranger.
---
Didn't downvote you but okay.
---
Unfortunately Steam discussions are full of complaining
---
Okay, if he dodge this hatchet tho.
---
He did tho
---
Golden
---
Too bad you don’t get blood points for KYF... or am I missing a joke you made or something?
---
well when a 4 man SWF stand at the exit gates teabagging making them Depip and lose all there items is the one tool the killer has to fight back
---
I’m willing to join one
---
Because killing people is literally the point of playing killer?  All bloodpoints get you is more stuff - it's not the reason to play the game believe it or not.  If BP was all anybody cared about no one would play Myers or Trapper.
---
That face reminds me of KAAANTOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
---
Jake is also based on a real employee that they had on the stream.
---
Doc main here.
---
Gimme the Game, or any round map. :^)
---
Thats not true, the survivor has to he stealthy while looking and the killer can just look everywhere freely
---
That emblem is called "Gatekeeper"
---
It would completely change the nature of the game from a survivor perspective if you were in first person.   
---
 No more mind gaming window vaults and pallets.
---
what is the right way. just curious
---
the one thing i would change about it is make it instant so it could be used as a weapon in a chase
---
Succeeding in games is fun. Having perks that tangibly assist you in doing so is fun. Creating, using and facing a variety of builds and fresh builds and learning to play with and against them is fun. Weak perks are boring and only very few people use them. But please, you freshly-showered try-not, have *fun* with your Babysitters and Second Winds, Surges and Cruel Confinements! The sweaty tryhards of us will keep using the Borrowed Times and Adrenalines, the Ruins and Bamboozles, and... well, not have as much fun as we could have with new perks, because these are the same we've been using for ages already.
---
Strong perks that do impactful stuff are the only ones that create engaging and exciting gameplay interactions. We hardly ever get any of those, though. The last meta-relevant survivor perk to have been released in more than two years was killed after not much more than a month of play. The last 3 chapters did not have S-tier killer perks either (apart from Infectious Fright on Nurse).
---
The fun-factor of these new perks will wear thin and wear out really quickly, for most players.
---
Priority? Since when ?
---
Normal work Dwight into Pajamas! *Its nap time*! 
---
David into Shirtless David! *Is it me or the match suddenly got hotter*? 
---
Comfy Cardigan Feng into fancy dress, *dressing to impress*! 
---
The possibility are endless.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cuiblb/playing_as_the_killer_for_the_first_time_in_a/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Or you don't seriously critique a fucking rant? Piss off.
---
I mean, you do you, but when you're literally just sitting on your hands face camping because you want that one kill, are you even really "playing"?
---
I feel moving sweaterboi to uncommon at the least, because he's got alot going for him now
---
Ok cheers, I'll just wait for that then
---
If they add more content and then lose the lawsuit - the money they make from that content goes bye-bye.  So yeah, the reason the devs aren't making any more content is because of the lawsuit.
---
I wish I could get more perks to put on my main man Jake but the only shit the bloodweb likes to give me is stuff like Left Behind, and other perks that I don't want. Glad the bloodweb is gonna be changed soon
---
Yeah
---
If the place where hatch leads looks that creepy, I won't be jumping through it again.. Ever.
---
Pretty sure thats where hag lives
---
It won't be a great perk for anyone, maybe decent on some, but great perks are stuff like POGW or ruin lol
---
I think Pennywise would be a good idea
---
I hope Nancy gets that sweet jacket someone shared in the replies
---
Maybe Michael is the entity considering he is referred to as "evil incarnate".
---
literally dying at the killer mains trying to justify their relliance on noed.
---
Buddy if you suck literal ass at the game perhaps you shouldn’t get a kill because of a perk 🥵
---
Why even worry about pips, just have fun ? It’s not as they are event hard to get back anyways lol
---
Since the EGC. The killer can close the hatch during the animation of the survivor jumping in.
---
But I think the hatch is fine as it is.
---
I think he means how long it takes to activate it
---
No? That's like saying adrenaline is fair because noed exists and vica versa. Its not compareable.
---
I just 3k'd an SWF with Pig (just started playing her and I have barely any perks) and the last person got the hatch because they were slugged and it spawned on them.
---
First thing the hatch escapee says in post game chat: GG EZ noob camper
---
Rofl, some people's children - I swear.
---
Maybe the Mind Flare and the entity are the same thing. Maybe this entire time we were playing in the upside down.
---
They really should just have cross platform progression
---
Dream Pallets are worse than snares btw
---
Same. I actually learned the old Freddy and got really good with him about a month before the rework. I was so sad to see him go. He really wasn't as bad as people thought. I got to rank 1 with him! He was great imo when you learn his playstyle. 
---
I played rework freddy a couple times when he first came out but haven't touched killer again since then. : -(
---
Why is that upvoted?
---
Its cotes Reaction of dbd getting stranger things licensed. 
---
You can see it in the most recent stream of Dead by daylight.
---
That's literally the purpose of end game collapse though?
---
Snares are not even good. They are so easy to avoid
---
Is babysitter even fun though? Most hooks are out in the open and if its a camping/patrolling killer they are going to see you and the person you unhooked most likely. Plus since your aura is shown to the killer they’ll know you have Babysitter and wont try to look for scratch marks.
---
Its a perk that seems like it works on paper but in an actual game it will be near useless and counter effective. Add on the Furtive Chase/Make your Choice counters and god its even worse. Even just a bloodpoint bonus would make the perk better.
---
I don’t really know, but when IT chapter two comes out, the survivor could be one of the now grown kids.
---
Monster
---
So you basically want Dwight with suspenders.
---
Urban Evasion is only crouch-walking. Fixated affects walking. So no.
---
I still don't think it's completely useless.
---
Think about it this way: when you find a survivor early and they Sprint burst/balanced/lithe away, you don't have to run them down. Now they're forced to either not do a gen for 40 seconds, or hop on a nearby gen and pause their exhaustion regeneration - leaving them vulnerable if you happen to walk by. That's pressure - and in the meantime, you're free to go find other survivors.
---
It's the best map set
---
For survivors
---
You have a very small sample size. Lots of other people have had a much larger sample size, and understand how numerous the shitty people are. It's that large sample size which lets the vast majority of us know that something like voice chat would absolutely lead to nothing but horrible shit-talking and trolling.
---
Can we continue? I like wasting your time.
---
By the way, specialty and special needs (which I assume you’re implying) are two different things. I presume you didn’t know that, as you’ve already seemed uneducated, but specialty means you’re good at something pal. Let’s just say you don’t have a specialty at DbD from what I’ve seen.
---
It's especially fucked up since all of the matches are ranked. Rank 12 killer against ranks 5, 5, 9 and 10? Well fuck me and depip me, I guess.
---
TLDR: "Give my teammate a free unhook!  Don't you know Rule 637 out of the Survivor's Rulebook for Killers?"
---
Unless there's a gen that's not completed right next to the hook he's probably hoping to bait your teammate into coming for the unhook.  If he doesn't know where the hatch is or where your teammate is then he's literally got to either camp you or wander around the map hoping he finds the other survivor or the hatch while giving you a free unhook.
---
Given that there are two gens left camping is not a bad option - he guarantees his 3k and the last survivor has basically zero chance of finishing the last two gens before you're dead anyways.  If he doesn't know where the hatch is then he gets only slightly worse odds of getting the 4k by camping and he definitely gets the 3k.  If your buddy has a key or one of the gens is 99'd then he could end up losing both of you if he leaves.
---
He's not required to do worse just because you want him to.
---
Well, all you have to not  get grab in shadow walk is stay injured
---
Lucky son of a bitch
---
When in doubt run into the corn and bob n weave. Corn blindness is real, especially on shorter killers.
---
Because we're used to new survivor perks not 3ven being mediocre, they're usually just straight up bad.
---
Wow another noed  complaint what else is new?!
---
Me when a Hag with any perks is heading to the basement
---
Whoa, I bet you were fun a parties.
---
Especially since the unhooked survivor would still make injured noises.
---
i mean, slugging so the last person cant get the hatch is kind of abuse of the hatch mechanic too...and as far as instaheals go...youve got a mori my dude. and dont act like you wouldnt be playing a meat plant offering if you werent running a mori
---
I completely agree with this suggestion, most of all I would love to play as a Killer in VR!
---
Bing is legit the best for porn
---
I understood this reference.
---
they specifically stated that if the lawsuit were to be solved, they wouldn't make more content regardless of the outcome. They got rid of the developers that made the game shortly after (Illfonic) and barely bug fix the game as is. They already had finished content ready to go but refused to release it, infact most recently they accidentally released some of that finished content on the Switch port and removed it.
---
What show?
---
Tell that to bubba
---
And she has pretty long cooldowns on her power too
---
Pipping up really is easy though, you said you are rank 4, in a couple days you will probably be rank 1
---
Kids aren't allowed, Steve, Nancy, Quentin and Lauries ages are different.
---
All 3 killer perks are either bad or very niche.  Maybe Billy/LF can use the one that blocks vaults after downing a survivor.  Surge is way worse than PGTW (and somehow most people think it's really good?) and Mindbreaker isn't even close to worth a perk slot.
---
Survivors got a couple good perks though.
---
🦀 **RACISM IS OVER** 🦀
---
Mix of with Borrowed Time and your chase winning perks and it’s probably going to be a fun time if you like playing the hero
---
I’m getting this as soon as this is out
---
That or when there isn’t a camping killer the survivors leave you up there to die
---
Me too.
---
https://youtu.be/AZ8T1ZWUGaI
---
imagine watermarking an image when all you did was throw some words on it, that's the real "holy shit" right there
---
It's almost like survivors hate having basically there needed perks taken away due to a grey add-on, I agree that these perks are not broken, but people still complain so much about survivors now. To the point where the last meta perk we got that wasn't nerfed into the ground was DH. dh is such a shit perk 2
---
Oh so better make your choice and better bbq, cool.
---
I agree. Also the range need a buffed. This perk is bad, but what's even worse is it is an EXHAUSTION perk. Make it a LOT stronger.
---
Idk why you're replying with such a condescending tone, as if calling everything OP is what every "gamer" does. I know what it is at its core, an exaggeration. I ALSO know when to and when not to use an exaggeration, which a large part of THIS community doesnt seem to understand. At least, not as well as the others I've been apart of. You are evidence of that. So now that you've replied to me as if I have never played a video game before and belittle my point, I have to come across like an ass to you. Not my intention though! You left me very little wiggle room to come across as anything else
---
seY
---
Think in the form of a hero-shooter. Each character has perks and abilities that can help them and their teammates. You are not just picking a skin, each survivor has a completely different perk set that is suited for different situations.
---
Oh my bad. It wasn't a month or so ago when I tried it out.
---
Has the new "stranger things" update hit consoles yet?
---
And I'll let them all go, bless their hearts
---
So there is a very narrow band of playstyles that enables a player to gain points and despite providing players explicitly with the addons to deviate from that playstyle, players are nonetheless punished for it with fewer bloodpoints.
---
That's poor design to me.
---
Wow these are pretty good
---
Can't wait to Head On the Demogorgon with a Scoops outfit.
---
i think my favorite part of playing survivor is no matter what perk you run, there's a killer perk or add on that hard counters it
---
Yeah. I was oddly thinking of Jason goes to hell for some reason. Freddy is in that one.
---
Who the heck is Steven?
---
Can u Show me that tho ? Because the game is flickering and i cant do anything , s9 plus btw
---
Well it would be stupid to unconditionally depip the survivors when the killer DCs.  It's just when the killer DCs early on, nobody has done enough yet to warrant a pip, or even a black pip.
---
Not a problem! I'm glad I could help! :D
---
Did this today with Wraith, ran M&amp;A, Insidious, Distressing, and Ruin (so I could at least have time to play with it lol) and used the Ghost and Beast addons. Beautiful stuff.
---
I never see Puppet Ash and it makes me sad.
---
You still shouldnt rq if that happens
---
Tue killer i face the most is probably huntress.
---
Dunno why you’re getting downvoted, I always thought it was obvious Dwight was some sort of Shaun homage.
---
When the hatch is open go wait by a gate and as soon as the killer closes it, start opening. Works 100% of the time, 50% of the time
---
One of my favorite maps honestly.
---
My point was the opposite. A killer can be boring to some and fun for others. 
---
Nurse can be boring by easily downing people. Some may find it fun to be so OP.
---
It’ll be coming in early September I believe
---
@itskelvinn on ps4. I play regularly. Killer main but I’m open to anything
---
Bing is like that weird cousin who has all the weird porn and doesn't hide it while Google is like your mom and is like "instead of gangbang whores, how about a recipe for cookies?" And hides the porn.
---
I think I remember reading that the entity feeds off of their intense emotions so maybe if the survivors stop caring or feeling fear and despair etc. they would be taken by the entity and not have to go into the trials anymore.
---
Yet somehow F13: The Game just launched on the Nintendo Switch and Friday the 13th: Killer Puzzle came out last year....
---
lol Iron Maiden is useless on anyone but The Huntress. The 15 second Exposed just is too little. It should be 30 seconds at least.
---
Misses chainsaw.
---
People have been asking for DBD movies.
---
Yeah I didn’t bitch about pointless “problems”
---
I really like Pharmacy.
---
Papa franku?
---
I had to disable messagge in my accout. What the fuck is wrong with survivors? If i won tgey insult me, if i lose they insult me. Can i play a fucking videogame in peace?
---
Hoping we get his season 2 outfit as well
---
When you're defeated by normal Steve but now it's *scoop* time.
---
How about you go fucking take a .45 and deepthroat it, you fucking inbred piece of shit autist.
---
Respawn needs to take notes, this is how you get people to spend money without hating your company
---
Depends on the map some are stupidly far apart and some are right next to each other.
---
Most of the time I sacrifice the 3rd one and the 4th is waiting on the hatch anyway.
---
You... You realize bloodpoints are a currency, not your rank, right? You can still rank up using a wide variety of play styles (and still get bloodpoints using these play styles as well) without feeling “punished” for your choice.
---
Watch any YouTuber play this exact same build. None of them got anything lower than gold much unlike the OP. You can play any build you want and still get bloodpoints and rank up as much as you want as long as you play it WELL.
---
Do you play any other games? Name a game where you can play poorly and expect the same rewards as someone who played the same character or same build or same playstyle who played it exceptionally.
---
If you think it’s bad game design because you can’t play badly and get rewarded heavily then you must not like many game’s designs at all
---
Dude I was just proposing proxy chat as something that could happen and I think after all the hours of survivor and some hours as killer I have a very big sample of how toxic people are
---
I feel like the last time I saw someone uncontrollably swear thinking they were slick shit, it was a 15 year old with Tourette’s
---
That makes sense good man
---
You sure the offering didnt go back to your inventory?
---
Anyway, secret offering = alt f4 mid loading. BHVR should get rid of offerings to stop this.
---
Pinhead seems like they'd have plenty of ideas for powers, I would love to see him in the game, but maybe as a paragraph.
---
There is a community called cult of the dwights i believe
---
The point is... If the Killer grabs you, they're fucked, if they decide to leave you, they're fucked. I hope I don't face this TBH.
---
I feel like the last time I ran into a fucking smartass like your "big brain" piece of shit self, he was a pasty malnourished kid I bet you're just the same lmao
---
I've lost at least 20+ offerings because of people dc'ing when it comes to double bloodpoints or the play killers for free offerings.
---
I mean, not exactly but no matter how much I ate it wouldn’t have as much salt as you’ve managed to manifest

Just in time for all the furries/children/depressed adults

TF2 is a shell of what it was. I re-installed it last week after not playing for almost 5 years.
---
Never again.

Not really , if there is than its a very small group. That being said ... Would you me and some friends behind the pizza joint?
---
*cough, Tenacity, cough*

What if you wanted to play Pig

But God said: [Disconnected]
---
Do we arrive at the departure gate and depart from the arrival area?
---
The last S tier DLC perk was Spirit Fury (and MoM but that was nerfed). Its a shame. These perks have potential but they still arent that good. Camaradrie only works ONCE (that is like Left Behind tier garbage) and Babysitter is just a worse borrowed time. Nancy’s perks are a lot more interesting and have a lot more potential. 
---
Demogorgons perks just seem annoying and yet still not good. Stuff like Cruel Confinement against a Billy. If they are coming to your gen thats almost done and you do the correct play of committing to the gen and finishing it you better hope theres a pallet because you’re dead. 
---
I hope I’m wrong though.
---
Half the time, the killers know we don't look for hatch/ we sit at gate for endgame to proc and then literally just sit on hatch not closing it. This especially happens if hatch is in the middle of two gates and they find it right away. Thats totally not taking the game hostage or anything.  
---
If keys proc more in chest/showed up more in webs, this wouldn't be such an issue. I maybe get a key 4-5 matches in and thats if the hatch doesnt rng in dumb spot plus we at 5 gens so its not even spawn yet. Most of my games, randoms die on first hook(or even dc)/killer camps hook or proxies super hard for 5-10 mins in the area, and then you are left alone to hope you come across the hatch before they do like someone said earlier 'freely walk around'. I play both pc and ps4, but its super hard to find hatch bc the audio is so off/not sync right on ps4. I purposely take chest perk just bc I need a key if my team is ass and all my friends quit bc of the bs. Just like Friday 13, I have a hate/love relationship with this game. Its just nice to see someone who plays both sides come out and say, ya I don't think this is fair. So thank you for that.
---
"Salt" "salt" "salt" is that all you can fucking say? What are you, a fucking aspie?
---
Does he look like a bitch
---
Correct
---
It didn't go back to my inventory, I've never gotten any back whenever it happens. Maybe ps4 doesn't have that?
---
Not quite
---
Came here to see if anyone else said it. I was watching Stranger Things and thought how Quentin looked more like Jonathan.
---
No, you arrive to the exit gate and exit the trial.
---
HHHHHHH 
---
OH Y 
---
HIOI
---
YEAHAH
---
I don’t think people got that this was a joke..
---
Borrowed Time just seems like enough.
---
8 seconds of leaving no trail VS. 15 seconds of just having an extra health state.
---
If the killer is far enough, the 8 seconds of no marks wouldn't do much, if the killer is close enough chances are they will know where the unhooked person is regardless so the no trail is pointless and having the 15 second Endurance effect would be better. Sure you CAN run both, but that just seems like overkill and an unnecessary waste of a 2nd perk slot.
---
Unfortunate.
---
It'd be the new pebble perk, the one that killers begrudging allow to fool them just once for the jokes.
---
I say Nay Nay to all... Id rather have a new killer with a new design
---
If you say so.
---
I’m excited for it, but I wish hopper was one of the new characters, I think he would have been a good fit.
---
If youre getting 360'd a lot you can often counter that by backing up while you swing. This puts the surv more or less in front of you again.
---
You honestly could've just put Iron Maiden in Calm Spirits place cuz Iron Maiden is garbage I'm everyone but The Huntress.
---
this is fucking terrifying
---
Of course you are, should have guessed lmfao. People like you should be euthanized at birth.
---
U dont alressy?
---
AHOY LADIES
---
I prefer to let natural selection run its course. Anyone below rank 4 is a different story though
---
Because there's a hard counter to Adrenaline &amp; Decisive Strike. Totally.
---
Sorry, I was making an airport joke from Big Trouble.  I should have added /s as no one watched that movie.

whoops, fixed

Theres certainly some reference to Shawn for sure

Steve’s perks are truly awful, I’ll never use a single one

Eat shit

*Scoop Time.*

I’m good 😂😂
---
Isn't it like when you're meddling with his portals you do not hear his terror radius and when he comes out of one he doesn't have a terror radius for a short bit?
---
You are misinformed. They used the lawsuit as an escape route. They were informed about the lawsuit and completely dropped what they were planning to add as new content (Paranoia game mode, counselor cosmetics, new jasons, new counselors etc) to focus working on dedicated servers.
---
What they could have done was release everything early and then patch it later after the lawsuit. They could have also implemented dedicated servers after the lawsuit too. They were simply using it as a scapegoat to stop working on the game.
---
So much for those devs being “diehard fans” of the F13 franchise.
---
noed hard counters adrenaline. rancor hard counters ds. but sure pretend survivors are SOOOOOOO op amirite????? XD

We have to be getting this as an outfit, right?!  They probably know demand is high and will make it the same cost of the chapter :(
---
So pallets should cause exhaustion too, because I can pallet stun a killer and sprintburst away
---
Word
---
You arent going for ur obsession with this... quite the oposite, u want it alive till u can use rancor
---
Sloppy is best paired with Nurses for the extra detection time. I also like it in case the surv gets away, then my chase time doesnt feel completely wasted because they have a longer heal time. If you are relying on sloppy as your primary way of slowing the game down though, ya you will be disappointed.
---
"Awesome" map we shall see about that.
---
Lightborn is free down or even two before they realize. *mileage may vary depending on your killer and rank*
---
Normal Jeff to Metalhead skin
---
*Im the killer now, bitch*
---
Supernatural
---
But that's the thing, the obsession changes with furtive chase! Rancor is my safety net
---
So how much is the chapter for all of them?
---
Noed doesn't always get to be put into play thanks to it being a hex but I don't even know how Rancor counters ds.

Given that there’s 2 gens left and only 2 alive with one on the hook, camping is a horrible option. They aren’t going to finish 2 gens with only 2 people against a Freddy so it really doesn’t matter if he gets the unhook or not. The 3k is already in the bag. If he does get the unhook, you know where both of them are. All camping does in this situation is give the last survivor time to find the hatch uncontested.
---
Unffrf yes, Daddy Myers, mori me please.
---
I wish. Solo queue is a rough world and I'm not the strongest looper...
---
So why not run dying light instead?
---
I'm genuinely impressed at how wrong you are. 50 hours? Really, dude?  
---
That wasn't even possible in the original build of the game, when there only seven characters to grind.
---
Fast vaulting out of a locker with the scoops outfit should play that instead of the normal killer notification change my mind
---
Because I don't actually kill the obsession until the very end, as they keep switching. The idea is to get away from tunneling and to cycle through the survivors as the obsession
---
Yessssss
---
He said “few”, not “only”
---
&gt;Bill just leaves the locker pissed.
---
Poor old timer seen some tough shit
---
So survivors should have 0% chance of escaping? Because that's how it usually is.
---
What? Why would someone buy an Xbox for Stranger Things DBD DLC in 2015? I don't even think Stranger Things was a thing back then, and DBD wasn't on Xbox either.
---
They could put VR mode for those who want to play with VR
---
But I doubt this is on the list for the devs to work on and I doubt it'll ever be worth mentioning
---
U have a weird play style, might give it a shot
---
So this Huntress was obsessed with protecting her Ruin because the other 3 Survivors kept swarming to it. She camped the first few hooks and then managed to keep them trading hooks over and over by hooking them nearby to the Totem and camping them. Finally they left the area so I kept her busy around the Totem whilst the others got 3 gens popped. She chased me away and failed to catch me as someone cleansed it and then broke off the chase with me to go for someone else. She finally got me and proceeded to BM and was presumably going to camp me but thankfully the team had some balls.
---
It is important to note, you can only get ONE Activation, you can't stack tokens on it.
---
So if you cleanse, get hurt, ou can heal up that state, then cleans, heal up a state again
---
Same thing had happened with ghostface
---
 I could mean both

***Its a joke***
---
Don't camp or tunnel, there are multiple reasons you shouldn't (unless it's a certain circumstance like the endgame collapse happening). Remember not to get mad if the players in your game are toxic. Remember that as you get higher, players will send you toxic messages, ignore or laugh at them. Don't beat yourself down and practice. Bait pallets as best as you can. Sorry I can't be more helpful because I'm writing this on a tight schedule.
---
I understand that, but I don't get it.
---
Yep! Thank you for the additional info.
---
I sort of understand because Friday the 13th the game exists
---
It doesnt  counter it. It just lets you know they have it
---
I get the feeling honestly, but yeah, make the asshole wait down there with you while the others escape.
---
Pallets can only stun once, lockers can be used unlimited amount of times. Simple but important difference.
---
Look at my newest one
---
My whole idea was to do something weird, so I'm glad you think that. It works best with ghostface because it is easy to find the hook rescuer after a save when you are in stealth
---
Don't tunnel?
---
And it’s a repost! That’s why the text is so shittily cropped at the bottom.
---
Get the scoop on it then
---
This is what the DBD forums/Reddit is for. The shit is just for fun. If you don’t Iike the stuff, downvote it and move on. Would you rather them contribute absolutely nothing to conversations like you do?
---
And a caption yeah. Did your parents drop you as a baby?
---
I mean, yes. A killer can aim to 3gen and use tactics towards that end, but ultimately it’s up to the survivors to fall for it. 
---
Survivors are the ones that complete generators. If they don’t finish all the gens in a pattern that leads to a 3gen situation, they don’t get 3gen’d.
---

Did you get caught, and die because of it? You lost even if it was bullshit

You still get lots of brown and yellow items

Yeah, pretty much.
---
Freddy is a schemer, so he probably isn't all rainbows and sunshine about it, But ya know...it keeps offering up fresh meat to slaughter, though we all know Freddy has more goals than JUST that.
---
As for Demogorgon, I don't know much about it, but what little I understand seems to make sense to me. It's bestial, it eats, but it can be trained like a good puppy.
---
You can kill the obsession ds makes you the obsession
---
We could. I barely play survivor though lol
---
Philip? More like OJOMO
---
I get ya though I'd rather start a new game than waste 180 seconds struggling/watching teammates go down and die instantly. Especially in soloQ.
---
Hm. I must analyze this later. I will find the truth..... damn pigeon...
---
It's not stupid. IT'S EXCLUISVES! If you put time into a game to actually earn an exclusive cosmetic would you like it if somebody hacked to get it?
---
Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
We throw pizza at the killer and play pac man. The trapper is pretty good
---
*The scoops heh... scoops ahoy*
---
I still didn't get. Pls tell me.
---
Ok but Robin for Dbd next
---
Explains why my billy has a shit fit in the lobby every 3 seconds
---
Especially when someone could just do the same exact thing he did minus the watermark
---
How would MYC help with the situation exactly? Its a great perk and i know that, but nevertheless noed just died, at least for some time, dont feel like haunted would help too much either, haunted is nice only if you pair it with another hex perk, like ruin
---
Sure. Why not.
---
Breach is good
---
His perks aren't terribly great.
---
Pharmacy is pretty good if you're using a 'rooting around in the chests' build, or if you lack Self Care. But if you're bringing Pharmacy just to heal yourself, you might as well just run Self Care and be done with it. It also allows you to open chests VERY SLIGHTLY faster.
---
Vigil helps you VERY SLIGHTLY recover from certain status effects when right up against him.
---
Wake Up! Helps you see the gates, helps you VERY SLIGHTLY open them faster, and allows others to see you when nearby.
---
Vigil and Wake Up! are basically trash, is the problem, and Pharmacy isn't much better.
---
It wouldn’t bother me in the least, no
---
Nancy probably has the best perk lineup. She has the generic aura perk which can be as strong as an aura perk can be without breaking balance which is fine. Fixated seems like an amazing tool for beginners, and for more advanced players can allow for easier mind games with the faster walk speed and knowledge of where your trail is. Inner Strength seems good since it seems like you can just cleanse a totem at the start of the match, then when you get injured later on, you have an 8 second self-care ready to go by just jumping into a locker which is strong, but balanced out by the fact that this has 5 uses MAX and only if you're the one cleansing the totem.
---
Steve's perks seem like they're good, but 2 of them have to rely on your team being decent. Camaraderie is nice in theory, but if the other survivors don't capitalize on your longer hook time, then it's essentially useless, in a similar fashion if you're farmed off the hook on your 2nd phase instantly it also won't see much use. Babysitter in theory is a nice concept but you aren't given virtually any benefit at all and just have to hope the person you're saving isn't to potato and that the killer isn't running perks like Make Your Choice or Furtive Chase. Second Wind is cool, but I think it would be better to get 2 uses out of it instead of 1 to make it a tad more useful.
---
Demogorgon's perks are pretty decent, it just depends on how they work with/against certain things. Surge is a neat idea, and while everyone keeps saying it will be cool with PGTW I have no idea how you pull that off with the 40 second cooldown on Surge and the fact that you can't exactly control where you down them. It DOES sound cool if it stacks with Overcharge or Lullaby to regress gens in an area by a large amount, in theory up to 23% on multiple gens if all 3 perks do stack. Cruel Confinement seems like it will either wrongfully screw over survivors without any indication or it will be largely wasted if you aren't even by the completed gen. Mindbreaker sounds like it will only really counter Sprint Burst somewhat, though slowing down the rate at which survivors gain back their exhaustion perks can come in handy throughout a match.
---
You're really taking a joke by a random stranger too seriously.

Just about 20 times but thanks for adding to the number. We almost missed it.

Yeah tapp, bill, laurie, and possibly adam/jane died, but the rest of them 'lived'. Also about the killers the only ones who die in their stories are; the pig, the spirit, and maybe hag/freddy/nurse. Though admittedly 90% of the other stories involve some kind of disappearance, unlike stranger things.
---
It definitely changes, I get loads more Ultra-Rares since I max prestiged
---
so you are complaining without even double checking if your lost your offering?
---
At least then the game could actually be fun instead of constant insults/DCs
---
I'm not taking it at all. Just said I didn't get it and then that it wasn't funny. There is really nothing serious about it.
---
My go to build is Looter/Kobe. Up the Ante, Ace in the Hole, Plunderer’s Instinc and Slippery Meat
---
Imo, if its an exhaustion perk it needs to be instant.
---
If its not an exhaustion perk then increase the cooldown and decrease activation time by 1 or 1.5 seconds.
---
well I dont, neither on Killer nor Survivor. there were countless posts of People showing statistics that it doesnt Change
---
Why are you using leak flair for an announcement?
---
Exactly, you could've said you didnt get it, and left it there, but decided to keep going instead of stopping, hence, taking it too seriously.
---
Yeah...sadly it only gives you 500 bp
---
I dunno man, it’s worked for me, and I haven’t seen any actual data to the contrary, so I’m inclined to believe what I have seen myself
---
Yea but to be honest I'd rather have a community filled with toxic players then a game I could barely play.
---
No, the killer can protect 3 gens right from the beginning of the game and not allow survivors to be able to complete them at any point.
---
I'm a responder. If you reply to reply. They could have left it there as well, but they didn't. Guess they were also taking their joke too seriously.
---
I was being facetious, because that plan is hyperbollically stupid.

---
Excuse you, it's called a full body YEET

can i ask what rank you are? i’m a rank 19 killer (rank 16 survivor, i also play on console). i’ve only played freddy a couple of times. the first i wasn’t good (because i didn’t understand what he could do) but the second time i got a 3k and then one person dc’d. and i really wasn’t that good. i’ve never played freddy before the rework, but i would say that he’s definitely more op than the other killers.
---
well thats just your subjective view. There is no source that States that, apart from some players :D
---
Difference is, the original guy said it was a joke and left it there. Then another guy came and said it was absurd, making it funny, and again, you could've stopped there, but you decided to keep trying to explain why a joke you didnt understand was terrible and made 0 sense, etc.

Same to you tho, I’ve seen no source to back you, you’ve seen no source to back me, we’re trapped in an endless cycle of subjective opinions, we should just fight to the death to settle this
---
It's mostly that he is new and everyone is still learning how to handle his changes
---
Honestly it's same. But that's the problem. It's been the same for ages with community patches being the norm. Devs just dropped the game.
---
What about one for the baby killers?
---
Hes perfectly fine, pleas rank 1 players are tired of the same killers once and again and again.
---
I checked before I posted, but if you want to link the OP I’ll apologize I guess

---
Yeah. When people say they get loads and loads of rare items after they prestige, I think that's just confirmation bias. I've never prestiged anybody and I get insane amounts of rare and ultra rare items in all my bloodwebs.
---
I think the fact that it seems to be so controversial proves my and your suspicions, that prestiging does little to nothing. Just wanted to confirm that. Thanks!
---
Well if survivors are now cleaning totems to get rid of noed. Pair haunted grounds with ruin and then when they break one of the totems its possible to get an insta down. With MYC once you hook someone leave and get the noed like instadown effect. Just some alternative options for noed.
---
Honestly I think it’s fine. I’ve been playing with it fairly often since it came out at rank one and it’s been working out.
---

I don't keep trying to explain anything. I explained once. And after that I just respond to others. As I said I'm a responder. It's not me taking anything seriously it's just me continuing the conversation. That's on you. If you don't want me to reply then don't say anything to me.
---
Top was 8, currently 12
---
I mean... If you’re acting bitchy against the dominant role in an asymmetric game, the one that gets to decide on death, isn’t that kind of warranted? 
---
I know people are gonna be all ‘WELL YOU’RE BAD IF YOU DO IT, YOU’LL DEPIP’ but... It’s still their decision and it’s not one that would affect you unless you BM’d them as well, and it’s an ineffective strategy on top of that.
---
Well I am a survivor main and although I do play some killer I feel as though I wouldn't do them justice enough on my own 
---
Perhaps another (kindhearted) killer main could assist
---
ye, after 800 hours I havent Seen a difference
---
Unfortunately they won’t be the VAs :(
---
But I’m still really excited to play the characters
---
The only time I’ll ever use any of the survivor perks are when I’m going for adepts unfortunately. Red rank killers don’t leave much room for variety :(
---
Well, it WAS best perk
---
I’m sure the change is very minimal, but there’s definitely a slight increase
---
You have yourself a duel good sir
---
Just goes to show how much learning I still have to do. I started playing DbD (on PS4) a couple of months ago but only get a few games in every week or 2. Looking at this I was thinking “Wow those killer perks look amazing” but the majority of comments I’ve seen are saying “They’re alright I guess, nothing major”.
---
Maybe that’s why I lose 80% of my games =(
---
No, I don't care thay youre respond to me continously, I just found it funny that you took a joke too seriously. For real though, you can reply to a comment without trying to explain why you you found a joke unfunny.
---
Again, one more time, I dont care that you responded. I find it hilarious that you took a joke too seriously.
---
&gt;[* Does Natalia Dyer and Joe Keery voice Nancy and Steve?Dave Richard: nope](https://twitter.com/Dat360NoScope/status/1164608525038956547)
---
I think the Killer shack is an interesting gameplay loop. The problem is the way the game is designed (the gen repair time), if the killer spends any sort of extra time on a loop whitout breaking a pallet he is losing the game.
---
I'd be in favor of more interesting loops like this, but either secondary objectives or more repair time
---
The entire HUD needs a rework tbh
---
They would also stack, so the 90 seconds plus 20 seconds from Second Wind would just mean nearly two minutes of No Mither.
---
Again, ultimately it's up to the survivors to complete the other gens and let the 3gen succeed. If they force the 3 generators the Killer is trying to protect, they can break the strategy.
---
If survivors know that the Killer isn't chasing hard and is trying to protect 3gens, they can work together to break the strategy. Of course this is unlikely outside of a SWF group or such, but it can be done.
---
Personally, I run Prove Thyself, which means if the survivors can get 3 people on a gen, it'll be done in 27 seconds. This will very likely break the strategy. With 2 people, it takes 41 seconds.
---
With 2 people working as a group on 2 different generators, the survivors will get one of those 3 generators completed. Particularly if the Killer isn't heavily chasing and punishing by hooking.
---
You are? Can't really tell...😏
---
Oh i thought you meant just to replace noed with either myc or haunted, yeah i guess that would be an all right build
---
Our battle will be glorious!
---
Well I've played a decent amount of killer but probably not the best for giving advice.
---
My guy. 
---
This is beautiful OwO
---
&gt; Tea bagging is a taunt when done to the killer
---
I think it can have a bit different meaning depending on situation.
---
If done at exit gates its "gg ez no re". A way to insult the loser of the match.
---
If done outside of a chase, its usually "Hey you, come try to chase me ;)". Its a challenge.
---
If done DURING a chase, its more like "you suck".
---
Just a tip: If this happens, walk to them and force them to leave so you can get to another match ASAP
---
Precisely.  You see, all you guys need to do is create cosmetics based on what McCote wears, sell them for high price, then have McCote wear something else, sell that that as a cosmetic, etc to basically print your own money.
---
Fuck, I’m surprised we aren’t havin a dart right now
---
And I find it interesting how dense you are.  
---
I didn't even take the joke seriously the first time. I just didn't understand it. I explained why I didn't understand it, and all I got in return was "it's a joke". So I said "I don't get it", and I still don't get it because no one has actually explained how it's supposed to be funny.  
---
But you can keep thinking what you do. It's your life and you're allowed to be wrong.

how do you think it works? It clearly states the effects of the perk (exhaustion in this case) cease after 3 seconds of not repairing.  This is pretty useless for the reason I stated above.  Pair that with the fact it doesnt do shit once the gen is over 50% and it's a perk that will basically do nothing if survivors stop repairing when they hear the heartbeat.

Lol I feel that. I'm in the same boat.

In Certain situations sure tunnel, but when you can clearly see the guy who unhooked you and come straight for me instead that’s just being a dick and a lazy ass. I play killer allot and don’t camp or tunnel and get 4k all day! So I’m done hearing the bs excuses and when ghost face came out every fucking asshole who was playing him tunneled the shit out of people for a week straight! The first night was the worst.... but sure make excuses and keep being assholes to people and especially the new people and they will quit playing this game within a week and spend their money elsewhere because BhVR lets that shit go on.... Ive had several people quit playing after a few days of playing because of the bs toxic shit that goes on...
---
can you buy the dlc for me i’ll paypal you bb
---
Nice!
---
That's the tradeoff, much like small game it only works for a few killers, maybe tack on the totem warning ability to give it a bit more viability.
---
I remember them being a lot slower to set, but it still feels like it takes AGES.
---
Already have $50 loaded let's hit it
---
Found the rank 15.
---
Funny, because I'm pretty sure I never said that you cant take the joke seriously, I'm simply pointing out that you'ee taking it too seriously, and again, I never said you cant feel that way nor did I even try and take it as a negative thing, but hey, as you said, youre allowed to be wrong.
---
So wait, if youre not familar, then how can you even say it's terrible in the first place without understanding it? Kinda narrow minded honestly.
---
Also, calling someone dense is 100% an insult, and if you can't see how, you are simply not a clown, you are the entire circus.
---
DbD developers can pick a hole...They are my daddy now
---
Small Game counters Ruin and NOED, which are fairly universal, as well as all the other hex perks
---
i used to do this bc people would also get mad if i ran around looking for the totem... luckily someone i play with got in a KYF with me as killer, put on ruin and let me practice the ruin skill checks for like an hour. wasnt really a problem for me anymore after that.
---
Poor poor totem perks getting the shaft by inner strength.
---
Wait, so between trials does this game's Ghostface just go back to being a reporter/murderer in our world?
---
Oh, I see.
---
Well, you aren't bad for using any perk. If any perk is mandatory for serious games, it's adrenaline. I always prey everyone has it, or DS against tunnelers.
---
No, this is dead by daylight not a middle school...
---
It’s supposed be a high risk/reward tile. If a survivor messes up they get basement hook. This is the same concept for any large structure like Ironworks, Yamaoka’s Estate, Mother’s Dwelling, etc.
---
This is also a tile which can be mindgamed. If you run it generically than yeah, you’re gonna get looped til’ blocker. But if you moonwalk and double back you’ll have a much higher chance to get a hit or down.
---
The map would be really interesting but unless FNAF releases a new game, the hype is dead so I doubt it would be as exciting as other potential killers they could add.
---
"don't give me resilience?"
---
\-my dumbass before i realized it was hope
---
Sure you were.
---
this game is a little more serious in its design than a chunky cheeses birthday party gone wrong
---
A new game is getting released , got teased by Scott a week ago plus the movie is getting worked on.
---
Lol. So you want a free down and basement hooks for killer?
---
well to a certain degree totally true. although you can say the exact same thing the other way around. also consider, its 4 perks vs 16 so theres that\^\^
---
Not to mention those words are literally just a summary of the upcoming DLC. Like, wow, what an impressive meme.
---
I cannot believe my eyes
---
That sounds really good
---
But it's not the survivors' fault that 3 gens are close together if the killer is literally playing for them from the start of the match. The survivors have to contest them at some point, it doesn't matter whether they are left at the end or any other point, if the killer is already protecting them.
---
I've seen enough Doc games with Overcharge/Unnerving to say that it pretty often results in sheer endless games if the killer actually commits to protecting the generators, dashing out hits, kicking the gens, survivors having to heal all the time, or run early due to being injured. If it's not actually a highly-coordinated SWF experienced in dealing with that situation, the more likely outcome is that the survivors either slowly get grinded down or eventually give up. And it's atrociously boring. The Hag and Trapper version of this are more desirable/less boring, but again, still very hard to crack, also basically impossible for solo randoms, and providing them yet another strong tool for that fortress strategy is not something I find a worthwhile addition to the game. I'd rather Surge be a strong stalling perk that can however not be used to bunker down like that. If it affected instead all generators outside of a certain radius, it would be a decidedly stronger perk than it is now, for general gameplay.
---
As a by the by: Prove Thyself is not really worth running. Some numbers on that: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bw82he/this_video_is_contradicting_what_reddit_has_told/epwrtie/?st=jzokhoma&amp;sh=44ce6e0c

I never said you said I couldn't. Nor did I say you said it was negative. You keep telling me that "I took it too seriously" after I repeated told you I knew it was a joke the whole time that I simply didn't understand. That's you telling me how I think &amp; feel.

Just that are unfunny are terrible. I said I didn't get it and no one explained it so it remains unfunny.  
---
&gt; Also, calling someone dense is 100% an insult, and if you can't see how, you are simply not a clown, you are the entire circus.  
---
That was me trying to be funny. It was bad decision on my part. I like to lighten moods in conversationa, but I should have thought that one through more.
---
I never see Myers anymore. Clown seems rare as well.
---
All I'm saying is killer robots don't sound that wacky when we have a clown dressed as santa and shirtless david
---
Why not both, nurse him back to good health, then torture him until about dead, then nurse him back to health and repeat....
---
correct me if im wrong but the philip/wraith wasnt actually tortured, the entity came to him and presented itself as his god and said that the survivors that he hunts are terrible people who did horrible things and his job is to kill them for their crimes
---
I know SWF would be able to work around mimicry, but it's still going to be creepy as shit to see an un-dwight casually walking your way.
---
Will it be weak against SWF? Sure. There'll still be screams, though.
---
Still quieter than Jeff.
---
to be fair shirtless david isn’t that far off but i get what you’re saying
---
Fuck you and this overusing meme format
---
"Increase your movement speed by 100%" I would like to see a 190% killer chasing me with a Claudette on his shoulder
---
Increase movement speed by 100%? What type of drugs does the entity give to killers now a days? Lol I like the iron grasp idea though
---
#GAMECUCKED
---
Come on be a good sport and sell out the other survivors. They're going to come. They always do.
---
so it has a 35 second uptime basically lol
---
imagine if a swf took this, the killer would be stunlocked the whole game wtf
---
Needing to stop mid-chase (as a 110% killer) for half a second in hopes the survivor walks directly back into your trap they just seen you place is not chase potential. 
---
If you are going on long chases as Hag you are doing it wrong.
---
*laughs in 2017*
---
Well I’m an iPhone loser 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Well people just started to notice that she is pretty good so people started to use her making other people realize she's really good also etc etc, almost to the point of brokenness with prayer beads. She's just really really good
---
I was just going by the website that still shows you can sign up for beta
---
The drawback of a mega 25 seconds stun flashlight is that you cant bring a normal flashlight... yea great drawback. 60 seconds cooldown? so with 2 guys running this you have the killer perma stunned.
---
Use a perk roulette. It randomly picks 4 perks for you and some even do your killer.
---
Sorry I dont speak mexican
---
I don’t understand the 2-3 tokens, kicked generators already have their progress regress as is
---
The rest sound really interesting though
---
and Ash fucking Williams
---
God no. That'd be busted.
---
Legion's got some caffeine pills.
---
Jeff is loud but his grunts are short. Ash's are loud and exaggerated. Both still need Iron Will though.
---
&gt; No, I never said thats how you should feel. It was simply my opinion, which went against your opinion.  
---
That's the issue. You keep thinking how felt and what I was think is an opinion I have. As if I couldn't possible know what is actually going on in my own head that I must make educated guesses. It's not an opinion on my end. How I took it is fact. How it is is the opinion.  
---
&gt; Yeah, we know you dont understand it nor did you find it funny. But how can you call something terrible without fully realizing? Its fair to think its unfunny, but if you dont understand, how can you call it terrible?
---
 That's very fair. I probably shouldn't have worded that way. I still would like to understand it.  
---
&gt; Also, I don't see how calling someone dense is considered funny, but its probably because I don't understand it. Do you jokingly say that to your friends maybe?  
---
I joking insult my friends all the time. One of our favorite things to do it start an argument and keep it going like we are serious until the other starts to get pissed off. It's great. This one time Shawn thought I was so serious. He didn't even believe me when I told him I was fucking with him. Austin had to cut into the conversation and tell hi Mt at I was in an audio chat giving play by play of how I was fucking with him the whole time. It was great.   
---
This may be confusing. If you want to see some of it you could always check our on long hiatus shitty YouTube channel. Some of its hilarious. Specially when we made Shawn rage in Infinite Mini Golf.
---
Gotcha. So maybe, say, a little more than double it. 180 seconds. That sound better?
---
Pharmacy should be buffed where it’s at least a green medkit instead of only a green medkit. That way it could be used with other chest luck perks
---
I got it on my Legion so I guess I'm a Legion main now. Its sooo good. Bubba's got a killer recipe right there.
---
To save you the translation:
---
**White:** killer  
---
**White:** you fucking whore  
---
**Tan:** fucking moron  
---
**Me:** ?  
---
**Green:** fuck you old man  
---
**Tan:** fuck you old  
---
**Green:** fuc your mum dwight
---
They didn't even give me a *chance* to tunnel a camp them. /s
---
Mouse in left hand?
---
go outside and get a life good god
---
Atm I see 4 downvotes but I totally get what you’re saying. On console I get invited to parties occasionally since voice comms are so useful. I think it’d be cool to have a comm system like PUBG where it’s based on distance. Just need to have a vote to mute so there’s no jerks running at teammates yelling “over here!”
---
Survivors couldn't just tap a gen to cancel Regression. They would have to get a skillcheck
---
YES. I would settle for swf receiving a penalty for using that game mode though tbh. Or giving the killer a bonus for going against swf. It can be crazy unbalanced and makes the game unfun. Bleh
---
Oh I see, that makes more sense then, thanks
---
Right now it's only 1 perk per level no matter what?
---
The first token would have to change, because it is powercreep survailence
---
Why does it take so long to find a match? I’m probably gonna derank and see if I find any quicker
---
People is complaining about prayer beads which is a broken add-on
---
Are you serious!? The entity can literally bring mind flayer into its realm and torture it for all eternity
---
*switches bloody party streamers to ebony Mori*
---
Devs refer to the entity as a she since French is a gendered language.
---
If enough people mention it suddenly everyone agrees, and yeah, she is strong but I think it mostly just makes people feel better to complain about something
---
One one hand, fuck you for making me watch a TikTok vid...  
---
On the other hand, this is actually funny and heckin' accurate
---
What do you think of the rest though?
---
If a survivor doesn’t wiggle while you run agitation then the survivors are fucked.
---
I love the pick up, drop, and hook speed buffs for Agitation, but that movement speed buff is INSANE. Mad Grit, Iron Grasp, Agitation combo just got way too OP.
---
If I do bust out Hag, you can bet I have at least one of the setting speed add-ons.
---
Is inner strength active after cleansing any totem or only a lit totem?
---
Buy those perks and it will increase your chances for the next level. Just don't buy any teachables that you don't want.
---
Wait, so what you're saying is, me thinking you took a joke seriously offends you? Also, you can still accidentally take a joke too seriously, I used to do it many times, before I started taking nothing seriously, which is probably worse, but uh, you know, thats a discussion for another time. 
---
Also, theres always the fact that you could be lying or backpedaling, which is something alot of people on the internet do to save face, like, r/quityourbullshit or r/thathappened.
---
Also, that does sound hilarious, ngl. I know my friends call me an idiot ~~even though I'm the smarter one~~
---
It is probably because there isn’t that much player and the lower you get, the longer the matchmaking will last. Since there isn’t that much player the queue will be pretty long
---
Yes and no.
---
This version of AGI means that you waste almost no time transporting bodies, but it does absolutely nothing for your carry distance, unlike the current version.
---
Yeah I'm playing around with them, while these are good on high mobility killers I struggle to get use out of them with normal or slow killers. And they're not really a substitute for ruin. Without ruin you're gonna have gens popping within the first down. That alone will end up hurting you too much. At least that's my experience. Have you had more luck on your end?
---
And keep the stupid us vs them mentality going yeah that's a great idea
---
Lmao git gud
---
I was thinking about it more after I saw this post
---
Now, I'm not really a fan of VR gameplay and I don't care for it
---
But VR gameplay could work in the Killer's favor
---
As for survivor gp - not so much
---
No, it’s made to laugh at entitled idiots
---
I remember a game I head where this baby Dwight was continuously trying to repair this gen when Ruin was right in front the haystack on the other side. So cue me injuring and sometimes slugging this poor Dwight so he’d go away as I didn’t want to kill him when I was trying to protect my Ruin totem which the others wanted so badly. Yellow or green rank don’t remember. Fucking hilarious downing this guy in like 7 seconds and then leaving and he’d be right back at the gen
---
&gt; As a general rule the issue for killers isn't finding people.
---
Finding people and establishing yourself at the start of a match are two different things. Killers can lose a lot of momentum and time for literally no reason when a match begins. 
---
I play red at both and almost never have much trouble downing survivors playing as most killers.
---
Honestly feels like it’d be a good character addition to David’s backstory like dead hard after being used causes oblivious?
---
They were standing at the each of the gate dude they would have fallen over the escape line
---
RIP  cat
---
All this plus the bloodweb changes, and the archive coming next, this is a good time for dbd.
---
You are addressing a second issue with dbd, which is killer the balance.
---
If someone told me "gen speed is fine, look at match result when a top tier red rank nurse plays with omega blink", i'd have to agree.
---
Gen speed seems to be balanced around top tier nurse and spirits. But those 2 killers are super boring to play against. And the others are not competitive enough.
---
Best solution is to nerf nurse/spirit, but also add a secondary objective in addition to generators.
---
It’s fine. According to the last set of stats, survival rate between ranks 10-2 was between 50-60% (rank 1 was only 43%). Note that this included the usable and strong version MoM and also did NOT include EGC. It is safe to assume now that kill rates are well up across the board since these stats were taken, that’s a no brainer due to EGC alone since it’s killer sided. What am I getting at? I believe killers overall are doing fine with the current speed. So if you were to slow gens down (or add an objective), then you have to slow the kills down as well. The game is supposed to be balanced around 2K. 
---
I also saw a dev post very recently that at rank 1, the worst killer on the worst map had something like a 54% kill rate. This was excluding DCs.
---
Old freddy*
---
These 2 are worse than ruins.
---
Yes, I agree. We should not blindly focus on the gens themselves but objectives in general (gens are the only objectives currently but you know what I mean). A few comments and myself have suggested secondary objectives, which could help in the dilemma you're describing. That will be really hard to design though.
---
The best way to help them is by killing them and showing no mercy, better to destroy their spirits right away.
---
By literally creating a sub Reddit so one side can shit on the other, reeeeally good idea man make a fucking breeding ground for the toxicity
---
Yeah, but it's 2 levels, so that thinking is flawed.  Is a double decker bus the same size as a regular bus?
---
You won't need to worry about the carry distance if you can get a hit with Mad Grit, not to mention how you can abuse the speed to easily knock someone else down.
---
I noticed this happens so frequently that I grab perks so they won’t show up again on the blood web. If you get a purple 3 always grab it.
---
It’s different between consoles and pc. On console there is no clown nurse or plague while pc has way more nurses but clown and plague I’d still say is about the same
---
Seems about right
---
There is always a way to force that pallet down, you just have to make the right moves. It takes a lot of experience to know what to do, but you will get there. 
---
Once that pallet is down its an unsafe window loop.
---
Watch people play. Don't watch Tru3, He's an idiot. Otzavarda is probably one of the best killers in the game. Also make sure to watch/play survivor to try and think like them.
---
You play at red ranks and you have a lot of issues finding survivors?
---
Head on, Quick and Quiet, D Strike, and Inner Strength is gonna be my designated meme build. Can’t wait
---
Oh and also don't listen to all the people who say tunneling is bad. If there is only one good person on a team, just kill them first and get an ez gg
---
I actually wouldn’t mind this I actually really like the series but I know many people hate the fandom including me. So yes I would love it but the fandom would kill it
---
itd be a 215-210 killer. would be way faster than even sprint boost
---
You’re being downvoted because you’re right lol.  A determined killer can easily ruin a single players entire game.
---
Absolute quality. Just forwarded this to a friend I have been spamming with hype for this chapter.
---
IT'CHA BOI FROM SCOOPS AHOY
---
They wish to rejoin the entity why must you taunt them so?
---
UwU OJOMO best bing bong boi!
---
Well the dude you responded to said survivors could take turns getting hooked and procing camaraderie and you seemed to disagree saying you could only pop camaraderie once which kind of made it confusing
---
I think we're having a communicative issue here - I have no issue finding survivors. I rarely even use BBQ anymore. I'm talking about how much gen progress can get done at the start of a match as the killer traverses the map. It isn't about difficulty finding a survivor, it's about how much time it takes.
---
These are different things
---
Honestly I have gotten a couple GG's but they always come after I lose so I don't know if they are trying to say good game or get good lol.
---
OMG FRAKENFURTER
---
Too bad iron maiden is a shit perk, they should HONESTLY buff iron maiden this chapter, would spice things up a lot
---
People who didn't use NoED aren't getting hurt much more than they already were. Most hexes just aren't worth a perk slot already. Ruin was one of the few exceptions because killers are just that desperate to slow the game down.
---
&gt; The game is supposed to be balanced around 2K. 
---
You are right, it is supposed to be and the devs said that themselves but it simply is not. I think I VERY rarely end up with a pip when I only get 2 kills. \~50% killrate sounds fine, but it is not with the current reward systems. It probably needs to end up at \~75%, since survivors can pip/win even when killed. So pipping is the goal, not escaping, right?
---
The demogorgon isn't technically an alien
---
Damn it, Steve has barley even entered the Entity’s Realm, and Quentin’s already got him addicted.
---
Ah yes, truly an insightful comment.
---
Why did I never think of this before?
---
*Gasp*
---
It’s better if you suicide on the hook, won’t get banned that way
---
You're the type of survivor who chases the killer while that killer chases a different survivor arent you?
---
But how does one exit before entering
---
I just wanted to see if this conversation would be worth my time. As I expect, its not.

---
The Trapdoor can be heard by the survivor with Wake Up but not the Killer
---
Within 24 hours I guarantee this will be the highest selling cosmetic of all time.
---
I don't think that's why I'm being downvoted. I think people are perceiving me as being salty about losing a chase.
---
Well yes I do like the camera and it makes sense with the dbd ghostface but I think the would've been cool if it was only shown on certain cosmetics when he moris someone
---
Except iron maiden doesn't counter shit, it's a garbage worthless perk
---
You forgot about Bubbas and Ghostfaces
---
AHOY LADIES!
---
The floor is a solid object 💅
---
Nothing is confirmed for Hallowed Blight yet. They *did* say they're focusing on the game's problems right now, but I will be surprised if they miss a Halloween event, more surprised than I was for Summer's lack of event.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love supernatural. BUUUUTTT, I don’t think Sam and Dean would be great for the game. Maybe if you made The killer be mark of Cain Dean and Sam be a survivor, but even then it doesn’t fit the show very well. The problem is that they both fight monsters, so having them be mostly powerless would not fit them well
---
What happened here
---
See, now I really want a parody of that
---
AHOY LADIES!!
---
"Why the hell would they offer a bundle for the game?"  
---
"Yeah, if they're smart they'll offer a bundle for the game".  
---
What?
---
That’s an issue with the pipping system then. The solution to that isn’t to slow down survivors to the point where killer is getting 3-4K constantly. You think people would keep playing survivor if all they do is die, just cause they can still pip? Nope. Sure some view a pip as a win, but by and large most still tend to base it off escapes and kills. The 2K mark should always be the goal for balance.
---
I disagree, at least in Season 1 he is one of my favourite characters. But they haven't really done that much with him in season 2 and 3. Maybe he will be more important in the next season.
---
I wish there was a way to tell what rank they are. My entire lobby were Level 7-10 and the game decided to put us against a 20. We probably ruined his whole experience.
---
We would've been gentler if we'd known his rank ahead of time.
---
yeah in retrospect the numbers might have needed a little adjusting, lol. My point was more trying to create a cool concept than a perfectly balanced killer. Thanks for the feedback though!
---
Demogorgon, yeah. Ghostface, no.
---
Despite Ghost pulling from abilities already existing in Amanda and Miguel, his play style is very different than them both
---
They also did that with Freddy for his rework which was just clowns slowing effect,doctors fake pallets and hags teleporting. They seem to be in a rehash phase
---
It’s not that it’s ineffective it’s that it’s not as OP as other exhaustion perks so people automatically toss it onto the fire that is “not meta” without a second thought it’s very useful in tight situations while being a risk to run. I think people say it’s worthless since it’s basically removing a perk slot for just Incase situations that most “experienced survivor mains” refuse to acknowledge as potential threats
---
Hey same
---
Shut up and take my money!
---
What do you think its powers should've been then
---
She’d make a killer Zoey dude!
---
Whilst I agree wholeheartedly on the Babysitter thing, no killer will ever use Furtive chase. Make your choice though is a hard counter
---
I’m actually curious, what makes you think that?
---
Yes it does when you consider there are 13 DLC each priced 5$+
---
&gt; The solution to that isn’t to slow down survivors to the point where killer is getting 3-4K constantly.
---
I suspect that the current stats would show that most killers across all ranks average 3 kills now. Survivor has gotten less healthy since the provided stats were given to us
---
Have you ever seen cloudy with a chance of meatballs?
---
Finding it hard to get matches at the moment.
---
Yeah they had so much potential to make this killer really unique, just kinda bummed out they made him into a pig/hag
---
Ugh Im really gonna need to spend money on the chapter, Scoops Ahoy Steve, and this. I’m gonna legit be broke.
---
Those 2 together would just spank any Killer that came their way. Don't even need David.
---
I hate Cornfield as Myers u can always see the survivors but u can’t stalk them because the corn “blocks” ur vision.
---
I did a kyf 1v1 it’s my friend playing as Kate while I played as nurse, told her to say pass every time I passed her, we went for 10 minutes and then she left through the hatch
---
Remember, kids, be a Funtress not a C\*ntress.
---
Season 1 Jonathan was a very flat actor to me anyways. It was all, “no crazy mom no :(!” Or him just being a creep.
---
Did you read the perk?
---
It doubles your speed, but halves your time.
---
Therefore... **net zero distance change**
---
Better than camping
---
Considering the last event was taken up by the three year anniversary I’d be surprised if there was no Halloween event while they’re focused on fixing the game I doubt they’d let such an important time in the horror genre just slip pst
---
Many survivors models are based on real people, including Dwight, but they have confirmed that his model wasn't actually mcote, it was a friend of the office who doesn't actually work there. Somewhere out there is a Mcote doppelganger that somehow looks even more like Dwight.
---
Now megs can walk even more with the new Nancy perk!
---
David is the anchor for those old men
---
Sometimes you gotta run Waterlogged Shoe and Scarred Hand on Hag and just Enduring Spirit Fury some pallets.
---
What's the put down of being called a neckbeard?
---
If Michael Myers asked me to match you bet your ass I’d hit it
---
My cat loves watching the cursor too.
---
This happens which most games, people jump to say “they’re just a mix of other characters.” It’s easy to say their abilities are recycled, but not every ability can be perfectly unique, as long as there is a spin it’s fine.
---
M1 Doc is big brain time. But not big BP time
---
While I don’t play doctor too much myself I love this comic and agree with your sentiment, I love ghost face even if people around me say to play Myers the better ghost face. I play ghost face cause I love him so I’ll continue to do that.
---
Honestly I think the solution that will yield the best balance is the one they're going with so far: a slow, deliberate rework of all the bad killers out there while they balance it with releasing new content. It just depends if the community is patient enough to stick with the game through the changes. I don't think every rework needs to be as drastic as new Freddy. Like, if you made the Doctor's shock therapy range equal to the range when he uses the brown addon, he would be perfectly fine. But as is, you can't use his default power at like 75% of loops because it is just a hair too short.
---
Nah survivors are the victims, killer perks OP pls nerf, we can’t have the killer, the dominant figure, being able to counter survivors builds, of which there are four, can we? /s
---
stayed rank 1 killer and surv since 2016 with 4500 hours but sure,i bet you know exactly what you are talking about
---
It can try. Until the mind flayer infects it and kills it from the inside.
---
Not sure about the teleporting yet but the lunge seems bad, you can dodge that very easily if Demo really just runs in a straight line during it.
---
No! Everyone DC's, make it so killer doesn't know and then if they lose they have to deal with that truth in post game chat where they find out :PPPP
---
(Funnier if you all play mad hard and DC right at exit gates so it looks like bots)
---
Unless entity stabs it all over  as soon as it starts to infect
---
When you don’t have an income an $8 DLC plus a presumably expensive skin is a lot lol.
---
Again, the pipping argument is an issue with the emblem system, the solution isn’t change the game to give the killer a ton more kills.
---
I don’t have that exact  number but like I said,....worst killer/worst map - 54% kill rate at rank 1.
---
Whem you turn around to the killer and dont dead hard
---
If self-caring or doing gen while injured is the deciding factor for my team, then they ain't doing shit anyway
---
As people have said it’s less that the speed is totally the issue (though I agree a 3-5% speed change would be nice) but that there’s nothing else for survivors to do we need a objective past gens
---
Then I trade my bumper billy add ons for primer bulbs, thomson's mixes, tuning guides, etc.
---
The green medkit is better than the purple one.
---
I'm gonna be trying to switch to PC, is the matchmaking better over there&gt;
---
Had a few like this too. People will convince themselves that they're always in the right. I dont know why or how they think this, but I sure would like to know.
---
Yep. Turn your messages off.
---
That’s just fucked up dude
---
Nope.
---
Base carry speed is 3.68 m/s.
---
Double that is 7.36 m/s.
---
Without AGI, you carry at 3.68 m/s for 16 seconds. 58.9 meters.
---
With AGI, you carry at 7.36 m/s for 8 seconds. Still 58.9 meters.
---
Hello ladies and gentlemen, I am The KING.....
---
to slow down the game :)  *just a little bit*  :)
---
There will be a Halloween event. They skipped the Summer event and only did a lackluster one for the anniversary so they could work on the major Sept. patch
---
Yes this happens on the ps4 many times I have seen it with my friends.
---
problem is i don’t think he’ll play differently. judging by gameplay it is placing traps on the gens, checking gens and the. during chase lunging like piggy. seems like a piggy freddy thing to me
---
This would be great
---
okay. well, no one can possibly know that yet.
---
Dumbass??? Wards are for not losing items... Use intended game mechanics not bugs ffs.
---
This is Xbox
---
He got 22k bloodpoints how is he a noob?
---
Thanks for the Tip
---
I'm running the perk regularly now, i have no issues with any of the points you listed.
---
1. The stun is long enough to get to a safe loop/pallet/window etc.
---
2. Plan ahead. Know when you have enough distance to pull it off mid chase. I personally like to pallet stun, then let the killer see me go into a locker and then stun em and go to the next loop.
---
3. I see no issue with the perk causing Exhaustion.

He was planning to have his buddy D-strike me and they both escape through the hatch with the key but I Mori'd him instead. Then he wanted to have me hit him twice while teabagging and re-open the hatch with his key after falling ontop of it, but I managed to grab him beforehand.

Oh no, a perk that really counters only one killer is countering that one killer, we better destroy it alongside Iron Will and Calm Spirit.

Lets be honest: OoO is not a problem, there is NO Stealth Killer (Besides Ghostface) who is Damaged by this, since the only one who could of beind damaged by this was Michael builds recurring to EW1, but those builds already are undetectable by Aura-Reading. Its not a problem of the Perk, is a problem of the way Ghostface works. You dont even need OoO to make a Ghostface misserable with the way they decided to make him lose his power.
---
They do? I highly doubt it.
---
Yet you try to be. Giving "advices" when you know jack shit. About myers and ghostface similarities, ofc theyre similar, cause that's what they do, stalk ppl, have you even watched halloweens or screams?
---
But hope is dope.
---
This dude was probably surprised when the next day the outfit was announced xD
---
Again? Seriously?
---
Too bad Demogorgon is going to be C tier at most
---
This will be my build (spine chill/lightweight/Fixated/Exhaustion [BL/DH])
---
The consequence is them wasting their time I guess. 
---
I have been playing the game actually basically all day cus I'm on that bp grind.
---
Sadly there isn't going to be a buff. I think its a little joke based on a scene from Stranger Things where the Demogorgon was hit with a slingshot/rock.
---
Ghostface is that cause he stalked ppl really in the movies, can't really change that in licensed killers.
---
I was mostly referencing the new skin really, with the hat on Thanos
---
And does this work only once? Like DS, or does it reset?
---
Uh since i was low level i just used distressing and overcharge. The survivors 3 gen’d themselves and i managed to get em
---
Every single time. Fuck your BBQ stack, fuck your kill points, and fuck you too. :)
---
Then lets hope is strong enough to make people see searching for totems as something usefull without the Perk too
---
lol this happened to me 2 nights ago. Opening the exit gate vs Billy and not really paying attention since I thought he was chasing the obsession. Right as I get it open he just crashes into the wall right next to me with his chainsaw and scares the living shit outta me. Apparently he lagged right as he was doing the final little curve and missed it but damn it was funny.
---
Well what about the man ash
---
Pharmacy's strength is that you can run med builds without having to commit to it in essence given that you won't have to bring a med pack or find one randomly:  You'll just GET one which is why it's good.  Even just med packs on their own with no extras are exceptionally powerful and you are right:  It ain't a great replacement for Self Care but it's a good perk in general and I run it instead of one of the meta perks \[I believe it's Pharmacy, DeadHard / Lithe then Borrowed Time with a random extra perk.\]
---
And you’re wasting your time that you could obviously be using to grind more of those blood points you care so much about lmao. Either way, I don’t even play this game anymore. Imma just unsubscribe from this sub and move on 😂
---
I do my best to try to give newbies a helpful push. If they're absolutely failing during the game, I gradually let off on pressure, giving them some breathing room, and let them win some chases, because even though this game isn't scary for me anymore, I remember that it once was. 
---
I don't let them escape, more I just go after bigger targets, and get to them eventually if it comes to that.
---
 I never said you should DC screwing your team over. I said you should dc that way to keep items when you're dead on hook anyways. I'm rocking purple flashlights every match now
---
What if Matieu was a killer and the fanbase was a survivor.
---
Sad Carson is the best meme of all time

---
Haha I am on my phone and the video would not load. That makes way more sense than an actual buff!
---
That movement speed is 100% compensation for having a power that wastes valuable time. You're forced to stop mid chase, look down (now you're an easy target for flashlight then urban away) and to waste time to maybe deny a loop so you can keep up while your ass gets ran to a different pallet/t wall instead.
---
Aren't they all basically the same?  My understanding what that the only major differences in items are so minor but it's largely the attachments and not them by themselves.
---
Then again I may be thinking of Toolboxes where the only difference is how long they last, not how fast they go.
---
I don’t think you can even use a key while in the dying state
---
Correct me if i’m wrong, though
---
Yeah it's not *that* strong.
---
Even if the killer is fast as fuck, they aren't some unstoppable god.
---
* They can't lunge.
---
* They can't break pallets.
---
* They can't vault.
---
* They *definitely* can't get stunned.
---
* They don't have enough time to run you around since they've only got 8 seconds.
---
Find a pallet or window and this shit ain't working.
---
The big weakness of this version of AGI is bodyblocking; hit one guy and you spend a massive portion of your carry time in an attack CD. 
---
You **need** mad grit to make this work, but even then the CD pause is only 4 seconds, and you're gonna spend half of that in attack CD. It's pretty strong when it works (as it should be, you're wasting half your perk slots on a meme) but it's still not broken.
---
I wasn’t. I can see why they don’t just base it off kills though, btw 2 kills would be a tie based off that system anyway though (2K is currently viewed as a tie, also). You would need 3-4 to be considered having won. But that aside, I definitely think killers should be able to pip more with 2 kills, assuming they get a lot of hooks and stuff. There’s definitely a difference between that and someone who just camps with NOED and winds up with 2K. That person definitely shouldn’t pip lol. I really don’t know what they should change about him, I’m definitely not an authority on the emblem system.
---
People who face camp for me just have parental settings on so u can’t message them
---
True, but OoO doesn't help his case. Considering I doubt Ghostface will *ever* get a rework within the next year, he's probably stuck like this for a very long time. And what do you mean doesn't affect any other stealth Killer? Isn't the whole point of a stealth killer's power is being stealthy and not being noticed? OoO kinda ruins that for them right now if you haven't noticed. And Calm Spirit and Iron Will are fine because they help negate the effects of Doctor and Spirit's powers, OoO straight up just nullifies any chance any stealth killer that's not Pig's chances of winning a game.
---
Because all the good Hag players admit and say that you can in fact use traps mid chase
---
I once ran into a meyers with perma-tier3, Make Your Choice, NOED and Devour Hope. I don't know much about this person but I know they REALLY want to instadown
---
nope, that's a fact...
---
You can. Luckily he fell to the side so I grabbed him.
---
Not wasting my time when getting lobby's as killer takes 10 years. Just browsing reddit as I wait. And good for you I guess? 🤡👍
---
Lmao i was waiting for this comment
---
Met a guy who camped the whole time as Ghostface, he was only rank 19 after the game so I figured he was new to the scene and didn't really know how the game flows. I asked if he was a new player, hoping to drop some killer main wisdom, and the guy says he's had the game for about a year. I say, "Well then you aught to know that camping is a waste of time by now," and he says "Oh, it's a strategy," and leaves. No wonder he's still rank 19.
---
You will screw the killer over still. And you go around yelling ppl about bugs.
---
To be fair, Jim French more or less full retired in January of 2017 and Bill dropped in March of 2017. I have a feeling he wasn't available for Bill's voicelines.
---
They could have done better for sure though.

---
rancor is a mori that you get to use on your obsession. ds is a perk that makes you the obsession. can you put two and two together or do you need me to explain that for you too
---
Wtf is bleen?
---
You had me at New Doc Skin. All around, nicccce.
---
Well if the game goes by too fast you actually dont get the most outta the match
---
Just cuz a killer can go from one point to another doesn’t make them a hag clone, and a short increased lunge that has to charge is different from the pigs ambush out of stealth ability. One part of something being similar is not a lazy copy.
---
I don't know where you're getting these numbers.
---
It's +100%.
---
If you correctly interpret that as "double speed", you get a 184% killer.
---
Even if you go by Reddit's dumbass convention of using % as its own unit of measure, you only get 192%.
---
Nice job dude
---
Opinion time, but I don’t really like pinhead. I know that he has cool lore, but visually he doesn’t spark that much interest. It’s just a demon with pins in his head. If he gets in DBD then cool, but if not then ok. I have not watched Hellraiser, but I have heard about it, but personally he just isn’t as interesting as other creatures that I would love too see, like Chucky or the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers.
---
You can try the Houdinni build, Lithe + Quick and Quiet + Dance With Me, is usefull to stop being chassed on the right maps (Ones without too much open espaces between Hiding Spots)
---
You can also try this one: I call it the Kitty Kenma  
---
Spine Chill - Use it to know where the killer is looking at.  
---
Urban Evasion - When Spine Chill gives a warning, croach towards a safe place  
---
Sprint Burst - While urbaning around the killer, use Sprint BUrst as a Safe Way to disengage if he sees you and start the loop process.  
---
Free Choice - Use any other perk you want, I use Distortion for the name of the build :b
---
The way you use this is to: Use Sprint BUrst to run between objectives; make faster unhooks, rapidly go to another Gen, etc. then, when the killer is near (And you get the Spine Chill notif) you croach by the area until it is safe, loosing the Exhaustion if you have it. If you ARENT exhausted, you can take more risky plays, by sneaking closer to the Killer and to get to the Gen immediatly as the Killer leaves, as you can just Sprint Burst if he was just Faking the leave or decided to come back.  
---
In chases, you want to use a good loop that guides you towards a zone FULL of hiding spots, and use Urban Evasion to escape from the Chase and confuse the killer.
---
When the gate goes 🔴🔴⚫️ and you hear a chainsaw getting closer.
---
Who is Steve?
---
I mean it's kinda that hags whole thing which is teleportation making it really really similar and the only difference from the lunge is he doesn't need to enter stealth but he can't change direction with it. I just want something very stand out. I don't hate they reused some parts of each abilities but this is the 3rd time in a row and I wouldn't mind a unique killer ability soon
---
Yup, now they're off to make a buggy predator game.
---
It is. Had someone Wiggle out from outside the killer shack on the way to the shack basement. No blocks, and no gettin stuck on anything.
---
Alright cool
---
Not movie Ghostface but ok.
---
115%+100%=215%
---
you’re not the sharpest are you
---
Glad we're getting another viable gen regression perk aside from Ruin and PGTW.  Not sure why they put slashes on numbers that don't change though.
---
True, the only thing I can think of off the top of my head would be counting the amount of hooks, not the amount of kills or hookstages.
---
Looks like corrupt intervention will be the new alternative to Ruin once this DLC comes out. Survivors can't do much against 2 full minutes of 3 gens being blocked by the entity
---
Nope, it's still kinda meh.
---
Mad Grit would mean that AGI is no longer hard countered by bodyblocking.
---
IG would do the exact same thing it normally does, it just does it more rapidly and is easier to counter via bodyblocks.
---
If you're using AGI to take a body to a hook in a short amount of time, this version is great. Chasing people down with a Dwight on your back is still just a pure meme.
---
Funny meme but it can be funnier if you didnt make the word hope a perk icon
---
Well done! Keep at it

Yes and if a Nea bodyblocks you into a corner until crows attract Bubba you're both dead.
---
Balancing around people intentionally losing is pointless.
---
iron maiden counters quick and quiet
---
They changed it due to the time period he was written in. The camera made more sense so they changed it
---
I was being sarcastic but ok
---
Thinking about it and instead of just secondary objectives that are there every game what about killer specific objectives? Like the pig traps and new Freddie's clocks but more involved. Newer killers should come with something like this built in. Idk what exactly they could do though
---
I said try
---
Ah okay, I understand. Thank you very much for explaining!
---
Well I'm a console player and I have almost every character maxed out. The reason why the ruin can be tough is due to fps issues. I'm currently rank 5 but I've hit rank 1 many times before.
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Gotta get quick and quiet so those ass cheeks don't clap against the sill.
---
The purple one has more charges and easier skill checks but the green one heals other people much faster Im pretty sure.
---
Well I play pig so reverse bear traps slow the game a lot. I can't compare it to your situation
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect
---
The killer moves at 3.68 m/s, or 92%, while carrying a body.
---
Maybe look at the wiki before calling somebody else an idiot?
---
**Dunning–Kruger effect**
---
In the field of psychology, the Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. It is related to the cognitive bias of  illusory superiority and comes from the inability of people to recognize their lack of ability.

---
This is a really good and interesting suggestion! We should keep that one in mind if we ever actually get the chance to suggest changes.

They do... it's an exploit. You know you are doing something that you should not do. So yes they ban people for it.
---
Part of a fun, casual SWF/KYF group on Discord that plays DBD on PC a few nights a week. My Steam profile (US, EST): "I'm Baby" with a picture of Nea on a generator.

---
You are definitely underselling Mindbreaker. It prevents recovery so it helps counter the current meta that uses DH/Adrenaline and just just stays injured rushing the gens with a current reliance on DH to make extra loops. however in order to get a fresh DH they now have to wait 40s of not running, and not doing gens. It could suddenly become meta to use SC &amp; alternatives again as  you're no longer completely wasting time, you are getting both your health state (32s) and exhaustion perk (40s) back.
---
Why would people assume it comes with the game? It's DLC...
---
Don\*t know why you got Downvoted, but the Killer had me on Death Hook and that house had the basement so i was screwed either way lol
---
Make it happen!
---
In all seriousness, I'd love to see these two in game, but they'd have to be voiced by them and we need some lines.. that'd complete it.
---
I just billy sprint everywhere and hope for the best lol
---
Have an out of suit Isaac Clarke as a survivor
---
That would be so sick.
---
\*Happy Hag noises\*
---
I would literally put on a mask and murder someone if it gave Legion the buff they deserve
---
I agree. As a baby survivor I was frustrated and about to call it quits when the next match the killer gave me the hatch. It was an awesome feeling. Persuaded me to stay.
---
HENDERSON!!!!!
---
&gt;Pennywise is not a normal monster. It is a literal god that can morph into anything and do pretty much anything it wants.
---
So can Freddy. He was able to possess Jesse in his second movie and he took on other forms. Pennywise is also, I will specificy, NOT A GOD. Stephen King specified that Pennywise is an ancient, cosmic being. In other words, Pennywise is an alien (and I hear ppl all the time begging for Alien to get added). 
---
&gt;Just like "it", the entity is a literal god. A god that has the power to travel through space and time to pick and choose survivors to suck their hope out of, and killers to do the dirty work so the entity doesn't have to. Along with many other abilities.
---
Again, Pennywise isn't a god. It is a cosmic being more akin to an alien. And as I specified earlier just bc Pennywise is considered an Entity and the name of the dark God that runs the DBD universe is called the Entity does not mean an Entity is equivalent to a god. The definition of an entity is a being with significant independence. By that token, literally every killer in the roster is an Entity, especially the ones like Myers and Freddy. 
---
&gt;The entity wants killers it can manipulate easily to do its bidding, not gods like "it" that would never take the deal even after centuries of torture.
---
U sure about that? Bc Myers doesn't seem like the kind of dude to take orders from someone. Neither is Freddy.
---
Hags then is teleportaion in a smaller area to control it. Freddy had map wide mobility to where survivors are with a bit of mindgame. Demigoron has map wide molbity whereever he wants and as often as he wants with some stall/tracking depending on the numbers. They arent alike at all. 
---
Ghostface wasnt a copy either, no other killer has bascally pemra TR removal and leaning. Freddy was unquie too as he still had the sleep system
---
Who do you play, and at what rank are you at? I can help give a few pointers!
---
I still died dude, I was just having fun
---
Is this from Life is Strange? Pass. That game was garbage and a rip off of a great novel
---
So then they have to rebuild every map with the upside down as the upside is littrely a copy of the world just differtent, which is alot of work. Also, the Demigoron itself isnt the one that can do much with the upside down, its just a mindless hunter that has infunce with another enity in the show.
---
:/
---
Oh yea because his Lunge works just like Pigs right?
---
That's not true. Imagine a killer that could genuinely instill fear in Surviviors and use that to grow stronger not just from a psychological standpoint, but a gameplay one as well. 
---
Now because he has SO MANY abilities it'd be hard to pin down a power but I have faith that they might add him even if we already have clown (after all, we do have 2 chainsaw killers.)
---
Quality, I like it!
---
Clown I'm like 70% positive is loosely based on John Wayne Gacy.
---
Agree to disagree! I think 184% MS would be overwhelming and has the potential to be OP combined with other perks. It wouldn't be the first time players use two or more slots to make a deadly combo.
---
I'm rarely killer, but yesterday I was playing killer and I grabbed the last guy off the door. After I hooked him I noticed the door was open. He had to have finished it JUST as a grabbed him.
---
He probably hated me so much.
---
They're making changes to ranks and ranking leaderboards, this was announced roughly a little over 1 month ago. I think they're going to be changing it up so that rank means more than what it does now.
---
Also, taking off rank is self-defeating in itself. People want goals, they want something to play for. If its only for fun, the game will feel very repetitive more so than if rank was just there. The game, in itself, is repetitive, but ranking up helps you forget about that and extends the shelf-life of the game.
---
I'd quit the game if that would ever becomes a thing AND we couldn't turn it off.
---
Not happening, not with this community, probably not with any tbh.
---
I love this new chapter but I’m also still really pressed BHVR couldn’t get the licensing for Sidney Prescott as a survivor
---
no, it’s just ctrl+c
---
You got the job!
---
And at the same time, fucking tiny. They always feel bigger/smaller than they are depending on which side ur playing
---
Still has to be humanoid, that was always the rule. Necromorphs have abnormal limb placements and numbers.
---
Yup they do
---
Dont you "enter" any given doorway? You exit the building/area, but you're technically entering the doorway. Then subsequently exit the doorway. So, both?
---
after charging it up you lunge forward? yeah sounds pretty right
---
That's why ghostface is garbage. But what you should do is 99% their exposed bar and then fully stalk when close, giving them no chance to run
---
Yes I know how the power works (although I heard the teleport itself is as fast as Nurse once you start traveling). 
---
However it is completely incorrect to ignore the majority of his kit and just focus on "oh hes got a conditionally better lunge as his only power".
---
That one is an easy nerf. Remove the silence and replace it with "reduces audio range for phasing sound by X"
---
I feel like if they did that people would lose their minds and complain even more. Can you imagine a normally rank 1 swf going against a person who is playing their first match as killer? Or vice versa for survivor? Like cmon.
---
LMAOOOOOOO
---
Stalk without them knowing and then come outta now where and BAM
---
-breaks noed- “Ha!” -t3 jingle- “Ah!”
---
Yea cause Pig can just willy nilly charge her attack without being slowed right? It has an AoE attack too right?
---
Then its pointless to even exist
---
Nope, there is an extreme difference in skills between the different ranks. Are you suggesting all players are in a single "pool"? (meaning that a current rank 1 could get matched with a current rank 20)
---
The entity took the kids
---
That’s why I chose the female slasher necromorph which didn’t have extra arms there’s a yt channel that describes the biology and how it could mutate in this extent in reality I just thought it would be neat since it isn’t to far off from the killer format.
---
I don't know.  I don't find anything fun about the rank system.
---
The fun isn't in a meaningless number at the top.  And IMO harboring a competitive nature to a game where people live and die is part of the problem of why the community can be toxic as it is.
---
Allowing the game to just be a slasher based madhouse? That might even make people give less shits about ''This killer did that to me!" ''This survivor did this!"
---
People give too much care to their rank and it leans into that whole whine fest tug of war we see constantly between killers and survivor.
---
Take it away and just let it be a madhouse? I guarantee. Some problems will elevate and people will just see the game as something fun to play IMO.
---
Found the Ochido wannabe. Fuck people who abuse exploits.
---
Banning isn't that real of a risk with DC'ing casually
---
FYI if the killer hits you with Franklin's you still lose your item. &gt;:)
---
Loosing
---
yeah, i recently got Hag and started to level her up to get devour and Ruin it took me from level 1 to 31 to get BBQ and Chill.
---
This still isn't exactly humanoid?
---
thats definitly not working against most good players
---
Who the hell is that? It's not a harmful exploit in anyway, you just keep your item. So fuck off.
---
It's like close, but I do find this one pretty unlikely
---
I agree. Otz is friendly and a great teacher!!
---
Lol damn dude that sucks.
---
F
---
I guess you can say that you made your choice.
---
absolutly agreed
---
did she walk right past a hook for the final one?
---
so..you can maybe get an easy hit on a solo player(who dont tend to bunch up like pre built teams) then moves slower than any killer excluding the killers with a transportation ability? how would it ever get a hit lol
---
A while ago I was at rank 8 survivor and my teammates and killer were all rank 2-3. I felt so out of place lol
---
It's just a suggestion. Was just thinking a killer that *is* a survivor is a cool idea
---
Just a little bit
---
Welp it happened somehow
---
*Impossible*
---
Its a conditionally worse lunge. And I didn't ignore the teleport I just didn't think it necessary to comment on that. Besides, we all know that the only powers that really matter are those that help in chase.
---
Indeed
---
You’d be surprised how many higher tier players get caught by the wild billy rounding a corner, can’t fight stupid 😂
---
The problem is SWF would destroy this
---
Yeah i'm not having that much fun with him. Just feels so bad getting the full stalk off and then i get looped till it wears off.
---
To be fair, for people like me who aren't a fan of Stranger Things, this isn't exactly exciting times. This is gonna be like when Ghostface came out on console during the DBD three year anniversary and you couldn't not run into him.
---
What I mean with doesnt affect is that its not a real change of the gameplay or its not one significant.
---
Pig doesnt care about Stealth, since she has other ways to affect the game and interact with the core mechanics of it. Her crouch isnt really for Stealth, but mostly for Mind-Gaming
---
Michael is Unnafected by it on its Stealth Builds
---
The real problem of Wraith isnt so much stealth, he gets speed and map control with the right Add-Ons, the fact that Wraith is fucked by Anti-Stealth Perks its not really a problem with other peoples perks, but the fact that the Wraith sucks so much and needs a rework so badly. He (alongside Ghost Face, maybe) COULD be one of the Killers that are gifted this new Anti-Detection Mechanics and would be okey with that, but I dont really want to see a game where every Future Killer with the slightest piece of Stealth gets a free perk that consumes no spaces that reads "Fuck the Survivors perks", the same way I dont want to see a game where every Future Survivor gets a Pre-Nerf MoM Kind of Perk, but thats not important now, since its not what Im adressing at. 
---
Not really looking forwards to a Pig that just kills Spine Chill because she doesnt know how to notice its presence and mind-game by simply moving the camara. Or any other player, Surv or Kill, have a passive that destroys a perk just because they didnt know how to play agaisnt it.
---
Aside from what I meant with that, I wasnt really complaining about the Death of OoO, Im complaining at the fact that the Perk is going to Die as soon as it becomes a played Perk. WTF, so we lose OoO, a perk that only fucks ONE killer, alongside Spine Chill, Premonition, Maybe Kindred depending on how it will work agaisnt Trump-Effects, and other perks, but we got to keep Adrenaline destroying most of the killer roast just because YES? At this point is almost like they WANT survivors to ALWAYS use the same 4 Meta-Perks.
---
The base  to a Healthy Meta is Options. Right now, we dont have those. We dont have play-styles (mostly because people loves to belittle the way other people plays the fucking game) and we dont have a Line of Thought for Builds. As soon as you TRY to use another build agaisnt a semi-decent Killer with at least 2 Meta Perks you get destroyed, and as soon as you try to make a new interesting Horror-Like build for a Killer the 4 Survivors are destroying you. 
---
Im excited about the new DLC, it seems that if people likes the new perks we could start having new interesting builds, new play-stlyes, rewarding  choice and Off-Side Objectives. Im not excited about the death of other older interesting perks alongisde it.
---
Fuck, ranting too much, im so sorry
---
Yeah, I was thinking of a way to counter that, but couldn't lol
---
You realize.killers have the priority on the hatch?
---
That's it. This is the first DLC I'm going to buy for DBD
---
I can’t wait to stare at a generator for 90% of the game
---
Sorry, English is not my main language unu
---
It has a vaguely humanoid body. 2 legs, 2 arms, torso in the middle, head on top. I guess that's what they mean.
---
Again, the hatch is a last ditch opening to escape, once the hatch comes into play, you, as a survivor, failed your primary objective. If you fail your objective, why should the game just keep handing you free chances?
---
Demogorgon is at least 2 to 3 weeks away. How much do you play a day / week?
---
I believe he maybe isn't there because he holds more power then the Entity. The other killers while strong are still able to be manipulated even the Demogorgon to my knowledge can be manipulated but somebody as powerful as Pinhead, maybe is too much for the Entity.
---
Yeah but it does not in this game and you are suggesting it does which isnt great because dbd is so addicting because of how different it is from other games (my opinion) they are working with matchmaking soon and that should help with some of the complaints. Also side note, they have rank reset every month. The game can be challenging for everyone at times and newbies arent concerned with balance issues they are usually pretty fucking scared at first and only later do they decide if they want to take the time to complain about a game.
---
But first you have to have healed other survivors, which is something you cannot control and often a larger time investment than the time used to heal yourself once by other means. And the Broken + not-being-able-to-heal-in-terror-radius thing can make the perk a direct detriment in quite a few scenarios. It's unreliable and has no utility but being a potential timer-saver, but how much time it saves - if it does at all - is lacklustre even in the best case scenario.
---
Inner Strength still takes longer than a Self-Care heal under Mangled, which is about the worst it usually gets. You need to find a totem, cleanse it, find a locker, stand in it for 8 seconds. That's a lot of time, given that you also have to traverse the map in the process.
---
Both of these perks would be really cool if they worked in chases, but they don't, and so all they do is save time, and they don't really even do that, certainly not reliably or to any impactful extent.
---
what
---
The cell phones from 1993 were nothing like the ones we have now. They were basically the size of a cordless phone, and definitely didn’t have cameras yet.
---
Im hyped but sad that killer mains are going to cry about Inner Strength so it will get nerfed like survivors do every patch while we still have NOED.
---
head on
---
hOT DAMN THAT BOI THICC
---
Fans of what? Stranger Things because as a fan of DBD this is pretty much garbage. I'm more interested in Original stuff and not more lazy ass Licensed garbage.
---
Dude if you didn't think huge map mobility and stealth was important enough, your missing out on huge parts of the game. You left it out so you could pretend all they gave him was a lunge. 
---
The lunge can be worse, if you miss or they turn a corner. However it has a large hitbox, goes farther, and you can turn at the end of it to reach for them.
---
And chainsaw hand
---
All running around the swamp boat with scuba trapper
---
Killer is fast, solo pretty fast, swf takes longer
---
The q times are longer on ps4 when your new but as you rank up and play more it’ll get a lot quicker I like ps4 more cause you at least don’t deal with a nurse every game in higher ranks
---
Queue times are fine seeing as most PS Plus members got the game for free a while back, only downside is possibly the ping and frame rate. The frame rate is capped on PS4 compared to PC I’m assuming... otherwise the game is still fun. I wouldn’t say try to go competitive on PS4 but it’s still fun
---
Considering you can't use your power to down survivors anymore (which is correct), even seeing scratch marks wouldn't be something absurd.
---
Next week 100%
---
It has potential, though it might not be amazing since vaults aren’t the most common loop. It’ll help you force pallets though
---
I actually just got done at 12 rank legion match. Im done putting up a challenge for myself. Im about to fuck every single one of those fucking bastards up beyond belief. Traps, Chainsaws. Im going to fuck all of the damn survivors.
---
Honestly wouldn't even be broken anymore, it would be pretty useful actually
---
I'm glad to hear that

Hmm interesting
---
Make legion frenzy duration much longer/unlimited (able to cancel) after hitting someone to make him a pretty decent mid tier killer.
---
Hes not overpowered when you hit green ranks. Hes barely used there
---
It’s 1 perk per level until 20 ish (can’t remember the exact level) then it’s 2 per level.
---
Yikes
---
He's not overpowered. In fact, he's one of the weakest killers in the game.
---
No. His idea is to stab people and force them to mend. Hes supposed to be a group attacker but he gets crippled by being blinded and asthma attacks if you miss an attack.
---
Having a relatively low playerbase doesn't help with the matchmaking, it'll be improved with an influx
---
I mean this sort of makes up for the lost survivor
---
Theres a perk literally called babysitter. Obviously we should run it to protect the babies
---
If your a good killer then survivors with adrenaline literally wasted a perk slot
---
Please BEhavior. Im begging on my knees. Make my fashionable boi atleast viable
---
after wasting time to 99% heal.
---
&gt;Make legion frenzy duration much longer/unlimited (able to cancel) after hitting someone to make him a pretty decent mid tier killer.
---
His tracking is far too strong to be unlimited. Don't know about longer. I usually run recharge with increased duration add-ons.
---
I remember having a pc that ran the game at like 20 fps and his skill checks were a nightmare, then I got a good rig and it's so easy its dumb lol
---
You're getting the hatch if you pull this off against me
---
He's used often at low ranks because he's very simple. Once you get better at chases he becomes a lot less intimidating
---
Lisenced killers take just as much work as original killers. The only difference is that the killer already has a set look and POSSIBLE power idea
---
Fair points all around, I commend your thoroughness. 
---
It still doesn't change my mind however, I just don't think "it" would fit in lore-wise.
---
And to your point about Myers, he is pure evil.
---
If his job is to kill anything that moves, especially Laurie, I don't think he would mind taking orders.
---
Either way, the devs never explained why or how he or Laurie came into the realm.
---
Please. Please with this.
---
Damn I really wished hopper was in the game with that skin
---
The mid-chapter patch not the chapter patch itself, and the “observer” is also coming in the same mid-chapter giving new objectives to complete and exclusive rewards
---
Do you even english bro
---
It's ok I did kinda word dump. I know I should gun it for BBQ and Teachables every time but is there anything else I should nab as a 0 DLC guy rn? Or just use the Killers 3 Unique
---
the reason i play them is for the more stressful gameplay and the reward is bloodpoints but you know to each their own
---
A mutated human from the game dead space of your wondering it’s a female slasher necromorph
---
Let's get some devs to see
---
Nah dude, like I'm convinced at this point nothing they add will ever matter for Killer until they nerf Nurse, BBQ, Ruin, and PGTW. And same for Survivor until they nerf DS (again, because it's more of an anti-momentum perk than an actual tunneling perk at the moment), Adrenaline, Dead Hard, and Borrowed Time. All those things are literally fucking light-years above everything else in the game and they haven't gotten any tweaks. Can't have an actual discussion about Killer balance because the answer every time is "Just play Nurse." It's infuriating. And I'm pretty sure Spine Chill and Premonition are going to remain unchanged, it's just aura reads. And again, you make valid points, but you can't deny the fact that stealth REALLY helps these killers, and gives WAY more incentive to play them instead of just playing Nurse every single game.
---
But they don't do the group attacking well enough to be viable. Mending isn't deadly enough to be an issue, and legion has nothing other than their small frame to help in chase if survivors don't need to heal 24 7 in order to feel comfortable looping. Survivors not being in a group makes legion almost powerless, and its kinda an issue. Why youd need to see blood in frenzy anymore is beyond me, but it wouldn't make legion any more stronger since hitting survs already in deep wound with feral frenzy does nothing, the only thing you need to do is stab them in feral frenzy, follow the sound of their groans, and get out of feral frenzy behind them. Theres a reason most people think legion is kinda low tier
---
And then you get to rank 15 and get steamrolled by the rank reset players.
---
You're thinking of Bloodpoints. I'm talking the rank rewards for killers and survivors you're literally not paying attention.
---
I had a game with against a TTV and the two members of their toolbox squad (communicating Ruin and everything) and they really freaked out and bodyblocked for each other without regard for who was on death hook.
---
Like the guy on death hook ended up doing the last body block and it was super strange.
---
Meanwhile there's this Feng who isn't part of the three-man SWF and is just trying to complete generators, using Lithe and juking me really well so that I lose her. She has my last stack of BBQ&amp;C and I'm trying to find her (I've lost her twice due to my own spirit walking and her use of lithe around a building).
---
I've killed two already and the TTV player is a Laurie on death hook that I've already slugged like twice and let her get picked up and I know doesn't have DS (or it's been more than 60 seconds) and I find her. Every damn time. Again and again and again.
---
I slug her and look for the Feng. Feng doesn't pick her up. I pick her up and let her go free. I find Laurie again. Slug Laurie. Leave. Have to go back and spam drop Laurie. I find Laurie like another four times and let her get away with downing her.
---
It was so meme-y that I just let the Laurie and Feng survive after I two-hooked the Feng *finally*. Like seriously, it was such a potato match and only the Feng was any good.
---
I’m good at chases, but the shocks keep preventing me from using vaults and pallets
---
What's fixated?
---
She walked past it to try and get as far away from the gates as possible
---
No English isn’t my main language
---
Thing is, the legion trailer, I believe, takes place in the entity's realm
---
Swiggity swoops, coming for the scoops
---
It's not huge, but that's still a fairly good amount. I have a feeing this chapter is really going to boost the playerbase though.
---
I guess it depends on what you consider worth it, he sure does have some fun perks (and Discordance, one of his perks hasn't been on the shrine yet). His power is okay, when you go into the mode you need to stab someone and you'll be able to find other people to stab and waste their time mending.
---
That is stuff of nightmares
---
Thats not a meme, thats just strategy imo
---
This is the whole reason I don't hop back on PC.  While mine was down I made too much progress on Xbox.
---
I play for the chase as well. But when 2 chases = gens done and all survivors escape what's the point? Being on the survivor side is the power role. Not the killer.
---
This has nothing to do with dbd.. someone get it off my screen
---
Honestly was for me as a child lol best part about them the only way to kill one of those things was to shoot off each limb legs arms head all that stuff just to kill one.
---
Will's brother.
---
Oh, I had never heard about that. I look at killer backstories but not much else. I know the devs didn’t want friend grouping to be a thing originally so SWF wasn’t very developed but I still think that something would be better than the emotes (?). I don’t even know how to use the emotes on console since I’m not exactly super experienced but they aren’t exactly the most useful tool to communicate. If most of the players are using other tools to talk anyways why not just include it in your game? I understand from a lore point of view but most players are in a party or discord or Skype call. I’m not on PC but my friend who is says he’s normally on skype and such
---
Mettle of Man will reenter the Meta because of all the hits ppl will take to protect baby nancies and baby steves.
---
Wrong. Season 2 gave us the redemption of Steve in full. He went from douchey prep with bad taste in friends to badass babysitter and protector of the Party.
---
But once you get one the other one gets eaten by the entity right? That stays the same til level 50?
---
awe why dont you cry some kore cause youre too dumb to do bloodwebs efficiently
---
The new perk Surge might be meta, it’s basically Pop with less steps, just going to have to see the range and how often it’s triggered.
---
Even on killers like Billy or Huntress I can see it being sort of useful, using the chainsaw when Surge is on cool down is still a decent use of the perk.
---
&gt;Which is stupid. There's no balance to the payoff
---
You're right. Almost all of the killers scoring events are easier to earn than the survivor scoring events, you can't even get 8k in one of the categories in a great match even for winning as a survivor unless you farmed for it, also bbq and chili stacks are much easier to earn than wglf stacks. If survivors escape they'll either earn quite a bit more than the killer if they destroyed them, or if it was close, the killer will still earn more than the top survivor for the same amount of time played
---
Of course ppl want to play the new killer.
---
At least you can find a game.  I tried for half an hour today to get in a game on ps4 with no luck.  Been having that issues more often lately.
---
Anyone who plays with that outfit gets a free escape.
---
Most people 99 their targets but I don’t usually do that. Try to corner them in a part of the map with no pallets while chasing them or use the crouch ability to get close to the survivor. Sometimes you can stand only a couple meters away from them without them noticing. You should also run add ons to at least help a little.
---
cringe
---
Eh, the devs don't need to add something they never intended to be in the game just because people use work-arounds.
---
It's up to the players to play how the game is built, or to use external services for comfortablity.
---
I don't think you can balance no-clipping through terrain.
---
Even if they make her a normal 115% Killer and nerf her blink range to five meters (removing her post-blink stun time and lowering the charge time to account for the incredible loss in distance) she would still shut down every single pallet loop and hit the survivor on the other side.
---
yes.
---
How to fix ugly models in DBD. 
---
Give them Steve’s face.
---
Bloodpoints don't even matter. Holy fuck what is with the ignorants getting hung up on this. I'm talking rank rewards, pips. And the gameplay rewards for playing each role. As a killer you neither get a pip nor a satisfying end to a match. It's just frustration more often than not. As a survivor you get rewarded for not being disabled.
---
More often it's simply the match making. When I play duo with my lower rank friend we get matched with even lower rank killers so many times. I also saw it in n solo q, getting matched with 3 rank 20s + rank 20 killer.
---
ah ok
---
Circle pitt!!!
---
1. If you really want to learn the killers reach the hard way, play it dangerous and go around for another time. If you're actually looking to escape or play a little better in matches, I'd almost always say its better safe than sorry with pallet dropping.
---
2. I wouldn't worry about this too much. Especially against killers who know what they're doing, 360's won't buy you more than a second or two of time. I wouldn't worry about trying to master this particular skill.
---
3. For most characters, the terror radius indicates how far away the killer is. (obvious tip alert) a little experience will let you know how much time you have before the killer gets there.
---
4. Just read the game. Aura reading perks are helpful here. Try to be mindful of your teammates. Are all three of you on the same side of the map? You might wanna spend a second seeing if anyone is going to unhook them. I wouldn't run towards every hook you see though, particularly ones that are across the map. Any generator you start but don't finish is progress that is liable to be lost when the killer damages the Gen.
---
5. Depends on the killer. Hillbillies, nurses, and other chasing and power heavy killers you should probably play cautiously. Against stealth/trap killers, you may have more time to stick around. Just a general rule of thumb.
---
6. Just the obvious. Don't teabag, and don't farm your teammates off the hook. But keep in mind there's no way to please everyone and a killer somewhere will be displeased by your playstyle, and vice versa.
---
7. If you're leveling survivors to unlock their teachables, go for the cheapest items and let the entity take more expensive ones. If you're playing your main character that you want to keep, I would always take items of the highest rarity first.
---
Also, always always ALWAYS get a perk, first thing in the bloodweb.
---
8. David King and Claudette are good picks. Any survivor with an "easy" rating will have perks that don't take much time or experience to use effectively.
---
Killer tips:
---
1. When you need pressure. Dead by daylight is a game that tends to snowball. Especially at high ranks, the best chance for you winning is to apply a lot of pressure, and take a survivor out of the game ASAP. Leaving all four alive is a recipe for failure. Remember, you'll never break a chain by evenly applying pressure, only by breaking the weak link.
---
2. I'd say when you've met 3 criteria. 1. You've injured the survivor. 2. They've just dropped a pallet. And 3. You have another, reasonably close target to chase.
---
3. I'd advice watching videos of both killer individually. They're both stealth killers, but their play styles are wildly different. No way to generalize perks there.
---
4. Scratch marks are the least reliable way to track survivors. If possible you should focus on blood, grunts of pain/breathing, footsteps, crows etc. Pay attention to the scratch marks, but note that they are misleading and try to find a better trail to follow.
---
5. Killers I would advise finding out the best add-ons and stockpiling those. Also note that unlike common survivor add-ons, most common killer add-ons actually make a big difference, and you should definitely focus on stockpiling charge time add-ons if there exist any for your killer.
---
6. YES! If there's a perk you'll never use, and it's the third tier, get it off the web. With the exception of when you prestige, you'll never have to buy it again and the pool is smaller allowing you to get better perks.
---
7. Once the gates are open and the time begins, you can just wait them out. They'll either leave or die, you don't have to subject yourself to embarrassment any more luckily. If they don't open the gates, you can do so by pressing space when they're powered and leaving the area.
---
8. Trapper, and hillbilly would be my two.
---
Spoiling as in giving a ton of stuff, not as in saying endgame spoiler in r/expectedthanos
---
Whether or not you 'guarantee' it has no meaning to it. There's no studies, no trends, no other games that can significantly support your viewpoint. Therefore, it's difficult to talk about it because we have no basis to go with other than our own game.
---
Every game is repetitive. MOBA's, single player, GTA, etc... all of these get boring from time to time. What makes people continue to play some more than others is the notion of ranking up. People continue to play MOBA's to reach higher ranks because they find it rewarding and fulfilling. Does that mean rank is responsible for their toxic community? Maybe... maybe not. 
---
In DotA, there's a game mode called 'Turbo'. It's basically a steroid version of the game that a lot of people play online. It has zero meaning in terms of rank. You can't rank up with it. You can't have a badge next to your name, nothing. However, people still take it seriously even though it's meant to be for fun. Why? People like to win and they don't like losing. This is why I don't think taking off rank will do anything, because there is a win / loss aspect in the games we play. You died? Loss. You escaped? Win. Whether or not a rank is attached to it will not matter, people will still be upset that they died in the game.
---
Can relate.
---
The game is literally only as big as it is because of licensing.
---
and immersed claudette’s, don’t forget them
---
Dead hard gang rise up
---
I definitely agree but at the same time there’s new players that leave due to a lack of understanding. The tutorial is great for a newer player but some people will still be confused. I know multiple people who uninstalled DBD after only 5 matches or so just because there was no chat and they had questions. I think BHVR isn’t required to follow all of our wants and requests but I think some form of mid game chat other than just a wave would be a little helpful.
---
Alright. This is a general new player guide so I'm going to assume very little and give as much info as possible.
---
Let's start with the base strategy: finding survivors. You're playing too passively, and as the killer you have to put the pressure on them. Search generators, and if you can't ever seem to find a survivor with a generator running nearby, check the lockers at ranks 20-15, and around the corners of loops at ranks 14 onwards. Often times survivors will do 1 of 3 things when a killer grows near their gen at the beginning. Hide, juke, or run. Some players will have urban evasion (base walking speed while crouched, meaning they can sneak away a bit faster) so when searching a generator give a fairly wide radius but don't stay too long. Kick it and move on. More gens they have to do, the more pressure they have. If you can get 1 hook before a gen pops you're doing fine.

Perks: most perks are personal choice, aside from two. Hex: ruin and BBQ &amp; chili. Ruin slows the game down just a little bit, thus more time to hunt survivors (who at lower ranks will usually search for the totem rather than repair generators)  and win with more gens up. BBQ is godly for the bloodpoint grind that is DBD, as well as moderate tracking (shows survivor auras beyond 40 meters for 3 seconds) so anything goes, but those two are king while still learning

How to attack as killer: (incase you or whoever else reading this doesn't know, you can lunge attack by holding down the attack button) now, always think about where a survivor is going, and their next move, not what are they doing right now. Sure, know what they are doing but always try to anticipate what survivors will do. A window nearby? They'll most likely jump through. Pallet around the corner? Don't swing unless you know you'll hit them before they reach it. Looking behind them and watching your every move? They most likely have dead hard and will dodge your next attack, so bait it out by getting close ( or delaying the attack as nurse after a blink)
---
The Killer mindset: always be in a proactive reactive state. Don't fall into a pattern, and always be on the lookout for clues of survivor perks. Someone unhooked then healed shortly after? Medkit or we'll make it. Getting unhooked with broken status effect? Deliverance. Obsession symbol around their name, but not running any obsession perks? Expect decisive strike or object of obsession. You More Often than not can exploit these by denying them these. Always focus on gen defense. Don't focus on getting a 3 gen strat, but if a gen is about to pop then stay around for an extra couple seconds before leaving (Pop goes the weasel is great for this, as instant gen regression is amazing)
---
Killer specifics:
---
Trapper: deny loops, and proxy an section of the map. Don't leave much, and with him the basement is your best friend.
---
Billy: vroom vroom, you're super fast and instant down people. Try and get a saw off but don't be afraid to simply chase and down.
---
Wraith: easily the weakest, but still viable. Stealth near a gen, and if you hear it being repaired, get visual on the survivor and try to body block them. This guarentees the first hit and makes the chase much easier
---
Nurse: always be blinking. You're basically hillbilly but with an easier time going from A to B, and can simply ignore survivor defenses. They will try to juke but so long as you get close enough with the first blink the second is your correction blink and gives you an easier time getting a hit off.
---
Meyers: stalk out of tier 1 ASAP. You're weaker than a base killer and will get stomped if you can't get past tier 1. Distance and line of sight are your best friends here, as well as walls and even height. Like in team fortress 2 nobody looks up. In a chase, stalk until you're almost at tier 3, then when you're about to hit the survivor pop tier 3 and insta-down them (biggest pants wetting moment outside of seeing a billy right behind you fully revved up)
---
Hag: trapper only you're the injuring mechanism
---
Doctor: my boy. Best tracking killer with his restraint add-ons making it so illusionary doctors aura's are visible in madness 2 not just 3. Starting the game, get as many people into tier 2 as soon as possible, but prioritize hitting a survivor over tier 2 madness. Also for perks, a big terror radius all the tine is the best, so ignore monitor and abuse, and get distressing. Also, a restraint and calm add-on is an amazing combo. Everything else is a kind-of. In the chase? He can stun a survivor from dropping a pallet or vaulting with timing, but the delay between shock, switch forms and smack is hard. Shock when you can't get a hit, and hit when you can. 
---
Huntress: she's basically got a much longer lunge. Use her hatchets as such, with the occasional 360 YY no-scope cross-map tomahawk toss.
---
Cannible: best defensive character. If someone goes for an unhook in front of you, rev and let go when the other person is on the ground. Rev when near a pallet to either insta-break it or down the survivor.
---
Freddy: use his dream traps to slow down survivors at loops, or dream pallets to mess with asleep survivors. Teleport to a gen when you think a survivor is on it, or use it to get survivors off a gen and chase as normal (this is his mind-game)
---
Pig: use her crouch to sneak near a generator, and then chase as normal. Only lunge for the dailies. Put a trap on a survivor when you chase them away from a nearly done gen or after the first gen pops. That extra pressure of the trap removes that player until they get it off. Especially if a gen pops when they have the helmet on.
---
The clown: he's the herder. In a chase, throw his bottles at windows or pallets to either punish a survivor for running through it or dissuade them from going there. If a survivor is in the open and you can get a free hit, throw the bottle at/on them and then hit them. Less speed from the post:hit boost.
---
Spirit: she's the big brain player. Pallet loop? Go still and maybe they'll run at you. If they don't, phase and slap them from the other side, or just run to them and slap them that way. Also, her "husk" is a physical entity, so if you get to a pallet before a survivor you can plop your body down there and spirit walk to them for a pretty easy hit.
---
Legion: cry a lot
---
Plague: vomit. Only grab corrupt if they aren't cleansing much. Break them with vomit before hitting them. After kicking a gen, puke on it.
---
Ghost face: T-bag and stalk
---
Bloodpoints and iridescent shards are literally the only rewards you get for playing the game, there are no rank rewards, pips literally just make the game worse the more you acquire for both sides (good swf teams for killers, god nurses for survs at rank 1) also I still consistently pip at higher ranks despite not playing the upper tier killers. Either way, you may have a point if ranking rewards were currently an implemented feature, but since it's not, I want you to think about what you're earning by hitting higher ranks. Bragging rights possibly, a red/purple number can look nice. Bloodpoints are kinda the only thing that matter in terms of progression for now, so....
---
What about a multi-pass?
---
just hold on and let your team do gens while he loses for being stupid, uness your team is dumber
---
And apparently fuck your teammates, too. Nice one.
---
Far too little text

BHVR is partly responsible by allowing toxic play styles to persist in the game.
---
I always love hearing people’s reasons for DCing. 
---
Recently I had a guy dc while I mori’d him, his reason was because it’s not fair to mori when he was only on the hook once.
---
Just let the cowards be cowards
---
Oh no...here bud. Take all my F’s. You need them more.
---
If I was a dev, I'd make a seperate matchmaking area for players new to the game that locks after a certain amount of time played, where new players only face new players, and the survivors could have some extra form of communication exclusively in that mode.
---
At all ranks it seems the scum mains can't handle the only killer that isn't a guaranteed escape for survs
---
Protect me

New Nancy perk, you see your scratch marks and walk faster

I do this every time I SWF with my friend. One screams at the other to give them the WGLF stack and one tries to kobe before they get saved. Absolute blast.
---
Thotslayer Ahoy
---
That is... fucking hilarious. Good job man.
---
Your game strategy is completely rigid, you refuse any forms of concealment what's so ever that you refuse to hide in a locker for 5 seconds just so the killer doesnt know where you are and can finish the gen you're working on
---
I like that idea, something similar to the Newcomer mode in R6 would probably be helpful.
---
I’m not so sure about that, NotOtz plays in red ranks as interesting perks and killers, and wins the games. Seems mostly like it’s about being smart
---
Let me tell you about a time I run almost a full circle around the map without getting hit in a chase.
---
I have data on my last 350+ games on Xbox and you are indeed correct based on my experience.  Plague and clown lower than everyone else.
---
Ok, what's the latest major survivor nerf again?
---
No clip? Lol idk
---
I see your lack of brains wasnt just for show, its empty all the way down. I said old DS, not new DS. New DS is great. And I guess we're done here. You're too rabid and stupid too see past your own "injustice" and honestly I've lost the will to argue with stupid people anymore. Have a good day, if you can.
---
I also do it for people I see having bad luck. Especially when I see their teammates essentially screwing them at every opportunity. 
---
I also sometimes will roll dice at the start for each survivor. Highest number gets to live unless they are a toxic shit.
---
I dont see anything in this clip that would make her death your fault...

Can someone tell me what the PTB is??? Everyone is like THE PTB is coming out soon does that mean we will be able to buy the chapter or what??
---
A d tier perk soft counters another d tier perk, incredible

So you could creatively set them up for surveillance of the survivors as well
