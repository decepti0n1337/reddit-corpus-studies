I‚Äôm not saying he can‚Äôt, I just don‚Äôt think he does. Going from ‚ÄúI‚Äôm playing huntress who takes skill‚Äù to getting bored and running legion in himself plus tunnel facecamp. Doesn‚Äôt seem believable to me
---
---
---
Definitely replace no-ed. Your axes don't get affected by it. I'd go bitter murmur. Usually you don't wanna be using your melee as huntress but instead hit with your axes cause it doesn't take as long as your melee cooldown. so unrelenting is also not needed but you're on console so i don't know how hard it is to hit axes. i would replace it with spies from the shadows if you're comfortable with using axes mostly. 
---
I‚Äôm a huntress main and honestly I think whispers is more important than nurses or ruin. While ruin does slow the game, whispers allows you to locate survivors much sooner, and start putting on the pressure right away.
---
Survivors collectively orgasmed at this image. 
---
Why would anyone upload a scoreboard bragging about their score. It's not interesting at all. Glad there arent many people like the OP else this subreddit would be spammed with scoreboards.
---
What I found to be working recently is that I simply give up specific generators. I set up where I want by any means necessary. It usually means giving up chases, chasing them off of the area and forcing down pallets (and get stacks for my STBFL). I also use sloppy instead of ruin to slow the game down, works well with all the smacks. 
---
:( sad
---
Can you explain why it's not meta anymore? I understand that an extra 8 seconds isn't nothing, but since they re-fixed the gen efficiency repair speed when more than one survivor is repairing, doesn't it still make self care useful?
---
Nurse, Billy, and Spirit with Ruin make me sad. They literally do not need ruin and if it's a good map for totems (game, lery, swamp, forest) then your games are over. Makes me think try hard or lack of confidence to kill. Nurse with NOED is even worse.
---
ooooooohhhhhhh, thats really annoying cause it just screws everyone else in the trial. ty for the info mate
---
I also play about 50/50, I would say watch those assumptions, but I'm totally making some myself so fair callout.
---
This is a tough call and depends heavily on the killer you‚Äôre using and their mobility. 
---

---
I personally prefer Surveillance and I main Pig/Spirit. That being said, I do like Discordance, but it‚Äôs typically something I use if I don‚Äôt have Surveillance. In my experience at least, survivors realize you have Discordance pretty quick and just stop working together. Granted, that‚Äôs a nice benefit of the perk itself, obviously, but I prefer Surveillance myself.
---
ruin is a trash overrated perk. change my mind
---
No. I have p3 Claud because I was bored but immersion is definitely 100% not the way to play the game. It artificially boosts your rank until you start getting killers way out of your league, and then people want to derank. Instead, learn to loop better, work on gens and go for saves efficiently, and you will be infinitely more valuable to your team.
---
How the fuck
---
Np man. I hope they revert it soon or put in some new countermeasures.
---
Corrupt intervention would actually help with that. 
---
Nope I stayed crouched and snuck right out the same way I got in lol
---
Wow! How? Lol
---
To be honest, I don't use whispers because I suck at using it. I seriously don't know how to utilize it so I never use it even on huntress
---
Don't have it ;-;
---
High quality meme.
---
Isn't this promoting witch hunting
---
As a small Game user i agree I usually find it in a minute or so. 
---
Highly recommend you play killer so you understand both sides of the game, it will also make you better at playing as survivor. 
---
They could have seen you go into the locker. When you run you leave scratch marks that the killer can see they might have lead to the locker. If you sprint (same windows and pallets) into a locker it makes a marker that the killer sees. The killer can also hear your breathing in lockers although it is very faint so they killer would have to stop and listen.
---
I smell NOED
---
Complete trash. Bet bhvr won‚Äôt respond to this one ü§£
---
What‚Äôs the green 102
---
Been on Xbox since 2017 and its still as strong as it was when I first started playing.The steady updates and dlc keep things going.This is just one of those games where you either give up on it fast or play for years.
---
You should definitely learn! When I started using it efficiently my ability to find people and snowball increased by a lot. OhTofu has a pretty good video guide on how to use it, and it is worth a watch.
---
I though I was hitting them so hard they dc. 
---
But seriously it‚Äôs so annoying. I hit someone and they dc. Or my teammates dc and I have to escape alone. 
---
Nice arguments
---
It‚Äôs definitely not as I‚Äôve seen it happen on all my accounts. You can‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a massive difference that‚Äôs where people end up making false assumptions. Take un hooking yourself for example, 4% chance, using items can increase that but only small percentages (the closest possible with perks and items being 40% or something like that). When you prestige you‚Äôre only adding a very small percent for future unlocks but it still makes a slight difference.
---
Disagree wholesomly. Good survivor play can counteract everyone, aside from maybe legion nurse billy spirit. 
---
Sounds like you had a great time mate
---
I can‚Äôt get it on Xbox.. rip
---
Yeah the worst is when a stupid survivor gets caught once or fails their ‚Äúsick loop skills‚Äù and they dc. Seen plenty this past week as a killer and survivor. It makes the game less enjoyable tbh.

I‚Äôve been called a cheater because the chainsaw downs people with one hit, because you‚Äôre dead on your first hook when you‚Äôre the only one left and because I hacked so the pig would have no terror radius when crouching.

I know this will be downvoted and people will jump to conclusions about false reports and witch hunting, but in time, we're going to prove to you that it's not that...

And the hard proof HAS to be there.
---
it really does, one player with their siKkk looping getting down so early just snowballs to an altruistic shit show
---
I guess you don't play too many online video games then
---
What happened?
---
Pressure happened.
---
be one step ahead and always bring a key a guess ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
devs hate survivors : )
---
on ps i got to rank 1 by maining (obviously not only playing) freddy and didnt use ruin, i did use noed thiugh
---
Ahem
---
pls devs pls
---
NIGGAFACE
---
I will confirm that Freddy is very possible to reach Rank 1, and even better, without Ruin. 
---
I play lots of Freddo, one of my favorites for points 
---
On Ps4, occasionally the lobby will bug out, you can tell it has if you go onto the quick menu (hold the ps button) and go to Dead By Daylight, check the currently playing with tab, if it says you are not in a game with your friend, the lobby has broken and will need to be restarted.
---
Why is the FBI at my door?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
A whole chapter would be awesome, imagine the map potential too. So many cool areas in the games 
---
In a game mode where time is your biggest resource, and enemy, Ruin affords you more of it than any other perk in the game. Ruin gives the same benefit to good killers as it does to bad ones, it has no bearing on how good or bad you are. As good of a killer as you are without it, and I'm sure you're MLG, you're still more effective on average when you run it. 
---
lmao none of the survivors have persoanlity.
---
"Energetic and altruistic" aren't a personality, neither are "Charismatic but dumb", "Lone wolf", "calm and empathetic", and especially not "innocent and pure". In fact, none of the things you listed have more personality than Feng. 
---
Prove Thyself, Spine Chill, Resilience/exhaustion perk and Bond
---
With dedicated servers could this happen?
---
What? You tried to slide in "shitty killers feel defeated"
---
Only one way to take that bud.
---
no you don't understand I have over 500 hours and to fix killers being underpowered against skilled players they change survivors which is bullshit,360s were skill and people complained so they broke hitboxes now killers are almost op. I'm (well used to be) a rank 1 nurse main(I kinda stopped playing killer takes too long to get game) and I have hit so many fucking people with bullshit hits its not even funny. The server is based off of the killer which is bullshit the killer can easily lag switch. Dedicated servers who?
---
What were they saying in the post game chat? I would guess bitching about Legion cause why wouldn't they hate on it like everyone else.
---
Gg, you're really good :)
---
I said ‚Äúit‚Äôs shitty killers feel defeated...‚Äù meaning ‚Äúit‚Äôs bad that killers feel upset‚Äù Jesus dude learn.how.to.read. 
---
That's literally a bug. Also, no one says that Legion doesn't need changes, just not the changes most people cry about. 
---
Right... Which makes it even more head scratching that they didn't include one when they added him in later.
---
I said I‚Äôd never prestige characters outside of Theo me I did for achievement, now I‚Äôm doing it out of boredom cause I have nothing to do and working on each one individually. So far I‚Äôve done Dwight, Claud, Meg, Jake, Feng and Kate all P3 50 and currently working on Nea.
---
Let‚Äôs take charismatic but dumb. If someone‚Äôs charismatic they are a sweet talker and generally persuasive and can get out of sticky situations. But since they are dumb they get into sticky situations a lot. This perfectly describes Ace and how he presents himself and his general posture and attitude we know that he doesn‚Äôt give 2 shits about what happens. We can conclude that Ace is an all around funny guy but makes bad decisions. Innocent and pure isn‚Äôt right for Kate tbh. I think fighter or kindred would work better for describing her personality. What the do you mean they don‚Äôt have more personality? How the actual fuck does Feng, an alcoholic gamer girl have a better personality than *Ash?!* Fucking Ash dude. Ash is definitely sleazy but at heart he is a true hero that will stop at nothing to vanquish evil. Feng is a drunk that eventually passed out that got whisked away to the Trials. Ash and everything else in the dbd cast are so much more unique and better than Feng when it comes to personality. 
---
Full bloody 
---
1v1v8 would be nice, two killers compete for kills, that way much more action is happening. No need to slug or camp, that's wasted time that the other killer is using to hunt. Tunneling is not a good option either since you're bound to run into another survivor since they're so many of them.
---
Survivors would probably need additional objectives, either more gens or the lantern mechanic that was use for New Year's.
---
Maps would definitely need to be optimized for this, but it would be cool. 
---
If all 3 of your teammates are within inches of the hook everytime someones on the hook, you're ASKING to be face camped.
---
There is literaly NO reason for the killer to leave. Why would he leave when all 4 survivors are at the hook?
---
They aren't working on gens so he has nothing to worry about. 
---
Two people should always be working on gens while one goes to unhook. If they get thwarted, someone else goes next.
---
If the killer camps, he gets punished for it by getting gen rushed by the other 2 survivors.
---
its an actual explot or glitch, making mending like 7 minutes 
---
Yessssss!
---
It's weird that you felt some pressure to post that you don't use Ruin. I don't care, and don't know why anybody would.
---
Nice but you don't understand, I have zero blood point bonus perks, I only have wglf David, whom I hate and have no good perks for, and Laurie, whom I just don't have good perks for and almost every time I play Laurie I get face camped, along with me only having bbq&amp;c on Leatherface but I don't really like playing him. So this has been almost 4 months of bloodpoint farming just to finally get it. And I couldn't be happier
---
Well, that‚Äôs Better than only ‚Äúno‚Äù
---
Now I can think about the bad game balance or the lag switch
---
Thanks 
---
I know that, when I say you're good I meant you read their actions very easily.
---
I like to shake my head something makes me laugh in-game. I think the difference is subtle, but still there so I don't feel too bad.
---
Could you imagine scps in dbd üò±
---
Time efficiency is important, but wouldn't it still be good as it's more efficient than another teammate healing you, and doesn't require an item? And doesn't botany reduce the heal time to 26 (IDK, my math might be wrong)?
---
Yeah but that's in 2020
---
It would make Calm Spirit actually good if old crows wasn't nerfed
---
Y'know, I couldn't really explain why, either. I'm a tad hyper today. Don't mind me
---
Every game gets repetitive after a while. I will say, it's a game I constantly come back to. I used to solely play survivor (gets boring, if you buy I suggest trying both!) And I will say that survivor is infinitely more tedious than killer is. The game always has some sort of glitch, and when they fix it a new one replaces it. So be aware you aren't getting a "well made" game. It's honestly felt like were all test playing it before an actual release. 
---
With that, it's really cool to see the growth of the game, the direction the devs go each chapter. The community will either be toxic or great depending on how you choose to feel when things go wrong or when players are shitty. Toxicity attracts toxicity in the community. My honest suggestion is, if you buy it, don't go into it competitively. It's a game. The competitive aspect is where people get nasty and make the community worse, because the game isn't correctly balanced for competition. Play for fun, and don't take it too seriously, and you'll find you enjoy it a lot more than others seem to (: I don't regret buying it at all, and I've played for two and a half years. 
---
But they have to bask in the warmth of their victory, for it is a long, cold winter of sacrifices, they have to enjoy it while they can, it's a very rare occurrence.
---
How can you die *and* complete the objective? You don't think you're entitled to victory just because five generators are powered do you? 
---
Or maybe a casual/ranked queue like Siege
---
How godlike must you be?
---
I‚Äôve had something like this happen when I start spectating, I main Nea.
---
The third survivor perk is absolutely broken 
---
Streamer's name please
---
Oh goodness
---
That's an interesting project to tackle.... I'll have to look around for some good vomit particles, but yeah, sure
---
I'd be satisfied if the NOED icon just came up when it activated, instead of keeping it a mystery until the Killer gets a free down.
---
GearlessMason OMEGALUL
---
That is their devotion level
---
I play mostly killer on PS4, aside from an occasional survivor daily and I agree completely. The experience is horrible. Fps drops, lag, teleporting survivors, etc.. 
---
Plus survivors are toxic as fuck and after the game you get flooded with hate mail because you don't play the way they want you to. 
---
I stuck around because I turned off messaging and friend requests, so I don't get the endless flow of messages telling me to kill myself or calling me a racial slur (which doesn't even  match my ethnicity most of the time). 
---
I feel like you've had bad moments playing with or against other Feng Mins. That or you just really hate her character which makes us Fengs sad :(
---
Or brutal strength
---
Can't be sure if it was you or a fan uploading, so had to ask
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs only PS4 players? 
---
Preventable, but based on what? You CANNOT know if the killer has NOED or not, so it is a complete coin toss as to whether searching/doing totems is a massive waste of time or not. And EVEN then, there is no guarantee you‚Äôll get them all, especially not solo. If you, say, could cleanse 3 and negate it, fine. But 5 solo? Not at all consistently possible without potentially throwing a game completely.
---
That my friend are the real issues. 
---
This games got a serious "entitled survivor" problem. It seems like any time you play a killer, if you play well and play to your strengths and kill their entire team you get flooded with hate and threats to get you banned, but if you play how the survivors want you to play, you're pretty much blind and deaf and just spinning in circles while they mock you, then spam "GG EZ" in the lobby afterwards. You honestly can't win with killers.
---
Now the latest string of whining i hear is "you're ruining my fuuuunnnnnn!!!" (stamps feet). Now you have an entire team disconnecting because, god forbid, you did your job as the killer.
---
If they wanna fix this issue, they need to do what MMOs did to solve this. Put a penalty for disconnecting from a game. You DC because shit wasn't going your way? 30 minute penalty, you can't join another lobby for 30 minutes. Do it again? An hour. Do it a third time? You're done for the day. 
---
I definitely wouldn‚Äôt say all lol Because I‚Äôd have to include myself in that then.
---
its fasho kisame
---
Nope they have nothing in common with NOED.  Remember Me you earn by reapeatedly hitting and eventually killing your obsession prior to the doors being allowed to be opened.  Blood Warden is just flat out a funny situational perk that only works if a survivor opens up a door and chooses not to leave.  NOED is earned by playing like absolute shit and giving up all 5 of the objectives you were tasked to defend.  Do you see the difference buddy?  This was just a really weak attempt to try and defend the biggest crutch perk left in the game.
---
The description of the sub tells us to expose the persons steam id or psn. Thats literally just witchhunting
---
To add on to this: you also shouldn't be punished in three categories for survivors DCing, too.
---
Happened to me twice with Billy when he hooked me. Was nice to be him while on the hook, at least I wasn't bored staring at my teammates crouching in the corners of the map.
---
i agree, enduring 3, hell, even enduring 1 makes pallets SO much easier to deal with, it's an absolute godsend, i can just walk into those pallets and they disappear like two seconds later, even without spirit fury, they are just gone and it's like nothing ever happened and i just carry on running into those survivors, completely ignoring this thing called "pallets"
---
without it its an absolute pain tbh
---
You never put laurie
---
Where the hell did you get Kyle from?
---
I don‚Äôt hate the character, it‚Äôs just that in her lore the only thing she displays is a very toxic lifestyle. Get famous, start to lose fame, become an alcoholic, pass out in bad places (implication of lots of one night stands so ew), and finally wake up in the Entity‚Äôs world to die. For example, Dwight was a dead-end no life but he converted that negative energy into strong leadership skills in the Trial. 
---
Good guy! Didn‚Äôt use it btw I already bought her with shards
---
Uh why the hell isn't shirtless Myers getting 10s?
---
75% is being very generous. 
---
‚ÄúBuckle up, hoodhead...cause you‚Äôre goin‚Äô for a ride...‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs nice to hear these stories because match after match it never happens to me.  Always during a daily for huntress who I‚Äôm horrible as and then when I run my main Pig I never can get the same group.  It‚Äôs very unsatisfying although playing my main is quite fun.  You would be surprised at hole much hate The Pig gets.  People absolutely hate the zero terror radius and will DC just on that allow.  Cheers though for getting your bagger.  Glad you bagged them üëåüèª
---
Same, it is so good 
---
I mean, it'd be great if no one did that, but Wraith has a fairly bad rep on PS for tunneling. Can't speak for other platforms as I haven't played them.
---
I'm sorry but I never asked for the instasaves, I shouldn't be punished for what another survivor chooses to do.
---
Generator times aren‚Äôt broken that all depends on the person applying pressure on survivors 
---
I do the same thing, do whatever you want. 
---
It's pretty much the only real form of progression in DBD so you might as well. Otherwise you will get bored fast.
---
so the killer should just let you run away because why?
---
Tbh ppl get really Mad about noed and that's what makes th way they think so weird
---
Self care is a waste of perk slot if 4 man SWF 
---
If solo it is still good and almost necessary 
---
Going simply by what the wiki says about the movie, it wouldn‚Äôt really work. There‚Äôs nothing that would fit for being the killer, at least not from what I read. 
---
You outskiled them soo hard that's going in my epiccc montagg
---
This is one of the oldest arguments amongst this community and it's still wrong lol
---
/s
---
Fixed in what ways?
---
\- Gen time is fine IMO, you just need to get pressure done and they wont get fixed that fast.
---
\- Mixtape agree
---
\- Mettle of man seems fine to me too, since its basically a one time use
---
\- Insta saw - agree
---
\- insta heals are also fine for me, its also a one time use
---
My list would be:
---
\- Nurse, mainly her addons, remove extra blinks, dont let range addons stack
---
\- Prayer beads spirit needs to go or be at least an ultra rare
---
\- Iri Hatchets, its the most boring thing to play again, needs to be reworked somehow
---
\- Give the Trapper 3 traps at the start of the match on default
---
\- Give WGLF another use, not only extra points, just like BBQ does.
---
Isn't that spirit?
---
GG and I don‚Äôt mind playing against legion usually as a survivor main.  I escape sometimes, I think that a really good Freddy is harder than playing against a weak legion, you sir are not that though.
---
It's almost like real people that spend too much time on their work trying to be the very best in their field end up burning out themselves and missing out on developing a social life or a distinctive personality, making Feng Min one of the most well-written characters of the whole bunch.
---
At least he finishes the games first.
---
When Spirit first came out, I was confused as to why she was just standing on the other side of the pallet I just threw down, so I stood there and tried to have a staring contest with her, that worked out well üòÇ
---
Nurse is definitely an m1 killer. The fact that she doesn't activate MoM is a bug.
---
Dont use unrelenting pretty much ever, especially with huntress since she has an alternate attack
---
i think about this a lot actually
---
As far as I know, Iron will does not lower the sound you make from vomiting. I don‚Äôt think calm spirit affects those sounds either. 
---
On that same dime, if you found a group of players better than you you wouldn‚Äôt 4K. The skill of your opponents also matters. 
---
Think game needs so many blood points its becoming to the point that I‚Äôve stopped playing until there will be a double blood point event or an event where you can net at least 20k a match as survivor.  I can net close to 20k now but it becomes very stale.
---
Groovy
---
Dude, I am faulting the survivors for this, not killers. As killer I go after the unsafe unhooker, personally, but that's just me. 
---
I think you're mistaken and think that I'm trying to say I'm entitled to escape, but if a survivor is farming me for example it's not exactly my fault. If the killer wants an easy kill, so be it, it's still not very fair for the person being treated like that. 
---
As someone who tries to ensure safe unhooks, it'd be nice if people made those considerations for me from time to time. 
---
I know the Xbox has a player reputation system where enough reports drag your rep down and get you placed in low priority queues if the game supports it (+ other penalties like voice chat restriction, etc.).
---
IDK if DBD supports it, (I.E. low rep players are matchmade with other low-rep players) but supposedly many xbox DBD players got their reputation sunk because of knee-jerk reports. 
---
Endurings way better, you never need to respect pallets with it, brutal is only better if you do respect pallets. 
---
I see a bunch of people downvoting this but the devs themselves have literally stated on stream that Freddy won't have that ability to see global auras of sleeping survivors in his rework.
---
Not every pallet can be mindgamed
---
:nobody 
---
:Dead by daylight 
---
Y'all mind if I just die
---
been my flair
---
Whenever the killer let's me farm but then kills me I just send them a message saying thanks for letting me get some extra bp. I don't understand why survivors expect the killer to let them escape after farming. The killer wants bp too.
---
Shame I cant report this subreddit for going against reddit rules
---
Hopefully devs remove it
---
I‚Äôm not like a fan of his or anything but I do watch a video of his every now and then and I don‚Äôt really notice any drama. The only drama that ever shows up from what I‚Äôve seen is the occasional news outlet or youtuber trying to gain attention by using him. Am I missing something? 
---
There is no gen pressure on the other survivors when you're chasing someone. 
---
I would recommend spine chill for that then as it gives you a notification when the killer is looking in your direction 
---
Creatinf that will make people die on the hook on purpose
---
I use Premonition more because I can swerve my camera while doing gens to get head start on a killer and it doesn't suffer the penalties that Spine Chill has, I'm pretty bad at skill checks too so yea, safer for my team if I ran Premonition instead ü§£
---
It‚Äôs because a majority of people that do run Self Care and not aware of their surroundings and paying attention to what‚Äôs going on in the game. 
---
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm hooked in the middle of the map and the killer is chasing someone in one of the four corners. You are injured with self care and you are the closest person to me on the hook. Let‚Äôs say you heal yourself which is what 75% of players that run self care will do. There is no clear danger near either one of us. The player getting chased in the corner goes down and gets hooked. You are healed up and are coming to rescue me. At the same time the killer is heading back towards me on the hook too. You get the save and now we are both in a situation where the killer is closing in on us. Well gee, the killer don‚Äôt have Make Your Choice. So who do you think the killer is going to go after me or you ?  That‚Äôs how people with Self Care play. They don‚Äôt pay attention to how the game around them is playing out. 
---
I also notice that people with Self Care will heal when there‚Äôs an active devour Hope up, haunted grounds,  a tier 3 Michael,  iri head Huntress, a Legion, and the list goes on. 
---
Oh yeah I forgot that killers can switch each others abilities now
---
Not sure what the hesitation is from the devs on easing the perk grind. What positive function does the grind serve in this game? Something to dtrive for? "Oh I have the perks I want. Guess I'll stop playing now."- said nobody. 
---
Should've had no eyes tbh. Or just circles rather than expressive. But regardless of that change, it looks legit. :) good job. How'd you do that shading on the face?
---
That‚Äôs the main issue though, you don‚Äôt ever NEED to be healed, in the current meta it‚Äôs typically better not to heal. If you don‚Äôt focus on being healed much I can just about assure you, you‚Äôll do better. 
---
Can confirm, no. 
---
1. Gen times are fine, but the game is too fast because generators are all survivors have to do and survivors can work on 3 of them at a time while the killer can only chase 1 survivor at a time. I actually think itd be cool if the end game was fleshed out more. Make it feel like more of a climax.
---
2. Mixtape I agree on, but I also think theres a bigger issue of Legion just being badly designed.
---
3. Mettle of Man needs some changes. I though it would be fine and that the downside would keep it balanced, but it's very easy to mitigate the downside and sometimes avoid it all together.  Plus I think in the current genrush meta its not healthy for the game.
---
4. Billy with fast saw is really strong, but not as strong as it used to be with old Tinkerer. IDK about this one. 
---
5. I think purple instaheals could stay but they should be raised to ultra rare and the needles should be removed. You could even do this in coordination with modifying moris to need 2 hooks on somebody or something.
---
6. As for your last mentioning if DS. The new version is not perfect and it has the potential to punish you for really dumb things (survivor with Ds timer runs up to farm his teammate, you go after the unhooked and boom he jumps off your back). IDK what the correct path for that perk is honestly.
---
I considered using premonition but it only tells you which direction the killer is in and not of they're actually looking at you so with spine chill you can tell better which direction the killer is headed if you're experienced enough 
---
Sloppy butcher makes self care a hindrance if anything. The time you spend self caring once is the equivalent of like half a gen, even more if you spend time running somewhere "safe" to heal.
---
I'm on Ps4 too and the problem for me is using the camera to look around when I'm in a chase. It's just awkward with a controller.
---
I feel like it's almost mandatory if you're running Mettle of Man.  
---
It also looks better than the others, at least imo
---
Lmao, solid meme

The big facts
---
If Dwight's made Bubba where glasses his would be the best hands down
---
Yeah I definitely agree with that as I'm on ps4 as well. I just turned my sensitivity way up and and sacrificed flashlight accuracy but for me it's a fair trade because I can't aim flashlights very well anyways with controller lol
---
I use Premonition in case killer is chasing someone else but moving in my direction, that way I get head start as long as I'm always looking around. I reckon if killer's looking in my direction I'm pretty much already seen so I'm done for ü§£ I just like to put as muuuuuuuch distance between me and the killer at all times because I'm so horrible at escaping.
---
Thats why you need to get downs fast, so the survivors have to do something else than sitting on a generator.
---
Also slugging when there is a good opportunity helps, I dont see a lot of killers doing that. 
---
  
---
If you have one guy slugged because you saw another guy while you downed one and start chasing the other guy, someone has to stop working on a gen to pick the downed guy up. Thats makes 3 out of 4 survivors not working on a gen.

Very true, it‚Äôs like the don‚Äôt want anti slug perks to be at all strong, I don‚Äôt understand it myself.

Why am I going to spend 46 seconds healing when I can get healed by my friend with BK, find a gen and work it with PT and purple toolboxes in 30 seconds?
---
Maps
---
Gen speeds (add a secondary objective)
---
Nurse once gen times get fixed (but only then)
---
All bullshit perks (MoM, Adrenaline, Balanced DS, NOED, Rancor)
---
All bullshit items/addons (keys, toolboxes, omega blink, moris, prayer beads etc)
---
Yeah but then comes the double cross tech where you start a phase to trigger the broken glass sound and then unphase to see the survivor jumping into your waiting arms.
---
Well as long as it works for ya then keep at it boyo! Everybody has their preferences 
---
You completely ignore a large part of the fanbase is in console. No, not a small amount, a large amount because more people own consoles than gaming PC‚Äôs, in fact it will grow more when Switch gets the game. Chat simply isn‚Äôt available, though it easily should be since the game hasn‚Äôt even started yet. 
---
Are people still playing that game? lol. I always get bitched at by some gay guy who doesn't like how I play inefficiently (cause I'm bad).. Also no homophobia here. It's just usually a gay guy.
---
Corn. God damn corn. 
---
Yea! I'm still only 40 hours in the game, still getting the hang of everything so whatever works ü§£
---
Oh no doubt about it
---
I thought a^2 + b^2 = c^2
---
True but you could say the same about any killer.
---
I ran it after the recent buff before they nerfed it again. It was actually a pretty solid perk
---
Ghetto math dont @ me.   
---
Despite perhaps being a second off in a place or two it should be fairly self explainatory.
---
What do you mean by balanced DS? Old DS or current? 
---
Probably at a level where if the killer sees you, the killer is done for ü§£
---
Used this for so long. Recently it just stopped working. My game FPS is fine but OBS just keeps freezing. Tried everything. I did nothing to it just one day it stopped working. No updates overnight for anything it just broke. I downloaded older versions but no luck.
---
Listen to your heart
---
If only
---
nice white ward usage in general. /s
---
Indeed
---
Yusss! The style reminds me of Panty and Stocking, which is great!
---
Seems balanced 
---
Displayed ping*, I doubt the game would kick you if you have more than 1200.
---
I'm sorry but I'm DC'ing after the second mend.
---
sorry it just isnt worth it imo. if youre up against a swf they can commit 1 person to look while the others repair gens. yes thats 1 less player doing a gen but it doesnt slow the game enough to actually make a difference. even without a swf group people just gen tap to avoid it (even though its not that hard to hit the skillchecks unless youre against a doc). this is not to say the perk is useless i think running it with haunted grounds can be fun its just not the top tier necessary perk people make it out to be
---
Sorry to burst your bubble (just how someone burst mine ): ) but Luck only affects unhooking/untrapping yourself
---
[Sad Truth](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Luck)
---
Was released in mid 2016, the devs are incompetent.
---
Here is what I do, if I activate mom on a survivor I‚Äôm chasing, I‚Äôll immediately leave chase and hunt someone else. I can see them the rest of the game. They are screwed. Oh your looking for the hatch?  I see you, trying to make an unhook? Spotted. Use it to your advantage. 
---
We love you beanie Quentin, even if the game does not. :(
---
No mither should be a straight-up extra BP perk tbh. Right now it reduces sound while dying, and allows you to infinitely get up. But considering how you're never healed to healthy, I feel all of that is stilm not enough reason to use it.
---
You can even slug them to make them waste time and you can still see them after they get up
---
Adrenaline is balanced it doesn‚Äôt need any changes,
---
MoM is questionable and toolboxes and keys are fine the way they are. 
---
This sub in a nutshell
---

---
The drama is the one by the mainstream media, it tries to find dirt on something Pewdiepie makes a video on. A recent example is when he promoted some channels and one of them had content the mainstream media didn‚Äôt like so they  bashed both Pewdiepie and the channel for it. if Pewdiepie suddenly started playing dbd the mainstream media would probably do the same thing to bring unwanted attention to both bhvr and Pewdiepie which could drive investors away. 
---
Like when sprint burst meg farms me when wraith is uncloaking next to the hook.
---
Yea this happened to our friends last night, super unfun we ended up just dc'ing since the killer can keep you hostage if you mend by just repeatedly forcing everyone to mend
---
"i think we've done a pretty good job so far"
---
this couldn't be any closer to the truth 
---
Sorry forgot the comma between the two, I meant Balanced Landing (due to the infinites it creates, especially on Haddonfield) and new DS (Because you can still get struck by it even when you werent tunnelling, and its still a second chance perk, which I loathe).
---
Yeah.  Self-Care is far from optimal, but if there's one thing you can count on in Solo, it's your teammates being potatoes.
---
U right
---
~~Totally didn't read that image and think I was on r/katawashoujo~~
---
4 some reason this reminds me of wwe. Have Kane or Undertaker be a killer
---
Yea, I'll run Selfcare with Botany if using a toolbox.  Or just Botany by itself so long as I bring a decently charged up medkit that can get me 2+ heals.
---
Selfcare is slow, but it is "time efficient" compared to having someone else heal you up and then working on a gen together, due to the fact the multi-person speed redux is working again.  Although if they got a yellow bar, I'll happily let them heal me.

"JuSt RuN sMaLl GaMe"
---
Did you read anything I just said? The other two perks require you to set them up particularly Remember Me which you really have to go out of your way to earn.  NOED is the majority of the time not ran as an endgame build and is instead paired with meta perks affecting midgame like Ruin which is designed to drag out a game not get to the endgame at all.  Also BBQ, Enduring etc...it's brought along to serve as a safety net to crutch out that well deserved no skill down at the end.  Swf can take out 5 dulls reliably.  Solo queue cannot reasonably take them all out.  I've taken out 4 myself to get rocked with it still countless times.  I've seen you around here all you do is defense camping. Tunneling, Noed basically all the worst aspects of the killer community.  The game is well balanced for killers at this point and NOED is quite sad to still run at this point. It's simply not needed but you keep beating that babykiller support drum and long as you want brosef.
---
He's still going up, man. I think we'll see 600 by tomorrow evening
---
sMall GamE iS aN ExCElLenT pErK
---
Honestly if it‚Äôs console players they have full rights to complain about doc, unless he isn‚Äôt as bad on console as he can be on pc in terms of frame drops. 
---
It‚Äôs ironic
---
Self-care often takes forever (so many killers run Sloppy Butcher).  I find looking for your teammates or just playing injured more helpful.  I'd save the shards and loot chests for medkits if you're concerned about being injured.  Also, I agree that you may want to level up Claudette.  None of her perks are bad.  Basically, Claudette and Meg both have a great perk kit, so you cannot go wrong by leveling them up.
---
They actually tend to do this. You can just laugh knowing that 2 people means they'll just keep stalling the gen if they can't get skillchecks. More often than not, after a few seconds it goes back to red, but someone is likely to still be there. Even if they don't both work on it, you've already found them.
---
A very *very* glitched out survivor, probably feng min. 
---
Just play bY yOuRsElF and get into a lobby faster 
---
I haven't noticed frame drops when playing on PC but then again I rarely even see him nowadays. Have to watch out for that next I see one.
---
That would be interesting for DbD2. 2 killers, 8 survivors, 15 gens, 10 totems, 2 exit gates, Bp cap at 10mil at current costs. 
---
OMG that's nightmare fuel.
---
Wonder if your survivors saw it too
---
I was thinking of the rocks but I had first formed that opinion early in the clip.  You were crouching after running to a pallet.  You went beyond the pallet, turned around, and began to crouch.  Your initial crouch had your feet (and I think part of your leg too) out there.
---
Alright thanks for clarifying
---
I dont get the ppl who dont hook. They're just trying to he dicks. Had a freddy game the other night he had knockout and was trying to slug everyone we kept healing. All 4 people escaped and he dc'd so he didnt get any points but we all survived. game took like 25 mins.
---
Put on NOED so that survivors send you ddos threats 
---
First off
---
Do the tutorial
---
Second
---
The itwms help but arent mandatory soo if you feel your losing too many items dont bringthem
---
And whatmotivates me for example is having the chance to winand seeking thoose little fun moments in dbs
---
&gt; Especially when they cheat to know EXACTLY where you are, no matter what. 
---
If the Legion is in Killer Instinct, as long as you are within the Terror Radius they can see your general location via a Beating Heart effect. Since this effect isn't an aura it works when you're in a locker.
---
As for the rest, I'm sorry you've had bad experiences with the Legion. Feral Frenzy is very weird and it can break the game in a variety of ways, but it's part of the game for now.
---
The best to deal with us Legions is to prolong chases as long as possible, focus on generators rather than healing outside of chase, and try to take advantage of our inability to see scratchmarks while Frenzying.
---
If it makes you feel any better, Legion *is* getting a rework eventually.
---
Jane is stacked baby
---
Eh play whoever you want, it's a game where there is a "win/lose" scenario. I dont really have any tips for him other than inflict as much deep wound as possible then go for the last one you hit for a down if possible. I only really play him for the dailies and the zooming over pallets and windowsüòÇ I never get any kills but it's fun to try and beat a survivor to a window so I can vault first and they usually dont know what to do because I just wanted to win the race
---
This happened to me before. The Legion player let me escape. They‚Äôre not all had people guys. 
---
So... why does everyone heal? Y‚Äôall say I shouldn‚Äôt heal but we both are still healing.
---
Killer mains don‚Äôt even realize how much they give away their totem spawns 
---
I like to run BBQ, Distressing, Overcharge, and Ruin. I throw Distressing in there just because I don't really need a Fourth perk since Billy is really good just at his core, so ya might as well get some more blood points. 
---
32k with teachable on Freddy. For once a screenshot of an end result actually impressed me. Good job.
---
Also is there anything I should try to get via Shrine of Secrets or by upgrading?
---
No biggy, I know reposting‚Äôs a problem so I always try to save my files and sketches for proof.
---
It's fun for a second but chases are where it's at for me in this game.  If you like chases, then P3ing Claudette will not be worth it.  If you enjoy crouching and not doing much but blending, then P3ing will be worth it for you.
---
that is not a bug
---
And that's ridiculous because why?
---
I had to play mind games with a spirit during this
---
Urban evasion saved my ass
---
Uhh... I‚Äôll be 2 minutes.
---
No worries.  You're fairly competent out of the comments I made and I'd be happy to have you on my team if I was in solo queue.
---
Licensed killers though
---
Me too, for Christ‚Äôs sake I‚Äôm a David main, of course imma run No Mither. You kinda answered the big question no? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost far too many matches to it.‚Äù People heal so they don‚Äôt t die. Healing is necessary and I don‚Äôt see why you shouldn‚Äôt.
---
Legion he's notable for being a fun killer to play against and to play 
---
Mettle of Man, one of Ash's new perks.
---
Yo who gave this silver
---
Is that sarcasm ? I‚Äôve seen some comments around saying legion is cancer and after experiencing 2 legions last night it wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of fun 
---
Just play whichever killer that interests you. 
---
Yea lol 
---
They both interest me so I‚Äôm trying get some inside opinions 
---
I use to have a pretty janky build on my pc and ran the game at around 30-40 FPS on a good day and doc nuked my frames down to 10 or less. I still see some drops but nothing that serious. 
---
The boomer, it would‚Äôve just been the plague but cooler.
---
I think being the most used survivor perk counts as being part of the meta.
---
want removed:
---
- Ormond
---
- Adrenaline
---
- ebony mori
---
want reworked: 
---
- hatch
---
- Billy
---
- Legion
---
Remove Nurse period.
---
Huntress needs to not be able to recover instantly from throwing an axe, it's drop dead fucking OP she can hit you twice in under a couple seconds.
---
Looping is not fair, fix that, but remove exhaustion from the game.
---
lunging giving a speed boost is fucking unreasonable. especially since it gives killers full control and range of movement. if they have full control of their swing and their base movement speed is faster, they don't need a lunge.
---
What does nurse run? I swear survivors outrun my nurse lol
---
No no, you misunderstood. I don‚Äôt heal because I‚Äôve lost matches because of it. The time spent healing can typically be better spent on gens or something.
---
I should have worded it better. 
---
Main Build:     
---
BBQ, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Unrelenting   
---
Drift Build:    
---
Iron Maiden, Nurses, Fire-Up, Brutal Strength    
---
    
---
I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd use Tinker, Bitter and Surveillance all together. That seems good for info but it‚Äôs a bit overkill. Plus Billy has good map coverage so you can get to the gens fast enough anyways to check manually. Unrelenting/Enduring are great together to force people to drop pallets. Maybe do Unre, Tinker, Edur, Bitter until you can possibly swap Bitter for BBQ.
---
Alright thanks for more of these tips but for clarification I was rank 9 but then reset hit
---
Also, it‚Äôs not like I never heal, I just don‚Äôt do it unless the situation calls for it, which in my experience isn‚Äôt very often.
---
DCing depips twice and I‚Äôm actually good against nurse
---
If you play solo it's pretty tough to rank up. The emblem system is pretty busted right now. Some games I've done saves, heals, chases and gens and barley safety pipped. Other games I've done only gens and nothing else and almost double pipped. I've sat at rank 8 now for about a week, Mainly because every other game starts as a 3v1 or has 1 or 2 dcs mid game (intentional or not) and ends with -1 pip. Good luck.
---
I see you are a man of culture
---
The fun in this game for survivor comes from two places for me.  One I love the bloodweb progression system and amassing the various perks, prestiging my characters etc...I grew up on rpg games so this mechanic feels very fun and familiar for me.  Gameplay wise it is all about getting to the point where you can have long fun as shit chases against killers.  Executing clutch ass plays to save that random against the facecamp feels awesome.  Just stick with it man.  Provided you can actually get a queue it's a fun game. 
---
Gen rush...yep shame they dc'd
---
That‚Äôs the same dude you asked the question to^
---
If wraith wasn‚Äôt designed to invisi-camp and tunnel you then why would he be able to cloak and have no heartbeat /s
---
It's all up to opinion if you like being a toxic weiner then yes he's the best killer if not and you have a soul then don't play him 
---
unless they remove Nurse, I don't play this game for fun anymore.
---
Until they fix the huntress ranged axe exploit I don't play for fun anymore.
---
I will always loop, and abuse, and do whatever it takes to be as toxic as humanly possible until they resolve these easily fixable issues.
---
Bro cover the names
---
The worst part is the killer lost two pursuits and we were still able to knock that out in under a minute. (Red Rank btw) 
---
Healing doesn‚Äôt take to long. Only time I don‚Äôt heal is when it‚Äôs sloppy and all I have is Self Care. Any other time is a go. I can count on my hands how many times I‚Äôve been downed when healing. I feel like you are just unlucky or heal at really bad times and places.
---
Lying to yourself doesn't make you better.
---
Meh it happens...
---
Okay maybe decent against them but still
---
Then they sent me hate mail. What a strange community 
---
That legion line made me laugh  
---
Yep
---
I live to please
---
What's a pog?
---
I gOtTa UsE mEtA pErKs EvErY rOuNd No MaTtEr WhAt
---
What does this have to do with dbd?
---
Plague is all around better and more interesting, but she really needs perks to help with pallets like Enduting, Brutal Strength, Spirit Fury
---
I honestly worry that that isn't using it enough, but I can certainly understand where you're coming from. I just can't find it in me to actively engage until I'm set up to cut chases short. 
---
Pretty much a personal conduct, though: I'm never without at least one trap. It's useful in pretty much every situation to have one, from ensuring safe pickups at Pallets to shifting traps around as needed. 
---
Are those perk teachable from other killers ?
---
I swear WGLF is the rarest perk in the bloodweb
---
Is that KYF?
---
I never self heal, it‚Äôs a death sentence for the team unless you‚Äôre playing for hatch. 
---
I had a hard time getting into the game at 1st as well. It wasn't until I figured what perks to go for and once I got them that the game got more fun for me. 
---
As someone newish to the game I found urban evasion &gt;sprint burst &gt;self mend are the perks that me feel more comfortable playing survivors. 
---
Of course having those 3 perks on one survivor is gonna take some time to level. So I started of with Nea Karsson. I found Urban Evasion helped me avoid killers and survive a lot more than playing other survivors at first. Her balanced landing perk also gives a nice speed burst when jumpin of high places. After Nea I leveled up Meg Thomas for sprint burst over Claudette because Sprint burst is a teachable at 35 over self care at 40.
---
yeah
---
enduring - hillbilly
---
brutal strength - trapper
---
spirit fury - spirit
---
Thanks :) 
---
Before 2.6.0 I would've been a lot less sympathetic, but now I feel your pain. It's even worse when the killer has Enduring and rushes you down anyway. 
---
It depends with Laura, maybe she could travel whilst underground and she leaves trails of blood when she's under.
---
She was fucking terrifying the first time I played the game.
---
enduring and spirit fury synergize really well
---
Is it worth the 2 slots though ? 
---
Awesome! I like the idea of Overcharge, I think tho as I face better players, Overcharge will kind of be useless simply because players will be better at landing skill checks. Still on the grind for Ruin and waiting for BBQ to be in the Shrine but I‚Äôll add those when I get them!
---
It's 100% worth the 2 slots
---
Actually, it's from the All Star music video, which is basically Mystery Man self-insert fanfic anyway.

---
0 Consequences? That is a complete lie.  Here is a consequence to doing gens injured. If the Killer comes over and hits you then you go down with only 1 hit.
---
I only read like 1/3rd of it it was still talking about another game and then I realised it was one solid long wall and skipped to comments... hoping for a summary.
---
They nerfed ds and should now nerf noed. Noed is the old ds of killers. Free kill  just like survivors got a free escape from the killer.  
---
That could work yet again spirit has a very similar power.
---
One correction due to a huge oversight...
---
5. Myers: Why is his shirt still on? Why do we all call him daddy?
---
I Amanda confuzzled. 
---
Fair...
---
Pig main here. Why do people do that? They went working on gens. Leave them alone
---
Here is the Killer Flow Chart:
---
1)Complain about Sprint Burst to Get it Nerfed (Check)
---
2)Complain about Self Care to Get it Nerfed (Check)
---
3)Complain about Decisive to Get it Nerfed (Check)
---
4)Complain about Adrenaline to Get it Nerfed
---
5)Complain about Mettle of Man to Get it Nerfed
---
6)Complain about Balanced Landing to Get it Nerfed
---
The mindset is quite simple.  By focusing only on the same target, especially when they are still injured after being unhooked, you are pretty much saying that person does not get to play the game.  People will argue until this game is long forgotten as to if it is acceptable or not.  
---
I dunno about your gameplay points, I have no strong opinion on Freddy other than finding him difficult to go against, but suddenly appearing out of a window that a survivor is running to doesn't fit Freddy's lore?
---
Thankfully it was just a generator THIS time ;)

Finding Keys in Chests is like a 1% chance

!remindme 1 day
---
I like to play like this : 
---
* Deep wound as many as you can, the goal is 4 people in deep wound at all times.
---
* Walk after one of the survivors normally, only frenzy if caught in loop.
---
* After you get that survivor, go back to hunting others. 
---
When you  get that first stab, I like to turn around and start slashing away at nothing, so I can see the weird red "I'm right here" thing the legion naturally has, and then use it to find other survivors to get as many as I can in deep wound. If everyone is wounded, which is best case scenario, then it's hunting time, just go slaughter them as you see fit.
---
Remember, it's okay to drop a chase if nothing happens after a long enough time. If a survivor keeps looping you, frenzy that jerk and get em down. If they are looping you and the others are close enough that you can see them, go over and try to get at least one in deep wound, then try to get the one who was running you.   
---
This is how I play, it may not work for you, but I thought my 2 cents may help out in some way :) 
---
Before DLC, After DLC.
---
Generally I won‚Äôt tunnel If given the choice, but If you‚Äôre the only one I find then that‚Äôs unfortunate but I‚Äôm not gonna spare you for it.

Run
---
I see... I mean, maybe not. lol
---
Never trust a killer
---
This makes sense. I‚Äôm not trying to go after the same person, but if I find you, and you‚Äôre basically a free down without a chase, why would I spare you? At least that‚Äôs what I think about it. There‚Äôs also the scenario where I hook a survivor and another one immediately takes them off the hook when I‚Äôm justen after feet away. Of course I down the injured one and put them back on the hook, it just makes sense. I get called a tunneler for this too.
---
Thanks
---
Yes, no but it's a bug, yes 
---
Oh I know. I've seen plenty of streamers lose their minds over this game. I just wasn't expecting such a lack toxic behavior. 
---
And I know I'll never get to that level, so no worries. Ha.
---
My flair, dude......
---
I have been non-ironically liking No Mither for some time now. It makes insta-down abilites like EW3, Iri Hatchets, Plague (normal) vomit (kinda), red finger, and various other moves redundant. 
---
You may argue that you'd get down in one hit regardless, which is true, but you always have access to Dead Hard (which you should always be running with No Mither)
---
In addition, with resiliance, you are always 9% faster, including vaulting windows which can allow you to loop longer in some aspects.
---
Also hard counters slugging. Killers are forced to hook you, or be annoyed that you pop up every 30 seconds.
---
Is No Mither good? Hell no. It's bad. But I love it for being bad.
---
Some people equate equipping NOED with ‚Äúlosing the game‚Äù and I never got that mentality. This game is all about the cat and mouse aspect of hunting and avoiding and for some reason people think getting the gates powered equals winning when the entire concept of crushing hope at its highest point is the most satisfying victory. 
---
Endgame builds are easily the most satisfying builds to use because it preys on the one thing players rely on most: the hope of victory towards the goal. 
---
Obscura is a little big isn‚Äôt it, I think we‚Äôll need a humanoid considering there is not one that isn‚Äôt in dbd but you know that could change but I doubt it. 
---
It‚Äôs not how his powers work at all. His current power is the most accurate representation of him as it currently is. Is it perfect? No.
---
Going against Freddy can be difficult, but most Freddy players are easy to predict. As I said, Freddy isn‚Äôt the most viable at higher ranks. I started playing Freddy in order to learn to counter him better and it has improved my gameplay against him. 
---
As I and others said before, your idea is a rip off combination of two other killers. Nurse, and Hag. They wouldn‚Äôt choose a rework like this because it doesn‚Äôt make sense and is a reskin. 
---
bet someone DC'd because s/he didn't want to deal with Huntress, and how the other ones were in disadvantage, gave up and DC'd as well. yeah, it happens a lot
---
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt wait even a second before prestiging when I hit level 50? I just get too excited lol
---
Well. I have a could of hours in this game (800 ballpark)  and actually only ONCE thought someone was actually using wallhacks. Thats probably how rare those actually are. 
---
I play Freddy with only 1 Perk.
---
I use NOED, Blood Warden, Remember me and Fire Up.... 
---
Everbody dies before the gates are powered
---
Was the killer a hag?
---
This is actually leaked gameplay for the Switch port, hope the mods don‚Äôt remove it.
---
Yeah I just learned about it recently when one meg looped me on it and I was just like 'Hol up'
---
thought this was the doom cover 
---
I usually just slug them. 
---
Here‚Äôs why: 
---
1) I know how it feels to be tunneled 
---
2) a person on the ground isn‚Äôt very useful (no gens)
---
3) someone has to come and pick them up (rarely does anyone use unbreakable anymore). That‚Äôs at least 2 people not doing gens and allowing me to chase the others off gens and get maximum hook points.
---
4) also they are less likely to DC
---
I rarely tunnel unless the survivor was toxic to me. I like to play sportsmans-like... dbd is a community and you‚Äôll see the same people again (maybe they‚Äôll take it easy on me when the roles are reversed lol).
---
I disagree with most of this. Especially the claim that self care isn‚Äôt meta.
---
Preach
---
&gt; 0 Consequences? That is a complete lie. Here is a consequence to doing gens injured. If the Killer comes over and hits you then you go down with only 1 hit.
---
Being injured isnt scary at all, especially when theres 2 or less gens left. Unless the killer has a stealth ability the survivors will be able to get to a safe area before the killer can take advantage of their being injured.
---
I've never had   a problem with moris. I've been fine with getting morid because i like the animation
---
I still dont want a 1% chance to lose, its bullshit when it happens. If the killer had a 1% chance to instantly kill 3 survivors everyone would call that bull shit.
---
I dont care what anyone says. It is well deserved for survivors exploiting infinites, tbagging even when they are at the gate and don't leave until you go to them, ds, and old flashlights.
---
This is a perfect example of that ‚ÄúMeyers wouldn‚Äôt understand or appreciate your sexualization of him‚Äù post
---
there's not much toxicity on poopy ranks cause people there don't know how to yet 
---
*shrug*
---
Is is fair that I find it almost toxic to chase people with the rbt on already? Dont get me wrong if you find them again it's fine but hunting them down in my opinion is really unfair to the survivor, I get why people do it just feels cheap to me.
---
Lol wait northen or southern summer?
---
"Blackface" doesn't just mean the act of making your face a black colour. It refers to the racist, stereotypical character of Blackface from old Minstrel shows with the black face, giant lips, and 'exaggerated blackness'. 
---
Couldn't disagree more.  Being in an injured state where you can only go down in 1 hit is super scary unless the Killer you are playing against is the ultimate potato.
---
It's one thing to kill the unhooked person because they're right there and so are you. I usually just slug them because I'm aiming to reduce the number of Survivors tickling gens, so if you slug the injured survivor and chase the unhooker you guarantee 2 of them aren't on gens. A 3rd will probably go get the slugged Survivor up so now you only have 1 on a gen.
---
However, dropping whatever you're doing to go back to a hook specifically to down the injured Survivor again is proper tunneling. It's when you only target one person until they're dead. It's understandable why Survivors complain about this, but beyond that, it's a really inefficient way to play Killer, because you're essentially giving 3 other Survivors free reign to gen rush you. 
---
&gt; It is way less than 1%.
---
You just said it was 1%, so I was going off that lmao
---
&gt; -1% Chance to Find a Key + 10% Chance to Find Hatch without it being open and making Noise + Under 1% Chance of other teammates being near you if you open the Hatch
---
Where the fuck are you getting these percentages from lmao. I doubt you have tested this enough times to find the correct percentages.
---
The fact of the matter is, no matter how low the chances is, the survivors should not have this RNG chance to escape.
---
Yeah, it would help if there was another hex perk that activated the same way as NOED.
---
For example, remove the speed boost from NOED, then make a new endgame Hex perk with the speed boost, that also briefly blocks exits when you get within 20 meters of them. Maybe a third one that disables all survivor perks. And also a fourth one that's terrible and nobody uses.
---
Now there's a consistent incentive to cleanse dull totems. Then can even justify a loading-screen tip suggesting that new players cleanse dull totems. And also, now cleansing 4/5 totems can still be beneficial, since it blocks all but one of their endgame hexes, if they're running several.
---
It's easier if you learn to anticipate Overcharge, especially after the first time it happens--you're a survivor and you can afford mistakes like that. DS comes at you very fast, though, it feels like, as well as in a deeply stressful situation. 
---
Not to mention, if the killer has Unnerving... well, you're boned either way. Overcharge and Unnerving on a Worldwide Doc... those skill checks are nearly impossible. 
---
bless you hero
---
What does the difference between console and PC players have to do with anything? 
---
Pre game chat...
---
Always get as close as possible to a survivor when revving up your chainsaw, if they‚Äôre about to vault a window or a pallet just use your main weapon.
---
I can see your point, but the way I look at is... the survivor might still see it as having hope. Instead of being tunneled and hooked... they still have the opportunity to escape, get points, pip, etc.
---
Plus I don‚Äôt get any salt about it when i do it. Usually it‚Äôs the potato survivor as bait or the person who just got farmed.
---
But I guess you are just one of those people who would just rather be tunneled and killed right away lol. The more you know.
---
‚ÄúMaybe if a make a snarky chart, I can neg killers into not running NOED...‚Äù
---
Kinky plan, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll work.
---
Here's a bit of advice--when you miss a great with Ruin up, let go of the Gen for about two seconds. You'll be able to stack your progress a little better and you'll avoid potentially having to try and hit a skill check while the generator's still sparking. 
---
True, it's just extra stealth for when you're insideous basement camping, clever
---
Yes
---
There's been a weird amount of circlejerks about my posts recently, but you could reply to me directly if you have something of substance to say, I don't bite I swear 
---
I disagree, its not down to the killer being a potato, its the survivor. If the survivor is good, then they will be able to waste the killers time enough for gens and adren to pop.
---
Its just so he can say the N word
---
If you're a Hag you can hardly see anyway 
---
OHHHHHHH
---
That‚Äôs probably because you play in a fun way for both sides.
---
Usually the people who complain about toxicity are camping killers and tunnelers who ruin the fun of others without giving a fuck and then expect to get love and praises..
---
It's such a weak effect, it's barely worth the trouble
---
Man, you dont know HOW long i've wanted that
---
Find wires inside crates (not chests) and fix the exit gates, with each exit gate needing 2 wires each XD.
---
i bet you main Billy
---
That‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt actually ‚ÄúLeave the hook‚Äù you‚Äôre patrolling it and waiting like a dumbass for the unhook. A good killer never goes back to the hook, he is too busy chasing another survivor.
---
It could happen now
---
Sometimes I regret not prestiging back in the day when you got the fire skin.
---
I know that, I'm actually pretty good at hitting great skill checks anyway, it's just psychological.
---
So you're wrong 
---
Reduce the cooldown to 60 seconds and this is better than headon. 
---
Not really sure who would work who isn't too similar to current killers. Stefano maybe 
---
Yeeee
---
Thats what I mean by perks kinda pay to win. You can pay to get them almost instantly, or you can wait, and grind for them in the shrine. If you are lucky.
---
you're right sorry. i've been kind of annoyed today
---
Whenever you can try and learn the maps and the best way to chainsaw sprint around them. Steering addons are alright but you should get the hang of not using them first. Decreased charge time addons are your best friend and I find far more useful. Practice being able to hold a charge also, I‚Äôve seen a lot of Billy‚Äôs just wiff being able to hold a charge and it costs them. When you‚Äôre close to someone like another person said is when you‚Äôre gonna take them down the easiest, survivors are gonna watch for that and try and juke or 360 you. If you‚Äôre holding your charge you can whip around and get them easy, as they‚Äôre relying on you to just use it and charge off straight ahead. Billy was my first killer I mastered and I ran him with 0 addons and still do most of the time because he‚Äôs very strong.
---
When was this a thing? I just played last week on my days off and the dumbass killer left the match 1 minute in thinking we were SWF (we weren't) and I lost pips. Normally whenever they left you'd not lose anything but this was a first. So what you're saying and what I saw last week has me confused what was actually changed. 
---
This is true
---
Yeah tru I got legion and leveled him to 40 instantly.
---
The wiggle bar as soon as the game begins
---
BP is winning 
---
Damn you say it and get upvotes I say it and get downvotes
---
I heard that Blumhouse was currently negotiating some kind of deal involving a video game and the new Halloween film, so we might *possibly* get Old Man Myers and Survivalist Laurie skins eventually 
---
I said one of the best, and technically you can grind for her if you wanted with the auric cells. It takes forever but that way is still free
---
That would be nice. Personally I enjoy the way Laurie looked in the Rob Zombie remake, and would like to see it possibly. Laurie is my favorite survivor so I am slightly biased, but I still reside with Tapp and Quentin. 
---
what? Nurse is free.
---
It‚Äôs an addon and not lore.
---
Dmoood! I love this! Sad to see all the shitty lowlife homophobes swamping this, but I love this with my whole heart! Keep on keepin' on!
---
No point. You‚Äôve proved time and time again that you can say only ‚ÄúNOED is balanced‚Äù. Yes, you mince words sometimes, but their sense stays the same.
---
Ah my bad if she is, was thinking she was one you could get with 9000 points? Either way I dont think its pay to win if hillbilly is free and nurse too
---
it kinda does
---
So, really there is no reason to immediately buy any DLC for DBD. Any none licensed character you can get through playing the game via shards. I think the devs said it takes about 40 hours of gameplay to unlock a character for free. So I suggest just playing through enough to see if you like the game even when it‚Äôs at it‚Äôs worst before you sink any extra cash into it.
---
The game has some bad eggs but honestly the whole ‚Äúomg toxic killer‚Äù or ‚Äútoxic survivors‚Äù is pretty blown out of proportion. You‚Äôll get games with shitheads like anyone else but it‚Äôs not as common as they‚Äôd have you belief and griefing in DBD doesn‚Äôt even begin to approach how genuinely harmful grieving can be in MMOs or FPSs. Just keep playing and learn the meta, deal with shitty bad manner killers and asshole survivor squads when they happen. If you still like the game, I say get Leatherface and put the bloodpoints in him for BBQ and rank up David for WGLF. It‚Äôll make the grind a lot less tedious once you have those perks. Then decide if presitiging your characters is worth it to you, if you do wanna sink the time in for that, only buy cheap things in the blood web. 
---
Otherwise enjoy the game!
---
ah i was just jokingly correcting you. thing about Billy is that he still can be countered with pallets and windows. he is definitely high tier but can't be god tier like Nurse. i'd assume her as an equivalent of pay-to-win but she's free. 
---
I mean, I think it stops mattering when the person starts wear ACTUAL faces. :P
---
Its pay to skip grinding.
---
don't compare Plague with Wraith and Freddy (i know you didn't but still) since she has the same playstyle as Clown and Huntress. players who know how to play them, will get 2-3k with ease. some killers aren't made for the same player. 
---
Pipping nothing to dis. Run around killer, do 1.5 gen, escape. Get 13k BP. 
---
Im sure she'll be on someone's head
---
The pig suddenly became the 5th survivor.
---
Wait... This.... is a very good question
---
Crouching repeatedly to piss someone off. It originally started off in the Halo series (god bless Halo).
---
Hagitha
---
When playing pig i get patrolling the boxes and keeping people off of them but yea put your efforts elsewhere although throwing one survivor on the hook is a good way of baiting another survivor out
---
I've always been rank 1 as survivor by the end of the first week after rank reset, and I'd be rank 1 or 2 for the whole season.
---
Right now I'm rank 7 and I keep getting matched with potato killers with absurd builds. Still even if I escape I usually don't pip because either the killer doesn't hook anyone or I don't do enough gens/ chases since either the killer chases me most of the match or I do gens the whole match.
---
I'd rather be slugged than hooked in this scenario 
---
Why you ask? Well the simple answer is I completely forgot the exposed status existed. I am not what you would call a smart person
---
By looking at the BPs i can say everyone enjoyed the game, well done! 
---
Try watching game play from her and she how good players play her and try to replicate that. 
---
Ehhh..... Never played video games, it's when you crouch repealtdely by spamming the ctrl button, to Taunt other players, it's a dick move but it's fun to piss off people from it
---
My opinion is if you're getting angry from a character of a game pressing a button twice
---
STOP playing games 
---
I find most of the totems this way hahaha
---
Oink
---
Yeah they just randomly happen. I had played several matches earlier and nothing ever happened like that. That struggle bar remained throughout the entire match, even when I was on the hook.
---
Cock
---
Maybe make it so it can only be activated once per person and lower the time? So as to not punish the same teammates repeatedly just for trying to help.
---
i couldn't snap out people form dreamworld x\_X
---
Teachable perks are unlocked at 30/35/40 for each killer/survivor. They then have a chance at appearing on every other killer/survivors bloodweb. You can get teachable perks up to tier 3 on everyone. Wraith is bad because he really doesn‚Äôt do anything well and his invisibility doesn‚Äôt have a terror radius which means his map control/pressure is really bad. He also doesn‚Äôt have any power to help him in chases like the top tier killers do. The biggest problem with Wraith imo is people doing gens before you can get a hook. One of the best perks in the game is called Ruin which is exclusive to Hag until 40 I believe. It‚Äôs a hex perk so it‚Äôs spawns on a totem but it will help you slow down gen progress early game. Other than that you want BBQ and Chili which is a Cannibal teachable after level 35. This perk is probably the most common in the game because of its bloodpoint boost. It‚Äôs quite a grind to make a good killer build. I‚Äôd recommmed using Cannibal first because he‚Äôs a good beginner killer, he‚Äôs top tier, and he gets you one of the best perks in the game.
---
Would you have any suggestions to help make it better for both sides? Maybe lower the time to 10/20/30 or instead of breaking them just injuring them and having it only activate after a certain amount of time? 
---
I'll be honest it's not something I would ever expect in the game, just wanted to try and have a bit of fun with the idea.
---
Ah damn I'm looking to buy on PS4, that seems like a bit of a bummer
---
Yeah I definitely think NOED is in a good spot, I could let you finish your conversation about me of you'd like or if be happy to talk about it and hear you out. 
---
Mother: Did you brush your teeth boy!?
---
Son: Yes Mother, I did I promise.
---
Mother: You lie, let me check.
---
Sometimes, as survivor you spawn in and there's a giant ass version of yourself that you're walking inside of. I've never seen it from this perspective but, as a survivor, you can hardly see what you're doing unless you're on a gen. And, if you unhook someone, giant versions of them ALSO fill your screen until they begin an action. Console is perfectly fine üòÖ
---
I actually just do it just in case they rework prestiging.
---
That is the wrath of every survivor killed by NOED, come back for revenge.
---
Yeah... You had to put Adam as the Survivor otherwise you would have been accused of being racist , Tipical adjective 
---
Nurse rework when?
---
That's not whaT happened kdiot
---
Ohh bud the hoarde is coming to scream at you  , you better get your apologies ready
---
I mainly play on PS4 and I‚Äôve had the game for 8 months. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm good but I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm bad. I‚Äôm okay at the game. It just takes a while to get good and it just depends on the person.
---
Honestly I don't think there is such thing as pay to win with DBD. Every trapper in the game can 4k easily. Killer isn't easy but it is the easiest it has ever been with the current meta/perks available. Back in 2016 pallets were doubled and perks were 1/2 as good as they are now. Again not saying killer is EASY but its the easiest it has been.
---
It's tempting to power through with one other person and Prove Thyself. Once you reveal you have discordance though that's when totem hunting gets serious.
---
I take your point, but the requiremets to pip in the higher ranks are kind of absurd. There often just isn't enough points available for more than one or 2 survivors to pip.
---
imagine getting this triggered
---
Yes. Sorry for the late reply.

Most players would DC before the first mend
---
Does Sloppy affect mend times?
---
I always like BBQ.  You get a minor tracking perk with lots of BP.  However, if you need help tracking, then Whispers (only at level 3) cannot be beaten.  Ruin slows down the game in a big way.  So, I'd probably go with BBQ and Ruin.  If you need help tracking, then Whispers and Ruin.
---
Yeah same here.   
---
I've been playing for a little over a month -although i do main killer -   but I play survivor too and struggle a lot with controls and camera. I must have around 70 hours survivor playtime and I recently realized that I wasn't really even turning the camera to look back during. That's how bad I am. So I'm now learning how to "s" and I really find it so hard. :/  
---
What I can say is that - in my experience - you have improved, maybe at a slower rate that other players, but really depends on the background I think. Some players have played other games with similar controls and will just get it quicker. I suggest you start recording your games if you can, then one month from now you can compare how you were vs how you'll be then. I've been doing that and it works even though it's hard to tell in game. 
---
Fucking love Myers. Probably going to play him and only him as I max out my killers. The best part by far is jump scaring people with him and you can tell when you do it. I got messaged earlier by a kid saying I need to pay for his hospital visit because I scared him so bad. Monitor and Abuse on him gives him no terror radius at EW1 and you will make people literally shit themselves.
---
The Legion: I dont use Frank's mixtape

I've been doing this a lot,it really works! 
---
Do you have any suggested perks to run on Billy? 
---
Unrelenting is useless and noed doesn't work for hatchets
---
You spelled the perk wrong, its "NO MOTHER".
---
Or at least that what people call me after game when I take the perk.
---
Freddy could have the syringe gloves.
---
Oh again, seems like they haven‚Äôt learned anything from launch XD
---
i had a trapper today RQ after i got his ruin totem, its not just survivors. 
---
Yeah, for survivors, I'm not sure. I'd say it's "pay-to-struggle" with the colorful cosmetics, but then I think of that popular Claudette loadout with brown clothing that blends in too damm well. Are those auric-only cosmetics?
---
figures. didn't mind them either first couple months. but then you hit red ranks, and then you're rank 1 every season, and then every god damn rank reset you are getting hit with a bunch of fukin ebony mori Huntresses with Iridescent Heads or instachainsaw Billies or omega blink Nurses(don't know why but before Legion these three used to use ebony more than anyone else). i get it you might not mind moris but most people prefer bloodpoints to mori animation, i am a bp whore, literally only two reasons why i don't camp/tunnel is because i love my perfect 4x8k. 
---
though Devour Hope moris i fukin love. because first of all means killer already did 5 hooks plus to that didn't camp and most likely didn't tunnel. that's a fukin deserved pleasure of killing someone. i god damn respect those killers. personally i hate the change to Devour because i used to use tier 1 hex just for a sneaky mori, was damn fun. 
---
She did? 
---
Bamboozle best perk in the game. You can't change my mind.
---
No Homo
---
This is pretty much how I feel about tunneling. As you said, tunneling is actually an inefficient way for killers to complete their objective while its partner, genrushing, is the most optimal way for survivors to complete their main objective. If you decide to tunnel the guy who is even remotely decent at looping, you've may costed yourself the game. Looking at it the bigger picture, genrushing could easily be the killer's fault because they do not know when to drop the chase and they are not pressuring the other three survivors. 
---
I decided to do that with my Trapper but I do regret not using absolutely every bonus BP and rarer addon first.
---
Twitch emote
---
to streamers though it's even worse. it's an old tradition in dbd to mori t.tv guy. people are sick of it. 
---
Finally Freddy mains are getting the representation and reputation we deserve
---
Holy shit it‚Äôs me
---
It's best to use all your cakes, items, and party streamers before you do so you can level back up quicker.
---
For 600, do all the above once again but in MS paint
---
Yup. I don‚Äôt run ruin except on trapper..he‚Äôs just so weak otherwise. Might as well play any other m1 killer
---
Legion's gotta dip that knife in hot sauce. Imagine how long mending will take then.
---
Alright I'm too tired and lazy to do a back and forth, have a good day man/woman
---
Anticipation of double bp 
---
get good and you won't care anymore about not being healed.
---
Fuck off
---
ither of u got a link
---
I play on ps4, and in my unfortunate experience if someone goes down before a gen is popped with ruin up, and most likely bbq as well then it gurantees a hatch game and no one gets to open an exit gate (I'd say 90% of the time). I only called you a killer main because most killer mains only see the negatives of running ruin (it being destroyed so fast) when it's easily one of the best.
---
Well Mettle of Man is easily countered by killers that don‚Äôt M1 so it automatically wastes a perk slot, killers like Billy, Leatherface, Plague, and I‚Äôm pretty sure legion and nurse don‚Äôt work when it comes to MoM. I might be wrong though 
---
No man, what makes you think that?
---
You honestly think drinking the water is better than staying sick? You have 0 chance in a chase and at loops with a corrupted plague.
---
https://youtu.be/6rKvFbVSZ80
---
You're really saying this is better?
---
This looks so cool
---
No it's pretty easy. I just played my first 5 killer games as the lanter gong person (whatever their name is) and killed all 4 survivors in under 7 minutes each game.
---
It's way too easy. 
---
For basic Killers, I usually hook one up and leave em be to hunt for others. If you get unhooked and I just somehow to stumble upon you then shame. Otherwise if someone gets unhooked and Im chasing somebody, Im not gonna drop my chase to go after the unhooked one. 
---
no
---
That's what i'm thinking, "Top Tier" Killers counters MoM, so it just seems wasteful.  
---
I don't drink the water because THIS happens when you do.
---
In the open, at loops, over pallets. It's literally the same as having broken status. Quit letting the status of your icons and bars effect you and the team. You can't infect someone already infected, you can't get infected by objects in the environment that are already infected. Learn to loop. Red bars don't mean shit in this game. Power through it. It's not that bad. You might as well all just stand in the basement and let the killer kill everyone because you hand them the game.
---
disconnecting

Throw in a purple Instaheal while you‚Äôre at it
---
After reading Stake-outs perk description, how does it help find ruin?
---
Myers easily best licensed dlc
---
'Tis all good. 
---
I get Stake Out and Detective's Hunch mixed up a lot. 
---
800 hours and I am still bad at survivorüòÇ, killer is a different story I think I am pretty good at killer. 
---
Nice assumption, but I don't think I could have gotten to rank 1 pretty much every season by playing like a dumbass. Also feel free to ask for a pic of my Hag's perks, the only other perks I have other than these 4 are agitation, third seal hex, and 2 more useless perks I can't remember off the top of my head. The most I could do is use a shit addon, as you can see in the video.
---
Get this shit off my family friendly Christian sub
---
I leveled the doctor first and then moved onto the huntres then I'm gonna do hag, but doctor is amazing for just farming points
---
No, they don‚Äôt see this glitch
---
I'll keep drinking the water, but I appreciate the offer. Gotta stay hydrated. And also alive.
---
If the killers trash.. you stall. If you‚Äôre worried about altruism.. cleanse totems? It‚Äôs really not hard to get points in every category. The only time I see anyone not able to do so is when they‚Äôre blatantly going out of their way not to bother. I get it‚Äôs a ‚Äúspooky game‚Äù to some people but this is one of those times there‚Äôs a perfect reason not to rush or try and get out as quick as possible. You either care about your pip and do as much as possible to get one (which you can still pip in the current system and die) or you don‚Äôt care about your pip and you rush the map. Trying to blame the system for why you chose to leave as quick as possible is a little bit crazy, and the exact thing I was referring to when I said just doing a little and surviving. Killers farm points all the time without the help of survivors, maybe more survivors should be baiting hits to farm altruism like I do. Every argument I‚Äôve heard is why can‚Äôt I just do this one or two things and pip... as if that should even need explaining. And in that next match, I‚Äôm assuming in your example your not afk, which means you were chased, and done some small amount to achieve a safety like I was suggesting it should be. How is that even a bad thing to not be de ranked and safety if you got farmed? That‚Äôs insane my comment was downvoted lol I‚Äôm literally suggesting that doing 0 and only 0 should get you de ranked. That only doing one category shouldn‚Äôt result in a pip. That doing a balanced set of things across emblem category‚Äôs gets success, and excelling in those things gets you 2... and that‚Äôs a bad thing? Wow.
---
Happened as clown. Everyone was fucking massive. 
---
Free for the weekend, not until the 10th. The spring sale is until the 10th.
---
To be fair, it was a very common suggestion for a perk
---
I thought the vault speed increase is gone now?
---
Must be a mistake then. Copy-pasted from store: "Play for free until 10 Apr @ 7:00pm. Offer ends 10 Apr @ 7:00pm."
---
I doubt playing 5 matches in ranks below Rank 15 means anything, but congrats. Wraith is a good boy, mained him when I started.
---
It's harder to play survivor starting out, then it flips.
---
I agree in principle, but the specific requiements for ranking up now are too harsh. A hypothetical game, you get found straight away as a survivor and do an insane chase, 4 gens get done before you are caught. Someone pulls you off the hook and you do th last gen alongside another survivor. Once that pops you go to save the person who got downed while you were doing the gen but someone else gets there first. the 3 of you make it to an exit gate, you manage to open it and all 4 of you escape. That is basically a perfect game as far as survivors go. But nobody will pip there. You will get bronze, maybe silver in objective if you are lucky, gold escape, nothin or bronze for altruism and gold (maybe iridescent) for chase). that isn't enough to pip at high ranks and the other players probably won't even get that much, despite it being a game where the killer got absolutely stomped.
---
Oh man, looping and Sprint Burst are broken. This game is broken. Everything is broken. 
---
If only BHVR were as good at faces as the artists who make these portrayals. 
---
He liked emo songs?
---
I was thinking the same thing lol!
---
Honestly, Flip-Flop is what Boil Over should have been. Now there isn't much hope at all in seeing Boil Over get its much needed buff.  
---
I am fine with there being multiple anti-slugging perks that don't do too much alone, but which form a strong combination when used with one another.
---
Billy can be countered with any structure that has more than one wall lol. Unless he decides to hammer you up. 
---
But she is still free, giving you have the shards.
---
&gt;I was introduced to two killers in one game and could only gawk at how amazing that was.
---
Wat
---
Then every original killer/survivor is free in that sense
---
Take Adrenalin from Meg too. Very Strong Perk.
---
Don't forget piggy.
---
the objective is to escape not to fucking bait hits, if you manage to escape without much trouble then you should be able to rank up. I'm not saying that it's difficult but having to go into the map to clever totems or sun the killer after you have done the objective is a bad design. Once you win you should be rewarded. 
---
Tbf getting 2 hooks on every survivor and full chase/devious/etc points thru farming means getting kills really doesn‚Äôt add much more BP
---
Counterpoint:
---
Chasing the person with the most hook time to maximize your kill speed definitely removes a pair of hands from gens, but doesn't actually do anything to disrupt the people already on them.
---
You're actually better off slugging a farmed player, breaking chase with an injured player to injure and kick multiple people off a gen, and temporarily giving up on a survivor who's injured and on death-hook, but found a good building to loop.
---
Doctor with p3 is so cool
---
I usually go after the healthy one. Its not the hooked guys fault his teamates an idiot. I also aim for 4 stacks of bbq over kills. I like to hook everyone once then stsrt on the second round of hooks. No one can complain when its their turn again. 
---
hey buddy wil u do the new ones ash jane and plague please ?
---
I get 50, stop leveling and use all the big bp offerings, party streamers and cakes. don't spend a single bp until all of those are used up, prestige and pour all those bp back into that survivor. And then comes getting all the perks on that one survivor....I've only done that once so far
---
Because PC players had complaints
---
I dunno man.
---
I hopped from console onto PC and I can't seem to get a game as killer ever, the queue almost seems worse than on PS4. Granted, survivor games pop up almost instantly so idk man
---
Survivors need a boost some how. Killers can depip but it be entirely their own faults. I can depip because my teammates didnt help me or the killer camped and hard tunneled me. Survivor pips are based on how well the team does sometimes and its not entirely up to you skills. 
---
pip system is something else.  I just want more bp lol
---
It's also the only one where survivors can actually tell you have a non-default face
---
Woah! Groovy
---
DBD and working servers? You're funny 
---
Need this as a QoL update
---
‚Äûlike if‚Äú 
---
[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfnmZvK4l88) a link to a fairly popular Nurse guide that should help you out. Happy hunting!
---
You forgot 
---
urban 
---
‚Äúcan‚Äôt run bc sprint burst‚Äù *gets to 2nd stage on hook*
---
‚ÄúOh no I see the killer on the other side of the map‚Äù
---
Kinda wack how you accuse him of BMing you to justify your BMing, then trying to deny that youre BMing
---
Did you downvote me lol? Anyway yeah I should definitely be more responsible with my offerings, addons, and items. I shouldn‚Äôt get so excited to prestige considering I have &gt;5 characters P3‚Äôs..... but that sweet skull of temptation.
---
A lot of people would kill me if they saw how many Anti-Hemmoragic Syringes and Bloody Party Streams I let go away with prestige. 
---
Thanatophobia is a garbage perk.
---
Nurse's Calling is decent all round, as is M&amp;A on most killers. I'd also recommend Enduring from the Hillbilly as it helps you out in nearly every game, and newer players won't be expecting you to run under riskier pallet drops. They expect you to stand back and wait for them to drop which can be a free hit.
---
Love it
---
If survivors do 5 generators, then they are winning - are they not?
---
yes
---
No. He wouldn‚Äôt. üòê
---
But a NURSE would. You‚Äôre essentially saying it‚Äôs a bamboozle power but with a nurse or hag teleport. You‚Äôre just ripping off multiple other effects already in game and saying it‚Äôs a rework. 
---
Lore aside. It‚Äôs bad. 
---
Freddy Krueger didn‚Äôt just teleport everywhere. He was a cancer in your mind. Once he‚Äôs there, he finds you, waits for you to sleep, and then chases you and fucks with you until he kills you. It‚Äôs his entire personality. He enjoyed a good chase most times. Did he have traps? Yes. They certainly could try and add that effect. But again that just ripping off the Doctor‚Äôs projections., and the multiple other trap powers in game. They also could have done that for Legion instead of Feral Frenzy. 
---
Maybe Play the turtorial. You get 25k bp the first time for playing it.
---
Sure, there are absolutely times when you shouldn't heal and just focus on gens. But then there are absolutely times when you should've healed and you go down a lost faster and become even more useless than if you had just spent the time self caring (or getting healed). I disagree strongly that it's "typically" better not to heal. Especially against some killers. Not sure where that sentiment (almost only on reddit) came from. 
---
Yes!
---
&lt;Unsheathes Poorly Sharpened Ruler&gt;
---
That was the entities left but judging you
---
[removed]
---
If you can't rely on teammates to heal you, then you can't rely on them to do gens either. If they aren't doing gens, and you're too busy spending 40 seconds straight healing, then you are all by definition potatoes and will never escape the trial as the Killer snowballs to a 4k.
---
Building a Generator here!
---
Nvm, PS4 and PC are reversed, it takes me 2-40 minutes to find a round as survivor or I get an instant lobby as killer on PS4, wack
---
That's why Adrenaline is slowly becoming meta again. People need to stop using Selfishcare and start using Adrenaline.
---
I'd get bubba first. BBQ is just that worth it for grinding.
---
Unless of course you got lucky with the shrine. But i still enjoy playing bubba a lot so it's a justified DLC for me.
---
Yeah, you're right, there are definitely those Claudettes self caring in the corner of the map while shit is going down. However that's a a bad player issue, NOT a bad perk issue. I think people forget that. Self care is still good if you're playing solo in many situations.   
---
I also strongly disagree with the "that's how people with self care play". The vast majority run self care, the bad ones are just going to stick out to you more. 
---
Best way to handle is to learn and get better. Learn how to chase, how to put pressure. Earn BPs and get better perks.
---
Don't be discourage by the skill difference, you'll get there.
---
okay? not all people are like you. 
---
I mean adrenaline has been meta for a long time, and people still use both. I think there are far, far more useless perks to the team than self care so we'll have to disagree on that one rofl. 
---
so you just randomly checked their profile? they didn't even have twitch shirt?
---
Spine Chill prevents chase experience. 
---
Eventually, the baton will be handed to you and you will be forced into a chase you can't evade. When that time comes, Spine Chill cannot help you and has actually hindered you since you have ranked up to harder killers without actually having done any good chases.
---
This is why there are R1 Claudettes who can't loop for more than 5 seconds.
---
This is a bug btw. It's not meant to increase further on subsequent stabs.
---
Sorry, but I can't let this pain go on for any longer. I main Freddy with Sloppy Butcher and I still see people trying to Selfishcare (I use skillcheck reduction addons).
---
thats the joke
---
True but I only get the bone and nothing else. I have all the killers
---
Hexes are not that strong and gets found every time no matter what.I've had 100s of killer matches and my ruin lasted for the whole game like 1 or 2 times?It easily gets destroyed in the first 3 mins every time.
---
And if NOED lights up after first survivor hit like you suggested,there's no way it's going to last till endgame.
---
You live your life the way you want friend. It's a video game, if people want to downvote you for having fun, they can go take a long walk off a short cliff. 
---
The truth is somewhere halfway imo. There are matches where I wish I had it and I'm pretty much fucked for not being able to heal, and my team can't  The problem is that too many survivors refuse to stay injured for a little amount of time and not being able to work together with teammates for faster heals 
---
Ah thanks m8
---
SO goals. I can do goals.
---
Still a bit tricky. I sometimes get good matches and it ranks me up. I kinda want that to stop LOL. 
---
Mikey, Bubba and Spirit are all definitely worth picking up but in reality, even though most of the community hate on some of the killers, they are all usable and fun to play as so get them all while they are on sale for sure.
---
[Cause it's one of the few movie/game poster poses](https://youtu.be/VXJiBkFgprQ)
---
Not mentioning anywhere it's yours but making use of art IS stealing, are you actually that stupid?
---
The title is "Perfect"
---
No credit to the artist or anything whatsoever
---
Yes.. its stealing.. and No people aren't getting toxic because you're joking around its the fact you don't at least refer to the artist who made this, you trying to justify the use of this artwork trying to say you didn't do anything wrong because you didn't say it was yours, that.. is toxic behaviour, not to mention; you didn't say it was yours, but didn't say either you didn't make it eitherway, you got 20 downvotes for that comment.. says much about you doesn't it?
---
I feel ya. It‚Äôs the same on Xbox. 
---
To be fair, you can label them however you want. 
---
Frozen loading screens, lobbies with high Ping and many Disconnects are all here in this asymmetrical game
---
r/gatekeeping that's why lol
---
It works extremely well in survive with friends
---
Literally had a camping tunneling one before so annoying 
---
I main killer but I play survivor from time to time with and without my friends and I don't have any problem with noed sure it's annoying when you get hit by it but hey I never tried to counter it so I can't blame the killer only myself
---
It‚Äôs technically possible if you go against a toxic god that‚Äôll hemo tech themselves on their second hit 
---
I usually prestige with 1kk bp in my pocket and 3 dailies solved but not claimed
---
Tbh if she wasn‚Äôt a 115 speed killer then yea I‚Äôd never cleanse but my random teammates always cleanse and I end up getting one shotted by her power while in broken state regardless
---
Thats why I run No Mither. I'm in the low ranks, all my teammates are potatoes, I rather have the killer chase me and keep them busy for a minute or three than the killer finding my teammates and downing them 30 seconds in. I also run dead hard and decisive strike, so they will not have an easy time.
---
When I play killer, I'll often slug No Mither users. It's a token of my appreciation while still slowing down the gen progress a little
---
*\*Gets fucking murdered\**
---
That's not how it works. 
---
Dead By Duty
---
Call Of Daylight
---
u can buy it with shards too tho
---
you cant blame him can ya, when your the killer you might as well grope the damn bastards they're gonna fukin die anyways
---
I'm a No Mither user when I play survivor. When I play killer, I also slug No Mithers just because I appreciate their perk choice
---
It makes sense to do in many cases but obviously it's not very fun if you don't get much of a chance to do anything.
---
I actually love it.
---
fuk yeh cunt
---
I find Hex Totems so frequently due to many Killers heading directly to them from the start.
---
She‚Äôs powerful against solo because people just cleanse, then the smart people that stay sick get fucked by corrupt purge anyway.
---
When others cleanse, I usually just start focusing on helping myself even though I‚Äôm usually very altruistic. One day people will learn not to cleanse.
---
Very relatable, however, instead of hiding from the killer, I embrace the chance they will tunnel me and run Dead Hard and Decisive Strike. I also run Tenacity so I can sometimes crawl away before the killer can pick me up.
---
(One of my favorite tenacity games:

---
I don't agree as a nurse main I gotten pretty much all my games down to 4ks but usually with bad luck 3 gens left and hatch escape bc I can't be bothered to camp hatch for hours and I have noed and honestly I don't have anything else that I wanna use I could run 3 perks and be fine so why not slap on noed for those rare times it goes to end game. So no I don't agree it makes people lazy that's for higher ranks like rank 5-1 now in lower I can agree I always see when I play survivor rank 15-10 wraiths running noed but they don't really play to it bc they never care about a survivor cleansing their totems but hey maybe that's just me
---
Username checks out
---
I had this glitch on ps4, where to wiggle you have to spin the left stick around in a circle - the same stick you move with.
---
It meant every time I tried to change direction, I stopped dead still instead. I got caught very easily that game.
---
Have you played against a doc who's trying to stall? Pretty miserable.
---
Yeah that's exactly why I made this post. 2 people were sick and broken, I was one of them. the jeff on my team knew what he was doing so I got him to not cleanse himself and we just did gens sick. The Claudette decided that she wanted to get Jeff off the hook, thing was, he was already sick and in broken status. But she legit got mad enough at me for working on a gen and then she touched it, knowing I was sick and broken and ended up stopping everything she was doing to message me about how "i fucked the entire match for everyone."  This was after Jeff and I both did 4 gens on our own cause claudette was busy sucking up all the fuckin water and getting insta-downed by corrupt faster than either Jeff or myself ever did by staying broken.
---
So Claudette's logic is "I'm going to throw the entire game because someone got me sick." Even though she was about to get sick from saving Jeff from the hook. Either way, she was gonna cry about either me or him getting her infected and throw the entire game just to do so.
---
This post is more of a PSA for solo queuers than anything else because SWF already knows to ignore the shit and pump out gens.
---
Yeah, tbh it's been a few months since I've seen a doctor. Anyone who is just dragging out the game is just an ass.
---
I prefer Shirtless Myers x Laurie uww xD 
---
Same here, altough I tend to run these perks:
---
Dead Hard because, well, Dead Hard
---
Tenacity wich sometimes allows me to crawl away before the killer gets to me and since No Mither makes you way more silent when on the ground, it gets way more difficult to find you if the killer doesn't have deerstalker.
---
Decisive Strike because you tend to get tunneled with No Mither
---
I must of been the killer because when I play a hex its always cleansed in the first minute... but when I go against a hex it seems to be hidden outside the map....
---
Also love the d/c 13 seconds in... killer must have seen them across the map. 
---
&gt;level 1
---
I think he's saying that so many people complain about pipping (which I don't think they do but still) when accumulating BPs as a survivor is the real difficulty. Kinda relevant because of the BP theme of this post?
---
I honestly forget Quentin exists
---
I do it  because what else to do?
---
I don't know, this is like everyone saying to not heal against Legion because of his power. If they see you are injured they'll turn into an M1 Killer till your dead.
---
Someone speaking from a killer perspective here. T3 Myers is still loopable. It's harder, but you can still easily do it, &amp; if you do, you've waster my T3 &amp; most of if not all of your EEEESSSSSEEENCE

---
Prayer bead spirit is pretty rough too
---
i mean, you've gotta down'em to slam dunk a trap on their head
---
Even then the bloodpoints are so little anyways. But I think this is right because the killer is alone so he has to get some more bloodpoints so it is fair to me
---
I think it was a bad joke. Because bing bong us invisible.

... care to expand?

Adrenaline. Selfcare is zzzz and wastes time.

Literally the same thing happened to me

&gt; I'm gonna be spending bloodpoints either way and I can alternate characters if I need to.

On survivors
---
First of all: learn all the basic mechanics like all the different vaults, your max lunge range, what do different perks do.
---
Then: pay attention to maps and the way pallets spawn. Differentiate between safe and unsafe loops.
---
Then: learn how to run all the different loops. Learn how to shorten jungle gyms and double pallets
---
Lastly: learn to put out pressure and snowball it
---
There is a fuckton of guides on youtube and twitch streamers are always happy to help. OhTofu, Scott Jund/Damnnohtml, ZubatLEL are names you should check out. They got all the guides in the world. I guess dm me or something if you want more specific help
---
Not really, i have just seen multiple art reposts where the op doesn‚Äôt know the artist. I think it was alright for me to ask of that. 
---
They should double the gain. Long time players might have forgotten that, but its horrible to grind for the first teachables. I have 27 hours and not a single teachable unlocked. Given, ive spread it out, but even if i hadnt, i might have one characters teachables unlocke and might be working on the second. BP income is garbage.
---
I tend to run Noed less at rank 15 then at rank 5 cause i feel confident that generators might actually get done at rank 5
---
Thank you. This helps.
---
Legion and pig, either die or die
---
So I can actually have a chase with the killer and not be forced to loop him as soon as the killer gets close to me.
---
When will we get our first handicapped survivor? 
---
This is me earlier when running End Game Freddy and three survivors escaped through the hatch because they found a key.
---
If you do the kyf glitch, all killers have animations to get trapped, picking up traps and setting them
---
True. Ive been playing since august last year and only have like 7 characters teachables and a few from shrine.
---
Lol her range actually can be avoided if you do what I called the Rabbit Run where you just zigzag. I usually only get axe hits when someone is trying to Pallet me or when someone is running to a window/vaulting. Usually I only get them otherwise if they are in a straight line.
---
He‚Äôs got skills, he may be useful.
---
Interesting to know.  Though they would need to make it trapper unique thing to be able to put them down i feel like

And to add to that, her hitbox is so glitchy that sometimes shots don‚Äôt even register on to her.

It's mostly overhyped. Even when you do get salt, it'll mostly be some asshole that makes one snide comment about how slugging is bad, before vanishing from your life forever.

yep. as long as its the hypotenuse which is alone its acceptable. my teacher wouldnt be too happy tho
---
You say that as if MoM requires timing or skill at all.
---
I unfriend you.
---
Frankly, I don't bring it much for the fact that for it to be really good, you do have to get lucky with the timing. The few times I've brought it, it's only really been helpful once, only because I was in that edge-case chase scenario. 
---
I‚Äôm DYING to get this glitch. Please just let me play against my queens spirit and Amanda. I want them to jump scare me to death
---
Nah he is definitely the worst killer in the game. He is still useable with good perks and add ima but he has almost zero map control and he has to use his power to even attack anyone. I still enjoy using him though, and I would say he is better than leatherface and maybe trapper with the right build, but otherwise he sucks if I am going to be honest.
---
Honestly i just want myers to stalk me to full then they stop bothering you. Plus they cant tier up later anyways
---
Do you have special eyes?
---
Class photo and 3 flashlights is what did it. It was an extremely altruistic swf, and they were constantly asleep thanks to class photo. That‚Äôs why I get really happy when I find a swf with 2 or more flashlights.
---
Northern summer lmao 
---
Wasnt this patched, like over a year ago? 
---
At least she isn‚Äôt running iron will? Haha 
---
While she doesn't have an actual attack for her ability, I don't think I'd label her as an M1 Killer in the strictest sense.
---
I mean, you can play her as "walk forward, press M1" all ya want, but you ain't getting far without blinking.
---
This happened with match making like 2 halloween's ago. Double killer was loading in.
---
It's full build for a Dwight main.
---
I slug to bait sometimes, and other times if it's the last two I slug one so the other can't get the hatch (I usually give it to them anyway, I just like the chase).
---
But I run deerstalker so...
---
Depending on the killer, I'd say Enduring
---
idk what to say about LFs 'cause there are rare situation when i face them but i've never faced one that camped or tunneled me nor my teammates. but since i have deranked a lot with the new pip system, i've faced so many Wraiths that's already annoying and it became a stereotype already. once i used Spine Chill and when he hooked me, SC was the entire time active, my teammate unhooked, he uncloaked, downed me and hooked me again then he told me that he was just "checking" to see if someone was going for the rescue and it's not his fault that i got a bad unhook. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èanyway, playing survivor these days for me sucks, i've enjoyed killer lately.
---
You sure that you werent running bamboozle? Seems like it worked on the claud
---
This guy refuses to pick up anyone or hook anyone all game. He was trying to get a 4 man slug
---
And then it was haunted grounds
---
So I'm currently levelling up all my killers to P3 and this was by far the worst experience I've ever had in the game as a killer. Just disconnections every match.
---
That's great. Thank you
---
From what I understand sysmain is the new superfetch so it should only run when you've recently I unslept your PC or turned it on
---
So guess I'll go for Bubba. Thank you
---
Sounds good
---
You're a life saviourüò£
---
I think most ppl heal up against one hit something because the survivor is less loud when fully healed. 
---
How on earth is he gatekeeping at all? :')
---
Survivors bitch about everything. It's up to you how you decide to handle it,  but 90% of the time you kill someone, they will find an excuse to be salty over it. 
---
I recommend running Make Your Choice so there‚Äôs a reward for not getting the easy target and not camping
---
Most killers's reaction to this:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLMC0d7Szok](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLMC0d7Szok) 
---
ur mum
---
don't down vote took me 3 minutes to think of that
---
On GOD y‚Äôall need to stop
---
It sucks the killer wasn't in the mood to farm, but can you blame him? My first two games yesterday were farming games. The crashes and rage quitting happens so much that a lot of games are pity matches for me. Sometimes people are not in the mood and just want the game to end.
---
The survivors need guaranteed safety pips when this happens.
---
C H U N G O!
---
Little bit overkill haha
---
*disconnects*
---
Learn how to curve
---
This makes sense. It did only recently occur to me that the perk will pick someone straight up from dying state. Although you'd have to be quick to the mark. Basically hanging out next to the 99% gen - Still would work just probably reliant on exceptional team communication.
---
Any other interesting rank 1 survivor tips? :)
---
P.S. I know your pain. I'd just started playing enough to go up the ranks and reached rank 7/8  then have been slowly being dragged down to 11/12. But then again I play for fun (and to unlock perks) more than survivor rank.
---
I have the same problem with Leatherface on PC.
---
The survivor runs into the open
---
I rev up my saw
---
they fail to find cover
---
REUGH REEE RUASG REAUPHF
---
\*Disconnect sound\*
---
They also don't stick around so that I can ask them post-game: "What did you expect? I'm Leatherface?"
---
Fuck legion
---
Fuck Manny
---
The old system didn't really deter them either. It's a tricky conversation. While people shouldn't be forced to play a match they don't want, if they choose to dc it shouldn't be at the hindrance of the other players. The devs could implement some sort of exchange to the existing players by auto completing one gen per dc for instance (which is what happens if someone dcs or gets kicked out before the match loads, to keep game balance). Killer already gets dc points for each survivor that does it. Even then it could be abused in a swf group, but it wouldn't be at detriment to the killer. 
---
As far as penalties go, idk. I think banning is too harsh and should be reserved for those who abuse the system via hacking, hostage, much more severe problems. Even if they started banning though, people will still dc anyway. Theres no easy solution that will be effective. Rank doesn't really matter, as we see. Blood points aren't really that important either and can easily be made up. A timer cool down might be good but it won't change a lot of aspects outside of the individual player. 
---
If the devs wanna fix dc issues they need to just fix the game. Stop making new content, we have enough for now, and start exclusively reworking the balance and mechanics of the game. That's where vast majority of issues stem from. Everyone feels they have to play toxic, which leads to everyone getting frustrated and fed up, and some rage quit because of it, others grief, others bm, others adopt extremely shitty playstyles because it feels good to be shitty.
---
I main Quentin. I run Wake Up! ironically at rank 1. It's probably the worst survivor perk in the game. Maybe Vigil or Up The Ante could beat it in terms of uselessness. 
---
Oh god.... at this rate he will take off his shirt!
---
Devs: From now on the game will check if there are any hex totems in line of sight of survivor.  
---
Some random object blocking it: Cool.
---
Oohh man that got me thinking...
---
Pyramid head!!! 
---
That would be dope
---
What about something like the huntress where he can get it from a locker?
---
I know what you mean. Doctor was my favorite killer and now it feels like I have to play Billy just to have any fun as killer anymore.
---
I'm pretty sure the trophies are their own reward here. You've gotten bp while doing the things you needed to get them anyway.
---
It's awful in a lobby of 2-4. Solo que is fine. 
---
I escaped and even 360‚Äôed my killer while on the verge of tears because of all the crap plays and being stuck in plain sight cuz of the wiggle 
---
So Michael is a Otaku?
---
Great! I will. How is Feng as a survivor?
---
I've won so many games with my sloppy butcher spirit by hooking a guy and seeing 2 people self-caring in corners of the map. This stuff loses games.
---
Also nobody can call you a camper because your 50m away from basement, nevermind that it'll only take 4 seconds to get back, that's just a technicality.
---
uWu *i LiKe It AnYwAy* ~~(I know this comment is cringey)~%
---
Alert and lithe are great perks, but technician sucks, she‚Äôs good tho 
---
Remember when someone made a video whining about it? Wouldn‚Äôt it be more discriminating if they had given him the faces of all the four classic Survivors besides Claudette.
---
just did it to get my meg to P3. if you're smart with the bps it can get you right back up to lvl 39
---
It really isn't, it wastes too much time. Especially when killer is running sloppy butcher.
---
Awesome! Thank you
---
Because they aren't using their time before becoming broken to do something useful like finish a generator. Being sick is such a non-debuff that there's no reason to get rid of it until absolutely necessary or else you're giving the Plague free extra power early.
---
Spine chill, Self care, Sprint burst, Urban evasion.
---
These are the 4 horseman of a useless teammate.
---
i thought it might be but my internet is fairly good, speednet marks it at 10ms everytime i test it and have high download speed.  
---
its just strange that sometimes i get green and so does my friend and sometimes i get red and he gets green.  
---
hmm maybe my network card is dropping packets or something.
---
This is a great tier list, the only thing that should be changed is that the pig should be C tier and not B tier. Other than that it‚Äôs perfect
---
Happens when spmeone disconnects while the killer was carrying them 
---
GG EZ BABY BITCH
---
LUL! You rigged Susie's face? :D
---
Pig can completely ignore MoM and prevent it from ever getting stacks and activating. I wasn't talking specifically about traps.

Also mind you this was my first game as Freddy after a big hiatus since prestiging him, I had nothing of use
---
Brown medkits are extreamly common, I don't think it's any real investment.
---
&gt;it's more efficient than another teammate healing you
---
Not really, you spend too much time self caring and that time lost is greater than them healing you and you two getting on a gen.
---
&gt;doesn't botany reduce the heal time to 26
---
Investing 2 perks to do what a medkit would do is a waste.
---
There's only one player who plays plague consistently on ps4 that I've come across (can tell by playstyle and cosmetics) so that's the only reference I have going against her. She plays in an interesting way, doesn't touch corrupt pools till there's one gen left. She uses corrupt as an end game. 
---
That said though, broken status is something a lot of people aim hard to avoid. Not a lot of people play dileverance due to it, no one touches no mither. It makes you extremely vulnerable. As long as the survivor doesn't cleanse next to the killer, meh. People don't want to wait to be broken, especially since there's an add on that makes your aura visible to the killer every time you vomit. So you either give her a minute of god power, or you have a match of being visible to her. 
---
I found this funny clauddet who farmed herself for me and I escaped through the door, she had unbreakable and and tenacity and crawled to the corner, got back up and escaped through the hatch
---
EPIC.
---
I tried to ask him that if we could play swf but the killer said
---
FCK your mum and dced instantly 
---
Hello mocha!! I'm happy to know that you like it. Luckily the homophobes got downvoted enough to go to the bottom comments and be hidden. I'll keep on keeping on!!
---
 DEAD BY DAYLIGHT is a trademark and **brand** of BEHAVIOUR INTERACTIVE INC.
---
I always check profiles to see if they're going to dc before game or not and if they have a twitch in their profile I'll follow them. If they DC before  game starts I go back to their stream and see if they did it themself or not.
---
If they dc before game because of a secret I'll just dodge them whenever I get against them again because I don't play against players like that and I'd rather not  farm because players don't want to get against secret offerings
---
I've played 400 hours in total, hit rank 2 survivor and rank 5 killer and still think I'm terrible. My mate who their personal best is not as high, I think is a better player. For example, when we do a generator together, I always run when i see the killer when my mate just urban evasion around the generator to escape.
---
You usually can if you use your power
---
I would say that shes an amazing puchase. I dont know about this bug ive never noticed. I guess that goes to show how impactful it is.
---
okay, fair enough. props to you, op
---
It's good, but it's not nearly as good as some people make it out to be. Especially right now that it doesn't work against Nurse.
---
Bear traps, chainsaws, insta-down abilities/add-ons/perks, hatchets, ambush dashes, frenzy stabs, vile and corrupt purge - they all counter the perk.
---
Let's take a game where you get tunnelled. This effectively leaves you with 4 health states (2 for the first hook, 1 further health state after each hook). Since you need 3 of those to get the perk to activate, any instance of losing even only 1 health state without it granting a stack for Mettle Of Man means it will have been a wasted perk slot. And the instances of losing health states without gaining stacks are numerous: not only do half the killers have innate ways to derive survivors of health states without it granting MOM stacks, but there are perks and add-ons that also do this for the killers that don't.
---
Got caught in a bear trap (losing 1 or 2 health states in the process, depending on whether you go free, get grabbed or hit in the trap, or whether Honing Stone is on play), injured when disarming a bear trap due to Bloody Coil? Got chainsawed? Got hit with Evil Within III, Redhead's Pinky Finger, Devour Hope/Haunted Ground/No One Escapes Death/Make Your Choice/(Rancor)? Or a hatchet, ambush dash, frenzy stab, or vomit? Enjoy not getting any use out of your perk slot in case you get tunnelled, which is similarly as common a scenario.
---
The available health states obviously go up if you don't get tunnelled (6), or have perks that grant extra health states (i. e. Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike), and beyond that if you take hits intentionally/lose the killer and heal afterwards, but likewise, many of the killer abilities don't grant stacks towards MOM's activation at all, and can be used to down you multiple times. And not only that, you need to be injured for MOM's effect to work, so instant-down abilities/add-ons/perks can down you even if you do have all stacks (healing to 99% can be used to counter this, but it has its risks against some of the killers, and only works if you have Self-Care or a Med-Kit, whereas Adrenaline can force you into healthy state).
---
This is a great list assuming you dont count add ons. If you do, legion is pretty much god tier with no counters.
---
It is because a majority of People in this Subreddit are people who are hardstuck killer mains that honestly think walking around a pallette twice is toxic because they rather write a post then learning to run a jungle gym as killer entirely depending on noed. But you know DS , a 2nd Chance crouch, was bad. 
---
I hope he does
---
Lol, I remember seeing this on True's video XD
---
Bubba for perks. Halloween for fun. Spark of madness for bloodpoints. Shattered bloodline for more killer and survivor perks. These are my top ones.
---
You exceeded my expectations by a lot
---
Such lucious lips 
---
I prestige cause u get better items on bloodweb 
---
You just gotta apply a lot of pressure 
---
Nani!?!?
---
You can watch some videos about him. Try recent videos. To Hurt them, you need to put the survivor into the Dream State. After you use your power, the survivor will be in Dream Transition for 7 seconds, only after that time, Freddy can Hurt the survivor. It sounds bad (It really is) but When the survivors are in Dream World, they have 50% action speed reduction, and Fred can see their aura when they are outside his terror radius. Again, try to watch a video about him, you will better undertand his power. He is my favorite killer, and he is really fun to play imo, even if he is underpowered. 
---
Why bother p3'ing if you dont enjoy playing him?
---
No, this is op
---
My favorite part is that the evader one is missing. Got damn Urban evasion, not getting in a single chase ass claudettes
---

 Try this one, Bricky is an amazing youtuber

Honestly I appreciate your input, thank you! I'll give it a watch while I eat breakfast!
---
Survivor main
---
While that's true it's a bit more complicated. The channel had a bunch of nazi references, violent tragedy jokes, etc, especially in older videos.
---
The channel definitely deserved the flak but probably not PewDiePie.
---
You misunderstood their message. 
---
They've lost many games because they've wasted too much time healing, not because they didn't hea.
---
I only play Spirit when I play Killer and I think the audio bug is still there but I don‚Äôt even notice it. The other bug was fixed when Ash came out so don‚Äôt worry :)
---
i coulda sworn i got a stack when ambushed... huh... also... i mean... \*laughs\* landing an ambush? HAHAHAHAHHA... awww....
---
&lt;3 You are welcome bro! 
---
There goes the pug again 
---
Looping is the only thing survivors have, that‚Äôs why nurse is so strong, she can just deny it. This wouldn‚Äôt be fair, and would be very unfun 
---
How are they trying to kill it off?
---
I know this isn‚Äôt a fix, but couldn‚Äôt they spawn the killer on the hex totem when one is active? Keeps survivor from the totem to start the game and also allows the killer to better protect it. 
---
This is such a subtle joke, but now I get it
---
Except that it is. I saw many variations of this, it's either a¬≤ = b¬≤ + c¬≤, c¬≤ = a¬≤ + b¬≤ or even something with x y z.  
---
It doesn't matter that much as long as you declare which one's the hypotenuse. 
---
Legion isn't getting far without frenzy either. Is he not an m1 killer?
---
Op af
---
David though
---
lmfaoooo he‚Äôs got skills. 
---
You shouldn‚Äôt care about pips 
---
The most wholesome comment
---
"survivor smol killer big n scary"
---
Stuff that's unfun for both parties. 
---
Simple. If all gens are done and the persons on a hook. Then that's securing. Sitting on a person when gens are still up is camping.
---
If you get taken off the hook and leave a large ass scratch mark trail you cant complain about tunneling. Same with if you're pulled off the hook in front of the killer. Blame the person taking you off, not the killer doing their job. 
---
Quitter bonus for killer on surv DC, depip for survivor on killer DC.
---
Whereas Doctor's is the exact opposite. Or:
---
"*YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER!*"
---
Who do you tunnel after the unhook?
---
Misspalled*
---
Play a variety of killers early on to get a feel of who you like. I‚Äôd recommend trying out Cannibal, Doc, or Hag as they are all relatively easy to play. If you don‚Äôt have any of these play Wraith.
---
Once you found a killer you either like or are good at, practice. Play lots of matches, don‚Äôt camp, don‚Äôt dc even if it‚Äôs a toxic 4 man trying to ruin your day, just keep pushing on to get better.
---
Watch content makers like puppers, Tru3Tal3nt, and monto to see how really good killers play.
---
Watch tutorials on how to properly chase, cut of loops, etc.
---
Also use good perks, people may bitch about it but use noed, your a newer player and noed will help you out in the end game and might land you a few kills. Sloppy Butcher is another solid pick as it slows down healing speed a good amount. 
---
I hope this helps you, if you anything else to ask feel free to ask.
---
The hardest thing with her is also a problem Pig has: You can't see the damn timer. 
---
Jsut Bubba. And Myers if you want to play him of just for the DS. Any other you can check the perks first if you dont need them or you dont want to play that killer dont buy. There are way too many pekrs currently in the game the farm is insane
---
thanks mane, if u want check out my other gameplays.
---
(Angry Tusken Raider noises) 
---
You can farm just as good on simple wraith. I bought the doc for the same reason and I havent used it since I found I can farm on other killers easier / Wraith or Hag/
---
plAG
---
thanks mate.
---
#THIS JUST IN:
---
Hooks puncture lungs. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a harder map but still manageable so I don‚Äôt think it needs to be changed. 
---
I'd recommend Leatherface DLC (for BBQ), Curtain Call (both good characters with good perks) and Of Flesh and Mud (for ruin. hag is also pretty good). 
---
This basically should be on the loading screen sometimes
---
I think salty entitled survivor mains need to get over it, it‚Äôs never going anywhere. 
---
Can't wait for another "we rolled back matchmaking" patch.
---
You forgot sprint burst (only used to run to dead areas) and wasting shack pallet at five gens
---
Goodbye BPS
---
150
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm overpowered and broken‚Äù 
---
Just wait till the knife penetration starts
---
You also forgot that you have a 100 percent chance to Kobe when you are about to be saved by a team mate
---
We have no idea what the new chapter is and it's 3 months away. I'd buy Plague, since you'll probably have some shards saved up by the time the next chapter comes anyway!
---
If you escape without much trouble you are not facing a killer that is in your skill bracket, therefore should not pip. If you struggled but still escaped, that means you had a more balanced game and should pip. Pretty simple stuff.
---
*laughs in Kobe*
---
well im level 90 so the shards take a long time to enter my pocket. Also is the Plague good? Bc well i hate playing against her but well idk
---
That spirit tier is a sizable yike
---
Aww, cute 
---
Myers with Infectious Fright, M+A, Deerstalker, Enduring with a Dead Rabbit to increase Tier 3 terror radius. Have fun. 
---
Dear God... 
---
*Sees doctor in A-teir*
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well.
---
i completely agree
---
I mean, you ARE using a purple flashlight. You probably deserved it lol. Also, why the hell is a survivor able to stun the wraith while cloaked in the first place? He's already weak as fuck.
---
I'd try and get Iron Maiden, it lets you open lockers faster and notifies you when someone leaves one.
---
Appreciated, chief!
---
JUeDeSt GhIT GhuahD
---
Plague is a very good killer, definitely at the top of the tier list. Trust me you will have enough shards in 3 months, I‚Äôd say get her, she is fun to play.
---
Sorry. Can't play her well at all. Don't have the ears...
---
its a legacy nurse ohf uck oshs hisshit dohwiwnooooo
---
SWF is an option. Though the queue time will probably be awful. At least you know you can trust your teammates and have a better chance of surviving. 
---
If you want to stick with solo queue, go stealthy. Run all the gross stealth perks and guarantee you don't get found first (or at all.) It's a really boring way to play in my opinion, but it's effective for pipping, especially if you open a gate at the end and run the killer for a minute before leaving. (Though be careful about NOED there.) 
---
Also, d-strike is good if you're getting tunneled, but I'd also suggest mettle of man. Especially if you can escape the chase before being hooked. It turns into a borrowed time type perk if you get farmed. My current build is mettle of man, iron will, balanced landing, and either self care or a medkit. Get your hits in for MoM to proc, heal to 99%, then only finish healing once the chase starts. Gives you three hits before going down again. 
---
Finally, I wouldn't worry too much about rank. The system is a bit of a mess right now, and it's not like you get any rewards for being a certain rank. Just enjoy the game itself and take each game as its own competitive experience you vs. killer, rather than an overarching competitive experience of you vs. the rank system. 
---
Damn, I knew it was coming, but it still scared me.üò≥
---
But this isn't... exactly based on what everyone likes. It's based on my skill level. I'm okay with Nurse and Billy but I'm not fantastic. 
---
NEVER
---
Hmm thank you. One last question :P. Im on ps4 so the control is way worse than on pc. does this make a big difference for plague?
---
What are you talking about, Leatherface is just black.
---
Boners per second? Bet you get a lot of BPS, don't ya
---
This is based off his skills with each, not which killer is the best
---
Ahh, I was thinking more overall but hey if you are good with trapper power to you
---
Everybody Scream! 
---
\#EVERYBODY SCREAM!
---
Survivors DC against everything 
---
When you hit 100, it resets your XP amount per level so you'll get a lot more in the coming weeks once you prestige. :)
---
I have her, but I've only played her a few games. I like her, but she's not my favorite. I'd suggest looking up some gameplay for her if you haven't yet, and see if she's your style.
---
In a good way?
---
Still haven‚Äôt watched 2017 Jigsaw :/
---
I'm really unlucky, I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this at all. I figure it'd be funny the first time, at least. Is it a console only bug or something?
---
Pretty simple stuff but unfortunately it doesn't work the other way, you still lose progress when you go against a killer from a much higher skill level. Don't know about your experience but manage to get into a balanced match only like one in for games. That means that I only get one reliable chance to pip every four games and the other three games I have to play either really good against a skilled killer or not fuck up (or get farmed/camped which is for longer conversation) against a worse killer to just preserve my rank. Ranking up is quite hard on itself in this MM. And btw that wasn't what I was talking about with OP at all but whatever. (The conversation was about the connection between escaping and ranking up.)
---
because it‚Äôs a video game and any human being with a soul cares about other people having fun too.
---
There are two different types of tunneling, one where the survivor unhooks to fast and you go for the easier kill, or you just go for one person the entire match. 
---
you summoned the entity 
---
A killer that practices ninjitsu? Sign me up.
---
Not when I'm playing Dbd though, this game makes me feel like I'm almost impotent
---
Yeah she‚Äôs kinda my style. Not having to rely on aim all that much :P. And yeah ill reset to 0 but ill also get like 50 shards per level right?
---
Gnarly boardslide bro. 
---
it‚Äôs no more toxic than tunneling, if anything, it hurts the killer more than tunneling without the rbt, since instead of 2 people doing nothing (one getting the trap off and one getting chased) it‚Äôs 1 person doing nothing (getting chased with a rbt)
---
I run blood warden/TotH/BBQ/STBFL on my wraith 
---
Buy Leatherface, seriously. It doesn't change the fact that grind is crazy, but it will seriously improve your gaming experience
---
If you get a chance for it to actually come into play you'll get farmed of the hook immediate anyway. 
---
Using an item doesn‚Äôt mean you deserve to get tunneled. üôÑ Also he is pretty weak but getting burned out of cloak is mostly his fault as it is very easy to avoid from my experience.
---
Whoever downvoted me, make your points clear. Otherwise you'll be ejected for passive aggression. 
---
Practice, practice, practice. It's all muscle memory with her and her blinks. You'll get better in time. I wouldn't run add ons with her that change anything about her blink until you feel confident with her base blink or else it might throw you off.
---
Also, if you haven't, play some survivor. She's based a lot on guessing how survivors will react, so if you know that mindset, you're golden. Also, make note of specific survivor tendencies in game. Does one always double back? Account for that. One always turning left? You know where to go. 
---
In a similar vein, the more you play the game, the more you know the maps. They're somewhat randomly generated, but you end up with the same tilesets, so if you know them, you know where you have to blink.
---
I wish you all the luck in the world. I was never able to get the hang of the Nurse. (Though, I'm on console, so I admit I didn't try that hard lol.)
---
Eww.
---
I play Dbd on pc but I was a long time ps4 player before I got my pc. IMO, shooting and aiming is easier with a controller. With the plague, it requires movement which can be easily done with the joystick, so the plague should do as well or better then she does on pc.
---
&gt;Well i always soft patrol, mainly because im really scared ill lose my kil and have to deal with running around a piece of shit while the gens get done,
---
Pathetic.
---
&gt; maybes some game should put some Chili on the web... I tunneel mainly because the survivor unhooking them right in my face and i wanna teach a lesson.
---
Lol yea you teach them not to get unhooked.
---
&gt; I get shit on for both of these, because im a bad killer i guess 
---
Oh , you don't even have to guess.
---
cleansing totems is the most boring fucking thing ever
---
Frebby f tier 7 seconds
---
The Legion did something to piss the Entity off when they arrived, obviously lol
---
What you expect if you can get down from 1 hit.
---
2 god nurses
---
Hasn‚Äôt BBQ only appeared in the SoS once since it was released?
---
Well considering the fact that the Killer is supposed to make sure they suffer and experience as much fear and false hope as possible.
---
Securing the kill sounds like a stupid excuse.
---
Let's be honest boys and the girls the game is designed with a specific way to play in mind and camping is not one of those ways. You can tell  because if you constantly do it you will not rank up and therefore they are clearly not trying to reward you for camping. 
---
I wish teammates were smarter and just didn't take the risk once we realize a Legion is the killer. 
---
You never should have touched him in the first place your soul has already been Damned
---
it's what they deserve. 
---
Every time
---
For a sub who hates ochido so much he seems to live in your heads rent free.
---
very nice but ew look at that perk build
---
Are you using M&amp;A for your terror radius while they're asleep? If so may I ask why? 
---
ok 
---
Tunneling: Honestly it depends on who I see after you get unhooked. If I see someone else Ill try and go for them instead. If there's an obsession I am going to have to slug because I don't want to take a Decisive. Of course I will tunnel you if you A. are the last survivor or B. want to get tunneled (ex: Mori Me Dad) because I'm sure both of us want to have fun.
---
Camping: The only time I camp is to secure a kill when the exit gates are powered since there is nothing else I can do without letting them unhooked. Insidious Leatherface for me is kinda lame for the victim and the other survivors but I can look past it as it's pretty much a meme build and it makes sense that he would be hiding due to some instances in the movies.
---
On Ps4 the last four Wraiths I played against literally invisible face camped/ tunneled me.  At least I was the only kill in those games for what that was worth. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
run out crying? they‚Äôre not the one posting about it on reddit, just saying :P
---
No. But if I piss someone off I wanna know why. 
---
Unreal Engine 4 i believe.
---
Oh I like that build, I'll give it a try! Thanks :) 
---
You'll get used to the camera in time. And with survivor, perks frequently help the game feel more fun, so as you level, that'll help. Try finding friends to play with, as that can help it seem more fun (and if they're more experienced they can help with the killer and if they're noobs too, at least you have someone to complain with.) 
---
If you haven't already, you can get 50k bloodpoints for doing the tutorials in the menu, which is a nice little boost in the beginning. 
---
Personally, something that always gets me interested in playing is seeing what other people are doing, so check out some youtube videos or twitch streamers if you think that'll help you. It'll also help you figure out how to run the killer around. 
---
Also, I'm goal oriented, so focusing on, for example, getting a character to level 50 or getting a certain achievement, usually helps keep me motivated. I'd try and find some perks that you're interested in trying, figure out how to get them (what characters to level,) and focus your attention on doing so. It's nice to know a reward is waiting for you once you put the effort it. While, at the same time, more practice is letting you get better at the game.
---
this might mean you lost connection or something.
---
I had a tunneling Myers with Tombstone Piece who was like following me through all the endgame while final gens got fixed. Wasted his T3 because he tried to bloodlust me near 2 pallets. Promised to tunnel me next time he sees me playing, I was like "are these some news?" 
---
He could have grabbed you silly Mikey
---
Because this is a laughably bad tier list. 
---
no need to get mad at me when it wasn‚Äôt even me that wasted 2 minutes of your day
---
That is actually a big brain idea, playing Freddy at rank 20 because no one understands all of Dream Demon's effects.
---
You‚Äôve never faced a camping/tunneling LF?? You‚Äôre not playing on PS4, are you?
---
Survivor stays fresh in my opinion as soon as you get all the perks. Lets you run all sorts of crazy perk builds, which can always be fun. But I'd play killer as well! It's best to balance the two. Plus, with new survivors and killers coming out every three months, it's usually easy to stay invested. 
---
But ultimately, the game is as fun as you make it. If you run the same things and focus on doing the same things every game, it will probably get repetitive. Even when I feel that way, I usually come back to playing DBD after a couple weeks, since it's such a unique game. I highly recommend!
---
New Billy? P3 lol
---
Good to know. Added Shattered Bloodline to the list
---

---
So Bubba is a must. I'll get him
---
keep giving me these brainless replies thx
---
Doubt you pissed anyone off but the tier list is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. I  am 100% if you put more time into killers like spirit or billy that you could achieve way more success then trapper, but if he‚Äôs who you like to play, you should play him anyway.
---
I'm surprised by the number of people who don't know how the traps work, even the Pig herself. I blew some killer's world as he watched me jump through hatch with one on my head. He had no idea it was possible lol
---
She was looking at the snow falling down
---
Good to know. I'll probably buy all of them because I'm stupid. Ty ;D
---
Completely forgot about Of Flesh and Mud. Ty :D
---
Yeah, exactly. Also if the killer disconnects. Survivors should not be dropping from that.
---
I can't say I really find skillchecks fun per se, but fair enough!
---
I'll 100% get the Spirit too, but it will probably be on the next sale, gotta work on my killer skills. The Doctor seems very fun to play. Ty so much :D
---
If you go after the guy injured guy who gets farmed by their teammate, that‚Äôs still tunneling. You can down someone who farms their teammate if they pull someone right in front of you before they can even leave, so if you‚Äôre letting them pull the guy off without even trying to stop him, that‚Äôs 100% tunneling.
---
I mean, you can always give her a go without prestiging her lol. Pretty sure she has some base darker clothing. It's a bit funny to watch the killer walk by you or be unable to find you, but at the same time, it's kind of meh. Worth a try to see if you like the playstyle though.
---
I could be wrong but I though if a killer disconnects everyone got to the point of safety pip
---
well it‚Äôs just satisfying to hit great skill checks, or to just have something to keep me busy. holding a totem for 14 seconds is just dead, not only that but i can get bloodpoints too from hitting the skill checks which are harder to get as survivor. 4 skill checks is automatically more than 1 totem if you just hit the greats.
---
yes, i actually do lol.
---
guess i don't really see him in purple ranks
---
If you die early, you can spectate and see who's playing who. Otherwise, if one gets injured, if you see them you can tell who's who. 
---
Ninja Myers. 
---
If the Map didn't favor Killers they would have under a 50% Kill rate on the map. Instead, their Kill Rate is over 50%
---
I'd wait until you fully level everyone to 50 to get the perks unlocked, then worry about prestiging if you have the extra bloodpoints. There's no real benefit to items or offerings in the prestige bloodwebs, it's just the bloody clothing, so it's meh.
---
Asleep survivors are revealed when they are not in your terror radius, so if it's smaller you're more likely to see a suvivor you have put to sleep.  As Freddy, in order to be effective you need to immediately put survivors to sleep as much as possible, and you can see where other survivors are when you are chasing someone else.
---
i don‚Äôt think the devs ever say that survivors are just meant to be reskins.
---
I‚Äôve been in the killer shack searching the chest that sometimes spawns upstairs then went to leave the killer shack and a Michael ended up turning the corner and smacking me. He had no terror radius because it was the beginning of the game and he was T1. I screamed like hell and scared my friend.
---
Finding decently consistent success with Freddy is one of my most enjoyable experiences of the game.
---
Why do you say they are ochido fans?
---
Good to see legion bot at the bottom 
---
After waiting 30 minutes for a lobby yesterday, we get in, I get found first and some asshat DC'S because they don't like Freddy i guess. After someone else gets downed, they DC as well. Quite unfortunate 
---
Claudette, Meg, Nea, Feng, Jake, David, Dwight. Don't really care about ace or Quentin enough to level them at the moment so I started my killers after Dwight starting with Spirit, Leatherface, Nurse, Huntress and now working on Legion for Discordance and Iron maiden. I'll prolly level Billy after then Hag, Freddy, Wraith then Trapper. I don't own any other survivors or killers ATM so that's the order I'll level them. After I level Trapper if I don't have any new killers or survivors I'll do Quentin then Ace. But I. Sure I'll have Kate before I even finish Hag so I'll level her if I do. Lol sorry for the long explanation
---
Welcome back mate. Leatherface has the best perks BBQ and chilli is the main one. As for the best killers it depends on the style of play you like. I'm best with hillbilly and the doctor. 
---
Jeff probably has asthma with how hard he breathes.
---
When was the last time you played? It's almost almost impossible to pip, let alone reach rank 1 nowadays if you don't unhook a minimum of 2 players, and repair the equivalent of 2 whole generators.
---
Doctor is better than trapper and leatherface IMO. Other that that good list.
---
Feng has as much personality as the rest of the characters lol. They all just have basic backstories that don't really matter all too much, so I don't think it's that big of a deal. 
---
sounds like a stronger doctor
---
If you manage to waste all of their T3 then you‚Äôve basically guaranteed your death at the hands of Michael. 
---
Man I used to be a spirit main and now she‚Äôs in the same spot for me as well
---
In dbd there isn't map wide lighting on every map. Especially in closed maps lighting is much more complicated.
---
Had a teammate dc the second he saw The Pig the other day, then his friend did (ps4 but the names were really close) so they just let me and the other guy farm a bit
---
They use ScaleForm, which is actually fairly tough. 
---
&gt; so if you‚Äôre letting them pull the guy off 
---
It's generally considered rude to interrupt someone pulling a guy off.
---
If you just want something simple to play while you get the hang of things, wraith is a pretty good bet (and free, too). He got buffed a while back and is pretty good now. His power is pretty simple to use, you can't mess it up. Cloak to move quickly and sneak around, uncloak to move really fast for a second and get a longer lunge.
---
Leatherface would also be a pretty safe bet. He doesn't take a ton of skill to use. Not the most powerful out there, but he'd be easy to learn.
---
well technically, it‚Äôs only in your line of sight, but not your characters‚Äô.
---
interesting idea i think that when the crows are alerted they should give you a zero terror raduis and notification
---
Sure. Legion's weak but I like 'em. 
---
Need that Megface. I hate that you can't track how many you've already gotten. 
---
Hope they buff him
---
The lobby times have gotten better recently, so that's a plus size. Usually isn't hard to find a match on either side. A bit harder to find games while playing with friends, but even that has been better recently in my experience. 
---
DLC is usually $7 per pack of killer and survivor. Or $4 for a single character pack (Leatherface and Ash.) Anyone who isn't a licensed killer or survivor can be earned in game using 9000 Iridescent Shards. It really isn't that bad when DLC is only every three months and isn't necessary to continue enjoying the game.
---
Ah thank you sir! I‚Äôve been wondering where that perk comes from. I‚Äôve seen it in a lot of builds, and it is a pretty awesome perk. 
---
Thanks for the advice!! 
---
Holy crap I was that Pig!
---
Trapper is a good starter killer to get back into the groove imo.
---
For beginners, Wraith and Leatherface are user friendly. Doctor as well to be honest. As for Legion, they aren't efficient when it comes to actually downing survivors unless they have the Frank's Mixtape add on. They move  at 110% speed (same as Huntress), which makes conventional chases difficult. They can injure multiple survivors quickly, but good survivors tend to not heal and just focus on gens. 
---
killers already have bloodlust for that.
---

---
Well he can't have it !
---
Often happens when I end up with 2 or 3 randoms that have the same character selected
---
Today I ran into multiple hexes appearing as dull totems! For a few weeks I‚Äôve had this bunch and today it was confirmed. There is a bug on PS4 at least we‚Äôre a hex totem spawns in, looking like a DULL totem. So when you get people who leave the dull behind but go looking for the hex (usually ruin or devour hope sadly in my experience) it literally never gets found. I broke a dull totem on an auto haven map against a Billy that then destroyed his ruin and broke suddenly appearing at the last second as a hex, and making the broken hex noise obviously. And then it kept happening again and again in multiple games on different maps. 
---
TLDR; hex totems are bugged sometimes and spawn in dull on PS4, so just break all the forms from now on to be safe, ok?
---
That's the final boss...
---
I just let people die on hook now because I‚Äôve had this happen while at rank 15, it was rank reset and me and my friend went against a wraith that tunneled and two actual rank 20 davids. My friend got tunneled to death and I did gens while the davids crouched around the map and not doing gens. I had barely been able to get the hatch. Long story short survivors don‚Äôt do shit unless they‚Äôre your friend.
---
No worries at all mate. As for legion survivors don't like him as he breaks a lot of the rules most killers abide by. He is harder to loop as he vaults just as fast as survivors ect. 
---
I think he's trash and don't play as him at all. Legion pig and Freddy are players I don't use. 
---
I bought every DLC as I get excited when a new chapter drops. 
---
I think, yeah! That was a pretty cool match, thanks for that.
---
How often does that happen
---
If you haven‚Äôt gotten a kill and exit gates are powered then secure your kill but not if gens are left
---
They didn't even seem like SWF, but I guess "Hillbilly uses BBQ to find players easily #37983" doesn't have a good sales pitch.
---
Yes, a killer tier list based on your skill. Which is still a laughably bad tier list that is useless to literally anyone that isn‚Äôt you. 
---
This is my friend when he plays Adam, I saved a person who was next to me and my friend was like ‚ÄúWHAT THE HELL?! I HAVE DELIVERANCE LET ME GET A SAVE!‚Äù
---
If the killer doesnt have Iron Grasp, Boil Over can definitely be a nuisance(I know I hate having to deal with it) and Left Behind is for those moments in low ranks when you really don't trust anyone, be it the face and hatch camping killer or the baby survivors screwing up every Gen
---
It's about wolfs wearing sheep clothing
---
damn, your personal tier list is so different from an actual tier list lol.
---
2 safe saves, 2 gens, 3 chases, get hooked at most once and escape and you might pip. 
---
This would be de truth, so no clickbait then XD
---
"Food! Water!.... Atmosphere!"
---
Ayyy look at that... Bros being bros :') 
---
Wait 2 killers?
---
Billy  and BBQ!... ALWAYS!
---
What in the fuckkk
---
Sounds like they brought back the best feature from ye olden days.
---
Friend, it was DELIGHTFUL. D/C'd immediately upon being downed before any generators popped. Post game claimed that they quit because they knew I was mad at them still and was going hard at them.
---
As though they had any idea it was me =P
---
If I'm that close anyway I'm gonna get borrowed timed anyway. And I'm never far for DS to affect me. So yeah. I'll enjoy it.
---
When you get queued against rank 20 survivors and you don't want to ruin their day
---
This happened to me when playing Claudette. I constantly had a larger version of myself obstructing my view and it would clear if i was repairing a gen or healing or any other task. 
---
*apparently 7 minutes and 40 seconds
---
i would die for this to happen !!
---
Ayy they finally doing it lol, now all we need is 8 survivors 
---
I don't like it personally but I also realize why they're doing it. Getting a survivor out of the game neuters a lot of power that the survivors have.
---
As would I.
---
You step on an activated trap. Never happened to you?
---
Oh. Your right. Im blind lol. When I was watching the video I only looked when he picked up the Dwight. But still, Im pretty sure this is from a while ago in a previous version of the game. 
---
im loving the pig still.  i got freddy and plague recently.  and i really want to like her but i am still figuring out the best way to play her.  
---
i use her and freddy i get maybe 1 or 2 kills.  
---
i use pig i get at least 3 every game.  i wanna try the spirit next.  no interest in the legion tbh
---
Sadly, accurate. 
---
How do I trigger this glitch, I love it
---
i recently started playing as a killer as well as survivor, so i feel like i'm a bit more sympathetic to killers than most survivor mains.
---
That being said, i hate playing against Freddy. i won't disconnect, but taking away the player's main sense (sight) on the hopes that one may see the grass moving is very annoying. Even though most matches against freddy i can get at least a few generators done, it still isn't a fun experience. at least with mr.bingbong, you can see his outline even if there isn't any grass/corn.
---
by contrast, Myers is a fun killer to play against, because his "stalk" ability is creepy to the survivors when spotted, and i survive less often against Myers, it is just a more fun game.
---
Sorry you had so many Disconnects, i'm not justifying them, only stating how little fun it is to play against him.
---
Good meme, but bad opinion dude. Spine Chill and Self Care are good perks and in the end of the day it depends on the player if they play selfishly. 
---
Overcharge isn't bad on freddy since you essentially force them to take the regression hit and the notification gives you enough time to put them back into dream state before they can repair it.
---
Is good to see people coming back in a time were all I see is people leaving and the bleeding playerbase. Okaeri.
---
The Plague require a little bit more strategy than trapper but it does compensate specially for the snowball potencial. I would recomend spirit, you will only need good headphones and you're set. Legion is said to be annoying for survivors but they're actually weak withouth franks mixtape and the exploit ocurring right now about infinite mending.
---
All in all, leartherface is the easiest and shoulb be priority for the BBQ. Anyways, welcome back to the game
---
It really is a very situational perk. I‚Äôm running it right now and I have managed to fully use it in only one match, but it came in completely clutch and allowed me a hatch escape. If you play stealthy like me, it may not be the best perk since you focus on urban evading around the map with few interactions with the killer. 
---
&gt; I tunneel mainly because the survivor unhooking them right in my face and i wanna teach a lesson.
---
If you get the person just unhooked, you're not teaching a lesson to the right person. Anyway,
---
&gt; mainly because im really scared ill lose my kil
---
Don't worry too hard about this. When a survivor gets saved that means you know that at least two people are now not doing gens, and at least one person is going to continue not doing gens to save. This is a good time to monitor the generators to find someone else to down so you can try and chain your hooks, interrupt gen progress, and get a sense of where they're working.
---
Yeah, but I‚Äôm mainly talking about cosmetics that you can buy like normal. Or even then, adding cosmetics you have to unlock by playing a character (such as escaping a certain amount of times as Laurie against a Michael, or escaping as Quentin against Freddy a certain amount of times) would be a fair and even deal. 
---
really? you want characters to be exclusively released for one platform just because another one has an exclusive character? i hope you realise it‚Äôs only because valve didn‚Äôt let bill be on console, there‚Äôs nothing bhvr can do about it lmao. this idea is pretty petty in my opinion.
---
Regardless of the strategic reasons, it's always unfun to experience as survivor, but especially - at the beginning of the match. To wait matchmaking for several times (because of the dodges, network issues, high ping etc. ) for really long-ass time (because the game is a freaking matchmaking simulator sometimes) to only be killed in a first 3 minutes because you are being farmed or killer just refuses to leave the hook for whatever reasons they have and get really small amount of bloodpoints, loose your items+addons and waste offerings (and loose a rank too but I couldn't care less about that honestly) is always frustrating.
---
So I made a rule for myself (long before the DS nerf) to never pickup the person who was unhooked the last until I down somebody else. It gives me a lot of bloodpoints and usually survivors get a good amount too unless they are completely potatoes. I can proxy camp if there is totem/90% gen/3gen nearby or if it's the end ge, but I'll always go for the unhooker. I mostly get GGs and very rarely - salt, but that's usually if I have some OP addons+perks combination
---
I do agree it would be amazing to get them (New Nightmare Freddy?) I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna happen unfortunately. Maybe more Ash stuff, but other than that I don‚Äôt think the people that didn‚Äôt agree during the initial contracts would change their minds.
---
Yeah 3 people not doing any gens to progress the game, thats so horrible for the killer!
---
Has anyone ever finish repairing a gen while hex ruin was still active and you walk to the next gen to find out the hex totem was next to the repaired gen?
---
Create a mental map during gen phase where totems could be so that you can focus on finding hex totem in endgame.
---
i really really hate camping, facecamping just as much. however, i hope you camped and tunneled this guy until he died lmao
---
my friend keeps saying Freddy is overpowered no matter how many times i tell her that he‚Äôs extremely weak. i‚Äôm rank 11 and she‚Äôs rank 16, sometimes she‚Äôs able to make it to rank 14 but we‚Äôre just not the best survivors and it‚Äôs hard for her to loop killers because she never looks back. she basically dies almost every match and i t has nothing to do with killers being op, just her not being good enough yet. i‚Äôve told her many times that she just needs to improve but she keeps blaming it on the killers like 'myers terror radius isn‚Äôt big enough!' or, with freddy 'i can‚Äôt see him it‚Äôs so unfair!'. she‚Äôs a survivor main and i guess that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt want to understand how hard it can be as a killer oof (i play survivor and killer almost evenly, i main legion btw)
---
youll have to get used to the fps but i think its worth it.
---
they really badly need to fix the dc issue its so annoying they need to make a more harsh penalty for it
---
Loop Denial would probably be too strong despite being a vulnerable hex perk. we have perfectly adequate perks for countering pallet loops
---
M1 Chaser sounds more annoying than anything. possibly getting the equivalent of a skillcheck fail once per minute would make almost no difference to the game
---
Power Denial is way too situational to use a slot for
---
As a survivor, I'd be so fucking confused.
---
One is playing smart and other is being bad?
---
She's slow, but I feel like it's fair enough considering how nasty her blink can be to play against. I'm rank 15 now and manage to pip each game with her somehow haha (might not have gained much but I tend only to play one or two games at a time). I've also been playing Wraith who has been good fun, double pipped last game against some fully perked out level 12/13 survivors with only 2 Wraith perks equipped. My first game with Billy was awful, I just couldn't get the timing right on the saw and spent most of the game getting teabagged by a Meg with purple perks haha
---
No, that's fine, I'll distract him, YOU go do gens
---
it‚Äôs a beautiful depressed myers tho. we‚Äôll make him hot chocolate and everything will be alright 
---
Actually I like to run both. 
---
Ace Visconti, so chad he pretty much has a build-in Iron Will.
---
It looks like she‚Äôs got a serious case of giraffe neck going on in this one
---
from family guy i made a play on words because in one of the episodes for family guy he said "please sir i would like some more."

About a million 
---
Have you seen Dead by daylight's other Reddit
---
It‚Äôs like a curse. Adept Adam was harder than Adept David for this reason. 
---
oh my god i didn‚Äôt even realize that ahsjsva
---
she‚Äôs still beautiful though lol
---
before prestige:
---
dead hard 3, adrenaline 3, bond 3, borrowed time 3--
---
after prestige:
---
deja vu 3, left behind 3, no one left behind 3, this is not happening 3--
---
I'm assuming he was ripping Oliver Twist then.
---
being unable to disarm traps without a toolbox or certain perk would break the game. you happen to not have a toolbox and the killer places traps at the only ways out? what can you do? it‚Äôs literally gg and holding the game hostage.
---
He has Play with your food on...( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I do have dead by daylight content, what do you mean?
---
Misspallet
---
Fucking me all the time every time I use this goddamn perk. I just wanna meet off the hook, but I'm cursed to he found first when I equip this perk.
---
There'a actually a game called Dead by roblox that's quite similar to DbD
---
Survivor queues are beyond broken on PS4, have been for some time.  If you're a killer main and don't play much survivor you'll be fine but if you play primarily survivor you will be walking into an absolute nightmare on PS4.  SWF is a 20+ minute wait most of the time.  Even solo queue can take upwards of 12+ mins.  It is fucked.
---
i really hate this games community tbh just because of how proud people are of DCing. like they just casually talk about how theyll dc any time something they dont like happens and some times even brag about it.
---
ruining 4 other peoples entertainment because not everything goes your way 24/7 is not something to be happy about. 
---
I still say a window of opportunity timer needs to happen.  Put the pressure on the Survivor to make a move.  The Entity feeds of hope and a timer would justify the lore
---
Yea that's kind of what I was going for. In higher ranks, it's an abundance of nurses and billies and this would give you a tool against them. But for killers like wraith it would be a wasted slot, which would indirectly buff M1 killers. So as a survivor you would have to take into account the meta youre seeing at your rank and decide if it's worth it. Much like mettle of man.
---
Haven‚Äôt played in a while, are 3 survivor games still a big problem?
---
Dude, playing the best and most difficult character in the game right of the bat is not a good idea. May aswell just play every killer and get a feel for them, the reason I'm telling this guy is because on console nurse gets bullied to oblivion. Your logic doesn't make any sense, how can you understand the game when you limit yourself to the highest skill cap character. It doesn't make any sense.
---
Use decisive strike then...and maybe mettle of man
---
Nooooooooooo buuuudy knows, the trouble I've seen
---
Totally agree. Playing against Freddy is just annoying
---
I really hope they could make a game mode like this with 8 survivors 
---
Oof...
---
i prefer the meg one cuz it makes him look like a goblin
---
I never wait more than 5mins for any game no matter the amount of SWF..  It maybe just your region or times you play the game
---
That does it. I'm maining Wraith on PS4 to clear his name. We're not all heathens. 
---
Yeah. It's so freaking depressing. 
---
I have all dlcs and for some reason all my dailies are for Legion... they really be wanting me to be play legion. 
---
Gee Bill, how come your mom lets you have **TWO** Killers?
---
I personally think that the plague is weak but it can be op sometimes.
---
This, exactly. I‚Äôve ran that build a bit and it sure does an excellent job at wasting the killers time 
---
4 survivors and the dash is the killer. One of the survivors DCed on loading in. 
---
I've managed to get to Rank 1 as Killer but I haven't had much luck on the Survivor side.
---
I haven't been able to get past RanK 8 solo and I haven't seen a single Survivor past RanK 4 when I'm playing Killer. 
---
I think the new system is just to hard on Survivor.
---
For Power Denial, what are you counting as a non-basic attack? Obviously the chainsaws, but anything else?
---
For M1 Chaser, the gen most closely being worked on will often times be quote far way. And the Ruin synergy would make it even more annoying and I just do not like annoying, passive perks. Even if viable I'm just never going to like that one.
---
For Loop Denial, mixing up the meta should not come at the price of removing survivors' primary tool. *Maybe* if pallets were not so RNG reliant. And really instead of doing a perk like that I'd prefer to see a different system for pallets overall and a tweak to notoriously bad buildings like the Ironworks and Disturbed Ward.
---
And as a general thought, adding more perks is fine, but I'd like to see them be interactive, and existing perks just need to be made more viable
---
they were aids to play against
---
I seem to get the one to play as cannibal far more often than to play as Freddy or Michael. Not sure if the spawn rate is random
---
lol, but yet you found the latest post over a month ago... Seems like this killer needs to camp and tunnel more
---
This is cute and wholesome!
---
He looks like scottjund 
---
Thank you for the info! 
---
I will for sure try out the wraith, and it looks like I will buy leather face for the barbecue and chilli perk. 
---
Fun fact, I got into this game in the first place because of the nurse. However, first run through of the game and I was super into playing survivors. I never have actually played the nurse. 
---
Ah gotcha that makes sense. I don‚Äôt want people not to have fun while playing the game, and have it be super one sided. That just sounds boring and lame. 
---
My region is East Coast United States one of the most populated ones out there for gamers and my playtimes range anywhere from Noon all the way through 2AM and everything in between.  I am typically surprised when I can actually get reasonable survivor queues.  Without exaggerating they have been exactly as bad as I've described for the better part of a year 90% of my play attempts.  In 40 minutes I got 1 queue yesterday in a 2 man after 20 minutes.  We gave up after the next 20 min queue.  I switched to solo where I didn't get a queue after 12 and just switched to killer where lobbies are instant for us.  Unless it's a seasonal event or I'm just very lucky I cannot get reasonable survivor queues 
---
But you don't have to play him to level him
---
not understanding this one..  please explain 
---
Why are we here.
---
Just to suffer.
---
Other games  have developed ways for it to not penalize those who are forcibly disconnected by accident and only punish those who quit.  Still don‚Äôt see why DBD hasn‚Äôt at least attempted to do it. Then again with the fact that they are making us on PS4 keep the broken matchmaking just because they couldn‚Äôt patch it on PC, I guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised. PS4 is rage quit city. It‚Äôs almost impossible to play killer fairly sometimes and I usually end up pitying the remaining survivor(s) and let them go. And then on the flip side, Survivor not only takes forever to que but is miserable to play due to the rage quitters, toxic killers who don‚Äôt care and camp or hard tunnel, and asshole teammates. So many deadweight teammates who do nothing while I‚Äôm chased or on the hook the whole game. They do enough for hatch capability and then wait and hide. It‚Äôs a good thing that doesn‚Äôt promise a pip anymore so at least they aren‚Äôt truly benefiting from being toxic trash. Not to mention the ones who also continuously sandbag everyone. Then feign innocence when confronted about it. I‚Äôm constantly getting games where I‚Äôm the first or second to die, usually abandoned and sometimes betrayed by teammates I stuck my neck out to save. I‚Äôve done/assisted with both gens that are done, and yet I‚Äôm still the top of the board with BP earnings even after the entire game is over. Even when one of those dead weight survivors lives. So many games when 2/4 of the players didn‚Äôt even surpass 6-7k bop warning because they were either hard tunneled to death or hide like a coward all game. 3rd person usually only barely breaks 10k and usually only because they get lucky with the hatch. And then there‚Äôs me with about 12-15k and either a depip or safety pip. And yet I‚Äôm still top two always. And killer gets like 20-30k BP. That‚Äôs fair. üôÑ
---
The Rage Quitting and some of the toxicity is becoming an more and more un-ignorable problem that‚Äôs just getting worse. Rage Quitting Doesn‚Äôt hurt Killers AT ALL. Only hurts the Survivors in the long run.  Especially on console where everyone knew the reporting system did nothing before the Ochido ban. And even now, it‚Äôs still a joke. 
---
"LOL if Legion appears I just DC lol nope to that!"
---
"Omg why are so many killers DCing I can't get a game."
---
I've never DCed intentionally. It's rude, for one. But also there's so much hypocrisy here. 
---
If anyone has EVER, once, intentionally DCed, then they should stop complaining about it happening to or affecting them. 
---
No, it is not
---
I get it!
---
wait how? new upcoming mod?
---
I'm surprised her character even has an animation for that. 
---
I only blame my team mates for me getting tunneled off a hook, if your pulling me off when the killer is chasing you or if he‚Äôs nearby. That‚Äôs on my team mate. They should be popping gens.
---
I just thought of a different version of M1. Check the edit.
---
Also had it where i couldnt see how far the mend bar was depleted due to frenzy hits, was suprised when I found out he had mixed taped. Woulda played a little differently if i knew i had 1 less hit to take as I had dead hard.
---
Unless people agree with him, which there have been a few people here that have. 
---
I dont know why but I dont even run deliverance, yet I almost always Kobe off the hook. 
---
I had like 15 or 20 games this weekend with one or two disconnects. 
---
yeah, people (survivors) really hate that perk. i don't really care, i prefer it to Ruin, but others get pissed about it, especially in the after-trial chat
---
That is the norm for me when attempting swf.  Occasionally I'll get a good day where we bang out queues in just a couple minutes and when it happens it's amazing.  But those are so far and few between.  The new queue system with the timer completely fixed our queues but then they reverted the change back to the old one.  I cannot convince some of my friends to even try to play anymore due to campfire simulator marathons. 
---
my best advice is if it takes too long just switch the host
---
jesus, why do you play this game if you get triggered by getting hit while youre on the hook
---
I made the joke that we got games because I bought Ash and Slashy Ashy so the entity was please with my support
---
*tips straw hat*
---
Fuck, that‚Äôs a shame
---
I can see why there‚Äôs a lot of discussion about it now
---
I dont have Alot of perks on Hilly and my only killer teachables are hag perks so i just do. Devour with chainsaw makes sense, ruin, erduring just incase and lightborn incase of topiƒá survs
---
I would love a 8v2 mode. Or just a bigger lobby option of some kind. They would have to make it so you can't killer stack (like two Nurses), but I'd play the shit out of that mode. Maybe it's possible with dedicated servers.
---
No you don‚Äôt, stop telling him or her that, you might make there head swell... lol
---
I agree, p3 will def be even more of a badge of honor if it was like that.
---
Yep that‚Äôs the point
---
I agree man, I'm trying to vary my play, but I definitely enjoy her and Wraith the most. I like Myers but I get too focused on the chase as him. Trapper is fun enough, Doctor I don't really like much, Huntress I don't really enjoy.
---
I haven't played Hag yet, but I will at some point. I really want to get the Spirit and the Plague, they both look really fun.
---
2001 down votes now!
---
NOED otherwise known as No one escapes death.
---
It is a Hex totem that appears when the exit gates are powered. The main effect is that survivors suffer from the exposed status effect (Insta down)
---
Most people consider this perk a crutch perk (which it really is tbh). 
---
The perk can be nullified by breaking all dull totems before you pop the last gen.
---
IMO NOED is only good for newer killers who need help securing kills or on newer killers added to the game so while your learning them you can land a few kills.
---
If they didn't escape alive then they haven't won anything. If survivors stopped patting themselves on the back after five gens are completed, and didn't feel entitled to victory just because of it, most of the resentment over perks like NOED would dissolve. There's this idea that it's "stealing" your well-earned escape away from players, it's silly. 
---
Did you just take a frontpage post and repost it with a different title?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bak1yn/a_close_look_at_what_happens_when_you_run_no/
---
Nice. A lot better imo
---
Never had to deal with SWF queues as I've only ever been a solo surv (can't convince my friends to play with me :/) but I've heard the horror stories. Hopefully the server rework in summer will do something about it.
---
Probably people playing in SWF.
---
*  Added a new line of sight check for totem spawn points within 32m from a survivor spawn point. 
---
No sir, by the way what the hell are morals.
---
So the fact that the killer teleports to the start of the pallet again is fair? Why not the end if he's 75% through it already? It's one-sided bullshit. Incoming crying survivor mains
---
Wow someone actually was crying about it? Doesn‚Äôt surprise me bows days, everyone cry‚Äôs about the stupidest shit if they can‚Äôt have it there way. 
---
I tunnel, mostly because it's my objective to sacrifice everyone, and I'm less effective at doing that if I stop in the middle of a chase and follow someone else. Camping is just horrible.
---
I have p3 Claudette (although I have cosmetics from the store and don‚Äôt use the bloody outfit). Right now, I‚Äôm running lithe, urban, iron will, and mettle of man. I replaced empathy with mettle of man. They use the same perks because they work - they‚Äôre good for a stealth play. I‚Äôll switch perks on and off, though I always keep lithe and urban, but I always end up back to the initial four. 
---
Finally got my partner to play with me the last few days. He was very annoyed with it last night. 
---
And Autodidact shows up in every bloodweb -_-
---
Nurse's favorite perk   
---
^(it's a joke btw)
---
Makes it also easier to locate IMO. Just go wherever you saw the killer came from.
---
Plague is stronger but as a Doctor main I must advocate for him. 
---
‚ÄúI Think We‚Äôve Done A Good Job So Far‚Äù
---
but the gates are color coded so only survivors from the teams color can exit from it. So the survivors cant just wire rush 1 gate and all get out. . . :) 
---
I thought it was more funny with that title
---
Right, just stating the obvious fact.
---
Camping and Tunneling really shouldn't be lumped as one thing. Tunneling is MUCH more likely to be optimal play in order to get the 4k than camping is. Camping against good survivors is literally just throwing the rest of the game to secure 1 kill.
---
Isn't that just normal sprinting
---
I bet you were the one who used DS before the change and who Tbags all the time.
---
No you sprint and say crouch in a corner the scratch marks keep going for the distance they would go for 3 seconds of sprinting after you stop
---
With Deliverance: whole team comes to try and save you
---
Without Deliverance: Everybody does gens while you're hooked
---
Every. Damn. Time.
---
I'm at just over 250 (with less than 20 on killer but enough to see it on that side, and watch videos from their POV) and I think I'm just now starting to get "ok" at survivor. Maps take a long time to learn, looping takes practice, etc. Videos were watched, and slowly starting to turn it into practical application. I settle around rank 8 though, so obviously not the best.
---
Ah ok I thought you meant a perk that did literally nothing lol. Your perk sounds interesting though.
---
Well rip that then.
---
So broken to keep getting ultra rare key over and over. üòÇ
---
Yeah I didn't think this would fly over so many people's heads lol.
---
That‚Äôs why you have bloodlust. Speed ups the chase. If you can‚Äôt use the advantages given to you as killer to counteract survivor advantages maybe you just ain‚Äôt good. If you‚Äôre being looped then just find someone else. Maybe one that‚Äôs working on a gen to prolong the trial. It‚Äôs not that hard.
---
Docs not free on pc? What?
---
The hallowed blight outfit is pretty good imo, the BBQ event mallet ‚ÄúPro-Pain‚Äù is dope.
---
If you didn‚Äôt care why did you waste your time sending him a message?
---
Unpopular opinion, but I'm a pig main. All 3 DLC's are awesome, and I think Make Your Choice and Surveilance are really worth it. But hey, depends on your playstyle.
---
They changed it in the plague dlc patch
---
People are downvoting more likely for the first sentence than they are you wasting items and playing how you want. It comes off as arrogant.
---
I've actually been watching a ton of YouTube on perks, gameplay...you name it. I tend to need to know what everything does. Monto, TheKing, &amp; DamnNoHTML are a few of the ones I watch ( and can remember the names). Using Whispers &amp; BBQ &amp; Chili will be great. This is a horror fans wet dream. Yesssss,  come rescue your hooked survivor. You don't need a generator! 
---
Sorry, got excited.
---
I hate the pro-pain mallet and Hallowed still looks worse than P3 IMO
---
Survivors are all more or less skins of one another. Their mechanics don‚Äôt change. Killers are all different. If you prestige the one you like, it‚Äôs a much bigger difference than prestiging the survivor you like.
---
someone linked a Tru3 video with Myers &amp; Nurse a few days ago in a discussion about this same thing, so it was definitely after liscensed killers, but i want you to know i appreciated your Star Wars joke anyway :p
---
Thanks for all the advice! As soon as my stitches are out,  I'm in. I appreciate everything!  &lt;3
---
For how good it is against tunneling, no one runs it.   Bitching and moaning post-game and reddit is the preferred method apparently.
---
Ruin is always good, nurses and sloppy butcher might be good if they decide to heal. If they stay in injured thanatophobia might be a nice addition.
---
Obligatory r/dbdgonewild
---
Bloodhound,nurses,butcher, and the clown perk(can‚Äôt remember its name) are fun to run, however could be seen as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù
---
Isnt that a myth?
---
Correction, buy BBQ and Chili, it also comes with a killer if you buy it instead of getting it from the shrine. Also her doctor and get BBQ to max on him. You‚Äôll be rolling in BPs.
---
The one laughing at the end of a chase is me because MoM never activates and never will if hit with dash attacks. üòÄ I love cocky ash players that tbag in the middle of a chase just so they think MoM will activate. Boom, dash. Jokes on them.
---
the best part is you really never see it as you are playing him though...unless you mori everyone, every game :P
---
Bamboozle or coulraphobia?
---
But what if I use a combination of Pharmacy and Bond to get healed by other people and quickly heal other people?
---
Does that make me a Chad? A Virgin? A Chargin?
---
Coulraphobia! Thank you
---
I think that was one of the selling points of the console version. I believe that it came with some DLC killers. I don‚Äôt know though because when I got back into the game recently, I had huntress and I never bought her.
---
since day 1 of his release i've called him buggzy, because he honestly just looks like an adult version of buggzy in my humble opinion
---
Pretty useless to get multiple in one match. "Worst case scenario" is that 4 people get 1 skeleton key added to their inventory
---
question #1
---
i would say hillbilly he can be hard to learn but he can be a big threat when played well he has some pretty good perks and he has a lot of map pressure its fun to sprint around the map.
---
question #2
---
the reason why is  because he is the only killer survivors cant counter except the nurse and he takes waaaay less skill than the nurse does hes practically the most brainless killer in the game
---
Wraiths and tunneling are like pb and fucking j üôÑ
---
No one but I obviously hurt you lame ass bitches feelings who use noed. Just know you're trash,all you ever will be. Big Facts, end of discussion lames. LMFAOOOOOO!!!! üëå‚úåüñï
---
Ewww self care? Real men use Pharmacy.
---
Some neck stretching after hard sweaty game
---
lol This game is a joke.
---
Why do so many players get triggered when a survivor butt dances after a pallet or in an exit gate? It‚Äôs called BM for a reason.
---
he didnt say anything in that regard?
---
Thx for your help
---
Thank you, next
---
Eh. I think it's fun to prioritize particular survivors over others. I judge survivors based on how stupid they play in game. I let survivors that are unpredictable and selfless go. Like, if three of your pals are in the basement, I hit you once and then lose you, I patrol around and you walk right past me and dart into the basement... I'll watch as your whole squad walks out free, because you have adamantium balls. 
---
If you run away and hide for the hatch I'll shove my foot so far up y
---
Is the vault boost from SC actually gone? I‚Äôve not heard about this.
---
lol very accurate.
---
And then there‚Äôs 2 since the one asshole doesn‚Äôt want to deal with Legion leaving 2 people to deal with 5 gens
---
That someone will be the killer.
---
&gt;obsession is being chased
---
Is there something I don‚Äôt know about obsession?
---
I mean, why else would you need to buy Bubba?
---
I miss the Moon Bouquets, why were they removed from KYF?
---
It's just like the wraith except it can only be done when the nurse is charging a blink
---
Your tier list is wrong, you know.
---
I now average about seven ranks worse than I used to before the changes. Haven't gotten a single merciless killer. Brutal killer is now my end goal. Still pretty fun
---
Tunneling doesn't exist.
---
And camping is boring as fuck, but there's always one or two situations that it's the optimal play.
---
Its not as bad as some make it out to be with the queue times and such. I had a full swf running last night for 2 hours with no queue wait.  We are all around r 15.
---
The vomit stick
---
Ninja myers + infinity tier 3 myers would be broken
---
&gt;	meta-
---
combining form
---
prefix: meta-; prefix: met-
---
1.
---
denoting a change of position or condition.
---
the only thing that actually annoys me is survs waiting in the exit gate when everyone is safe, that's just wasting time for literally everyone
---
tbag and flashlight ingame all you want
---
the reason why i stopped playing survivor and focused more on playing killer lately. and it's not just that, it's the uncoordinated team you get as well and farmers.
---
It's not that all Wraiths tunnel, camp and use Noed. It's just that all tunneling, camping and noed players use Wraith. :P
---
In seriousness though, I play wraith a lot and it disgusts me sometimes to see people play him like that. He can be a lot of fun to just mess around with. :)
---
how the hell
---
My guy let a Claudette live yesterday because she stood around and contributed even though she had the Wiggle Bar glitch. She was grateful.
---
Killers, if you see anyone stuttering and you very well know they have the bug....give them a chance, it's a fucked up experience as it is.
---
Plunderers is legit op. At this point just seeing chests from far away is a bonus. The amount of amazing items I've gotten with it is scary.
---
perks of playing the doctor: he‚Äôs hot
---
perks of playing the plague:
---
oh my god this community is so fucking dramatic, good god
---
When you want to be the lord of the basement.
---
Very true.
---
That was a fast reply. Is it recess?
---
Also the insta-DC lul
---
They removed fast vault for spine chill? Since when? I havent used the perk bc resilience is more consistent.
---
Cant be that great at it if you depend on your team to run builds you want. Liking to win is one thing but trying to manipulate everyoneelse is another.
---
It could also be teams imo. A team of one killer and four survivors vs a team of one killer and four survivors. Whichever team has the most survive, wins. If it‚Äôs tied, go by emblems or bloodpoints.
---
I got huntress and doc free. They should make Doc free for PC.
---
Bro send me a video
---
Either this or someone DCs on their first hook 30 seconds into the game. I always finish games, but it‚Äôs infuriating to know that we nearly all escape with a team of 3 but then lose, but easily could‚Äôve won with a full team of four.
---
AFK farming NOED is my favorite meme
---
All I‚Äôm saying is if I hook a Claudette early the next time I see her or have to choose between 2 survivors to chase I‚Äôm picking her 99% of the time. It‚Äôs a no brainer. I don‚Äôt stand there and camp and wait to keep hooking them. But when the opportunity to full kill someone is there you‚Äôre an idiot if you think you‚Äôre not going to increase your chances of winning.
---
Fair enough, thanks!
---
I haven‚Äôt played much cause I‚Äôve been taking a break, but a couple days ago I got merciless as trapper.
---
I did only once. They were potatoes though.
---
Real REAL men use botany only.
---
Why would we use garbage perks instead?
---
But what are you supposed to do apart from not leaving a large ass scratch mark trail if you've been unhooking an you see the killer lightspeeds back to the hook?
---
Though techincally if tunneled/camped person wants to blame somebody I'd say blame the devs, but in the end it doesn't matter. Being tunneled/camped sucks regardless of who you are blaming for it.
---
tbh, that perk saved my ass so many times from a Spirit who used prayer beads bracelet
---
I main Hillbilly and I typically get brutal and merciless killer.
---
that is true, I think the best thing they could do is make cosmetics for his chainsaw or have different style of chainsaws.  But that might be harder to do with hit boxes and what not.  But I have to think they could do something with it, at least different colors or something....unless you can already do that?
---
Hell, I miss the game looking like this. It had so much atmosphere and the game looks so much worse now.
---
Specifically it's because of them wanting to optimize the game's render pipeline. The Moon Bouquet changes the environment's lighting, which means that everything can be updated in real-time, but the drawback is performance of performing such operations. The devs said they want to 'bake' more lighting in, which means the lighting is created by them before hand to allow the game to skip the intense parts of the lighting calculations.
---
It would take immense work to create different lighting for each map.
---
Perhaps a new method can be created to mimmic the effect of the Bouquet similar to how entering some rooms in the game will darken the screen (Cold Room in The Game, houses with sub-levels on Haddonfield and Springwood).
---
But she doesn‚Äôt really have the same playstyle as the Clown.  Clown functions as just a buffed up M1 killer, his power just shortens loops and shortens the distance survivors can run out of cover before being hit.  Unless you are running that red addon which exposes anyone you hit directly (either the tattooed or the redhead‚Äôs finger, I know one exposes and the other reveals aura but I can‚Äôt remember which is which) his power isn‚Äôt even a ranged attack so much as it is a ranged trap.  I like Clown, he‚Äôs my 4th favorite killer, but that hasn‚Äôt made me like or understand the Plague any more.
---
you have a montage video?  None of the titles say DbD montage, your screenshots are clickbait and i aint buying it.  Comeback when you actually have footage
---
Huntress was a free DLC
---
REAL CHADS ONLY USE NO MITHER
---
Hooked yourself on that one.
---
That would finally kill the game, new players would have the most awful time
---
How do you do this?
---
you‚Äôre being chased by merciless killers who wants to eat your liver and your concern is her makeup??
---
Fuck Stuart Little
---
I do post dbd montages, actually i have 3 out now. My screenshot isn‚Äôt clickbait. If you are too lazy to check, thats fine
---
* *cooperate*, my mate, *cooperate* to distract the killer. 
---
We, as survivors, need to do a lot of good team work, so it's nice all survivors are so eager to *cooperate*! xD
---
That's forbidden by the law and the Holy Heaven
---
Myers/shape was easy for me to get a hang of. Just stalk the shit out of someone until tier 3 or just smack in tier 2 and if you have monitor and abuse, try to pull someone off a gen while in tier 1. He sounds a little complicated but is pretty easy. Honestly I think legions bad because I haven‚Äôt played him.
---
I just tell that I run Deliverance in chat before game.
---
Not very nice of that Trapper to kill steal like that, bet he ninja loots the offering to.
---
You‚Äôre dead wrong though so. There‚Äôs times where doin a gen is better and times when you should just heal yourself so you do not give the killer a free down. Swf I‚Äôll agree that self care is probably a waste but not solo survivor.
---
Yeah but healing yourself means you get the points for altruism instead of your teammate and after you do a Gen or two and get the exit gates youre likely already at red generators so why do more at that point? Your points have to be diversified in order to pip and you cant always rely on healing teammates and getting saves.
---
i wonder what happens if a nurse does it
---
How‚Äôs that any different from treating a survivor like a pi√±ata though? You‚Äôre wasting your time to upset another player and pretty much throwing the game to do so against decent survivors.
---
Yeah Trapper is hit or miss (funny reference). I‚Äôve had games where I run only brown add one and stomp a 4 man swf  w/ 5 gens left and other games where I can‚Äôt get a single hook.
---
I thought the pip happened because of more or less bp. I want more bp too but if i grind with a killer all day I will get a pretty hefty sum. I can get atleast 500-700k in a day if i dont spend any.
---
*accidentally*
---
The DC, totem spawn, and the tea bag Claudette just summed up DBD in 30 seconds.
---
yes. the best way is to get gold in gatekeeper and iridescent everywhere else
---
since when can you stun wraith by shining his body, why has it taken me this long to know this
---
Most survivors hide because they are scared babies that think the killer is hunting them down. When in all reality the killer is probably either A camping hatch waiting for you. Or B they are doing something else and they don‚Äôt even care.
---
No mither and self care have amazing synergy. Can‚Äôt miss that.
---
Yeah exactly, it's going back from solving difficult math-problems to slowly counting on your hands what 2+2 is, fucking legionnoobs need to get good at the game and stop talking on forums.
---
not on my screen when I click on that link.  It shows some crab and some legs in the air
---
Don't whoosh me, but the claws surrounding the obsessions icon in the lower left corner move when the obsession is being chased, so you know for a fact what the killer is currently doing
---
And then there are people who sabotages every trap they see...
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main but ok I just think noed is an ok perk
---
*50 pages of comments for toxicity*
---
No clearly its the survivors that are wrong.
---
Injured is still a one shot though no? If a speed boost is the only difference it seems like trouble. The one shot is whats the big deal. Im going to try what you said and see if it will improve my matches but i bet it won't. Even if it did help my teamates will probably be cleansening themselves.
---
Oh, that might be recommended vids, If you click regent videos it should show up
---
I use no mither pharmacy it just feels better. Mind you I see the merits of running self care.
---
Imagine getting caught in the first place
---
Here comes the "deep pockets" double item pick up perk to the rescue.
---
So what's the problem, exactly?
---
At Rank 14? That's awful buddy.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people bother maining killer, the end of the game is so boring because either you have to have a hatch stand off or get t-bagged at the gate.
---
How dare you call Nea ugly
---
YEET
---
WHERE DID SHE GO
---
It's not a m√©nage, it's teamwork ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Cheers! I snagged the Leader icon, turned it into a "no u"

This happens to me whether I‚Äôm playing solo or with one or two friends. It‚Äôs likely to get 1-2 games in within an hour, which is completely ridiculous. Not to mention those games usually consist of survs dc, Killer dc, afk killers, survs that wanna body block you on stairs and help the killer. Bullshite my friends
---
What you dislike is literally the point. The whole point of "the Legion" is that anyone can be a killer. It doesn't always have to be an imposing meat mountain like Trapper, or a tragic beast like Hag. Sometimes it's the seemingly harmless teenagers who murdered a guy that got in their way and subsequently developed a taste for it. Being someone who works for city, that felt more real to me. But that's just me. On an aside, the Plague's story doesn't involve her even fucking killing anyone yet I see no complaints about that.
---
Ahah, thanks! To be honest, I'm not even in my first 300 hours of game and I can't avoid to stick with premonition yet, although I would like to receive some good advices concerning this, so I can improve my skills! :)
---
Regarding Small Games, I just become a kind of"totem huntress" (without neglecting other objectives, of course) and I saw the difference it played in many matches.. Also, I sometimes play "riskily", using myself as a bait to help my team mates, when the killer has notifications about someone cleansing the totems... üòÖ I hope I'm doing good! :D
---
But I shouldn‚Äôt be forced to play killer to make points for my survivor, survivor point gain needs buffs anyway (and the bloodweb needs to be easier for both sides)
---
Pretty hard to get when i play wraith and Freddy :/ because i want to unlock the achivments
---
Calm down, Thanos.
---
yeah same tbh
---
If the survivors are immediately around the hook, why leave? You can probably get some hits in. That's the only situation I camp and it wouldn't happen if survivors were sneakier/more patient
---
Hard to do that when your tools were left behind because an Eldritch god kidnapped you. Starting to feel like Ash was a horrible choice since you lot keep forgetting the rules of the trial.
---
Because not all killer mains are bad. 
---
I usually don‚Äôt end up in stand offs because I don‚Äôt like slugging and I typically kill all survivors before they get 2 gens done.
---
Also you can‚Äôt t bag me at the gate if you can‚Äôt do gens lol.
---
Loved that show growing up lol
---
Ah thank you. I was very confused, but happy cus huntress is creepy and cool af.
---
Well of course it‚Äôs not going to be easy on them, especially if you are going for Adept. I wish you luck man.
---
It used to be,  but I have had 2 killers DC over the last two days, in both cases I did actually lose a pip (it remained gone) ...
---
I wish it took me a few minutes with a friend. Managed to find two games in an hour and a half earlier. Sad times.
---
&gt; Or B they are doing something else and they don‚Äôt even care.
---
spamming traps to max out points
---
It's an epidemic
---
Didn‚Äôt really mean for it to sound that way, but oh well. I‚Äôm not editing it haha. People see a high downvote number and just start the train lol
---
True that lol
---
Exactly! Or in my case chainsaw sprinting around the map for sprint points and the possibility of finding them.
---
It‚Äôs not common sense against any decent survivors imo. When you go after injured person the healthy one will just go back to pushing gens, but if you go after healthy one, now you have one in chase and one selfcaring/looking for teammates and being healed by them. In most cases it‚Äôs better to split pressure than go after one person while other 3 are doing gens.
---
I only play survivor if one or two of my friends are online because it‚Äôs impossible to enjoy gameplay with 3 randoms, especially with the recent amount of garbage tier killers
---
Yeah but that can backfire if everyone assumes you're gonna unhook yourself, but you haven't activated the perk yet.
---
Well if survivors can say "my only options are to loop or gen rush" then I can say my only options are to tunnel and camp. It's just a bad mechanic by the developers that needs work. Friday the 13th does an awesome job of giving the survivors multiple objectives and methodes to escape or survive which creates a more compelling gameplay setting. The ONLY thing DBD has on Friday the 13th is more than one killer to play as.
---
My killer matches were absurd yesterday.
---
Trapper match where the first survivor downed disconnected before even being hooked at the beginning of the match
---
Pig match where a 2 person SWF disconnected the second they saw me
---
on and on
---
Ahah, what can I say in my defense? I like to be helpful and cooperative..! xD
---
I see Amanda vs the Entity.
---
When you pulled out your knife it looked like you were ready for the boss fight.
---
Looked awesome.
---
If you wanna be a slave to 2017 meta then alright mate you do you
---
*Insta-downs add-ons intensify*
---
There's only one pretty survivor in Dbd, and we all know it. 
---
http://imgur.com/u7oNvlr
---
So you‚Äôre telling me you play with ruin up, devour hope, some other bs and never touch them? Because common sense would dictate to take down those hex totems, and the only time people don‚Äôt ... is when they ‚Äúfeel‚Äù isn‚Äôt necessary like with dull‚Äôs (then complain about noed). So like I‚Äôve said a few times now, you either think piping is important enough to try and rank up, or you don‚Äôt and prioritize an escape. That‚Äôs quite literally how it‚Äôs always been even before they made the system harder. Me getting flack for this just shows me there‚Äôs some salty incapable players for me ‚Äúpointing that out‚Äù. People don‚Äôt usually like to hear that they should be trying more and it‚Äôs not the games fault persay without getting salty anyways. Shocker üôÑ
---
Imwheezingjustreadingthiscomment.
---
Lol, says in my post that I‚Äôve only recently started playing killer so obviously I don‚Äôt ¬´kill all survivor before they get 2 gens done.¬ª 
---
Glad you finally got to brag though :)
---
Plague's a little better, but you will never get the satisfaction of a well timed shock stop or fake pallet giggle.
---
I need that no u dude, send it to me üòÇ
---
‚ÄúAsh catch-em in pallet town?‚Äù
---
hitting cars to hear the cool car hitting noise
---
Thank you so much, this makes perfect sense. Would people rather him not have a dream state or pulling survivors into it faster? Not that the other killers aren't unique, but I find his to be one of the more interesting skills in game.
---
I disagree with the ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs bad form‚Äù argument regarding Camping. You‚Äôre a killer. You‚Äôre there to kill. Anything within the game‚Äôs intended rules that make that possible is fair game.
---
That being said, Camping is a ridiculously inefficient way to spend your time, as you deny yourself the vast breadth of other strategies and exciting gameplay moments that arise from hunting while the team is temporarily one person down. As well, it allows the Survivors a chance to accomplish goals without your interference. So yeah, it gets you a kill in the short run, but it really just costs you more in the long run.
---
Also, while I disagree strongly that camping is bad form, I recognize that many Survivors, do. So, in the rare event that campaign makes tactical sense, I ask myself if I really want to consciously be the reason someone else has less fun and head off anyway.
---
In short: Camping isn‚Äôt morally wrong, but it‚Äôs a bad tactical decision that lowers other people‚Äôs fun, so even if they‚Äôre wrong to mislabel it, it makes sense on multiple levels to just avoid it.
---
well no tier list is set and stone its all based on opinion of which order is the best
---
wheres the plague?
---
Don't think anyone that is like '2v8 would be awesome' realize just how incredibly killer sided that would be.  You think tunneling is bad now?  OP here even said they had to let the survivors go cause they just tag teamed the hell out of them.  It'd be ridiculous.
---
That was kind of the point.
---
I think they may have shadow buffed pallets. Noticed a lot more of them lately. Except Coal Tower which still has a crazy dead zone in the back
---
Is that a Snapchat meme? Blasphemy
---
I'm a Wraith main and I don't do those things specifically because so many Wraiths do. You can tell the  camp/tunnel/NOED thing is so pervasive with Wraith though, because I have Survivors thank me for not doing it after our matches, like it's unexpected for me not to be toxic.
---
you find rarer items in the bloodweb more consistently, iirc. of course, on the other hand, it's more expensive to level her up afterwards, and you lose your current perk set until you go through the bloodweb rng again. that being said, you gain a bloody cosmetic, not lose the clean one, so if that sounds appealing to you, go for it! i always make sure i have another character with my preferred perk build set up before i prestige one so i'm not struggling to build points again.
---
I do remember them stating they were increasing the minimum pallet spawn for all the maps, but holy hell the Auto Haven maps are oppressive.
---
Or sitting in the baseball to chat with bubba.
---
It‚Äôs also worse on The Plague because you know exactly how long Pig‚Äôs timers are.  It‚Äôs always going to be 150 seconds once the timer activates, 120 if you have the Tampered Timer, 170 if you have the Annotated Plan, and 140 if you have both.  With Plague‚Äôs power, because the timer speeds up or slows down depending on how much puke they are hit by in each stream, how much they interact with infected items, how much they sprint, how much their sick teammates heal them, etc, you literally have no way of knowing when the infection will take full effect until it does.  You can plan around a known timer, even if it‚Äôs a really damn long timer, but on a timer that jumps and skips around based on a million different variables you can‚Äôt plan shit.
---
Survivors: Evey killer complains about my DS, (prenerf), so I tell them to level up a seperate killer I dont want them to play because he is too OP then spend hours grinding to get that perk on all their other killers.
---
Killers: Im forced to use one of my perk slots to counter a perk most survivors have. But at least I can still use my other perk that helps in the early game so that survivirs cant mindlessly gen rush me while I deal with the survivor perk that I got enduring for.
---
Survivors: Oh my god! NOED and Ruin are so overpowered and unnecessary if your a good killer. I cant belive I need to use Small Game, a perk that counters everything totems, because baby killers rely on crutch perks like NOED and Ruin. I cant belive that I have to use a perk, just to counter a perk the killer MIGHT have. 
---
Also survivors: (After DS nerf) Oh my god! Every killer has enduring and it makes my DS basicly worthless. Enduring shouldnt work on DS because its an antitunnling perk now and killers should be punished for tunneling. 
---
What do you want from us killers?
---
Every killer probably reacts like that because the trap is programmed to create that animation whenever the killer steps in it. The horror of what nurse would look like in the animation scares me
---
Which kind of add-ons do you think are the better ones and which are the worse ones?
---
Damn man, I thought it was only me! I swear I get found first more times when I equip that bloody perk.
---
It took me a sec to get it and then I couldn't stop laughing after I realized I have level 35 leatherface xD
---
I think once I saw a Huntress setting a trap. Pretty much the same Animation
---
Do you know the name of the piece?
---
Ok, try to understand where I'm coming from here. You yourself just said he fucks with you until he kills you, right? Would suddenly appearing out of a window that you're running to NOT count as "fucking with you"?
---
So, you're saying it's more awful to not be good at a game because they're not experienced yet then it is to not even play the game at all? This is not esports or a job. It's a frickin game. You don't lose money if you're "not good" yet. There won't even be a community soon because most people don't have time to or want to sit in a damn lobby waiting for the "perfectly balanced match".
---
this once happened to me and my reaction was to just panic and open task manager end the game as soon as humanly possible
---
unfortunately it is bugged, currently the only difference is lack of teachable perks
---
More than likely it‚Äôs a NEA
---
I love the little EA refference put in there
---
FUCK YEAH
---
Everytime I close my eyes...
---
Incidious
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt really have anything else I‚Äôd like to run instead right now and it distracts them so it does something
---
It isn't even for bragging rights bc you can't prove it in any way
---
Pre 2.6.2, it was only ever useful at Tier 3. Tier 1 and 2, by the time it lit up, it was really too late to be of any good use. Because of this, I don't think many people gave it much of a chance because they didn't want to invest all of the BP and time into hoping T3 showed up. 
---
They buffed it to give the same light up distance at all tiers now (same as old T3).
---
A lot of killers are running Monitor and Abuse lately so they can sneak closer to the survivors, so it not only helps to counter the stealth killers, but also a pretty strong killer meta perk.
---
If you want regression, take huntresses lullaby
---
They should do it like kindred it just pops up in the tight hand corner.
---
You can't run a killer 5 gens and get anything beyond silver in lightbringer cause your being useful by taking the agro
---
How do you not? In both cases people are trying to piss off others.
---
 Yeah good idea! I don‚Äôt really mind one survivor escaping, or even 4, it‚Äôs just annoying that they take so long and drag it out by taunting.
---
Make Ash a killer too? Not canon but an idea.
---
Yea! No one should hurt Dwight in that way!
---
Duh, I thought everybody knew this /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
You don't understand, if you just play a different character it feels cheap, also, think about all the wasted bloodpoints
---
Ooooh
---
Because the way we‚Äôre scored makes little sense. Usually you can better your own score without needing the opponent to do anything: but for Dbd if the killer doesn‚Äôt hook?That‚Äôs a lot of not half of your points down. Running the killer doesn‚Äôt reward much so if you‚Äôre stuck running them- you get duck all.  I felt the old way was honestly better, it was easy  to just farm sure, but it let people grow and achieve progress, either getting perks or prestige. The rank set apart skill well enough that you wouldn‚Äôt get dogfucked by higher ranks all day. I feel most players would rather the feast over famine when it comes to a grind.

rank?
---
Yeah, I absolutely get that. Fortunately it doesn‚Äôt happen that often to me.
---
Usually it‚Äôs just that they didn‚Äôt finish enough gens for hatch to spawn, so the last one is just walking around the map doing fuck all. Not trying to get gens done but also not letting me kill them.
---
Bloodhound for easier tracking. Whispers. Enduring or Spirit Fury. All better alternatives. Nurse‚Äôs Calling if you feel so inclined
---
1-2 usually is not farming, 3 is half and half, but 4-5 if you are trying during that game then you are a try hard.
---
&gt;Hello readers, I've just started playing Dead by Daylight last week and I've been having a good time so far. I come from Friday the 13th: The Game and I'm quite the fan of asymmetrical horror games, though the two play quite differently. I've got a couple of questions if anyone could help me out.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Firstly, I've unlocked Self Care in the bloodweb from the Shrine of Secrets but after about 10 levels with Ash, it's not appeared yet. Is there a specific time teachables will appear in the bloodweb or is it just luck of the draw? Are they common or uncommon?
---
Purely random. Perks are tagged with a rarity will will affect their chances of showing up in the bloodweb.
---
&gt;Secondly, I've seen some players claim that stealth is pointless and is kind of punished by diminishing your score. Would I be correct in assuming stealth is important mostly when the killer is near and I want to remain undetected, or should I run away and try to loop them to buy time for team mates?
---
Pure stealth is frowned upon. But you should be doing a mix of both. 
---
&gt;Lastly, I've seen the acronym 'SWF' used quite a lot. Am I right in assuming it stands for 'squad with flashlights', kind of like a pre-made killer pestering squad?
---
SWF = Survive With Friends. A premade survivor group.
---
I|II
---
II|L
---
I would not recommend Whispers as a perk unless you really don‚Äôt need another perk/don‚Äôt have anything better.
---
If you can bear the horrible grind of Cannibal I would recommend BBQ instead as it is significantly more useful earlier in the match and grants more BP.
---
Keep at it the game is horrendous for new players to learn my advice pay attention to loops on maps and try your hardest to push survivors away from them, also watch videos even at nearly 2000 hours in I still learn things from videos, keep at it you will learn üòÄ
---
As far as finding a specific perk in your bloodweb, it's purely down to luck. I'd recommend taking *every perk you see* rather than skipping over ones you don't like since they'll stop appearing once you get the tier 3 version of it, so the chances of the perk you want showing up will be higher.
---
Stealth will typically give you less points than getting chased by the killer, although if you remain undetected you're also able to go work on generators when the killer leaves.
---
SWF = Survive With Friends. Basically a pre-made group.
---
Pls dont use it
---
3 player games and that one player who DCs when they are downed. Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee \*sadface\*
---
Well, I was thinking of it more like how Soulcalibur had different exclusives based on the console you bought.  Xbox owners could get their own characters as well.  But mostly I want to see Until Dawn brought in, but I doubt Sony would share an exclusive title with anybody else.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I see! Thanks very much for the reply :)
---
Ohh that's what I've been doing wrong then, I've been skipping over the perks that appeal to me less in favour of rare consumables. I'll start picking up perks first, thanks very much for the response!
---
Stealth is useful, running perks like quick and quiet or iron will can make you harder to detect during chases or just in general. You do want to learn to loop killers for when they find you, but you don‚Äôt actively seek out a chase if you‚Äôre trying to escape. SWF stands for Survive With Friends, it‚Äôs disliked because it allows you to play with friends and usually friends that play together communicate, making the game a real 1v4 and much much harder for the killer.
---
I hope this is prepping them for the 2 killers vs 8 survivors thing.
---
No she isnt bad, but its a lot harder on console. Its not impossible but to me and me alone a nurse on console that is god tier is a scary sight.
---
If you're not shit, then DH gets you an extra loop in the worst case, or gets you to a pallet/vault you wouldn't have reached otherwise in the best case.
---
To be fair. Its not faster for someone else to heal you unless they use a medkit in terms of time management. It still takes two people to do it
---
That's true. Have caught myself doing it before too~
---
It is also a waist of the pig her power.
---
Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (3vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other three players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught and killed.
---
Thank you! I'm t r y i n g my best
---
Lmao. But tbh using deliverance with the new DS has been amazing for me.
---
Activate windows tho
---
Is there anybody who wouldn‚Äôt?
---
If Pig is not in the number one spot I cannot take you serious.
---
I mean yes other killers might kill better but no one OINKS better.
---
I mean people are gonna use it if they want to, it's like telling survivors to not use adrenaline, no one is actually going to listen :/
---
Wow, I thought it was just me. I stopped playing like a month or so back when they were trying their "match making fix" that was causing me to sit in Queues for like 10 mins even during Prime PST hours.. figured I'd play something else and let them iron this shit out.. fired it up on Thursday at my normal time, I'd play and holy fuck.. People get downed.. DC.. get hooked, suicide on hook.. after 4 or 5 games of that.. i figured I'd switch over to killer.. 3 games of that.. only 1 started with 4 people.. and of course.. DC and insta sucide.. just closed out and went back to playing other shit. 
---
I didn't even want to try and deal with a free weekend and that clownshoes BS.. also, with all the MM issues and crap going on.. I wouldn't think this is would be the weekend you'd want to try to introduce people to your game. Honestly, I'd wish they'd just stop cranking out content every 3 months or some dumb ass Switch port and spend the next 6 months or more fixing bugs and balance.
---
Whispers and BBQ&amp;C aren‚Äôt that comparable though. BBQ is extremely easy to counter and you have to actually hook someone for it to be active. If there‚Äôs only one survivor left BBQ won‚Äôt help you.
---
They‚Äôre both good tracking perks but in different ways. You‚Äôll always have Whispers active no matter if you hook someone or not. There‚Äôs also no way to run around it except being extremely good at hiding.
---
I have learned to stop hating and love the game. I no longer get mad when I ‚Äúlose‚Äù as I‚Äôm just trying to go and play ‚ÄúAuthentic‚Äù like a movie villain or something. 
---
Even when Survivors roflstomp me I‚Äôm fine and just say gg afterwards.
---
One of my favorite pastimes now is trying to make angry people in after game chat even angrier.
---
The game is so much more relaxing now. I‚Äôve derailed to 9 after this change in play style but now I have more fun.
---
&gt; Of those 2.8 seconds the survivor will get a head start of ~ 2.28 seconds which makes escaping possible but much harder.
---
You mean just impossible unless the killer is grade A stupid as hell
---
Freddy mains, they would hate to see their main be bullied even more. also I can just see the Legion stabbing Myers multiple times as Myers picks them up and kills them.
---
I have those. I just don't like them and don't have issues with tracking/locating and pallets
---
Especially the ones that t-bag after dropping a pallet üëåüèº then when you down them you gotta look at them and nod yes
---
I see no plausible way for any of the other killers to deal with the nurse is she isn‚Äôt just blinking all willy nilly. Her power is super hax compared to all the other killers.
---
If you camp you need to reassess your life choices because I don't understand how people like you can make the game so unfun for everyone. Camping is not fun for anyone.
---
Don't bother levelling up multiple survivors for anything other than the teachable perks you get at level 30, 35 and 40. 
---
Both stealth and being chased can be very fun but you do want to try and stay hidden as long as possible.
---
as survivor and killer i lose a player to DC atleast 60% the time. many are within the first minute of the game. as survivor it‚Äôs annoying but sometimes still doable. as killer, so many people DC if the are hit too early in the game.
---
But couldn't huntress just throw a hatchet after the nurse is stunned from blinking?
---
Meta is based on what is most effective, not what most people use.
---
Just like in league meta changes based on which champions and strategies become stronger/more efficient, not based on which champions are the most popular/used.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ar59x0/fun_facts/
---
I don't know exactly what the add ons are called, but I'd say any that increase the rate that survivors gain sickness is good or how long your vomit stays on things. It depends on whether you want a more crowd control type build or a chase orientated build.
---
I sneak around because those douche nags will down me take me to the hatch to run it in then hook me. Its messed up.
---
Don't ask how to perform bugs/exploits.
---
i was assuming the injuries were realistic. i guess if they had health states, it‚Äôd be a back and forth battle of M1‚Äôs. and the instadown killers would wreck
---
Console came with Doctor and Hag for free
---
Yikes.
---
Classic Meyers, before he kill, he gets that feel.
---
&gt;Incoming crying survivor mains
---
Irony.
---
Don't trigger it on ranked. If you begin to do this purposefully, you will be banned.
---
Feel free to do it in KYF tho. You need to have 6 players, one being the Spectator, and keep having the Killer and the Spectator switching places as the game begins. It's possible to get funny results that way.
---
And if I do it the other way around the injured person will do gens
---
This isn't griefing
---
it honestly was sooo much better. I wish we could go back to it being so dark somehow without it being hellish for killers.
---
Wonder if they could make it super dark for survivors but bright for killers? Shadowborn used to make it brighter for the killer only so it was something they were certainly able to do before
---
Hag will win. Just lay down in the mud until everyone else kill eachother.
---
Then we would have another issue. It wouldn't be Legion anymore unless they found another way to keep vaulting in. Vaulting and multi-hits are Legion it's what makes the killer unique.
---
It would be like Freddy's rework removing the dream world and sleeping.
---
I don't even know what half these do
---
Tons of great ASMR on Youtube if that floats your boat.
---
Elsa looks like the kind of fine young lady who knows how to fit all of it
---
1. Perks just appear in the bloodweb at random times, it took me 100+ levels before I got "we're gonna live forever" on Kate. Don't let that discourage you from getting perks, I just was very unlucky.
---
2. Stealth is not entirely useless, if you can hide from them, do it but try to hide near some pallets in case you get found.
---
3. SWF stands for "survive with friends" and the usual things that happen with those are getting destroyed since the survivors have communication, something that randoms cannot obtain more of than the occasional t-bag, point, and signal to "come here."
---
Hope this helped answer some questions and ask any more if you have any more questions, I'll try my best to answer them
---
I agree that BBQ is generally better but I was suggesting Whispers specifically for when there‚Äôs 1-2 survivors left and you‚Äôre have trouble finding them. I get your point though.
---
Shes just looking at the stars
---
Camping isnt bannable.
---
Tunneling isnt bannable.
---
Please stop this.
---
i imagine he‚Äôll get tier 3 in like 5 seconds if he just stood back and watched
---
Thrill of the hunt?
---
Oh i see what you are talking about. Yeah I agree Whispers is awesome when there are 1-2 left.
---
I think this is more griefing.    
---
Yikes
---
1. The bloodweb is, unfortunately, completely random. You can get a perk on your first level or you can go 50 levels without ever seeing it. If it's any consolation Self Care does pretty much the exact same thing at all levels: the only thing a higher level in Self Care will do is make Medkits consume less charges when you heal yourself.
---
2. If you're looking for points your best bet is honestly to hump gens and unhook people. Chases also give little points, though pallet stuns do give a lot. Stealth is an important skill to have to keep alive. Yes the Killer chasing someone means that they're not chasing someone else, but a Killer chasing no one is also not chasing someone else. If you can stealth around them and get back on the gen it's just as good as getting them to waste time chasing you. Sometimes even better.
---
3. "Squad with Flashlights" lol. It stands for Survive with Friends, the co-op game mode where you can queue with some friends on Steam to play together. It's generally viewed as being a power boost since you can commuicate via various external programs (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak) and provide eachother with information. You can also plan out a strategy with your allies in advance if you have all the time in the world to prepare before heading into a match.
---
I love it!  Claim that victory. Well earned. Hopefully it will teach them to not mess around as much or at least one ass handing will bruise the ego a bit.  Well played sir
---
 Jill's a little whore and her alibis are dirty tricks.
---
What about instead of non-basic attack, it works for any instadown attack instead? So this would include not only the chainsaws, but anything where a survivor has the exposed effect as well...Devour, NOED, Rancor, EW3, Make Your Choice, etc. This way if someone like Wraith is the killer, there is still a chance the perk can be used if they have NOED, for example. It also wouldn‚Äôt be used up on a frenzy attack, which is a complete waste. I‚Äôm not sure how useful the perk is without the speed boost after the miss though.
---
Well, who has the energy and time to explain to this new player?
---
The devs literally made a list for people like you explaining that these are not bannable offenses, among other basic mechanics of the game...
---
Exactly. He just gets ton of evil off the y'all in trouble
---
&gt;Hit all your great skill check
---
im not here to measure dicks with you; im trying to excel at the game.  maybe you're the one who is being short sighted. you don't think i already know to grind points, hit skill checks and use pallets? obviously our standards are different. im trying to hypercarry and you just blame the system.  what rank are you?
---
i personally think shes the most attractive.
---
&gt; Meta is based on what is most effective, not what most people use.
---
Can we at least agree that in that case, the metagame changes as ranks increase? I think we have similar definitions with the exception that I think the meta isn't consistent at every level of play, and therefore not always a set effectiveness for perks.
---
I also think self care is meta, because it is one of the most valuable perks. Agree to disagree.
---
&gt; 
---
Gen rushing is a made up term, it's just the survivors doing their objective.
---
It's a strategy, I have to be able to call it *something*.
---
My theory is a bit better, Hag lays down and the supposed winner is Billy or Myers then Hag pierces their chest with her claw hand and claims victory, but then the Saw theme song plays and Amanda stands up removes her mask and it is revealed that Susie was under the mask with a RBT on to prefend her from talking, then Amanda goes behind Hag places a trap on her and with the push of a button activates both traps as she says GAME OINKER I mean Over.
---
Just a lil bit
---
Just use Kate
---
I was like "yeah this is a pretty cool build but it can't be meta" then I realized when I saw no mither
---
Thanks man this is actually super useful
---
Omg lol
---
Ummm....ok.....?
---
it doesnt mean less, if you see a guy with 55 pages of -reps will you think he is nice or a cunt? exactly
---
Apparently so.  You must be right because every time I‚Äôm in game I look down and see DC‚Äôs all over my team. Lol.  I enjoy the dynamic, it makes for a interesting change up in game, very much so like the Plague even.
---
Our ACM team reviews each report on a case by case basis. Camping is not a bannable offense and no amount of reports is going to change that.
---
Alternatively: the rest of the team rushes gens when the killer is tunneling or camping, thus losing him a ton of points and ultimately the game.
---
I only play killer and NOED is one of the strongest perks, I run it in every build because I can get kills before 5 gens are done.
---
Their cosmetics are honestly really cool looking.
---
Against good survivors, the danger of noed is that it makes it very difficult to loop and transition between loops without getting hit. Being injured allows you to use both Deadhard and Mettle of Man to counteract the killer's speed boost and buy additional time to escape. (It also can make vaulting faster, with Spine Chill and Resilience, although I think that's bugged rn).
---
Good survivors only get hit when they choose to get hit, when they make mistakes, or when the killer is somehow circumventing the "normal" intercept times. (Ranged attacks, teleportation, feral frenzy, bloodlust, noed.)
---
Haha yeah I didn't do enough digging to look properly into SWF, I just saw videos titled stuff like 'toxic SWF' and they all had flashlights to stun the killer so I assumed it was that
---
&gt;Can we at least agree that in that case, the metagame changes as ranks increase
---
But that's not meta? That's people not knowing which things are better or worse. If you are bad at the game and don't know how to play it then easier characters will be better for you. That doesn't make them meta.
---
Nurse isn't any less meta at lower ranks, you are just bad at her. 
---
It's not a strategy, that's literally what you are supposed to do as survivor. If you don't do the main objective you aren't going to win, survivors want to do generators and try to get out, killers try to kill them. It's like saying killing survivors is a strategy.
---
I mean... he is matched up against new players, who might even have just 1 default perk, like in this clip. Of course he'll win every game. Anyone can win these kind of games with enough time put into killer.
---
So true, must remake
---
Great so... how do we do it on ranked tho
---
sure on ps4 its the same name as this account without the underscore
---
Already had this problem, I was playing bill and it started when a hag hit me while I was doing a gen (but she didn't grab me out of the gen).
---
Change ‚Äúfor 100 seconds‚Äù to ‚Äúfor the remainder of the game‚Äù.
---
For me this has happenend twice, both times the killer was hooking someone who then d/c'ed, and for some reason the wiggle bar was transferred to me although i was working on a gen. Pretty good job so far.
---
How will you make the beat of that situation
---
This started from the jump and the enitre team had it. Was so infuriating.
---
About 1/10 matches will load in with three survivors, in my experience. About 1/2 will have a survivor disconnect intentionally.
---
Survivors call everything under the sun camping and tunneling, for starters. And secondly you don‚Äôt actually know if it‚Äôs 55 pages of that. You‚Äôre just taking them at their word because you want it to be true
---
For us it was from the beginning. No one had even been seen yet. But good to know its happening multiple ways.
---
Yea, I was going base or low addons, not God tier.
---
Update, modified him to look less depressed now. He looks more like H 2007 now
---
Camping is lame, while tunnelling/kill rushing is just doing the objective efficiently.
---
You made a mistake. It triggers the tunneled effect for the rest of the match.
---
My main issue with Spine Chill is not the effect it has, but how it moulds players. 
---
If you are new to the game and always use Spine Chill, you'd still rank up like everyone else, but you would hardly ever get any chase experience since you always avoid them.
---
Spine Chill is great for stealth, but it compromises improving your chase game for it. 
---
When the baton is handed over to you, and it's your turn to run the killer, it's literally a rank 20 chase level against a well-rounded rank 5 killer. This is why people in red ranks and purple ranks manage to go down in literally a few seconds, they never got the initial chase experience - a few hundred hours later of playing immersed, and they still haven't got the chase experience that is necessary for their killer of equal rank.
---
So you just recently started playing this game?
---
Yea, but as a Billy main it might be a bit biased
---
this along with the dc pretty much sums up dead by daylight
---
I oofed
---
Bone clapper + rank twenty
---
PC master race
---
How is camping toxic? It's easy to counter, just rush gens then the killer is sitting there doing nothing. You're just toxic.
---
are you gonna queue at the same time he does and facecamp him or something? lol
---
I don't know where to put plague yet since I haven't played a lot, but somewhere in mid tier
---
As a Wraith main I always get called a filthy camper. I had this game where I hooked a Meg and I saw the rest of the survivors running off behind a tree. So I  cloaked and started going to them. Exact situation as it happens in the game.
---
Meg on the hook, Bill fucking deadhards to the hook and just sits there, everyone else piles onto it and unhooks. They all heal her in under a nano second. The exit gates were opened at the time so I had NOED, I knocked all of them and hooked em in the basement. I got harassed in post and had to delete the dumpster fire that my steam comments became. There was about 600 of -reps with racial slurs, calling me Hitler and more.
---
Calm the fuck down survivors y'all mad as shit when you lose

Here is a simple Legion power reword that is thematic:

Power-Multiple Killers.  When being chased by Legion, you see 3 identical copies chasing you, but only 1 is real.

\*\*The game would space them apart and you would not know which was the real 1.

For those of you involved in yesterday's 600+ post, I will be working on those that I said I would over the coming days. There aren't any available and *good* shirtless David models out there that I'm aware of, but CozyChicken is working on one for the important memes that must be made.
---
Me making a meme, a literal joke, is me being salty? Damn, I wonder what you look like when you are salty then if you think jokes are me being angry.
---
I'm just tryna educate people that the climate of the game has changed and the videos from 2017 called "Survivor Top Tips" don't really apply anymore.
---
That‚Äôs what I always say when I bring bloody party streamers and get dodged. Joke‚Äôs on you, buddy (but also on me cause then I gotta wait another 10-15 minutes to find a host again)..
---
Or you could just not report cause it clogs up the system for real issues that have been reported...
---
Nurse: I am a god
---
Imagine being good at finding and chasing survivors.
---
Imagine not be insecure about your abilities, and know you'll catch them later.
---
Imagine making the game fun.
---
If someone is injured with nobody to heal them, all they can do is do a generator.
---
If someone is injured with nobody to heal them, but they have self-care, it makes sense in the short-term to use their perk to heal up. What self-care does is makes it so fewer people who are injured want to do gens, and just heal up instead. It removes the motivation, the "wantingness" of doing generators.
---
This. Yes
---
Gottem
---
If a killer camps, they miss out on a ton of bloodpoints and anyone can just gen rush and end.
---
Thanks, i know my gameplay isnt impressive but these were my early games, im level 15 now, i was 4 in those games, but i am trying to get higher.
---
Beautiful.
---
Art crefit to whoever drew this,i didnt
---
Distressing, unerving, huntress lulaby, remember me.
---
Very useful for new players - infact, I'd say one of the best perks purely for someone about to start their first game. You are right.
---
However, this goes with the fact that I'd expect them to go against a killer of similar experience.
---
I think I discovered why everyone hates Legion so much, it forces survivors to play injured and self care doesnt do a thing.
---
Sexy time has begun
---
Pls do. Even as a player who doesn't use it when I play killer, I get so much benefit out of it's existence and the fact that others do. All of our matches are slower because survivors are cleansing totems, unsure if we're running it.
---
OOKY SPOOKY
---
Too real
---
here is a link to one of the dbd montages :) idk why it is like that... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M3JKoP7cXY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4M3JKoP7cXY)
---
I don‚Äôt think corrupt intervention is worth using. If anything all it will do is cause people to run into your terror radius and you‚Äôll waste all your tier 1 screams too early to be useful.  Also doesn‚Äôt really waste that much survivor time unless they‚Äôre afraid of being in a terror radius.
---
Distressing, bbq, ruin and corrupt intervention or enduring
---
is a garbage.
---
It's a really good perk, enjoy.
---
But do you realise what healing does ? Against a killer like billy I would understand, but being able to take a hit can greatly prolong a chase. It doesnt really make sense to save 32 seconds to not recover one health state, 1/3 of a gen is rarely valuable unless you can complete it right now
---
I can't stand bad things happening to Meg or Kate. Let Bill burn, but save my girls please.
---
i never said toxic...
---
I appreciate that you understand defending a hook when the gates are open. 
---
What Im saying is that if everyone is using borrowed time exclusively for this reason, then you cant bitch about NOED as a counter or tunneling to try and make sure that maybe you take out the 1-2 people that have it. 
---
Im less irritated if it's the last two people and it's used but if I have gotten a lot of hooks but no kills yet and 3 survs bumrush with BT, then yes I'm a little irritated.
---
Am I missing something?
---
This isn't totally true. Being at full health means it takes you 2 hits to go down instead of 1.  If having an extra health state extends the chase for longer than the time to heal then helaing yourself is worthwhile
---
Same feelings here. 
---
Survivor is too boring, too easy to lose, teammates give up and it costs you an entire game unless you also D/C. 
---
Killer is too stressful, being looped and teabagged, toxic post-Chat, kind of sucks. 
---
The problem is that I love the game. It‚Äôs so unique with so many licensed Killers, but we need more content. New Killers/Survivors is cool, but we really need new modes/objectives/dailys/rewards or some kind of incentive to play more.
---
You won‚Äôt get better doing that. Swf rarely are better players than randoms, they just have better communication, which only helps so much. If you‚Äôre better then them, you‚Äôll still win.
---
I heard someone's looking for /r/dbdgonewild?
---
Oh boy, what‚Äôs the next perk that is going to be complained about, Left Behind? 
---
NOED should be compared to Adrenaline not Borrowed Time.
---
-and then you open it at the last second, but get downed no where near the Exit because NOED.
---
Dont say Self Care is bad, I need my Legion stall to work. And for it to work, people need to self-care heal through sloppy butcher before I go back over and smack them again with my Frenzy. 
---
(also does sloppy butcher work with Legions ability?)
---
I don't have the information because it would most probably be hard to pull off and also most probably get you banned real quick so it would be just a waste of time to look for it.
---
KYF is ban-free tho.
---
If you‚Äôre on PC, try refreshing game cache/validate game files. Sometimes this can fix the matchmaking times
---
..... I'm not asking it to be changed or anything.... That's not what my post is for.
---
wait wot
---
Looks like every teammate I ever get when Myers is the Killers
---
Sooo could youuuuu...TELL ME
---
the counter to NOED is Adrenaline, Borrowed time is anti tunneling perk. So you need to hit the unhooker not the hooked.
---
Gotta wait for the rest of you all to git gud and catch up, the emblem changes have really separated the good from the bad at red ranks.
---
I know, I‚Äôm just saying that borrowed time shouldn‚Äôt be compared to NOED
---
I started playing Legion for BP farming. Gotta say, DC's didn't start happening until I got to rank 11. Started at rank 20.
---
Yeah, the only 100% counter is an insta down killer like LF, Billy, Myers, etc. Which kinda sucks.
---
What I personally do, is go for the grab, someone has to grab the survivor off the hook so you go for the grab. Or I hit the person going to go for the grab, then hit them again after the grab, basically trading hooks. 
---
I've had games where one survivor would have died, but they were too altruistic after the gates were open and I ended up getting a 4k (super rare for it to happen though)
---
I do both. Typically trying to grab the unhooker off, though with teams they try and "push" me or duck in front of me as I approach.
---
Stop camping hooks and it magically stops being a problem
---
It has no meaning. Survivors are entitled shits
---
What is with those time signatures?!
---
Distressing, Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili, and a perk of your choice! I‚Äôd pick Nurse‚Äôs Calling or Sloppy Butcher.
---
Objectively SWF at much higher ranks are much more successful than solo que or doing doubles.
---
Actually it does the opposite. The Best players don't rank up either because:
---
-They hate long queue times
---
-They destroy the Killers so badly that they cannot Pip
---
rip
---
Is ranked a new game mode?
---
If you don't like my content, that is totally fine, leave a comment on what I can improve or something.
---
That's the issue, isn't it worth it?
---
Imagine all 4 survivors have self-care. They each use it once. The Killer has Sloppy Butcher (fairly meta perk). That's two generators worth of progress lost.
---
&gt;but being able to take a hit can greatly prolong a chase.
---
Only one person can be chased at a time. If you know for a fact someone is being chased, you healing is the surely the last thing you should do. It makes perfect sense to stay injured to complete 1/3 of the gen, since the person being chased is buying you time, you should spend that time doing the objective.
---
Hey I told you how to remove the problem from the equation lmao
---
Aw. But when i slap them with my ability, after they are done mending, does sloppy butcher affect them afterwards? If it doesnt, i'll have to redo my build
---
You misunderstood me. I understand how powerful nurse is, i understand she can beat any team, i have played the game and have gotten to rank 1. I never said she was the worst killer, i said she was the most difficult to play, don't try to further your point by putting words in my mouth. 
---
I don't even understand how someone can lack the literary comprehension to think i said nurse is bad, i suggest you go back to school and learn basic english.
---
The reason i said she is slow is because usually new players like to m1. Nurse cannot be played as an m1 killer because she is slower than the survivor. This means new players get bullied, which also means they get angry.
---
Kinda wished I got a notification for this one so I apologize. 
---
Unless you hear the killers heart beat (besides stealth killers) I see no reason to run when you could just walk for a safer escape. If I'm a good distance away and you get unhooked and I walk back just to find a long trail of chicken scratches I'm going to follow it. Then most of the time imma find the injured person because of something they left for me to follow.
---
This may not be related, but I‚Äôm actually very happy that killer sensitivity is very high. I‚Äôm on console so I can‚Äôt really change that sensitivity so I just had to get used to it. Now, I can play on very high sensitivity on every other game I play. It‚Äôs made me much better at shooters.
---
Because they want to incentivize each side for keeping each other in the match longer. Remember the uproar when BHVR had the audacity to grade a killer's performance on their sole reason for existence, killing survivors? It made sense from their perspective, I mean why shouldn't they rush the objective, right? But it gave incentives for rushing players out of the match ASAP, which might be efficient for the killer but it's hardly ever "fun" for everyone. 
---
I don't completely agree with how they've re-worked emblems, but I agree that they should give players incentives to not try and rush their opponent out of the match, whether it's through generators or kills.
---
and now we resulted into insults instead of points, have we? so by what you are saying every survivor you encounter are salty and toxic (not as in bullying the killer but actually being a cunt) which isn't true. I had games with randoms that were awesome, good players and respectable even after being camped. The game i had with the killer this post is about, i had a teammate which sacrificed himself and got camped why the killer which this post is about, and he was very respectful since he knew what he was getting himself into but still called out the killer for camping and tunneling. I dont think survivors are entitled, what now every survivor DCs if they get injured or downed? no of course not, if that were the case what would this game even be?
---
You really dont prove any point by repeating your arguments by just repeating yourself. BTW you still didnt answer my question, but i guess that would make you look in the wrong and good lord don't let that be a thing as you are the most precious thing on this planet. Maybe even this Universe.
---
Them ol' Duke boys are at it again.
---
Well if you want to be an asshole u can use un nerving presence,ruin, distressing, and huntress lullaby/overcharge and I think the add one are discipline and calm
---
Ya it has. I haven't played since Friday though.
---
Sam Manson &lt;3
---
Billy is really strong and I think he is the second best. I would move him to A not because he's not S but because the nurse is on a whole other level
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs everybody else who is wrong
---
Camping Leatherface
---
I‚Äôd replace Presence with Overcharge
---
She gets stuck because she can't play the animation.
---
based on the perks you have i would replace surviliance or bitter murmur with deerstalker its really useful endgame
---
In my experience (Xbox)
---
Leatherface = face camp
---
Wraith = tunnel
---
Nurse = potato
---
lmfao imagine writing multiparagraphs about this while defending yourself from being a neckbeard
---
Barbeque And Chili, Hex: Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. Without a doubt this is Doctor's best build. Since Doctor's power revolve around excellent tracking, Whispers is in no way, shape, or form needed on him. The best way to play him is to go into Treatment mode to find Survivors, shock them into Teir 3 Madness, then simply chase as a regular M1 Killer. Don't bother attempting to shock Survivors in loops to prevent them from dropping pallets/vaulting, against 80% of the loops in the game it just lets the Survivor get more rounds around the loop against you. That being said the shock it extremely powerful against the insanely long loops that most killers have trouble against, like the Iron Works window and Killer Shack.
---
Only in the basement for our boy Bubba
---
It's just that it's a dumb question, "why didn't you win?" isn't really something worth asking. Sometimes players do the opposite of winning, shit happens. And sometimes the match isn't over just because there's a gate open anyway.
---
A.I. Would be needed so that the 3 identical copies to give chase...
---
The best is when they try to flashlight blind a Freddy
---
Lol what a salty little shit.
---
The face you make when the lobby has 4 P3 Claudettes
---
It's true. Counting in my head here, but auto haven has what like 15 or 16 pallet spawn locations not counting the killer shack. Not all of these are gonna spawn either. And the algorithm has reduced the number of those that spawn in the middle of the map to like 2 or 3.
---
Usually you can just hit the unhooker and down him after he unhooked and get him on the hook. If multiple people are swarming the hook it is more difficult but if that is the case at the end of the game you probably didn't do too well.
---
BT isn't really that big of a deal anymore since they nerfed it since now you can go for the unhooker. If you are playing a killer that can remove his terror radius like Pig and Wraith you can counter BT with that.
---
Really bc asking yourself "why didn't I win" is the best way to improve. Look introspectively. Learn from your mistakes and strive to do better. Did you fuck up too many blinks with Nurse? Did you get out-mindgamed as Spirit? Did you mess up ur chainsaw with Billy? Etc. 
---
A lot plays into why you lose. BT, I promise the OP and everyone trashing the perk, is not why you lose games.
---
Miss 1:  "I am just having off day"
---
Miss 3: "This never happens"
---
Miss 10 and on the phone with my mom sobbing loudly:  "Why am I failure? Tell dad I miss him."
---
ok ill take this as a win then if you don't want to continue
---
Medkit. People aren't always around to heal you for that extra hit and self-care takes a shit ton of time by itself.
---
The doctor will usually work best with most perks except perks that reduced his terror radius like monitor &amp; abuse or insidious.
---
Best perks for Doctor though that capitalise on his power is IMO;
---
Distressing - Bigger terror radius &amp; easier bp gainage, what's not to love.
---
Overcharge - His 66% chance at tier 2 madness to make the skill check appear at a random location makes this quite challenging. Also helps make him good at having a 3 gen strat.
---
Ruin - Making people mad makes hitting greats really difficult &amp; gives you time to make people go mad over the period of the match.
---
Pop goes the weasel - This combined with overcharge can cause an accumulation of 40% gen regression when they fail the skill check. Works really well on the doctor due to his increased skill check difficulty.
---
Unnerving presence - Works well with overcharge &amp; distressing. Can make skill checks even harder due to the madness effect making skill checks harder naturally.
---
Coulrophobia - Works well with Doctors larger terror radius &amp; generally slows healing. Can be very good for countering perks like We will make it if you are going back to the hook.
---
Any other meta perk that killers use works on him. 
---
Best add-ons
---
- Personally out of all the effect add-ons, my favorite series is the Order series as it creates false pallets meaning survivors can run to areas with no pallets which usually results in you winning chases faster. This combined with any range increasing add-on for his shock works well.
---
- If you want extra tracking then go with the restraint. Increases the delusions survivors have during madness 3.
---
A tip for Doctor. everytime you shock someone, they have a 2 to 3 second period where they cannot perform any actions other than running. 
---
This includes throwing pallets down &amp; vaulting. You can use this to your advantage if you time your shocks right to not vault or throw a pallet down which allows you to get a free hit on them. 
---
This is a skill that separates bad doctors from good doctors. Try to learn the timing for the shock &amp; practice it. You can effectively deny survivors a chance of escaping you with it.
---
The way the emblem system works is basically saying ‚ÄúGo out there and win, but not too fast.‚Äù Personally I hate it. Getting a 3k or escaping should automatically be a pip. I played a game as Myers yesterday that ended in about 4 minutes. Grabbed 1 off of a gen, hooked him, got to EW3 and slugged 2 more, ran back to the hook assuming the teammate was going for the rescue and was able to chase and hook both of them relatively quickly. Then found the slugs and the game was over. After absolutely dominating all I did was safety pip. 
---
The defense to this system is that it promotes the games going longer so everyone has ‚Äúfun‚Äù. Gimme a break. Both sides are trying to win. Survivors are rushing gens the same way you are rushing to get kills. This idea that everyone is supposed to play this nonchalant farming simulator is a joke to me.
---
Nah, I'm on PS4. Since they reverted to the earlier matchmaking, it's been fine during the day, but agonisingly slow during the evenings. Even for solo survivor.
---
In paint, you can enter text.
---
&gt; I see your strategy and my counter is(since I have done that) hit unhook, weapon animation, swing again for unhooker which unhooked surv blocks, BT activates, both survs bolt to exit. If there is another suvivor then they will take a hit assuming they don't have dead hard. Hence wanting to use NOED.
---
If you do it correctly the unhooked guy shouldn't be able to block the second hit for the unhooker. If you have trouble with this for some reason though (swung too late the second time or whatever) don't just blindy hit into them. Just wait a little bit and try to get the unhooker.
---
I have no idea, I just figured it was a weird way of speaking
---
lmao imagine using selfcare in 2019
---
Yeah but there's something about a *bloody* Doctor that just pushes people *just* over the edge, so they end up quiting or bombarding my profile with witty attempts at edgy insults. It's basically a salt-extract machine. And at the end of the day, that's worth all the bloodpoints in the world.
---
That was patched out months ago IIRC
---
I don‚Äôt know many pc killers closely but I guess it wouldn‚Äôt be too different. It just seems the skill standards on PC are just a bit higher.
---
What if I use iron will but I‚Äôm a bitch that urban evaded everywhere instead of running.
---
As a a proud David main, I also run No Mither.
---
Doesn't BT affect both of them? I can never tell when playing.
---
I don't think it'd be 2v8, I think 2v8 would be too one sided.
---
It'd probably have to be 2v10 or something.
---
Medkit. Useful for healing yourself and healing others. Frees up a perk slot. Useful in almost every situation, with playing against the Plague or Legion the only exceptions that spring to mind.
---
Ya usually lol. I mean that is a logical fallacy...
---
3 games in a row we only loaded with three people. Fourth game somebody disconnected after being found in the first 30 seconds of the game starting. Fifth game went fine, even though we didnt escape.
---
This game is such a gamble recently
---
No, not anymore. It used to work like that way back in the day. They have changed it a while ago and it is safe to go for the unhooker now.
---
You can at least in theory get use out of mettle of man if you‚Äôre slugged or saved tho
---
i hope that you are just a kid because you are certainly acting like it.
---
It's possible on the mobile clone of DBD that has dedicated servers.

It's sad to think some people believe this sub would be better without memes.

The entire sub would just be bitching, memes bring positivity

It‚Äôs trappers animation, Billy just does it.  He also grows to Trapper‚Äôs height.

Medkit. I run Iron Will so I won't make noise anyway but it's useful for waking up against a Freddy or doing one heal to pull off a risky save.

You can't play killer without someone in the game whining, no matter what you do they will find something to complain about

Lots of people are gonna be salty when they lose no matter what and there is nothing you can do about it. Don't forget that the guy flaming you could be a 13 year old kid. It is not worth your time to think about.
---
I always stay friendly. Say gg wp. Just never shittalk back and go into the next game if they are being idiots in the chat.
---
The results are in: legion is in fact bad in every way
---
she's so cute OuO
---
But in the game she scares me :(
---
i only camp/tunnel when the exit gates are open. one match i played recently i kept running into the same person, and he accused me of tunneling at the end of the match.

Name them plz I wanna see if I know them
---
You usually have to let them live, or at the very least not allow them to hear your heartbeat during every rescue.
---
Considering BHVR codes that, I really can't wait for us to get dedicated servers. I really wanna see the synergy between separate killer
---
honetly if u think about it 2 of any killer would be nuts imagine trapper with all tho traps or billys zooming around everywhere

I stopped watching shortly after 2nd song start up..  I would suggest keeping the montages to a theme such as vs certain killers,  loops, pallet stuns, 360s, etc...  thanks for sending a link

Easy. Turn off the in-game chat.

Okey, thanks for Feedback.

Legend has it, he's still mending to this day.
---
PS4 player here. 
---
I think most LFs and Wraiths are jerks. And if I had a dollar every time a Billy camped me and repeatedly hit me on the hook... well I‚Äôd have a good amount of cash.
---
But I‚Äôve met a lot of cool Hags and Pigs myself and I often play Amanda just to mess around and spook survivors for fun.
---
It sounds really fun tho
---
Well DBD doesn't really support surround sound so not sure if it would matter.
---
Well I understand drinking away your problems, I do. (I feel like that says enough about my age) But the difference is that when I did it in my life I just got a bad hangover and I eventually got over it. Feng has gotten blackout drunk multiple times. I just don‚Äôt see how many people can relate to that so much and her issue wasn‚Äôt a break up or a death or whatever. It was over ambition. Most people figure out they aren‚Äôt gonna be an astronaut when they grow up early on in their lives. Anyways Feng already achieved her dreams, so her drinking habits almost seem entitled to me. It‚Äôs like hearing Justin Bieber saying he‚Äôs depressed. It‚Äôs bad but I don‚Äôt have much sympathy for him.
---
Lol @ bitching about kill rushing. Run Decisive you babies.
---
well, that's not a big difference at all tbh. like, i would've understood if you were in a team with 20-15 rank survivors and a red rank killer or vice versa but rank doesn't matter at all since you can face potatoes red rank killers and have great green rank survivors (in my case that happened a lot).
---
A sub for another game I play has become entirely memeless
---
It's *terrible.* Nothing but jacking off popular players and posting a thousand iterations of the same boring gameplay clip. People think less memes will promote discussion but no, it'll just take the fun away and allow low quality content to flourish
---
chasing and hurting the other survivors will give you more points in deviousness and chaser than getting the poor hooked survivor dead.
---
I would vote Firecracker if I could use multiple
---
I don‚Äôt either, I just have a small feeling that she is entitled. I only feel like this because she achieved all of her dreams in life but she fucked it up and dealt with it with presumably one night stands and a buncha hangovers. Honestly I just used Leatherface to dramatize my point. I understand the fear of disappointment doesn‚Äôt automatically make you a hillbilly psychopath.
---
Use effectiveness add ons. She takes a long time to break survivors without them so I highly suggest using them if you can. Get close to survivors and puke on them as much as you can (like billys chainsaw) until they're broken then down them. Don't go out of your way to get corrupt purge as it usually costs you a lot of momentum and map pressure. Pick corrupt purge up only when it is convenient
---
This is what I do with her and it works well for me. Tbh she is a little weak without effectiveness add ons
---
Cute!!!!
---
This. So much this. I swear. They need to issue chat bans.
---
BHVR doesn‚Äôt like changing numbers with the game but only on killers and perks. Instead of fixing sabo meta they made Hangman‚Äôs Trick and honestly I can go on and on with examples. This is a *realistic* way of handling the problem, not the best.
---
By your logic, you can't get mad when a survivor DC's cause they went down. Since "you toxic killers down us too fast so we have to punish you by dcing"

---
And forces the ones that do have one to use their power. There's plenty of matches where you're playing Hillbilly where swiping with the hammer is better, especially right before they try vaulting something.
---
What are the chances of 2 people going as Trapper and another 2 Pig?!
---
tipical
---
And also get the other survivor taken off the hook and then that's a 4 escape. I dont care for points unless its double BP. Main reason why I secure than worry about any points I can gain in other matches.
---
I do the same and I‚Äôve definitely had those games where I feel bad for finding that person again, but sometimes it‚Äôs just I saw scratch marks and went for that which led me to you. Sorry bud, but I didn‚Äôt mean to follow yours
---
I just thought that aybe you are mixing up Borrowed Time with the new perk Mettle of Man since they both have a similar effect when triggered.
---
Okay, you made me laugh really hard there. I had to copy your joke, I'm sorry.
---
It's still useful against them, too, since it forces them to use their power to avoid the perk. There's plenty of times in matches even with those killers where a regular M1 attack would work better.
---
SS: Nurse
---
S: Hillbilly
---
A: Spirit, Huntress, Hag
---
B: Myers, Trapper, Clown
---
C: Wraith, Legion, Doctor

D: Cannibal, Pig, Plague
---
F: Freddy
---
That's pretty fair
---
Is it me or you made her thiccer in this doodle? Not complaining, just... observing.
---
Fairly certain that title belongs to Fredward Scissorfingers
---
That rich. I hadn't considered that perk. I'll have to start double checking for that too. No I've really only seen BT but thanks for reminding me about MoM.
---
Idk if you did this on purpose but you ranked all of them as #1
---
That‚Äôs Ash, not Phil Swift
---
[https://youtu.be/PtTMfjhKg8c](https://youtu.be/PtTMfjhKg8c)another link in case the one above doesn't work. Also I'm not sure I used the flairs correctly but I'm fairly confident I did.
---
With your current perks, switch bitter murmur with sloppy butcher for slower heals. As for perk recommendations I highly recommend you get bbq. It's perfect for Billy because you can hook someone and chainsaw across the map to another survivor (and gives you a fuck ton of bloodpoints). Ruin is amazing as it always is, slows the game and buys you time. Nurse's calling and spirit fury are also amazing
---
I mean, the whole point of the game for survivors is to do gens, but the point of a killer is not to dc... so the problem lies mainly within that logic (git gud rather than being toxic, or at least accept when you're outplayed) and the game mechanics that mean a killer leaving punishes survivors.
---
r/woooosh
---
I don't understand, I did not do it on purpose, but all I see is a ranking from 10 to 1
---
I rewatched those 2 episodes and totally forgot about the puppet forcing Kelly‚Äôs head into the toilet and her blowing his head off with her pistol.
---
medkit, i never run SC 'cause i feel like i'm wasting a perk slot because of that (since it takes almost a freakin' minute to heal which is kind of stupid) and Iron Will is way better.
---
When you get your friends to play D&amp;D with you but 2 of them play rogue and 2 play fighter and they all min-max their characters so your little baby boss fight stands no fucking chance against them.
---
&gt;I hear the hatch so I know he does too,
---
this isn't necessarily true. Survivor chase music is a lot louder than the killer chase music. on top of that sometimes in the moment people just aren't paying enough attention.
---
Finally Quentin isn't made fun of....
---
Ok I agree with what you said, except- 
---
I think wglf is fair because of its limited use. I feel like it‚Äôd be just as useful as mad grit.
---
Also, I actually like sole survivor, autodidact, and head on.
---
I just didn‚Äôt know what do do about boil over and solidarity except change their numbers (100 percent conversion for solidarity and 20-24 meters for boil over.) head on is easy, just give it a cooldown instead of exhaustion *or* reduce the amount of time you have to be in the locker for it to activate, so you can locker juke mid chase. Then it would be on the same
---
Level as other exhaustion perks
---
It's because reddit formatting is fucky
---
A lot of people are so rediculously good at surviving, that sometimes securing your kill is the only strategy....
---
It‚Äôs usually scary only because you just don‚Äôt expect it.
---
I made it on mobile, does that have to do anything with it
---
That may be true
---
Uh
---
Who do you think is behind Laurie? My bet is Claudette.
---
No. Most of the dlc killers are either shit or decent. The 2 best killers in the game are free as well. The only pay to win aspect I can see is that bbq is locked behind leatherface and maybe MoM being locked behind ash. MoM is new but bbq is old and never comes to the shrine
---
It's just a farm bot, ignore him and just move on to the next game if you don't want to get bloodpoints.
---
This is what's referred to as "botting". They basically left the game open and turned on a macro that clicks every once in a while. All it does is start a lobby and then stand there swinging in hopes that people run over and start farming points.

**REAL NIGGAS DISCONNECT AFTER BEING INJURED**
---
That explains it. If you want a merciless don‚Äôt use those guys.
---
She's a bit strong, yes
---
Spirit always wins chases so its not even tunneling, the chase lasts 10 seconds top against an injured survivors.
---
The way you've been presenting your arguments and opinions has certainly been a childish one, yes. Being overly condescending and aggressive doesn't necessarily scream maturity to people, I'm sorry. 
---
On the actual topic of Self Care, you seem to have this weird belief that Self Care is the sole cause of some teammates making bad plays and decisions. Spoiler alert, if they didn't have Self Care they'd still find something else to do instead of doing gens or saving people off of the hook. 
---
Self Care isn't the problem, bad teammates are.
---
Another man of culture, I see.
---
Fuck people who tunnel and camp your all trash! The last 7 games I‚Äôve played on PS4 today have been a camp fest, 6 of them the killer camped from the beginning of the game for no reason! I swear it seems like it‚Äôs getting worse with this camping bs. Wait 10-20mins for a game just to be camped from the start because your a sweaty hillbilly! Only time camping is okay is when the gens are done, sure have your 1 kill you won‚Äôt pip with sitting next to that hook but if it makes you feel better fine, or you get that toxic asshole who ran your for 2-4 gens and teabagged, flashlight blinded you at every pallet and think they are hot shit, be my guest camp them, I will come help. Tunneling if it‚Äôs that same asshole who you put on the hook in the first place for the above said!
---
I always bring bt as survivor because it seems like recently I can get use out of it multiple times in a match. Maybe it‚Äôs the messed up matchmaking putting me with less skilled killers, but I have gotten a lot of killers who just hang out around the hook even when gens are popping.
---
To balance skill and power, Billy is the top.
---
This is 100% true, i disagree with the guy who said its a waste of a slot if you dont get an M1 killer just because of this reason.
---
Huntress or bubba tbh nurse could have a decent chance but her stun sets her up perfectly for getting walloped into oblivion
---
It honestly really depends on the situation. Some survivors are really toxic, so why should they be having fun when I‚Äôm not? ‚ÄúGen rush‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist because it‚Äôs not the survivors fault the devs haven‚Äôt given them something else to do. But when they‚Äôre t-bagging, flashlight clicking, body blocking, and overall just being jerks, they don‚Äôt deserve to have fun.
---
3v2
---
They should just unhook him then if they know he hasn't activated it. It's not hard to keep track of who unhooked who
---
Are they going against Nea? What perks do they use to keep her contained?
---
dunno, but i love Boil Over, players call this perk trash but i think it's so freakin' funny to use it and the killer is just giving up and start slugging you instead of dealing with that shit.
---
This is the perfect killing
---
Get iron will for jake it helps a lot friend!
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a nurse on PS4 in ages
---
I went to the bathroom after a match and came back to this, creating a lobby, or switching to survivor didn‚Äôt stop it, only starting a match did.
---
Yea I don't do that lol. Maybe for a few seconds I check the surrounding area to see if there is a surv hiding for an immediate unhook but facecamping is boring AF. I'll admit that I will do that to a toxic surv that I have ran into over and over and know their screen name by heart. That's just me being petty and I still don't like doing it.
---
So true. I've been running Adam and Deliverance for the achievement and I've been running into nothing but wraiths and Michael's. Been getting found first which is totally unusually high.
---
The problem with this is that generators go way too fast. Why would I let the injured one get away and take a new chase when they‚Äôre probably just going to stay injured to blow through gens? This is coming from rank, where the meta is to blow through gens and heal with adrenaline. What makes more sense is to take someone out of the game as quickly as possible, given the chance.
---
Sure, username is Nexturz
---
Key! For those games where everything goes wrong and people keep dying and you find the hatch!
---
With the new pip system it‚Äôs almost impossible to get an adept with a killer, they better revert it back.
---
it‚Äôs 3/4
---
As a killer, I always chuckle when I see Boil Over appear and then proceed to walk them over to a hook before they fill half their wiggle bar. It's just hard for me to imagine someone actually refusing to pick you up just because they strafe a "little" more
---
Legion is good
---
Let me assure you that we hear you, and we're doing our best to get it all sorted out. The problem with bugs is that they are unpredictable. We can't give an estimate for when we we're going to fix something because there's no way to tell how long it'll take to find. Hopefully we'll have some more news to share soon.
---
that is fucking amazing, i wish i knew how to do it
---
If you find my behaviour overly aggressive, then how do you survive going outside without breaking down into tears? The real world is a lot more cutthroat than me honey. I made the joke of self-care users in order to provoke a debate. And it worked. 133 comments in 20 hours, including yours.
---
Calling others condescending then ending your sentence with a sarcastic "I'm sorry" is one of the ultimate forms of irony. That doesn't really scream maturity to people, sorry pal.
---
If you won't take it from me, then take it from a Fog Whisper who definitely has more experience in this game than you. https://clips.twitch.tv/AttractiveCloudyPineappleHotPokket
---
Oof, looks like I just lost my favourite build
---
Look at what SWF has done to our boi
---
Borrowed time ain‚Äôt a problem. It requires you to be in the area and doesn‚Äôt stop you from downing the person who unhooked. It anything is a problem it is mettle of man.
---
Thank you, wooba, very cool
---
I love mom. She's nice.
---
I mean I would rather have more discussion then the same handful of memes rehashed over and over again. Sometimes it's nice to go on a discussion board about a game and talk about the game. Even if people are disagreeing or arguing, I enjoy a decent back and forth between people
---
even if you do have a rank its not ranked really at all especially because u can just dc till u get red ranks if u want
---
Yeah me too. I like her cookies
---
Same here, played since 2016 release and over 1,700 hours and at this point I don‚Äôt even try to play the matches properly! Just dick around and try to have fun, wish there were more objectives to escape
---
well, i think that depends on the map tho. usually players who run BO will go in an area with a lot of obstacles
---
So are you saying the people posting these clips are intentionally doing it or are they just accidentally triggering it? How would they differentiate between accidental and on purpose?
---
tip- if you see a 4pSWF, switch to leatherface. get someone in the basement, and the game is over there.
---
Great thank you :)
---
It's just shitty and unfun and most killers can consistently 3k without it if you're good enough.
---
At least they listen to the community
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but a ton of these issues aren‚Äôt new; infinite loading screens and 3v1‚Äôs have been problems for months and it feels like you just ignored it all until the recent chapter made it worse
---
I‚Äôm trying to think positively and that they‚Äôre just taking extra time to make sure they can iron out all the bugs they can
---
Why does ash sound like a pornstar when he gets hit
---
I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt clarify what platform this is on, PC. Neither survivor or killer wait very long on here, even at rank 1. You make valid points, but I‚Äôm not talking about taking a whole new chase with the unhooked person. In the scenario where I can down them instantly again and put them back on the hook, why would I not? It‚Äôs just free pressure.
---
Explain the joke then, Mr. Burnapot.
---
I would personally rather get facecamped than tunneled.  And I disagree with the Freddy having to tunnel argument.  Put the person to sleep who's running for the unhook and then put the unhooked asleep as well,  then chase the unhooker.  I don't find tunneling very gratifying and to me it feels like a cheap down.  I want to be challenged.  Tunneling to me is watching or knowing that person just got unhooked and immediately going after that person and downing for the hook. Now if you get unhooked, and are crawling around the map for a while and you're the next one I come across I will down you.  Depending on the time from unhook I may just slug and go after someone else.  It gets very foggy regarding where you are at gen wise as well.  All gates powered and someone on hook? If I think I can down more then I already have hooked I'll commit to chasing.  If I know you're just trying to lure me away so your buddy hiding behind the tree can get the spicy save I'm not committing.  So many factors to take in to account.
---
2 killers, 8 survivors. Make it happen, Behavior. It will wash away all your sins, I promise.
---
well I thought that the rank should represent your skill in the game. The skill in this game is doing the objective which is escaping/surviving. I agree that they should perhaps rework the game to last longer but the survivor rank should represent your ability of surviving, not the ability of having fun in the game. I just want to win the games for which in any other game you tank up.
---
No offense taken, I just meant it seems like it‚Äôs been really quiet as far news from the game makers regarding issues. The dev streams were always really cool
---
oh god i wish that were me
---
Ran into 2 of these in last few days.  Super weak games.
---
**WAH intensifies**
---
I really wish they would let go of this "road map" and focus on the game they already have.
---
Fix Freddy, fix Legion, fix hitboxes.
---
Give us meaningful rank. This new change has made it so you cannot play any fun builds. Its meta perks and hardcore mode if you want to even safety pip. 
---
And please for the love of entity penalize DCers!
---
I'm not gonna do it in any particular order unless you want me to, in which case I'll gladly rank it
---
**Poised**
---
I fucking love Poised. 10 seconds of no scratch marks is so good. In a chase when a gen pops? Really helps lose the killer. Playing against someone who likes to go to popped gens? Easy to get away. Someone hooked? Finish a gen and it makes it easier to get there unnoticed. Fucking great against Spirit. Bitter Murmer can counter is but that perk is weirdly underused.
---
Fucking love Poised. Baffled that it's not more popular.
---
**Bond**
---
Fucking love Bond. You seriously gather a lot of info as you work about the map. And it helps you know where it's best to run in a chase. I always feel a little lost without it. It has so much utility.
---
Same !
---
Doctor matches last too long and he sucks so he isnt the best for getting bloodpoints. Its better to play someone good like spirit or billy to guarentee 4 stacks and the match wont last as long.
---
No, I didn't. But I just use the big things all at once lol the only ones i waste are the small 25% offerings and the choosing the map offerings
---
Tokyo Ghoul Season 2 Episode 12 intensified
---
I think they were replying to the dev
---
Which is typically the scenario I‚Äôm in. But sometimes a survivor will take me through the main building of ironworks of misery, or through the main building of springwood, both places where I will not catch the survivor I‚Äôm chasing in a short enough time to make it worth the chase. It‚Äôs better to go back to the hook considering 2/4 survivors will be in that area.
---
Where the fuck is Slippery Meat?
---
Lol the point of it is for it be garbage bc that‚Äôs what the community is
---
I'm just going to go down the list...
---
Trapper: Always camps the hook
---
Wraith: Thinks people can't see him when he's invisible
---
Hillbilly: NEVER uses his basic attack to hit someone
---
Nurse: Either you're a Nurse god or a noob
---
Hag: Always run Ruin or Devour Hope
---
Doctor: shock...shock...shock...shock
---
Myers: Tombstone?
---
Huntress: loop for days
---
Leatherface: Basement camp
---
Freddy: pretty sure he has NOED
---
Pig: Tunnels the survivor with a bear trap
---
Clown: "Why is this fat guy sooo fast"
---
Spirit: DO NOT TOUCH THAT HEX TOTEM
---
Legion:.....Just return to home screen
---
Plauge: Pukes everywhere
---
No Pig actually. But nice try.
---
I wish we could close the hatch then it would have a 14 second timer to open it. Keys would take less time depending on color, making green keys useful.
---
it happens with low rank team members yea and i didnt get to screenshot it but it happened .
---
\+ i understand what u mean but the big problem when u get rank 10+ teammates and u face a nurse at rank 2 this is too much i have faced that guy 2 times 1 with rank10+ teammates the other one with 2 rank10 and 1 rank11 and it's hard .
---
what i mean by the post we dont want to get bad match making out of the the amazing update they did by killing survivor for the killer joy at least red ranks plays with red and purple players only , purple players plays with green and red only and so on .
---
unfair for the green+ players to face not a not a pro just an experienced player .
---
I find this post refreshing, there are some good points and I play a good bit of both killer and survivor. When I‚Äôm a survivor there‚Äôs certain things I hate like body blocking, tunneling I don‚Äôt mind as much because I‚Äôm fairly crafty and I‚Äôve been shook by good survivors as a killer as well. Basically I play killer as if I was playing against myself because I feel like it‚Äôs a great measurement for how you should base playing killer. That‚Äôs my two cents! I will say my favorite hate mail is when I play a low level killer and get fried for being trash when I have 1 perk set, and all I want to do is see if I would like the killer!

It used to be a thing a long time ago, where the killer could close the hatch if they found it first. No idea why the removed it.

I‚Äôm fine with the new update, just means all the swf are in the reds whilst I‚Äôm in the purples, but yeah it‚Äôs very hard ranking up solo survivor can‚Äôt get past 8.
---
Closing the hatch was actually tested in a PTB at one point. The issue is that once the hatch is close, the survivor has zero chance to win. In order to power a generator solo, it'll take 80 seconds. In that time the killer can easily patrol all of the remaining generators. As soon as they hear the generator, they know the survivor is close and then it's more or less game over. That leaves the survivor sitting around waiting for an opportunity that will likely never come, wasting everyone's time.
---
Instead of being a hatch stand-off, it's a generator stand-off. It doesn't fix the problem, it only moves it.
---
Nah the Stare sounds better.
---
TBH alot of people play both sides.  It's not a survivor or killer issue,  it's a people issue.
---
I lil bit, but rounder shapes tend to be cuter so I went with that ;w;
---
If you dare mention this in the post game chat, be prepared for an earful of "I don't play this game for your fun!"
---
ty so much &gt;w&lt;
---
Oftentimes, I do, especially if the survivor is actually running around, emoting, etc. This one has just stood there, every now and again teabagging or nodding. At this point I really just want to know how long they'll stand there!

I made a list of ALL perks and Poised was pretty high, but it wasn't as high as it could have been if you were able to see it's effects for yourself.
---
&gt;Bond
---
Fun perk to use, there were a lot of perks competing for a spot in the list, Bond was one of the contenders
---
&gt;I'm not gonna do it in any particular order unless you want me to, in which case I'll gladly rank it
---
It's only 2 perks, so ranking them won't do much, I could use a ranked top 10 though
---
Weird flex but okay
---
AYAWAAAAH ;  A  ;
---
ty yorick ;v;
---
Why not power the generators when the hatch closes? Or heck, even power generators AND open gates? That at least removes the psychological block.
---
Survivors can bully all of the Killers except for Nurse
---
Developers cancel the Freddy rework for making a Legion rework first ? Because that's what I hear from Steam. It is true ?
---
Leader makes such a good "that's bullshit!" icon
---
Thank you for sharing, so cute\~
---
Equip Lightweight, it makes a lot more of a difference than people think.
---
If theres no dc sound its a crash
---
Sounds like Overwatch
---
meg and claudette were the easiest to get for me.  also helped that during the start of last event no one wanted to play killer so i could basically choose what lobby to play based on what survivors were in it lol
---
This wouldn't really be possible for two main reasons:
---
1. Splitting the playerbase: If you have a second version of the game that's always online, you're going to have people split between the two versions. That's going to drive up queue times for everyone.
---
2. Making a PTB is actually quite a lot of work. There's a lot of stuff being worked on and not all of it is ready to be announced. For example, if 'SUPER SECRET KILLER' is being worked on and you make a PTB, you need to make sure every trace of 'SUPER SECRET KILLER' is removed from the build before you send it out.
---
It would be fantastic in a perfect world but unfortunately it's just not possible.
---
XD
---
How'd you do this?
---
I know Decisive was changed, I ment slugging after tunneling off the hook because that's how it works now.
---
Are you running solidarity?
---
I posted it three times, and one time it got deleted because there was a link in my description and the other time I deleted it because there was no flair?
---
I mean, posts about toxicity, NOED/DS reworks, and just general salt are unwanted and I skip right over them every time.
---
It's a bug. Get hooked again
---
The solution to hatch standoffs is simple....count hatch jumps as both escapes *and* sacrifices for the purposes of pipping and BP.
---
MY BRAND!
---
Carter as in Herman Carter? (AKA The Doctor?)
---
*Discussion*
---
Ok there's a difference. But that doesn't stop you from alternating characters. Which was my point.
---
Yeah she did, but it probably didn‚Äôt get any attention, and now she‚Äôs lying about it. Cool.
---
Hmm...i feel like the killers are usually the ones complaining about ‚Äúcrutch perks‚Äù
---
Legion is boring
---
Survivors need to stop crying so damn much. Every single match I've played today has been a fucking salt mine if i literally do anything as a killer. 
---
Last two matches put me up against instant healing, window/pallet loop fest survivors who shine flashlights in my eyes non stop, but god forbid i hook one of them and don't just act stupid and walk away to let them get a 100% on me because the fucking doors were open, and all their team mates were swarming the hook trying to bait me away. "Wahhhhh you camper!!" Go cry to the devs about it! Oh wait! They said it was perfectly fine. So you're shit out of luck. Real weird how if i camp the hook, im an asshole, but if they camp it's perfectly fine...
---
Seriously these whiny survivors are like those kids on the playground who'd lose their shit if they were found during Hide and Seek or got tagged during Tag, and would screech about how its not fair because [insert bullshit "rules" they just made up on the spot]. 
---
You got hit, you got hooked, and if i choose to sit there and watch you die while allowing the rest of your team to escape, then get comfy on that hook sunshine! That's part of the game. Don't like it then fuck off back to Fortnight.
---
Same its been a pain in the ass though jst trying to gain one pip .
---
escape cake = get hooked first from my experience.
---
Did five matches on PS4 today, first one Legion downs someone basement hooks them and camps but they have kindered lvl3 and we saw them, Legion DCed after no one went down there, second one I use BPS, instantly disconnected from host, third wraith who slugs everyone all match them basement hooks me all the sudden, next the same wraith, slugs everyone then basement hooks Ash(pretty sure they were hooking the best loopers) we get him out Dwight gets basement hooked and dead, next match another Wraith who camps everyone all match but ends up with a 1k on me. 
---
‚ÄúPretty good day so far‚Äù
---
I think that if you compare it to cs go for example then you can see that they use the kind of system that I was taking about - if you win as a team then you all should rank up and play against better killers to have more balanced games. Once you play solo then you might find out that you don't belong to that rank when alone and you are going to start deranking to get more balanced solo matches but I still believe that the game should rate you by how good you are at completing the objective during the given match. I think that right now the game is ready to get a new objective because right now all you have to do to win is to repair 5 gens and open one gate. I'd like them to give me something more to do in the game which has purpose (unlike clensing dulls which have none). Something like ruin every match but they would of course need to balance it for the survivors as well. This would add more points to farm in the pool for both sides and could make the games longer and more fun. Also it could very easily ruin (xd) the whole experience, still I don't see how they could fuck it up much more then what it looks like right now.
---
Thank you for responding. I understand. 
---
Looking forward to whats to come.
---
I usually level a killer to 15 before I even play them. It‚Äôs hard to accurately judge if you like a killer when they have 1 perk.
---
Yes, considering they keep releasing new survivors and kilers with their own perks, they really should have been doing something to fix the ever-growing grind.
---
How does the survivor know when a flashlight blinds them (when not carrying a person)
---
They're probably still on the "gathering data from the community" part of the process.
---
I‚Äôve seen a return of double pallet jungle gyms too. Something got changed.
---
No mither or no balls, that‚Äôs what my friends always say
---
The problem isn't that he needs to be changed, the problem is he needs to have never been created
---
&gt; then that's a 4 escape
---
so‚Ä¶ ?
---
How can she dash!?
---
Lmao rlly? Bc he didn‚Äôt know the perks? People overuse that way too much and ur contributing to the problem my friend. Be nice bc I sure ain‚Äôt
---
On purpose would be them doing it constantly. It happening once and then never again would be considered an accident.

There should've been a rarer version where you had two charges.
---
Cake: Your chances of failing to load in *moderately* increase. 
---
BPS: Your chances of failing to load in *significantly* increase.
---
Cant forget about left behind
---
I guess I've seen so many survivors (I split my time between both) that heal by the hook or try to dismantle it that 7/10 times I find a survivor there. If not I head to the closest gen and resume that loop
---
I get found first when I run WGLF, maybe if I put both on I‚Äôll be found double first
---
This is why I hate TOXIC survivors like you who bring in insanely powerful items. You sire are a disgrace!!!1111!!!!!
---
Oh! Ha, so that's what that means. I just thought that was like, the "focus time" or something where you had to aim the light for a certain amount of time to focus the beam.
---
Thanks!
---
You can do the same thing to nurse if you catch her while she‚Äôs charging up a blink. It only makes her go into the recovery animation, but it‚Äôs sometimes worth trying if she‚Äôs just tunneling one survivor.
---
Well it is but it only zeros to a certain point and then spreads out and zeros back in really quickly which is a clear indication the blind was successful
---
Yeah I‚Äôve run into a similar bug as well where I can heal and others can‚Äôt heal me. It‚Äôs odd I never ran into many bugs before but for some reason the last couple days I‚Äôve hit all. Got stuck in crouch, got stuck in a tree, couldn‚Äôt heal people, people couldn‚Äôt heal me and had another match where I was gigantic and everything on my screen was frigged up.
---
&gt; It's only 2 perks, so ranking them won't do much, I could use a ranked top 10 though
---
yeah maybe you didn't see my edit but I'm working on getting 10 in, I hit save on accident before I finished and I'm doing it in-between stuff at work
---
So I'd rather have 3 escape than 4 if I get the chance.
---
CMV: If you make a policy of always DCing against anything that isn't outright cheating (i.e awful lag or hacks), you shouldn't play in the first place because you're hurting the experience for others.
---
Ok
---
My friends and me get on do the same exact thing, then we get off. It's about 1-2 games max then we get off, we just cant anymore.
---
But unbreakable is good with no mither?
---
Maybe run technician
---
They removed the vault speed from Spine Chill? RIP the insta-vault meme build, gone too soon.
---
It‚Äôs okay, sorry here too
---
I aspire to be that good. I suck at gatekeeping regardless of who i play as haha
---
&gt; In my experience, people are generally too quick to rescue me from the hook
---
i wish i could upvote this more than once. if i'm on the hook the first time, i can wait. get some generators done. especially if the killer is nearby.
---
They're actually not that fast at all. They're much slower than Spirit
---
still more useful than the third seal
---
That's way too OPPPPP. Pls nerf green keys :(
---
Memes should be only on r/coldwindfarm Imo, I like some of the memes here but a lot of them are bad reposts or img flip impact font memes with bad watermarks that look like they were made in 5 minutes
---
Not the killers fault that dude had shit luck. Better luck next game.
---
Deadass, Vigil is good for a speed build. I like running it with Sprint Burst/Lithe to help exhastion. But tbh, it deserves a buff
---
are we not allowed to mess around and have fun? as the other person said.. we weren't doing gens at the time. we were just having fun trying to get the perk to work.
---
4 hits.
---
Awesome!  How did you see this post?
---
solo is not fun at all. op is just a salty killer main, nothing to see here
---
Survivor main here. When killers hook people and the gates are open it makes perfect sense to guard the hook, maybe not facecamp but atleast stick close. While it may be annoying for us survivors it makes sense.
---
In that case "camping/patrolling" is the optimal play. You're being smart
---
It's very rare that camping is an effective strategy against decent survivors as it's an immediate and long term loss of map pressure.
---
I don't specifically target players during a match so I would say I don't tunnel.
---
The issue with tunnelling is that everyone seems to have their own definition. It's often thrown out as an accusation when the reality is poor decisions or bad luck results in a player being hooked again quickly after an unhook.
---
Some players seem to think killers have to apply a 'cool down' after an unhook occurs and not hook again for a couple of minutes or not hook the same player twice in a row.
---
Can't see this debate ever going away
---
Yeah fair point, if the game's bugging out I think it's ok to quit.
---
Can conform. I use this shitty perk to win all my games
---
lol i wasn't talking about small game. small game is good. I'm talking about self care urban spine chill
---
Hey that spooky title one is mine :D
---
Annnnnd this is why everyone plays Billy or Nurse. M1 killers get shit on by good survivors.
---
You forgot to add 85% chance to get face camped and smacked repeatedly on 2nd hook.
---
You know, that's actually a great point, I hadn't thought of that angle. I still think there must be a better way, but you're definitely right.
---
I kinda want a plush of this.
---
Regardless of how many hits, he's literally right on your rear end the entire time because of his speed. It's ridiculous.
---
They have no option to transfer which is a crime in my opinion. If they just had a logim system or a cloud save that would be great. I'd love to get dbd on thr switch when it comes out but I really dont want to start over especially withkut all my paid dlc.
---
No
---
What‚Äôs DRM? Still sounds cool though
---
His weakness is he has to hit you about a thousand times to down one person, and his map pressure sucks, in a 1vs1 he wins,
---
New nuffs what are they? Im good with freddy now i can only imagine a buff
---
And while he‚Äôs chasing you around trying to hit you multiple times your teammates pop 3 gens and the game is over. He‚Äôs not good.
---
There‚Äôs no brightness setting sadly, I suppose it‚Äôs to stop killers cheating by whacking up the brightness to make it easier to see.
---
because survivors have more crutch perks than killers.  Everyone just complains about NOED while survivors have crap like Adrenaline, Old DS(thank god it got changed), and MoM.  no matter if I play Survivor or killer everyone is using Adrenaline and half the people are running MoM.  And I'm not even including stuff like insta full heal medkits
---
The duration of his sprinting boost/frenzy needs a nerf. 6 seconds is too long. Maybe try 3 seconds.
---
"That his power barely hurts survivors?"
---
What do you mean by barely? A few hits and you're down, no?
---
Nah presence is important. Replace huntress lullaby with overcharge.
---
They do, I was chat banned a few weeks ago.
---
Okay I‚Äôm calling troll. It‚Äôs a few hits that causes a stun every time a hit after the first one lands. That‚Äôs crazy.
---
Perfect opprotunity to take a screenshot and make it a background
---
There‚Äôs a nea on the loose
---
Did you know that if you legion hits you with the first tweak frenzy at a window and you vault it legion is incapable of catching up? And you think it‚Äôs too long lmfao
---
I really like technician. It allows you to get a really agressive gen early on with only little worry about getting interrupted. I just wish it completely removed the sound of the gen  and removed the failure no sound perk part of it.
---
Cute chat AYAYA
---
It's a real Russian lullaby meant to scare children about not sleeping or something. It's actually real &amp; quite creepy.

Something about "If you sleep on the edge of your bed, the wolf will come &amp; take you into the forest"

---
Nea- Always blind Survivors, tends to bring ebony moris
---
Not true. If a Legion player wanted to down 1 survivor at a time, they could EASILY. Too easily because of his questionable speed.
---
MoM gives killer wall hacks 
---
Adrenaline is super situational and only good it you last to the end plus you need to be healed or zoom hella fast for some reason
---
Of course you don‚Äôt see the issue with NOED but you see the issue with DS. That‚Äôs hilarious.
---
What killer
---
I hope so...
---
[deleted]
---
Even the knife is crying.
---
They should bring them back but instead of darkening the map it just changes to one of the other maps lighting. 
---
I had a game bug out and give us the warm oranges from the cornfields on autohaven. Make that bug a feature.
---
I straight up can‚Äôt play on some maps it‚Äôs way to dark.
---
Makes sense. Nurse has the highest skill ceiling, but also the lowest skill floor
---
Legion's incredibly fast, too fast, while in feral frenzy. Comparing it to Spirit doesn't negate this. 6 seconds is long enough for a guaranteed down of at least 1 survivor. I'll look up the person you recommended. No streams from last for EdgarAlanBro on neither youtube nor twitch.
---
Dream to see shirtless daddy soon
---
then the games not for you
---
Dont worry. He will touch you.
---
Flashlight of over used joke. But a wonderful opportunity to make a new meme format. Shed some light on topics... I'll see myself out.
---
I save them for 2x BP
---
I don‚Äôt use it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I tried it and it didn‚Äôt help me enough times to warrant using it over UE
---
Or you suck it up and you move on with your life.
---
Agree that the main aim is to keep survivors off gens and too much time around the hook is dangerous. However I have a slightly different strategy. I treat hooked survivors like gens. They become part of my regular patrol. After hooking I will check for scratch marks or other signs of nearby survivors then go back to patrol. However I now include the hook on my path.
---
This way I tend to pick up both survivors who are on gens and those who are in transit moving toward the hook for a rescue.
---
If I get lucky and someone does an unsafe unhook I try and injure the healthy survivor first because hopefully, even if I lose them they have to spend time healing.
---
It's not perfect and there are always exceptions but it seems to work reasonably well.
---
Man get lost with your "troll" nonsense.
---
Lmao. We thought that NOED was getting fixed along with DS but then it was ‚Äúoh no, it‚Äôs in a good spot‚Äù I love how as soon as you guys get a good perk killed you move slowly on to another or a few other perks that you want dead. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised though.
---
What if another survivor has that perk too?
---
People are downvoting you because they hate the truth. Back when it didn't matter if you were Claudette you could stealth most places.
---
How many scenarios would that apply in this game where there are very few windows on each map, and where there are windows they few and far in between?
---
Yeah, tbh I don‚Äôt care, just kinda proves that some survivors want wins to come easy
---
MoM's only downside being "wallhacks" is a joke since you need to heal to even trigger it. I have literally never seen that effect appear in any of my games or any streams. MoM also tends to proc later in the game and just snowballs with crap like adrenaline. The fact that MoM doesn't use exhaustion or mend is beyond retarded.
---
As for Adrenaline the perk shouldn't proc while somebody is hooked since perks to prevent being damaged on unhook already exist(Borrowed time) and it shouldn't wake people up from freddy(no fucking clue why it even does that when it doesn't help from ANY other killer abilities)
---
as for the whole NOED DS thing they are both problems but DS was used in literally every single match while NOED tends to be less popular at red ranks and more of a low rank perk. The fact that you have failed to list a single perk other than NOED just proved me correct.
---
ps: I find it funny how the community is so quick to hate insta downs but not insta heals. They are both a problem and you need to learn "picking sides" doesn't fix shit
---
It's pretty worthless tbh. If you like the bloody cosmetics then I guess do it but even then I personally think there are a lot of better cosmetics in the store
---
I think a lot of people still like the aesthetic
---
That's actually a pretty smart idea
---
What show is this ?
---
True, but it was still aids
---
lol you do not give a fuck about facts
---
Glitch I'm pretty sure
---
Few windows and far between?
---
fucking christ
---
Yeah i forgot the hidden rule is to escort them safely to a hatch or a gen and let them live peacefully
---
I mean if you are going to level her up don‚Äôt use shards but if you don‚Äôt plan on leveling her up use the shards
---
The infinite medkit you talk about is a perk named Self-Care, most survivors use it as it‚Äôs meta and quite useful. The game is only full of high ranked survivors because the devs really fucked matchmaking. Stick to the game and it‚Äôll get better :)
---
Now reality can be whatever I want it to be
---
Probably a bug. Never happened to me. As far as I know chainsaws and shit like that still trigger MoM however the survivor has to be injured first
---
I was reading the backwards and up until no mither I was like ‚ÄòMmn yes pretty good BUILD so far‚Äô
---
Because there is essentially no people at red rank survivor
---
Never once in my history of competitive gaming have I given a shit if the other team is having fun lol we‚Äôre not playing tag on a playground.
---
How do you get 887 points? Even if you suicide on first hook you'd surely get more?!
---
At least thats what the description says, it needs to be tested by someone.
---
Don't be the dumbass piece of dog shit survivor who goes straight to the hook for a super unsafe save, then cry and moan like a cunt that the killer tunneled/camped when it's your fault, crybabies.
---
Lots of bugs lately. The wiggle one, invisible skill checks, inability to heal... Also now when Killers DC, it's not enough to get a safety pip for survivors. 
---
Also so many hook suicides lately.
---
N O I C E 
---
(Thanks for the info!)
---
Ok.
---
You never know, might have had some bugs on his/her side.
---
Team Balancing
---
- There was a recent change with the ranking system in dbd that made it difficult for survivors to rank-up. This has led to many survivors that have had 100's of hours playing dbd being placed in lower ranked lobbies.
---
- For your rank it could potentially be that people are smurfing to avoid this current rank issue. Many rank 1 players have a hard time finding lobbies to the point where they deliberately derank or make smurf accounts to play with new players. 
---
- It's very likely that you saw many of these smurfing dbd players because it was the free weekend. This will go away soon as these guys rank up &amp; eventually return to higher ranking lobbies like rank 10 &amp; above.
---
- There has been an issue plauging dbd with generators in that they get completed too fast. This has been a long standing issue that many killer mains have had to deal with. Any little mistake they make or if they play inefficient can lead to them suffering drastically in the long run. 
---
- I even occasionally struggle with this despite having 200+ hours in this game, most of which as killer. 
---
- Keep playing the game &amp; watch people like tru3ta1ent who are very highly skilled at playing this game. You can learn alot from watching them. 
---
- Dont feel bad about the gens being done to fast. This game for killer is all about applying constant pressure to survivors to force them off of gens. Just work on your chasing + mind-game ability &amp; try to end chases faster then you will have much better results.
---
Items
---
- Med-kits are not that strong. You should go onto KYF mode &amp; check out all the items available for survivors. You can also view all the add-ons &amp; perks available for both survivor &amp; killer.
---
- Med-kits allow you to heal your team mates faster &amp; heal yourself at 100% healing rate. Base healing speed is 16 seconds.
---
- All med-kits run out. The brown medkit which is commonly seen holds 16 charges. 
---
- Since healing takes 16 seconds &amp; you consume a charge per second, the brown med-kit can allow a survivor to fully heal once with it. 
---
- Using perks like sloppy butcher causes survivors to heal 20% slower. This allows you to drain their medkits faster &amp; make them spend more time healing. 
---
- Self-care is a perk that allows survivors to heal themselves without using a medkit. It takes 50% longer though., 
---
- Survivors that heal are good as it means that they are not doing gens which allows you to apply pressure on to the other survivors.
---
- Beware of flashlights. They can be used to blind you. If you are picking a survivor up then look to a wall or look the opposite direction from where you were originally facing. 
---
- A survivor can blind you during the pick-up animation which forces you to drop the survivor, allowing the downed survivor to escape in the injured state.
---
- Toolboxes can allow survivors to complete gens faster. The base toolboxes are not that strong but high-level toolboxes can shave 30 to 40 seconds over time when using it to complete multiple gens.
---
- Keys are dangerous. When you kill a certain number of survivors &amp; a specific number of gens are completed, a hatch will spawn which can be opened to allow survivors to escape without powering exit gates. The key can open the hatch prematurely which can allow for multiple survivors to escape before reaching the end-game.
---
- Maps are pretty useless &amp; you shouldnt have to worry about them. 
---
Generators
---
- Its an issue that the devs havent really adressed over the years.
---
- The best thing is to either try &amp; get a good slow down perk like Hex: Ruin or pop goes the weasel from buying a killer using shards or buying the perk if it appears on the shrine. 
---
- Or learn to chase more efficiently so you can apply more pressure on survivors. Keep playing killer &amp; constantly try &amp; improve on your tracking &amp; chasing efficiency. I watched many videos of tru3 &amp; damnohtml playing to learn how to become better at killer.
---
ah yes, of course. The Bing bing bing bing bong bong bong bong song.
---
Also I want to rank up so I can avoid the survivors who crouch everywhere in fear.
---
God dammit. Why is this so funny.
---
The thing with 4man SWFs is that you have to exploit the fact that they're overly altruistic, especially at middle ranks.
---
lol that's cute, thinking anybody runs self care after they completely gutted it. literal waste of a perk slot.
---
I think the community should hate insta downs, insta heals, and especially Moris. Those just promote tunneling and are just shitty to play against anyway.
---
Also I think that if you wanted another example you should say that before leaping to conclusions like I know a lot of you like to. There‚Äôs a lot of shit on killer‚Äôs side that snowballs and I think that blaming snowballing on adrenaline is stupid. If the survivors finished all 5 gens without any resistance, or with minimal resistance, than the problem is not adrenaline, but the killer themselves.
---
This team might stand a chance against Nea. Might.
---
I do gens with ruin till I miss one, I cannot bear the shame and must redeem myself.
---
I got the joke and I appreciated it
---
I found him almost right away. For the rest of the match he was pretty much either down or on a hook
---
Theres definitely much fewer! Its hard to rank up as survivor these days. The last few games I got over 22k points, escaped (with multiple unhooks and long chases) and still only safety pipped... Games where I got over 30k points I barely pipped.
---
I just started playing the game and I feel the same. It just looks weird and I'm in first person I can barely make out what you're doing lol
---
Yes, it's a very strong perk.
---
I am not in the conversation but please don't disrespect ma boi wraith like that
---
Thabks
---
Meg and Claudette have, Meg used to be black and Claudette used to look like a librarian.
---
NOEDing the person teabagging in the exit gate who miscalculated the exit distance will never stop being a pleasure.
---
No he doesn't. Not with randoms. With swf, then yeah.
---
I haven't gotten it, but I had a dream about it. I fought two clowns, it was great.

Thanks for saving me from the downvote.

I had this same thing happen to me yesterday, except when I got put on the hook, I was following the killer in third person. It was actually pretty funny!
---
Yo need help
---
Best add-ons for my Bing boi please

That‚Äôs some fuck ass mindset. ‚ÄúMemes keep our heads in the sand while bugs are making players rage to the point where they go online and get angry about it‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs all good though we got memes! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Spirit has different animations as well, doesn't she?

I too am a wraith main and I can confirm

Pig

Beauty is in the eye of the beholder is a true saying, Quentin is an exception
---
I mean they do, head banging is the same thing. I honestly get killers to shake there heads at me then i do get survivors that Tbag. No one talks about it though

It would be pretty amazing.

*Anime noises intensify*
---
You can compare two of the exact same features such as movement speed but being that Legion and Spirit have two completely different powers it makes absolutely zero sense to compare their powers to one another.
---
please tell me how to get better then endisnearhere im DYING to know
---
Please stop complaining about camping and tunneling. It's getting old. If they are camping, just do gens. If they are tunneling, just do gens. You can get two or 3 gens done during one camp. No killer should abide by made up rules especially if it ruined them in the end. These camping/tunneling is just annoying now
---
What do you mean I should've said that?  It was originally stated that "killers complain more about crutch perks" and I proceeded to list more crutch perks for survivors than killers.
---
"all 5 gens without resistance" isn't why adrenaline is an issue the issue with adrenaline and the fact that you can't tell why it is an issue just means arguing with you is pointless.  I suggest you work on ranking up and playing both sides more evenly instead of being heavily biased and ignorant.
---
Camping: I don't like camping and, as many people don't seem to get, it's totally against the concept of the game. Yeah, throwing this out here, the only way the game "should" be played is the way the ranking system tells you to. So I don't camp, because I need people to unhook (and map pressure of course). If I see people looping me around the hook it really pisses me off because they normally expect me to break a pallet so they get a free save and I lose my pressure, but being around the hook is also detrimental because I need to hook that person more than 1 time. Even at rank 1 I won't camp, nor slug, to secure kills, as my objective is to fulfill what the entity expects of me, not my own selfish desire to 4k and get a black pip.
---
 
---
Tunnelling: I don't tunnel unless it's the "obvious" thing to do, but not because it's "unfun", which totally is. When they get unhooked 1st time, I just go for the survivor that runs towards the most unsafe location. None of them is dead on hook so for me is just time losing going for the one that knows the good map locations. Sometimes I'd even just find 1 of the 2 survivors and it happens to be the one that got saved so bad luck for him, I'm not wasting time trying to find another one. Also, it's on part your teammates fault if I end up tunnelling you. If they really wanted to save you, and not just farm altruism points, they shouldn't go all stealthy after the unhook so I actually see them and go after them. If I see both and the saviour body blocks, I'm happy to hit him and go after him instead. I just don't do stuff purposedly to lose map pressure, which is the logical thing to do. So if the survivors are gen rushing like crazy and I know a guy is actually dead on hook AND the saviour does nothing to stop me from going after him, I'll also go for the kill as one less survivor is a lot of pressure.
---
This is so stinkin cute!!! I love it (‚óï‚Äø‚óï‚úø)
---
Pig, Trapper, and Hag can all teabag survivors.  Also head nodding and shaking as well as repeated hits on the hook is the same level of bm more or less.
---
Honestly, DBD cutesy stuff make my day
---
idk why you would ever run self care over any other perk but ok me ignorant
---
I have been having a very bad day and this helped cheer me up. Thank you.
---
Dont make fun of him ;( he is right here you just cant see him, everyone tell him how proud they are bchow far he has come ;(
---
This meme struck me as odd because that's what I see most fellow survivors doing when they run Iron Will.
---
All the wittle Killer babbys can't handle the awesome power of the might Green Key XD
---
She was my second p3 and I've played a lot of her. She's kind of my main. I think she's really fun to play.
---
Just add like 10 Kobolds to the encounter.
---
We can hear your footsteps, and we can see the grass.
---
Here I stopped playing since that moment. 1.2k hours for 2018, probably 1k in 2017 now I'm done, They need to fix the game.
---
Well there is a dif between fun and good, like how there is a dif between annoying and good (Looking at you doc). The pig def is fun to play as and against (when they dont fuckin exploit), she is rather low ranked though bc her power simply does not do enough and her crouching, while it is cool, wont help much in a chase.
---
Lmao I‚Äôve played both sides, and I‚Äôm a high enough rank to understand aspects of the game. Thanks for your concern though.
---
Yeah because having a ruin that can't be found for a minute or so is fun, the whole reason for Hex perks are risk and reward. You'll have some games where ruin is found in the first 30 seconds and games where they never find it.
---
They had it good, they had a nice new matchmaking good, the game was still dog shit broken but at least I could move 5 meters before getting smacked from the other side of the map, than they reverted the changes, and it was even worse than before.
---
You need to stop worrying about pipping so much. Just play the game. Always be doing something that gives BP. Do gens, help your team mates, escape. The focus should be on playing well and improving, ranks will come. 
---
Stop worrying about the completely pointless emblem system. Stop being results driven.
---
I dont even look at the emblem screen post game. I have no problem getting to purple/reds ranks every month. Why you guys put so much stock into an imaginary, irrevelevant number is beyond me.
---
Soooo cute! üòç
---
Nice job! 
---
As a sidenote, if Feng and Jeff were to find love in each other, I would upvote it into oblivion. :P
---
Game devs can't make a game function right.
---
I literally haven‚Äôt played since the matchmaking revert. I‚Äôm tired of lobby simulator. PC players find a game in 2 seconds, usually right when they hit ready. But console wait times are absolutely atrocious.
---
its a ranked game
---
Idk what deliverance does
---
Forgot about trapper. Hag‚Äôs head nods are undefeated as well lol
---
Ill have a good game then look at the pip screen and see that I didnt even pip. Its just an annoyance and kills the mood
---
&gt;escaping should automatically be a pip
---
This is the biggest misconception i hear from survivor players and its infuriating. This game doesnt have an ELO system. If the killer is afk and you escape, should you pip? 
---
Doing X, Y, &amp; Z shouldnt guarantee you a pip. Its not a single player game.
---
How do you do it?
---
She wasnt in the game at that time but yes, i guess she'd be stuck just like hag and nurse.
---
"DUDE HE'S RIGHT THERE"
---
Proceeds to force self out of the healing, Wraith still smacks through the Kate.
---
So you tunneled him
---
When following a survivor through the corn, Follow their scratch marks. 
---
Just stare at the ground &amp; follow their scratch marks until they stop or you hear them running. 
---
You can also run sideways through the corn to look between it rather than entering it. Can be useful for finding a survivor hiding in it.
---
it's like twins going on a doubledate
---
Seriously, how does this happen? I want it to happen to me!!! (While playing killer of course)
---
I've had it happen on PS4.  Wraith and Pig and 3 survivors. The Wraith was unable to hit or interact with generators. We all just ran around and fixed gens, we couldn't hear the heartbeat of the Wraith or get the chase music. We fixed gens and escaped and the screen just showed 3 survivors and the Pig but nothing for 4th survivor or other killer. This was before Christmas.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, but it just felt like one of *those* DC‚Äôs. Hopefully you‚Äôre right but I know a lot of people do that
---
Have 6 people go into a lobby I think then have one spectator and 1 killer and they both just start spamming the switch to killer/switch to spectator button
---
thanks I hate it
---
How can I experience this for myself?
---
No that would probably speed up the game.
---
Why? What difference does it make? The criteria is completely arbitrary. This game doesnt have an ELO system. There is no even playing field in this game. Between the radical difference in strength of killers, Mori's, SWF v Solo etc, it's all over the place. Not to mention rank reset. 
---
If your motivation for playing the game is to pip, i dont understand why you play.
---
Why do you think that?
---
*rare footage of the entity‚Äôs secret cult doing their rituals*
---
No I didn‚Äôt, when he got unhooked he accidentally ran into me when I was hooking a different guy so I downed him. For some reason they all hovered around the same area when I was right there.
---
Um and matchmaking. It literally takes 10 or more minutes to find a match on console, even at rank 12. I can‚Äôt get any higher because I can‚Äôt find matches. Pc is great right now but unfortunately us console players are suffering since the revert. Before they reverted, matchmaking was FINALLY wonderful! Now it‚Äôs shit. Again.
---
Ah. After legion bug, u found this. U the bug master XD
---
Actually you must be new or bad or do not understand statistics.
---
No.... But I feel bad for them and leave them on the ground to waste their teammates time
---
Read this then realized that‚Äôs literally my build right now on meg, feels good.
---
You finally found a way to balance killer against a SWF.
---
This video is amazing. This is definitely going to be one of the top posts in this subreddit. 
---
Thank you for sharing this gem of content.
---
Yes and no.  Just because the Killer is staying in an area doesn't mean you will be able to locate the hatch right away. It can be quite risky to charge in to an area where the Killer is, hoping the hatch is even there and then hoping if it is that you can locate it before getting hit 2x
---
I got called a camper yesterday because someone was unhooked and like 20 seconds later when I was back on that side of the map I found them healing behind a big rock. This was a guy who I‚Äôd previously revealed I had nurses calling to by finding him hiding around a corner after he lost me in a chase while he was healing. I don‚Äôt know why survivors still heal in the terror radius unless they‚Äôre *positive* they don‚Äôt have NC
---
Oh that‚Äôs NOED good sir
