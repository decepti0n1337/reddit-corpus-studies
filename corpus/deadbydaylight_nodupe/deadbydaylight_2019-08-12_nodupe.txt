Theres a difference between cosplay thats meant to be amazing, and cosplay because YOU YOURSELF want to wear the clothes of your favorite killer, even if its cheap.

Do Myers and ghostface

1. Below rank 15

2. P3 Bubba

4. Ebony Mori.

Here comes the trapper
---
It is a joke.
---
Happened to me last week with Micheal and heal dailies. It eventually corrected itself but I didn't see any bugs about it in the patch notes
---
Nope, I think the community can agree on that Myers and Amanda had a child and named him Ghostface
---
Hey... stop getting people strange ideias *starts sweating* we dont abuse hooks.... its just... a friendly interaction
---
I'll never understand people that treat others differently online than they would irl.
---
Imagine saying shit like that to another real living person you don't even know, over a videogame no less.
---
Gotta be either some dumb kids or some people with less than fruitful lives.

Don't let it get to you man, and take solace in the fact that summer vacation is almost over for all the brats.

I love the licensed killers, but they the creativity of the dev team.
---
Can‚Äôt win em all
---
Ghost
---
Imagine not saying Myers.
---
Im not too high rank, (being mostly between 10-12 for both killer and surv) and i whold heaetedly agree. There are games where i get 4ks and there are games where i get stomped. I see this with killers and survs.
---
Don't step into his traps wait do step into his traps

I'm sure thier ultimate dead line is switch release.  Mid September.

The intent isn't to gain karma.  The intent is to immortalize BoycottBorderland3 as a meme in these parts.  If I wanted to straight up karma farm I wouldn't have given credit to the creator of the video, and linked the video itself.  Stop being such a salty asshole, and assuming you know people on the internet.  Ya fuckin nerd.
---
Is that like when someone becomes a Batwoman or a Batwing, and then yell at Batman "You cant tell me what to do, im my OWN hero!"
---
It means you are The Killers obsession but that doesn't always mean the Killer is running an obsession perk sometimes it could be that someone on your team is running decisive strike. some killer obsession perks are easy to figure out such as rancor or dying light but save The Best For last or play with your food you won't know until you interact with the Killer

How did the killing your parents come up wth?

This is garbage. Lol

Sorry man I was jk. As far as I know it‚Äôs still in beta rn. I‚Äôm not entirely sure how to access it but I‚Äôve seen a few posts on it here.

Survivors who ignore Totems can't blame the killer for being bad, when they're the ones who didn't cleanse totems üòÇüòÇ
---
most likely this, the trumpet blare of disappointment
---
Excellent point lol.
---
me laughing cause I run Iron Will instead of DS

You lose all points, effort, time, 2 pips, and your dignity cause now you're a disgusting disconnector.

I'm just saying like half the time people bitch in this game about black pips its because they played in a way that actually you know...earned them a depip.
---
a buffoon muahahahahah. yes indeed
---
Lately my games sucked, I lose most of my matches and then decide to give spirit a shot and level her up just to have something new to play. Little did I expect to actually have fun with her and finally get my first 32k in this game.
---
So yes, after many hours of grinding, all the games I lost, all the flashlights I took to the face, and all the survivors teabagging at exit gates I gained the confidence I needed to keep going and have fun.

It really is, even with all the bugs I can't pull myself away from it lol

nOcE dEaD hArD
---
Drathgarden hunters are #actually murderers.
---
seeing a p3 killer at that rank is probably one of the reasons they dc'd as well, as you usually get to around rank 12-13 or so before you prestige once.
---
Just play spirit or nurse vs swf and ruin their fun.
---
Battle royal but 4 killers 20 survivors, why not everyone else is doing it
---
Only if you have a swf. Other players are blind  dumb, and stupid.
---
Myers is more unsettling when you notice him staring at you.
---
Ghosface is a great stalker, but when survivors notice him , he is kind of "forced" to begin the chase like a basic killer. 
---
Jk, Ghostface is best stalker. Teabagging = best.
---
And the dude who can never pip because it‚Äôs not a role specific game. lmao.
---
So detective tapp is the man for totems
---
Because despite the fact that it's a bad perk, it's still one of the most used perks.

Riiiight.

---
Some people just ain't got no sportsmanship. I put a gg down to one killer/the randos I was with and the killer was absolutely astounded because it "wasn't a good game, so why put gg??" Like, it's just a sign of common decency. Ain't gotta be a jerk about stuff. Sorry that happened to you, OP!

IMO experienced players who hit rank one says killer is more difficult. Anyway you are wrong. At red ranks survs escape 80% of their matches, on average. And we are talking about red ranks, not pussy-ranks. I found these stats on dbd forum, and they are posted by dbd devs, so there aren't stats more accurate than those out there.
---
That token rank 20 so that red ranks can make themselves feel good about how bad they are. Actually pathetic.
---
Spireh plz
---
Those are SNAILS you uncultured swine
---
Who told you that? Lmao
---
Not like Jane Romero levels of Thicc, but more like... Buff Myers level of thicc?
---
I can only picture a dude doing this and running up to the cosplaying Dwight saying "Hey, HEY YOU... ^(gg ez)"
---
So your rhyming traps with traps
---
Killers are already "trying" to determine who they want to kill now based on appearance and what they bring into the game. So that's not really an argument against. 
---
Again, there is no balancing a game where communication is included with solo play. Until that is addressed everything else is a complete waste of time. 
---
I don't know how long you've been playing, but most survivors tend to have the same builds with the exception of that one rare player. There really isn't much variation and zero surprise factor at this point, unless your new to the game. New Characters are simply skins, and when you do get a good perk, killers complain until it's nerfed and practically useless.
---
Specific maps tend to have specific spawn locations. There's not always a guaranteed totem spawn by God pallet in killer shack or right outside killer shack along one of the wall's but it's likely. Once you play enough you'll pick up these possible spots and it will get a bit easier! I would be pleased with a Small Game change, though.
---
I‚Äôm rank 12 (Never been to red ranks before) I was merely laughing at the fact he nailed it lol

---
Y u doin tha?
---
He can be, my team has a designated totem Hunter and she runs both perks
---
I admit I bring BBQ every game. My worst game on killer in the past weeks I only got 2 hooks on different survivors, so that's 50% more blood points in a worst case scenario. Average I will get the 100%. The tracking on it is just a really nice bonus. When I max most killers out I'll definitely take it off but right now I see no reason not to bring it. It also discourages tunneling so I'd imagine most survivors dont really care about it.
---
That's nea
---
Yeah i found stats too. And 80% is not the real number lmfao. It‚Äôs between 40 and 50 but ok.

I'd love to wait even longer to get into a game

Name something that a killer does better than wraith then, ignoring perks but keeping in mind add-ons and ability. No killer does anything much better than the wraith and fewer are as multifunctunal as him

exactly. don‚Äôt understand it

I really love all of them except for the jigsaw one, that one is a horrible cash grab that seems like bad fanfiction. Like you're trying to tell me jigsaw built a modern and sophisticated looking game and then went to a gritty aesthetic with the earlier films? I consider Hoffman's death to be the true end
---
Holy shit that‚Äôs me!
---
This. People are like "why aren't there nore strong perks?" when there are plenty of strong perks. The issue is that some strong perks are only strong in certain situations. What people really should be asking is this: why aren't there more consistently strong perks? And I have the answer to that: to help keep the game balanced.
---
Lonely killer can‚Äôt make friends to play with. :(
---
You do understand that is how opinions work. You have one, others have ones that differs. Doesn't mean anyone is wrong. It means that there is a difference in opinion. I stay at rank 1 with Pig. You do with Wraith. Most people only can with Nurse and Billy therefore facts are Billy and Nurse are top tier and it is your opinion that Wraith is. 
---
The difference between opinion and fact is the fact is held true by the majority and you are the minority not the majority.

---
Ds is pretty solid to me, I barely use mine because usually by the time the killer get to me, the time ended, DS is usually useful in places like end game and prox hooks, and OP said that this should be changed, the only place where you can rely in the perk is in those scenario, DS is fine, MoM is not and I likes your changes in it
---
you‚Äôre so mad that you had make a useless post to reddit
---
Killers will call abusing pallets and survivors will call camping/tunneling. It's what each side does.
---
He said she didn't open the gates even though the killer wasnt doing anything. She could end the game.
---
Don't forget frame rates lmao
---
I didn't catch a look at her perks, but is that really just +7%? She's flying
---
Bamboozle only works for one window at a time though. It‚Äôs great to shit down one vault abusers.
---
I'm kidding lol. That'll be broken af.
---
Look up Cock and Ball Torture
---
Nice. Would you say it's easy to learn SFM? Not even the animation, just the posing?
---
It just feels so hood when you play spirit, because you know you can actually pull something off even if its gets though, sadly we don't have these kit with other Killers. ( Ofcs Billy and Nurse)
---
I felt that.
---
Nice
---
Do I not have to buy Leatherface to get BBQ and Chili?
---
Every time I use it. I had a 2 man swf dc after I used it and spectated the entire game recording to report me for "hacking"

I was in the process of unlocking it in my Dwight's bloodweb. Like I was 1000bp short from getting it. I have it now though lol
---
Are you a killer main underneath purple ranks or something? Lol
---
Ash as well
---
Who suggested it or do you not know?
---
I use flip flop with tenacity and it‚Äôs far better than running with unbreakable. At least in my experience.

Flip-flop, while situational, was requested before.

If your on iPhone switch your location to Denmark ( some other are available but I forgot) search and download dead by daylight then when it‚Äôs done installing switch back and you should be able to use it
---
How many bloodpoints is dad worth?
---
Billy can instadown, myers can instadown nurse can remove all ability too loop, spirit in the right hands will wreck survivors
---
Oh i missed him on purpose because he was toxic. Everyone else played fair or apologised for dcing
---
It could be an homage/easter egg because her face is covered by a mask anyway?
---
Lol you must be joking
---
Brutalmoose what a legend
---
Yes! I've done that! Pretty fun if well performed
---
That doesnt mean she gets banned? There is no rule against that. The killer intentionally left the game hostage. She, however, did not.
---
It actually does make sense to put noed on an insidious LF but that‚Äôs just how my brain works.
---
Nurse can go through buildings and obstacles within seconds, Wraith can't. Think of maps like Lery's and Haddonfield, Wraith would have to climb through windows or waste time getting looped around fences, whereas Nurse can just go through the wall and end the chase immediately. As for Billy, you can still reach Point A to Point B faster than Wraith can, farm map for example.
---
You can still see him whilst invisible though, it doesn't stop you from looping.
---
"Spirit is a little BETTER at mindgames".
---
We gonna ignore the fact that billy can pre break dropped pallets faster an end chases faster? Wraiths power does not help him in chases as well as it does for plenty of other killers
---
It's not hypocrisy at all. You can do totems on ALL survivors, while grabbing survivors requires very specific builds on particular killers.  
---
  
---
As for grabbing from a locker, that's only possible if the survivor goes in it first, which the killer has no control over.  
---
And as for grabbing from a vault, it's ONLY possible if the survivor is injured, which means it doesn't help your argument in any way, since they would have used the instaheal when you injured them, and so you won't be able to grab them.  
---
It's not at all in the same ball park, doing totems is a thing survivors can do and have full control over doing it, unlike grabs, which either require specific build on specific killers, or that the survivors are blind and don't bother looking around, or that they are dumb enough to hide in a locker while having an instaheal.  
---
And even then, it's a dumb argument, since grabbing them doesn't take away the instaheal, they still have it. You think killers can do a whole game vs rank 1 SWF squads while ONLY grabbing full health survivors?
---
When you dont 99 your stalk and activate right behind a survivor
---
How many times have i said some killers are better at some things yet wraith is better than all of them overall??? at least 3 times now XDDDD
---
I'll do it to an insidious leatherface just to deny him his extra hook BP from BBQ. If I'm going to get one-hooked and camped, might as well load another game and give as much of a "fuck you" as I can on the way out.
---
i am yes
---
If you run the addon that gives you vile purge wherever a gen is complete shes great.  If you don't people will just not cleanse and gen rush the shit out ofher as shes able to do nothing but m1
---
Posing is the easy part. It's the constant crashing and bugs due to it being abandonware and stuck in beta forever. It's fun, but you do need the patience of a saint if you're gonna be using it frequently

---
Sorry, I was conflicted on whether to believe the title or description for this since they literally contradict each other. But while we‚Äôre on the topic of Wraith.
---
- He has nothing to slow the game down.
---
- He has nothing to help him in a chase.
---
- He has no map pressure.
---
- He has very little map control.
---
- He has no mind game potential.
---
- He has good stealth.
---
- And he has a decent ambush ability.
---
I ordered these from most to least important and Wraith only thrives in the less important categories. This is why Wraith is shit.
---
The end. bTw ChAnGe My MiNd.
---
Billy can waste time getting baited to charge his chainsaw on a pallet that won't be dropped XD And wraith can actually break pallets and recover faster than billy given the right add ons. Wraith is one of the best at ending chases.
---
And slightly better bloodwebs supposedly
---
:( Oh no, Pig is too short too?!
---
one survivor is occupied for 32 seconds vs 2 survivors occupied for 16 seconds, unless you have botany it's more efficient for you to work on a gen while your bud self-cares
---
I really like playing her though and will continue to play her whenever. Like you said though, if they don't cleanse it's a pain UNLESS you have the ashes add-on or whatever it is that reveals the aura of survivors that puke. Super rare add-on though so can't run it every match.

Oh right. Here comes the trapper, you better watch out for his traps. Here comes the trapper you better eat some ginger snaps. The Trapper! üëê
---
Since the DS and MOM nerf I don‚Äôt feel bad using any survivor perks now.
---
As killer I just don‚Äôt run Ruin on Nurse or Hillbilly. NOED I never run anyways cause I think it‚Äôs a low tier perk but I don‚Äôt mind using it.
---
It‚Äôs a game motherfucker, that means people want to have fun. If this is how they have fun then let them. Jesus Christ
---
Oh, yeah, makes sense.
---
Maybe not perk wise on a survivor, but I'm more likely to toss the God pallet without doing the killer shack loop because I feel bad and know just constantly chasing a looping surv isn't any fun.
---
People DC when they don't find the game fun (e.g. downed in the first few minutes/against a particular killer). It's selfish, but given the finite time people have to play games - I can see the reasoning.
---
True, true.
---
How can I see these stats ? Am I forgetting to click or hover over something on console or is this PC/PS4 only ?
---
100% agreed. Huntress was already a high-tier killer when you could stealth her, and this takes about her most viable counterplay. It doesn't even feel non-directional now; it just sounds like it's in front of me 100% of the time. It's actually worse than if she had no lullaby at all! I used to like playing against Huntress but now it's just cancer. I just end up really salty every match.
---

Thrilling Tremors trades the blood point bonus and ability to be countered by lockers/Distortion for the ability to either show you exactly what Gen the Survivors are on (With little to no warning that you're coming because most gens can't see another one to know that it got blocked off) or to just flat out block the Generators for a fourth of the time.
---
I'm All Ears is actually a great perk even if it's not Top Tier. The ability to cancel any sort of mind games the Survivors do just because they jumped a window is pretty powerful, not going to lie.
---
You need to make sure they‚Äôre not in an animation as well, otherwise the kill prompt will not show up.
---
Uh... the Killer in the video is Legion. Not Spirit or Nea.
---
Or is this a wooosh moment?
---
So then why the fuck does he HAVE to m1 survivors twice without perks? You can also bait the pallet drop with a chainsaw bait... Its not a one way street
---
I'm rank 1 and use none of these perks oops
---
Yeah never saw the haunted one but i did see pebble
---
I forget sorry
---
Yeah, this is exactly the reason this perk is one of the worst, if not the worst, perk in the game.
---
and FYI to those who don't know, the next update is Stranger Things. It's been confirmed via the Stranger Things twitter. They fucked up &amp; deleted it immediately, but still.

ü•∞ awww baby killers
---
Because Freddy is super short, it appears as though his lunge is longer than other killers, but he has the same lunge as any other 115% movement speed killer.
---
DS got nerfed because of Baby killers
---
As someone who also play both sides I dont feel like that at all. I win more than 75% of time when I play survivor and I never feel pressure, I actually play survivor to relax because Its so easy compared to the other rol in every aspect.  
---
About endgame I think its fair killers have the advantage, if they already wipe out 3 out of 4 survivors he should win, hatch is just a second chance to not kill you instantly.
---
I think there are two situations where i think its ok that a killer facecamps
---
1. When the gates are open and you want to secure a kill
---
2.If a survivor is extremely toxic (Constant t-bagging, flashlight spam clicking)
---
Perfect timing
---
Huh? What tweet??
---
You are thinking way ahead lol. I am not saying that is bad, I hope BHVR is thinking about it too.
---
Some say he's still not seen't
---
Yeah, something that BHVR seems to have trouble with is creating a natural balance instead of a forced one. Lets take the maps and the different ways they've been dealt with. BHVR is really hit or miss with the layout of the maps. Many maps have problems with vault and pallet placements. This problem would usually be dealt with by having a specific feature added just for the problem, in this case bamboozle. This didn't fix the gameplay, it just said "hey, if you want to avoid that, get this exclusive thing that you will have to grind for, while that's going on, enjoy having to put up with that shit."
---
Now BHVR seems to be realizing how to have natural balance in the game, hence the preschool rework. The actual design, the core, was changed so that now the fix is natural and you don't even remember there was anything wrong.
---
I didnt day I was quirky üòî
---
I wasn't talking specifically about MoM, but it was not broken. It effectively dealt with campers. Which there is an abundance of in this game. Yes they added Decisive Strike and then nerfed it too. You're not making an effective argument against. 
---
On the flip side, we get penalized if we don't remove two players from the hook while killers can camp all day long. At the end of the day, it's solo players who suffer the most because of SWF and the overwhelming amount of killers who can't play against them and complain about it.
---
I guess piggy is behind the box giving mike the succ
---
I only support camping if the person being camped was toxic/sweaty beyond belief
---
Uh, no. Wrong. We have no proof. They **most likely** cheated to get it. There are cases where people have this perk. I have a friend with it &amp; I know she doesn't cheat. She she doesn't have any good perks.
---
Lucky gal, I would be too
---
spending less base time is still better, this is always the most asinine argument people bring up when talking about 32 vs. 16 seconds. Other things are actively happening and the overall less time spent completing anything is much better, not to mention you can both just opt to not heal and get the gen done done before the killer zooms over there with Pop.
---
Yes
---
Wait a minute, ah hell is his left hand closed?
---
He‚Äôs clearly working on the new Halloween sequel and they are face timing him while he‚Äôs on set
---
People don't to make sure that person on hook dies, there's plenty ways around it, but it's just difficult and it makes saving too much of chore to do. Easily punishable too. If someone face camps do gens, you can probably pop at least 2 in the time it takes for the sacrifice to complete. It really doesn't bother me when someone face camps me because A: they're loosing points in multiple categories, B: the generators will still be completed if the survivors know what they're doing. Once I find out the killer camps I immediately stop attempting saves and get my points from healing others if I can find them.
---
Now let's wait for everyone to tell you why it doesn't count be X
---
1. Touch√© but it‚Äôs still an important category.
---
2. He‚Äôs only faster when he‚Äôs cloaked and can only break pallets faster when he has the right addon... and he‚Äôs cloaked.
---
3. Nurse and Spirit far surpass Wraith in this category regardless of map. And for Billy, his is still the best unless you get Lery‚Äôs or The Game. Wraith‚Äôs is decent at best.
---
4. Map control and map pressure are not the same thing. Control is ability to reach certain parts of the map. Map Pressure is ability to apply pressure across to other survivors on the map. Nurse, Hillbilly and even Trapper have this ability. Wraith does not.
---
5. This literally makes no sense.
---
6. No he doesn‚Äôt.
---
7. And that first hit is the only thing he has. Not to mention it only works if there are no pallets or windows nearby, and once survivors know it‚Äôs a Wraith they will be more observant and prepared.
---
You were inevitable.
---
Again, /r/LeaksByDaylight. I'm not going to explain a 2 minute youtube video to you.
---
Or what about the hag Mori?
---
Well i used the next gen consoles as an example because in reality they are not really that far off at all and BHVR is doing another road map that is going to carry us through to then but what if you had to swap accounts/consoles for some reason? Would we just lose all the outfits we have?
---
They'll be tied to your PlayStation plus account. I have all my cosmetics on like 4 different PS4's so if you cross your account over, you should still have them granted DbD is available on PS5
---
That perk is only obtainable via Cheat engine and add it by its id or modifying your save file. Any player that have this perk IS a cheater, this was/will never be obtainable because it's not actually coded into the game to appear in bloodwebs or give the bonus
---
They should create profiles on their site for us to link our accounts to that would transfer everything across all accounts.

I always tell them hotter peppers don't do that to you.

Bold of you to use StBfL at tier 2

Ive seen this stuff a lot but not this extreme on console.
---
How did MoM deal with Campers?
---
MoM took three hits to charge, which meant that you had it charged by your second down if you had healed prior to being hit at any point in time.
---
MoM actually *encouraged* camping because that was the only way to prevent the Survivor from getting the ability in the first place, and they couldn't DS if they never got unhooked at all.
---
Okay but who in their right mind thinks ruin is impossible to find? 
---
That shit has to have a beacon on it or something
---
If it makes you feel better all three times I've done it I was in basement and the killer was camping the staircase so it didn't matter anyways.
---
see the toxic be the toxic
---
I was a rank 10 and got matched with a rank 2, 2, 3 and 10. I got a 3k and one of the rank 2s called me a noob.

Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, Unbreakable and Sprint Burst until you unlock Dead Hard or Balanced Landing.

Adrenaline and Borrowed Time are your best perks there so run those. It is good to always have an exhaustion perk to help in chases so take Sprint Burst.

For the final perk, Spine Chill is very good. It is underrated in my opinion. If the killer looks at you, you know and can get a head start out of there, especially paired with Sprint Burst.

They'd literally only be able to get 1 gen done, it takes 80 secs for a gen to finish, and 120 for somebody to die on hook.
---
Thank you for the template, u/ZombieHuggerr &lt;3
---
Do you just fucking turn your camera on and record the screen the same way entire fucking time you play?
---
Interestingly, I had that same idea myself, though I was thinking a shorter distance of, say, 8-12 meters. Granted, I have only about 1 1/2 months of experience on this game, so I don't have a great idea of how large a radius that would be. 
---
I feel that with this change, it would be feasible to hit survivors, then cloak and stalk them until they stop, thinking that you've gone to bother someone else. Then, you decloak while they're self-caring and rattle Azarov's skull against their own before carrying them to a hook. This would, in theory, provide a partial solution to the problem of Wraith's power being almost completely useless in chases.
---
I have played console, I bought it when it first came out. The frame rate is absolute shit garbage. Almost unplayable if you ask me.
---
Why so rude
---
Bitter mumur did get buffed, it's a soild perk now

The emblem system makes it really difficult to survivors to pip if they don't save, the camper fucks everyone up

Well, I don‚Äôt personally have an opinion, but on Xbox my brother swears nurse is still a very viable killer if you put in the time and effort. According to him, she‚Äôs severely underrated just because she can‚Äôt pull off the same amount of BS she can on pc. He‚Äôs a nurse main and so I guess I‚Äôd say you just have to be willing to put in the effort to get good with her, he usually doesn‚Äôt even run any perks or addons while playing her and still has great success, though of course swf and certain maps can be a challenge for him (he hates Haddonfield with a passion lol)
---
No it‚Äôs fine

Well what does wraith have when you can see him anywhere on the map and every time he wants to smack you, you're already in a safe place?
---
I have realized if I remove the aura stat of MoM it kinda has no changes through the levels. So I can think of two options 1. Keep the aura stat as it can also alert the killer of MoM or 2. Make it is so that level 1 takes 5 hits/rescues then 2 takes for the 3 takes 3. Also I understand what you mean in DS becomes exceedingly more useful in the endgame especially if a killer is doing poorly and decides to target one survivor. Even then however teammates could take the hit for you. Also while it might get most use in the endgame for you as a guy who plays both killer and survivor. It gets used all throughout the game especially if your a runner who tries to distract the killer. Although I have a few ideas these aren‚Äôt really serious but thing I just came up with on the spot, every time someone is hooked it could reduce the timer on DS, another idea is that depending on how much time you have left the skill check could get smaller the less time you have left, my favorite idea is that is looks similar to a regular skill check except more challenging, hitting a great skill check could let you escape good skill checks could give you wiggle progress and make the killer get moved of course you could make a ‚Äúclose skillcheck zone‚Äù where it would give more wiggle then a good skillcheck would. You could also try and combine any amount of these but these were my other suggestions.

If they add a Mineshaft they BETTER fucking add Henry Warden.

Campings only really justified if you have somebody on hook and the gates are powered. Even then I dont facecamp I patrol around the area. Tunneling I'm on the fence about, I've never done it consciously but if I'm playing trapper or hag and the same person hits all my traps that feels more like their problem than mine.

MoM did not encorage camping. This is not why it was nerfed. Thanks for the laugh though. 
---
Regardless, you can still pull a survivor off the hook from a camping killer if (a) you're good enough and (b) you're team is good enough to assist. It's not a given and much harder when you're 4 solos. 
---
However, I've used MoM and can loop. So I can take a hit and get away. Rinse and repeat and the camping trip is foiled. So can many other players. It gets compounded when a SWF group is in the mix and the killer isn't good enough to handle that. Which is most of the time. It's not fair to killers either.  
---
I don't know if you're a killer main or not, but you're nitpicking without understanding that the majority of players are solo. That was posted here a few months ago from stats that BHVR had released. Those perks really helped solo players. That was the balance we needed and it failed due to the killer (again) not being able to handle SWF groups who could use it too. 
---
As it stands now, killers can either see me or know where I am when/if I; 
---
* heal
---
* my teammate gets hooked
---
* behind walls
---
* When I finish a gen
---
* When I run past crows
---
* When two of us are working on a gen
---
* When 80% of a gen is finished
---
When you factor in that BHVR just added the Ghostface Halloween mask killer who can one hit you quicker then Myers can tier 3, it's a little unfair to solo players. I understand they can't use them all. But it's enough to make it even harder to survive. Not so much for SWF. Unless you're the noob.
---
As a Meyers-when-I-feel-like-taking-a-long-break-from-getting-yoinked-by-prayer-bead-Spirit main recently, I like this at least one goddamn bit.
---
never thought i would see smt on the dbd subreddit
---
I mostly agree but I do think ash‚Äôs perk flip-flop is fine just for the memes (flip-flop, unbreakable, tenacity, and boil over/no mither is nowhere near a good build but it is fun to run) but a buff to flip-flop would definitely be welcome lol
---
I also believe survivors should get ip banned if they leave any match early.
---
Ok, we kinda arguing two stuff, let me make like this:
---
About DS: I like your idea, like DS last always for 60 secs and it have half the "skill check circle" filled, so if you get unhooked and right after that you are picked up, you'll have a big ass DS area, impossible to miss. For every second that DS is active and is couting down, this skill check reduces in size in 1.55%, in that way, the longer it get, the smaller it will be, at the last 5 secs it will be like the smallest skillcheck ever, but when the "white skillcheck" that is the DS get smaller, other behinde it will show, that will reduce in size by 1.2%, if you hit this slightly bigger skillcheck, you will progress the wiggle bar by 40/50/60%. Would kinda fix the problem and still be usefull in endgame
---
About MoM: make mom gain stacks the same rate you get from We gona live forever, after you get 4 stacks you deny any hit in the match, even if you are healthy, after that you have your aura shown to the killer while healthy if close than 20 meters untill you get hit, after that the aura reading stops. I think that would make the perk less useless
---
*"Hopefully I can finish first this time"* -Dwight Fairfield
---
just ask Sony for the code from Flower  to make wind a controllable killer
---
Instagram is leaking.
---
Right?! It‚Äôs not hard to play Non-Toxic and have a good time. Sometimes I let the last person escape while doing mad 360s at the exit gate (My mouse dpi is currently set to 9000 so it‚Äôs hectic lol). I love getting a 4K by all means but it‚Äôs nice to be nice sometimes and it still feel like a 4K
---
At this point small game is just a part of my perk set up now
---
Is this game popular with gays? Because I want no part of this game anymore if it is. I always wondered what was going on with all these dudes asking to see shirtless Myers. I have nothing against the gays but I'm not trying to catch it playing this gayme.
---
Wtf
---
holy shit, I need this
---
I just can‚Äôt think about a Nea running this perk
---
They reaaaally need to give it the toth counter :/
---
This is what pisses me off the most in this game like come on how is this a fair match up
---
Just bc you said it like that, I'm gonna say yes.
---
She has unlimited sprint burst
---
Yooooour backyard friends the backyardigaaaans
---
Blood warden is very feast or famine. Either it works and it‚Äôs amazing or it doesn‚Äôt work and it‚Äôs dogshit. Remember me was nerfed for no reason and is now pretty laughable compared to how it was. It now adds a max of 16 seconds to gate opening compared to it once adding 30 seconds..
---
Said it like what? I don't understand
---
Quality meme
---
The messages from survivors who lose 3 guys to NOED make me laugh. Like... just pop totems then? It‚Äôs a simple solution.
---
yeah, I tought the same , but maybe still better than current wraith.
---
I‚Äôll take the right button, obviously.
---
I'm just gonna upvote you because that sounds so sweet.
---
"Don't worry Phil, to me you are the most Op killer."

---
Oh, I just thought you were talking about _another_ tweet. Yeah, I saw that vid before. I just expected an accidental tweet of them announcing the chapter early or something.
---
Indeed
---
That's what I thought, but wanted to make sure. I might wait to unlock the perks before I prestige then.
---
Ah, the perfect killer
---
Thai guy is really good
---
Exactly. Played a game with a baby bill on PS4 the other day and just had to let him get hatch, screw my 4K
---
hence what I mentioned about killer using their power to effectively. basically the other 3 trap downs count for like nothing in the emblem system
---
I guarantee if they rework how Malicious and sort of the Chaser emblem works to account for chainsaws, insta downs, traps, refusing to cleanse, etc. it would be a lot better. the devout and to an extent lightbringer is fine (though lightbringer also needs a way for the killer to gain points themselves in said category)
---
Back in the day, you would start the match getting a selfie with Ghostface
---
Is the flair literal?

why are low quality posts like these allowed?

Yes they were hostages obviously
---
Don‚Äôt think you will be able to reconnect, imagine dcing just as you‚Äôre about to get downed then rejoining once the killer has gone off in another direction.
---
She‚Äôll infect everyone and the nurse has to take care of it
---
Maybe when you reconnect you lose half struggle bar, same as going to the hook, two dc and you are dead
---
Niiiiiice

Its not gonna make the game better but at least the "lagswitch" complaints will die down

Yeah, at least ping will get better in that way

Where the hell is there a nea in that whole scene. OP isnt nea.

Moris are dumb(except the cypress) and I can see where his salt comes in, but to message someone from being moried is pretty childish. I mean, I DC when a killer tries to mori me but I never send the killer a message. This guy is funny.  What rank was this person?

Even with ‚Äúpunishments‚Äù it could still be abused. Not saying for certain they won‚Äôt do it but considering the type of game dbdl is I highly doubt it.
---
he‚Äôs so adorable
---
FPS is a hardware thing based on your PC/console, has very little to do with servers. As for leaving a match they have said it's the first step in implementing such a thing because it will allow them to tell what kind of DC it is, i.e. not someone's internet cutting out but have yet to state that they will implement such a thing so who knows if it will ever happen.
---
Dance With Me and Poised.
---
I think Dance With Me gets rid of your scratch marks after a rushed action for a few seconds and Poised gets rid of them for a few seconds when a gen is done.

Do you even know what the PERK OoO does?

I literally just had this problem. Persisted for a few weeks. Went from a 6 to a 17 due to the amount of crashes. Mine would crash to desktop a few minute into a match or in the next match. It was unpredictable, but always happened.

BHVR support was really good with helping me to fix it. In the end, I had to do a complete refresh of my laptop and that fixed it.

They can make strong perks but they shouldn‚Äôt make perks as broken as MoM. If they made a perk that rewarded the killer for failing at their job, everyone would compl- oh wait that perk does exist and people do complain, it‚Äôs called NOED.
---
Sweet Tooth is the name of the icecream truck.
---
Marcus Kane is his name and he would be an awesome killer to get the rights to.

Yea, and it affect the wraith very little.  And nobody runs OoO for a reason. nobody expects stealth killer at red ranks so you see it even less there, trust me, i speak from being in red ranks with him for months.

This is perfect.
---
I always blame myself for not doing totems when I see noed. I do think the perk is a crutch a lot of the time, and would love to see a rework that makes it only become active even if it spawns after a certain number of hooks (maybe get a token every hook and at 6-8 hooks, you get it?) but survivors should cleanse totems, especially after the buff to totem cleansing points lol
---
We actually have something like that in my homestate. I don't think it's necessarily made to release anger, but I'm pretty sure that's why must people do it.

Im a masochist because i play this game

‚ÄúOh I don‚Äôt like this one killer so I‚Äôm going to go make everyone‚Äôs game worse and go back to lobby, sit in queue, and hope it‚Äôs not the same killer and repeat.‚Äù It‚Äôs a 0-stakes make believe game, just take a normal L and go, filthy turbocunts.
---
Left for Dead was an Xbox 360 game too. So it's not that uncommon for valve. Sony on the other hand ... not a chance.
---
Inb4 your favorite killer gets Ruin last.
---
Absolutley, not only do you get pop, but you also get bamboozle, which is a great perk to have on the right killers.
---
I'm rank 10, I have two friends that are rank 16 and one friend that's rank 4. We all play with each other and queue based on who ever started inviting first. Are you saying playing like this would seriously end up with us being on a killer camp list??

Bamboozle its pretty situational, it can be so usless some games and good in others, ik it blocks infinites but actually if they run to a infinite, just dont chase them
---
Take a deep breath and move on. Shitty players are going to be shitty and DBD is filled with shitty players. Sometimes the best move is to hit Y and start again.
---
I‚Äôm on neither side tbh.
---
Nah. My team mate did literally nothing and I gave at least a 5 minute chase. They coulda finished it all. But didn‚Äôt even try.
---
You didn‚Äôt see anything..
---
Yeah I know. Just so scummy. I can‚Äôt believe someone just did that.
---
It doesnt help that you were being just as toxic as the killer
---
How?
---
He's the killer, that's what they do.
---
It works on trapper 100%
---
well i know they only get the rights to the characters and not the actor, it would make sense they don't know, im just guessing they made Laurie look like she does in the movie, (since they didn't know at that point because she was the first licensed survivor) and then reused it for julie since we won't see it ingame anyways
---
i do believe whoever owns the rights to elm street  at this point were really adamant that it had to be based on the 2010 reboot, which is strange because i feel like they'd want to cash in on the more expensive and recognizable characters since the reboot definitely wasn't the most profitable but whatever
---

Never had a welcome wagon before lol quite nice I must say. 
---
Btw this wasn't a flex post it was really an angst post against people who think they have to use x,y,z perks in order to do well. 
---
Down with the meta I say.
---
The problem is though that Killers are intentionally stalling games where they can find the hatch before they kill a person to have it open so they can immediately B-line for it and deny the survivor to win.
---
The animation timer for someone dying on hook literally allows a killer to cross map in time to close hatch even if a survivor is right on top of it.
---
That along with gates being ludicrously stupid in position about 4/5 games for Killers to easily rotate back and forth has resulted in many more lost games for me as survivor.
---
Sure before end game we had problems, but almost every match I play as survivor my team mates barely run a killer for more than 5 seconds before getting downed all game and even when I try to gen rush the game is stalled enough to not finish all gens before the Killer finds hatch and downs me opening gate, then shakes their head, hits me on hook, and says ez gg you‚Äôre trash post game.
---
The spike in toxicity I‚Äôve gone up against since end game was added has forced me to take a break from this game.
---
Just wish they could find a way to not make end game so killer sided
---
I get them constantly it sucks
---
Fair enough. I don't use ruin because I play Billy, but in order to keep map pressure, BBQ is a godsend
---
Hook yourself
---
Yeah I changed that already.. struggled one time &amp; was like nope. Not breaking my space bar lmao
---
i decimated a 4-man swf team and they sent me a party invite and instead of berating me like i thought they were gonna, they just wanted to tell me how good of a killer i am and i let one of them escape through the hatch. little moments like that really tend to restore my faith in this community
---
Ruin no ed lol
---
Personally think pop is a bit overrated but its def nice on Freddy and maybe Billy.

The thompson house is an exception the the "every second story building has two ways off" rule, as the only way in and out is through the stairs.
---
I've gotten it a couple times but I didn't get my first one until I was balls-deep (I think 4 or 500 hours) into the game. Congrats bro
---
Eh...she's okay but I have noticed some weaknesses with her. First one being the obvious one that sometimes survivors don't cleanse against the plague which makes her unable to get corrupt purge and in that case renders her as just a regular m1 killer. Also, survivors can spread out in the map and make it so that the plague can't puke on multiple survivors at a time and this also allows for them to work on multiple generators at a time and take advantage of the plague's little-to-non-existing map pressure. She also has a regular 32 meter terror radius which means she isn't able to sneak up on survivors and survivors are more alert to her presence and can hide in not too much time or run away before she can get to them.
---
As for her perks, Corrupt Intervention is a pretty good perk as it does block off 3 generators and if you combine it with Discordance you can gain a lot of information as to where the survivors are and which gen they're doing because of Corrupt Intervention blocking off the 3 gens and forcing survivors to work together on gens. Works very nicely, especially on Plague since puking on gens is one of the main things to do with her if you want to get a little closer to getting the 4k.
---
Infectious Fright is honestly an amazing perk and now that it's been buffed to make it so that it works with other attacks besides m1 attacks is even more amazing. This perk can be very punishing to survivors who are in your terror radius because all you need to do is down a survivor and the other survivors around you will scream and reveal their location, and if they're injured and not in a spot with any pallets or loops of any kind around them, you can down them and begin to slug everyone and slow the game down a ton and maybe even end the game resulting in the killer winning. Not only that, but if you combine this perk with Monitor and Abuse and make your terror radius bigger by 8 meters when in a chase, you can find survivors much easier. This perk on Plague can work very good due to the fact that some survivors don't cleanse against Plague which means if a fully infected survivor is in her terror radius when she downs a survivor, she can go down that survivor and get slug potential going.
---
And finally, Dark Devotion in the right hands and in the right situation can be a reliable perk, but personally I think there are a lot of better options than this perk. However, it did get a slight buff recently as it now lasts for 30 seconds instead of 20 seconds and it also doesn't have much of a cooldown now, meaning you can have the potential to trigger it several times in a game. I wouldn't recommend using this on Plague.
---
That's why I've always offered a competitive mode where no perks or addons are allowed
---
edited post for you

Trapper's basement is a legit fun build

Completely agree with this. I‚Äôve had the game since the Clown chapter and I‚Äôve only seen BBQ maybe once or twice

Well it‚Äôs not that, it‚Äôs just that when someone spells something wrong, it seems to immediately invalidate what they were talking about, which is really stupid. I like how I‚Äôm being downvoted, because I‚Äôm actually siding with the the person who‚Äôs being downvoted. Reddit is great, but it has a somewhat mob mentality sometimes
---
This is why the Thompson house needs a balcony to jump off of, hell, even a window vault would be fine. Played the trapper a couple days ago, and got a Claudette up there and trapped it, thus fucking her. If she tried to leave, she would have been trapped, and if she noticed it, there wouldn't have been enough time to disarm it as I was up on the second floor as well.
---
They should make it like Sole Survivor. As more survivors die off, you get a boost to gen repair
---
Idk, matchmaking is kind of on drugs right now.
---
At least dont use the same card twice.
---
No problem friend. &lt;3
---
He did this for thirty minutes, just shocking them, well after the Deviousness category would have maxed out.
---
Me too lol
---
Of course it's the more optimal thing to do, but my point was because you mentioned camping being justified. Common rhetoric around this game is that tunneling, camping, and a plethora of other things are scummy, but particularly those two, and particularly because there's a very vocal survivor playerbase that loves to bitch when they get killed not on their own terms (or just killed in general).
---
There's been this massive social censure tactic and an unwritten set of rules that people try to force on killers, as if there were some set of morals or ethics manual that has to be followed.
---
Honestly I play both and I think playing Killer is easier. I feel way more pressure as a survivor than a killer. Not saying your opinion is wrong just showing a different perspective.
---
I played them.
---
They were the only one to escape, but I did hook them 2 times.
---
I believe both of them are called sweet tooth also fun fact his son picks up the mantle of sweet tooth after Marcus gets buried alive in his daughters coffin and another fun fact sweet tooth and Marcus Kane are technically two different people considering he is I believe bi-polar
---
Wasn't it his son since Marcus's daughter died and sweettooth got buried along with her in his ending?
---
There will be an allowance in the dc amount for internet drops, game crashes etc. You won't be punished for disconnecting once.
---
Ahh.. i was really hoping for something fixable, but maybe i should just keep trying to lvl up and find them. I never play as killer so i haven't seen if i got a bps there. I hope u find one soon tho in your survivor bloodweb again!
---
Should I include teachables you may not have yet? Or just ones that you will already have?
---
Yea I guess that is right, he didn‚Äôt really have a point, and I wasn‚Äôt really calling people who spell correctly pretentious, I was calling people who try and correct people‚Äôs spelling on the internet pretentious. Like the whole your/ you‚Äôre thing, it‚Äôs just pointless to correct if the writer got their point across in what they‚Äôre saying- to an extent. Like people on r/boneappletea, have some problems spelling lol
---
That is still going to happen, unfortunately. Say the killer has a lower ping to the server than you do, you're still gonna get those weird desync issues.
---
Offerings can give u that map so it‚Äôs probably that
---
r/iamverybadass
---
I thought of some ways that this game mode could work as well,
---
1. 7 gens need to be repaired, but there will be a total of 11 gens on the map
---
2.Survivors on the hook gain an extra 30 seconds 
---
3.There are 4 exit gates
---
4.The hatch will open when there are 2 survivors but will be revealed when 4 gens are done
---
5.Gen times will be increased to 90 or 100 seconds 
---
6.2 basements 
---
Idk what else to come up with
---
I hate to say it, but we're living in the COD 4/MW2 days.  The game is fun but the perk balance is broken.
---
We need a perk point system.  I.E. Pick ten, where you have 10 points to spend but S tier perks cost a lot and crap perks are cheap.
---
This allows you to do the typical meta cheese build, more balanced builds or wonky builds with several non meta perks.
---
Change my mind.
---
They certainly are. You'll notice that this community for the most part tends to gravitate to VERY extreme ends of the spectrum when rating things, pretty much without fail.
---
Thicc and batshit. I'd be 100% for it.
---
No, Peanits has stated multiple times there was an error collecting those stats. He said that rank 1 survival rate is closer to 43%. This was with old MOM and no egc
---
Yes, pop is great and high mobility killers like Billy, Nurse, and Freddy. And you can also get bamboozle too
---
Managed to win with Hillbilly on Lery's Memorial using his chainsaw like 5 times to patrol, won using his mallet mostly, had 2 disconnects and had the other 2 whine about how i played. Point is: There will always be whiny ass survivors no matter how we play.
---
Hear that?
---
False m8
---
I like Q&amp;Q over Poised
---
It looks like it's been combined with Freddy's face.
---
While I do agree with the majority of the changes, I don't think the Hatches opening with 4 gens would be a good idea. It kinda defeats the purpose of more gens needing to be repaired, doesn't it? I mean, survivors would just focus on popping 4 gens and then looking for both the Hatches.
---
However, it would be fun af to see eight survivors storming a hatch, trying to escape LOL
---
Lol I didn't see the other player until I started pointing
---
I‚Äôve seen a huntress very effectively use I‚Äôm All Ears. Was pretty awesome
---
where did you get these numbers? not flaming, just curious, it seems really high.
---
Even  more of a Dwight move ... LOL. gg
---
I'm assuming this was red rank?
---
lightborn is so much more satisfying than franklins. ik franklins is much better, but watching them using their flashlights makes me laugh when is does nothing at all!
---
Well if no one is doing gens and everyone is looking for the hatch then that‚Äôs kind of in the killers favor lol
---
Eh it's fine I get so many escape cakes BPS don't really matter good luck to you on your quest for some party streamers
---
All I can think of is the goofy laugh

Imagine how popular WGLF would be if it were an easy 100% BP bonus for all survivors + Kindred.

Why would a killer even like that? 3v1‚Äôs were incredibly boring whenever I got them before the change, there was never any worry about not killing all the survivors, where‚Äôs the fun when you basically know you‚Äôre going to win?

Although I did have some very fun matches back in the day where a survivor would dc right at the start so there‚Äôd still be 5 gens but my cousin and I would persevere and survive lol no better feeling

Balance is ‚Äúgood‚Äù in comparison, but that doesn‚Äôt mean things are good. They can definitely get better.

What that other guy said about translating. In German, the spirit is called ‚ÄòDer Geist‚Äô or ‚ÄòThe Ghost‚Äô so it‚Äôd cause translating it into other languages which also have a similar lack of a term for both ‚Äòspirit‚Äô and ‚Äòghost‚Äô
---
I used to use it when I first started but hardly ever now.

I dont really fail skill checks often and killers tend to kick a gen if they hear it running anyway.

My build with teachables you may not have yet but would be worth getting would be pop goes the weasel, hex ruin, bbq and chili, and stridor, while my build that I would recommend that doesn't include teachables you don't have yet consists of discordance, bbq and chili, rancor, and sloppy butcher.

Did you just unironically say "and maybe even buffs" for killers when facing just ONE survivor? Found the hypocritical killer main who cries about insta heals yet uses insta downs and ebonys without a problem.

Well when a whole team of survivors disconnects after they find a leigon, they had to make him more underpowered. Plus, who the hell sees blood? I never see it. I just saw it today for the first time in my life as killer.
---
*all sprint burst away by the time you get there*
---
Gonna be honest, that sounds really inaccurate. What rank are you, did you party queue, what region are you in are all important, and personal experiences don't make for statistics. Most of the survivors I play with don't run it, because it is currently shit tier. Players usually run it when they don't have any better perks or are very inexperienced. Most perks are more useful, like Bond or Adrenaline or just bringing a med kit. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you said 60% of the players I play with run self care then that would be accurate.
---
Ok i really liked to run bloodhound and sloppy butcher on legion(also blood can help you see what locker they went into, if they're walking or running, and i cant tell you how many times I've seen 1 drop of blood from a survivor i accidentally slugged and gotten the 4k fro just being a little more perceptive). and why would the survivors disconnect? (give me scenario anything will do)
---
Why is it shit now? Did i get nerfed recently?
---
I dread playing against them, I don't really run Iron Will as much so once spotted it's a gg for me

played a survivor tonight had 2 of my teammates disconnect after the early death of the first teammate. Trapper after catching me carried me the whole way to the trap door on purpose. made my whole night.
---
I'm not the only person this has happened to - I found out it happened to someone else on the DBD Discord server, same error message and everything. Now, DBD has uninstalled itself from my computer. Same happened to the other person.
---
Those 2 perks are exactly the type I feel OP is talking about. I can't think of any worse perks in the game.
---
I said don't care this is just imaginating!
---
Same thing for survivors have to run DS a exhaustion perk adrenaline and a healing perk

Sorry I dont know how to embed links on mobile but that's my full list of all recorded perks. I recorded them as killer at rank 4. Survivors were from rank 16 to 2 purple ranks using self care most but I also saw the purple ranks most. I'm on east NA servers I'm not making anything up this is just what I tallied across 25 games/100 survivors/395 perks because a few didnt have a full set of 4 perks
---
I run my Spirit with Whispers, Rancore, Noed, and Surveillance. Whispers to find survivors quickly and keep them off Gens. Rancore to know where most survivors are and guarantee at least 1 kill. Surveillance to keep people off those pesky gens after you‚Äôve kicked them and left (I‚Äôve yoinked a few survivors this way because they thought I was leaving) And Noed Incase they actually get Gens done. I‚Äôm shooting to replace Noed and Rancore with BBQ and Devoir Hope when I can. But Whispers is a strong on most Killers if you have the ears and eyes to track.
---
That's never happened to you and you know it

This comment is so true it hurts.

Haha, found the baby killer who cried until MOM got nerfed. Yes how dare each survivor have one extra hit up their sleeves.

Meanwhile, killers have instant downing moves and addons. -Crickets chirping-

I'm just kidding around.

Pig has a similar one
---
&gt;recently
---
Months ago with the Spirit update. They nerfed healing speeds and also made fast vaults harder to pull off gradually.
---
I think the change was 12 to 16 seconds on regular heals, and something like 24 to 32 on self care. 40+ seconds with sloppy butcher, which is like half a gen.
---
Effectively self care is a soft throw these days if people are running adrenaline. Gen rush is the name of the game for survivors.
---
In all honesty I think it's in killers and survivors best interest that self care remains strong, cause making it viable to self heal means people spend less time on gens. Inadvertedly they made the problem a lot worse by nerfing it, when it came to players who were actually good at the game. (Rush gens and get the 0 time heal with Adrenaline)
---
Well I had my friend play for the first time ever and he got a 4k as Hillbilly twice and as Wraith once. Obviously small sample size but I think it's inherently easier to be Killer since your whole job is run around as much as you can and, well, kill. Survivors need to evade and you're almost guaranteed to have at least one guy die every match, low ranks it seems like 75% of my matches are all 4 people dying and back when I played at higher ranks it was usually at least 2 people dying.
---
I can't change your mind if you've made it up this much. If I presented facts and data that proved you wrong, would you accept them and change your mind? I don't think so. Currently ruin holds the spot as the #2 most powerful perk in the entire game for killers behind BBQ. If that doesn't say something, I don't know what does.
---
You a real one if you use bond instead of self care
---
I love how they completely ignored your response even though everything in it is 100% correct.

---
My internet is too bad for killer.
---
Actually it doesn't matter how you play in low ranks if it's not a hard killer to play (nurse, spirit or huntress) so you can both camp or go find other people. The more you climb tho, they become more and more less altruistic and they will be doing more gens. The meta perks isn't a issue if you know how to counter them: dead hard, just get close and see if they dead hard, then remember that they have it or not; decisive strike, don't tunnel; adrenaline, protect your gens more, a chase shouldn't last more than a minute without a hit. Unbreakable, don't slug. Although camping is a very strong tactic to counter swf. Survive with friends are really strong cause they are very altruistic and coordinated on gens timing and information sharing. So capitalize on altruism and punish them if they try to make some stupid move.

As someone who is a Rank 5 survivor but only a Rank 16 killer, don‚Äôt worry about making survivors mad as a killer. If you camp, their team can do gens. If you run around and tunnel people, their team can do gens. If you keep resetting gens, their team can get them off the hook. 
---
There‚Äôs not really much to being ‚Äútoxic‚Äù as a killer imo except targeting one person the entire game. So, if you‚Äôve hooked one survivor twice and haven‚Äôt hooked any of the other survivors at all yet, don‚Äôt kill that 3rd survivor yet. 
---
With the knowledge I have of the game as a survivor, even though I don‚Äôt play killer a lot, I can usually get a 3K or 4K when I‚Äôm playing killer but I like to be nice and always let the last survivor go or at least give them a chance to open the exit gates :)
---
M&amp;K is a straight up upgrade from controllers, and would give a definite advantage for you as killer (especially Huntress)
---
I honestly hate the asylum more. There are 2 infinites here and balanced landing in that house is stupidly strong.
---
Yeah :(( we cabt reach it
---
Literally putting all killers at a disadvantage for forcing controllers. PC has freedom of choice, yet they lock in for this crap on consoles.
---
how did you manage to get Jen and geistra's perks/icons?
---
They can open the gates if the EGC hasnt started, they get deviousness points for it
---
See they pulled that bs with me that I couldn‚Äôt connect to games, so I figured out how to bypass it. Make a SWF match by yourself and ready up. I find games quicker and easier without their stupid disconnection issues.
---
It's pathetic, really. Nobody likes to be a victim of NOED but it's not worth getting mad over. It's not the end of the world if you don't survive a match. If anything as a Survivor at times I've appreciated a NOED because it makes the endgame more intense. The pressure's absolutely on when you know a single hit will knock you down and the Killer's speed is slightly faster. I like a mixture of friendlier matches and scary difficult pressure matches. I don't like going up against the Huntress because I always encounter the ones with amazing aiming skills but I just deal with it and go through the match. I wouldn't get mad as the player for choosing her.
---
I've been slated for using Franklin's Demise a few times. I like it because it's my way of dealing with flashlights but I don't slate the Survivors for using flashlights. If they want to they can as maddening as it might be for me if they're hyper altruistic with it. The points is on both sides there's stuff not to like. Survivors hate stuff like NOED and Franklin's, Killers often moan about DS and Adrenaline. I just like a challenge even if that means they'll use those things. The only thing I don't think either sides should milk are endless pallet loops and camping because I think it just takes the fun away entirely and becomes tedious. I like to chase Survivors up and down the maps and even if it takes forever and they keep disappearing I enjoy it whereas I can't say that about running around the same pallet for half an hour. The point is to escape and no longer be in the Killer's sight by making use of the wide map, not just running in circles. On the other end camping's no fun for Survivors because the hooked person literally can't even play the game at all, and they know as soon as they're off they'll be right back on and all they'll be able to do is bash their space bar. I never milk a loop and I never camp because they're the only things I consider to just be awful. There's no fun to them.
---
Well there's one thing I know for sure:
---
I'm not BHVR, and complaining to me about it won't solve anything, so
---
EGC?
---
what
---
Bodyblocking hooks and shit (which ive seen an increasing amount of neas do) or bodyblocking and locking in a killer as a swf group isnt ok tho. Bodyblockin is actually listed as an example for one of the reportable things iirc
---
End Game Collapse.  The timer bar that pops up on the top of the screen after a gate is open or the hatch is closed. You are instantly sacrificed if it reaches 0

The killer can open one exit gate if all generators are complete but no exit gates have been opened by the survivors.
---
Oh ok gotcha. But what is the benefit of opening it early?
---
Also does that mean that at the start you can just go over and smack it open immedietly?
---
How DO you open it btw?
---
From easiest to hardest SWF -&gt; Killer -&gt; Solo Survivor
---
Both roles can be hard, but when one role makes you rely on 3 teammates that can and will let you down a good bit of the time then that side is harder. With the (mostly deserved) killer buffs overe the past two years killer is definitely not as hard to play anymore, and while things like map selection can screw you over your destiny is a lot more in your own hands than a solo survivor.
---
Depending on the killer an extra hit could mean a lot, not to mention it stacked from a killer winning chases. All four survivors could and often did run this, the perk was popular in that meta for a good reason.
---
MoM had obvious problems. It was inevitably going to get nerfed.
---
When you unlock all teachables for bill, then is over. All your character can find them in the blood web at some point, but remember that if you prestige a character, that character loses all the perks but his teachable. For example, if your ash had borrowed time and unbreakable, after you prestige you'll lose them but you can still find them on the bloodweb.
---
There's really not much point to the gate imo.  In some rare situations with Blood Warden (killer perk) it could be useful, but youre usually better off just leaving it closed.  However, if you find the hatch and close it, that gives the survivors 2 minutes to open one of the gates, so youll only have to patrol those, and the survivor cant get hatch without a key.  This is very helpful.  
---
If you walk up to the gate and press space (or whatever your interact key is) it will open.  This only works when A. all the gens are done or B. Only one survivor is left, and the hatch is open (which you also close with space)
---
AAAAAAAH.
---
Well, lets use instead of lightweight, Spirit Calm then.
---
Remember you also use a perk slot for it that could have something that makes surviving easier or doing stuff faster, meaning self care turns out to be shit anyway
---
Op played against the entity :0
---
 New killer confirmed
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that, I thought it only worked when you finished the gen nvm then
---
omg
---
I don't know about the matchmaking, but I've been in lobbies with similar people. I'm a new player and I'm trying to learn killer without perks and much game experience. I always get told to kill myself, uninstall, I'm bad, trash, etc. Even after I say GG and express that I'm new, I get the GGEZ and lots of taunting. Unfortunately, I think it's just part of the game.
---
Not if you disable V-sync in the .ini file.
---
Ham!
---
Until you‚Äôre met with a situation where no one else is able to heal you and the match is about to literally be decided on if you can take one hit or two.
---
It activates when any gen gets completed, and you leave no scratch marks for 10 seconds at tier 3.

Plague needs a jiangshi skin
---
Camping can work if you get run up to a hook and the survivor is about to go into struggle. Just standing that extra 10 seconds near the hook makes sure they are one hook down. 
---
Also, tunneling helps when you have one really good survivor trying to be the chaser and you can take one person out of the match early. Usually the chaser will not be on a gen and will try to distract you.
---
Both tunneling and camping can be used as valid strategies.
---
Me know how to throw rock
---
Though really its the dev's fault for leaving so many balance issues and exploitable issues for trolls to abuse. At least the EGC solved some of it...

I would only say it‚Äôs good if you look through chests every game that you play.

Probably compatibility issues. My wired 360 pad works fine on pc, but a lot of people including myself, try other controllers and it's like the game is having a seizure in the menu.
---
What‚Äôs a lag switch??

I try to yes and I‚Äôm nice so I even give people the item if they found it first :)
---
Throw it at the killer‚Äôs head and give her a head injury &gt;:(
---
True. PeRioD.
---
It's more about the "fuck you" than anything.
---
The concepts are great, but could use just a tad bit of fine tuning
---
Combos seems extremely niche, considering it's just common items. Seems like it could synergize well with Plunderer's Instinct and Ace in the Hole, but the way it is loses that synergy. Maybe make it so having an item and combining it raises the rarity of the item you're originally holding by one? So brown &gt; yellow &gt; green &gt; purple?
---
Covered Wars would be a pretty strong, must-have perk, I think. Easily up there with DS ans Dead Hard. Being able to replace strong loops would be pretty strong as is, so I'd just remove the extra stun on top of that.
---
Saint is fine, I think. I don't know if any bloodpoint perks ever really need tuning lol

Randoms will most likey not care about what build you have so they won‚Äôt let you open the chest. You‚Äôre better off running a dogshit build than the chest one in my opinion.
---
But I play SWF
---
Small Game is great at clearing a way before you get chased
---
Most trappers I face don't head back to the trap that got disarmed if they see anything else to do
---
Solid bait man.
---
How big is the SWF that you play in?
---
I don't play bubba and never run insidious but I love a good ol' DC. I'll take a bloodpoint hit for it, the salt and comments on my steam profile are worth it
---
When you find the guy who cleansed haunted grounds
---
Huh. Maybe because it‚Äôs more advanced or something? I use basic wired stuff you‚Äôd find laying around an attic. Lol. Those seem to work perfectly fine. :/
---
Nea is Dwight with a beanie confirmed
---
Small as just me and somebody else, as big as a whole squad. I message the survivors before hand to let me open chests so they can get an item with the add ons.
---
My friends were the same but they eventually tried again now they love it after I taught them about how everything works and how to counter some killers
---
Idk how u guys are doing but Im rank 2 Pig/Legion/Freddy player and I consistently have 3-4k
---
Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I‚Äôve had a large amount of really kind swf groups this week, nothing better then expecting toxicity and having a nice endgame chat
---
The only reason I have Bond is 1. I can find teammates and give them items and 2. Get more use out of Open-Handed
---
I got her last month and I honestly hate her. I find that the hit boxes are off with her. I‚Äôve swung point blank at survivors and not gotten a hit. I think she‚Äôs too tall and swings over them? Not sure but I don‚Äôt have that issue with any other killer. 
---
Also found the corrupt vile annoying to use, the stream‚Äôs hitbox seemed off as well.
---
I think it was game grumps
---
You realize teabagging makes the WANT to kill you
---
I'm pretty sure it was originally worded to not count down within the terror radius, like pigs traps are/were.
---
That way it wouldn't tick down while the Legion was actively looking for you, even when you weren't in the chase.
---
For me I feel way more pressure to try and play as killer versus survivor. As a survivor I am either doing gens, saving/healing, or running around like a retard. When I play killer I feel like I have to individually manage all 4 survivors and gen progress while getting rushed out the butt. It's more of a sense of a time crunch to try and hunt everyone down as killer to me, where as survivor is a bit more relaxed for me. But I'm only purple rank baby for both and this is more about how it psychologically affects me than how "easy" one side is over the other.
---
I had 3 toppling Goliath pseudoe sue beers, like 4 shots of Jameson and pickle juice and like one glass of my cute roommates wine. Ready to stab you.
---
Head on is fine. The other two yeah probs not that useful, but don‚Äôt hate on head on.
---
You're saying it's less of a game. I have a great time. I'm glad I paid money for it. If it was such a hindering factor for you, you could have researched before you bought it.
---
I run self-care but I'll always put my team before healing myself. Thinking about it now, im kind of wasting a perk solt lol. I think i mainlu ran it because I've seen No0b3 run it a lot
---
Reminds me of when you want to make a hook save and instead of 99ing the last gen people send it and you have to pray theres no noed lol
---
MoM had a counter if you played M2 killers. NOED has a counter before the last gen gets powered, which is the difference. It‚Äôs also harder to make a good and balanced survivor perk because killers have a bigger window for the variety of what perks can and can‚Äôt be used as an idea without being made terrible or too OP.
---
Wait, there's only one super powerful perk... and of all of them, you pick noed????? 
---
Killer has more perk variety than survivor, easily.
---
K then I guess nurse isn't balanced I guess ok
---
Well when all you see is corn in certain maps, have camoflauge claudettes with self care, desicive, urban evasion and sprint burst, you really dont feel too powerful anymore. Also killers get nerfed consistantly cause survivors wanna complain about them being "too op" then after a couple years we get a rework for killers. So far they fucked up freddy and legion. Freddy got his rework but legion is def bottom tier cause now he has an astma attack everytime he misses an attack and somehow loses the ability to see blood because that makes sense. I understand Legion would be op if they buffed him but they could have just reworked him and not nerf him to the ground. But the devs are incredibly lazy so they just slap it with a nerf hammer until they figure out something better.
---
While I agree that they complain too much and that Ash got scammed hard, it is still difficult to make new fun perks as balancing is always an issue, but yea just give the killers funner perks then they 'might' stop complaining about the surviors.
---
I still find it hilarious  though
---
Marth does his 'experiment', and people constantly belittle him and tell him "Nobody is going to play like that, who the hell is going to just rush generators while injured? Normal people will never tryhard like this"
---
Now 2019 rolls around and everyone suddenly "FUCK HEALING, FUCK EVERYTHING ELSE, BUST THOSE GENS IN 5 MINUTES OR LESS OR YOU FUCKING SUCKS! EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE 100% EFFICIENT AND OPTIMAL ALL THE TIME OR GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY DBD"
---
It's truly a sight to behold
---
I would agree with that I guess I‚Äôm curious to kno what makes survivors good enough to make all the killers in this page complain about them, I‚Äôm not close to the best but I‚Äôve managed to get to rank 5 i find myself getting wrecked by killers who have even half a brain
---
Nothing like bringing a white ward just to get your item smacked out of your hands lol
---
That‚Äôs smart I might try that
---
I think this fits r/speedoflobsters better.
---
I have my own opinions about survivors but i wouldnt say all are toxic.
---
Either way Openhanded (even with Bond‚Äô isn‚Äôt that good of a perk. I‚Äôd say Empathy is better than Bond because tier 3 of the perk lets you see teammates from a farther distance (but it‚Äôs only if they‚Äôre injured)
---
Nobody:
---
This thread: HeE heE HaG hAs nIPplE
---
When the swf tbaggs at the gate after you catch one of them but you have blood warden
---
Pyramid head would be slow af though
---
I don‚Äôt like seeing them from a distance because usually I might try to save, but it will be too late.
---
Just a scary Megan
---
Has anyone told you that you are quite the artist?
---
Is this an idubbbz reference
---
That's not the context we were talking about though. The image is mainly talking about doing totems to prevent NOED. That's why using the Trapper as an example for why Survs should bring Small Game is bad. It would actually distract from the totems.
---
&gt;survivor 1 is a higher skill level than the killer or they deranked
---
&gt;survivor 2 is a lower rank
---
&gt;killer isn‚Äôt good against higher level players
---
&gt;survivor 1 brings HF offering with BL to exploit the houses
---
&gt;killer can‚Äôt counter it so goes for the worst player
---
&gt;survivor 1 flashlight saves because HF isn‚Äôt closed off much so unless you get lucky and down them at a wall, they get saved.
---
They can do that even without Haddonfield because they play with lower ranked friends or derank to get easier games to piss off players who play for fun or aren‚Äôt as good at the game as they are.
---
Again, most killers on this sub are pretty shit and think that because they‚Äôre the killer they can kill most players easily. The general population of killer mains don‚Äôt complain as much as the Reddit killer mains do.
---
Its because entity blocker doesnt go up instantly now. While its still 3 vaults the blocker comes up like 1 second after the third vault. If you spam space on the third you can get a cheeky 4th vault in.
---
Understandable
---
KOS for bloodborn would be crazy,
---
I always asked  "why is there even an option to 'play survivor' and 'survive with friends' when the latter can be used for both?" 
---
gj bhvr
---
Yeah this is a game you either stick it out with for the long run even with the bs that both sides face OR you just up and give up and never touch it again. There is no in between.
---
Oink
---
4 hours?
---
Wraith honestly only works well in those ranks because people are new and don‚Äôt know how to deal with him. One big thing that makes him bad for the higher up ranks is that While he‚Äôs cloaked you could hold a flashlight on him for a couple seconds and he gets stunned the same as a pallet (also applies to nurse but her teleportation way overshadows this slight debuff) Myers surprisingly isn‚Äôt that bad to go against and isn‚Äôt that good in general by himself but he has some of the best add ons in the game two of which allows him to permanently have tier 3 or make it so tier 3 Mories people, he becomes an out right god who stomps any match.
---
Balance is a fickle thing, the more elements you add to it, the harder it is to balance it.
---
I've already got 6 different fuckin installers/launcher on my comp bc companies wanna be complicated, there's no need for another especially if it brings nothing special to the table.
---
Baby Dwight still does because nurse is op
---
Ash as a Deadite
---
They just want to say nice one more time.
---
Better off actually not healing and finishing correct gens, and running dead hard as your second health state

Nice photo did you take it?
---
Why are you so mad about players who want to have fun
---
I‚Äôm following you but as a survivor outside the red ranks is there some method that we use to escape killers that know what they‚Äôre doing? For example I despise playing against hags because they‚Äôre coverage is insaaane Michael Myers and ghost face have stealth options and Freddy‚Äôs hitbox is wild. Unless they‚Äôre significantly lower rank or just not adept at the game they‚Äôre almost guaranteed a high killing game minus hatch or items/addons
---
Left behind suggestion is bad (imagine team running it), deja vu is bad, slippery meat won't work on pig traps because mechanic is different, only as jigsaw box search speed increase, TINH and wake up are also nice... I guess.
---
Perks you buff are mostly situational, and making them stronger in this situation makes them even more specialised. Thats a bad way to buff them, because it becomes even more hit or miss situation. Notice how all meta perks work on every killer.

Too weird to live and too rare to die. You may have known that‚Äôs the actual quote and changed it on purpose just figured I‚Äôd throw out the original quote
---
I was wondering how good infectious fright is on Billy
---
That won't work against any killer who has any idea at all how flashlights work
---
the problem with flip-flop is that it's just a worse unbreakable
---
with unbreakable, you recover faster and can get up anytime
---
with flip-flop, you just get more likely to wiggle off after getting slugged and while it can activate multiple times a match, the killer won't slug you again once then notice
---
Clown or Bubba would be best
---
&gt;Good survivors can move on from a loop.
---
I mean you are assuming that there even is a loop close enough to the window loop. Very often you actually can't leave it, or you'll get hit.
---
&gt;Pop goes the weasel is only good with killers with map control imo: spirit, nurse billy and now Freddy, which makes zero sense because map controlling killers didn‚Äôt need a buff.
---
Not since they've introduced the 60 seconds change. In a lot of matches you'll actually get more value out of pop than ruin, as oftentimes ruin gets destroyed in the very first few seconds of the game.

I really want Amanda to have a version of John Kramer‚Äôs original black/red robes as a cosmetic for her...I‚Äôm talking about the one John uses when he slices Tapp‚Äôs throat.
---
I want to invite my friends to play with me but I'm scared they'll play one toxic game and regret their purchase. Then I'll feel guilty they ended up wasting their money or think I made them make a bad decision.
---
I know but just thought I put that out there.
---
It's not the best perk in the game lol. That's either Dead Hard or Balanced Landing. Self care is MAYBE above average, but really good survivors know how to do gens while injured
---
Wraith is bottom tier with legion, the end. Now I shall not say the reasons why, but please change my mind.
---
You‚Äôre 100% right. I don‚Äôt use self care either cos I don‚Äôt mind being injured, but the circlejerk against it is just crazy to me. The fact that you can heal yourself at any time and in any place alone makes it clearly one of the best survivor perks in the game.
---
Meh, I see flash light stuns all the time at rank 1. If you‚Äôre going to die may as well try a last attempt.
---
4 man DS on pickup did exist and made me want to put my face through my desk at the time, the slug meta was real
---
I don‚Äôt think there is anything survivors do that makes them escape killers who know how to play other than them being a 4man on voice comms with the most annoying perks to vs when all 4 use them. I can get kills against purple ranks if I go full on tryhard without addons, so
---
Thats happened to me. I was pissed.
---
Wanting to have fun =/= ruining the fun of 4 other players.
---
Survivor: OMG you're such a tunneling IDIOT, Trapper!
---
Killer: Yea, you were teabagging at literally EVERY pallet, WHILE flashlight spamming as a P3 Nea!
---
Yet another page in the ol' "reasons why rank means nothing" book I guess if rank 1's are falling for that lol
---
&gt;We need a perk point system. I.E. Pick ten, where you have 10 points to spend but S tier perks cost a lot and crap perks are cheap.
---
Thing is the devs themselves don't seem to think that way about perks. They aknowledge that some perks need buffs, etc. but they want to treat all perks equally when it comes to weighting them value wise.
---
Seeing some perks as clearly better than others while useful can also really hurt build variety which is already pretty bad.
---
I‚Äôve only started playing Killer recently because I realised how much easier it is to get bloodpoints as a killer. But I realised I‚Äôm much less tense when I play killer. I don‚Äôt know why, maybe I was destined to be a murderer XD. But I play both pretty evenly now and Killer and SWF is less tense but playing Survivor without friends is extremely tense for me.
---
They complain so much that it‚Äôs true at this point. I don‚Äôt see as many survivor mains complaining as killer mains on this sub. I mostly just see the killer mains moaning about how the survivors escape easily or bully them.
---
Bruh it's a 1 minute timer. You dont need to base gameplay around said 1 minute timer. You will forget you even had to wait the dreadful eternity of the lobby timer by the time you have seen the first survivor.
---
Woah, calm down there Satan, we don't need a permanently invisible killer that can expose and gen grab you.
---
You‚Äôre nice, cheers buddy. I was only being stupid but thank you

r/unexpectedjojos

Just for a little context (since everyone keeps screaming about a team full of insta heals as if it happens in every single game) I've been recording some data from games lately with players ranking from 2 - 10.  So far out of 42 games only 3 insta-heals have been used, and only 1 of those matches had 2 in the same game.  Now that isn't going to be the exact same experience for everyone, but it is definitely more reliable than throwing your hands up and just *assuming* everyone is running a full lobby of insta heals all day long--that isn't even remotely true.
---
You'll have some games where they come in back to back lobbies, sure, but you'll also have very large dry spells where they aren't used at all.
---
Just for comparison sake, in those 42 games 3 Ebony Mori's were used (same as the total of insta-heals) and 36 insta-down abilities/add-ons/perks were used.
---
Yeah and that's why self-care is a situational perk
---
Let me use my self care pls, I have no friends to coordinate with and need it
---

---
It would be deleted even if it was censored because of rule 8 (no oversaturated content) which includes salty messages.
---
They nerfed corn, now it's actually playable. Tho knowing BHVR it might be just a bug.
---
That's dirty snapping out would take ages if swing chain affects snapping out.
---
I like it.
---
I imagine the disaster dedicated servers will be the first few months.
---
Yeah, but for the rest of the killers, it was like they were getting punished for doing their job. While it wasn't broken perse, it was overpowered against most killers.
---
To be honest there is a huge gap in skill level between PC and Ps4. I have it on both and compared to PC, Ps4 is laughably easier on both sides for the most part. The exception to that being nurse and huntress being hard to use with a controller. Looping is a huge part of it and good players get gens done and get them done quick. If you have 1 or 2 players on the team that can loop a killer around whilst the others actually do gens then gens get done fast. From my experience, and I've sunk a lot of time into both, survivors on ps4 can't cope with ruin and insist on healing if they are injured and that is what gives killers an easier time. Plus they always seem to take their time doing gens. Again, I'm only speaking from my experience but I have looped killers around for fucking ages on ps4 only to have 1 or sometimes even no gens done, even at purple ranks.
---
It's completely on Russian, but if you feel like translating it then here you go http://www.debosh.me

Lol I kinda feel bad for her she only went down cause she put her item down for you man. But yeah it was really stupid on her part haha.
---
They really need to do something to fix SWF at lower ranks, it creates really shitty situations where a rank 19 killer with farming perks is against 4 10+ SWF with meta perks and tools/packs/lights
---
His special ability is to look innocent untill you get close to him then he makes your death look like a suicide

Pretty much that. It was broken, but not completely broken if you had an instadown addon (such as Myer‚Äôs inf t3) or are one of the 4 killers who didnt have to get 2 m1 hits every time to down someone.

Suggestion on BBQ. It's not the strongest idea, But what if you couple Iron Maiden with BBQ?
---
Was it the boogieman?
---
She went heavy on the t-bags the whole match so I didn‚Äôt feel bad lol
---
I can see it being god tier with iron will. No killer expects you to have it in higher ranks, so you can disappear and killer will be scratching it's head. 
---
I like to use lithe with dance with me to dissapear, but it works maybe works 15% of a time, you need a good view blocker to dissapear.
---
Which game was this in?
---
Not optimistic, that's just how many times it procs.
---
That‚Äôs half your load out just to detect survivors after a hook, and they could still hide behind a gen or stay within the radius
---
What about working on a gen hearing a faint heartbeat looking to the left and seeing a legion sprinting directly at you
---
Would all the players get two perks of their choice?
---
Also would killers each pick two perks then have all four effects apply to both?
---
Like just replace small game with calm spirit and noed with doctor
---
All the nordic countries.
---
Yea boil over isn't great and flip-flop is a fun meme perk, but if your going for a good build def wait

So the L is omnidirectional?

Increase the timer to 16 seconds from 14.

Better hiding spots like not beside a gen for example, New bedlum map does this well.. 
---
Clensing a dull totem gives a notification.
---
Small game to have a totem counter simular to thrill of the hunt. 
---
Add 1 more totem to the map for a total of 6.
---
921 hours.
---
Sad you made it about in-game hours. This is not rocket science, if you will give survivors traits it will not be healthy for the game for the reasons I mentioned above.
---
People don't go for Prestige 3 specifically, what I do see people do is go for people with either a flashlight or a toolbox. Never seen people actively go for someone with prestige 3. So that's not really an argument.
---
I think they are fine, just fix totem spawns. They are supposed to be fairly strong at the cost of being destroyed mid game. But the spawn location *ruin*s everything. You can literally find a totem in open field or near gens.
---
I mean, optimistic 5 gens gonna be done in a match ;)
---
They could just make it so 3(or 2) totems spawn with the hex you're using. If they break one  it goes down in efficiency like if you break the first hex ruin it loses the amount it regresses the generators by or make great skill checks bigger the seconds would make 1 or 2 teammates immune(or just makes the amount it regresses less) to it's effect and the last one just completely destroys it  meaning it's still useful just less potent until they destroy them all or just make it normal and if it breaks it loses its potency or denies you the ability to instadown.
---
This is wrong. Her mori is the best part.
---
Yeah, BHVR have done a pretty good job so far, they fix 1 thing and break 5 more.
---
There is no 420 tho :(
---
Exhaustion on that rewind would need to be pretty lengthy
---
you can almost finish a gen instead of self-carrying with a sluppy-butcher on you are just throwing the match. Don't even urge with me how shitty is this perk
---
Ah fair enough haha

especially when it gets gray scaled from the underground area in the temple of purgation, it looks pretty sick

Second discordance, perk is amazing on high mobility killers, it lets you apply alot of pressure
---
Would def start leveling hag for ruin, best gen slow in the game
---
^this. Git gud
---
Nope. So much nope
---
I know what you mean, my only problem is that at high ranks everyone gen rushes which makes it less likely for you to pip since a high rank game is basically who can do the most to earn a pip.
---
Nope so much nope haha
---
Legion overpowered ? HA! Hope he reaches Red ranks, because he‚Äôll never see one again, since it‚Äôs just top tier killers only.
---
That's why I would approve of buffing them in some ways to be useful even for those players.
---
For example, making the mist only affect the Killer/Survivor FoV instead of both sides might actually be worth using.
---
Depends honestly but probably medkit as I require 4 perks for my build to work efficiently which is dead hard, spine chill, borrowed time and adrenaline or urban evasion if I had it unlocked, basically just a build that makes it so I can hide efficiently,save myself and teammate basically a jack of trades build and I don't think self care would work in it.
---
Only infinite there is Haddonfield with balanced landing, and maybe asylum main building. It's 2019. What killer does matters and its not just about how good survivors are.
---
I mean people usually DC out of lobbies they know are doomed to fail. Insta-saw noed bamboozle billy on shelter woods? Literally zero fun to be had. 3 blink nurse? Stick around to see if they're a nurse in training- if they aren't, it's just them doing a daily, because no one in their right mind who can play nurse actually wants to queue 20 minutes to play as something that easy unless they're blowing off steam.
---
There are a lot of games I heavily regret not DC'ing out of earlier on- specifically games against killers like Spirit or pre-nerf Legion who were just infuriating to deal with due to the total lack of agency.
---
There are loads of other reasons that can trigger a DC, but from my own experience it's when I'm tilted from bad teammates/ bad killers using overkill add-ons and me not wanting to deal with *that* or long killer queues.

Having chat in DBD would be too expensive for BHVR. They'd have to hire a whole new team just to deal with the amount of toxic reports.
---
Upvoted because of Stranger Things hahaha! I just finished that recently too, the ending of S3 was not what I expected :(
---
Thats how it should be. Thats why its a mindgame. It works both ways
---
This post is referring to the fact that I main legion and he thinks he‚Äôs overpowered. He does not even have him unlocked
---
You get altruism points for hitting the skill checks tho. I‚Äôd rather try to get more skill checks with Self Care than getting less with a medkit.
---
if you screw up my boy Myers ill personally hunt you. #protect\_myers.
---
Wut? All I see here is bunch of bad killer mains using bamboozle as a crutch cause they can't mindgame and actually trying to argue for it. Pathetic
---
I used selfcare in 2017 after they edited i never used this anymore its just wasting my time
---
I think a lot of Dead by Daylights design philosophy is flawed.  
---
But I realise that's a very controversial statement and a lot of people mean that the style the game is made is part of it's charm and only strengthens the community around it.
---
i already did
---
I wish to find me someone who'll look at me the same way that kid looks at his chocolate bar

You can play around shack. It just takes the brain away from being a killer and hands you the job you're suppose to work for.

If you teabag/flashlight spam for no reason then you deserve it

Something like this happened to me the other day but I was not being a fool. I got to the exit then run back into the killers arms cuz I really wanted to know if they has noed .. they did

As long as you dont sit in a corner for 40secs while your team dies, it's fine. Also you should combine it with Bottany if you wanna be more optimal

I'm the cat that sees both sides are being toxic and crybabies while I eat my bp and shards
---
Thats what the post is about, detective.
---
Bing bong
---
*Same*
---
&gt; Yeah, and Ruin is only good if you don't know how to deal with gen rush
---
True
---
&gt;BBQ and Chili is only good if you don't know how to predict what survivors may be doing
---
If BBQ and Chili didn't award bp I'd probably swap it out and run whispers consistently
---
&gt;Enduring is only good if you don't know how to deal with pallets
---
Enduring really is a BiS perk though on so many killers unfortunately. The *best* way to deal with pallets is disrespect, objectively speaking.
---
&gt;Bamboozle can cut your chase time, fuck with survs (faster vault speed may catch them by suprise), make them drop god pallet, and many other things. I consider it good, and definitly a fine addition to this game's roster of perks.
---
&gt;I may not be running it often, as there are some perks I prefer, but it seems good.
---
Bamboozle is strong-ish but it's anti-fun. If the survivor doesn't know killer has it and cucks themselves into a deadend, free hit or down for the killer.
---
It's not very dynamic or interesting. Just "Hope to god another tile is nearby to use, otherwise this is me basically ending the chase with a perk cause I don't know how to run loops!"
---
I bought this game two years ago.  First play jake, got deja vu lv3 around lv 7. Used deja vu from rank 20 to 10. Until some dude said "why you brought deja vu man, it's pointless". So i never touch that perk again
---
I sometimes forget that there are killers w/o terror radius for some reason, and I find myself doing 360's finding nothing, only to realise that it was a Myers stalking me through a concrete wall with a 1 inch hole. Gotta love spine chill. If it wasn't for it, he would have gained tier 3 just from that, while I was doing gens lol.
---
bubba
---
Don‚Äôt listen to these weirdos in the comments keep doing you bro bro nice clip
---
Yeah but if you actually play dbd, it is relevant.
---
Bing bong bing
---
We're gonna make a wall
---
she was greedy and took it back XD
---
Well i do actually play dbd. I just thought it was funny that‚Äôs where the conversation went.
---
liked the idea, but how does your friend need healing and still doesn¬¥t know how he got injured in the first place?
---
Ghostface bear traps confirmed.
---
Don‚Äôt tell me this, as another Wraith main, I am fulled solely by the thought of survivors atomizing their undergarments when I go ‚ÄúBoo‚Äù
---
Blendette who?
---
THIS is why I run Corrupt Intervention. I either defend the totem to the point I'm not getting in risky chases or pressuring gens enough, to I ignore the totem and it's fucking gone in less than a minute. 
---
Every time I run a Hex it's gone like in the video, and this is why I quit running them. Besides NOED or even just Haunted Grounds by itself.
---
Dude right? I've had people gg me left and right lol
---
Seemed like I was playing him every other match for awhile on Xbox when he was first released. Haven‚Äôt seen him in days now though.
---
Hopefully made up, probably licensed.
---
It‚Äôll be like some sort of like person who kills I think
---
So... Now people are trashing self care because it exists? üò¨
---
It depends on whether I‚Äôm playing with a SWF or not. If not, self care all day. Randoms tend to not care whether you live or die. If I‚Äôm with my squad, then I‚Äôll bring a tool kit or something and we heal each other.
---
How is it shit? It‚Äôs like the first teachable I got and have always used it. If it wasn‚Äôt for it my friends wouldn‚Äôt be able to work on gens. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape heal and then jump back in to the chase while my friends get to knee working on gens. Believe it or not it‚Äôs actually a really good perk that can do a lot and help. It may seem slow but it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Bold choice
---
How often do people sabo ur hooks?
---
Yeah just don't go next to the pawn. Same moves if you go the bottom right.
---
First off almost everyone on PlayStation got dbd because it was free 14 months after it came out. We also got huntress, doctor and maybe nurse(not sure is she free on PC) for free. All the dlcs are half price every 2nd month. To get 9000 iridescent shards you would need to play 195 games roughly you would have accumulated about 4 million xp so spirit,Hag,billy and doctor to level 40 then get spirit and use her. 5 levels later you could get bbq&amp;chilli if it was on shrine of secrets.
---
&gt; Hex totems are supposed to be unreliable since they are usually very strong. ~~Sometimes~~Always they are found almost instantly and ~~sometimes they~~never are hard to find. (Unless you're playing survivor.) Some totem spots are really good and some are not. Hex totems are considered high risk high reward, and if your hex is hidden well, you ~~win time~~lose a perk slot because most survivors will ~~frantically be searching around the map for it.~~ find it in the first 20 seconds. While Hex totems are much more unreliable in higher ranks and against SWF, you have to consider that there are solo players and low rank players as well who spawn with the totem wedged up their butt.
---
Fixed it for you.
---
When the rework first dropped there were Freddy's left and right on Xbox One, but now they're kinda rare again. Don't know why either. Not only is he really strong now, but he's incredibly fun to play as well.
---
Stop crying about t bag its BORING
---
I was so down to go against new Freddy, learn how he works, what can counter him, etc... But the rework dropped... And there was maybe five out of the 10+ games a friend and I had played on the release day? Hell, even before the rework, you didn't see many Freddy players, at least from my experience. I don't know. Now it seems I see him once or twice a week, and I try to play every day, and each sitting is at least a couple hours.
---
Stepped outside into the rain, checked my phone and saw you rang
---
? 
---
Pawns attack at forward diagonals only. And it would require multiple moves for the knight to go directly beside the pawn anyway
---
Good thing they're on sale
---
Could just be a PS4 thing then. It wasn't even left and right for me and my friends when it dropped.
---
A lot of people are safety pipping for doing too good, this....this isn't how a ladder system is supposed to sort by skill.
---
If you beat your opponent, they should be forced back up the ladder and you go down it.
---
The issue is that the scoring system is rooted in chores, and you don't always have control of your emblems.
---
It got better for survivor, since they changed the scoring threshold for purple and red ranks for them but its actually a pain in the ass for purple ranked killers at the moment.
---
its been non meta for a while. The biggest issue with it is low ranks where games go for 20 minutes because literally people heal everytime they're hit off in a corner
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpa6ve/crazy_ecg_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I usually run Plunderer's, Ace in the hole, Pharmacy and Streetwise, with a Yellow chest offering. 
---
It works way better than I thought at first glance. You barely take any time in searching the chests, usually get medkits with charges for 2+ heals (only exception being when you pull a medkit with the -25% charges pad, and often 2 charges addons for 3 heals, or even an insta. You'll also get crazy good toolboxes, or even a surprise (to the killer) flashlight. And keys, God bless keys.
---
Sorry I think there was a misunderstanding, I meant diagonal to the pawn (1 move) how would the Knight be eliminated in the scenario where goes for the rook?
---
So what if I want to play a Killer who doesn't have the insta-down capabilities?
---
That's what you don't seem to be getting; when MoM was popular, every single perk that the builds ran with it had counterplay no matter who the Killer was.
---
- With DS, just don't tunnel or if it's unavoidable slug them and leave for a minute.
---
- Adrenaline could be a non-issue if you just killed them prior to the gate opening up.
---
- Borrowed Time was only an issue if you camped.
---
- Dead Hard you could bait out the activation and just smack them normally.
---
- MoM, you were fucked in the Character Selection Screen.
---
If a Perk can only be countered by simply not playing a majority of the roster, it's a broken perk.
---
That's true. I have it in case of emergency but usually I use bond.
---
Exactly. If it's in the game working as intended, it should be usable without being chastised
---
Often. I sabo hooks myself whenever I have a toolbox
---
I like those ideas
---
Yooo
---
No sound bing bong x ghost soot add on = fun times
---
Haddonfield says hello
---
The clip is funny, but I'm the only one bothered to see how easily a Billy can slalom trough the map? I mean, I don't think he deserves any nerf, but shouldn't be a little more difficult to do stuff like that?
---
That is bull and you know it. Instead of just being salty, why don't you provide some more depth to your point of view? People tend to only remember the times their totem got destroyed early and not the times they might've gotten a 4k with ruin still up with maybe only one gen done. That's the whole RNG of the game, but in the last 2 weeks playing my Pig with only Ruin 1, I've gotten a 4k every single time with no more than 2 gens done and ruin not even being destroyed most of the time. Granted, it was low ranks, because I hadn't played in a while, but totems exist on the map, you can't have them be invisible and still expect to have ruin. Since every killer and their dog runs ruin (yes, even me) or NOED nowadays, survivors will eventually catch on where totems are usually hidden or run small game to counter the Hexes.
---
I try to avoid most Hex perks myself, because there are much better perks to run and if I do, it's usually just ruin, or if I'm feeling frisky Devour Hope tier 1, since it doesn't give a notification when it activates, so survivors won't look for it specifically. But playing both sides, I've come to expect Ruin and NOED, so you bet that I'll be looking for every last single totem.
---
The only Hex I think needs a buff, is Huntress Lullaby. There's no reason for it to give a notification as soon as you get a skillcheck when it hasn't even activated yet.
---
Is he meg? Never seen that outfit. Either way, earlier in this very thread he states that there is a nea outside the house and is too stupid to open the gates. She isn't in the clip
---
I'm a piggy main and ateongly suggest her, but if you have to choose between her and leatherface. Go leatherface
---
 BBQ and chili is too good to pass up and you hurt yourself without it. It makes leveling up a dream and if you dont want to run it, just take it off.
---
Yeah I was trying not to assume the direction of the game but if we assume the picture was taken at White's perspective then of course, white is unable to take the rook after just one move. Could you clarify how knight would be eliminated? If he went for the rook first that is?
---
Awful alot of work for a totem that can be broken.
---
There half price every 2nd month. You can literally pick up leather face for ‚Ç¨2.49 or spirit dlc for 4 euro.
---
That is why I run BL 100% of the time.
---
But it sucks to get a map where the only drops are basement stairs and one crappy hill.
---
Me and my gf that does not exist :(
---
NOED is completely fine as it is because it has a counter that can be done no matter what and it is called cleansing dulls. If you have the time to look for Ruin,  you have the time to look for dulls. It's the same thing because you're wasting time that could be spent doing gens with either of those.
---
If NOED was nerfed or changed, the only endgame build to exist right now wouldn't work as well. 
---
Option 1: It completely removes the point of NOED. NOED is meant for survivors to still be afraid of going out to save that one player who got hooked to keep the remaining survivors from wanting to go back and unhook. This is why I cleanse dulls whenever I pass them (when I'm not in a chase ofc). I don't want my teammates to die because I didn't want to do something that counters a perk.
---
Option 2: This would make NOED useless. It's called No One Escapes Death for a reason. Survivors would just look around really fast for NOED then go for the gates if somebody destroyed it.
---
Option 3: Again, makes NOED useless. This does not give survivors the fear of going back in to unhook the last guy to be downed to NOED. Instead,  it would make survivors want to make a last minute decision even if the killer could have NOED.
---
Option 4: NOED is an end game perk or it wouldn't be called NOED. It would be better off removing NOED than going with option 4
---
The cars are all irrelevant because the Octane is better then all the others in dbd it‚Äôs completely different.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpagvq/heh_i_taste_their_weaknesses/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.
---
Guesswork. If you have an Obsession without running an Obsession perk then DS is a possiblity. If they're still playing extra cocky after their first hook, DS is a possibility.
---
Bear in mind that DS is there to prevent a tunnel, so try to rotate your attacks as much as possible. Failing that, slug them all and hope that no-one is running Unbreakable.
---
Lmao
---
Nah, the optimal play is to self care through sloppy butcher/ thanatophobia while your teammate with we'll make it stands there next to you. You've got to assert dominance.
---
Lmfao I love this
---
Well that huge waste of time will fuck you up if you ignore it. Its the same for any hex. Ignore it = Get fucked. This argument is also stupid. Just because a killer is playing incredibly shit doesnt mean he gets "rewarded" for using noed. You obviously fucked up and ignored the possibility of noed and you got mad about it because the killer was lucky enough to have dumbshit survivors who dont want to waste their time on useless totems. The killer was rewarded by your stupidity. Not the hex
---
Neither. Rely on your teammates for heals, run Adrenaline, and loot a chest if you really need heals. 
---
Self-Care is a complete waste of time nowadays. The time that you're spending self-healing could be used repairing gens to help the whole team. 
---
Also, Iron Will is a super underrated perk that helps you in chase and can remove the need to heal until it's not detrimental to the team, granted you're a competent looper.
---
You have to earn those effects, and every instance of having an instadown has a counter.  MoM was going to fuck you one way or another wether you like it or not.  You can‚Äôt choose not to hit survivors.
---
Michael is so fun but he you have to get bbq
---
I have legitimately had games where I run Object Of Obsession and gen rush but when the killer sees my aura I run towards them,  make sure the killer sees that, change directions then turn the camera away then run the opposite direction and I am never seen.
---
Problem is that you're spending all that time and a whole perk slot instead of repairing gens or rescuing to help the whole team. To each their own though.
---
If they just stay there is their fault. No reason for u to move. No gens pops, nothing.
---
That was survivors fault.
---
7/11 was a part time job...
---
Ah...i think meg is pretty obvious... a killer starting to sprint burst seems insane
---
Yea
---
Nope, the killer was still rewarded for shit gameplay lol. I've played an excessive amount of this game and most of the time NOED rewards garbage killers.
---
Nope, play your way. They wanted it on their terms. Some survivors(or a lot honestly) use the term ‚Äúcamping‚Äù very loosely. They tried to go for the save broadly without being smarter in doing so. Don‚Äôt take their messages to the heart.
---
Frank is definitely one of my most wanted Survivors for DbD, if you have any criticisms let me know! Did some minor tweaks.
---
That legion was not playing with headphones, nor did he seem high rank letting Meg escape so easily without noticing. Meg got extremely lucky.
---
nae nae
---
So true
---
Thanks I honestly paid no attention to it but this morning I woke up and was like was I in the wrong really
---
Hahaha karma
---
Thanks for the input makes me feel better
---
EGC shifted the game so heavily in killer's favor lolwut
---
Tbh that was my initial thought and I think killers are too strong.
---
You are the right side of this photo
---
Lol
---
I think it would be nice if the Legion vaulted and came out of Frenzy a hair faster, but that's really it. Having them getting kicked out of Frenzy when they whiff was a necessary change, it was ridiculous how before they could just slash and slash and slash with no penality. Plus one of the major complaints about Legion before their rework was that they had very little to no counterplay, and whiff punishment adds counterplay. I'm kinda with you though that they should be able to see blood while in Frenzy. I mean you should be right on somebody when you initiate Frenzy so the first hit is easy, and then killer instinct points you towards other survivors, but still it's kinda lame that they lose both blood and scratch marks when they enter Frenzy.
---
It's an editing, but not mine. Found it on /r/MemeEconomy. I don't know which episode it is, sorry!
---
i still get scared :(
---
My bad, it is Lithe he uses. I got my perks mixed up.
---
Yeah. It's so funny when the killer finally downs you and the last gen pops so you adrenaline away. As a killer i It makes me want to throw my computer out of the window
---
Then you obviously havent played long enough. I aint no survivor main but i always break totems even if its time consuming. And 9 times out of 10 when I run noed It had 0 uses. You take a guess for why it had no uses. Hint: rank 1 survivors dont ignore shit
---
I use a medkit because i am not claudette sitting in bush to heal myself . Most of the time i am getting chased If not i have friends to heal me.
---
How do you figure that? I think I‚Äôve seen the entity spike people maybe two or three times and one of those was because I was curious to see it and the other was because I was being trolled by a slugging trapper. The end game timer is so generous it basically only exists to prevent troll survivors from holding the game hostage. The hatch stand off was an absolutely good change to prevent the stupid hatch stand offs as well.
---
When your pizza rolls are done
---
Pls just commit lego brick and never return with this picture .
---
Iron Will, Quick and quiet, diversion, and Urban evasion. The last teo perks are of your choice. If you want to really be stealth, you'll choose perks like spine chill or premonition, so you can avoid chases at all
---
people still use this perk for some reason, rounds go by so slow and is a waste of a perk slot if the killer is legion or plague
---
i had all bloodpoints perks so ranking up wasnt my concern but these people took the match way too seriously, swf or not it doesnt matter they managed to rush the gens in a few minutes while trolling me inbetween &amp; moving in groups of 3 when one wasnt leading me in a chase
---
Her sword shattering when you hit a wall carrying a survivor. (That's still there right?)
---
BP dont matter for ranking up.
---
When that booty game be poppin'.
---
Yasssss we love this game. There's actually a huge LGBT community in DBD. Downvoted by the way, girl bye ‚úåüèª
---
The question is if they are Claudette
---
And the baby Dwight hidden in a locker in the background
---
I may check it out. I dont wanna be a super pro, I just wanna have average enjoyable games.
---
Ty for realizing this is more about me asking for some help than a rant.
---
Most of the tips I saw are pretty obvious and dont give me more ideas than just keep smashing my head into the wall til it breaks
---
I've seen killers complain about it in post-game chat when they either tunnel someone out of a game or just end up camping and get a lot of skipped hook phases. As a killer main myself bouncing between purple and red (so I am seeing those games where it takes 9 "points" to safety), I've only seen it when someone dcs on first down and causes a chain of dcs.
---
I played since the release on console. I didnt say it was OP. I just think its a scummy. Just like you think using NOED on other killers is scummy. I knew what the old DS was and it sucked and I still hate it with a burning passion. But judging from the fact you want to create a complete rework for something you dont wanna deal with is overly pointless and lazy on your part. "Its scummy" Man. Such a true veterans of DBD. Words of wisdom. Now heres something for you to learn, quit whining about things that already have a damn solution you lazy ass survivor.
---
Spook
---
Selfcare/Botany/Resiliance/Dead Hard.
---
If you can run the killer around well and micro also you can potentially top yourself up, I've done it many times. If you lose the killer or the killer breaks chase, 99 yourself and then enjoy doing everything faster and if you hear the heartbeat getting close heal (Wouldn't recommend this strat against spooky killers.) l hover around mid to high rank casually but can easily hit red with a day or two of nonstop grinding and i usually top bp on my team for the "trash meme rank 20 build" naysayers.
---
You can only use a medkit a few times and randoms won't always heal you.
---
Fr that is me but I‚Äôm a rank 10 and go against rank 1 survivors
---
You realize I'm not OP right? I'm not the one asking for a complete rework of the perk. I think it's one of the less pressing issues of the game right now. I'm just stating the fact that NOED often rewards bad gameplay, like I've said ten times.
---
üëèplentyüëèofüëèpeopleüëèsayüëèthisüëèseriouslyüëè

We must be looking at a different r/DeadByDaylight then.
---
It‚Äôs about basic empathy. I‚Äôm not saying any random persons game experience is more important than my own, however it is not emotionally enduring to just have a bad game and go. 
---
That‚Äôs the biggest problem with DC‚Äôs in this game rn. People are too emotionally invested in a fun quota to meet that they expect each and every match to the point that one thing just triggers a mass DC wave and it‚Äôs just so pathetic.
---
Problem is that this game is asymmetrical, they only need to change it to be symmetrical. Two teams of survivors competing in gen repairs, first team to fix 5 gens wins.
---
is this sarcasm because legion is actual garbage regardless
---
oh sorry I forgot to clarify, you would run one of these plus solidarity lol
---
( *okay i just noticed that ignore that part* ) But rest of my points still stand
---
Normally, they‚Äôre not. But you can only take generalities with this sort of stuff because of how many variables there are in most games.
---
But, that would just be a game of gen rush and not an interesting horror game.
---
I personally think that killer games are a lot more stressful than surviver games. Killers other than nurse or spirit have to do more than just "making no mistakes" in order to win.
---
Then do a generator or use stealth and looping to evade and waste the killers time. Anything but spend precious time and losing pressure on the killer to self-care in the corner. 
---
Adrenaline is a godsend and a pretty necessary perk at high ranks. You'll find that at higher ranks the current meta isn't to heal all the time but instead use your time efficiently.
---
Buh gawd
---
yeah hes rare a lot of freddy mains gave up on the rework along time ago and some went head and gave him a shot and theres those who faithfully play as him but the chances of you get him is low especially with the increase In variety  of killers
---
An awesome screenshot?
---
Fair enough lol
---
Oh I just of got mixed up
---
Doctors either have amazing or fucking horrible matches, dont think theres an inbetween
---
Meg head
---
heh, lol Sounds just like my gf hahaha..
---
ha...
---
I think we are reading different subs. All I see is complaining about ruin, noed, tunneling and camping
---
Jeez, how many times has this format been used on this subreddit?
---
He's not overpowered, he's just annoying tbh.
---
What exactly, in your oppinion, is the difference between a guessing game and a mindgame? With examples please :)
---
You're fun.
---
The player. I use hag as one of my main killers. Always manage to get 4 K‚Äôs with her.
---
&gt; Well, now you are arguing the spirit of the game and what you believe your goals as killer and survivor are, not that camping and tunneling can be effective tools.
---
But there is a line. At some point the spirit of the game is relevant.
---
Otherwise everyone would be advocating the tunnel + camp, NOED tunnel + camp strat for killer, and the "hide and wait" strat for survivor.
---
&gt;If you want to apply some arbitrary rules or code of conduct for yourself, that is fine. Just don‚Äôt expect others to know, adhere to, or care for your arbitrary rules. You kill as killer and survive as survivor. Those are the goals.
---
It's less about respecting invisible rules for survivors and holding yourself to standards. Why don't you facecamp with NOED as Bubba? It *really* is effective, and often many survivors try and get cocky with you, so you can slug them.
---
Maybe it's because you believe in yourself? Maybe that's why that's the reason you don't run 3 blink nurse with ebony mori every chance you get?
---
When people complain about tunnelling and camping, there IS a direct counter. Doing gens. But that is not engaging for anyone involved- survivors want to be doing anything but holding M1 on a gen. As killer you effectively punish yourself for playing the way you are, and the reason you get utility out of it is because players don't want to be bored.
---
Shouldn't you respect your own ability a little bit to earn those kills without this pseudo-spite dynamic?
---
Ash give him his chainsaw god dammit.
---
if they all stand here, staying is the correct play. the hooked person loses their hook timer while no gens are being done. they should go away to put gen pressure on you
---
I hit level 55 yesterday I will avenge you if possible
---
Lol you have to eat 4 pallets before you can use spirit fury once, aint gonna save you from survivors with sprint burst who knows every pallet &amp; window location on the map
---
Me a Jake Main.
---
legion rework?
---
/u/priestSRC I don't see Behavior changing this any time soon. Because this helps their bottom line. Do you want to stand a chance as killer versus red ranks? Better grind for shards and pay auric cells for that character that has the perk you "need." Emphasis not on "want" like "Oh, that perk looks like fun and will add variety to the gameplay." NO. A perk that you NEED to slow the goddamn game down. 
---
It's a vicious cycle. Gotta' play the game for BP and Shards to get a new killer, get BP and dump into new killer, get BP and dump into other killers to get new perk.
---
Let me know if you succeed. Good luck :)
---
Number 3 and Number 1 for my boyos
---
 
---
Encourage her to play both sides. It's really the best way to get a feel for how everything works and what you can and can't get away with. After that it's just a lot of practice, learning the details of how everything works, and watching better players and what strategies they use. 
---
Good luck to both of you!
---
Is that even true i always feel like I get worse bloodwebs
---
I‚Äôve created a monster
---
Yeah the Hag is so strong, good ability, good teachable perks and she smol so you can't see her very well
---
I dont think its safe to eat shards
---
If the killer played so terribly you managed to fix all the gens with them not having even 3 hooks, what stops you from also doing totems?
---
I have every killer teachable unlocked, and every killer I play has every perk I could possibly want and I'm still complaining. The problem isn't only the decisions they've made in the past, but their design philosophy will ensure the game continues to be plagued by problems like Legion, Mettle, Ruin RNG, etc.
---
Lol I think they might not realize they can mend. I've been seeing it too every so often.
---
Nice flair
---
As long as you‚Äôre not walking around aimlessly as either survivor or killer you‚Äôre getting things done, hop on a gen and hit the skill checks, cleanse some totems for blood points and in case they have No One Escapes Death (NOED).
---
I‚Äôd suggest you play as Claudette and play with her perks cause they‚Äôre all very good especially self care which allows the ability to heal when team mates are either at the other side of the map or busy looping and empathy allows you to see injured survivor auras so you can go and heal them assuming you or they are not in a chase of course. And finally if you get lucky with your bloodweb spine chill is a perk that I personally find very useful for information and helping you more successfully adopt the stealth build in order to gain faster knowledge of when the killer is coming your way!
---
But yeah, good luck!
---
No thanks
---
Double pop is at least two golds and two iridescents AFAIK
---
myers is the most fun in my opinion
---
pig is also kinda fun
---
LF is terrible to play but has the best killer perk in the game that cuts the grind in half
---
thanks man
---
can't say that about yours tho
---
Yep. I'm not sure why they didn't address this when EGC came out. It's probably on one of their lists for when they rework perks again.
---
Well to be fair as any survivor the gens are actually really great to hide behind. (If you haven‚Äôt worked on it of course)
---

Peobably license since we didnt get any teaser, and the new killer prob comes out next week
---
Self care is great, but there's definitely an argument to just pack a medkit instead if you want to free up the perk slot.
---
Oh I'm sorry, they asked me to turn down the CROMCH
---
No doubt
---
Not sure if I was the original person who suggested Flip-flop but I definitely made a post about it on the forums. It's cool to know that the devs listen, despite what a lot of people may think.
---
As a Laurie main somebody should take these models and create the Laurie that we so rightfully deserve and the one with an actual cute outfits instead of disgusting banana pants and ugly hair cuts.
---
Imagine the blue shirt but with the shirt omg that'd so be cute.
---
This is a clip from my stream yesterday
---
4 games of 2 gens completed and then 2 without kills. Yeah, you're not wrong
---
I bought new Kate cosmetics!
---
Yup some pallet stun scares are the fucking worst, never get scared as Survivor.
---
Let's see who Nea, I-I mean the Entity brought.
---
The irony is that they could easily fix a ton of problems by just slowing down the game. But if you make any suggestions on how to do that (whether that entails slowing down the gens or adding secondary objectives) you just get shouted down and down voted by the usual suspects.
---
If you delete the game, I'm pretty sure that your rank, level, cosmetics etc. get deleted
---
But hes suddenly behind you.
---
I played as spirit yesterday with ruin and an ebony mori.  I felt kinda dirty afterwards.
---
I think they meant we got the new Laurie from Halloween 2019 instead of the old one lmao
---
You've only seen the entity spike two or three people because all the other times the killer was chasing the guy off of one of the two doors.
---
He got his finger stuck in a locker.
---
I just assumed the issue is that there arent 4x as many survivors as killers. Do we know what the average ratio is of ppl playing survivor to ppl playing killer on a given day?
---
Considering legion is probably the easiest killer to rank up with it's actually surprising. You can easily pip without getting a single kill just because of how legion is designed.
---
Also I see a good variety of killers in red ranks, it's not only nurse/Billy anymore which is nice.
---
It's glitchy though.  There are occasions when spine chill doesn't go off with Ghost face.  Might be when two survivors on a gen at once.  I've had it happen 7 or 8 times in the past couple of months and twice last night.  He just walked right up and grabbed me twice and his symbol never appeared above the progress bar.
---
4 pallets?  It works after 2 pallets if you have it max rank.
---
Don't think so, but I believe it's not because everyone doesn't play survivor, literally play survivor...and you'll join up with other survivors??? I guess idk I'm high on no sleep and it's crackhead hours
---
This was with me, but with GF. I was in one of the basement with all the lockers on Badham, and I was looking between the two doors, and I look over and I see his damn face staring at me. Quite horrifying.
---
If tunneling and camping worked in every situation or if everyone was using NOED LF as a strat, then that is something the devs need to fix, not the players. If the counter to camping is going gens and that is not fun, then again that is a dev issue and not a player issue. 
---
Again, you talk of morals and lines. That is all you, not others. How others Play is not up to you. I respect my ability to play enough not to limit myself to arbitrary rules and use all tools at my disposal 
---
Are you going to chastise SWF for using 3rd party comms to have bear 100% knowledge of where the killer is at all times? ‚ÄúBill, I am on the other side of the map with the killer. You can do the gen safely‚Äù. That is not very engaging, fun, or pushing skill.
---
‚ÄúSweaty‚Äù is such a stupid term. Just because they‚Äôre better you?
---
Still I believe a good nurse never use noed. Not i said that they cannot use it, I don't understand those downvotes lol. A god nurse can win perkless and noed makes her way too strong. If you actually played rank 1 you would know that genrush is the only counter to her and most of the time it fails.
---
LMAO I MEAN GEN XD
---
So much fax.
---
Hens running around you instead of crows xD
---
When two survivors are on a gen, i don't think it appears on the progress bar, tou have to look at the perk icon itself I think
---
Only issue I have with that is sometimes the doors spawn next to each other. Other than that it‚Äôs in line with the killer snow balling off kills and it becoming harder to escape.

Dude.. I don't know how many times I've had a teammate keep trying to heal me while we're out in the fucking open.  Then I have to run away... 
---
Like, dude, come the fuck on.  There's a wall we can hide behind 3 feet away.
---
&gt;How can I get into this game and be competitive 
---
It's not a competitive game. It's about as casual as it gets.
---
‚ÄúAre u a woman?‚Äù Sexist much.
---
Easiest killer to get bloodpoints with too
---
Just don't continue the conversation bruh, face camping is not bannable, it might be trash but you just gotta live with it
---
Ebony mori makes SWF tuck tail and run. They all rage quit lol 25 ebony moris more to go lololol
---
Reminds me of this clip i got a few years back while streaming the culling
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/59849958
---
Man, I feel that.  I always seem to get in matches with dumbasses who spend the entire match just running aimlessly, leaving a trail for the killer to follow. 
---
The best is when my teammates send me hate messages after they die.  I'm just sitting there thinking, "Ah yes.  You were the one farming everyone off the hook in front of the killer.  Yeah, you're damn right I didn't get you off the hook."
---
Unbreakable isn't that good with DS now since all you have to do is jump into a locker.
---
This happened to me as well
---
I always feel special when the killer uses a non-ebony mori and chooses to mori me.  Like I am the chosen one.
---
Good job :thumbs up
---
&gt; Again, you talk of morals and lines. That is all you, not others. How others Play is not up to you. I respect my ability to play enough not to limit myself to arbitrary rules and use all tools at my disposal
---
I mean, I queue survivor to have fun, certainly not for points. If I queue into a lobby and you're using a boring strat, I'm DC'ing because you'll get the kill but my patience is salvaged.
---
I'm not above moral highground but there is genuinely room for killers and survivors to both play really well and have tremendous fun in this game.
---
And thats why I use botany with self care
---
special needs\*
---
I thought /s was not needed here, turns out it was.
---
GG haha
---
Oh noo! Hope the next match is better.
---
I'd never thought giving an opinion can label you as an arrogant asshole. I just said that a nurse with noed is like breaking the game with nurse more than ever. Also, why insidious is supposed to be so hated when it's very easy to win these matches. Nurse with insidious is very easy also, because she will always be moving. But yeah, people like you who assume anything just because of a fucking sentence makes you triggered as hell. Grow up, kid, and develop a personal opinion instead of following others (and now everyone saying that they genuinely thought nurse with noed is not op and I was a bitch by saying that aloud).
---
What flat? If it's the mask, the only explanation is that I had two days to mask it so it looked like that. I didn't have time to make a proper strap. Thanks btw c:
---
I don‚Äôt see the difference.
---
HOW. DO. YOU. DO. IT?!
---
Reading the "solo players" comments, it feels like they are the only one playing, they do all 5 gens all by themselves while running the killer at the same time and doing bones is asking too much.
---
Yeah, but around 30ish meters you can see the killer kind of in view or you have a general idea. I like Premonition, but if I'm about to finish a gen and Spine Chill procs, I can fully commit to the gen because the repair speed % buff.
---
The best part about Spine Chill is the ability to be aware they're COMING in your direction, which gives you plenty of time to get somewhere you can cover your basis. The only downside Premonition has is that a killer can easily bait it's CD just by doing a loop to trigger it, and unless you have rank 2 or 3, you're kind of unlucky if he happens to come your way.
---
Did you just film someone else‚Äôs PS4 (uploaded) clip on your computer?  I feel a seizure coming on.
---
&gt;people like you who assume anything just because of a fucking sentence makes you triggered as hell. Grow up, kid,
---
Don‚Äôt tell me you can‚Äôt see the irony here
---
sprint burst in 2019 lel
---
It does for every other killer and USUALLY does for ghost face as I recall...just occasionally doesn't with him.  I know the bar itself might not reflect it but with spine chill when ghost face comes our way there should be a total of two, or more commonly three little icons above the gens progress bar...a handful of times no icons popped up and there he suddenly was ...but admittedly I'm only about 70 percent sure so far ...still keeping tabs on it...I look at the perk icon on the bottom right of the screen when I'm moving around sometimes but it pretty much flashes on and off the whole damn math so it's hard to use as a guide I find.
---
Yeah, please, save your ass by saying "Oh, I was joking, it was irony". Too many times dude.
---
Frank west beats up literally thousands of zombies I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôd be able to knock the shit out of legion, but It‚Äôs still a good idea:)
---
You actually don‚Äôt see the irony I‚Äôm astounded
---
Shit its been a while since i have read the book/ watched the movies my bad :)
---
Had a Nea yesterday against a Nurse. She downs someone outside the central building and the gen is at 85%. She's healthy and has Adrenaline, I'm injured and I commit, but then she runs away. I almost get the gen, Nurse decides to kick it, finds Nea in the process. Then she comes back to me, I run her for a bit, when she finally gets me I see Nea self-caring.
---
That dumb bitch got hatch, too. Life's unfair.
---
If only everyone understood that... I keep saying the exact same thing when I use an ebony mori, but they don‚Äôt wanna hear it.
---
Please explain how I‚Äôm being ignorant. The only thing I see here is high ground Harry wanting desperately to be right about a situation wanting to look like they don‚Äôt care when you‚Äôre getting offended by downvoted on Reddit
---
Yeah and then they turn right around and bring flashlights and instantheals and type "ez" after the game ends
---
It'd be about as balanced as any other killer
---
I'm confused by the image but also annoyed at it. I can respect you might not know to hide usernames in post by on accident. But you cover your own username? cmon, be a bit respectful.
---
I got to 1million BP and finally P1 Plague. Got her back to level 36 AND picked up bbq level 2, ruin, pop, and level 3 save the best for last. I‚Äôm gonna love playing her more.
---
Ok but that still scares me sometimes ngl
---
"And this is why the second killer is a leatherface escorting a god tier nurse to the hook"

Cheat engine. I don't know how, but this is not his actual steam profile, he Is like using a debug one, otherwise he would get banned
---
What? Everyday theres multiple posts about teabagging and anti-survivor posts.

---
All I know is that it's name will start with "the"

Can't count the number of times I've died because people are self caring in the corner whilst I'm struggling on hook
---
Sadly, as long as there is some competition in a game, there will be toxicity as well.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would love this community to be less toxic and to stop all the fighting between mains and sides, but competition can bring out the worst from some of us.
---
Still pretty new to this game, but one of my friends picked up the game last week and we've been playing swf. I'm starting to get some serious appreciation for killers such as Myers or Ghostface, as they really make it a completely different game. Before my friend picked it up, I was pretty much a killer main and only played survivor a few times, mainly coming up against Bubba or Billy who are usually pretty aggressive. But playing against stealthier killers adds a whole new fear dynamic to the game that I just didn't get with the likes of the base killers (maybe other than Wraith). Really diversifies the game!
---
As a legion main I agree
---
Hate how everyone is so committed to shitting on people's perk choices in general if they're outside the meta. Yes, self-care can waste time, I've seen happen numerous times. I also seen some people use it great and pull off a bunch of hook saves and just be an awesome teammate in general.
---
Also, maybe, just maybe, some survivors like myself don't get joy from gens flying by in 5 minutes. It's why I run Small Game on most builds and try to find totems. Maybe I just want to do something else outside gens or being in a chase with a killer. 
---
But a lot of that is on the devs though for not making nothing out of chases that engaging for survivors.
---
Flip Flop is definitely better, but both are pretty bad. 
---
FF is only decent combined with Unbreakable and/or Tenacity
---
Unknowledgement of tools, sometimes that perks that hides you are not that worthy as well as others, or, just complaining about everything.
---
But she's short so she gets lost in the corn :(
---
Im on both sides so..... help
---
Pretty sure it's the other way around
---
Just fucking reverse it to its old version where it only lasted 2 minutes and then making it only actovate when EGC triggers.
---
"What's your favorite meta perk?"
---
Lol. This is the part people don't take in account. They also seem to forget the gen jockeys that assumes everyone has Adrenaline *and* that all the gens will be done before you're in struggle.
---
They're usually wrong 9 times out of 10 in my experience. But hey, the objective is done right? It was blast holding M1/R1 huh?
---
Wasn‚Äôt me
---
Imagine giving Silver for a decade old Adult Swim clip
---
But is the competition really necessary. Ofcourse you want to survive/kill all Survivors. But you only get BP there is no other reason to do overwhelmingly good than a few more BP, because the Ranking system is worth nothing for you as a player.
---
So why not appreciate the fun and see DBD as what it is: a damn game that is supposed to make fun.
---
Neither
---
True, my acknowledgment of most perks for survivors is nonexistent. I dont play survivor as much as killer
---
https://i.imgur.com/w6toNXL.jpg
---
*Matchmaking intensifies*
---
Now that you've reached it itll be harder to stay out of rank one rather than to reach it
---
I mean maybe it would help, but it would destroy yourself a little bit too and thats not what I want.

Lol must have no life. I feel sorry for you that you're such a small person.
---
&gt; So you DC when you are not having fun
---
Yeah I don't play survivor for BP. I like the cathartic matches, even if I die. More often than not I get mad at teammates instead of the killer- I feel like I have more enemies as survivor than I do killer most of the time.
---
&gt;there are issues with SWF cheating
---
It's literally not cheating. "They have spirit fury" is about as crazy as you can get. Most SWF plays can be coordinated in solo queue with survivors smart enough. Often SWF are dumb idiots goofing off too cocky for their own good.
---
&gt;And yet you don‚Äôt think it is acceptable for a killer to quickly take out one survivor so they can have a more enjoyable match or for them to use IN-GAME mechanics to their advantage.
---
It's not "not acceptable"- tunnelling and camping works against you and at best rewards you for lazy gameplay. You cannot complain about genrush on one hand and say "tunnelling sometimes works" on the other. You're outlining the root of your own problem doing that.
---
My friends and I were like ‚Äúfuck it. Conga line?‚Äù And we happened to get a ghost face who looked at us for a moment, and then joined the line as we slow crouched our way to a gen. Was the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd witnessed. Tried it again the next game with a legion. He was a try hard with no soul :(

We all messaged him afterwards ‚Äúno conga?‚Äù

---
You realize the objective is to escape right? And you have to repair gens to do that? And if everyone is commited to the same goal that you can get it accomplished more effectively right?  
---
You know how killers complain gens get done too fast? Thats because good survivors understand doing objectives is more important then a health state.
---
Bug report: for some reason the sickened effect doesn't apply of Myers, instead it reveals the survivors aura and applies a permanent stack of blood lust.
---
You using the come here emote as taking items really was cool as fuck lol

china players are playing sould at stake right now...?

The Friday the 13th system is nice, where you got to do different things but I don't think it would work that well with DBD. But something else then Generators would be fun.
---
&gt;So healing and saving pads time for those doing gens to do them in peace.
---
And neither of those things require SC. Get on a gen, wait for a teammate to find you and if its safe they can heal you.  
---
If the killer find you, be proactive and don't get dropped immediately. If the killer is chasing you (injured or not) thats 3 team mates doing gens. Unless they are all selfish caring, in which case it doesnt matter if you were full health or not because no one is making progress. **BUYING TIME FOR TEAMMATES BY EXTENDING A CHASE DOESNT MATTER IF NO ONE IS ON A GEN IN THE FIRST PLACE.**

Big Sad
---
They really aren‚Äôt going to. They still claim that it‚Äôs fixed when it feels like it happens even more often now. Last week I got this glitch like 20 times in the course of 3 hours. The very first time it happened I was against a Legion. Any time I got FF‚Äôed I couldn‚Äôt mend. I had no progress bars, and I didn‚Äôt have the option to use my Dead Hard. Then this happened. I died because he had NoEd and caught me before I could find hatch. 
---
Sent a ticket and I got the same copy paste response saying, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know how to fix it, sorry!‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm tired of having my BP and pips stolen from me because they won‚Äôt fix the game.
---
lol that is a funny bug, has happened to me a few times
---
Where is my piggy :'(
---
T-bagging is considered toxic because it's basically a survivor mocking the Killer who can't manage to get him. The equivalent would be the Killer easily catching up to the Survivor and hugging him instead of hitting him. 
---
Basically players are toxic when they're mocking the other players that aren't as good as them, at least that's how I see it
---
Jason is part of the franchise, don't expect anything until the lawsuit is finished
---
It's so funny you think your being clever and literally no one is laughing you're just being called pathetic by everyone.
---
It's funny!
---
Perhaps the following concept for a game mode
---
No items can be brought in by survivors, and killers cannot bring addons.
---
Special chests located around the map, same color as normal chests. The chests contain special large key like objects used to open hatches that have a similar appearance to said key (example being a key that drips blood going to a blood stained hatch while an Entity claw as a key goes to the Entity‚Äôs maw hatch).
---
No ‚Äúlast survivor/endgame‚Äù hatch. You need to find a specific key for a specific hatch. The killer can shut opened hatches.
---
Hatches take time to be unlocked with their key, about as much time as a generator. Hatches also have no skillchecks normally.
---
Endgame occurs when one survivor remains.
---
If the last survivor has no key, the endgame timer slows down like when a survivor is downed. It goes at normal speed of the last survivor does have a key.
---
Certain perks would be banned from the game mode (dunno which, I‚Äôm not a master of balance). New perks would exist specifically for this game mode (survivors can see hatch auras within around 3 sideways lockers length as long as they have no key, killers can enhance locks on hatches that require skill-checks to undo, failing results in the survivor becoming hurt or being downed if already hurt.)
---
That's kinda what I'm softly referring to in the last sentence. He's definitely developed a bit of an ego as one of the better players of this game (considering he's red rank at least). I do value his opinions, but I do really dislike how he can be the "end all be all" in his own mind sometimes
---
You know that the goal of any game is to give the players a fun experience right? And if escaping was truly the only thing the matter, more people would just run keys and only do the gens necessary then dip.
---
But the game would be over even faster in some cases. The game doesn't even rank you up for just escaping. You have to engage in other elements of the game.
---
It‚Äôs far from funny. It rewards killers with kills and BP for a kill they didn‚Äôt earn, and shouldn‚Äôt have gotten at all. And it punishes and rob‚Äôs the survivor of BP and often a Pip.
---
It's funny, literally some posts ago you said you were not responding but that salt already got you stuck. I aint gonna let you go nowhere bitch üòò dat ass is mine!
---
I would like a supernatural secondary objective that is mandatory.

Leatherface is part of a franchise, and they got him as a stand alone dlc, so it can happend with jason in chapter 14th... who knows?...
---
Sigh. If you play a killer like Nurse or Spirit, using Noed is just... pathetic, and thats a fricking fact. Against a good nurse/spirit you dont have time to cleanse totems, cause theyre gonna put out a ton of pressure.
---
Nope I'm out right now. I get to quit talking to you and you're stuck with yourself lmao. Enjoy that life of yours must not be so good!
---
That has nothing to do with the self care tho. I seen people just hiding on hook. No self care, no totem cleansing. Just crouching around. Or worse, doing gens oblivious to the killer location and getting caught in 5 seconds because of it.
---
Intriguing explain more plz...
---
Running no mither
---
Send me the hospital bill for that torn up rectum, I need you back salty and tight as ever!!!! üòàüòÑüòÑüòÑüòò
---
I mean sure, i guess if you take this game seriously I guess it isn't funny.
---
As someone who plays primarily Doctor... yeah. You right.
---
If your a good legion feral frenzy almost always guarantees a free hit, after that free hit you get excellent map awareness by the fact that you can see all survivors who are not inflicted with deep wounds in your terror radius. This can create a chain reaction putting everyone in the injured state and having deep wounds. Feral frenzy can be used as an offensive power but mostly it is used to waste the survivors time. If you hit all of them with deep wounds, then they all have to take time to mend themselves which means that they are not doing gens which could secure you a kill before the first gen is done. Legion certainly is not one of the best killers in the game but he is still good and viable if you know what your doing while playing them.
---
did motd have celebrity faces/voices? I guess I didn't remember it because of how plot important those guys were
---
OhTofu is great love his gameplay reviews
---
NieR Adam and Eve vibes
---
I have been playing this game a long time, but not a lot of raw hours. I hope the jump scares never fully fade away. I play it with my 2 daughters and, while we don't play it a ton, it's so much fun when we do.
---
Do you even play this game?
---
Through that logic the killer could just send three people to the 3 gens with 1 gen left and pretty much halt game progress. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair
---
Of course if your a team of good survivors than legion is not a problem as if he misses his feral frenzy hit than he just turns into an M1 killer
---

---
Completely agree!
---
People find the need to brag or complain, despite the fact that a lot of each round‚Äôs outcome is based on luck. 
---
You can be the best pallet looper but if your team isn‚Äôt doing gens then you‚Äôre going to get caught eventually and it will be for nothing. Or you‚Äôre an amazing Huntress/Billy but get put onto Lerys hospital map and it takes away a lot of your power. Or you get unhooked right in front of the killer and then get tunnelled and die 2 mins into the game. And this isn‚Äôt even taking perks into the equation. There are so many factors that can change each match. 
---
But the worst part is people will brag, even when they had a huge advantage. Like a 4 person SWF gen-rushing a newer killer on Fractured Cowshed.  Or an omega-blink nurse saying ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù in post game chat after using an ebony Mori. The community is really in a tough spot right now.
---
Yea I played a pig and ran her all game then we got her again and she brought an ivory and mori‚Äôd and let my friends go. That made me feel good.
---
I don‚Äôt know of many individual perks that can turn a 0k game into a 4K game as killer so unless you can name a perk that‚Äôs stronger :p the strongest perks are hexes because they can be removed from the game, noed and devour hope are just too situational and can be too easily countered by people, but when they work (which noed will activate a lot more than devour hope will) they completely change the dynamic of the game until the perk is cleansed. NOED is powerful, not meta
---
A trapper with doctor now that is a broken build
---
im on pc and its still terrible. I mean not all of us can play at peak hours
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be the first round‚Äù is probably the best advice for newer players who are still learning game basics.

You should make a video about game awareness, I would watch.
---
Bruh it's Monday
---
How much is buying the rights to a likeness anyway?
---
Discord groups, steam groups, if you are low ranks people will love to play with you si≈Ñce you will lower their level and give them more fun, try looking for groups ;)
---
Thank you
---
That's nice, I had about the same experience today. I love nurse for the reason that she's OP for the 5% that can actually use her
---
aww dont be so mean to our baby quentin :( (i know he‚Äôs ugly,,, forgive the devs)
---
Lore.
---
Looks more like the Crapper. Is it that hard to put a mannequin head in the mask to give it shape
---
Ive tried but xbox groups are kinda dead
---
Legion was cool in concept, but they couldn‚Äôt find a way to make him fit into their game. I feel like he was tweaked internally before he first came out, leading him to be sort of a mess.  He‚Äôs the only killer I could say was completely broken while being extremely weak.  
---
I hate his‚Äù rework‚Äù as it only steers him further away from his unique concept.  Now he‚Äôs just a boring M1 killer with probably the lamest ability.  
---
At least he‚Äôs now a pretty accurate portrayal of the character(s) he‚Äôs supposed to represent. He‚Äôs the forgotten stepchild that no one talks about or wants.
---
This is so perfect.
---
As a Killer main I can say Freddy is the most boosted killer to play as, it just isnt fun to play him. Everything is done for you with just his base build.. I just don't like it
---
Because post game chat and in-game chat are totally relate-able, right?
---
If you find yourself cruising through gens, go look for totems.  Go look for the killer and take aggro and see if you can outrun them. Just basic ideas to change the gameplay of what‚Äôs already there
---
That's a new bug related to exhaustion perks I believe. No idea how it triggers tho.
---
I mean a toxic player in post game chat probably has a 100% chances of also being toxic in game chat so, ya know. An asshole's an asshole.
---
It would probably have to do with the entity blocking gen and survivors having to go someplace to do a action to make the entity let go of the gens. I would make it so the survivors have to go to one of 4 alters that appeared on the map and they would have to give up some of their blood to put in the alter and when it's full they can do gens again. 
---
The alter would fill up after it had been used 4 times which means every survivor would have to use a alter once or one survivor can sacrifice blood to a alter multiple times but doing so will have side effects. 
---
If a survivors uses a alter 2 times the gain the hemorrhage status effect even if their healthy.
---
Using it 3 times the survivor will gain the hindered status effect.
---
Using it a third time will injure the survivor for one health state this can down the survivors.
---
oh. ohh. that was oddly triggering for some reason lmao
---
I like that Altar idea, a lot.
---
Personally *(and this will be unpopular)* it always irked me that survivors could bring stuff into the trail with chests already being there with stuff. Wouldn't it make more sense to give survivors an extra Offering slot instead of the item/upgrades to influence the drops and quantity of the chests? Maybe offerings that make sure the first chest you look through has a medkit, flashlight, toolbox or whatever (a little like Quentin's medkit perk).
---
If the entity would block the gens after every repair until a secondary objective was completed the offerings could be used to make that part of the game easier as well. It would put more tactic into this game that is at the moment only a hunt for the gen rushers.
---
\- Also I think all totems whether Hex or Dull should look the same, that way survivors need to cleanse 'em fully in order to be certain they got the hex, but on the upside by needing to do more dull totems they also have a chance to screw over NOED at end game for the killer so it's not all bad for the survivors.
---
P3 Claudette would be rocking a purple flashlight waiting for the Killer to do literally anything.
---
Thanks.. Appreciate the kind works
---
I'm a proud user of Buckle Up.
---
No I understand fun stuff to do with existing stuff but this was just meant to be like fun wacky ideas. Cause pretty much all you can do as a survivor is gens, totems, chests, chase! 
---
For example we said things like: extra time consuming options to gain a 5th perk. Doing something to destroy a gen so survivors can‚Äôt repair it. Being able to support survivors more as teammates with new items.
---
Just weird things to change up the game. I love DBD this is just silly discussion.
---
Spike boots and Thompson's moonshine
---
His name is UPLAYN2
---
I think adding more perks in a single web is the way to go; that way you can just pick the ones you want earlier.
---
use Iron Will
---
Well, the idea was that the entity blocking a gen would stop a survivor on it.
---
We debated if this should trigger a failed skillcheck or not and I think we decided that the survivor would do the animation for failing a skillcheck but there would be no loud noise notification for the killer and no gen regression, the survivor would just not be allowed to continue working on that gen.
---
I truly believe lightborn is better. I've caught so many survivors because they waste their time trying to blind me and I just swing right at them
---
Billy and it‚Äôs not even close. He‚Äôs way easier to counter and doesn‚Äôt really have any mindgame potential. 
---
Spirit has way better gen pressure and mindgame potential. Her add ons are way better too. 
---
At red ranks it‚Äôs not even close to me.
---
I love how you have to to explain yourself for using /s correctly üòÇ
---
I assumed it would work like GF perk that blocks gens in that if they are on the gen it can't be blocked. But if they get off it can
---
Very good read and I totally agree with everything you said.
---
u/primadonnap send this to kenna üòÇ
---
If you‚Äôre the kind of evil demon that leaves those stickers on your TV, you cannot be trusted. It‚Äôs probably a prestige 3 nurse after rank reset. Why are those stickers in your TV????
---
And I love you!
---
thank youu
---
What gets me is when red rank killers use the most optimal perks. It's hard enough playing against a decent Nurse. It's worse when they also run Ruin + BBQ + Sloppy + Nurses. Same goes for Spirit. I'm forced to run Dead hard + Iron Will to even have a chance. Hillbilly with Spirit Fury/Enduring = goodbye pallets. 
---
It gets frustrating when a teammate without Borrowed Time farms you. Now you're slugged and your team is going to sit on gens because the killer is typically near the slugged person. Or when you have teammates that don't run Decisive Strike, then complain about tunneling.
---
I don't like playing SWF. It takes too long to get into lobbies. A lot of them aren't red ranks and a lot of the ones who are, are the most annoying people in the entire Discord.
---
I hate that I love this game.
---
1) At a decent rank, most part of the time, Noed just make a 0k game into a 1k game or 2 if you are lucky and the team is not the best.
---
2) Noed is not meta because is not the strongest perk like you try to say. Enduring, spirit fury, BBQ, ruin, are much better. They are all perks that gives a continue value to the killer. Noed is just a last desperate try for bad killers to get another sacrifice. A good killer doesn't base his game build on the last 2 min of the match.
---
Eh I actually like legions current power that said it‚Äôs not super useful for securing hooks he‚Äôs basically an m1 killer with some stalling power and tracking built in. I just wish they made his add ins didn‚Äôt suck.
---
This would be completely broken with 3 gens done. You could literally just sit at the last one and there‚Äôs nothing the survivors could do.
---
I'd say there are more survivors crying about OP killer perks and camping. Or if you mean posts like from that guy that was told to kill his family meanwhile playing against much higher ranked players, yeah that's complaining I'm completely fine with.
---
So funny how everyone thought that they'd ***only*** face Freddy's following the rework. We had maybe 3 days max of everyone using Freddy after the rework dropped on the live servers
---
I actually find billy a lot more frustrating, as small mistake cost you a lot more, than making a mistake againts spirit.
---
And spirit fury Billy is complete bullshit, just an easy down for him.
---
I actually have fun versing spirit, I play her myself quite a bit, so I know how to mindgame the mindgamer. It's mindgames on top of mindgames. I see most people don't know how to verse her and go down in seconds, so I get why they hate her a lot more.
---
That‚Äôs why I changed the design further down for there to be 2 gens available when 3 gens are done. The initial design seemed way too oppressive.
---
Then when there‚Äôs 4 gens complete the killer has to choose to either defend their last gen, or defend their totem. (Cleansing the totem releases all trapped gens)
---
It definitely does at first, but once you get used to it it allows you to know where people are while phased from a much greater distance.
---
You can just tell usually. Whether it's them clearly never looking backwards or being very static when crouching and hiding in certain areas.
---
Boooooo a pig with Noed. 
---
(I‚Äôm a rank 4 pig main)
---
The thing is though, that happens usually due to the other player just being flat out better. This is a result of specific game mechanics. Things like god pallets, end of game scenarios where survivors know they can't die, specific killers being unable to do certain things. I will never get upset at a sweet juke or smart pathing play by a survivor since they did a good job and I often let survivors that do smart line of sight jukes or vault/locker plays escape at the end of the game, but its the situations when you are absolutely, completely 100% powerless as a killer AND the survivor knows it, that's when it's frustrating. 
---
On the flipside, its the same or even worse with facecamping or hard tunneling with a mori. The survivor is powerless past the first hook and they don't get to play the game, which in some sense is why killers being toxic is even more frustrating. A toxic survivor makes the game very frustrating for killers since the killer feels like they can't play the game, but a facecamping killer makes it so the survivor literally cannot play the game.
---
That being said, facecamping is punished to a small extent by the game giving you garbage points and not ranking up, whereas survivor toxicity has virtually zero risk outside of some unexpected perks catching BM survivors off guard (Mad Grit, Save the Best for Last stacks, some random addons)
---
Correct but in-game would be worse, if not a waste of time. If you have the option to disable it, I'd say the majority of survivors are going to have it disabled.
---
There would be too many people raging in chat instead of playing the game.
---
I would! I play Pig alot so I could crouch with you all :)
---
looks to me like someone spotted it with a map, key, or some other aura reading. i've had this sort of effect with things like that.
---
Either they weren't asleep or they just ran around it, the hitbox doesn't extend beyond the red puddle.
---
Naw I was just saying that because people look at my tag and then shun me as a toxic survivor some shit
---
I also don‚Äôt like the reputation pigs get for running Noed just because they aren‚Äôt good enough to run others
---
&gt;implying rank 20s know this
---
What system do you play on?
---
A mega hex totem in the basement. Until you destroy it the only thing you get from chests is brown toolboxes
---
Recover, don't crawl. You could have recovered fully and someone would have picked you up.
---
Honestly really glad lmao
---
The same happened to me on ps4 a few weeks ago.
---
Wasn't aware that was a thing
---
Are you an adult? Are you capable of making decisions? Taking responsibility for your own actions? Dealing with the consequences of your actions?
---
You come here upset because you bought a product that you did zero research on. You basically bought an automatic transmission vehicle and are pissed it doesn't have manual transmission, "cause that's how cars are supposed to be driven." 
---
Take some fucking responsibility for your actions. No one forced this on you. You did this to yourself. You could have either bought a PC so you could use kb+m or done 30 seconds of googling to figure out that you can't use kb+m on console. Being ignorant doesn't make you the victim.
---
...1?
---
\&gt;Meta perks
---
\&gt;Perks that literally every rank 1-5 uses
---
"Lol bad perks"
---
 Can some one explain being toxic to me I know hook camping is a big no no but other then that what is toxic?
---
Never experience that cause I'm mainly a red rank killer but that sounds terrifying lmao
---
That¬¥s both a perk balance and killer balance problem. Low tier killers rely on perks like Ruin to even have a decent chance at winning, so BHVR is afraid to touch it. At the same time it massively overshoots on high tier killers. Perk and killer balance are, along with reworking progression and ranking, amont the top things I¬¥d like to be looked at. Honestly I don¬¥t want any new killers or survivors. If you¬¥re talking about maps, keep them coming all day, but as long as what we have is not balanced decently, I don¬¥t want new content, which will only worsen the mess.
---
I did have one GOOD game and only one, though. The Survivors, like, actually hid and did things other than loop and teabag, and were cool in chat.
---
That's probably not happening again.
---
Ooo yeah! That could benefit killers and survivors because survivors would have to waste time to do it but they would get a positive reward!
---
You mean Windows 95? Or did they come out with a sequel?
---
The point is that in a PVP game if something requires more skill doesnt automatically mean there should be such an advantage for that player compared to another. In PVP, ideally, it should solely be the skill of the players that dictate who wins the game, not the character they choose. A good nurse with the best add ons and perks in the game will probably not lose, disregarding factors such as luck. Sure, they spent hours honing their skills on the character, but who's to say the survivor on the other side didn't spend 10x as much time, but cannot elevate their game more because of the nature of survivor gameplay design. Nurse basically ignores that fundamental gameplay design. As the saying goes, "Nurse doesn't play dead by daylight." I am speaking as a former Nurse player on console.
---
all these comments acting like no one will ever heal them are so weird. people are fucking desperate to heal me, no matter what, even if i don't want it
---
What makes even more sense is how one of the foxes was killed shortly afterwards
---
I play on PC
---
no
---
I don't think anyone deserves to get camped, but okay.
---
Why spread the scratch marks? Any decent Spirit follow a injured survivor by their moaning, not scratch marks
---
Maybe something like a normal gamemode would help, for all those who dont want to tryhard and climb a ladder.
---
So that they can have more fun games in which they can test things out etc.
---
Nooooo.y bf has hijacked my pc for league so I stay on Xbox :(
---
Maybe again in another life friend. Or ya know, we get a desktop and he gives me my ASUS back
---
I said bad perks to use against a rank 20 killer because you will not need DS, adrenaline or Dead hard. If you're rank one and you go down to a rank 20 killer then something is wrong
---
Amen!
---
Maybe they had it done up back than and since they couldnt use it was just laying around so they used it on legion
---
Lightweight, Distorsion, Dance With Me, Poised.
---
I use it to as a spirit main but it fucks you up more than anything. People sound super close and it makes you exit your phase way to early.
---
What is the point of playing like that I don‚Äôt understand
---
Less Efficient, yes, is it quicker, no.
---
With how the game works, it's not harmful by any means to split gen progression ( losing efficiency) and even then, Prove Thyself exist?
---
It'll come with servers
---
has anybody else noticed that the fast vault momentum has been broken?
---
I have them all.
---
Legion is a really big farming killer, because his power not only gives you 300 brutality points for the hit, but also 250 for deep would. If you hit a second surv, 250 for deviousness, 100 again for deviousness (marked hit) and 300 again for brutality. Hit all 4, let them mend, repeat. I use BBq, thanatophobia, nurse‚Äôs and discordance (pretty op, I know, but you gotta do what you gotta do for BP)
---
Clown is a very good and fun killer, and pop is now really good for the new Freddy if you have him.
---
Plauge is also funny to use,  but you have to keep in minf that her puke, for some reason, is decentred, you have to aim a lil bit to the left to hit them. Her perks are kinda good, not the best, but good in some builds. 
---
Hope i helped you out!
---
Don‚Äôt have pgtw or bbq so what could I replace them with
---
Did but now doesn't
---
ahve been outplayed lads must be snoipen meh I never play poorleh it's always snoipahs
---
Exactly. My idea is for the map to be like the earth, so not flat.
---
But if everyone readied we wouldn't have such classics as "that guy who leaves when the timer almost finished counting down"
---
What‚Äôs PGTW?
---
Honestly perks aren't even the real problem, the killers are.
---
Killer's like Nurse are known to be difficult to learn/play, so you never really see them in low ranks. In red ranks, they're every other game and nearly impossible to beat.
---
Killer's like Doctor are known to dominate low ranks. I remember an article a couple years ago saying the Doctor was OP! In red ranks, I let out a sigh of relief when I see Doctor (except for small maps.. oof..)
---
I'm in the same boat as you though. I don't want anything new anymore. Maps are always great. I just want more balance. Freddy rework was fantastic. I think he's in a great spot. A good Freddy can dominate you, but it isn't impossible. Then we have killers like Trapper and Wraith who were buffed but still nearly impossible to play in high ranks.
---
Oh I know but figured I would be a smart ass and throw in my 2 cents on what I would have sent back!
---
I see nothing in the change log that indicates this
---
You can't argue logic with these idiots. I've said and posted this same thing many times and every single time floods of assclowns come in and say it's better to cleanse. Why? Idk. Possibly because they can't loop for shit anyways so it makes no difference to them if they get spit on from over a simple loop or through a window and over a pallet. These are also the same people who are stuck at rank 17 and think anyone with a half functioning bain are "godly" at this game.
---
So you mean ‚Äúspherical‚Äù?
---
Ive had it on ps4 a handful of times.
---
as someone who plays a decent amount of Plag, erm, yes, this is accurate. Please always cleanse
---
Damn EGC bug
---
Pop goes the weasel

its a joke, im well aware that you shouldnt cleanse right
---
Uh, thanks
---
Perks that let u know what‚Äôs going on around gens or that give you something to do when u get there. The only exception I can think of is bitter murmur as he can‚Äôt port to completed Gen. tinkerer off of billy isn‚Äôt a bad choice imo. Fits both criteria.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cpdvzc/could_we_start_getting_more_pallet_swap_recolours/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Other people: uses eac bypass and cheatengine to give themselves bloodpoints.    This guy on reddit: "cursed images time"
---
So pretty much most people say Billy.
---
I wanna add that going down vs a Billy chainsaw feels alot more like you actually fucked up and deserve to die as opposed to the constant 3-sided coinflip with spirit and the braindead chase that comes after she hit you once and even the unstoppable tunneling that comes after it.   
---
Basically I don't like being downed by a stupid boosted spiritmains and don't feel like they deserve it, I also suspect these to be the people who constantly cry that other killers are too weak, not realizing that spirit is actually too strong, they just suck and other killers are fine and spirit should be tuned to their level not the other way around.
---
So you lose all your bloodpoints out of spite? Just smack people out of the gate.
---
maybe he's using spine chill AND get killed in 10s ?
---
Losing 2 extra rank pips instead of getting 0 and nearly no bloodpoints is probably worth more bloodpoints in the future.
---
No DLC killers?  
---
Do you have any teachables from the shrine unlocked yet, like BBQ and chili, Ruin or Pop Goes the Weasel?  If not, buy and grind leather face until you get BBQ, it'll make the grind of the game a lot faster and easier if you play killer.  
---
I run BBQ, Ruin, Pop Goes the Weasel, and then either Franklin's Demise or Spirit Fury.  I use a dream pallet add on and then usually swing chains or nancy's masterpiece.
---
Nah I‚Äôve only had the game a couple months

I had the same thing and I was able to walk through the whole end and even fell of the cliff and glitched back the whole time. Wasnt even able to end the game ffs.

why is everyone so mad here, make one joke and everyone loses there shit and calls you an idiot.

This is the first time hearing ‚Äújennifer‚Äôs body is the better movie‚Äù and I love that.
---
Jennifer Check killer when?
---
Because it's almost worthless? Unless you playing swf and doing hatch game, what else are you going to use map for? To find a gen?
---
"Lol why run Spine Chill if you don't even run"
---
Maybe. I'm not sure what their situation is but damn I love that perk.
---
I wish more people would realize this. It is MUCH better to be broken all game than it is being able to be sniped by vommy mommy during the later game.
---
My friend (who I talked him to buy this game). Also got deja vu as his first lv 3 perk. I don't know the stat but I'm pretty sure that most new player got deja vu as their first full perk. Kinda like "deja vu" you know
---
Your methods of counting the time were either not precise or just done plain wrong
---
*Hard Inhale* Rhheeeaa Rhheeaa!
---
True greatness requires sacrifice
---
Was afk watching yt 80% of the time lol just wanted to report him post  game
---
I, as a killer main, whole heartily agree with that statement.
---
What do you mean
---
me and bill where doing the gen in the building and kate ran up there like an idiot
---
I didn‚Äôt realize August was the only month with a 23rd day.
---
They are generally weak. They are not bad for new players, but once you learn a map you'll remember how to get back to a gen if you find one. Unless you're running add-ons that reveal to everyone and include finding the hatch they are only good for a little bit of extra BP.
---
Teabagging will only ever upset you when you're being outplayed...
---
There‚Äôs tunneling, going after one survivor and ignoring other survivors. There‚Äôs t bagging, which is toxic bc the survivor is basically saying ‚Äúyou suck‚Äù bc you can‚Äôt catch them. There‚Äôs gen rushing which makes the match over in 3 minutes, not allowing the killer enough time to get enough hooks or sacrifice many people. Gen rushing is often used with toolboxes to make the game even faster. Insta heals are considered toxic bc it gives the survivor another chance in a chase. Many survivor and killer perks are considered to be toxic, Noed, DS, Dead hard, Ruin, Adrenaline, etc.
---
Can I get some tips for playing Plague? Got to rank 5 playing mostly Pig but I'm struggling with Plag.
---
i do too but why have them cleanse when they can be broken, because they fear cleansing, but bring in some apples or the iridescent seal and then they are broken and you can vomit on them
---
These perks work pretty well with him:
---
PGTW
---
Ruin
---
BBQ &amp; Chili
---
Thrilling Tremors
---
Make Your Choice
---
Brutal Strength
---
Maybe he test it when dead hard was bugged a week ago?
---
Ikr
---
yes
---
This makes me doubt some of the player base, execute BT well and you saved everyone. That‚Äôs why I now run DS in its place.
---
What type of perks do you got unlocked so far?
---
Myers because he has dying light and then leather face for his perk barbecue and chili.
---
A while back devs introduced measures to ensure that fast vaulting keeps your running momentum - previous to that if you fast vaulted you lost your running momentum.
---
It worked really well and stopped a lot of bs hits
---
About 2 patches ago it stopped working and fast vault hits increased a lot
---
It's the month that comes before September
---
What‚Äôs STBFL ?
---
Thanks, im pretty new and don‚Äôt know all the perks yet
---
He could be a good unarmed killer. But i cant think of a power for him.
---
Flashlight blinding as in when they break a pallet, vault a window or get stunned? Because otherwise that isnt rank one or its some other person playing on a seperate account.
---
Killer uses ebony mori, camps, says gg ez.
---
Me, wow camping with ebony mori on spirit, ez indeed.
---
Killer: LOL SAYS THE DS-USER (post DS-nerf.)
---
Killers are really just the dumbest people on the planet and they'll bitch about anything to justify their own shit.
---
I am rank 7 on console and I play with my rank 20 friends who just got into the game and I always die so they can survive. I maintain the chase through out the whole game.
---
Its a guaranteed pip if I do some totems and help with one gen at least.
---
I dont use adrenaline or ds tho. still fun to fuck with low level killers.
---
chase someone else?
---
patrol your gens?
---
Me when I pip. I hate red ranks.
---
It‚Äôs confusing to me. Sorry not everyone can read your mind and know what you‚Äôre talking about when you say numbers
---
It was permanent and nobody had map that game.
---
There ain't as many survivors playing these days and that is why it is harder for the game to match up.
---
I checked a few days ago the lobbys of killers and survivors waiting and I think it was 50 killers to 120 survivors waiting. And since the game just randomly picks killers based on rank also it is a uphill battle to find a lobby as a killer.
---
That sucks, it used to happen, I swear.
---
Its not locked 60 fps
---
Save the best for last, myers teachable
---
When you‚Äôre the last one alive and the killer knows you have decisive strike so he waits 90 seconds while you‚Äôre on the floor.
---
Lol you get downvoted but thats the truth ive played both extensively.
---
Mad Grit = Great perk..... LMAOOOO
---
Sounds like we need another 100 days of memes.
---
I‚Äôve got nurse, hag, legion and huntress teachable‚Äôs so far
---
Here's a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfLzqVNzVE) showing you how to download and install my custom icon pack :)
---
Streetwise is a great perk if you build for it....
---
I should at least be able to down the survivor... it's literally a god mode move for 60 seconds.
---
also, can someone explain what a medium vault actually does? the other day I was playing against a killer who I was doing well against and they moonwalked around a corner to attack me but I was able to spin out of it so they whiffed then immediately vaulted a window, which had to be a medium vault, and even with the missed attack cooldown they were able to hit me through the window. I feel like i objectively outplayed them and was punished for it because medium vaults don't do anything it seems like
---
Not gonna lie when people save me in killer terror radius WITHOUT BORROWED TIME!!!! I lose my shit especially if I get knock down again right after or if they don‚Äôt take a hit.
---
Just started playing in June. Can confirm
---
I say make it so you can open the hatch again but make it have a long timer.
---
If I run into four Survivors running Sprint Burst, complaining is the last thing I'd do.
---
As I say, it's context.
---
The guy was talking about August, so it's not a massive leap in logic to understand what "The 23rd" is referring to.
---
if your momentum is dependent on you downing someone who has DS active then you're not playing well. full stop. i usually just take the DS and still get at least 3Ks in most of my killer matches and I play red ranks as killer
---
Perks i've been experimenting with for a stealth build are distortion, spine chill to know when the killers coming, urban evasion for staying out of sight easily, iron will.
---
I like the idea of no scratch marks but I feel like without good intel and other 'tracking' bases covered, you could easily run into the killer or be found.
---
Tfw your meme gets reposted
---
When you finally find the Nea that has been locker hopping to avoid your terror radius
---
i mean for like meme builds, which is why i said depending on play style. the youtuber hybridpanda has a ‚Äòfruit ninja‚Äô meme build using mad grit, agitation and iron grasp and it‚Äôs super fun
---
LMAO
---
Stop leveling your killers and survivors and use all of your blood points on leatherface.  You need to unlock barbeque and chili as a teachable so it can show up in other killers' bloodwebs.  Each time you hook a survivor for the first time in a round you gain 25% more experience for the match at the end screen.  
---
So assuming you just try to hook everyone atleast once you should be getting twice as much blood points every game.
---
I take the ds every time. And i still get 3ks.
---
Still doesn't mean it doesn't destroy my momentum and there is nothing i can do anymore to counter it.
---
Using items, meta perks, or spamming crouch to teabag. Also gen rushing (Doing the objective to quickly).
---
Yeah but that costs more money so maybe one day
---
if you play on xbox, they can get gamepass for 3 years for a dollar and download the game through there. can't beat a dollar purchase.
---
Their chainsaws sound different.
---
‚ÄúNow this is where the game *REALLY* opens up.‚Äù

It's all fun and games with the yellow-aproned menace until he decides to run Play With Your Food.
---
Well without Iron Will it's like escaping from any other killer by using the Terrain to your advantage, while the impact of facing her along with mindgames at Pallets and Windows and predicting what she will do with Iron Will is vastly different and much easier, that can also be said the same for The Nurse or even the perk Quick and Quiet because if she hears you vault she knows where you're going.
---
Look I know she's unfun, and honestly prayer beads Spirit is the only thing in the game I DC against and I find Trapper to be much more unfun than normal Spirit. She's still behind The Nurse in effectiveness and is at the mercy of the terrain more than her.
---
Just as an FYI, terrain/a known route as well as mindgames is used against Spirit, but with Iron Will it's just infinitely easier to lose her.
---
We need this so much!
---
Camping honestly seems a dick move, But if it's not a rank 16 - 20 then it's a strategy.
---
And men of culture all know what's gonna happen to the other one.
---
(Also üçâ in the chat for Bengt and Oxen)
---
Prep your shit before you come into the lobby. Survivor queue times are horrendous, you have all the time in the world to get your shit together. It's basic courtesy. What, are you waiting to see what the other survivors bring? That doesn't take a full minute of fiddling with menus. Also, just bring whatever you want, who cares what everyone else has. You're just gonna get slapped with Franklin's and have to either find it or go basement raiding to get a replacement anyway.
---
I bet the people who don't prep before they queue are the kinds of people who stand in front of vending machines clicking their tongues and slowly moving their finger along the rows as they see what it has to offer despite knowing god damn good and well prior to sauntering up that they want some Peanut M&amp;Ms and a bottle of Veryfine.
---
okay so you're complaining for no reason
---
Exactly. DS is like a pallet. Once they use it, it's gone and broken.
---
Dont respect the pallet. Lean into it.
---
nice!
---
How was your experience in purple rank hell?
---
Myers gonna get some fish
---
Yeah. Hard to hear over gens sometimes though
---
thanks!
---
The Legion.
---
Then you're just as scummy as then. You're just encouraging that survivor to be an asshole next game too. I mean I get it. Players like that can be infuriating, but it's a vicious cycle.
---
Never heard of Dead Hard being called toxic, and its kinda hard to justify calling Ruin toxic. 
---
Those people just haven't encountered Dying Light as an obsession
---
New bond buff?
---
Also I'm guessing you sort by new we appreciate the sacrifice
---
What‚Äôs the rate of regression of a kicked generator?
---
It is, survivors used to be op but after all the nerfs it makes sense for people to be less likely to play survivor. Especialy for solo players. The killer que times didden't get big suddenly after a patch.
---
Oh you're taking everything and pointing it at my character.
---
Now you're assuming things.
---
Never complained about getting 4ks or even kills.
---
I'm saying the god mode in locker doesn't feel fleshed out and it's really powerful in rank 1 matches.
---
I think you did a ...
---
Would have been impressive but it‚Äôs only pc lmao
---
Getting a bunch of randoms to work together is easier said than done. Most of the time they don‚Äôt join chat invites, survivors want to do things their way, some survivors will run around like an idiot and lead the killer right to you.
---
Aren't all Killers members of The Hookers?
---
Ight, so I suggest Ruin, Sloppy, Discordance and Nurses calling, and in the future if you have any spare cash to burn, get Leatherface for BBQ. Also be on the look out for PGTW and Surveillance in the Shrine down the road or just buy Clown and Pig if you have the money for them.
---
What's a bad time to use it?
---
Is it possible to make a Plague wearing a huntress mask (hound, or cat if hound can't be done) , her fancy red sea goat god robes and the Huntress's blight axe?
---
I‚Äôve run into players (who are playing the killer) and they‚Äôll disconnect if we‚Äôre about to win. Had that happen some many times.
---
I tried haha
---
It's like 5 bucks to make every game you play after that twice as effective for getting bloodpoints to level up.
---
It's literally the best killer perk in the game because it cuts down the amount of time you have to grind to level up your killers.  Plus the sooner you get it unlocked the higher a chance you have of finding it in your killer bloodwebs for the rest of them.
---
Me It is just the wraith has windstrom oh shit oh shit oh shit
---
Killer: Christopher Walkin as Gabriel from the Prophecy and The Headless Horseman from Sleepy Hollow
---
Survivor: David Tennant as The Doctor
---
Are they introducing a lobby system? + if so is that just a gateway to cross console play?
---
u/Title2ImageBot
---
It is, all I hear is ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a pig without Noed?‚Äù At least on Xbox it‚Äôs quite true because I never play pigs who don‚Äôt have Noed
---
&gt; Never complained about getting 4ks or even kills.
---
If you're always getting 3Ks while taking DS and complaining about losing momentum because of DS then yes you are tacitly whining that you're not getting 4Ks
---
&gt; I'm saying the god mode in locker doesn't feel fleshed out and it's really powerful in rank 1 matches.
---
clearly not since you're still killing almost everyone
---
like god forbid people use their perks intelligently. this is like whining that freddy teleports to gens then Pop's them killing all your momentum
---
My sleep paralysis demon
---
Go ahead and screenshot your rank 1 killer with ghostface in the list and your username on reddit. Then I'll take you seriously.
---
If you can't do that then I'm sorry but i won't be replying to you.
---
Mr Jefferson skin for Ghostface
---
Np, I couldn't stress enough that you should play some killer. You'll get stomped on but you'll seriously learn so quick how to loop/hide by watching what they do
---
You're gonna have to explain whatever tangent you are trying to go off on better?
---
You should never let teabagging in a game upset you. Sone of this community is ridiculous when it comes to being offended by it.
---
Who is Al boyo

no?

Solo survivor

Killer

Swf

Can I have this template?
---
See I was expecting to see like spirit or something but I'm happily surprised by the result. Thank you for the chuckle. Lol
---
I think solo survivor is harder than killer but killer is harder than swf
---
he's a fairly well known streamer. Friends with Edgar. Extremely good survivor player
---
What are your primary perk builds on Legion?
---
Yeah it should go towards survival, that category is hard to cap in &amp; it‚Äôs not happening unless you escape. Even then, escaping is only 5k
---
Every now and then I get the opening to hunt it down with Small Game, but that's not always possible. haha
---
Yes please! Waifu UwU
---
Would you be interested in playing together sometime? My GT is ScaryWolf00
---
I'm glad you didn't murder me, to be honest.
---
Play killer and survivor. Playing killer will show you what weaknesses they have first hand and you will see good survivors strategies and bad survivors strategies. Using third person to know where the killer is and loop them is a must. Use an exhaustion perk
---
So the killer has no glaring or inherent weaknesses in their kit, and that makes them boosted? Weird flex.
---
You know, while RZ's Halloween wasn't as good as the original, it wasn't that bad.
---
Laurie was probably my favorite part of that movie.
---
If you‚Äôre the Doctor maybe lol.
---
Yeah, you can especially punish with one of her add on's that reveal survivors auras when they puke. Maybe make that a mechanic?
---
it works but im doing fat myers next
---
how
---
watch streamers and youtubers. see how they play and try and learn from it. def has helped me! im still a bot but a lot better than what i was before.
---
Why do this when you can get banned for it?
---
Billy. Fuck spirit, super unfun to play against (fun as hell to play though)
---
When Wraith is cloaked, essentially his whole body becomes vulnerable to a flashlight, even while he is uncloaking.
---
Ash was a licensed Chapter, as was Ghostface. So we should have two more coming before a new character
---
Nice idea. I feel like currently that would be easy enough for one survivor to just take all the hits... unless these would stay with them all game
---
Shrine resets soon. Hope and pray for PGTW or Make your choice
---
ü§î
---
No, and BHVR even specifically mentioned this on stream back when the vaulting patch hit in January. They said they may consider giving Resilience and Spine Chill the ability to speed up vaults again at some point but since then we've heard nothing else on the issue.
---
This creates an internal battle with myself like "should I finish this gen so the other two can escape or help that poor sap on the hook and possibly cause the last gen to not be completed and we all lose" especially if we 3 - genned ourselves. Lol
---
No problem
---
4 seconds of regression = 1 second of repairs
---
You have fun playing against spirit, wtf
---
Yes of course, Fat Myers is of utmost necessity. I understand completely.
---
Both the Devs and EAC have said they won't ban for this, so why not do this when both have said you won't get banned for it?
---
I wish that worked. I don't run detection perks anymore its, fairly easy to deal with after an alotted time.
---
But getting hit with it multiple times in a match, match after match creating what was a win condition into a stalemate at the very least for a whole minute, forcing me to have to leave a survivor at a gen up and not disabled in anyway feels bad knowing that i can't counter the meta.
---
This is furthering the gap between non traversal killers.
---
The only good one ive done against it is trapper and placing it just outside the locker. But trapper can't keep up. Unless you're running a full chase build and the wire comes thin.
---
It depends on the survivor/killer, dead hard can be toxic if they dead hard to a pallet that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to make and extend the chase. I don‚Äôt see these two perks being toxic by some survivors/killers do.
---
Rank is fucked regardless if you dropped purposely or not, with rank reset and whatnot. They are stupid if they thought you had 3 blinks.
---
Cheers. Yikes, is it just me or does that seem a bit too slow? Maybe not when there‚Äôs only a couple gens left but I feel right at the start of the game it should be 1:1.
---
3 blinks with no addons, obvious hacker.
---
do you have a link to the stream? this has been a source of confusion for me because I see people say this but i've never had a primary source. also this is the first i heard that resilience doesn't affect it either :/
---
Im sorry this happened OP.

Nah, Doctor gets points easily only on deviousness. Legion gets easy points in brutality and hunting.

Cant blame them for feeling like no ones doing anything, but they probably aren't the super strong carrier they might think they are being.
---
Billy. You can hard-counter Spirit with perks. Billy isn't as simple.
---
Actually, yes.  It usually happens when the killer is heading right toward me after I've been unhooked.
---
They don‚Äôt wanna be complicated, they just don‚Äôt want valve to rip them off.
---
Steam also brings nothing special, valve has been riding off the fact they were first for like the past 6 years while doing nothing.

Those statistics are pretty much meaningless, since they *perhaps* do not take many factors into account. Solo survivor to swf(since solo survivor is weaker than killer, and it is more common than 4 man swf), super strong add ons the killer brought like iri head or prayer beads, ebony moris, or just the simple fact that a lot of survivors try to save their teammates, even if they are getting facecamped (because they want to have fun) which will eventually cause the killer to win(because no one is doing gens), even though they are not playing optimally. Drawing a bunch of statistics without taking in very important factors, especially in an asymmetric game like dbd makes the statistics very inaccurate and misleading.

Just stay injured and focus on gens.
---
The problem with self-care is that people feel the need to constantly heal themselves throughout the game, which results in time wasted that could have been done doing gens.
---
yeah it‚Äôs nice, sadly xbox doesnt give an achievement for it.
---
LOL
---
Its just people having fun on a video game. Don't be a little bitch about it. Its self sabotage.
---
I swear people take it more personally on dvd than anything else because the killer is 1v4 and feels lonely. 
---
Truth is the killer gets angry when he gets beat. Hell, killers get angry when being looped or hit by pallets and make a point of focussing you. 
---
Killers and survivors can both be toxic and need to lighten up. But teabagging is not the issue here.
---
üëçüèº
---
That's about where I am.
---
Also, the game is significantly different from the time I enjoyed it most.
---
Both due to balance changes and the community learning and being more in tuned with what the meta is.
---
Okay play another game lol
---
You‚Äôre literally spending a perk slot to stand and be useless to your team when you could just do a gen injured or bring a medkit and heal faster. 
---
It‚Äôs a scrub trap perk that‚Äôs only good if you‚Äôre really bad at looping.
---
Oof here's that guy in the post game who thinks getting downed twice means he got tunneled.
---
Exactly lol when I first played spirit I was awful lol but some time made her more fun and made me realize ways to actually face her, judging from what other survivors were doing. I think people forget the point of the game. It's mostly about just having fun and what's more fun than looking at this spirit as they look at you while both of you are playing your own little mind games. It makes for some very intense and fun moments. The game isn't just about winning, it's about having a good time! I would consider myself a pretty bad killer and survivor but I just have a lot of fun doing both lol.
---
Had a killer dc after we got 4 gens done and I escaped him in a chase. I messaged him (I know I know) just to say ‚Äúreally?‚Äù 
---
They responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm dcing to derank so I can try new killers‚Äù
---
#1)bullshit
---
#2)bullshit
---
#3)thanks for wasting 10 minutes of my time and my offering all so I could get 0 F*ING BLOODPOINTS.
---
I don‚Äôt often talk shit about the devs, they work very hard, they made a game that I genuinely enjoy and consistently update the game.....but how...I mean who thought it was ok to give 5k points per Survivor that dc‚Äôs and 0 if a killer dc‚Äôs. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand the thinking.
---
No
---
Killers have far more than 3 viable killers. You dont have to play spirit. You can also play hag, huntress. Plague, dr. You arent supposed to 4k every game like spirit does. If you can 2k every game, congrats, you're viable. Heck I mained Myers way before all these nice surv nerds you have now. Most killer mains are just spoiled bc they have s tier killers at all.
---
It‚Äôll be Nea obviously
---
Because you can just bring a medkit and do the same thing or a toolbox and work on a gen injured. Both are more efficient than healing yourself for 30 seconds. 
---
Low B teir perk at best
---
Now that's my first P3!
---
Ace would just be two face. 
---
‚ÄúTonight the dice decide who lives and who dies‚Äù
---
You're looking at it backwards.
---
Killers couldn't get the job done at certain ranks, and rather than just accepting that they're not meant to be at that rank, they cried on here and the steam forums until BHVR's hand was forced and bloodlust was released to ensure that if a killer is unskilled, they can just cheese to bloodlust 3 and get a free hit.
---
I want my friends to learn and killers too have to learn. After the games I always send them tips on how to play better.
---
I still end up dying so I dont understand why I am an asshole?
---
Awesome! Gg
---
A Nurse that runs Ruin is funnier :)
---
Would you like to speak to the OP about it, Karen?
---
As killer I can just play spirit and have the win handed to me almost every game. I wish my survivor had that privilege.
---
I‚Äôm sitting here about to play him for the first time since the update. I have no idea what to expect.
---
I think so too so yeah. Not my fault the game is unbalanced in matchmaking and that my friends are low ranks. Even if I was low rank I would still end up being a smurf.
---
but it was *never* in the perk description though. Literally ever. A number of perks have effects not listed
---
and if someone could actually source me the stream and time mark that would be great
---
Oh nice! That would be fun to watch you play some Freddy! I've yet to try him. I typically play Hag or Spirit lol
---
I've had this happen all fucking weekend. I had a match where I had 8,000 in altruism and objectives, 6,000 in boldness, and just about 1000 in the survival category, and depipped. Makes absolutely zero sense.
---
Medium vault is a slower fast vault. If you aren't sprinting directly at the window, you will medium vault, or if you are under the effects of Dream Snares or Clown's After-piece Tonic. Basically, if you are at the vault and simply hold the run button, then vault, you will medium vault. You only will fast vault if you are essentially running at a straight line towards the window when you vault.
---
With pallets however, you will always fast vault when holding the run button, as there are no medium pallet vaults.
---
Many of you have most likely done this many times, I just got the game in June so I'm rather pleased by this
---
When you see your fellow survivor go from healthy to morie'd after hearing Myers music
---
Only met a few who had it despite their skill
---
Oh ok whenever you want
---
Once I see a killer who‚Äôs quite bad I‚Äôm like ‚Äúaight boys, slow the gens, let‚Äôs find these totems.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve reported it via ticket every time I happens. And each time I‚Äôm told ‚Äúwe are aware of the issue and out team is currently working around the clock to fix it as soon as possible. Unfortunately we do not have a solution for this as of this moment.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs the same copy paste answer every time. And like I said it happens to me a lot now.
---
Discordance from the plague is really good on him
---
God I love playing freddy
---
Only time I think they are useful for is when you use Rainbow map with double Stamp addons, or normal map with Red Twine and a Stamp, because this lets you track totems in a large range, so you can run around the map a bit, or after a chase, and see where the totems are at.
---
As a hillbilly main, I‚Äôm a bit sad
---
No, I get all that. My question, distilled, is: what is the point? What function does it serve if it's so unsafe?
---
If you want to talk about how the gameplay is designed, it has been said multiple times that the game wasn't originally designed to have comms as a factor but now since that is a thing, survivor teams get 10 times stronger because of it. Same with nurse. She isnt going to get looped for 40 minutes like other killers do. Also what? Why shouldn't dedication result in advantages? I get nurse is a bit different but still nurse isnt pick up and play. Why dedicate time to anything to gain skill then? Why not slap noed, ebony mori, rancor, tuft of hair, and more strong perks and add ons and get win after win?
---
Yeah I try and mess around with different perks to see what I can come up with. It's a lot of fun! I lose a lot but it makes it interesting haha
---
üçâüçâüçâüçâ
---
Lets be real, all killers get lost in the corn
---
The heck happened? Why did I get downvoted so much, did I say something wrong?
---
And the worse is that if you want to play doh, you must also have ruin to make the game long enough to devour to activate, but while they seek for ruin the will also find doh
---
Good job! I hit rank 6 yesterday....that's the highest I've been so far! Congrats on getting there!!!!!
---
They were broken upon realease, and players played them in an unintended way. They removed that option, and many people still quite like them.
---
But what perks you running
---
I bet your wearing a chicken hat and a orange jacket and speak with tapes
---
It‚Äôs odd they used Quentin when he isn‚Äôt the main character of TNOES. Is it from gender ratio balancing?
---
As if this has any bearing on the discussion at hand.
---
Stay on point and target the argument, not the person behind it.
---
If by not having fun you mean losing, nah
---
I can still have fun even if I get swamped by the survivors
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cozexk/quick_translation_learn_to_play_without_the/

There are of course many who put low ranks in their SWF to get an easy killer to bully, but what if you just wanna chill and play with your friend, who is a higher/lower rank
---
Uno reverse card
---
When that goes into trash talk in the chat it becomes an issue. It‚Äôs one thing to be a good sport. It‚Äôs another to be a bad winner.
---
You're correct, however EAC says they won't automatically ban for changing png files so the runs isn't there.
---
'Mindgame'
---
Its Dev stream #118 2.5.0 if you want to look for it.
---
Regardless, vault speed DOES NOT work and this has been known for a long time.
---
Looking for it, however as I started to research this I've found their Twitch channel has completely nuked all but 4 VODs, and their youtube channel is just a disaster. For example, there are 3 different VODS, all named "Dead By Daylight | #117 - Creation of The Legion"
---
For what it's worth, if I can find it I think it would be the VOD referenced in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/af3l96/developer_stream_118_250_ptb_explained_summary/) thread. This is where McLean went into detail about certain changes and from the transcribed summary, this little bit stands out:
---
&gt; Louis - "There's a bug with Prove Thyself on the PTB where it's affecting other modifiers incorrectly. It's not supposed to."
---
&gt; Not_Queen - "Does that include vaulting?"
---
&gt; Stefan - "No, I don't think so. It used to, back in the day."
---
&gt; Not_Queen - "Can we verify?"
---
&gt; Louis - "These were effects that were never meant to modify vault speed. These things all happened as 'happy accidents.' People told us, because the text on the perk said, '...when you do XYZ,' and then somebody else did vaulting and realized that it was making [their] vault faster. We looked at that and said, 'Yep.' We identified the issue that was letting that happen and we said, 'Yep.' Then we said, 'Would it be improving the game to fix this right now,' sat around and thought, 'No, not really.' So we left it."
---
got hit in the back and run in straight line neverlooking back.
---
No, by not having fun I mean toxic sv that tbag every time and say ggez, or noob killer, or baby killer, I don't mind losing or winning, just getting fun (and points, delicious points) but the toxicity just make me want to throw the ps4 by the window
---
I'm on rn I've been grinding BP all day and have my meg to level 32 and my david prestige 1 level 18? Gt is L33TDEMONCHILD
---
Lol entitlement of killer mains? I play survivor more firstly. Secondly higher ranking survivors cry, complain, and disconnect the second the game doesnt go their way, messaging every person that didnt let them win. The survivors rulebook for killers is bigger then the killers rulebook for survivors. Also who said anything about losing a game as spirit? Also no shit different killers play differently but try legion on the resting place in below rank 8 and see how viable he is. You'll see survivors being toxic calling you trash before you see a killer doing that. You'll see tbags and disconnecting constantly from survivors who then complain when you are toxic back. For you to be saying this you obviously are a survivor main who hasn't gotten past rank 13 killer.
---
Stealth killers + bald areas, and medkits are not infinite. Plus doing gens injured forces you into running Adrenaline, which is a perk that is useless or even counter productive (exhaustion) 50% of the time.
---
projecting
---
It's almost like this fanbase has a tendency to overreact to insane degrees about everything
---
Not the cat :((
---
Looks a lot like Laurie...
---
It‚Äôs ok. I try to be chill about these now a days :)
---
Lol. Spirit is fun
---
It was likely an unintended effect from the medium vault changes, since spine chill wasnt really meant to change vault speed, they probably just left it. I dont think ive ever seen resilience used or used it myself so I cant speak for its effects.
---
I havent seen that much confusion, its usually people hearing about it from an older source and seeing it doesnt work. I use spine chill on every nearly single build and you can 100% tell it doesnt boost you at all compared to a build without it.
---
It‚Äôs a pretty standard build for all killers tho!
---
The passive-aggressiveness is strong with this one
---
Isnt "ninja" a popular fortnite streamer or something
---
&gt; I havent seen that much confusion
---
Really? I've seen people asking a lot the past couple months, especially the last week or so
---
I thought you were an SCP for a sec
---
I'll let you know when I get on.
---
Shes fine until red ranks where you typically need 2 iris and 2 golds which is really hard on certain killers since they either give up early gens for control (Trapper/Hag/maybe a slow meyers build) or they give up chaser/malicious points with fast downs. 
---
Nurse and Spirit are the best killers for getting good emblems (not just 4king) but surprisingly Pig and Legion can do very well too.
---
Your downvotes are not in vain.
---
Seriously. Sometimes I wonder what goes on in SWF voice com...
---
this isn't funny. i only laugh at the same karen joke 200 times a day.
---
please make the same karen joke as everyone else
---
You are most welcome
---
This deserves a gold medalü§£ü§£
---
Don't worry, my friend didn't realize that Hag's ability to teleport was her power, and I didn't realize that Myers had to stare at you to get stronger.
---
I said "just" make you vault really fast. It wouldn't have the entity block of the window. All it would do is give you tier 3 myers vault speed on steroids.
---
Hillbilly requires positioning and game sense. Put spirit instead. Easy as fuck and way harder to counter than Billy
---
I'm sure the ppl who reported gen tapping were just kidding, cause yeah that would be one really stupid noob cry.
---
I don't care what anyone says. Hag still scares the shit out of me.
---
I somehow cannot, for the life of me, work out opening in-game chat on my Xbox. It's annoying.
---
They removed that when the chapter went live and it made me big sad
---
I'd recommend Nurse and Dwight tbf.
---
I edited in another sentence saying I just searched and theres only been 3 threads since the change in january asking if its been changed. Im very active in these question threads and Ive maybe seen it 3 or 4 times in the last 6 months as well. Usually all these people get the same answer saying it used to and now doesnt.
---
Im not active on the official forums so if its there, I wouldnt know.
---
Wnt against a monitor and abuse, bbq, ebony mori, infinite tier 3 myers, so fun
---
Google's OP...yea no
---
Ghostface was officially released June 18th. Since the official roadmap predicts a new chapter every 3 months it should be around August 18th. But they always release a PTB  with the new killer a few weeks before the official release so I'd say we will know the new killer in more or less 2 weeks from now and it will be officially released  August 18th.
---
I was going for impossible skill checks but my lullaby didn't last that long, so it turned into a gen protection game.
---
So you admit to DC‚Äôing matches. I find that worse than any tunneling or camping. Glad that is going to be punished soon (unlike camping or tunneling which is actually a strategy. They have a perk for it, so it is dev-approved. If you don‚Äôt like tunneling, run DS or BT.)
---
Comms is cheating. Just because you don‚Äôt feel it affects you too much, doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt cheating. I have seen many, many streamed matches where even casual talk is basically free perks: ‚Äúbeing chased by the killer‚Äù, ‚Äútotem is by the shack‚Äù, ‚Äúgoing for the save‚Äù ‚Äúwait for the last gen (adrenaline)‚Äù. Free bond, small game, kindred, and gen progress knowledge (among others). If they modded the game to allow them to load 8 perks each, would that be cheating? How about if they only used 1 of the extra perks? Yes, still cheating. 
---
And you can absolutely complain about gen rush while using other strategies. They are two different things. Can you complain about bad food in the cafeteria if you have a D in Biology? Yes. Same thing. 
---
Gens go very fast in a coordinated team, which is why ruin has been a meta. That is a fact. 
---
Tunneling and camping can work when used well to control a match, herd survivors, and set traps for multiple downs. That is also a fact. 
---
Both facts.
---
The Joke is that you think the 3rd spot is gonna be spirit lol.
---
"its a guaranteed pip and its fun fucking with low level killers"
---
As a survivor, I had a teammate yesterday that just ran around the map clicking their flashlight at me.  
---
God I wanted then to die.
---
Same...
---
I'd personally go for the Medkit because it saves me so much time. I also love running Pharmacy so it makes it even better.
---
reddit's search algorithm is horrendous and always has been so I wouldn't put much stock in your ability, or inability, to find things through it
---
beside the point tho
---
&gt; and I still find it really lame
---
You can find it lame if you want to, nobody is saying that you can't. The whole point of my comment was this shame tactic where players try forcing killers into playing certain ways they find most pleasing. None of that matters. If it's not an exploit or glitch, or any other thing that breaks the ToS, then it's all fair game, regardless of how someone feels about it. 
---
People get bitchy losing their purple flashlights, their keys, their medkits, or not getting to fully milk their BPS. They get pissy losing ranks, and they incessantly bitch about not getting many blood points in a match because "they didn't get to experience it".
---
Fuck all that. This game is a risk in every match. You shouldn't *expect* to make it all the way through to the end, *especially* not off the benevolence of the killer. It's not a tour, it's not an experience, it's a fight for your life, and if you get taken out first or in a way you find unsavory, that's just the way it is. It doesn't matter how "fair" you play as a killer because the same whiny survivors that complain about how they died are the ones that will trash talk you in the end game screen "gg ez baby killer get fucked you suck". 
---
&gt; Camping/ tunnelling are really only resorts for when
---
See, this is the part I'm talking about. They may be something you have to resort to strategy-wise at some point, but you're speaking as if they're only considered acceptable at that time. My argument is that they're acceptable at any time because everything is fair game. Do I like being camped? No. Do I like being hard focused fresh off the hook when it's suboptimal for the killer? No, and I don't think anybody likes either of these things; however, it's not about whether you like it, and there isn't anything you can do about it.
---
The only thing that matters to me is not forcing people into playing certain ways, particularly when it's one sided as it always has been. If killers can't tell survivors they're only allowed to loop in certain ways and have to give up and allow themselves to be downed, then survivors have no place trying to do the same to killers. If you notice, survivor responses are "git gud" or "learn to break chase", but will come up with every bullshit excuse in the world why they feel they should've been treated differently. Gloat and brag and shit talk when you win, but sulk and throw temper tantrums when you lose because you're a pathetic sore loser.
---
Bottom line, the choice in how you die ends the moment you hit the ground. Once the killer has you on his shoulder, barring teammate intervention, he's now in complete control of your fate. If you don't like it, then this game, and ones like it, aren't for you.
---
Not on any of my killer builds, I use brute killer power like a boss, no NOEDs either.  I still play its 2016 :)
---
Sometimes you have to let out just one cuss word
---
High key bro, watch a few vids of the dbd youtubers, they play both and you get to see where the good loops are, well just copy them a bit lol
---
One half the game is having a way easier time than the other, and people wonder why queue times are so long "Dont be a little bitch about it" Lol get fucked
---
just be wary of elevated areas so you can put balanced landing to good use, it's like one of the best exhaustion perks, especially end game when you can't find the hatch
---
Urban Evasion?
---
Billy
---
Balanced landing is a top perk. It's useful even when you're exhausted.
---
Yeah I did she think I was gonna be salty or something? Lmao
---
Around 200-300 hours for unlocking all perks from all characters, then main one survivor and one killer with a bunch of good perks. That is a lot of time just to have a decent load out. It‚Äôs like the TV shows where they say it gets good after the 6th season, but you have to watch from the beginning.
---
Switch self-care for adrenaline and you got a really good build
---
I would've let the Dwight go if it were me.
---
Then run away, you can decline heals by running
---
Doctor ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Hahaha this, I'll round a corner expecting to smack the ever living daylights out of them and bam! Pallet to the face, I'm usually like "Oh! Alright that was a good one, you're still gonna die tho"
---
Mainly m1 killers with ruin and solo survivors at low ranks need certain perks to perform well.
---
Actually, nevermind. After looking up your posts and seeing you are a trump fan and use clowns as a dog whistle for the clown world.. well, your opinion means nothing, people like you are pretty disgusting
---
Precious Snowflake: If she‚Äôs the first one hit in the match, she instead takes no damage and it‚Äôs instead applied to another survivor randomly
---
Lmao bro today is the worst its been i was literally just ina lobby with angry pug where they were saying DONT YOU JUST LOVE COMPLETE IMMUNITY FOR 60 SECONDS.
---
Had 2 on hooks they get saved i hit dwight, meg runs towards shack with 25 percent roughly gen i try to hit her to down her and chase dwight she gets in a locker. Now im stuck with the situation do i take the stun now and get fucked out of her and dwight. No i head back out the door get dwight down after a pallet. I put him on the hook her and another survivor finish the gen she runs straight over across the fucking map and takes him off the hook i down her and pick her up DECISIVE.
---
I chase her down get her down. 2 gens pop and the game is over.
---
This is roughly about how it goes. Funny enough this all happened so fast the guy in the beginning that i hooked jumps infront of me and gets downed and for shits and giggles i drop the meg and pick him up just to see if it was still active and it was lmao at 3 gens i hooked him.
---
I just said i literally just bitched about this on reddit.
---
Then they go on to say thats pretty much why most major streamers just play survivor now. Only the youtubers still play killer because they just record the games they did in rank reset  without the constant DS.
---
Survivors don't have to heal for 60 seconds and if they are near a locker you can't even down them to slow the game down. Unless you wanna just sit there and stare at the locker or reset the chase.
---
You really don't see the problem?
---
Lol.. Thanks
---
Little could you know, that by crushing and Mori'ing the friendly Baby Dweets you've created a Toxic SWF.
---
And thus the cycle of toxicity continues.
---
Was my only kill and at that point it was too late. I was also tired and Dwight had looped me for awhile so I was a bit salty too.
---
But bubba is ez tho, Billy's got that oneshot
---
Because it takes time to animate shit and DP already has another show coming out rn and probably another in the works at the moment
---
There are two types of losers; those who rage quit and gave a tantrum, and those who say fair game and move on. Don't be the former. 
---
If its in the game then it is fair game. If you disagree then don't play, or complain to the devs. But don't complain to other players.
---
That sounds like it takes a lot of time.
---
You don‚Äôt need to get an attitude. Im asking because I‚Äôve genuinely never seen anything that has said all traps have a box assigned to them at the start of the game. Everything I‚Äôve seen said there is a ‚Äúspecific box‚Äù but it is completely random and there is a probability for removal at each box. I‚Äôve just spent like 15 minutes trying to search information that aligns with what you‚Äôre saying and I can‚Äôt find it, just stuff about it being randomized every time you touch a box.
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Honestly I think monitor and abuse bubba is underrated.
---
Look how they massacred my boy
---
It's not as bad as F13 is, but it still has it's moments. Depending on the skill of the killer there can still be moments of tension while working on the last gen, or opening the gate when you start to hear the heartbeat. It's more of an adrenaline rush for me now. 
---
But I agree, most matches are more frustrating then anything else. Again, I really depends on the killer. When I do play killer I play as Myers, Freddy or The Spirit and do my best to be scary. I want you to escape, but I want you to feel like your not going to make it. When I play as Myers I'll peak out from a tree or through a window and then disappear and try to come around get you.
---
My friends think the game is very subpar too... oh well
---
They do, it‚Äôs the end game collapse timer.
---
Survive with Friends. Basically grouping up with friends to team up.
---
If you had just slid that meg a bit farther into the hook..
---
Nope, just now there is endgame, plus you don't know which gate is opened
---
Shit's janky. LOL! Hopefully they'll fix it.
---
It‚Äôs great that you don‚Äôt use it at all. I rely heavily on Whipsers and would love for it to be on all my killers. Since I‚Äôm capped at P3 lv50, I have no interest in over leveling her to get other perks, plus Ruin helps a bit vs the really good survivors here and there.
---
To whoever downvoted this man, /s
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm about end this guys whole career‚Äù
---
I dont expect them to start part 6 until next year but it would have been cool to see jolyne in a jail cell kinda like jotaro at the end of part 2
---
He isn‚Äôt.  They‚Äôre looking at nurse, then bubba or doctor next

Imagine wanting to put a person with the mind of a child into a dress representing adult levels of commitment and matrimony in general. Yikes.
---
Dammit. I was told it's on Xbox. Aight, thanks.
---
This is a nice idea
---
True and It also depends on the draw of the luck. I cry every time when I get the hospital map as the nurse so ruin helps a bit to slow down the game
---
So can I continue in lvling those? and what should i do after ?
---
The same way you play any other survivor? They are just re-skins
---
It's the best perk in the game
---
I got 4 of those red emblems on a game as a lvl 8 wraith in rank 8

Mobile pressure killer.

Use whatever you want.  I will adjust my play style accordingly.
---
There is a reaaon theyre that strong they dont pop up in the bloodweb that often and when used they give you a bog advantage just like with all ultra and Very rare items.
---
The entity
---
Which would make you vault equally fast as the survivor (Myers is already close) which would make ALL windows vaults useless... I still do not see how this solves the problem.
---
Most killers aren't dumb enough to grab you out

Don‚Äôt do Claudette. You probably won‚Äôt listen, but new players are attracted to her because of Self Care, but actually end up self killing themselves. There‚Äôs a time and place to know when to use Self Care and when to do gens and other stuff and new players don‚Äôt know. It would be better to play another character such as Jake (Iron Will is top tier) and David (Dead Hard is top tier). As you get better you‚Äôll  have more situational awareness to know when to heal and when to suck it up and take that risk. 
---
Also do not use Urban Evasion. It‚Äôs a shit perk that‚Äôs used by useless survivors. It literally helps me as a killer. If the killer knows you‚Äôre in the area, Urban Evasion will do very little, especially if you‚Äôre injured. It‚Äôs a waste of a slot. Don‚Äôt be scared to interact with the killer and learn how to loop. 
---
For killer, Billy is really good, top 3. Use him for SwFs and then use any killer for fun like Pig, Freddy, etc. Also Leatherface for more bloodpoints is good
---
Spirit does everything wraith does but better. 
---
Billy has better movement and a similar 'warm-up' before be can strike but his is an auto-down. 
---
Wraith suffers from lightburn for really no apparent reason. Enduring is practically essential.
---
The comparisons are rather silly honestly. Anyone who has played for any reasonable amount of time knows from experience that billy and spirit are for more formidable killers.
---
I think it mainly allows killers to get a hit if survivors run a certain way on a loop or move alongside the wall the window is on before vaulting.
---
I‚Äôm thinking areas like the outside of the shack so that survivors that can loop well don‚Äôt completely dumpster a killer. Survivors really don‚Äôt benefit at all from medium vaults.
---
It's the circle of DBD. I play a non-meta killer, get called bad and bullied. I get mad, play instasaw billy with ebony mori and get a bunch of babies and wont use it cause I feel bad.
---
Imagine wanting to playing a game where you're controlling a person with the mind of a child and making her chuck hatchets at normal people to sacrifice them to an evil entity. Yikes.
---
A man of culture as well I see!
---
Thanks!
---
Adrenaline because it creates the most pressure late game
---
I randomly joined a lobby in which all 4 of us were claudettes with items equipped.  The killer left almost instantly.
---
"just vault or window or something"
---
Hopefully original, haven‚Äôt had one in awhile
---
I just wanted to hit 1 once now I can meme about in purple ranks from now one
---
It's not that it isn't bad, it's great but situational, and most who use it don't use it well
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä finally
---
Romanticizing a child in a dress compared to playing a child minded killer in a horror themed game.
---
Bud that's not a good look.
---
How many times do you need to heal in a match, a medkit should be fine
---
You know theyre just skins? There isnt really that big of a difference just play how you did before...
---
Yeah definitely do it for the achievment. Gz on it
---
‚ÄúLoool you look so weird Laurie! GOSH!‚Äù
---
My problem is not its strength, my problem is that it's practically a flat debuff to all progress and to a degree doesn't even have to do with his power anymore. If a Freddy runs these add-ons along with Ruin, Thanatophobia and Sloppy you can basically already throw the game.
---
Idk I'm a horror movie fan lol. Always up for another known killer hahaha
---
The ole panic smack onto your keyboard *almost* never fails
---
[deleted]
---
You'd still be slightly slower, and being able to use the window again can be significant as you can get more loops in if you have enough distance on the killer.
---
Them complaining that they made it so survivors can‚Äôt escape anymore. I have two people that use this idiotic claim because they used to be really entitled survivor mains.
---
10/10 billy. I would LOVE to go against someone other than spirit. I had her for 3/5 matches I played last night.
---
First time I saw old spooky boy I was maybe a week in, following around my much more experienced friend looking for a genny. I swinging my my camera around looking for the killer we didn't know the identity of yet. 
---
"Bro I saw something!" 
---
"Where? Nah we are fine. No heartbeat don't see anything."
---
"It was like a shimmer or something, I'm telling you."
---
... must be nothing.
---
"Shimmer" pops out from behind tree DING DING. Runs for life and gets us all killed.
---
That‚Äôs not really how you use the meme
---
On pc it is locked at 60fps by default. But you can go into the files of the game to make it whatever you want it to be.
---
if it‚Äôs Julie and Susie this is good content
---
thats sarcasm right
---
Chains also have an affect on you even if you yourself aren't in the dream, combined with red paint brush you're practically forced to spend time to wake up. Not to mention even if no one is in the dream you still have a slightly reduced action speed.
---
Please tell me your not using the real game lol, this is hella bannable haha
---
Probably because I'm new. :)
---
I was planning on cosplay as Legion before I even joined Reddit. I didnt know there's so many of legion cosplay here :p
---
There is a huge roster tho for killers!
---
As I said, these add-ons in practice are just flat debuffs.
---
It's kinda surprising the amount of time he says "bitch" in the actual movies. Like at least 6-7 times per movie.
---
Mine is Sloppy Butcher, Ruin, And the last two are swappable but the most success seems to be for me with Enduring and Pop Goes the Weasel. Sloppy butcher is just fucking mean when using Legion it forces people to either be injured or waste double time to heal themselves on top of mending. Enduring to eat pallets instead of respecting them to shorten the chases a tad bit. Pop goes the weasel is usually better on high mobility killers but I found that it can make a huge difference in the long run when ruin ends up breaking.
---
yeah im not dumb so im using the dev build
---
sad vroom
---
Well, now he's just a mobile killer. A child cuddling a plushtoy creates more pressure than Legion.
---
He says "bitch" a lot in the movies so the R&amp;M reference is just back to a Freddy reference.
---
You keep some when you use tombstone

Yep, my mistake

Can someone explain, with sources/citation, how removing RBT actually works? I‚Äôve seen many people say (after a test) that each box has a random probability of removing your trap, but I‚Äôve seen others say that each trap is assigned a specific box at the beginning of the game. I want to know exactly how it works, and I‚Äôve searched online myself to see what people say, and the only thing I find is the test another redditor did. Someone else said that devs said it‚Äôs the second thing, but they didn‚Äôt provide a link to show me WHERE they said this. If there‚Äôs misinformation, we should try to clarify, and I would like to know.

watch out bro üò≥üò§
---
The fun is in watching your teammates squirm with rage when they see No Mither in-game, then explode when they see Self-Care post-game.
---
&gt;The point is that instead of adding Ruin back with the Hag patch, they should've just added a core game mechanic that slowed down generator speeds 
---
Except they did. Once gens took 70 seconds to complete, there was no coop penalty and killers couldn't break them.
---
Besides, you can't just make gen repairs slower since that is the less interesting part of the game, while adding more tools to the killer makes it more interactive for both sides.
---
I love that Samination series!
---
I didn't even notice lol.
---
My button for skill checks is L1. Did you change yours?
---
Close the hatch and make them open the Gates and escape give them a taste of what true victory is hatch is just the hatch I don't like it
---
Make survivors faster than the killer, like Friday the 13th I guess, and then make it harder to survive if you are caught, and also make it easier to sneak up on survivors, tho i feel like that would ruin dbd imo
---
Slippery sounds like it‚Äôd be so annoying with dead hard XD. Honestly these seem like decent ideas!
---
The effect is comparatively minor when they are awake it‚Äôs significantly stronger when asleep. It‚Äôs the top tier form of the rope add ins and the rarest of the lot so it kind of makes sense it has a powerful effect that can be felt even when awake.
---
Lmao I am dumb and put wrong letter I will change it
---
Don‚Äôt tunnel 4head
---
I'll 99 the gates and walk in the direction of the hook but if the killer is coming at me I'm outta there.

I've recently started playing Bubba and yeah, his power ain't great, but when you get the ball rolling with him he's amazing. There are games where the survivors completely wipe the floor with me, and others where I 4K without a gen done.
---
I currently use BBQ, Devour Hope, Franklin's and Enduring on him, and it's really fun. You can't believe how many people will go back to pick up their items and wasting time that way. He's also quite map dependent and I find him much easier on either indoor maps like Lery's and Game, as well as MacMillain and Coldwind.
---
The most important part imo is to learn when to use the Chainsaw and how exactly it works. It's very trial and error and dependent on your own judgement. It also never hurts to put people in the basement, because the other Survivors will expect you to camp and actually don't react to your heartbeat until it's too late.
---
I love spirit but man she gets a lot of hate XD
---
I think Legion should spawn with itself and three stationary character models. He can teleport to any of these like Freddie on a gen and the model they were just controlling just stand where it was left. I think it would be cool if they all have off a terror radius but once Legion was in a Chase only the model being used gives off the radius.
---
Context: Dude gets downed from Billy, random guy DC‚Äôs. Dude suicided. This all happens in the first 30 seconds of the game. I decided to quit because there is no point in staying
---
Didn't Friday have a Stamina meter and stats for each survivor?
---
Would something like that work for dbd since with having a stamina meter that would mean you wouldn't be able to loop unless your meter is high and having each character have a different stat spread would make people have to choose which one would best fit a certain job
---
As someone who regularly has to move around chairs for his work, lifting 3 chairs and carrying them for any distance is exhausting.  If a first grader is lifting 6, that kid is either Kryptonian or they ate all the other kids on the playground and absorbed their power.
---
I‚Äôve been having fun with sudden death obsession. Play with your food, save the best for last, rancor. Just ignore the obsession, maybe slap them a few times hook them once for blood points but otherwise leave them alone and kill the other three with fat stacks of tokens. If gates open rancor comes in slap their exposed ass and Mori them.
---

Maybe they could...you know...just delete the whole map?  I hate it.

Urban evasion for sure!! Nea is my main (black and white hair Nea looks like me irl;) - I run urban evasion, self care, spine chill, and alert. I like tracking the killer and being a sneaky bitch.
---
Who‚Äôs shittin in the tall grass?
---
I mean if there are 2 survivors left and 5 gens to be done one person dying would be better so the other can get the hatch.
---
Ruin, Bamboozle, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike - that's about it. Maybe NOED, to a lesser extent. There aren't too many, but I agree that these should be reworked in favor of basic game mechanics addressing the respective problems, instead.
---
Like Bubba doesn't one shot?
---
This is gold

I am so sick of these posts. Every 6 minutes its a new one. Like, we get it. Matchmaking is messed up. Does everyone posting these not see there are 20 others for every 1 posted??

Yeah, the only adrenaline left anymore is the Meg perk.
---
Don't get hit?
---
See, I also know that, but it doesn't answer my question. Is it really balanced if a medium vault is functionally no different than a slow vault?
---
Cool! Any tips for improving? I‚Äôm currently rank 10
---
Lemme guess, you use the stupid wheel thing that is a pain in the ass to clean
---
why the tbag though
---
I've had the opposite happen, I got the 4% got knocked down again, hooked and died instantly.
---
It's weird seeing so many people talk about how bad Legion is or how much he needs a rework all while being my least favorite killer to play against.
---
is there any pattern to when chapters go on sale on psn? i think maybe a month ago all the chapters except ghost face were on sale, and then that ended and there was another sale a couple weeks ago where only the licensed killers (except ghost face) were on sale. I just need Demise of the Faithful and Shattered Bloodline at this point but i don't want to pay full price if they're going to be on sale at some point
---
what lol
---
I play like exclusively survivor, with how fast gens go, MoM gave so much extra time to the chase and broke killer momentum to give survivors back power.  The extra hit let you do the most ballsy shit also in end game.  While it was insanely good (and now sadly a dead perk)  Id still say DS change was the biggest gift to killers.
---
Yeah I'm not a fan of that one either, luckily it's an ultra rare add-on. Wraith definitely gives me jump scares but I feel like I survive against him more than others.. I think he might be a little underwhelming strength wise.
---
Thank you! I appreciate the reply, I'll definitely take the bbq advice. Basement camping is something I steer well away from, so I'll level him up and then use bbq with a different killer. Maybe even Huntress, for hatchets.
---
Small game already counters mechanic that is strictly too weak on all maps aside from the new badhams where things are more balanced.
---
Like more of a less human creature maybe? We have so many killers but nothing of the non human variant. Idk what you could add but there are plenty of killers in movies that are not human lol
---
It's not even guaranteed to be a matchmaking post. That teams average is very fitting to your rank. They're most likely SWF or at least a couple duos or just one trio. Rank doesnt mean shit anyway. Just playing in general and always making sure you're doing SOMETHING at all times will rank you up.
---
Hey more people are laughing at it than those who aren‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt really find it very funny either but don‚Äôt be a stick in the mud who gatekeeps humour from other people.
---
The reason I‚Äôm so sure is because my friend froze up at the exact same time. Very odd coincidence if you ask me
---
They should have made him transform into a survivor or something by taking his mask off and blending in. No idea how it would work and it would be impossible to use in swf but a very cool concept regardless.
---
Thats cause the Nurse m1's when she blinked were coded as something else, and not a M1.  It got fixed though.
---
I work as IT/scheduling at a college.  That said, while my actual JOB is scheduling rooms and making sure that all the electronic equipment in said rooms is functional, students and faculty are assholes who constantly leave the rooms in disarray and move shit around between rooms, so a lot of my day is used up lugging furniture, projectors, and microphones around so that the rooms are in presentable/usable condition for future classes.
---
Gonna be that guy real quick: 
---
&gt; If everyone else in the trail 
---

---
Updooted though, don't get me wrong. Quality meme.
---
It's more scarier if it's Michael Myers. Been playing for 2 years, and it still scares me shitless when he comes flying around the corner and picks you up
---
Yeah like when I was being a MoM gamer I want the one killer who can still get kills against it to be still affected by it you know? I brought the perk for nurses lol
---
I want some niche hook-related perk for survivors that encourage sabotaging hooks. Maybe a token perk or something.
---
For killer I want some niche chest-related perk. Maybe give someone the exposed effect for searching them or maybe an aura read or search penalty.
---
I'm not going to argue that this game is busted and has a lot of bugs. I'm with you there.  What I will say is that there's no such thing as random when it comes to bugs and spreading misinformation doesn't help them get fixed.
---
There's a cause for every single bug that has ever existed and often times finding it when you have this many variables is rather difficult. So either help or don't, but saying they think it's fixed when they have just said they know it is broken doesn't help it get fixed.
---
I say everywhere. Should I tell you the deffinition of everywhere?
---
Why is this posted here...
---
So, you are saying me Small Game should keep tracking killers belongings, fucking pallet freddy, hag, trapper... And shouldn't have a totem counter? Of course now it's WAY balanced amiright?
---
I really like having it track the killers belongings. It's really handy against trapper and hag
---
I was banned for saying a joke, something harmful, that related to the game. But whatever, what's funny is how people get warnings, but I never got a single one, and banned. It's kinda stupid, but whatever, lol
---
Its from a live stream. Hes called tyler1
---
thats just dev spaghetti code tbh, which sucks but it is what it is.  DH is better against nurse anyway since her M1s are extremely telegraphed
---
 If you're this bothered by it then why do you feel the need to comment? It's not like your comment is gonna magically change every post on this sub. Your comment was just as pointless as my post.
---
I wish the game would do something like have the % chance visible so the survivor knew it was likely a bad move.
---
Yeah, I know, but I wouldn't care losing this by turning it into a good searching perk. Like trapper isn't THAT good to have a perk that fucks him, doesn't seem too fair IMO
---
I‚Äôm soo onboard with having a killer that non human! It makes more sense
---
If the survivor you are chasing is asleep you can  end chases quite fast when you know what you're doing.
---
Basically as they run to a loop, you can put a snare down just before the pallet/window. If the survivor doesn't abandon the loop you will almost always secure a free hit, since they wont have time to drop the pallet/fast vault before you can gain just enough ground to hit them.
---
The only way for the survivor to "counter" this is to completely abandon loops after one time, but that just isnt a very good counter, or to just never be asleep which is basically impossible. 
---
Dream Pallets are only even slightly helpful if the survivors are dumb enough to not realize it's fake and try to loop you around it. This requires the survivor to make a mistake, whereas the snares are effective even against a survivor who is playing optimally.
---
Snares can also be used as a detection tool, place one in a doorway/choke point and any sleeping survivor who walks past will alert you of their presence. I always place one at the top of the basement, near my ruin, etc. Which will deter sleeping survivors, or at the very least warn you of what they're doing.
---
Well yeah but we were being THOSE gamers running DH adrenaline DS and mom lol
---
I appreciate that
---
I‚Äôm gunning for the chest version of Nurse‚Äôs calling. Maybe a perk which reduces survivor luck by a few percent whenever a gen gets done.
---
The hit bounces off every survivor and the killer ends up injured
---
&gt;Small game already counters mechanic that is strictly too weak on all maps aside from the new badhams where things are more balanced.
---
Totem spawns in Badhams look more difficult to find because they are new-ish. Once people start to memorize the tiles that have a totem tied to it, it will be just like any other map.
---
I‚Äôm so bad at seeing him that he can just walk up on me lol.
---
I lose against the wraith a lot. But legion is just as bad, especially when they use feral frenzy to tunnel you into oblivion.

---
This is great haha
---
In my head it was ‚Äúokay, on first hit of the game it‚Äôs a Russian roulette of who takes the hit‚Äù but I like yours more.
---
Im not even complaining about the match up. It was an easy game. Just seemed weird to me.
---
Okay, thank you for clarifying. There was a lot of people saying something different, and the people who would say this would just say ‚Äúdevs said it,‚Äù but never leave a link showing where you guys have said it in depth. When you look in game, there‚Äôs a lot of things that don‚Äôt have much clarification, and relying on other players in the reddit testing things doesn‚Äôt seem to be reliable.
---
Remember when we saw all the masks and assumed it was a mimic killer or could teleport out of lockers between multiple bodies?
---
I just wanted to take some of my free time after work to spend it on telling you how much of a waste of time your post is, and how nobody cares about it. You annoyed me with your post and I‚Äôm letting out my frustration by telling you it‚Äôs pointless, unoriginal, not at all entertaining/informative, or conversation starter worthy. Have a nice life.
---
22k points, seems like a balanced noed game
---
I was originally thinking of writing a survivor who comes from the medieval times, since most survivors atm are quite modern. Saying that, I do like your idea, having a survivor who's done bad things in their life could add more depth to the game
---
Glad I'm not the only one...just you or co-oping a gen or a heal or...?
---
Sorry for the racist comment that I did not blur out. Thought it should be seen what was said to me. The last comment that I was writing that had to be cut off was "Gotta love racism and homophobia."
---
How did they change the dream world? Like what kind of things do the survivors have to deal with now that makes the dream world so bad? I haven‚Äôt read into it
---
Literally any buffs to it are too much. It's a bad perk, simply because it counters a mechanic that is weak. As more and more of these new maps come out, it will get better by virtue of the mechanic it counters becoming actually good
---
I just think Diversion needs a little tweak, 45 seconds to throw a single pebble and no stacks are a problem.
---
I mean, I'm survivor main rank 12(yes not good i know) and every 3rd game or so I get the plague. Literally all she has to do is spit on everyone. Then my teammates will cleanse(a dumb thing to do if u dont know already) and then she gets OP and easily wins.
---
The Entity could in a sense punish those who did bad things in their lives. At least until they become the killers themselves.
---
That‚Äôs still Jamie Lee Curtis in the 2019 movie? She‚Äôs just older. Judging by her outfit it is Laurie (JLC) from the original movies.
---
No way my boy Ned said that
---
BBQ is honestly great on all survivors and God tier on some. It doubles all blood point gains every game, which by itself is amazing.
---
Then on top of that it is easily the best detection perk, completely a must have on high mobility killers like nurse, Billy, or new freddy.
---
Not bubba or wraith

This is what BHVR thinks:

&gt;Q: [Any info on a totem counter of some sort that would be displayed on the screen? This would really benefit people who solo queue.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ckrt86/we_are_bhvr_ask_us_anything/evpxqz5/)
---
&gt;A: Hello SP_0101, we have thought about this as this has been brought up a few times. We are unsure whether or not we will put a totem counter in game, or whether a perk such as Small Game might get the counter at the moment. Ultimately, we are looking for the best way to bridge this knowledge gap between solos and swf.
---
I got called the N word today by a SWF team because I played spirit. Did you not read the handbook? Rule #489 clearly states we cannot play spirit /s
---
Unlucky she was born with water on the brain probably

---
I'd bet that you unhooking yourself pushed yoy into a glitches second phase or something
---
Not always, but I've literally had that exact scenario happen.
---
Because of his build.
---
Mimdgame into chase break, it's not that difficult against people who don't know chase mechanics..
---
 Waste of free time if you ask me. But okay lol
---
Legion is pretty strong if you know how to use him. He really slows down the game and makes gen repairs go to a complete halt. Especially with the right perks.
---
Cannibal is great with playing with your food. He needs the right perks to function well also.
---
Clown is just... Clown has no saving.
---
ohh fair enough lol.  Finally a build that can deal with Nurse.  I liked MoM cause it made good nurses way more doable, sucks it cucked all the already weak killers.

---
No, dead hard is really good. You can use it while injured due to the sickness. You can also dodge part of the corrupted purge using it as well.
---
I would swap wraith and plague. Their back posture is equal but wraith should lose points for that crooked neck. Also plague maintains her posture while sprinting AND projectile vomiting blood. Surely that counts for something?
---
Nurse with add ons
---
Blink ability let‚Äôs her find survivors and end chases quickly. Looping and pallets that frustrate other killers barely affect her at all.

That‚Äôs the problem. She‚Äôs so inherently fucked for balance. She can‚Äôt really be nerfed without destroying her or if her nerf is a survivor buff, further invalidating other killers
---
That would be amazing but idk if there would be a way to do it. Still would be awesome tho have sebastian as a survivor!
---
Lol ok well, at the games current state, I win nearly every match while playing nice. Without ruin and obviously noed. That's overpowered. It got boring so I rarely play her. How can you possibly know if my survs are worse than yours? Maybe you're just bad? Solo survs are at the mercy of a broken pip AND matchmaking system. 
---
 I've played this game for a long time, If you think only survs have abused OP mechanics, you're clearly bias. From uncounterable face camping with traps at feet to impossible basement saves bc body blocking or bc borrowed time and DH didnt exist yet. I supported looping nerfs when it was needed and saw killers hold to dear life all of their bs mechanics. Killer mains are spoiled now.
---
 If you cant master an s tier killer or handle a fair regular 2k on a mid tier killer, you just need to get good. If you can only win playing nurse...I mean lol so you can only win with a killer that's utterly broken? This is the only game I see players actually making excuses for cheesy mechanics. Seriously you can always go for brainless camp/tunnel strat and 2k. This game is good at boosting poor play on both sides.
---
Such a Noob, using an OP Killer with one Perk and no add-ons.
---
Right? It would be pretty awesome
---
I g h t
---
Bruh I don‚Äôt deliberately go out of my way to queue with them.  Its fun when I play with my friends who JUST GOT THE GAME.
---
I solo queue as survivor at my own rank.
---
Aight, now I need to talk to the CEO of racism, that at the same time, I gotta wack those homophobes. What should I do?!?
---
K
---
Instead of Pop I'd use BBQ for the extra bloodpoint and because not everyone expect Legion to have it allowing you to maybe get some pressure going with your power without having to look long for a survivor
---
I didn't ask where am i wrong twice XD. I said how am i wrong and your answer is "Everywhere". What a dumb kid you must be
---
The fact that the envious trophy perk is an obsession perk is a cherry on the top of it.
---
In the dream world survivors are susceptible to dream traps (pallets and snares) and Freddy's teleport power also recharges faster for each sleeping survivor.
---
There are no other penalties for being asleep in his base kit. However there are MANY addons that have negative effects for sleeping survivors, usually to the effect of slowing down their action speed, or giving a negative status when hit with a trap. 
---
It is just better to be awake in general, as it makes it much harder for freddy to end chases, and basically makes him a simple M1 character. If givin the choice, a smart freddy will always chase a sleeping survivor over an awake one. As he can end the chase much faster.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm slowly learning her. She‚Äôs a little weird like I didn‚Äôt fully understand you have to infect multiple times to inflict broken on the survivors and that damages. Would really help me a lot. But honestly the groups I go against constantly cleanse which is kinda fun.
---
Damn right lol
---
I worded that wrong lmao my bad. I meant that instead of Nurse, maybe they should prioritise a useless killer.
---
I have gotten lots of hits by trapping corn. Very great strat 10/10.
---
The salt is contagious so I understand lol
---
Yeah it's Toxic in the sense that everyone wants to win and everyone is good. I'm not cutting anyone slack and I'm going to do what your playstyle dictates. That may mean tunneling or if I see 3 guys running around while I hook it may mean not marching off to the other side of the map which instantly becomes "Hook Camping" to survivors. 
---
Then you tend to get "Your Trash" messages  if you 4k or only get 1 or no kills because "Playstyle" or "Perks"
---
Depends on the kind of killer you like to play. All 3 play differently. If you like killers that aren't forced to just M1, and loop till you down the survivor, Plague or Legion. Legion has the feral frenzy to get that first hit (maybe on multiple people), and Plague has Corrupt Purge to have ranged damaged.
---
My personal preference on the 3...is Plague. Was a little overwhelming at first, but fun once I got the hang of her power.
---
If you going for perks. Clown. His perks can be used by any killer. I only like Plague's Corrupt Intervention for my Trapper or Hag. And Legion's Discordance for Nurse, Spirit, and Billy.
---
He did a way better job of remaking Halloween than whoever did the New Nightmare. 
---
But I also just really love Robert Englund as Freddy so I could be biased. 
---
I love Laurie too but Annie was my favorite, always.
---
Well if you're being chased by both the killer and the surv, I guess you have a point, but then again you got bigger issues if that's the case
---
Survivors move slower when in the fog. Why make him sanic?
---
I don't think mobile is going to be cross platform with the other ones at all. I've played the mobile version and they've made too many gameplay changes from the PC/console version for it to work.
---
Make it so you don't have to struggle on the 2nd hook and instead can emote while hooked.  Just keep pointing and waving to express your displeasure.
---
Awww biitch
---
Balance with perks it was the devs have done and it is a trash way to balance dbd. I think they've finally understood this with the vanilla experiment.
---
ah i see, i always thought it would be useless because even if you dead hard you‚Äôre still getting puked on and would still be infected
---
Cheers , might give her a go
---
Good job! How is your mental health after all the spirits you've faced?
---
Ned? :D
---
What was the joke?
---
People call you Pauline Hanson on a regular basis, sorry my bad I‚Äôll come up with something more original next time since this has been such an inconvenience to you princess.
---
It always astounds me when people get pissy because I don't help someone off a hook when the exit gates are about to open. You can usually tell pretty quick that it's an easy save or if it's going to just cause someone else to get hooked and you know what? I mostly play solo, I want my escape points when I can get them.
---
Reading is hard I guess lol
---
Hey all I'm saying is when I play spirit I rarely get dcs or complaints. Must be bc I attempt to play as fun as possible. Empathy goes a long way when using an s tier lol
---
You are only allowed to play killers that are easily beatable and bullied!
---
It does have a stamina meter but Jason can also teleport to a location in the map, quick phase to the counselor. The counter to Jason is being able to knock him out, use a pocket knife. Not their speed. Jason can kill counselors way easier but there‚Äôs also 8 of them.
---
What can you expect from a guy with with 61 karma
---
If you look at the bigger picture, by buffing Small Game solo survivors will feel more inclined to equip it. More survivors running Small Game means it reduces the amount of really strong perks they could potentially be running (Adrenaline, DS, Unbreakable, Self-Care, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time etc). Granted that SWF won't be too affected by this change (even though I can see at least 1 crew member running it), the chances of multiple solo survivors in your lobby with Small Game is high. 
---
Additionally, having the totem counter showing that not all totems have been cleansed, it will be 100% guaranteed that all survivors with this information will spend some time looking for it and cleansing it (10s cleansing a totem is more time in comparison to a survivor doing a generator while debuffed by thanatophobia). 
---
Finally, the killer might not even be running NOED which means every killer (using NOED or not) will benefit from a survivor running one less meta perk and wasting time cleansing totems. 
---
Win - win situation unless you use and rely on NOED in every game you play, then I could see an argument against it. Personally I dropped NOED from every killer I play long time ago.
---
And get the satisfaction when he tries to stalk but you reveal him on hook.
---
Welcome to prime time Bitch!
---
Should be noted she‚Äôs one of the harder killers to learn. Spirit is almost as good and is easier to use imo.
---
Yup each of mine were like that...with spine chill I move my camera to a dark uncluttered part of the screen and don't look around so I can focus on my skill checks...whole reason I use that perk...sometimes I'll do a totem or a gen just for a sec just to see if he is around...
---
How does it counter them by making their job easier
---
I mean I made both the template and the caption so...
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
But you can't take everything from killers while taking nothing from survivors. That's not fair or balanced.
---
They're looking into reworking Nurse's addons, as one of her big issues is that she's incredibly potent with literally no addons and basically all her addons hinder her.
---
This was me last night playing with a friend who just got the game. He goes wtf he‚Äôs just looking at me. Next thing you know he‚Äôs got his tier 2. Good times I guess.
---
Don't get m1'd lmao, you literally convert all killers to m1 killers, just loop
---
I've spent the past 6.5 HOURS trying to get from R3 (1 pip) to R2.
---
I'm currently at R3 (1 pip)...
---
Kill me.
---
Bro its honestly starting to sound like your clutching onto that as an excuse like every exclusively swf player does, every swf has one player who "just g ot the game" the asshole part is using your advantages to "fuck with low rank killers for fun"
---
I don‚Äôt see why they haven‚Äôt done this already. If you play SWF you see their rank so it wouldn‚Äôt be hard to implement.
---
I normally get messed up ranks when it‚Äôs taken me a while to find a lobby, and to be honest if it has put me with anything but red/purple rank survivors i‚Äôd rather see it and leave then wait again over playing a match with teammates that aren‚Äôt at my rank.
---
slowing down while throwing the bottles and reloading them is unnecessary. it totally defeats the purpose of his power, which is already weak enough due to being blocked by walls, junk piles and cars that are apparently 13 feet tall. Freddy proves he'd be perfectly fair if the slowdown was removed. in face he'd still be weaker than Freddy.
---
Some people look at the rep comments when trading, i guess
---
I have seen so many survivors use their D-strike before their 2nd hook early in the game and that is just dumb, if you use it before you are guaranteed dead-on-hook you're not doing it right.
---
My fellow wraith mains! Bing bong!
---
they are a very rare breed, be sure to be nice to one when you eventually see one :3
---
Hell yeah!
---
So I‚Äôm assuming you got to use your perk lol gg
---
Unhooking a survivor while the killer is chasing you is a dick move with or without borrowed time. Unless you're at the end game collapse. Dont give the killer free points even if the hooked survivor hits second state. I'd rather be safely unhooked after hitting second state and get time to regain my composure than be farmed back to the hook.
---
ohh, tks
---
She def can I hear ya there
---
Who thought having him slow down when tossing bottles was a good idea I beats the whole purpose of it
---
Wait a new killer is incoming?
---
You can turn on a setting for your mouse that keeps m1 held down till you click it again
---
Don't know if I'd say it's one of the better perks, but it's used as a heads up when the killer is heading your way. It's handy against some stealth killers at the moment since it'll activate in spite of their stealth powers (the only exception at the moment being the shape at tier 1).
---
Basically if you see it light up, the killer is coming.
---
Honestly as a P3 Legion main I enjoy new Legion and think they still have strengths over other Killers and are quite fun to play. With that being said they have their low tier list placement for a reason. They still suffer from a lot of problems, primarily in the fact that their power was massively overnerfed to compensate for the moonwalk exploit.
---
You "nerfed" deep wounds so that it wouldn't tick down in the Killer's Terror Radius; this fixes the moonwalk exploit. Why is Legion *also* unable to see blood or scratch marks while using their power and **also** stun themselves for longer after using their power as opposed to pre-rework and [also](/intensifies) run and vault slower than they did pre-rework and [**also**](/intensifies) had all their addons nerfed?!
---
Removing the moonwalk exploit and the "nurse for stupid people" four stab kill was all Legion needed. While some of the changes I do agree with (the increased stun time makes sense since Legion now moves at 115%, and I also kinda agree with the slower movement speed in that regard too [though it does make Legion's power somewhat redundant]) a lot of them feel like massive overkill. Why the fuck can't a CHASE Killer see scratch marks or blood stains? This is such a stupid mechanic that serves no purpose other than making Legion impossible to play. Why does Legion vault windows and pallets practically at the same speed they'd break the pallet with Brutal Strength anyways? Why does Bamboozle **STILL** not block pallets that you vault as Legion?
---
I don't think Legion needs a second rework but they definitely need buffs from their massively overnerfed state after the rework.
---
This would make Karen the first survivor to cause other survivors to rage quit upon seeing her
---
They are now, welcome to the club Legion. :)
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Too funny...been there
---
They* don't care
---
What r u talking about? U go upstairs, vault down and repeat, it is nearly impossible to bloodlast, even worst if they have balance, the pallet isn‚Äôt the best, but the loop is insane.
---
Why are ghost face players always campers
---
Lol you're trying real hard to spin a handicap as an advantage, simply using loops as a crutch aint gonna save you
---
Why not do both?
---
The increased detection range addons are rather useless too, since you don't have any movement speed to get to those people you reveal.
---
Ah gotcha, well now you know lol. I'll stop commenting on this post now. Have a great day man.
---
I thought you meant the cheetos mascot till i clicked
---
I also think the same. I think 25 seconds should be fair
---
no one thinks this is hard to swallow. some of us just dont have fun if over half the killers are no good at ranks above 12.
---
Legion had 3 core problems before their rework. The rework fixed one of them:
---
#**Problem 1 - No reason to chase people normally or break pallets**
---
Well I guess turning Legion into a default Killer is fine. The problem with this change is that while it "fixes" the problem it also completely erases Legion's identity as a Killer. Add in the Deep Wounds change and there's pretty much zero pressure to playing against Legion; just annoyance as you run away from the exact same Killer you always run from.
---
#**Problem 2 - Godawful addons with some of them being way stronger than others**
---
The only difference now is that Stab Wound Study and Frank's Mix Tape are worthless. The button addons are still godawful, the new detection range addons are redundant, duration and cool-down are still king with recharge speed being a cheap alternative. Iridescent Button at least functions now which is nice but it's an Ultra Rare, and Fuming Mix Tape is massively overpriced. You ignored Buttons and took Duration and Cool-Down before, you ignore Buttons and Purple addons and take Duration and Cool-Down now.
---
#**Problem 3 - Annoying to play against**
---
I think this is a problem that Legion can inherently never shake. There are certain Killers (Legion, Doctor, Pig to an extent) who's powers are inherently based on annoying the Survivors and wasting their time. With that being said Legion is probably the worst example since their power *actively harms* the Survivor. Pig has to down people yes but you can heal afterwards, and Doctor has his own separate "Madness" stat which he damages as opposed to your "health." Injuring your health bar as a Survivor and then leaving you injured is extremely obnoxious. Excluding all the synergies with perks that rely on you damaging Survivors (Thanataphobia, Sloppy Butcher, Stridor, Bloodhound) this is a huge kick in the teeth for Survivors who aren't playing with Self Care/Medkits and just generally wastes so much of the Survivor's time playing "M1 simulator." This is further helped by the fact that Legion and Deep Wounds only relies on you holding Mouse 1 with zero skill checks unlike Pig and Doctor, and while Skill Checks aren't much they're at least *something* to keep you *remotely* engaged. Deep Wounds just forces you to hold Mouse 1 for 10 seconds and stick your other hand down your pants in the meantime. There's absolutely zero interactivity which makes Legion feel far more boring to play against as opposed to the likes of Doctor, even though Doc is far more potent at game stall than Legion.
---
-
---
Mind you all these complaints are from a Legion *main* here. I've played a ton of this Killer and have them at P3 and own a good amount of cosmetics for them. But the rework did nothing to help them and simply made them worse.
---
The button addons need reworking and the detection range addons should give speed again. Deep Wounds should also require some skill-based interactions, perhaps to allow you to recover to full health afterwards.
---
Mettle didn't have counterplay and thus wasn't healthy for the game, old DS was the same way.
---
Also you can still get that extra hit "technically" MoM wasn't changed at all, just the conditions to obtain it.
---
If you want that extra hit so badly, bodyblock the killer while a survivor is on shoulder.
---
I wish Legion's Mori had the other three members come out of the shadows and gang bang you. I like Legion's current Mori but there's so much missed potential.
---
Thanks, and have a great day!
---
Bruh moment
---
No, sorry, but that's a horrible stance. Killers that play like this ruin the game for literally everyone they face, and survivors who are competent can still absolutely bully you and tbag anyways. It does nothing but spread toxicity and an unfun experience. Also I enjoy both sides, so I don't feel like depriving myself of half the game for no good reason.
---
Wow, easy there slugger!  
---
By the way is it okay for people to sling around the Q-word, isn't that salt in the wound of the "proud" LGBTQ+ community? Where are your manners!
---
You do, it has happened to me multiple times in the last few days
---
If you're going down anyways you may as well let someone escape in your place. Worst case scenario they can give the Killer a chase and someone can maybe pick you up. Best case scenario you're hooked and they escape, so the status quo doesn't change.
---
If you weren't autistic you would realise i made a typo
---
ye, after 600 hours, I only got 1 comment that says "+rep nice guy" and ye....Guess Im just a nice guy
---
Love when Survivors BM the Killer for playing casual and then complain about the game being too hard when they run into a Killer tryharding next match.
---
That reminded me of the ape boss in Sekiro.
---
A lot for me actually I concur
---
26 minutes to come up with that gem of a comment.
---
Yet another reason to never use Legion's ability and just use em as an M1 lol
---
We need more perk memes like this
---
*"Hey wait a minute!"*
---
I mean it's 100 percent avoidable. It probably doesn't really even help that much other than knowing perks due to how fast paced the game is.
---

Its almost like you have no clue what the chat box included because it was taken down. I didn‚Äôt come to ask the mods to do something. I was just showing what a salty end game chat for I, a gay guy, go through. Nothing more.
---
Me too buddy lol me too
---
I hope it works for you!
---
This is nice. But why do you think that entity is 'he'?
---
I say this to my friends if we have that random potato who has been hiding all game and not doing anything, because my third friend is running bond and has been spying on that dead weight, once hooked we vote unhook or say this, if he dies, he dies fuckem! 
---
But we normally save them for the points because we are greedy. 
---
Unless the killer is camping
---
It bounces from survivor to survivor endlessly until eventually it hits the killer for an instant win.

It‚Äôs called slur reclaiming and since I am a proud queer I can use it.

Yeah it tells you what gens are being worked on and what aren‚Äôt so it‚Äôs like a barbecue that highlights the main objectives, combined with pop goes the weasel it can be really strong
---
Waited 30 mins for a killer match yesterday...ridiculous
---
I have like 6 ebonies on my Doc. I had bad games as survivor so I got pissed and slapped an ebony on. Got in a swf with a rank 8 and 9 and then their poor rank 17 buddy.
---
Can you guess which one I moried first and immediately regretted.
---
Anna oop!
---

---
This seems like an odd place to be preaching about sin and the afterlife considering the nature of this game. I probably commit 2-3 cardinal sins a day as a result of playing it.
---
Stream sniping absolutely should be bannable. How is that not cheating?
---
there‚Äôs no scale of how ‚Äúgood‚Äù a level vs rank is, especially since there‚Äôs rank reset.
---
If you notice it takes him a while to reach t2 then make sure you give him no chances to stalk. Crouch behind barriers, stay behind corners, don‚Äôt stand at pallets or continue doing gens when you see him. 
---
If you have idiot teammates and he reaches t3, just loop him like you would any other killer. He needs to get very close to you to tombstone you, which if you‚Äôre efficiently looping, shouldn‚Äôt happen.
---
You obviously don't care about my feelings or the feelings of the "middle aged white dudes" why should I care about yours?
---
Courtesy is a 2-way street if you want it, learn to give it! You'll be amazed how friendly people are if you don't go from the assumption that everyone is a piece of shit that has it out for you!

---
Sorry, but I don‚Äôt camp much. I do use it when it is works. You can tell when you have an altruistic group that storms hooks. IOW, people not working on gens. 
---
His point was that camping and tunneling CANNOT work and hurts map pressure. I disagree. Throwing away tunneling and camping as a tactic is dumb. Under most cases, it will hurt map pressure, but there are times when it helps. 
---
I was simply pointing out that his absolutism is wrong.
---
Also, you are injecting what is fun and not fun. 
---
When my one friend first caught a survivor after a long chase, she wanted to watch him be sacrificed. That was fun for her. Satisfying. 
---
I have had fun storming a hook with others on my team, rescuing a hooked, camped survivor. That is satisfying. 
---
It is a 1-v-4 game. You can‚Äôt expect each side to always have fun and not be frustrated.

Is the leg hair included or sold separately?

It doesn‚Äôt matter that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt run iron will. Also you don‚Äôt really get nurses on console so I‚Äôm not gonna run a perk to counter 1 killer.

i love how people are telling u to use urban evasion when at that point you will just be a burden 2 ur team
---
Black and Blue is coming for you!
---
Best killer is plague. But discordance, PGTW, and bamboozle are really nice perks too
---
Never understood why trash talk the killers lol I usually get mad at my teammates and or defend the killer when someone is being SUPER toxic.
---
If you did play it, is it completely separate or are they at least carrying over perks and points?
---
Also, even with cross PC and Console play, there will be a major handicap for Console players. If it is just cross console, that‚Äôs not a problem, but playing on PC with a mouse is just so much more accurate for juking, looking around in chases, pulling off hits, and aiming.
---
she was salty in the post game chat
---
But like why were you watching behind you?  There's only one way on that platform
---
Loooool
---
It's one of her ultra rares though and I think having that base kit would make her too similar to the Doctor. I was thinking maybe an action speed debuff.
---
I think it‚Äôs kinda embarrassing that you can‚Äôt tell the difference between wanting someone to care and someone making fun of you. Must be the lack of experience in social interactions.
---
I think that my explanation of how to heal away from generators, which the killer patrols, adequately deals with nurse's calling, and the number of times I see other players refuse to stop healing when a killer who clearly has nurse's calling is nearby is astounding. BBQ is easily avoided as well, unless the killer is also running iron maiden. Sloppy butcher adds time no matter what, so once again my desire to play more cautiously while injured wins out.  While it is possible to interrupt someone from healing me, 9 times out of 10 they follow me to try and finish the job. Not that long ago I actually had someone trap me in the corner that I was destroying the ruin totem in and wouldn't let me leave until I was fully healed no matter how much I gestured and ran in place.
---
I wish I had the same faith in PUGs that you do (or enough time to farm for medkits) but I'm going to continue playing selfishly since I'd rather keep playing a game for longer instead of getting sacrificed right off the bat. Self care is a mediocre perk that means I can rely less on a potentially mediocre team.
---
You have to report it to the streaming service because otherwise they can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre actually getting sniper or not and we absolutely cannot let streamers witch-hunt people otherwise you just get perma‚Äôd cause some streaming dunce got hooked.
---
Lol did everyone forget about the rob zombie remakes? I‚Äôm not talking about the 2019 Halloween.

Oh! The more you know!

Not the Laurie from the 2019 I meant the remake from rob zombie. I don‚Äôt know the exact year I‚Äôd guess 2010?

I agree both sides are. I mainly see the killer become toxic only if the survivors are but occasionally ya get your bad apples. I mean who don‚Äôt love getting t bagged, getting a dead hard into an insta heal and infinite looped...then t bagged some more lol?
---
Infuriated. 
---
This perk activates if you are running for more than 20 seconds
---
It makes your footsteps louder and anything around you is in your earthquake radius making it slide to the left and right a bit except for you. Perk lasts for 10 seconds

Nah these kind of complaints are as old as the game itself.
---
Oh man you smoke weed too!? haha no way brahhhhhhh /s
---
Just seems so pointless.
---
Wow I've been gone for about 8 months and I remember them talking about rank rewards then. You mean they still aren't in the game? I was looking forward to them
---
You know, I‚Äôm something of a raimi-memer myself.
---
Yo that scared my man tiddies right off my chest
---
It annoys me when I have like 90k blood points and I only go up 2 levels
---
Your ping is the amount of milliseconds between when the client (your game) sends info and the server (killer's game currently, dedicated server when they come out) receives the info, or vice versa. 
---
Since the killer's machine also runs the server they experience a zero ping. Once dedicated servers are out the game world itself will be hosted at a middleman dedicated server which means the killer and survivor will experience latency relative to the dedicated server instead of just the survivor experiencing connection issues. 
---
This SHOULD make the game experience more balanced since the survivor won't be held down by the killer's bad WiFi and the killer won't have the opportunity to lag switch since they won't control the connection. You'll only experience as much latency as your WiFi has instead of that plus the killer's connection.
---
Kinda.
---
I respectfully totally disagree. If a certain perk is useful to someone for whatever reason and helps their play style by all means have at it. That‚Äôs what their for
---
Are you sure this isn't a killer?
---
Facts :/
---
There is difference between writing and writing, If I wanted to write like a broken typewriter with sexual insecurities I would write like you. I on the other hand want to make things crystal clear because you obviously need it pre-chewed and easy accessible...
---
karen needs her 3d hair model reworked and retextured.
---
Just take the time to wake yourself up. I‚Äôve run this set up before as Freddy and 2 minutes into the game everyone was awake again. Actually anytime I play Freddy the survivors are constantly waking themselves up while still getting generators done. It really doesn‚Äôt take that long to use the alarm clocks or wake your team mates up.
---
So... the first post I ended with *"That is why mods delete that sort of posts, nothing good comes of it."* was me not commenting on it? Could've fooled me...

Yeah Ignore those fools. Who gives a fuck what they say? They all say the same shit everyone‚Äôs heard a million times anyway lol, nothing ever original.
---
Report them, I dont see the logic here really.... you screw over your team you don't stand much chance of getting out alive. I would have dc'd.
---
Nope. Don‚Äôt even need an ebony. Any secret one will do. Makes them chunk out the gens like crazy (amazing how fast they go when survivors put their minds to it).

Wraith is Z tier without body blocking. (I‚Äôm a Wraith main don‚Äôt be mad).
---
Ok, if I were to list every single thing that have made survivors strong, it would easily eclipse the number of op killer items that have or currently exist. This is fact. You can't, nor will you ever have a longer list of op killer mechanics than I could come up with in survivor mechanics. 
---
Being a master at a primarily mindgame based killer like Spirit doesn't mean you win every game. Some players just won't ever play mindgames or actually use perks like Iron Will as opposed to jusy crying about Spirit, like in your games. I play Doc at rank 6 because BP and having fun is worth more to me than bragging about stomping cocky idiots at rank 1.
---
So get back to me when you're able to get a response from people and *not* collapse into an immature meltdown, k buddy?
---
Thank you. Happens to me almost every time I run both ruin and devour
---
Lol bro you're just a straight up bully, you admit to playing toxic as fuck ruining the game for new players but use your token noob friend as an excuse that your shitty behavior is actually altruistic &amp; ment to teach people how to git gud
---
Bubba is about the easiest killer to play, but not very good. He has little mobility and his chainsaw is a bit too long to charge up. Not to mention the chainsaws just make lots of people play poorly because they try to use the chainsaw exclusively when they could have just smacked someone twice and been done with it already.
---
Alarm clocks can be literally anywhere in the map and waking up teammates is a really good way but it takes up more time every single time someone wakes you up. In other words, time deficiency and not to mention Freddy will almost certainly have found you and hit you either one of you to put you in dream state again after you just woke up.

---
back in reality, I can tell you from experience that you get at least as much toxicity if you dont run moris and refuse to "tunnel."
---
I feel like it'd be even harder to find games and wait times would go up a lot
---
hurr this response tells me exactly why Wraith is not a top tier killer but I'm not gonna read it because then I'd have to acknowledge that I am wrong.
---
So, I should marry a woman I have zero attraction to just to conform to a belief system that has it's own contents interpreted thousands of different ways? I can't wait to live a miserable lie of a life with a miserable wife who lacks true, proper, intimate love, and children who will have to live around that dynamic, all so I can please a being that will likely send me to hell regardless because of me acting on my **envy** of straight people.
---
Cool beans.
---
Yes, because survivors could otherwise just infinitely fast vault a safe window until it's blocked. Currently you can infinitely fast vault a pallet until it's blocked, but pallets can be broken, windows cannot.
---
Real questions needing real answers right here
---
Xavier Woods for survivor
---
Precisely. Still puking all over. 
---
Does calm spirit help with puke noises?
---
But they used oversaturated content....you do realize the shitfest you were insinuating to, was caused by you right?
---
this would be awesome as part of an april fools event
---
Not really. Rank 1 just shows that you played a bunch this month. If you play moderately well it's basically inevitable.
---
See, now that there is funny!  
---
Try to be more like that and less... I want to say PMS-sy but that is going to bring out red flags I'm sure!
---
Lmao yeah right. Iron will had better be basekit
---
It‚Äôs RAW!!!
---
It's nice having some horror movie maps all the little details are great
---
Huntress hatchets possibly?
---
That perk is very hot and cold. On some maps, or on some map areas, its useless. But it can literally be broken in the right area.
---
Chasing a survivor on the Ship can be a nightmare if hes running balanced landing.
---
I just had a game with a couple friends against a hag. Some of her traps were highlighted and visible for us.  
---
Now, we are not sure, how this came to be. Anyone have a suggestion for an addon/perk combination, which made this work?
---
Alright, tell me what's easiest. You have 3 choices.
---
1. Stalking someone as Myers, hoping you dont get spotted, or letting a chase drag on for ages, while trying to tease your tier 3 until it's just right.
---
2. Stalking someone as Ghostface, hoping they dont spot you preemptively and ruin the chances entirely of getting an exposed proc.
---
3. Playing normally, as best you can, and when 5 gens pop, you get a free exposed effect, which can catch all survivors off guard, provided one of 5 totems is still alive and unlit.
---
Looks pretty simple to me, chief.
---
Because they may be new/not very good at playing them optimally, they want the speed boost, they dont run any gen protection perks so they need an extra bump at the end, they are using add ons with Myers that dont let them get past tier 1 or 2, or last but not least they just want to use it and it's in the game so they have every right to use if they wish.
---
How its always been
---
Play until the survivors get all the gens but careful if they are not braindead and destroyed the totems you wont have noed.
---
I'm not saying this as a means to say that "NOED IS OP PLZ NERF KILLER IS OP" Im saying this as i do question why use a perk like NOED when you can swap it for something else since you already have a way to create the exposed status effect.
---
All lockers explode and the killer is stunned for 120/450/970 seconds.
---
Shut up, Francis!
---
I absolutely love distortion! It's probably my favorite perk in the game. Sometimes you get that killer that runs BBQ/Nurses/and Bitter so the tokens go away super fast, but it's still great just to be aware that your aura could be seen and making the killer lose even that little bit of knowledge can help gain you the upper hand.
---
Who cares? It's a simple to counter perk. If you get hit by noed, it's the fault of the 4 survivors.
---
yup, my rank 1 lobbies keep getting filled with at least one rank 10.
---
idk about Clown being weaker than Cannibal, maybe its because all the red rank leatherfaces ive faced are massive facecampers or pallet respectors. But he is just so weak, basically has no power.
---
Yes but Billy's sprint allows him to get hits that bubba can't. Billy also has a bunch of unique mind games that aren't available to bubba. Billy can also curve around objects to get hits on loops. There's a reason billy is a top tier killer and bubba isn't, despite them both having one down saws
---
I Think 1 sounds the easiest to complete a game quicker personally. Granted depends on the rank your at. I'm sure at red ranks 3 would be easiest but I feel like anything above that 1 is easier because with addons its easier to get an exposed proc
---
No, and I abhor the idea that DS is just an anti-tunneling perk. It's perfectly fine how it is
---
Dude, I'm not here to shit on the perk, I'm trying to create a discussion. Because I think there are plenty of other perks you could use that would be more useful to the game
---
You are really REALLY missing the entire reason of not just this post, but our responses to you. Continue to be delusional troll.
---
Thats true, that always is a possibility
---
While you are almost 100% right, I don't believe that deep wounds should let you fully heal afterwards. That would catapult him to horrible tier really quick because one of his main strengths is quickly injuring survivors. If that is gone then only thing he does with his abilitiy is run 10% faster. Should mending have skillchecks? Yeah, make it more dangerous and interactive. His main problem is the addons though. The fact that like only 3 are decent and the rest are either completely pointless or their effect is insignificant says a lot. In my opinion what they should do is:
---
1. More duration. If he can no longer down with his ability it's only natural he should have more map pressure and the ability to ACTUALLY chains hits without the need for a duration addon, right? Legion gets destroyed in large maps or maps with many obstacles like Haddonfield and usually you are only off by a few meters. If they buffed the duration it would be a lot more easy to actually hit more than 2 or 3 people.
---
2. More speed. Not directly. I believe they should just bring back the speed addons and replace those horrid and pointless killer instinct addons.
---
3. Less stun time. Again, not directly. Buff the stun addons. Let's face it, when your stun is 4s, using Cold Dirt only for it to go to 3.5s isn't going to help. If I am paying a lot of BPs for an addon I expect it to give me a noticable benefit.
---
4. Just an addon rework in general. All of his purple addons are useless, maybe except filthy blade? All the pins require two hits to gain any benefit, which both fucks you over and they don't even give anything significant in return. The only good addons are duration, faster power recharge and iri button. They need to overhaul all of them so there is more variety and we can make more builds. Even if they do I still think that duration will 100% need a buff because I will still have to use a slot for a duration addon.
---
5. More interactive for survivors. Make them do skill checks in quick succesion. If they miss the mending either resets or they get downed. I think that missing a skill check resulting in a down will probably be very punsihing for new players but they can always make it an addon you know?
---
6. I've also seen other change suggestions by other people that are more questionable, like considering mending a healing action or missing a hit resulting in losing a bit of your gauge instead of it running out completely but they all seem very hard in my opinion. On the one hand once again he will be a nuisance with little counterplay but on the other hand is it really that bad having more high tier killers in the game? That will be on the dev team to figure and balance out.
---
Is he better than before? I don't know. He is really different now and I didn't see me performing better or worse with pre rework Legion. Both had counterplay in my opinion but if they buff Legion as he is right now then he will be a lot more fun and a lot more viable.
---
The fact that they're four people similar in size to survivors, they have simple paper masks, and they all have modeled faces under their masks. People speculated they'd be a disguise killer who would don the mask to kill, and remove it to deceive. It's possible we would have seen Frank, Julie, Joey, and Susie added as survivors and killers to add to the potential confusion of their ability. Their chapter name was also "Darkness Among Us" with the four killers making up letters of the chapter text. Implying that those four would be the darkness (killers) among us (the survivors).
---
The trailer even helps that theory as it's literally two "survivors" running from a threat, only for Frank to don the mask when they're close in an enclosed area and kill David. 
---
They might have scrapped the idea late into development as it must not have been very effective, especially if their turned out to be no franks, julies, joeys, or susies on the survivor team, making the disguise useless. Also SWF and discord could easily invalidate such a power.
---
Honestly what should happen in a perfect world is when you report someone in a game, a recorded copy of the match is sent alongside it. What this does is let people show with visual/timestamped proof of what goes on. 
---
Now even in a perfect world the game cannot punish someone for you being matchmade with someone else, but what you could do is report someone griefing you over and over, and then add a ‚ÄúDo Not Play With/Against‚Äù function where when you block someone the game either boots them from you as killer or continues to search for another lobby that doesnt have your blocked killer.
---
It can be used on every map  except one. Its basically two perks because you get the intial sprint burst and then when you are still recovering you get the reduced fall buff so whem you drop off a high structure you can keep going
---
Whats so hard about people being decent and not letting someones sexuality bother them? I can have my name be whatever I want it to be as long as its not TRULY offending someone. Please carry on.
---
I guess it depends on the situation. I am far more likely to "camp" or "puppy guard" when a previous hook has shown that they are either SWF or have very altruistic teammates, just because I know someone is probably already around the hook looking to get smacked or pulled off. Alternatively, letting them get the unhook and the heal will keep two people from doing gens while you go off and stop progress or find someone else to smack or down completely. 
---
Personally, if by the third hook I've barely moved away and they get unhooked immediately then hell yes I'm gonna turn my big butt around and take them out again.
---
so i can kill people
---
**Camera Blurs**
---
I‚Äôm gonna be honest I actually like this a lot.
---
Why would we want to buff head on?
---
Noooo new DS is amazing, they change they did was perfect, and took 2 years leave it alone
---
Sometimes I completely forget about haste, not having ruin, overcharge, pop goes the weasel etc... Makes sense, those Myers addons are fun af, I'm fine with people using NOED As infuriating as it can be sometimes, but I think that other perks could be used when you already have a means to get an exposed status effect
---
I've not seen a Billy get a successful curve attack at my rank
---
But you can't kill people with NOED?
---
It‚Äôs very situational, it‚Äôs rather amazing and causes infinite‚Äôs or there‚Äôs 2 places it can actually be used, it‚Äôs map specific.
---
My advice would be to get all the teachables you want before you level up your killers past level 40 because the blood webs get bigger and it‚Äôs harder to get the perks you want
---
I use this perk all the time. Not only does it let you work on a far off gen in peace but it‚Äôs a great way to fish out information on what aura reading perk the killer brought.
---
The only one I'd actually like yo see is the I'd lile to speak to the devs
---
Imagine using sjw unironically
---
Yeah, i Just use It for fun, i don't care to play good or to win against all odds. Still, i act useful for my team and do generatore and i loop the killer anyways if necessary
---
I love when I see these post cause it‚Äôs anything but weak it‚Äôs a strong perk already and everyone ignores the fact how it can be abused if stacked with others.
---
Tunneling Killer detected
---
Just use a Swiss Army knife like everybody.
---
Pretty much, in an ideal world addons shouldn't just be direct power upgrades they should change your playstle in a decently sized way such as micheal. The problems with nurses addons really comes down to how her addons used to work. They were ALL good before they changed her addons in the first place, the problem was they were too strong so they nerfed the hell out of all of them. Pretty much the only addon that didn't get hell scorced were her range addons and a single of her extra blink addon, it still got nerfed but wasn't ruin.  
---
Now people complain because the addons she does have are decent and the nurse is already very strong baseline. This creates a conflict of interest because 99% of survivors want nurse to be a worthless pile of garbage because she forces them to change their usual playstyle and they don't like that. Granted winning in a chase against an equally skilled nurse is unlikely, THAT IS HOW ITS SUPPOSED TO BE. You as a singular survivor shouldn't EVER be on equal footing as a killer. Its pretty simple math 1&lt;4 so the four must be weaker individually to compensate. Problem is most survivors refuse to acknowledge this and just want to win 100% of the time.
---
What are you saying? I‚Äôm genuinely confused? Why will more people have an instant stun and also be alive? DS only last 60 seconds after being unhooked, you don‚Äôt get it again if you don‚Äôt utilize it after being unhooked the first time. If you‚Äôre saying a full team having DS then yes, take the stun and continue chasing that person or move on to the next. DS is not a game breaker, you can still get a 4K with 12 hooks even with everyone having DS. It‚Äôs not impossible.
---
This bug has been going on for so long, with so much documented evidence on this subreddit alone. Have BHVR even acknowledged it yet? 
---
Hopefully it‚Äôs being addressed. Despite not being particularly common it forces someone to lose the game
---
My general train of thought is that if survivors aren't going to hold back on their builds, there's no reason the killer should have to either, and in the cases where the survivors are gonna use said builds to disrespectfully bully and treat the killer like a clown... they deserve their comeuppance.
---
Once played against a legion who never used their power, asked them why they didn't use their power and they told me "it doesn't down people so it sucks but I like how the legion looks" was very confused the whole game
---
I was playing pig and was down to a nea and a claude and the nea dc'd so claude could get hatch and i wanted to cry
---
Don't change whats not broken
---
it leads to killing them
---
I run NOED, Tremors, Bitter Murmurs, and I‚Äôm All Ears. 
---
Tremors for that generator defense, and you can tell which gens are currently being worked on
---
Bitter Murmurs for that information and knowing exactly where survivors will flee to when they finish a gen
---
I‚Äôm All Ears to catch fleeing survivors off guard and chase better.
---
Noed + Murmurs = When the Gens are done, I can attempt to full sweep the survivors because I know where they are and I can get a fairly accurate read on where they intend to go. 
---
If I don‚Äôt run NOED I run Whispers for the map awareness and to counter people who do nothing but hide the entire game.
---
How is an 8 second reduction good at all bro?
---
They aren't getting it back in chases, so what difference would it make to buff this perk lol?
---
Your theory that is "abusing" this perk literally requires all 4 survivors to be within 8 meters of one another. You're kind of asking to be found and killed that way.
---
His perk Weast shows the killer the auras of survivors that are Weast of the killer

Okay, for starters, what you said is not an argument

Secondly, *my* argument is survivor biased. I'm arguing against it being nerfed. How is that something a tunneling killer main would say?
---
Maybe I didn't express myself well?
---
Nice straw man. How is lithe and sprint burst (which doesn't make sense) in any way the same as Myers with NOED?

If NOED spawns it means the survivors did not cleanse all the dulls. It doesn‚Äôt matter if cleansing dulls wastes time that could be spent doing gens at all. If you really don‚Äôt like NOED, you should do the counter instead of saying it needs a nerf or that it‚Äôs OP/needs you to have lost the game.
---
Survivors logic is baffling tbh. And exactly like you said why leave when all four targets are right in front of you? Oh excuse me you're all here? Sure let me go to the other side of the map to kick a gen and destroy a pallet while the four of your complete 2 gens by the time I find you again.

I don‚Äôt self care in the corner of a map. I can‚Äôt loop if I start the chase injured becauss I‚Äôll commit to the gen until the killer is close to me (unless I hear Spirit‚Äôs phasing). I don‚Äôt get off the gen if I hear the heartbeat so I get injured getting off the gen sometimes.
---
Monday: T-posing
---
Yea! I was shaking because I gave her a drawing I did of her and she was so taken aback by it and hugged me because of it!
---
Youre right, they should.
---
Thank you! ^^
---
It still wastes the killer's time regardless and gives the survivor an actual chance to escape after getting unhooked. I don't think there is any "dumb" way to use the new DS.
---
I see that you're going for a more endgame type build which is understandable, I still think that using your power effectively would make it so that there's no need for NOED wouldn't you agree?
---
So...Only two matchs equals to "THE WHOLE SURVIVOR COMUNNITY IS CUCKED"?
---
When I think kill, I think Mori, it leads to sacrificing
---
I've been playing the game on and off for two years. This is but one of *many* occasions.
---
Again, nice straw man. Your original argument is for 1 hit killers with noed. I am curious as to why you believe it is a bad idea. You are comparing perks that make 0 sense to something that is viable and fine if someone wishes to use it. Stop giving yourself an easy conversation.
---
Sorry can‚Äôt relate. I‚Äôve gone against red ranks who use DS and I never find it detrimental to my game. I just take the stun and find them again and now they can‚Äôt do shit except take the hook. Games change so quickly, I just don‚Äôt stress about it. 90% of the time I get a 4K. Red rank survivors aren‚Äôt Gods, DS &amp; BT can only do so much for them.
---
You usually keep the items/addons but the offering seems to be lost sometimes and sometimes not, it's really weird
---
Or you could not be a shitty killer. So fuck you and your toxicity, whiny ass bitch.
---
Ruin is there to get destroyed. It's never meant to last forever. It's only meant to stall the gen progression for a little while at the start while you're looking for survivor.
---
Boohoo downvotes boohoo.
---
The best reply ever
---
yeah let me go instantly down all four people, you are apart of the fucking problem
---
We get it. You‚Äôre a fag that wants him shirtless.
---
you'll probably be fine
---
Depends who you play. Nurse i can 4k every game but nurse gets old after 3 years.
---
just run perks like self care so you dont need to rely on your teamates
---
Running away to heal is even worse... You are wasting EVEN more time just to heal yourself, sloppy butcher and all other anti heal perks are all percentage based, meaning self care is exponentially affected more than standard healing.
---
I'm not gonna argue against your playstyle, but whether you know it or not, if you play like this all the time you probably are the sole cause of lots of survivor losses for survivor teams. In other words, you're one of the bad teammates people joke about all the time.
---
You are apart of the toxicity problem
---
I think survivors need a couple buffs, but yeah there's a lot of people who don't know what they're doing
---
Haha thats awesome i hope i can meet her as well. Hopefully she hangs it up somewhere!
---
Were they a No Mither sabo squad?
---
They have room for it. They just choose not to run it.
---
I hope so! Also meeting her was definitely worth it all! Still kind of freaking out about it because she was just so down to earth and kind!
---
This was his 3rd hook, i think he must have known the killer is Ghostface by then.
---
Would be way too situational and doesn't provide a very good boost to begin with, since during egc all you do is patrol the exit gates until A. The timer runs out, or B. You chase the survivor and they die via sacrifice or timer. There are other perks that are way better to be used as they show good use overall and the situational ones provide a bigger boost, this would prolly fall under D or F tier
---
Also Billy
---
I do like the idea of switching between the different members, with all the ones you're not in control with either being stationary or doing something minimal (kinda like Spirit). This might make survivors second-guess which one you actually are and it can be a great mind-trick to pretend you're one of them when in fact you are another. Also be great for chases in cutting them off if you know one of the members is near them, which will catch them by surprise.
---
Just wonder in terms of cosmetics if you could outfit them all in some way.
---
I know XD Doc mains dont like their gens being done as it is
---
I do that but there is still only so much you can do when its all purple toolboxes with brand new parts and shit. Franklins would have also been good but I didnt have it so I just had to do the best I could do
---
Because I feel like green items are rare then purple. I know they aren't. Also most killers bring Franklin's anytime they see a map in the lobby.
---
Like this?
---
https://www.ebay.com/itm/Womens-Columbia-Pink-Sleeveless-Full-Zip-Vest-Size-Small-/223313277602
---
Well per game you get 4 survs that could be toxic and/or 1 killer so by default survivors will have more chance of havimg toxic ones
---
Myers is a different story, NOED on Myers is probably just lack of a better perk or cutting corners and not using your power.
---
that perk gives me a headache
---
I don‚Äôt think any item is that bad if you run Franklin‚Äôs
---
ngl if i was playing bubba id have gone out of my way to murder you. i need that sweet youthful face
---
I can see how viable it can be on a ghost face now, his power is a bit tricky but with a smart team I can see why NOED IS Useful
---
was she picked up at like 1 second of decisive left?
---
i thought that was a tortilla at first lol
---
140k bloodpoints is almost nothing. Spending a million gets you somewhere. Though only going from p3 1 to p3 max perks is 9 million bloodpoints
---
This is why you should use headphones. You can hear grass moving as soon as you looked away.
---
Yeah back when I played on console I have had it happen to me I believe it had something to do with me getting hit while balance landing was activating. Seen it as a killer too when I hit someone as they start to sprint burst. Its very uncommon to see tho and I never had it happen to me on pc.
---
Haha, that‚Äôs me some games. 
---
I intentionally get chased though.
---
A LOT of games I loop the killer around for 5+ minutes and only 1 gen gets done. Those games are the worst.
---
I do use them I just didn‚Äôt think he was literally right next to me
---
What's the best killer on console then? I'm assuming spirit
---
Literally the only funny thing ive seen with this meme
---
That's actually a solid strat I've never thought of.
---
It's really balanced, actually. Windows get blocked after 3 runs, and Survivors who don't get the fast vault off get punished for doing a medium vault, making them slower through the window (possibly killing them) and doing a sound notification. It rewards good players, punishes poor ones on the side of survivor. (In a similar fashion to how if a killer incorrectly runs a loop, or makes a bad read, they get punished by losing distance on them- making the chase longer, which can cost the game, if they don't lose the survivor entirely.)
---
The hiding behind a gen thing doesn't work on me. The gen aura is a much darker red than survivor auras and as such, I see a blob of bright red behind gens everytime my BBQ goes off.
---
Low-key I kinda like this
---
Just report them for saying mean things it‚Äôs what i do
---
It‚Äôs tough out there in the fog
---
It's also good to run a Rainbow Map with the Glass Bead if you're a solo survivor. Run that with Prove Thyself and you have fellow survivors swarming to you like flies on honey.
---
When I‚Äôm soloing I usually don‚Äôt give a free kill, but if it‚Äôs a true baby killer I decide to let them kill me because I feel bad
---
Yeah, same here. I feel bad for them
---
Does she know about Miss Piggy and DbD?
---
My issue with it is that it can be used to find survivors. If you‚Äôre not in a chase and you notice your charge building up you‚Äôll know a survivor is nearby. 
---
Also there wouldn‚Äôt really be much counterplay towards that. The survivor‚Äôs options would be to either leave or continue hiding, and both kinda screw them over. If you try to leave you run the risk of being caught, and if you hide you‚Äôll build his charge and he‚Äôll eventually find you. 
---
Another thing is if the killer notices that his charge isn‚Äôt building up anymore he‚Äôll know a survivor left and he‚Äôll leave the area and chances are the survivor would be stuck in the same situation again.
---
Sorry if I‚Äôm overthinking it, but these just popped into my head imagining I‚Äôm playing against this
---
or the game
---
In their defense, they never said that a chapter has to have all of those. Yes that's what it's been so far, but unless I missed something, they never said 'Chapter must be Killer + Survivor + Map'
---
I didn‚Äôt ask her about miss piggy because i was starstruck, but I know someone else did and she wishes she was involved! She loves amanda young and would have loved to been involved! Another Quentin situation I believe.
---
Ah yes the autohaven map that has the basement underneath the exit gate
---
No problem! Tbh I really enjoyed playing Bubba as well, so it's quite the shame that he's so bad. Luckily, the devs did mention recently they would be looking into him next.
---
Good luck!
---
Short answer: No. 
---
Longer answer: The amount of BM that would come with that is unneeded. Interesting idea if they do a two killer mode where one killer mori‚Äôs the other but not in the current game.
---
I think the Entity is more of a "the"
---
It

Did you hit her with a pallet so that she would make the cute squek

The Entity would be a they or an it. The nature of the Entity is separate from gender as it's an eldritch monstrosity outside human comprehension. You'd use a neutral because the gender binary doesn't apply to the limitless
---
No she had NOED because my heart was exposed as soon as I saw her. ü•∫
---
Not now that mettle just got fucking destroyed
---
When your billy it doesnt matter anyways when your sprinting across the map probably why i only run it on him
---
This is GREAT!!!! Thanks for posting, OP!!!!!
---
Unfortunately not. :(
---
We get stuck with the dark and edgy emo Freddy.
---
Theres two ways of playing one is playing like a cunt and the fun way.
---
For me dbd is always about fun. I go Hook somebody and find my next Target. The fun for me lies in the chase. Its not fun for me standing right next to the hook nodding at a survivor and staring at the Hooked ones' face. It isnt fun for me, the survivor or the other survivors. So why do it?
---
To rank up and get rank rewa.... oh, yeah. Nah. Also more chases = more bloodpoints. Win for me.
---
I just cant understand how people have the tenacity to just stop giving a fuck and circling the hooked one for 90s.
---
Maybe some people can Tell me. I'm there for fun not for being a cunt to other PEOPLE.
---
It‚Äôs raw, you‚Äôre fucked.
---
I‚Äôve picked up the last survivor as he crawled around, walked to the hatch... then kept walking and hooked him bc his whole team was such a pain in my butt. 
---
Though sometimes I let them go. I show mercy bc I have been shown mercy, but not all are worthy.
---
No0b3 in a nutshell.
---
It's Meg, Dwight, and Claudette who have the L4D cosmetics.
---
Billy is a strong killer, leatherface is just a retard with a very weak power. So yeah, i prefer getting a leatherface
---
Did you actually read the post?
---
The other three survivors were literally stood next to it.
---
So you have to look at the trap before you can teleport to it and it lights up from Red to White. I kinda wish it could have a miniature ‚ÄúFreddy Arrow‚Äù for more clarity, but once you use it, it gets easier to notice.
---
Exactly she‚Äôs more of a feral animal tbh
---
So funny!
---
Don't just say survivors, it's just salty people being sucks. Killers do it too.
---
Noed bad adrenaline good /s
---
But if they do bones then they won't have time to gen rush
---
r/fuckkarenposters
---
Hit them? And get into a chase? If they were to stand next to it Down them.
---
Every set will still run it.
---
The meta would change with 2 guys running DS, Dead Hard, Adreniline, and Me First! While the other two run Borrowed Time. That way there is about a 50/50 chance that the killer is screwed in his first chase which is the most important chase in the entire game while still having people with BT for saves.
---
Decisions, Decisions, what to do?
---
well you can normally just hear where the survivor runs so its only really annoying when you mess up and get stunned while picking up a survivor
---
Do totems, nerd
---
I did, because they were idiots and kept walking into a chainsaw
---
I'll agree that overly altruistic groups kinda force you to camp.  Also, I get that it's not always gonna be fun.
---
I'm also not always gonna play when it's not fun.
---
*proceeds to run down the street while laughing like a maniac*
---
Glad I could help.
---
They should stop doing it badly
---
The way the plague struts across the map like royalty, KNOWING she's the baddest bitch in the trial... we have no choice but to stan.
---
Dont apologise, youve made good points and this was a big aspect of his power which I completely forgot to include.
---
The killer wouldnt receive the charge unless they found a survivor, so they wouldnt see their charge building up and would not be able to use their power as a way of knowing if there are survivors nearby. 
---
Upon finding a survivor, youd receive the charge from having them in your terror raidus. But the charge gained from survivors being near you would be very small compared to every other method you could gain it. 
---
But I think youre right about lack of counterplay. The killer is meant to force survivors into a stealthy play style, so having him receive charge when he's not in chase wouldnt fit his kit.
---
Distortion is good, I run it sometimes, A lot of information and don't have to get off a gen if they have bbq
---
A multiple body killer would be very cool. Maybe a 1 mind (backstory could possibly be conjoined twins who were cut in half, the entity brought in both bodies but only 1 soul) controlling 2 bodies, and can switch between them with a cooldown. Each would emit a 20m terror radius regardless of whether they are active or not, but the controlled body would have lit eyes (an add on could make it so eyes remain unlit for x seconds after switching, allowing for spirit like mind games).
---
They would probably be weak in chases so maybe each body could get a different secondary ability too.
---
The killer dies and all living survivors instantly escape
---
Bro flake is the killer. His deal is he kills everyone who doesn't believe in our god emperor Donald Trump.
---
yeah and because of that we got ugly ass quentin instead of the 2nd most iconic final girl in horror history
---
It's honestly the only map that I end up wishing I had deja vu
---
Yup...they're there! Just look in the customize section for the characters! They are for Dwight, Meg, Jake, and Claudette!
---
Kyle
---
I love seeing rank 7 and below have that token rank 20. Really shows that they are trash and need easy killer to feel good about themselves.
---
That calls for a ebony Mori
---
How could you not at that rank. Survivors practically hopk themselves, lol =P
---
Always feels good though!
---
...is it like that all over?
---
Yup. I have my p3 stuff for Dwight, all the Head Case and Charity Case stuff, and the Hallowed Blight stuff for Claudette, but absolutely no L4D stuff for either of the 4.
---
I've only been playing for a month now, and I love the game, I'm just barely good at it.  I've bought a few DLC, with plans on more.  I play on PS4 and one of the trophies is to escape through a gate in the dying state, so that's what I figure people are trying to accomplish there.  I also need that trophy but I barely ever see an exit gate :(
---
They closed the hatch,which makes you open the gates.
---
More like a Xenomorph IMO.
---
Insanely clever, and able to figure out things there's no way she should be able to figure out.
---
Killer shit the hatch that triggers endgame collapse which means you gotta exit via the gates
---
\*laughs in Skyrim\*
---
This is basically some other post but instead of wraith it's Michael
---
Great job! Congrats!!!
---
hi front page
---
Arguments? Yeah, you got none.
---
"What do you look for in a killer...'s shoulders?"
---
Not saying it will, but being toxic back certainly doesn't help.
---
Thank you so much
---
im flattered
---
hillbilly 100% spirit is just boring and unfun to play against
---
Oh my god I jumped too holy shit
---
Survivors are entitled to bring anything they want. 
---
Killers are entitled to use any add ins they want. 
---
It's part of the game. 
---
You as the killer can see what they are bringing in before the match starts so why not bring your moris, or tinkerer or another perk to monitor gen progress. 
---
Sorry but there are ways around it.
---
Im saying that playing the game is more fun than standing at a survivor on the hook. And if they were downed immediately everytime because you had a chainsaw you werent a) in fear of looking the game and b) in need of seeing that Person dying. So I repeat: I'd rather have fun in chases as a Killer than stare at them dying.
---
Sitting there not doing anything and waiting for the Person on the hook to die is boring for YOU, the hooked one and people having empathy for the one on the hook.
---
So tell me Are you lying about them being bad and "running into your chainsaws" or Are you someone that enjoys to ruin other peoples gaming experience and possible yours too?
---
Because in the First Variant securing a kill at the end of the Match is okay. The second one i'm 100% on the survivor side and say you're playing like a cunt.
---
You seem triggered. I‚Äôm going to leave it here. Cheers for the laughs
---
What perks did you normally take to reach rank 1?
---
Tell me one per that can get rid of all tokens within a minute
---
Just shut the fuck up already.
---
that not freddy that a legal knockoff of a 1980's horror movie character
---
I like the idea of a double DS but make the 2nd skill check significantly harder and cut the 1 min time window in half
---
This was really funny even though the grammar and misspelling kept taking me out of it.
---
What did you do to displease the entity for that totem placement?
---
Ohhhh
---
That is so strange! I'm sorry!
---
You seem like the type of idiot that comments "gh ez" when the killer got a 4k
---
I run NOED in case I don't get a 3k before the gates open. I can pull a 2k off in most matches, so I run NOED to get an extra kill before someone escapes which is why I run a mostly end game build (Rancor, NOED, Remember Me)
---
Who wouldn't?
---
From what we see of the Entity it's just a creature no gender or anything just a genderless Eldritch abomination so it's a IT. I believe people say she probably because it seems like it.
---
That's been my experience on PS4, at least. When I first started playing a few months ago, I would frequently observe teammates repeatedly squatting in front of killers (what my friends and I eventually dubbed "the killer dance"). More often than not, the killer wouldn't rake their faces, and that teammate would then go on to be a stool pigeon for the killer, body blocking the rest of us, sabotaging our efforts, etc. I don't see it as much anymore, but I still see it.
---
Adrenaline is already one of the most used perks in the game. It doesn't need to have a built in counter, to the perk that counters it
---
Killer killer = killer ^2
---
With all my efforts, i got to rank 3 just to get a nice fat  ebony to make everyone de pip and give 18 k to the killer
---
&gt; cut the 1 min time window in half
---
The problem isn't the time, the problem is how it keeps going even after the killer hooked different people.
---
When the Killer Killer everyone.......
---
Upvote.
---
Definetely nurse and Billy in a 2v4. God damit i hate Spirits.
---
Killer Killer
---
Hey ‚Äúliver‚Äù alone.
---
Liver, l-liver it was a joke.
---
It's magic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Understandable, really.
---
Mate I can think of at least 9 perks that are better to run on Spirit than Stridor and are actually somewhat justifiable in complaining about.
---
Complaining about Stridor of all perks is just hilarious.
---
It happens most games so i doubt Thats why but if it is I've helped a lot of people lol. If you really want the achievement you could probably easily get it by playing in a party or just hiding in a locker by the gate when the gens are about to be done and then just. Standing at the end. 
---
Which is literally one of the points i was bitching about but i think there's a special exception for achievement hunting lol
---
To be fair, the doctor is a cunt anyways
---
Alexa, nerf Stridor
---
A+ for effort!!
---
Pay attention to the player status at the bottom. You‚Äôre hiding when the killer is in a chase with someone else which is a huge waste of time
---
Definitely a male....ya see that junk?
---
I have no damn idea.
---
can't wait to download these once I get home!
---
I‚Äôm guessing you don‚Äôt play much survivor.
---
You cap at rank 4? Hell I sit pretty around 7 lol
---
They're playing normally you fucking retard, using toolboxes isnt toxic, you wanting them to get face camped for using an in game item is toxic
---
The last one would be so broken you could just leave so you don‚Äôt de pip
---
It means you lost the game of find the hatch.
---
*For dwight,
---
I don‚Äôt want to sound like a dickhead but that just sounds like you can‚Äôt stop gens and put pressure on so you resort to using perks that are useless for the entire game apart from the part when you are close to a loss. That‚Äôs not optimal play, but it is a strat that works so you do you, i guess
---
No it's experience from playing. Billy is a better killer because of the ability to curve and mindgame and map pressure. Bubba is just an m1 killer mainly
---
Yeah, I just submitted a ticket so I guess I'll see where that goes. Thanks for the help though!
---
Everybody is running other bloodpoint increasing perks too, even the killer
---
I think it may just be a UI bug, similar thing happens to me when I play killer vs a survivor with boil over, and the icon stays there for the rest of the match.
---
Your point makes no sense. The objective is to kill all of the survivors before they finish doing gens and escape. If nobody is doing gens and they‚Äôre all in the same location, what value is there in walking away? Why do you have to hinder your ability to win and make up for their poor decisions in order to not be a ‚Äúcunt‚Äù?
---
I ran: Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Self Care when I ran out of medkits, Head on and Quick and Quiet. Honestly to me perks dont really matter, it‚Äôs all just in what you like.
---
Also
---
‚Ä¢ Survivor that came out with them isn‚Äôt even in their trailer even though he comes from the same place they do
---
[https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8118459/Group_photo_1.jpg](https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8118459/Group_photo_1.jpg)
---
Bro Flake also has a perk where if a survivor breaks ruin they are put into the dying state and their location is revealed.
---
Nurses calling can eat tokens pretty fast but that‚Äôs about it
---
That's why, as a killer, I just stalk the building that has the basement as I just want that dman trophy for hooking x number of people in the basement.  Once I get that, I'll go back to just hooking survivors wherever and just motoring back on my route.  Also, I barely see survivors and when I do, I barely can hit them so I patrol my three gens and hope for the best.  
---
It would be nice to be part of a crew but I barely get to play for an hour and super late, like 11pm to midnight, so I imagine it'll be pretty hard to get people together.
---
I thought the third ability was kill the killer.. but thats fine I guess
---
I tried my best :(
---
She is the one that is getting the most votes on least enjoyed to play against.
---
Also, this poll is getting more answers than the last two, sadly.
---
That‚Äôs the point you gibbon.
---
actually Stridor is good only if survivors have Iron Will, otherwise is fuckin' awful because you came out of hauting way too early/late thinking the survivor is close by when they're actually miles away
---
Hey, if it works...
---
Unless they don't know how to gen tap properly too.
---
I didn't say they aren't allowed it's just fucking annoying
---
Did you even read the topic?
---
Let me break it down:
---
I down survivor 
---
I hook survivor 
---
All three others show up and start trying to unhook *before I've even left*
---
I stay there and stop them, downing one in the process.
---
In what world am i supposed to just fuck off and let them unhook? It's not my job to ensure survivors "have fun", if you dont want to end up on a hook, try harder not to get downed.
---
If you're on a hook and your teammates are swarming it while the killer is still there, *they* are fucking you over, not the killer.
---
Because the Objective of Videogames is to relax and have a Good time. And that goes for every Single Person out there. If you're not enjoying your time why Play then? If its Are Chore?
---
Is it hard to grasp the idea of having fun?
---
Very few people hide in lockers, damaging gens still does less for a Killer than working on one does for a coordinated team provided the kicked one is tended to, and he's still visible while "cloaked." The speed boost is very small and he gets no chase effect without coming out.
---
If we're counting items, though, genrushing is way stronger or mass hatch escapes are possible, so just having to pan the camera to find him isn't so powerful an advantage. Wraith is somewhat competent, especially at lower ranks or when well-equipped, but to say he's OP is suggesting you'd rather deal with Billy or even Spirit.
---
Yeah I mainly play survivor but it's just not fun for me anymore. Killer is way more enjoyable tbh.
---
No. What if the person that saves you is injured? Then they down them right when they unhook you. All the killer has to do is hook them and then just go for you. Plus it'll just make killers camp you more. Doesn't really solve tunneling tbh.
---
 DS is annoying to me but it's in a good spot as it is.
---
The most important part of the cosplay, to be honest.
---
A LITTLE weak?!  He‚Äôs imo the worst killer in the game rubbing shoulders with wraith.  They should rework his power absolutely, atm it‚Äôs garbage.
---
Respond with a classic : " WHAT DID U SAY TO ME U LITTLE SHIT ?!?!? "
---
B for presentation
---
How is letting all the gens get done and the doors opened for free downs a skill based perk? LOL
---
It can open up way more loops that use dropdowns such as the game and the chapel and the asylum
---
the perk would be actually better if it has more tokens
---
Unfortunately it would be difficult to determine real lag from lag switching. However, dedicated servers should eliminate the problem as any attempt to lag switch when not the host would result only in the player lagging.
---
Watch a McLean vod, the last stream he did someone asked about it and he clarified
---
You mean default dwight?
---
Oh all three of them, even better! I'm very jealous, Saw is one of my favorite horror franchises
---
I now assert that no Killers should be "M1 Killers" then, as an entire playable character NEEDING certain perks is bad. Especially when characters apparently are valued at about $7 a pop.
---
Killing idiot survivors absolutely is fun. It may not be your idea of fun, but that doesn‚Äôt mean that it can‚Äôt be anybody else‚Äôs.
---
I am 100% having a good time by smacking survivors around and stopping them from winning.
---
Again, you are responsible for your own good time.
---
Okay. Imagine the following. You go ahead and Pickel up the Person on the ground safely and get them on a hook. = MORE BP, more emblems.
---
They wouldve swarmed the other hook too, right?
---
I‚Äôm gonna meet her in October!
---
I only had money to see one but seeing them in person was still a cool experience!
---
Definitely worth it!

yeah but it crosses a line the moment you bring no mither and self care as your only perks.
---
&lt;33
---
Except that leaves two people at the first hook, which i could also down because they kept trying to unhook and getting hit.
---
Why the fuck is it my job to accommodate stupid players?
---
Maybe you can win the game of ‚ÄòOpen the gates and escape before the killer gets you‚Äô
---
You Are not smacking them. If you were they wouldve been downed. You Sat there doing nothing.
---
You can, they just have to be funny
---
I‚Äôm all about some good plays, but in the future can you please rephrase that? Saying it like that isn‚Äôt very cool imo
---
How dare you
---
So you had all 4 Down?
---
True, but if the killer sees you were the one to do it, you're fucked lol.
---
Yea Billy is better. I think the way they could easily nerf billy is if they just make it so you can‚Äôt turn at all when using the chainsaw.
---
I got one hooked and downed one, other two ran off and I hooked second dude. First dude had like next to no time left before entity so he died.
---
 Weird. I was pretty confused cause id be doing gens and itd just be there even if there was no one near me. Lol.
---
Smooth
---
You're welcome!!!! Hope it works out and you get yiur cosmetics!!Sorry I couldn't be more help!
---
Oh shit. I didn't know Jake had one.
---
Rephrase that lol? Really? Is it really that big of a deal you gotta comment? And I‚Äôm not trying to be cool lol...it was just an opinion. Who cares? Smh...wow.
---
Sadly no
---
I've waited five minutes on PS4, finally got the game to match me, and then it loaded the trial to just take me back to the campsite due to someone disconnecting.  So irritating!  I just want to play my one game of as a survivor, then another as a killer, for my bonus points each, and then hopefully a third time to try for my third daily.
---
Whats the other perks in your build?
---
I played a lot of Legion during the Anniversary Event (over 50 matches), here is a change I would like to see:
---
* Allow me to activate Frenzy at any time during the bar recharge. If this is too strong, perhaps at 50%. A lot of times I wanted to use a healthy survivor just to proc Killer Instinct and I found myself just following someone until the bar was filled.

He's too embarrassed to be seen dancing with his mom
---
I've gotten much better at the game since last night. Got 3 wipes as Killers (2 as Pig, 1 as Hillbilly) and gotten about 6 escapes
---
Lol you‚Äôre all good, not many people know him by his name. I was going to welcome you to the Cult but I‚Äôm glad to hear you‚Äôve already seen some of them :)
---
How to get a lot of bloodpoints in a Match? 
---
Ya know, there's those Iridescent badges, but most of the time I only get one/two per match. Getting chased, doing gens, helping others and escaping altogether seems overwhelming. Any tips fot that?
---
&gt;Wil Dbd ever make dedicated servers?
---
If you searched for "dedicated servers" using the search bar, you would be mind blown.
---
Those fucking snares are broken. You can literally just keep placing them with no reloading or speed debuff like clown.
---
:c
---
Yayyyy!
---
Ikr who names a child waylon
---
That's stupid
---
Agreed. His kit is fine but there needs to be a delay in placing traps, a movement speed decrease, or at minimum it takes you out of bloodlust
---
I don't really think it fucks trapper. Trapper mains are predictable with placing traps. I also don't see very many survivors using this perk. A lot of them use adrenaline, dead hard, self care, and iron will.
---
As a killer main, it pains me to say this but just finish the gen. It puts the pressure back on me. 
---
I‚Äôll also say that survivors must have no idea how many I‚Äôve killed by baiting them into unhooking. If they knew how dangerous it was they‚Äôd just leave. If you leave it to the last second to get a clutch unhook you‚Äôre going to get smoked. The killer will be able to predict exactly where you‚Äôre going to be
---
* Video submissions from new accounts are not allowed in /r/deadbydaylight, due to self-promotion spam. 
---
You are not a clown. You are the entire circus.
---
We all have been saying the same thing..
---
Clown's perks are top tier to stop looping and generators, except clownphobia,, and his bottles can be thrown to slow survivors, deny areas, and shut down loops fast AF. Good killer, but needs a bit of skill to use effectively.
---
Legion is actually pretty damn great if used effectively. His power lets him locate survivors and chase easier, and can inflict survivors with a deep wound effect, making them waste their time healing it away. If you stab everyone, and use a combination of "Sloppy Butcher" (Slows healing) and "Thanatophobia" (slows everything a bit for each injured, dying or dead survivor), you can make them waste a ton of time healing, and make rounds downing and hooking them before they can finish mending/healing themselves.
---
Plague is ok.
---
And it‚Äôs part of the game so get used to it lol, survivors get annoyed when killers bring Mori‚Äôs but killers still bring them.
---
My thoughts are that this seems like a pretty big get out of jail free card perk.
---

It's the only exhaustion perk with a passive ability, which is a good one since it opens up loops.

Too powerful, but interesting

Oh man I do that too when I play killer. If the last gen is done I will be damned if I don't get someone on a hook to get them back from the gates.

Look man ill be honest, i skimmed through half the first paragraph and then read the last one where you're lying about there not being aggressive microtransation (Skimming through the store most skins are 5~10 dollars) and even more confusing lying about paid dlc? In the xbox version there are 4 paid killers/survivors that aren't licensed AND i think that's even higher on PC. Pretty sure you have to buy the doctor and huntress too at least, maybe more. 
---
I went back and skimmed through your comment again and i thought maybe you were just a triggered survivor but honestly you're riding dick so hard it seems like you're a dev. If that's the case, can you do me a favor and stop being an asshole? I really hope you are a dev because you took that criticism to heart lol

Really, how is stream sniping even a thing on this game, with the lottery system they have it‚Äôs very unlikely your gonna get that person and the off chance that you do, so what take your lickings and move on, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, then to get them a second time is even higher! Plus doesn‚Äôt twitch have a delay on the feed?

sad that the explosion got cut off

Do you have any tips how to play against hex: ruin? I seem always to lose against it. My winratio is probably 40% but somehow I'm rank 8. I don't get it. I'm so bad at the game I should be like rank 17...

I'm gonna let you know you suck and there's nothing you can do about it. You are trash and the game and need free kills.

---
The fact that you won't read the entire comment, and removed your original post doesn't give you much credibility. It makes you look like you're not open to any opinions but your own.
---
Yes, skins cost money, but they are not essential to gameplay. If you had read my entire comment, you would have understood the purpose of the skins, why they cost money, and why it's good for the game. And if you choose not to buy them, or disagree, then you can just not buy them, and it's a non-issue.
---
All of the unlicensed content in this game can be acquired for free. You can purchase all of the unlicensed killers and survivors, and even the licensed perks for iridescent shards, which you earn by playing the game. This costs nothing but your time. Only the licensed characters require your money.
---
Just because I disagreed with your original comment doesn't make me an asshole. I took the time to explain and respond to a number of the concerns you brought up. You're showing your hand by resorting to baseless insults. I'm not a game dev. Sorry to disappoint you.

It's the opposite for me (or maybe just xbox), killer always takes longer. Even in the day i can get into a game as a survivor pretty quickly. 
---
Also i would LOVE if they had a single player mode like Ft13. They could do so much with all the killers they have but i honestly have no faith in that happening unless someone buys them out lol
---
They need to be paired with the highest rank in the group since they already have a big advantage (swf) period.

If I get all four of my stacks I win. I'll be happy the rest of the match no matter what happens.
