That's some mental gymnastics if I've ever seen it. That other dude was right, noob does have a bunch of fanboys on here who will try and defend him for anything lmao

---
Thanks to who ever gave the gold, i assume you hate noob3 and ochido as much as i do.
---
But he’s also still like 19 right? At that time he would’ve likely still been in high school and let’s be honest, most people aren’t the most mature in high school.
---
You're the one I'm concerned with. You take this issue way too seriously and you're the thicker one to not realize what a dickhead based on the way you act and talk
---
Ummmm you clearly have never saw [r/ShirtlessMyersFetish](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/youutm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x_fell_for_it_fool/?)

I can’t find it on apple store?
---
By actual logic, the people attracted to the huntress are attracted to a fictional video game character that wasn't pre-history, who lost her parents at a young age. I'm sorry, but are you saying if someone loses contact with humanity at a young age does that automatically stop brain development?
---
Cute

---
When you buy cosmetics but don’t play the killer
---
it's not possible. this is an issue that can't be fixed and the survival game rust (idk if you've played it) suffers from this massively, completely different game but solo players have an incredible harder time playing because you're always playing against groups. anything you do to buff solo players will ultimately buff individual group players making the group stronger in the end. the only solution is to either be an incredibly good solo player or to just give in and group up.
---
Yes, I love how Monto is streaming more often now.
---
People are downvoting you because you’re wrong
---
I love this.
---
i think the original lore is basically the survivors play the game until they become killers themselves. surviving the round takes them back to the campfire... but getting sacrifced takes a part of their soul until they become corrupted enough to kill for the entity. 
---
Which doesn't pan out at all about how the entity brings in killers, but what are you gonna do lol
---
I play Survivor and Killer more or less equally (probably survivor a bit more, because I can play with my friends and the queue times are shorter)... And it honestly baffles me that *Killer* toxicity is something people keep talking about, and that every time you talk about toxic survivors people try to throw out the hoary old chestnut that "the other side is just as bad." 'Cause in my experience—again, speaking as some who plays both sides—Killer toxicity just isn't really a thing.
---
Look, I'm not saying it literally never happens. But in hundreds of hours of playtime, I've seen Survivors being toxic more times than I could possibly count, and Killers being toxic... um... few enough times that I could count them without using all the fingers on one hand.
---
Maybe we need to get what "toxic" legitimately means straightened out first: "Toxic" is when you say or do something for no other reason than to try to make another player feel bad. It's not trying to win. It's not using mechanics included in the game, like perks or addons some people might think are OP—if you have a problem with that, complain to BHVR. It's not using strategies that can help you win but aren't much fun for the other side—camping, tunneling, flashlight saves, etc.—again, they're part of the game, complain to BHVR if you don't like it.
---
Toxic is teabagging. Toxic is repeatedly beating on someone who's already on the hook. Toxic is chasing the Killer around trying to harass them with a flashlight instead of working objectives. Toxic is dumping a slug near the open hatch, just so that you can pick them back up as soon as they get near it. But mostly, toxic is insulting other players in post-game chat over what happened in the game.
---
Yeah, Killers can be toxic. I've certainly had them beat me on the hook or stand around waving a chainsaw in my face on occasion. Once, in a stream where a SWF team was coordinating repeated Head Ons against the Killer, he left the last Survivor to bleed out in front of the exit gates for awhile, then picked her up and basically paraded her through the map until the EGC skewered her. Justified by the Head Ons? Not really. But, at the same time, it's not like it was totally unprovoked either.
---
But this kinda stuff is really rare. Honestly, *even when playing Survivor*, I see more toxicity from other Survivors than I do from the Killer. Oh, I'm trash because I dealt with a RBT that was literally 2 seconds away from killing me instead of sacrificing myself to unhook my teammates? And I'm also trash for trying and failing to pull off a flashlight save? And, wouldn't you know it, apparently I'm trash for... working generators? Fuck, whatever. It's a fucking game, people. When is it ever justified to cuss someone out over something they did or didn't do in a *GAME*? Seriously, get a grip.
---
So, to get back to the point... What do you do to counter killer on survivor toxicity? 99 times out of 100, nothing, because it won't come up, or if it does, it will be so minor that it doesn't really matter—Dude hit you a few times after he hooked you? So what? In the rare case where a Killer gets tilted because you outplayed him and cusses you out in chat, just report him and move on.
---
You know, just like you should already be doing to your fellow Survivors at the end of roughly 1 out of every 5 matches.
---
No the opposite. They are the ones who claimed she ceased development past 7 did they not?
---
There are some youtube videos that show this.. here's a recent one:
---
https://youtu.be/YBSozn0AqzQ
---
My son and partner plays the DLC that I bought in the PSN store but can't access the characters and killers I purchased with iridescent shards. 
---
Just make sure it's registered as their primary console.
---
How are we all pedophiles then?
---
But think of those juicy BP for successful saves....
---
My life is complete.
---
So your complaining that the ability is similar to one's already in the game but then you go on to say you wish it was similar to a different ability in the game?
---
We arent.
---
1: Yes.
---
2: The brown/yellows stack, purple does not (I think, from memory. Could be wrong.) It only stacks up to the same level of fog as the purple provides.
---
3: Untrapping yourself, unhooking yourself.
---
Eh I’d rather get the points for actually escaping. And I just can’t be bothered to go out of my way to save people anymore when the sentiment is never returned anyway
---
Name checks out
---
Id love to do this! Id have one stipulation for any new surv I'd be matched with though (just absolutely no homophobia, racism, or transphobia)
---
Bind the skillcheck button to a button on the side of your mouse if you have
---
Otzdarva did this in his stream today
---
Yeah it can be difficult but its not impossible. It'll just take longer than if you use a viable killer
---
I'd rather be facecamped than unhooked in front of the killer but survs don't seem to understand how unhooking eorks
---
The entity will show up after you select the 5th thing. You can direct it also, it will go to the opposite side of where you started. Eg: You can go north 2 nodes, south 2 nodes, entity will show, you can select where you want to go based on where it is positioned, then it will take a node after you choose if that makes sense?
---
What do maps do?
---
Ouch. Harsh game huh. Understandable. You'll probably cool down from this after a few days. 
---
It does feel that way sometimes.

Trying really hard to get Adept Nurse on console right now. I was a rank 6 killer and I've been doing nothing but this trophy and have dropped all the way down to 18 (feels bad and I didn't even DC down there). There were a couple of games I came close but I had either people DC/Give up on hook/or find hatch. Has BHVR said anything about changing the requirement in the future? I'm getting 4k's, but not double pipping.
---
I dont care about the BP or the fun
---
I didn't say it was impossible, and if you do want to run a low tier killer at rank one you have to put lots of time into it as well as know all the plays etc. and most people don't want to out time into a killer that can't guarantee good results like a nurse can
---
Indeed. Are you confused as to how a referential subject works? Is that everyone's problem? I'd find that hilarious.
---
It's one of those things. It's better to have it and not need it, than it is to need it and not have it. I solo tho.

original killer. having it would be sorta cool but I honestly do not think they will ever truly add him as he would just not make sense at all since he is like the entity and possibly maybe even stronger so I really doubt he would serve under it.
---
it would be nice if you could recover exhausted while running but twice as slow. For example if you used lithe and it caused exhausted for 60 seconds you could recover this in 120 seconds if you were running.
---
I live watching PainReliever's videos.  DbD ASMR!
---
That depends, did we argue about how stupid auto aim was and have a nice debate about the balance of the game out of nowhere?
---
The game is really repetitive so that's the problem with DBD's youtubers
---
I was mocking him saying just because someone is regularly educated does that mean you're automatically a pedophile? Or even further that all humans before regular education were pedophiles? This was me sarcastically calling him a clown. Not the fun one either.

##EXPOSED HAUNTED GROUNDS

If you are obsession, yes. If you are not, just treat him like a normal M1 killer
---
We know Barb's glasses are an addon
---
He did just basically use his fans to attack BHVR knowing full well that he was in the wrong, I get that he's young but he lied to the people that got him where he is in order to do that.
---
I mean most of them have tragic backstories so that's one thing. Great drawing btw!
---
I read somewhere before that the in-game report was being ignored and useless. Did they start paying attention to it?
---
Why do they not likr tru3? He seems like a chill guy
---
Thanks, this was bothering more than it should.
---
To be fair, that’s exactly what an ambush is. To wait in a good position to surprise attack people. What’s the best way to do that? With a bait or a target that you know the enemy will be going towards. I hate campers. It’s annoying, low skill, and usually is detrimental to the killer. But your argument against it was rather poor. I would say that an ambush killer absolutely is the most likely built to soft camp.
---
No but you acted like what's inbetween a firefighters leg
---
Jungle gyms are a bitch while playing nurse.  Run around them like a madman and She'll quit eventually

Honestly people who scream slurs in chat are edgy kids or adults who don’t get enough attention, and they’re just throwing every insult at the wall in the hopes that you’ll get mad. The best thing to do is try not to let it bother you, report them, and close chat. I wish it didn’t happen as often as it does.
---
Why would you rarely play killer? Survivors are toxic and for the weak minded
---
If you don't by any cosmetics with your blood shards and instead just get more blood points through buying perks you have in the shrine, it can be pretty quick to P3 all killers. Now getting all tier 3 perks on every P3 killer is damn expensive.
---
Jack Torrence or Norman Bates would be cool to.
---
Um the sub you're looking for is r/dbdgonegay
---
&gt;I read somewhere before that the in-game report was being ignored and useless. Did they start paying attention to it?
---
Ever since they added the website. They ignored reports during the transition but it was a long time ago.
---
If a knight was added I would make it so instead of a normal terror radius he would make metal clanking sounds to add a creepy factor we need more killers with a non normal the radius
---
Sure I am
---
What’s wrong with DS?
---
If the answer is yes. Then yea thats me
---
I had a game, where upon spawn, I heard fire, and followed it to a hex totem.
---
I was excited to break a ruin early, but the hag came and stopped me.
---
As I let go, haunted grounds was broken somewhere else, and the totem I was on went out. It was the other HG totem.
---
The hag then had an easy down, because she had scarred hand, and I was in a hallway.
---
After that another totem broke, but it didn't matter. The hag played it perfectly, and nobody really is prepared for bodyblocker Hag.
---
We all died with 1 Gen done, and it really changed how I play.
---
I can hit hex skillchecks, so I'll just stick to working through ruin. We all failed to check for ruin. She didn't have it. The other totem was devour hope though.
---
Ew. Noob3 has issues.
---
Did you get more sexy, Daddy?  :)

Can we like discuss how the concept of the legion being a group of high schoolers gives so much possibility for cosmetics that we aren’t getting?

Typical response from a survivor that DCs when he doesnt get his way
---
Dude I don't know what the fuck this build is.  Spirit fury and bamboozle? Normal pallet looping on Spirit?
---
&gt;It's one of those things. It's better to have it and not need it, than it is to need it and not have it. I solo tho.
---
Yes. New DS doesn't leave my "tryhard" survivor build. Before the rework I rarely used DS because killers would dribble the obsession and wiggle DS was an uncertainty.
---
Yeah, it's just really confusing to understand like basic sentences with the lingo being tossed around so much.
---
I usually tell new killers to buy Cannibal for BBQ and Chili, it's good information and bloodpoints. But seeing as it's on the shrine (Should totally grab it buy the way, it's only been on the Shrine of Secrets like 3 times ever.)  
---
I'd probably recommend wraith/hillbilly, both are fun and billy is pretty viable in higher ranks.  
---
If you're looking to buy a killer then I'd recommend Hag for her strong perks (Ruin pr much) or myers cause it's fun to make people scream :b lol.   
---
Just try out all the killers available to you and stick with what you find the most fun!
---
Well there is some shirtless Myers on there. But, [r/ShirtlessMyersFetish](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/youutm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x_fell_for_it_fool/?)  is way better
---
Yeah I think we're in agreement. And I dont blame them, imagine putting hours into a killer who can only do as well as survivors let them. Thats why people love playing Spirit
---
I disagree that it’s toxic. Why is it toxic to go for the player who is one hit? This community has to be the most quick trigger to call something toxic I’ve ever encountered. I am a survivor main and I’m half upset when I realize a killer is going for the other person out of pity. Am I a baby that can’t handle losing? Hook me you bastard!
---
He literally just said shut up
---
This seems to have made you upsetti in your spaghetti. Do you agree with him that the huntress is actually a child and anyone who likes her is a pedophile?

Nice

But that's a good spawn!

Dude I don’t know what your problem is with the subreddit. Nothing is wrong with it
---
We only have a basic idea, yeah. A lot of the specifics matter.
---
So far we know:
---
He places portals and has to stand on them to use them, the most we've seen so far is three. How long travelling takes could be djstance based or fixed, unknown atm.
---
 When porting the portal lights up, probably to warn survivors nearby.
---
Stream showed the Undetectable effect after porting. Unknown if part of the base kit or an addon.
---
Survivors can remove them which takes at least 20 seconds, and are Oblivious while doing so.
---
We don't know if there's cooldowns on placing or using portals.
---
We can probably assume once you run out, placing more removes older ones like Hag and Freddy.
---
That's not a subreddit, it's a random link
---
Cant really call new DS a "tryhard" survivor perk. Its now more of a counter to "tryhard killers" since it only works if being tunneled...
---
This needs to go on [r/DBDGoneCute](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/youutm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x_fell_for_it_fool/?) . I love it dude nice artwork

WORLDS ARE COLLIDING
---
He legit got the legacy skins and then got bugged out of them so he hacked to get them back. IMO BHVR shouldn’t ban for that.
---
Change the number to six but don't add any more killers to the image and you can say it's the wraith. Whenever someone says something coy they can look at the camera and it's not breaking the fourth wall because they're just looking at him.
---
If Steve's first words on the video is "hello cunts" or "Hello cuties" then I'm dying
---
Whatever you say. You keep on telling yourself that
---
Especially if it had built-in voice modulation. Have one for each of the killers, to make you sound like them. And novelty ones too.
---
These would, obviously, be monetized. But they would be worth it.
---
&gt;Cant really call new DS a "tryhard" survivor perk. Its now more of a counter to "tryhard killers" since it only works if being tunneled...
---
True. I only said "tryhard" because my other builds are completely non-meta like plunderer's + ace in the hole or Q&amp;Q + DWM + Head On.
---
That's really troubling. Do you have a source for that?
---
Because, losing something as important as your Legacy Prestige items is kinda a big deal, and I'd be fucking furious too
---
No no no on your ps4 its a app
---
Maybe thats what those survivors were thinking...
---
Be the change you want to see in this game. Theres a bitter cycle of toxic behaviour feeding into more toxic behaviours. Break the cycle.
---
Oh lol
---
It depends on your ability to travel to that portal when it is being destroyed
---
Holy fuck, calm down. Its a game lul
---
I agree it was definitely shitty but I don’t tend to judge people off of a mistake, especially not when they’re still a teenager. If he’s seemingly grown up since, then he’s probably learned from his mistakes.
---
I highly doubt he will say cunt once in the video, samination is very clever with humor and doesn’t swear because it can seem like a low brow kind of thing especially in animation
---
Babysitter works every single time you unhook no matter how far the killer is or them manipulating their TR. BT is more useful for late game sure but it’s not like the perk is dogshit tier, drink some water.
---
Relatively still to the game and dont have that many perks teachable yet
---
I honestly forgot they went mobile tbh
---
That's got to be one of the most infuriating glitches in the game.
---
Kayako/sadako kinda already exist in DBD, that's the Spirit. But maybe it will be different.
---
The Predator can be way too OP in-game, since he can go invisible and shoot people in one shot in the movie.
---
The Terminator wouldn't really get there, you will lose the horror.
---
Nemesis or Mr. X could be really great!
---
The Resident Evil DLC could feature the Umbrella Coroporation Headquarters, and Leon and Claire.
---
New to the game
---
That’s an interesting idea, I like it
---
I know, you're the one who gave the idea, I specifically meant what you said. Since getting a single safe unhook to potentially get up to an additional 8k bloodpoints is quite a lot.
---
this *is* the best possible solution in this whole thread. any changes to killers or survivors as it stands would imbalance the game and just further punish solo players or the killer. rewarding people who play solo is how you would deter swf groups. Even as a killer main however I must admit, this game is a lot less fun playing solo than playing with friends but I really don't mind playing without voice even when I do que swf though which happens to be quite often. Just having someone who's not potato head on my team helps tremendously.
---
I love the idea of Pharmacy allowing medkits to have more charges, but I feel like it should still only give you a green medkit, purple medkits are pretty powerful. Plus if it gave you more charges and that the green medkit already uses less charges a change like that would make a pretty decent alternative to self care. I love pharmacy, it's my favorite healing perk but I wish it was just a teensy bit better.
---
I mean, he kinda is a child
---
Who's noob?
---
Blood point event, new chapter, dedicated servers.
---
What's the deal with matchmaking and low ranks? I got the game a couple days ago, and I consistently see survivors who are rank 8-12 in games despite my killer rank being only 18. 
---
Is this part of the party system? If so, is it new? Will this get fixed? It makes learning characters a pain because I can hardly do anything.
---
I honestly don’t care about upvotes or downvotes.
---
Loving the Texas chainsaw 2 look
---
I play lots of hag. Please, my traps are practically invisible. If survivors are crouching your traps, you placed them in an obvious place. Camping with hag is stupid. You have super stealthy traps fantastic for catching survivors IN CHASE. every time I play a camping hag it's just such a waste of her potential AND fun. Shes absolutely one of the best killers in the game I cant wait to master her.
---
Don't you forget about me.
---
Sept. 5, to Sept. 9
---
I just recently found out there was a tutorial mode when I got bored and went through my settings. That looked like a perfect place to test out killer abilities. Besides that, just playing games will be your best bet. It’s what most will be doing when the new Chapter releases and every lobby is new survivors or new killer. By the end of the ST debut week, you’ll probably know the best start against a Demogorgon and will probably play against killers who will have found out a way to shut down the new perks.
---
Or walk? Do you have any idea how slow crouching takes? Its only a viable counter when you know exactly where the trap is.
---
wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
---
I used to do an anti slug-camp-tunnel build with unbreakable, DS, and deliverance. I probably will again cause I haven't played in awhile. It's pretty helpful at rank 20-13. After that I'll start tweaking it for a more fun playstyle sometimes I go for super sneaky, gen rush, looping, and unhook. I've been thinking of one that completely upends killer powers: spine chill, iron will, small game, and Urban evasion. I'd only have like one perk against any given killer but it should give me enough of an advantage to purely rely on my game skill. I.e. looping and hiding.
---
I didn't hack games when I was that age. It's not hard to follow the rules or accept the consequences when you don't.
---
oh my fucking god, please. this has to be the best fanmade cosmetic I've ever seen
---
Is there a difference between mending and healing and what is TR?
---
Yeah lol, hope you had fun that match. Spooky myers is always the best to play against
---
*ahnn~*
---
if you're unhooking them far enough away that BT doesn't activate, that generally means the killer is either not really close or probably not coming back making the 8 second stealth the unhooked gets just as pointless.
---
You did it, you ended toxicity
---
No, you need to double those numbers!
---
survivors:use good items and strat
---
killers: STOP BEING TOXIC AND TRYING TO RUIN THE GAME FOR ME REEEEE
---
lol. people say survivors are entitled but if a killer sees an instaheal or a flashlight that person is automatically an asshole. whatever.
---
Yeah, I don't think this game handles vertices very well.
---
Pyrimid head
---
Mostly it's because people just can't handle losing when it wasn't any fault of their own OR they have to scream at the dick they went against
---
Did he just start going up into the air? Sometimes depending on where you land when that happened it makes you escaped. It’s not an extremely common bug but the second part is less likely to happen but I don’t know whag exactly happened because I didn’t see it.
---
That's a damn shame, I was trying to give survivors some credit for having a sense of humor, guess I'm still wrong. I'm a killer main and all my joke posts like this get flamed by survivors.
---
Follow me on Twitch by the way I've recently started streaming there and you get to see me embarrass myself in real time.

---
Since someone me mentioned the spirit whooshing already, I’ll just respond to nurse and hillbilly. 
---
Yeah, I think it’d be a really strong perk on them if they decided to run it, but imo this rework of insidious has as much strength as tinkerer does on them, maybe slightly stronger. And hillbilly as well as nurse at least make noise beyond just terror radius (chainsaw noise and blinking noise) to help out survivors. But yeah, it would have to be tweaked slightly to not be too strong on them. I just mainly want to see this perk changed to something kinda useful and be useable, I hate camping as killer lol
---
Cleansing dull totems counters noed? I didn’t know there was a way to prevent noed
---
And there's that anger we see in the chat lol
---
i fuckin hate that spot
---
I think predator can be balanced out.
---
The power can be the blaster  and an add on/perk can make him invisible via hiding his aura and terror radius if he comes from behind you or something.
---
T-1000 could leave damaging traps or something that hurt you but give survivor a speed boost to run away.
---
np, that's why I always favor discussion, it enables people to explain themselves
---
Everyone hates ochido with a burning rage, even the devs dont want him anywhere near dbd.
---
Yoooooo.....Doc is SWOLE as sh!t man!!
---
I've heard windowed mode messes it up a lot like that. Probably on top of low settings as well
---
I get so mad at this shit for real.
---
yeah you wish buddy, turns out it's not even a bug, devs just dont like you! get fucked nerd
---
/s
---
TR = terror radius, aka the heartbeat.
---
Yes, healing is healing, mending is when you get hit with borrowed or by the Legion in his ability.
---
there were at least 3 times where i wouldve thought theyd seen me and the jig was up and just run away

That's where I thought I was a goner

unfun, yeah, but camping a survivor takes 2 whole minutes, at high ranks all the gens will finish or basically be done if you have no pressure. time won't be wasted looking for ruin as high ranks push through it and only take it out if they see it. Finding out he's camping does take time, but not enough.   
---
Full ass face camping will usually get you 1 or 2 kills, the second kill coming from a noed facecamp at the end, and it should net you next to nothing in blood points or rank ups. higher ranks don't have campers because it's a shit strat. Only "camping" done at highER ranks is when people potat and loop around a hooked person
---
Stop giving people ideas I want them to not completely nerf the demogorgon instantly. Jokes aside they probably won't allow the portals near hooked survivors kinda like trapper with his traps plus that transporting time is long enough to give survivors a running head start.
---
Please message me if this does happen
---
Susie is 15 or 16...
---
"Raybe"
---
So they’re both useless if the killer ignores the unhook. 
---
But if the killer does come back, there’s someone they clearly have information on and someone they may not find at all meaning you’re still doing your job of ensuring your teammates escape. If you are confident in your looping skills, you can trade BT for this and only go for safe unhooks (as you normally should) and goad the killer to focus you. Or just take BT and do whatever; idk man.
---
Oh I didn't realize the countdown didn't start until you leave the terror radius. So can you mend yourself regardless of whether or not you have self care?
---
Survivors who unhook in the killer's terror radius without BT are also clowns
---
Excuse me while I waste my insta heal at rank 18.

Yes. You can mend without self care or a medkit.

IT chapter 2 comes out close to when chapter 13 is released. So it would be out of time for some extra hype. But IT wouldn’t work as he is a gigantic spider but you see him as what you fear most. In common the regular clown but I just don’t see it happening, but it could...

Im guessing addons will allow you to have more. Also while pounced has reduced steering (maybe even none at all) it has a much wider attack cone than a standard attack. Survivors can also tell when youre charging it because your face opens up.
---
Gotcha thanks, that's definitely useful
---
Did he harass them?
---
EZ Stake Out stacks.
---
This usually happens when you match with a a group of “Survive with Friends”. This is not meant to happen. However, I believe it is an issue that has become more apparent, lately.

Ace in the hole was reworked and it is epic. Sorry. You are ill-informed.

There are a lot of others but I don't want you to take to much of your time, I don't know if they can be solved just by playing the game. But being a person who joined when The Pig came out, I was off and on it, took a break and saw this subreddit, it made me realize that there's a lot of things that I don't know.

Wasn’t this posted here like a month ago?
---
I'd rather have something as simple as a selection wheel of pre-recorded lines. 
---
I used to play a mod called *The Hidden.* In it you could taunt and say things like *"Fresh Meat..."* or *"I see you..."*
---
They can be getting super lucky and pulling them out of chests. I had a friend do it 2 games in a row.
---
they opened a chest and got lucky
---
good idea but i think a good buff wich would probably be to op but you recover exhausthion while running
---
I never said I ended it or could. I'm just asking why everyone needs to act like little cry babies. Stop being a dick
---
i mean i do report them, but like "don't let it bother you" doesn't really work. Of course i try not to, but when you get the same shit thrown at you time and time again by people in or out of power over you, it's pretty hard to not get annoying at least, pair that with laws being, or not being, formed around that and that's why slurs are generally considered worse than name calling, it's not the one instance that's shitty, it's all the ones before, the ones to come, and the societal mentality around it
---
*misses it by literally a fucking pixel*

Username checks out.

Besides the voice chat, I think it’s also the other ways to escape. In DBD, all you have is the exit gates or the hatch. In F13, you got the police exit, the boat, two cars, or killing Jason. So many good memories in that game only for it to come crashing down thanks to some stupid lawsuit.
---
No one wonders why people are toxic, its the nature of multiplayer games. Anonymity plus an even slightly competitive nature of the game breeds this bullshit. + Compared to other communities, DBD is relatively tame in terms of toxicity or insults in general.
---
For example the insults i saw people throw around in Dota are a hundred times worse than what i see in DBD.
---
Worst one directed to myself was: "I wanna see your Family burn" cause i decided not to take a single early game fight that we likely would have lost.
---
Followed. Feel free to follow me as well. Mine is the same as my user name here. Best of luck with your streams!
---
I'm gonna put my two cents in, camping doesn't seem like a legitimate strategy unless you want to force a sacrifice or have lots of gens and two survivors left.
---
Tunneling seems to be an action rewarded by the game and has literal game mechanics promoting it but also feels very unfair to survivors getting targeted, unfun and un-engaging to the people just doing gens or watching.
---
A standard meta-build for survivors includes: borrowedtime, adrenaline, deadhard, and decisive strike. For killer: ruin, bbq and chilli, pop-goes the weezle, and brutal strength. However, i suggest you play around the perks that best suit your play style. Best of luck!
---
Sounds like you need a break from the game.
---
dude, watch videos and play, that’s helped me get better, put me on that map and you can rush gens, it’s honestly just you learning how to properly run a killer around
---
Yeah, that’s completely understandable. I’ve just sort of become desensitized to the shit if it’s being directed towards me, people who do that after that point are not people to me anymore.

I didn't notice the instaheal during the game. It was the intent of being as annoying as possible in grey-green ranks that annoyed me.
---
Awh shucks, you’re welcome !! I find his voice so calming that I often put on the Spirit video before i go to sleep. I think he actually posts here himself, occasionally, under the same name - I first found him here when he posted the Adiris/Plague video, a few months ago - maybe you can thank him yourself, sometime! :D
---
No this is my clip from yesterday, there was probably something similar tho
---
How dare the dev's update this game! /s
---
Yeah, we saw 3 in one clip, and it makes sende to have addons give more
---
yknow even tho i hate hello kitty this is fucking awesome
---
No, but he didn't have to lie about getting banned and start a shitstorm.
---
Yeah pretty sure a super similar clip doing the exact same thing against a huntress was also shared at some point, haha

“Sophomore jitters” tells a much, much different story. And you can get those sweaters at any point in high school.

She’s really not. You have to learn the killer before claiming “too op pls nerf”. Tip: headphones, iron will, walk when she’s phasing,  generally just learn the plays and adjust accordingly. I’m not trying to be a jerk, just saying what i did against spireh
---
Is it me or has camping and tunneling been exceptionally bad lately? I fluctuate between purple and red ranks, and I seem to be getting game after game of hook campers or tunnelers that just get gen rushed because they’re camping.
---
This is the third time i've fell for this today, can i get an f in the chat

the only reason people like susie out of the legion is because she has dyed hair and a cute squeal when hit by pallet,change my mind

Oh yay. Can't avoid that cunt no matter where I go.

Give me the graduate gown lol. I want to chase people in a flowy graduate thing
---
*insert Nurse meta build with Mori here*

I have 300 hours on survivor. I have faced so many spirits. I know how to play against her, but she is so overpowered. I’ve seen the guides, i have the experience. She sucks

Preach
---
I'll take a power bottom with a butt that nice.
---
Tbf that's a free character every 5 weeks of just logging in
---
ayy, all my mains in 1 picture
---
Does this only happen against ghostface?
---
This is kinda the reason why Bots would be needed.
---
The game is pretty complicated own it’s own.
---
If you unhook someone at my face, I'll down both of you, as a survivor main I would fucking love a "press ctrl to stop the other survivor unhooking you", so when this claudette tryes to unhook me at the killer's face, I could kick her face to avoid being farmed
---
Did you record this on a camera from 1930?
---
If you're into watching killer gameplay, do check out HybridPanda's videos! He's quite entertaining and so nice!
---
theyve stated it many times, its what confused people into thinking it was humans only, which it never was.
---
Hey fair enough, I was just saying it’s a little unfair for us to nerf killers a lot while survivors have been off the hook. I don’t play killer but I can still sympathize with killers and how some survivor perks are op.
---
*laughs in Nurse*
---
Cosmetics are cosmetics. Literally huntress has a child one lol. Same with spirit. She’s a college student and has a high school skin. We can argue about rights for fictional characters all you want, but it’s gonna get you nowhere
---
LUL a 100% survivor main who never plays killer. I'm sure you know what you're talking about. /s
---
Yes, while being grabbed when unhooking too
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.
---
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
EYYYY! you got the reference\~ TCM2 is great
---
Cosmetics “being cosmetics” is a different story when Legions base cosmetics are canon Legion members.
---
You entirely sure it wasnt just lagspikes? because that happens more often than lagswitching.
---
Are you playing on console? There has been a glitch where it doesn't show you heal or wiggle but you are actually doing it
---
Can I get the image without text pl0x?

Hot damn
---
I just fucking bought the dlc’es yesterday
---
Going for the unhooked person punishes the farmer and gives you the advantage of a shorter chase, and saving valuable time, if they don't have BT of course. Sorry to be the dick, but I'm at least going to get the easy down if I can.
---
You got a bug boss, had nothing to do with dying light. If you cant emote at the beginning (point or wave) then you have it and wont be able to exit via the gates, you'll run right on through.
---
I think so. It happens to me a lot when the killer is losing. Never when hes winning.
---
He was 17 not 4. A 17 year old knows the difference between right and wrong. Age is a shitty excuse.
---
Killers assuming every survivor is god tier military signals over discord 4 stack.
---
Me just trying to show my little cousin how to play over text chat.
---
Eh. Think what you want dude. People will still do whatever they want. It’s fiction.
---
Because a lot of people's response to anyone running Spine Chill is 'well, that's why we have eyes???'. 
---
I run it because I like knowing for sure if the killer is coming our way or whether they're passing by. Terror radius but SC isn't active? We're good. Terror radius and SC is flickering? Be careful. If there's a terror radius and SC is holding steady, I leave the area I'm in. 
---
Then, after saying that, people usually go 'okay, but then you become reliant on it and are fucked against T1 Myers'. Which would be valid if the person running the perk is the kind of person to stare at gens while they're repairing them, but I look around and have yet to be yoinked because I was too reliant on SC to see the Myers approaching.
---
It's good against Spirits (because it activates against their physical location, not against the husk. You could be directly in front of her husk and it won't pop unless she's looking at you during her phase), it's helpful against Pigs (whose TR is disguised when they're crouched, but their stealth can't trump SC), it helps against Wraiths (because even if I can see a shimmer, it still tells me when the killer is coming this way without a TR). It's a good perk. Needless for some? Sure.
---
I, however, have issues with auditory processing, so having that perk there to tell me 'hey, the killer's looking right at you and hasn't stopped' is valuable even if there's also a TR.
---
Dying light has a survivor as the obsession. This survivor is now a target for the killer, because if they are killed all other survivors suffer from (i think) 25%ish decrease in action speed (gen repairs, heals, etc). The survivor who is the obsession also gains an increase to altruistic actions (heals and hook rescues)
---
Now I know what to do in the beginning of every trial until this issue is fixed. Thanks for the heads up. At least I can plan on dying lol
---
I'm not sure, but commentor wasnt referring to ochido. You were referring to noob3 in ur original comment and commentor was also. .-.
---
Remove the spawn point then. It's not a good spawn point anyways, and you have to make a consious effort to go there and check, meaning you don't just randomly stumble upon the totem. It's also a million times better than a totem out in the open
---
He's just in his dARk tImES, people his age complain about everythi... What ? You're telling me he's not a teenager ? lol Im outta here.
---
Lol
---
Goddamn, this. You can hear the fucker breathing from like a mile away if you keep an ear out.
---
I'm ready to get stabbed to death by hello susie
---
I was referring to both noob3 and cuckhido in my comment
---
It's laughably bad now too. The issue has just shifted to inconsistency rather than too fast.
---
If I have his ENTIRE BODY on my screen, with NO part of my body blocking my line of vision, and he's point blank staring at me and I am staring at him, with NOTHING separating my view from him, including my own character, then I should break him out.
---
They haven't come a long way. They changed detection from stupidly easy to stupidly incosistent. One issue does not solve another
---
Id be down for this, bring on the baby dweets!
---
No0b3: looks like Quintin, voices Steve.
---
Survivors feel the same way, tbh
---
Also check out DamnnoHTML he plays mostly killer and every time he does something he gives a reason on why he’s doing it.
---
I mean you pretty much hit the nail on the head, aside from the cute voice. Then everyone would like Julie too. 
---
I think Amanda's stun is much cuter though.
---
Speak for yourself. The higher in rank, the more tunnelers I encounter
---
&gt;I like a Killer that manages to actually scare me.
---
*spooky myers noises*
---
It's probably an extremely unpopular opinion but, I don't like No0b3. His content is filled with overused and dead memes. And I'm not even talking about how he hacked for BP and then covered it up by saying his friends helped him and that BHVR are the ones who were wrong. Once a cheater, always a cheater.
---
People think it’s more efficient for 2 people to spend 16 seconds than 1 person take 32 seconds. Besides, sloppy butcher is more meta. I still think self care is often worth it, but it’s entirely dependant on your playstyle
---

---
It's what every person comments to these kinds of posts. They always think they're being personally attacked 🤔
---
That's lucky!
---
Would recommend Tofu or PainReliever instead, Monto/Noob have a more toxic style to their play, which I don't think anyone wants more of.
---
Honeslty in surprised. I thought it might exist because i just recently learned about oinkers, dbdgonewild, dbdgonegay, etc.
---
Yeah those subreddits scare me
---
Yep, but different playstyle sa will do better/worse
---
This was my first dbd commission, but I hope to do more! I love this game a lot and the characters!
---
this made me laugh so hard thank you
---
Cant you just grab them out, juggle them until they break free, and then mori them?
---
This is either exactly what it says it is, or I'll be a fool and fall for it again. And I don't know which is worse
---
I mean, you're not wrong
---
Nurse is way more manageable and her cool down when she fails a blink is very reasonable
---
Definitely lagswitching. Every chase he would initiate the game would essentially freeze or do the laggy everyone teleporting in the same path. It was the entire game too. Second he spotted someone, lag, and it would just *miraculously* stop right after he downed someone.
---
Yes! He also has video tutorials on how to loop and stuff. I am still a baby looper, but I've gotten better by watching his videos and Monto's.
---
He let it go for four months lmao but ok, whatever.
---
Honestly, I dont think so. It's just very lucky lag. I've deffinetly had that thought before, but there is no way
---
Ah, alright lol that could work
---
That knife looks too small 🧐
---
Now all of China knows it's here

My friend recently picked up the game and we decided that he'd main Legion since it fits him almost perfectly. He's a baby killer that sucks at finding survivors but is good at landing hits and wants a good beginner-friendly build. What would you recommend? (He also has Ghost Face and Bubba, told him to get BBQ)
---
He's not. It comes out in September im assuming they already have someone making grunting noises n such. Unless DBD are last minute type of ppl...oh wait
---
You think he didnt contact bhvr?
---
ew
---
Why would it be camp fest? Surely people realise that you get more BP for killing more people
---
Not in Australia for me either, anyone here know what country its out in?
---
Next time on hoarders...
---
I am yeah
---
Personally I see many more survivors DC than killers. I guess that makes sense because they have 4 chances to do so, and once the killer does its game over, but still.
---
In addition to the 3rd one, luck helps you find better items in chests.
---
I started off with The Hag. Having her lay a trap at the hooked survivors feet will help break you of the habit of camping. Its a little mental thing you can do to fool yourself into thinking you are camping the hook. You can also lay them along hallways and narrow corridors to help spread out a net to track survivors. Once you get good at her, you'll snowball out of control.
---
It really is best Texas chainsaw sequel in my opinion
---
Thanks!
---
It happens to me a lot
---
Actually Wraith is standing there too
---
Sandbagging is indeed sabotaging fellow survivors intentionally.  Aka blocking pallet loops.
---
The tutorial is limited to Trapper, and you can't even play around with traps. :'(
---
Probably because that's the only way to get pressure. I've only been to red ranks a few times and I hate every second of it. I try to de-pip HARD
---
Do you know what countries have the beta currently?
---
So give them skins?
---
yes they are both useless when the killer is far. Yet one is useful when the killer is at the hook; you think leaving no scratch marks or blood is going to make more of a difference than getting an extra hit when the killer is right there?
---
The concept of Babysitter is neat, but best case scenario is it is useless, worst case scenario the benefit does nothing and paints a target on the unhooker.
---
Bill Moseley is hilarious
---
Had a game yesterday as Ghostface and had 1 kill and hooked a second and the last gen popped. I knew I wasn’t going to get anyone else so I stayed pretty close to the guy I hooked as his friend tried to come up and I exposed him and downed him getting 3. I then got a shitty message that I’m trash because I wouldn’t leave. Why would I leave in the endgame just so you and your friends get a free escape?
---
Yes, but it's unlikely that it's a lagswitch
---
It’s only matter how you and them playing the game. I’ve been playing this game for 3 years since released, and I found that the toxicity and salty between killer / survivor main never change. 
---
Just so you know, the game never balanced. That’s why most people couldn’t accept their defeat and some of them are ended up like this.
---
Which   comment   
---
┬──┬ ノ( ゜-゜ノ)

 You clearly didnt refer to both of them in the 2nd comment.

Please AHHHHHHHH

But you still didn't a year later apparently

I’d like to second HybridPanda, especially his Shrine Watch videos where he goes over the perks in the Shrine. And his videos are entertaining as hell!

He almost did it a third time but I stopped recovering and just wormed my way to him, which he was grateful for. Gave me a good laugh though.
---
As far as tracking perks from only Legion, Ghostface and Bubba + base Killer perks, you can use Thrilling Tremors, Discordance, Spies from the Shadows or Whispers. Best tracking perks are probably going to be Whispers and Thrilling Tremors.
---
Unfortunately it requires multiple people. Yeah if you know people with the game you can do it, but it would be nice if we could just practice the killers with simple bots or something.

First time nurse gets easy 4K omegalol
---
Nope, had someone experience this while i was playing the hag, i thought they were glitching, now i know its a bug
---
I feel like she shouldn't collide with survivors. Other than that I think she's fine.
---
I don't know how fast is the connection synchronization between your internet router and a console but if you can lag switch on PC without any software whatsoever, I am willing to bet you also can on console depending on how far your router is from your arm.
---
He should be shirtless

this is one of the things we call “blursed”
---
His chainsaw can instadown multiple targets
---
300 hours isn't even all that long. With mention of time playing as killer doesn't show that you've tried to learn.

I feel like her power is fine, but her passive with the windows and the faking her power is so bull

He earned some legacy and then lost them in a BHVR caused save file wipe. They compensated him in bloodpoints which he didn’t want or need so he hacked legacy when they refused to help him (obviously he shouldn’t have, but 17 year olds are dumb.) he then got banned for that. Then he hacked in purple flashlights on an alt account, which is a super shitty thing and he should’ve known better. I personally think that he’s grown up a bit and gotten better, but no one is required to give him another chance.
---
And, most important, she is hard to use
---
Or when you sneeze during skill check
---
nope sadly
---
Not giving any indication before hand of the killer having the perk and how many dull totems are left on the map only for you to get punished for the killer being complete dogshit. IS dumb
---
Nope, refuse to watch his videos and give him income. Hope that guy’s channel dies
---
It can be at times, and not having Iron will can be a pain in the ass when youre against her as well.
---
Fine then... BEAR MAN!
---
Escaping doesn’t mean you win. If you refuse to rescue people from the hook you’ll probably end up losing + get less BP overall. Not to mention you won’t get better at the game.
---
I've never watched something so satisfying, good God
---
So the perk has strengths and weaknesses spending on the situation you’re in? A wild concept, honestly.
---
but a no warning instaheal that lets you move at 6 m/s while ignoring existing exhausted effects is completely fair, nothing questionable about that
---
I have played everyday since October of last year, I have almost dedicated all my gaming life to dead by daylight for the past year. I play some killer but I’m a survivor main, and every other killer is fine and fair but spirit every game with spirit seems like total horseshit
---
Yeah, same. Outlast and RE2 are way better than DBD and should be higher.

:O
---
But that’s the thing, her skill cap is so high it’s insane to go against one that is even decent at her
---
Do people actually point at survivors for missing skill checks? I've never seen that happened
---
Yikes who drew the original cringefest behind the meme.
---
Or you get hooked with another survivor nearby, who can save you as soon as it's safe.
---
Then you have a choice. You can either let them unhook you, thus wasting the perk. Or you can unhook yourself right in front of them, giving yourself Broken, denying them the points for unhooking and healing you, and guaranteeing that they never help you in this match, and any future match.
---
This is, evidently, a very hard choice for some people.
---
When p3 claudettes play a new character
---
yes, in fact, it is possible making a lag switch is sadly not that complicated. I have faced a few and it is pretty easy to tell a lag switcher from someone just lagging. it is uncommon though in my years of playing on ps4 I have seen 4. if you think it was a lag switch upload the video on youtube then go on there submit a ticket site and fill it out and give the video link so they can take a look at it
---
Dats nice
---
Drunk by Daylight struggles
---
Gotta make a petition :'(
---
Yup. Lagswitching on consoles is a thing. 
---
Although most people really just mess with their internets by putting a heavy load on their internet such as downloading something or when the whole family jumps on their internet. Since they're the host, a lot of crazy shit can happen. 
---
There's really no need for a lagswitch when you can do what I just said above. Although you can. Thats usually not the case, and it's mainly due to bad wifi or internet manipulation.
---
Lagswitchers are for extreme losers which is common in the gaming community
---
You're not doing anything wrong, and practically everyone does that with hag.
---
and you play against better players anyway- that's what the ranking system's there for!
---
Denmark is the only place that I know for sure has it. Moved my Apple ID to there a week ago to play, works great
---
This has aged like fine wine, has it not?
---
When I'm playing solo Survivor and get hooked my teammates decide the formula is one person on hook is four people not on gens.
---
Huh. Iv never had this happen
---
you are incorrect im afraid it is very possible to lag switch on ps4 hell there was even a glitch back in the day of gta to car dupe by making a lag switch
---
I like to think that in my lifetime, I've exchanged any genuine skill that would help in everyday life for exceptional foresight on the odd occasion.
---
The other survivors are at fault since they DC'd though
---
the guy said he used lan. Cause I messaged hum letting him know that I reported him.
---
Yes me too. I just made a post saying the same thing
---
You can hear her grab the window if she actually vaults it. It sounds a little like her normal clicking but if you learn to listen to the noise it can help you tell if she is actually vaulting or not.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Yeah wouldnt jason make more sense
---
Yeah I completely agree with you u/redditkillermain69 All survivors are toxic swf groups and shouldnt be getting rewarded for doing their objective to escape while a completely dumbass killer thats had 0 hooks the entire game gets rewarded for being shit and suddenly gets 4 kills because of one perk.
---
That isn't considered holding the game hostage. The reason why is because you all can still die and end up leaving the game. The only way players could hold the game hostage at this point in the game is if they block the basement in Coal Tower and never let you leave until you disconnect, if a survivor intentionally glitches on top of an object that the killer can't get them from or knock them down from, or if a Trapper puts a trap on a locker with a survivor in it and the survivor never comes out, in this case the survivor is holding the game hostage by not accepting fate and leaving the locker.
---
I've had that. I'll be standing around, and I'm moving all over the place. Along with the whole team, it's unplayable, and obvious, because of the strange patterns you described.
---
He doesn't have those perks
---
This is an exaggeration. What happened is this: he knew he’d hacked legacy and could be banned for it but the devs never told him explicitly what he did. They simply banned him with no context. He reached out to ask for an explanation and was simply told “you know what you did” which isn’t feally an answer. He then made some poorly worded comments in anger that were supposed to be asking people to get the devs to tell him what he did wrong that got misinterpreted (his fault, should have been clearer). Then when they told him what he did wrong he accepted full responsibility, apologized and has seemed to improve and mature since. There’s no question that he earned his bans, and no one needs to give him another chance. But they should at least tell the full story so that people can make their own informed decisions. For other youtubers i’d recommend Monto, nototzdarva, hybridpanda and maybe ohtofu.
---
ya np man happy to help
---
God please no
---
If you are a survivor main, or looking forward to be one, watch NoOb3 or Paulie Esther, Monto is Killer and Survivor, but if you wanna be a good killer only main watch Otzdarva, he's the best along with Tru3tal3nt
---
F13 is fun to watch because of the voice chat (obv) but also it feels way less toxic than DBD... people play it to have fun, and they don’t have the same sense of entitlement as dbd players do.
---
Ditto on monto. Just him going over each perk and add on on killers helped a ton. Before that I literally had no idea what some killers even where and after watching him for a couple hours I could easily identify obscure shit like mint rag hag or honing stone trapper.
---
Only in certain places. I switched my Apple ID to Denmark and downloaded it, no problems so far
---
I'm always torn between the two of them haha. In the end I lean towards empathy just a bit more because I love always being able to see exactly where the first survivor to get hit is at anywhere on the map and thus know exactly where the killer is in that moment
---
An official server endorsed by the developers is no place for idiotic sexual jokes. If you think he's right, go join his circle jerk antics, because they clearly appeal to you.
---
This is a pretty good idea! Shoot me a message if it actually goes live (PC)
---
You okay man
---
Why? I'm just wondering, as I find him relatively entertaining, but that's just me. Bit edgy, but I kind of like the lack of filter, and in the serious moments, he does seem nice
---
Nah, I punish stupid survivor mistakes like that. And if they DC they're not good players anyway and I'll turn it into a farm game and let everyone else go.
---
for those in the back &gt;!it’s a fuckin pun!&lt;
---
The devs should start putting Jason in here, he is feeling left out :(
---
You're asking the internet.
---
Expect the answer to that 1.
---
In other words- the internet has always  been that way. That's your answer
---
True. That was for OG bloodweb grinders, and it is totally harmless to get them back. Additionally, BHVR should implement a way for old players to get stuff like that back.
---
I find killer takes more skill, while survivor takes more time. To be good as survivor, you mainly need to memorize patterns and maps. For killer, that isnt needed nearly as much. However, that tends to mean you'll be better at killer than survivor at first. Now survivor still takes some skill and killer takes some time. It's just the gap
---
How long does this take, I've had the game since it was free on PS plus, and only have 3 killers to P2 and one to P3
---
Instant Karma.
---
And I almost guarantee that survivor threw a bitch fit because you took NOED.
---
I would have to say killer. You have to manage gen protecting, hooking survivors, ending chases quickly, protecting your totems if you have any, and so many other factors. I've only ever reached rank 12 as Killer, 4 as Survivor.
---
BHVR sees the reddit too friend.
---
They most likely had decisive strike and wanted you to pick them up, but you made the right decision and decided to go after the unhooker instead
---
I know what he did was wrong, but for some reason I still really enjoy his content and he sure keeps up the appearance of being a nice guy in serious moments.
---
Wtf do you even read what you type you , I know that's what you want but you said to bring it back when it's literally never even been in the game .... And again as I said earlier why are you even bringing up perks that have been reworked they're irrelevant. Also I'm not saying I like noed but you're comparing something with no counter to somthing that has a complete counter and even then you still have to get hit. Not only that but totems are in preset spots so if you learn where they spawn it makes it a lot easier
---
Ok but it doesn't have to be. Everyone doesn't HAVE to be a fucking asshole all the God damn time
---
Tier 4 Evil Within
---
This would be a cool chapter without a killer, I think adding them both later on would be cool. Like a makeup for Leatherface and Ghostface not getting a survivor.
---
It was all necessary, what is and isnt necessary is what a person thinks, not the definitive truth.
---
Rank20 killers be like
---
Okay I thought it was unnecessary
---
Killers, no doubt
---
don't start no shit and there wouldn't be any shit  
---
Someone could light a match and start up a fire in a forest, and you would say "well the fire isn't gonna put itself out anyways or listen to the person who started it"
---
or you know, just don't light matches in the first place... and at the very least you could TRY to put the fire out, instead of letting it burn for 3 months+  
---
Does any of this make sense to you? Even your lord and savior himself literally admitted he was wrong (ableit he should have done so wayyyyy sooner) but you are still out here defending him. So yes, that's what fanboys do.
---
1. Killer is responding to messages, maybe if people weren't bitching Nurse might be inclined to hook.
---
2. Maybe its punishment for DS. 
---
Killers job is to kill you, when I see someone crawl to me and spin I figure its a DS and chase someone else or wait to pick them up. How about survivors using Blendette to just hide when their team gets obliterated? 2 people hiding and only moving to avoid crows is the real hostage situation, even with Whispers hunting for a shadow in the shadows is no fun.
---
I think you're right. In that case, I'd say just increase the BP gains. Bloodhunts feel like how we should normally be earning BP.
---
The swf hurt me a lot when I was noob PD I dont go to shoot schools that is an american thing
---
Hey this isn’t related to the video but can you get WGLF past tier 1?
---
Right. It's just normally how the Internet thinks. YouTube, reddit, gaming are all toxic places in general. That may never change. The only thing that can effectively change is your mindset.
---
Practice the art of not giving a F, and you'll be set free from the BS the internet breeds.
---
Tbh I would agree, but it's totally personal. I just don't feel like Monto has charisma like Noob, and (no offense) find him a bit annoying to watch. His builds are on spot though.
---
Because a dev compared it to mint-rag hag to give a basic idea and then people left before they heard them spend 10 minutes explaining how different it really is. People are stupid and love to spout half-remembered tripe
---
Probably because he and his fans will always say that something is unbalanced and it needs to be fixed and if you disagree you are a toxic survivor main, toxic, etc. I personally agree with his views on the game, but not everyone likes his opinions about certain things. He genuinely wants to make the game less toxic and more balanced so he also gets toxic people who hate him.
---
He was rank 6. I think he was just having a really rough day. After I got unhooked he went to a barrel and started beating the shit out of it for like 3 minutes
---
And i think it is necessary.
---
I'm sorry this is just something we cannot agree on, as someone who gets tunneled to hell and back i am simply just tired of it. At this point yall are complaining that it is even in the game, sounds like yall would rather have original DS back.
---
He is the camera man.
---
Okay
---
They said you can teleport between two portals, not that there are only two. They also said that when standing on a portal you can see all other portals (base kit btw) implying that there’s a minimum of three available
---
Joey on the right looks like
---
"Frank, where's the survivors?"
---
"They're on the hook, see with the yellow aura."
---
"Okay, go kick a gen."
---
•Survivor gets unhooked with borrowed time•
---
"I see the problem."
---
"OH DO YA?!"
---
she didn't hook anyone the whole game. She slugged us until we died, Infectious Fright and Knock Out. I doubt they responded to messages for 2 minutes and forgot about the game :|
---
Yes, and no. Not everyone cares to wake up unless dream pallets.
---
I don't think that people should have to just tolerate others messaging them nasty things every time they play a game. It's a GAME, it's not that damn serious. 
---
You're just enabling people to continue to act this way.
---
https://youtu.be/mz296Izw-S8
---
What I and the other posters were referencing.
---
Because that's one less set of hands on generators. Plus, they're a much easier chase, and provide one less opportunity for the Survivors to heal. The only reason NOT to go for them is if the unhooker has Borrowed Time or you have Make Your Choice, in which case Borrowed Time can divert your attention, and Make Your Choice flips the priority, since the other person is now injured, and you have an opportunity to take out 2 health states in 1 strike.
---
It’s not supposed to, it’s supposed to be for mobility only
---
He's a crap "content creator" who had god awful ideas and an incredibly boring personality.
---
Why does anyone care what he thinks. It's wild that he makes any money at all in my opinion.
---
Noob is no where near as toxic as Ochido. I don’t see how noob is toxic anymore, he used to be but not really anymore.
---
This is so true. Played way back in beta and for a bit after release and honestly it's hilarious when the Jason has a sense of humor. Kermit voices, pedo/rapey voices, pretend-friendly, etc. It really made the game fun
---
I think they just need better loading screen tips, or better tutorials. Like a whole thing to read with obscure tips.
---
You’d best put them in a place with no lockers nearby or they’ll go right back into it.
---
Plus if they don’t wiggle you can’t drop them at 99%... I think? Sometimes when I’m trying to let someone go I press R like 15 times and then they randomly come off after that.
---
This is really one of those "depends" kinds of situations.
---
Perked/geared out swf?
---
No, doesn't really take a lot of skill beyond intermediate understanding of how the game is played. Being able to coordinate loadouts and communicate removes a lot of the need to be individually skilled.
---
Solo surv?
---
Yea. You have to have a much higher individual skill level to do well when you can't actively and quickly coordinate with your team.
---
Killer?
---
Against a bunch of low rank, solo survs? No. As long as you are basically proficient the killer is the power role in that situation.
---
Against a geared out, voice comms swf? Yes. You have to be more skilled and creative, or you are just gonna get shit on.
---
As much as I prefer DBD, F13 was very laid-back and casual. Which I quite liked.
---
Must be.
---
I agree for gameplay, though The King is my go-to for info. He has roped me back in multiple times after breaks.
---
It’s killer. Not to say survivor doesn’t take any skill. You have teammates you can rely on and carry you. And many survivors do. I’ve played games where I haven’t even seen the killer by the time the gens were completed.
---
Killer, it’s all you. You mess up once and you ve probably lost the game.
---
Like i said, he should have known better. But theres a reason kids arent allowed to do stuff like drink and smoke. Him being a kid doesnt make it right, but cut him some slack because of it
---
Sounds like u only consider a victory as a 4K. 65% chance to 3k is pretty high.
---
Yes of course. Playing as a killer whose sole objective is to kill and sacrifice 4 surviviros. Not letting them escape. And I'm sorry you think that's being a dick.
---
No. The one mentioned in the comment I RESPONDED TO, is already a good spawn.
---
Oh i never went to steam forums. I only come here.
---
I have 800 hours on killer. Spirit is op. I don't even remember the last time I got less than a 3k with Spirit.
---
And? That doesn't stop you from getting the achievement, especially with BT
---
Also Sweden and, I think, norway
---
No
---
Any killer with BBQ, preferably the best one you know how to use. In my case I farm BP with Billy or Nurse. Just average 20k BP per match and end them quickly.
---
GGEZ baby killer
---
This is a few months old but I found this clip again recently and had to share.
---
I don't think you know what a skill cap is.
---
Thank you Dave.
---
Huntress uses it more than any, and I hardly see a huntress without it.
---
It’ll be a few weeks from now, better to grind bloodpoints first so you can level Steve or Nancy when you get them
---
I wish I could find survivors who wouldn't save each other when I'm playing killer ROFL, easy dubs
---
Oh shit I assumed purple
---
I've seen survivors with high level skill still go down/ lose match. Weak links in team. 
---
Survivors take no skill? Wym. Did you just play survivor and suddenly became a God or something? I mean that would make sense, although u sound biased saying it takes no skill. 
---
Hell, all my friends I played with who have descent ranks, lack skill ;)
---
Hey hey hey! I do NOT kill babies! 
---
On a side note, I hadnt played in a while so deranked a bunch and now I'm only at rank 12. I periodically let a survivor live cause I appreciate when that happens to me as a survivor lol
---
Take off unrelenting and replace it with sloppy.
---
Thank you for this. I'm not on Reddit all day to see these.
---
Well, realistically, it depends in the map and on the killer. With Freddy, I can go all over the place and apply a lot of pressure no matter the size of the map. With Trapper, I best secure an area and do the three gen strat so when I hook, I'll obviously do so in my trapped area.
---
It is often due to Swf but it exclusively. If there aren’t many survivors in your region with decent ping then it’ll just throw whoever it can into your lobby, which sometimes means some pretty bad matchmaking.
---
They can get permanent banned if you and several people do properly report it with evidence. Once there’s the same issue and same player, dev will do thing eventually.
---
But what you say is quite right, we can’t do anything with that. I’m sure know someday, they will get what day deserved.
---
"Playing the game in the way you're supposed to" =/= "being a dick" but ok
---
Bamboozle isn't very good either. Sloppy is much better as it can either 
---
1. Discourage survivor's from healing, this creative insta-down potential
---
2. Waste more of the survivor's time, thus prolonging the game.
---
What does cyka blyat mean?
---
How can they win with this one?
---
This is part of the killers theme. It has been since 1974. He kills people and wears their skin. 
---
Either they make the cosmetic for every character, or none of the characters.
---
I know there are a lot of hyper sensitive anus's now days, but not everything has to be cause for the outrage of the week.
---
&gt;Thank you for this. I'm not on Reddit all day to see these.
---
Neither am I. I just used the search bar and grabbed everything with PTB on the title.
---
I'm eagerly awaiting the answer as well
---
It’s the plag my dudes!
---
red mori for ST kiddies you say? lmao
---
No offense but this is entirely the survivors’ faults.
---
Giving a shitty killer 4 kills just because that guy had NOED? Maybe the killer wasn't the only one who was shitty.
---
It's almost like you're planning to get hooked.
---
For a TL;DR as to why I don’t feel his opinions are wrong, look up Not Otzdarva and watch his video on why he hasn’t been uploading to his main  channel. It sums up YouTube and the algorithm as well as how sub boxes work.
---
Pardon me for not contributing to the echo chamber here, but the game itself is not very fun in its current state, and DG is a comparable game that shows what an asymmetrical game with the 1 killer versus 4 survivors trying to do an objective model looks like.
---
I also, as someone who doesn’t have a lot of money to my name, completely stand by a streamer/YouTuber returning to the big money maker of their content. Unfortunately content creation is a fuckin trap where you are eventually forced to focus on only one game or your rabid fan base tears you to shreds. Dead by Daylight, League of Legends, Dragon Ball FighterZ/Xenoverse, Dark Souls 3, I’ve witnessed many content bases going the same route.
---
If you make a video on something else you get fucking CRUCIFIED. Hell, look at Noob3’s Outlast playthrough or Monto’s Resident Evil playthrough. That’s the same quality content from the same creator and it has less views. HMMMMM. Maybe you should play your main brand game if you want to maximize viewership, and maybe that gets stale!
---
And at least he’s not trying to lie to everyone about it and act like “oh the game is so great I decided to come back! Is honesty really that wrong? Nah, I think people are just looking for reasons to witch-hunt. The man said he dislikes a game and people are acting like he kicked a fucking puppy on live television. He’s a guy like the rest of us and has a full fledged family to support currently. Chill the fuck out.
---
ItS jUsT a PiG aNd HaG mIx
---
Thier is hackers in every game
---
This game would be way better if everyone had guns
---
That’s not what I said. Like at all.
---
Why is man of medan there if it isn't even out
---
You're not talking about how he cheated but then you proceed to talk and voice your opinion about how he cheated. ??? You're entitled to opinion and all and I respect it but you just contradicted yourself so badly.
---
I use Plague since it’s the only one of my killers with BBQ max leveled, that plus a cake offering and I get 60-75k bloodpoints per match
---
I just tap while drinking/eating
---
So your girlfriend moans sound like a dying middle-aged man?
---
Uh, nice?
---
A lot of people make the mistake of trying to get their victim to get to the Broken status when it's sometimes easier and much faster to just hit them to make them injured. 
---
My advice is: Use your best judgement. If a survivor is hard to hit with your vomit but close enough to hit, then just attack them. If you have emetic addons then yes it might be faster to get them to broken before downing them. 
---
Keep an eye out for windows and pallets that would let survivors waste your time.
---
I getcha, but to my credit, the game disappeared and Rocket League was highlighted on Steam so I was thinking you were like "fuck this imma play some RC soccer."
---
They might have missed the skill check and ruined themselves over lol
---
Did you have it at tier three?
---
But yea, some people just enjoy trying to be toxic and then have nothing to say when they get called out on their stupidity. It is what it is
---
No, he got caught once and then did it again.
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED
---
Honest truth though, if you aren’t coordinated don’t go for late game hook saves. You have no idea how many times I’ve turned a bad immersive game into a 3k because the survivors didn’t have a plan. If you’re by yourself leave by yourself.
---
Yes. Both of them.

Does manually leaving the match as killer (as opposed to ALT+F4) count as a bannable offense? Is it the same with survivors?

Above OP said he’s been playing for about 2500-3000 hours. Longer if you’re playing survivor.

I mean, from my time played as a killer, at rank 16 you learn that in order to catch a survivor that is close to a "jumping spot" you just turn around and so there will be no window to jump and the only "action" nearby is to get him on your shoulder .-.
---
At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it. I award you no upvotes, and may The Entity have mercy on your soul (by taking it quickly).

Maybe she's a stick shift

I wasn't saying that I had a personal hate against it, I was simply putting out a reason as to why people might DC against it.
---
Yeah, that’s why I avoid sending messages to people. You never know who you’re playing against and i’m sure i’ve pissed people off myself.

What exactly does the Plagues vomit do to survivors statistically?
---
Think of it like this. The perk activates. That means a survivor is 32m away. So you start heading to the gen that looks 32m away from you. 80% of the time, you'll see a survivor.
---
Keep killing em
---
HAHAHA so accurate
---
Tunnel + Facecamp + Noed + Blood warden
---
Good point
---
And this is why you don't do that.
---
Now this is the content I come here for
---
yeah i know but playing 5 games and having all 5 killers be face campers and tunnelers is anger inducing.
---
What do you think huntresses mom looks like?
---
Wait, we only got 2 back to back licensed DLCs, ghost face and then the demogorgon. Unless you’re counting the Freddy rework as one of those DLCs?
---
Both are bannable. On PS4 closing app (which is console ALT-4) makes everyone lose their points, so I’m that way it’s more likely to be banned due to more reports, while a regular DC as killer that still rewards 5k survival is less cared about
---
Prove Thyself is decent for bp if playing survivors, but you have to do gens together. Killers are definitely the best way to earn bp, even without bbq.
---
&gt;Wait, we only got 2 back to back licensed DLCs, ghost face and then the demogorgon. Unless you’re counting the Freddy rework as one of those DLCs?
---
We also got Ash Williams before Ghost Face.
---
It may just be the fact that I’m Rank 17 atm, but almost 75% of the time, I see Whispers activates, I go to the gen and there’s no survivor and no scratch marks. I search the area and find nobody. I almost never check the lockers because giant waste of time.
---
i was really tempted to do that

It definitely works when the killer isn’t tunneling

this is so creative i love it ♥️

Right but 1 DS gets makes you question everyone.
---
Also; 60 seconds is a long time in a hectic game. If I get hit by DS it's usually because I downed the guy I thought I didn't hook and then blamo
---
This is what I’ve always needed in my life. :D
---
but you responded you had all maxed characters as if you didn't have anywhere to spend your bloodpoints.
---
Unpopular opinion but I'd say survivor, killer just seems a lot more difficult because the penalty for any mistake in game outweigh that of a survivor tenfold. I don't think being penalised harder for a mistake means it requires more skill. Like in Street Fighter, a top tier character has like a hundred tools to apply constant pressure and deal damage and is easy to execute, whereas a low tier character has to be more skillful in working around those tools because his own tools are trash. But the "easy mode" top tier character has lower max health so one mistake and he takes a shit ton of damage, while the low tier character has more health so he doesn't get penalised so hard for one mistake.
---
Id say bbq because its way less likely to appear then rancor is. Like i dont even know the last time bbq was on the shrine besides a few months ago
---
*ouch*
---
I am of the opinion that while it is easy to qualify the difference between SwF and solo survivor (specifically: SwF is better than solo survivor), it is impossible to quantify that difference. **As such, no amount of mechanical changes can fix it in a way that will solve the problem definitively**; any such change will either be too punishing (to SwF) or too generous (to solo survivor). You may think from that "well, why not be generous to solo survivors", but then I raise you that if you buff survivors in any way, you make playing killer worse, which will drive away killer players. This will make queue times worse, which in turn makes the game worse for everyone. 
---
As I believe that a mechanical solution is impossible, I propose a psychological solution wherein increasing the rewards you receive when you are playing in unfavorable circumstances will make you feel less bad about being put in those unfavorable circumstances.

Temple of Purgation is part of the Red Forest realm. So it uses a Red Forest map offering. Think about it- there isn’t an offering for each Coldwind Farm map, is there? Just one offering for the five maps associated with it.
---
Temple of Purgation shares the Red Forest realm with Mother’s Dwelling- so if you use a Red Forest offering (The Last Mask), you have a 50/50 chance of getting Temple.
---
That is good advice, but it’s still sooo much stronger than other killers
---
Don't have Netflix, and that's not Ash unless he's personally kicking the Killer's ass.

Just wait until fixated drops lmao

in case any newish players should check this out: if you are in this or a similar situation just turn away from the window and the promt for vaulting will disappear so you can pick up the survivor\^\^

I've gotten rank 1 solo survivor a few times and although you may think it's a good accomplishment is really isn't worth anything. k just yoinked a screenshot and went back to playing for fun with my girlfriend, which is honestly far better than sweating alone
---
No*
---
It's random. Just keep getting uour perks to 3 so they get off your bloodwebs amd you'll get more variety. If given the options between a t1 or t2 perk, always take the higher tier if you're still hunting for perks
---
i just shined a tier 2 flashlight at myers right in his eyeballs and it did nothing...
---
That would be where you suggested you can just adapt with an implied any Killer, with Nurse being essentially cheating, rather than Nurse being one of the only Killers who has a chance at red ranks and some being borderline useless.
---
if you’re not the best at running from the killer, i would say med kit. if you’re good at running from the killer, i’d say toolbox.
---
Same here with Trapper
---
You'll get the teachable next level, they don't dissapesr until you buy it
---
What's with this useless poop comment?
---
Yup exactly what happened anxiety through the roof lol.
---
maybe that's why he let me get the hatch at the end lol
---
Distressing just makes you hit the cap for BP in the Devious category faster. It doesn't actually award more points.
---
For instance, if it would take you 4 minutes to max out the Devious category, Distressing reduces that to 2 minutes to max it out.
---
The category BP cap is still 8000 and the total BP cap is still 32k. Only BBQ and WGLF increase the amount you earn.
---
Definitely BBQ and Chili teachables repeat each bloodweb till they're taken you're totally safe GET DAT BBQ MMMMMM

As for the windows, get around it tbh. I know it sounds like I’m being all “lol 5head” about this bit it’s the same with absolutely everything that a killer uses, work around it or die.
---
So it's reasonable to demand further invulnerability, but bitching when the status quo is comfortable despite the animation issues. Cool.
---
That's a global Killer nerf when there are only four viable Killers at red ranks now. Dedicated servers, like most things, are coming too late.
---
Then get BBQ. You'll be able to get the teachable next bloodweb.
---
Im writing this on a throwaway account for the same reasons as the op. I'm also in the exact same situation he is, with one exception. I've actually gotten banned for 24hrs due to the recent multiple killers bug. Either they didn't notice or they let it slip since I'm definetly a whale for them and I've spent a few hundred bucks on this game. Either way, Im also all over removing these legacies if possible ...

They don’t own most tv shows, they didn’t ruin Star Wars, they tried to make it up to the kid because it’s a long-standing company policy to not allow that, they only own fox entertainment not the rest of it, and they don’t own most animation studios.

They’re literally just a big company, and comparatively aren’t even that big compared to actual industry titans. The company who makes whatever device you’re typing this on is 100000x shittier than Disney lmao.

please PLEASE PLEASE post this some more god i crave it I am at least semi-chubbed rtight now i'm losing my fucking MIND

Just posted about someone doing this to me. Yeah, just a good practice to try to understand it's a game, everyone's trying to have fun, maybe even escape some of their life in some way, no reason to do that. Best thing to do, msg them and ask if they wanna play together and maybe they could learn from u and Visa versa. Props for calling urself out tho
---
ooh I want to do this! we would have to have a discord or something similar
---
You say that but both sides of rank 1 are full of godawful players. Literally anyone with enough free time can hit rank 5+ and before they made pipping harder you could just grind rank 1 as well
---
This is like comparing apples and oranges.
---
Not really. There are rank 1 survivors who can’t loop and rank 1 killers who don’t know how to end chases.
---

It's basically dbd but for mobile but like not really. It came out last year on mobile before actual dbd mobile was released. I just put it as flair as a joke

Most facecampers are new players, so I actually can’t resist feeling good for them for finally getting that one kill.
---
Have at ya buddy. One day you’ll be the best killer known to man.
---
True. My cannon is that its just a spell trapping him in an endless loop in the entity's void. He snaps out of it eventually in the span of 5 minutes irl time though. Think of it as "power leveling your hero duties".

In short the ranking up you get for a good game. In the end game screen when you get to the emblem screen that red bar below the emblems has a white markers and, if you are rank 15 or above a black one as well. The markers are the pips. Each white one you get to goes towards you leveling up. Earn enough and you move up in rank. The black mark is a safety pip meaning you don't go down in level is you can get enough emblems to get to that point. Too many bad games and you can de rank but, not below level 16
---
Both have a place in my basement.
---
Well One thing id say is that playing survivor I can just chill and listen to stuff in the background while I play but with killer if I wanna get a 4k at times you gotta focus and listen to find survivors it does depend because playing high-end survivor can take still but overall I would say playing high end killer is tougher overall its very hard to tell because there is a lot of variety in skill levels and different situation for example to be able to have everyone escape against a face camping killer takes more skill than camping but to get a 4k at rank one against the 4 stack SWF Claudette using flashlight takes more skill than being in the group
---
Those shitty rank 1 survivors/killers are still better than MOST rank 10 survivors/killers

I have been watching their videos for years now and just recently bought DBD.
---
you guys really don't let jokes go
---
I play a lot of scream and hag, smacking a Survivor with sloppy and letting them go to go smack another is more valuable to me.
---
It's like downing them cause self care takes forever to do so by the time they are done healing, someone's on the hook and I've kicked a Gen. If I see they are fully healed quite quickly even without bbq I have a general idea of where they went, sometimes even knowing exactly what locker they went into.
---
As an angel he has to get consent to possess someone
---
I think his videos are good to teach how to loop a specific killer. Everything else is not very educational
---
Survivor is harder to learn. You cant judt pick up survivor and do well.
---
Killer is harder to master. Easier time early on when everyone is stupid, harder high ranks when all 5 players know what they're doing.
---
This also happened to me on the Game a few hours ago. Didn't even bother wiggling I just wanted to die at that point
---
Good.
---
Damn can't even have fun on the subreddit.
---
No official date yet, unless the news of the PTB broke and I missed it. Though typically we get a week of PTB followed by a dead week before the patch launches. I know alot of people think tomorrow for the PTB. If that happens then we should get it on the 11th of September
---
First the PTB has to come out (likely tomorrow), and then 2 weeks after that the chapter comes out. This means the chapter is likely coming out September 10.
---
GOODBYE KITTY
---
Quentin has the best survivor prestige and he also looks like Gollum.
---
Good for you! so you must know the basics then, so good luck in your trials!
---
I feel like youre missing my point. Teenagers make mistakes, and they make them a lot. You definitely call them out on it, but also have to treat them like the kids they are.
---
&gt;First the PTB has to come out (likely tomorrow), and then 2 weeks after that the chapter comes out. This means the chapter is likely coming out September 10.
---
I think it should be out on September 17th if not later. I don't remember from previous PTB, BHVR ending a PTB and immediately releasing the patch. Unless someone can refresh my memory.
---
Well, yeah, I can see that. Nobody's behaviour changed that significantly, though. That's what made it interesting. The whole thing was just framed more comedically and located somewhere less...desperate.
---
I hit this at rank 10 and only reason I have noed is because I'm still new and barely have any teachables
---
Whenever I destroy an SWF with a toxic vet with a new player, I tell the new player not to be toxic and teach them what they did wrong. I even tell them they can add me and I'll teach them how to loop, blind etc. I've had a few take me up on it and they say the game is more enjoyable once they understood it doesn't have to be frustrating.
---
Looking at it from this angle the Dead Hard looks obvious, but I know if I was the killer I’d fall for it too and spend the next 3 matches thinking about it
---
Jake.
---
Thats how I feel with wraith and doctor
---
Yeah, in a few days I got rank 10 with survivor and killer. One thing they never teach is how bloodweb and levels work
---
Trapped in a time vortex like the transition from ED2 to AoD. Maybe it's just a psychic projection of Ash that physically can't fight.
---
&gt;How long does it usually take between a reveal video and for the DLC to come out? Im trying to decide if I should start saving blood points now or if I have time
---
Save bloodpoints now and if you want to continue playing in the meantime after reaching the 1 mil cap, spend just ~200k and grind it back.
---
The grand majority of people i obviously let live on death hook (hell sometimes just with pointedly hooking everyone twice) will recognize and at least acknowledge it in my experience.
---
Takes a special kind of stupid to still be oblivious or toxic afterwards and i just pity those people tbh.
---
They were treated fine and with respect? It’s all Gun’s wrong-doing.
---
https://gamerant.com/friday-the-13th-lawsuit-new-game/
---
I think there was a point in time where every creator in the DbD community was hated pretty much.
---
Like, I think his name is Ochido who got banned for numerous reasons and one of them was toxicity. When he got banned there was a bit of a discussion on why he got banned and deserved it and a lot of people were basically naming every other person who made videos and/or streamed that player mostly survivor and they got problems for it.
---
Meme as hard as you want, but legit, why wouldn't you go for the unhooked besides farming or being nice?
---
Well, Borrowed Time being meta might be a factor.
---
Oh yeah, but once you start buying stuff with bloodpoints, it gets pretty simple,  and with levels that was also confusing with me as well so I just looked up online a lot
---
It's a preference thing
---
There are some popular dbd youtubers (Monto, No0b3, Tru3ta1ent, Puppers, OhTofu) and people usually like 3-4 of them and hate the rest
---
With that kind of grace you probably pulled yourself off the hook in the second state
---
I'm a casual player, I always play survivor and hang around rank 14-15 or so. I've wanted to play killer in the past but I am just SO bad at it. I've only sacrificed all 4 survivors once ever and most of the time all four escape no problem. I want to play killer but I'm tired of embarrassing myself. What are your suggestions on how to git gud (or git passable?)
---
it's our reward for all the hope we've been feeding the entity
---
I’d say the Game, most killers fare pretty well on there, and it’s a smaller map length wise because of the two stories.
---
It shoots miniature kitchen knives
---
It's always been 2 weeks between.
---
IT'S IN THE RULEBOOK!
---
I don't see the corn moving in your video when she's out of phase either. But all of them make sound, therefore she is moving them how she does, in or out of phase. To be honest I've never actually watched to see if they physically move, but I know for certain they all make noise, so I try and avoid stepping on it.
---
Tip for newbies: don't buy bad teachable perks. They just fill your bloodweb with trash. Recently got hag to level 40 and I didn't find a single hex ruin level 2
---
Hmm, that's the Kate perk, right? I need to get her.
---
Yeah it is
---
I pulled myself off after the entity claimed me, actually
---
That's pretty much it. Camping is SPITE (at least, face camping vs. Proxy/Insidious camping), but tunnelling is a symptom of bad game design. The ideal to win is to rapidly eliminate Survivors, and tunnelling makes that happen faster without perks blocking it.
---
Well I mean for what you have... its fine but id still take anything over unrelenting, maybe NoED or bamboozle?
---
I was half expecting the survivor to disconnect before you got to the hook.
---
17 isn't a child. You'll usually be tried as an adult. It's not like he's 13. He was months away from voting. Most 17 year Olds don't want to be treated like children either.
---
At first I was almost going to take these seriously, if only I saw how much of a fool I was
---
&gt;Edit: to xlarify, they usually close the PTB after one week.
---
Not that I remember but I could be wrong. They can only release patches on Tuesdays so IIRC the first week they gather all the data and if necessary, they release a patch for the following week and gather more data to see how it played out. After the 2nd week, they close it and release the patch on live on the third week.
---
We should have one around halloween too.
---
Could make BT implicit and make the perk also give a speed boost to the unhooked. At least makes it harder to tunnel.
---
Bloodhound and nurses are both very good perks for Legion. Bloodhound shows the blood and gives you a tracking tool in a chase with their power. Also since the power change more survivors actually heal against them than before so nurses is great for finding survivors after you have used your power.
---
I know why the jake is camping, he want that hatch
---
That's actually a popular demand and you're fair to make it.
---
That’s a lot of holy shits.

Watch Ardetha's coaching videos on YouTube. Youtube in general is the best way to see how the best killers play but Ardetha's videos are especially helpful.

Lolol possibly, I guess we'll never know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

---
Got another idea.
---
Most of the times I saw "counterplay", it seemed just like tru3 fucking up. Yes, survivors can play in ways that can cause a spirit to make more mistakes, but it comes from a place of guesswork. Those chases were still wildly weighed in his favor.
---
I saw that he got a 2k(wow the last 2 escaped through a key, an also unbalanced item)
---
A 3k(Last person escaped through hatch)
---
And a 4k.
---
All I saw was Tru3 make a few mistakes, and still have a successful game.
---
That's what I interpret from these clips.
---
Pallet is space by default, healing and untrapping is M1.  
---
I think she was just being silly lol. But still. YEEET
---
By one person so far? I don’t really care though. I find Sam funny but I found him relatively recently too. I like his dbd animations specifically, it’s just a fun little series where he parodies the characters.

Same here, except as Nurse specifically. Though it wouldn’t bother me because, apparently, most toxic survivors lack at least a rudimentary understanding of English grammar, so they would just sound dumb.
---
(Assuming its not a full 4 man SWF) Killer has to manage the full match and 4 survivors, but survivors have to be more adaptive. Unless its a shit map, killers can run the same strat they always do with their main without much change. Survivors strategy depends ALOT more on the killers playstyle than vice versa. Every second matters so killers gotta stay active, where survivors can waste some time and be fine. But, survivors need a more complete game to be good every match. Killers who’re extremely strong at chases or protecting gens can rely on that skill alone and 3/4k. So imo killers have a tougher job, survivors need a more complete set of skills and is harder to learn.

Searching for a lobby

A lot of rare, and uncommon add ons and offerings are borderline useless. Once you've gotten all the good stuff in a bloodweb, get commons to reduce bloodpoints spent. Also try to do it in a strategic order so the entity kills all the expensive trash stuff, while also possibly eliminating multiple useless nodes.
---
&gt;It's always been 2 weeks between.
---
You are right. I double checked and edited my comment. Thanks for the correct info.
---
Very fitting line for Steve, too.
---
Nice, dude. I've got about five-six killers left to P3.
---
I mean... I'm quite sure many people would still buy it...
---
Yeah, I was using Beast of prey, distressing and BBQ (and depending on who I was playing a filler perk, wraith I usually used sloppy butcher or nurses calling, Doc would get unnerving, nurse got shadowborn, etc) with a heavier focus on not killing to avoid ranking up while pulling as much BP as I could.  I prefer using wraith as you'll get 1100 per surprise hit and if youre short on hunting you can cloak and uncloak to catch up. Old legion was better as you could farm brutality, but since they made his power take longer to charge and require a full charge it takes way too long.
---
anticipating that dead hard made me clench so hard lol awesome! :)
---
Well, yeah, farming is impossible to not camp. Obviously you're going to hit players in front of you.
---
Derankers are pathetic. In some games, smurfing can be fun because it lets you do things you'd ordinarily get destroyed trying, but tryharding newbies gets victories so hollow they actually diminish one's dignity.
---
Hey that's me
---
Looping videos are what I need to survive!
---
Well my post got removed. Weird. Didnt post a gamertag of the person or anything. Confusing to me
---
Honestly, I think I speak for all of us (except those contrarians who hate Stranger Things because it’s “overrated) when I say, this is a million times better than a time-limited summer event. Hands down.

This is a guide on how to run tiles as killer, but somewhere in the video he says that what the surv in the video can be used as an example for survivors on how to run tiles.

---
OoO activates outside the TR. It isn't hard to control when you do/don't see the killer with it either.
---
Babysitter isn't needed, if the unhooked survivor is potato enough to still get caught off an unhook while the killer is miles away that's their fault and the hidden scratch marks won't help much.
---
I know the point of Babysitter, you don't need to explain it to me. Doesn't mean it's a shit perk that doesn't give enough benefit to warrant using over similar tools that accomplish the same thing, and if anything benefits killer more with things like Make Your Choice.
---
They need to make that a real perk
---
My man knows what I want
---
Because you are!

**MATCH RESULT: HE NO LIKE THE BANANA.**
---
I followed ya on twitch. So you’re not a complete failure. Where are you from?
---
is that monto?
---
Relativ tame? Yoh kidding right, I take any mobs over this or any online shooter, there you at least have fun and can do against bs like other playersike blocking them etc, but dbd devs don't care they want money!
---
The power promotes tunneling and probably wouldn’t be fun to play against.
---
The 2 first perks are OP though.
---
1st: The obsession is going to be doing a lot of skillchecks and being able to gain 3 tokens for it, which is basically 3 people exposed as ghostface but there is no timer,  would be very OP. Not to say that you can infinitely get tokens as long as you spend them. It is basically an infinite Myers without stalking. I think it should be each time the obsession is hooked you gain a token up to a max of 1 token. When you hit a survivor they are instantly downed and it consumes one token. If you miss an attack or get stunned, you will lose a token.
---
2nd: the speed boosts are massive and last forever and it is easy to get stunned. I think each stun should increase your movement speed by 5%, but when you hook someone you put someone into the dying state or hook someone, you loose all the speed boosts. This can also be a token perk.
---
3rd: I think this is a fine perk and will have good synergy with Surge.
---
Stuff that is considered toxic is typically things that you do on purpose to ruin other people’s fun/enjoyment of the game. Stuff like camping near someone who’s hooked or constantly being focused on killing one singular survivor while ignoring everyone else can be considered toxic. It’s all mostly situational and it’s extremely objective. 
---
A lot of the time survivors will end up calling you toxic if they feel they were either treated unfairly or are just grumpy that they didn’t get their way. No matter what you do there will always be players who get upset and call you toxic even if you didn’t do anything wrong. 
---
There are a plethora of things that are considered “toxic” in this game by a lot of people so don’t worry if someone decides to randomly call you a “trashy toxic camping tunneler” and stuff like that.
---
Jeff THE MAN.
---
First off: play how you want. There are counters to all "toxic" playstyles and acting like every game must play out the same way makes the game only less interesting. 
---
That being said, these are some things that are considered toxic for killers to do, by survivors. And a small stab.. (guess is a good word but I am a killer player myself) at why they feel this way
---
Camping is just sitting next to a hooked survivor waiting for them to a) Die or B) for their team mates to show up for easy hits/downs. This is considered toxic because it just feels unfun. The hooked survivor cant do anything but wait and if he doesn't get unhooked he dies and loses the game. Feels shitty. 
---
Tunneling is targeting a survivor who has already been hooked and is injured for an easy down and follow up hook. Toxic for the same reasons- the survivor really cant do much except his best to evade the killer, which given the nature of the game cant happen forever. The survivor feels helpless. And his team mates feel the need to unhook him, which will most likely get them hit and/or downed and then chased and perhaps camped.
---
You might as well learn about NOED now. If you're new. Hex: No One Escapes Death (killer perk) allows for instant downs once the survivors have powered the exit gates and also speeds the killer up. Very powerful endgame perk, and the only viable counterplay is to a)destroy all the totems before the gens are done or b)find the totem after the gates are powered and it is lit up.
---
Tl;dr- survivors in general dont like it when killers stand next to hooked survivors as it makes it a big crap chute for them. And survivors dont like being tunneled (being chased immediately after unhooks to get downed and killed) and NOED... well just read the NOED section. 
---
All this said; play how you want. No one will ever be happy and you'll be called camper, tunneler, trash, noob, baby killer, and other even worse names just for how you play. Survivors do gens, get chased, and die on hooks. Killers have to stop the gens, chase and kill survivors. How you reach that goal is up to you.
---
I usually get a ton of friendly thank yous from people on xbox. At the worst times i find myself farming, walking by a Claudette who was crouching, staring at the wall then i stared in disbelief and we ended up staring at each other then we farmed lmao
---
This happened in one of my games. However, when she stopped running it stopped. It started after she fell awkwardly off of a hill so maybe it’s something like that. Still pretty broken but funny.
---
Go and play cs go you will learn a lot of Russian Xd
---
Blind Huntress
---
No problem!
---
i tried to short tele to get a kill and found myself in the basement like 20 yards away, earlier today
---
I really hope console players will be able to play with other console players. I don’t know about letting them play with PC players though as that could potentially give PC players an unfair advantage. Other games do it so I’m not too sure.
---
I feel like Behavior has a glasses fetish.
---
do you know? no? because they havent said yet. so why would anyone else know?
---
Big ups on PainReliever. His commentary at key moments is really helpful especially to newer players like me. He also acknowledges his misplays and tells what should be done in that situation.
---
I think, before, people would have said 'fat chance' to this, but now that we got Stranger Things with DBD...well, anything's possible!
---
Haha lol totally
---
Sloppy is actually very good on Ghostface. He’s able to remove his terror radius and sneak up on survivors for a free hit, so if they want to be safe they have to heal against him. Sloppy+Nurses allows you to find and sneak up on them while they’re healing, it works wonders
---
Jen, Scott and umbra are kinda niche tastes. Scott just seems very negative about the game and like he isn’t enjoying it much. Umbra is an interesting character, and seems nice, but not always the best for streaming. And maybe I’ve just gotten really unlucky with Jen’s streams but I only ever see her complaining and insulting the people she plays with/against. I don’t personally enjoy listening to someone bitch about v,w,x,y and z thing that killer did that you didn’t like, same for people playing killer, I’d rather watch someone who seems to be enjoying the game
---
Then what do you propose?
---
Yeah I know, but in this video OP's action is RB so I naturally assumed this was on console. It is the same action if you use a controller.
---
if all else fails just throw the pad at the wall and hope you hit great skill check
---
yeah yeah, I don’t get you, bro. So a 17-year-old means OMG IM A SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD SO IT MEANS IM MATURE AND I HAVE TO KNOW EVERYTHING! Well, props to you if you did but I'm sorry that not everyone is like you.
---
What it seems like the entity did was corrupt her miserable father (Ezmoney) and then be like "wow she's really angry at the fact she's about to be murdered even though she doesn't have any real unjustified hatred in her heart whatsoever, that looks like prime evil material" and jumped ship with her vengeful soul. I get it man you're a transcendental layer of abstract evil with sentience, you make your own rules, but do you really gotta do her like that when you already got Mr Samurai? 
---
I do think it was a smart aversion but still super duper sad
---
I see your not a man of culture as well
---
I think the killer power needs to be changed, it’s close to hag and pig, it’s not fun to play against, and it doesn’t help you at all in the Endgame.
---

Genuinely the only time I would ever consider playing Legion or buying a skin for them. I really hope this makes it into the game. Good job. You made it so cute.
---
Certainly beats another stupid skin for Joey who is a name not even a character.

Dang it, you accidentally saw through my trap

Yes! 😍

Ok, i'll try

If you are feeling extra spicy when a nurse goes to blink run towards them, a good nurse can counter it but it works a lot of the time but apart from that just be extra careful with terror radius and be ready to move at any time. Sneaking can work well but not every time
---
Because the last event, was one of the worst for camping that I've ever experienced since I started playing this game. With Stranger Things coming out  shortly after, it's going to be a nightmare. PC is not bad, but console is.
---
big boy myers
---
I'd actually like to see this, people might say we already have a clown, but we have two killers with chainsaws. Who knows maybe one day! Probably not soon since a chaper is just dropping, and we just got a licensed killer.
---
nah. learn to use the search function this shit gets posted multiple times an hour

You can't buy licensed content with shards.

The only thing you were missing were a few teabags to make sure the killer knew who their daddy was

The funny thing is i did tbag at the end, i just did it after I recorded the clip
---
What would be his ability? Stab Toes?
---
Lol same!
---
True, you’re right. Honestly all the licensed killers feel kind of weird because their designs seem forced to have to match the movies causing them to really just be too weak or too overpowered and then gutted with a patch shortly after release. Except Myers. He’s pretty good
---
Tier 3 DS lasts for a minute after you get off the hook
---
But not with the new pennywise please.
---
I didn't say that. I guess I'm just a toxic killer and survivor main. I bully survivors and I bully killers. I teabag at pallets and do other toxic stuff them go down but I'm not complaining am I?

You actually can. There was a match I had a few months ago against a Pig. She was creeping on an Ace on a gen and I snuck up behind her. She went to go around the tree we were next to, saw she was blocked, and turned around to see my elongated head nodding at her in the mist. She lost her shit and started spam roaring, hit the tree and then lost both me and Ace. One of the funniest things I've had happen to me as survivor lol
---
It depends on what your considering toxic. To my knowledge he hasn't done the witch hunt stuff or hacks etc. However, and this is coming from someone who loves Monto's content, I have noticed recently he has been dipping his toe in the toxic pool usually with his end game comments saying things like EZ. I wouldn't say he was fully their but I have noticed him do more toxic things recently.
---
If there's Ruin I'll DC Prayer Beads
---
I don't mind when killers slug and have the entity take me,  I like the animations as well. It's when I just have to lay and bleed out because a killer is being a dick or scared I MIGHT just wiggle free. Like I'd have to open a whole ass door and lose him,  most likely not happening anyways. I did nothing to annoy him,  except play well. I guess that's not ok to post killers.
---
If I listed every single one, this comment would be worth a post of its own AND it would get very inaccurate. As you can see, I watched Tru3 on youtube, not on Twitch, and because most of the videos there are on the Killer side AND he's so good at it, I assumed he plays mostly killer. 
---
Now imagine me making similar mistakes but about 30 other youtubers/streamers. I'd rather talk about something I know, than something that I've heard about.
---
Holy shit,  well thanks for letting me know. I'm to ashamed to say how long I've been playing this game and never realized that. Lolololol.
---
This would be awesome. I really want to kill people as Pennywise
---
My mind is blown. I never knew. Lobby dodging here I come.
---
well you are on xbox, so its okay
---
I think I have a cure. How about some games against good Spirit or omega blink Nurse.
---

---
It's really annoying because I have a hard stance against buying overpriced cosmetics, but they absolutely factor us in, up the price, and make the same money will get way from people who would pay any price and don't care at all.
---
It's a lose situation for players in any market with cosmetics, and it's fully up to the devs to let you know how much they give a shit about you, as your lack of buying doesn't matter to them at all in the end.
---
Don’t worry.. Non toxic survivors can never win.

SWF Bad. Playing well bad. Crutch perks bad.

Except Mr. Herman, who done day decided he was goint to be a son of a bitch and he did.

I'm starting to see that,  guess I'll have to start being a pos then maybe the game will be fun again. I'm purple ranks I thought I'd be out of shit like this.
---
I usually use it to see the killer and send a gl hf, or to see if it is one of the many OCE ps4 players that love to bring op shit every game. Simple dodge at that point. hope you get some decent games.

What does the Plagues vomit do to survivors statistically?

Yes, he is.

Feel free to provide an example of a consistently better Spirit player.

Kinda do go hand in hand.

I never said you can't have an opinion but this is Reddit so if I want to, I can give mine

Thank you,  you as well!
---
I have gone off Tru3 recently. He seems like a decent guy but the last few times I dropped into his stream he was being very negative and he was clearly fed up. I have also experienced the fact you can't have an opinion against Tru3 as I had one of his mods debating with me as if I was insulting him when I was only saying he should just ignore the trolls and that's why they hound him because he always reacts. I get it though they get a lot of hate, said mod had someone mori spam them just because they were Tru3's mod. They have wrapped themselves in a hyper defensive bitter bubble so constructive criticism sometimes makes them lose their shit because they think your just another person being horrible.
---
Purple ranks are the worst. I prefer green or red. Purple is just full of hateful people. Just play how you always played and ignore baby’s like that Ghostface. Kill them with Kindness.
---
the biggest counter to toxicity is just /dc
---
Jason's power is that he can't be killed and he's almost impossible to stop. His power would probably revolve around immunities/resistances. I can't imagine he'd even notice you dropping a pallet on his head.
---
You literally said he is just trying to enjoy his game,  okay and I guess I'm not. Like I bought the shit too,  so why do surviviors not deserve fun? That's right we do, but I guess only if we are toxic. Lolololol.
---
Yes please. So I can finally sync my accounts.
---
You're welcome :D &lt;3 it's really fun
---
This. This puts a smile on my face.
---
Downvote for watching it.
---
If I've done nothing to provoke it, and they do it more than once, then I make sure they die quickly and get as few points as possible. Pretty simple.
---
360’ing is a bit simple since the killers auto aim literally sucks. However, don’t rely on it because sometimes it won’t work. I’d say that you should pay attention to the tiles that are around the map. For example, Jungle Gyms ( 1 of many tiles in a map ) will have a pallet and a window. Also, there are some looping tips on YouTube that you can watch! They have proven to be pretty helpful to me!
---
I believe it’s 100 per
---
More like when the Hag has been exploding all around you for 5 generators.
---
Ah okay. So its basically the deterrent from you getting hooked immediately after already get off a hook. Alright. I just thought it was something you could use as a trump card. In some videos I see the survivors always use it at the last minute, so I never took into account that they were still within the time of DS and readying to use that
---
If you can die you are not holding the game hostage. You can still die to EGC when you’re being slugged. If you get forced to DC tho because killer blocked you in a corner when you’re the last one left when hatch is open it is bannable. 
---
Holidng the game hostage is when people are forced to DC to get out of the match. This shouldn’t be bannable because the game CAN end one way or another.
---
Next time you could be the extra panel.
---
Exactly. The perk was reworked to be the perfect one time anti-tunnel perk.
---
7000 hours in Dota 2, trust me you would not want to trade DBD for that experience.
---
I think it's not all too bad because we watch and learn and by the time is comes out we already know how to play.        Still would like ptb in console tho
---
I used [this guide](https://reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c9my67/how_to_get_dead_by_daylight_mobile_on_ios/) and it’s been working great, but now I’m getting the same message as you when I go to update it. The app still works though, despite that. Dunno if you can still do it, I’m not very tech-savvy lol. Sorry if it doesn’t work out.
---
so it's yourself that is in charge of the punishment.
---
So that devotion is at least worth something
---
Actually, Its 3 vaults not 5
---
How about getting all of them to max now? All perks it is. It's about the same BP than getting to p3 50

give my survivors some sokoban puzzles please behavior
---
even if they already know the answer or if the puzzles were too easy, they would still waste a lot of time moving boxes around
---
Due to the save game loss stuff that happened a long long while back
---
I lost my full legacy outfit for one of my survivors.
---
I emailed them over the course of 2 years (not every month, like maybe once every 3-4 months, when I was actually playing the game)  (my actual first email about the legacy stuff I sent them was back in 2017, same month, but on the 29th instead)
---
They literally said every time
---
They don't have an answer
---
I ask for compensation for having lost it and more than likely never getting it back, I got no response

But that's just what I went through.

Yeah but that requires more licensing probably..

Practice is a huge part of learning, but getting some better knowledge is important too. I’d recommend looking up some HybridPanda videos on YouTube, he’s very good at the game, on top of being funny and not toxic at all.

YES PLEASE
---
I'D BUY IT

Goodbye Danny

I found this very interesting, I always thought the asylum was the most survivor sided map. I find it rather easy to lose the killer in the center building, although I’m not a very high rank either.
---
IT'S SO CUTE OMG. I want this right now. Fuck Stranger Things, I need this!
---
BHVR nerfed Legion to the ground with so much strength that too little people should be playing as them now. Things being that way, we don't expect them to get many cosmetics :c

also keep getting a bug where healing just doesn't work

Silly bastard. Followed you on twitch.

I enjoyed the vid of you playing Huntress and going "EVERYONE HAD ADRENALINNNNE".

If you can’t wiggle, recover, point, mend, you have this bug. You need to escape by the hatch, cos you can’t go through gates.

im not able to get borrowed time on PS4? prior to bill coming to ps4 i was able to find borrowed time in the bloodwebs but now that hes in the game do i need to level him to unlock his perks?

I'll make sure to check him out then
---
I would go for Ruin, BBQ, Nurses calling, and monitor and abuse.
---
It always hurts when no one thanks you, but hurts more being told the entity was displeased.
---
 I'll never understand why they gave killers the equivalent of "I'm not mad, just disappointed."
---
Thanks man
---
His terror radius music and chase music are just the default dance music progressively getting more earrapy

Lmao what's with the downvotes
---
Do you have a link?
---
Some day, I hope. It would add so much depth to playing as and against the Pig.
---
Have you been experiencing life backwards? I'd say he was worse back before and during the whole double ban fiasco
---
They literally can't put him in the game unfortunately. There's a lawsuit going on right now which has put the brakes on any new F13 content across the board.
---
I never use a pallet until the killer injures me. There's no point in wasting a pallet when I'm healthy and I am OK playing injured and extend the chase/loop.
---
"I'm pretty new to the game"  "YOU RUN NOED TRASH PLAY ER YOU DONT EVEN NEED IT ON SPIRIT"  dude.. you are the poster child for every shitty person in this community.  Get bent, let the dude play his game.
---
I wrote that as I will chase anyone I see,so I'm not going to let people go if I see someone recently unhooked,I'm here to win like survivors do man.
---
But if someone unhooks in front of me I'll go for the unhooker anyways since it's more beneficial most of the time.
---
Once dedicated servers come, this effect will be reduced in most cases, but it's a matter of where the survivor is graphically and where the hitbox appears during a slow vault.
---
Interesting font choice
---
Hah, had to delete your post? Not surprised.
---
You’re blowing what I said completely out of proportion. If they’re new then that makes sense, hence why they would need perks that are helpful for new players LOL idk why you’re reading so much aggression from what I said, and why you’re responding so aggressively but okay. You’re a fantastic representative of this community if that’s how u talk to people 👍
---
Yeah but sometimes they’re to close to for you to hide from them and then you’re fucked
---
I got it from Tumblr :/

Yeah just wait for the survivor to find you
---
Good perk on Trapper and Hag since it gives them time to setup traps and also herd them into it the area.
---
The Saint of Killers.
---
Any Preacher fans?
---
They messed up the timeline in it though. It basically means either Claire or Leon did absolutely nothing throughout the game because their paths are the same from the start. In the original Claire A and Leon B were the canon timelines and they made sense and took vastly different paths in the game. In the remake it makes no sense because they are both literally doing the same things in their scenarios minus very small things. As a big RE fan I consider this a glaring issue but other than that it was great.
---
Am I a dickhead for not liking new pennywise? I don’t think so
---
It helps with the variety, not all the killers are taking pleasure in what they're doing, some of them are very much prisoners like the survivors just fueled by negative emotion spurned by the entity instead of hope for escape. 
---
I think its just how raw the lore read that really jumped out at me more than anything. I've read a bit of horror novella and aside from The Ruins (painfully detailed and emotional depictions of dying) and not much fiction I've read hit as hard as that snippet; I think because of the really accurate portrayal of a child's mindset in that situation and the fact that you could really easily take "the entity's dark influence" out of the scenario and still have an equally messed up and even more tragic story.
---
well, you havent been downvoted ten times either it would seem
---
Aww shoot only -5, 5 downvotes away before I’m being a dickhead
---
I wish there were some kind of option to not get matched against SWF is so frustrating, (and when I'm survivor all of my teammates are random idiots, and I'm the only one who does gens)

I mean sometimes it's good as well. Today I made friends with a Feng and through her one of her teammates got to survive lol. I was gonna let 2 of em live, but the claudette wasnt getting with the program and started running away from me and tried blinding me. There are good ppl out there too, but goddamn it's annoying when you come across the bad ones.
---
I would love this if they could work out the licensing. Probably my favorite horror movie song of all time. It captures the terror and urgency of being stuck in one of Jigsaws many traps perfectly.
---
First perk is mega op, literally the obsession would have to do absolutely nothing to save their team mates, no healing, no gens, no nothing. And if you run that one gf perk that turns people who save the obsession into the obsession it would be even stronger. The flashlight perk would also be mega op, as say she was a 110% movement speed killer, the first tier would put her at the same level as trapper, second level faster than trapper. Yada yada, say she gets the 21% faster, she’s gonna be 5-1% faster than cloaked wraith (forgot his cloaked speed) so, yeah
---
Then electrocuted a fuck-ton of people
---
Oh god I didn't realize console was like that, that's rough lmao
---
I'm a simple man: I recognize a comment as a Thanos quote and I upvote.
---
I feel like ruin is necessary to, “slow the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT”
---
However I do enjoy bloodhound/mangled butcher as a slightly noob I’d killer at rank 10 but a red ranks survivor. Feel like it helps me not lose a survivor after a bit and get used to how they run away after getting hit.
---
Not a big fan of the others but the Riverdale one sounds sick
---
Killer: Jack "The Ripper"
---
That one was the 1st one i thought of while making this post lol but damn so no zodiac killer for you then? Lol
---
I forgot all about that one lol
---
Or shaun of the dead
---
It just isn't as appealing due to no survivor
---
I think the real life killers they would never think of doing. Especially not the columbine killers. That would be a PR fucking disaster for sure.
---
Downvoted because the meme makes no fucking sense

Tbh lol But you never know they can do characters loosely based on the real life killeea
---
Some kind of hidden reward probably
---
If you want some videos to study, TrU3Tal3nt is a solid survivor who has pretty steady camera movement so it's easy to follow his decision making. He also tries to explain his thought process to teach so it's a good stream to learn from. 
---
Other than that, my best tip is to learn where the safe spots on a loop are (spots that give you good vision of both sides so you know as early as possible if the killer decides to double back). Unless you don't have the distance to set your loop up properly and have to immediately run to the pallet and throw it down, you want to run to the closest safe spot to start your chase. So much of looping properly depends on setting it up correctly so if you want to improve your looping Id examine where on the loop you are running to when you first start the chase. More often than not people go down quickly because they run behind an unsafe wall and fall prey to a Red Glow Mindgame.
---
Yeah well what about the shaun of the dead one? But i always said they need to do the riverdale one
---
Yeah but even remotely like that would be a disaster for them. It would and could absolutely ruin the company in my opinion.
---
Dont be a dick dude. They are just asking a question. People like you acting like this is exactly what this game doesnt need
---
I edited it the survivors would be the core 4
---
I actually never got around to watching that movie
---
I guess I don’t understand ‘respecting the pallet’.
---
Def do its hilarious
---
that's what happens when your host (killer) is from uganda my dude.
---
if you have 200ms Ping, you press a button, like vault, on your screen you are already vaulting the window. On Killer's screen it happens 200ms (0.2s) later. figure out the rest yourself.
---
Just out of interest, what direction did you send them in for tutorials? Asking for a friend..
---
Haha na its just so obvious and i have herd it to many times i love the game dont get me wrong
---
Thanks but I'll check them out
---
I do this all the time. Dont be cocky
---
Yeah I've seen all the saw movies except JIGSAW from 2017, the next one is coming next year called the organ donor.
---
Also, they would never do any real killers as many people would outraged that a real life killer is basically being advertised
---
If I have borrowed time and I'm doing a hook rescue, can I be grabbed?
---
Well to be fair majority of DBD fanbase is primarily Caucasian so there's that.
---
Ah poor carson
---
Definitely, im usually a more composed killer then as a survivor, so ill try and give them a little leeway go after a healthy survivor then injured if ive hooked them twice and theres just scummy people on both ends its frustrating as hell
---
I would ultimately say killer takes more skill. 4 minds against one can be challenging at times. I've been on and off with dbd for a year and just picked it up again and got the pig and legion to lvl 50. 
---
As a killer you've got to know when survivors are baiting and when to go in for the kill. Guessing their next move too. It's all about execution lol and for a killer if their game is off even the slightest the surviors will profit. 
---
Dont really play into the complaints about tunneling. If someone's being a pest/bold..well then I'll exterminate them. 
---
Love running Frank's demise, make your choice, discordance, and spies of the shadow with legion. His fast paced map pressure with add ons... sick
---
If I feel like I need help finding survivors Ill run corrupt. Corrupt forces survivors to move which makes them much easier to find. I really don't think it's potential is to slow games since survivors can still easily rush an active gen down.
---
If I feel like I need to slow the game down in general though nothing beats Ruin. It's a separate defendable objective plus slower gens. Ruin also forces 1-2 survivors to move around but you have a lot less control over when they decide to do it. 
---
So if you play someone like Pig who can slow the game down herself but needs to get that first trap on quick, corrupt will be your best friend. But in most other cases it's really not needed and you'd be better off going with Ruin. And running them both in tandem kind of sucks because survivors will just spend the Corrupt duration looking for your totem, and then you get value out of neither.
---
that's funny but i gotta follow the flair
---
Thinking bout it, but think I'm going tonight for the bloodweb update before going for it.
---
Same, and if I end up downing the unhooked survivor, I usually try to let them get picked up and chase someone else. I was a survivor main before I ever played killer, so I tend to play with that in mind lol
---
Now I just switch between killer and survivor both. Depends on my mood what I choose.
---
It happens when you only own the killer but not the DLC
---
It really comes down to what the survivors are carrying, if I see 2+ Medkits I'll use nurses calling, otherwise I use sloppy to really punish self care. If there's 2+ flashlights I'll use lightborn and if all 4 are carrying items I'll use Franklins.
---
They should make killers POV third person like the survivors for April fools day. Have all killer players unite and say nothing.
---
I play on ps4 and it'll never be as toxic as pc, because ps4 and xbox has no post game chat. All that salt, every match.
---
Looks like we will never know Who OP Is xd
---
Somebody been playing For Honor
---
Wrong era.
---
So the way Sony works is you receive a yearly recap of all the games you played that year and it'll show the hours, but it doesn't stay up for very long. I mentioned earlier that it's probably 2500+ hours, but I have no way of knowing exactly how much till this year's recap
---
This doesn't necessarily confirm PTB *isn't* today, but I would advise not getting your hopes up.
---
NOED does not apply to hatchets
---
I thought dota 2 is salty enough, then I play this game...... but seriously, most players don't trash talk in asia, at least in my experience. Is it common among us/european players?
---
Swap Ace in the Hole for Object of Obsession and put on an instaheal
---
This subreddit is the epitome of this games toxicity, I would've recommend taking advice from here. Try to DBD forums

My thoughts exactly, she would have been amazing as the nerdy goth chick. Just imagine her making her weird ass sandwich with mud flakes and David's liver. Blessed be the Hag.
---
Hey, maybe if I murder a bunch of people in a really disturbing way I can be in a video game!  Well, that definitely won't encourage me at all.
---
I always viewed the Entity as kind of "hiring" the killers so I  don't think it woild stop her if it lessened the hope of the survivors
---
It's a good song and certainly dramatic but that's all it is because it filled in nicely with the tone and pacing of the movies. As others mentioned, it would likely involve more licensing but it also does not have the intensity for a chase song.
---
They would have to up the tempo or otherwise fiddle with it to capture the tone of being hunted down, in my opinion.
---

I've heard that it is \*very\* expensive but i'm not sure if that is true or not.

That's actually a very interesting point, especially if she explains how traps are supposed to work but keeps with the theme that she doesn't care about John's modus operandi

Cant wait for them to nerf the Demogorgon because he is ToO oP
---
Heck yeah. Bond is my go-to perk since the beginning.
---
This is really cool!
---
probably in another week, then the dlc probably 2 weeks after that. 
---
since that is how the devs have done their content/patch cycle recently.
---
How is the last one holding the game hostage? The trapper could have easily just opened the locker and taken the survivor.
---
Mid September or 2 weeks after the PTB update.
---
I literally just mentioned how ruin, Noed, and nurses are not nearly as strong as adrenaline, dead hard, ds, and borrowed time. 4 instant heals, one perk that allows you to avoid what should be a down, another that allows you to unhook and take an extra hit. And after that, the injured guy that got unhooked is able to take another hit because of ds. And don't try to slug. There will always be that one guy running unbreakable who will pick up everyone in five seconds. But a perks that's completely useless after holding m1 for 14 seconds, or another perk useless after 14 seconds of holding m1? Totally overpowered. Get over yourself, survivors have always had the advantage. I'm not saying that it's bad, it's just frustrating sometimes. And the only way you can hope to counter these guys completely is by running A tier and S tier killers with said perks. Even then, you'll need amazing add ons. And don't get me started on items.
---
Something tells me we might have a special terror radius/chase sound for the demogorgon
---
I really don't get why people care so much about rank. Only bothered for the achievement and after that never again.
---
Heck, I'd prefer to stay out of the red ranks just because people get so tryhard and unfun, but still keep sliding up to rank 1 just because of the amount I play.
---
No offense but you come across as 12
---
cause you know little kiddies think over editing and earrape is funny
---
Don't nag them on Twitter all the time, they're people too

No offense but we didn't ask o\_0

that's funny like 1000 hours equates to 1000 hours of flashlight usage
---
rank 15 survivor mains be like ^
---
Jason is a very special case in the sense that F13: The Game came out around the same time as dbd and I doubt that they would want to kill their player base off of F13.
---
We'll see , maybe the Servers are as bad as nintendo online
---
Even if you are good.. the game is so unbalanced
---
No assumption was made. It's a fairer game to go against an opponent who isn't handicapped by only having brown add ons and a single perk by an arbitrary cap to what working hard can gain.
---
He instantly jumped to "THEN WE SHOULD JUST REMOVE THE ENTIRE PROGRESS SYSTEM OF THE GAME."
---
Yes DCing is also a reocurring problem, a pretty big one, you’re right, i believe that if they would just implement a punishment system for dcing then we would at least get less DCs that is caused because someone didn’t know they wouldn’t be able to finnish the game, it wouldn’t help much against toxic dcs but it would be a start imo
---
Yeah but only if it is the last survivor and the hatch isn't closed yet.
---
Yeah so funny.
---
Again, if your flashlight "fails" record it because Ive never seen it happen, not to me or any streamer. Youre probably just missing the right timing or aiming it wrong
---
BLOODEH LEAGONS
---
I mean Hag got eaten alive, that's pretty fucked up too
---
To every claudette I go against yes
---
damn, that's the most rules i've ever seen in a porn sub.
---
I think the issue is that it won’t work with the lore. Don’t forget that pennywise is a being more similar to the Entity and there is no way that it would be forced to stay in his clown form for all eternity. That being said, a losers club paragraph would be alright.

---
Cool
---
I mean theres good reasons why people doubt an IT killer will be made.
---
1. We already have a clown killer, Theres a good chance in theory that they wanted to do a pennywise and probably got turned down.
---
2. What would his power be? Licensed killers need to have powers resembling something they do in their respective media. Pennywise is a cosmic entity much on the level of our entity, it wouldent make sense that he would let himself be taken over.
---
the trailer said sep 16
---
Yeah cause it worked so well with TF2 and the coaching system

I've been saying this for a long time. It ties in with the Skilled Huntress achievement. I mean, you can't get that mad at Iri Head being instadown if you get sniped by it.

The devs have said Legacy will never return and tbh I think it should stay like that. They’re the most rare cosmetics that OG players who prestiged the 4 original survivors back then. It wouldn’t really be fair to them.

Also....MUST be doing something. Fixing gens, cleansing totems, distract killer.....do not add me if you just like to hide and that's it. Interested in getting as many points as possible.

If you would like to have someone to casually play DBD SWF add me on Xbox 1 and shoot me a message that you seen my post here.
---
\^This.
---
Like to us he's in the Entity's Realm for all time (or until the servers shut down) but irl he was in the middle of eating a burger with Pablo mid season-2 and zoned out for a few seconds but remembers everything.
---
It means you stop moving in front of a pallet so that if a survivor throws it down, you don’t get stunned.
---
Something should be done about smurf accounts tbh. A friend of mine just bought the game and occasionally every few matches he will get oxic SWFs with full level 3 perks. The guy still thinks Monstrous Shrine is viable and he has to go up against this?
---
I've been rank 1 plenty of times before they changed the ranking system, and when I still mostly played solo. I don't really care that much about being in high ranks anymore when playing with friends.
---
She aint T H I C C but she got the N E C C
---
*angry pig main noises*
---
Otzdarva is who I'd suggest the most for newer players.
---
The problem is perks like dying light encourage a killer to tunnel the obsession paired with something like remember me and you have a legitimate strat to slow the game down permanently which makes the 3v1 even better for a killer.
---
Streamed last night, there was an Ace that was quite simply sublime with the jukes. He carried the team and in doing so I could only get a 1K with an unfamiliar 1 perk GF. The sad thing is, despite the others being average asf, a Nea teabagged at the exit.
---
I informed them that the Ace carried them and the teabagger was trash. The excuse from the Nea was that: I was blind, they were having a bad game and I was a decent killer.
---
MAKE UP YOUR MIND SALTY SURVIVORS, PLOX.
---
A Hillbilly with NOED. Unless he had the speed limiter add-on, that's pathetic
---
But not letting them bled out on the ground either
---
Same about the Community, I've played for a while, but because I broke My screen, I've mainly been playing in PS4 atm, some guy just randomly attacked Me and said Inwas reported, at one point I told Him He shouldnt attack people like that, He then said He has a right to attack anyone He wants, I reported the message for harrassment, and the PlayStation Ref told Me that by saying that He had violated a part of the Code Of Conduct (08 as far as I can tell)
---
So I understand the shitty Community, luckily --- People on PC aren't AS Bad, atleast They don't tell You to kill Yourself for playing Survivor.
---
Hehehe *Michael* main
---
Holy shit. That sounds like a fun combo.
---
Who runs Iron Maiden other than Nurses and Huntress?
---
I've been looking at ruin too. I'd say spies works 50/50 so it is rubbish. Definitely cant wait til I get nurses calling cause thinking of pig with ruin, nurses calling, make your choice, and either discordance or surveillance seems like a strong/fun build.

There is no chance tho the ptb to go live next Tuesday because it will be on 3rd September and from 5th to 9th September there will be double bloodpoints so the time for the ptb will be too short and no one will test it anymore after the double bloodpoints event goes live. So this week is most likely the ptb to drop

Face the wall, not the fucking open.

It *is* also really messed up what happened to her but every time she jump-scares me I feel a little less invested in her tragic past.

At the end though, the super detailed rotty gore and the fact that she escapes just to die on the floor right there from the stress, oof, huge probs to the writers for this stuff, some of it is so striking for how little there is.

Go ahead and tunnel the deliverance guy and lose the game while u get stunned for 5 secs and have to tunnel him again ;)

Like, if youre straight watching them on hook until they die, you're kind of a dick. But play how you want. Turn off messages if you don't want these messages. Otherwise, you will get them.
---
For Legion you are gonna want perks that slow the game down, my build is 
---
Thanatophobia, Ruin, Thrilling Tremors, and discordance and those plus legion’s power which already slows survivors down by making them waste time it can be very effective and works well with just about any add-ons though my preferred ones are Sketch Book and Iridescent Button
---
I’m new to the game so I don’t know what else to do cause I’m worried they will escape.
---
Yes
---
It’s only active for 40-60 seconds after getting unhooked. Now it’s more of an anti tunnel perk.

I voted for the hookers.

Survivors won't expect you to uncloak instantly when you break a pallet while cloaked, so it does catch them off guard.

Absolutely LOVE his iridescent button. Thank you I will work at unlocking this build for my legion.

Nurse Nea?

This is why I hate fighting Billy.

They did say they were focusing on the health of the game. But I’m just worried that their summer deadline will force them to release it prematurely. I would much rather wait much longer then have terrible dedicated servers.
---
Cool I'm down. You play on steam?

I suggest you alternate between playing survivor and also killer. That'll give you more insights on both sides and also improve your game sense as well. It sucks having your teammates dc, there no denying that.

That would be an equivalent to "DC to give your SWF buddy a hatch" imo, and that's not a good thing.
---
Wow. As if nurse isn't already a treat to play against. This is the reason why people invented 3rd party software to avoid certain players. Some people just shouldn't have anyone to play against.

It's level 1, so a maximum of 50% as each stack gives 25%

---
Forcing the other side to disconnect or stay in the match for absurd amounts of time, such as if there's 1 surv left and the EGC isn't active, the killer could block them in a corner which forces them to stay in the match
---
Ummm, Tru3 won all those matches very convincingly apart from the last one. You really didn't help your case (nor did Tru3) by posting these "amazing godly 4-man SWF sweaty tryhards" failing to complete all the gens even though they did outplay tru3 at some points. 
---
The problem with spirit is that her power regenerates so ridiculously fast that even if a survivor "wins" a mind game, they only buy themselves about an extra 7 seconds or so and then they get slaughtered right after when they need to make another guess. Or they use a vault/pallet to avoid the phase, but it leaves them out of position to loop so spirit can easily just run them down and m1. 
---
These vids just reiterated the fact that she's busted af
---
It would be a more interesting mechanic for an obsession to appear midgame.
---
Exam week for me...
---
When you have a financial meeting with the Entity at 3 PM but you gotta kill a Blendette at 4 PM
---
yesterday i sacrificed just one out of 4 survivors. first thing when the game was over was "get cancer". the other 3 were spamming EZ as if the one saying it the most would finally lose their virginity. subtle difference in survivor emotions, i guess. 
---
i couldnt care less, though. i just imagine they are spoiled 10yo kids and dont take them seriously for a second.
---
When playing killer, if i get annihilated, i always try to applaud them for a good game on their part. Most will be nice if you don't act like a bitch yourself.
---
I get that, Rubberbanding, occasionally i can't wiggle free
---
Only pop the gen when working with others and the killer running at you

Whilst screaming,

Seriously, play for honor, I stopped playing dbd for a time and started playing for honor, for honor if you don't know is a pvp game where you play as a knight/viking/samurai, and basically all the combat mechanic resides on reflexes, so the reflexes I have develop in that game make that I almost never lose then, but it's overall practice, but that is my recommendation
---
Make it $69

I watched like 3 videos, hated his voice, you could tell from his voice that he didn't care about the game at all. I just watched because I wanted more info on the lore of the game without looking it all up myself.

I go for greats when the killer doesn't have ruin so I don't get rusty. If you're on console like me some games will be too laggy to hit greats reliably though.
---
Ace. Fuck perks, I'm loyal to my boy and he's loyal to me.
---
Nea or David, idk.
---
If I read correctly, it's 25 each. But they need to be sacrifices, not moris
---
Yeah, you get jack shit for being facecamped even though you're causing the killer to waste their time
---
I feel so bad for all the new people joining the game. All the baby survivors and killer who won't have a clue as to what they're doing.
---
That first match, the killer disconnected. It counts as a loss for the killer.
---
As for learning how to get better on the game, I recommend watching and reading some guides since the in-game tutorial isn't exactly the most helpful.
---
That's a man.
---
rise up killers. for we shall gain the scoops
---
Nea-killer no more, now Quentin is the Killer  
---
  
---
Nea is the entity
---
Turn V-sync off in your GameUserSettings.ini by pressing Windows key + R, typing "%appdata%" into the bar, and going to Appdata &gt; Local &gt; DeadByDaylight &gt; Saved &gt; WindowsNoEditor &gt; GameUserSettings.ini. Press Ctrl + F and look for a line that starts with "bUseVSync." Set its value to false and save the file.
---
Also, make sure you have good fps and refresh rate. A better refresh rate makes the skill check flow more smoothly.
---
And finally, there's the obvious: practice. Once you get used to hearing the sound cue and recognizing the position of the great skill check, it will become natural to you. 
---
Of course, because this game is poorly optimized, skills checks will stutter no matter how good your computer specs are sometimes. Nothing you can do to reduce those.
---
I think you meant to say  
---
J e s u s
---
It’s fun for us at least
---
Further proof that Nea is the Entity.
---
He clearly likes it!
---
I mean sure but it’s really fun being downed as the last survivor and watching the killer tea bag for 5 minutes while you bleed out and crawl around.
---
I try to alternate, sometimes it just does not work out that way. I mostly play killer, but was playing survivor for a daily. As a killer I would have given the survivor the hatch in this situation which again added to my frustration a bit.
---
Wouldn't deliverance and DS work better? For te 60 seconds you're broken u got DS if killer comes for you.
---
This sub wasn't built for "rationality". Get out! Out I say!
---
ooof my bad. maybe try 'kill your friends' with a friend that has hag with ruin and just practice gens
---
I only adjustment I think Spirit really needs is her having no collision during phase walk and giving her a proper window vault animation.
---
Just give the name already. If boycott is needed, boycott's gonna happen.
---
no
---
ill do that
---
You’ve brought a dream of mine to life!  Reverse Franklin’s Demise...now the killer has to wander around going “Damnit! Where’d I drop that knife?!”
---
i just started playing for the first time in like a year
---
Do NOT name &amp; shame.
---
yet it's sitting at 500 players and even less viewers on twitch
---
Teamming is bannable, give the name as they broke the rules.
---
That a not even how you use this format.
---
Play on a smaller tv. The bigger the tv the harder the skill checks are in general. I have a 60” and I can barely get skillchecks on that and I’ve been playing for 2 years. But when I moved to a smaller tv I hit great skill checks almost every time
---

---
I would absolutely love to help out! I might not be the best at the game but I'd say I know the basics. I would like to help and I absolutely support this.
---
oh boy let's see how fast the Ochido fanboys either start hating on this idea or going with it to bread more toxic players
---
And high rank killers aren't *usually* huntress, as that's taken up more often by nurse, spirits, and hillbillies. I wouldn't personally run it on huntress cause its kinda meh even with the faster reload considered
---
I had a bunch of survivors roll around and do gens real quick, I get to Tier 3 only when the exit gates are powered because I couldn't find them half the game and a Meg tbags and tries to flashlight me at the exit gate, and got tombstoned.
---
Well, camping is nothing reportable and devs cant do anything about so, is it right? No, it ruins the game of the survivior for no reason; is it legit? Apparently yes, so nothing you can really do. Just say whatever and go on to the next game.
---
I can try to put my self in his shoes and he maybe thought you were just hiding and waiting for kate to die without doing anything productive, so he decided to give Kate the hatch. Not a reason to insult you, absolutely, but maybe the situation was different from his point of view.
---
Anyway this surely was toxic and not funny either to play against or to watch, if i watch a streamer i wanna see actual gameplay, not some camp. And I always want to see positivity, i already get enough toxicity when i play.
---
Can i ask you the name? You can tell me in private if you want, i follow pretty much every known dbd streamer and i would like to know who did this.
---
Quentin, his perks are pretty op
---
I'm not into streaming/streamers, but if all happened as you say, that guy, streamer or not, is an asshole. Period.
---
I'm scared.
---
Mods took my post down when it had the name. ): Is it still possible to report to BHVR if its not right after the match?
---
Am I the only one who didn’t know that character was a actual person😔
---
Don' they suck?
---
Yes when you are banned from a discord channel you are IP banned forever. You’d have to create a new acc, log in with different internet (or vpn) and join the discord again still on that internet. Then you can stay on that discord
---
I really like your artstyle! How long have ya been drawing to be that good, my dude/dudette?
---
Uhm well yea they do
---
Ok i guess
---
Maybe don’t support cheating, mod.
---
So what?
---
I play both sides and you’re right. I really don’t get why twitch streamers who main killer still complain about it
---
This is fantastic
---
You can do yes as working with the opposition against other players is bannable, however you’d need video evidence and given it’s a streamer i’m not sure anything would come of it. Can you PM me who it was, i’m just curious as to if it’s one I follow?
---
He's not complaining about it tho.
---
Just do an independent report, witch-hunting is not allowed on the sub.
---
Your best bet is clip it then report it probably add it to streamable just in case it gets deleted (the clip)
---
The killer Disconnected (DC). To get better, watch PainReliver, No0b3, otzavarda, puppers, Demi, and Uylissis on twitch and yt. They will help a lot. And advice from me. Always be doing a Gen or an unhook
---
I need this in my life. **BHVR PLEASE**
---
Not necessarily it’d be cool to have this idea in the game 🤠
---
Yeah but..... orignal killers... that we can buy with shards
---
New players will probably play against baby killers or demogorgons when the new chapter drops, as soon as they start to rank up the fun begins :)
---
Since the game is asymmetrical and I plan to play mainly as survivor, I do need some help knowing what the killer can see or do.  Even if I wanted to play as the different killers to find out myself, I don't own all the things.  I'm gonna look for a good youtube video or something :)
---
I am definitely a tortured baby killer, every time I just can’t wait for the round to be over and go back to survivor
---
When you see a teammate unhook another teammate near the killer, and they both get downed.
---
I'd recommend playing as a killer a few times just to get used to what scratch marks look like
---
Go back to Cuntsville plz
---
A noed gamer once said “Don’t be this guy.”
---
I am new to this game and only play as killer how do you tell and counter that perk?
---
My post submitted early sorry. I was going to say that you should always be doing something beneficial to your team. Never just stand in a corner and hideml
---
Lmao in survivor main who does totems
---
I will go in to kill your friends and have my friend use ruin and sometimes ruin with doctor. It has helped me a lot. I do the same with flashlights since I am terrible. 
---
I play on ps4 and sometimes you just can't get that great skill check for one reason or another. Good luck out there!
---
I suggest using solidarity instead of ace in the hole, maybe botany to boost your self care efficiency. What about unbreakable instead of Deja vu?
---
Leatherface is like hillbilly but all his power is contained in the basement.
---
Bring self Care, saboture, ds in a custom and practice
---
Um, no, original killers/survivors are not "cooler". If they can get a well-known license, they should.
---
I am sure the outfit will be at least 1080 lauric cells. I kinda feel like it will be a little more just because of how much the community wants it.
---
Is this rats? Because I fucking loved that track
---
Completely and utterly wrong
---
O my god the infinite loading screen bug, this is a COMPLETELY NEW bug
---
I am not camping I am playing trap
---
DO YOU THINK THESE TRAPS WILL GET SET UP BY THEMSELVES
---
I think the main problem is having a game design that rewards camping and tunneling quite a lot. People do these things because it is damn effective if you are trying to kill all 4 survivors so sometimes you can’t really blame them. Until the devs start implementing in-game mechanics that punish these sort of playstyles, we can’t really do much about it.
---
Link?
---
If there are no obsession spikes by any player, you know nobody has it. This change is to remove that.
---
What can I do? :'(
---
Yea probably maybe I'm a basic bitch of dbd
---
What was it?
---
happened to me yesterday also luckily I found hatch and got away
---
Yes but original killers and survivors can be brought with shards
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Newbie to DBD: “Oh boy I can’t wait to escape a demogorgan”

---
Thanks for sharing
---
DS wouldn’t be a problem if you don’t tunnel a survivor,adrenaline rewards you for making it to endgame at that point the killers fault,BT stops you from being tunneled unless they unhook in front of you,BNP is practically useless more then one is used,dead hard really? I understand sprintburst but most of the time it doesn’t work or you just get a extra 5 seconds.NOED rewards the killer for playing bad and going to endgame despite the fact they are supposed to kill them before that and just so happened
---
You're right. It's obvious that Billy here is based on leatherface before they even got the rights to him. And I was hurting when I made this meme myself, I love leatherface and seeing him be miles below all the other killers just hurts. Especially if you remember the good ol' movies
---
No one fuckin asked
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
It’s fair after all.
---
You heal a state of health, gain a boost from adrenaline.
---
You get to just basically cancel the fact that you’ve been downed and are about to get hooked with DS. Etc.
---
So why can’t killers have NoEd? Why can’t they have something that lets them oneshot survivors that can do things like DS, BT, dead hard adrenaline etc etc?
---
Tier 1 is 30 
---
Tier 2 is 45
---
Tier 3 is 60

I mean I literally said I let them live but...

People still play that?
---
Honestly, i can beat nurses and spirits most of the time, but hillbilly, he's a pain on the ass and needs to be nerfed
---
Amen brother, amen
---
Another survivor who just keeps asking for more unnecessary OP buffs ROFL
---
Might not be intended but the gif kinda insinuates that the killer is the dick for running noed.
---
Which I mean...yay, another noed shaming post.
---
If the entity is stronger, and it is if bhvr wants it to, it take pennywise.
---
The devs also love fucking with us, now I think of it it's probs today. Usually they get released on tuesday US if I remember correctly
---
EEEEHHHHHH
---
That is pretty stupid. The killer would have to let them heal to avoid decisive strike which is like decisive strike anyways. This just makes the perk an infinite decisive strike.
---
If the killer leaves all survivor escape while the killer loses a pip
---
Funky fresh Jake just enjoying the show
---
That's a tough one, I work terribly when I know there's expectations and I know that my work is not flawless (I'm not completely happy with the Nurse's outstretched hand here for example) and I would hate to have my art on someone's body when it's not perfect, *but* if you give me a general idea of what you would like, I could always try and give it a shot
---
That would be so scary man
---
Mistakes were made. All that matters is I cheered myself up.
---
"Ope. Try me bitch!"
---
See I always thought billy reminded me more of the deformed hillbillies from the hills have eyes.
---
1 word: SLUGGING. Just leave them on the ground if you encounter and down them. Someone will have to pick them up and that gives you pressure
---
I hope you weren't the survivor that I think was a Jane because I am very embarrassed
---
No collision? Make her get no collision against walls too like nurse. Thatll make her more fun. Ill pay that price of survivor collision in phasewalk with enjoyment for that.
---
And that’s also pretty stupid because good survivors won’t heal anyways
---
This whole subreddit is killer mains circlejerk. Killers cry about everything but if you tell them that for example mori is OP they say "Im killer Im supposed to kill you" but survivor is not supposed to survive.
---
What’s your twitch?
---
I like it, and it's better than most memes these days.
---
I think we can wait buddy they probably got a lot going on
---
Loading up Dead By Daylight, being on the map when a survivor is unhooked, hitting m1, doing anything to stop gens from getting finished, covers about most survivor mains I'd say.
---
&lt;3
---
If it’s any relief, anything would be going through my tattoo artist (a close friend) and girlfriend (my usual sketch artist) so it’d probably be modified a bit anyway. I just really love the pseudo cell-shaded style (reminds me of wind waker a bit)
---
True also sorry you needed to be cheered up. This will give you a giggle, I found out tonight that legion can vault pallets and I nearly pooped my pants
---
Proof the DBD community is filled with gay men, who like me love to be chased by big strong men with long hard weapons.
---
susie and julie seriously need more outfits
---
Tbh I enjoy facing both Billy and the doc now that I’ve got a bit more experience as a surv.
---
She about to receive that hotdog.
---
Survivor DCs more because:  
---
1. There are 4 survs  
---
2. If you are a killer main you just cant see other killers DC  
---
3. As a 50/50 player I thinks surv have more "reasons" to DC
---
Its weird how everything in this subreddit is about how killers play. Havent seen anyone do a post about how bad survivors for a while?
---
Why is that
---
Weren’t Amanda’s leather Pig cosmetics alight more then 1080 ? I expect the same for Steve.
---
That would be a relief haha

Nurse is one of the good Moris out of the early killers, wraith and trapper are pretty boring
---
I dont see the appeal of it especially as I think it affects the frames
---
What if we don't want to farm though?
---
Dance with me is solid when paired with other perks and Windows of opportunity can be useful when your trying to learn maps but that’s about it.
---
I cant remember the last time I saw a trapper mori someone... doesnt he just hit you like wraith?
---
I'm kinda the same except I only play killer I'm decent with most killers but once I start using legion which I enjoy a lot I pretty much always at least get a 3k
---
Yea pretty much
---
If one person has it then one or more people have  ds
---
The trailer for pennywise will be lit, i think they will definitly include him sometime. Would be weird of them if they didnt.
---
His trailer would probably be the camera moving around a corner of the sewer and as you move to the end of the corner the music gets even more intense and then you see his red ballons floating up with a real intense music and he isnt behind them, you only see his head dissapearing slowly behind another corner in the background.
---
They say that patience is a virtue.
---
Dance With Me is solid on its own, great in combination with Quick and Quiet and Lithe, or Head On.
---
I enjoy Ash's Flip Flop perk, works well with Tenacity and Unbreakabill, and Kate's Boil Over, along with a sabo toolbox, you can make it basically impossible to hook you, then they try to slug you so you Unbreakabill, so they slug you again, and the next time they pick you up you have a tiny wiggle bar to fill.
---
Neither build is meta at all, but they're fun and effective in other ways to just second-chancing 25 hits.
---
Mettle of Man, Buckle Up and Windows of Opportunity are pretty ass.
---
Exactly
---
That's Reddit for ya.
---
just look at the wall to the right or left, if there isn't one pray
---
Also known as the floating tampon.
---
You could always do pig like skill checks and you have to hit three of them or something
---
It's honestly frustrating when you just want to move on to next game and the killer is hitting the hook going "LET'S FARM LITTLE BUDDIES" and the other idiots are just nodding their head going hell yeah we'll farm. Just. Fucking kill me. So I can play my next match. Please. I launched this video game to play video game.

Legion's Feral Frenzy takes care of most tracking issues, and people often won't heal against Legion because Feral Frenzy cannot down them.
---
Your targets should be groups of survivors, so that you can hit them all with Feral Frenzy, so Discordance will help with that. Try not to upgrade it past the basic version though - the longer the warning lasts, the greater the chance that you'll only notice it long after the survivors have ran off.
---
Save the Best for Last is amazing on Legion because Feral Frenzy allows you to build stacks very quickly - Stab (1), enter Frenzy, stab again (2), stab any other survivors (2+), stab someone a second time (3+), get kicked out of Frenzy, down a survivor (4+) and hook them.
---
Legion's mobility pairs well with Pop Goes the Weasel, since you can Feral Frenzy from the hook and find the generator you want to regress the most.
---
Last perk can be flex - Ruin is the most obvious, especially if survivors are keeping far apart, although Make Your Choice can be very powerful due to Legion's speed.
---
Build those Save the Best for Last stacks, hook someone, Frenzy away, Frenzy back after the unhook and then down both survivors at almost the same time.
---
My loadout I use on nurse is nurses, discordance, bbq and chilli, and thrilling tremors. Dunno if its meta but it works for me
---

Can’t do bones if you’re running the killer for all 5 gens :/
---
Youre hired
---
I think it's kind of a training wheels perk.
---
Thank you!
---
most perks aren't worth running if you want to win tbh
---
Ooo you're making me blush
---
*Puts on nurse with 5 blinks*
---
I usually tunnel the one guy who's object of obsession, wants my attention, runs after me with his flashlight and once I kill him, he cries at the end and I just tell him ' thought you wanted my attention"
---
And I love to tunnel the guy who get saved with borrow time and then runs after me to get the hit and 15 secs later I hit him down.. once I get him down he cries and calls me tunneler.. I mean, what? You're the one chasing me and trying to block a full HP unhooker.
---
Everyone in this thread gets 32k every game i suppose.
---
399$ the only price
---
There has already been an influx of new killers in my games. Played against a brand new Nurse last night. First game ever. Poor guy couldn’t even get a single hook.
---
Maybe your anti virus is fucking things up
---
I love to hit the unhooked guy down so they just lose the points with the unsafe unhook. Even if I dont hook that guy again.
---
Whenever i hear the fat as fuck footsteps
---
You're right. No point going for someone who have showed that he's good at looping. If I have 1 bad vs 1 good looper on the same gen, obviously I rather go for a 15 secs chase than a 1 / 2 min chase. And ofc , it's late game and I need 1 survivor dead as soon as possible, I'm going for the one who's dead on hook also. It doesn't matter if he got unhooked 2 min ago. That's the game
---
Theres a metric tonne of shit incoming in this patch, and over the next little while aswell. I think we can be understanding if they needed a bit of extra time.

---
This is why I don’t play killer all the time. Also, nice edit.
---

---
Billy is leatherface but with fast travel
---
I want this framed
---
it's just that if the killer is using multiple tracking perks, the perk doesn't really do much. 3 tokens is not enough to warrant use through even half the match if it goes off so much, hell just think about pairing it with Babysitter and going against a killer with BBQ, congrats you used 2/3 uses on 1 hook.
---
Not to mention that most other tracking perks, even other popular ones, either have a different reveal mechanic, such as killer instinct or that location reveal thing tied with Madness, Iron Maiden, and Rancor. Or it signals the aura of the gen, meaning Distortion will have no affect.

Today a wraith was slowly tunnelling and camping through each of our team. When I got downed 5 seconds after unhook I was getting so confident about my DS that I just missed it.
---
I honestly wonder what region you play in, half the people I get always have snarky ass comments at the end of games before I say anything, win or lose.
---
Not counterproductive, you have noob3 who have played at rank 1 and even high rank killers, lose a lot of time with him. Now imagine killing 1/2 weak survivors at the begining, he can loop you for ages but he's not winning the game also.
---
He made a video where a pig chased him for 20 min and he lost anyways, cuz guess why,2 survivors were dead already.
---
Can we talk for a moment about how Spirit has the only interesting hatch close animation.
---
Mori, Devour Hope, Rancor, Tombstone Myers.
---
Basically, instead of sacrificing them via the hook, you have to kill them.  Any method of killing will work, in case I missed one.
---

huh wierd, it works fine on my pc but apparently not on my phone

Haha and make survivors first person, that would be terrible, staring at a gen for 80 seconds
---
Devs are currently bringing in some consultants for a few days, so I doubt we'll see anything while they work with those people.
---
Steve ‘the hair’ Harrington is way sexier than Nancy ‘the slut’ wheeler and no one can change my mind
---
I saw someone say if you can't emote during the game it normally means you're affected by this, I've never had it so I don't know how true it is, but I guess it's worth a shot to check that so you can save yourself the disappointment.
---
Yes.
---
No one has put enough time to correctly answer that. I would argue the M1 Special is good enough on him (BBQ Ruin Enduring Spirit Fury) and his ability allows lethality in chases too. However because of how fast you an get downs you can make PGTW, Thrilling Tremors or any other slowdown perk work.
---
Rank 8 with survivor getting into killer but very new. Steam is norcalfox21 and I have discoed and mic if needed. Looking for friends to play. Sometimes have 1-2 people with me but down for whatever.

 Bottom of the food chain when it comes to killers, eh?

*cries in Ghost Face*
---
Don't forget Sole Survivor /s
---
Tunneling and slug are needed. Games last for what?  Between 5 to 15 min max. Tell me where it's possible hook 4 guys, 3 times each in 15 min. It's almost 1 hook per minute. Unless you have a lot of pressure via slug, you won't be able to do it. And by telling 15 min, I'm pushing a little bit cuz normally it's around 10 min games. 12 hook in 10 min.. 
---
Even nurse and spirit players need to slug. Unless they are facing full team of potatoes who urban evasion all game and hide after 0.1 sec after hearing heartbeat
---
Any moris, perk or offering or add ons.
---
Also, kills with Pig's reverse bear traps.
---
Upvoted for chucking survivors at other survivors
---
The only change I would make is to make it so when you hook someone else about 20 seconds is removed from the timer.
---
You got hate mail because you were using add ons?
---
They should just make it resist 1 hit downs to become injured instead, maybe becoming charged by being hooked twice.
---
That way between your 2nd and 3rd hook you gain resistance to being an easy down, and protection in the end game from noed for a hit.
---
It'd make it strong, but only in response to common killer effects which make the game much harder for survivors.
---
So you can’t jack off while the killer is chasing you?     
---
*Pathetic*
---
You better hide your fingers
---
3 gen strat, even accidental, can be blamed on survivors lack of spreading out over the map to do gens
---
In 13 game chats out of 40 games i was called being "sweaty" "tryharding" etc
---
I am currently in rank 1 so its mainly red/purple ranks with occasional green
---
Man, is facecamping really that common? I'm a killer main so obviously don't see it happen often, even when I'm playing survivor with buds or something. I mean I've been facecamped by Insidious Bubbas before, but I always figured those cases were few and far between.
---
Why they gotta make us Killer mains look bad?
---
Quick! yeet her while she is still shocked
---
My main concern now is what the hell is burger king myers
---
Or maybe YOU should stop responding to the messeges they send you. I main killer so I know how it feels to get talkshited. Just show them you're better and more grown up than them by just not responding.

I've definitely seen worse.

That's true :( we'll have to start a dbd matchmaking service for people who want practice games
---
Getting facecamped is tough, but going for a rescue in that situation is a waste. Also, you can make text posts.
---
Because everyone is wrong
---
Keep the grind up, friend. We believe in you.
---
***CLONK-CLONK-CLONK-CLONK***
---
Yeah it was just an unfortunate situation. I didn’t make a text post because the point of the post was to say that I have found a way to cope with wanting to uninstall haha, didn’t think people would actually read them.
---
im so proud of this community
---
Wait, they changed it? When Did that change? Because I tried leaving and I was blocked, losing precious time and distance from a box so I died. 
---
And it wasn't Blood Warden lol
---
Ghost Face actually has potential with his power during chases and for getting the jump on survivors.
---
Leatherface at best is an M1 killer which everyone is capable of, and against good survivors never gets to use his chainsaw without massive penalty. He is for sure at the bottom, one could argue he is THE worst killer, but at the very least he's near there.
---
Please don’t do the bottle jig on my fingerless body!
---
Awww I wanted him walking around stabbing people with the spatula with the kings mask on.
---
There are some misunderstandings all around here. For one, the base max BP for either side is 32k, meaning, getting more than that, on either side, comes from various modifiers. The primary problem has very little to do with BP gain, and more that BBQ is easier to stack than WGLF. Which is one of the main things that needs to be changed. As for your second suggestion, absolutely not. It makes keys feel even worse to deal with and killer. Plus, any killer main has had those games where youve hooked every survivor twice, its down to the wire, but they all do manage to escape. You are saying that we should get like 8-10k for a game like that?
---
F13 is actually a really hilarious/meme-y game compared to DbD.  Generally speaking, the survivors are MUCH weaker than they are in DbD (Jason can pretty much one-shot anyone if he does the right thing), but the survivors are much faster than Jason and Jason has to build up his powers over time.  F13 does the "stealth" aspect a lot better too--you will often want to hide because, well, if he grabs you, you're pretty much fucked.
---
DbD, on the other hand, has a much more "polished" gameplay, but it is also somewhat samey.  As a Survivor, you're pretty much stuck playing M1 simulator, and while the various Killers are all FAR more different than the various Jasons, there isn't a TON of difference between any two Michaels, really (okay, I tell a lie).
---
Where F13 shines is when someone with a sense of humor decides to turn it into a meme game.  The game has voice chat for all players incorporated, and often you will find the player randomly selected to play Jason voice-acting Barney or Kermit or a little girl and it is hilarious.  But the game is full of bugs and some bad luck can mean you spend more time sitting out than actually playing the game.  Plus, you know, the whole lack of content and such due to licensing bullshit.
---
Which is sad.  Jason is my favorite horror slasher, and I would like to see him in a "better" game.  But oh well.
---
I would love that haha.
---
How could anyone hate Wraith? At least tell me, you hate him gameplay or lore wise?
---
Wha-
---
It seems like it has been happening more than usual lately, but it’s usually pretty rare because all it does is hurt the killer. 
---
I think it’s probably a reaction to getting looped for 4 gens, but the best way to avoid that is to not have tunnel vision.
---
I just watched a video of the Friday The 13th game and GOD DAMN does it look boring as hell!
---
Strategies like that work suprising often.  Ik usually it ends with a survivor dieing but most often the rest escaping. It only ends with a 4k if survivors attempt to rescue them wasting their own time when they could be doing gens
---
I was scared of this as a kid xD
---
I don’t understand people who want leatherface to be buffed, I kill everyone almost every game with him
---
You must be fun at parties
---
He trusted you u wont tell anyone, now look what you did
---
Just gimme good DbD novels. And when the game comes to an end, the final one will just be called Endgame Collapse and describes how the survivors and killers unite to stick the Entity on a really, *really* big hook and skip out the exit gates, giggling like morons.
---
Bubba won't know what the fuck, but he'd have dudes high-fiving him, so he wouldn't care. Everyone that died prior to entry would be resurrected. At the meetup a few weeks later, Rin would have a couple prosthetics, Bubba would just be wearing a mask Evan made for him, Adiris would be speaking very broken, very cute English, and Meg would haul ass out the gate when someone asks who's paying the check.
---
Max would teach Bubba how to use his damn chainsaw better and they'd open a logging business together. All the girls would just be sighing, trying to get Lisa to wear a god damn bra. The non-Frank members of Legion would haul off and beat his ass up and turn him and themselves in. Freddy would go back to being a powerless, bad-reboot slug somewhere. Jeff and Danny would go on to make a confection shop together that specializes in ladyfingers. Just... y'know. Get there early before Jeff sucks on them all.
---
It’s not noed shaming post
---
Bring Ghost Face. He comes bearing points and can crouch faster.
---
This Medkit used, year!
---
Imagine standing at the exit gate for no reason like this and getting met with full comeuppance like...just walk out, 4head. Well played, OP.
---
They always copy old killers when they do licensed boys. Minus Myers and Pig
---
using a perk like its intendet isnt toxic, except maybe Insidious, but thats badly designed anyways.
---
I really dont get why People get mad at DS, its only a few seconds and unless the Survivor is way better than the Killer, he wont get far
---
Then you should be more focused on talking about changes to WGLF. While there are other very minor issues, particularly how hard it is to score points in the survival catagory, usually resulting in an escape only getting the 5k. The main discrepancy between the two right now is BBQ usually gets 4 stacked simply by doing objectives. WGLF should also get tokens through total gen progress.
---
S U M M O N
---
T H E
---
Yeah, but adrenaline only heals one health state. And what's the chance that all 4 people are running the perk? It's a low chance. But if a killer runs NOED, it affects everyone, until the totem is done, which could possibly mean the whole endgame. And no one even does totems nowadays because there just isn't time. Wither way. Say 2 people are using adrenaline and get to end game. They heal 2 health states. But if you manage to snowball them and hit each survivor say, twice after them getting unhooked or picked up off of the ground or whatever, that 8 health states that you just got off of a perk.
---
&gt;It's fair after all
---
It's fair after all my ass.
---
Spirit is actually balanced fine, until you use prayer breads. It's like the head add on for huntress, broken
---
tunneling and camping through EACH of our team... read it again but slowly
---
P T B
---
Lol what devotion are you
---
Sure, give them tokens for gen progress, or totems, or healing and let them see auras. I'm down for all of that. But I still believe killer, according to lore, should start high and get punished. Ergo camping fixes.
---
I never said that.
---
&gt; Compared to other high tier killers; Billy, Hag, Huntress, Freddy, who's powers have sort of more of a push and pull where both players input matters, Spirit's power is heavily weighed into her input.
---
Maybe don't attack people either, yeah?
---
What if they are the last survivor alive?
---
im gay
---
See I dont use those characters tho hahaha
---
That is an objectively bad idea in every way, and I'm not discussing that point.

Reported, blur out the names of survivors
---
Shaming is against the rules
---
We know
---
Yeah if the killer is within 32m its camping sure
---
 Id change it to 18m tbh
---
 Fully agree that generators should reward more BP.
---
Haven't played much since rank reset and yesterday had so many game where i did 3 gens while the ither 3 survivors threw themselves at the killer (trading hooks and slugs). Once i finished the 3rd gen all 3 of them were dead, the killer closed the hatch and i died on my first hook.
---
Of course i got the lowest BP, the 3 people got between double and tripple from what i got for this questionable playstyle.
---
thanks for the info!
---
Why do you need to make it prominent?
---
Your welcome glad I could hel0
---
Also if you are under the impression that people camp to farm points... you are very mistaken. Camping is already incredibly non rewarding from a points perspective.
---
"A Strange Killer" would be more apt, no?
---
Read the rules, dude. You cannot show player names other than your own. Sorry but I gotta report.

As a player who plays both Survivor and Killer, even though I agree that survivors are a little over the top and they have the advantage to win the game (Unless the killer is playing Nurse, Spirit or Billy), I feel like DS is a perfectly fine perk... As a survivor who gets tunneled a lot because of the shiny outfit I run, I love that I don't just die instantly because of a salty killer player doesn't like my playstyle or my outfit or whatever, and as a killer, I usually get DSd once in every \~10 games, because I never stay near the hook, nor do I want to ruin that persons entire game by just tunneling them down.
---
Although I agree that it could be changed slightly, for example they could make it so that as soon as the killer hooks another survivor while DS is active for another, their DS deactivates, because it technically isn't tunneling if another person got hooked and the Killer spots the recently unhooked survivor first...
---
Or another change was suggested by the streamer Hexy which I also can agree with, that DS deactivates as soon as you touch a generator, because at the end of the day, it isn't fair that you can work on the objective for free, and you don't even have to worry about getting hooked because you have DS.
---
I probably butchered every single one of my sentences because I just woke up, excuse me.
---
&gt; ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ
---
It doesn't nattee if an ability is similar to another. Does it play the same way? No. Does he have a different playstyle? Yes. Going by your logic, Billy and LF are copies, Hag and Trapper are copies, GF and Myers are copies.
---
Doctor? Scary? Now Hag is definitely S-Tier
---
Myers is only S tier if he has scratched mirror, also hag should be A or S aswell.
---
Nancy is hot
---
Legion comes with Discordance, and it suits them well - Legion likes survivors being near each other because it means you get more done during Feral Frenzy.
---
Barbecue and Chilli is good for Bloodpoints, tracking kind of overlaps with Discordance but Feral Frenzy can at least help you close the distance if you see someone's outline.
---
Legion has absolutely no problem keeping people injured, so you just need to find a combo that makes it easier to close the game out. Sloppy Butcher makes it a little harder for them to heal up, they might just choose to stasy injured instead. After that, you eed some kind of bait to put them in a situation where you can down multiple people outside of Feral Frenzy. I'd suggest using Iron Grasp (or preferably Agitation) to put a survivor in a favourable area, or the basement, and then just wait for the injured survivors to come in. If they're not injured, Feral Frenzy them and then see who else appears during the free tracking. If you don't see anyone, or if they're already injured, then just hit them normally outside of Feral Frenzy and resecure the hook.
---
I'm not sure I'd go with Legion as a beginner - if your friend is having problems with tracking then Hag, Hillbilly, or Nurse would all have been "easier" choices. Hag's traps do the work for you, Hillbilly and Nurse have very high mobility and just need Whispers in order to cut down on the patrolling.
---
I screeched reading this😌
---
Unpopular opinion: Nancy over Steve
---
I'm going to have to tunnel you now....
---
How does one acquire such power? (No but really how do you do that? I’m also on Xbox)
---
I love that idea. Probably the best one ive seen yet, i would honestly main that killer if she would get added.
---
A teenage girl, whose parents were tragically killed, but she survived. She stood up to the killer 
---
Now that's an intereting story we have never seen before
---
It all really depends on who the killer was, or what your actions were, despite the survivors smaller nature, they're pretty fucking loud so you have to make sure you don't accidentally aggro anything by just jumping through windows.
---
All of these things I'm about to list give a notification to the killer of where it happened ( at least I'm pretty sure most of these do ) 
---
* Blowing up a gen ( Failing a skill check ) 
---
* Slapping someone ( failing a skill check ) 
---
* Sabotaging hooks
---
* Fast vaulting a window ( jumping through a window while sprinting ) 
---
* Cleansing a totem
---
* Throwing down a pallet ( I think ) 
---
* Screaming ( doctor ) 
---
These are generally things you want to avoid doing ( except for totems as explained later ), but no matter what sometimes it will happen
---
Now here are some things the various killers can do to gain vision ( based off of their base mechanics ) 
---
* Make you scream ( doctor ) 
---
* Walk over a trap ( hag/trapper )
---
* Follow your scratch marks ( when you sprint you leave behind scratch marks the killer can track down ) 
---
* Follow your blood ( When you're injured you bleed, some killer perks increase the frequency, some surv perks nullify this ) 
---
* Listen for your breathing
---
It's hard to really tell ALL of the different ways a killer can find you, but some of the more consistent ways a killer can find you are through some higher tier perks, or at least the more common ones that I run into ( you may not have to worry about these for a while, except for one which I'll mention ) 
---
* Discordance ( Legion perk ) - Highlights a generator yellow for 8-16 seconds ( I think ) when more than one person is working on a gen
---
* ***BBQ and Chili*** \- Whenever a killer hooks a survivor they can your **aura** for 4 seconds ( Leatherface, but this perk was dropped recently in the ***Shrine of Secrets*** so you might be seeing it more often ) 
---
* Infections fright - Whenever you down a survivor makes nearby survivors scream in terror ( Spirit ) 
---
* I'm all ears - When you do a rushed action nearby the killer can see your aura for about 8 seconds ( Ghost Face ) 
---
The best way to find the info you need is hovering over the perks they were using in the post-game lobby, it will tell you what every perk does, and what killer has it
---
That's sounds great, thank you very much.
---
It wouldn't be THAT hard to incorporate him, lore-wise. Example:
---
The extradimensional evil known to the residents of Derry as Pennywise was furious at being beaten for the second time by the only victims to ever escape him. The first time they bested him as mere children, banishing him from their realm. In the emptiness he waited, hungry and seething, plotting his return to take their wretched mortal lives. Upon his second return they managed to do the same thing again, and Pennywise was filled with an uncontrollable rage that had no outlet.
---
As he wandered the empty void he smelt the scent of fear and followed it like a starving animal only to find the Entity, a being that had created it's own realm to feed itself. Ravenous and filled with fury, Pennywise used his power to reach into this pocket realm and manifest himself. His aim was simple - feed on the fear of those here and devise new and cruel ways to terrorize and petrify. Eventually he would return to Derry, and show them all of the fun new ways to dismember and eviscerate he had worked so hard on.
---
After all, no one in Derry ever really dies...
---
Dbd doesn’t have the rights to anything from scream, they have the rights to the ghost face mask and nothing else
---
"Parents were tragically killed"
---
Yeaaah, you must not have been paying attention to the film.
---
Clown is way too high, he is not scary at all.
---
Speaking as a guy with 1400 hours, in my opinion GF is #1. Myers doesn't really jump scare as much as him. Hag has to be top 3.
---
Sounds fun, thanks mate.

Terror radius is not suppressed while cloaked, gain more bp for surprise hits

Actually a very fun build to play. Keeps em guessing.
---
Plays nurse.
---
Survivors DC. 
---
Surprisedpikachumeme.jpg
---
If you don't play in good faith why should they?
---
Why can't i?
---
Well ofc you're gonna 4k consistently since you are using some very fucking good addons.
---
You don't need stridor on nurse by any circumstances, nor franklins, nor ruin, nor those fking addons. What's the point of using franklins when all the items are so easily countered, especially by the best killer in the game, same with ruin, you have acces to so much pressure that you can play full track perk build and dominate the pubs.
---
Lol rank 1 is your evidence? You know Tru3 isn’t even in the same league as someone like Zubat, right?
---
I wish it was possible to turn off bloodlust so you can simply practice Shack looping or T Wall
---
Of all killers, why hate wraith?
---
This happened back in the day when people were using the two killer exploit, where one of the 4 swf was a killer + the killer who originally created the lobby.
---
Probably you messed up clicking something before opening the lobby and this bug happened.
---
Did the 4th survivor join your lobby?
---
It was a sarcastic statements clearly to blow the thing up, her mother was killed, happy?
---
Compared to how much of a baddass characters like Ripley, or Bill from it fighting actual unnatural entities
---
But yeah, lets add a white female teenager to the game
---
Sounds like a true Bubba King 😚
---
It's not intense enough for dbd I think.
---
Bodyblocking me into a corner usually does it
---
Because i want to? That's exactly the mindset of the survivors i was playing against - flaming me for just playing the game for no reason other then
---
Well i dont like IT so lets flame him
---
I mean, they are adding a white female teenager to the game in the next chapter. And a white male teenager too.
---
Considering Sydney Prescott managed to spend a great deal of her life being tormented by sickos with awful Freudian excuses, and managed to overcome them with determination and quick wit every time, I'd say she comes under "badass"
---
May I correct you: 1100 hours on PS3.
---
Who cares? Some of these people deserve to be called out for their behaviour. 
---
You can tell on them all you like. You're not making the community better by hiding this stuff. Quite the opposite, in fact.
---
Not really? They only have a similar build and a machete in common.  The backstory isn't that similar between Evan and Jason. 
---
Jason's rarely used traps to catch prey. Only using them once to my knowledge in the reboot/remake.  The game that came out after DbD is the most Jason's used traps in his iconic pre-reboot looks.
---
Trapper's more just a generic 80's slasher guy. He's got a similar to build to a lot of them. And if anything his whole mining background seems pretty inspired by My Bloody Valentine.
---
Franklin is apparently now a crutch perk
---
Thank you based survivor main
---
You are too biased too miss the point that over 50 percent of people DC in games and that's so toxic
---
But yeah lets complain about a perk that barely does anything when you dont have an item
---
I would feel annoyed for wasting a game, if I was one of the guys who you let go
---
I love your idea i thinknit should be on       
---

Congratulations, and I’m sure there is someone out here who could 4 man with pre-rework Freddy. Big whoop

When he walks on wet ground it’s the worst. 
---
*SLAP-SLAP-SHLOP-SLAP*
---
I care, 
---
When i Play killer i have tons of people wishing me literal death but i dont go full witchhunt because its just not good for the community
---
This happened to me yesterday when a Bubba tunnelled me for all five generators and then downed me with noed. I don't mind chases but its just annoying when you don't get to do gens/totems or anything and then get downed just to get camped on the hook.
---
A new Subreddit you're trying to launch?
---
I look at this and i can actually hear her being stunned and going "hh...awwww"
---
Large parts of the community seem to be American or close
---
Seeing how mayers is capable od surviving injuries he is more of a pure evil form of entity, not human - he fits perfectly
---
See, you're taking it as a witchhunt, but OP hasn't implied anything of the sort.
---
Your premise is false.
---
He's pointing out behaviour we should continue to point out, which helps the community.
---
They aren't even on the same level wtf?
---
The game is pretty active on all platforms. Weeknights tens to be the slowest in my area (Central America) but weekends and fridays are fast lobbies. I believe a while back one of the devs had a solid 5 year plan in mind for the game so we have a lot of content to expect and lots of longevity.
---
If I ever would include speech clouds, she'd be making that sound along with a wheeze
---
Oh yeah I expected that, I think that's true for most games tbh
---
Why Billy? He's the most honest dbd killer: very fun to play against, very fun to play with, if the player isn't good he's a m1 killer, if the player is good and equips engravings is almost unloopable. Best killer concept ever. I am not even a Billy main to compliment him so much.
---
Every name , steam address or anything that can be used against someone showing bad behaviour is in its core a type of witchhunting
---
If he wanted to show the behaviour only he wouldnt need to show the names - Simple as that
---
Put your agendas aside
---
This is good advice, though personally I'll take the t1 if it means the entity will eat more nodes.
---
I have a few versions of that one. Most of them are just “a person pointing” and when I use one, I use a random one.
---
Also, this girl is 17, so she is old enough to have “sexual thoughts about stuff”
---
Wait you can? How?
---
In low ranks on ps4 there's a lot of wraiths who just stand next to the hook while cloaked, rank reset lets me revisit these joyful moments I had when I first started playing.
---
It might be 4% but they have 3 chances at it
---
Guess you haven't heard you need 73
---
Awesome news! Thanks for the quick reply
---
*Summoning noises*
---
It will be 7
---
Man If i find you with my premade at red ranks I'll teabag and flashlight click the shit out of you because you use noed on spirit.
---
Hag jumpscares with her trap indeed, and yes, its TERRIFYING when that happens, but if you just keep your cool 1 second you'll figure out the traps are pretty inoffensive depending on the situation. (hag already in pursuit or you crouch-living for ex.)
---
That’s so nasty haha nice job. It’s so hard to play that dude with mouse and keyboard
---
It looks like it but it isn't, it happened to me too.
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Killer:Just wanted a friend :(
---
I only told you that using the strongest shit on nurse while obviously, by the perks you think are good, being a beginner, will wrongfully teach you how to play nurse. Never said that "everything you do with her is apparently toxic". I never used strong addons on billy and now I've got no problem versing high hours swf, without any game slowdown perks, I told you, such things will affect in the long run. And interesting of you to assume that I'm too insecure to play against a well equipped nurse when I've got more hours in survivor alone than people have gotten in the game.
---
No, it really isn't. I'm not pushing any kind of agenda here. Simply stating a fact that having an unedited screenshot of someone is not starting a witch-hunt.
---
Otherwise...reddit would be anonymous like 4chan, wouldn't it? Having a username does neither encourage nor discourage a witch-hunt.
---
Your premise is flawed.
---
Summon Dedicated Servers
---
oops
---
sry didn t erad the rules, ill take it off and put it back blurred thank you for warning \^\^

---
It's incredible how intelligent comments get downvoted. Rank 20s cove.
---
Steve mains? As in maining a character not yet playable? Please tell me of this pro gamer move?
---
Sounds toxic but it is hard to actually nail this build
---
after 10 hours you pretty much know how to play as effective as anyone. All that changes is how good you juke or run around a pallet.
---
no thats the hillbilly with two speed addons
---
I did, with videos. You're the one saying he isn't and that there are better. it's up to you to provide evidence of that.
---
That's good for you, you are amaizing and the best
---
Now let me play my own game without flaming others, that is none of your concern how i play the game
---
Seeing how you totally missed the point about survivors dc'ing is just telling me how biased you are
---
No, Franklins isnt crutch. Its a just bad, toxic perk. It doesnt help you win, its just to spite survivors for having the audicity to bring an item into the game. Wheres the survivor perk to counter killer add ons? 
---
Nurse is a crutch. Play a real killer. Or just "Play the way you want." But that includesdes survivors doing the same thing, which in this case is not dignifing boosted players by playing against their broken killers.
---
How long does it take BHVR to look at report tickets? I submitted one 12 days ago with video evidence of the incident and all I've gotten is one email saying "we'll look into it as soon as we can" [paraphrasing].
---
Oh I'm aware that it's considered a toxic build lol
---
But in order for it to work you have to actually manage to avoid getting downed quick so I don't think its something that can be abused by newer players
---
Mettle of man
---
don't you dare disrespect Hag like that ever again
---
Looks like Entity slapped her butt
---
Play the way you want in the boundaries of the game - dc'ing isnt in it
---
So glad the dedicated servers will come and fix that
---
Winning the match has nothing to do with counterplay. Counterplay means winning the immediate individual engagement, which the Meg did many times on the corn map, despite Stridor.
---
Ummm what?
---
You got some flaws in this build.
---
You need to heal someone to activate it, then when you're on the hook getting unhooked, you will gain the broken status effect. When you're  OUTSIDE the killers terror radius it will start healing you passively. When you're back in tue terror radius the progress will pause.
---
So basically you're not able to use second wind when getting chased by the killer. You need to he outside of its terror radius.
---
excuse the fuck out of you but Spirit belongs into GodTier+++. Just because you're into boring generic female without a face doesn't mean she's hot.
---
Np, just saying and glad you are mature enough to understand - wish you all the best ;)
---
I see less red ranks in purple than I do in everything below.   Matchmaking abuse is rampant, and BHVR has their thumb up their ass about it.
---
Thanks
---
Seeing how the post creator agreed with me, your entire argument has lost all its merit
---
Gb and gl
---
7 what
---
Trapper is obviously in the S tier.
---
Its still super low my dude, wont happen often enough ;)
---
""Bon appetit" kind of meals" had me dying.
---
You seem the type of killer to complain about a sweaty 4 man swf with strong loadouts while playing nurse, but sure, i'll just go now and "let you play your own game how you want"
---
5 months for Ds 3 for ruin
---
Why does everyone hate Legion? I’ve only played for about a month and he’s pretty shit from what I can tell?
---
europe. but i'm not sure that makes a difference, seeing as my connectivity is a lot higher in the later hours when 'america is awake'. especially as killer. my point is that people do get salty, but if i manage to tell them they did a good job first, most replies are positive.
---

What rank are you?

get on my level boiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

How was I toxic and flamed you anywhere in this thread? You seem to be one of the sheeps that hopped on the "everything is toxic" train. And yeah sure lets just ignore how broken nurse with addons is, which even bots with under 500 hours can use to get rank 1 without a problem
---
First time I played killer, I hit each person once so they could heal and stood under every pallet I could find.
---
They shit talked me afterwards.  I now understand why some killer mains despise survivor mains.
---
Also you can hear who's shittin in the tall grass
---
Where my big boi billy?
---
Spirit with the ring and purple bracelet would like to meet you, they're nearly there already
---
Oh hey thanks. Glad you enjoy the videos :)
---
We don't know why he took it down. Maybe he realized you're right in that it breaks the rules, but the discussion between us was never if it violated the subreddit rules. 
---
The point of the conversation - which you've entirely missed, by the way - is that having usernames is not encouraging a witch-hunt and it actually benefits the community.
---
Please don't bother to tell me my argument has no merit if you haven't bothered to integrate and understand my point. It just comes off as foolish.
---
You need another body, but the good thing is that this sub has a thread every Friday that can be used to connect people so that they can test combinations, get used to perks, all kinds of things.
---
With DS so common right now, I really wouldn’t say tunnelling is viable.
---
That'd be u/int3r4ct.
---
Hopefully with the influx of new players, they'll mostly fight against each other for a little bit,
---
That's pretty much it.  You nailed it on the head.  If nothing else, reading these comments is making me resolve to just wait on dailies instead of trying to bum rush them just because I'm tired.
---
"what the fuck is that build"
---
"You are scared and insecure"
---
"You are probably the killer that complains about..."
---
Calling people below 500 hours bots
---
Yes you are toxic 
---
And yes i agree that nurse is broken - does IT give the survivors the right to ruin games for me and others? Ofc not
---
Yeah it's definitely still a meta perk
---
He literally wrote it to me 
---
So we know why he took it down and you are wrong
---
Just watch one of montos ninja wraith videos
---
It all depends on the game. hard camping an overly altruistic team is like the easiest thing ever for the killer. 1k guaranteed turns into 3 or 4ks depending on how greedy we're being
---
Uhhh kinda looks like you’re exploiting a bug
---
Why is this still a thing
---
They deserve the witchunt.   If BHVR actually gave a damn about reports in post game chat, bans would be flying and the community would self-censor.  Instead, it is going to take us surpassing League of Legends (pre-clampdown) toxicity levels before they care.   We are almost there, but there is still about 2 games a week I don't get told to kill myself.
---
Bit of context: I knew there was a Jane in the game but I haven't seen her for a while, eventually I got to the other side of the map (where I haven't been either for a bit) and saw this almost finished gen. I saw the locker and expected a locker stun to happen, but since I know how garbage this game is I walked past the locker, turned around and hit (with the intention of hitting the Jane the moment she jumps out since they always jump out too late and don't stun you lol). At first, since there was no one coming out I assumed I was just wrong and she isn't even in that locker, but all of sudden I hit her and I was like "wait what?!"
---
anyways. not the first time I see survivors getting hit in lockers, then again I think there might be actually a game in this bug
---
I honestly feel like you should’ve given thanutaphobia the credits for using his meme since his watermark is gone...
---
None of my business though 
---
🍷🐸

---
Just now posted my comment for context below. no exploiting here just a buggy surprise lmao
---
Thanks for the response!
---
Again, regardless of why or how it was removed, that is not the discussion. 
---
Since you cannot seem to stay on the topic and keep insisting that you are right without having to read the other side of the argument, I am going to have to pull the rip-cord on this conversation. 
---
If you are trolling, congratulations, you did get me. If not, best of luck to you in the future.
---
Bro chill, they already gave a release date
---
I've had an idea for a cosmetic for a while for Legion called "Love Birds", that both Frank and Julie get.  
---
Similar to prom, but punk. It has a cutesy look (ironically), and the main cute thing is that they have matching necklaces that are half hearts.   
---
Maybe Frank has a "HERS" shirt while Julie has a "HIS"   
---
i have so many idea but i cant draw so
---
Move Freddy and clown to F
---
Legion to S
---
And Wraith to B and then we have a deal
---
Noone deserves witchhunting 
---
Lets say someones account is linked to his personal Facebook page and some adrenaline filled teenager will come do him harm? 
---
Are you willing to take that risk for him?
---
Ok
---
**SAY HELLO TO MY EVIL WITHIN**
---
Looks like the Jane was exiting at the same time he swung.
---
Indeed. The advice I'd give u/Aerial_penguin is to make a decision based on the hatch location. Sometimes you'll want to be near the hatch in anticipation of it opening, sometimes you'll want to go to the gate that it's furthest from.
---
*Most* of the time the killer is going to go from the hatch to the nearest gate, and some of the time that'll be enough to let you escape.
---
If it's Billy or Nurse then you're going to need to be very lucky, though.
---
You move Legion right to the illegal category
---
And then put Piggy in god tier
---
Yea right thinking its hard surviving against billy, foc, or ruin.
---
Imo its better than what it used to be.
---
I remember the first time I played with a friend-
---
(Context: we were repairing a gen)
---
Me: ITS MYERS RUN
---
Friend: Its okay he's just being creppy watching us. Maybe he's friendly :D
---
Me: *leaves*
---
Friend: were r u going
---
(5 seconds later the tier 3 music sounds and he's down)
---
That's why wraith's legs are so skinny.
---
“Add ons” what an extra blink and/or range add ons? Yeah those are pretty broken. Just like prayer beads, I don’t even bother playing those games
---
This list is completely fucking incorrect. Right below huntress there should be a P3 Claudette that accidentally scares fellow players when it moves THEN legion.
---
I once ran for 5 gens and got downed but the 3 other survivors took turns blocking the killer from hooking me and long story short, we all got away alive lol
---
I never said I responded....
---
You only need mettle and a syringe
---
So the plan is:
---
Be at 2 stacks of MoM, get hit, get hit again but use the the syringe at the same time you get hit (with great timing youll get healthy again). We are at 2 hits and healthy, now you need to get hit again but this one being a protection hit to activate MoM, then get hit again and now next hit will be denied with MoM, and the next hit will down you.
---
So 5 hits in total to down you. Hard to pull off, but theoretically possible.
---
How is huntress illegal. Move her to godtier or this post is cancelled forever
---
I used uncommon addons so nothing too crazy, just like i said
---
Yeah yeah, I'm refreshing the forums and their Twitter from minute to minute and still haven't seen any date announced.
---
way better than before so definitely
---
Um k
---
Almost mandatory in solo play lol.
---
&gt; since it only works if being tunneled...
---
uh no a killer can be hit by DS without tunneling
---
April this year, when End Game Collapse arrived.
---
Reverse bear traps don't block the exit, they trigger when you cross a certain point - but only if they've been activated by a gen being completed.
---
So the people that are 100% going to play Steve the second he is out is not allowed to call themselves Steve mains because he is not out yet? Get out of here.
---
Because it is hag with pig mixed in a lab. Basically their Child.
---
Do, like, none of these people play killer at all? Survivors will use DS to do shit like hook dive for saves
---
why are you getting downvoted. Its true. They’re having streamers cone up to give feedback on the new content rn. Ohtofu and EdgarAllenBro to be exact
---
Don’t forget if they are s tier tho they need to be nerfed /s
---
I didn't know I needed this until now
---
He's kind of like the right of passage killer for survivors getting better at chases
---
Once you find a no insta-saw billy fun you're no longer trash at survivor. But for newbies who don't know about windows or how to mindgame pallets, billy is basically "go down as soon as you're found"
---
Because they legitimately expected either a clone of old freddy... for some reason, or a power where the demogorgon took people to an entirely different map.
---
For my Feng, I like her brown pony tail, the black and gray jacket with the white shirt, and red skinny jeans. The red jeans also put nice with her prestiged shirt.
---
&gt; Survivor gets hooked, killer hangs around the area with the intention to tunnel as soon as said survivor is unhooked. 
---
This is called camping.
---
But even that is a bit the survivors's fault. If killer is camping just do gens instead of doing unsafe unhooks.
---
Please show me a video of you maining Steve lmao. I just wanna see someone main him. You cannot claim anything that is not there. You can be excited all you like however you are a poser if you call him your main at the moment. 
---
Hey everyone this guy is a big fat phony!
---
that poor huntress lmao
---
*THE ghostface. Get it right /s
---
I don't know about 32k, but with the right build it's says to get 29,400 every game.
---
Oh Boi, I remember playing against him the first time... good ol' memories.
---
True
---
If you actually read the tutorials it helps so much
---
How are you so CREATIVE? I’m so jealous! Good job you lol
---
Yep. I don’t go into the building if I’m playing killer. If I’m close to them I will just to eliminate some pallets. But I never patrol that gen. Takes too long to get up there. Usually it pops immediately which is great for me.
---
well its pretty much every killer because thats what creativity is literally just combining two things together i dont get why people should complain new content is better than no content (btw i love your flair slam on that juicy pallet.)
---
You must be a lot of fun to play with
---
Yeah, but Mister Golden still ran you like a bitch 😂
---
100% agree with you
---
Morgon
---
This game is perfectly balanced hahaha
---
why does DS not work in KYF (kill your friend aka custom) matches??
---
I know she isn’t a man, but  the the huntress is the most handsome, manliest killer we got. She should be up there with micheal
---
This is one of the reason I'm glad I play on console. No chat. I still get the occasional message from a salty player but it takes a lot more effort on Xbox than PC.
---
Omg yes this would be amazing and would add to the suspense! This music is so tense in the movies (you knew some plot twist shit was about to go down!)
---
Funny to see that, because this was my genuine belief when I first got into the game. I asked people in post-game chat why I couldn't use the other mode of my chainsaw as Leatherface to make him run. Never would I have guessed this other mode of using a chainsaw was an "entirely different" character...
---
Lol I’m slowly making my way down your list and then I lost my shit when I read ILLEGAL 🤣🤣🤣
---
In the Fog there is no age, so no underage, so giggidy.
---
Yes but typically you will have your main up to 0p-50.
---
What **I** do is get one killer to level 50 and then spend all of their addons getting BP, that BP either goes to another character or goes to boosting that killer back to L50.
---
I got my Bubba to L35 without ever playing him, my Nurse is also L30 and I think ive played her twice.
---
Its hilarious because there are killers, that see incredible success at red ranks, that the bulk of the community just brushes off as though they are bad, because they arent nurse or billy.
---
I aint respecting shit until micheal gets his name chaned to The Boogey Man
---
&lt;3 
---
But what’s this about no PTB?
---
Thanks , ill still do check it out on my free time to see if i like it &lt;3
---
same i agree
---
 I do those with ghostface!
---
I applaude your supreme power
---
wooosh.
---
Roar instead
---
She didn't heal me when I was injured. Her being a nurse is literally the biggest scam of DBD /s
---
I often see toxic survivors 
---
They are the real killers of fun if you catch my drift
---
Yes, bodyblocking as seen here, is bannable lol.
---
That's hilarious. Well done. I love how everyone on here is crying about this being bannable...as if the devs themselves didn't design a level where you could easily do this. 
---
This is not the player's fault, especially in a mechanic as basic as this.
---
I'm a newer player. What is that perk called?
---
U R INDIPENSANT
---
I only got points for being chased because i got 1 hooked
---
His power is quiet simplistic when looking upon the newly released Freddy rework and his new found ability to teleport, plus that of Hag’s phantasmic traps teleport action, It feels as if nothing is new as his teleports can be destroyed/tampered with and his extra lunge is something that the game has had a good taste of already (Freddy) so it feels like that the new Killer has no original feel and will not change gameplay, unlike Ghostface who rewarded killers with oblivious survivors for easy kills/downs.
---
You should still blur them out
---
Well here’s an idea of what his ability could be that would tie in with his abilities in the book/movies. You know how he turns into his targets worst fear, his ability could be to randomly turn in to a different killer throughout the trial and some of his add-ons could give him increasingly rare add-one for what killer he becomes. The catch would be there is a cool down, he can’t transform within view of a survivor and he turns back after he hooks someone. What do you guys think?
---
Btw i just put myers and the trapper as the "gay boys" because it seems to be a popular ship. Hope no one gets triggered for that
---
Idk man i would love if they actually make an licensed killer that actually is very unique. I would probably love to play the demogorgon but its like hag, hell he can even use the same tricks as her. I prestige 3'd hag so i will probably like playing him too but ya know its just not unique for me. 
---
(Thx)
---
Ruin: *Allow me to introduce myself*
---
Surge: *Me too*
---
Overcharge: *Don't forget about me*
---
Pop: *Say goodbye to your gens*
---
I tunnel all the time now because survivors were sending me messages when they'd escape when I played as a "fair" killer. So now my goal is to make every game as painful as possible.
---
I don't have any issues with them unless they run like 3 flashlights and annoy me the whole game
---
Probably the PLAG, even Wraith is more common.
---
Great, another idiot who ragequits whenever he faces a killer or perk combo he doesn't like.
---
I rather spot him :P
---
Played perkless for a longer game no ed the toxic guys. Meanie.
---
Maybe not enough players or killers of your rank online. So it's the average rank of the group which is matched to killers one. You are needed to lower the average to get the balance with killer
---
The lab's corpser are ho- nevermind
---
I mean the postgame chat, in the game they can do anything its just a game after all
---
##LEAVE MY DEVOUR HOPE ALONE
---
I'm glad there are players that are not 5 year olds and don't cry 'bout everything 😂
---
Try downing a survivor near a wall if you can. When you pick them up, look at the wall so you can't get flashlighted.
---
I'm a bit confused... I agree with what you just said, but how does that make what i said BS?
---
Killer camps -&gt; Gen rush
---
If Killer doesn't camp, then you can get safely unhooked and if you aren't being an idiot you won't get tunneled.
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ SUMMON THE PTB ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
I like the ideas. Really with Stranger Things being added, anything is possible!
---
GIVE ME THE ~~POWER~~ PTB I BEG OF YOU
---
I'm pretty sure in the two months I've played, I've never come across a Legion or a Clown.  Maybe a Clown once?  I've also only come across Freddy once too, and that was post the fixes.  I haven't seen a Spirit or Plague and I only came across the Pig once too.  I imagine that's probably because I'm a 18 rank Survivor and all of these are paid DLC?  I know I don't own any of these either, so I'm contributing to the lack of these being seen, when I play as killer.
---
Same. Got the game during the Steam sale. I’m having fun.
---
Future reference (I don't know the whole scenario of what happened here) you can swing again to reset it. If they were all running to the exit gate you couldn't have done anything about that but if they were still needing to do gens and you get stuck, just swing anywhere and you can continue.
---
its fun to hate things as much as to love things, this one doesnt seem serious though
---
Where applicable, dont hug walls when you know she is phasing. She excpects it and will bump into to find you.
---
Why would I play a game where there’s no chance? Where the killer has no counterplay? No thanks
---
Probably the same reason you were match with a rank 12, swf match making.
---
I mean if you ranked low then theoretically everyone else you play with is ranked real low too. So you wouldn’t really be dragging a game down.

---
Oh ok, Thanks. Still new to the game.
---
I get it too. Games are pretty much unwinnable as the new players go down in seconds to even the most basic killers. All the noobs have NOED ready to go too.
---
&gt;  Iron Will is useful in case you're injured but won't help if they have Stridor
---
I think it might depend on your survivor. If you are Jane, it won't help. But Iron will Ace is hard to hear even with stridor.
---
Also new to spelling i see...
---
It's still better to just eat DS if it means getting rid of a survivor early. I don't like it but the reality is tunneling is the easiest path to winning as a killer.
---
I'd personally rather have Herobrine than anything to do with FNAF.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it!
---
You can't gen rush proxy camping. Because people will think that the killer is not camping but the minute you unhook the survivor, the killer is back like rashes. Which is fucking bullshit. There should be a requirement where killer can't go back to hook more than once.
---
GG MJ
---
same, I solo queued into a rank 15 killer and two rank 19 survivors.
---
Or you know, run lightborn
---
Portal seeems weaker than Freddy TP.
---
I tried out the Wraith recently and he begins the match stealthed. Are survivors notified by the whoosh sound or is this initial stealth a silent freebie?
---
It depends on timezone and some other factors. In DBD you queue as either a survivor or a killer rather than searching for a lobby more generally. As a general rule, you have to wait longer if you want to play killer than if you want to play survivor. 
---
In my timezone, during the evening (say 18:00-23:00 GMT) it usually takes less than a minute to find a game as a survivor and 2-3 minutes to find one as a killer. 
---
They're constantly releasing new characters and cosmetics as DLC so I see this game being supported for quite some time as it's probably worth it for the devs to keep supporting it.
---
The Game isn't Killer-sided for the majority of the cast (because of all the obstacles with extraordinarily safe pallets and because traversing to a staircase takes more time than moving in a straight line) but Nurse excels on it, so it definitely feels annoying when you get a meta-Killer.
---
Lery's is pretty survivor-sided if you know what you're doing, it has a good mixture of safe pallets and now every room has an incredible number of windows to keep looping infinitely (literally infinitely, since windows unblock in chases after sixty seconds I think?) through the map. Sure you can get turned around in Lery's, but that's just a matter of practice (and the Killer can get turned around too, so it's pretty even).
---
I do prefer the Red Forest maps, anything that is 90% open (or just trees) is pretty good, this can also apply to one of Plague's maps despite the larger building.
---
I agree to a certain extent. I just though this would actually be a cool idea.
---
They’re doing something with fortnite so it might happen
---
Same. I have less than 100 hours as a killer and no ruin, cos I mainly care about the BP more than actually winning, but it really cracks me up when I'm in rank 14 and I get 3 purples or 2 purples and a red rank...
---
Then you get the blood lodge and survs can see you coming miles away. So much of invisibility T\_T
---
I'm LightskinWasp, in case I forget to add tonight! r5
---
a david without dead hard?  thats a rare specimen
---
Idk why is that
---
I've always wanted to play this game, but never gave it the chance. I'm a huge fan of hide and seek or cat and mouse mechanics, so this seems pretty up my alley.
---
Is it worth buying and learning to play? I'd be playing solo until/if I met people.
---
This is a great idea. When you're playing one the others relax and smoke or something.
---
While I agree that people need to stop DC'ing. Yelling like this isn't helping anything. If it's doing anything it's adding fuel to the toxicity pit we call DBD
---
Hag Who was literal child when she was kidnapped by the bandits... Yikes
---
(I know the devs have confirmed everyone in the game is adult but still)
---
Doctor and Nurse were both evil, getting to where they were over years and planning out how to torture/kill those under their care.
---
Remember Nurse killed hundreds, she worked there, there's no tragic backstory there.
---
Trapper also went evil on his own, IIRC.
---
Only Hillbilly and Huntress are particularly tragic, the rest chose their fates.
---
once you know she has it I just gen tap if I know she's not chasing someone
---
This is a nice idea although I also don't know how'd you get survivors to follow you with it.
---
Public Test Build
---
Just because of the sheer amount of tunneling recently, I've been running it nonstop, but then they just camp you for being a "filthy ds user". It's a lose lose lol.
---
But in all seriousness, yeah, it can honestly be a life saver some times when the killer just does not want to leave you alone off hook (i.e. a nurse that just waits to teleport back to the hook once you're unhooked, any killer that is camping with a stealth ability etc.).
---
it's a free win if the exit gate is opened and that's if you hit it
---
Alright I hear all of you and maybe I am just buns at the game and I was mad, but I had to rant about it somewhere. All my friends I play with agree spirit is broken and I thought everyone felt that way, so plz you brought my karma from 45 to -3 lmao. Alright I’ll try all your guys’s suggestions although I knew most of these already. If I change my mind, I’ll post about it here. But as of now my opinion on the spirit is still the same. Thanks for all the feedback
---
Against the subreddit rules btw
---
They did at the reveal or in the trailer I thought, like September
---
Same for killers! DC'ing as I'm leaving the exit gate is cuntish! stop it!
---
I’m not upset. Just making an observation. Survivors complain about any play style that involves them not winning easily while taunting and tea bagging.
---
Rare footage of Jane moaning one second after getting hit
---
The Nurse went insane over working at the hell-hole of an Asylum, which is why she killed 'em all. Sure, it's not AS tragic as some, but it wasn't really her fault.
---
Because this games matchmaking is THE example of what not to do.
---
All depends on rank and players attitude.
---
I'm thinking new status effect and following him is the only way to remove it. Maybe he can't attack when trying to get you to follow him, and there's a chance you'll get rid of the status effect, and a chance that he can attack. Or you can get rid of the status effect and then he can start a chase. Idk.
---
I've got another idea. I'm going to post it.
---
It's my rank, and I'll DC if I want to.  DC if I want to.  DC if I want to.  You would DC too if it happened to you.
---
Ah
---
And another 3 survs in the end chat: "useless claudette didn't touch a single gen" being useful only to the killer :P
---
Pretty sure that throwing your flashlight in a killer's face would be more reliable than getting the timing right with blinding them.
---
there is a game in this bug
---
I've died alot of times there
---
Said no one ever
---
Hex: Ruin. It affects 2 to 4 Survivors (depending on its tier) and causes them to regress the Generator's repair bar they're working on if they hit a good skillcheck and to not gain extra progress if they hit a great skillcheck, which, as a result, slows down the repair rate of Generators.
---
However, since it's a "Hex" perks, it means it is active only as long as its Hex Totem is not found and destroyed by the Survivors.
---
Alrighty then.
---
Why should I sacrifice winning the game just for some entitled survivors, oh please
---
Well we know September but there hasn't been a release date yet.
---
Well these guys didnt do anything and i died on first hook
---
2 minutes and 9 seconds to get into a game!
---
It's not bannable, toxic yes but not bannable
---
The killer got screwed too and probably took a depip like you did. Just send unsportsmanlike reports for DC and move along. I think the matchmaking avoids players you've reported, but not sure. They will start punishing for this /eventually/
---
Sir, this is a Wendy's
---
Because it’s fun.
---
You know, like video games?
---
Body blocking is not bannable. If it was then why would killers have collision?
---
Holding the game hostage is bannable though, which is the reason it is stated in the report options. Holding the game hostage is trapping someone somewhere with no way to die or escape. The survivor died in the video, thus it is not holding the game hostage.
---
If you don't believe me, look it up. The devs have stated it in multiple streams that body blocking on its own without holding the game hostage is fine.
---
Spine chill, stop running, and dont hug walls.
---
Technically speaking that wouldn't even be a contradiction
---
This Stranger Things DLC is intense.
---
This sounds like something a gay person would say. Don't worry, G, we're rainbow brothers.
---
Would have dropped 30 minutes ago
---
Nearly had a stroke reading this, but if Hellhounds were somehow introduced I'd cry.
---
Maybe they disabled perks?
---
&gt;Its not like i make the game not fun,
---
The stats you recorded would disagree with your claim.
---
Hell by your own admission "I 4k with it consistently". Consistently being 4k'd is not fun for the survivors. So I can see why people nope the fuck out of that match and queue for another that might be more enjoyable.
---
Yes. First, you can see your equipped perks on the bottom right corner of your screen. Active perks will have their normal color, while inactive perks (like destroyed Hexes) will be darker. So, when a Hex Totem is destroyed, its perk icon will go dark.
---
Second, and really, the main way to know and first thing you will notice is the loud thunder noise plus the noise notification you're gonna see. 
---
[Example (the Hex perk here being the bottom one).](https://youtu.be/2HX4OJtC7_U?t=348)
---
Okay whatever 😂😂😂😂
---
omfg take my upvote!
---
No Mither
---
Running the killer around is my favorite way to get more points. Of course it takes practice but once you get good enough you can loop killers for 5 gens without being downed. 
---
There's also of course doing as many objectives as you can and being altruistic when you can
---
who gon tell him
---
Even more unpopular: Jonathan
---
Spamming the sub is fun lul
---
Also are you trying to imply i don't have fun with videogames? I'm not from /v/, buddy
---
I never see Doctor, Plague, and actually completely forgot that there was even a Clown in the game
---
2 new stealth mechanics and bloodweb changes too. Theres a lot going on here, it shouldnt be surprising if something went wrong on the back end and they are scrambling to fix it, as peanits seems to be implying recently.
---
Thanks, man. It looks really fun. I'll probably pick it up since it's on sale.
---
You should post this on r/hitboxporn, dude.
---
Let's play all these perks all at once with omega blink nurse
---
Yeah I like the idea I dislike fnaf because creators click baited it to death making it seem super scary i thought it was creepy the first time I saw but after watching 2 more I got less and less scared
---
Sorry about that
---
He is bottom 5, yes
---
You're right but I was just trying to think of a witty title.
---
This is why I haven't learned to play huntress and nurse.  They're a lot harder to use and as soon as survivors know your no good with them you're going to get BM'd all damn game.  So I can normally only tolerate 1 or 2 matches before im ready to slam my face through the screen
---
yup, he see and hear that someone destroyed Hex totem
---
And mori says hi.
---
* Screenshots highlighting unbalanced matchmaking (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
It effects everyone now at all tiers. They changed that a few months ago.
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
My thoughts exactly. I think the DLC is coming either mid- or late-September, so the earliest PTB would be next week.

You actually can't know if the helmet was active at the time he started it or not meaning it could be a game stalling since you would have to do a gen and ultimately kill your teammate
---
Anyways its cuntish and completely unneeded
---
You might hate me for being toxic but thx for clarifiyng that :)
---
I miss that sound so much zombies aren’t even that good in new cod
---
What I’m hearing is, “I’m meant to be a dick.” 
---
No ones saying killing them isn’t your objective, but your priority as a human being should be a small act of kindness. You’d likely still pip up if you gave baby dweet hatch, but since you’re an asshole, you’ll justify your way out of it.
---
One important skill I had to learn here is when to give up. That guy you're chasing for almost 2 and a half gens now? Just give up on him and go for the other 3. He's good, he knows where the pallets are already dropped and where there might be more pallets left to loop around. Sure, you may catch him eventually, as we all do and especially with bloodlust, but at what cost? a potential 2 or even a 4k? Even the most coordinated SWF team has atleast that one potato, that one cursed with lesser skill among all them. Go for him, pressure them to not do gens and force saves. Go for the others, they do not know which pallets are already looped. They might not even know which pallets are safe or unsafe. Never let them get into you, and never tunnel vision a singular survivor if you want to succeed in the game.
---
Reminds me of the guy in Spiderverse that got doinked with a bagel
---
You essentially need to let the killer down and hook you at that point. Every game I run the killer the entire time either ends with a black or a depip because they wouldn’t just leave me alone the entire match and everyone gen rushed in the meantime. Even if I escape in red ranks it’s a loss for me and a win for me. My teammates escape maybe I escaped but I barely made any points and I never got to open that damn chest with plunderers
---
I’m also on console. Those 10 FPS chases in the corn are rough.
---
Ok nice but could you like not camp plz
---
You must be cool?
---
Wraith is low tier af
---
That the DC ratio is completely out of control for a competetive game and the entitlement od survivors dc'ing because they have a bad matchup is also outrageous
---
Loosing is not fun - then what i should Play worse just too let survivors win? Where is the challange then
---
Yeah but it was worth it 😂
---
Double bloodpoints? Where did they announce that?!
---
yes, but it’s hard and u will get banned
---
Disappointed ghost sigh &gt; oink. Not to mention its far easier to speak the survivor language with fast crouches.
---
What the fuck am I reading?
---
Don't get me wrong, it is an absolute dick move and I don't condone it at all.
---
Plus you're right, we have no information showing the helmet being active when the trapping started, which makes it an edge case (technically a gen would have to be done in order to progress the game so the trap would activate at some point, but it could take a long time and thus I think it would be considered an edge case)
---
Again I'm not saying this behaviour is good, it isn't. Just saying it's not bannable since bodyblocking itself is not bannable and I see so many people stating it is.
---
Which perks do you expect to become "meta"(or just more usable than before) with addition of new ones with Stranger Things DLC? I was thinking about Deliverance,Quick &amp; Quiet and Head On(DS when you don't own it) when you will use Inner Strength,and maybe ultimate return of Iron Will for a ultra stealth build with Fixated and Urban Evasion + 4th slot? I know that it's used quiet often but right now it looks better than ever. Also I think that if Inner Strength will not be nerfed in PTB then its time to say goodbye to Self Care for real,I played a few hours without it and damn,right now I don't see any reason to run it,especially if you're playing SWF.
---
Really? for me it's always an hour and a half from now..
---
oh feelsbadman
---
I think it’s funny.
---
I found this a while back and it’s perfect https://youtu.be/v2IYpJQL01M
---
It was active do you think It would be fun for me to sit there for like 8 minutes?
---
I actually taught a dancer (stripper) friend of mine to start doing that whenever she doesn't wanna be at work.  It's code for "jimmy help". She's SUPPOSED to pretend she's yawning loudly but she's not subtle and it's fantastic.  I then run up and tell her she's needed in the changeroom or she has to get ready for stage.
---
we should get one since this is a pretty big deal like ma boy mickey was when he got released
---
Same, either do bones or get boned.
---
Adrenaline is kinda pointless while low rank. Your teammates will not power gens
---
Ghostface is a certified Survivor to Killer translator
---
i think it would be good for catching up to people the only probelm with it i think is loops with twist and turns similar to billy where you can curve around corners to hit survivors with the chainsaw for easy downs unless the survivor does a 360
---
So I'm an xbox player who just bought dbd for pc, any tips for someone who isnt used to pc gaming?
---
DBD being a paid game makes adding SCP's kind of complicated.
---
SCP's, legally, can be used in anything. However, the work they are added to needs to be released under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license.
---
This means that people will be able to copy the work wholesale, and even sell it, provided that they properly attribute the source and release their work under the same license.
---
Legally speaking, this would mean that either the DLC would have to be free, or DBD itself would need to be free (and a CC-BY-SA licesned game) with SCP-3008 as a free character.
---
yeah new content is better than no content
---
He also clarified, theres a specific issue that they are working on a solution, the PTB will happen when that issue is resolved. So, could be as soon as later today, could be literally after the bloodhunt.
---
Why do people DC when i trap them in a corner with the plague and vomit on them until they are hurt and then down them?
---
(BTW getting them into broken state like that only takes like 3 seconds)
---
Replace ruin with NOED
---
They already said in the official Discord PTB will be September 10
---
Medkit?
---
More like 
---
Medyeet
---
No.
---
For a survivor play meg. She has 3 half decent perks
---
He died in less than minute...
---
*Yells in Zenyatta*
---
What is poisonous about his opinion on those things? He says spirit fury is bad for game health because it encourages holding w and making no attempt to mindgame. And bamboozle is bad because you force a surv to drop a pallet when they might have went for another vault and given you hit
---
civilized people call it ding dong

Kinda off topic, but I looked for that song:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Uo1nNt6LU

Am I misunderstanding something or that singer likes to sing about crying a lot?
---
Sept 10 PTB, Sept 24 Release.  They announced it on their Discord already
---
Too late to get bbq
---
Wrong. They announced Sep 10 PTB sadly
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
the only thing that would suck about this killer is if the portal glows when you teleport to it making it less stealthy and give a survivor a notification when he is teleporting i hope it isnt an addon i hope its built into his kit
---
here's the thing, if you know that the enemy team is super hard altruistic group of swf and BBQ doesn't show anyone far away, if you patrol around you're gonna find at least 2 to 3 survivors crouching around waiting for you to run away.
---
I know it's a cunty way to playing the game but being bullied with flashlights and tbags is also a cunty way of playing the game.
---
Learning how to run and juke killers is my issue now. I'm not very great at it.
---
Freddy’s bitches
---
They announced it on their Discord
---
Sept 10 PTB...  September 24th Release along with the dedicated servers.
---
The severe lack of commas to separate thoughts in the prior person sentences make it really difficult to read, agreed.
---
My problem isn’t in similar abilities but rather that it leads me to infer a lack of creativity. They worked with that they had when it came to Ghostface and Myers and those you mention but the potential of a fresh and creative new dynamic in the Demogorgon being thrown away for a familiar ability - again - leads me to infer a lack of creativity.
---
They’re not unviable, they’re just cancer af and people don’t like letting teammates die
---
Tell me honest to yourself : is this the intended game mechanic? Or is it just exploiting the game ai?
---
SCHLAP-SCHLAP-SCHLAP
---
I agree it’s out of control and bad for the games health, but people are doing it for a reason. Unless you fix the reason they’re doing it the problem will persist. Other killers have much lower ratios, indicating it’s a problem with the nurse. 
---
I don’t see it’s a sense of entitlement. People are playing to have fun. If you play a killer that ruins that experience they’re under no obligation to keep playing. There is a problem with game balance if survivors regularly enter a match and think “it’s X killer, fuck this”
---
Losing can be fun. I’ve enjoyed lots of games which I’ve lost. Losing a close match against a challenging killer is great. Getting dumpstered by an overpowered one is not. 
---
I’ll say it again, you agreed nurse was broken and consistently 4K with her. Why would other players want to be in a game where you consistently win with a broken killer? That’s not fun.
---
You can play just fine with a controller on PC. The game was pretty much designed with controller in mind.
---
Yes, like I said this post wasn’t about the ability suggestion but rather pointing out how much potential this dlc had for something completely new and fresh. Bringing new players, old players and such into an experience not entirely famously but enough to keep the core of the game.
---
Yes that is me.
---
No clue.  I remember hearing the song alot as a kid on the radio.  It just suddenly popped into my head when I read OP's message.
---
Wait are you telling me monstrous shrine isnt viable?
---
I mean if they don’t it’ll die quicker than fish out of water.
---
Jesus christ I thought reddit would be the one place that's not full of crying survivors...I'm out
---
Mate I dont care enjoy playing the killer that ignores all game mechanics with range addons and extra blinks it's why I play killer basically exclusively now there is no point arguing about it.
---

The plag and the Wraith.
---
Perma spirit fury
---
Toxic swf does that even when they get completely wrecked, met some swf some days ago so put some purple add-ons and a mori, turned into DC heaven.
---
when you hamper with it you cant hear the killers terror raduis plus the killer gets a notification basically making it a mini tinkerer, also freddy doesnt have an extra lunge range he has a standard lunge range the only killer is a tier three michael that has extra lunge although you could argue that nurse and billy have an extra lunge range when they use their power or hag when a trap gets teleported to
---
Okay bud, go stay in a corner and you can come out when DBD is some esports game
---
I mean, anything for big boi Steve
---
Wait until the switch version releases.
---
Lmao I'm telling you, some people just have an IQ lower than a carrot!
---
I mean I had someone on this thread call me a baby killer after I mentioned I had planned on not killing all 4 survivors. Then he called me out saying if I killed them I am. Either his reading skills or his logic is non-existent
---
I will say I don't really like to run Decisive despite being beneficial. Also, not to blame teammates but in low ranks, I often see teammates waste a lot of pallets (especially the killer shack pallet) forcing me to write it off a lot of dead zones. It's frustrating.
---
“Demongoron” also
---
People hate him because it's easy for him to sneak up on you. If you're bad at looping, you die pretty fast against wraith
---
No..they didn’t.
---
Better than everyone using the robin tally/score meme wrong
---
Agreed. Some games I find myself doing the majority of the gens or everyone is rushing the gens.
---
It's really not optimal, but a fun build you could run with those perks is Quick and Quiet, Dance With Me, and Head On.  When the killer is coming your way, or even better chasing after someone, all you do is QnQ into a locker, wait for the killer to pass by and Head On bust out of it, thenDance With Me will cover your tracks while you run away.    Very fun, but it might also get you facecamped.
---
The gayer the better
---
Good, people will stop complaining at once and the entitlement of ragequitting might be gone
---
I think this is why Spirit is the only killer to have a "real face." BHVR made a face-rig specifically for her model, and it really shows when she's idling in the menu and makes that... that deeply emotional, sad face. I mean, it's not *that* emotionally moving *until compared with other killers*. After seeing masks and cloth covers and ugly, torn, leather-like faces, Rin's expression hits you hard.
---
I suck at video games but love this game to death. It isn't overly complicated. I would suggest
---
I’d wager inner Strength will see lots of use. Surge and Mindbreaker will maybe get used on specific uses. As for meta defining, I doubt it.
---
Lee Everett, Kenny, Clementine.
---
If we get Clementine maybe Minerva as the killer and Lee could have the Stranger but I'm unsure :/
---
that's my plan, make them sick of my shit and just give me what I want
---
I got my first salty message yesterday about how I couldn’t hit or catch the guy.
---
Still got the 4K
---
Meg is a good one to build up early I find too...I used to run sprint burst a lot in my early days.  Personally I play stealth and knowledge type game. .I like to know where killer and other survivors are as often as possible.  Claudette for self care ...some don't like it but it beats spending half the match looking for someone to heal you.  Claudette for the camo.  Urban evasion is great for slinking away as covertly as possible.  Some like the flashy outfits that say 'hello killer I'm right here' but early on I find it's good to get the basics down like where to hide, how to not be seen or discovered etc etc.  Small game is a fun one and handy against some killers as it allows you to run around more often vs trapper and hag and such and to be the hero that cleanses ruin or noed right away.
---
Forgot to put Hag, and nurse haha
---
Yeah saw some speculation by players but no official word. Nice try.
---
Tear III me, daddy
---
We have no set info on either. It’s probably not happening today though cause we’ve gotten no heads up. In the dev stream they didn’t say anything about the upcoming PTB for it. And as for price it’s all speculation on that too. We may see multiple bundles or just the one big package.
---
I just want us all to play like we are trying to play out scenes in a horror show.
---
One where we all go back to the trailer and laugh about it.
---
Instead, we have 5 minute games and salt.
---
Everyone is gay when Scoops ahoy drops
---
I’m not sure what you want me to say. If you’re making the game not fun for four people, don’t be surprised if they don’t continue playing.
---
\&gt;.&lt; yessssssssssssss
---
I see, a default build for Spirit imo I would say is:
---
Make your Choice, BBQ, Nurse's calling and Save the Best for last.
---
In case you ever need a default spirit build.
---
Now like a Strong Spirit build when you just wanna win as spirit would be:
---
Hex: Devour Hope, Hex: Haunted Grounds, Surveilance, Hex: Thrill of the Hunt.
---
With the Addons: Prayer Beads and Mother's Daughter Ring.
---
Just in case you ever need any default builds for spirit :animewink:
---
If they do then fuck.
---
Yes because survivors who play fairly deserved to be BM'ed.
---
then how is it wrote?
---
When the dedicated servers drop, i expect bans, not your crydc's
---
She has a promising career as a Farm-Assist
---
JESUS.
---
then don't blame 2 freaking words please

---
Spine Chill and Iron Will are SOLID perks against the spirit. 
---
A good all round stealth build is:
---
Spine Chill
---
Bond
---
Iron Will
---
Urban Evasion
---
Lightweight and any other perks that get rid of scratch marks are also useful against the spirit. Dance with Me can be VERY GOOD in chases against her - but it's situational and you have to be aware and time vaults correctly.
---
Pig and Legion
---
my face when someone’s trying to unhook me and another survivor brings the killer all the way to me
---
Nein ash forever
---
GF near the top
---
These whippersnappers have it easy nowadays, back in my day...
---
Head on, spine chill, Q&amp;Q, dance with me
---
Luckily, rank doesn’t matter. What matters is that you have fun! 
---
I only started playing Legion recently (as well as Plague) and they’re definitely a lot of fun to play.
---
but you need a "weak" survivor in the team to do that
---
It will be a bit of time, but people will get good with them, and they might buff some things.
---
Rn the power seems like it will be fun, but garbage against good teams.
---
Better known as the “ding dong b*tch”.
---
At least Demogorgon is  safe. He can hide in the upside down
---
I play killer mostly now and they never do anything that "entitles" them. I think everyone should be entitled to having a good experience. I know you want to win but you can't win without survivors, just because someone wants to have fun doesn't make them assholes. Just don't tunnel people over others and camp them, I play killer on how I want killers to treat me. Try being nice on both sides and you'll see what I'm talking about. Do you how nice of a feeling it is getting a gg from a team even when you 4k them but play fairly?
---
Ive one friend who i play swf with, and he does not play killer at all. He uses a lot of insta heals, and then he asks himself "Why am i getting camped?" and I, as a killer main, cant just stop laugh, cuz as killer main, i know how this game sucks for low tier killers, and now add an insta to the game... its just toxic and uneccesary, games goes quick already.. No need for an insta
---
I'll find a way ;)
---
Back in my day *struggling with a walker* we had pink perks. Oh those pretty pink perks.
---
legion gang
---
I just want the pink perks back tbh
---
wtf just happened?
---
Is it actually possible?
---
You need to spin your left thumbstick clockwise or counter clockwise. And depending on the direction of your left thumbstick you need to turn your camera in the opposite direction with he right thumbstick.so if you want to do a 360 to the right, you spin your left thumbstick clockwise snd turn your camera left at the same time. And vice versa for the other direction
---
It's because the games aren't that scary
---
I’m not a survivor main, I’m just not an asshole, unlike you apparently. If I bully a group of survivors to where there’s a good few gens left and everyone’s been hooked a couple of times, someone at the least is getting hatch. Maybe I was just raised not to be a dick, idk
---
Because you outplayed them and they won’t accept that
---
It's even funnier after the 100th time
---
God, you're trash, no wonder DCing is at an all time high. People like you are the worst.
---
There is lots of broken shit in this game apart from nurse, i am not ragequitting when survivors instaheal someone from the ground, or when mettle of Man was broken , or even when infinites were in the game i didnt too
---
But when something is broken from the survivor side - god forbid
---
There really isn’t much counter play to Prayer Beads Spirit. Spine Chill works but then you have to run it every game on the odd chance you get a Spirit (granted, it works on all killers. I just don’t think it’s the most helpful perk against most). 
---
So gen-tapping is the safest bet, unless you know she is chasing someone at the time. 
---
Prayer Beads OP
---
You can google them..
---
adrenaline
---
Honestly, it seems like survivors in this game consider killers as public servants. That we're just here to entertain them. 
---
Newflash, fuckos, we're here to enjoy the game. I couldn't give a can of cold piss whether the survivors enjoy themselves or not, I bought the game same as them and I'm trying to have fun the way I want to have fun.
---
The trap should stóp when killer is in the chase - Dwight even runs so the chase would start but the ai doesnt register it - its just exploiting
---
usually happens when there is one gen or the exits are open
---
they seem to want to at least stop someone if they are getting run over
---
I don't get how playing the video game as intended is somehow being a dick. I'm not obligated to lose out on bloodpoints for others. I don't go around in shooters offering the enemy team free points because "I'm not a dick."
---
Don’t touch me!
---
This works both ways though, it's not just on the killer
---
Tunneling is when somebody is unhooked and you go out of your way to catch them and hook them again. Camping is toxic because it doesn't give the survivors a chance and I'd recommend you don't do it
---
The chase only starts when the killer starts running. This isn't a chase.
---
Oh no, 600 blood points oh dear oh my
---
I feel the same way about the spirit tbh
---
All those freshmeat killers I can loop around a pallet for days and survivors I can torment with overcharge/ruin/unnerving presence Doctor. Mhhh just thinking about it makes me hard.
---
One thing to keep in mind is, that "good survivor" you can't catch might be a potatoe at the red ranks. Giving up on him and chasing a potatoe might win you that one game, but learning how to catch this good player will help you in the long run imo.
---
Of course, if he's at an infinite or found a nice BL spot, its a different thing.
---
Seems like you being a dick, mocking me there.
---
90% of the time.
---
*touch*
---
You’d be correct, I’m mocking you for being a dick.

Yeah Billy is better than LF but he's the original one that inspire him.
---
Also according to me and being a fan of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, they did an awesome job for bringing Bubba to DbD : his stance, the way he runs, the tantrum, the chainsaw's swings, his voice everything is incredibly near the original movie and that's why he's probably my favourite killer.

For this and for Bubba's basement parties. Best parties

I don’t recall paying for her with anything.

Jesus Christ your either a twelve year old or an adult that acts like a twelve year old because you get barely any social interaction.
---
And you are wrong again - even afk killers can trigger a chase as seen with bots in the game
---
Only on console
---
That's not true at all
---
Spirit is def not as bad as nurse i agree.
---
Except when the old content is never fixed.
---
Mate it’s your choice, I’m just telling you that if you know nurse is problematic and people dodge her, you’re going to have less proper games than if you play another killer.

I’m not the one that’s trying to be a reddit warrior, seeking out someone and trying to justify being a dick because I’ve never had sex before

OMG he has a controversial opinion about two perks! Clearly he knows nothing about the game and everything he says and does should be completely disregarded!

Then check it for yourself - stand while doing nothing as a killer and survivors will start running and trigger the chase

Also buy me a pizza when you prove yourself wrong

You are what’s wrong with the community :)

My 3 mains are Plague, Wraith and Doctor. Granted I have to use meta builds and strong add-ons at higher ranks but they are the most fun for me. I’m partial to a bit of Trapper too.

Yeah but it would be weird if it wouldnt be glowing. He is supposed to be as close to the series as he can be. 
---
But i get you, they should make it a very dim glow that can only be seen if youre REALLY close
---
Thanks dude. I’m on PC and none of my friends play so I guess I’m going it on my own haha
---
That's not true at all, you can initiate a chase with a killer that's standing still, so it should've activated but didn't bc game is great.
---
&gt; viewed as being scummy 
---
What's your point? Im not trying to be nice,  I'm trying to play the damn game. 
---
If I'm not in a chase then I know there's 2 survivors in 1 spot I'm sure as hell going back and if the injured one is still there then I'm going to put you back down because that is how the game is played. 
---
And it being completely busted before does not at all change that it's busted now too. A full minute of guaranteed protection is absolutely nuts and given that you don't have to threat healing because it's better if you get targeted that's just flat out 2 survivors on gens with no pressure for 60 seconds. 
---
So no it's not balanced,  not even close. "Completely ignore survivor is not counterplay" at all
---
Naa the survivors that ALWAYS send messages when they escape are.
---
Getting in there and playing games is your best bet. Play at least a few games with each of the killers to see which of their game play you like the best. Then play as your favorite for a while as it'll probably be more fun while you're learning the ropes. 
---
The biggest thing in my opinion: make sure you don't get discouraged. You are going to have games where miss attacks and you don't kill anyone. It is what it is.  Don't be afraid to be bad. You're learning just like everyone else did. I'm with you where i exclusively played survivor because I didn't want to be bad as a killer. Now I think playing killer is more fun while solo queuing.
---
End game I see him being strongest but you can just run away when you see the portal glowing. His portals are good for patrolling but pretty useless in chase and he might have a mega lunge but it has a wind up and it can't change direction like Pig dash. I suspect the chase will be real weak unless those portals can expand their AOE to give survivors that 'Oblivious' status effect otherwise that lunge won't cut it.
---
Hit boxes: "Wait that's illegal!"
---
Okay, heres the thing, I will camp/proxy a hook because it gives me the upper hand, and I am set up to do so (hook close to gens, totem placements,  perks, no pallets, overly altruistic survivors), im not just gonna let them pull someone off the hook, im gonna make them work for it, and maybe if their smart enough and that they see im patroling/camping then they will just do gens, and after I figure that out THEN I WILL LEAVE THE HOOK. And as for tunneling, I only tunnel during endgame, when survivors dont heal, hook save right in my face, or (and I can’t stress this one enough) if their the only person I find. Im sorry if a situation calls for me to play a little scummy but thats how it goes and you shouldn’t complain in the first place because the circumstances were in the killers favor. The ONLY time you should complain is if the killer facecamps you first hook. Thank you for reading.
---
How many fucking times do I have to explain this. Playing a video game as it is intended and doing well, because the enemy team did bad, is not being a dick. If you think that I'm wrong, then I guess all of the top competitive overwatch league teams are dicks who won't let the enemy team get a few kills. It's not my fault the survivor's were shit at the game. It's not my fault that the game is based around making the enemy lose. Is it so hard to wrap your tiny brain around the idea that not everyone wins?
---
I don’t think “people” are, you just hear the minority complain because they are the only ones talking about it.
---
I imagine most other killer mains would be like me and sit tight until we at least see it on PTB
---
Beating those guys perkless and with no addons as the wraith would be a challenge even for a top tier player...
---
I see you didn’t bother to read. That’s fine. I can do the same. Do you, boo boo.
---
"Come back, let me touch your butthole!"
---
I play both. When I'm playing the killer, survivors often make me want to play like an ass. I'm going to get hit by pallets, and I'm going to break pallets. If I get hit or am just breaking one and you decide to tea bag and lead me to the next pallet and repeat, you're getting face camped and tunneled. Same goes for body blockers and people that 99% sabotage hooks.
---
Yes its my choice to be a decent human being that respects others even when they pick op strats and i expect the same from others
---
Nothing justifies dc'ing from a competetive game
---
No, it only counts as buying the DLC if you bought it from the store.
---
Fff. Someone hasn’t read the rule book.
---
I imagine it gets a lot of DC's.
---
Why are you defending him? He has no case and neither do you.
---
the better option would be to still let you hear her footsteps
---
I'm not sure why you're so excited for changes that will decimate the casual playerbase needed to keep the game alive.
---
Tunneling isn't unviable. It is actually really strong since you can get people out of the game faster but also makes you a PoS who struggles with pressuring and is just a major bitch move.
---
Oh and I guess a toolbox of any kind for ez gen repair.
---
indeed I forgot billy, I made a lot of wrong decision anyways, I'll update it later !
---
8000, I have no life
---
Can't wait for dedicated servers when all those 2kbit/s killers get a taste of their own medicine
---
Well when you act like a dick don't be surprised when people treat you like one.
---
That goes for real life too, by the way
---
Comparing death in a game to death in real life is actually the worst thing you could’ve done, how dare you threaten my children
---
So every single survivor that escapes since the very first time you played has always sent you a message shit-talking? I don’t believe it.
---
no, u
---
The updated version is coming soon where I rethinked things \^\^
---
Seriously, why do you feel so compelled to suck this guy off when he has no point and no reasonable argument.
---
I think the biggest reason this doesn't count as a chase is because the survivor can't pick up momentum in such a small area, thus the game might not see it as fully running which doesn't start the chase.
---
But it should start the chase, a running survivor is all it should take to start a chase as long as the killer has vision of said survivor.
---
Hear me out guys: babysitter plus distortion.
---
Both had adrenaline and OP had decisive strike
---
Yeah, all maps should just be flat open planes with no geography. That would totally improve the killer experiance. Honestly pallets should go too.
---
Gross.
---
If I'm being looped i just leave.
---
I always say let me touch you
---
You'd hate my drawings then lmaoo
---
How bout bob
---
I like playing Clown to keep his numbers up a bit. He def needs a buff or two tho.
---
Bing Bong*
---
A) Killers do this too.
---
B) Not every survivor is a toxic dickhead.
---
"location reveal thing tied with madness" do you mean the screaming? Or the illusionary doctors?
---
Oh I absolutely agree. Should’ve stated that in the previous post, but yes, it applies to survivors too.
---
Then do better ingame =&gt; Pip =&gt; Get Better people.
---
I play both (mostly Xbox) and using a controller is fine on PC, especially as survivor.
---
Here’s my suggestion for it. Buff the timer by 30 seconds (90 seconds total) but 60 seconds is removed once someone else is hooked. It’s a buff to the tunnel aspect of it but a nerf to the BS part of it.
---
Disagreement does not mean didn't read lol. Very mature take on that though
---
Also, based on your comment history, you are a survivor main.
---
Bruv, you are such a clown, everybkdy knows how op the corn maps are, i literally said one spacific map that was said to be changed a while ago cause of how annoying it is and you take it to where not a single person was even thinking, do you think that map is balanced? Cause its not
---
pretty cool information thanks for sharing.  I wonder though,  could this possibly only be in spots that would not normally ever spawn a pallet?  So the camera angles aren't picking up on it?  I guess I will have to try and replicate later today when I get a fred
---
Should i run balanced landing and adrenaline
---
Bloodweb RNG seems to hate Killers a lot more than Survivors. Bet you have Unrelenting, Insidious, Monstrous Shrine and Spies though right?
---
I mostly play PS4 but when I play PC I'm way low rank and barely have any perks. It's a nightmare, so much less fun at lower ranks. Plus lots of killers that have intentionally de-ranked just to destroy a bunch of new people. Oof.
---
That mask looks like the creature with the mask from Spirited Away.
---
Bind your skill check button to your mouse. Makes them more precise, at least in my own experience.
---
😂 maybe you just need to learn how to play, I always use hooks near gens so that I can patrol at least 3 gens if BBQ doesn't pop, and I can be back on the hook within 5-10 seconds with a long blink or a chainsaw, hyper mobility + being within range while still patrolling gens is scum 😭😭
---
He is immune to spine chill in tier 1
---
Tier 1 Myers has immunity to all detection perks.
---
I dont think it activates when he's on tier 1 so that might be it
---
I play both there kiddo, wraith and momma meg, unlike you that probably plays doctor because you can’t find survivors
---
You’re throwing a tantrum about something that you could completely avoid happening and not listening to suggestions and calling survivors cheaters basically. I’m the immature one. K
---
Every bloodweb I get those perks
---
You done with your soap opera?
---
&gt; This literally just happened to me. I'm doing no addons Myers, just giving people good games instead of fast ones. 
---
&gt; This fucking David starts teabagging and looping me. So I go for his team, get 2 hooks and David &amp; his asshole claudette tbag and flashlight me. So I let them get the last gen. Missing my strikes then once that gen pops off they confidently start 360ing me and don’t even get off the gate lever. 3rd light goes off, I completely change gears, instant down gate prick. His teammate sprints away, I mind game him so easily cause he thought I was a baby!
---
Hook them both and bask in the toxic post game chat.
---
And I'm not required to say please and thank you or give tips. I'm still an asshole if I dont
---
It’s 100% bad luck. All you can do is keep grinding BP and wait for it to come up. In the meantime, try getting tier 1 perks out of the way. Tier 1 perks have the most likely chance of showing up, so eliminating will mean you’re more likely to get corrupt.
---
BUT I WANT CLAAAAAAAAIRE!!!
---
*RAAGESHSHEHSHS* 
---
Ada is cool too tho.
---
I mean you aren't wrong
---
So I have to buy unrelenting and monstrous shrine
---
This is the best I could make of it haha! After reading it again, I kind of forgot what he was trying to say.
---
It would be the same as freddy, if any locker tp should be a secondary power
---
She almost those sum bitches 😂
---
I would. Adrenaline will cancel out exhaustion from balancing landing
---
Ash's perks are pretty bad altogether, WoO is alright, Dance with me is great and Boil Over might be bad, but boy is it fun to play pinball with the killer.
---
Yeah, I agree.
---
Ok thanks
---
OMFG YES, it would make the killer more unique. Myers currently has that feature, so it would be a huge missed opportunity if they don't do it for the Demogorgon.
---
Because it’s heavily known as an anti tunneling perk but good killers are being punished by DS anyways for doing really good. That’s why they always say sarcastically, “guess I shouldn’t have been tunneling”
---
Name one.
---
My load out is now balanced landing, self care, adrenaline and spine chill
---
You don’t have to but it will make sure those perks don’t take away a slot in a future blood web
---
Why is his head so big?
---
4 days since the Scoops outfit announcement, and we've heard nothing from them since. 
---
I bet they're trying to fix some bugs before ptb is pushed out
---
Sounds good. Good luck surviving.
---
So you're resorting to the Ad Hominem fallacy instead of coming up with a good explanation of why I and other killers, should reward people for doing bad, other than, "dOn'T bE a dIcK." Because appearently, playing by the rules of a video game, and playing how I want, is being a dick. And if in your unreasonable mind, you think that somehow that is being a dick, then you shouldn't be playing team based video games.
---
Evil within 1 myers doesn't proc spine chill, I've been jumpscared by it a few times and started to use alert instead
---
I'm going to use Doc, I'm just not gonna go fucking HAM on the new players. I'll give hatch to the last survivor and let them run me around a bit.
---
No worries, it sometimes happens to be in worse mood
---
You should get a hobby instead of jerking off to your own comments on reddit
---
It would still be cool to have a killer be able to get inside lockers even to hide from survivors that are being toxic nerds XD Plus a great surprise to some survivors when he pops out of it .
---
Kate's perk "Dance with Me" makes for an incredibly powerful chase breaker especially when combined with Lithe.
---
You really expect killer mains to display proper grammar and punctuation?
---
Because she’s seven mentally
---
Buy demogorgon instead of hag. Seems to be a better hag
---
Actually quantum mechanics and hitboxes forbid this
---
*uck you, and your stroke cult
---
You could run the most meta build like Decisive, adrenaline, dead hard, borrowed time
---
Not even a close up? You can barely see her outfit
---
They should just have a random obsession each match even if there are no perks at play
---
YAY, SHRINE!
---
you are the enemy of people
---
I started playing again after ST announcement. I am shit tier and never see clown or plague, have only seen 1 doc, pig, Fredster.
---
I don't ever play Dwight without Q&amp;Q and Head On equipped
---
First thing I buy on a Bloodweb is the perk, ASAP.  If there's more than one, determine which would be best.  If if it's a perk I don't want, it's now out of the way, which means less perks in the pool for the web to choose from.
---
What I hate is that people will hunt you down to hurt you as much as possible, I went against a toxic swf group as level 1 wraith and they tracked my steam account and commented hateful things, it's disgusting!
---
Remember doing it on PC is different
---
This happened to me too. I was confused as shit! LOL! The only difference in my game was I could see my character as well.
---
Spell check and grammar lessons are your friend
---
I would also add tcm 2 because they reference it alot in descriptions
---
That’s because they can be dicks too, my point wasn’t “only killers can be dicks,” it was you, as he individual shouldn’t be a dick
---
i heard her go in the locker lol
---
Every 100h one miss occurs
---
Still recommends.
---
I don't see why you're being downvoted...
---
If they wait, it’ll overlap with the bloodhunt, causing way less testing. If they wait till after, then they’ll fail their dedicated servers deadline of September 21st.
---
Game was sooo much worse then lol
---
Lol.. Thanks
---
No word on the PTB, most of the BHVR staff are saying on twitter that they cant say when it will be. AS far as cost based on the fact this is the biggest DLC so far in terms of perks and characters i would guess between 10-12 dollars
---
Thank you for your advice
---
Say sike right now
---
Yeah, but it's a Hex perk so there's a 50/50 chance survivors will find it in the first minute of the match and take it away.
---
Don't tunnel and you don't have to worry about this simple, you said you dont care about playing nice why should survivors care if you don't like DS Head on combo either take the hit or move on to another survivor bc with that new Nancy perk more people are going to run head on with DS
---
If it's a Spirit with beads, I'm out. I couldnt care less about my rank, I just refuse to play such an anti-fun match when I can get into another one in 2 minutes.
---
Oh I didn't even realise, the Demogorgon has a shackled and chained cosmetic in this!
---
Why not just bring a Med kit instead of self care?
---
Sandbag then and do vines
---
Yare yare dipshit
---
The way he slid away behind the rock was terrifying.
---
That looks amazing
---
I need to get head on
---
Honestly id love it if they made the killer "Boogeyman" If you attempt to enter a locker while the killer is within, you get a jump scare on your screen then put on the shoulder to be carried to a hook.
---
I don’t even know how to respond to your dumbass
---
It is
---
Not here in forums
---
Yes, but he had a delectable steak sauce on it, plus steamed vegetables and a 1942 red wine with it.
---
Personally It depends on who I'm playing against.
---
If they were oblivious trying to be a dick then there is no way for a hatch.
---
If they were just playing even if they had an annoying build I'll give them the hatch if I'm nearby.
---
If they were fun to play against or other people DC'ed and I'm confident they won't try to struggle out I'll find the hatch for them.
---
Sadly new players almost always struggle when I look for the hatch for them so I usually won't try to bring them to the hatch for a second time. (Now that I think of it it might be for the best so they dont have to fight higher rank killers.)
---
Overall I don't think killers need to give the hatch but if they want to they can.
---
I myself use Adrenaline, Sprint Burst, We'll Make It, and Empathy(We're Gonna Live Forever). They're all pretty good perks IMO requires Meg and Claudette to be farmed though.
---
I dont think the corn is an issue, the walls having holes you can see through are though
---
Flemeth.
---
Photoshop master
---
She looks like a Disney character
---
Why would they do that...  most unfun stuff to play against both sides and they let new players have their first experience with them?
---
Oh my god I can hear it now. 
---
She saw everything
---
I don't expect them to care.  Its in the game run it,  it sure as hell isn't fair though. That's also very different from trying to have a god damn discussion about it but you know human courtesy aside you do you.
---
*Giggles in Prayer Beads*
---
You've figured out the solution? A true genius
---
Most likely with next chapter.
---
STEP 👏🏻 IT 👏🏻 UP 👏🏻
---
Billy is literally top 3 killers though
---
in the store there is a tab called shrine of secrets that allows you to buy teachable perks for iridescent shards. The current one resets in like a day or 2. But if you can level up enough to get 2000 then use that to buy barbecue and chili. it is a good perk for killers that can also double your bloodpoints which will ease the grind. There is also an event on the 5th that will increase bloodpoints so save your bloody party streamers, survivor puddings, escape cakes and whatnot. 
---
Generally speaking nurse, hillbilly, spirit, huntress, and plague are very good killers albeit some have a high skill cap. 2 of which are free. huntress comes in a free dlc. That dlc also gives a survivor, david king who is pretty good. or at least his dead hard is. His perk We're gonna live forever also eases the bloodpoint grind. Other than that most female survivors start with pretty good perks. I would say billy is a good killer to start with, easy and effective. I would avoid nurse spirit and maybe even hag as they can be difficult to use properly. hag has traps but is slow and needs them to be properly placed to end a chase. someone like trapper is faster and can chase as well as trap. hes good for beginners and has a decent skill cap with trap placements.
---
The only times I dc is if I’m being slugged and I don’t want to sit there for 55 years, or do to the legendary houdini juke
---
When you're Bill you have to say "quit fussin' and let me heal ya"
---
I love how I unhook my rank 15 friends and they always run away when they get unhooked. I always tell them that if anything happens, I’ll take the hit. But they are too paranoid.
---
15 minutes to do 3 gens, best ruin spot ever or rank 21?
---
Facts
---
15 minutes in total. Not just the last 3 gens. Rank 22
---
I agree completely.
---
Yeah. I’d doubt it, but we can always imagine.
---
When does the hatch spawn now?
---
What are the top meta survivor perks?
---
Tbh if the team is altruistic it's not even camping lol and I say this as a survivor main
---
Lit
---
1 mil no ready to drop. Slap the tooth-flower on a pit bull.
---
Holy thank you
---
I cannot remember the last time I faced a doctor or a clown
---
I said the same thing to my friend while we were watching stranger things
---
Can we get a trapper stepping in his own trap?
---
Burnt up pedo S tier ok sure bud
---
Back in the old day?? You have Shards, that's not old.
---
...but I do miss pink perks
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ Gib ATV... I mean SUMMON THE PTB ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ
---
Bruh, that was fixed months ago...
---
Fun fact: with the stacks that these give, the purple and green windstorms, you can move faster than the hillbilly’s chainsaw while cloaked.
---
You aren’t speedy, you ARE speed.
---
Do you play with your food sonic speed spirit?
---
If you Sprint, you leave scratch marks that the killer can see. They disappear after a bit. Some actions also cause noise notifications, such as failing a skill check or sprinting through a window.
---
Jelly!
---
I believe the ranking is based on whoever is hosting the SWF lobby. If friends get the game but don’t plan on buying DLC, I would suggest Hillbilly or Nurse as their first killer for their perks. If they do plan to get DLC, get Hag
---
&gt; The backstory isn't that similar between Evan and Jason
---
Replace Evan's dad with Evans mum and they basically have the same motivation
---
The fact that the devs specifically mentioned music in their "what are you most looking forward to" poll has raised my expectations.
---
BING BONG
---
Any meme with Aubrey Plaza in it is a top tier meme.
---
Lol right!
---
I'm still waiting for some slippers cosmetics. Wanna slap that dirty dirt with style.
---
As for survivors, David’s perk, were gonna live forever is great for getting blood points quickly
---
Wow, that scummy killer really got what was coming to her
---
Honestly didn't expect the demogorgon to get cosmetics at all, I'm happy they did give the demogorgon something but honestly it's kinda meh
---
A chain saw Is an incredibly versatile weapon
---
Fantastic, i will be more happy when i know the PTB release date.
---
I feel like Huntress should be D tier due to it being a deadly weapon both up close and at range.
---
I'd just let you go if I downed you there and saw lol
---
I totally agree that going after a farmed survivor is mean (and usually unnecessary, anyway; hook farmers are not great players in my experience). People should always try to play like their opponents are human beings with feelings. But giving people a fair shake is not the same as giving them a free win, that’s what I was disagreeing with.
---
It's not a problem.
---
&gt;Mathieu Cole
---
What the fuck else are you supposed to do when they have all the gens? let them escape?
---
Can't forget the demogorgon has chains on the body which confirms a cosmetic for him also
---
Lol.
---
Spirit is waifu. OP, u ever seen her with the skirt?
---
you aint wrong there
---
Your sketches are seriously amazing my dude, absolutely love them , you're very talented keep it up 👍
---
correct
---
Literally just had a P3 Ash run me for 3-4 gens, god it sucked.
---
Not likely. Then they'd have the new chapter and dedicated servers releasing at about the same time, that's a really bad idea.
---
Weird, they didnt fix it very well then lol, cause you can see through em pretty well, at least I can. It's easier looping on farm walls and shit than it is on other maps.
---
Delete
---
Protect the baby dweets!
---
You can't buy licensed killers with shards...
---
A survivor will break out of a carry if the killer drops them with 3/4 wiggle meter.
---
Do the mouth come off too?
---
Why
---
Was it a SWF team?
---
What the fuck is your flair. What brought you to create this monstrosity. Holy shit
---
Right? Imagine a single survivor saying gg if the killer did well
---
Honestly I'm pretty quick to give up chasing a survivor if they're being cocky because they're clearly in a comfortable position for looping there - probably 80% of the time I'll catch them off guard later and they'll be an easy down
---
Then they usually DC
---
the gif is literally of a survivor in the game
---
Enjoy your scummy play style while you still can. With each update the devs are adding measures to prevent hook camping and tunnelling. 
---
The only people who need to learn how to play are scums who camp and tunnel because let's face it, without those scummy tactics, you can't win the game. Benzine unlike killers who play fairly, you never had to home your skill and resort for the easy target who can't defend themselves.
---
I want a zombies chapter so bad imagine a kill that could place zombies bodies around and start controlling them and imagine Dempsie as a survivor
---
I love how people are already complaining that it's not the OG Nancy outfit, you fucks are so spoiled.
---
Ill join, everyone has to start somewhere and Im more then happy to help a new guy : )
---
No detection perks work on a Myers in EW1. You'll have to use your eyes.
---
&gt;No Mither
---
Iron Will is much better, it allows you to take 1 more hit in exchange for being able to get up from downed once per game, which is very situational.
---
noed has totems. end of story
---
There's a different between trying to salvage some kills, and playing like a dick.
---
How scary they are, according to what?  Their backstory, their in game abilities?
---
I mean, I don't think there's much scarier then having a teammate get hooked on the opposite side of the map, and then getting hit with a hatchet in the head.
---
This is helpful, thank you.
---
Back in the old days, exhaustion wasn't even a thing
---
How dream snares are still pretty strong and I. Mid chase  no one will stop and look at the pallets  the speed debuff from add ones are still pretty good as well
---
Its not even an issue, the fact that it has a timer balances it. Maybe you shouldn't tunnel and go for someone else.
---
I remember when the first ui update happened and I was like tf are all these symbols
---
Yeah, agreed. I'm gonna stick to his default if this is the only other cosmetic.
---
And of course... bloody Demogorgon. I can't wait for that.
---
Well, if you are telling me that a literally ghost that phase trough the map and can pass trough wall is less scary than literally a guy with a mask, you have some problems dude
---
For the hatch to appear on the map you have to complete gens equal to the number of survivors alive plus one. For example, if all four survivors are alive you have to complete all five gens for the hatch to appear. If only two survivors are alive you only have to finish three gens, etc. However, the hatch stays closed and can only be opened with a key until there is one survivor left. 
---
As for meta perks, I would say that a pretty standard build in higher ranks is adrenaline, decisive strike, borrowed time, and the exhaustion perk of your choice.
---
Yeah it’s how there putting the game onto the phone, because it obviously needs to be on the phone
---
Murder the baby Dweets, protect the baby Steves!
---
Hatch spawn is mainly the same.  When the survivors have finished one more generator than there are survivors left in the match the hatch will spawn.  It will not open until there is only one survivor left in the match.
---
The hatch has spawned if:
---
5 gens completed and 4 survivors alive
---
4 gens completed and 3 survivors alive
---
3 gens completed and 2 survivors alive
---
1 survivor alive
---
Well well well if it isn’t an invisible cunt
---
I can't wait for this meme to die it's so fucking stupid
---
Adrenaline is top of the list for metaperks.  Sprintburst or dead hard is probably second imo.
---
Well, yes. 
---
The chainsaw sprinting is why he's good
---
I'm confused what is happening. What do you mean if "if the camera not reacting to it"
---
I was hoping you would show whatever test you're doing here with a real pallet too
---
Just got to hang in there for a little bit longer. Once dedicated servers will come, d/c'ing will have a time penalty before you can play again.
---
Rage quit to deny a killer the hook or whatever reason? Enjoy what I assume is going to be a 10 or 30 minute time out.

I definitely hope it's more then that maybe chains around the mouth? I'll still buy it though as it still looks great

It may just me because I know Amanda from the movies but she should be In D tier

Oh for sure! I never expect to be given a free escape, nor do I generally even care if I escape or not, as long as it’s a fun round. But seems a lot of people lately play this game as if they are going against bots instead of real people.

---
swf rank abuse
---
With real pallets, the camera will auto adjust it's angle to see the survivor model rather than just staring straight into the pallet like in the video.
---
Can you ACTUALLY be reported (and get in trouble) for being a friendly killer when you just want to play around? I do this constantly. I will continue to do this at my leisure. Just had 2 dickweeds report a friendly killer while I was on survivor so I reported them for threatening to make false reports :P because 2 can play that game.   
---
But is it actually against the rules to play how you want?
---
i think they couldve chosen better outfits but it still looks really nice
---
To be fair, rank 19/20 players, assuming not because of rank reset, have a lot less knowledge about the game than rank 16s so it kinda balances things. By rank 16 you know your general objective, have some perks you like using, and are getting familiar with maps.
---
You're right, he's an infallible god who can never be wrong about anything in this game that may or may not affect his content creation!

---
Shotgun Nancy! hell ya
---
As a new player, I feel more comfortable playing as survivor. I'm afraid of looking really dumb as a killer. :B
---
Depending on how they do it, they can actually keep their BP and any items they had.  It's a bit of a travesty but I'm hoping that loophole gets fixed as well
---
Yeah but BHVR takes so long to do anything, I doubt you'll catch a ban.
---
Even if you take an average of their ranks it's still pretty far from 13
---
Why? It’s better for it to be out in the open if it’s a bug then it can get fixed and not abused if it’s intended then everyone has the right to know besides even if a survivor knows a pallet is fake it’s very unlikely to help them in a chase so...
---
Oh damn
---
I'm playing the game how I want, and so are survivors . You can't tell me how to enjoy myself. If I want to bring iridescent addons and an ebony Mori, I'll do that. If I want to run just BBQ and play a farming round I'll do that. I'm not going to conform to how someone else wants me to play.

Do I have to use all three perks because if so I’d run David without no mither but if not give me my girl Kate
---
It's only really hide and seek for entry level survivors and killers.  The more you play and rank up the closer the game becomes to a time management racing game.
---
probably calculates whatever is in the middle between highest and lowest
---
It did for me last week in a kill your friends lobby.
---
NO FACE AS A KILLER CONFIRMED!
---
In my many, many years of playing online games, I've learned that probably 15% of new players actually read anything or even watch videos before they start playing a game. Maybe 5% read/play tutorials or watch "how to" videos.
---
The devs have said that 2 kills and 2 escapes is an ideal match, so depipping as killer because 2 escaped is pretty garbage imo
---
They hate him because most Wraith players are campers at low rank.
---
I honestly don’t think these punishments are gonna change anything, unfortunately. People mostly DC out of frustration, a bad game, whatever. It’s basically just people being tilted from last games, but keep playing anyway hence they end up dcing.
---
That's very helpful
---
*Guffaws in Tombstone/Fragrant*
---
Devs be like:  
---
#No.
---
That reminds me when I was letting a friend play and he was on the doctor map he was hiding in some tall grass and happened to turn around to see a Micheal standing there stalking I jumped so fast the couch fell back
---
I just want a [stun baton](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/redfaction/images/7/7c/Baton.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20110215012912) for Doctor.
---
It's not really worth it for killers, IMO because you have to unlock all your perks again and the bonus to add on rarity is negligible for survivors.
---
Someone liking BHVR? This is very rare
---
Now that you mention it I downed two survivors every game on that map as Freddy because they all got stuck on it
---
Were you guys SWF? 
---
Either way, it’s still KINDA balanced(obviously all rank 16 would be best lol)
---
"yes"
---
If you want to be obsession, i will show you the lengths of the onsession.
---
who gives you the right to comment on people mistakes? literaly no one ever tried, and you just come here, lol appart from jokes im not that angry salt, sorry english is not my second language
---
Remember when rapper could trap under hooks
---
This is honestly hilarious, I can smell the rank 12-13 radiating off of your comments, if staying within responding distance of a hook while also playing for gens is scummy you really don't know the game at all.
---
In your mind I'm guessing killers would hook someone, see a Claudette crouched nearby or see nobody far away with BBQ, and immidiately run/blink/chainsaw to the farthest corner of the map, wait for the unhook, count to 45, and then start patrolling gens after they're full healed?
---
You know killers lose points/can actually not pip if people heal right? 
---
Tunnelling isn't a great strat when they could have DS either, you lose 4 or 7% IIRC if they escape grasp.
---
God what a life you must lead if you have this outlook
---
Jane is hot
---
no, i was by myself
---
but i was facing an actual decent killer with teammates who messed up a skill check every two seconds
---
Level 42 at the momment
---
Fancy Nancy
---
Lol ya see and now that kind of sounds like it falls into the latter exception territory of a swf actin' a fool.  Sounds like the slug was necessary if they literally took away your ability to hook them.  You could wait for one to respawn or you could do what I do in that situation.  They want to be picked up so I'll slowly start taking a few steps back in a different direction to see if I can get them to follow me.  The idea is to see if I can get them to follow me closer to another hook that is up.  If not they're free to bleed in the dirt lol.  Sounds like you did absolutely nothing wrong.  They kinda asked for this with the sabos.
---
Doctor is not scary. He's terrifying. He doesn't cause fear, he causes terror. His ability makes the aura around him a true terror radius. You know you can't hide from him, and you not only know damn well he's coming for you, but also the exact time he has found you. Sometimes he just gives the illusion of terror, that's when he's scary.
---
Gotta get those self care points over 40 seconds of standing in a corner not doing gens.
---
Considering you can only put fake pallets in spots where a normal pallet *can* spawn, I'd say probably not
---
Isn't a DS a crutch perk?
---
Is this only on steam?
---
Everytime a pallet is real has camera collision
---
Not everytime a pallet is fake has camera collision
---
What i'm trying to say is that sometimes a fake pallet has camera collision so don't forcibly trust it
---
nurse in C? wot? teleportation and flying shit doesn't get you?
---
Don't forget permanent NOED, original facecamping, traps blocking the hook, and Wraith bots.
---
Still appalled they'd do business with Koch.
---
First, I agree with /u/Table5614.  Two dead, killer should at least be safe, if not pip up.
---
Second, how do you balance this with SWF?  When a high rank player jumps in with a noob.  Do they get matched to a HR or LR game (High Rank or Low Rank).
---
Third, rank reset isn't needed, even now.  It's counter-productive.  HR players get set to a LR, and crap all over actual LR players.
---
Here's what I think needs to happen.
---
New game modes.  Competitive, and Casual.  No rank system in Casual.  In Competitive, you have SWF, Survivor Solo, Killer.  Casual has the same three, plus KYF.
---
Competitive offers actual rewards, possibly in the form of Auric Cells, and resets monthly.  This gives people a real reason to care about rank.
---
Casual is just that.  Have fun.  You can still earn BP, except for KYF, but there's no rank changes at the end of it.
---
More than it is easy to dodge it will probably just end up being like Leatherface, where there has to be NOTHING around you in order to pull it off successfully.  
---
Maybe he will be fun to play and even be pretty decent, but I'm pretty underwhelmed.
---
Ultimately I need to play him and I need to see his add-ons.
---
Maybe I just have no faith in this community, but if they don’t dc, they’re gonna find another way to be scummy. I hope you’re right, though.
---
I would love for it to work with Self-Care but it would require a pretty major overhaul of the perk. Back when it came out on live servers I math'd it out and realize you'd need to have it on a 20 token system instead of 4. Quick copy/paste job but here  goes:
---
&gt;* You start the Trial with a -20% progression penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors.
---
&gt; * For every successful Skill Check completed while healing another Survivor, you receive 4 Tokens for a maximum of 12/16/20 Tokens. For every successful Skill Check completed while healing yourself, you receive 1 token instead.
---
&gt;* Each Token grants you a +5% bonus progression for a successful Skill Check while healing Survivors. This bonus is reduced to 1.25% bonus progression per token while healing yourself.
---
&gt;* Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using Autodidact.
---
&gt;* Autodidact is not active when using a Med-Kit to heal.
---
Basically, keeping it the same for healing others, but further penalizing Self-Care but allowing it to slowly build up power.
---
Slugging is a very valid strategy and there is nothing toxic about it imo.
---
Camping a slugged body is toxic but if they sabotaged your hooks they asked for it.
---
Maybe
---
Fun to play, I don’t like going against him.
---
When I first saw this, it looks like one of the oozes from resident evil revelations.
---
Dizaster256
---
When hes not hunting or killing people, he is actually Dwight's personal gimp.
---
I don't bother because they're already going to be adding dedicated servers and new matchmaking, so any input I give now is going to be outdated immediately, and I've never ever seen an endgame screencap (and we've all seen A LOT of them on the sub, lol) that had a rating filled in.
---
Me on the rare occasion that I see Claudette's ass
---
Ah yes the basement Bubba.
---
Where did they go
---
BBQ had limited use. You must be dumbass thinking that someone is nearby just because you can't see them. They could be in lockers, behind a gen, or have anti Asia reading perk. 
---
Yeah what life you must lead. If you take the easy way out in game, I can see you do the same thing in life.
---
I’m on PS4 and so far it’s been all over the place. Recently got back in to the game a few weeks ago and am hovering around rank 8 and 9. I’m sure it will all change as soon as I hit red ranks.
---
insidious Bubba
---
Ngl Id like a speedo clown skin
---
Puts outdoor security camera with chewed pen
---
They’ll learn to fear the basement here soon.
---
I'm running this with Fire Up for that extra oomph, love bulldozing through pallets.
---
The only thing that scares me about the Doctor is that perverted giggling he does when he gets stunned.
---
I was swf last night and 3 of us slammed a gen in the first 30 sec and the doctor dc’ed. He called us toxic.
---
Yeah, we’re toxic for DOING THE FUCKING OBJECTIVE.
---
Straight from the official DBD discord.
---
F in the chat for people who woke up early today thinking PTB was gonna launch today.
---
Tbh it "might" have been someone who's been on a hiatus for multiple rank resets... I doubt with the context but it's not impossible
---
This is honestly my new favorite thing, shitty salty survivors that don't understand that a killers game objective is to kill, not to let them get unhooked and healed every time and then kindly open the gates lmfao
---
I almost wish they waited another week to reveal anything, then
---
We'll probably see a surge of people suiciding on the hook for sure. But with the major "oomph" of d/c'ing effectively neutered, many people will lose the "FUCK YOU, I'M LEAVING ON MY OWN TERMS AND SCREWING YOU OUT OF POINTS/HOOK PERKS" feeling of rage quitting. Even if it never really made much sense just the knowledge that you're leaving behind a hookable husk means your d/c now only fully benefits  the killer instead of depriving them of anything.
---
Thanks for the info &lt;3
---
&gt; First, I agree with /u/Table5614. Two dead, killer should at least be safe, if not pip up.
---
In my opinion 2 kills is just too easy to get. Keep in mind the objective of this "rework" is to avoid the situation where ranking up is way too easy (which is currently the case). You can achieve 2 kills quite easily if you play in a scummy way. Tunnel 1 guy and then camp 1 guy at the end.
---
&gt; Second, how do you balance this with SWF? When a high rank player jumps in with a noob. Do they get matched to a HR or LR game (High Rank or Low Rank).
---
It should be the average of all survivors ranks = killer rank
---
&gt; Third, rank reset isn't needed, even now. It's counter-productive. HR players get set to a LR, and crap all over actual LR players.
---
Rank reset is garbage but the reason they do it now is that everyone decent would end up in red ranks with their current garbage system. But overall i agree with your point. I think with my system reset would be totally unnecessary.
---
&gt; New game modes. Competitive, and Casual. No rank system in Casual. In Competitive, you have SWF, Survivor Solo, Killer. Casual has the same three, plus KYF.
---
Competitive offers actual rewards, possibly in the form of Auric Cells, and resets monthly. This gives people a real reason to care about rank.
---
Casual is just that. Have fun. You can still earn BP, except for KYF, but there's no rank changes at the end of it.
---
I don't see how this fix the issue of emblem system not working properly.
---
Next week has a bloodhunt doesn't it? Releasing it then would be illogical so I guess it's 2+ weeks away still.
---
Not in the same sense as DS. DS is honestly not even an anti tunneling perk like people say, you use it and stun the killer for 4 seconds to get to another tile and the killer still tunnels you after (then cry about it still needing a nerf). A good killer slugs you or knows you have DS so they tank it and rotate 
---
Spine Chill makes people way to comfortable when using the perk. You can tell when the killer is definitely coming your way and continue to do what you’re doing. But when you take it off or play with a character that doesn’t have it you feel naked. You can’t be sure when the killer is coming for you, you stop what you’re doing when you hear the terror radius and prepare for a chase when they could just be patrolling somewhere near or chasing someone else. If you’ve been using SC the whole time/ majority of the time you’ve been playing this game then sorry but it’s a crutch for you. And there are much better options than Spine Chill.
---
Are you CRAZY!!!  This isn't the corner of the map!  Meet me in the corner of the map 25 wasted seconds from now.
---
Same but i try to be discreet, else they might not pick you up
---
A good tactic is to “fake loop”, run into a wall as if you panicked but secretly have this in your plan
---
Otz is waaaaaay better for learning, monto and noob are mote fun
---
Thank you very much, with the second one i was trying out the third option and it seemed to work like 90% of the time but wasnt sure if it was the best one
---
Decisive is made for tunneling killers...
---
This needed to be said, thank you
---
Oh that's interesting lol, I just do it for fun/tradition.
---
I've done it like 8 or 9 times.  Most recently against a Leatherface on Coldwind who had literally no comprehension of how to combat looping.  I was essentially invincible against an opponent that didn't know how to play killer yet so I waited at the exit gate then ran to the nearest hook in front of him and pointed at it to be Sacrificed.
---
I always liked teleporting in games so obviously nurse
---
gimme that thick greasy flab mmmmm
---
Newerish player here wondering about the iridescent shards. I’m player level 16 and have 1,765 shards and I’ve read that BBQ&amp;Chilli is a must have perk and is in the SoS currently. Will I be able to get to the 2K shards before the store refreshes?
---
Not any difference worth the bloodpoints. Only prestige if you like the bloody clothes or you have more bloodpoints than you know what to do with.
---
I fail to see why tunneling is a bad idea especially if there are only 2 survivors left.
---
When you realize it's omega blink nurse.
---
I'm console and sit around the green to purple ranks and I can't remember the last nurse, huntress, clown or doctor I have seen.
---
Lol. One day you'll learn how the game works man it's okay! We are all noobs at everything once so I won't hold it against you :). One day you'll crack rank 10 or 15 and you'll play for real, maybe one day you'll even try killer and see what it's like at non-low ranks where pipping is difficult. But yet again, it's okay that you're new and you don't get how the game works, I'm also assuming English isn't your first language, because of the way you've been talking and the difficulty you've had in spelling and the amount of grammatical errors in most of your comments, so I have to give you big props for being able to talk for this long in a language that MUST be exhausting for an obvious beginner! But hey, once more, everyone starts somewhere and you'll get good at something one day, I beleiev in you :)
---
Nobody knows.
---
Huntress: UwU
---
Susie: ):
---
No, no. No camping or tunneling, I agree with that. But I dislike the idea that killers are obligated to let survivors escape. There's no obligation, they're players too trying to get the best score possible. Sorry but if someone DCs, then unless I happen to be feeling particularly philanthropic, then that's the survivors' problem. Why should it become my problem? Why can't the survivors be the ones who suffer, why should it be the killer who has to compromise in that situation?
---
God damn do I want to rip on you for this but I kinda get it.  Prayer Beads is cancer.
---
Personally no, some killers will just wait for DS timer to go down, even if that means waiting a whole minute.
---
I just run We'll make it alongside BT whichever way, you give a fast heal for a little while or you give an extra hit to your teammate.
---
Then just use Balanced landing and something else, like Prove thyself or adrenaline
---
I'm going to take a guess and say that Demo skin is supposed to be based on one captured by the Russians in S3.

[༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ SUMMON THE PTB ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ](/intensifies)
---
Everyone throws shade at leatherface for camping with insidious meanwhile you got the wraith players avoiding any flack.
---
Maybe it's just me, but i can never get much done with wraith, usually if i play him it's just to give my friends a good laugh yelling "MORE COWBELL!" and uncloaking behind them, i don't even dare touch him in public games because I usually only get one or two kills and still get post game hate-mail for body blocking when in reality I accidentally ran into them and said to myself "ope, sorry there, pardon me" in a Canadian accent.
---
Most of the times, I get why the matchmaking is lopsided. There is at least one survivor with a rank somewhat close to the killers rank. 
---
But this.... this is just mean.
---
Wow you actually suck as a person, its a joke bro dont be so fragile about ur masculinity
---
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ OLIOLIOLIOLIOOOOOO ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

This is like your 6th one of these today. They've been done before. They're not original/funny.
---
It's literally the only thing I dc against. Anybody who picks that knows fully well what they're doing. I only have a handful of hours to game on an average night and dont want to waste the free time i have on a match like that, I'd rather just get into the next one. I'm not even trying to bash on people that pick it, I just wont play against it. Its simply not fun, and fun is the entire reason I play games in the first place
---
What a Dwight?
---
I agree with them not being entitled to escapes but the language in your comment came off as the textbook fuck you I'm here to have fun my way Survivors unapologetic camper response.  Glad to hear this isn't the case because those players ruin the community on killer side.
---
Yeah, it is a weird head space.  I'll try the first few and see if I can forget it but I'm not sure if i can.
---
Oh boo hoo. It's pathetic how some killer mains have the power role but keep acting like victim.
---
I see you're one of those annoying people who pick at inane things to demonstrate your superiority only for people to realise what a douche you are. 
---
I know why you play killer. You have all the narcissistic personality type that no one else likes. Being alone is your default state.
---
Why were Pink perks removed in the first place?
---
This should work even with head on on their side
---
I used to do it to Prework Frank's Mix Tape Legion.  So I get it.
---
Same for me. But I finally got it after 20 bloodwebs
---
It feels like there is no in between when it comes to altruism and my team. Either someone gets hooked and they're almost guaranteed to get to struggle phase because apparently one life is all we need in this game. 
---
Or, they're rushing to save the day like getting the unhook is the only way to keep playing the rest of the game. If it's against a Bubba or Doctor, they just stick around even longer.
---
EASY COUNTER TO DECISIVE...don’t tunnel
---
\&gt;Probably
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood

Do bones, especially next patch with Inner Strength.

You complete idiot lol, it was in response to someone saying killers should only run their specific perks. I asked if he felt the same about survivors lol or if he was only whining about killers. Nice try though. You either did the most cursory glance ever, or you're intentionally leaving out what my comment was in response to. Either an idiot, or dishonest. Grats lol

As below comments said, I thought it'd be a waste of the adrenaline boost. The other surv was fine as well, all 4 of us ended up making it out
---
Dude those are some impressive words and you even ***formatted it*** I'm honestly impressed!
---
To purchase
---
Balance landing/dead hard - decisive strike - adrenaline -  borrowed time
---
I didn't intend it that way, my response was in response to someone mainly talking about expecting killers to let people go, not just a general perspective.
---
Choosing to exploit a situation doesn't mean it's not on the player for taking advantage of it.  Something existing in game doesn't give us free reign to exploit it.  Why do you think they banned for Infinite Mend Legion?  It was in the game but it was wrong and not intended for the game so they placed the blame and rightfully so on the cheating babydick players you seem to look up to for choosing to take advantage of it.
---
How scary they are in appearance, what they do in game, or what they do “irl”?  Because I gotta say, I’d MUCH rather be choked and then quickly and efficiently impaled by Myers than get put in an unwinable deathtrap by Pig or be drugged, mutilated, and raped by Clown over several days.
---
I disagree, if anything it points to the opposite. Gays love playing as female characters  😂
---
Maybe it's a new feature...
---
For the base game not all the dlc’s
---
I hope they addons arent lame like ghostfaces addons
---
Me:  *crouches behind tree, mere feet away from the killer who is looking for me*
---
DBD:  **SURPRISE, BITCH!  YOU JUST LAGGED AND ARE NOW IN FRONT OF THE KILLER**
---
Thing is, I had a feeling it was going to be 1 week instead. Releasing the chapter during the double bp event would’ve been perfect.
---
Haha one day when you learn to read properly you'll re-read my comments and see that BBQ was only one example I listed, you can't honestly expect me to type out ever motivation to check on hooks? Haha. 
---
And are you denying that frequent spelling and grammar mistakes are a sign that someone might be learning the language? Seems kind of rude if you ask md
---
Downvoting you and I’m not a salty killer or a killer main at all; I just think you’re wrong. There’s plenty of ways they could’ve avoided the killer, like staying in the basement for a bit and trying to juke him, or not being in that situation at all by just picking a better time to hook; if the huntress is that close to hook and a survivor still actively chooses to unhook someone, then part of the blame lies at the rescuer’s feet, not the killer’s.
---
Ds is a very commenly used perk and more experienced killer will aways wait a minute after an unhook
---
I love how you can pick out the toxic survivors, who assume me not allowing them to win automatically means I camp and tunnel lol.
---
If you're in my line of sight, I'm going to chase you. Now, I typically won't spend more than 30 seconds on a chase, because that allows the other survivors to get gens. But me chasing you when I spotted you is the point of the game.
---
Just like me circling around towards an unhooked survivor isn't camping; camping is me sitting at the hook, or circling the hook so your teammates can't get you down. Heading towards someone who was unhooked, or turning around when someone unhook you after I've taken ten steps away isn't camping lol.
---
This is why I have a feeling the PTB will still release this week.
---
The ironic thing is this would have been bannable if done identically with any other killer but Pig.  The traps death timer is the loophole around this cheating bullshit he did to cheese that dude to death.  Unfortunate.
---
Youre mom
---
For the second one, you can just crash the chainsaw into the locker door. Survivors will be downed by the tantrum swings.
---
Support
---
Dying Light?
---
Nah plenty of killer mains think you're an embarrassment too for pulling this I'm sure.
---
Blasphemy!! Jonathan is survivor material and the perks seem more lore oriented to him.
---
I feel like I cant play billy with all these baby survivors, every game ends within 1 minute with 5 gens left
---
I had a claudette do it once, when I was fumbling around my first game as ghost face. I thanked her for it, but I didn't expect her to do it because I sucked.
---
Again, my point wasn't that you can't or shouldn't do these things. It's that I'm not obligated to.
---
Looks like deformity caused by fire to me, idk
---
Yeah that's just dumb, staying in the basement and trying to juke - juking a killer is pretty damn difficult and even if you do the killer easily has enough time to catch up with you. 
---
The other survivor chose to unhook him at that point in time, how could he have chosen to get unhooked when it's someone else's decision if he gets unhooked or not. Are you saying one survivor should be punished for another survivors actions? That's just dumb and that's what I'm trying to say is scummy - Spoken as someone who plays a good amount of killer
---
Thats what i was doing but got90% success rate as sometimes i wouldnt down them nor catch them
---
You replied to the wrong comment my dude.  That comment was not intended for you.  Look again.
---
I also hate.

Golden Ace main here. I feel like it does make me better when I wear better cosmetics.
---
i wish if you stared at them for a similar time as it takes to reveal ghost face, they'd glimmer like the old asleep affect, or glitch like doctors, that way awake survivors can help asleep ones by clearing them
---
I'm guessing 10$
---
Absolutely great idea, shame it won't be implemented in time for the Stranger Things crowd to be scared off due to the wonky rank reset system
---
Every god damn time
---
Which are mine if I can down you. I don't care if it's ten blood points; I don't expect survivors to give up their blood points for me, why am I expected to give them up for them?
---
I feel your pain.
---
And four man decisive Insta-strikes
---
Damn, i guess the internet strangers really owned me with their "downvote the non-circlejerk comment" strategy.
---
I’ve always rated matches without even thinking about it, I didn’t realize no one else does it
---
Judging from your comments, yeah. 
---
Or they're just lazy and not nitpicker?  
---
You are definitely someone who thinks that their first thought is the correct answer. Kind of rude? Lool. Only if you have stick up your ass and racist too.
---
For sure. Hardest part now is finding the match
---
downvoted for an opinion and i oop
---
You leave my bing bong alone.
---
the dlc achievements and the base game have different achievements. To get the platinum you just need the base game ones.
---
He is the popular guy after all.
---
Sounds good and I agree with that.  Survivors should almost never expect a free escape.  The lone exception for me is when it was never a game because 2 dudes dc'd at the very start leaving it a 2 man 5 gen game.  I'd have to take a shower personally after 4k'ing that lobby but short of that bullshit scenario survivors should be grateful if a hatch is given but never expecting of it.  Dealers choice to the killer every game.
---
Matchmaking is still like this after 11:00 PM for me.
---
Gimpogorgan.
---
Going to backpedal a bit here.
---
Let's establish objectives first.
---
Killers should be:  
---
Chasing survivors  
---
Hitting survivors  
---
Hooking survivors  
---
Sacrificing survivors  
---
Killing survivors  
---
Preventing generators from completing  
---
Now, let's assume a perfect game is 12 Hooks, which is 4 sacrifices, probably 24 M1 hits, and no gens done.  This is two pips.  At what point does this drop to one pip?  It's not as simple as he only got X sacrifices, therefore he gets this many pips.  Also, how does killing a survivor outright via Mori, Tombstone, etc affect the ranking?
---
Ok? Yes, the game is difficult. Sorry if that’s a problem for you, but they had an escape route - and no, I’m not trying to say it’s the hooked survivor’s fault; I said it was the rescuer’s fault. You’re trying to say the killer got what he deserved, but not the rescuer? He actively made the decision to unhook while killer was nearby; that’s either a huge mistake or a dick move on his part.
---
In that case, get ready to tap the basic attack button or locker grab button as soon as the tantrum is over.
---
Two instaheals
---
I'm impressed you still got 15k bloodpoints. When I play killers I never played before I get like max 10k and those are people of the same rank. I would say you did good.
---
You can do two insta-heals?  FML.
---
and "entity always gets it's way"
---
Demogorgon is just a predator. It hunts to eat. So I doubt it needed coaxing.
---
No one knows but from what I’ve seen
---
Licensed dlc are $7 and others are $5
---
I don't understand why he's being downvoted just because he said he's not gay
---
It’s still nowhere near as bad as it used to be. I used to get 1-4 rank survivors as a lvl 20 killer!
---
Just as Survivors aren't entitled to a safe unhook, you aren't entitled to downing a Survivor after they're unhooked. Anti-tunneling perks are provided as counter play to the strategy of tunneling. That's the definition of balance: play and counter play. They counter your strat with a perk, now your job is to respond with a counter play of your own, of which there are many. If you realize they have DS, trade targets. Create pressure elsewhere. If you're not willing to adapt against counter play, you're going to struggle.
---
I haven't lol. I take my losses -whether survivor or killer -like a big girl, and move on. I am good at a small group of killers -Michael, Hag, Huntress, Legion. I've had games where survivors are literally running in circles around me as spirit or doc because I have no idea what I'm doing.
---
I've had games where killers legit camp, circling the hook to make sure I can't get unhooked. I don't suicide on the hook, and I don't DC. Mostly because if a killer is stupid enough to sit by me on a hook, my team can -in theory, anyways- get at least two gens done if I run the full sacrifice.
---
Leaving when you're doing poorly is just being a bitch ass baby lol.
---
Well i ran there injured while getting chased, killer just bodyblocled me for a while and downed me :D
---
thats Reddit for ya
---
That fog looks so much better than the current one we have.
---
Yeah it's still among the best survivor perks in game even after the rework.  It just doesn't feel like cheese anymore since the old one was broken and now killers have to literally choose to eat D Strikes.  I bring it every game to punish trash players that hardcamp and hardtunnel off hook.
---
Dev build?
---
Put bear traps on head is two above putting them in the ground? Big machete gets Trapper nothing compared to pig’s little knife?
---
Myers DLC only has 1 survivor though.
---
You're yet to attack my actual points by the way, all you've said to actually argue anything is "BBQ isn't reliable omegalul"
---
ACE! LOOK OUT! THE HUNTRESS IS BEHIND YOU! OH NO HE CANT HEAR US!
---
This is most online games in a nutshell. Do you have an actual question or do you just want to rant, cause that’s Wednesday’s thread.
---
I wasnt justifying leaving. I was saying that being so relentless against a team that had someone leave is kind of overkill considering if you leave, the entire game ends
---
Yeah the key you get after buying it only works for steam.
---
I thought this is what the Demogorgon would do... I assumed he would be able to turn a locker into a portal (up to 5) and then use them to teleport around the map. 
---
Would have been cooler to see wall portals, but putting portals literally anywhere is cool too
---
Yeah he does but liscenced DLCs tend to be the same price so it should be the same.
---
I have games where i dominate so hard the game literally is over after 5 minutes. Dominating too hard shouldn't cause depipping.
---
How did u manage to stay alive for 5 gens? I usually get downed after 2 or so. What perks?
---
Thanks for telling me, I'm on ps4 so this doesn't really work for me
---
I like running Iron Maiden on Leatherface just for the #2 scenario.  It doesn't always happen, but when it does it makes me laugh every time.
---
I play doctor all the time and I don't know why people always complain about a "squadette."

It's not reliable. You think someone being nearby is the reason why you don't get any reading but I've told you there are other reasons why it doesn't proc.
---
I literally can't play without spine chill, definitely my favourite survivor perk
---
Woah there cowboy
---
I blame the mains for pretty much all of it.  Those that don't play both sides heavily often become entrenched in that sides issues and lose all sense of empathy and objectivity when looking at anything from the other sides.  If more people played both sides seriously toxicity would definitely still exist (some people just want to watch the world burn) but wouldn't be nearly as developed as it is in our community.
---
Hag is the scariest killer imo.
---
So again... I'm supposed to let yall win because one of your teammates left, and killers can leave with impunity.
---
Oh I'm sorry, not 'let you win' but... chase less? Let you have gens? Not hook? What exactly do you think I'm supposed to do that doesn't hand you win, because a member of your team left?
---
if i chased someone for 4 gens i'd do the same thing. They are clearly way too good to leave alone
---
Nancy have way better perks than steve tho
---
Alright, I will do that in the future any other time i have a game like this, thank you for the suggestion. I just felt so salty I needed to post this somewhere and didn’t think about it rationally, thank you to you (and everyone else’s) who called me out in my bullshit thinking.

Oh ok I have an Xbox so and we just have all the achievements right there

None of this was really relevant to my comment.
---
This could be said the other way around equally.
---
Well each character in a dlc cost 4$ and considering a whole chapter has 2 characters it's 8$ so throw in another character and you get a 12$ chapter
---
look it’s the guy who draws the dbd memes

They really didn't have a viable escape route did they, they had a near impossible one that even skilled players would need to get lucky with. Your obviously not reading my comment either, I'm saying that the killer going straight for the person that didn't have a proper chance rather than the person that got him in that situation is the dick move in this situation
---
You're still ignoring the other ways to tell/literally seeing people/scratches.
---
Anyways I'm done filling this comment section with spam, if you want to talk about it/try to understand, feel free to dm Jaden#1269 on discord.
---
When does the blood hunt start friendo?
---
Stealth is rarely effective against good killers, doesn’t matter much about the cosmetics imo.
---
Member them saying servers in summer? Ye I member
---
when you have chainsaw ready and the survivor jumps into locker hit the locker with your chainsaw if survivor goes out he is dead(the dance bubba does after bumping into an object is brutal) if he doesnt you can pull him out
---
Not even that saying that. I give the last person alive the hatch if they had someone leave early on. Im not going to go full sweat in a team that literally has a worse chance of winning now because of what some random stranger did. It's a game balanced around 4 people, if 1 leaves that automatically puts the remaining 3 at a disadvantage. 1 person getting out isnt "handing over a win" when you still rank up, still get more blood points than survivors do, and still walk away with 3/4 of the lobby dead. 1 person surviving out of 4 isnt considered a successful trial for survivors
---
What is the endurance effect?
---
Wow I can't believe Pig is asserting her dominance over all of us in the subreddit
---
wHy Is ThE cOmMuNiTy So ToXiC?!

There's probably technical issues with that

Thank you kind Sir, you saved me a confused google search! :D
---
It takes so long to grind out 36 different characters to get all perks let alone if you wanna Prestige 3 them all. I will gladly farm for a few days every 3-4 months if it means I can finally have a fully loaded character to play around with builds on.
---
*Hilarious
---
I would say, with a pretty high amount of confidence, that no one has been banned for farming.
---
Congrats, this is genuinely the worst I have ever seen
---
What's funny is that they didnt really feel like red ranks, they were decently boosted ngl
---
(Sorry for the delay, I just got outta work)

So In your {professional} opinion, there’s no hard and fast rule—however, a general rule of thumb would be puke and break them if time allows, but otherwise puke then start a’smackin?

Isn't the Halloween chapter based off the first film and first film only?

You should look at rule no. 2 above.

Disconnects will be punished with dedicated servers coming out end of summer.
---
Facecamping can be countered by some perks and survivors completing objectives.
---
NOED is part of the game, like it or not.
---
No one can say why people go AFK in a particular instance.
---
Hi Nea main here. I’m not toxic I don’t wear annoying bright clothing but I do look fabulous
---
I kinda feel they will  do a very short PTB  considering well the bloodhunt is gonna happen soon so if they do a week long one the timing of the bloodhunt would end close to release of the dlc. If they keep the regular PTB time(and reveal the PTB next week) which is 2 weeks I believe they really should've just announced it later
---
Pretty much just getting hit and taking no damage.
---
lore is out the window....its a free for all celebrity mashup horror game
---
Thank you, I appreciate it!
---
You're the same rank or higher than 3 of the members.  There is one player higher ranked for you.  This isn't a post.

The killers i always assumed were their own rule but still fair

I guess that's where the difference lies, once I hit higher ranks and realized theres jack shit for a reason to do so I stopped caring about my rank entirely

Why would you lie about being 12....?
---
Spoiler tag dude
---
I just disagree then. It’s a ‘dick move’ in the same way that it’d be a ‘dick move’ to do generators as a survivor; you wanna accomplish your objectives. A killer’s objective is to get as many kills as he or she can, so if you want to play the game properly, you’re going to kill people when you get the chance. If that isn’t something that a survivor can handle, they need to get used to it. You’ll die a lot, you’ll survive a lot, and the killers aren’t ‘dicks’ for killing you if you give them the chance.
---
Camping on the first hook, though, I’d say is a dick move, considering you’re just making the game boring for yourself and the survivor.
---
Survivor: WAIT, THAT’S ILLEGAL ( I hate using iri heads too though tbh 😅 )
---
Wow nice fog

No one said that

I mean, I dont think so? But maybe

Question for you contextually what was the clue we were supposed to know you were the rank 8 survivor and not the killer complaining?  Zero context for that my dude.  Might want to hold off on the idiots until you get this whole posting bad screenshots with no context to reddit thing down.
---
New add on: Draco
---
Killers hate this guy! Cleanse totems to see why!
---
Uh, it CAN affect how the game is played though.  
---
Certain survivor outfits make it far easier, or difficult to pick out.  
---
Certain Killer outfits give you more options for hiding your danlgy bits.  Looking at you Spirit.
---
Good ol' insta mori
---
People that tunnel and think DS is OP: 🤡🤡🤡
---
Apart from being able to move across the map silently and with additional speed? Then the prayer beads would be more balanced as a buff to your map presence, while also a killer who has functional use of their human senses will be able to figure where survivors are / are going.
---
Atm prayer beads (speaking as a killer main and the spirit is my favorite killer) are just not fun for survivors because there is no counter play and that makes it require a balance.
---
Let alone with my suggestion you would still be able to use line of sight to block your approach, giving it a stealth aspect. If you are charging down the middle of the map in the open then you can expect to be seen as any killer.
---
I mean, moat of tbe characters in this game were still alive when they were taken. Dont know why these two should be any different.
---
I didn't say it was
---
Personally think it’s the hitboxes.
---
Even with green ping killers you can still get hit from ridiculous distances.
---
But we’re gonna see when dedicated servers come out.
---
its both, but the main thing is hitboxes, particularly in the case of getting hit outside of a window.
---
Invest in better photos man.  This is absurdly bad to post.
---
Need more vaseline on camera lens!
---
Great now the devs need to fix this
---
Continually pressuring a single survivor, unless they are the weakest link (and even then) means you’ll have very competent survivors run you around forever while you sacrifice map pressure, or it means those good survivors will do gens very quickly. It’s important to pressure every survivor as much as possible so they are constantly in a cycle of healing or saving or running around instead of getting gen progress. Focusing one survivor solely means every other one gets free reign to finish the match.
---
Certain high tier or even top tier perks like BT, DS, and to a lesser extent, adrenaline, punish tunneling as well. Tunneling puts some of these perks at their best, and buys the survivors so much additional time if used even slightly well
---
are these like the secondary outfit you get when buying the chapter like quentin and laurie, or are they separate?
---
I read the name as Aubra Plazey and I feel ashamed
---
You can use a remote if you want, so comfort level shouldn't change.

I see a lot of people remap the Struggle to Mouse Wheel Down, so they can just scroll through the struggle instead of mashing a key.

---
You forgot spirit with the beads ready to scare the shit out of survivor babus
---
It's clearly not intended
---
If you've finished all of the seasons then here's an explanation for why it won't work
---
&gt;!The Demogorgons CAN tear through reality, but as far as we currently know they're just puppets being used by the Mind flayer, for all we know they could be peaceful creatures corrupted by the Mind Flayer. I'm assuming the lore for the Demogorgon is going to either talk about a bargain between the Mind Flayer and the Entity, or the Entity yoinked this Demogorgon and placed it under it's control!&lt;
---
When do they come out? I thought they already were
---
What how is that even the case, if you consider camping on the hook a dick move and you don't consider this one what's your point? You say its a dick move to camp the hook... And why? Because it makes it near impossible for that survivor to escape, then how is this any different? It still makes it near impossible for the survivor to escape, I obviously didn't say don't kill anyone did I, I said go for the bill because then at least the survivor would've stood a half decent chance. Your literally downvoting me for an opinion you don't share with me... Not because I'm being toxic or anything and that's just dumb
---
*gets hit by hatchet* 
---
Why are you the way that you are?
---
Nurse can't do shit in real life without scratchmarks. If she blinks and gets the fatigue thingy you just hide and she will have a hard time finding you. Myers is a superhuman who knows every second where you are and jumpscares the fuck out of you when you don't expect it.
---
Fucking fantastic.

I already bought it, but it might be useful for DLCs. Thanks dude

try after teh 13th, when ranks reset and u get double pips easily

I love your art, and I wish I could throw stuff in game lol.
---
Help! This slutty nurse is trying to smother me with a pillow
---
taken with an actual potato
---
I think as long as the system won't be binary, we will face ranking issues. You can't have both survivors and killer "win" the game. This results in too many red ranks.
---
Yo what even is this comment?
---
i want a killer that switches bodies with a survivor
---
They have not come out, they said by the end of summer so September 21st.
---
What a cute Pollywog
---
People accused me of hacking for using A Nurse's Calling. Well, pardon me.
---
Do people still ever get tagged as cheaters for using those? I've heard people on this subreddit warn about that.
---
Oh yeah for sure. That bug and the little lagspike that hits right as bloodlust tiers up have both cost me sooo many kills. But then I see a survivor vault a window 3 times before they finally get through so I guess it evens out.
---
\*slams hands on desk\* I demand a pinstripe suit-wearing Demogorgon with dumb, tiny fedora that flies off any time it roars!

As a recently new player I thought exposed meant I could see the survivors auras and kept getting frustrated that my NOED was getting “destroyed” because each time the gates got opened I never saw survivor auras.

Indeed it would and BhVR interactive are slitting their own throats for not making it happen!

What hag skin is that?
---
a few bloodhunts ago i remember getting over 200k in one match, 5 streamers plus 4 stacks of bbq
---
32k is the max Points per Game. 4 Stacks BBQ or WGLF, 5x Streamers and 2x BP (Event)
---
—&gt; 8x 32k —&gt; 256k if I‘m not mistaken
---
They spikey
---
That’s... a lot of points.
---
Iridididescent*
---
Either way I'll still go after you I really don't mind getting killed after you get unhooked.
---
BPS is a 100% bonus.  So, with 5 of them, that's 160k.  Add the base 32k, that's 192k.  BBQ/WGLF at 4 stacks is another 32k, so up to 224.  BH is additive, so I believe that's another 32k, putting us at 256k total.
---
Are we talking “won’t stop chasing you despite another survivor being wounded and within hitting distance” tunneling or just hunting you down because you’re the only guy he saw all match?
---
This bothers me so bad.  I get it, in certain situations you don't heal at hook.  However, most team mates run to the other side of the map and still refuse a heal.  
---
LET ME RUB YOUR BACK AND SPLIT YOUR CRACK NERD
---
Shirtless David gives you an extra health state.
---
Again it existing doesn't give us a free pass to exploit stupid shit like this that was never intended to be a mechanic in the game clearly.  The devs obviously never meant for this to be done with her ability.  
---
Lol you seriously trying to go high-brow and bring up character over this?  OP clearly has no character otherwise they wouldn't pull shit like this to bm other players for trolls.  Half their comments are just them relishing in being a dick and griefing in this situation.  Honestly it kinda reflects on yours as well for being such a staunch defender of this horseshit.

I was hoping someone else would need the information.  I had to google "PTB gaming" before finally getting a result.  All of those results were DbD related so it must be their term.

If you get 32k bloodpoints in a game with 5 bps using bbq during double bloodpoints you would get a total of 700% bloodpoints, which are then doubled for a total of 448000 bloodpoints.
---
Practice? Some people are just real good at looping and running the killer. Also depends on the killers ability tbh. Avoid being and try to mind game(d) and you can loop some killers for like 3 gens in one pallet.
---
Pretty sure awake survivors can see them but I could be wrong. Not a survivor main
---
Indeed
---
This is why I don't use resilience anymore
---
Math:
---
BPS gives you 100% more blood points, so do BBQ and double blood points doubles the value of your end game result (hypothetically). So
---
32k+32k(BPS)+32k(BBQ)=96k Bloodpoints
---
Doubled by double blood point weekend=192k bloodpoints!
---
For survivor just replace BBQ with we’re gonna live forever
---
So happy that freddy was chill about it. We need more moments like this.
---
&gt; hang out until he came over...then I just turned around and walked out as soon as he got over to me lol.
---
For the love of god, just leave.  
---
Do you know how long killer queues average?
---
You have report options after every game on PC as well, and you can report directly to steam easily too
---
Me to my teammates when the killer won't give up the chase after who knows how long
---
i wish this was put into the anniversary skin contest, she’s adorable
---
I mean they disappeared indefinitely in the "real world", so everyone probably just assumed them to be dead, even if they didn't actually die. They were just "snatched"
---
Why haven't the developers fixed this? It's been in the game for at least 6 months
---
Whats Your twitch?

Straight out a Christmas Carol, here comes Jacob Marley!
---
I cannot for the life of me understand why you won’t just go for the other survivor if you hate ds so much. Instead you come here and complain “hurr durr, it’s so unfair that survivors have a single way to prevent getting tunnelled”
---
u/epic_gamer1812
---
I think you're close but you forgot about one thing. You can use Gruesome Gataeus (I think that's what they're called? The double points offering for Ghostfaces event) instead of Bloody Party Streamers to get 103% more points instead of the 100% extra you get from the Streamers.
---
So if my math is correct (and it rarely is lol) it'll be closer to 280k
---
*confused screaming*
---
when you teabag the killer and he starts camping your friends
---
It's like a toxic moshpit
---
Female character models feel like an advantage so nancy gang here
---
No mither shirtless David would’ve prevented this.
---
*When will you learn*
---
I didn't bring up character, you did. I'm responding to your character attack, which I see you have continued. I am a defender of doing what's in the game, until the devs take it out of the game. 
---
You haven't addressed the facts that: 
---
1: this is in the game in hundreds of iterations across nearly every level.
---
2: it's not on the players to seek out and mind-read what the devs "intended" but rather to play the game they are given
---
3: If it's an "exploit" (which it isn't, as this occurs as a result of regular gameplay), it's easily fixable by the devs, but they have never said it is forbidden to do.
---
Sorry you don't like it. I dare say I see quite a parallel to the people I meet at Smash tournaments that complain that people "throw too much". 
---
It's in the game. 
---
Deal with it, move on, or throw childish insults. I guess we know which option you're taking.
---
I never once protested it? Was just pointing out that thats the point where hitboxes can feel the wonkiest.
---
There was a problem regarding item rarity and it's appearance in the bloodweb. With pink perks, it made it almost impossible to complete the sets of perks you already have until you finished buying the tier 1 brown perks.
---
I mean that's Steam's fault unless there is a joke I'm not getting
---
!SPOILER!For stranger things season 4

Nancy and Steve fucking die

I highly recommend using Claudette until you unlock Self Care
---
The primary reason for playing a videogame is to have fun, and there are some things in DBD that are simply anti-fun at best, and outright cancerous at worst. We're talking PB Spirit, Instasaw Shitbillies and 4+ blink Nurses. If 4 out of the 5 people in the lobby aren't having fun, what's the point of playing? 
---
I can only dedicate a limited amount of time each day to the game, and i wanna have some fun during this time. Playing these kind of matches only leads to frustration, not fun, so i wouldn't fault anyone for DC-ing. Besides, whoever DCs will negatively impact their own rank the most, and if the killer isn't a complete shitbag (although let's face it, if he runs these cancerous builds, he probably is), he might even farm with the other people in the lobby so they can all at least get a pip and some BP.
---
Drop Whispers and run Brutal Strength.  It helps when you're in T3 to be quick with pallets.
---
Double blood points does not double the entire count. It only doubles the base blood points which is up to 32k. Its like a permanent bloody party streamer for all.
---
You encase it in
---
\&gt;!!&lt;
---
You need to play killer sometime. You totally lack any perspective on that side of the game.
---
Thanks I’ll know for next time.
---
You want to get up in ranks? The fun decreases with every rank you climb.
---
So it would be 800%? In that case you would get 28800.
---
This is why I have a preference for Botany Knowledge. Med-kits last longer, Healing speed is increased all-around, and no requirements to activate it. At least I can use Botany on myself if no one else uses it and get the heal boost on others at any moment when they ask for healing.
---
Then you get people running away and it's like why do I even have this perk.
---
ok thanks
---
Actually laughed out loud. Welcome to the fog!!!!
---
Funnily enough there was a cosmetic contest awhile back if I remember correctly the Clown and  Min won
---
That's a salty survivor.
---
I think most games say Pts instead, but it's the same thing
---
They actually did that.
---
It literally pops up on your screen if someone has it...
---
I was thinking a killer based off the season 3 villain would be dope, ( not saying what or who for spoilerific reasons )
---
Just gotta put that No Mither on so it'll never be taken away :)
---
We’ve just had a community cosmetic contest, 2 designs were chosen, demon slayer Fung Min and an elephant clown costume design for the clown, will be in the game in the near future.
---
A group of friends maybe? Not exactly sure how the ranking system works in terms of surviving with friends.
---
From a rank 3 doc main, you're doing fine. Some survivors are salty because they think they're entitled to a win no matter what just because they exist.
---
I think I've seen those letters combined before.
---
I used Meg as my first character because everyone recommended it. I kinda regret it. I never use her perks, like ever. I'd say Claudette and maybe Nea are the best to start with.
---
This map is only good for one killer, HILLBILLY. You just chainsaw around and hope somebody is in the corn lmao. 
---
With every other character this map is a piece of shit
---
How would you use your power in a chase if they can see you? You can’t. And you have slower movement speed.
---
Diversion, allows you to literally chuck a stone in the killers face at the exit gate.
---
I’m joking btw
---
Its looked down upon but it it doesnt matter to me and i usually just hover around the hook w a bit of space or if someone makes noise ill go towards them but other than that i just sorta hover close enough to get them if they are unhooked but not so close they dont get a chance to unhook them
---
No [https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudSweetStingrayPeteZarollTie](https://clips.twitch.tv/ProudSweetStingrayPeteZarollTie)
---
So yeah again just mindlessly doubling down on the mindset that if it's physically possible to do in game it's free for players to use.  Nothing else matters including when mechanics break to the point where they become exploits.  It's people like you that try to justify running Infinite Mend Legion despite knowing the addons were broken and not intending the way they were designed too.  I believe in personal responsibility.   If you're just going to shift all responsibility off the player and on to the devs solely there's really no reason to continue this.
---
If the person who unhooks you has We’ll Make It, it’ll appear next to your perks in the bottom right to let you know.
---
I have done this can confirm. Lots of points.
---
I'll refer you back to points 1, 2 and 3. Get back to me when you are ready to have a conversation.
---
And also this gets downvoted why? My comment saying its unfair gets downvoted because you disagree? How is it not unfair? You downvoters are literally just shit killers lol
---
I use save the best for last because I don’t have nurses calling unlocked for everyone yet.
---
Why is he trash? Sure was unfair what he did but its funny as hell
---
trust me when I say I saw the whole thread and conclude nothing but that you complained about survivors using teachable... smh for you to sit here and trash talk like you do.. trashy high key keep getting salty lol
---
Camouflage is really interesting I'm curious on other people's thoughts. Almost seems like a reverse-ruin, in that, it can significantly slow down the killers generator disruption BUT if they know the map they're fine.
---
I like it, although it would need a cooldown or a hard cap on number of times it can be used
---
“Perfectly balanced as things should be...”
---
Proxy camping is considered the same as face camping to some players, it is hard to counter so when they fail a save attempt the easy reaction is "tonneling face camper!!" One guy I slugged and rightly guessed that he had ds, so I went for his teammates. He dced and I tried to message him and tell him I didn't pick him up bc of ds. He had massaging blocked and his his about me read something like " I like to play dbd with friends. Currently being facecamped by legion" I was honored to be rage mentioned in someone's about me but srsly slugging=facecamping in some twisted minds
---
Nah youre fine! People on this game can just get real salty though lol
---
OP did appear to do the thing!
---
Responds with more doubling down on the same beaten horse with more signature condescension peppered in at the end.  There isn't a conversation to have here.
---
I am inclined to disagree with you sir. You know the age old saying, "Skins equals Wins."
---
WTF WAS THAT
---
I found universally that sexy David got me swung at more than normal david. 
---
I'm too attractive to resist
---
For me Hag is not really scary...just those jump scares...i swear one day i'm gonna get heart attack
---
the way i see it, play how you want. when i first started i used to camp alot, even when you dont camp/tunnel, you still get salty people. its the nature of the internet. Its sort of their fault for staying together in the downstairs imo
---
A survivor I. The upside down causes nearby Christmas lights to light up. 
---
The trouble with “sounds” is that the regular map doesn’t have much noise. It’s all music with just birds, pallet drops, gens and crying. Not much to go on. 
---
The DG taking 5 secs to exit the tunnel and 2 secs to travel further is a lifetime. Welcome to earlier Freddy. 
---
The portal would be easy to find, as it’d be close to the hook. Unless that hike closes behind the DG.
---
Going after someone after 50ish seconds isn’t tunneling.
---
I miss the fog
---
Lmao
---
Its 700% 
---
500% streamers
---
100% bbq
---
100% bloodhunt
---
Each offering double the base blood points you earn they are addictive not multiplicative.
---
So lets assume you get a perfect 32k games.
---
32k x2 (bloodhunt bonus) = 64k
---
Then the bbq adds 32k.
---
Then add 5x32k for the streamers. Which is 160k
---
So yes 256k max bloodpoints.
---
Demopuppers
---
I legit want a Little Shop of Horrors-inspired Plant costume for him.
---
Did his as a joke yesterday as Myers with no perks or add-ons and still 4k a squadette
---
Play how you want, you’re going to get hate mail no matter what you do in any competitive game.
---
Holy shit I remember that, I was the huntress, it was like my 5th game
---
So you wrote to him first? Hmmm
---
Aww, they will grow out of it.
---
Tbh i don't think Pig needs a rework. Freddy definitely did, but she is fine at her core. Just rework her addons since most of them are useless, and that's it.
---
You can see her booty if you click the dress in shop outfits and spin her. Your welcome.
---
It's not funny. It's annoying and unsportsmanlike, I'm not saying he can't do it, but it does in fact make him trash.
---
Tf is your problem lol
---
No ghostface🙃
---
If you can, use the rusty saw (I think that's what it's called) addon to see if you like playing her before you make the purchase.
---
FWIW, Endurance is what's granted by Borrowed Time. If you take a hit while under the effect of Endurance, you get a Deep Wound instead of going down (only applies if you're already injured)
---
Omg I feel this one rather hard at the fact I’m a Claud main. And then people do NYOOM on the other side of the map and I’m like. “Welp. No buttrubs for you then :(“
---
Active Ability button for gen TP. (Control key by default) 
---
Hold to TP, let go to cancel.
---
I'm killer main, but I also play survivor  pretty regularly to learn my enemy and honestly I don't remember the last time when I saw Clown as survivor.
---
Other than her abilities and perks, not much else is left to say other than best of luck OP! I hope you kick ass with her and have some great games
---
I mean the screaming. When someone screams, it shows like a silhouette of where the survivor is at that moment, that doesn't count as an aura and therefore isn't affected by distortion.
---
Deliverance is the new DS. Crutch last survivor self safes were the only reason i have got ds, but since it got nerfed i can get the same result with deliverance. 
---
Im a killer main now and i know which people have DS by the way they are playing so its easy to just slug them for 60 and hook them. You should definitly put DS away in low ranks.
---
Any sound is enough to give it away though, even if it is just the faint music changing in pitch
---
I got the portal creation times from base killer walking speed based off terror radius size, generally killers move about 4.2 m/s, with terror radius being about 32 m, figured it was long, but the fact that you wouldn't get a notification of an approaching angry being would be enough to counteract the time
---
And for the portal placements, I was thinking more along the lines of the killer dropping the survivor in first, then dragging them through the upside down for the bonus speed ( akin to the deer from S
---
Pog
---
Thanks =)
---
Shameless cash grab is shameless
---
Because its makes his original post sound real and he takes the joke as if he’s actually being called gay while saying Nancy is flat and ugly. He also does it in a super obnoxious way.
---
Honestly, I strongly reccomend looking up guides and whatnot before commiting to a new character. This is a tough game with a serious learning curve to master specific killers.
---
Bloodhunt bonus does not double the effects of bbq and streamers.
---
So if you had 1 streamer and 3 stacks of bbq during bloodhunt it would work like this:
---
2x32k bloodhunt bonus = 64k + another 32k for streamer + 32k for bbq = 128k total.
---
If there are more then 1 streamer just add another 32k for each additional streamers.
---
That perk is borrowed time.
---
H2018 Myers? Yeah, I would buy that.
---
Don't avoid using your crouch melee, it has good range and speed, depending on the loop you can melee around it if you control it right.
---
How about.... dont buy them!!!
---
Rank 16 survivor, steam: yelloflash1997, discord: yellowflash#3041, looking for a swf group to play casually. I prefer players from India and Thailand as I only get green ping there.

Oh, what a coincidence! For the record, I wasn't in a group with the other guys or anything, I'm sorry they were pretty rude to you in post-game chat :/
---
How did you get out so easily?

Glass Splinter is what you're looking for!

That’s the one!

People interpret your original message as a toxic one.  
---
“Oh he’s running bamboozle and spirit fury on the spirit, those 2 perks are bad for her and if you run them on her it implies you don’t know much about the game”  
---
Then you say he’s running NOED for the same reason as BB and SF, implying that he doesn’t know much about the game yet or in other words: you’re bad if you use NOED.
---
Thanks.
---
Lol idk, isn't my post so it might or might not be one
---
Maybe some buffs id be fine with but its likely she does get reworked which would be even better
---
Don't have Nurse or Doctor levelled up
---
You have better understanding of the blood hunt than me

Np

Deliverance perk

Lmao i have bad experience getting stuck inside of little indents and shit on backwater so i just go wide on em
---
Isn’t he voicing Steve I though?
---
I just wish you had time to t-bag.
---
Don't have Plague or Trapper levelled up
---
I hate these types of spots. If this is a common "spawn" they need to move the tree further back or remove it because there should NEVER be spots that "look" like your character ought to easily fit through, but actually can't.
---
And using DS, BT and Adrenaline is sportsmanlike?
---
Stealth mechanics?
---
It’s GlenOck, so it’s sadly serious. I mean, a whole fucking petition about a DBD killer looks unbelievable and a joke, but when you see who posted, it’s a very “Ah... I see” moment.
---
I personally think his chainsaw attack should be a lot longer. Like 2x longer, maybe even more with add-ons and have things like the Chili's increase duration and to balance it out, make it a bit more difficult to control and make his babyrage tantrum last longer the longer he saws for.
---
This allows for Bubba's with good steering to easily cut down a survivor with his saw before they get to safety, but is more punishing for those who can't maneuver well.
---
Agreed. Good killers can predict survivors movements so trying to hide does not really help whatsoever.
---
Thanks. Any advice/tricks? I have gotten the message that dream pallets are realllly map dependent. Autiwreckers you are king, corn you are loser.

Haha, guess so. It is pretty common to see the posts before bloodhunts and people apply the 2x multiplier at the end.
---
Once upon a time I'm told however when streamers were new they were multiplied by blood hunt but that was well before my time.

Good luck in the fog this upcoming blood hunt though!

For the sake of discussion, think perks like Surveillance or ones that color a generator a different color in certain situations would trump this or no?

I played this game near release (about 3 years ago). I was considering getting back into it and maybe convincing some friends as well (due to the Humble Bundle Sale). Which DLCs are the highest priority (good perks, killers, survivors, etc.)? Can you play just the base game or will you be outclassed?

That’s some nice mcdonalds wifi connection there.

Wanna know something depressing
---
I’m on holiday during the blood hunt
---
Nice pun, but it’s still a perk though.
---
Lol, no lie I use to ignore totems and get pissed when NOED would change our win to a loss.
---
Now I make sure to cleanse 2 to 3 before I finish 2 gens and it has drastically reduced NOED killers from gaining the upper hand.
---
Its a dead horse because you survivor mains cant bear hearing that you guys are toxic. And when the killer does something toxic its instantly against the rules and its bannable and unsportsmanlike. 
---
That Dwight was stupid and went into a dead end with a beartrap within the killers terrorradius, its his own fault.
---
hag is hot
---
Pig is a harder killer to get really good at it. Like some others said, you should watch guides and gameplay to get some tips on her.
---
No problem man. You seriously deserve more subs for how in depth your stuff is. It's honestly amazing
---
The Perk is called, Playing Opossum!
---
you're playing perfect

Funny how serious the community gets lol. I am excited too.
---
im gonna give same tip as i gave to myself when i bought Nightmare (freddy, only killer ive bought)
---
allow urself to accept get pwned by survivors. learn slowly ur skills and how to use them on different situations.
---
spoiler thx buddy
---
Awesome. Thank you
---
&gt;Tunneling comment is silly. That's a recipe for losing matches as killer. Decisive hard counters it and if they know how to loop which they should unless you're commenting from potato ranked that tunneled survivor can loop you through your final gens.
---
Decisive doesn't really waste that much time, it just buys you another chase. Any survivor can loop, makes no difference whether they're being tunneled. Let me make this real simple:
---
pros of tunneling:
---
-You aren't wasting time finding the survivor
---
-You're chasing an injured survivor, meaning you down them in one hit and can hear their groans 
---
-You have the best chance at confining the chase to a smaller area, dealing with fewer pallets
---
-once you're successful, you're only dealing with three survivors and can easily roll that into a 4K if you want it that badly
---
Cons:
---
-You may have to eat DS a couple times, wasting about 15 seconds more than chasing and hitting a healthy survivor twice. If you are that worried about this, just slug your target instead.
---
&gt;I've taken 4 gens easy out of so many killers that thought it'd be a smart play to tunnel me off hook.
---
But if they hadn't tunneled you, they would have downed and killed you?
---
Do you need help getting our of the toilet?
---
Sorry for my goofy voice and my Slavic English, I tend to talk to myself in English when I play videogames 😒
---
I dunno he's the only character that actually looks scary
---
Probably the latter, only the true toxic survivors will go on reddit to type such a lengthty title to shit on killers.
---
It should give the the unhooked survivor a status effect to let them know they can be healed
---
I watched the fat phony Family Guy episode right before that. I guess nobody else got the reference.
---
I won’t say I’m not camping as a wraith but I usually also pick the nearest 2 hens and run a patrol between those and the hook. You get half a chance in that case. I’m not going to just stand there while everyone else slams gens waiting for first catch of the day to die.
---
Just don't face camp and slash people on the hook. There's nothing wrong with sticking nearby, but staring a hooked player in the face and slashing them repeatedly is pretty douchie.
---
There's no way of knowing half of the things you said about Dwight, so stop, you're embarrassing yourself. Also I've never said survivors cant be toxic, but you're clearly another one sided killer main who can't see past the fact that both sides have problems lol just go home
---
Ah, gotcha. Yes true, though the fake doctors also reveal a survivors location. I think while distrotion is a solid perk, all these things that reveal survs without showing their aura would justify more tokens for the perk...
---
To be fair, pre-rework legion was complete cancer &amp; I say that as someone who plays a shit ton of legion. There was no running from legion, if they saw you, you are getting hit period. Also remember how bad franks mix tape was with the deep wounds? No thank you. I remember ppl would d/c once loading into a legion game, &amp; I dont blame them. Do I think legion is currently strong? No. Do I miss old legion? Hell no.
---
You can play the base game just fine but some of the best killer perks are in the dlc. You can wait for the shrine of secrets to have some of the better perks though. For survivors of you play on PC most of the meta perks are available to you from the start. End of the day though, you aren't required to buy any dlc, since you can earn them all through the in game currency
---
Ty for the critique! You're not the only one who thought about using mud. I just didn't want it to smell and i tried using brown spray paint to resemble dirtiness.
---
That is depressing.
---
What's also depressing if you never played during a blood hunt killer wait times skyrocket and survivor wait times climb a bit too.
---
What happens is everyone wants to play killer even those who normally do not because the blood points are better. So less survivors then killers makes it screwed up.
---
I'm not much of a survivor myself I avoid it I mostly play killer so after the first day of long wait times and earning less blood points then I normally do because I spent so much more time waiting then playing I just abandon the game until after the event. Unless I want to play survior which is not likely because there seems to be more killers out to try and ruin the fun during blood hunt.
---
It's looked down upon and is considered rude but ultimately you can play how you want. 
---
That said, camping is very punishable once you start playing with skilled players, in that if you camp they'll be smart enough just to do gens and you won't get many points. Also your ranking at the end of the match is reduced if you camp.
---
TL;DR: it's frowned upon, but you can do it, just don't rely on it as it won't work in higher ranks
---
Soo cute :3
---
thank uu^^^
---
Ok meme but try to read back what you type lol have a good one
---
Without a large majority of the perks, you'll have a rough time.
---
I would prioritize Hag (Of Flesh and Mud) and Cannibal (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) for Hex: Ruin / BBQ and Chili.  Most killers have at least one worthwhile perk, though.
---
Legion is straight s for me
---
Tree fiddy
---
The Dwight was in a dead end. There is no way he got there because of the killer lmao...
---
Im playing 70% killer 30% survivor. I know the problems of camping killers, you just die thats it. NEXT ROUND. Killers have to bear the pain of toxic survivors for the entire match.
---
Now the devs will patch this. Thanks a lot
---
Leg gang rise up

I miss the old end screen with the fog.

---
There’s a ranking system to try and increase game quality by matching experience level, nothing about it is competitive.
---
This has been done so many times
---
They haven’t announced the price yet
---
thats juicy
---
At the exit, I honestly didn't know if the game would give me time to escape. But after this, I probably could have squeezed in a teabag, and still escape. You're probably invincible for the entire duration of the stun (5 seconds) and I escape when the stun was still in effect.
---
“Good grief...”
---
Did I hit a nerve there, sonny?
---
Hell yeah. Just give her stronger cheekbones &amp; add some "menacing" then shes basically a jojos character
---
DS wasting about 15 seconds......dude what rank killer are you personally commenting from where this is an accurate comment?  A competent red rank survivor can punish you for a lot longer than 15 seconds with a D Strike.  That one hit point can take them through a long chase if they know what they're doing.  It sounds like you're offering this advice from potato ranks or something where I 100% agree they don't know what they're doing in a chase yet and probably would be tunneled down easily.  If you want to beat good groups though you will see just how bad tunneling can be.  They run you for multiple gens while you tunnel vision them mindlessly chasing that 1 hp survivor while the other 3 just bang out gens uninterrupted.
---
Can you explain it? I don't get what are you talking about.
---
Okay this is epic
---
It’s a setting that can be done on nvidia cards
---
The survivor made a mistake, that's not the problem, the problem is the killer stood there being a dick and gloated about it on a public forum, it just makes him a douche. Upon further inspection of his posts the ONLY other post from him is complaining that you shouldn't bully other "low level" characters. That means he's a hypocritical douche. I'm sorry you have a rough time with survivors, play some more and I'm sure you'll get there champ. Best of luck!
---
Yeah it’s a SWF. It tries to find a mean rank for all the surv in the group.
---
Mayers and weteran
---
He didn't mean OP as in over powered. He meant OP as in original poster, like the guy who posted the vid
---
Ya he said he felt bad tunnelling , I was surprised lol.
---
Change the bottom one from me crying about rin to me crying that Susie basically got peer pressured to kill
---
Aha a man of class it seems
---
Interesting tho I have to know what’s the platform for this as I play on ps4 and have played since release always willing to teach others so long as they are willing to learn
---
Many survivor think that the main objective to rank up is to survive every game and they get salty if die.
---
Actually they just need to do stuff to get enough points.
---
If u camp generators dont worry your playing correctly. If survivors are dumb and need 1 more generator but all rest 2 or 3 generators are next to each others in favour of killer its theyr own fault.
---
If you camp survivor on hook its ur call, but its also free gens for survivors since you keep being still and they can just fix rest.
---
But if you camp in front of theyr face and keep hitting them like earlier poster said, its considered very jerkish. But still, its free gens for other survivors
---
As you can see every time I mess up I keep trying to go for the window and get back in the locker 😂😂
---
Any and all platforms are welcome.
---
Oh these ones. I figured it out after posting. My phone autocorrect did the job
---
This still happens

Sucks, well I was just trying to give you a heads-up have a good one
---
When the fragility yo emojis sets in 🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
---
Yeah okay youre right about the gloated part. Didnt think about that one, im sorry. You were right.
---
I'd hold off on the babykiller stuff yet.  I watched that video and you made so many mistakes.  You abandoned safe loops prematurely and blindly in favor of running into the open.  If the killer wasn't so bad he'd have downed you numerous times with a simple mindgame attempt.  And there's timing involved with flashlight saves you can't just immediately light it up and point it at them.  You still got some developing to do yourself so maybe try not messaging insults to bad players.
---
Look at the cute little clown!!
---
You’d need to add the new stranger things perks in to make it come in at normal range. It’s to underpowered where it’s at now.
---
Saboing hooks, body blocking, and looping are all things part of the game. While I don't respect BM, it just leads to more like you did in your situation. The stuff you thought was bad is just things that are part of it. Otherwise, good luck in the fog.
---
You like insulting people on what side they like to play huh? Stop being a dick and be more productive with something.
---
All DLCs were 50% cheaper for a few weeks until recently. In the PS store, I mean
---
Guess Freddys better run Dream Snares until this gets patched.
---
I just dc a couple of times when im dead on hook or sometimes at the exit gates. Gives me 2 depips and survivor points aren’t that inpressive compared to killer anyway.
---
Every killer deserves their own Synthwave Radius.
---
That is... I can't... what even...
---
Congrats, you broke me.
---
Here's what I do since I fall into the pit trap of playing DbD all day: In the morning do whatever you need to accomplish your life goal and then, in the afternoon after work, spend 30 minutes to an hour on your goals. After that, play all night.
---
During the weekends I spend 2 hours per day studying and the whole day with my precious Doctor. &lt;3
---
If I were you, I'd recommend doing Pomodoros, its a GREAT time management system.
---
Oh I just had a match where I was playing the clown to complete a daily, I main survivor. My killer rank is 16, but I went against all rank 3...
---
Hardcore parkour!
---
You tell me honestly a man filled with hooks wearing a mask with teeth and holding The Cleaver won't make you shit yourself when he starts walking faster then you run and I won't believe you.
---
Certain clothing items can help characters hide. In the flip side really bright, ostentatious clothes can help the killer spot you when you otherwise might not have been found. You're more likely to spot a feng min with the ballerina outfit than a p3 Claudette.
---
This is like the 10th post I’ve seen today asking the same exact thing...
---
Nurse is the best killer in the game, and "needs" no perks, so you won't be outclassed so long as you have *skill*.
---
In terms of priority, the average killer needs Ruin to slow the game at high levels. That's about.
---
Borrowed Time (Bill, paid), Adrenaline (Meg, free), Decisive Strike (Laurie, paid), Dead Hard (David, free).
---
Still waiting on the ptb ???
---
No problem 👍
---
on console ive seen that it really puts randomly ppl together becouse lower population i guess. sometimes matchmaking takes ages on ps4 but today got lot of games asap.
---
I guess once we get dedicated servers it helps out.
---
(as european i got even japanese ppl, ping over 300)

This is my solo experience. By that I mean 60% of my climb to Devotion 7 experience because the other 40% is me playing killer.
---
You deserve every fucking flashlight click, chain blind, Tbag, body block, and genrush that you ever get. Scummy fucking no life
---
So you can acquire DLC perks from the in-game currency? Are they equivalent to bloodpoints (i think they were called that) or some other currency? Are killers only available through the DLCs?
---
Will Shrine of the Secrets DLC have other DLC perks included or does it just have new and better perk options?
---
Yeah I second this, after level 50 there is always 2 perks make sure you always pick 1.
---
Also save blood points somewhat if you haven't read bloodwebs will be changing to ease the grind.
---
Read about it here:
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/82749/designer-notes-new-status-effects-and-bloodweb-changes/p1
---
imagine a full team running guardian, they all follow each other around. when one would go down the other just gets the hit instead and is instantly healed by the other two. this 100% needs to be a one time use perk
---
He was facecamping.
---
But I know, I should've looped the killer shack, instead of turning to the jungle gym. I was trying to be smart to zig zag between the trees, but I should've looked behind me to see if it's even worth it, because he got tier 3 off of me anyways. I got lucky with that pallet. I did manage to mind-game him at the hay bales, and later in the same gym, by abandoning it completely instead of looping.
---
Two new statuses, oblivious and undetectable. They are being tested with the demogorgon, and will be rolled out onto other killers and perks and whatnot later on.
---
Why is it that every Wraith has to play like this? I don't understand
---
you’re one of the killers this meme is made about  I’m assuming lmao
---
Dude fucking SAMMEEEE.
---
There are add-ons that apply speed penalties to actions when you’re asleep, not to mention his teleporting power regenerates faster for every survivor asleep.
---
Buy Amanda. For perks I use Nurse's Calling, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, Ruin or Pop Goes the Weisel. Use the traps as needed don't use them all immediately.
---
not to mention bloodweb changes coming WITH dedicated servers, we can wait a little longer.
---
His ability to teleport to gens is gained faster, the more people are asleep. Also, if Freddy has certain addons, being asleep slows down action speeds. Other than that, not much reason.
---
if u wanna be toxic do something like "LULW IMAGE PAYING FOR KILLER AND STILL SUCK ASS LULW"
---
You literally can't understand sarcasm my dude. Dude legit said killers should only use their own perks. To which replied, yeah and David and Laurie should be the only ones to use dead hard and DS then.
---
But whatever dude. You read the whole thread of my single sentence and can't grasp sarcasm. That's okay though. You keep being a toxic little survivor main complaining about killers.
---
Play in whatever way you want and whatever niches you find to be successful. Your job at killer requires you to think of what they are doing what type of player each one is. What perks they are running, who is swf what gens they are going to do next which routes they are going to take. Playing killer takes far more scouting and you playing each players weakness against them is ultimately your job.
---
Multiple times in rank 1 have i identified 2 survivors who are best buds and exploited the hell out of their early hook rescues by camping near a hook, pretending to leave, going invis, or leaving a chase and that. Has nothing to do with your personal character or skill in the game 
---
Despite what any survivor who complains about dying as the side who dies or escapes.

---
Heard the devs on stream say they don’t mind people farming so I thing your good, besides if they did most people would be banned after a double blood point event happens! I haven’t been banned yet...
---
Good point, but it's likely that the Entity fills the exact same role that the Mindflayer did
---
I think the old dead by daylight seems for fun and scary

I'm usually Rank 10. This was I think on the day of rank reset, so I assumed everyone would be the same skill level, because if I went from 10 to 14, than anyone at rank 15 would have been 11, right? So it's not that low ranks.
---
We were quite salty about this game. But I didn't have any bad intent. And I also didn't reply to his reply. It just felt good to message him, because we thought that last facecamo was despicable, and felt it was karma that I got the DS escape.
---
WHERE THE FUCK IS MY PRECIOUS D'ART?!
---
I’m entirely certain this is a bug, but posts like this help the devs fix it, so much appreciated good sir.
---
I kinda wish they’d just get rid of all the wards. 
---
You used your stuff. It’s gone now.
---
I understand how the pip system works, it’s just really hard to pip when there’s constant attempted escapes, suicides, gens getting blown up, people not knowing to heal, pallets being wasted, crouching in the corner of the map, being left on the hook, and pretty much every other way that people can be a bad teammate in this game. DBD is a team game, but it feels like a 1v4 instead of a 4v1 when you have bad teammates in solo queue.
---
Pink add ones is the most unfun thing in the game. I don’t think I ever played against iridescent head without the whole team dc’ing
---
My friends and I play SWF and it's always like this! All our ranks are different.
---
"I have the fast heals".

Shh grandma it's time for your medicine

I’m too distracted by the We’ll Make It timer not ticking down

I try to ignore the OoO just to spite them

When you go to vault the window but you jump in a locker instead

At that point, I would look into a way to escalate the issue to Microsoft, who can probably do something about the Xbox itself that's sending the messages.

You don’t already?

I would be super down for this. What would his power be, though? He just bribes people, is a glutton, and steals his victim's voices.

well boys, we did it, toxicity is no more.

---
“That’s right, now pick him up, and go to the hook and- no, stop eating him! For the 50th time now!”
---
Like idk why they stand in the gates. They should make it if your in the exits for longer than 10 seconds it gets blocked
---
The meme is cut off should have a to be continued at the bottom corner and the next part is the survivor down 5 feet away from pallet and killer still on the other side.
---
How long have you been playing?
---
*gets grabbed*
---
Well with the hitboxes you can already be 5 feet away from the pallet and still be downed even if the killer is stunned lol.
---
Still thanks! I appreciate people like you
---
im rolling david with bloody chest(prestige) and security pants and security hat. makes me feel so strong boi and im not complaining

Christ, I’m just saying I don’t understand why people think bubba is a bad killer

About 3 months every time I play against one I get constant rubber banding when she’s near me.

SWF is really strong but if you play right you can fuck them up, Billy/nurse deal with SWF really well, if you don't play one already look into pumping one up, and swapping when you see an SWF

I got bullied this match
---
The currency to buy new characters, perks from SoS, or some cosmetics is called Iridescent Shards.  You earn them by leveling your player level.
---
You can buy non-licensed characters for 9,000 shards.  Perks from the SoS are usually 2,000 shards, but not always.  Cosmetics vary.
---
Licensed characters can only be purchased with cash or Auric Cells.  These characters perks can still appear in the Shrine, though.
---
I know, there was few comments about this but still thanks.
---
BHVR is just coded by 10 year olds.. very little consistency in gameplay on consoles (or pc for that matter) from what I have seen (2 years now).  FPS does not seem to be important to BHVR. I am at the point where I HOPE dedicated servers will fix stuff, but from what I have seen from BVHR netcode thus fair 8-ball says "outlook not so good"
---
Snares are superior.
---
Some form of advanced survivor mimicry maybe?
---
Contact Microsoft
---
Wow. This actually made me feel better lol. Was every game like this?
---
Thank you again, Zombie ❤
---
maybe swf should have these drawbacks only for higher rank players? my friends dont play dbd often and i only play killer if they dont play. I play killer only around rank 15-12 at the end of the season cause i ussually give last guy the hatch and or i let people go if they jump off the hook right infront of me. I have had no issues with swf as a killer main in the low ranks.
---
Had two matches go exactly like this today against a spirit and a hillbilly.
---
Iridicksent
---
I mean, idk what rank you're playing in but adrenaline is super common. It essentially replaced adrenaline by this point almost every match has a few of them. DS is actually a perk that needs you to be decent at hitting the skill check so that's less common but still at the bare minimum every other game has had one for me.
---
NOED is super shitty, but at the same time realistically it's not that bad. It's usually only run on wraith, trapper, etc. The ones that have trouble getting a 4k before gens are done and if you understand how totem spawns work in all honesty you can get them all cleansed really quickly. NOED is cancer when you don't expect it, you can expect it when the killer is clearly not giving a fuck about the last gen being finished ESPECIALLY if a weaker killer.
---
I also understand the argument of adrenaline rewarding survivors for completing their objective, but the effect is insanely strong. 5 second sprint burst and 1 instant health state AND it will trigger the speed even when already exhausted.
---
I expect it to be less of a problem anyways with the next DLC because of inner strength probably guaranteeing totems are not going to last the entire game most games.
---
Alright, I’ll bite. What makes it a cash grab OTHER than the fact that it’s Stranger Things? Because I know people wouldn’t be saying this with the other licensed DLC’s.
---
Good thought, maybe once you hit green rank? Or rank 10?
---
Something along those lines.
---
Looks more like a white ward
---
If the killer is nearby, quickly hide on a hook.
---
Shirtless David can bare knuckle box any killer but the Huntress into submission.
---
At higher ranks, killers are more try-hard.  They think that number is super important, and the odds of getting the hatch shrink considerably.
---
At the lower ranks, we're more chill, and more likely to give hatch to a player that impresses us, because we don't care about that number.
---
Any tips for Doctor? I knew I would get destroyed on red ranks, but even on purple I only ever get 1 or 2 kills.
---
Trapper has 20 add ins, 2 of them are Ultra Rare. 
---
So no. Try again.
---
Man, Feng looks so much like Jane
---
I usually give the last survivor the hatch if I dominated the match and I feel bad for the baby Dwight. But at lower ranks when i'm struggling the whole match I usually show no mercy. Its mostly because I'm feeling petty from ether a previous match, or someone sending me an uncalled for direct message. SO yeah, if i'm in a bitter mood i usually spare no one. Vise versa.
---
I would think something similar to spirit maybe, he could be called The Phantom perhaps?
---
Thats Jane, not Feng.
---
Good shit!
---
I don't have no mither :(
---
Goes vice versa too
---
A lot of other games use PTB too, but theirs is “Public test beta”
---
Some will use PTE, “public test environment” :)
---
Yeah the downside is He stopped being a toxic Nea
---
I’ve been up against a lot of new killers recently, so I understand. It doesn’t make me as upset as it did when I started. Just understand you were such a threat the killer threw the game to get you killed
---
Once you select 5 items from the bloodweb the entity spawns and will start to take away items in a line. Watch this video it is crucial to know before you use your points:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3r\_a9QqYTY&amp;t=166s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3r_a9QqYTY&amp;t=166s)
---
You guys really should appreciate how bhvr are constant with their chapters.
---
Last meaningful update for my favourite game was almost 5 months ago. And they never give us players any deadlines (they learned not to). SoonTM is the answer. Estimations were on late August, but they didnt hand us out preliminary patch notes yet (which happens 1-2 weeks before patch). Obviously its not the routine development cycle of adding a new chapter with killer/survivor/map, but a huge ass update with lots of content. The sole reason of me getting back to dbd was that I got bored of playing and was looking to play something else before new wipe cycle starts.
---
Love the bhvr people, they are one of the better gamedev companies out there.
---
I dunno about saving totems tbh. I’d use it at the start of the match for sure, and continue as the match goes on. I might make note of a second one I see is return to it later if I need it (and I probably will), or if the gate is nearly powered. 
---
You can’t look at it from the perspective of “oh no, all 4 survivors will run this new perk and my NOED will be useless.” When most likely you won’t have more than 1-2 people per game using it. Still, if it takes several survivors using one perk to counteract one killer perk, you can’t say that it isn’t in some way ‘fair-ish’
---
The ONLY thing I don’t like then... is that NOED is a base perk and killer can get, and the new perk to get rid of totems is DLC.
---
seriously, i was so excited for this. first day of medical college starts this sunday ):
---
Ok so why the fuck does it require me to log onto my non-existant twitter account to view it
---
Love how wraith looks like a confused toddler
---
Ey British squad.
---
The devs already said they wouldn’t want to just increase the the time a generator takes (honestly who wants that) 
---
There needs a 2nd objective that’s tied to the main objective. I know gens can be done quick but increasing the time to complete gens isn’t the right solution
---
Kindred is great when it works but I get teammates who don't take advantage of it a lot.
---
Thanks. 
---
I imagine Surveillance/discordance is useful for TP targets. I want Discord but am holding off buying Legion just for it. Hoping it’ll go to shrine but.
---
Obviously the solution is to put NOED behind a paywall /s
---
Ah, matchmaking at it's finest!
---
Make your choice transforms Fengs into Janes now. Damn that's a pretty good buff
---
I actually love this perk and whenever I don't run it, I feel like it backfires most of the time. However, the totem spawns are pretty predictable so I've been not using it as much lately. 
---
And I don't think NOED or any totem meta will exist now with Inner Strength coming soon.
---
Usually if you’re going for the proxy type strategy where you want to catch the unhook the best move is going to be downing the injured person first and instead of taking the time hooking them go after the person who unhooked them. This creates quite a bit of pressure if you can track well. You will be disabling two people at least and depending on how the other two survivors react to your play you will be obstructing possibly three or all of them which can result in a snowball. if the survivors don’t go recover their teammate in the ground you can just easily get that hook and that’s that you got two hooks but if they go for the recover you will at least get them to stop working on gens. It’s a good little back and forth and it’s kind of like chess in the since of “I’ll sacrifice this potentially in order to get something better out of the opponent. If they don’t take the bait then I’ll just take back what I was sacrificing (i.e. the hook on the tunneled survivor)
---
It really bothers me how "lower rank" can be taken two different ways haha, so confusion (although I know what you meant in this context)
---
No Face?
---
**michael scott intensifies**
---
Gas cannisters with a penalty trade off. Make it so that a killer has more ways to slow down gens *by being interactive* and severely punish camping and tunneling early.
---
They were farming you for BP. Only 1 DS and some didn’t have exhaustion perks. They were just good players
---
Im a rank 19 and im better than my rank 7 friend, if that means anything
---
You're right Iron Maiden is.
---
The only issue I have with this is a fourth of the survivors role is to be altruistic and of course they’re going to inevitably check out the hook at least which takes time from the gens. It’s a bit of a clusterfuck
---
This made me awe so hard &lt;3
---
When I had V-sync on, I was hitting great skillchecks all the time, now that I turned it off, I became shit with it. Now I'm considering turning it on again.
---
Honestly, 90% of them are completely useless
---
Meant to put she should have no collision with survivors lol.
---
Giving hatch is carrying a survivor to the hatch and dropping them on it not killing 3 and last one manages to get the hatch
---
**Calm down satan**
---
\*Yawns\*
---
Yeah.. yeah... That 100% bonus really tired me out. I'd rather have standard healing time or no time.
---
(Like why the fuck do they run? LET ME HEEEAL! Proper replace me as the killer chasing someone just to heal them.)
---
That’s just connection then.
---
While the chains look cool I think the upside down vines would look badass.
---
Can I just say this pic is fucking hilarious and scary.
---
Press F to Pay Respects  
---
I give out the hatch very sparingly the only times I give hatch is when a Dc happens screwing over the survivors or someone gets farmed off the hook I’ll give the survivor who got unhooked the hatch if I’m feeling for it. Otherwise no mercy
---
Can’t wait for “dedicated” servers!!
---
This was literally posted today.
---
If they saw this high quality meme they would forgive you
---
That's what the guy in the mask is called No Face. He's from the movie Spirited Away
---
Think of it like this: If the 2nd objective has you moving atleast, it’s better than having to stay on a generator longer than what it is now
---
Nah someone made one about wraith few hours ago
---
Who is this we? A few reddit warriors?  It fits with how the game is designed to be played. You get rewarded more if you do more.
---
Are you sure its not just her power
---
Yeah but I've played enough to play against people with all sorts of moods, so I figured there was another factor
---
I don’t get why it’s called butt rubs when the hands are very clearly rubbing the back, is it like.....just a joke or something?
---
Yea he can definitely break the pallets, or you could just not throw it down and he’ll just stand there looking like an asshole revving his chainsaw while you run another loop until his bloodlust is high enough to where have to force him to break a pallet.
---
Killers need addons and survivors dont need items. Also, most killers have actually useful addons which really helps them even if they're low rarity. Trapper's less rare addons that are worth bringing are bags, setting speed and darkening addons.
---
normie meme at this point but take my upvote
---
Dude is your middle finger ok?
---
I think this perk should trump the other perks such as Surveillance yes
---
Guess you didnt learn from the last person who said this. Have fun getting downvoted to shit 👍
---
At this point I'm done clicking on subreddit a that sound fake
---
The killer is Goldenface.
---
Just like how some perks counter things, or if people swap to Franklin's when they see heals/boxes/flashes, sometimes if you wanna beat cancer you have to switch it up.
---
It's unfortunate but yeah, it's fairly required :/
---
Partly a joke but when you heal someone sometimes the game glitches/lags and you aren’t even touching them or you’re healing their butt.
---
You missed the dominatrix event, sorry. One time only.
---
The sad real truth lol.
---
Hmmm yea maybe like 1 use per survivor. So you can save each survivor once and no more.
---
I don't think you understand the act is when there is one survivor left, after you down them, you take them to the hatch rather than the hook. Sometimes down out of respect, if they are new, or just if you're in a good mood
---
Survivors escaped. Match done. Kate dead. Wig snatched.
---
I’ve seen it where your not touching them but never the butt before so I wasn’t sure if it can happen or if it was just a dumb joke

During the age of the original Freddy Fazbear's Pizza the purple guy decide he he would lure a 4 year old he successfully did do it and stuffed it inside Tom the bunny how he is in his own room Tom's party room which had show stage and a small dining room 3 dining tables
---
Remember in the good old days the combo of self-care, we'll make it, botany knowledge and medkit? You would be able to heal from injured to full health by the time killer vaults a window.
---
What's meant to be in the new PTB?
---
I really fooking hope we have good stuff in this.
---
I MEAN STEVE? WITH SCOOPS AND NANCY WITH DRESS? WOOOOOOOOOO!
---
I make the assumption that everyone has DS; I'm just pointing out if the huntress picked up the downed savior, that would have probably netted her a hook.
---
Hindsight is 20/20, and I am pretty scrubby as a killer, and sometimes you do get tunnel vision so I'm not being overtly critical, I'm just saying that when I play I make the assumption the survivors are running DS, and in that play I would have hooked the savior if I was not caught up in the moment is all.
---
For me i just dont assume things about my team besides they are idiots. Only time i trust in them is when im in swf. My friend always runs that.
---
Quick someone remind Weezing not to cleanse against plague!
---
This isn't even a funny meme, why are you reposting it?
---
Its like prove thyself. When someone with PT is close enough to you the icon shows in the bottom right. When someone unhooks you with We’ll Make It the icon shows in the bottom right
---
No unfortunetly, it doesn't
---
Because I don’t want it fixed lmaoo
---
ye that pink sprint burst was nice
---
but decisive strike wasnt in the game (or most other survivor perks) so if you got caught you were fucked
---
went back to look and it does show up in your "activity feed," so to speak, but also where you were saying.
---
so basically bitches have no excuse for running unless the killer's right there. :P
---
I get it. So even when repairing individually, it is slower. I don't think that will work any better, since it is just making a hard change to the game, similar to saying "SWF survivors will run 2% slower."   
---
If you think a change is needed, why not something like a BP modifier the killer gets that increases with the more people are in SWF? Yeah they can teabag and flashlight you at ever pallet, but would you hate it if you kicked that pallet and got 50% more BP?
---
Happens at the lower ranks or if a killer feels bad for crushing new players. ... I have done this... Im sorry and I am not all at the same time
---
You’re literally doing the same exact thing, downvoting all my shit, so that point’s moot. Yes, facecamping takes all the fun out of the game because there is quite literally 0 counterplay to it; decisive wont save you, borrowed time in nearly all situations wont save you, and dead hard won’t save you. Here, any of those would’ve worked, and as you saw with decisive, it did. Facecamping, he would’ve been downed before his decisive had even procced. This video itself is proof that they had a way to escape because they did escape; if killer had been facecamping, then the OP would’ve died.
---
You wouldn't have survived in the dark ages of DBD. This is the best the corn has ever been
---
Excellent mind game from the wraith.  
---
However, I noticed you took the corner a bit wide, it might help if you hugged the wall a bit more  
---
^^^/s
---
Thanks for clearing it up guys. Didnt step into a single dreamsnare so that might explain.
---
Is the one for healing 50 survivors while injured also bugged? Cause I feel like I should have gotten that long ago.
---
your a dogshit console pleb lol
---
Australia I only have games of at least 150 and that's when im lucky.
---
Most games aren't like that. I've played thousands upon thousands of matches, and I've had a genuine farming match maybe 100 times. Most of which were during events for extra bloodpoints.
---
* A Killer with an high ping for you may have a great ping for someone else. Maybe he's in china or something.
---
* Someone can have a temporary lag spike or something. I had people tell me i lagged for 1 game in the past, it can happen.
---
Just dodge lobby when its high ping.
---
Same here. I'll instantly leave a lobby if its anywhere near 100.
---
I mean sure, I like the BP idea and that’s a nice gesture, but the issue is that SWF is remarkably strong, it has no negatives at all.
---
So if you’re going to use something that’s strong you should have some kind of draw back.
---
This is coming from someone who plays survivor a little more than I play killer, but I’ve seen high ranks both ways, it’s not pretty for killers sometimes once you hit purple/red ranks.
---
It still sucks lmao. Heavily unbalanced, way worse than the bamboo shoots at Yamoaka's estate even tho a Blendette can never be seen there.
---
Guys just be patient bhvr isn’t the flash
---
It won’t eradicate DCing, but it’ll make the salty ragequitters thinking twice before DCing, because they’ll be locked out longer from queuing for repeating DC.
---
Speaking of achievements, it should make them easier to get when dedicated servers goes live, because the leaving survivors will leave a “husk” of their character behind and they can be hooked to get the sacrifices, so we can assume that they can be killed too.
---
I'll tell you why this or anything like will never be in the game. You're essentially asking for BHVR to make a 2nd version of EVERY map in the game AND for every map in the future. A massive amount of maintainence for just one killer.
---
Yeah I know, I watch Fungoose (Australian streamer) so I know what you guys go through. It actually kind of sucks because you guys won’t even get dedicated servers and when they come you’ll have to connect to servers in Indonesia I think he said. You already have high ping and a long time finding games as is. They should disable rank in AUS too
---
Why did he tag u
---
Oh boy,I really don't know if that \*DREAM\* pallet is real or not
---
I wonder why survivors with garbage internet are allowed to play.
---
If you were playing as ash I think that trapper was me.
---
Ah a man of culture as well
---
It’s not really teaming, it’s mostly just a nice hong for the killer to do. Teaming would be a survivor trying to fuck teammates over while helping the killer win. Not really teaming when the survivors are escaping
---
Everytime I try to do something safe, you make it... Not that way
---
True, maybe she phases in and out of visibility to satisfy you then. Its a cool addon but there shouldn't be addons in the game that make people just disconnect as soon as they realize you have it
---
facecamping is a legit strategy when all the gens are done to secure a kill because it is stupid hard to find and chase down another survivor in so little time(unless you have noed or you are nurse, billy or spirit) also you are a toxic fuck just like old noob3 i guess thats why you made an edit on console thats a noob3 video but with no personality to care about and shittier editing
---
Did you have fun getting bullied?
---
Gotta agree with the huntress part she kind of seems like she'd be a good mother if she continued to be taught she has a certain motherly feeling to her although now she'll kill anyone
---
Nah I main her on PS4 and it is fine
---
You will get more scared as killer then survivor. But it's not that scary if you are paying attention
---
Does Freddy have like a further lunge than the others? I swear I'll be on the other side of a window for atleast a second and stilll get slapped.
---
um. Your Stridor is only rank 2 which does not effect the breathing volume of uninjured survivors, of which the Claudette was not injured.
---
Basically, you would have heard her breathing even if you didn't have Stridor
---
This post alone might have sold me on Jane.
---
Best you can do is shrug it off and re-queue
---
Considering picking up the Pig.
---
Any reason why they wouldn't put it out on a Thursday or something?
---
I would have thought it would be reversed. Did you make a typo?
---
From one Piggy to another, don’t do this shit.
---
You choose. In the menu can pick play as survivor or killer
---
For me today it was the well make it guy who saved me running away from me, The injured survivor... how the turntables
---
I play both and this shit is so lame, not fun for anybody.
---
ha only if that happened to me
---
In case you did not see it
---
https://youtu.be/6fh8c5ONQN8
---
If they get destroyed, then they get destroyed.
---
The issue isn't killers with high ping it's the fact they are the host. That's the fucking problem and I constantly deal with 150-400 ping killers in the early morning and late evenings. I can't wait for dedicated servers so everyone suffers equally.
---
Ok so you agree that the survivor dies 9/10 times, and you don't see any problem with that whatsoever. Ok so if he didn't have decisive there tell me how he could've escaped? Chances are the killer would've went down into the basement and checked lockers if no one came out, maybe he could get a super lucky juke, then what happens when he runs up the stairs? The killer can easily catch up before he has a chance, I'm literally stating how it's nearly as bad as facecamping and just saying that he got hit with karma. Normal proxy camping, fine, a talented survivor can get out of that... But basement proxy camping is nearly as hard to escape from. I'm sorry that you think that face camping is a dick move, must be your moral compass, oh get off your high horse, he can play how he wants.
---
The moment wouldn't have been at all fun if he didn't have decisive and instead would have just been stressful and annoying, where is the fun in playing an unbeatable game?
---
Ouch and I thought my rank 2. 5, 17 &amp; 12 was - They might be Swf ? Did they seem more coordinated than other survivors
---
I heard that apparently there will be 1 in sydney, so most of OCE will get around 100ms.
---
In the past it’s been on tuesdays. There’s no reason they can’t, it’s just unlikely
---
Delete this before anyone sees
---
Does anyone have a link to the image without the text?
---
If you use the Spine Chill perk then only Tier 1 Myers can jump scare you.
---
Eh, somebody that is good with Billy's chainsaw will pretty much destroy anybody. Spirit you could potentially win the mind game, Billy just looks you in the face as he revs his chainsaw
---
oh sick. Thanks!
---
Nah go prayer bead spirit, or billy, and run noed, ruin, on both and with spirit bring nurses and sloppy, and billy bring spirit fury, enduring
---
It's not predetermined if that's what you're asking, it just happens. 
---
Let me describe a scenario:
---
1. A player has a daily challenge to hit four people with axes as The Huntress
---
2. The killer secures two kills, but has trouble landing the axe throws
---
3. The killer approaches the survivors, but doesn't hit them, maybe just spins or shakes their head
---
4. The survivors tbag back in return and the farming begins
---
5. They take turns with the survivors doing gens and the killer hitting them / letting them heal
---
6. They may point or soon to show "I need pallet stuns" or "I need to hook you once"
---
7. The survivors then tbag representing it's time to begin the mating ceremony
---
8. The killer removes his pants and undergarments and kills the basement with all their BP
---
9. The survivors enter the BP bathe followed by their dominant killer
---
10. Well..you know what happens next
---
Distressing doesn't award bonus BP, only gives you up to the max of 8k for Deviousness.  Only the perks BBQ+Chili or WGLF give bonus BP
---
My guess is hes been playing without really knowing how to spend them, then when he figured it out, had all the ones he built up from playing in his game.
---
Just occasional jumpscares which are reflexive responses. It's not scary in the sense like you're watching the original Excorcist in theaters on release day
---
I don’t play toxic but I HATE face camping. I don’t care how viable people say it is, it ruins the game for both sides. That’s my issue with it.
---
Whenever it travels through a portal, it gains the undetectable status for a presently unknown amount of time, and when survivors try to break the portals, they gain the oblivious status for a currently unknown amount of time.
---
No because survivors will pop out of nowhere for no reason. Whats truly scary is when they start chasing you instead.
---
Just run DS or BT otherwise dont complain about the killer taking advantage of you not using those perks
---
 ok thanks
---
Shame, -hatchet fazes through the survivor because hitboxes-
---
OMG guys its the thunder cross split attack from the dude who failed to do it the 2 times he did it on screen but everyone remembers his pro gamer hamon strat. really miss him man ;(
---
Okay. Didn't thought of that yet
---
The difference is you can loop billy. You can’t loop a spirit. Also spirit has stronger add ons, much stronger than billy’s.
---
is that a joke, or do they actually chase you?
---
You said billy can destroy anything but strong teams. Spirit can destroy strong teams
---
Run away in *style*
---
I can count on one hand the amount of times I have done it. And even then, it was only ever done when the person on the hook had spent an excessive amount of time taunting me. At that point it was basically karma that they got face camped, and who I am I to argue with the universe?
---
I mean... scratched mirror meyers is one of the most exciting things in the game, so thanks? As a new player, that build always made me super excited.
---
I have osteoporosis
---
Bro you're talking garbage to people over FORTNITE rofl, even shamed somebody for being a console player, whats up with your search history Mr. circus?
---
hHHHHHHHHhh
---
Sometimes they do. It doesnt work and you can just kill them, but generally if all 4 survivors start running after me as killer i play along for a little bit.
---
no one cares
---
Good play. Id be furious if it happened to me lol
---
[THey've done it before.](https://www.facebook.com/DeadByDaylight/photos/a.961799927201913/2268062183242341/?type=3&amp;comment_id=2269219643126595&amp;reply_comment_id=2269323106449582&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D)
---
His pallets also have weird collision on console so if you clip partially into it you’ll know it’s fake
---
theres a meme about it, propably OP did this thinking about the survivor one
---
I'm aware, maybe saying a second map wasn't the proper term but I was using it to emphasize the difference between the upside down and rightside up. You wouldn't have to have a full second map for this to work
---
DG is "stealthed" to survivors within the normal world, and vice versa, the portals act as something that just applies the stealthed / unstealthed buff based on which "dimension" they are currently in
---
When the DG climbs down through the portals they disappear below the map, before being 180'd outside of camera view and "tunneling" back up
---
Think spirit on steroids for implementation that doesn't require anything more than adding another Freddy style filter with some mild sound distortion
---
oh ok thanks for the help
---
See people this is what one of those million matchmaking at its finest posts should look like.  You being rank 13 with a rank 13,14 14 and a rank 6 isn't a post.
---
Damn on that grind
---
Not that hard, ive been banned multiple times fir basically nothing. You have to report to get someone banned, thats why your friend is probably not banned
---
Not surprised at billy or ghostface. GF is just a straight up broken killer. The reveal mechanic is completely busted. As for billy, latency and that bullshit hitbox of his often causes a lot of frustration.
---
Maybe the devs should look into fixing it.
---
I just toy with them if they try to go for a hook save with the other 2 people trying to help by baiting or dry jumping the hook, hell I can just smash two of them (the one that will run in for a rescue the moment one guy gets hit and the first guy who gets hit, forcing wounded status on everyone but maybe one guy.)
---
I never said thank you. I'm sorry. I love you Dwight. Thank you.
---
I have been... cultured!
---
eh, it depends on time/area/platform/rank
---
ITS SO CUTE
---
We gotta get a petition for hello kitty susie now *n*
---
I guess PS4 are just trend setters because NOED has been meta on there lol.  Small game is your best friend on that platform.
---
300 ain't shit what are you talking about
---
Unless you are a ninja claudette
---
What you just said is a player (your teammates) problem, not the perk. It is frustrating for whoever gets hit and watches your teammates doing jackshit but that doesn't make the perk unbalanced. 
---
I am a solo queue player and when someone loops the killers all game, instead of opening an exit gate and sitting there, I immediately start looking for a lit totem even before the other guy is hit. If he is hit and NOED procs, I continue my search.
---
they'll ban for forcing people to farm if they don't want to. it falls under holding the game hostage
---
Pain reliever? Is that u again.... cool video btw.
---
When you drop the pallet on the same side as the killer and still get the stun.
---
Who’s opinion is silenced? This whole post is open for discussion. And yes, I view you as toxic for acting like the killer ‘deserved’ to lose because you disagree with how he played. That’s why you got downvotes, you need to get off your whole ‘civilized high horse’ shit considering your first comment basically ruined that.
---
"*Oh hey, hes just standing there! Thats cool and all-* **Wait what the fuck is this animation**"
---
It also sucks when you’re the only one doing totems. Its not the most fun thing in the world running around looking for them.
---
Also noed has no requirements. You expect to see it on a Trapper or wraith. However I’ve seen it on instasaw billys and omegablink nurses too, and this is in addition to them running a mori. All the bullshit in this game just stacks on top of each other.
---
That second part sounds nice!
---
&gt;Hopper is NOT dead my dude&lt;
---
Suggestion- I like the sawdette videos. Like to see more. Very interesting the way you make them into stories.
---
Or using myc knowing people are gonna be using babysitter

---
Still pissed at the time a Hag hit me through a fence on Haddonfield- not a vault point, just a fence
---
Nice!
---
Yea matchmaking is broken rn. Im rank 2 and just played against a rank 19 trapper wtf
---
Oh and if you're gonna main killer:Don't listen to people say noed and other perks are toxic. Bring whatever makes you have fun and get good results
---
*cries in console*
---
I wish the perk would tell nearby players that you have it equipped, or maybe nearby survivors see your aura and that you have it quipped, so they can go to you.
---
thanks for giving me inspiration to make r/ShapePalletStun
---
Imagine thinking dstrike is a crutch perk
---
Thanks, I'm good at ignoring people
---
Idk, 4 escapes bro ham. Not trying to shit talk but they did all escape. Granted, you did have a shit killer with shit perks, but still.
---
Joining a discord server is also an option. HybridPandas discord for example has a SWF section which allows you to join/find groups easy. 
---
Good luck :-)
---
I've only had one survivor DC out of all of my Freddy matches
---
I want this but drenched in blood like Susie bathed in a tub of survivor corpses.
---
for free?
---
You made an extra Reddit account to talk garbage about people for playing a side in a video game, who’s worse buddy?
---
I’m a console player too, it’s a joke

Ain’t no way I’m loosing my Gucci purse

psst

ping isn't only the killer's fault

The hag gives me heart attacks but other than that the game is only contextually considered a horror game

Otz is great. Ive learned more in the last two weeks from him than i have in the 6 months ive played
---
Playing as killer starter pack
---
K thanks
---
Hard pass.
---
&gt; And also laggy survivors benefit you as killer
---
oh boy no this is not true.
---
While that is a mechanic in the game, I totally understand the frustration!! Especially if you haven’t experienced it yet, feels bad
---
That was an update to the ptb that they’d released on the Tuesday. Full ptb’s have been on tuesdays, though updates have happened afterwards.
---
Yeah
---
Every time I've ran into one it's always the worst addons on the killer
---
Probably the only way the entity can control it
---
The real big dick move is OoO and no mither
---
I don't have anything to pay :/ so yes would been cool. I mean I can give ya a shout out on insta xD
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
Thank you man. Imma look it up :P
---
It’s a raaainbooow
---
Nope Everyone including the killer commented on it in the end game chat. He said he did not know how I got downed he thought he missed because I  was already out of the window before he even lunged and there should have been no way he hit me. He said it was the reason he let me escape because it was BS that I got downed.
---
Yesterday I loaded into the game, set pallets, found one survivor and got her down thanks to a dream pallet. She d/c on hook instantly, then her friend followed suit. This was 3 minutes into the game! I let the other two finish all gens an leave. We all got at least 27k points. It ruins the game and happens so often for me.
---
Just looking through that dude's page gave me second-hand embarrassment. He seems like a complete douchebag.
---
I reported it. Sony deleted the messages he sent and did nothing else. You gotta be toxic as hell to get Sony to ban you dude.
---
I really dont have much problem with spirit on ps4
---
So I say because someone tunnelled (which is pretty widely regarded as toxic), that they got what was coming to them through karma that I'm suddenly being toxic? How on earth do you think this shit up man. Literally I'm saying, because this guy straight up played in a tunnely way it's good to see this sort of thing happening because they played toxicly I'm being toxic? Your acting like I'm being on a high horse when I'm just saying that's a dick move. Oh sorry I don't approve of facecamping or basement camping + tunneling, oh I must be a toxic asshole. You obviously didn't read my comment either, when your comment gets enough downvotes it gets collapsed meaning people have to go to extra effort to go and read it, not only that but a few downvotes causes a chain reaction, just like a few upvotes do, meaning people who are downvoted once for having an opinion are collapsed at the bottom for no one else to read it unless they actually go and physically click on something that's been mass downvoted which most people won't do unless they are curious to see the controversy. 
---
Sorry your on such a flipping high horse, you view people that facecamp being dicks right? You said that earlier. I view this being as bad as facecamping and don't like it so I'm on a high horse, must mean you are too mate. Your arguing a point while being an absolute hypocrite, you keep coming back after every argument you say is shutdown because your stubborn and refuse to accept when your wrong
---
Came here to comment this but you beat me to it
---
Because he’s an unsavoury hombre
---
Micheal should be in the wild bit and trapper should be in the bon appetit bit(His family was minted before he murdered them)
---
Remember when Freddy was absolute shit? Now's he's the shit. My how times change.
---
Or when I see people unhook me and have We'll Make It but run away immediately anyways... What's the point?!?!?!
---
When people self care in front of you instead of letting you heal them....ohhhhh man. I'd rather get facecamped.
---
Cause wraith players are often low rank assholes
---
yeah but can you 360 a real life killer? 🤔
---
Damn, thats one sexy UI
---
No... Completely defeats the purpose of the game if the killer is helping the survivors. Why don't you just play survivor?
---
Back when the could unhook instantly knowing there was nothing you could do. Or the body blocks by awake survivors! Horrible times with old Fred for sure lol
---
**TuNnElInG tRaSh No SkIlL bAbY (insert killer here) gG eAsY**
---
Why would it be worse if they run meta perks? It's just perks you NEED to survive. I bet you run killer meta perks. Gud meme tho.
---
Not groovy
---
How does this even happen!
---
My friends don’t play Dead By Daylight very often
---
One of them despised the Huntresses lullaby and thought it was the creepiest thing ever
---
Another one of my friends hated The Pig because of the crouch and then jump scare
---
Both of them hate The Wraith, they were working on a gen together and the Wraith uncloaked behind them and they both screamed really loud
---
My very first match as killer lasted about 45 min.  I do not remember scoring a single hit.  The survivors refused to leave.  It was not fun, I did not play killer at all for quite some time after.
---
Sometimes people want you to chase them so they get points and they follow you around but its not too common
---
So you know further, they release a test build including new features for all players to try. In this case, the PTB will have the entire stranger things update for everyone to play. This includes only the new killer and survivors as well as anyone else you own. The PTB is not a place to try any killer you want for free, only the new ones will be free.
---
What would a shoutout on Instagram even do? If ya ask me no one is gonna care about a shoutout unless you have one hell of a large group of friends who enjoy art
---
You must be new here
---
What’s PTB I feel dumb?
---
That's... actually a justified DC (unless he got dropped in which case it's not even his fault) Doesn't happen often but that's not exactly fair gameplay.
---
That looks familiar too!  Or just "Beta" to make it super easy.
---
I mean if you run fast enough probably. Just fake right and go left if he swings. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Nope, been here since beta
---
Against Huntress? Pallet sliding is a free axe throw and hit. Iri head and it's GG.
---
They see a chance of upvotes they go for ot
---
I'd use noed kill the three lower ranks then stomp the hatch and destroy the last one's will to live.
---
Is this true for the PS4 as well?  I don't think I realized I had the option to play as Ghostface early.  I could have also started playing right after Ghostface was released too.  
---
Thanks for explaining all of this to me!
---
That won't help.
---
Before each chapter releases, the devs do a “PTB” (public test build) where PC players can try the new content for free for about a week before actual release. They assess whether or not powers, perks, or numbers need to be adjusted/balanced at all.
---
God these are getting lazy
---
Mr. Bing Bong
---
Oh, it's exclusively for PC. You need to buy DBD in order to play the PTB, the PTB is not accessible until you buy DBD.
---
cute
---
It's the most strangest matchmaking I've encountered. The match was over in 5 minutes, but we prolonged it, till he disconnected. What shocked me more was that he was a very young kid.
---
Not 1 hook, and when he did get some 1 down, they got up with adrenaline. Guy still got downed again, and surprisingly he disconnected. Probably the decisve strike...
---
There's no confirmed date of when the PTB luanches
---
Cringe
---
#AAAUUUUURGGGGHHHH
---
It's supposed to be Mid-Chapter 13
---
Still not as annoying as Legion and Doctor and sometimes new freddy. Best way to combat him is to use detection perks and spread far on different ends of the map.
---
*Daddygorgon
---
Mid-chapter 13 patch, where it was always planned to be.
---
maybe you should just let him hit you and get the speed boost to the nearest police station.
---
Idk, i just thought the idea of a killer that was specifically built to thrive in endgame would be kinda cool
---
You do everything slower, and his power only works on you if you're in the dream world (dream pallets and snares)
---
i’ve always thought of this

I was starting to suspect this was PC exclusive, which makes sense.
---
This dude said I tunneled him when I played Nurse on Rotten Fields. He said that he was 2 hooked before anyone else was. I went into a PS4 clip and found 3 times I hooked the other survivors before hum
---
Plot twist: you're the potato
---
It ain’t Endgame chief
---
How dare you say brown skin! Even in a positive way! Downvotes! /s
---
Yup
---
Xeno is just too op for this game and if we ever see him there, it'll be crooked and disabled version of him like it happened to Freddy
---
How do you force someone to farm lol? They either DC or bang all the gens out and leave within the first few mins, which I’m fine with. I think it’s funny hearing the people who are like I just wanna play the game and get slaughtered, and act like they farm all the time. Shit any chance I get to farm I take it and say thank you kind killer for letting me max out my points when there are 3-5 BPS burned!
---
I give them 5 seconds. When I hit five you can go heal yourself and get tunneled for all I care. I could’ve gotten to a gen in the time it took for me to realize you’re a bad player.
---
Lmao honestly! Fkn Michael had no remorse. I should of gotten extra blood points for the disrespect
---
just saying that noed is meta on all platforms so yeah slowly isnt the proper way to describe noeds popularity in the meta
---
Huzzah a man of quality
---
Payday could be interesting with insta heals
---
Maybe Jane couldn't keep all her thicc in the locker and that's the bit you hit?
---
I'd do the same lol
---
The perks I run are Spine Chill/Dead Hard/Decisive Strike/Random. Spine chill is considered a newb perk but I think its amazing, it will always give me an amazing head start in chases and it also helps me during chasing. 
---
Dead hard I use because its great for getting to a pallet or window when I need that extra distance, you can also use it to dodge the killer attacks but it can be abit glitched out when you use it this way. Its great for extending chases. 
---
DS I use if the killer decides to chase me again after I've been unhooked, it helps also if you jump in a locker with it so it forces them to either take you out of it to use it or just wait it out wasting time.
---
My fourth slot is usually whatever perk I feel like using, sometimes I use quick and quiet because it helps me juke killers in chases and react to BBQ faster, sometimes I use deliverance if I don't trust solo queue survivors or I use adrenaline or borrowed time.
---
The best way at getting good at looping is understanding how the killer is supposed to loop, if you watch videos on how to loop as the killer it makes it much easier as you know what they're going to do.
---
Unless your objective in the game is to look awesome. ;D
---
*cries in hag*
---
But you never could get caught because you had 20 second Sprint Burst, no bloodlust, actual infinites, near infinite pallets and double pallets, and no Entity window blocking
---
You had to *try* to get caught by the Killer once you understood how to loop in *any* capacity
---
Toxicity gives Pig mains a bad name, I hope this is the only time you do this.
---
Well, let's just hope that inner strength fixes all of this.
---
Ain't a plot twist if I already know it
---
"Lay the killer out" priceless
---
I'd be gone too
---
It’s the fact that every time a non-white person cosplays something y’all bring up race when it’s an unnecessary and unhelpful comment lol
---
If you click the original creator link you can see hag is in there

It really should have been "Vunerable"

Well the devs have been on a 6~ week content cycle for each major patch, which the last major patch (freddy + badham) was 5 weeks ago.
---
Commission someone on deviantart
---
And no, not for sure, artist deserve to be paid
---
They still have these games except the rank 20 is the token low rank to make squads make themselves feel better when they bully low ranking people.
---
Bing-Bong-Bing-Bong wraith isn’t top tier killer but really fun if you make him a speed boi uncloak or invisible speed demon
---
But facing billy can actually be fun
---
This could easily be a repost idk
---
Hag and Ace are free.
---
nobody is reading this wall of text, tldr please? ❤️
---
BEGONE THOT
---
How did the survivor deserve to lose tho? They didn't so putting them into an impossible situation (and before you say it's impossible if he didn't have those perks he would've died and unless the killer was dumb it was pretty unavoidable. In my eyes the killer put the survivor in a totally unfair situation where under normal circumstances they wouldn't win but then got punished for it... And how am I hallucinating, now the killer may not have necessarily been camping but there is a heavy chance they were and you don't need to stand inside the basement to camp it, you just need to stand close enough to where the survivors won't be able to escape. Every single one of your points just reiterates the same stupid point your making saying I'm somehow being toxic in this scenario
---
You don’t get any points for camping
---
It's not being toxic. He literally called them boosted. That's toxicity. I was just pointing out that there's not a lot of evidence to prove they sucked, because all 4 players escaped. How is that doing well?
---
We are gonna have double BP before it drops so just play lots of games and you’ll be at 1m before you know it.
---
I relate
---
I'm amazed there isn't more Dead By Daylight SFM porn with sound. Like, there's a lot of voice effects they could pull from.
---
This is me as survivor
---
Would the demogorgon even be considered a stealth killer because that stealth is only temporary. he's more so a map controlling killer in my opinion
---
Interesting would it be static or moving?
---
I don't know what's sadder, that he literally looped his would-be killer around a pillar, or that he had to *wait* until his bodyguards finally helped.
---
This is false. People who openly try to shame people into not playing who they want on the other hand...
---
Never do a killer smaller than hag but isnt legion smaller than hag.
---
My drawings usually take around 4 hours to design then line and colour, some of them are more simple but ones with fancier backgrounds I spend more time with so they look a little more professional.
---
He got 15k with 4 escapes without farming that’s a lot for a mostly failed game and he said that because they didn’t play well he’s not reporting them cause of it he’s just saying they didn’t play well and yeah you just went “oh you’re shit” and you’re trying to say you’re not toxic?
---
thank you I checked and it's actually called stranger things
---
I'm on PC and we made a game with the sole purpose of my testing DS. Wouldn't even trigger.

---
Bold to assume that BNP are good
---
I'd say it should move but only in a single direction once it sees the survivor, and if it runs into a pallet or an obstacle it vanishes into smoke.

It is for that reason I'm forever grateful for the End Game Collapse.

Here is a guide made by one of the best killers in DBD, ScottJund: [How to Run All Generic Tiles as Killer - Dead by Daylight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ)
---
You can't prevent looping but, what you can do is chase survivors in a smart way instead of just holding W. 
---
First of all, try to get the pallet down ASAP. Don't pause every time the survivor approaches the pallet (afraid of being stunned) or change directions completely just to avoid going near the pallet. If the loop has high walls, change directions to shorten the gap even faster while also hiding your redlight. Once the pallet is down, don't mindlessly break it, force the survivor to the side that will either push him to a deadzone (an area where you previously broke other pallets) or he will have to run past you, reducing the distance gained.
---
I’ve been experimenting with a variety of killers but I mostly play spirit. As far as perks for her, I haven’t leveled her up yet but I’ve been using BBQ &amp; Chili, Rancor, Haunted Ground, and I’m working on getting Ruin. Idk what the meta for killers are.
---
People often contradict themselves*
---
How is it a shameless cash grab the community wants its
---
There's still about 4 weeks of summer left.
---
I’ll check him out for sure ty &lt;3
---
That’s part of the point isn’t it?  Yeah, EGC is awesome.
---
Wouldn't the info go to the dedicated server, so the side that sends the message first wins?
---
Legacy skins much
---
Thanks for the tips, never even thought about pushing the survivor to a dead zone before but definitely makes sense, ty &lt;3
---
I get the reverse a lot. I'm a baby Killer who routinely gets bent over by Survivors who tend to be toxic until they realise my account level is lower than my killer rank
---
Time to submit a report, but in a ranked game it has worked fine and I’ve had to use it allot lately
---
It sucks I know ): it use to be that way I believe. But they changed it because they felt it was just extending a already finished game or something.
---
&gt; but how is the community?
---
Salty AF.
---
The game has been going strong for 3 years and I think it's picking up steam; it was first to this genre and so it's had the biggest base and staying power. Basically when the game adds a new licensed DLC it brings in more fans from other places, so it gets renewed. The devs continually improve the game/fixed wonky unfun things, and honestly I think that has kept a lot of people from leaving in frustration.
---
Also the devs bought the game rights from the producers for about $6 million about 6 months ago, they wouldn't have done that if they didn't have long term plans and see the game as worth it. 
---
But the biggest sell for me over F13 was that you don't have to sit in a match after you're dead to get half your xp. Granted, leveling up and getting blood points is pretty important, it's a lot of grinding to get all the perks you need to do your thing. But compare that to all the tim spent looking for a game in F13 and then waiting while dead is a good tradeoff of actual GAMEPLAY vs waiting.
---
Wait times, well. If you get to the highest rank, and you want to play killer, you may sit on your thumbs a while, especially out of peak hours. 
---
There are drawbacks to the F13 experience, but number of players is not it.
---
The devs want to milk this puppy for all it's worth, and the players will keep playing as long as there's a steady stream of new content.
---
It doesn't hurt that BHVR as a company made another game, Death Garden, and it didn't even make a BLIP, it cratered so hard right out of the gate, so they will want to stick with their money maker.
---
Possibly
---
Do you play red rank survivor games? Pretty sure you dont otherwise you wouldnt say that this is false. 95% of the games are nurses games, you know why? Because the killer has a broken design, ignores all the chasing fundamentals in the game, and is super super easy to use. I stopped playing both nurse and spirit as killer for this reason. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion ofc, but i will do my part to try and not contribute to spreading whats wrong in the game, sure i play a bunch of 'weak' killers , and i dont 4k every game , far far from it, whereas spirit and nurse do. But this is the thing, no ranked game has complete domination, you are playing on the highest level, the games are supposed to be hard, mentally challenging, not consistent domination and overall easy to succeed. With all other killers, you make bad calls, you get paid for it, with spirit and nurse performing bad will still allow you to secure kills.
---
Reminder dont let gander or skin stop you from cosplaying anything it only matters if you love it and always have fun it looks great
---
Well spirit is kinda out of my expertise as I suck with her but the only tips that I could give his try standing still more at pallets as that somehow works and use stridor with her as spirit kinda needs the player to hear where survivors are with the ability, rancor is ok but everything else is perfectly fine. Here's a tip for every killer I'd survivors save fast just camp because teams that rush hook don't do anything if you camp because they are trying to save but if they do generators just leave.
---
You're stretching it so much. He literally didn't call the dude shit or anything. They DID all four escape. Clearly weren't THAT bad. You're the one stretching it.
---
Eh, i don’t think it was longer than a minute. If his bodyguards were a little ways away instead of right next to him (as was normal so as not to appear weak) it would take them a few seconds to get there and subdue the guy. Especially if the emperor panicked and ran the wrong way at first.
---
Imagine dcing to freddy
---
Yes and no. Sometimes you can walk through them, other times you can't. It's kinda glitchy. I've never been able to walk through a REAL pallet though. I've tested dream pallets and at first been able to walk through one and later with the same pallet it acts real.
---
They do.
---
What month would that be?
---
What's he gonna do? Stab my foot?
---
Now you will need to level Bill up. BT, SS, and Unbreakable no longer appear in webs untill you level him.
---
Disgraceful Defeat is more of a bug if anything and completely unrelated to camping. All camping does is penalize your Chaser emblem and is completely unrelated to bloodpoints.
---
Even if that was how it worked, someone that actually knows how to play doesn't camp survivors.
---
Looked more like she missed if you ask me
---
&gt;Nothing brings me more joy than a survivor main coming over to play killer and realizing how unfun and broken looping is.
---
Looping hasn't been broken ever since they removed vacuum, reduced pallet amount and added Bamboozle + Spirit Fury.
---
I almost gave a guy hatch and it turns out he was doing the adept achievement RIP Nea :(
---
In my case she is one of the most fun to verse
---
Survivor: We're Gonna Live Forever (David Perk). Every time you safely rescue a survivor, or take a hit while someone is being carried, gives you a token. 25% BP end result for every token up to 100%. 
---
You get 1000 BP for cleaning a dull totem, more for a hex. 500 for flashlighting the killer (something you can do at the pallet). Just rack up dem points.
---
should have clarified: im the rank 12 survivor
---
And here I am looking for Play with Yout Food level 2 and constantly getting Monstrous Shrine
---
Time to go p3 claud
---
Except I didn't say "oh you're shit", I was just pointing out that they couldn't have been that bad if all 4 escaped lol. I even acknowledged his shit killer and shit perks. 
---
Why are you so angry man? Go after OP too, for being the first one to spew toxicity.
---
[Laughs in Brutal Strength]
---
I hate going against spirit
---
"mINd GaMeS"
---
Bet they are the same people who believe keys are balanced
---
Oh my god.
---
Genius.
---
I'd say the most meta build is Adrenaline, Decisive strike, borrowed time and dead hard.
---
Because shit like this is why so little people stay in the community the youtubers and players are toxic as fuck and I enjoy this game so I wanna have more than the next month to enjoy it again
---
Nice outfit! But it looks so clean. Huntress, fresh from the washbasin.
---
Clown tried to take it.
---
Because it became impossible to get them once you got common perks and since you always got low teir perks first you had to grind through everything.
---
I do play red rank games because the matchmaking is busted and throws me into the games and regardless of the top tier doing well you can still do well as a survivor in those games. Obviously the game isnt balanced and obviously they need to tweak and are still doing so as evident in the coming reworks. What we SHOULDNT be doing is shaming players for their choice in killer. It does nothing but breed negativity and toxicity and you arent above that. 
---
Just because "mah red ranks" doesnt mean people arent entitled to using the game they bought. The games ranking system is garbage anyway stop taking it so seriously. Downvote me all you want but youre the scummy person in this scenario. I guarantee you'd go out of your way to tell new players who and who not to play and give them some imaginary rule book to fit whatever perfect image you want for the game because as long as you get out or win every game it doesnt matter if anyone else is having fun. Get over yourself.
---
Late October probably.
---
That's fucking stupid. The game isn't over until it's over. Give the last survivor their 4%.
---
*Yells intensify*
---
Yup! :3 trying my hand at some digital art
---
I run iron maiden rn, it's def really bad but it's funny cuz no one expects it
---
I’m not surprised
---
hes got two different stealth mechanics. In the end it dooooes depend partially on how long he gets to stealth after traveling, but at the very least, he's a partial stealth killer.
---
I had only hooked one person, and it was their first hook. I didn’t camp or play really scummy, they just couldn’t handle getting caught I guess!
---
Sometimes I put one on a grey toolbox.  It's not great, but it's also not worthless like half the add ins in bloodwebs.
---
I swear I got 20% better at Pig as soon as I got the test subject outfit.
---
Okay... then teach OP to not talk shit on survivors he lost to, because that's pretty toxic.
---
Oh, then yeah, that makes a lot more sense.
---
Id like to see them touch Nurse/Spirit and the other MUCH MUCH weaker killers before billy
---
Either use your traps as fast as possible or start using them around when there are 2 gens left. It is riskier but more rewarding to put them on when there are 2 gens left but it is important to know that the traps are useless if you try to put them on a survivor after the last gen is done.
---
I used to play Bubba a lot, he was one of my most levelled killer at one time, I think I can still play him fairly decently
---
Is this what you mean, exactly what happened to you https://youtu.be/qiTHReT-BKk
---
With Play With Your Food, what constitutes letting your obsession “escape”?    How long do you need to chase them before you can break off the chase for a token?
---
Hahahaha YES!!
---
what a dick
---
What does getting dedicated servers mean for the game?
---
I agree, but I think what OP is getting at is that the madness he gives you forces you to feel fear and insanity, hence the constant screaming at tier 3
---
Also the survivors who be like, lets unhook this dude in front of the killer with no BT
---
I wish every super laggy game had high ping in the lobby
---
He was playing nurse. He wasn't getting looped. That's just happens when you're new to nurse.
---
You better dimidont
---
Also this
---
i mean, this does have four times the content
---
If you had deliverance and decisive and it let you attempt it on that situation it would be an automatic win lol
---
I need this I want a legion dressed at hello kitty killing me lol
---
Finally a killer to hug.
---
bruh i have school in two days.
---
Ah, the Min Dinasty.
---
I really wish Freddy had more addons that buffed his snares. Extra hindered, aura reveal, etc. The block addons are almost useless. 
---
Also I think Freddy should be able to see his own trap's as auras and not just pallets because often I forget where I've placed them and it'd help with herding survivors into them if I'm "preemptively" placing snares at loop spots before I've even found anyone.
---
That’s how I feel, I don’t think we should get to struggle but at least give us a chance to escape, it feels real bad having a situational perk not even work in it it’s specific situation. 
---
Makes me feel like I played the game with 2 perks instead of 3.
---
how have you been using him?
---
I'm 33 years old.
---
I think his power could be cooler personally, and his perks could be improved to, but for joker I love the idea of his terror radius not really giving you much info. A killer centered around never knowing where they really are is a cool idea!
---
Ultimately that's what happened..
---
Someone has a name like that I'll be sure to do exactly what it says.
---
only 15k points with 3 People dead? seems weird
---
So i originally got the gAme in summer 2017 played like 2 games and never played it again. 
---
Started playing it in june 2019 and i have it on trapper. Im guessing they just gave it to everyone who owned the game at that time in 2018 because i never remember this event.
---
I’ve used the stalk to see players and kind of creep up on them but I’m too effective at surprising them
---
Maybe a bug?
---
It'll help for sure. In reality I promise you if you just learn how totem spawns work, you could clear them all quickly and you only really need to consider NOED against slower killers like LF or Wraith.
---
NOED sucks but it's really not as strong as most survivor perks, it's just more annoying then most. I think NOED does need changes because it rewards losing, but that's also the entire reason why it has been designed as probably the single biggest crutch in the game.
---
It’s because they got caught with meta perks
---
And from my experience, I dunno what counts as meta, I just assume it’s Lithe, balanced landing, alert, and uhhh... what else... I don’t recall much other perks other than maybe prove thyself being meta. Urban evasion doesn’t matter when the killer can simply instantly turn around to see your frantically moving hiney move to a farther away tree if he walks away from your hiding spot.
---
Yes, but you’re using 2 perks that may not even get to be used. It’s high risk high reward.
---
Or the stairs in the Thompson House
---
Try looking up conjoined twin killer dead by daylight Reddit on google, maybe that will help you find it
---
I remember it being pretty good, lore wise and gimmick wise.
---
Demogorgon yells after his leap...so.
---
just walk up to them and stalk until you almost full to Evil within 3.
---
Chase a Survivor and before you Hit him, finish stalking to get a surprise insta down
---
Stalk people as much as you can to get to Tier 2. Focus on that first, and down a survivor if you get the chance. Once you get to Tier 2 you'll have to get a feel for him on your own.
---
Ok but that would be a cool killer power.
---
comedy
---
each to their own i suppose
---
Then I cut you like the pig you are while mid-slide.
---
PLEASE.
---
STOP.
---
RUNNING.
---
Get EW II asap, then stalk til youre 1 tick away from EW 3, get near a survivor and pop it, thats pretty much how Daddy Myers is played.
---
I play Nea and Claudette. Plus I play on console.
---
Without throwing away valid “but (insert complaint or question)” Explanations, I cant TL:DR
---
so I’ll just ignore those bits
---
TL:DR
---
got to rank 11 today, literally got spirit 3 times in a row, now i'm rank 12 :(
---
I can see where you're coming from, but at the same time... I'm just doing my job\~
---
Its ok lol didn't mean to spoil your fun
---
Or The Scranton Strangler
---
Looks like you couldn't grab the styptic tho. Unfortunate. There was a better way to manipulate this web in order to grab everything (2 BPS, flashlight and instaheal).
---
I bet the guy was running NOED. gg ez lmao baby killer hit gud
---
You're forgetting about the super overpowered perks that survivors can run if they want to.

It was a pretty fast game, but besides that I don't have any idea why
---
Hex: No One Escapes Glitches
---
This is why you should do bones.
---
Oh yeah, 100%.
---
lol
---
I give you my greatest piggy F to you, im sorry brother ;-;
---
Yea it just feels weird saying stealth killer or stealth at all when referring to the gorgon because it isn't it's main ability more so a side effect
---
How would that help?  If it were allowed the killers would know this. They would not leave you to Kobe. They would just stand there and wait for you to unhook. Your only possible hope would be DS, but if you aren’t near the exit, the killer will just hit you and wait for a minute to pick you up. It is just wasting time.
---
Lol what a douchebag
---
Starting with the wrong foot I see. 
---
As a killer your ping is zero, which means there is little to none lag involved so when you miss a hit, you missed it. 
---
As a survivor the killer holds this advantage so half the time you will get hit even if it looked like there was a safe distance.
---
Bing. Bing BONG.
---
I didn’t know you can get a insta down with that, thanks
---
With just 200+ upvotes announcing new content, this is not something everyone wants. Cosmetics are the easiest thing for a dev studio to produce and they can charge £8 a pop for each set. This is a shameless cash grab when the game these coms belong to cost £25! 😂😂😂 But hey, ye dumb fuckers keep buying, so I dont blame BHVR to keep doing what they are doing! Roll in the easy money folks!
---
I honestly thought he would stun the killer with his nipples.
---
Matchmaking is broken in the sense that now its not rank. Its just it tries to fill a lobby with anyone whose available
---
My idea is that if the killer finds the hatch before the last survivor does and closes it, the doors will open immediately. I don't believe the end game timer should start unless a door is open.
---
Thanks I’ll try to get the stalking down, i guess there’s a learning curve to it
---
 ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ
---
thats all his ability can lol.
---
He cant track with it, unless with certain add ons
---
Who pissed in your cereal. It’s a meme calm down.
---
Alright thanks
---
B a l a n c e
---
Honestly, I am just trying to not get downvoted to oblivion. I am a killer main myself. I personally don't consider it "toxic" because its straight up the most efficient, smartest thing to do, but guess people get upset so its automaticlly toxic in this comunity.
---
These are awesome!
---
I guess I just didn’t read the description properly
---
Everybody is talking about the regular way (and usually the best way) to use Myers, but you can also play as Jumpscare Myers by ignoring the stalk and staying in Tier 1 the entire match.
---
At Tier 1 he moves slower, but his terror radius is very small. If you can combine that with Monitor &amp; Abuse, you can have a terror radius of like 4 meters, and constantly grab people off gens
---
Took me 2 tries
---
More like "Shittier Hillbilly" and "Hillbilly"
---
Not an option
---
this would actually be great, but idk about the cold clocking part. Seeing meg lay out like meyers would be weird as shit, it would prob need to be more like an eye rake or like a stab like decisive or something.   
---
Then again... I want to see dwight in a suit clock legion. Back to the Future style
---
Ive already had my cry, the damage has been done..
---
Oh I know you will! That's why all we are going to get from these devs are endless cycles of killers and cosmetics,  that wont stop until the game becomes an oversaturated, broken and unplayable piece of shit. But hey, I just got 30+ downvotes on this thread alone today, so what do I know 😂
---
Sucks to be them, I'll be levelling up a LOT faster than them
---
I'm rank 12 and get 6s
---
IIRC Disgraceful Defeat means you disconnected somehow. I've definitely had it after a 4k so it looks like sometimes you can disconnect from the main server via a bug somehow. Extremely rare but real upsetting
---
I must of got it before they messed it up
---
I didn’t know you can keep the radius that low. I’m gonna try this way first because it sounds like fun jumpscaring the survivors
---
I would rather be allowed to use my perk and still die than to basically play the entire game with 2 perks (in my case because I had adrenaline), I doubt the killers would complain about getting more blood points basically for free.
---
No, because (like most games that run on dedicated servers) hit detection is client-side. This means that the killer’s computer determines *whether* the attack hits, and the server determines *when* the attack hits.

In most other games, like an FPS for example, confrontations typically end in one player or the other dying. Each player’s computer determines whether their own shots are hitting, and the server determines the order of the shots and the amount of damage dealt. Then once the server determines a player has died, any future bullets sent between their server-side death and their client-side death (once the server’s “you died” signal reaches them) are disregarded. Gunfights rarely end in a player ending up out of range or around a wall of the other player, so the instances of getting hit when they shouldn’t have been able to are few and far between.
---
In DBD however, the survivor obviously isn’t going for a kill on the killer. Chases are entirely made up by the survivor’s server-side movement versus the killer’s client-side hit detection, which means if the killer sees his weapon hit the survivor, it hits, regardless of how far away the survivor or the server sees the survivor is.
---
The other option isn’t any prettier, though. If hit detection is registered server-side, that means killers would need to lead survivors with their *melee* attacks based on their own latency. A killer with 50ms ping would hardly notice it, but one with 300ms ping would need to swing at the air 1/3 of a second ahead of the survivor’s model, and hope they didn’t stop change direction in that 1/3 of a second it takes him to receive the server’s current view of the survivor’s location. A killer with a high ping swinging at a survivor that just started a window vault would never hit, because the server sees the survivor is already through and away from the window; that message from the server is just in the (lengthy) transit to the killer’s PC during the swing that looks to him/her that it should’ve hit.
---
**TL;DR** - Hit detection is client-side, which makes laggy killers able to hit even farther away, but the alternative isn’t a good one either. DBD is a tough case to code dedicated servers for.
---
Sure they are. It takes the same amount of time to finish a gen regardless of how skilled a player is at looping. Switching off allows you to go after a survivor who might be less skilled.
---
U wot m8
---
You monster :( I just wanted you to notice me! I brought out my best outfit and this is how you repay me?
---
So no hallowed blight like there was no summer event?
---
damn I was hoping for a halloween event but i guess they can't do 2 events at the same time
---
So you want it where the killer is forced to take 4 DS if they want to hook a survivor more than once?
---
Because the only thing that distinguished Dart is the yellow line on his back I think. Not too much of a 'modification' to constitute it being a paid cosmetic. Maybe it can be a cosmetic for buying the Stranger Things bundle?
---
You can bet it was said in post game chat by the killer who needs NOED on Billy.
---
I'm not sure why, but the evil incarnate achievement graphic makes me laugh.
---
Actually, it’s more connection-based than hitbox-based. In fact, the only true “hit box” issues I remember are survivors getting hit by hatchets way above them while healing, and old pallet slams having a radius well beyond the pallet model. Most issues players blame on hitboxes are actually caused by lag.
---
Like a survivor sliding across a pallet and getting hit after they’ve landed on the other side. The survivor’s hitbox isn’t still on the killer’s side of the pallet or on top of the pallet, *to the survivor*. To the killer, however, latency causes the survivor to start their pallet slide later, and thus land on the opposite side later. If that delay is large enough, the killer can easily hit what they see as a survivor just starting to vault the pallet, while the survivor sees that they’ve already finished the vault and are clearly on the ground.
---
The issue isn’t the survivor’s *hitbox* trailing behind them; it’s that the killer sees the *entire survivor* (hitbox, player model, actions) a fraction of a second in the past, and the larger that fraction is (i.e. the laggier either side is), the more bullshit the hit looks.
---
Yeah they're pussy.
---
Lol nah.
---
Amen my dude!
---
Lol yea.
---
This pic makes me tingly
---
I'm just dcing when I play on a fucking corn map cuz there is nothing more unfair then that shit
---
You say that, but I'm tempted to start running Haunted Ground as my only totem in my build.
---
Yea, the only "meta" things it works against is BBQ and Nurse's. And Nurse's eats up the tokens nearly instantly
---
well, every perk should have a counter, right?
---
+ if the killer camps your body then you give your teammates the opportunity to do gens for one minute which can cost the killer the whole match
---
Right....
---
Thats a lot of exposed perks you got their chief
---
Dude, you need to practice your grammar.
---
&gt;I think the DS timer is BS becuase the killer could literally just leave you on the ground and slug you until the timer runs out. Why Does it have a timer anyway wtf
---
A solo generator takes 80s to complete. DS timer lasts 60s. If the killer is camping your body, the amount of generator progress he hopefully lost, can't be recovered. It is not the best outcome for the DS user but the damage is done either way.
---
Personally I think DS is in a perfect spot but I wouldn't mind if the timer was slowed by half while slugged, to punish the killer even more for tunneling while not removing the counter to the perk. It would also help when killers hard camp and tunnel you near an exit gate.
---
Petition to make people actually play a new character before they start bitching about nerfs/buffs
---
I’d rather go against a Nurse or Spirit than Billy. Even though Nurse is stronger, Billy still feels like the cheapest cunt in the game.
---
Oh, i wasnt saying I'm against the idea of it letting you attempt escape, I was just pointing out how the outcome could be different with those perks
---
Dont call him that. wraith is a cutie
---
No, its already strong as fuck
---
That's the risk of running the perk bighead.
---
whatever floats ur boat
---
I'd  be more happy for the upside down world petition
---
Perks should not be thought of as the factor in ranking up. I play perkless for the most part because the game has become too perk dependant and second chance dependant and I miss the purity of the pre-DS days. You do not need perks to rank up or play well. So don’t think of it as: how do I improve my perk build so I rank up, rethink your approach. Respectully, The problem probably lies in your play.
---
So that said the way you rank up is twofold: game sense and chases. Game sense meaning, knowing escape routes, understanding time efficiency, such as when you should be going for a save vs. When you should be doing a gen. Also the ability to go on reasonably extended chases without burning pallets too often or too quickly, even if you inevitably go down or the killer switches to another target.
---
Other tips: don’t be afraid to run everywhere. I can’t stand Sprint Burst users who walk to preserve it. Imagine how much more time efficient they could be running between objectives etc. 
---
I party with a variety of friends of varying ranks and they are always surprised when I run no perks and put up 24k and survive etc. It’s not hard to do, it’s difficult to master though. Learn how to run jungle gyms, the killer shack, and L-T wall combos.
---
Try to determine the killers perks as quickly as possible. If someone gets hooked and the killer comes right to you, suspect BBQ and adjust. If you’re healing and they change course on you, assume Nurse’s. Etc.
---
Always be doing SOMETHING. Be doing a gen, be running for a save, be cleansing a totem, be actively looking for what pallets are available, note where the exits are, determine the basement’s location. Try to always have a purpose. Never be the guy crouched behind a rock for 40 seconds because you heard the heartbeat for a few seconds. Do not fear the killer. You should want to be chased because it’s fun, but also because you need to possess the skill necessary to run him or her around for at least two gens worth of progress early in the game.
---
It’s called a lunge slash from killer. Different killers have difference reaches
---
Notice how I said *bought* and not *earned*? Guess not.
---
Unpopular opinion, I prefer leather face
---
So you got punched in the face four times back then. We are still getting punched in the face today, but just only once or twice. We are still getting punched in the face and have a just reason to complain. 
---
Just because it sucked more back then doesn’t mean it doesn’t still suck now.
---
I mean if im on the other side completely and still get hit
---
Who said there wouldn't be a Halloween event?
---
Then why even have a rank?
---
Not confirmed but im pretty sure its gonna be some time this week
---
This is funny.
---
But as a hag player, gtfo if unhooked.  When I teleport back I try to go after the savior, but if you're still around or your savior just zooped out...well then...I'm sorry little one.
---
&gt;Whats the point of jumping windows etc if the killer can hit me when im on the other side already
---
You just need to jump through the window of more distance, otherwise the killer can just hit you over it. Same thing for small walls or fences. 
---
&gt;*Being hit through the window is by design. A window is an opened element and killers should be able to reach through it. Players suffering from desynchronization issues will have the feeling that they are getting hit through the window when they are much further away.*

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | MAY 2019](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/63559/developer-update-may-2019)
---
No clue
---
This should be a useless perk guide
---
Discussion- guide
---
Dude I’d weep.
---
I did not. Am tired after work tho.
---
Eh. I find that most people don't cleanse it then. At least at my rank. However, some do on the off chance its Devour so I could see it working
---
He's a pretty weak killer, especially if he doesn't have great perks yet. Maybe he just wants that one kill?
---
Damn, you gave that Freddy that smoke. Desperation is the worse spot to be in if you're killer. lol
---
O ok i see now
---
Make the game fun? A killer job is to kill survivors, dont make the game fun, i y already have fun killing them, wtf is making the game fun?
---
Oh yeah, I might be toxic for doing so, but these perks are a lot of fun for me to run
---
This still comes down to telling people not to play a character just because you dont want them to. Keep giving balance feedback, dont tell people "please dont" when they talk about wanting to play a killer.
---
I meant that for when Inner Strength and the other new perks come out.
---
THE DING DONGS
