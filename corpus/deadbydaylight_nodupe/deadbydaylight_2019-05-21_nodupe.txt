Huh idk
---
I realized that a while ago but I still do it as a way to say frick you
---
Make rule set 2 default and give amanda a ultra add on that removes the roar completly like wraiths coxcomb add on.
---
Think of it this way - you've just lost a game of basketball or something and the other player comes over and spits in your face. That's what tbagging is, it's more than just pressing the ctrl button
---
They said that it will have it's gameplay revealed in the upcoming 2 weeks, probably next tuesday
---
Well according to those statistics that were released recently, swf has a +6% or so chance of winning more than a group of solos. Killers just don't like those odds.
---
I'm a console player so I doubt it's the ones in noob's video lol
---
@Fuskaka why does everyone say that a battlepass would be so bad! If you don‚Äôt want it, don‚Äôt buy it. You wanna spend $10 dollars on one skin or do you wanna spend $10 dollars for several other things. It Wouldn‚Äôt ruin the game. It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs adding cosmetics that make you invisible
---
survivor dcs should count as bbq stacks, full sacrifice points, and disallow them to join a match for ten minutes. killer dcs should count as full escape+power exit gate points and disallow them to create a match for ten minutes. we really need this implemented
---
When a survivor D/Cs on their first down before you can hook them, you can‚Äôt get the 25% BP bonus. It sucks for everyone when they do this.
---
For more PLEASURE
---
Hey, I know, sabotage it the instant it activates, never just leave like a bitch once someone goes down. But as a Killer ? Nah-ah, huge "nah-ah" for me. I can use that slot for something much more fun, useful or simply BP-boosting.
---
The *only* time I use it anymore is for end game builds (I‚Äôm thinking of Freddy, specifically‚Äîcombine it with BW and RM, and it‚Äôs downright dirty). Beyond that, I developed bad habits running it; plus, it feels cheap and I fucking hate going against it (to the point if I‚Äôm solo, I‚Äôll run Small Game to ensure the killer can‚Äôt use it).
---
Jesus.
---

---
I always look around when doing Gens when I know he's the killer. The moment I see white face, I'm GONE.
---
My point. Wick is too OP lore wise. Ash fits because he is horror, you know ordinary people.  It would be like adding in Agent 47
---
yes

Just press what ever buttton is is to run, it cancels it üëçüèª
---
Dude imagine battle pass exclusive Nea cosmetic if players are toxic already!! It would make the game even more competitive and just ‚Äúanother battle pass game‚Äù.. also I can‚Äôt thing what I would want in a dnd battle pass, I mean, there would only be skins right?
---
Solid, thanks dude
---
Yeah I realized that too. Honestly I wouldn't mind if the "Survivor locations being revealed" remained gen powered only, but the actual Exposed + Mori was changed to the exit gates being powered. 
---
I mean if you actually save the obsession for last so you could Mori them for shits and giggles I don't see that being any more "Evil" than running NOED, considering NOED activates when the hatch is closed and effects all survivors, while Rancor is obsession only.
---
Meme aside, it's really smart design. In the source material, Ghostface is inspired by movie killers, specifically Michael Myers, so it makes sense that his power is directly inspired by Michael's. I think the similarities to Amanda are more accidental, as they're mostly just pulling from his style in the movies. 
---
But yeah, 10/10 meme.
---
More so "Its toxic but just ignore it" totally putting the onus on the person getting bmed instead of the people doing the bming. I've compared it to the video game middle finger; sure I can ignore it, but I'd also be justified giving the middle finger right back.
---
You're easily my favorite YouTube channel, pal. You got me into Evil Dead and The Thing. Been watching since You're Next. Love ya! Be good people.
---
If I notice this as a survivor, I‚Äôll make sure a teammate is on one and I‚Äôm on the other. It‚Äôll take longer, but it‚Äôs better than having the killer split two or three after one gen is donw
---
As much as it would be cool it's unlikely due to hat lawsuit
---
Should also count for leather face faces! I get so triggered when they dc before I can kill them lol.
---
Mori
---
Yeah it's unfortunate but still interesting to hear everyone ideas
---
Actually I do have something to add, and it's that if they mess up dedicated servers then we're in hot water. I mean, if you've ever played KYF on someone else's host that's basically what I'm most afraid of. Survivor's playstyle can tolerate latency to a degree but killer's can't.
---
You know what else has layers?
---
This is why I dont play this game anymore...whiny ass killer mains complaining about everything
---
Damn straight.
---
Skins wouldn‚Äôt really make competitive advantages but it probably would make more people toxic.  And I was hoping there is like auric cells and iridescent shards, maybe bloodpoints as well as skins
---
I'm about there myself. I feel like as soon as I get a new game I'm into I may not return.
---
I tried, but ya, low effort me couldn't find high res pictures of the other two's faces in under 30 seconds :( so I cut corners haha
---
They're changing it at least. You're gonna have to take hits for other survivors to get stacks (like WGLF) so at least they'll have to earn it.
---
But isn't going back to the baby ranks something he'd want? Considering that bullying newbies is what he's sort of made his career on.
---
was using it on the obsession, wasn't working
---
So is nodding, *just sayin*
---
I get at least one survivor disconnecting every two matches.  No joke.
---
It's actually insane how frequently people disconnect on ps4.
---
I'm also curious. I hope it's from a comedy/parody and not an actual drama because it seems highly silly.
---
I don‚Äôt tea bag unless you‚Äôre going out of your way to tunnel or facecamp someone. I have a great video I should share of me flashlight saving someone from Freddy (which he took as me
---
Being toxic) and tunneled and face camped me. I survived and showed him what an actual toxic survivor looked like instead.
---
No. You already get a bonus to compensate for the loss of sacrifice and it does NOTHING to hurt you as killer other than deny an achievement. (boohoo an achievement that literally contributes to NOTHING)
---
Where is my bing-bong boi :(
---
I feel like one unnecessary change is the loss of all frenzy charge and a stun on missed swing. It's a frenzy for crying out loud not feral precision or something.
---
They're better than before but still.. below average I'd say.
---
?? I climb to ranks 1-5 every reset and i can attest they get worse as you get in to green and purple.  Reds i find don't do it as often
---
Hey ya‚Äôll, ever since ZombieHuggerr stopped making his sfm renders of DBD memes, I‚Äôve been immediately craving some more good old trashposts, so I decided to make some of my own, maybe for 100 days like him maybe more maybe less. I suck at SFM as I learned it like 5 hours ago, but hopefully by whenever I end this, I‚Äôll suck a little bit less!!! Thank you Zombie for all of your great posts, hopefully I can do your series a little bit of justice.

#1 song of the year
---
Yep, that's the whole reason right there.
---
Survivors lose points for it too. It totally fucks their game in terms of survivability most times, and denies altruism points.
---
Join the No Mither club instead. That is the challenge.
---
Having them tied up was too expensive? Beats me
---
I had someone say GG once when I was the killer. I said thanks but your full of shit im awful.
---
Imagine having to nod 
---
This post was made by pig gang
---
you can‚Äôt show their names
---
nice name
---
In the first movie he does say "I wanna play a game."
---
I usually wouldn't chase a survive to far. Wait for them to make a mistake or something during a chase.
---
Those kinds of posts are so annoying.
---
I know exactly what you meant. Still see no problem with it, I'm not attacking NOED, I don't care about it, to deny it's a crutch perk is kinda silly though, it absolutely does reward bad killer play. I would also argue the same logic can be applied to MoM, just hitting the survivor is not the end of the encounter, even without MoM, there are still possibilities of saboing, flashlights, pallets, distance, or just plain wiggling that can occur to deny hooking the survivor.
---
With how little I see MoM being activated in matches, or even how much of a difference it makes if it is activated in most cases, but it still being worth running for the clutch moments, I just never saw a reason to nerf it, especially since so many survivor perks are useless.
---
Yes more variety in games is good, so why not start buffing all those low tier killers already instead of nerfing survivor things. Making survivors worse doesn't make that bad killers less bad.
---
Eh, you still have a chance to hide or try to sneak around to a better spot if the killer is near after you finish those activities.
---
I dont know much about the state the game is in since I only played a bit at launch and recently got back into it about 3 weeks ago, but I can definitely tell you the community is toxic. About 3/5 games as a Killer I get flamed at the end of the match for random reasons. As a survivor I see my random teammates flame the killer after the match about 1/4 of my games. A lot of survivors are just toxic in general for no reason. I'm not a very high ranked survivor (rank 8), but in my playtime I dont think I've ever seen a killer flame the survivors after the match (unless survivors start flaming the killer first). I don't know of the toxicity dies down the closer to rank 1 you get, but its definitely a thing in other ranks.
---
You shouldn't be THAT reliant on teammates, it'd suck pretty hard if you didn't have any other ways of waking up.
---
How does one learn this power?
---
I think people will still find a way...
---
I know dude, getting team killed is one the best MOST FRUSTRATING moments I've experienced in a game.
---
Name calling, racial insults, griefing, spawn killing to purposely ruin your experiences is for me is TOXIC
---
Spamming ctrl button twice isn't, try not to let things affect you that much people
---
Dbd is one of the lesser toxic communities are there
---
Get better.
---
I mean that‚Äôs how Freddy Krueger works though lol. If you don‚Äôt have any teammates that means you‚Äôve kinda failed already, at least for me. One person escaping isn‚Äôt winning
---
(Mind blown)
---
okay pal
---
They had vacuums installed.
---
F
---
Well if Freddy‚Äôs whole kit revolves around them being in the dream state but they can easily get out of it then it‚Äôs not logical balancing
---
What? I'm not talking about your teammates being dead, I'm saying you shouldn't have to aimlessly roam around the map to find someone to wake yourself up.
---
Alerting the killer to your position is enough of a trade off.
---
I loved this sean two! ‚ù§Ô∏èüíùüíì

Lol as a devotion 5 I feel this lol
---
Konami has never had any issues whoring out Pyramid Head to the point they completely forgot his purpose as a character in the original game.
---
Chad's a trust fund baby. Stay away from him.
---
Some matches I wonder if I accidentally wore the bullseye outfit and the tap shoes.
---
Anything that gives exposed effect will counter it. Also, Billy, Leatherface and Myers can just counter it by using their power. ;)
---
**frick**
---
To be fair Saw came out far later than the original Scream so thats not where scream got its inspiration from.
---
Dedicated servers will most likely address this
---
Claudettes are *not that mild mannered.*
---
Still, pretty good.
---
Urban and object? How does that work?
---
Thank you so much for this! 
---
I made a concept a while back on pyramid head that honestly wasn't very good, this is excellent. 
---
I really hope this actually happens, konami could actually do something fun for once.
---
So where are you guys seeing how ghostface works?
---
Always love a good Huntress snipe. Nice one.
---
Even less, since it's in brutality which you may max out regardless. Whereas the sacrifice blood points that you can never max out without one survivor will always be missing some
---
What satisfying screams. It serves them right...
---
Why am I bald just because I have lost my shirt.

I purchased legion and I really really love to play him, don't care if I get 4ks or not  plus ma boi likes to pip almost every match!
---
lol oops i didnt pay attention to his mask and realized the back part isnt open to let his hair out

Why the fuck does it exist it‚Äôs just stupid

You can't have too much power, accept this nerf.

Yeah like For Honor. For Honor is a 15 minute wait, regardless of if it's your first time quitting or not.
---
A very tasty and well made croissant?
---
I guess I can accept that. ;)
---
It literally says repost in the title...
---
It does contribute to hook stages for malicious though doesn't it
---
Does missing a healing skill check alert the killer?
---
You can run a stealth doctor build using m&amp;a and calm add ons
---
I've literally never gotten a message from a killer. 
---
I have to turn off PS messages to avoid the waves of messages from survivors though
---
I got mind by burning a game offering. Even with m&amp;a I got 3 dcs and a hook, and since it was the old 4k requirement it counted. I figured it was fitting for doc
---
thanks :)

It‚Äôs still good if the killer knows you have it. Looping and got a little greedy so now the slap is coming? DH save, my pallet. Not *quite* at the window, but if you were just a hair ahead you‚Äôd be okay? DH to the rescue. 
---
Once the killer knows you have it, it can still be useful. It‚Äôs just the most situational exhaustion perk at that point
---
We're gonna live forever should let you see the killers aura
---
Switching the Dwight and the teabagger in the order here would work and fix the meme. Cause the hooked dwight is the one who is the most screwed.

You don‚Äôt play the game where you don‚Äôt hear killers complain. But your active on Reddit where all there is is complaining? Great logic bud.
---
I started playing when Michael came out on ps4 and I mained trapper for a short time then Billy and now I main Michael
---
I would say survivors should get more, the game can keep going if a survivor DCs but the game is terminated when a killer leaves. Funny enough, I had played against a basement camping spirit. I got both the guys off the hook with borrowed time and I was rocking MoM, I looped him, lost him, last gen got finished and boom DC. Could have easily gotten another 5-8k BP.
---
What does the wind signify?
---
It's on Netflix, for anyone curious
---
Aw hell yeah
---
Honest question. 
---
Did you expect that to hit, or was it a Hail Mary?
---
Idk why but I get a boner everytime an obvious gore scene comes up in AvED
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not really his ‚Äúprimary‚Äù game so I guess it‚Äôs up to you.
---
&gt; not wanting the Huntress to pick you up
---
You must not be a man of culture
---
Kinda calculated tbh, I knew where she was running so I threw
---
No shit dude. I said,that you wouldnt be able to understand the site. But still there is my proof for them punishing DCs. Not my problem,if you don't understand it.
---
I mean, not necessarily that, but it should do SOMETHING. As it stands it's a completely useless perk that just gives BPs, and it doesn't even guarantee good BP gains. You know you're going to be hooking people as killer if you're doing your job, so you get BBQ stacks. You don't know for a fact you'll be unhooking when you go in as survivor.
---
thanks
---
Yes it does survs use the best perks to avoir that to have a better chance at survival

---
Like, it‚Äôs not the act in and of itself. Similarly to any kind of social interaction, like the over exaggerated one above, it‚Äôs about the intention, context, and connotation of what‚Äôs done.
---
Yeah, through an objective lens, they‚Äôre just pressing a button. HOWEVER, through the analysis of the context, there are few strategically beneficial reasons to crouch-spam a killer. You waste time, you put yourself at a greater distance disadvantage, and the killer knows your more accurate location.
---
Most of these t-bag strategies involve baiting the killer into tunneling out of frustration. After all, a t-bag may indicate to the killer of the survivor‚Äôs confidence in themselves, or their lack of respect for the killer. Either way, the goal is to TILT the killer. If you‚Äôre in any way upset, their plan is working. We‚Äôre human, so it‚Äôs natural that we‚Äôre susceptible to these kinds of manipulation. A strategy like this could prove life-saving to their fellow survivors if they can stall long enough. Sure it‚Äôs icky, and often the people who do it tend to be fairly saline-seasoned themselves, but it‚Äôs simple meta-game.
---
Toxic or not, t-bagging brings a whole new psychological game for killers to deal with.
---
Now, as a killer main, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of these things, and I‚Äôd definitely want some way for killers to USE THEIR KIT to kill survivors who intentionally put themselves in these risky situations, rather than bloodlust m1-ing. Then again, I‚Äôm honest enough with myself to say that I‚Äôm biased towards wanting killers to consistently  2-3k to fulfill my power fantasy, so take my perspective with a grain of salt.
---
Tbag funny
---
That‚Äôs my main issue, there‚Äôs no downside to missing the healing skill check
---
That's odd. Usually Claudettes and Megs get facecamped
---
It is the saw map after all
---
Myers doesn't counter it at all, a tier 3 hit still gives a stack.
---
All hail our new king!
---
Oohhh this is it, they just need to make the swf menu be around a campfire and not just standing around.
---
Oh I know what you meant don‚Äôt sweat it. I play legion a lot so I know I can make people salty as hell. I don‚Äôt even have anything against proxy camping. Just face camping makes me a little mad because I don‚Äôt BM killers or go out of my way to make them miserable.
---
I play a variety of survivors and it‚Äôs been happening quite a bit lately :/
---
&gt; Killer mains like to espouse that Surviviors are sensitive toxic crybabies yet leap at every chance to victimize themselves in just about everything you'll ever see. It makes me feel ashamed to play killer
---
Honestly, man. It's both sides. I don't think you should feel ashamed to play killer or survivor. Just play what you like, and don't worry about the way other people act. If you see a toxic player, why does it matter what side they're on? It has nothing to do with being a survivor or killer main, a toxic player is a toxic player.
---
Neither do I and yet when I play Survivior it's often done to me. Although more often than not it was done likely bc I was Laurie and the killer probably knew I had DS.
---
"Fun isn't something one considers when facing toxic survivors. But this... does put a smile on my face." 
---
-Freddy probably
---
I believe they touched on that in a dev stream long ago.  Something about it being P2P that makes it impossible to reconnect to a match.
---
I‚Äôve stopped running DS and mettle because of killers being toxic about it. I know play what you want, but I don‚Äôt want killers to be pissed about multiple people running it.
---
Does anyone really main Hanzo anymore either?
---
fuck you
---
I don't play Survivior for the killers enjoyment. I play it for my own, so I personally give 0 fucks what he thinks about my perks.
---
Yea, they mentioned something like this in the last stream. They won‚Äôt address DCs until they get dedicated servers. It‚Äôs just wishful thinking :p
---
Ik was just pissed
---
&gt;The community isn't toxic

---

---
Also, use Object like Premonition or Spine Chill.
---
I know some games utilize a quitters queue, where if you do it frequently enough you just get put into games with other quitters.
---
Given that killers seem to dc less frequently than survivors, I dunno how well this could be utilized.
---
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thegatso
---
I didn't make it m8
---
Hell yea man same here. I honestly couldn‚Äôt careless if I get a 3K or 4k, I just want the game to end. EGC is a blessing.
---
I would love to be able to sell map offerings.  I never use them. Or buy build specific addons for bloodpoints

---
Lol if anything was toxic at all in this video, it was the nurse bringing the Meg to the exit gate just to Mori them. 
---
Hits at the exit gates is free points for everyone.
---
*yknow this was a pretty fun match, maybe I should message them afterwards sayi- oh, hang on. They're slapping my corpse repeatedly. Nevermind*
---
I mean, [this ](https://www.amazon.com/Straight-Mahogany-Handle-Sawtooth-Carrying/dp/B01604HO4E) isn‚Äôt exactly it but it‚Äôs pretty damn close. It‚Äôs called a straight razor and they are pretty efficient for shaving. If you aren‚Äôt careful, you will definitely cut yourself.
---
That's fake as fuck.
---
&gt;At best, she‚Äôs on par  with the Wraith now and it‚Äôs quite arguable that, after Freddy‚Äôs rework, shell be the worst Killer in the game.
---
That's such a weird statement to me since I don't think Wraith is even in the discussion for worst Killer since his rework. I actually think it's Clown's, as his Power for the most part has no net effect. Freddy's pretty bad, but at least he wastes a little time and finds Survs easily.
---
The icon does appear at the start of the match.  I've been the DL obsession before.  I usually go full stealth on matches like that.  By the time I'm caught, there's only one or two gens left.
---
Oh yeah, I know of and heard of these. I'm talking about his default knife Madame Butterfly
---
It is to stop the generator progress from regressing. It honestly really doesn‚Äôt really matter in what order you do it in, but some people do it before the unhook so that the notification that the killer gets comes after they gen tapped. But yea the killer also has to take time out to kick it again as well.
---
I hit level 100 a few weeks ago, and I actually had to look up what devotion does because the in-game help guides say nothing about it.

Really? Has the opposite effect on me ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
If I can‚Äôt wake myself up with a failed skill check then Freddy shouldn‚Äôt be able to see my aura outside of his terror radius. You can‚Äôt have it all.
---
Girl when‚Äôs your next album
---
Strange they changed it back. I thought the reason for changing it was to help stop survivors from instantly going full immersion or DCing at roundstart and make it a surprise when you heal someone and THEN you get the Dying Light icon. 
---
It's been like that for a long time IIRC, IDK when it was changed back to you being notified the killer is running DL at roundstart.
---
P3 ASH x baby dweet üòÇ
---
I mean, I've seen him do it even on gens that weren't started yet.  That was the confusing part.
---
I actually don‚Äôt think either should be a thing. A teammate waking you up or getting hooked should be the only way to wake up and Freddy shouldn‚Äôt be able to see your aura. But again I just started playing him so his balancing isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm great with
---
it would encourage buying other dlcs, and the majority of players who would buy the battlepass have a majority of the dlcs.  Plus adding auric cells at tiers would encourage people to buy them and not have to spend money on them. But your opinion is yours I guess
---
A long time ago, the survivors never got a notice they were under the effects of Lullaby.  That was great, it made Lullaby a devastating perk because nobody expected it.  So I'ma guess they fucked something up again and survivors now are notified IMMEDIATELY upon being a DL obsession.
---
So Yes then he's evading a ban? Or No he's using old footage?

---
Agreed. I have zero idea as to why FF simply dies out the moment you swing and miss. In his introductory video, it literally states that missed attacks during FF have a shorter cooldown meaning that it's supposed to emulate a person swinging like they're crazy.
---
Good format but dwights can hardly hit generator skill checks how do you expect them to hit decisive?
---
If you‚Äôre playing swf it‚Äôs actually better since you buy a lot of time for your teammates. They can maybe do some gens and save you( if they have bt or you have ds). Just think another way around.
---
Wraith most likely. The woosh is what accompanies his transition into the spirit world, aka his invisibility.

---
i'm with you there, and it's why I've started playing less and less survivor . It's not fun for anyone and a waste of time. I just have a list and every turd who DC's I just add their name to it so I know to dodge them.. which works fine unless they change their name but I'm too lazy to run MLGA.. so that's my work around.

I was once called a pussy for downing everyone, I‚Äôm sorry you idiots all tried to swarm the person that I just knocked down? Some survivors are just so brain dead lmao.
---
Yeah, Sean is a pretty awesome guy.  ‚ù£Ô∏èüíû
---
I don't love certain ones but I absolutely hate Claudette's, I'll tunnel a claud if I hint even one ounce of bullshit from her.
---
 
---
example: tea bagging, flashing me or just trying to be a hero xD
---
Sean is my wife‚Äôs boyfriend and I love him dearly aswell. Thank you for the kind words that I will shorely pass onto him.
---
"Would you camp me? I'd camp me."
---
I tried to find the original video of this, I really did. I am at failure.
---
Just because not all react the same doesn't mean they're not the same in principle. They're both easy to do, unreasonable actions meant to show immense disrespect to your competitor.
---
The problem is, no one tells you to shut up and get over it if someone spits on you. Maybe it's online anonymity making it seem less of a deal than it actually is, but people getting annoyed or upset from it seem more normal to me than those who just accept it. You're never going to get rid of it, obviously, but there's a big difference between tolerating the few cases where it happens (but discouraging it overall) and accepting it so openly that it's commonplace now, like this community has
---
So why not have the slugged survivor be killed instantly by the entity then?
---
I only face camp if they‚Äôve wasted my time being toxic, if you‚Äôve t bagged me at pallets and looped me 7 times, when 4 generators have been done, you‚Äôre SO going to die. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
you get shit point, and will either be lucky if you saftey pip or don't depip because the quitter bonus is garbage.. but hey.. you do you boo. If you are so desperate for any sort of win you think 2 v 1 and 3 v 1 games are fun.. knock yourself out.
---
[Sobbing] Please don't eat my ass, Spirit!
---
Good for you!! Who needs monogamy anyways?!  Glad to hear we feel the same about **the** Sean.  Just be careful of the currents if swimming.
---
Thanks bro! I tried to main him before the nerfs but after the nerfs came thru he just feels like a useless killer, I can‚Äôt even stab everyone and everything now ya know.
---
I just want a werewolf killer.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm fucking terrible at art so I had to use all my brainpower to think of how to make her legs look normal as well as her arms haha
---
Cause then that ruins the entire point of end game
---
Whoopdeedoo I got none of those lmao

^I was making a joke because the original comment said ‚ÄúI love this seen‚Äù but he edited it and ruined the joke and now I get reddit linked :(

Correct me if I'm wrong but survivors already have the disadvantage of a player disconnecting and the killer should gain from that?
---
P.S Feel free to call me a Salty Survivor Main
---
Onions
---
What's the point of adding cells if they are used for items it's pointless really I perfer the way they are doing it now for now they should focus on gameplay and adding more challenges for both killer and survivor like a secondary objective for survivors that the killer can prevent them so that would be better most devs should look to making the game more interactive over monitization first considering they are able to keep afloat with their current monitization
---
Every time....
---
But wouldn't that remedy the issue of being slugged for 2 minutes?
---
It would technically, but it still runs the entire point of it. The point is that survivors have 2 minutes to attempt to escape, not that shutting hatch is an instant death
---
Yeah it sucks
---
Will do! Enjoy your sour grapes. :)
---
Yeah obviously everyone would like secondary objectives but the games been out for almost 3 years and it doesn‚Äôt look like anything new is coming, adding a battlepass is just like adding a new group of cosmetics.  I‚Äôd prefer more events, more killers perks and new innovation before a battlepass but it would be fun to grind towards the final tier and certain tiers.  Right now I have all my survivors lvl 50 and my favorite survivors p3 and maxed out along with most killers, I just play for fun but it would be fun to work towards these things is all.  I don‚Äôt think adding a battlepass would be toodifficult in the first place
---
Nah console has enough quitters we don‚Äôt want more, put them on switch servers when those come out
---
Oh I know. I used ds and mettle a lot. Just have been switching it up lately to see if a different build works better (plus tired of the toxic messages lol)
---
Pretty easy solution: They just have to wait longer for each match for the few killers that do DC :)
---
Very nice use of the tv show OP!
---
Monto actually has a cool personality to listen to while he plays his game, so yeah, i can agree he does have more audience retained in other videos that aren't DBD
---
Love the daddy Myers creeping back there.
---
And you try to content yourself by thinking that at least you got some altruism points...
---
I just want another season man we should do what the guys did for Lucifer so Netflix picks it up
---
Pretty more common with The Spirit...sometimes you don't even see it coming.
---
I‚Äôm all for Candyman to be in this game but I think one of his perks should be he can put bees in lockers and when opened it downs the survivor and notifies Candyman.
---
I still disagree it doesn't fit mainly as challenges to do for a battlepass would be severely limited (like hook this ammount of survivor do this ammount of gens break this ammount of totems) not really anything to challenge you that's what I want first before they think of a battle pass for example one thing is kill all 4 survivors with no perks or addons. And again I don't want cells to be in the tiers or blood points as blood points are very easy too get. Iridescent shards I'm fine with as you get so little unless you have a very high devotion
---
Hahaha
---
so did everyone, the meme is well known
---
It's just bloodpoints, dude. That's not exactly an in-game advantage.
---
This doesn't even make sense

I think it would be good for the game because I never do my killer role rituals.
---
You don‚Äôt crouch around the map with it. You use it to crouch hide from the killer when they‚Äôre close. It‚Äôs quite useful for getting out of chases and evading being seen.
---
I will always let them heal until they blow the enormous heal skillcheck then I‚Äôm out

I was camped and tunneled on one hook by a terrible rank 15 huntress, and honestly I‚Äôm still absolutely livid about it, rank 15 killers and their bullshit.

But seeing you all smile and be happy makes me happy too. Right on!

Susan Wojcicki.  Her power will be Demonetization, drain survivors of money so they starve to death.
---
Plague &amp; Clown above the Spirt? 
---
I have to laugh.
---
No, that means they won in their minds
---
God this is accurate
---
You do? Tell my teammates that. They play like it‚Äôs optional
---
Fire Up OP please nerf.
---
I think it's fine the way it is. I have zero desire to play survivor, it simply isn't enjoyable for me. Why punish players who only prefer one side by decreasing the overall points, and instead simply split the rituals (one killer and one survivor ritual per day), and reward those who choose to do both and expand their horizons, and hope to inspire those who normally play one side to try the other if they want extra points.
---
just had a match with the nurse where 2 people disconnected so i let the remaining 2 do all 5 gens while i practiced blinking
---
3 in 3 :^)
---
I disagree, but only in the sense that the gameplay facilitates a lot of safety in the survivor team.
---
In general, this game is designed so that someone gets fucked over and ends up getting jaded. Too many mechanics give too much leeway for getting cheesed, whether you are survivor or killer.
---
Just normal trash talking bro. Sometimes you're the bird, sometimes you're the statue
---
I would‚Äôve raged quick. Being honest
---
oh she did right after the video cut lmaoo
---
üòÇ me &amp; her would‚Äôve been on the same page. I would‚Äôve even rage quit if I seen the axe flying across the map
---
Tier 1 myers*
---
Yea, you rage quiting is exactly what they want.
---
dbd cosmetic store items are worthless. exclusives show your dedication to the game
---
Lol, it's always good playing Huntress on console. I get messages like "Good arm holy shit" or "nice Hatchets" and it's always nice to down a tbagging survivor lol
---
As a followup to Question 4, I imagine they're going to keep the feature of canceling games with less than five players. So everything relating to that is probably gonna stay the same.
---
You're the only one that loses anything, by doing that.
---
You lose bloodpoints and they want you to DC. You give them what they want.
---
(G)ood (G)ame (W)ell (P)layed
---
It just depends on how serious each player is taking the game lol
---
These are actually sick ideas just for memes on most but still
---
 I'm digging Candyman. Very cool concept.
---
Ohhhhhh
---
What console do you play on ?
---
What you think: "serves u right haha"
---
What they think: "LOOOOL AND THEY RAGEQUIT OOF"
---
Yes because a 3 man game is horrible but I also expect once dedicated servers hit that punishments for dcing will be more severe. Like someone joins then dcs all the time when they get downed first I'll be so happy when that happens because when I play killer and someone DC's because they went down and can't use their deliverance
---
Uh no we don't want them either
---
What is SWF survivor?
---
Killer playing the game vs Survivors bming?
---
I know what you're talking about, but the way you wrote it makes it sound like you're mad at the killers for doing their job.

Fix piping and ash's face. Add more objectives to this game. Cheaper cosmetics. Peace!

Is there a way to see hours played on ps?
---
There's a glitch that shows the BP gains from your last game when there's a DC.
---
You get punished by having your time wasted and not being able to play out a match.
---
Gotcha
---
Looking forward to the Freddy rework 2019.
---
xbox, you?
---
This is exactly right. It feels like both sides forget that theyre playing the same game as the other and that everybody is here trying to have fun. Getting easy wins and getting shit on hard are both part of the experience of playing, but bm doesn't have to be, and people acting like its nbd might as well call slurs mouth noises. If it's not a physical punch, it shouldn't bother you in the least bit ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I'm almost six foot tall :)
---
I‚Äôve been waiting
---
I use em but dont really go outta the way to buy them honestly
---
I've played a bit more Pig and don't have much hard data on what survivors do what, but after a short stint as survivor I can confirm that a lot of trappers seem to be BM as hell.   
---
Can't vouch for the others, though I had a seethingly toxic Cannibal in one game, dunno what they are in general though
---
Hanger is just better head on
---
You already get plenty though you literally get a compensation bonus. Survivors get a nail in the coffin and no compensation. I am chill. Love how staying logic and fact is always met with ‚Äúchill bro‚Äù and downvotes.
---
They shouldn‚Äôt be an ultra rare anymore.
---
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Ok wait wait wait. Ash defeated Hordes of Zomboes and Demons. Wick has been luckily saved by others, on multiple occasions.
---
I do.
---
Imagine thinking Huntress and Hag are worse than Clown.
---
Hag has better chase potential than clown in areas with traps, which you should always have, and has an enormous map pressure, and Huntress does damage instead of slowing down, rendering some loops useless, at the cost of being map dependent.
---
If survivor points at you (and your killer), it‚Äôs typically a taunt.  Even if they point at themselves.
---
If the they duck repeatedly At the exit gates (or after you make a mistake) it‚Äôs equivalent to laughing at you.  Known as teabagging (aka another for mom of taunting).
---
I just got the achievement the other day. I used the electrode for 75% longer range with the purple calm notes that does well with monitor and abuse. Good luck dude you got it.
---
Are you looping them around for a long time? That usually gets killers mad
---
I mean yeah. I‚Äôm pretty good at looping, but I don‚Äôt get how it‚Äôs considered toxic. It‚Äôs like the best way to evade death.
---
explanation?
---
Janes not thicc enough
---
.......*the fuck is this?*
---
Are all your characters P3?
---
Ps4
---
Imagine getting butthurt over in-game bm. 
---
It's like getting angry because the killer nodded at you.
---
Today I feel... like butchering a meme.
---
No, but I find the grind to get them there mind numbing.
---
Corrupt Intervention is only useful with whispers or using Hag or Trapper.
---
People can just hide during the 2 minutes, searching for totems, rendering the perk useless, if you use whispers, you might find someone, but now they are working on gens, rendering corrupt intervention just mediocre at best
---
Hag doesn't really needs it, but can make set ups better, while Trapper is the one who most benefits out of it.
---
Didn‚Äôt say it was toxic I do it too lol but yeah killers will usually facecamp if you loop em for a long ass time. I understand them, i hate being looped forever on killer lol
---
I mean, what else is the counterperk to Adrenaline?
---
Had 3 killer d/c tonight. 
---
Since you seem unaware, they keep the points they earned up to that point, as well as their items and a killer d/cing is literally one of the most sought after rewards plus as an added bonus you're doing it all on purpose thinking you're hurting or upsetting them. 
---
Killers are so fucking lol
---
I know, just I see a lot of people on here call looping toxic. And tbh if a survivor is looping me hella hard, I just fuck off and find someone else. Not gonna waste my time chasing someone while gens get rushed.
---
:( feels bad, man :(
---
You sure you keep items I swear I lose them when a killer dc
---
Nice
---
Try using a random perk wheel to keeps things interesting
---
I love how he didn‚Äôt reply
---
Try going for achievements
---
why are you so adamant against killers getting the bloodpoints they've earned? the amount of bloodpoints a killer gets in a trial has no bearing on the remaining survivors' performance in a trial.
---
Need to sign a petition to get a fourth season
---
How dare you
---
bruh when she fell üòÇüòÇ
---
Pre-nerf legion
---
Well how do you normally play
---
Thank you
---
I use a characters perks, and self care or ruin (starting to branch out from that though) and usually end up getting chased for long periods of time or defending gens as killer.
---
My mom
---
~~yes yes I‚Äôm leaving don‚Äôt push me out the door mods~~
---
That‚Äôs some gooooood tea
---
"When the exit gates are powered a swat team busts into the killer player's house and arrests them"
---
Head on was the first thing I thought about when I got jane, cause it was literally perfect for Sydney. It made me kind of sad how fitting it could have been honestly
---
Oh im sure they will. But I believe making it less convinient will stop at least a few attempts
---
It's the last trophy I need on PS4 to get platinum, I'm literally always 1 pip away too. Even when I get 4ks
---
Honestly I'd respect the kobe if I got everyone else. Maybe fake chase. Idk. Every time a killer disrespected a 4% base chance I got as the last survivor I felt personally victimized because I don't play like a troll I don't use flashlights I don't teabag. There's very few situations where I let people go but a kobe is one of them. You know, unless they're a dick.
---
Neat.
---
We are playing a 3 man swf group,  we aren't toxic,  we don't all carry flash lights, no insta heals, don't t-bag or any of that. 
---
We go in against the hillbilly,  with the majorly overpower bbq n chilli. Literally one shots everyone before we can unhook,  have time to hide,  or even touch a gen. When we could hide he just stayed by the hooked survivor.. 
---
Like we didn't get to do a single thing all game,  and yes because he was good and had a OP perk. For sure depipped from rank 1.
---
Only leatherface, freddy, myers and pig have movies

---
Person of interest
---
Person of interest.
---
&gt; Agree, could use a ‚Äúquitter bonus‚Äù like killers get.
---
you mean besides keeping all the points and items you earned prior to the killer DCing.. please.. I'll take that over some shitty ass "quitter" bonus that's just a flat amount that doesn't amount for shit
---
Repost? And why would it not work?
---
1. yes
---
2. No. If killer's lagging server doesn't have data to show you his exact position. So you'll still see teleporting players. Difference with p2p play will be in that in case of severe lags the killer's game will be as unpleasant as survivor's.
---
3. Most probably no. The main factors for long wait times are the number of players and killer-to-survivor ratio. Both of these will not see a big change after a transition to dedicated servers
---
4. No, what's the point?
---
The first one should not have hit but that second one was amazing
---
Even with BBQ and Chili, he still has to chase and down you, so if you're getting downed instantly, you just really suck at running. But about BBQ and Chili, you can fake it out by going one way then going another after 4 seconds. Or even easier, get into a locker after he downs someone. You can't see auras of people in lockers so BBQ and Chili won't do anything.
---
Actually, yeah, visit /r/PerkByDaylight
---
In hindsight, I would make it something like a 30% chance of success rather than a skillcheck, since I conceived it as a high risk/reward perk. If you fail it's a free grab, if you succeed you get a little more ground; something you would resort too with no other way out. Making it a chance would be in the spirit of that.
---
I highly recommend Evil dead 2 as a first watch. It‚Äôs basically a remastered version of 1 and imo the best of them all. Also, technically in game Ash is based on the Ash Vs Evil Dead show, which was also really good. It‚Äôs all kinda campy horror.
---
I love you
---
I remember seeing something like this 2 weeks ago with litterally the same abilities. And it doesnt work because its too much. All he needs a shorten timer and no affects from pallets till fullu in the dream world.
---
I believe it only sucks if you hold it, using it liberally helps a lot. Sprint burst over to gen, start gen, spring burst comes back, gg. Great against stealth killers, Pig, Wraith, M&amp;A Myers, probably Ghostface.
---
It‚Äôs not the best but it‚Äôs still better than 90% of perks.
---
Idk I do it because I feel cool
---
I just thought of this on the fly tonight. Didn't realize someone else had the same idea
---
Anyone without a terror radius. Jump scares galore.
---
&gt; why do i have to wait 5 fucking minutes to get into a match as a survivor?
---
Not enough killers, simple as that.
---
Fuck Starz. enough said.
---
I agree so much
---
Sprint burst is underrated, just because people suck and walk around doesn‚Äôt make it useless, it‚Äôs great for getting around the map and comes back fine while doing anything, healing, gens, etc. 
---
Love it because I hate stealth killers and don‚Äôt wanna get cheap shot by a wraith.
---
The Spirit with prayer beads scares me beyond belief
---
&lt;3
---
Prayer beads spirit routinely makes me shit myself despite a few thousand hours in the game.
---
The Hangar seems just a Head On without counter play, no reason to take Head On instead of this perk. 
---
And Not In My Movie will be useless against any killer without NOED, so it will be too situational. And almost nobody uses aura reading perks.
---
they knew they would have to so i don‚Äôt even see why they added it in the first place
---
If I get bored as killer, I play a jump scare builds: Myers (Scratched Mirror) / Hag (Mint Rag + shackles), Spirit (Prayer Bead), Wraith (cox combed clapper + All Seeing - Blood) usually on Game or Lerrys. Just don‚Äôt camp (especially with Myers) otherwise they will DC quicker. I have fun knowing where survivors are and making them panic (like a real killer). Survivor is a little harder to change it up, you can try a sabo build, no mother build, but really it isn‚Äôt too fun. If I want to have a little more fun as survivor I just bring a map with glass bead and shit light beams as I run for entertainment.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, is that supposed to be Dwight in the back? Cause hot damn give me that skin.
---
disconnects shouldn't disable/enable obsession perks/
---
Deja Vu is the real crutch perk, change my mind.
---
\**pig roar*
---
What perks do you ?
---
To be fair, survivors aren't being punished for doing their objectives.  They're being punished for not doing their objectives (totems).
---
It's taking me a long time to find games where the ping isn't yellow or red. Finding a green bar game is rare. It's weird, it wasn't like this 2 - 3 weeks ago, but now it's becoming worse. I think BHVR's new algorithm is still being fine tuned
---
when you get face camped and a survivor is just crouching nearby not doing anything productive .
---
–ù–µ. Ash is horror. Wick is Action. Two different genres. Think more like this, Ash isn't a trained anything, he just became a hero. Wick is a trained person.
---
Better yet. This is a horror game. Someone with any kind of fighting skill, especially like Wick, would not be thrilling. It is about ordinary people doing their best. Before you mention Bill or Tapp, Bill is old und not in top shape. Tapp is semi retired und also not in top shape.

Everyone died so I ran for the hatch got chased when I finally heard it so mad dashed to find it I was downed mere feet from it. He closes the hatch I get up and am caught. Get up again and lose him so attempt to open a gate. He finds me and I gave up on wiggles.
---
Here's one of my better jump scares on a streamer lol. He dropped a deuce in his pants lol
---

---
One cool perk would be that, after stunning the killer with a pallet, she gets 150% movespeed and suffer from the exaustion effect, since she's always stuning Ghostface in the movies and running away.
---
But thats the point of devs, noone wanted to play killers for a long time so they made killers earn more to balance it out.
---
The problem is that people shame others for getting upset over bm more than they shame people that bm, which is backwards as hell.
---
No this can't be real... on God??????

&gt; BM-ing is a part of pretty much all pvp games
---
It doesn't have or need to be. 
---
&gt;dbd's community is the first I've seen to get so genuinely angry because of in-game bm.
---
I'm inclined to disagree considering the push some game developers have taken to reduce toxicity, with things like chat bans or even game bans, as well as report features including toxicity as a reportable behaviour. 
---
And even ignoring the teabagging, I've found DbD to be one of the more toxic game communites I've been a part of. At least in my personal experience, which I know is only anecdotal. But still, it's genuinely one of the few games I've played where at the end of almost every match, someone is shitting on someone else.
---
Thanks alot for the tips. And i agree with your points and will take them into my next work.

Thats why i posted this i wanted to see what part poeple liked of my shitty content xD.

But thanks for the advice

Because you literally ALREADY get compensation for it. It doesn‚Äôt hurt you as a killer. You don‚Äôt need BBQ to earn points. It‚Äôs a choice to run it. And honestly, getting those bonus points with it is just that. A BONUS. It‚Äôs primary use is to see survivors auras from a certain distance when hooking another survivor. It‚Äôs for scouting. It‚Äôs not that much of a loss, and you can just ply another game for the bonus. Why should you be compensated for something that does nothing to hurt you in literally any way? Why should you be doubly compensated while we aren‚Äôt. That isn‚Äôt balance. I understand it sucks to not get a bonus, but maybe don‚Äôt rely on a bonus for all your BP. And again, just playing gives you Bp. We all have to grind for it. That hasn‚Äôt and won‚Äôt change. To earn that stack you need to hook someone. Who‚Äôs to say they wouldn‚Äôt have been saved while on your shoulder or wiggle out anyways? A survivor DCing is far more annoying and detrimental to other survivors than it is to a killer.
---
He jerked pretty good lol
---
And then the killer be like "you're the most toxic survivor ever ".
---
Hag (Mint Rag) &gt; Myers (Scratched Mirror) &gt; Spirit (Prayer Beads) &gt; Wraith (Coxcombed Clapper)
---
So then you see him as a Killer
---
OH MY GOD YOU ARE SO FREAKING RIGHT legit this Reddit is ps4 endgame chat shit talk WE DONT CARE WE JUST HERE FOR THE MEMES
---
Took me like exactly 17 minutes to get into a lobby on ps4 for the killer to disconnect. Getting tired of it at this point :(
---
Chad would leave you on the hook and BM the killer at the exit gates.
---
*Chad* would call you a noob ggwp lmao
---
***ChAd*** would sell your child for a bag of limited edition M&amp;Ms

*Don‚Äôt pick a Chad*
---
Please eat my ass Spirit

The exact moment i read that my stomach gurgled and made that sound
---
That is amazing
---
Nurse's, Ruin, Whispers and BBQ is the meta, I like to run Enduring or Knockout over Ruin tho.

Hi! I zipped my perks into an archive for you if you wanted to test them. https://www.dropbox.com/s/fj6v714unt4k81m/Perks.zip?dl=0

The path file is;

If you wanna reset them just verify your game files and it'll restore everything.
---
At least someone understands when a joke is over used
---
B O I
---
It's not. It's getting nerfed. Just play Billy Huntress and Nurse until they fix it.
---
Thank u !
---
Automatic de pip plus an additive time out that doesn't go away until they complete a certain number of games. Would make the game better for literature everyone

*Give the Nurse instadown already, this game is fucking broken*

learn how to crop and image &gt; make a meme

Only if killer DCs give the survivors points

Which is an inconsistent objective. Gens are reliable, but playing solo? No one does totems. And it‚Äôs kinda impossible to do them all whenever every teammate is dying in the damn basement when no gens are done. Not even a totem counter.
---
I think we will have the answer for that in a couple of weeks

its...not toxic?

You tell that to the people who DC after being downed or the people who call you homophobic slurs and tell you to kill your self in post game chat.

or the people who shame you for using perks, offerings or items in a videogame

This game is BUILT on toxicity, and learning to cope with the harsh reality that not everyone is your friend.

The rest of the killers don't have movies of their own, they were created by the game developers themselves, while these ones I mention came from pre existing movies
---
Since they're gone as soon as they're used whether you finish the gen or not I don't see a good reason to bring them along tbh unless ya just have nothing else
---
i think it‚Äôs a buff tbh
---
I had a dream where he was murdering everybody and I was trying to hide from him. Not the nicest dream I've had.
---
I don't know if I would pay for this...
---
Hopefully, the green pin would be a good add on with that. I use it along sloppy butcher to slow the healing. but being able to inflict the broken status to a lot of survivors would be great.
---
YES!!! ü§£ü§Æ
---
I don't even use frenzy anymore I just play legion like a m1 killer
---
Agreed. Nothing worse than getting shafted because some ass decided to nope out.
---
Nea should be primitive sponge.
---
LOVE!!
---
Honestly pre nerf I never killed anyone as legion. Now I 4k. Idk what the deal is.
---
I do it if you farm your team mates
---
probably not
---
Only farm if I have bt and exit gates are powered
---
*Spirit Fury and Bamboozle*
---
I experienced that for the first time tonight, was straight up not having a good time.
---
I agree with that and it is a shame.
---
Nah, a sack mask for billy would be more than enough, we don't need to pay capcom for the rights to use a minor character like Dr. Chava.
---
I would rather have an evil/deadite ash skin for the billy.
---
So some details:
---
* Winding down with some Protection Bubba. Sometimes it's Basement chest, sometimes it's totems, tonight it was Exit gates.
---
* Gens get done, Dwight gives me a very impressive booty dance in front of the now open gate so down he goes.
---
* Some shenanigans later, 2 of the others are down. One is slugging towards  the gate and spinning, the other (Ace) is crawling away, I assume to the 4th who I never see. They eventually pop back up, either via help or Unbreakable. 
---
* Ace comes back and tries to pick up Dwight, give him another smack because how dare they get near my precious gate. At this point the timer has like 10 seconds left. Dwight has been a good sport so I pick him up and stand with my left side to the gate thinking the auto-drop will save him.
---
Suddenly shit gets wild, I hear two sacrifices behind me and Dwight starts flopping wildly into the air and back on the ground. His bleedout timer isn't going down but he's accruing crows. I end up freezing completely and having to Task Maanger out.
---
I've done this several times but have NEVER seen something as wild as this.
---
Make it for billy so I can both win consistently and look cool.  Also he has basically all shit skins
---
I edited it to 110% movement speed.
---
I relate to the picture so much. I don‚Äôt get tunneled a shit load most games though. 
---
*cries in slug*
---
Or a paratha. I pity those who have never tasted parathas.
---
I could swear i saw some posts about some dbd mobile leaks and the same messages appearing in the russian google play store

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
And before that it was all ultra rares before you saw any browns
---
I think you misunderstood my idea. She only has 110% movement speed when her blinks are in cooldown. Once she has blinks available, she moves at her 96% movement speed again.
---
Would be very pleased with that.
---
Most people use Stalking Speed Addon with the Scratched Mirror while I use Boyfriend's Memo to give me more of my lunge back, works especially well if the survivors have ears that function.
---
I am sure this goes without saying but Ruin, NoeD and MA are pretty much a must if you want to have the highest chances of winning. For the other perk it's hard to say and most of it is normally personal preference:
---
Sloppy Butcher to force them to spend more time healing.
---
Thanatophobia if you think you'll have at least 1-2 injured/downed/hooked at all times.
---
Bamboozle if you play this on Lery's.
---
Enduring or Brutal Strength on Gideon Meat Plant.
---
I have seen some Scratched Mirrors run without MA and honestly it kinda throws me off, sometimes he has 0 terror radius and sometimes he has the 6m terror radius he is supposed to have. I stick with MA to make sure that the Terror Radius is gone.
---
*cries in camped*
---
Explains why I like it then :)
---
What about a WGLF/BBQ chilli perk but for boldness? 
---
Earn tokens for each minute killer is in a chase with you or each time they bloodlust?
---
Have you met my friend spine chill?
---
Why are they all on the same side of the net?
---
oh hell yeah
---
wowie meg x jake confirmed
---
I wish survivors would stop being so fucking horrible to killers. Without killers, survivors wouldn't even have a game to play.
---
Excellent! I will definitely be playing around with all of these setups. Thank you for your insight!
---
Heaven forbid playing survivor has a modicum of difficulty.  Doing 5 gens and leaving is easy enough as it is with 4 people that know what they're doing with semi-decent perks regardless of what killer it is.
---
This is your calling
---
It‚Äôs extremely rare. I managed it on Haddonfield because the gates were far apart and I was running tier 3 Wake Up. It was also a Doctor, so he wasn‚Äôt able to chainsaw or blink his way between doors.
---
But she still could get too close too survivors with her 110% before her blinks comeback, making her blinks unavoidable. Survivors would complain about her being uncounterable and killers would abuse recharge time add-ons, so they can spam her blinks on survivors, plus she still would have map pressure, just that now she would require add-ons.
---
I play with Claudette most of the time simply because she's the first character I got to P3 and I never, ever, had a situations like you have described, like, ever. I guess you were on a bad luck streak or you make it out to be much larger than it is.
---
As a killer main, I don't run any of these and I'm just fine lmao
---
This was the scene where Ash smacks his new companion‚Äôs ‚Äúmom‚Äù
---
BBQ is nice for bloodpoints, even if I don't see anyone else
---
It's kinda boring, nothing new is introduced except some structures, I mean, look at the temple of Purgeon (or however it is called), that map has interactive generator in the middle of the map which opens up the gates after its completed. What does Yamaoka estate has? boring main building with one semi decent window and then it's just rocks and some long ass grass with a gentle splash of Japanese culture.
---
They reverted that change.
---
The hag used to get me good for a long time. But nothing makes me feel like im being watch like Mikey... But we will see with ghost face coming out if that changes
---
I love Yamaoka Estate since it‚Äôs so easy to hide. I can understand why it makes Killers want to slit their wrists, though.
---
(Or DC. That, too.)
---
I find two survivors on a gen once as Spirit and the Claudette crouched away right in my sight (although I admit it was very difficult to see her) and probably would've missed her if I didn't get the notification from Discordance. I improvise and act like I didn't see the Claudette. I hit the other survivor chasing them about 22 meters away then phase walk back to the gen (hiding my phasing sound by the faint terror radius). Then I grab that Claudette and before the grab animation ends and she DCs lol.
---
If I get farmed and tunneled I just DC. No point in playing with shitty teammates looking to grab a WGLF stack while a killer would rather ruin my fun furtherü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I thought it was because Bruce Campbell said he was done.
---
That‚Äôs Brad, not Chad
---
Rank 20 sounds nice
---
It feels like dbd spin off map, and for that reason it is not pleasant for me. I don't like colours of that map

Nani?!

Rank 4 killer uwu
---
How i only got nowd from the listed ones X
---
I plsyed without noed earlier. But after they teabagged, camped and fucking played like shitty noobs against my freddy imma take nowd to get ma 4 kills...
---
Before noed....they gor all gens....none of em made it outside.....good times
---
Jane is Squidward when he ate too many krabby patties
---
Because if they don‚Äôt have said perks it would be broken and unfair. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love using iron will and even I know IW shouldn‚Äôt affect dying state.
---
It‚Äôs just toxic I camp pallet runners
---
I don't heavily rely on them at all, I just use them because they are some of the best perks, only one I consistently use is Ruin.
---
"Get Good" is not something you can do when survivors know how to loop and how to use pallets effectively. Something you do not play against, clearly.
---
Gotta love those spicy yoinks
---
Blame  devs, dont blame survivors useing a core mechanic.
---
Thank you!
---
It is on Stan.
---
He complained about Nurse's wich noone fucking uses anymore so that gives it away
---
He probably loves his Adrenaline, MoM, Deadhard, DS build tho
---
I hope that is truly the case. I don't know if it is just correlation but in these last few days when I run the good ol' toxic claudette outfit some people responded more extremely towards me compared when I just played none prestiged feng. Nothing is out of the ordinary on the average game but when things get heated it is black and white. Or perhaps I just feel a little more pressure due to my own biases against myself using the outfit and it is just self perpetuating inside my head. I should just said \*\*\*\* P3 claudette I am a p3 dwight 'dont know wat a locker is' main
---
I felt this exactly. So what I was thinking is that the killer wants to chase the ones that can hide the best. That's the only thing I can make out of it besides them wanting to see if you truly are a toxic claudette main
---
Nice downvote bait üòÇ
---
But in all seriousness, the majority of people you call "killer mains" probably play killer as much as they play survivor.
---
You can snipe people with double range add-ons.  30 meters. The lullaby  is 24 meters, so you can put a survivor to sleep without them even knowing Freddy is there and having the range gives Freddy much better control over keeping survivors asleep. 
---
Even if they do get a skillcheck, I often just snipe people back to sleep while still chasing a survivor.
---
What‚Äôs so crazy about this? You just held right click and blink‚Äôd forward. I‚Äôm certain there was no luck involved
---
Lmao yeah I don't use nurses cause I don't use Killers with a terror radius lower than 32m unless I play Michael.
---
Ruin is needed to slow down games in almost all scenarios unless you play Nurse. 
---
BBQ helps people pick a new target asap cause that's what you need.
---
NoeD helps with the gen rush.
---
I don‚Äôt have a PC
---
It is made from wood? Can you give us some tutorial? It's amazing.
---
He just made the account so I think he's just doing this for sport because he's too scared to post it on his survivor main account :3
---
I'm not even the type of person,who hides. I'm the one sprinting all over the map,while my teammates crouch to the next gen
---
I get it, but just how you stated about killers, survivors have to use up a perk slot for that benefit. Iron Will is high tier as is, and I rarely see it used. I‚Äôm sure it would get used more if it had that bonus, but I don‚Äôt think it would make it too unfair considering there‚Äôs ‚ÄúEndgame Collapse‚Äù now, and they can just have the entity kill you if you‚Äôre last alive crawling around the map.
---
The quality content man of this subreddit.
---
Money
---
Ever since they changed the super bright white screen from blinds I couldnt care less about flashlights, but if I see prestige or brown shirt/pants Claudette she's getting a mori. Those outfits on her are actual bullshit, especially on McMillan maps
---
idk why this is downvoted, this shit really does happen. to me and all my friends when we do play separately, we all deal with it. and the infamous unsafe hooks too, some matches are awful
---
And WGLF stack too!
---
Just make nurse 115% speed again
---
A permanent 1% bonus per devotion level to bloodpoints after each match. I am devotion 5 so that would give me a 5% bonus in all categories. With how long it takes to get this far I don't see how this would be too much.
---
There are no toxic perks in the game. People, on the other hand...
---
No its actually made out of clay :) And i don't think anyone should follow what i did , cus it was hell making it AND wearing it :)
---
Looking for some new people to play with on PS4~ message me if you wanna trade usernames! I also have a mic :)
---
Nah I've just never used reddit before, I made the meme for a discord server and my friend said I should upload it to reddit ecksdee
---
"OmG sAnDbAgGeR" yea cuz I heard the gen over the chase music and heart beat.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if it was bad in 2016. What matters is now. And now, there are a lot of unfixed bugs in this game.
---
If I‚Äôm invested in a particular match then a good nurse can make me wary, otherwise just the stealthy killers that are good at grabs like Myers pig and Spirit. I also think these are some of the most fun killers to play against
---
Thats one hell of a calculador if it can go through posts in dbd subreddit and count towards which side a post is biased.
---
Let me set the scene. You're the last one alive, the endgame collapse has been initiated. You've been downed but the killer can,t find you because of irpn will. Would you:
---
A:Disconnect
---
B: Wait the minute and a half which feels really long to bleed out
---
Or
---
C: wish iron will didn't work whilst downed so your suffering could end?
---
Yeah I get that, I'm not saying these perks should never be used, because like you said some killers really need them, it's when 9/10 killers run 2 or more of these perks at a time then act like they're good is where I have a problem
---
My new wallpaper &lt;3
---
Mori = lacks skill 
---
Apparently
---
Wrong, this is about survivors bullying killers and then being puzzled they use meta perks. Obvious that it happens to both sides but this topic is not about that.
---
But its a killer talking about a killer perk.
---
Op: I want an stack of a perk that give me points cause I can't get it otherwise.
---
Survivor mains: REEEEEEEEE
---
That's what some people seem to think. I don't really use moris myself, but that's mostly because I only get them once in a blue moon. Most of my moris come from rancor.
---
Because they dc only to deny bbq stacks obviously. And giving the stack anyway would deny their denial fetish.
---
It was a pretty stupid change to be fair.
---
I don't think a DC should grant game advantage to anyone, however survivors should also get a boost on points to compensate for that disadvantage and potencial lose of altruistic points
---
once more, I have to ask you why any of that matters. why are you against the idea of players being compensated when a survivor disconnects?
---
why are you advocating for sameness between both parties in how much it sucks when a survivor disconnects?
---
if you want the game to suck less whenever somebody disconnects, then you should advocate for how much *all* players are rewarded for staying in the game; instead of advocating for nobody getting anything for it.
---
survivors get nothing when their teammates leave, and killers get fuck-all for it. i don't understand why you think sameness should be achieved by doing nothing in lieu of doing something.
---
one thing that could be done is to reward all players in the lobby with a 625 bloodpoint bonus when a survivor disconnects, and thus, the compensation is equal for everybody.
---
you act like killers getting 625 bloodpoints when a player disconnects is some kind of overpowered favoritism towards them. it's not. killers don't want survivors to disconnect because it makes the experience worse for everybody, including them.
---
why is your version of sameness to take things away rather than to give new things out? do you want  players disconnecting to suck for everyone equally? would prefer nobody to be compensated for it at all?
---
Try waiting for matchmaking in *Evolve*... the matchmaking system there is *nonexistent*

---
Lost it at Jake.
---
As a killer main, I personally will always go after a Claudette instead of other survivors while in a chase. My reasoning? Simple. Claudette can very easily blend into her surroundings, hence why most Claudette's play with a very immersive playstyle.
---
Eliminating a survivor that can very easily be lost in a field of corn or even against a wall with certain skins is top priority to me, even if it does mean I have to tunnel that survivor. 
---
As a survivor however, I look down on Claudette's a lot of the time because they usually care more about their own survival instead of their team. I can't count how many times a Claudette has urban'd around and hid from the killer, letting their entire team die so that they can easily escape. Am I being overcritical? Maybe, but its a stigma for a reason.
---
It all comes down to generator pressure and great skill checks don‚Äôt do that much. You‚Äôre acting like it gives you 25% gen progression when hit. It doesn‚Äôt do anywhere close. In my opinion great skill checks need to do more then they do now.
---
here are currently four types of successful Skill Checks that award points:
---
Good Skill Check	
---
Succeed a Skill Check in the transparent section.
---
Grants 50 Bloodpoints 
---
Great Skill Check
---
Succeed a Skill Check in the white section.
---
Grants 150 Bloodpoints and a 2% bonus to progression.
---
Hex Skill Check	
---
Only if under the effects of Hex: Ruin 
---
Succeed a Skill Check in the red section.
---
Grants 150 Bloodpoints and no penalty to progression.
---
Homing axes on console? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---

---
Lol
---
Wow that is a laggy freddy.
---
I agree, it should. It's the equivalent to BBQ
---
&gt; majority of games have post game chat saying ‚ÄúGG EZ BABY KILLER‚Äù
---
I highly doubt this, unless you are stuck in low ranks. I solo queue and very, very occasionally get the opportunity to play in 2-4 SWF. I only play purple to red ranks. Maybe 1 in 20 matches we'll get someone who says that in post game chat.
---
&gt; Survivors exploit flawed game design to piss off killers
---
So do plenty of killers. It needs to be addressed on both sides.
---
&gt; tea bagging at the gate is considered normal
---
Don't do it myself, so can't say.
---
&gt; SFW is a literally an option that lets friends communicate with eachother to have a significant advantage over the killer, and is easily done to piss off killers
---
SWF is in general leagues better than solo queue, but not always. There are times where I will play in a SWF and we'll still end up trashed or I will play with randoms and we will end up doing so well the killers swears we are all in a SWF. It comes down to who you are playing with at the end of the day + all of the RNG mechanics like Pallet and Totem spawns.
---
&gt; DBD dev team constantly makes questionable balance decisions and never addresses the game‚Äôs underlying issues
---
&gt; Game has a lot of options that survivors and killers can take advantage of to not make the game fun for either side
---
On these, we 100% agree on.
---
*I think it gives advantage to people who are already good at other game mechanics and punishes those that are new...*
---
Some games are punishing to learn. Look at Dark Souls, for instance, or Cuphead. It‚Äôs a good bet you‚Äôre not gonna be great your first time through.  Those that are decent now have earned their ability to sometimes hit greats.
---
*Good survivors can loop the killer for longer, hide better, and focus objectives better, so why would the killer have even less time to earn their emblems against them?*
---
Killers need to improve- learning is punishing for them, too. There is also a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù way to play to maximize your emblem score. It‚Äôs gotta be learned and earned, though. 
---
*Conversely, if the game is balanced around such fast generator progress, this makes it much much harder on new players that don't always hit Greats because now, not only are they worse at looping and evading the killer and focusing objectives, the gens make even less progress and they have to survive even longer.*
---
Punishment, again. The learning comes with time. And the RNG of skillchecks is kinda... well, random- so you might have only one skill check for a whole gen, 15 skillchecks, none at all- it‚Äôs not a very consistent boost. But it DOES help a little bit. (And ideally, you want to last at least **9** minutes in a trial as survivor, for those sweet, sweet emblem points)
---
*Unless they are trying to make the game be all 4ks at rank 20 and all 0ks at rank 1, how is this a good mechanic? Am I missing something that balances this?*
---
I don‚Äôt even like to comment on the rank system because it‚Äôs shit. Fair point.
---
*Are killers in higher ranks actually meant to be required to bring something like Ruin...? If so, they have yet to create a perk that actually hard-counters Greats on M1 killers (high-mobility can use PGTW [Pop Goes The Weasel] or protect Ruin much better).*
---
And there lies the state of balance in the game. High-mobility killers that can easily patrol gens, and search for survivors quicker (Nurse and Billy!), have greater precedence in higher rank matches because they can easily put a stop to objective completion faster than low-mobility killers.
---
Are you trying to say that Great Skill Checks require too much skill to hit as a newer survivor AND that they speed the game up so much that a killer at Rank 1 has no chance of sacrificing a single player?
---
Lag and killers don‚Äôt mix
---
But if the killer can see you, he‚Äôll know you have the perk so why would he bother grabbing you just to get stunned?
---
For this exact reason I've been using wake up a lot more. It was one of my top five least used perks until we got the endgame collapse, but too many times now I've been the last survivor and the killer closes the hatch before i get to it and then I'm just fucked.
---
Oh I don't know how I didn't know who he was

You can say teabagging is alright and proper or whatever, I'd disagree with you, but the point is...
---
If you teabag the killer and they decide to tunnel you for it, you did ask for it.
---
I prefer he said ‚Äògroovy‚Äô after stun the killer lolz
---
Dafuq did i get downvoted for? I just wrote the mending noise..
---
It was cancelled for low ratings (I believe) and THEN Bruce Campbell said he was done with ash (except for va).
---
Ez
---
You‚Äôre right. *You‚Äôre god damned right*
---
I got my Adept Plague and Adept Wraith even when the last person got the hatch because I double pipped.
---
It does also kinda give away that you're running that perk, though.  Seems like killers would be content to let you waste your life in there.
---
Responding to your question: The point of skill checks is to force something that requires the survivor's attention. Without it, a survivor would be entirely free (moreso than now) to move their attention elsewhere. To that end, I think great skill checks are fine; you spend a little more attention, you are slightly more rewarded.
---
Responding to your post at large: Your post is describing a genuine problem with the game, being that the game at the top level is survivor-favored, but weak killers will shitcan weak survivors. I don't think great skill checks play into this significantly outside of ruin. The design issues making the game easy for top level survivors are a lot worse than skill checks, and it's a big problem, because it's hard to nerf survivors at the top level while also not making the low rank survivor bambis get shitcanned even harder.
---
And sorry people are responding so dismissively to your post. Survivor mains naturally make up 80% of the community, so they're very touchy.
---
Myer‚Äôs power is all about stalking to get the exposed effect so of course it counters MoM.
---
if you get bashed over the head with something, it better be fancy
---
*'Humming intensifies'* 
---
Great work on the mask! What did you wear it for? Some convention?
---
Hey everyone remember ‚Äòyou don‚Äôt need BBQ to earn points‚Äô
---
Well, it's anti noed, anti make your choice, and devour hope, anti iron maiden, anti rancor, as well as clown add on (I think?).  Granted it's effects on the others are limited since it's exit gates powered only, but still seems like an awful lot of perks to be countered by one perk. 
---
  
---
Maybe if it shielded you from 1 exposed hit or only lasted for a specific amount of time.
---
No. Lol. The problem is *just a bit* more subtle than that, friend. The problem comes from the increased genspeed given by not missing any of the greats (experienced survivors), compared to just hitting a couple (new survivors).
---
Whack a mole billy
---
It's rare. It's supposed to be rare. If you're at a point in the game where you're depending on hatch to win, you've already been *shit on* by the killer.
---
He‚Äôs just bad
---
I just assume he‚Äôs not that great honestly
---
Aces deserve to live. They're just...so cute
---
I see. While I do agree that the difference in generator progression between new and experienced survivors, given the same amount of skill checks per generator, would definitely be more beneficial for the experienced, they do offer toolboxes with plenty of add-ons in the blood web to level out the difference.
---
It's a neat idea, but removing a player's control for up to 2 minutes would never fly.  If it was more of a case of he could hitch a ride on a player and see third person and then manifest within a certain radius of that survivor, it'd be a bit easier to swallow.
---
You mean external things?
---
If so then I doubt thats actually something the devs would be okay with you using, they most likely just can't stop you from doing so.
---
Otherwise, I'm big dumb.
---
crack. is it crack what you're smoking?
---
Green at best
---
Hitting every great skillcheck on every gen actually does shave quite a bit of time off the time it takes to complete all 5, on average. I don't have the numbers in front of me though, but it's 2% per check, I believe. It adds up fast will 2 or 3 survs always on gens.
---
It‚Äôs big, and black, with lots of legs berk!

gg no re m15
---
GG EZ PZ UNINSTALL RIGHT NOW (an actual message I've gotten, no death threat)
---
Thank you for your input, sir.
---
Also, I don't think people are responding very negatively to my post. This is definitely the most actual discussion I've seen about the game mechanics since I joined this subreddit a little while back.
---
Lmao is that trapper looming in the exit gate? From the beginning they knew what this was
---
On one hand I get it, you wanna use your perk, but c'mon.
---
2 of those 3 have mobility powers to down people, the other can down people at range. 
---
Not that I'd call Huntress 4th best anyway. A lot of maps are extremely bad for her *because* she's 110.
---
What a stupid idea LOL
---
I let a ash escape through the hatch while I had rancor and he was my obsession why?
---
BECAUSE the mad lad didn't have mettle of man
---
Huge respect to these kind of players
---
Well, their survey did ask about adding more gfx options
---
ITT: People taking a meme way too seriously.
---
***DC‚Äôs***
---
I will take your entire stock
---
Recently had this very successful chase where I was just breaking this poor killer's ankles for a long time and I decided to get cocky and throw in a couple teabags. Nope, that 2 seconds I took to teabag ended up being my demise lol. I wasn't even mad I deserved that shit.  Won't be doing that anymore..
---
My teammates didn't do any gens, so they all died and they were still five left, so I tried ti finished one gen but I got bored so I went looking for hatch and he closed it so I just opened the gate and left.
---
Those remind me of good, yet chaotically unbalanced times.
---
I saw someone on twitch at Devotion 14 &amp; level 48...  how tf does someone play the game that much
---
He actually stretched out his arm super far and hit you at lightning speed. You must've missed it
---
Yes, good killers have good powers. Legion is a bad killer and has a bad power.
---
Tf. We all need holy jeff.
---
Damn they must‚Äôve reworked Freddy without me knowing
---
He had a bad power before, too. It was never good at downing people, now it's not good at downing people but he's 115 to make up for it.
---
/u/DbD_Flavor_Text when?
---
How are pallets toxic, wtf?
---
Lol. Bet you still depipped.
---
I came here to read all the down voted angry survivor main complaints.
---
I was not disappointed.
---
but my deliverance
---
"Survivoring"
---
BBQ and Ruin are staple perks on every killer, like sc and an exhaustion perk are on every survivor
---
Claudette and Meg used to run like Crash Bandicoot, Jake and Dwight ran like monkeys. Trapper used to go NYUUUUUU when you stunned him, Hillbilly had like no stun when hitting walls, when you got off of the killer‚Äôs shoulder the stun lasted like 2 seconds. Oh and the flying survivors, killers being able to badically cancel the bloodwipe if they hit a survivor who was next to a wall, being able to run a killer around a small box because no one knew how to lunge
---
To each their own!
---
I‚Äôm honestly amazed that the auras on Ormond aren‚Äôt fixed yet..
---
Posts like this need to state region, and platform you play at, otherwise you won't get the info you want.
---
Its called getting good /s
---
I main Myers, so maybe I'm biased, but I absolutely love playing against him as well. There's something so comical about looking at an entrance, looking away for 2 seconds, looking back, and Michael is now standing there. Like, where did you come from, mother fucker??
---
I think it's great he's been in this game for so long, yet still can provide people with such an authentic jump scare after all this time. Some people actually hate that about him, but I think he's wonderful.
---
4 man SWFs deserve to be mori'd, no sympathy here.
---
DAMN
---
Devs, I will literally throw money at you for these skins or new characters.
---
Every map after nurse update has been shit except for clowns map, which is basically nurses map
---
I do this all the time to friends as a gag, woopsies
---
Maybe
---
You‚Äôre missing Claudette
---
Lobby dodging has its reasons. Could be high ping, could be not wanting to go against this group in particular, could be suddenly just not wanting to play DbD anymore.
---
The Hangar would be like Dead Hard: The killer knows you have it and will ignore you. Also,  what is the difference between tiers in Not in my movie?
---
But how come the top left one is the only killer you did
---
This made me laugh :) thanks!
---
Jane == onion head
---
They are still tied tho
---
This reason is exactly why I'm a Killer main. I love my leopard boy Ace, but he just...doesn't get any damn money.
---
Every time she blinks, survivors should suffer from the exposed status effect for 15 seconds
---
He was in the dlc with Laurie and she was leaked before she came out.
---
Nu na na naa...... NANANA NU NANANA
---
Give stacks per alive Survivor (Including you!) and giving it some secondary "Make sure people don't die" effect, maybe?
---
Once Dedicated Servers come around, maybe.
---
Don't use it to juke. THAT makes it useless. Use it in a position where the killer has to swing or let you dead hard to a pallet. Using it to 'juke' the killer is using it wrong.
---
She feels a bit underpowered, from my point of view, of course if you are really good she can be good too like other killers but...meh
---
Right and you don't have to tunnle when you don't want the BT getting active
---
He's referring to the black bars, which you could've easily removed.
---
I disagree when in any game do they ban you for 2 minutes it should be like 5 10 30 60
---
'groovy' 'groovy' 'groovy' 'groovy' 'groovy' 'groovy' 'groovy' 
---
it'd lose charm
---
&gt; That‚Äôs why I only play SWF it‚Äôs almost impossible to win games as a solo survivor.
---
First of all: What do you define as a "win"?
---
Second: When you need SWF to "win" you need to learn a lot . I play solo most of the time and escape around 80% of my games
---
Getting a BBQ stack per disconnect doesn't punish anyone if it doesn't activate the aura reading.
---
How many gens do you do in one second friend jeez

*When your caption goes too far out of its way to explain the joke*
---
Omg idk how I forgot about the bloodweb thing. There was a time where a bunch of people were losing all of their progress (survivors/killers being reset to level 1) so they had to send a ticket to the devs to be reimbursed in bloodpoints. It happened to me and I was reimbursed around 4M bloodpoints I think. It took me an hour to spend all the points because the bloodweb was so unbelievably cluttered and slow. Glad that was updated soon after.
---
To play online, I didnt expect the games. They were an extra, which makes them free. I paid for the online service, not the games.
---
im a P9 claudette, Jon. is what i do.
---
This is exactly why I tell people to check temps when complaining about the game freezing randomly during a match. Dbd would make my old 680 throttle before I set a aggressive fan curve on it.
---
It only seems fair, though.  
---
Survivors *can* use 4 map offerings, while the killer can only use 1.
---
I mean, if OP only posted the image you'd be confused. It's not like they said what they did in the title and then explained that it's not what the character usually looks like
---
lobbdy dodging because of bloody clothes or some item in a survirvors hand should add 1 minute also..
---
I haven‚Äôt done it myself but my friends have
---
*laughs in Slippery Meat, Up the Ante, and Deliverance*
---
&gt;I mean, if OP only posted the image you'd be confused.  
---
Well, yes, obviously.  
---
&gt;It's not like they said what they did in the title and then explained that it's not what the character usually looks like  
---
No, but it's still too much of an explanation. Perhaps more effort into the image itself would have been good. If the caption is a literal explanation of the joke, not to mention necessary for the joke, then the joke itself isn't very good, is it?  
---
Explaining a joke is like frogging a dissection, as they say.  
---
~~Man I have already spent too much time on this conversation lmao~~
---
You know what's also toxic? Movement. I camp everybody that moves because its so incredible toxic...
---
At the same time we should nerf Doctor. He's too strong. We should make his default shock therapy range around 0,5 and it should only give him an ability to giggle at survivors. Also he should be moving at 45% MS when in treatment and 110% when in punishment.
---
Fingers. Always pose fingers!
---
oh right messed up the name.. thank you. well i really though it was a perk worth using this patch.
---
To show you the power of toxic SWF groups!
---
I sawed this hook in half!
---
It's so pretty and easy to hide I love it
---
Where did that Meg come from lol
---
It helped me 4k in many games including this one plus in most games it just gets destroyed immediately, but it is a fun perk nonetheless that can change the endgame drastically and that's why I appreciate it. 
---
I don't think it's a bad or toxic perk. Survivors have adrenaline, DS, unbreakable, deliverance and mettle. It's fine, I never complained, and you shouldn't complain about NOED either (even though those survivors did get salty in the chat).
---
Me yesterday, played ~4-5 matches üòê
---
LF-s chainsaw isn't too viable... I always expect him to have NOED xd  
---
Huntress with NOED always makes me cry.
---
I also remember,when you could mori right away. Or noed without it being a hex perk. Instantly down someone and game over haha . It was pretty unbalanced .
---
Finally someone else agrees that this joke is dead
---
But season three just came out on Netflix
---
I can agree
---
Nah let's not fuck over killers one by one
---
nah not rank 20 dwight, literally anyone hiding in lockers
---
I dont lol i understand the fact that it's very annoying to chase someone all game and not being hable to get him but that doesn't make all survivors super toxic
---
this is amazing!!!
---
I have it and don't use it. And most of my friends don't use it very often either.
---
Yep, needs s nerf, devs doesnt know what balance it!
---
April fools
---
oh, well then guess the devs do really suck at keeping secrets or just really like their marketing strats
---
BBQ is good for bloodpoints and avoiding camping. He didn‚Äôt want to camp as much and this is a better way to not camp. Running the extension addons with this helps a ton.
---
Hahaha, Nea is the killer, got it guys :)))))
---
Day 1, few games in, A Dwight looped me for the whole game cause infinites were still a thing, he escaped. And now I make sure every Dwight dies
---
I am not... U.S here
---
I talked to the devs, and they said spone chill is gonna get nerfed because is way to broken, at least spine chill is skillful
---
i had no problem with freezing or randomly crashing that much. just normal dbd crash maybe like once a week. but the dropping fps used to be a problem alongside with fucked skill checks. no other game did this to my pc. lowering something in laptop settings helped.
---
Alpha/beta textures for pallets?
---
I‚Äôm thinking the Devs are gonna create ‚ÄúDevotion Tokens‚Äù that you acquire upon reaching LV 99 every time. They will create some sort of shop that will use these tokens. There will be one really fucking awesome cosmetic in them for a killer and survivor that‚Äôll be Omni-equippable that‚Äôll cost 3 of these tokens but the rest of the shop will be BP bonus boosters like X amount of games or X amount of hours.
---
it's okay at least he's not the satan of overwatch
---
Well then that's a lack of knowledge on your part, because PS Plus has always identified themselves as a service that packs online gaming and free games together.
---
Your intention to buying it doesn't matter as much as the actual service you're really paying for.
---
I hope that makes sense. Intent does not verse reality.
---
Had you read about PSplus you'd soon know that it gave free games but your intent was to only play online and you hadn't read enough to know that you also get free games.
---
Some of these perks are way higher than the should be(Spirit Fury, Tinkerer, Agitation), while some are really low(like Whispers, Sloppy and Bamboozle).  
---
You should treat each perks as if it were to be put in a build that includes only itself, imo.
---
Eh
---
Honestly always liked the idea of a diver/navy based killer in that old diver suit
---
at least your comeback is more creative than most dead by daylight jokes
---
You could have just pressed Space instead of M1 :'(
---
Oh I'll check it out, thanks for sharing :)
---
Theyre not the same. Its more like a middle finger
---
I try to use it to communicate to the killer when they're being cool or 2 people rage DC
---
Ugh, why do killers keep using Perks that help them kill me!? Am I the only one who isn't totally toxic!?!?!
---
Now you are trolling. I am done.
---
If this is a marketing strat, I wish they would just release teasers instead. I‚Äôm want to be excited for what the killer will look like, their perks and their power. I don‚Äôt want to know that before I can play it.
---
MMMMMM YES, one of my first games I found the hatch and closed it in front of a survivor
---
Okay...? I just gave you my personal reasoning. Not everyone does things for the same reason. I dont care what ps plus advertises themselves as, i was just giving my input.. Makes sense, but doesnt really apply much.
---
30 seconds into the game i hit him and he just left.
---
Ouch....that's actually painful news :/
---
Nice job. They all have an angry face
---
Watching My brother playing against Trapper on L√©ry‚Äôs shortly after it‚Äôs console release, before huntress was released, I didn‚Äôt even play games back thenü•∫
---
nope that is why I wrote it down
---
I treat every p3 Claudette like they know they are abusing her character model and ability to disappear anywhere there isn't light directly shining on her, so I'll tunnel them, my distaste in her being so invisible comes second to tunneling her because unless she is brave or stupid, you will most likely struggle to find her again
---
P3 Claudettes with coloured hats are fine tho, I see that as "I want to show off my p3 but not abuse her model"
---
&gt;with things like chat bans or even game bans
---
Yes, but all of those refer to chat toxicity, things that people type to others, including slurs and swear words. Nobody is getting banned for emote spamming, or spamming crouch, or voice line spam. Nobody.
---
&gt;I've found DbD to be one of the more toxic game communites I've been a part of.
---
Try league.
---
They were used for a while even after the beta
---
Using noed with a no-M1 killer should instantly ban you.
---
Clowns map is a fugly mess lmao what
---
i think she does, whenever i'm playing killer and a Kate is injured, her grunting is kind of noticeable
---
Yeah but they cant do that due to the lack of players already in queue
---
understandable have a good day
---

---
For those 10 threads, I counted 1 of them as killer sides and 1 of them survivor sided. As for the comments, I counted 4 as killer sided and 4 as survivor sided.
---
I would like to point out that almost all the posts are neutral and don't complain about one side or the other. Most people seem to have a good time in the discussions.
---
It looks pretty even for both sides, of course this is not conclusive, but I think it hints that you are wrong. Maybe you just look out for killer sided posts to get triggered?
---
That‚Äôs kinda crazy, I had no idea you could do it from that far. Freddy just seems super inconsistent
---
I like it, but I think she could use 200% speed. idk if 150% would be enough
---
He doesn't have 101 achievements at 1001h
---
That‚Äôs right, we gotta counter the op exhaustion perk + hope combo
---
Kate also has free flowing hair. Occasionally it can spaz out giving away your position. As killer once and awhile I'll see a graphics chunk fly across my screen so I'll know a late is hiding near by. They may have fixed it but I'm not sure
---
Yeah it was really f\*\*\*\*\*\* close. Myers shut the hatch and I go to a door and wait for him to check it and leave, I start opening it and I see him stalking for t3 but I was just gonna send it, he gets t3 as I open it, he moves between me and the door, I ended up looping him until there were like 3 seconds left on endgame and I made it out the door teabagging and he hit me down 1 foot away but I could crawl out because of the swing cooldown xD
---
I always find these ochido wannabes, but they try to outrun my chainsaw (billy)
---
No in the end game screen he said that he had deliverence, cause i let him go thinking he did a 4%
---
Maybe put a time limit before the survivor is able to stand up on their own?
---
But is he wrong though. Same could be said for survivors.
---
I think the selection looks a little dated. It‚Äôs a small thing, but effective!
---
Ok, that's epic
---
That could work. They're given half of the time or something like that
---
Do you know for sure if he got a safe hook rescue?
---
or cake? it has layers too!
---
Yeah, he saved when i was chasing another person elsewhere
---
Can‚Äôt argue with that to be honest. The reason I put the changes related to the hag was due to me playing against her too often lol.
---
I played Freddy with no range add-ons after playing with them and Freddy really suffers a lot. Basically you're really only going to tag up close the range is 10m which is horrible and if survivors separate then being able to sleep multiple ones is impossible as you have to waste so much time getting close.
---
A lot of people say two block add-ons work best on him, but they hardly do anything and if you're playing Freddy like that then he basically has no power.
---
Range and Class Photo are his best add-ons by a long shot. You want to put a lot of survivors to sleep with him and these add-ons will be the most  helpful doing that. I've been able to win a ton of games with him as that half speed gen progress and ability to watch what survivors are doing while chasing one helps a lot.
---
If you play Freddy well, the only tracking perk really needed for him is Discordance (and if you have Class Photo you don't even need tracking perks) and his power slows down survivors so much that you don't need Ruin for example. You invest in a whole chasing build which is awesome.
---
Sadly Freddy without add-ons (or his crap add-ons) is definitely the worst killer. But with his good add-ons he is definitely better than Trapper, Leatherface, and Legion even when they use their best ones.
---
a lot of things are dated honestly. I'm wondering if there's ever going to be an update where they do a massive QoL update on the menu and lobbies. Like these aren't huge issues but everything still looks like 2016 lol
---

---
Ooof, I‚Äôd probably have shit myself.
---
I know NOED gets a lot of heat, but when I‚Äôm playing survivor and I see it pop up, it becomes one of the most tense and terrifying moments in the game. Thematically it‚Äôs a 10/10 perk for me. Instantly instill terror and panic.
---
2 or more surviving is a win in my book and how do you need to learn a lot? 8/10 games with SWF we all escape cause we can communicate and we don‚Äôt have that one rouge player who sits back all game doing nothing but opening a gate and leaving the second it‚Äôs open

Just desync, that sux man
---
oh she did
---
Accurate.  
---
Also does anyone else play osu! and see the circles as a map? Lol
---
dude, you just had to spam space and nothing else, closing the hatch interrupts the jumping animation ;-; I mean, if you accepted that he would escape and swinged that weapon purposelly just to do it, I understand, but I do think it would have worked if you continued.
---
DBD community forming a satanic cult for Ash when?
---
\*Meanwhile in the survivor discord\* "fuckin' hax"
---
Thank you! Might do a second one later with the survivors
---
Killers can kind of tell the difference, but when someone spams it it always feels a little douchey. Might I suggest the come here/point commands instead?
---
BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY!
---
Imagine being that annoying over a dbd meme. OP is not a stand-up comedian, just someone who happens to make memes. Get over it.
---
If your idea of fun is tilting other people playing the same game as you, then yeah you're an asshole no matter how "impersonal" you want to say it is. It costs 0.00 to not do it.
---
Somebody watched noob3‚Äôs video today
---
(I know the build has been around)
---
do you think that could still be abused tho? Like an encouragement to get someone to force a dc? Like a shitty bubba just standing over a bleeding out survivor in an attempt to get them to dc or some shit
---
gotta love when people karma bomb you because they disagree with you :|
---
Beat me to it
---
yea but that's the point. you EXPECT everyone to run them, so you should just get into a habit of countering them and you're making them useless. Suddenly they wouldn't be used as much if people actually cared about it
---
brenda..................... :(
---
I did spam space buddy, he just was half-way through the jumping animation and there wasn't much I could do about it. 
---
If you notice, I swung the weapon after he was already deep down in the hatch as a last resort.
---
Luckyy!
---
The fact that around 50% of this tier-list is actually correct makes me wonder if it's really a shitpost or not.
---
I think this subreddit has a guide that explains all the terms
---
I‚Äôm just gonna log off now
---
I don't do it myself but I see no problem in doing it and don't mind it when other people do it.
---
It's only going to tilt you if you let it, there is no need to be oversensitive about it.
---
Please enlighten us with your subtil first class not-for-everyone humor. How do you make a meme without explaining the context?
---
You can often still use dead hard, even in the open. When the killer is about to catch you go into a 360, then dead hard. Many killers will attempt to swing around through the 360 on muscle memory.
---
Legions power it meant for tracking suviviors, wasting their time, and it can be used in a chase to avoid pallets and catch up even with the stun.
---
When you hit someone, think about if you should try to find others, fouvs in that target and where you end frenzy. You can also use it to cross the map.
---
Right aide on the sidebar enable hex memeless mode, memes will now be filtered
---
Those survival points are not gonna earn themselves.
---
Same. I fucking love Spine Chill.
---
These are amazing.
---
What material are they made out of the sheen on NC is throwing me off
---
Damn someone has some salty survivor tears
---
Wat
---
I'm so mad i spent all that time getting it before they changed legion
---
You avoided my question and said something totally irrelevant. I'm done here. Have a nice day.
---
Let's just give her unlimited blinks with no stun. She can also see suviviors auras at all times
---
Yeah. There's a lot of safety for survivors in DBD, but when that skull pops up? That's when the pressures on.
---
This is incredible. I like the current selection style, but this blows that out of the water.
---
Hey look. Someone who got salty over 7 upvotes even though it's clearly just something unlucky on my side. It was already explained how it works. Is it really that unbelievable that someone could get unlucky enough for it to happen a majority of the time. It's all probability, I just fell on the lower end of the spectrum
---
I probably hit greats 75% of the time with a 1080 and 144hz 1ms monitor. If anything, they need to make hitting them not so hardware dependent. I noticed a huge jump in my ability to hit them when I went from 60hz to 144hz.
---
Some Assholes just Disconnect to prevent you from getting a stack.
---
Use M1 killers like Trapper and just practice to learn basic tricks like hitting past pallets, mind gaming loops with the red stain and so on.
---
Then use different powers to help you learn map control, where to hook, etc.
---
&gt;"Please enlighten us with your subtil first class not-for-everyone humor."  
---
&gt;"You avoided my question and said something totally irrelevant."  
---
&gt;"said something totally irrelevant"  
---
Are you doing okay, pal?
---
That would be incredible but too much work I guess
---
Nerfing her won't make other killers better. You need to buff other killers, not nerf her.
---
Once you buff others then maybe a nerf is fine.
---
This is awesome, great work.
---
Is this post complaining?
---
Good it's a bug. I miss his sexy voice lines.
---
I choose to believe DBD won't be broken forever. The devs will have the time to implement fun stuff like this... i hope
---
Yea sure. Just hit a survivor once in asylum, strode house, springwood school, grim pantry, coal tower, suffocation pit god window, the game's 10 000 safe pallets, rancid abattoir matt walker window, barn, thompson house...
---
 You see the problem that comes from multiple sprintburst in these locations as well as the fact that how easily you can get to them by using only a few pallets. The problem wouldn't be any other exhaustion perk but sprint burst would be stupid
---
I use noed because I don't have many perks options. I'm not a hard core player my highest killer is level 16...so I don't have many good options
---
Just check some of op's comments
---
PRAISE!

---
Nah. That's been there forever. They said it was something to do with the teacher killer that never released. Personally I would love a weaponized apple to chunk at killers.
---
I would like to point out that totems were build specially to waste suviviors time and give killers more time so the games slow down.
---
What decision?
---
Nobody left behind.
---
Hag with Rusty Shackles.
---
Thats true üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Maybe I'm a dick, but when I see this I just leave the guy on the hook.
---
"Oh, that guy is gonna save my ass. Better try to unhook myself and deny him points."
---
If you look carefully he's in from invisible
---
Oooh u r not the guy who wrote ‚ÄúSafado‚Äù in the chat. That means cheeky in portuguese.
---
LUL you have EXACTLY the same on [redbubble.com](https://redbubble.com). Ain't fooling me boii
---
When Hag was released
---
Would you say the flashlight needs a buff. As any slightly competent killer can evade it. Or is it simply the survivor needs to get better at using it?
---
If I know I won't struggle, everyone can get altruism all game, but its rare to get survival so I try for the 4% for the 1500 points. Also, then the killer thinks its just me and you can you on your way.
---
Me playing Billy during the bbq event last year
---
What‚Äôs the fourth one? I see the first three pretty clearly. Either way, this is awesome!
---
Very nice!
---
I think there should be a new kind of flashlight that can‚Äôt blind but lasts longer and when pointing at a survivor working on something else, it boosts their speed and efficiency by X amount.  It makes no sense that flashlights are meant to illuminate dark areas but never does that job.
---
Vaulting in the killer shack
---
He said it.
---
We were all thinking it and he just went ahed and said it!
---
Yes, i think people should get more Bp on the survival category
---
Idk. I dont see a huge point in running it. Maybe the just didn't have better perks yet
---
I completely agree with this. To further your point, as a killer you control the game. While survivors can be toxic, you don‚Äôt haven‚Äôt to worry about being camped or tunneled and you have control to do what you want.
---
Prove thyself thats pretty much all i am gonna say
---
Love this!
---
/u/not_Queen_bhvr
---
everybody has the same lunge
---
This is so cool
---
another thing i would like is bhvr to redesign dwight/meg/claud/jake and trapper/wraith/billy in the character selection screen.
---
All other characters look much more alive
---
WHAT?
---
Nice troll post
---
This post just made me realize that the menus in this game are awful
---
This is fantastic
---
I love all the dlc maps
---
NOOT NOOT MATHA FACKAS!!!
---
I hope so. So far I have only seen cloud saves that can transfer a save from one game to the next but only if they are in the same console families.
---
*forbidden truth*
---
i find Pop goes the weasel working better than ruin for me
---
IMO, maybe im a bit bias since i have stopped using ruin a long time ago
---
Nice! Lmao!
---
Tower Defence Huntress?
---
Depends, ive had players like this just being cocky shits and get downed instantly. Id say its best to test them for one or two loops and if theyre gods ignore them
---
no, like, she'd be like Ryu &amp; just spam here ranged attack in a fighting game
---
It be cool if they had an animation playing like T3 Daddy Myers switching blade stance.
---
No it indeed does not.
---
i think your thinking about identity v
---
i can hear this picture
---
I mean I load up into a match and I'm just trying to be casual. I want to do my daily then bam it turns toxic. They repeatedly hook block and sabo right in front of me but then get mad when I mori a 4 man. Yeah right.
---
What about shirtless clown?
---
It's not just you, the sarcasm is obvious. I have literally no idea lol
---
Yup. Yesterday on his last post he said he wanted to do more animations with DbD.
---
Before you can enjoy it remove the russians.
---
Too many times, never know if it‚Äôs the dbd being.. well dbd or killers getting a kick out of seeing the streamers fade back into the entity‚Äôs pocket
---
Been there for a long time, been reposted over and over, they aren‚Äôt new at all
---
who
---
hmm yes because they are slower
---
I don't think so. The closest he gets is; Her: "Is this some kind of joke?" Him: "More of a game."
---
K den
---
I guarantee Evan and Michael would be your grapplers, Lisa would be the big Gimmick character, Nurse would be combo heavy for damage, Doctor would be the reset G O D, Freddy is just a setup boi, Amanda is your female shoto, Billy is a shoto, Bubba is a Shoto but with rushdown, Plague is the DoT Zoner, Spirit is just Ibuki, Huntress is a Zoner with MAD frames, Clown would be that Jack of all Trades, and Legion is Dan hibiki.
---
I've managed it maybe two or three times so far.  But when I see the two doors light up near each other I don't expect any miracles
---
Bamboozle
---
Ok I'm down ok
---
Survivors need just as many bloodpoints to unlock perks, which is the main source of grind in the first couple hundred hours or more of the game.
---
I can't comment on whether or not killers "need" addons, I personally never felt they did, but I'm still far from red ranks. It just sounds fishy to me, I've seen people play in these ranks with no addons no problem.
---
Good point :), I'll try a mix of the two and spinning! That's a neat trick üòÇ
---
Lithe
---
Ruin needs to be nerfed and buffed at the same time. 
---
I don't use Ruin as a killer and as a survivor, it annoys me to no end. Not the fact that it slows the game down but the fact that I can't work on generator for X seconds after each skill check. 
---
Currently ruin has two effects and the stronger one isn't listed. When you hit good skill check, there is a flat regression penalty AND **you can't make any progress on that gen for about 3 seconds.** If you don't let go of the gen during that time, you can get yet another skill check and lose even more progress which is stupid. 
---
On the other hand, If you consider the fact that skill checks are RNG and you can work through an entire gen without getting a single skill check, on top of Ruin being a totem, this perk is weak.
---
The true power of Ruin lies on survivors wasting several minutes looking for the totem when you could easily brute force through it. 
---
I don't have specific ideas in mind but Ruin needs to lose one of the two effects and the actual debuff needs to be less RNG reliant, making the perk stronger but less annoying.
---
Good point, I'll try spinning too that's a neat trick
---
:)
---
I know man...its a problem.
---
So many stupid claudette mains. I hate soloing and having claudettes in my lobby lmao
---
&gt;‚ÄùNurse would be combo heavy for damage‚Äù
---
&gt;Valentine flashbacks
---
&gt;never again
---
Bro you should marry her!  and instead of a diamond ring, give her a We Are Gonna Live Forever perk ring.
---
I love it. They should get a "Blood debt" where any BP they earn would instead go to sate the entity until their debt has been repaid and they can start earning BP again.
---
So like first disconnect is a 10k Blood Debt. Then it just keep doubling, 2nd disconnect is 20k Blood Debt etc. It would incentivize them not only to stay in matches, but to actually play better because the better they play the sooner their debt will be repaid.
---
It could be a decoy? Sometimes if I am pretty sure a killer is going to come to an area I will start the gen and immediately run to another. They can waste a lot of time thinking that there is a survivor hiding somewhere nearby.
---
Ikr, but it would be less execution due to teleports. Better get that finisher in before the reset!
---
I believe that's a bug then. Hardly what is intended
---
This template is awesome
---
Yeah, but it doesn't fit her
---
You're right.
---
There need to be more Survivor perks which contribute to BP. Perhaps BP bonuses could be added to some weaker perks, in order to convince top-tier players to run something other than the usual meta-builds.
---
Also, Survivors should have two new scoring events:
---
"Objective Distraction" - When a Generator is completed or a Hex Totem is cleansed while you are in a chase.
---
"Altruistic Distraction" - When a Survivor is unhooked or healed from the dying state while you are in a chase.
---
For real. Nothing frustrates a runner more than just randomly breaking chase. At first they think they've won a chase, but by the third time, they realize you just don't give a shit. And so, they resort to taking risks by taking shots, body blocking, etc.
---
Same, I usually die first hook like 70% of the time
---
Damn. I hate that the only thing you can do in this situation is see how the killer is going to let it play out - either they let you escape or they end it quickly. Either way, the BPs suck. What a waste of a match.
---
Why would you buff Ruin?! Killers can‚Äôt just ‚Äúapply pressure‚Äù. Especially while playing lower tier killers such as Leatherface, Freddy, Wraith, Trapper, etc.
---
I understand that you want killers to earn the ability to pressure the survivors, but buffing an already amazing perk ain‚Äôt the answer
---
:(
---
we're gonna live forever (together)
---
Botany knowledge is way better than self care. Only low rank redditors liked this post.
---
Looks awful
---
Even killers feel the urge to protect their young.
---
some good perks would be : disstresing, BBQ, overcharge, unerving pressence, coulrophobia, Pop goes the weasel+ overchage, spirit fury+ enduring, choose what perks so u think are better, it depends on ur playstyle
---
Don't even try to ruin my fun
---
slipery eat is OP with ace
---
Yeah that makes sense too.  I figure I was probably reading too much into it, I just noticed him doing it so many times it had me curious
---
How do I get other perks like bbq?
---
Have altruistic distraction also give points when you're within range of the killer while hooked. If he's camping you, then you're helping your team by not disconnecting. Staying on the hook while facecamped early game gives you nothing and just wastes your time otherwise, but disconnecting fucks your team over.
---
Ruin is fine...changing ruin is a odd taks because in reality the perk is very weak against players who can hit great skill checks or just ignore it or find it. I've spawned in front of so many ruins its not funny. So if anything it needs a buff because like i said it can be destroyed and gone, people can just work through it, or just deal with the perk and bring in tool boxes to rush the gens.
---
GIT GUD BABY KILLER EZ
---
Get prepared to see that a lot.
---
As regards to builds when I play doctor I always run: ruin, overcharge, distressing and unnerving presence.
---
Ruin is not amazing, it depends on the survivors being bad (and even without ruin you would have won with bad survivors)
---
The problem i have with ruin isn't how powerful it is (a perk that can be removed isn't powerful), it's the bad habits that it encourages and i personally think it is unhealthy for the game since some killers, instead of learning on how to get better, decide to let ruin apply all pressure without learning how to apply it
---
Because people have lost their sense of humor haha
---
It's not overly fun from a killer standpoint either, they really need to address this, it's a shame that the game itself is in pretty good shape but the players are absolutely the worst it's ever been
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Or you play swf and everyone is still at rank 13 and u the only one at rank 1-2 and see a killer without prestige and think he is bad and then you get outplayed so hard x'D
---
If you blind me, I tunnel :)
---
I have all of those except for ruin, because I don't really know how to get perks that belong to other killers
---
Skip the first one?! Disgusting. Rule number one of 80s horror, embrace campiness. Can‚Äôt be skipping movies out here, especially some of the GOATs
---
i think the change it needs is to be more reliant on the player's skill than on rng
---
I had no Idea you could blink 3 times, i thought you could only blink twice and then get exhausted
---
I think the perk should stay as is they just need to make it harder to find.
---
only problem is that in 3 killers it will require scrolling without rework or resizing
---
bbq is for Leatherface
---
Overcharge: doctor
---
UP: trapper
---
Courrophobia: clown
---
PGTW: clown
---
Spirit fuy: spirit
---
Enduring: hillbilly
---
Philip with the all seeing add-ons is top tier anti stealth.
---
Maybe do a gen instead of looting? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
They are many, who do you mean ?
---
Well I‚Äôm boosted... thx for the info
---
Yeah but the whole purpose of ruin is to give time for the killer to apply pressure onto survivors, otherwise 2 gens are done when the killer just got the first hook.
---
Indeed, players quitting is a symptom of said very same players' selfishness and childishness.  
---
If they weren't pathetic turbovirgins, DC'ing wouldn't be a problem.
---
The reason those killers are definitely not as good as Billy, Spirit, Plague, Clown, and others is because their power doesn‚Äôt help in chase. Leatherface is there because his chainsaw is impossible to hit if the survivor knows what they are doing. (I find it extremely easy to just run around some random rocks or garbage and avoid it). 
---
Take Wraith for example: Sure, he can get an early first hit, but after that he‚Äôs just a normal 115% killer. You might think that‚Äôs fine, but you can be looped for much longer than killers that can use their power mid-chase like Huntress. How are they supposed to apply pressure?
---
I run whispers to find the first survivor as fast as possible, so i don't waste too much time.
---
I try to not chase for too much time, if the chase lasts for more than 30 seconds i'll drop it.
---
It's normal for survivors to complete 1 or 2 gens in the first minutes of the match, if you leave the furthest generators alone, they will be repaired first, thus you won't have to patrol that area. 
---
If possible, try to injure as many survivors as you can. 
---
If you feel like you are losing pressure, you can start slugging.
---
If you are constantly applying pressure on survivors like this, when there are 3 or 2 generators left, it will be pretty easy to finish them. It becomes much easier when the killer you're using can end chases fast (like hag/nurse/spirit/huntress). 
---
It's hard to explain since everyone has a different playstyle which can be hard to adapt to, but this is why i usually do and i do great
---
Probably
---
You did thanks for the advice, I have huntress so I guess I get her teachable
---
Nothing puts fear into a surv when you can hear that goddamn chainsaw buzzing from one end of the map to the other.
---
this is really cool stuff, dude.
---
but you have to only level all survivors up to 40 and then collect all the perks on one character. you need to get all perks on ALL killers tho
---
playing the game, leveling characters to 30,25 and 40
---
Where's Nea?
---
I gonna be honest I absolutely loathe selfcare.. I cant stand seeing people run selfcare and are healing nearby the hook I'm on instead of saving me first they fully heal while I slip into second stage. Selfcare users are selfish and it's always a claudette lmao.
---
Nice.
---
It's normal for gens to be completed on the first minute, as long as you aren't chasing the same objective for more than 60 seconds. If the furthest gens get completed, even better
---
Even the title sounds like an ash quote
---
it already is all about skill. just learn to land greats ffs. it's not that hard to learn, just focus on it.
---
For me, I play killers until I get tired of them, and just straight up want to switch killers. So I don't have the urge to "go back" to them
---
Devs won't go out of their way to ban you but if EAC ends up banning you after detecting a file manipulation, devs can't do anything.
---
Do it at your own risk.
---
Still, it is very unlikely that you will get auto-banned but the possibility is there. I edited my files to uncap frames a long time ago.
---
Ruin is useless. Unless it doesnt get cleansed. Then it just slows the game down a little bit.
---
You know, that is a valid point; I did forget about those interractions. Hmm.
---
I feel you I was thinking so too. But since I got my 800h+ playtime done  now I realized it doesnt Matter as much as ai thought it does.
---
I'm also able to escape or get a 4k(4 kills as killer) if I use no add ons or shitty perks if you start a new char for example. It's harder but manageable.
---
The more important thing is the play style how good you know the map,the looping spots etc. And as a Killer I'd say it's experience, if you now where the run it's easy as GG . IF you get looped they finish all gems before you can hook someone.
---
PS:I'm currently killer rank 3 and surv Rank 6 if someone cares ^^
---
If EAC detects it, yes. The devs will not lift your ban.
---
However there has not yet been a reporting of someone being banned for changing their perk icons as of yet
---
Selfish care 10/10 rename for the perk.
---
Oops sorry i meant that ruin should be more reliant on the Killer's skills. I can land greats consistently tbh
---
Why would you run BL and deadhard? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to run two exhaustion perks imo (not including adren)
---
he's gotta be view botting (either on his own or someone else) I genuinely can't understand how anyone is entertained by him.
---
oh, makes sense now
---
This is what noed is for. Shutting down toxic ass survivors who think they are good
---
Anyone know which issue this is from?
---
This is the shorter list.
---
Yeh well she never got to use any of them because I hit her once and the she left strait away.
---
Your teammate risks going for the save to help you instead of doing generators and you dick them like that? You deserve to get abandoned on that second hook.
---
I love bing bong boi
---
If I were to rework Ruin I'd remove the part where gen can't be repaired a moment after landing a good skillcheck (it really annoys me when I land all the greats but some noob comes around and makes me stop from time to time) but increase the regression itself
---
just a lil bit\*
---
It doesn't match the menu BUT it looks badass imo. I've always thought that the UI is in need of an overhaul. With a different background, these avatars could actually match.
---
I'm talking about people who dc for legitimate reasons, not salty kids who are mad because they're bad.
---
Just a liite bit at the start. Just a lil.
---
&gt; Your teammate risks going for the save to help you instead of doing generators and you dick them like that? You deserve to get abandoned on that second hook. 
---
The killer doesn't get a notification whether or not you kobe'd or not, simply that you're off the hook.
---
No it's a symptom of the game being built to make players feel a certain way. 
---
Whether it's hitboxes, lag, matchmaking, incentive to stay in the match, etc. If 3 players DC &amp; if players DCing is a rampant problem, it's the game that has to change to make a better experience, not the players.
---
Suviviors barely use DS anymore and who can even make head on work? Most of this will effect killers if they don't get a suvivior to a hook with a wiggle timer.
---
Most of the time enduring will be stronger
---
I'm almost 300 hours in and I still get stomped by people with like 2k hours. Then they pretend it's not because they have more experience. Like that 2000 hour people have never been stomped.
---
By getting hooked in the first place them running up to you and then you jumping off. They have wasted their time.
---
&gt; You have the weirdest logic I‚Äôve seen today 
---
It's pretty simple actually. You're just a selfish cunt.
---
that's cool
---
Go back to fortnite
---
Its easy to shit on the dev's when you've never tried to look at things from their perspective, and as far as shirtless myers goes, have you seen a lawyer?
---
Just ask us what you need help with and we'll tell you what to do. And yes, the matchmaking should be based strictly on skill level at all times.
---
Some people play 300 hours and arent that great still. Unless you dont know what you are doing then those 300 hours seems like a lot.
---
Not the friendliest, but probably the most unique one. The same ol survivor who lets me farm them is a boring tale told too many times.
---
That's has happened to me so much lol and they end up getting hit and they run away again and heal and I die cause it's too late
---
I am in love with this.
---
Depends, you wanna win, or just learn?
---

---
Well, at least he's still doing DBD stuff. You had me scared there for a moment...
---
Selfcare isnt needed on survivors. It's for baby survivors that suck.. lmao.. I havent used that since they nerfed the hell out of it back in October or November. 
---
Now adrenaline and an exhaustion perk are staple.
---
Getting hooked after looping the killer for at least 2 mins leaves enough time for tge others to do at least 2 gens. Them running up to me doesn‚Äôt matter since 2 gens for 1 hook is great. Me jumping off, again, doesn‚Äôt change anything, let alone it‚Äôs only a 4% chance. There‚Äôs nothing selfish in my gameplay, you‚Äôre just making assumptions which are based on nothing but one opinion on the goddamn subreddit. ‚Äúcunt‚Äù
---
Chill dude its a joke. Its tagged as shitpost amirite
---
I agree with this

I think he feels left out by not having the meta perks yet. That kinda bummed me out too when I first started but I grinded until I got them.

I dont think noob3 is actually a fog whisperer

He probably means the t-bag, but I understand, she was trying to taunt the doctor to go after her, in this case I dont think it's toxic, I think is a good move to pull the aggro off a team mate.

Is this list accounting for addons? Because if it is, both the Pig and Wraith have addons that are good counters to stealth. The Plague should also be much higher on this list.
---
i would say hag is lower because urban evasion screws her. Shes also short so its harder to see over things
---
Agreed my bad
---
I'd go with billy, great map control and an Insta down if you can hit it
---
Okay so imagine that like ruin and bbq, all of those perks are staples
---
Making renders is painfully simple. Animations though. Those are hard.
---
it's either that or the game disconnects me from host for the tenth time today
---
You cant say shit about killermains on dbd reddit they all downvote ya. They cry big saltytears... but put something that is shitting on survivors and watch the upvotes climb.
---
Take ruin off and put huntress lullaby on.
---
Umbra dodges a lot of games if they‚Äôre not maps that are in her favor. She also bitches about dead hard and other perks being super meta and crutch while she constantly runs meta/crutch perks for huntress. At least she did for the week I watched her while learning to play huntress idk if she‚Äôs any different now.
---
I honestly didn't see him OR his caption before... thanks for pointing it out to semi-blind people like me. :D
---
The day I was introduced to this game the people I played with warned me of toxic shit.
---
If you have to warn players day 1 of toxicity, there's a problem.
---
Yup, exactly the post point. It's rare not to see them on a killer.
---
Yeah, its like taunting the fat kid during a game of tag.
---
That's what's all the more exciting about it. Still kind of a bummer that it's over. Not saying I'm not apprecative of 100 straight days of quality memes.
---
While trapper's ability ranges from borderline useless to Mind gamingly broken his capabilities that are universal to killers are solid. I.e. movement speed, and lunge range. His perks aren't terrible either.
---
Not sure why you're being down voted. You're spot on.
---
Yup everytime. Selfcare takes 32 seconds that's a huge waste of time. Huge!!
---
Nono, us console players would love the change
---
As someone who never played fighting games, I am confusimpressed

Located a salty entitled survivor main
---
It's a bastion from overwatch that i made
---
It's my opinion.  But having real clothes is better than fake ones on a dumb video game.
---
Haha you ain't lying
---
Hillbilly is always good choice. He is not hard to play, but he is very good against experienced players.
---
All I read from this is "let me win!"
---
Thannk you so much !
---
I used to be Rank 1 but I still hid in lockers. Mostly because most Killers didn't think I would be stupid enough to do so. They thought I am smart. That I had perks that allowed me to run the fuck away like a ninja.
---
Turns out, I'm not smart. But that wasn't so bad most of the time.
---
Except that one time when the Legion looked at the puddle of blood in front of the locker, then at the locker, and just stood there. It was hilarious.
---
100 days of memes takes dedication. It's simple but tedious none the less. Especially in the program I use. The files never import textured right. Then the posing takes a moment. I really love Dbd animations though.
---
please don‚Äôt speak of this horrid place in public
---
Its not a joke. If it is its the worst and unfunniest joke ever. If he put like monstrous shrine in S tier then its 100% joke.
---
If you listened to the stream, they are changing it in order to define what a stun is easier and what they want to count as a stun. Even if you brought it for DS no suvivior really uses DS anymore so..
---
Nah,Most swf‚Äôs derank to find games. It‚Äôs impossible for a red rank swf to get a game in less than 30 mins on PS4, and usually after waiting that long the killer dodges anyway.
---
Someone tag a developer!! Lmao.  But for real it's a stupid selfish perk 32 seconds to heal is stupid. Go do a gen save someone, have someone heal ya, Or play injured just run that sweet adrenaline for a free heal at the end.
---
Nurse and Huntress are probably not the best choices for a beginner learning how to play killer though. I say this from experience, as they were the first two that I played, and I struggled for a long time until I started playing other killers with higher movement speeds. I'm back with Nurse and Huntress now, but not understanding how to play killer made those two very difficult at the start.
---
Like how is monstrous shrine better than unnerving presence
---
*crop your reposts*
---
*pls ty*
---
What would his main weapon be?
---
a long long time ago the colors were blue and a very annoyingly bright shade of puke green
---
Doesnt matter its like a key. I may never use it but i have it just in case.
---
72hrs old videos :) i miss his videos so much
---
Hes got addons that make him fast af and reappear faster just cloak and uncloak constantly.  Ive had it done to me and bam Im On the ground
---
Except that survivors get a free rein on the gens while you hook your first survivor. And while you try to hook more survivors there will be more gens done. 12% recession is nothing when there is no gens left. Also if they manage to hit a great skill checks then it does nothing. And that is a hex perk. The longer the game, greater chance for the hex totem to be found. Survivors running around to unhook will certainly find the hex totem and cleanse them right away.
---
Do you know why ruin in it's current state is so great despite it being a hex perk? It manages to do something right away. Devour hope, lullaby, third seal, etc all the hex perks are not favored because there is great chance that hex totems will be broken before they can be worthy of one perk slot. Ruin, on the other hand, does its job right away.
---
I'm not talking about red ranks, I'm talking two rank 7, a rank 9 and a rank 15 getting paired with a rank 15 killer
---
Trapper. Because you literally have to set them up in good places for it to work. They run into the danger themselves and you just watch. I had a good match last night. I was trapping everyone.
---
You really dont need to play hag, you just have to dump bloodpoints on her up until you unlock the teachable. Up until then, you can return to leveling up your doctor and get ruin.
---
Or you can just go find the hex totem and cleanse it? It only takes 14 seconds to cleanse totems.
---
And the change that is needed is BHVR making an actual effort to get rid of the pathetic turbovirgins that DC. It will make for a far better experience for anyone that isn't a cunt, as it won't be riddled with DC's.  
---
If it was a matter of "the game itself needs more incentive," people wouldn't leave matches in games like CS:GO, but they do. The game can change, but people won't change. They're garbage. Garbage that needs to be put in the trash already.
---
I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs not a crybaby hypocrite
---
Located a basic ass killermain...
---
Fuck the survivors. Dont play by their rules
---
For me its the legion. Being a killer with the ability to be a sprint bursting survivor with a knife for a while is pretty fun for me lol
---
legion because it's hilarious how people still disconnect against the current legion when it's piss easy to play against
---
It's bastion from overwatch, i made some other stuff and i didnt have enough space so i just drew around it
---
I'm a spirit main (she's level 50 P3) and after all this time I still don't know a good build to use on her and when I should use phasing while in a chase (I know, I know "If she's your main how are you bad as her?!?!?), looking for suggestions fot any of those. (Even better if with both)
---
Thank you! I didn't know i could uncap the frames
---
Implying I don't leave every lobby with over 200 ping
---
If bbq didn't give me bp, I'd rather use whispers, which is much more helpful in the early game and has no counterplay. Maybe bbq still on billy and nurse, but other killers...? Nah
---
Probably a harpoon right?
---
Not as much as I hate Haddonfield.
---
Because nothing says "outplayed" like getting oneshot by a killer you can't loop
---
It's pretty stupid for gates to spawn close to each other also..
---
I reee with you
---
Yeah, I accidentally tunneled one of them at the start and felt bad about it.
---
Bro I've seen people drop $100s on this dude regularly. I've personally been gifted subs to him for 3 months in a row, and I only watch him if nobody else is on.
---
&gt;Tentatively fixed an issue that caused the Survivors not to receive points when completing a generator
---
Awesome. No more 99% gen tapping.
---
The big deal about MoM is the fact that there is no indicator for it, that it only takes 3 hits to proc and that its consistantly reusable. They want to change it to something like taking 3 protection hits, or at least that was the initial idea. 
---
It's being used at high ranks to essentially take 5 hits to down a survivor (insta heal tech, dead hard and then MoM)
---
Ormond auras fixed ? Now that sounds great. Have to see it with my eyes !
---
Wow, someone's late to respond
---
Subreddit admins don't see it as an issue, so it's not an issue. Get your head out of your ass.
---
Nothing for hooks sounding like hex totems? Not a fan of getting bamboozled every time I think I've found the ruin
---
Cool i knew about verifying but ill double check my firewall. Thanks my dude.
---
This looks great! Shows all characters yet don't look cluttered.
---
But...... tentatively???
---
Yeah, noticed that too. I'm gonna guess they smacked a bunch of spaghetti code in there to get things working again and will probably apply a permanent fix later.
---
Holy shit you need to go outside my dude
---
Streamers are definitely cursed and I have long since stopped using mine. 
---
If you don't get a bugged loading screen then you just get a sweaty nurse who wipes out your team in minutes.
---
It would only maximize your chance of getting face camped lol.
---
With endgame collapse, grabbing off the hatch still exists, correct?
---
To be fair, there are a few maps with assets that survivors can just abuse the shit out of against a 110 killer and you can't even throw over/around them. Huntress mains know the pain.
---
Plus BL is still useful while exhausted, since it "opens" some loops
---
"Fixed an issue that made it possible to see other players as blobs through auras."
---
Good, it's was easy to spot people to know where to go next
---
No worries, best of luck!
---
i like this idea
---
Lol well, I guess it beats having to wait for games and risking a DC
---
Freddy
---
Probably from eating your liver like hag üòÇ
---
Oh man I hate NOED but I love seeing little shits get punished by it like this lol
---
I do enjoy her design, it is unique. I just can‚Äôt play her well enough.
---
I personally think you should start bleeding out if you aren‚Äôt in a chase or something similar.  WAY to easy to mend currently.
---
I knew it
---
Apparently im the only one who has seen all of the stupid spirit memes yesterday.
---
Don‚Äôt you mean a shattered ruler with needles in it?
---
Nahh
---
You usually takes them
---
I can just ask her to give them back
---
Usually does the trick
---
Nope. If the survivor jumps, you can't interrupt the escape anymore.
---
No. Its look like mortal kombat.
---
I have yet to even get one person in a trap. I thought I set them up in good places. Sometimes under windows, sometimes in the grass by the killer shack, even in places where the killer drops off a ledge. Idk what I‚Äôm doing wrong at this point.
---
Inb4 lands one jab and goes full combo for like 50%+
---
I can't connect now to the game since the update? Game files can't be authenticated through easycheat?
---
The sad part is I was watching Tofu yesterday when he was on the front page and he technically recommended him as a good player lol
---
Oh I definitely understand why she dodges. Some maps are hell as huntress. I hate lampkin lane with a passion.
---
This
---
Damn you‚Äôre smart
---
Well look who‚Äôs shittin in the tall grass again
---
This is outstanding i already love silent hill the cross over would be great and i love the idea that the scraping of the great knifes heard before you see pyramid head! This is just brilliant
---
I found it funny how you said the mods had no problem with it, and then it got removed.
---
The only person with their head up their ass is you, thinking anybody cares about a mild reaction to a video game.
---
Perma baned in his chat for calling him toxic when he was whining for ten straight minutes ab how op survivors were just cause he was playing killer at the time when hes a SURVIVOR MAIN
---
I understand how his power works, but you still give stacks on all of his hits, making that not counter because sure you may insta down but you're giving them their stacks.
---
Yeah, they need more bp. There are times when I want to play survivor more but I play killer instead because I need the bp
---
Technically changing ingame files is bannable. 
---
But i myself have been using custom icons for a while and nothing happends.
---
You dont have to worry. As far as is known there are no players banned for it as of yet.
---
But how will I get my wraith 4K away from my gamer setup? üò§
---
We're running under the assumption that these people are going into games and DCing repeatedly, and if that's the case, the issue very likely isn't the developer's problem.  If players aren't enjoying the game, they would be DCing and not coming back and we wouldn't be seeing it be an issue so consistently.  BHVR can't fix gamer behaviour without kicking them out.  It has very little to do with mechanics.
---
Someone talked me back into running self-care by explaining it as I could waste me+my teammates time or just my own time
---
Oh this is perfect üòÅ it‚Äôs exactly how I feel when I get sucked into a long chase!
---
Pallets windows and areas you would travel if you were playing survivor. I got about 5 traps in one match. A big thing I like to do is if someone steps into a trap i reset it in the same spot. They think it went off and it's safe. It's not. I have had the same person step in the same trap multiple times. Each map is different just think about where you have chased people before that are looping well. In a chase they cant stop to deactivate a trap and they cant really double back without taking a hit. You also cant be afraid to let things go to keep setting traps.
---
This has hit me pretty hard lately and I‚Äôve made a good shift in goals. I don‚Äôt go into games looking to kill everyone as soon as possible, or any kills at all for that matter.
---
Keeping a good pace with lots of jump scares is ideal for me.
---
... but I do have the occasional game where I‚Äôm out for salt and stack up for a good quick slaughter...
---
You can but a lot of people don't like it
---
i was confused for a moment then realized what happen pff
---
Okay thats fine lol. I didnt wanna cause a ton of issues. Its why I asked first
---
I'm busy summoning Cthulhu until 5, but afterwards I'm free.
---
Survivor wait time on PS4 at least is horrible and i agree with the bloodpoint gain. It's terrible as survivor, if WGLF did something more than just BP it would be much less of a wasted perk slot
---
I was watching ohmwreckers stream dbd and she came into his chat to congratulate him on becoming a fog whisperer and just to say hi and have seen her insta posts and she seemed to be a good person all around but havent watched her streams so was wondering
---
I sometimes use that name but bring flashlights. Ez manipulation counter.
---
C'mon man give my boi Michael more credit. :/
---
I came from watching that. Thank you.
---
I shit you not I versed the EXACT same player as you did today. I think for me it was a legacy nea? I played spirit and he killed himself on hook lol. Hes a really sore loser ngl
---
Angry pug has been an angry bitch since day one. What else is new?
---
I've played both with and against Jen on several occasions. She is in zero way toxic.
---
The ones you mentioned plus The Spirit are the only killer I play
---
Oh thank God they fixed the DC hook sound gitch. My ears are finally spared from the pain.
---
Those two actually work fine together as if you dont make it to a cliff you still have your dead hard as a fallback, plus you still keep your fast recovery off jumps after falling off something.
---
Bubba would be better as a rekka (with his multiple hitting chainsaw) and Billy is definetly the rushdown type (he's all about speed and getting close).
---
They FINALLY fixed the shrimpboat in pale rose! THANK GOD!
---
The Purge for legion
---
So waste 32 seconds everytime you get hit.. 2 heals is a full gen!! Waste of a perk spot.  Run a Medkit.  With good addons and your healing for like 8 to 12 seconds if that.
---
I can tell that this probally hit
---
Put Bloodhound you mad man.
---
That was Insta-karma for the meg, glad to see those types of players get destroyed.
---
I think spirit is the perfect choice. She is a bit Challenging to learn but is also a lot of fun an can be really strong.
---
For a standard build I love I run Ruin, BBQ, M&amp;A, and Nurse's. I am a info addict and you need it when playing spirit. Nurse's calling and monitor allow for seeing survivors healing without alerting them. You phase to them and get an easy down. 
---
If you get to a small simple loop I recommend standing still for a few seconds to see how the survivor reacts to you phasing. Then you can use your power accordingly. Jungle gyms get a bit more complicated.
---
I don't follow her either but from what I heard, she whines constantly and BMs a lot, runs the most meta and crutch perks imaginable alongside her 4 swf and complains if the killer does not follow her made up rules or runs meta - crutch perks. She also dcs a lot and encourages the "if anything does not go my way I'm DCING" mentality. I really like Scott though
---
make sence
---
Why have you not bought spirit :-(
---
Wow! That‚Äôs good!
---
Would you recommend watching the Evil Dead movies before hand or is it not necessary?
---
One step below this life form are the cunts that are trying to unhook as you are running to them and then right as your about to arrive they hit the 2nd phase and refuse to struggle. So you just let me run over here and waste time trying to help you only to watch you essentially throw the game?
---
Did they throw a rock and the survivor escaped?!
---
That‚Äôs my biggest issue is I don‚Äôt let things go. I chase until I get them. I‚Äôll keep that in my so thank you!
---
Side note, I‚Äôm guessing dead hard is a good counter to trapper?
---
Nurse versus.... Kate
---
FIGHT!
---
No. Wglf should be buffed as getting more bloodpoints doesn't give you any direct advantage that perks should give. You see it so much because it's easier to get bp as a killer and nothing in the game matters aside bp. You remove aurareading, everyone keeps using the perk - you remove bp gain and only a quarter of players would keep using it.
---
Deranks, DCs, can't take an ounce of criticism, goes in hard with shit talking killers she deranks/DCs to play, most of the time in a SWF group, surrounded by people that likely have rimjob fixations.
---
Noed, unnerving presence, bbq&amp;c, and distressing. If possible, use that build
---
Bhvr turns a blind eye, but if you get banned they won‚Äôt unban you
---
Verify your steam files
---
I would love a QoL update on Trapper; his power just seems a little outdated.
---
They fixed downing on the exit gate slowing the timer!
---
Dead hard? No bit more than average. It's good if you run into a pallet and see a trap and you use it to get ahead. Most people though have a problem with either not stopping when there is a trap or stopping too late and eating the hit. You need to have at least 10 traps set spread over the entire map though too
---
Pig, tier 1 myers, and spirit with prayer beads
---
if you don't get woken up in X amout of time, you will be stuck in sleep word for X amout of time.hooks, survivors  can still wake u up but not gens.
---
I thought I was crazy. I didn't know this was a full-fledged bug.
---
Remeber that one time he got (old) Decisive Striked at the exit gate and he had a tantrum for a good 10 minutes.
---
Yes that‚Äôs totally what happened
---
Thanks ! No nothing serious I just wore it for a Halloween party :)
---
DS, but it looked it though!
---
well then you could try a little harder so it could look like one, and looking at your downvotes it looks like you are shit at making jokes that look like they're jokes
---
It's a flaky flat bread, cooked in a pan
---
Legion Gave Me Cancer sounds legit
---
Hope you got the spotlight :D
---
Tentatively usually means that safety measures have been put in place to make sure it doesn't happen while we try to isolate and fix the actual bug.
---
A joke has to be funny lol
---
Bonus: my Mettle of Man perk is also activate :)

Right thank you so much. I probably won't as I think I'd get a lot of backlash that I don't want to deal with. But I appreciate the digging!

Do people that play the game actually watch that alcoholic?
---
Head to the properties for Dead by Daylight through Steam, go to local files, and then validate integrity. That usually pops up because a file is lost or corrupted during the update.

Sometimes there on opposite sides of the map, joy of RNG you win some you lose some.

How old does your account have to be in this subreddit to post gifs?

Tbh, the best thing that could happen in terms of farming potential of survivors is to buff WGLF to reward tokens on heals as well. Like, heals on other survivors.
---
Other than that, reworking BP offerings to be actually useful would be nice.
---
The conversation and deep connections he has with chat make his stream very fun. DBD is just a background to a just chatting channel.
---
It seems like you think dropping god pallet or cleansing is inherently selfish and displays poor decision making. You also seem to insinuate that because I have done both of those things that I must have those qualities while supporting the 'stigma' I am supposedly fighting against. It is almost as if you ignored everything I have just said and made some weak connections used to attempt defeat the point I was trying to make.
---
I have to verify my files after every, single, update. Don't worry too much.
---
Don't give up man. It'll be worth it.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised. He is the adult version of the crying baby meme
---
Yes
---
I love playing Huntress, but I don't have ruin and these higher ranks get gens done quickly. I run Iron Grasp, Nurses, BBQ, and some other perk I can't remember bc it's not important. Is there any other perk that could help stop gen rushing?
---
When my injured what?
---
Nice shot, but why am I not surprised they dced after a great shot like that. What happened to the lat guy cause after a second dc I would let them have the hatch cause of the failure and shitbags those teammates were. Props to LEFT4DEAD for taking a loss and not dcing like the other two that dced.
---
Michael. When it goes right... it goes right. Stalking a survivor at the beginning of a match for Tier 2, and seeing that they just don‚Äôt realise... it feels great. Scratched mirror goes without saying. Myers is just such a good killer imo, and I love how you can still make the survivors shit themselves if you play well.
---
I run play with your food a lot and at least half my matches if I find my obsession first and just peace out, they will spend the entire match in my shadow t bagging me not doing gens trying for my attention. Until the last gen is done and a ranchor thier dumb ass off the map.  No ed is wack you dont even get to kill them and it can be destroyed.
---
Like I said, I don't follow her and don't know whether that's true or not but that's what I heard from the people who critize her. I know Scott and he's pretty cool
---
BBQ is a no brainer perk for billy and huntress, and also because of the BP gain which is honestly the primary reason it's run so often by EVERYONE.  If it had the tracking part removed you'd still likely see it extremely often and it just wouldn't be run by people who already farmed enough BP.  Still even if the perk wasn't meta at all for...  Some reason, you'd be seeing it run all the time on those two for obvious reasons.  
---
Nurse's calling is a meta perk that I surprisingly never really see many killers use.  It's on that list of "A fantastic perk but doesn't hit the top 4 or 5 perks that are ALWAYS fuckin' run".  It's REALLY hard to compete with BBQ/Ruin/Enduring/Spirit's Fury.  
---
Ruin is in every single killer's perk list because you need to slow the game down JUST A LIL' BIT.  I'd love for Ruin to not be an absolute requirement to play the game at high ranks, but keep in mind she does play red ranks pretty much the entire time, you -HAVE- to run ruin there unless you are playing Nurse.  Even if they can all slam through ruin no problem you still slow them down a good deal.  It is the only perk I'd honest to god say is an absolute requirement to play the game from the purple ranks and onwards unless of course you're a good nurse who can just do whatever the fuck she wants.  
---
And shadowborn is the opposite of meta and she runs it on every killer because the normal fov gives her headaches.  
---
Also the only map she really dodges is Haddonfield, otherwise she will play em out.  And dead hard does fuck over huntress more so then other killers purely because you can reaction dead hard the hatchets where as every other killer you can just get in auto-aim range for melee and smack them making dead hard useless in those scenarios.  
---
Really a lot of her perspective comes from being more or less a Huntress one trick, and she actively avoids any kind of "toxic" behaviour in and out of game so I don't quite understand the complaints.
---
He got hatch. Funny thing is I messaged the dcer and said "rofl nice dc" and he said "your to good."
---
pause‚úãüòê
---
They are inherently selfish acts. 
---
Dropping shack pallet early will earn one of your teammates a basement hook later in the game, when they are much less likely to be saved. Not you. You know there is no pallet, because you already dropped it. Your teammates do not. 
---
Cleansing not once, but twice is very selfish. If you cleanse, you are no longer a viable person to make hook saves for sick people. (As it will get you sick again.) You are committing yourself to not be altruistic. If you do save, you have really poor decision making skills. Cleansing punishes your teammates who do not cleanse. The plague will chase them instead of you, and as they are broken, will have easy downs with her ranged attack. All so you can have two health states. All so you have a "higher" (actually lower) chance of surviving.
---
I didn't ignore anything you said. People hate p3 Claudettes because they play just like that. You're complaining about other players prejudging you to behave in a way that you behave. Please tell me the flaw in my logic.
---
Agree, for some odd reason it's always Myers players BMing. Like you said it also sucks to get BMed as survivor because you can't do anything other than run and hope for the best

You can use it to:

Find allies to heal you

Find allies to heal
---
Know totem placements
---
Know generator placements
---
Know if someone is in a chase so it's safe to keep working on the gen

Know if there's someone nearby a hook so the save is safe
---
Know window placements

All by just looking around at your teammates auras

Yes. I'm a huge Evil Dead fan and when Ash stopped talking It didn't feel the same to me.
---
This thread makes me feel old.

Not really, nurses fatigue prevents grabs
---
Better than self-care 
---
You can get your allies to heal you and use it to give up you valuable information.
---
I think it's useful when you start playing and/or if your playstyle is on the cautious side. If you like chases more than stealth, it's not that good.
---
*MvC Character Select Theme plays*
---
That man is Steven Crowder and can confirm that he actually looks like Ass
---
Michael would probably be the Grappler, though I imagine that Evan's spikes would make some nasty backbreakers.  I always thought Herman would be a gimmicky stance character with resource management, though I could definitely see him being the reset master.  I think Bubba would be a Rekka character with Billy taking a more aggressive rushdown 50/50 style.  If you're looking for a more serious Legion you could easily make them an assist/puppet character.  Now you've got me wanting to experiment with putting DBD Killers in MUGEN and discuss movelists again lol
---
Idk, I'd like to test it out.. wglf needs a buff and it should work for how many gens you complete. Not how many hooks you get because you're literally competing with 3 other people who need hook saves.
---
I wish you could pelt the pebble...
---
You broke it down really well and went in depth smoothly. Great job :)
---
It's very useful.I used Empathy alot before I switched to Bond and it gives you more information such as who is doing gens, who is being chased etc
---
Thank you it sounds def worth it
---
Usually a meg lol
---
Sure bud. lol selfish cunt

‚Äúand Legion is Dan hibiki‚Äù
---
I legit laughed out loud at this
---
I don't think he's complaining about them, I think he's just saying that it's dull to see the same perks all the time (or hes just joking around, this is a meme after all)
---
I WANNA TAKE YOU FOR A RIDE
---
What kind of crackhead puts Monstrous Shrine above Spies? Spies isn‚Äôt great but you‚Äôre gonna get a lot more use out of that than Shrine...
---
damn toxic survivors trying to aggro the killer onto them away from the injured teammate.
---
#***YOU'LL NEVER SEE IT COMIN***
---
What you said plus doctor if you dont like finding survivors
---
Honestly I'd level up hag for that Ruin. Overcharge (believe its a doctor perk) and the clown perk where you hit the gen after a hook and its a 20 percent undo are the only other ones I can think of off the top of my head.
---
is what you would say if this place were real, it is not, do not go looking for it, stop investigations immediately, this is merely an artists rendition of a fictional place
---
&gt;why let it take up any space?
---
By this logic, you should have never posted it.
---
No0b3 was banned for hacking in legacy stuff.
---
Check out the developer notes on the front page, a ton of good stuff is coming!
---
Maybe after 7 days without a disconnect your counter will reset so you go back to the normal 10-15 min wait
---
The tbag was unnecessary
---
Quentin looks even worse like this. 
---
Oof.
---
Wraith or Myers. Wraith is very simple and straightforward; cloak and uncloak. He's also very good against new survivors since they rely on stealth and not knowing where you are is super helpful. He also gives you a lot of bloodpoints. Myers is also really beginner friendly and straightforward. Stalk, get stronger and kill survivors. He has a very small terror radius which gives survivors little reaction time once he arrives and he has EW3 which allows him to instantly down healthy survivors and makes him a super strong snowball machine
---
Honestly, i wish they'd let us do custom ones without fear of a ban
---
The mind game and fake phase part I know how and when to use, aside from that, thank you for making me notice that spirit is basically a nurse that can't go through walls (it requires a lot of skill but is super rewarding when you have said skil)
---
Hmmm, you're right. Though I still wish the general reaction was 'wow, that guy's an asshole' and not 'everyone does it, so it's a-okay'
---
Only if you find the survivor, otherwise have fun with misty glasses on yamokas estate.
---
Maybe Play Nurse = No Balls would be better
---
I use it on all characters no matter what. Once you use it you'll never stop. It's the best perk imo
---
Thanatophobia is a level 35 Nurse teachable. But you'd have to go out of your way to injure as many people as you can or it's useless.
---
So now instead of losing your obsession once for a 5% speed boost, you'd have to hit five survivors for the same result?  I don't get how that's better, am I missing something, because that sounds like it would take way longer.  
---
Also, I don't think it's even very often that I land fifteen M1s in a single match.
---
Glad the gen thing is being worked on, was getting annoying having to remember to pull off just before hand and then a skill check coming right that very second and then BOOM, oh good, there's another 5% to do and the killer knows where you are now!
---
Oh you sneaky thing, that‚Äôs actually pretty genius :)
---
This is a repost of mine from almost a year ago. But it just happened to me again and I literally made this face lmao.
---
Leatherface shuts that down.
---
Ruin is only really required on trapper or hag when you need that first minute to set traps without 2 gens popping. Other than that, it just makes the game less stressful.
---
I saw that on the xqc canvas, I also have made some other stuff on there, great art xqcL
---
Day 276: Spies from the Shadows is still broken on PS4.
---
Last patch improved framerates noticably, now they're down again. It's a constant up and down between patches. I wonder why this can be so fickle.
---
It‚Äôs just an idea. I never see any killer run play with your food other than tombstone Myers and maybe a wraith every now and then.
---
And it only took 5 months!
---
55% of 20 is 11 so that gate gets open in 9 seconds.
---
Thank you for your service
---
Happy cake day
---
In that case go speak about it with the devs cuz they said yes
---
Lol this is so true most of the time. I can still manage to pull it off once in a while if I have Mettle of Man active, but that‚Äôs completely situational.
---
You can use the high terror radius build
---
Ruin
---
Unnerving presence
---
Distressing
---
A perk of your choice (BBQ, coulrophobia etc)
---
OR
---
You can also use the standard m1 killer build :
---
BBQ
---
Enduring
---
Spirit fury
---
Yeah it got nerfed from its original form I believe .  When Myers came out he was a wrecking ball with it.
---
really nice looking interface
---
no they didnt. EAC **ONLY** scans the .exe  and the packed, already encrypted files. they said changing *those* are bannable. however, icons are fairgame since EAC does not scan them and they were left editable i assume on purpose. you're spreading misinformation
---
Imo hag can be really good, especially when it comes to map knowledge and learning survivor movement as it‚Äôs key to her, and you get a relatively satisfying way to play. Plus you start with ruin, giving you extra time as you learn.
---
PastaCouch
---
thanks bro!
---
Well for one this is just, not very good. It‚Äôs not balanced in the slightest, because play with your food is any offensive action, it means you have to pick your swings as to not waste a token, making it attack the obsession to lose tokens is basically giving a permanent 15% speed boost, tombstone Myers is basically god with that as killing isn‚Äôt coded as an offensive action, so kill the survivor and boom. Permanent speed boost. Obsession disconnects? Permanent speed boost. Not to mention it doesn‚Äôt fit the name in the slightest. All this would be is just save the best for last but way better.
---
You can also use it to avoid your teammates while being chased, additional to all what the others already said
---
Everybody gangster, till the M&amp;A Myers is on lery‚Äôs
---
YES! I always run into things, that look like they have no collision when I play survivor and I cannot find anyone when I play killer. Honestly, just take me to The Game instead of this, ugh.
---
Soon(tm)
---
Adept legion is a nightmare. Their perks are bad with the exception of discordance and they themselves are terrible
---
You usually need a /s if you show sarcasm on r/deadbydaylight
---
What if the numbers were decreased? 9 instead of 15
---
And 9/6/3 instead of 15/10/5?
---
Heres a quote by the devs:
---
"We won't actively go out and ban you for doing it, but if EAC picks up on it and automatically bans you for altering files, we won't be able to help you. Use at your own risk, but I wouldn't recommend it."
---
i run it all the time.
---
What is this from and why is cartoonz there?
---
oh, i totally forgot now it takes 20 secs to open the gate and not 15, anyway thank you
---
If you're looking for help I can. I'm on PC. I don't mind helping you out
---
It‚Äôs a simple spell but quite unbreakable
---
I relate to this on a personal level, the only thing more painful is getting your third token, and the moment your weapon is descending on a survivor you hear that oh so painful crash of thunder 
---
Everyone tells me to run something more reliable but every early game totem loss is validated when I achieve that fifth token and no one can find my totem
---
It's possible, but it heavily depends on the killer, the map and the killers tracking perks
---
dumbass i just told you EAC doesn't scan icon files, because they are not in the packed files or in the exe, so no, it won't ban you because EAC can't pick up on it because EAC doesn't scan it because they didn't set EAC to scan it. do you get it?
---
&lt;3 this! Would love to see all the dudes too!
---
Pig is really fun to start off with, personally!
---
That was a weird and oddly specific place to go. I hope everything is going okay in your life.
---
They have to change the 8k cap. Running the killer around for 10 minutes and winning the game for your team shouldn't net only 8k. Conversely, doing gens all game shouldn't net only 8k. Survivors need to be reaarfee for doing their part, they shouldn't have to be Gods in every category.
---
No sound fixes? I thought they said they were sorting the sound balance out again this patch?
---
I used to love Spirit but haven‚Äôt been able to play her for crap since the sound got messed up when they started updating the Unreal Engine :‚Äô(
---
I love you, you are stubborn &lt;3
---
It's going to be difficult to stop gens from being completed at the start of the game without using a perk. I don't play at high ranks, so I can't speak to your exact experience, but I usually focus on keeping people injured/hooked to keep them busy doing other things.
---
Here are some other gen slowing perks:
---
Corrupt Intervention (Plague) - only good for the first 3 or so minutes of the trial. Survivors can move to other gens, so I wouldn't waste a slot on this.
---
Surveillance (Pig) - allows to you see if a gen you've previously kicked is being worked on.
---
Discordance (Legion) - see when two or more people are working on a gen.
---
Surveillance is a favourite of mine on Huntress. Given her slow movement speed, you don't want to waste time gen patrolling to find people. It also gives you the opportunity to hail mary a hatchet if you really want to.
---
If I dont wanna play against a sweaty ebony mori nurse or prayer bead spirit why should I have to? Goes both ways
---
I used to get gifted subs from a friend for his channel till I turned off the ability to get subs from people I don't follow.
---
Okay, but if you don‚Äôt know then why offer up potentially false information? You also worded half of it as a statement of fact instead of what the reddit mythos is.
---
Had a few matches as Myers where Survivors were actually taking advantage and I had no idea why it was happening
---
Thanks for the suggestions. I‚Äôll be trying piggy then the spirit of it doesn‚Äôt work out.
---
Correct
---
this is what my phone camera thinks i look like
---
After 4 new characters u be scrollin again
---
I watch his videos and he normally plays relaxed (killer and survivor, survivor mostly) did he really stream insidious bubba?üò± I haven‚Äôt seen it.
---
‚ÄúMogal Meers‚Äù
---
I really like this idea. I fully support it!
---
that's why I use mettle of man to get that save off even if it results in my death
---
But then they never expect me to have balanced landing ;)
---
what's really scary about this clip is that framerate it looked like a slideshow!
---
Yeah, the lag was insane in this match
---
No0b3's first ban was for hacking legacy, and second one is largely unknown though most people think it was because of his Hag Space Program video. (Most people argue that was unfair since it was a well-known exploit which was very hard to pull off in a regular match and provided no strategic value.)
---
No0b used to to be branded by "toxic" content but over time he's moved away from being baby Ochido and has made his own brand of playful sarcasam. I call his brand of toxism "joke toxism" - when you simply play well and ocassionally point or teabag in order to draw ago and keep looping the Killer. It's nowhere near mister "exploit to get the Killer stuck", "work with the Killer on a regular basis", "tell my fanbase of 12 year olds to witch hunt this random player I lost to" Ochido.
---
yea you're right, everything survivors do is toxic. My mistake, fuck survivors, why don't they let us 4k every match, fucking assholes.
---
Shappig up
---
This happened to me once. Trying to take aggro and the last gen popped. 
---
My first thought was "Well then, that was a mistake"
---
hillbilly. theres something so satisfying about chainsawing a survivor trying to 360 you
---
I too activate my noed and oneshot one of the people with my metal stick when I step into a heated argument between people
---
Same. It‚Äôs such a clutch perk, saved my ass and my teammates so many times.
---
I'd crawl over to you and low five &lt;3 I feel you man, I feel you.
---
People have already listed most of the main suggestions so I'll just clarify some of my more favorite perks to use
---
* Overcharge: Outside of Unnerving Doctor shenanigans, the skill check isn't too terribly hard to hit. If you can get into a 3/4 gen defense situation it can be good because people will still make mistakes and you can get some cheeky explosions off of it.  In that situation though for most killers I'd prefer Surveillance because then I'd know if a gen is being worked.
---
* Corrupt Intervention: Can help corral survivors early on and make the initial patrol a bit easier. However this won't actually slow down gens, so the active ones will still go just as fast. 
---
* Pop goes the Weasel: Been liking this perk more and more. While it certainly can help slow down early gens, I feel it shines more when there are only 1 or 2 remaining. Being able to knock off ~20 seconds of progress feels amazing. However it has it's drawbacks. It's almost a bit of a "win more" perk since it relies on hooking. Also sometimes you just won't get the opportunity to kick a gen before the timer is gone. It's why I prefer it for later-game builds since you'll probably be spending your time in a smaller area and can get back to the gens quicker. 
---
* Lullaby: Only mentioning it because while it's probably going to give you no value in most games, those games where you do get it to 4/5  stacks and can protect the totem are hilarious because you'll constantly hear failed skill checks. Definitely more of a novelty than anything else.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter, because we are talking about a permanent speed boost by just not hitting your obsession. The concept itself is broken.
---
Im not okay with it cuz everyone does it, Just like if someone flipped me off, I wouldnt really give a shit
---
I N C R E D I B I L I S
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main bud
---
Okay so *Tentatively* is like a Bouncer guarding a door protecting us from the Bug
---
And behind that door is McLean shirtless fist fighting the bug
---
As far as i know, EAC checks files on injections of 3rd party software. Most files(not just exe).
---
If it were only executibles then the game had many more cheaters. 
---
Checking what a computer is running in the background is illegal. So EAC wont do that
---
Seriously? Say it ain't so. What platform are you on if you don't mind me asking?
---
I really like this design because of how much more dramatic the portraits look in full body. Only thing is some of these I feel would need to be redone to fit the others like Bubba is cool but the way he's cut off and how much more animated he is is off putting from the others.
---
I also like how you kept it simplistic for the outlines and gradients to fit the rest of the game. I know some people like the flashy perk icons and stuff but I prefer something similar to the dev's design. If this ever becomes a mod I'll definitely out it on
---
well then you're toxic if you don't let killers kill you every match. Why don't you play the other side for once to know how killers feel to be faced with such vitriol every single match!
---
beby
---
"Like" would suggest that isn't precisely what's going on.
---
Listen, man, if spoon-fed humour is your thing, just say so. More power to you. Not everyone can figure out jokes for themselves. I understand your struggle.
---
I do play killer too.
---
Absolutely I do. As trapper I usually go right to it and try to get a trap on an avenue of approach, but I'd say 9 times outta 10 it gets hit. That 1 time thou, oh man it's worth it &gt;:)
---
People interacting with it means it's ok? So if i posted on r/fatpeoplehate saying how much i hate obese people, and got lots of interactions it would be ok?
---
For those of you who live under a rock, he had DS
---
I've only played this game for about six months now but was Freddy justly nerfed? Or did he need to be nerfed but the devs just overdid it?
---
I had a Myers pretending to farm do this, infinite EW3 - I didn't buy it (didn't intentionally feed him stalk, but he probably got some off me anyway) and tombstone and the other three survivors just sat in front of him.
---
He killed everyone, and since I was the only one doing gens I got a front-row seat for the first and was the last one alive, but this was before Endgame Collapse so no hatch for me until I finished another generator.
---
No, because that's a subreddit dedicated to being an asshole. Getting positive attention from there would mean that you're being an asshole.
---
Are you fucking stupid, or just ignorant?
---
It could all be a character, like Dr. Disrepsect.  
---
I personally don't like either of their streams, but I know Doc is actually a great dude and is only a dick for the stream, might be the same thing here.
---
Maybe like devotion cosmetics for each survivor
---
Almost like legacy except different
---
I found it on his Twitter after diving deep into his Tweets. If I remember, he's at some competition for For Honor I think?
---
They didn't fix the biggest ruiner of the game - long hitboxes. It's very frustrating as a survivor when you managed to vault through window and moved a little from it already only to receive successful lunge hit from over the window.
---
It just sucks, and makes windows an accessory rather than obstacle to killers.
---
I offered it as it could be an accurate answer to the person's question. I also said before it that I don't know whether it's true or not to inform the person that this answer is not 100% true and that they should not take what I say next as concrete so I don't see a problem with it. I also said "from what I heard" and followed it up so anything I said after it is, from what I heard.
---
true, and Ardetha is usually not a cry baby, but at times he can whine like a bitch
---
r14 vs r10-11
---
matchmaking is a joke.
---
Personally, I love it. It helps so much. I use prove thyself so it really helps in finding my teammates to finish gens.
---
Also helps to see when other survivors are doing absolutely nothing for long periods of time. (Hate those people)
---
awh thank you.
---
tbh, I hate that Ash is given an exclusive privilege of being able to say stuff, whilst other survivors don't.
---
It's unfair.
---
one must be greedy to achieve success.. or in my case, failure
---
Gen rushing? As a killer main I always hook rush survivors. I chase them, as fast as I can, and I carry them to the hook (nearest for best rush) and then I go and find another. Best way to counter gen rushing, hook rushing üòé
---
Where can we get their meme templates?
---
no you have to be practically touching to get a stack of wglf
---
Begone Clickbait!
---
also, don't play ur traps on the actual pallet but aroud it, the survivor can throw down the pallet and jump over it, but when u break the pallet the trap will still be there and you will either go aroud to forgot it was there
---
oof
---
you copy and paste  game files , new icons to override the old icon files (pc)
---
if by some chance the auto system picks you up behvr wont unban you
---
Sorry but that isnt a dwight cosplay
---
yep the matchmaking is absolute cock
---
theres 3 types of people in this world
---
people who only get spoon fed humor 
---
people who can enjoy every type of humor
---
people who only enjoy deep, indepth jokes and think any other type of humor is "childish"
---
pick for yourself which one is the worst, but thinking you have a superior taste in anything subjective is just dumb
---
Design? Do you mean her character or her power‚Äôs design?
---
Doctor. I don't care that people get whiny and consider it "hostage taking", he's the only one I feel like I can really do a war of attrition with even an okay 3-gen set up. I always enjoy playing the "Control" arch-type in whatever tabletop games allow it and Doctor feels the closest to this in DbD. Though to be fair, I've had some modicum of success with Freddy / Plague, but those two require rarer add-ons to accomplish it. All Doctor really needs is one of the "Restraint" add-ons for the empowered clones.
---
There is nothing more satisfying then slowly grinding the survivors out of resources. Kick a gen, chase until they drop a pallet, break it, and then go back to the gens. Every time they use part of their toolboxes, medkits or flashlights but ultimately make no progress feels amazing. I will happily grind out a 30-45 minute game because in that situation, it no longer becomes about the BP. It becomes more about watching what people do when they can no longer rely on pallets and items. 
---
Turns out, most of them just give up and then spew salt in the post-game chat. Which is hilarious as fuck.
---
Not a patch, just a hotfix. If I'm correct, patches require approval by Sony, Microsoft and probably Steam which is why they take some time. Hotfixes are smaller and can just be pushed out.
---
They addressed this in the latest Dev update.
---
It doesnt check the image files dude. Its not bannable, not even technically. The devs just said that if eac somehow bans you they arent wasting their time to help you, its not a confirmation that it IS bannable. There have been no cases of eac banning anyone for it either so lmao
---
PC. I usually maintain 60fps on most maps, but on "bad framerate" patches, I will get drops and fluctuating framerates on more maps, or at least more parts of maps. I had them earlier on Suffocation Pit for instance, whereas before this patch, I would have a constant 60fps there. Red Forest maps turned into consistent 60fps maps for me last patch, now back to fluctuating on those. Mount Ormond used to be inconsistent 40-50fps on all outside parts of the map for me, then last patch about half of the outside area was a pretty consistent 60fps - now back to 40-50. And so on.
---
I don‚Äôt know why but I had the street fighter 2 character select music playing in my head looking at this.
---
TURBOVIRGINGS AHHHHHH üòÇ
---
Wait, the crosshair is intentional?  Why?
---
why would it?
---
Laggy ass mfing Killer tho. Console experience.
---
This is sick. Very well done. Thank goodness it‚Äôs not another pedo-chomo baby avatars that have been going around. Do one for killer too!
---
It‚Äôs not only way better, it‚Äôs very OP. With the current PWYF, you lose your tokens with offensive actions. You are not permanently zooming around. With this rework, you are getting permanently buffed by just not hitting the obsession. That‚Äôs a massive difference. There‚Äôs a reason the killers move the speeds they do. Take any killer, let‚Äôs say Spirit or Huntress. They move at 110% instead of 115%. That‚Äôs a 5% difference but one that would result in  them being way too strong if it weren‚Äôt the case. But if you slap this perk on though, in no time at all you will be moving at that 115% and far beyond for the duration of the game by simply not hitting the obsession, until they are all that‚Äôs left. Busted.
---
Yup pretty much. Nothing makes me want to stop playing the game faster than a bunch of people DCing instantly on first down for no other reason than the Killer existing.
---
Cause NOED doesn't need a nerf, and it has an easy counter, cleanse 5 totems
---
That‚Äôs what I love about Leatherface. Turning a 1K into a 3-4K just based on the fact they didn‚Äôt want to leave their one buddy behind is always satisfying.
---
Clown is a m1 killer so you can use the standard m1 killer build. Ruin, bbq, enduring and spirit fury. You can also use stbfl, sloppy butcher, brutal strength and bamboozle. Clown lacks map pressure so if you defend gens a lot you can use anti gen perks like discordance, pop goes the weasel, corrupt intervention, overcharge, surveillance etc.
---
For clown add ons, all his add ons are good except increased movement speed while reloading (its pointless) but mostly you want to use increased intoxication, extra bottles, larger radius of the tonic, faster reload speed, mangled, exhaustion and extra hindred effect.
---
I look around as i go around the map and there are several vaults that get blocked by rng. So its not that much of a deal but i need to know the pallets.
---
When i vault a window it goes in cool down and that makes me not to run it.
---
Great for learning the map tho.
---
Sometimes i find myself with no pallets thinking the obession was doing a good job but actually he jus throwing down all the pallets.
---
Imagine a new leak in this patch LOL
---
Perks don‚Äôt make you good dude.
---
This is why I'm either buying new content with shards or waiting 6 months for them to nerf it to see if I still want it.
---
Idk I‚Äôm not leader of the defense squadron, I‚Äôm just someone who watches him from time to time, and I just see him catch heaps of wins and then sometimes get outsmarted but he seems to handle all that pretty well
---
More crutch than old DS+NOED+MoM combined
---
I know it has other uses too, like you can see other auras through pallets, gens killers and survivors
---
The Hangar is basically decisive strike. About to go down near the end of a chase? Hop in a locker for a free stun.
---
Shoot
---
I like the idea. But it feels kinda cluttered
---
my humour best
---
u bad
---
Woah. Those arent nearly in the same level of crutch as Fire Up. I mean you see killer play without it?
---
BHVR has always catered this game for killers.
---
But as for NOED, it‚Äôs not a good perk and I‚Äôm a survivor main.
---
Though I think a nerf would be survivors knowing how many totems are up. Even so much as a single small noise notification when a dull is broken that survivors have to be aware of.
---
itd probably be a tie between huntress and legion for me. being able to hit survivors from a distance as well as being able to run across the map quickly is very fun.
---
I like,and support this idea, the scrolling can be annoying.
---
Looking back, this tease makes no sense lol.
---
Ban jendenise, make an example out of the toxic fog whisperers
---
I‚Äôm not trying to be mean saying this, but it just honestly comes off as ‚Äúlazy‚Äù and low effort. Nowadays EVERYONE is trying to be a Twitch Streamer/Youtuber and the steady swarm of *‚ÄùHey guys! I‚Äôm just a small streamer trying to make it big! Come join my Twitch Chat where I curse and make fart jokes!‚Äù* gets annoying after a while.
---
If people like your Stream, you‚Äôll get an audience eventually over time. Seeing so many people ‚Äúadvertise‚Äù here is just annoying since most small Streamers haven‚Äôt established a reputation or ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù so to speak. That‚Äôs just my view on it.
---
It's such a great QoL change.
---
Every killer I play against uses it. So OP you can just let survivors do gens while you do nothing then ez win
---
If I play my billy and I close the hatch there is no escaping because I have whispers and can go between exits I‚Äôve seen people get away during egc its just almost impossible against some killers or killers with certain perks you just have to get lucky
---
What‚Äôs a p3 nurse doing in rank fucking 13
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un6Y5E4TOv4
---
You were kinda close!
---
I hear ya, if the killer uses one of 4 perk slots for a location perk then you can‚Äôt take it away. Probably a bad comparison but why not disable Wake Up and maps that show the hatch at that point?
---
One easy way to get stacks is to force killers to hit you while healing a downed survivor, I've noticed
---
It's good if you hear a terror radius approach you but no teammates are around you. It tells you the killer is not in a chase and is looking for survivors. I've used diversion and fast vault a few times like this to waste the killer's time searching in the wrong areas.
---
Can we talk about alternate universe hot Dwight?
---
This ‚Ä¶ I never bothered to deal with totems that weren't hexed until I played 5 games in a row against NOED. Now I hit them when I see them. Especially now with the new end game you have to do it.
---
Killers should get more BPs than survivors because they have to invest way, way more BPs than a survivor does. That being said, I‚Äôd be okay with them getting perks like a survivor version of thrill of the hunt; perks that contribute more BP gain.
---
ad mortem, inimƒ´cus!
---
I love how you said not a nerf but then its a nerf unless your catching some dude in the first 20 seconds.
---
The best QOL change they could make is me being able to stay in the same party after a match of SWF. Can't believe it's not implemented after all this time yet
---
Your entire argument is that your team exists to get you points, and you're calling me dumb? Attempting a 4% literally doesn't work 96% of the time, very few people attempt it to begin with, and you're in a heated argument on the internet over it.
---
It's 1000 blood points. Literally a third of a common node. 
---
1. Get the fuck over yourself
---
2. Kobeing is fun, believe it or not some people play the game to have fun
---
3. Success or failure changes nothing about your chances of escaping. You still get the save almost 100% of the time. Quit being a douchebag and move on.
---
What‚Äôs not to understand? The survivors are all the same minus the teachables. Once you have the teachables you want, funnel all your BPs into one survivor and your survivor is done and optimized.
---
For killer, you can‚Äôt just play one because they are all different. So you might funnel all your BPs into say Billy but the rest of your killers are gonna be scuffed.
---
Sadly, it's not fixed. I played a game to see it with my eyes but the aim is still kinda messed up
---
Pallet vaccum? 
---
Also double pallets were nerfed, like anything else killers find slightly annoying. Meanwhile, crutch killer perks almost never get reworked.
---
The only notable killer rework was legion which I‚Äôll admit was way too extreme as he wasn‚Äôt that hard to deal with pre-nerf (mending exploits aside).
---
&gt;dipshit
---
This is what is funny, you getting pissed of at me for something that isn't even real. The fact you continue to give me exactly what i want even after I've told you really reflects your intelligence.
---
It's good to be prepared.
---
It helps with motion sickness. The gas effect can cause some people to feel sick and having a fixed point on the screen helps mitigate that.
---
My opinion is that if you linger for two minutes after you had the ability to leave, you deserve to die for it.
---
I read this as NOED nights.
---
Nope, my entire point is that if someone is going to risk getting caught by the killer to come save you only for you to move off in his face just because you want points makes you selfish. The other survivor could just work on a gen instead of wasting their time.
---
False equivalencies.
---
Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if they just gutted his tech and just threw on a generic chasing power.  Everyone complained about his chase for so long that I fear he'll be like Clown: Literally just a mediocre chase power, with no stall, tracking, or pressure.
---
The hitboxes themselves are working perfectly, what you're noticing is down to latency. We mentioned this in the recent dev update, though:  [https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/63559/developer-update-may-2019#latest](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/63559/developer-update-may-2019#latest)
---
&gt; BHVR has always catered this game for killers.
---
lol
---
Can you posr the images you used so i can put them in myself? These are nice
---
I believe someone said something along the lines of ‚Äúif the change isn‚Äôt affecting gameplay it‚Äôs ok‚Äù
---
Which I get, but most people on this SubReddit aren‚Äôt looking for that kind of thing. I‚Äôve given my fair share of 0-View Streamers a look and most of them aren‚Äôt very good/entertaining.
---
Someone tag a developer
---
\^ This - you gave me a frighten, friend
---
Blessed comment
---
The answer is simple. Because unlike old DS and MoM, NOED has many direct counter plays and tools to help with it.
---
i used a literary device to accentuate my point on the internet.
---
Literal just go and break totems. That's all you need to do.
---
That's an even more stupid reason to get banned
---
Sometimes its better to just make sure they dont have trill of the hunt and then leave them.
---
Just remember where they are and after the last gen is done check them quick to make sure none lit up.
---
How new are you to this game? Since 2016 it's been survivor sided, and it still is.
---
Hillbilly.. You get one shot kills and you can travel around the map very quickly.
---
I'm really excited for this. I wonder if this will be when they show us what Freddy's changes are.
---
Myers isn't horrible at dealing with stealthy survivors since stalk will highlight those p3 claudettes hiding in plain sight, same with freddy.
---
"He only murders puppies, not kittens"  excuse doesn't make him less of an asshat.   He used being a complete toxic asshole to get him to where he is, and still regularly engages in it to keep his numbers up.
---
PS4 player here. I've had games where the killer disconnected during the match (rage quit after a failed facecamping attempt) and neither me or my friend didn't receive any bloodpoints. DbD devs, do you know about this? Anyone else have this problem?
---
I wish they had more consistent lighting/color. Freddy, Pig, Myers, and Doctor all look nothing alike in that regard. On the other hand, Trapper, Wraith, and Billy all match, and that looks good.
---
If that was fixed, I'd be down.
---
lil toonzy
---
Doctor and wraith. Mainly doctor though.
---
Oh lol
---
But really, what's seance ?
---
&gt; players quitting is a symptom of said very same players' selfishness and childishness.
---
True, but their attitudes can't be fixed with an update.
---
When I play Huntress I use Huntresses Lullaby to stop gen rushing, but a Hex perk is only good is the lit totem spawns in my favor.
---
You have been banned, reason: Doing your objective too fast.
---
Ok
---
Maybe they are not the best at hitting hatchets xD
---
Zombie is working more on animations these days. You guys could always come chill in discord with us!
---
My experience is that survivors aren't always "lingering." I've barely made it out of a legion game because he misplayed right by the door and gave me time to finish opening it and leave. Endgame means you just stand by the gate and it's a guaranteed kill if you know the survivor is in the area.
---
The killer still deserves points though, it's an easy kill for them, but forcing endgame with a hatch close means the killer is doing well enough to get the 4k anyway, and in other cases survivors that stay too long do deserve it.
---
Lmaooooo
---
Hag is fun. Just gotta lay traps everywhere. Places survivors wouldn't expect.
---
I feel bad for you because of the disconnect. Disconnecting players are frustrating for everyone.
---
I just want him to keep the dream world at least.
---
Ok so you don't care to level other survivors after having unlocked all the perks. That's your prerogative. Unlocking all the teachables still takes the same amount of BPs for killers and survivors. And that alone takes fucking forever, it's an ungodly grind. Good for you that you finished it and that you don't feel like you need to play any other survivor, but realize that it's fucking absurd that this very important milestone would take about twice as long to reach if not more maining survivor over maining killer.
---
You want to max out all killers, good for you, that's a nice goal, but the stance you're defending either completely ignores the situation of players who haven't unlocked everything, or outright supports a model where it takes survivors waaaaay longer to get their first proper meta build.
---
ok
---
The Nightmare because survivors underestimate the sweater boi and it's fun to see their reactions to being victims of the fedora man.
---
Doctor: I see you, ZAP!
---
Pig: Oink noises intensifies. A gameplay reason is that she's an all rounder. Stall with traps, crouch provides stealth, and ambush covers chases.
---
Legion is more fun after rework honestly. I like to frenzy a survivor and since their rework, they're more fun to fight and I've gotten WAY less DCs on XBOX.
---
I wonder the same thing... get to hit them with the D tho.
---
Playing freddy on lerys makes you discover a whole new dimension
---
im sorry, what cross am I dying on? Upvotes comments on a post agreeing with me and other users commenting about ass holes doing just this.
---
You're the one dying on the "might as well fuck my saviour over because maybe ez points" cross. Take a step back and think about the situation.
---
Small Game is available and lots of people use it now. I 10000% expect killers to have NOED so I sacrifice a perk slot for it.
---
Aside from legion, what major reworks have negatively affected killers? I never said the game favors killers, I think it‚Äôs actually pretty balanced. 
---
Yet, anything killers don‚Äôt like immediately gets nerfed.
---
The same can‚Äôt be said for survivors, so that‚Äôs why I said what I said in regards to OP‚Äôs question.
---
I personally don‚Äôt think NOED should be nerfed but with the amount of survivors that do complain, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd do something if BHVR catered equally. Crutch survivors perk get nerfed ASAP, yet nothing has been done to crutch killer perks. Ruin got a *buff* recently.
---
Until Nurse and Billy get nerfed (not as extreme as Legion‚Äôs nerf) and BHVR introduces some way for survivors to counter a mori offering, you‚Äôre delusional to think BHVR *doesn‚Äôt* cater to killers.
---
And regarding your initial question, long enough to have rank 1 killer and survivor achievements.
---
Yeah, which is why most huntress- umm, huntresses? Run whispers. But even then I'd say she struggles against super immersed players
---
theres going to be a gameplay reveal within the next 2 weeks
---
Love it. You should pick up clown or spirit next DLC sale, they're great
---
End Game Collapse
---
Had the entity take a survivor in the collapse for the first time a couple days ago. Can confirm it counts towards emblems as I wouldnt have gotten merciless without it.
---
it's going to be a Freddy rework, it MUST be a Freddy rework
---
and if it isn't then oh well i guess i'll wait some more
---
We all know you cropped out your hentai folder
---
Fucking yikes guys. You do realise JenDenise does the "Toxic Gameplay" for the meme right? Jesus fucking christ KillAllipSmackers. Fucking hell dude. You guys are actually gross...
---
&gt; Really, only the small unknown streamers are worth watching or paying attention to at all in the DBD community. 
---
well there's still Puppers
---
Here's hope that Legion's rework was absolutely abysmal because they were too busy turning Freddy into the absolute best Killer of the game.
---
Hm... Huntress. Hatchets are so satisfying.
---
I like Jen but that's a stretch
---
Tru3 literally says survivors are broken any time he loses as a killer, which doesn't make sense because the statistics posted by BHVR show that it's pretty much dead even in terms of amount of survivors that escape /get killed. Even after that was posted, he still clings onto that opinion.
---
I started watching him when I was learning the game, big mistake. Started watching Monto next to learn, and climbed to rank 7 in less than a month of starting the game.
---
Sauce is **Berserk** in case anyone is wondering.
---
Man, I followed his stream early on when I was watching streamers to pick up tips for being better at the game and I just couldn't do it. Between the exceptional levels of obnoxiousness and stuff like not understanding how to chew with his mouth closed...**NOPE.**
---
Have you tried playing wraith but never uncloaking? You probably won't deal with dcs
---
huntress should be in the Stealth-tastic tier since she is slow and has a 40 meter directional hum. she is the easiest killer to hide from in the game
---
This is the Internet so no. You are wrong and I will fight you until my last dying breath.
---
"Without scrolling" I mean, until they add more than 3 more killers. Sure then you can just condense it a bit more, but that only gets you so far. Scrolling is realistically future-proof, though it's more annoying I will agree.
---
Reddit just has the biggest hate boner for her and it's kind of disgusting.
---
what does that even have to do with this?
---
Yay, they fixed aura reading on Ormond.
---
It all went downhill from there ngl
---
one time i said "fookin dead ard" and got a bunch of downvotes and i don't understand why
---
I agree it's awesome, but does it actually mean anything? Is it from the show?
---
I don't see how it should allow that considering you're making the entity doing the work for you.
---
is there gonna be another bloodhunt event?
---
I do this if I know people are death on hook
---
FREDDY hentai folder
---
I have seen this meme on this sub so many times.
---
I understand joke, but i was survivor :D
---
It's a waste to use it
---
its hilarious if you're running STBFL. all the Meetle Of Man users obsessively throw themselves at you trying to get hit, and will chase you while you chase someone else, not realizing that doing so incapacitates two survivors instead of one.
---
Farmer can be fairly toxic as killer.  Even on his YT channel he had a bunch of videos playing toxic legion and crap, recently slugged me in a game, then triggered EGC to just watch me die in it making me wait all of that time.
---
NSFW plz
---
Yeah. And she insults damn near every killer she plays against, especially when they outplay her, for the "memes". Fucking yikes, man.
---
s a u s a g e
---
I‚Äôm only part way through the first season, but as far as I‚Äôm aware it isn‚Äôt a reference to anything. I guess he just needs to shit. I doubt the Entity provides toilets.
---
Hag if I step in a trap before I've seen the Killer.
---
I played a hag earlier today who destroyed our solo queue team, great trap coverage and amazing pressure. The next game i joined it was that killer again but this time it was freddy. Destroys us again but actually let me, and only me, go. Regardless, I finished my daily. Thanks nice Hag/Freddy!
---
I wouldve owned up to it if i had remembered exactly what i said and he is pretty bad at killer so i was just stating facts
---
Sounds like those canker plant things from a while back
---
Whaaaat. That's messed up haha. I play this game a lot and it's been like what, 2 years since its been on PS4? Taken that long just to hit 300.
---
Must've been a stream snipe.
---
I think it looks great and makes more use of the character portraits.
---
Spirit and nurse because they're complex and difficult to use. I like a challenge
---
Cartoonz was great on this stream
---
I hope the rework for nurse dosent completely fuck her over
---
Please the one we have now is bad
---
nice, needed  a decent laugh today lmao. Just throw a rock lol. such adept survival skills against a flesh eating hag.
---
Are you kidding me? You must be saying this for a meme. Are you seriously going to sit there and tell me EVERY single game she plays, its always pure raw toxicity? Are you seriously going to dogpile and waste your (Already meaningless) time just shitting on a streamer who gets just as much shit as she gives?
---
I feel like it‚Äôll be pretty good when it launches. They still have plenty of time to iron out the bugs.
---
Show some damn respect you worthless sack of human semen. Jesus Christ... You and everyone else dog piling make me sick.
---
Addons are insurance. Sure if I get a bushel of potatoes then I won't need my range or fatigue addons. But potato teams at rank 3-1 are rare and elusive.
---
I still think survivors should earn more blood points in general, but killers should always earn more given their role and how much they have to juggle just to keep the game from ending in 6 minutes. If addons weren't single use I wouldn't advocate for killer BP economy so much, and I'm a 50/50 player these days. My main survivor has been using the same toolbox for so long that I've amassed hundreds of then from the bloodweb.
---
Survival of the fittest baby.
---
A bandaid fix for Freddy for the past year could've been just making Class Photo part of his base kit tbh
---
There are still so many memes left to render though üò≠
---
&gt;Aside from legion, what major reworks have negatively affected killers?
---
okay sure:
---
&gt;Nurse got nerfed from normal speed and 3 blinks to less than 100% speed and 2 blinks; do you remember that one? You wanna go back in time and play against that nurse? Or, as I assume, you were never there to see it.
---
&gt; I never said the game favors killers, I think it‚Äôs actually pretty balanced.
---
then why did you say the following, can you elaborate?
---
&gt;BHVR has always catered this game for killers
---
&gt;I personally don‚Äôt think NOED should be nerfed but with the amount of survivors that do complain, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd do something if BHVR catered equally. Crutch survivors perk get nerfed ASAP, yet nothing has been done to crutch killer perks. Ruin got a buff recently.
---
Cool. That's my answer for you. I'll add this; survivors have better perks than killers. DS took 2 years to get nerfed. Exhaustion nerf took 1 year. Freddy has been shit for almost 2 years and he's still not been buffed. Ruin didn't get a buff - the lower tiers just got matched up to the higher tiers. It didn't affect anyone with more than 100 hours in the game.
---
&gt;And regarding your initial question, long enough to have rank 1 killer and survivor achievements.
---
lmao
---
&gt;Getting rank 1 isn't hard.
---
&gt;Not going to bother debating someone who has zero reading comprehension and deflects my questions.
---
I already answered everything for you. Don't resort to ad hominems when you can't defend your point. Nice debate fallacy.
---
Now, using your own words; Read my last post and fuck off.
---
Theres only a couple good windows on this map tho and windows are more consistent getaways than pallets which get broken and are useless.
---
I really don't care what your personal standards are when we're talking in generalities. Ofc if someone's being toxic people are going to be toxic back. 2 wrongs don't make a right
---
I'm pretty sure the only angry person here is the one personally offended about getting called out for being selfish
---
Nah, I just moved that to a different folder for the screenshot  ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Let us hope indeed.
---
Pig, oh wait...
---
I mean the vid title is toxic legion, hes supposed to play toxic, that doesn't mean hes like that all the time. And as for the slugging thing, how did you know it was him? He never has his name as Farmer John
---
I'm glad you approve.
---
All right, you made your point. I could really use a FEI Long if anything
---
This is a shittier version of noed... plus dbd doesn‚Äôt need anymore exposed perks
---
Spirit or Wraith with NOED,BBQ and Blood warden, but any M1 killer works.  Once the EGC starts hook a survivor and you‚Äôll be able to get the rest potential sitting at the gates, from there you‚Äôll win
---
When your injured and you use crutch perks*
---
There isn't one. That is just a Nea body blocking you as is the Dead by Daylight tradition. Treat the noobs in a way that they won't ever come back again.
---
You didn't provide a reason or an outcome. I am forced to infer based on the Plague's criticism that your use of the shack pallet was egregiously suboptimal. Most people play both sides, and the Plague player probably had more of an eye to it as a survivor, than as a killer who benefited from its misuse.
---
What we have is a fundamental misunderstanding of resources. There is exactly 1 reason to use the shack pallet prior to late/endgame. (1 or fewer gens remaining) That is to get someone who is on death hook out of the basement. It is not optimal usage, but it still will provide a greater increase in effective team influence than allowing your teammate to be downed and sacrificed. Most of the time, that is the person on death hook's decision to make. (Which is not selfish as, again, it leads to greater survivor pressure overall. 
---
For all other instances, you loop the shack until you get hit, then you leave to another location. That's how you use shack. The purpose of the shack pallet is to greatly increase the odds of preventing an endgame hook. It is 100% safe. The killer must break the pallet. That time can be spent to open a nearby exit gate or cleanse NOED. This isn't an opinion, this is how to play the game correctly. It is ***always*** better to play this structure in such a way. Even if not throwing it means you're going to be facecamped to death by Basement Bubba at 4 gens. 
---
Likewise, not cleansing against Plague until the gates are powered is (almost) universally better. She becomes a poor-man's Legion. You don't sacrifice any of your cooperative or altruistic abilities. It frees you to work on gens that are infected. It saves time. (precious!) It removes the penalty for saving teammates from hooks. There is one very niche situation where cleansing has value, and that's if you know that you are going to have an opportunity to body block the killer and force a bloodlust hit. Even that is questionable, because it wastes a lot of time and she may get around you anyway. (Not to mention that you've now created a time-bomb for everyone, ticking away until late game.)
---
All of the above is true if you are a selfless and thoughtful teammate. If, however, the only person you care about is yourself, well.... It's safer to find the hatch and stealth around the map when you aren't making injured/puking sounds. The shack pallet guarantees an escaped chase, after which you can immerse until someone else is found. The hatch spawns at any number of gens regardless, as long as you're the last person left. e.g. The standard soloqueue Claudette.
---
you can 100% counter NOED, there is no counterplay to MoM and there was no counterplay to old DS.
---
I need more dbd lore in my life.
---
All the resources are free. The models the software the YouTube videos showing you how to pose the models. The hardest thing would probably be texturing but even that is easy. You can download scenes for free. I would do it myself I just really have grown to dislike modeling. It can be boring after a while.
---
The issue is that its basically useless all the survivor needs to do is go to a pallet, you aren't gonna find someone and hit them in the first 30 seconds so tier 1 is useless, tier 2 and tier 3 have such a narrow window to use.
---
That Claudette needs to stop playing the game. Jesus Christ, talk about no situational awareness.
---
maybe they reveled charms in live..  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bnbbue/video\_about\_upcoming\_customization\_feature\_charm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/comments/bnbbue/video_about_upcoming_customization_feature_charm/)

Honestly with that change he probably wouldn't be getting this rework, 'cause people would get that he's got an amazing stall.
---
You're definitely not alone.

Baby meg saving their sprint burst walking to me and letting me go stage two. Happens almost every time theres a baby meg in my game

Right I was thinking of giving it a haunted grounds sort of thing with it but a friend said it sounded too op same thing with the time it was 60/75/90 or something like that
---
Last time I tried posting a gif it was automatically removed and it said new accounts aren't allowed to post gifs/videos.
---
Guilty. But I at the very least try to 2 hook everyone. And after that I just beat them up and let them heal. But then they start suiciding on hook... and disconnecting... :(

Yeah the bouncing rock was the best part!
---
Maybe 48 hours then? Just hope they don't have NoEd
---
Whispers &gt; BBQ aura reading for finding survivors. That's literally just a bonus. Most survivors on PC expect BBQ and aren't stupid enough to get caught out by it. If they removed the reading from BBQ I would still use it. And so would everyone else.
---
A hallowed blight inspired fan skin for ghostface.  
---
Apologies for the resolution, as it's part of a larger sheet I'm working on
---
Its weird because apparently this is happening to more people but I don't see posts or they get drowned, and BHVR isn't saying anything.
---
Yeah, it was something else, but after I played him, I checked his profile, recognized it, and saw he was streaming.  And I played him many, many times playing that toxic legion build and none of it wound up in any youtube videos.
---
I agree with most of this except:
---
Noed needs the crutch tier
---
Nurses calling is b
---
BBQ is a
---
Franklins is b
---
Shadowborn is b
---
Brutal strength is c
---
Pig and Michael Myers for me.  Being a sneaky killer is a lot of fun.
---
Damn sentsis you really are a crybaby about this aren‚Äôt you? Saw your comments on another persons comments and it was just you crying like a little bitch. It‚Äôs a game, people play for fun, stop being a little child and get over yourself. Cheers.
---
I mean you only use the best footage
---
It's a joke. There is a DBD streamer, his thing is blaming missed hits and lunges on "fookin dead 'ard" (he's british), any decent group of survivors that do objectives HAS to be a stream snipe or a 4 man SWF, and generally nothing is ever his fault.
---
Unpopular opinion: scary movie is just a giant r/woooosh that didn‚Äôt understand the first scream was 100% satire

*Cries in disconnect bonus*
---
It‚Äôs closed now, unfortunately. [Here](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1123240730770771968) was the tweet about it.
---
So did he play 100 games to be using the same build on multiple days over a week for the video?
---
it won¬¥t be useless against a nurse especially if she has longer blinks. OP
---
Pew pew
---
I assure you that Wraith is brilliant at countering stealth. Unless you have spine chill, he will know you‚Äôre there before you find him. Even with SC you‚Äôll find it really hard to hide from what you can‚Äôt see
---
Odds are they wernt him, that was around the time that the legion changes were announced, meaning that people were using up their addons
---
He asked how do you make one, so you sorta did avoid/ignore the question.
---
So I'll be that guy and ask you again, in a better way to understand I guess: Can you make a meme similar to this that you think is better or funnier?
---
I'm an asshole for doing that? I figured it saves a few seconds and helps the team. Same for when they do it to me. Plus it's hilarious to Kobe off the hook because of how hard it is to do. If it won't risk going into the second hook state, who cares? Going into the second state doing it is stupid and can screw over your team, but otherwise it affects, what 1000 points? You could argue it "wastes the unhooker's time" but you wouldn't have tried to Kobe if you weren't confident they'll get you before stage 2 anyway, so overall you are saving time.
---
Unless this whole thing applies to people who *immediately* try to Kobe. *That* is something to get annoyed about because now you have 20 seconds until they go into stage 2 and have to drop what you are doing instead of having a full minute.
---
Indeed
---
HERE COMES ANOTHER ROUND WITH THE RUBBERBAND MAN
---
Yeah. Maybe if it were just a notification bubble without the addon. The idea behind it could be that when Freddy activates his power, the other survivors temporarily drift into dream state. Same as usual, inside the terror radius they're hidden but are revealed when far away.
---
Are you high?
---
60fps on console.
---
How do you find good Nurses at rank 15?
---
I'm also arbitrarily removing bloodpoints from parties during EGC because why not.
---
As a console player, I'd like 100% increase in every aspect haha
---
Yeah, I don't have that many hours but I fear similarly.  I'm just holding out hope that he'll still be decent, mostly because I feel like if he isn't at least Huntress tier the community will pitch a fit.
---
Hello there.
---
The same way a hatch escape counts towards survival, even if you get 0 gens done.
---
im new what was his rework?
---
Hallowed Michael when
---
Whats the last one?? I cant seem to make that one out
---
Play nurse üëç
---
Id like a dbd2 to be like this game, have everything in this game, with better framerate and graphics, and then also more stuff like a new game mode, first person view for survivor, new maps and killers, a reworked progression system, stuff like that. I dream that it happens on next gen hardware.
---
Well maybe I can deny the unhook so they don't unhook me right in front of the killer and get me sacrificed. Instead how about unhooking me while the killer isn't nearby
---
to easy to be used for trolling, will never be added
---
You'd go from people hook farming each other to people denying perfectly safe unhooks out of spite. You could potentially restrict such an ability to within the killer's terror radius, but you'd be indirectly nerfing Borrowed Time because the hooked person won't know you have it unless you're in a SWF together, and thus may think you're trying to farm them instead of save them.
---
When?
---
Oh yeah, I don't want changes, I think it's great, just additions, new things, like first person, or VR compatibility for killer view, that'd be cool for those who like VR
---
Survivors would just hide until it's over.
---
You do also have to think about it from a time perspective. A killer has to wait on average, 2-6 minutes for a lobby, leaning more towards the longer side. A killer has to play the entire game, ALWAYS. When a survivor dies, they can still get a decent amount of bp, and start another game immediately. Killers don't make too much more, if anymore, on average. A lot of bp boosting perks have negative effects, like increased terror radius. Some good perks, as you mentioned, also have a boost, but most of them are behind a paywall of some kind. Such as bbq.  
---
So what kind of perks would you think would be fair to have a bp boost for survivors?
---
I've never used vr but that sounds like a dream
---
not to complain, but it would make farming much easier, as the easily farmed perks could be abused
---
lol... ban killers with shitty a strat that gives the other survivors an advantage. okay
---
Is this live on all platforms?
---
Pretty sure they got banned because they're parents never bothered to teach them basic manners. I mean, when I go up to a stranger on the street I don't just start flaming them because they look or act in a way I don't like. I keep walking. The same can easily be applied to streamers. If you don't like the content, just keep walking. Reddit humpers really need to get over this entitlement that they can say whatever they want on the internet without repercussion. If someone gets banned from a stream because they said something, there are thousands of streams to choose from. Instead of spending time and energy being unnecessarily hateful, maybe find a stream that wants to be called names and degraded. I am sure they exist.
---
Love toonzy! Great guy! Funny meme.

In general, I like Puppers. He's certainly not toxic, from what I've seen. I know people on here have said that he does not take certain opinions very well, he's dismissive, and he's blaming, but I haven't seen it. Mostly, I get bored watching him. There's not a lot to him, he's mostly on streamer autopilot "Let's get some party Puppin' lovin' in the chat for ____________" and the occasional cosplay. It's whatever, at least he's nice.
---
I've seen _streamdad on a bad day and I stopped watching him. He's probably one of the only truly representative fog whisperers, but that guy might as well be called _streamgrandpa for his stance on how anti-competitive he is, to a fault. Basically, he likes to be nice, but only if people allow him the luxury of being nice. Can't really say it's grace, because he gets quite upset with anybody that just plays the game at their true ability.
---
I enjoy watching Ohmwrecker, that guy is a stable of so many gaming communities. His commentary is hilarious and I enjoy his goofy voices and disposition. I just can't really stand how he plays killer. It's pretty much exclusively tunneling and camping. Great guy, just don't enjoy his gameplay as much.
---
HybridPanda is probably my favorite killer streamer at the moment. I know people here have beef with him as well. I have yet to see him be toxic and he plays killer a lot like how I play killer. He understands that other people want to have fun too and that really goes a long way.
---
In terms of small time streamers, AppleOrgasm, Meeeows, and CrunchyEggrollzz are shining lights. I watched AppleOrgasm take so much bm and shit from salty survivors the other day and he wasn't taken aback one bit. Not one salty remark, not one salty response. And the thing is, he didn't even play killer in a shitty, rage invoking way. Interesting chat, interesting fellow. CrunchyEggrollzz is probably the most skilled survivor I've ever seen. He's really chill and is salt free. Plus, he has a nice singing voice. Meeeows is just such a kind and energetic person. She enjoys the game and she's just nice to have on, no salt.
---
okay
---
Ruin isn‚Äôt a toxic perk....
---
Definitely the curse of streaming.   I've seen it rip the joy out of many.   Huge jump in energy when they go "full-time" and 6 months to a year later, the reality sets in and content either falls or goes to the lowest common denominator of their viewership.   Gimmicks become the norm, whether it be drunken stream, costume day, or giveaways.
---
*tips fedora*
---
The disconnects are getting out of hand due to no real repercussions. The good news is that they confirmed they're working on a fix, so let's hope it's soon.
---
Yeah survivors actually have to be hooked and injured so they can earn points, which is kinda against the logic of the game.
---
You're not wrong but she doesn't even cam up anymore
---
Thank you! Appreciate you taking the time to write that out. 
---
Also, I usually see de-pipping used in discussion as an action that people perform deliberately, isn't that something that would be considered unsportsman-like? Like a high tier survivor or killer purposely depipping in order to stomp newer players? I've also read that BHVR is unable to issue bans of any sort on PSN, some sort of issue with Sony? I don't necessarily need you to answer these since they aren't very concise questions, but again I appreciate the first response!
---
Why do people hate on BBQ? I think it's a great perk that really isn't broken in any way.
---
A pack of Dwights is called a Locker.
---
like someone mentioned a while ago, each streamer adds a 20% chance of getting stuck in the loading screen.
---
OwO
---
I stopped playing for a while just before the 3x event happened. BHVR *pls* make it happen again!
---
Awesome design, hope there'll be something similar this Halloween.
---
and honestly the gen rush and all that is fine if i have the chance to learn how to counter it. but i dont even have a chance
---
3 insta-downs is 3 stacks, which is enough to have MoM activate. However, 3 hooks also equals death.
---
The thing is i actually enjoyed watching him im from philly and hes from jersey and i understood that people from the northeast are a bit more abrasive then other parts of the country but hearing him whine like a bratty 6 yr old ab the same shit HE does on survivor made me say that in his chat i wasnt just watching him to flame on him, but yea now i dislike him.

Because you would have entered struggle had it failed. Also, slippery meat? Deliverance exists. Axe's luck perks exist. And you use slippery meat. (All the more power to you, you do you.)

Man Im really against being the first one to bring bad behavior into a game but this is Big Mood
---
Nerf every thing and let them walk slightly faster. It was pretty bad.

Also this mentality is just bad. You cant compare a stranger on the street to someone who puts HIMSELF out there for everyone to see just to throw tenper tantrums to 1k+ ppl
---

Meh. I know you didn‚Äôt ask, and that you don‚Äôt care, but I‚Äôd say that you‚Äôre the worse person in this scenario. 
---
‚Äò360ing‚Äô and ‚Äògenrushing‚Äô are not toxic behaviors. T-bagging definitely is. I don‚Äôt approve of it. That being said, you disconnected. I find that to be more unreasonable thing to do.
---
They allready made the scratch marks more clear in the previous patch I think
---
&gt;When the game starts, what's the main objective I should be focusing on? Gen Checking or finding survivors?
---
These 2 kind of tie in together, in the beginning of a game, you should go around and find a gen that is being worked on. That'll indicate to you that there is a survivor nearby who has worked in the gen from before. That is the easiest and most straightforward way to find survivors.
---
&gt;How long should I chase a survive that has been injured for? 
---
You should try to determine whether the survivor is good or not. If you seem to have trouble catching a specific survivor then it's best to give up on them and chase easier targets. Don't waste a lot of time chasing 1 specific survivor because that'll eventually cause you to lose the game
---
&gt;Recommended Perks for Killers? 
---
Every killer is different and benefit from specific perks. However, there are perks that are good no matter what killer you pick : Ruin, Bbq, enduring, spirit fury, nurses calling, sloppy butcher, save the best for last, brutal strength, bamboozle, monitor and abuse, make your choice and many more. This is a really controversial perk so it's up to you but noed. If you want an explanation on why these perks are good let me know. Generally you want to run ruin and bbq on all of your killers and the other 2 are dependent on what killer you are playing. If you are playing a killer who struggles in chases (trapper, wraith, doc) you want to use enduring and spirit fury. If you use a killer who does not struggle much in chases but could use utility (nurse, hag and spirit) then perks like nurses calling, sloppy butcher and make your choice are good.
---
&gt;How to keep pressure in the game? 
---
This can go really in depth but I'll try to not go super in depth. Pressure is important to understand in order to win a match. When you have a survivor hooked, you apply pressure to the survivors because one of the 3 survivors has to leave the gen they are working on to save the hooked survivor. If you find them this applies soo much pressure because there is a hooked survivor, the survivor who was going to save (who is being chased by you) and that means that one of the 2 survivors working on gens has to come save the hooked survivor while you are chasing the original rescuer. The most important tip I can give you for applying pressure is to know when to slug. Slugging is very important for gaining map pressure and doing it when the time comes can single handedly win you games. If you downed a survivor and there is a survivor nearby, it's best to just leave the downed survivor and chase the other survivor. This gives you a lot of map pressure as a survivor is being chased by you, another is on the ground and another has to save the survivor on the ground which means only 1 survivor is working on a gen. Certain killers are really good at slugging and snowballing like Myers (EW3), huntress because she can down survivors with her hatchets and throw them at others while one is down. If you want more information then I recommend you watch ohtofus guide for map pressure.
---
&gt;How to gen patrol correctly and what gens are the most important?
---
You generally want to stop generators that are about to get completed. If there is 1 survivor working on a generator and it is about to get completed,its best to kick it and chase the survivor off the gen. Killers and perks play a big part in this because certain killers can patrol gens really well like the hillbilly, and certain perks help you with generator regression and stopping generators like pop goes the weasel, corrupt intervention, overcharge, surveillance and discordance. Generators that are really close to each other are really important to protect because they can be easily patrolled and you can do a 3 gen strat with them. You also generally want to leave generators that are next to super strong tiles and loops. For example, in fractured cowshed, you should in most cases leave the generator there get completed since it is in, well, the cowshed. Which is a strong area for survivors to run you around.
---
I apologize if this was super long and annoying to read but I tried to be as informative and helpful as possible. Good luck in your future games!
---
You could say literally the exact thing with MoM, Adrenaline, Dead hard, and Self Care.
---
Claudettes with Legacy are also generally pretty chill. Then again most of us who have been around long enough for it are.
---
Once one of his fanboys see this and comments on it in stream.... They'll be here to brigade
---
Ps4 is usually alright, for me at least
---
Idk man, we *just* got the end game collapse
---
Hey, same here! A lot of people say m&amp;a is bad on huntress, but it's super underrated. The lullaby is 45 meters and her terror radius is 20 meters. Survivors don't escape if they hear the lullaby but they will once they hear the radius. Keeping it at 12 let's you sneak up on survivors, as the huntress. Which is pretty funny imo
---
B)
---
Amazing job, I love it! :) I'm also planning to cosplay as Susie in the near future but I have no experience in making masks etc. so it would be really cool to get some tips and help from you!
---
Evidence put forward by others state otherwise
---
That looks clean
---
Sure you can. Do you think any celebrity would put up with someone doing that to them in any context? It equates to the same. If you called into a radio show and starting telling the host how bad they were, would they not hang up and move on to another caller who is more in line with their show? It's all the same. Treat people how you want to be treated. If you want to be free to say whatever you want, make your on twitch channel and run it how you want it run. Until then just move on from channels you don't like and stop feeling the need to complain about them 5 months after you were banned from them. What's the point in holding on to that much negativity for that long?
---
I'm gonna be honest I have no idea what y'all are talking about
---
Rank 17 P3 Nurse. 
---
Wut?
---
What about shirtless Myers and bunny Feng?
---
[I think he means this](https://i.vgy.me/SEtq0Z.jpg)
---
I swear nurse mains are the biggest bullies
---
Reasonable answer.
---
I guess its because a game is a game, and you always play a game ready to lose. I know how annoying it is to spend an entire game on a hook, running for 5 seconds, on a hook again, rinse and repeat. So I don't do it to just anyone.
---
Toxic survivors are different because tbagging is never a positive thing. Nobody ever teabags to make a killers day better, it's always an asshole manuvuer whether you truly mean it or you just think youre being funny, so yeah I'll tunnel you to shit because even attempting to ruin my good time is going to make me ruin yours. Have fun mashing the spacebar because you couldn't /not/ be rude to strangers.
---
Would be the perfect time to reveal the rework, it makes sense.  Maybe do a text post a couple days before and then show gameplay the day of.
---
&gt; But I see killers say survivors shouldn‚Äôt just gen rush they should cleanse totems too and so Noed punishes them for not doing that. So surely adding a totem counter to get survivors off gens and cleansing totems to make the match longer is what the killers want?
---
&gt; 
---
NOED already does that simply by existing. If you are a survivor and know how to play, you will be looking out for totems.
---
The survivors that don't do that, come to reddit to bitch about NOED.
---
Sounds like you playin on Xbox.
---
I was t holding onto it i just happened to see this post and figured i could relate, however i think you‚Äôre the pathetic one here not me you fookin white knight LUL

Needed a lot of his cheesy mechanics, and nerfed his mend stuff.

Made him regular killer speed and his power runs out if you miss your swing, but you can run across the map because the time is very respectable.

Tell me you're psn name and I'll send you the normal screen then you will know his name okay or add me

---
i didn't wanna roast posts that i actually enjoy. Shirtless myers is overdone BUT they're pretty funny sometimes. and bunny feng is slowly disappearing from our concern, especially with ballerina feng on the way
---
De-pipping on purpose for easier matches is considered unsportsmanlike. You'll also hear of people de-pipping so their queue times are shorter, or so they can match up against a larger variety of players. I assume that at higher ranks there are fewer people, leading to matching against the same opponents, and having to wait longer.
---
I don't know enough about the banning situation to comment.

Also, why should we respect her while she gets off scot free for being disrespectful? No one should be immune from criticism no matter what age, gender, orientation, religion, etc etc etc. If she acts like shit, the world will reach around and bite her in the ass as a favor in turn.

Want to be respected? Respect others. Simple as that, treat people the way you want to be treated.

---
...wow...what a fucking joke of a human being you are
---
Seems to be lol
---
It's okay - we all have to learn the game somehow! If you're worried, you can run the perk Borrowed Time, which helps the unhooked survivor take a hit shortly after being unhooked if they were in the killer's terror radius when the unhooking happened. agh.. that sentence had a lot of unhooks. Hopefully it was clear though.
---

The Ghostface reveal is a definite for that date.

Sure you would chief ;-) P.S. I don't need to white knight any specific streamer, I doubt they care even a little bit about the karma farm circle jerk that is DBD reddit.
---
Legion is definitely not Jeff the motherfucking killer jfc
---
Depends on your weapon of choice lol
---
yeah I‚Äôm definitely fighting this change tho
---
Based on my opinion. He is.
---
That's no Myers, dummy. That's Quentin.
---
Yessss!!
---
Well it only works when all gens are completed which seems like a fair effect
---
Yeah, I haven't played for a few months. Ranked down pretty often
---
Your concept is..
---
Groovy.
---
I meant a general your, I kind of gathered you're not the type to do it. I get the "turn the other cheek" method but it still puts the onus on the people on the receiving end, which allows the behavior to thrive. As long as folks who bm can hide behind their internet anonymity and their "its just a game" mentality they have no reason to act decent.
---
I don't need to be throwing my controller at the wall in rage to acknowledge teabagging as an asshole move. I shouldn't be considered oversensitive for wanting some respect between two teams of people playing the same game. It costs no money to not teabag, and yet surv mains will act like they'll starve to death if they're told to stop.
---
My concern is that I'm not totally sure the devs understand what makes a killer viable. I'm sure they thought Plague was strong.
---
you shoulda put in just a plain white image
---
I have bought everything, my love. It's just a mock up and I didn't get the latest survivors/killers with the same quality, but a little faded, so I just made them into locked characters
---
That's a strategy that I've seen, that or the come here emote, and I'm usually a lot softer on them than a typical bmer. Just a quick shake of the head after I hook em and I go off to keep playing.  You can't really be upset on the one time it has strategic advantage, it's when a survivors tbagging behind pallets and at gates that it's :////
---
Either Pennywise or Alien
---
wait who are we talking about

Only on this concept picture though. ^^^^I ^^^^did ^^^^buy ^^^^him

Didn't hallowed blight skins made killers more monstrous? Concept is nice, but he just looks like he got some of that glowing thing thrown into him

---
Honestly between Clown and Plague, I definitely agree that there's cause for concern.
---
Gen rush only happens when you don‚Äôt apply enough pressure on the survivors. This could be for multiple reasons from your gameplay to their gameplay.
---
You never know. It could get it's own version in the normal game
---
I see this as an absolute win.
---
I play red rank Killer on Xbox and it never takes more than 3-4 mins to get a match. Problem is I play the same 10-20 Survivors every day
---
I think most of them are from me, especially in the last few days (except for a few). I just finished the show and my love for Ash is at an all-time high, and the meme potential is infinite. So many quotables. Hopefully I don‚Äôt become annoying with the Ash posts. Maybe I should slow down.
---
Also can we get a look at the survivor's side?
---
Who the hell asked for this?
---
It's useless anyway if there isn't at least cross progression.
---
Im guessing reskinned generator events and freddy rework.
---
No those extra bloodpoints belong to me and me alone :)
---
I tried something more monstery, but he ended up looking too different to ghostface
---
Slender man would be great as a stand-alone killer
---
I'll see what I can do. You can't solo start a match as a survivor though.
---
not familiar with sarcasm, are we?
---
&gt; selfcare
---
&gt; s
---
&gt; balanced landing
---
this is a pretty bad tier list honestly
---
Well you‚Äôre never gonna actually improve using noed, it‚Äôs always better to play without training wheels.
---
I mean we all collectively agree as a community that the bloodweb is a massive waste of BP most of the time. Being able to (mostly) choose which add ons you can get would be really nice
---
Ruin can be easily countered by sticking on a gen.
---
There's this guy Mr.Boogie from the movie Sinister he's pretty scary but I don't think a lot of people knows who he is
---
Shes all yours pal
---
&gt;It seems like they want you to lose the killer
---
The sad thing is, losing the killer isn't even as interesting as evading their grasp. There's no guarantee you lose the killer. Being more skilled won't stop the killer from "misplaying" by looking in a random direction and finding you there, restarting the chase. At least being able to continually out-run the killer indicates a high level of skill on your part. Being able to outwit them again and again seems like the more notable accomplishment, by comparison.
---
my bet: This isnt the phone, but the Switch Version, which they release soon

Why? You think my picks for S-tier is bad?
---
They can add some perk that references his notes that you collect
---
Charges usually are gained at 1 charge/second. A generator has 80 charges and takes 80 seconds to repair. Healing has 16, and using self care at 50% speed takes 32 seconds. A tool box that has 80 charges will fix 1 full generator.
---
Thank you! I wanted to ask Tru3 to sing me something, but I knew I wouldn't have understand shit
---
Of corse adam, he has 2 great perk while Kate has no perk useful
---
Nope, switch doesn't even have a touch interface and there's also other previous proof that indicated that it's coming to Android and IOS
---
Wow OP you exposed a lot of dumb cunts good job
---
Switch does have Touch, but whats the other proof?
---
Same with PlayStation unless your playing at a time where most people are asleep or something
---
Ok, so what would you consider S-tier?
---
Well leaks from the files have shown that this has been developed for android AND ios so prob not
---
Kate has:
---
* Dance with Me - A decent perk if used correctly, you can make killers lose you during a chase by vaulting or using lockers to juke. Also very fun perk to use in a meme build with Q&amp;Q to abuse lockers and make killers check them. 
---
* Windows of Opportunity - Noob friendly perk. Lets you see where all the pallets and window vaults are. 
---
* Boil Over - Useless perk.
---
Adam has:
---
* Diversion - Meme perk but rarely useful. 
---
* Deliverance - Very strong perk if paired up with MoM and Decisive Strike but half the time you will be hooked before you had the chance to activate it. 
---
* Autodidact - Useless perk more than half the time.
---
With that being said, I'd say go for Kate.
---
I'm sorry but this looks way too fake even if it is a leak. How would the game even work on a mobile device? It wouldnt,
---
that's not dbd lingo but a seance is a ritual lmao
---
really? havent Seen them
---
i love both of them but Adam, he actually has useful perks, Kate's perk DwM is pretty nice if you combo it with Lithe and Q&amp;Q
---
thanks, Dark
---
Self-Care is B tier
---
balanced landing is situational and only usable on certain maps
---
self care is just, really, really bad now after it takes almost a full minute to heal yourself
---
adrenaline is okay i guess 
---
id consider perks that are always usable and always provide an advantage like mettle of man, dead hard, etc etc
---
are you a newer player by any chance
---
I have found so many scooby doo monsters that fit the image of fan creations. The witch doctor the minor this guy

LOL XD
---
Yes, that's ghostface. And actually if I did have a few other people we could *maybe* get in a match.

no

Isn't it xfiles?

Well you‚Äôre never gonna actually improve using Mettle of Man, it‚Äôs always better to play without training wheels.

I am saying it should have other use beside duplicating your BP

hmhmhmhm BiggusDickus...
---
Where was I saying anything about MoM?
---
Assuming you're hooked every down and he has tier 3 everytime he hits you.

Is it random?

---
Killers too OP!!!! He can walk forward! Plz nerf!
---
I don't know, I love it all! It's all really amazing!
---
But lithe has nothing else to make it useful except the speed boost. Balanced landing keeps you from stumbling after a fall which is far more useful as it can cause the killer to swing and miss during a fall. And I guess you can speak for yourself but I rarely, if ever see more than one person using Dead Hard every couple of games in high ranks.
---
How do token-collecting perks work when you're playing as killer? I played trapper yesterday and used a perk (can't remember the name) but forgot all about it til the end of the game. Do the tokens apply effects as they accumulate or do you need to do something to activate them?
---
First survivor was Fen Ming. Was too scared to do gens, just walked around the map until everyone else died with 2 gens left. One of the survivors told me to get hatch. Took me 20 mins until the killer (Myers) yelled at me to stop being toxic or else he‚Äôd report me for holding the game hostage. Told him I was new and he gave me the hatch.

Seeing pharmacy and looting perks in general so low saddens me.
---
*fuck they're onto me*
---
Sorry for being dumb lol but what is that exactly?
---
This is actually really well edited, but... dat print be so tiny...
---
Yeah it looks like they're clicking a mouse as opposed to touch, glide, and tap of a phone
---
Oh damn don't worry then, I already know who is the new killer and probably all the people who surf this subreddit
---
Balanced landing is usable on every map apart from Shelter Woods, and allows you to run several infinites/loops on Lampkin Lane and Temple of Purgation. Most criticism I see against the perk is from inexperienced players that don't know the spots in which it could be used. 
---
Self care takes 50% of the time it would take someone else to heal you. So it's more efficiennet to self care than to let other people heal you. Self care can also be used in situtations where your  teammates are dead aswell. 
---
Mettle of man is high situational, you need to be M1 hit 3 times in order for it to activate. When playing against Billy, Trapper and Huntress you rarely take 3 M1 hits and thus making it weak in a lot matchups. 
---
Dead hard isn't S-tier because you need to be wounded in order to use it. Billy, NOED and other exposed perks counters it. 
---
New player? I have 600 hours for the record. However, you seem to lack basic knowledge regarding perks so how many hours do you have?
---
Well that's because I'm not playing it on mobile...
---
What's bill doing There!? (Console Nibbas be like)
---
a P3 nurse at level 56. You were going to play nurse regardless
---
I left farming perks in F-tier as you could instead save the perk slot and bring in the items to begin with. However I do understand that some people like to farm :D
---
It is literally impossible to have a hatch standoff now. Survivors can't be grabbed out of it and killers can just close it. Either way WILL end the game. If you have a hatch standoff now, both of you are idiots. As for the exit gate, they already nerfed Remember Me. And it is entirely possible that the survivor will escape through the hatch, or get out through the exit gate. Just wait until the killer leaves from checking the door you're near, then start opening it. And not very many maps actually have a spot where you can see both gates at once. Ormond has that ski resort or whatever it is, and you can't even see both gates from there.
---
Considering that this ranking system put me back at rank 13 at reset, it's understandable.
---
Ahh, a fellow intellectual
---
Can't hide im calling that number 119 I think you finna go to jail.
---
Its more enjoyable now
---
Just try to get more original titles and tumbnails
---
If you want you can check my youtube videos too understand what people wnat and dont want in the dbd community
---
The answer to your question is nothing. 
---
Survivors who would DC would instead just suicide on first hook.
---
I mean, they're not wrong. Trapper,Leather face, Doctor, Hag,Pig new legion, wraith and freddy are all shit or easily exploitable in one way or another. 
---
Lets compare that to all the killers that are very good at making chases shorter/ending them quickly. Lets see clown, nurse,myers,spirit,billy, and huntress all have abilities to end chases quicker or nearly instantly.
---
So who are the best killers at rank 1 when both parties know what they're doing and playing optimally?  Nurse, Billy, Spirit, Huntress and sometimes Myers. Go figure, imagine not having your power be countered by game knowledge or broken map design.
---
Just because they play a lot doesn't mean they are any good.
---
I left all of the luck based looting perks in F-tier as you could instead save the perk slot and bring the items to begin with. However I do understand some people like to item farm :D
---
Best perks for spirit.
---
Nothing. Can't really punish someone for dying on hook.
---
Honestly I kinda love facing the same survivors because we develop a sort of friendly rivalry after a bit.
---
Lmao
---
you know what else can cause a killer to swing and miss? dead hard.
---
you know what doesnt require you to be in a specific place at a specific time? dead hard.
---
you know what cant reliably close the distance between you and a pallet / window? balanced landing. 
---
you know what is very map specific? balanced landing. and dont say that "theres a spot on every map" because lery's has around 2 spots and they're both bad, or the cornfield maps that only have a house or a hill. unless you camp around them, you aren't going to use it every time.
---
maybe not stumbling during a fall is good, but the speed boost has rarely, if ever, made me lose a survivor. dead hard hasn't either, but it's made me miss and get pallet stunned.
---
if you think balanced landing is the best exhaustion perk then you're actually wrong.
---
also, you can say you rarely see them, but go on the youtube channels of high level killers / survivors and skip to the end of the match loadout screen. im doing monto right now and theres been 5 dead hard users in a row, even multiple. very few balanced landing, though. so im pretty sure you're just making that up.
---
&gt; if he has red paint brush+class photo.
---
that's a pretty big if
---
To your second question, yes, they activate when the gates are powered (regardless of if the survivors powered them by finishing generators or if the killer closed a hatch or whatever, either way they have been powered). I run Adrenaline so it's always funny if I am last alive, killer downs me, carries me to the hatch, drops me a few feet away and then closes it. They're surprised when I suddenly stand up and run away.
---
For your last question, it works on its own, although survivors might ignore it if they're not getting hit with Ruin. Other survivors might still break it because they're worried you're running Devour Hope or something.
---
I appreciate the compliment!
---
Candyman
---
If a survivor chooses to eliminate themselves from the game by suiciding there is nothing that can be done, they have ultimately not broken any rules or denied the killer anything - which DC‚Äôing currently does in terms of BBQ stacks. 
---
Entering a game cannot be a prison sentence of ‚Äúyou must play this out or else!!!‚Äù
---
It's mostly fine tbh
---
Thanks, i posted it because it's pretty common and pisses me off. Specially when they get the 4% and deny me the unhook points after running all over the map to do the save.
---
We got it. It's just a tired old "joke" at this point
---
Way to copy/paste this wall of text on here and the forums.
---
Regardless, this entire thing is operating under several erroneous assumptions.
---
* That the issue of end-game stalling pre-EGC was "fringe" instead of a common issue of both hatch stand-offs and other scenarios where games would not finish in a timely manner due to toxic behavior
---
* That the EGC is somehow supposed to favor survivors. I've seen this over and over, people complaining that it's too hard to win in this kind of a 1v1 scenario.
---
The EGC collapse is fine as it is, but I'm sure they'll tweak it as time goes on. As far I'm concerned it achieved the majority of what it set out to do.
---
It seems so many people are stuck in the old mentality of "Hatch = lol, free escape for me, gg ez baby killer". Now it's only this if the survivors finds it first. If they don't then look at what the situation is (assuming we're talking about a game where hatch has been close/no gates open)
---
* The survivors have failed to power the gens
---
* The remaining survivor has failed to find the hatch first
---
* The remaining survivor now has to eat the fact that for all intents and purposes, have lost. Whether it's directly their fault or not doesn't matter. The 4 have failed to beat the 1. 
---
* Despite the above, you can still possibly get a gate open or re-open the hatch if you brought/found a sufficient key
---
It's not meant to be easy or likely. It's just meant to speed up the natural conclusion of every game that has reached this point.  I've only managed to do it once, by following the killer right after they close the hatched and opening a gate right after they checked it. If I was running Wake Up I know I could have escaped a handful more times because the 3 second difference would have gotten the door open in time. 
---
So I guess in the end, it's down to the age old advice that killer's are always told "Just run Perk X,Y,Z to counter it lol". If you're concerned about opening a gate I highly suggest giving this once meme-tier perk a try. 17 seconds VS 20 will get you out of more games then you imagine.
---
Sure do you have a link for me?
---
At least killers would get the points they lose when ppl DC
---
Nothing to stop the killer from chilling with their face in a corner with insidious as well. People want punishments for others in a game that has no set rules or a set way to play. They just want to force their will on other people to play how they want them to play and if they don't they should be punished for it in some way. It's ridiculous.
---
1 Distortion consume a token for your OoO.
---
2 Wake Up and Adrenaline activates, Fire Up no.
---
3 Yeah, I guess, but nobody plays Doctor and that build seems weak in general.
---
4 Dark Devotion trigger effects from perks or powers like Coulrophobia, Unnerving Presence or Doctor's static field on the survivor's terror radius, ut Dark Devotion is trash, you souldn't use it.
---
5 Hex:Haunted Ground can work on its own, but if you don't run it with other Hexes, than survivors can just ignore the both totems.
---
I play on my phone
---
The motion is really mousey and very human like (there are corrections). But I was making a joke.
---
I don't agree with 5 perks which are self care metal aith plunders and wgtlf. aith plunders and wgtlf should be d tier and self care and metal should switch places.
---
what? self care does not take half the time to heal. it takes double. and you're telling me i lack basic knowledge? what? that's funny
---
Okay, thanks. The between games was my biggest question so I can live with that answer. My need to understand how things works is bugging me. Like, if I use a toolbox and click a generator and let go immediately, did that consume a full charge or does it remember that I started a charge and finish that off before consuming another one. Things like that keep me up at night.
---
If you make something just hit me up ill watch it.
---
Is Jeff a good character or just a meme itself
---
Just search for thatbrownmonster and it should show up
---
Check my oldest dbd video called nerf michael
---
And then watch a more recent montage too see how the jokes and music change
---
Up the ante and some pickled lips do combine fairly well with slippery meat at least.
---
That's basically my point.
---
yes, PlayStation servers seem unnaturally active recently.
---
and no, it doesnt let you run infinite loops. theres still a stumble time and killers dont have any. so you've managed to be wrong almost completely.
---
He clearly means that the same can be implied about survivor perks.
---
Your logic is pathetic.
---
One more question what was he like pre nerf?
---
Yes.  But then it should be punished as well, shouldn't it?
---
Another option would be to remove the struggling, which is super pointless anyway in my opinion.  It would be enough to remove the ability to attempt to unhook after the first phase is over.
---
I wasnt realy focused on tumbnails or a title i just wanted to make something poeple could excelly lay there eyes on and not puke. And noe that i know that its atleast ok i can work on eberything else and also still upgrade my editing.
---
Thanks alot i apriciate it so much
---
Like I've said earlier you could save the perk slot by bringing a med kit yourself.
---
Simple. Clean. Effective.
---
Nice work OP!
---
No thank you, i'm gonna keep using Ruin. I like it when my games last more than 5 minutes. Fuck BBQ, nurses and noed tho
---
Trapper or Doctor

It's not the greatest but i can tell you've worked hard to get this far, keep it up you're only gonna get better :D
---
That has nothing really to do with punishing for the sake of punishment, but with the fact that survs eliminating themselves prematurely make the game considerably harder for the remaining survs to win.  Also frequently it causes them to depip needlessly.
---
Yeah, i do still kobe 1/3 games without any luck stuff just slippery meat, im a god at timing the kobe lol, 2/3 with luck stuff and probably 2/2/3 with up the ante
---
No, it does not work like that. The mechanic is there so survivors/killers no what stage they‚Äôre at in eliminating/being eliminated. If a survivor decides they do not want to play a match out, they have every right to just not struggle &amp; die. Is it douchy and selfish, yes but ultimately their decision and killer still earns the kill/sacrifice points.
---
you're correct if you look at his comment history you can see him being a whiny insufferable cunt
---
Can I get a TLDR version pls
---
Unhooking someone within the Killer's Terror Radius doesn't happen enough to justify the perk in S-tier in my opinion.
---
No. Struggling prolongs the time you can be resqued, so shouldn't be eliminated. If you're the second last person in the game, and the last survivor found the hatch, you can kill yourself to make the hatch a viable option for that survivor, so suicide on the hook can be a tactical decision and shouldn't be eliminated either.
---
What's this hatred for this anyway? Who wronged you?
---
its not a slim chance there are maps where there is no chance and thats my point , these changes are to remove the NO CHANCE situations
---
360 is a problem for new people. When you spin in circles the entire match to avoid a hit its straight bs and is apart of the toxicity that comes with it. A rank 15 player with 3000 hours isnt fun to play against when you have 300 hours. Then they message people afterwards to torment them some more. Anyone that does that deserves to not be able to play.
---
So is the battlepass thing confirmed real?
---
Shirtless hallowed Michael
---
Pig, Myers, [leaked killer]: we **are** stealth
---
Oh shut up. Take my downvote you stuck up ass wipe.
---
Except suicide can be strategy so this point is moot. Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it should be banned dcing however, is just dumb and could not be punished hard enough imo
---
If you always go through life expecting the worst, you're a fool. Have hopes! Never be negative! Always try and smile! Just believe! I know you have it in you!

---

- dbd mobile

Self care makes you heal at 50% of your healing speed by yourself, which takes 32 seconds. If someone else heals you it's twice as fast taking 16 seconds, however both you and the person healing you loses 16 seconds each. Because of the penalities of doing group repairs on generators, playing solo and healing your self is more efficient.
---
Strider is really strong on her, BBQ&amp;chilli, make you choice could be awesome and ruin or pop goes the weasle for gens
---
That‚Äôs not a tldr
---
I found something hinting it, but so far I haven't been able to find concrete evidence.
---
Man I have blue balls over Ghostface, he can't come any sooner? I need to Tbag some survivors ASAP.
---
Found the guy who thinks NOED is lovely
---
don't forget you can't wake someone up if you're asleep.
---
I have been unable to heal people at times so yea pretty sure that's a bug. it's not very consistent tho
---
There is but you can only play with people also on that version. There is one really old one when Michael came out that's quite popular
---
Neither. Get David or a killer.
---
Right now I use surveillance, sloppy, nurses and rancor because I am only level 15
---
Generally for actually escaping , self care is pretty bad now.  You waste so much time doing it  and most  top tier players no longer bring it. I do not think self care is S tier , maybe A tier now . S TIER perks are probably d strike, mettle, adrenaline , balanced , dead hard , BT as least.
---
Holes!!! Lol
---
Yep, my friend who was awake tried to wake me up but couldn‚Äôt. It was really weird.
---
&gt; For all other instances, you loop the shack until you get hit, then you leave to another location. That's how you use shack. The purpose of the shack pallet is to greatly increase the odds of preventing an endgame hook. It is 100% safe. The killer must break the pallet. That time can be spent to open a nearby exit gate or cleanse NOED. This isn't an opinion, this is how to play the game correctly. It is ***always*** better to play this structure in such a way. Even if not throwing it means you're going to be facecamped to death by Basement Bubba at 4 gens.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Likewise, not cleansing against Plague until the gates are powered is (almost) universally better. She becomes a poor-man's Legion. You don't sacrifice any of your cooperative or altruistic abilities. It frees you to work on gens that are infected. It saves time. (precious!) It removes the penalty for saving teammates from hooks. There is one very niche situation where cleansing has value, and that's if you know that you are going to have an opportunity to body block the killer and force a bloodlust hit. Even that is questionable, because it wastes a lot of time and she may get around you anyway. (Not to mention that you've now created a time-bomb for everyone, ticking away until late game.)

One of my biggest problems is you are making a bold statement from evidence that came from a toddler's testimony and making conjecture out of it. That in itself isn't a big deal but that is one of your support arguments against my position.
---
&gt; You're complaining about other players prejudging you to behave in a way that you behave. Please tell me the flaw in my logic. 
---
You just went into more detail explaining the game mechanics and strategy. One of my problems is that you tie together the game mechanics and somehow turn it into selfishness if the strategy isn't followed. The way I can best explain it is in this copy and paste:
---
### False Dilemma/False Dichotomy
---
This fallacy has a few other names: ‚Äúblack-and-white fallacy,‚Äù ‚Äúeither-or fallacy,‚Äù ‚Äúfalse dichotomy,‚Äù and ‚Äúbifurcation fallacy.‚Äù This line of reasoning fails by limiting the options to two when there are in fact more options to choose from. Sometimes the choices are between one thing, the other thing, or both things together (they don‚Äôt exclude each other). Sometimes there are a whole range of options, three, four, five, or a hundred and forty-five. However it may happen, the false dichotomy fallacy errs by **oversimplifying the range of options.**
---
To say nicely. You took a generalized idea that would be good to follow/strategy then tied it together with the killer's critique of my actions/conjection/opinion proceeding to point it in my direction as if it had a cause and effect relationship with me and your proclaimed 'claudette stigma' and that alone is detrimental against the efforts I made in my original post/argument. Essentially saying because the killer thought I dropped the god pallet prematurely/incorrectly I  support the negative image against claudette overall, therefore I mustn't complain about any backlash I may receive until I decide to stop being 'selfish' and make better decisions by choosing to not go against the guidelines you have listed. I really disagree with many points you have made. I don't disagree with the strategy but everything else is too hairy for me to explain in an A -&gt; B format.
---
What do you want them for?
---
If it's for perks, Ash and Laurie. Might want to wait on Ash though as MoM is probably changing soon.
---
Im happy cause I didnt see the original post and this is funny as fuck
---
Unless you're a baby Dwight or Nooby Claudette.
---
I hope the major reveal isn't ghost face I know it would've been awesome if he never leaked, but sadly every YouTuber made a video on his leak so it was impossible to avoid it.
---
But it‚Äôs good to know that I am not going crazy and it is a bug üòä
---
I think you mean üÖ±Ô∏èing üÖ±Ô∏èong
---
I don't know. I got a lot of disconnects with because of not using more than 1-2 traps until the gates are powered. I liked being stuck with survivors running around.
---
Because it's a waste of a time to heal yourself for 40+ seconds when you can just do gens instead.
---
If that means no more spawning in and having no fucking clue where my Ruin totem is until its cleansed or I'm 2 feet away, I am very happy.
---
I would start with what perks do you want?  Then play the survivor that has it that perk.  Then level up that player until your go-to perk becomes teachable so it can be used on any survivor.
---
Once you do that, all survivors are basicly chosen for looks (cosmetic reasons) and not gameplay really.
---
Unless it‚Äôs Claudette, who is often picked regardless of perks because she has the darkest outfit in the game and is able to hide better than the rest.
---
But speed freaks get Meg.  I believe.
---
Exactly, there's a lot of reasons to suicide. If you're being heavily  camped and you know you're not getting off that hook and the gates are open, you can kill yourself to prevent your teammates from getting equally killed. Or maybe you're against a killer who is really upset that they have to go to bed soon, so they just repeatedly hit you on hook. You shouldn't be forced to sit there getting BM'd over and over because you chose when to play out a normal part of the game process.
---
The punishment is the depip and low bloodpoints. Any other punishment would be too much imo.
---
do you want every killer to be nurse and billy? because that's how you make every killer go nurse and billy.
---
Enduring so you're not afraid of going for the phase lunge when the surv is next to a pallet. Can't go wrong with BBQ or Ruin. 4th slot is up for experimentation I would say.
---
It's always a great idea until a trolling killer decides to trap you in the basement. Sure, they'll get banned but they were gonna get banned anyways. You now have a 30 minute ban penalty. Killers already facecamp for no reason so I expect basement trappings to become more frequent in the beginning and then taper off to those few annoying games every once in a while.
---
Oh my god I can't even with Sinister. Definitely a movie in never watching again, it still keeps me up at night sometimes.
---
we may never know
---
You can not control everything in an online game. Its like playing a ranked game in lol/overwatch/dota/etc and having one guy trolling arround, or just playing bad on porpose. Online games are just like that
---
1 charge  = 1 second at base speed. It takes 16 charges to heal, 80 charges to do a gen. Increased speed makes you do the action at more charges per second. Increased efficiency makes you use less charges to do the same amount of work. It's practically more charges.
---
That's a solid build, rancor is the only perk I'd switch out and I'd personally switch it out for strider but I think strider is the best perk of the spirit so I am a bit biased.
---
if  one paragraph is to much for you i cant help you bro.. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Okay?
---
You only lose rank progress, not points.
---
Thanks fam. Will level up nurse then
---
Chess with a 10√ó10 board?
---
But... but that's the beauty of it...
---
Yeah I thought we were gonna get that a bit sooner though but still, will be a welcomed feature when we get it
---
Exactly. It‚Äôs always fun to gamble with your friends if boosted killer you are going against gonna have NOED or not.
---
It's an unfinished mobile port, no shit it looks ass lmao
---
It was happening with me. Ar first I associated it with the Killers internet, but then it started happening in 50 ping lobbies. I know internet fluctuates, but not that much or that often when you're joining mew hosts every game.
---
That's not the biggest deal though. Another problem would be if you keep kicking farmers off they are just going to let you die.
---
The ghost and bone clapper are underrated and very cheap add ons. So many gen pulls can be done with it.
---
It was Midnight when I finished this so I must have just blanked. I would have it work on a Tier system like old Devour:
---
Tier 1: Exposure immunity. Tier II: Cannot be grabbed from gates. Tier III: Cannot be grabbed from totems.
---
I consider noed a crutch so I don‚Äôt use it
---
I like it. The only thing that would top last year's Hallowed Blight would be this with a skin for Clown.
---
Yep didnt take long, hence why i deleted it. What a shame to ruin a meme like that.
---
That's one part of it. You can also self care if you escape and you're alone on your side of the map or your teammates are dead. Medkit heals with selfcare is litteraly faster than teammates healing aswell. There are lot of reasons why I ranked it S-tier.
---
They announced MoMs change. 
---
Essentially, you only build up stacks from protection hits, but I believe those protection hits can be from anything, not just an m1(Dont quote me on that). And you can be at full health and enter the dying state when MoM is charged and it will still work.
---
 I Got this glitch on Console
---
Thantaphobia does nothing, it only adds about 8 seconds to gens
---
I left because hag was camping you with noed. I ran around and looked for the totem and now the egc timer is getting low. Stop expecting people to save you in impossible situations. Everyone's had matches where they carry the team and die when the gates power. It's how the game goes.
---
Lol... why bad killers should rank up and have green, purple or red rank? If you play like trash back to dumpster.
---
I really hope we don‚Äôt get a stupid battle pass. Next thing you know there will be a killer battle royale gamemode.
---
Why do I get a scream vibe from the 3?
---
i only try for the kobe if i'm about to hit the struggle phase, since beyond that you just cant.
---
The game isn‚Äôt even out on Switch yet, and barely runs well in PS4 &amp; Xbox; you think they are gonna come out with a mobile version any time soon?
---
Yeah, I could see how that could become a problem. I wonder if making the stairs slightly wider so the killer couldn't completely block it would work.
---
Plague could be a little higher, her vomit is a good indicator for finding survivors, if they touch something you puked on they will get sick, inversely if they are fully sick themselves, they infect everything they touch. Meaning they can't hide in lockers to well and give information to you if they go back on the gen you just puked on.
---
The guy is a cunt, completely unnecessary trash talk but ruin has nothing to do with this
---
I'd be inclined to agree. The majority of the stuff that will be "revealed" there, we have most likely already seen. Ghostface, licensed cosmetics. Switch release is another likely one, but why exactly should anyone that already plays the game be excited for that? On the contrary... And even the main surprise will probably be the 3rd year anniversary event stuff. 
---
I'm not expecting to be positively surprised. Maybe we will finally get to know whether the next Chapter is actually a "Chapter"? Or maybe we will get a schedule for the 4th year. That's about all I am anticipating could be there.
---
Can we have this pinned on top of the homepage?
---
Yea, you also have corners and such but that's really really petty to throw to make one person DC. And that'd be a good idea. Just enough to squeeze past if they are directly in the middle.

I loved /u/LOL_Scorpion17 's reply, so I added it to the pic
---
I mentioned it in another comment, but in Hindsight I realize that "precise timing" isn't a good drawback because people will just learn it. I like the idea of the perk still since it's based on that iconic scene from Scream (it's even named after it, since Halloween was on the TV), but I'd make it a %chance based perk so it is truly a high risk/reward. The idea was for it to be a "last chance" when you have no pallets or windows but a locker handy, but the general consensus is that it would become too easy to abuse after awhile.
---
Thank god I'm not alone

Punishing DCs lets Killers get the BBQ Stacks/Points they would've permanently lost (We really need to change the DC points to Sacrifice...)

That Survivor is going to get barely any bloodpoints and screw over the other survivors by eliminating themselves earlier than normal.
---
If Hook Suiciding starts becoming a bigger issue after DCs start getting cracked down on then people will complain and it'll start being punished. (losing emblem, become a reportable offense, 3rd thing...)
---
Anything to remove scrolling I‚Äôm all for. Scrolling is kinda dumb, I like to be able to see everything at once and not have to scroll around all the time
---
If 4 members of your team is affected by thantophobia it adds 12.8 seconds to each generator. If you have more than 3 generators to go, it's about equally efficient for everyone to self-care before taking the generators. Also it's a lot safer not be wounded in most cases.

DIE KRANKENSCHWESTER IN DIE KRANKENHOUSEN
---
The second one seems very strong. I imagine the 3% is due to the fact that the hex would be revealed once a survivor is hooked. Because I dislike running hexes, I would be happy with 2% per hook and sacrificing a survivor removes a token. I‚Äôm happy to hear feedback
---
Sprint Burst is not nearly as good as any other exhaust perks. Not being able to run around the map because your exhaust perk will go on cooldown is a huge penality slowing down your gameplay. It also doesn't help nearly as much as other perks when getting chased.
---
So I‚Äôm guessing this confirms the battle pass leak too? :(
---
You‚Äôre not going to have 80 seconds worth of repairs completed at the start of the trial.
---
It has everything to do with punishing just for the sake of doing it because "waaaaa I didn't have fun. Poor me." You're not offering a solution to the problem and only a punishment in spite of the people who do it for various reasons that they feel are valid. 
---
If I've gotten a corn map consecutively for the 3rd or 4th or even 5th match in a row, without anyone using a coldwind offering, I'm out. You can't make me play a match that I'm sick of because the game doesn't know what the fuck map rotation is. If I'm being relentlessly tunneled for an entire match and dumbfuck teammates aren't doing a god damn thing, I'm out. You're not gonna make me sit through that shit. 
---
You know how many times people dc when I'm playing survivor? A lot. You know what I do to avoid depipping? I do what I normally do with a 4 person team until there's only 1 person left. Is it harder? Eh, a little bit. It can be depending who the killer is and their skill level but it isn't immeasurably hard either. Don't sit on the hatch or in a locker like a punk ass bitch and you'll either safety pip or get a pip. There were a few times last night that I double pipped with having 1 person DC at the very start.
---
Quit bitching about wanting to punish people just because you have no real power in life.
---
i still go after them, just after ive hooked a few of their friends first
---
Ohno

what about but no one steps in your traps
---
They may announce it coming either soon/at/after the Switch release for Mobile.
---
I sadly think we're getting one. And I wouldn't be surprised if we get that.
---
Lol what plunderers is atleast a b tier you can get good ass items plus a key possibly for a hatch escape so?
---
The controls can easily work in a mobile DBD, Identity V is basically a spin off of DBD and imo it‚Äôs wonky but the game shows it can be done
---
Yes I‚Äôve had the same problem. I thought I was the only one.
---
I'm seeing a lot of disagreement regarding what should or shouldn't be considered S-tier. But atleast my post sparked an intressting discussion. Feel free to make your own tierlist at:  [https://tiermaker.com/create/dead-by-daylight-perks-51241](https://tiermaker.com/create/dead-by-daylight-perks-51241)

---
dun dun DUNNNNNN
---
It's just random players, but it happens to a lot of people. Its very weird.
---
I meant there would be time inbetween these actions, not all in a single chase at the beginning of the game.
---
I mean, a large part of what drives people to d/c is because it's widely viewed as a "FUCK YOU" to the killer by depriving them of points and hook-based perks. 
---
If the general mindset switches from "Fuck this killer, he's not going to get anymore points from me, I'm out! &lt;pulls plugs&gt;" to just suiciding on the hook that is fine with me. I'll still get my BBQ stack / PGtW activation / Lullaby token etc AND I have to deal with one less survivor.
---
ALT+TAB increases the chances of DbD freezing.
---
Did you just link a post where everyone in the comments talks about how it‚Äôs fake and even the reason who posted it hinted it was fake?
---
&gt; Balanced landing is usable on every map apart from Shelter Woods, and allows you to run several infinites/loops on Lampkin Lane and Temple of Purgation. Most criticism I see against the perk is from inexperienced players that don't know the spots in which it could be used.
---
How can a situational perk effective more on certain maps than others be S-tier. There‚Äôs literally a map where the perk cannot be triggered. 
---
&gt; Self care takes 50% of the time it would take someone else to heal you. So it's more efficiennet to self care than to let other people heal you. Self care can also be used in situtations where your  teammates are dead aswell.
---
It‚Äôs not more efficient, it‚Äôs equal efficiency. The downside is you‚Äôve lost a valuable perk slot. Yes the upside is you can heal when teammates are dead, but should you really be entering a game with that mindset to run a perk that will allow you to take an extra hit while you search for hatch? Also, have you considered the great risk you put yourself in if the killer has Nurse‚Äôs? 32 seconds is a lot of time for the killer to find your healing aura. (40 through mangled). This risk is greatly reduced if you allow a teammate to heal you in 16 seconds or even 8 if they run We‚Äôll Make It. (20/10 through mangled).
---
&gt; Mettle of man is high situational, you need to be M1 hit 3 times in order for it to activate. When playing against Billy, Trapper and Huntress you rarely take 3 M1 hits and thus making it weak in a lot matchups.
---
Apply your situational logic to BL. I do agree MoM will most likely never come into play against Huntress and Billy. (But not sure why you‚Äôd say Trapper unless he runs insta down traps).
---
&gt; Dead hard isn't S-tier because you need to be wounded in order to use it. Billy, NOED and other exposed perks counters it.
---
Again, apply this logic to BL. Or make DH S-tier.
---
I'll tell you that yes, Legion is now a doable Killer. It works for both Survs and Killers. However, if you played Legion without taking unfair advantage of the silly mechanics and broken add-ons, it was a very fun Killer in a way that can't be experienced anymore because they fixed it and now the experience is much shallower than before.
---
They simply took most of the fun things and tuned them down or downright destroyed them and said "there, it's fixed" without giving anything in return.
---
It was an efficient rework, but wasn't fun IMHO.
---
I have seen it at least 5 times counting this one
---
I've been saying this for three years - the unhooking needs to be a handshake mechanic, the unhooked must agree to being unhooked.
---
Bond is right there on A tho
---
Look at that beautiful man
---
You'll be waiting a long time
---
Dunno why you think someone would take head on anyway. The ability fails 9/10 times and is getting updated. They even said on the live stream that barely anyone can use it.
---
I just play hag and they shine at the wrong spot.
---
slim chance is doors at both ends of the map, no chance is both doors within eyesight or on the same wall.. these changes would be to remove the NO CHANCE scenarios. its to make the killer work for that last kill, not just wait for it
---
Dude it was in the dev build you can literally access it if you have a copy of that on your pc üíÄ the comments literally talk about how it‚Äôs real too üëÄ that a lot of effort to just fake an entire mobile port in a video for a few upvotes.
---
A rare Psych meme appears!
---
Good luck in future games :)
---
It's alphabetical. Purple &gt; green.
---
The Demogorgon from Stranger Things.
---
Nope lol its heavy and it squished my nose :)
---
I do know.
---
I look at DBD memes.
---
True...but it doesnt change that it looks badly and the fact that i doubt many people will play it...
---
It does sound like a good idea and thats what i speculated when it was announced but, its too over powered plus theres no way to win a chase, constant looping would be an issue and split screening would make it incredibly difficult.
---
When i heard the rework i was excited we would get a stealth killer that could blend with curivivors i.e.e a terror radius timer or a killer that could infiltrate and wreak havoc with gens and do damage whilst "repairing" also on a timer before having to strike someone or going into a fatigue state where all survivors become aware of your location. 
---
Legion has been reworked the way he/she/they have/has in prder to be rebuilt from the ground up.
---
Hope you appreciate my input
---
I would take it with this because it would be a fun combination, especially if you disappeared in a locker later? Why are you trying to hard to crush the fun I'd want to have with your perks?
---
we'll be good for the next 3 updates
---
Yh fair enough
---
So many memes gets reposted at least 4-5 times each month, and somehow still make it to the frontpage.
---
There‚Äôs place for another row on the right, so make it 6 updates
---
Or they could hit you in frenzy, end their frenzy, and m1 you?
---
Very insightful thank you! I suppose moving it to an 8% max speed penalty is perfectly fine! And yes, the survivors would of course be notified if Hex: DD was active. Might I ask your thoughts on the other two perks?
---
How is Legion a knockoff Jeff? Jeff's a 13 year old's shitty edge-lord oc, it's hard for anything to be a knock off of that.
---
Yh fair enough, the game feels like it‚Äôs more for the killers not so just proposing ideas to help balance game
---
Tell that to my immersed teammates.
---
Intent was difficult to read sometimes on the internet. At first you sounded like a killer saying sarcastically "man that sounds like fun" and dissing my idea. Sorry.
---
The best part is playing Huntress and having people hide in lockers. Like, dude, those are literally my ability-refuelers. Why would you do that?
---
I'd put a higher speed, but anything higher would probably make it way too op, it really should do something along the lines of multiple killers. We have ghost face coming up which could be a single specific killer from Scream, so I dunno.
---
Such a simple idea actually, but it still looks amazing.
---
Okay, first, it's not a "no chance scenario". Minimal? Undoubtedly. The previous incarnation of the hatch was very one-sided, making it so that it didn't matter who found/reached hatch first, the survivor always had the advantage. As long as the survivor was relatively near the thing when it was open, they were pretty much garunteed the escape. 
---
Second, think about what led up to the endgame. The team, as a whole, *failed*. The last person alive shouldn't get an easy escape just for existing up to this point, which was what ended up happening quite often with the original hatch mechanic. There were entire threads on this site discussing people who contributed little to nothing towards the team but would escape frequently via the hatch.
---
Third, this implementation of the Collapse to end the game has *DONE ITS JOB*. Games are concluded in a much more reasonable time frame, with fewer/briefer instances of removing toxic behavior and hostage taking.
---
 All in all I will agree, yes, there are some growing pains with the Collapse. This game is a living work in progress and as long as we and the devs support it, it will continue to do so. It's also important we try to grow with it, in skill, maturity, and communication with our fellows.
---
Gee are those real Docs? I heard only the cool kids wore those.
---
But it‚Äôs duck tape? Dwight has vantages tho
---
Yeah.. I wish it was "any" survivor.
---
Nah, that's just your usual dbd experience
---
Oh, I get you, sometimes it can be tricky. Even if I was playing killer I'd have to laugh if I had that happen to me, I love when people are memeing around in game.
---
Horror is subjective. It‚Äôs definitely scary for some people, judging by the different streamers I watch.
---
Well that escalated quickly...
---
Question, have you ever played the game? Because everyone knows perk tier lists depend on the skills of the person making them, where as I completely disagree, but that‚Äôs because I run differently than you. You are not using bad perks, because there right with you, but for other people its different. Next time, please say, ‚Äúmy‚Äù tier list instead of tier list. Thanks, and good luck in the fog.
---
Thing is AI can mess up a lot, its not reliable enough. If it was hell yeah. But the split screen thing should be scrappable and instead a little square view thing like you have for yt videos or twitch streams when fully minimised. Plus it wouldn't be fun for survivors, it will be for killer players but for survivors you're looking at the equivalent of two killers in a match. It would increase DC rate
---
Did you guys see the PTB dedicated servers tho? üò¨
---
Is there a reason why he's not been around as of late. I also miss ~~Dwight~~ I mean McCote in the streams.
---
Just saying that if youre aiming for a better one, huntress lullaby might be even better than haunted grounds if youre very aggressive when they touch your totems. Also if anyones wondering the counter to this build is either multiple players cleansing at the same time or tapping it multiple times and leaving it until she gives up defending it
---
Tbh I really hope this is legit
---
You mean legacy?
---
Oh fuck really? I actually like that map other than the auras.
---
wait what?
---
P a r a g r a p h s p l e a s e
---
Could also kinda look like the font from Sinister. But maybe that's just me dreaming.
---
right because there have been so many large changes between leaks of other killers, and what we see on test servers and live. especially all those legion and plague changes. there is being optomistic, and then there is being na√Øve.
---
Claudette for sure, but Meg would be more fitting than baby dwight imo
---
The power of Claudette I guess.
---
Hex:Ruin, Barbecue and Chilli, A Nurse's Calling, Sloppy Butcher, Surveillance, Rancor, Hex:Haunted Ground, Hex:Devour Hope, Make Your Choice, Save The Best For Last, Hex:The Third Seal, Deerstalker are all good perks on Spirit.
---
Some say the realm itself is on a constant meth induced sprint through realities
---
I mean, NOED can be easily countered by cleansing 5 dull totems or 1 lit totem after it activates. As a legacy Billy I'm still gonna call you a 4head if you use NOED on Billy. Kinda the same with Ruin Nurse, at least I think that's the sentiment OP is trying to convey.
---
I‚Äôll take the battlepass if it adds actual things to work towards in the game.
---
Yeah really. Well, the patch notes says they did. I have yet to see if it actually worked.

This just goes to show that this community will sook about anything mildly inconvenient in this game.
---
From the latest Developer Update on May 16:
---
Player disconnection is a rampant issue in Dead by Daylight and causes regular frustrations to players. Migrating to Dedicated Servers will give us the opportunity to manage disconnections better. The design for disconnection handling is currently being worked on and we are aiming to launch this feature at the release of dedicated servers. We will share more information on the design itself over the summer. 
---
Until we migrate on dedicated servers, we are left with the way we have been handling disconnections for over a year; by punishing players that are disconnecting more than a definite threshold (% of the games played). In the last few months, the game has been in a state where we had to be more permissive with that threshold because too many players were experiencing crashes and loading issues and we didn‚Äôt want to punish players for issues caused by the game. In the last update, we have fixed most of these issues and our threshold is now back to the initial number.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/63559/developer-update-may-2019/p1?new=1
---
I‚Äôve never had it proc more than once and the description says it is deactivated after going down
---
I don‚Äôt understand why everyone says he needs a rework. He‚Äôd be so much better if these things were implemented: self care doesn‚Äôt wake you up, your soles doesn‚Äôt lower when you put someone to sleep, dream transition time goes from 5 instead of 7 seconds, and during dream transition all action progression is paused.
---
Or maybe survivors should play more respectfully and not be so full of themselves?
---
Oh don't even get me started on Clown. So overrated by the community. What little time he saves in chases is spent reloading the bottles. Freddy&gt;Clown all day.
---
Even without them, hiding from Wraith is ridiculously hard because you can't even see him until he's practically breathing down your neck most of the time. He has the same strength as Freddy or Myers: he gives so little warning on approach Survs have no time to get behind cover.
---
Both chest perks &gt; 90% chance of finding a key in at least one chest. If your main goal is to escape, that helps a lot.
---
No thanks, I'd rather not go against that 300 ping survivor with my chainsaw being triggered without hitting him because of his lag or the same trash killer that keeps having suspicious internet lags at opportune moments making each game frustrating against their potato-net/lagswitch.
---
It was likely on purpose. Survivors are on a time limit
---
lol I cleansed the haunted grounds totem in a match today and a few seconds later two people got insta-downed. I felt like a horrible teammate
---
Also, you can 99% heal yourself and then disarm traps, so you can counter Bloody Oil.
---
next time post leaks in the subreddit dedicated:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksByDaylight/)
---
It's a 50/50 to me. You can't see over obstacles on one hand, but other the other you are a lot closer to the ground thus can more easily spot people staying low. Some hiding spots work better while others don't work at all.
---
He was literally calling him out on it.
---
I have translated the only line specific to Russian localization. The rest is the same. :/
---
OoO against a 0-heartbeat killer? I see you live dangerously.
---
Survivors dodging cause of ping is not bad. Killers 99% of the time dodge cause you are p3 or have a flashlight. Its fucking annoying and should be punished. They are making me wait an hour for 1 game
---
Dude this looks sick , great work and hopefully devs can apply this into the game
---
Infinites. Hillbilly flicks.  Trappers trapping at the foot of hooks. Vacuum vaults.  Old blood webs.  Right after launch, us noobs hid around the outside edge of the map.  Made the game a lot easier for the new killers, who didn't need to put pressure on gens and could leisurely hunt people down.  Nurse being broken on her release (brokenly OP and literally broken on certain maps, especially Haddonfield).   I miss lighting offerings, still have 20 New Moon bouquets on my Meg that I never got to use.
---
I think the Halloween chapter release was the most hyped I've ever been for a chapter.
---
Never heard of this :O do you just 100% yourself before the chase starts?
---
It works well against Wraith. Steath works in a Wraith's favor and eliminating his steath ability basically means he'll never get a free hit.
---
I love unwinding after a long day with some dbd just to play 10+ matches where I‚Äôm either tunneled to death, camped, or my teammates are fucking stupid and don‚Äôt save me off the hook or do gens the whole fucking match. Ahhhhh relaxing üèù
---
I thinnnnk it's ET?
---
I just want him to be a strong killer, who's fun to play as and is viable across all ranks. Is that too much to ask?
---
A good billy fills me with anxiety
---
I know the feeling dude.
---
That's it, you just lost your brain privileges!
---
That's hilarious! I really was!
---
Thats the one thing about playing killer that annoys me. If I 4k I should be keeping addons that I used that game.
---
It blocked the title for me
---
i think it's scary! my adrenaline pumps every time i'm chases and that's addictive!
---
Imagine dying after a minute has passed
---
This comment was brought to you by the *dying before the game starts* gang
---
Because noed is balanced
---
That simple
---
As a killer main, you should be aware that is often the goal as it wastes your time and diminishes your point gain.
---
a shame that there's no punishment for that
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the End Game Collapse not to end when the timer ran out if the Killer picked up a Survivor at the last possible second.
---
So I actually have a story about this bug. I was playing with my 4 man SWF against a killer who was face camping/tunneling (before the gates were powered, so one of my friends with deliverance went down at the end to get the face camp victim out alive and got downed. Then the killer tried to forcefully make the entity kill him by waiting the entire 1 and a half minute left and picking him up and taking him away from the exit gate when he got close. So the timer is approaching its end and its looking like he's not going to be able to escape and the killer picks him up at the last minute and he wiggles out and runs toward the escape because the entity didn't kill him. That last little bit of BM backfired hard on that killer. They DCd before he could reach the escape.
---
Could be decisive, she was obsession
---
Buy most survivors (from my experience) will be over altruistic and swarm the hook, which is a win-win situation for the killer.
---
Wow
---
Why do this people act like this is something new?
---
She was bodyblocking..,
---
They really need to do something to the economy. Either give the killers and survivors way more or just do away with perk levels
---
No shit Sherlock

ALT+TAB between matches considerably increases the chance of DbD freezing. It's not a question just an FYI. I didn't think it warranted it's own Reddit post.
---
O sorry I didn‚Äôt think you were jokingü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
i dodge lobby as survivor if ping bad. i will not play a game over 200 ping, and that's pushing it.
---
Is matchmaking busted currently? We can't seem to get 4 man into the lobby and everytime anyone of us leaves we end up in thesame lobby as the one we just left or at least we end up together in a different lobby (no swf).
---
How the fuck do i properly juke? At this point im only good at using a sprint perk (lithe or balanced landing) to give me enough spacing or going from pallet to pallet in order to prolong the inevitable

---
Wait... is this real? Like, they‚Äôre actually bringing dbd to mobile? Or am I a fucking idiot??
---
Happens a lot when I play Doctor.
---
Apparently it's my fault because I used a op killer that is pay to win which is weird because doctor is in the base game.
---
Rookie Question: When it says that a Perk is Unique to a killer until level 40, does that mean level 40 of the killer with the perk or the killer you want the perk on?
---
i love how meme templates for killers are made from freddy and survivor templates are made from ash
---
I can‚Äôt stress this enough ... take a break. This game can be frustrating no matter which side you play as and the best way to deal with the toxic play is to step away once in a while.
---
Its not as good as Balanced or Dead Hard but its as good as Lithe, Sprint Burst makes any unsafe area safe, gens in the middle of no where become safe to work on since you can just run away to a jungle gym.
---
It‚Äôs still in the horror genre though, people are getting stabbed, axed, chainsawed, and thrown on hooks by horror icons, clowns and hags. Whether it‚Äôs scary or not is subjective, but it still belongs in the horror category.

It‚Äôs because you view your opponents in the wrong way. 
---
Also that your definition of fun, much like my own, is different than what this game (usually) allows for.
---
hold on, i'll do that
---
I usually let them farm and leave, but i'm a survivor main so i know the feeling of having teammates DC and how shitty that is.
---
When i'm a survivor and it happens I have no problem with whether the killer lets us farm and leave or if he keeps playing to win. I understand that sometimes you'd rather finish the game and move on to the next.
---
The only thing I don't like is when a killer plays kind of try hard after 2+ early game DCs. By that I mean doing things like slugging without even knowing where the last survivor is just to prevent the hatch from spawning/opening.
---
Its just like come on man.. aren't we having a miserable enough game with half our team DCing?
---
Yes but that and the asylum are the only ones we could use more.
---
I also secretly hope that like the game map it's size is divided into 2 floors which will make doctor and hag very strong there
---
Ahhh nurse main!
---
Depends. If the people who dc were cunts and I feel like the people who stayed were actually trying, I will let them go.
---
Literally anything that stops survivors from getting skill checks mid transition, it‚Äôs really annoying.
---
Si Senior
---
Great idea, let‚Äòs force people into playing against that fucking 300+ ping
---
Crotus penn asylum ?
---
It's an annoying process and I've never done it personally so you'll have to let google be your friend on that one.

I actually WANT the Battle Pass kind of, because think about it, it‚Äôs free Bloodpoints, free Shards, free Auric Cells, free Cosmetics.  What‚Äôs not to love?
---
refresh the page.
---
I hate picking a killer because the doctor is always staring at me. His eyes terrify me
---
Not sure how I missed that, thanks.
---
Ok, but they would be stunned for a second after their frenzy ends right? I guess that you could do this if you were near a pallet already and can get to it before their stun ends and they catch up
---
I was gonna say the same. Lol
---
Well on We'll Make It, it's written that "cumulative healing bonuses cannot exceed 100%" or do i get that wrong?
---
Damn your a genius
---
not by the sounds of it.  Identity V is basically mobile dbd and it‚Äôs really popular...
---
Also, any proof of this so called game you‚Äôve been developing?
---
I have over 2000 hours though.. and it's a struggle to even motivate myself to even play a single match because I want to use fun build and have fun. But I know I'll end up pissed off playing that way. But I dont want to play the game super competitively because that just doesn't appeal to me in a game like DbD
---
Yeah I would love to see a more zombified version with perhaps the mouth being elongated a lot more and tendrils pulling at the eyes
---
Until you get the character that teaches the perk to lvl 40 and buy the teachable it wont show up on other bloodwebs
---
Okay. We are getting off on the wrong foot. I apologize. I felt belittled. So what I think the issue for me is hardware. On consoles like xbox a lot of xboxs dont run 60fps. I dont. I think my system is 30 fps. A survivor that has a one x with 60fps can literally 360 and spin in a circle and the lower frame rate killer can lose frames and not be able to hit them. Then afterwards they will always make you feel bad about it so I associate 360s with toxicity. I have no issue stopping a lot of people from doing it yet there are some players that you will be lucky to hit. It's not like I havent dealt with it before but you can tell a difference about it sometimes when a player is next to untouchable. They do this the entire match and they almost always run ds and MoM and adrenaline so if you do get a couple of hits they get away anyways.
---
Oh come on, Pharmacy deserves some love. It‚Äòs not that bad.
---
Pretty good planning. You are exactly the kind of player that would not be fun to chase as a killer lol
---
Toonz gets wayy too mad when he plays games.
---
I love him. &lt;3
---
Pretty!
---
If only you could deep fry Reddit comments
---
Why would the killer give a shit?
---
I would argue Clown should be in ‚Äò50/50‚Äô as he ultimately still has to look and throwing bottles is not fool proof on finding a survivor as the AOE can miss the survivor.
---
After playing 6 games in a row with Hag, OoO and a flashlight really helps against her.
---
Yeah, one time I saved someone in the basement. The exit gates were open. I didn‚Äôt have borrowed time so I tanked a hit as we both made a run for it. I got knocked down and taken to the basement. It was my first hook. I could see the person healing themselves and then they just ran out even though the timer was only a little less than halfway.
---
I also find myself with a lack of motivation to play sometimes though and then that single match I get on to play.. I go into the match telling myself I am gonna play to have fun.. but then I get extremely pissed off.. recently I've been playing huntress because Billy makes it too easy, even Iron Billy.. I just shared survivors due to them grouping up and becoming easy slugs.. Which is why I thought maybe mastering a high skill cap killer would make the game fun for me again but it doesn't.. I just get pissed every time I play a huntress.
---
I don‚Äôt believe this...
---
Because survivors still rubberband like crazy even when you are the host? 
---
Ever tried hitting hatchets against someone whose exact position is pretty much unknown to you?
---
There is no way someone could make this in the time from when the dev build was leaked and now
---
Oh boy. Anytime someone makes a killer tier list or a killer/survivor perk tier list the comments are just a shit storm
---
Killing Spree would need to not stack with STBFL or Unrelenting
---
MLGA
---
I‚Äôm ready.
---
He wrote it's Hag seance
---
I go here like I am doing rn
---
Holy shit, formatting my man, formatting
---
I guess this was just his figure of speech. Like some magic seance turning people into something else.
---
My solution is to stay at lower ranks. Not purposefully depip so that I can bully low rank killers. And not at mean at these ranks. I just have some fun and be friendly, as killer or survivor. Sometimes even giving the kill/giving an escape. The best way is to just ignore it, and do what's fun to you, not what the game considers essential. Just doing that will keep you at a mediocre rank. I feel this is acceptable to do if you arent planning on being toxic, which clearly you arent

Look up a video. It helped me a lot
---
BBQC, WWLF.
---
But you don‚Äôt know who killer is till after
---
Playing in low ranks isn‚Äôt fun and takes longer to find a match so I try not to double pip
---
Of course you picked david king to make it look like a fighting game menu as much as possible &gt;.&gt;
---
1500 hour p3 freddy main, I am afraid, like deathly afraid. I just hope that if we yell loud enough they will revert it.
---
actually his add ons made him so fast, she probably didn‚Äôt notice he was placing a trap, and hence jumped down in an attempt to escape the house.  If not for the good play on Panda‚Äôs part, she would have most likely lived.
---
I feel personally attacked as a Claudette main who has more fun playing with the Killer and then dying in the end anyways than anything else

not to uhhhh be silly or nothin but am i the only one that wants a Legacy 2.0? obviously not the same aesthetic, but it'd be nice to have something "extra".

Perfect for if you forget what perks you run on bell ghost :)

I think Plunderers and Sprint Burst should switch tbh. Otherwise great list.
---
Id put dwm in C.
---
Diversion in E.
---
Alert in B.
---
Ds and pharmacy in C.
---
Deliverance in A.
---
Sprint burst in C.
---
