The major potato move: drop the pallet immediately after getting hit, but drop it on the wrong side and panic vault the pallet right back into the killers arms.

---
Thanks for the feedback. I will be making the concept designs soon as well. The killer will be put up here this weekend.
---
Is the stars align correctly four ashes in a game with that add on and they can kill the killer
---
Is it just me or does the Oni have a weird amount of similarities to Shugoki?

Your complaining about how reddit votes works? "Oh no an irrelevant number is going down". Not very important.

POTATO OVERLOAD!
---
Stop! I can only get so potato!
---
Clown's power slightly slows people down for 2 seconds and does nothing else, and you can miss and have to reload eventually so it's not always on-hand. Wraith is not fully invisible. the bell ruins surprise factor, and people can get a great distance away from him while he uncloaks which renders his surprise attack purpose useless. Doctor has no way to utilize his power and hurt people simultaneously, and his power does absolutely nothing if you are good at hitting skill checks. It doesn't cut loops off that well either due to it slowing himself down as well as having a moderate charge time. There's a reason Doctor is next for changes.
---
Shrug
---
Yeah, but doing that after his initial rework is just really pointless given how long the power takes to come back now

I was laughing at Zubat's Oni Launch video where he was hooking people in the basement as he said ”People were talking about the basement in chat earlier, what about it?”

That's probably why. I'm waiting 10-15 at rank 1/2

And you wonder why you get downvoted, you get upset when you're wrong or get downvoted. It's literally a number dude.
---
I would love a perk that stops people posting suggested perks and killers on this forms and more memes and jokes
---
That's why devs should give Killers BP and ranking bonuses for going up against them
---
Just crouch behind the many obstacles there are. Even then, he doesn't have to stalk his way to become a baseline killer. He's still better than Michael on average
---
I’m stuck on this also,

---
Perfect
---
He has an instant down and amazing map pressure. Sure it has to be charged, but he gets it and becomes insanely powerful. You might as well say Hillbilly is trash too.
---
Some people just don’t got it. Point being, no one is questioning their motives or passion but I think a higher skill staff would benefit this game so much more than “love” alone.
---
Ah can you add me or I add you
---
Two keys idea is awful, that makes it tedious to play against her. And you can’t buff her crouch speed to above her normal speed. That would be like ghostface moving as fast as a wraith when in stealth and can’t be brought out and doesn’t have a cooldown.
---
Then don't throw it in the first place against her until you know what her move it. This is why you don't throw them early
---
Adding content broke the game tho
---
RIP anti stealth doctor

Lets be honest here everyone who mains legion just likes the idea of toddlers running around giving everyone borrowed time. Including me.

##The Curator (Jack Torrance)
---
###Primary Weapon: Fire Axe
---
###Power: Redrum
---
The Curator has a **power gauge** that fills up over time. To activate the power: Redrum, **tap the Power button** once the gauge is full. While the power is active:
---
- The Killer's power gauge drains over **20 seconds**.
---
- All Survivors suffer from the **Blindness** and **Oblivious** status effects.
---
- Survivors hit while Redrum is active are afflicted with the **Hindered** status effect.
---
Once the power gauge is fully depleted, it must recharge over **30 seconds**.
---
###Perks
---
**Cabin Fever**
---
Months in isolation have taken a toll on you. You have become obsessed with one Survivor. If your obsession escapes a hook **2** times, or obtains the accumulative repair points equivalent to **3/2.5/2** completed generators, you may kill them by your own hand. Cabin Fever can only be used once per trial.
---
**Spark of Insanity**
---
Unlocks the potential in one's **Aura-reading ability**.
---
Your mind has been consumed by delusions and paranoia. The auras of generators occupied by Survivors change to yellow every **30/25/20 seconds**, but your movement speed is reduced by **5%**.
---
**All Work and No Play**
---
Your presence fills those around you with anxiety. Survivors take **50/75/100%** longer to unhook when inside your terror radius.
---
Whys he getting reworked? If anything it will be for the better because i see him as much as i see clown at red ranks
---
Then you're fine
---
I don’t think so, in fact I think some are brighter (haddonfield in particular) I think it is just the new map. I’ve been having the same issue and I see many others have on this new map.
---
Dude for real!!!
---
Dont have nancy
---
New glitch is what it seems
---
Haha don't cry about it pal
---
This.  I was like "okay why did you pull out your club I wanted to see what the word looked like".  
---
And then I saw the sword for like 5 seconds before he went back into rage mode again.
---
Infectious Fright
---
[removed]
---
They're replacing static field with an AOE static blast that charges up over time. In other words, there is no longer a passive madness build up and survivors only gain madness by being shocked either from Static Blast or Shock Therapy
---
Honestly looks very promising though. Looks like removes 3 gen doc and seems to allow him to use his shock treatment without having to switch meaning he can shock you then bonk you over the head.
---
This would be better if you replaced “shadow realm” with “entity’s stomach”
---
They fixed it a ton but it’s still shit.
---
HELL YES!!
---
But if you let all the survivor s go it’s “gg ez bby killer trash uninstall”
---
So you have to remember to kill all the survivors and  then make sure they all escape
---
But you can’t down them becuase then you’re tunneling 
---
It’s easy, really
---
Ahhh ok. That will be cool maybe doc will get some action
---
Can I sell Legion back?
---
Yeah I guess but no more passive madness build up makes his tracking potentially drop significantly considering that atm he can find anyone just buy entering treatment and after the rework he has to land a shock to see them scream effectively defeating the purpose of them screaming or at the very least reducing its uses
---
That doesn't complete it in one game tho if you just do it on second and third then it dose
---
Happend to me when I was playing hag. Thank god one of the survivors stepped on a trap otherwise i'd be stuck forever
---
What about this is trolling? Surviving? Are we supposed to leave the teammate to die when we can do something to avoid it? Oh, wait, we are called genrushers when we avoid altruism. People can’t really win with that logic mate, every course of action is toxic except when it benefits you.
---
what about his stun. actual elephant screeching
---
I agree, Hag doesn’t set off her own traps so why should trapper?
---
Force of will is just old DS.
---
Apparently canceling mid action while unhooking fixes their camera?
---
Neffcon2
---
Every time I read a thread about Legion no one talks about their ability to scatter survivors and disrupt teamwork and it drives me absolutely up the wall. That being said I got excited for .2 seconds realizing how this perk could buff Legion and then saw it was nerfed. :3
---
Just get a gaming chair bro.
---
I love my pink hair Nea
---
Was straight up bating a killer one time, teabagging and everything. But I was nervous, do to the fact I was a noob at trying to train the killer. So when the killer got to me I was positioned to far on the one side when I dropped the pallet..... it pushed me right in front of the killer, got camped and now live forever in hell..... hahahahaha
---
nurse and spirit reworks were deserved and didn't destroy their respective characters
---
Alright I added you
---
i got the exact same glitch, had to hit a survivor to escape
---
Simultaneously get a 4k and a 0k quite elementary my dear watson.
---
I know but I need something to fill the other doors and the only other candidate was probably piggy
---
How do i get unhooked if I'm falling through oblivion? 
---
But it also shouldnt require something like that to fix this, it should be the top of BHVRs list
---
I know this is just a meme but I really just want a place to rant. 
---
Nurse is still the best killer in the game by far. Her "rework" just made it harder for bad nurses to do good with her. A good nurse is still the best killer hands down.
---
Spirit's changes while nice didn't do a whole lot to address what made her and absolute pain in the ass to deal with. The collision and window vault changes were good changes but she can still dominate easily.
---
Legion changes kept them in the same place as before, F tier. 
---
Docs leaked changes actually seem pretty good based off the screenshots that were leaked. The reverse skill checks will fuck people up realllly bad plus the new "Static Blast" which *seems* to be a terror radius wide shock therapy attack will be 10x better than his current static field which is just an annoyingly slow trickle of madness.
---
Still saying that the change legion was a buff.
---
Also there was no change to Spirit that affects her performance other than the nerf to her addons.
---
Eh i think it'll be better in the long run as more chase potential will be more beneficial then tracking as who cares if you can track they can still probably loop ya easily. Doctor really only had tracking to help him which made him so low tier but if this reworks helps in chases I can see Doc becoming atleast mid tier maybe high depending on how it works
---
Sounds realy cool. I dont see them adding the last one lol thats a bit op for a lil ol survivor. The second one sounds like tap’s perk and the first one is awesome id love that
---
It's his arthritis xD
---
Cabin fever seems strong, especially if the obsessions is a gen jockey they wouldn’t even get to play the game, just hold a button, especially if the killer is aware of what the obsession is doing most of the time.
---
All work no play is a camping perk. I think it would be bad for the game and promote more camping builds.
---
Spark of insanity is very underwhelming. 5% movement speed for a little bit of information every 20 seconds? If survivors are pressuring gems well you would have to choose to go after one survivor while the other 2 are working on the gens you know about. Even the 5% movement speed would make you even slower at reaching the gens the survivors are working on so it would be kind of pointless.
---
The power overall is D tier due to the lack of map pressure and the ability being mildly threatening to survivors. It needs a bit more power, like to scare the survivors when the killer activates it. Otherwise it’s like a terrible ghostface. I was thinking you could try to make all healthy survivors hindered while redrum is active and all injured survivors broken, or slower repair speed?
---
*I'm in this comment and I don't like it.*
---
Totems mate.
---
Yes, avoid red ranks.
---
It encourages stealth IMO. That was the idea behind it. It gives the obsession some extra anxiety XD
---
No One Left Behind and Borrowed Time is a guaranteed safe unhook as long as you aren't dumb and get grabbed.
---
It's kinda funny cause they are removing the flick,  as it's counted as a bug
---
Are you able to invite me cause I can’t find you
---
такова жизнь на восточном фронте
---
Your build is okay but self care is probably the biggest problem. It’s not a bad perk but if I was you I would run bond as this gives you map awareness and can help you find teammates to help you. This will also open up the slot your using for botany knowledge. Spine chill is a great perk but you could swap out kindreds for something like sprint burst, dead hard, adrenaline or decisive strike.
---
I believe oppression or stress should be encouraged on KILLERS
---
fuck fair they are made to kill you
---
I play both and think to improve the hiding and resourcefulness of survivors and making killers scary (not just some bing bong bitch you can loop for 8 gens
---
Cant play with friends at all rn just keep saying nat error
---
Look on YouTube for “Tru3tal3nt Day of Wraith”
---
It’s a 4 hour video of Tru3 using his Ghostface build on Wraith in red ranks and actually doing really well.
---
His Ghostface gameplay is also good (made me a way better Ghosty boi at least).
---
For Pig and Myers I’m not so sure
---
Me, a susie main: I shall endure.
---
Didn't realise you'd seen the whole game like me, as if your fuming because I teabagged for 1 second lool. State of your replies as well haha, you need to get a life mate proper sad that
---
legion needs to be scary
---
Hillbilly doesn't have a power on a timer that can be waited out hiding in a locker
---
no
---
but you just need to put more pressure on survivors! /s
---
Have you watched any of his Ghostface stuff from the last few months or his recent Wraith gameplay?
---
No this is just me... but I like Vigo being a killer more but hey that's just me.
---
If you’re the last survivor you only need 2 gens done correct?
---
So like the perk quick and quiet
---
can never listen to this game with other people around with all the moaning...
---
no,no
---
hes got a point
---
I’ve seen more people saying they have difficulty depipping since the patch, which suggests it’s just psychology.
---
Oh. No it only works with negative status effects (exhaustion, blindness ect.)
---
Yeah i know but you can spend some time to earn blood points and level up the survivors to get those perks as they are good investments. A lot of the perks you have are pre unlocked perks which are usually quite weak but a lot of teachable perks are stronger
---
Remember that’s not even a pallet slide that’s a pallet reset animation
---
I had 4 games yesterday where I found 4 dulls and not the hex ruin. Then we lost with no gens done
---
Yeah, that makes more sense than what I was thinking. But I also think RBT's may be a secondary win condition: when I play as pig (noticed this since last update) I usually get gold/iridescent gatekeeper even in a quick (5-minute) game. It should be mathematically impossible, so maybe RBT/Billy box searching rewards points
---
I mean. You guys have *seen* her hair, right?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6qkd0/kyf_error/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Killers have secrets, so no - You cannot know at all until the first person is executed.
---
Knowing something doesn't make it balanced either.
---
Survs lose to Mori because they got hooked. Killers lose to keys because they took too long to kill.
---
More like what devs nerf vs what actually needs nerfing..
---
Why does this have 2 gold
---
After hooking the entity should block the killer like it does the trapper in the tutorial
---
I main Legion and I’d honestly say people are blowing these changes out of proportion. Yes the STBFL change was a dick move and I don’t feel like it was necessary but overall the speed increases are really nice and shaving like 4 second off of deep wound is barely anything because most Legion players aren’t stupid enough to rely on frenzy to down survivors
---
I’ve been messaging killers after bad basement matches, most of them had no idea. I’m also on console, I think there’s just a really big chunk of the player base that’s more casual and not up to date with the latest bugs. 
---
Sucks regardless, ofc.
---
Maybe. But if only there was a perk that when unhooked you gain immunity from being hit for a while. I dunno, maybe I'd call it Borrowed Time or something.  
---
  
---
Then they could introduce another perk that when you are downed too fast after unhook and picked up, you can hit a skill check and decisively get off the killer's shoulder. Not sure about the name, maybe something like Decisive Strike.  
---
Those are just ideas though.
---
Don’t undersell it’s action speed buff either, it can be a lifesaver at the exit gate.
---
Trick or treat, motherfucker
---
Imagine if you could see other people's offerings
---
Both sides as well
---
"We did it boys, getting mori'd is no more"
---
With the shitty matchmaking I keep getting, I feel no guilt anymore about tunneling or basement hooking
---
most people are at least decent during the actual game. except that one kate i ran up to for healing who left an almost depleted medkit and left. that person's an asshole
---
Fair warning check your perks, for all we know some killer perks or powers are bugged, and if nothing else they have not fixed the Desync Gen Kicking Bug.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6nmdd/new_killer_announced_skill_check/
---
Where as a killer you can get stuck on a Generator, and sometimes you will be warped out of it, but your desynced so you basically see survivors 10 seconds behind where they are and you can hit them there and they will get downed wherever they actually are. So yeah both sides are fucked, as with almost every update, and as i have said before either the QA does not do a pass of old content, or they shit they did have to fix was so plentiful they physically did not have time to fix stuff like this.
---
Granted stuff like this probaly would not happen if their code wasn't a mess but you know that might require houseclean and with how they are going and what they have said they have no intention of taking the Money hit to forgo a chapter to do a cleanup pass.
---
Best Girl cannot be stopped by your pithy chainsaw.
---
Curious - in a hypothetical world where killers were overpowered/over performing - what stats would you need to convince you of that?
---
The perfect way to go to sleep.
---
I think they changed Myers so he activates spine chill even at tier 1
---
I play 50/50 and my killer side says hell no.
---
We already got an extension due to the delayed Halloween update. I don't think we'll get another due to a glitch that isn't game breaking
---
TLDR.
---
In my opinion, I would just take a step back and stop playing competitively. You dont need to kill every survivor every game, or have to escape every game to enjoy the ride. Since the ranking system is bunk anyway, taking is seriously will only ever lead to frustration. Dont play with any expectations and you wont ever be disappointed. I know how you feel, its hard to see it any other way besides negatively sometimes. I'm sure you've had all that before but this is what I did to begin enjoying the game again.
---
His stalking speed is considerably slower than survivor speed
---
That's just your view, everyone else sees you on the hook and when they unhook yes you'll still see yourself falling while they watch you stand there.  
---
I'm also on switch and saw this Ash's body fall through (but he was still on hook) as he was hooked in the basement. So I did what I said above and he knew what he was doing. Was he glitched? Probably. Did it work? Who knows.
---
They already have a hotfix so we just wait till it passes on Switch.
---
it’s bullshit that just standing still and not touching your mouse or keyboard is a viable mindgame strategy
---
I forget if it's an actual feature, but I had survivors who cleansed like mad, pools of corruption literally everywhere (Shelter woods) but a couple of times when someone cleansed all the pools would reset
---
Even my Apple pool
---
On PC he around A to high B? While console he’s probably like a Low B or C. The lack of flick on console ruins him TBH
---
You can still use your eyes against Ghostface, plus because of the reveal noise it sometimes alerts you to him without even knowing you’re looking at him.
---
Ive seen some people saying that, these people are dumb
---
Except the devs said everyone is 21+
---
About survivors
---
All killer's deserve love, we're just misunderstood is all
---
Where can I find these stats?
---
Then they gotta play it safe.
---
So you’re quitting because you guys made the decision to get chainsawed as a group?
---
Fucking lmfao okay
---
All his angry yells when he activates his power are replaced with The Roar
---
Love how the Nancy just stands there like shit well that just happened.
---
Lightweight is pretty immersed if you ask me. You should join her in her natural habitat.
---
Hard to tell what the issue is without footage - make sure you're close, directly behind the unhooker, and that they're in the animation.
---
[Clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZGAFr5REsM). Doc can even do it in Treatment Mode, even though he can't normally attack that way. **Disregard the hatch grab, that was taken out once killers gained the ability to close the hatch.**

---
Zubat is literally one of the best killers in the game. If I gave a horrible gun to the number one trick shooter in the world, they could make it look like a masterpiece. Zubat is good with every killer in the game.
---
i'm not even a high rank but trying a new killer is like a million teabags on your wedding day. especially before you get your perks, but even then you still have to learn a new playstyle while being punished for stepping out of your comfort zone
---
It certainly is which is why I use it I had actually just come out of a hiding spot myself.
---
B maybe A, ill say probably C
---
Should have just jumped back onto the gen.
---
OR more like the killer is being a camping/tunneling butt and me, who has a purple key, is looking for the hatch so me and the other players can escape because the last few engines are crazy close together.  OR again, you are playing SWF and they tell you to go ahead and find the hatch because AGAIN, the killer is camping them and to leave them on the hook (they’ll struggle to give me time to find the hatch)
---
Some of us actually play to have as many people escape as possible and we’re not all toxic.
---
I agree with this 100%. I still main Legion and some games go really well and some don’t that simply how the game works but even the games that ‘go well’ are horribly frustrating to get through because of everything working against Legion. One of the issues you didn’t mention is the fact that you lose 50% of your frenzy bar for a basic attack, it’s ridiculous, like it just feels like another kick to a killer who’s already down
---
Maybe instead of going off he said she said, dont comment unless you know, you prick
---
I was there kicking the shit out of him so yea this really happened.
---
Not scary complicated and weird wall of text these posts get removed all the time for lq content
---
We can keep going at this back and forth if yo like, I’d believe if we do what you’re saying we lose a chunk of people from the central player base and make wait times longer, especially so when trying to find a killer.
---
I 4k with new Legion without any slowdown perks so idk what to tell you.
---
EDIT: I did use Thana now that I think about it, but that was about it.
---
Here you go it’s big doing with one of the archive challenges for basement hooking.

Don't let others control you life experiences. If you love the game, keep playing. The longer things exist, the sooner people adapt to them and re-innovate them. The influx of toxic killers is due to the past influxes of toxic survivors (i.e., body blocking hooks, survivor friends trolling killers, nerfing killers but giving survivors more advantages, poor-sport survivors DC-ing). Just adapt like everyone else and beat them at their own game. Keep playing, hopefully the developers will continue to work on things to make it a more even playing field for both groups!
---
Replace Botany/SC with We’ll Make it/Empathy
---
What if I made it so each effect can only be used once per trial, so if all 4 survivors bring it then one is out of luck.
---
That's not the killers problem though
---
Your just spamming at this point
---
I played against it right as it released before they announced it on twitter so I didn’t realize it was out yet and holy crap I was scared shitless by it.
---
He's an M1 killer plus you can disable his stalking. His stealth can be countered by being more alert after you know its him heck you can hear his suit squeaking. 
---
How about instead of nerfing you get better at the game?
---
You would know wouldn’t you kid?
---
And there’s gonna be bugs twice the amount of the devs fixed so looks like not much have been fixed
---
That’s just you living under a rock.
---
Killers get stuck breaking gens now
---
I’d love to have Legion be more than an early hit sprinter but 2 killers in any format just wouldn’t work. Think about if those two people want to be particularly shitty and they just body block a survivor in a loop, like yes the other survivors could very easily get things done but that one player wouldn’t be able to do literally anything
---
They never specified that
---
Imo Oni's pretty good on console- I played him on my friend's PC when the ptb was live and didn't feel much difference. I have a hard time getting 4ks when I play him but he's fun for sure
---
I'm perfectly fine with the new Legion buff
---
They later said that
---
So what was that bubba suppose to do? Let you guys all rush in and not kill you with that kind of opportunity? Lol. Seems like a personal issue.
---
I feel like people have a right to be pissed if you glitch them out of the game, whether you knew or not.
---
3 perk name is no good. Isn’t balanced at all. If that singularly were tied to a hex that could be cleansed, ok. But otherwise it wastes too much time and devalues hexes and perks like Haunted Grounds, or thrill of the hunt
---
as a killer main, seeing this happen to the last person that played really well breaks my heart &lt;/3
---
I feel like if one happed once per survivor, but it causes exhaustion or something. Also your idea I think would be a little unfair on the survivor side.

Yes
---
This happens to me a lot. I don't even struggle when I'm being taken to the hook after that. I deserve to be sacrificed at that point.
---
Trapped! intensifies
---
Nancy definitely felt bad lol
---
Pig is in ok spot. I think she needs tweaked but I honestly don't know how.
---
Yes.
---
I usually go for Ruin, Thana, Pop/STBFL, and Nurse's/BBQ. That that has been working for me the best, what do you go?
---
This is very cool but you know he’s stuck in lawsuit hell
---
That’s like saying you should intentionally force PC survivors to switch to using a console controller on PC servers became the game is too survivor sided, what you’re asking for is simply unfair as you are admitting that it will put players at a disadvantage against their will but you’re still pushing for it because you think everyone plays the game the same and can ‘handle going against a nurse... at full potential’. What’s more is this could lead to a smurf outbreak on console, imagine seeing a rank 20 nurse playing like a rank one w/ a m&amp;k, still sounds good to you?
---
100% agreed.... its the same for me on Gideon when I'm downstairs.... I think its because of my 4k tv? Since my older tv never had this problem 😥
---
I play on Xbox and I don't have a frame rate issue, I guess ps4 just sucks.
---
Sounds like an all encompassing coming for killers.
---
Killer: Legion (Susie)
---
I run unrelenting, spirit fury, Monitor &amp; abuse and Ruin. It’s a pretty basic M1 build I know but it’s works with how I play Legion and I have fun which I think is way more important.💗💗
---
Well, you tried :/ I think it maybe could have worked if he had followed you
---
I found the stats  https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/106566/stats-november-2019.
---
Ghostface is quite high over all ranks but bad in red ranks because people know how to play against him. So it seems gt gd is the answer indeed 😂
---
I dont think you should look at it as killers as a whole are overperforming but rather look at each killer individually. Gathering average chase times of each killer at rank 1 and comparing it to things such as average completion of the first gen, second gen, third gen etc would give a better understanding. But you understand why these stats dont work right? It doesnt matter what killer you play if the survivors just bomb the hook youll get a 4k, you can get no hooks the entire game and then get a 4 man at the end with noed, you could be dominating the game and then 2 escape with a key. Kills vs escapes on average is not a good figure because there are so many variables the effect it other than the strength of a killer. Looking at optimal play you should be able to see if a killer is too strong because the character’s tools allow it to end chases too quickly. And note i said the character because old nurse could end chases in like 5 seconds but that stat would be muddied by people just trying to learn her but are rank 1 because they main another killer. So yeah id say average chase time vs average gen speed at rank 1 (id rather them have the sample size be the top 10% of players or something akin to that because it would skew the results if for example rank 1 killer consisted of the top 10% of killer players where rank 1 survivor consists of the top 25% of survivor players) while making sure to discard outliers would be a very good start.
---
I would love the butcher and a Roanoke map or a James March and hotel Cortez map.
---
You could double the speed, but if the actual power isn't threatening beyond, "lol now you're injured" it won't matter.
---
That’s rough, but I’d say worth it as the video itself is hilarious, hope you got what you wanted in the end. 👌
---
I got stuck in a gen like that too. I got out by kicking the gen again (when the survivor touched it again)
---
Hell* obligatory edit.
---
I thought this was a blender render until I saw people commenting that it's cosplay 😱 good job

Playing against an in-character Myers is so terrifying. Doing a gen and moving the  camera, only to see him standing 30 meters away is insane.
---
Pig is a woman wearing a pig's head, not a pig-headed woman..
---
Guys, found the rank 20!
---
What’s ur play style?
---
Dang I don't think I have Bamboozle yet, but I'll have to try that out. What add-ons are your preference?
---
You're screwed, my friend. The way this works is, instead of joining you in unison and demanding a better performance, most of the console community is in self-delusion mode trying to convince themselves that framerates don't matter and the human eye can only see 7 fps. So improving performance for you guys will never be high on their list because the enablers turn the blind eye instead of demanding a more playable experience you deserve.
---
Does that mean you have to go hate on someone for it though? Especially since you can't tell if they knew or not
---
im stuck at rank 6 because i cant get better then a safty pip on the hook being camped by a clown
---
A-B around there on all platforms. imo he's great at defending hooks, rushing across the map and slugging, the only disadvantage on console is you can't flick really making him less strong which why people usually seperate PC and Console Oni
---
This is like the 4th one you posted saying the same thing. Post will prolly get removed for oversaturated content.
---
Ive never even thought of that as an obvious tweak to hatch. Add an interaction time, especially if the killer has closed it once already. Im losing count of the times where i get lucky and find hatch before last survivor (because fuck slugging for a 4k) only to have them literally run in my face and open it with key with literally nothing i can do about it but watch.
---
People just keep running into my bear traps. I don’t have any cool powers, all I got is strong legs and bear traps. And people just keep stickin their feet in there. Sometimes I stick em in the grass, but then nobody checks the grass. So I stick em out in broad daylight, and people STILL keep steppin in my bear traps! It’s not like I paint em camo or anything, that’s really expensive. My dad’s estate isn’t worth anything anymore since everyone died. But these random people keep walking onto the property tryna play with my generators, and there’s bear traps to keep animals away, and PEOPLE keep stepping in my BEAR traps. I walk up and smack em right outta the bear traps, I’m tryna help these people, but I’m just so strong. They keep gettin hurt. Maybe on account of the fact they just got stuck in a bear trap, but I’m real nice, so I stick em up on hooks so their feet will be safe from the bear traps, but other people keep pullin em off, AND THEN GUESS WHAT, THEY STEP IN MY FREAKIN BEAR TRAPS AGAIN!
---
They don't have the rights to AoD, Sadly.
---
Chair gaming, just bro
---
This idea is dumb as shit and you know it
---
Honestly it’s like every week someone has to post this meme despite this information.
---
that's worthy of being called a pretty good job
---
So you are saying that it’s the killers thought that you can’t pip whilst being killed.
---
Well if you know someone has spine chill you can moonwalk toward them, usually Spinechill players are a little too reliant on that perk so you tend to get the jump on them when it doesn't light up.
---
like seconds ? cuz i dont like rough estimates from the animation as for example legion, demogorgon and so on have some weirder pick up animations
---
They keep making Legion faster, but in exchange nerf his lethality. FF is practically useless for chases and is better at helping you keep map pressure due to it's increased movement. I honestly don't know what direction the dev team is tring to take with Legion.
---
I think a simple band aid quality of life fix for legion is to make deep wounds similar to Doc's insanity level 3. Survivors can still run, vault and drop pallets from Legion, but can't do gens nor preform unhooks. The amount of times I had a gen completed right in front of me because a surv just powered through the deep wound status is mind boggling
---
for demo?
---
It was probably an accident, would make sense to panic in that situation

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6r1l8/all_the_bugs_ive_noticed_so_far/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I concur. Almost every Ghostface I have played against in the last month has never stalked. Instead they used his power for easy first hits, occasional grabs and for winning tiles. Arguably the best stealth killer in the game since he's not hindered at all when using his stealth, and you can still stalk people who are oblivious or just 99 them for later.
---
I'll keep that in mind, ty for the info
---
Yui: look at this, I can pull pal-
---
Ghostface: No
---
Like the other guy said just go in having fun. I usually end up memeing with the survivors and having a good time. Good luck!
---
If it wasnt for Nea actually being the entity I'd hide you an 11 so you're gonna have to settle for a 10 sorry
---
Actually it's playing the game normally. If you don't want game-breaking bugs during normal gameplay, talk to the devs.
---
Use the Broken addon with duration addon it's a pretty good way of keeping everybody injured
---
Best part of Oni being released is that this has been the longest I've gone without having to deal with Ruin.
---
Cooldown
---
Survivor That comes with him Is..........Tommy Jarvis
---
Where
---
Yeah most of the time survivors clothes (lookin at nea) are the reason I catch them. I want neon yellow trapper.
---
When I’m just walking around patrolling and get head-oned out of a random locker it gives me a heart attack
---
did they fix the blinding basement yet?
---
You make a great point. I don't even think people read everything you said before downvoting you. I really wanna play dbd with my PC and PS4 friends while i play on my Xbox. If friken pubg and fortnight can have it then my favorite none shooter can too!
---
Actually did that on purpose, got a nasty message. Let his friends go just to piss him off more. Dont tea bag me lol.
---
Great but now please fix the issue on Xbox where it says host unreachable after every match and the only way to get into a lobby is by restarting the whole game.
---
I knew my main man Ace wouldn't be the worse one. Anyways I'd have to say Steve, his perks are just pretty bad.
---
5/7/10% per second? That's crazy haha. All perks are really viable, i like them all
---
That is some immersive cosplay right there... well done!
---
Play any killer you damn want to.
---
Oh no my internet points....
---
Standard Steve with the glasses cosmetic, build is: We're Gonna Live Forever, Kindred, Borrowed Time, and Dead Hard. Thinking about swapping out Dead Hard for Mettel of Man now that protection hits have been fixed. I'm sure you have an idea how I play.  
---
Kindred is amazing and has a permanent spot in my build now. I love it to death.
---
Killers: Classic Ghostface with Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy, and Nurse's Calling. Don't "@" me, it's such a reliable and fun build. Freddy I'm levelling to get BBQ, Ruin, Pop, and STBFL.
---
How are killers over performing at all ranks? Are you going off that chart the dev's released a few weeks ago?
---
I hope that makes sense. Like if say the doctor’s average chase time is 1 min and his average time to find a new survivor after chase is 30 sec at rank 1 and at rank 1 the average time for the first 3 gens to pop is 1.5 min then you can see he is a weak killer. But if you look at omega blink nurse her average chase time would be like 5 sec and her average time to get to a new survivor after chase would also probably be 5 sec at rank 1 so clearly shes too strong. By comparing gen time to average chase time and average time to find a new target after chase they can find a baseline of how fast killers should be able to end chases and how much map pressure they should have and balance around that. Of course at rank 1 or the preferred sample size of the top 10% of players from each side and of course discarding outliers.
---
When you can tell a character by their loadout...I think I play DBD too much.
---
Hillbilly moves at 230% though
---
whats the whole lawsuit issue, out of the loop here
---
does he? i never got the hang of him so i guess i just forgot what his sprint was like
---
i take back my concern
---
I believe the same thing is happening to flashlights
---
You need to watch 1984! If you grew up in that era they did a damn good job at making it feel like the 80’s and the story line was awesome! 84 and freak show are now my 2 favorite seasons
---
"Idk why we did it but we're not gonna fix him any time soon."
---
"We can give u another one tho"
---
Happy baby blue cheese day
---
No your right. Spirit was fine. GF is unfun to play against because he’s literally broken. The reveal mechanic does not work as intended.
---
If just feels frustrating when you know you’re expected to look at him to break it out and it simply doesnt work. Thats a different feeling to going against a killer that’s strong.
---
Really? I will have to go and investigate, but I brought in a green med kit with Gel dressing and gauze roll so I would have 44 charges which comes out to 2.75 heals and it was used up on the first heal before I was even healed all the way.
---
Didn't Peanits also say
---
&gt;"Please keep in mind that numbers are not everything; there are a whole bunch of factors that could influence these numbers."
---
So just because a Killer might have a high kill rate or low kill rate doesn't mean they're over/underpreforming and a myriad of factors can determine if they are or not.
---
But when the killer decides to drop you at around 75% doesn't it just drop you on your feet like an escape?
---
Nobody finds Nurse fun to play anymore
---
You didn't really help your case with that one.
---
i play plague spirit or freddy
---
3k then close the hatch
---
the last survivor will try desperately to open the gate and you grab
---
Bet his ass ate a DS as well lol.
---
The real thing is how different he looked back then
---
Oh, the games in which he used purple and  red add-ons on Wraith and called him viable? Imagine using the best add-ons for a killer and calling them viable. All these try-hards should play without add-ons. Maybe one day, bhvr will remove add-ons for both killers and survivors and make the game more fair.
---
Thanks homie. See ya at the meeting ;)
---
Didn't need to, anyone with common sense understands that lol
---
Under appreciated skin is clown santa
---
Mainly cause clown sucks :(
---
Clown mains rise up
---
You could report them for exploiting because it is an exploit
---
&lt;3!!
---
I just forget it's bugged, me see basement chance, me take
---
I feels really bad for Legion. They get the coolest looking cosmetics, but no one is ever going to wear them cause their on Legion
---
Then you accept the fact that sometimes, in a game with crazed and often supernatural killers, you just fucking die without much of a chance and sacrifice yourself for the rest of the team.
---
Spine chill up? 👍
---
Inside terror radius? 👎
---
Its gen ti-OH SWEET FUCK HES RIGHT HERE
---
Yeah, time does that to you unfortunately.
---
Playing against pre-rework Freddy and the game getting to this point was hell.
---
Your context confused me way more than the original statement
---
say a killer does something fair to get a fair hook (or dedicated survers)
---
then your first hook
---
america es-plain
---
Sure but if another Survivor is also within 32m the timer instead drains twice as fast.
---
Killer does his job. 
---
Well guys I'm retiring from a video game, please allow me to give all of you notice even though we don't know each other at all.

He moves at like 40% speed when stalking what are you talking about he moves at the same speed as survivors.

Mending was already fast and sloppy is trash are not valid points at all. Yeah mending was fast doesn't mean just cause it is doesn't mean it's ok to make it even faster. Also sloppy is good to a lot of people especially legions who used it to further their stalling build. And now legion cannot gain stacks on stbfl super fast like before
---
What you get you toxic gen rusher
---
Thank Tru for that, his GF build is insane
---
May be an idiot, but I didn't find anything on it.
---
Balanced gameplay
---
I have had the same issue. Happened to me twice and now I am in a game. Also please add me whoever wants too. My gamertag is tuffbacon, I need people to play with lol
---
Don't forget you'd essentially never go under 7 stacks if it took two basic attacks on the obsession to lose one.
---
So you get a free 40% Successful Attack Cooldown  for the rest of the match after the first hook.
---
That's the one! Fantastic video, and really shows why camping and tunneling can be a legitimate strategy.
---
It's a very accurate stereotype. Every single Bill ive chased only had a like 20 second chase. I think it's because Bill attracts new players as he comes from a popular franchise and is well liked
---
Big disagree, rewatch the original Evil Dead and you’ll see Ash is truly just the luckiest mother lover alive. Yes he’s a badass, but we’re talking about Entity powered killing machines.
---
Thats the definition of sweaty, "all for the win". they add nothing to gameplay. Ruin and Sloppy changes nothting. Unlike PWF and Dark Devotion, that shakes the game up.
---
This is definitely an edited picture. Nice try tho
---
That's borrowed time not adrenaline. Lol
---
It's perfectly fine that it's shorter because it doesn't matter, in can last one second as far as I care. Lastly, no, sloppy is only used on stealth killers and people who don't realize how much of a shit perk it is.
---
Something tells me Freddy Krueger doesn't care about the letter of the law
---
Was talking about the teachable
---
Wraith
---
Not only can you Hard counter Ghostface’s stealth by using those nifty vision balls resting in your face, you can make him activating his insta-down extremely difficult if you know how to break LoS, which isn’t really hard at all unless you’re frequently getting caught out in the middle of an open field doing fuck all, in which case you have yourself to blame
---
“im a dickhead and im proud”
---
I do agree there would be a lot to go through its just annoying because the perk completely overrides the offering amd youvwould still drop it I just want it back after I die
---
Most exclusives were given out to everyone.
---
Listen a nurse at red ranks told me that so it has to be true!
---
noob3's real face revealed
---
Look at the perk he actually bought dude.
---
Correction, didnt see the teachable on bottom. Was looking at the borrowed on the left.
---
No, but i just had three consecutive killer matches freeze my pc more than halfway through. Fucking garbage.
---
Nope, when a match ended. I left the endgame lobby and then it said the party has dispanded (despite the fact that I am solo queue). So in the end, I got a screenshot of a bug.
---
Preschool is a shit map in almost all its variations (I think 1 might be okay, but I'm not sure since multiple god loops are garunteed). Plague gets heavy hurt on them (huntress too) especially since dedicated servers hate projectiles and give survivors hit priority instead of killer. Pig/Ghostface are the only ones that don't get fucked by LoS because they can crouch, but in general good survivors on Badham is an instant loss.
---
Ew
---
Looking at my inventory now, all of my survs have hella ultra rare cosmetics. Some have 2 as well. Was this announced in the newest patch? I didn't read anything about it.
---
Really? No way, everyone knows that you can't see a wraith
---
You're treating your opinions as facts. Are you serious? The shorter the mend the more useless it is. Oh yes let's make it one second now what's the difference from just hitting them normally?
---
Yeah, happened to a streamer I watched yesterday. He was stuck, but for the survivors he seemed to still be moving. He randomly got into chases and got blinded lol.
---
Idk but it’s been news for about 2 weeks
---
Ahhh so survivor bloodweb but you see the killer in the side. Looks like a bad edit tbh.
---
“Content - Added cosmetics to player inventory (Incl. past convention exclusives, Bill’s Ugly Sweater, Frosty Eyes for The Oni &amp; The Plague, and a new Universal Winter Holiday Charm).”
---
Quoted from Features &amp; Content part of the page.
---
to be fair, considering legion is just a bunch of delinquents who Went Too Far that one time, the fact that they're mostly just fast and annoying is kind of fitting.
---
more seriously, i agree with all of this. people keep pointing out the buffs to legion's speed but their actual *power* is being made more and more superfluous. i said in another post, the reason nobody is really noticing the deep wound nerf is because it was already practically useless. the survivor response is the same: finish what you're doing and/or run off to mend because legion can't track you in frenzy anyway. i think they're supposed to feel like some *urge* overtakes them, (esp. since that seems to be what happened with frank,) but frenzy doesn't feel *frenzied*
---
Ahhh so survivor bloodweb but you see your killer. It looks like a bad edit.
---
I run her without add ons in the red ranks and have a pretty damn high win rate. I don't think it's as simple as "don't cleanse" as much as it is "cleanse smartly."
---
Some people just get stubborn and won't cleanse, and then go down in chases in 2 seconds flat, where if they cleansed at the fountain half a map from the gens, I probably wouldn't be bothered to go get corrupt anyway.
---
Sorry, I'm not used to edit my instagram pictures
---
Smh, survivors not even doing chests, play the objective.
---
dude it's geodude from pokemon
---
I have been the epic r/woshed. Crucify me quickly and painlessly.
---
At that point the survivor already lost, it's not supposed to be fair.
---
I mean...if you’ve had the game since beta but you’ve only logged 340 hours, you obviously weren’t that big a fan of the game anyways
---
The game right now... lmao
---
You need to come in at the window completely straightfoward. Like to get a good fast vault from the side you need to rotate the opposite way of the window and then turn into the window. If that makes any sense. Like a semi half circle into the window from the side.
---
That man just got Vibe Checked so hard
---
If every pool is corrupt they will all refresh and you will gain the corrupt buff wherever you are. If allies have cleansed 5 times (more than plague has gone corrupt) then the next cleanse is a huge buff to survivors as she basically loses 5 uses of it.
---
With a chainmail hand, awe yiss
---
I know, I understand why. But don't blame ya, but it is kinda neat?
---
Yes because having all survivors communicating constantly is of course worse than if they didn’t my bad, but no on a serious note only like 1 percent of 4 mans is one of those “sweaty”  others are just trying to have a good time and don’t care about winning
---
But the Chili does something. It increases your acceleration to top speed. It’s a really good tool if you pair it with addons that would increase your top speed like knife scratches or the beast’s marks.
---
Ahhh, I thought it might be. It just rarely happens so I wasn't sure if it was a bug or something
---
Ghostfaces being toxic. I swear him having the ability to teabag just attracts all the toxic players towards him, never encountered a nice Ghostface. Legions players being very loyal to them and very very hopeful Legion one day will actually be good.    Pig players just basically worship Amanda nothing else really.    For survivors I'd have to say Aces are mostly sweatlords and toxic asshats.   Nancy's are very good at the game usually and solid team players and if they have them prestiged they will be very helpful.   Dwight's are either babies or just absolute gods at the game and will bully you. Last stereotype I can think of are Bills just being very bad at everything but are so adorable seeing them as they're noobs usually
---
that still doesn't explain one hit down tho
---
No I'm treating my experience of playing the game as fact. Why am I using Sloppy when it barely slows down healing unless I'm looking for survivors using nurses? Does STBFL actually help the killer or is it just used to replace Legion's trash power? People don't want to adapt their playstyle to take of advantage of Legion's increased speed so now their whining about it and it's annoying.
---
The devs actually did an analysis and confirmed that Acceleration is not affected, or does nothing at all. The movement speed you're experiencing is solely from the Knife Scratches and Beast's Marks.
---
Rise up against the system Ghostface mains. Delete all Michaels. Hail Jed Olsen. Delete all Michaels.

You can't catch them before anyways so what's the difference? STBFL is nice but it wasn't so good that you can suddenly get good survivors when you couldn't before.
---
And exhaustion status for 45 seconds.
---
Idk but they’re soft bans so what’s the hurry?
---
340 hours since beta sounds like a casual gamer. Doesn’t sound like your quitting DbD, just don’t feel like playing it right now? 340 hours ain’t much to lose.
---
Yeah so adding hemorrhage with sloppy is bad bit blood echos even though it's the same effect but requires more work isn't ?
---
Camping, though you dislike it, still is a strategy. Viable? No, you depip 100%. But it still is viable. You shouldn't get banned or timed out for it. You already lose pips. Also, how are you going to make that work in the end game to killers who secure their last kill? It's just not something that will exist. Also disconnecting fucks everyone over, yes, even the killer. Its unfun for both sides too. Someone that gets camped gives 2 more mins to the survivors to do gens and escape.
---
Not up to date with the devs ? Well, they gave out PC exclusive cosmetics to everybody on all platforms, since console never had the chance to get them. It was to prevent people from getting scammed as well.
---
That's absolutely terrifying
---
STBFL really helps save time in a chase. It made him better in chases and less reliant on his ability.
---
It's good on any m1 killer, it was exceptional on him.
---
Yeah that’s every match for me on console, can’t get past rank 8 cus of it
---
Yeah I scrolled through a hit and checked the pinned messages, but I really don't see anything on this. No need to be rude tho.

This happened to me today. The killer actually picked me up and I didn't bother wiggling free, being the last survivor. It didn't take long to realize he was looking for the hatch, carrying me on his shoulder. After dropping me at the hatch I tried to thank him by spinning in a circle before jumping. 😁
---
For console only Switch since it uses dedicated servers
---
Shut the fuck up
---
it's a dead format though
---
Hey with Blood Echoes and the functioning Pins, I basically have free sloppy butcher and one hit downs.
---
Literally no one's mad though lol. They usually go "Hey, he's using my build. Cool!" And move on. And by my build they mean the build they use most often and not the build they have ownership over.
---
I play for the aesthetic and the aesthetic only.
---
Not on Xbox! :)
---
And you thought it would take until next year
---
The balanced landing nerf was 100% deserved. An EXHAUSTION perk with a passive that works when exhausted was just dumb and shouldn't of been a thing anyway
---
Im saying ppl have been saying this since the update
---
And then it was made into a comic book that also got a sequel called Freddy vs Jason vs Ash and the Nightmare Warriors.
---
Lol WoW no....like.... No
---
If you know someone is fallowing you on your way to hook someone and you spend time looking for them, or loop someone near the hook, or late game altruistic swarms, that’s infinite hook time, that will never happen.
---
Ever
---
Herrmorrage is trash, the only benefit to sloppy is mangled and the benefit to Echos is exhaustion.
---
At least put a headphone warning before putting a screaming gnome for us to hear
---
No need to be harsh
---
D:
---
These perks. No pls.
---
It also means Borrowed Time and Stiptic got buffed
---
I hope to see you in a game once, I'm a ghostface main and I'm kind, even to the people that aren't kind &lt;3
---
Lol speak for yourself... 
---
Im rank 1 as ghost face on xbox.   Just because your only good with 3 killers doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
\*gets gen rushed\*

;-; Is there still....hope?

Aw fuck I thought they fixed this damn bug ages ago! We gonna get Bond killers again
---
Those aren't really stereotypes
---
You bloodpoints for tutorial?
---
im luigi
---
That doesn't sound...good. The survivor has an initial speed boost combined with your 4 second stun coming out of frenzy to allow them to easily get to a loop, at that point you're using it as a glorified easy 1st hit which is essentially what any killer is capable of. Using the power just for that isn't exactly worth it.
---
At this rate, the powers only use is to keep people injured, traversal, and give you somewhat decent tracking info so I still am not buying that they're the weakest killer. Though Frenzy is still definitely lacking in the lethality department, since any other killer is capable of downing or using their power to aide in downing a survivor, Feral Frenzy is physically incapable of doing that with the exception of using Frank's mixtape which is an ass add-on.
---
Just like in the game I didn’t notice the killer right behind him.
---
Yep, they fix one thing and break another. Devour Hope straight up doesn't work randomly after 3 stacks.
---
Its mentioned best by int3r4ct is his video Entity Education: The Cannibal. He also breaks down the add-ons in a similar way that I did. My list is just simplified
---
what would you change about dome of them
---
The dark side of the force is a Pathway to abilities many consider to be unnatural.
---
Dc’s count as kill douche dick
---
And if they dont find it within a minute, they start disconnecting on the first down.
---
Billy is literally one of the best killers on console. Nurse is still viable just insanely harder to play. just because you're shit with a few killers doesn't mean everyone else is.
---
If used correctly, you can minimize the negative of the stun. If you go into the stun while body blocking a window, or maneuvering yourself around a survive the right way, you can steer them into dead zones and take advantage of that. I've done it plenty of times tonight. Also, being able to keep up with or get in front of people using stuff like sprint burst and balanced landing because of FF speed is seriously underrated. I'll take a 4 second mini stun over having to completely end a chase due to sprint burst or balance landing.
---
Hex:Ruin is your hope
---
I've been having this issue. For survivor it gives me an error message and for killer I load into a livvy where I'm all alone
---
Take me to the top with you!
---
As a killer main it shouldn’t remotely be that unfair. They should still have some degree of a chance to escape after the hatch closes but being able to sit in one location and have direct line of sight of both exits just by turning is pretty bullshit.
---
You’re completely missing the point, but you do you
---
"BuT tHe OtHeR sIdE aBuSeD bUgS bEfOrE"
---
I'm never gonna leave the edginess. NEVER
---
Goals bro
---
I would dc
---
So I have to down and hook someone and hope the people I left injured before haven't healed or aren't in the process of healing and also have an exhaustion perk just so they can be exhausted for 45 seconds and then I have to find and also down them before those 45 seconds are up or they just get the perk back anyways and again that's if they even have it.
---
But applying mangled and hemorrhage is the bad one even though it always works or at least did before the nerf, extremely well with thano and frenzy making longer healing that helped legion actually apply pressure
---
Jump into a locker, Franklin's doesn't proc off of grabs.
---
My god you're a genius. Thank you
---
The small book is jam packed with size 4 font
---
Megs are stupid. That's why we call them megheads.
---
As soon as I read Comic Book I immediately thought "Nightmare Warriors" thanks for reminding me
---
I mean it’s still a fact that console has piss poor frames and they haven’t even bothered to fix that and now for oni we can’t flick his bonk because of the sensitivity limit

Or you could actually watch his shit before commenting so you’d know he got the exact same results using yellow add-ons. But that doesn’t fit your narrative does it?

I apologize, I am an ex. :( I regret my decisions, but even yellow rank survivors can easy escape me as Legion.

Hex: Unskilled
---
A Hex rooting itself on rank 10s. The slow reactions of new survivors ignites the entities hunger. When a Survivor misses a skill check, they are instantly put into the dying state.
---
*"fuck you I finally got buffed" -Legion*
---
People that play Ghostface are fucking dicks.
---
Bill's are idiots that assume I'm going to tunnel.
---
Tapp's are an endangered species so they are hard to find.
---
I disagree immensely with saying Oni and The Nurse are completely unplayable on console, sure with Oni you're unable flick as good as PC players which does hinder him A bit and he is still viable though.  for Nurse sure Frame rate may hurt Nurse but most of the time atleast for me she runs completely smooth and I'm still able to do what most PC nurses can do it just takes practice.   Also for your bit saying only Freddy, Spirit and Billy are the only viable killers on console is completely wrong.
---
   Hag can do wonders if played by a knowledgeable player, Demogorgon does great also if played by someone that knows how the character works.

Still waiting on shrine....

(Quick note: I only have original perks, all free PC killers perks, Spirit, Legion perks and Barbecue and Chili unlocked. My build is usually the books and ruler and occasionally the iridescent button, the only useful addons. I find Discordance, Sloppy Butcher, and Barbecue and Chili to be excellent perks, but are there any I can use from this?)
---
I think exhaustion on hit is so damn powerful. Removes so many good perks from the chase
---
You literally have the best name
---
Laughs in doctor main
---
I went against a killer who didn't know about the bug. He really wanted the 4k and I told him in the post game chat that there was a bug. He was really nice about it.
---
STBFL is my favorite perk (even though I don't use it anymore) and even I don't agree with this.
---
Sloppy Butcher was fixed on Legion, now you actually have to default hit. Use BBQ, Nurses Calling, Discordance and any perk you want
---
Playing as Oni I had issues on multiple games where I would kick a gen and then get stuck in place until I could hit a survivor, and then I teleported across the map. Another where I checked a locker and got stuck until I checked it again.
---
I hope this bug got fixed too.
---
Ive never ever seen an escape in EG by the last survivor (survivor rank 6)
---
bills are confused grandpas
---
nurse is trash, so just avoid her. the others are fine enough imo

Sloppy Butcher doesn't apply to the power?! That means I will quit using the power and play as the most generic M1 mindgaming killer...
---
Hey remember that time it took an entire year to get a skin for Susie only for it to just be a recolor?
---
I have a small orgasm when I see a team with 4 flashlights. Usually that means they are all going for saves instead of doing gens.
---
No i dont think suicide on hook should be the same. Imo it's the most fair way to leave a game. You aren't farming, sandbagging, or 100% screwing your team if the killer still has to walk to the hook. your team and the killer still gets some amount if points for playing and all is fair.
---
Ypu should find how to recreate the bugs and then make a post with proof
---
Love this one!
---
Did you get warped across the map lmao
---
Deformef
---
Big brain is using it with Remember Me.
---
With never work cause it can be abused by swfs and killers by camping a first down. Also you wouldn't be able to tell who did it on purpose or not. Terrible idea.
---
so youre saying that facecamping is a legit tactic? ok dude
---
Ok fine, maybe not sweaty but something close?
---
Pharmacy and Wake Up are infinitely more useful than any of Ace's perks lol, especially with the buff to green medkits and I'm not just saying this memeingly.
---
I played a bunch of Wraith a few minutes ago and didn't have the cloaking problem. 
---
Might have the no haste one tho. 
---
Also on PC.
---
Took them 2 years to rework Freddy, I’m predicting 2024
---
Give em the ole league of legends approach. Don’t worry, they’ll rework him into something op and start the cycle all over again one of these days
---
This is great!
---
WOAOOAAAGG
---
Technically you unlocked it for all survivors on nurse.
---
I feel like if a survivor doesn’t want to play against a certain killer or certain map, no matter what they will find some way to get out of it quickly. Right now that is DCing, after the penalty it might be killing themself, but if BHVR punishes that too, people might just go afk and not play at all. Idk that’s just my two cents.
---
how does time play = how big of a fan i am or what rights i have to complain about stuff that has been there since beta?
---
It might be map dependent. I got hooked on Ormond and had white and yellow.
---
Hag is the least chonk &gt;:(
---
I can’t edit the caption or I would bro sorry
---
what else yall want people to do? it was either let people get facecamped or try to save them.  
---
all i know is that i aint having fun being facecamped so why should i not try to help others avoid it?
---
Ka-Stab
---
Definitely haven't seen this yet and I both play and play against Wraith. Can you post your perks, add-ons and cosmetics you were using when you experienced this? Hopefully as a community we can figure out what the hell causes this.
---
Honestly, yeah
---
This hasn't come out yet has it? I've been playing on 3.4.0 for the past 4 hours
---
well i am a big fan of dbd so maybe i did wanna give my 2 weeks notice?
---
Ghost boi is always right choice
---
When i do it, I do it so I have time to close hatch before the last survivor dies. I need my points.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V23pf7YpWEg&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Frame rate is crap because of my laptop, but yeah.
---
The ability literally just does not activate.
---
They made the green medkit less durable, and Ace In the Hole was superior anyway since it could grant insta-heals or better items in general
---
And then you get the sadists who instead want to drag out the game so you go to open the gate and they instead down you and make you wait until the EGC timer ends while downed
---
bruh
---
Thats a funny post op.
---
He's not, if you tap the attack button from grab range (which is pretty big) it'll zoom yoou forward into perspective
---
Yeah, I wish I could not play as other killers and survivors,  but you probably will have to use a splinter for killer, and I don't know for survivor.
---
Yo i believe you alright i didn’t ask for a link
---
Farmerjohn is bae
---
Yeah............. the anticipation is worse than the actual pain , it is quite similar to waiting for exam results. Even if u get bad grades it doesn’t hurt a lot but the waiting period takes a toll on the heart.............
---
Yeah, it is.
---
It sucks for the person on the hook. And it should be easily countered by *smart* survivors.
---
But if the killer sets up bait, and the survivors are dumb enough to take the bait, and the killer gets rewarded because of it -- Then it worked as a tactic.
---
&gt; If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid.
---
The killer's objective is to kill you. If he killed you, he completed his objective.
---
Just because **YOU** don't like it doesn't make any difference.
---
It pretty much is the only strat lol. Once you’re caught you’re either gonna be downed anyway or run for the rest of the EGC. Might as well take your chance that the killer will let you go
---
killer earned minimum bp since all he did face facecamp, is that what people call doing their job in dbd?  
---
 noone had fun since match only lasted a few minutes that left a bad taste for matches far after.

i wanted to vent about it and say goodbye to this reddit.

---
Lore friendly design, innovative, interesting power, i like it, so its in PTB already?  
---
im also curious as to what the skill checks shareables are.
---
If you’ve had this game since the beta, and you’ve only logged 340 hours, that obviously means you play it very seldomly, meaning your experience is quite limited. You can’t form and informed and accurate opinion with limited experience, can you?
---
as ive said already, facecamping n being generally toxic aint really a way of winning, its just plain bad.  
---
and ive acknowledged that its in game per design and thats why im leaving.
---
You literally said “post them for proof” but now your saying I didn’t ask for a link
---
Bitch, how dare you down me and walk away because they hook dived. Don't chase my teammate, let me DS you. I don't care if my team can pick me up safely while you're chasing someone else. Come get stabbed dick. 
---
Very next game after they take off DS. 
---
Bitch, how dare you pick me up after you downed me because I was hook dived. If you put me back on that hook I'm leaving. Ok that's it, enjoy less points. You suck literal toes. Now I'm gonna grab a flash light and be a clicky clicky exit gate bagger. 
---
The game after they bully a killer, and talk a bunch of toxic shit. 
---
Bitch, how dare you outplay me. That character is just strong, or the build you're running is bullshit. Fuck you for not letting me shit on you. That's it, I'M gonna play killer, and I'm gonna play the way you're supposed to play. 
---
The next game after they get gen rushed and lose without hooking 1 person. 
---
Bitches, how dare you little shits escape and T bag me. Toxic survivors are toxic. I'm gonna report all of you. You know what, I have 30 Moris saved up. I'm gonna go out of my way to ruin everyone's games, by camping and tunneling everyone, and then using my ebony on them all. 
---
The last game they play as killer, where the survivors each DSed them, and then escape. 
---
That's it. DS is overpowered. I'm gonna okay survivor, and put it on my character, so I can piss off every killer I play. 
---
The cycle of toxic dbd players.
---
I like the Big Texan more
---
Laughs in console for once
---
I work alot but i could play with you on some days!
---
how about not facecamping so people can actualyl try having a decent game?
---
I was playing hag and trotting around placing traps in random areas.  I came around a corner and a Dwight ran full speed into me. We both turned and ran away from each other.

Oni is rough also because as hes about to release his charge attack the game lags super hard and often causes you to miss even though when you released it you were directly on their back
---
Mate, i said find how to recreate it. Then post it to proove the bug. Not prove to me that it actually happened to you.
---
Spirit
---
Or you know, downvoted by all the people who didn't abuse bugs but think this is stupid.
---
You know, like a lot of us.
---
Not sure why, he is more or less a worse Billy except for the few situations where hitting multiple people with your chainsaw is relevant.
---
This actually gives me build ideas. I didn't realize nemesis switching obsession could he useful, but it might be
---
Oni is really fun to play too
---
That's what I'm wondering. That or a crash?
---
Honestly tho it’s a shitty thing no matter which side is doing it
---
So was he patrolling or facecamping? Make up your mind.
---
Mate well maybe you should emphasize that, and there is no reason to say that if you didn’t want to see it yourself
---
Fuck that. Fuck the DC like thattt. I get having a string of shitty luck or a night of bad matches but man it is SUCH a buzz kill. I play killer and survivor and either way it just sucks. Even in my worst matches I force myself to just stick it out. Camped, tunneled, blocked, teabagged, clicky flashlights, whatever the annoyance or soul crushing behavior is I just can't bring myself to DC. 
---
But if it is horrible I will die in struggle phase. Or just sit and let the SWF do their gens and their happy little tea bag dance as I stare out the gates and they do their exit gate ritual. Am I a martyr? Does that make sense? I don't know.
---
I just know that I hate the feeli g of seeing somebody DC against me. Like way fun.
---
This reminds me of the totem &gt; gens meme from a while ago, I leaned in HARD to that notion of Ace. But yeah, both are great I just kinda forgot about detective’s and plus small game is a basic perk
---
He's one of the six killers that have *probably* had sex.
---
If so, then the other 12 killers are, literally, virgins.
---
I'd Say go Tapp, Yui, Ash then Kate
---
 Those perks are fine, if you want to talk about op perks we can talk about the "BrOkEn" perks the purple ranks was running. Just because I'm running good perks doesn't mean i can't complain about matchmaking

Flashlights are used to blind the killer. This can be done by flashing it in their eyes. People do it for saves (if you flash the killer in the face correctly while he’s carrying a survivor, the survivor will break free from his grasp) or like once they pallet stun the killer, they tend to blind the killer for a few more spare seconds to run. It’s also used as a toxic tool and a shit meme. The key is really useful too but you don’t see much gameplay from it
---
I wasn't referring to you necessarily, I see posts all the time on the forums about "OMG it's the worst perk ever why would anybody ever use it?" when everybody was absolutely in love with it just months ago. But now all of a sudden there are multiple posts a week flaming anybody who uses it and calling them an idiot.
---
Or when you can just stand on one and see the other, at that point why doesn't the entity just kill them?
---
Where I'm from a "mother in law" is a type of house that's basically 2 separate houses in one. Like take a 3 story house, cut the basement off of the rest of the house and turn it into a mini-apartment with its own access to the outside without having to go through the rest of the house and that's a mother in law.
---
Tbh Bruce has aged incredibly well. Better than 99% of Actors if you ask me.
---
She really can’t do much in a chase. She’s gonna throw up on you and leave to get other survivors infected or chase you while she’s trying to break you. Her power is strong but it relies on survivors cleansing. She’s almost impossible to mind game at most pallets. 
---
I’d say the reason she isn’t picked a whole lot is because she lacks the ability to end chases quickly.
---
Not gonna lie, that sounds like Wraith except now you know everyone else is on a gen instead of assuming everyone else is on a gen.
---
Hm.. most people like ghostface but i suggest watching a video on the killer before you buy them when you come to your conclusion (tho personal enjoy the pig and spirit)

13 Hot Tips to Transform Your Dwight Into a Dick Guillotine
---
Definitely, i could have gotten red ranks
---
How to counter Ghostface 101:
---
Stalk-face: Be extra alert on gens, expect him to be around corners with LOS of your run-up to the unhook. If he marks you from far, loop conservatively like normal. If he 99%'s you, take extra care to break him out of stealth and force him to hit you (i.e. while carrying a survivor, after you revealed him, etc) to clear your stalk progress. Honestly, this playstyle isn't even that good once you start taking hits to clear your stalk progress and you should be able to waste tons of his time just on the stalk process alone before he has to resign to a normal 2-hit chase.

Smack-face: By far the biggest counter to him is good game sense. He relies on you not knowing where he is, so use every single piece of information available to know when he is more likely to pop around a corner. He smacks someone, that probably means he's leaving them and coming to you in about 20 seconds. Do your gen for 15 seconds, then go pop your head around the corner to make sure he's not showing up for a free hit. Play more proactively in finding him, rather than reactively running away after he hits you. Heal in open spaces so he can't catch you off guard with Nurse's. 
---
Even more valuable: help your team by revealing him when he tries to start a new power cycle. The no-stalk Ghostface cycle is typically 1) free hit on survivor 2) break as many pallets as possible until your power comes back 3) dissapear and go find someone else. A massive way to counter him is the second you see him decide to leave you, go follow him (while still maintaining enough space to get to a loop) and break him out of stealth before he can get to your teammates. Now he has to commit even more time to chasing you and less time to pressuring your whole team.
---
Ghostface is a strong killer, but that doesn't mean he's unbalanced. If you find Ghostface first, he's nothing but an m1 killer with a little extra spice. He finds you first, he gets his free hit (and if you're injured, a free down). You as a survivor have the tools to completely shut him down *if you can figure out what he is doing*. He as a killer has the tools to punish survivors *if they play too predictable*. It's not a battle of who can loop better. It's a battle of who can find the other one first and execute a better gameplan.
---
Blink the killer to get flashlight saves with your flashlight. On super rare occasions, you can get it if you solo que but if you’re in a SWF it’s much easier. Hatch spawns are something you have to learn by heart depending on the map. Some common spawn locations of hatch spawns are the basement of the school in Badham, the hills in Macmillan, ormond, auto haven, asylum, in the swamp it usually spawns at a loop, shack, or the secondary building, in Gideon meat plant it only spawns downstairs and has usually spawned near one of the dark, icy rooms with a bunch of dead pigs.
---
yeah they did today I think
---
Ask any console player who has played bdb for a long enough time and they will tell you that the framerate is ass and needs to be fixed, there was a console tab on the dbd steam discussions and most of the posts were about the framerate needing to be fixed.
---
The add-ons may be worth using, but perks still suck for them currently.
---
Same right now, Xbox One. 3 straight lobbies as killer closed “due to an error”. Sucks too - literally just bought Oni and was excited to play.
---
Real money, go leatherface. His perks bbq and Franklin's are both really solid. 
---
With shards id go either oni, because he is new and strong, or plague. Plague is just fun to play as.
---
An idea to help with Steve’s perks
---
Babysitter-After unhooking a survivor they get a 2 second speed boost, you are than afflicted with exhaustion for 60/50/40 seconds. (or they don’t grunt for 3 seconds) and don’t leave scratch marks or blood for 3 seconds. It’ll give more utility to the perk than just don’t look over there look at me.
---
Camaraderie- While a teammate is on the hook and you are in a 12 meter radius the perk activates giving them 7/14/21 extra seconds on the hook. Can only be activated once per survivor. Gives the perk more utility to teammates since before it was very niche in its uses.
---
Second wind- After getting unhooked you are afflicted with the broken status affect and start to passively heal for 30/27/24 seconds. Just makes the time more reasonable than being able to heal faster.
---
I always forget to use my flashlight so I don't like running it, as for the key it can come in clutch but you have to know what the requirements are for hatch to even spawn and the likely spawn areas
---
You should definitely report that, that shouldn't be happening
---
I hate to say it, but self care is really once useful as a beginner. I ran it a lot too but once you get better and find other perks, it’s a good idea to drop it. Your other perks aren’t bad tho. But if you can, try Nancy’s self healing perk instead. It’s pretty good.
---
Replace Dark Sense with Spine Chill or Alert if you really want to know where the killer is, you can also replace it with Object of Obsession.
---
Spine Chill is all around a better perk for knowing where the killer is, if the killer is looking at you within a 36 Meter range it lights up letting you know they are nearby and looking in your direction. 
---
Alert allows you to see where the killer is when he performs a break action either on a Gen or Pallet
---
Object of Obsession allows you and the killer to see each others auras, and is busted in SFW if you know how to run the killer but you seem to want to play immersed Claudette so it's optional. 
---
Replace Plunderers instinct with literally anything but the exhaustion perks like Sprint Burst, Lithe, and Dead Hard are are good choices, as well as some other perks like Iron Will and Urban Evasion would work well for keeping stealthy as well as Fixated if you don't wanna run UE. 
---
To replace Selfcare (it isn't necessary to replace it but we can) you can replace it with Inner Strength, Adrenaline or Second Wind since they are generally better but if your up against killers you don't want to or can't heal against you could take a perk like Borrowed Time or the new Lucky Break. 
---
Empathy is great but again you can replace it with something like Botany knowledge if you only want to help yourself or you can replace plunderers instinct with We'll make it to help unhooked people better.
---
Get rid of self care for iron will and dark dense for urban evasion if you like to play immerse
---
Lol the first three doors all should have been legion.
---
In the reboot he sprinted around a lot
---
I was doing a challenge on the last tome to fix generators so I brought a toolbox, I got hooked and a Dwight with a med kit came and unhooked me. He immediately ran off into the corn and lost me leaving me injured while the killer was in the area. So I ran to the nearest generator and started fixing it, the killer found me found me hooked me and I died. If I had brought self-care I would have hopped behind a wall and healed real quick before finishing that generator. Point is you can't always rely on your teammates or bring a medkit. It is a very useful perk. This was at rank 9 by the way so not high level but not absolute noobs either. I really wished I had brought self-care that round.
---
Thats is ture I kinda forgot
---
I like him. He’s a good mix of spirit, billy, Myers
---
Your opponent is not responsible for your fun.
---
Nope
---
Not crying, just calling you out.
---
True dat
---
It be like this unless the killer is a stealthy boy
---
Try their Discord. I tried once and was swarmed with people telling me it's perfectly fine and you don't need that good of a framerate on DBD because it's not a shooter (I know, I know, but arguing with them got me nowhere). One guy claimed he has it on PC and PS4, but prefers PS4 because it plays better...
---
Dont mind this comment I aint sure what I ment to say
---
ayy can you reply to me saying hi
---
That's scratched mirror Mikey in a nutshell for me lol. I never play it to win I'm just trying to jump scare people as much as possible. My best one was last night on the new Yamoaka map: a Claudey was trying to heal right underneath the giant building in the center in a bush. I climbed up onto the temple and freaking WWE John Cena'd her from the top ropes and smacked her right on the top of the head. After the game she said it almost gave her a heart attack lol.
---
Honestly sometimes when I get into the struggle phase, I accidentally die bc I lose rhythm in tapping. Like I get bored and idk lmaoooo. So like me being faced with dc penalties isn’t right
---
I would love to have young ash, tbh they really didn't get the current look of bruce campbell right. 
---
IMO atleast.
---
So you 3 gen yourself and expect to have a third chance at escaping?
---
Why bring Ash into this!?!?!
---
HyperX Cloud Alpha. I just bought a second pair. I've owned Turtle Beaches, Polk Audios, Astros and recently bought Steel Series Arctis 3's(which I returned for a 2nd pair of Alpha's). I can't tell you how comfortable these are and they sound incredible. They're on sale at GameStop for $79 right now. They work on my Switch, PS4 and Xbox. Says on the box they'll also work on PC, Mac, Mobile and VR. Bought my 1st pair about a year ago and they're tanks. No issues at all, just wanted a second pair because I love them so much.
---
Yup same. Probably has to do with the hotfix coming.
---
I had this problem all day. I sent a ticket into BVHR and they emailed me back saying that they're currently trying to fix the problem but dunno how long it will take. They apologized a bunch and said they're working on a patch.
---
She still is the strongest killer in the game
---
My Demogorgon screams like, once and then he's a good little demodog
---
ooo calling me out for teabagging for a second, how terrible of me. Must be the only person to have ever done that, grow up you wetwipe
---
Before the deep wounds change, Deep Wounds would not go down while you were in the Killer's Terror Radius.
---
Nemesis made it where, if you stunned the killer with a pallet, you lost the Killer's Terror Radius.
---
Ergo, if you stunned them with a pallet, deep wounds would go down even if the Legion was tickling your bumhole.
---
Maybe I'm missing your point but you're also obviously missing mine. Point is NOED is not some awful evil perk that rewards Killers for failure. It's okay for people to use it sometimes.
---

The point is you can get matched up with players within 6 ranks of you, lower or higher. So what you got matched up with is perfectly normal. I'm the same rank as you and face the same thing. It is kind of harsh sometimes but it is what it is.
---
Kill is kill made me burst out laughing. Love this meme
---
Hmmst
---
There is ONE that if ean properly you literally CAN'T catch the survivor, I forget the map but it's a Macmillian, then again, if you mindgame correctly you'll be fine.
---
Not anymore, they changed it, remember?
---
You are not wrong
---
with 7000 hours clocked in on the game in november i can for sure say sloppy is really strong.
---
Myers is always so much fun
---
So he's basically a Trapper that also sometimes is a Billy?
---
What happened with wake up?
---
With so many hours I would think you would find better perks but ok.
---
Come on man, you didn’t even take your 2nd. Grade teacher’s advice on which “their” to use.
---
True, even without that, he always seems to have perfect timing
---
She cheated she had cannibals eat chunks of her
---
IMO they should always be on opposite walls across the map so the Killer doesn't just get an easy gate camp.
---
Me using David only because he’s hot
---
No distance with the speed burst for the surv after first hit is what’s nice about it to me, you don’t have to keep catching up to the survivor to down them
---
Rude I'm trans too and I have normal hair
---
Apparently it was supposed to give a 20% speed boost to opening gates but that speed boost got applied to everything so all the survivors running wake up were basically on crack.
---
Holy *fuck* that is some PTSD
---
1000% this.
---
To be fair when he first started using “his“ Spirit build he did keep correcting himself and saying that it’s technically just “a” build. Eventually though he found it easier to just call it his build so chat knew what he was referring to. 
---
Now he’s admitted he refers to the Thana/sloppy/nurses/ruin Ghostface build as “his” build cause of how pissed off people were about “his” Spirit build and he enjoys fucking with the people who get so bent out of shape over what someone else calls something
---
Wake Up was bugged where it gave it's 15% speed buff to everything, not just doors. What made it worse was that sprint burst was bugged at the sane time where you can hold sprint burst for an indefinite amount of time until you needed it.
---
This is spot on. The mask is especially great.
---
It gave a 15% speed boost to every action, not just opening gates.
---
Earlier, I was playing killer. I let a Quentin live, as I always do because of a strict moral code (don't kill Quentin.) We played a few games. I was hooked in the basement on the new Yamaoka map. The Killer hit me through multiple pallets, and of course, I was trapped in the Abyssment. So, I spent the rest of that game whispering "Operation Health" into the mic. On a side note, I was the Obsession when all 3 other Survivors had DS, and neither I nor the Killer had an Obsession perk. So, yeah. O p e r a t i o n H e a l t h.
---
You forgot a couple of Legion doors.
---
Those were dark times. 
---
It was genrush central as Killer and I had to stop running my favorite perk as Survivor. :c
---
This was a bug that was in a game even before the latest patch, idk what causes it.
---
His imagined chase music better be "Ki Ki Ki Ma Ma Ma"
---
It prolly ain’t even hard
---
There are people who preffer console over pc on any game, the reasons as to why i personally don't know, maybe its the fact that they like using a controller and don't like using it on pc since it's for the most part a disadvantage (considering which game they're playing).
---
Point is that there will always be those weird people who like the fact that the game ocationally dips to 3 fps while in game no matter what game we are talking about, but the vast majority of people with functional retinas will tell you that it indeed is a problem. 
---
Plus we know BHVR actually listens to feedback and ocationally likes to fix or change things for some random reason (like the balance of certain killer or perks ^(\*cough\* pig and bl \*cough\*)) so there being a group of insane people who like to play dbd on a powerpoint slideshow shouldn't be keeping them from getting the feedback from the people who are having problems,especially when there have even been youtube videos made about it, it really isn't an excuse to not fix the framerate, but more than likely a problem BHVR might have with either the engine or the consoles or both.
---
Nurse and Huntress... sure.. just because being precise on a controller can be a pain in the ass...but Oni and Billy? Nah.. I don’t think so. Billy was arguably THEE best killer on console until Spirit was released with room to debate about the effectiveness of others. Not to mention your whole claim is pretty convoluted, expecting a game designed for PC to be 100 perfect after transition to console is not logical in the slightest.. hell.. I don’t think Skyrim is even properly optimized for console and that’s been out for how god damn long now? Seems more like just aimless bitching than a legitimate complaint imo, but that’s just me.
---
Imagine caring about internet points in general haha
---
you still HAVE to go through that 4 second cooldown, whether you either hit the survivor again or manually deactivate your frenzy. That's what allows the survivor to get to an open position, if they stay out in the middle of nowhere and don't run anywhere well then that's on the survivor, but most survivors would have  the understanding to go to at least some kind of loop after they're hit and then the standard M1 chase begins once you enter frenzy, sure you might get there first if you make it a point to, but that doesn't really work on literally any other loop.
---
Regardless of how you play Legion, you will have to end up canceling your frenzy and start M1 chasing someone, whether it's the 1st survivor or 4th survivor, so I get what you're talking about. I do it all the time, if I can't see anyone on killer instinct I cancel it. That still  doesn't make it that powerful, the power is definitely still lacking in a lot of areas as well as having still too many downsides to it to actually be worth even using sometimes. missed attack drains your power and stuns you, 4 second stun, 20 second recover, can't physically down anyone, waste to use on an injured survivor. Literally look at ANY other killer and at the BEST use of their power they get guaranteed downs, that isn't the case with Legion who still has to regularly chase survivors.
---
why is thanatophobia/devour hope especially strong on legion?
---
Really, wow that's rough for Myers mains.  Was so easy before, now half the time I don't get any juice.
---
I love your art dude, the style is just the best
---
I love that idea and Freddy has similar addons so why not.
---
Myers stalking me whilst I cleanse a full totem for the extra points
---
Yes, I’ve tried. No, thank you. Useless when there’s literally a hook around every corner or 2 meters away. Very, VERY situational. And MoM is still buggy for me with protection hits.
---
Sometimes. But if the killer has NOED or has rotated back to the hook after every unhook then I’ll assume they probably aren’t the kindest
---
Often altruistic
---
They aren't balanced. There are 3 guaranteed god loops/pallets on all variations (2 in preschool, 1 killer shack) plus another two (1-story house) depending on badham variation (not map rng). There's also almost no mindgamable loops (there are unsafe/bloodlustable pallets, but two of the guaranteed pallets feed straight into god loops).
---
Ricardo next new survivor?
---
Burger King Myers is not even on the scale
---
Dumbass, none of this made sense!!! Its not a 1=1000000 chance to spawn hidden!!!! Its a 1/5 fucking dumbass. Survivors dont always spawn near it either!!! Its a random spawn chance11!!1!!!
---
/s
---
DEMODOGGO LEGION IS ME TOO
---
I want Legion to be good, I really do. Their power needs a rework with no deep wounds. Deep wounds causes too many problems and is hard to balance.
---
He has canonically killed Freddy and Jason in a comic that’s considered canon.
---
The best thing about Myers is that he can only gain evil from one survivor at a time while Ghostface can stalk any number of survivors at once.
---
Steve has women lining up for Ice Cream, or so I've heard.
---
*coughcoughChapter15coughcough*
---
Just to keep it simple that this isn't an early leak of something, keep this to this post specifically
---
I’ve been using the Logitech G430 on pc for a little over 2 years. The audio and mic are great, definitely recommend. I’m pretty sure they’d work for ps4 but you might want to double check for yourself
---
It’s most likely isn’t, I presume main issue is auras/scratch marks etc, they could just add a colour change option, not like it’ll provide an advantage to anyone else. I’m all for this
---
Thats a free survivor exit then
---
You mixed up perks, Premonition is the better, not Spine chill...Spine Chill doesnt let you see where the killer is, only lets you know that is looking in your direction
---
I'm grateful you did not mention killers or survivors, it is indeed a two way street.
---
Wish more DbD players understood this.
---
That’s who I was thinking about picking up
---
I always let them go as long as they weren’t toxic, I can respect a good survivor.
---
All the way back. It's 25% of a fully progressed generator.
---
More like a coinflip.
---
yes, that was a definite inspo for the idea i posted. :)
---
I was playing Huntress and I hooked someone in the basement (before I knew about the glitch), then everyone rushed down for the save and I killed them all before one unhook even happened, and they got pissed because I "won because of a bug." Entitled survivor mains I swear dude

If this is a BAD edit.. damn you have some high standards bruh lol. If this WAS edited (which I know it isn’t) it would be a pretty damn good job, especially for the DBD sub.
---
Pair that with his new Cosmetics and you are in for a damn good time!
---
If it’s at less than 25% when you kick it it goes to 0 and stops pumping.
---
25% flat. Meaning of the survivors repaired 25% of a generator and you kick it, it will automatically regress back to 0%.
---
Yup.
---
Now, I'm gay as hell. I'm strictly into females, and I want this to be clear before I continue.
---
But have you seen Michael?
---
I worded it wrong Spine Chill lets them know that they are looking at you
---
Neat mask.
---
Same as a pig main
---
just run STBFL get them wounded bait them on a wall vault. They never see it coming
---
Is it bad that even if oni is bad on console, I feel like I'm a god at him for my rank (9)
---
Wrong sube matey, this is the DBD reddit, not RE
---
I wasn’t around during that time so I don’t know how bad it really was but at least you could still play the game as both survivor and killer. With this bug once you’re hooked in the basement it’s game ova
---
I’ve been having a lot of visual bugs with Oni’s club where it blocks my vision
---
With the newest patch they're a lot more fun to play. Faster so you can injure survivors faster, faster vaults makes it easy to maintain close distance no matter what, and pins actually function. Even though the pins are pretty useless, you usually only want to consider cooldown/duration/recharge
---
Did you see the part where they said they are are beginner?
---
Fellow pig main endorsing this manifesto; really like the idea of an add-on that makes a survivor start the trial with a trap. 
---
I think a bloody coil-esque add-on could also be good, making survivors injured when they use a box.  
---
Some adjustments are needed for her end game as well, she really got screwed over when EGC was added. Maybe like all traps placed during EGC should activate instantly.
---
Overall I think she's in a pretty decent place right now but I wouldn't say no to my favorite and main killer getting another look for some buffs or qol changes.
---
Sure but what’s the difference at that point, ya know? You can get some minimal BP for the extra chance or get to your next game faster and possibly with the extra escape points.
---
There are 3 god pallets, two in school, one in shack, and then there is one really good window which only matters if the killer is following you as you get to it. 95% of the of the other pallets are unsafe and can be played around. Technically the house has two god pallets but the survivors have to drop those earlier or they just die due to how small of loops there are in that house.
---
Compared to actual broken maps like the farm maps or Strode, Bedham is pretty balanced.
---
I personally like Ghostface with his OG outfit.
---
How did you wiggle out at 75%?
---
Been having the exact same issue.
---
She’s not that strong, against bad survivors she has chances. But majority don’t cleanse, so she just turns into a 4.6m/s killer and just 1 hit downs. It’s very easy to loop her because of this, however if you use add ons that as a gen is complete you gain a pool of corrupt or you start with some, you can take advantage of it. People cleanse far away from all gens to waste her time and make her lose the game. So she ends up being boring and just gets looped for years. After you vomit you do nothing but chase majority of time
---
After hooking a survivor, you can stomp one gen and get rid of 25% of its progress.
---
people dont really know much about its side effect though, Once you hit a gen you get 3-4 sighs from the survivors and at least one of them says "thanks, i love holding m1" sarcastically
---
Nemesis on Myers with notebook.
---
Hes strong and super fun, but the problem isnt practice, the flick is literally impossible because of the current sensitivity settings
---
Ok, I keep seeing posts about the "basement glitch" and as a killer kain, I kinda feel like an ass not knowing about it.

Add-ons that add charges are bugged right now.

Closing hatch doesn’t proc Rancor if it’s last survivor. So maybe that but if not then it’s a bug.

Wow good plays on console?!
---
Hes not bad, hes just way easier to counter on console compared to pc, if hes S teir on pc right now, hes A-B teir on console, still good, but easily countered
---
Is this a new fix or something? I play Xbox and I can always see survivors hooked in the basement. I’ve seen a few other posts like this today too...
---
You siad long term player, but 340 hours? Thats playing yeah, but since beta seems like a half truth.
---
Also, complaining about end game camping really doesn't show "long term", if you ever played killer youd know end game camping is literally the only thing o do, or survivors escape
---
Of course, but it was in the context of an argument about performance. A console user, who deserves better performance and should've had it by now, was arguing AGAINST it. You see it all the time.  
---
I think you're wrong on this one. Yes, they listen, but they don't do as much as they could. Trust me man, if we seriously banded together and threatened their profits, they'd do something in a flash. If they truly can't optimize the game, they'd do something like a "performance option", downgrade the game to something that of the Switch version and make it optional in the settings for those who'd prefer it. Lots of things they could do, but they're not doing them so who cares that they're listening and occasionally throw us a condescending "we are working hard on improving console performance". Well fucking improve it already. They'd do it in a week if we stopped throwing money at them for cosmetics until shit gets done. But we won't.
---
No. Go to one gate, open till the bar is underneath the “E” in exit, wait for killer to come and go, finish.
---
It really sucks when the fuckin scratchmarks *blend* with the corn. I've been using modified lenses to make yellows of certain hues (to my eyes) look red since launch just to see them.
---
I saw this while playing yesterday n was like wtf weird flex but okay
---
Oh god dont even get me started with Billy, nurse is possible, but Billy is so terrible
---
The issue with any perk that works on failed skillchecks is that it is a low rank punish perk that is worthless at high ranks.
---
Which is TERRIBLE perk design.
---
And before you ask, yes I spelled 'regrets' wrong on purpose, it's a reference to 'Postal 4: No Regerts'
---
It just happened to me again on xbox about 1 hour ago. It wasn’t fixed for us.
---
And what about the bug where you get cheated out of struggling and you get killed even though you still had plenty of struggle time left?
---
Cause I play on PS4 and that shit STILL happens.
---
Suggestion for the RBTs and Billy boxes.
---
Do the two key idea but instead of making the second one random make the first one random and the second key always be the furthest box from the first key (and crucially only have it activate after the first key is found meaning it can be in a box you already checked).
---
This way it puts pressure on survivors to start checking boxes ASAP instead of doing gens cause they might need to check every box once then go all the way across the map again to get the second one.
---
If the first key is always the first box you check and the second one is random there’s a chance you’ll do the first box then find the second key in the very next box you check.
---
Doing it my way guarantees a minimum time to get it off of how long it takes to search a box, walk across the map, and search a second box with a potential maximum being much longer.
---
What we want isnt a buff to oni, but better sensitivity settings, it would make oni, Billy, nurse, and every other killer more viable
---
The Busta outfits would be fucking fire
---
Wouldn't they kinda have to though? I don't have that one specifically, but the colorblindness that muddles blues and greens would devastate colorblind killers against survivors with those color cosmetics on Autohaven and Macmillan respectively
---
thx bvhr
---
Also know as... Ash with the end of days outfit.
---
&gt; 200 downvotes
---
That's 200 people who've DCed against Leatherface
---
This will never happen, but I fucking wish it could.

I imagine he'd say dumb one-liners in the lobby like Ash.
---
That just sounds like Trapper and Oni with extra steps

You should still fill out a support ticket [here](https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us).
---
Same with Deliverance. That perk was back to doing nothing a week ago.
---
*JUST* AS I THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING THIS
---
I let basically any Survivor who played like a good sport go at the end, and will count my Hooks for this reason. I feel like “rewarding” Survivors for that behaviour is pretty healthy for the game overall.
---
I don’t mind getting looped, pallet slammed or even mind gamed. If you have the skills for that, good job. It’s when people start getting cocky and teabagging/flashlight clicking/emoting every time they are within radius of me because they know they can ‘bully’ me is when you get Proximity’d and Tunneled.
---
his mori is  him slowly fucking the survivor to death with his green cock
---
i mean, they did say that anything is possible at this point, even danny devito as a survivor from their AmA lmao
---
but yeah one-liners in the lobby would be amazing
---
This is true. This is also high school.
---
Same, I’ve been a survivor main before and *OHHH BOY* there’s a reason I’m not anymore,, so I try to be kind (to those who deserve it)
---
And somehow It hasn’t been fixed yet
---
I actually think this is a pretty decent idea tbh.
---
The only secrets killers have are Moris and the ones that switch the killer your playing so it’s always safe to assume that a secret offering is a moro
---
their replacing random skill checks with backwards skillchecks
---
I actually did this yesterday and totally didn't really know about it. One very upset survivors in chat afterwards.
---
Has there been any word on an ETA for when it'll rollout for Xbox?
---
Above billy in most games. 
---
Unless all 4 survivors are great at chases and/or the map they have is really stacked in their favour, you will get a hit or two before 2 gens pop and he's way stronger than billy at that point.
---
They finally buffed the Pig! Amanda got smart and trapped the generators, now messing up has Saw-like consequences
---
Does it affect borrowed time? I thought borrowed time was its own thing
---
Killer dropped him I believe
---
This is a great idea. Without Pop, as it is, kicking gens is almost always detrimental to you. It kicking them actually did something you might even see less slow down builds
---
I was playing as Billy one time and downed a survivor in front of the exit gate. I was about to hook her when I noticed her teammates just up and left. Felt bad so I let her wiggle out at the gate
---
Huh? Basment glitch? So they werent teabagging to give up? Well shit, i feel like an asshole now
---
If you're saying the regression doesn't do anything then you clearly didn't play before they added it to the game. The system works exactly as intended. It's not meant to be a huge hit, it's meant to slowly reverse the progress so survivors can't just leave a bunch of generators at 99% and then complete all at once.
---
If you're the killer and truly want to hurt generators, then you're looking to use Overcharge, Huntress Lullaby, maybe Dying Light (Not mentioning Ruin because I think it's used too commonly, but obviously that's an option too)
---
He wasn’t chad enough to keep his son alive
---
There is no basement glitch anymore. It is fixed
---
No it is not toxic to bodyblock as wraith
---
Noobs be downvoting
---
He had a son
---
To be fair deep wound didn't down anyone who had the brains to hold m1 to mend. 
---
Not much has changed in that department.

Ty 4 explanation
---
Wraithy boi
---
It's really not, though. It's the law of **bad** programming. There is literally no reason why adding new content should break core mechanics like being hooked in the basement or sounds in general. The fact that it happens consistently means their codebase is fubar. Unfortunately, they probably already fired/replaced the person/people responsible, but things will continue to break until they completely rewrite the old code, and there's not much the new programmers can do. Source: Former game dev.
---
That is actual bullshit
---
I mean that people get shot up into the air and can't move after being unhooked cause they're blinded. Poor wording on my part.
---
Fixed on PC at least :/
---
Fair points, guess we really just have to hope for some kind of miracle in the future that would cause for it to get fixed, meanwhile we can just avoid bringing up performance when talking to hardcore console players, its best to not waste your time since they won't listen anyway.
---
What else do you need to guarantee a 4k sweetie
---
Finally someone brave enough to say what we’re all thinking
---
For me it’s less being close to completed, and more “Well I do this thing almost every game! Should be easy to do once I select it!” And so I select it and struggle for the next 6 hours to do it.
---
People want to try and experience it and get a feel for it while there is a lot of people playing the new killer.
---
Is 5% a huge hit? As it is now its not worth going through a 3 second animation that can get negated by a tenth of a second tap by a survivor. Also youre a big mother fucker kicking the shit out of a generator, tell me that shouldnt do at least a little bit of damage to it.
---
As a Wraith main, these game breaking bugs were really frustrating. I was like "Did they nerf wraith?" I figured it was a bug because it wasn't nowhere in the latest patch. Wraith sucks right now because of the no haste status when uncloaking. Thanks for posting this bruv, we need this to get fixed pronto.
---
I'm not shitting on Tru3. He's found an insanely strong build that just works.
---
I don't like his build because it's borderline OP, imo.
---
wonder if wraith is going to mark his face again..
---
Battery add ons for flashlights dont work either.
---
Postal Dude wouldn't even fuckin die. He'd just piss on the screen and kill himself.
---
There is no excuse for this. All of the other game companies somehow manage to push out updates without game breaking bugs every two patches.
---
In this case the entity will just be like "Fuck this I can't feed off on this!"
---
The basement glitch has been fixed but it was messing up peoples games and making them see what looked like the sky and they couldn't do anything once it happened. 
---
Wraith body blocks for a hit aren't toxic either it's pretty smart.
---
Stop genrushing by making gens kill you. Ez balance kappa
---
How is he worse than legion. Especially “by far”.
---
cells or shards?
---
It seems like we’re just talking in circles at this point, but I’m just going to say if I of all people can consistently win with Legion at the highest rank, any one else can too. I didn’t want to try them because of how useless everyone said their power was, but playing this way has been killing rank 1 for me and it’s a lot of fun to play as. I recommend other people try it
---
Wait so I'm confused as someone who doesn't play console: did you lose connection or did the Killer DC?
---
Cause people downvote everything on this sub for no reason.
---
If killer dropped him he’d still be downed. I don’t think that’s the case.
---
Yes, I am aware.
---
But if the killer dropped him, he would have gone down, not been able to run away right?
---
Cause reddit killers are the type that unironically mained the old busted legion
---
Wasn't plunderers buffed? I think it's great now tbh.
---
Part time lover? I don’t get it.
---
It's a buff.
---
Especially since his shred is barely slower than just breaking. Also if you keep hatch closed and prep for endgame you’ve got it in the bag.
---
Yea I just had someone flip shit because I was let out and they died
---
Dropping someone gives them about 25% wiggle progress though.
---
I find it funny people feel he’s bottom tier, i have ad much success as i do with ghostface and wraith. Honestly i do better as legion than spirit, but maybe im just rusty as spiri
---
&gt;What devs break
---
-
---
&gt;What devs fix
---
That means they are chasing someone else and so happen to look in your direction or it's gostface trying to get a gengrab
---
I'm so glad to hear this. I just started playing her about a month ago right before the news about her getting changed. I decided to not even try prayer beads so I have a bunch of them saved up. Definitely looking forward to trying them out now.
---
What if they made it so that suiciding is okay after x seconds ? And can you explain me more on the swf abuse ?
---
As someone who takes a bus twice a day, I cried when I read this 😂😂😂 I’m so sorry that happened to you.
---
99 little bugs in the code, 99 little bugs. Take one down, patch it around, 137 little bugs in the code.
---
And there's no what?
---
Then you find a key a in a chest
---
Dropping someone gives them 25% wiggle progress. In this case, it was close enough that he was just able to break free because killer dropped him.
---
The mobile app I use will show it
---
Don’t know why you’re downvoted. You’re absolutely right. Ghostface can simply just leave chase, stealth, and get another free hit.
---
Flick was removed.
---
The Dude: gets hooked
---
Also The Dude: This can't be good for me but I feel great.
---
Then he's A tier.
---
That shit is so stupid and I love it, I'm a killer main and if I see both gates close to each other I set traps all over that area or just chill by one gate as MM, and stare at the other gate building my EW up as survivors try to open the gates. It's totally broken
---
tf is going on in this meme dear lord
---
I'm dumb and meant to say Dying Light.
---
omg you’re so pretty 🤭
---
Survivors bring flashlights just to see on it
---
Oh I know it’s been 15-20 mins to find a game and normally with a new killer for the first few days there is instant survivor lobby’s, but not this time around and I keep getting Mrs piggy or fucking legions...
---
The ones that downvoted are probably the same dumbasses that crouchwalk the entire game
---
Cells
---
What is the bug i havent played yet
---
I’ll break down each killers abilities so you understand but don’t get confused. The trapper is simple he places bear traps and if you walk into them you get injured. He has add-ons that can change their effect making you bleed more, get downed by them or get injured by disarming them. Counter play is to be observant when you are walking around especially the basement shack which is a wooden structure built in most maps that has a chance to house the basement. The wraiths ability is a bell he starts off cloaked and when he rings his bell becomes visible. While cloaked he cannot attack but he is able to check lockers, kick gens or pallets, vault and close the hatch. When coming out of cloaked form he gains a 1.5 sec speed boost making him have a huge lunge for the duration. While cloaked he gains a small speed boost but if you stun him while invisible or blind him with a flashlight he gets revealed and stunned for a long period of time. Add-ons can make the bell silent and make him faster than normal. The hillbilly has chainsaw sprint which makes home go really fast with limited mobility and if he connects with a survivor than they get downed instantly. If he connects with a wall than he is stunned for a brief period. Add-ons make him faster and turn faster. The nurse haven’t messed around with her changes but she has a teleport that is able to make her travel through walls ceilings and floors to a set location. Base kit she has 2 that recharge overtime. She is the slowest killer in the game slower than a survivor sprinting. After teleporting she has a brief window to attack, and after this she becomes fatigued for about a second being slower, looking away and unable to attack. She is still able to pull you off of a generator after blinking. Add-ons make it so she gains a blink but she can’t go through solid objects (she can still blink through pallets and windows) and the other makes her faster like a normal killer but she loses a blink. The Hag has 10 traps she can place around the map and if you trigger one while she is less than 40 meters away (about) she choose to teleport to it. However they do not trigger while you are crouched and they can be destroyed by a flashlight. Add-ons make her able to teleport to a trap from anywhere even when not activated, the traps instead slow you down or they have a secondary effect. The doctor has 2 modes treatment and punishment. Treatment mode makes your terror radius and basic attacks to a madness induced making the survivors hallucinate. These effects vary to a red stain, an illusionary doctor, face pallets and skull checks in random places on the screen. There are 3 levels the third you can “snap out” of each varying in effects. Add-ons change what you see while mad. Lastly the shock from treatment mode prevent survivors from using pallets or vaults for 2 seconds. Punishment mode is a basic killer with basic attacks. Myers has 3 tiers of “evil within” the first has no terror radius and slower speed the second is an average killer and the third is instant down basic attacks with tier 2 stats. Tier 3 lasts 60 seconds base and than goes back down to 2 the killer can never go back to one once they hit 2. Tier change is signified by the telltale theme song of Micheal. Add-ons make it so his tier 3 can last longer, and that tier 3 can instantly kill like a mori. Huntress is a ranged killer with hatchets that she can throw and she replenishes at lockers. Her add-ons can make her hatchets give different effects exhaustion, blindness etc; others make you instadowned, or highlighted. Lastly she has one that gives her more hatchets. The cannibal has a chainsaw as well that instadowns after a rev-up time but is in an area around him and he doesn’t go as fast as the hillbilly. After he hitting a wall he goes into a tantrum which extends the instadown time but makes him stay still. Add-ons make him slightly faster while using the chainsaw. The nightmare puts you to sleep over time. This makes you unable to hear his heartbeat but only the sound of the jump rope girls. While in the dream world you are can be affected by snares which lower your mobility. He also has an ability to teleport to generators. To escape the dream either fail a skill check, go to a highlighted alarm clock or have another survivor wake you up. His add-ons can change his power to dream pallets which are just like doctors fake pallets. The clown has a bottle that he throws which creates an area of gas anyone inside will slow down and cough while having reduced vision. Add-ons make you able to be instadowned if he hits you point blank with a bottle, expand the area of the gas and add extra slowdown. The spirit can traverse the ethereal plane to travel around the map. Unlike the Wraith this is a limited use and can be used for only a few seconds before going on cool down. While in this mode she cannot see survivors but she can see their scratch marks. After she exits she gets a speed boost to catch survivors. When she does this she leaves a husk and an audio cue of breaking glass is heard. Add-ons can make blood visible during her power, increase speed and duration or removes the audio cue so you never know when it’s used. The legion has feral frenzy; a mad dash that makes his basic attacks apply deep wounds and increases his movement speed. He cannot down survivors in this state and as a brief fatigue window in between uses. Deep wounds is a timer that if you do not mend in time you get downed but only ticks down when out of the killers terror radius. During this frenzy legion can vault pallets and windows at the same speed as survivors. Add-ons can make his terror radius stretch the whole map during feral frenzy, allow him to see gen progress through walls during frenzy and to apply effects if you are hit twice in one activation. The plague also has a ranged attack. When using “vile purge” she sickens survivors and they soon become broken making them injured until they cleanse. However if you cleanse she gains corrupt purge which has the same distance as vile purge but it does damage to you instead. When vs a plague don’t cleanse. Her power can be used in generators to stop infect survivors who touch it. Her add-ons can make you be revealed when you vomit from sickness, gain corrupt purge on gen completion along with effectiveness and duration increases. (Almost there). Next is ghostface his power is similar to Myers but is tracked on individual survivors. “Night shroud” his power makes his terror radius 0 and allows him to stalk and lean around corners. After stalking for a time the survivor becomes exposed meaning the next attack will kill you no matter what. By looking at ghost face you reveal him and he can no longer stalk you tell his power comes back. Second tid-bit he can crouch like a survivor. Add-ons can make his power be better for tracking and make his reveal hitbox smaller. The demogorgon has 2 powers. Shred and portals; Shred is a pounce that can hit from about 6ish meters and portals are what they say on the tin. A base of 6 portals can be placed around the map and if he stands on one he can TP to another. After TPing the portal is revealed and survivors can destroy it. After TPing you momentarily have a 0 terror radius. Add-ons can make him see injured survivors while TPing, and effect survivors that are removing portals. Lastly The Pig which has 3 main abilities. Crouch is used to sneak around the map and if you attack from this state than you do an ambush attack which is a huge dash attack that makes an audio cue when started. Her main power is jigsaws baptism or better known as the reverse bear trap. These can be placed on downed survivors. After a gen is completed the timer starts and the survivor has to find the correct jigsaw box (base 4) to remove it. If this is not done the survivor dies on the spot. The timer is paused when downed, in a chase and cannot activate when searching a jigsaw box. I do not own this killer so I don’t know the add-ons.
---
Once again hope this helps, and I’m sorry about the length of it.
---
At time yeah but at times no , so this one game this David had mither and I was ghost face , the moment I hooked him he commuted suicide
---
It is such a negligble change 99% of the time. Idk wtf you are smoking.
---
he do be like that when someone calls him
---
*“oni-chan”*
---
I haven't heard anything about the next killer but there's a doctor rework coming up, and hopefully a pig rework as well.
---
Seems most color blind ppl are perfectly fine with just changing aura. Cause changing color of survivors could lead to very unfair advantages that I’m sure everyone would exploit. So in the end some would have to compromise
---
Have you restarted your game recently. A new patch came out that was supposed to fix that today.
---
And Killer mains don't. The fighting continues.
---
They were originally slotted for today, but because of the basement bug and all the other ones that popped up during the update they pushed tests back a day. Official builds for DC Punishments have yet to be slotted.
---
Farming items is literally the only point of plunders my guy
---
You bring up a good point, the beta for this game was over 3 years ago. How can he make an opinion on the game if it seems like he barely plays it
---
BT gives you Deep Wounds. It hasn't been its own thing since Legion was introduced and has been affected by Terror Radiuses since then. That's like a year ago.
---
I'm a killer main and I'm not sure about that. The wiggle increase prevents a lot of drop abuses, and I don't think that should just be invalidated because they're at the end of their struggle.
---
Killers generally have an idea of how long the wiggle is and they know what will happen if they drop them.
---
Wait, can you Mori someone then get hit with a pallet and Mori that person too?
---
what if it wasn't? that's literally the point of this whole post lol
---
Just do it early as it still counts even if you don't get the save.
---
Yeah, I really dislike it. Shit everywhere, tons of grass, low visibility. Another map that is aesthetically pleasing but is not really well balanced.
---
Except if the survivors have to stick that closely to the generators, the killer can almost definitely get a quick hit on the survivor, kick the gen, then walk away. 
---
Then the survivor would have to decide between healing which takes a significant amount of time if you don't have an item, or risk getting downed next time the killer comes around.
---
Your claim is valid, but only really holds up if you have perfect communication between all the survivors, which outside of SWF is very rare. In many games you'd find people just hiding and waiting for the trap door or not even knowing where the last generators are.
---
All I'm saying is getting the last generator on can already be pretty challenging current-state if the killer doesn't go on a random chase, and adding more difficulty would just result in more games where the survivors fix 4 generators and then all slowly die off before anyone can escape
---
Yes you can
---
Damn I put myself on blast
---
Noed on ghostface
---
Excellent observation.  Kappa
---
Some tips for finding the hatch:
---
1. The places it likes to spawn the most are Hills, the Shack, and inside jungle gyms.
---
2. It only spawns when there's 1 person left, or the number of generators complete is equal to the number alive, plus one.
---
3. Using a key on the hatch is pretty situational and very difficult to pull off in solo queue.
---
4. Keys are most used when a team 3-gens themselves, and 1 person has died. Or when the killer closes the hatch &amp; the survivor re-opens it.
---
Oh yeah, you're right. My mistake.  
---
But IMO, he seems more like a Voltorb... ;)
---
Yeah. Personally I gave up finally and switched to PC. But I'm still rooting for my console friends and it still pisses me off they're not being treated with enough respect. It is what it is though.
---
Thank you. :) Have a upvote.
---
His ability shit when end game happens
---
Wait... This is a cosplay? I had to double look, so awesome!!! (. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)
---
So dont let it get to endgame.
---
Thanks. Someone told me his name so I'll look him up. Have a upvote for being so helpful. :)
---
You just need to blind the killer while he’s carrying someone yeah, the save doesn’t matter
---
The community is about as bad with features meant to help others as the Siege community. Damn even closer to Payday too
---
They got dropped, idk how it connects to your post either I just wanted to share.
---
Yes but the consequence is unimpactful 99% of the time, which is why Hangman's Trick is one of the worst perks in the game. It should just be changed as a quality of life thing. Would they rather me just slug and afk on them until they bleed out?
---
I mean there are dynamics to it, you could have effects even based on survivors hitting Great Skillchecks or skillchecks within a threshold of gen completion. If nothing else the Great Skillcheck one could actually be helpful at High ranks and would synergise well with Ruin.
---
I mean yes its not great but that is part of the wider discussion of the nonexistant fixing of the fundamentals of the game that seem to fall to the wayside because hey if Spirit and Nurse Nerfs showed us anything its that the devs want to quell alternate playstyles that are not just 'killer finds you,you run, you loop, killer gets looped'. Since we are all waiting for those inevitable GhostFace Nerfs because killer found another new way to play that does not fit into the looping narrative.
---
Back on topic though yeah some sort of perk that interacts with Skillchecks could be neat or function, it would not fix stuff obviously since end of the day Gen Timers, Higher ranked play/Decent survivors still makes Gens nonexistant but it could be neat to have a Perk that punishes Great Skillchecks with a smaller downside.
---
Dw, BHVR forgot him too
---
No that wasn’t the case
---
I caught a survivor in the corner of a map, tried to get him to one hook, nope escaped.  He went back to the same corner, tried a different hook, nope escaped.  He went back to the corner, I tried one last time, as I could have done better getting to that second hook,  NOPE ESCAPED...  :(
---
Kazan's son, Akito, didn't die. He suffered from a broken leg that never properly healed.
---
Lmao that's fantastic. I never thought to read it as big of a fan of the Evil Dead franchise I am.
---
awesome job :)
---
Or better yet, play however you want.
---
&gt;When detective's hunch activates, you'd be able to see all the chests right? therefore, you can see all survivors ( with the same range that is in the perk) 
---
It wouldn't stack like that unless specifically worded that way.
---
probably because survivors don't have a terror radius, and you don't have spine chill
---
You're just doo doo.
---
Thanks! ❤️
---
I think visually it improves the game but that’s just my onion lol
---
This killer is gonna be a really good killer for dbd
---
Wait r6 and dbd.....can we get married?
---
With the Doctor now being leaked to have custom Skill Checks that tick backwards, I really think The Pig could benefit from something like that.
---
Considering Jigsaws catchphrase, **I want to play a game**, Amanda’s traps literally aren’t as stressful or a big deal as they should be. Removing a Trap should feel more like “a game” instead.
---
Macabre Box searches should injure you every time, or at least apply the Hemorrhage Status. The Box in the movie is a bunch of saw blades that collect your blood as a sacrifice, they should at least do SOMETHING. And the Skill Checks either need to be harder or at least “mindgamey” in their own way. 
---
Backwards Skill Checks randomly thrown in would be a good start, and I’d love if the Box laughed at you for messing them up. Removing a Reverse Bear Trap is so boring. No player ever should be having trouble with the Skill Checks considering they are the same speed/consistency as Generator Skill Checks. Boring. They should be their own custom Skill Check with different speeds/mini games that apply randomly. 
---
Judging by her Power and all the Add-Ons, you can tell they really wanted to make her the ‘Skill Check Killer’, but the issue with that is every player for the most part knows how to hit a basic skill check by now. Backwards/slow/fast/crazy Skillchecks would really make her have more character and interaction.
---
Is this game dead? I’ve sat in lobbies for twenty minutes at a time. I got 2 games in 1 hour.. they were quick games too. Le Sad
---
they need to make Furtive Chase better, so it can combo with Nemesis more easily
---
I’m confused I just see a black screen for this video
---
I’d have to run that by my boyfriend first lmao
---
hag jumpscare is worse
---
Name checks out.
---
I haven’t been able to get past the lobby queue all day. I sit there with no survivors joining for about 5 mins before “No network connection” shows up and kicks me back to main menu. Can’t even make it into a lobby as survivor. So, you’ve had better luck than I have. I’m also on Xbox.
---
Rank 18 matchmaking with red ranks and getting 4k? Ok, sounds legit to me.
---
That’s fair
---
Thanks for your notice :)
---
Follow https://www.instagram.com/tydol.cos for more of my budget gaming/anime cosplay.
---
Yeah, i guess i should change the text to somewhat like " When you're able to see chests auras, you're also able to see the survivors auras blah blah blah, But the basic idea is out there, i didn't really think the detective's hunch part until a couple hours ago
---
I brought a yellow medkit today with a styptic agent and some charges, then I used the medkit cause I needed to heal quickly and the medkit just depleted, like the charges didn’t exist. I was so mad because I wasted my styptic. I also got the wiggle bug and the basement bug. Not a good day for me. Is BHVR even aware of these bugs? This is really discouraging me to play :(
---
Or, and hear me out:
---
*Some people are new to this game, and aren't exactly sure how to play.* So when they see a killer, they panic and drop pallets where they aren't supposed to. Not everyone plays through the possibilities in their heads before acting, some people just play how they do. You behaving like that towards them, or even this entire subreddit's *massive* toxicity towards anything less than the perfect play, immediately causes them to not want to play anymore. That's what leads to a game dying, and nobody wants that with dbd.
---
I dont know of the fixed it, I haven't played it in a long while.
---
If I didn't get close enough to maxing Devout I do the same
---
Slug em and let them bleed like the dogs they are.
---
Hey maybe your right and it would be a negative but i do wish the devs would try adding stuff like this, let it sit for a couple weeks and then take it out if its actually negative. I feel like they play very safe and dont want to try adding new things and just seeing how the game adjusts then making further changes from there. Idk if it would be to resource intensive to have a bunch of small updates every few weeks but it seems like they want to only shift things around if theres a huge out cry for months and then they nerf it to the ground instead of tone it down a little, let it simmer, then maybe tone it down more if needed until they reach a good spot ie. nurse and MoM.
---
It's just an idea, it's a perk that is basically useless unless you want to farm items, and chests are barely used, why not nerf by ½ or 1/4 the item chance and add all of these features? that would make this an even more unique perk.
---
That would be the other option, as it stands. It's a built in mechanic purposely placed to try and require the killer to roam and not just patrol one area. It's a deterrent to 3-gen strats. And while you can work around it by slugging, or by using the basement, or through perks, it remains there.
---
Now, if Hangman's Trick were to be changed to actually respawn used hooks as well as Sabotaged ones (Sabo'd hooks in 30/20/10 seconds, Sac'd hooks in 3/2/1 minutes), then that might be worthwhile. Having a perk option to let you bypass a deterrent mechanic is typically how things go.
---
No. It's too avoid people just dropping survivors who are close to free and denying them a killer grasp escape.
---
i just run stridor in this case. sometimes i just can’t see shit as a killer. when i’m playing survivor i always try to look thru the wall to at least try to see red aura haha
---
The matchmaking sydtem permits this, you just get unlucky wnough to always go up against survivors who are on the higher endnof the legal spectrum, same happens to me
---
Thats right, bow to computer, the master race
---
No... the perk itself is unique. It’s for loot. That’s it. Just don’t use it if you don’t want better items.
---
I wasn’t even trying to be Toxic, remove dbd out of your head, this could take place in any other situation, any other game, reactions, common sense, simple thought into what’s currently happening in front of you, and no the new player point you brought up won’t play here because I’m sure as you can tell in this clip this isn’t a game filled with new people.
---
On the flip side, it’s nice to be able to have whatever build you want on a character you like.

I think he meant that speed boost like a mix of hillbilly or oni with bubba. Its like a 1 time onslaught in a straight line once the gauge is fullfilled and he then has to charge it again.
---
Did the killer at least let you live?
---
Seeker can be improved by having a larger aura reading distance. Maybe 12-15? Thoughts?
---
What? My little is gonna get buffed?
---
Since when dies Yui have a motorcycle in the game?
---
I h8 myself SOOO much when i do this ugh
---
Wait I’m confused I thought the challenge was just to kill all 4 survivors so how did that challenge force you to play toxic? I just played as Myers and killed them to get it. Only challenge I thought was sorta toxic was the hook 2 ppl the same time in the basement cause that encouraged camping
---
He's strong, maybe he willed his son into existance?
---
I'm not saying you were being toxic. I said the way you were behaving towards them, *or* the subreddit's toxicity. And that's not entirely true. I let my girlfriend play on my account all the time, and she has no idea how to play. She just likes the game. I get messages all the time from my other teammates asking how I'm a rank 9 and play so poorly, and comments like that are the reason she never wants to get the game for herself
---
The wiggle one very well could be as just yesterday there was a glitch where players couldn't wiggle sometimes so maybe their hotfix fucked it up at the other end of the spectrum where it takes less now to get off the Killers shoulder.
---
They may all be the same but by far Quentin is the worst fashion wise and perk wise
---
Idk happened earlier today
---
I usually go for one last pallet happy run where I mark out unused pallets and get the killers attention to see how long I can run them, so far not once have I ran the endgame timer out doing so :/
---
I don’t think they wanna do that because it would be another thing they’d struggle to balance but I always liked the idea of it
---
Doesn’t even have to be any big difference, just small buffs based around one of each of the survivor’s perks (maybe Meg’s scratch marks naturally stay a second less, Claudette has a small buff to heal speed, Dwight has an in-built leader etc.)
---
Maybe when he is at full speed, (non-power) he has a jogging animation.
---
If it’s so negligible, why do you care?
---
Because Oni's power is technically better than Billy's when he can use it.
---
Than why are you asking for it lol?
---
That kinda depends on what jason its modeled after. Part 2-5 would have the jogging make sense but 6-10 wouldn't. I think the remake is a good fit because he is the only one that really sprints
---
An existing one but I think when you kick the FEB you get stuck in the object next to you
---
All the people saying hooks disappearing is "balance" or is to counter "3 gen", I am still waiting for an answer to why Hangman's Trick is one of the worst perks in the game.
---
The wiggle update
---
Thank you for viewing!
---
It's downloadable! [https://drive.google.com/file/d/13q3zU7nTNWsOeuMteqFF9qbBAOUe0WzO/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13q3zU7nTNWsOeuMteqFF9qbBAOUe0WzO/view?usp=sharing)
---
It wasn’t much of a “buff” still pretty worthless perk now.
---
The worst kind of blendette is the one urban evading to get you off the hook and the killer is no where to be found
---
I love the new yamoka map. It's my best map.
---
One if my friends, and by extension everyone we play with, quit DbD for this exact reason. He hates ranks since he gets salty in competitive games he doesn’t do well in, so he just stopped
---
That could be it, I was able to easily hit the wall to my right but hitting the gen required a little more precision
---
Potato
---
vibe check
---
Just make level 4 perks a thing, but have them be exclusive to the unique survivor.
---
The vast majority of the perks would be a small percentage increase, like the three levels before them.
---
The power is intended to be used as a bunch of free hits on multiple people and increasing his speed helps with that tremendously. You shouldn't just frenzy hit one person and chase them down unless there actually isn't anyone nearby, and even then it might not be the best move. Split pressure. Not every killer is meant to tunnel one guy at a time until he dies.
---
I think both perks are fine tbh. They weren't made to be top-tier perks.
---
I've just sent little messages trying to inform that basement is bugged to try and make it so some killers are aware of it. The kind killers who want to play the game but don't want to fuck over everyone else will understand and try avoiding it and if it's a toxic player who already knew then they weren't gonna change either way
---
So you've played him on both and you can flick just has good on both?
---
I'll give people mercy if the doors spawn on intersecting walls. There's nothing fair about me as a killer being able to stand between them spinning my camera towards both levers until I see you, your scratch marks or a door light.
---
If you don't think getting the entire team injured with no counterplay (because he can also vault as fast as you) then I don't know what to say. Everyone then either needs to waste a ton of time healing (which is pretty dumb since he can get a guarenteed hit on you the next time he sees you) or are basically permenantly exposed. Having pseudo NOED on survivors for the rest of the game is pretty good to me.
---
Sometimes I think it's a ghosty boy
---
As fearless on hooks, as he was in chases.
---
*Noob3 has entered the chat*
---
Between 40 and 50, there will only be 3 perks. That was the original change. The 4 perks only happen from 50 onward.
---
Or just pick the killer you have more fun with.
---
Yeah I was on auto haven and kicked the gen in the garage and got stuck
---
Ah, I thought it was 4 from lvl 40
---
Oh geeze... I typed it into Google and google gave me an auto-answer on the side of the page. I either misread it or it was old. Probably on me though. I'm sometimes an idiot.
---
-----
---
But then, yeah... If there's a perk that already counters the deterrent mechanic, we don't really need to add a base aspect to do the same thing.
---
I'd say make Hangman's more worthwhile in some fashion and let people build a perk loadout if they want to use that "Patrol this area" strategy.
---
------
---
And I'm not saying hooking the same survivor on the same hook. I'm saying if you Sacrifice/hook different survivors on the same hook you get a bonus.
---
Yui said: 💅🏻🔪💋
---
Yeah his flick is definitely the deciding factor of his power. He's just entirely crippled without the flick whatever will we do.
---
I actually didn't know that, thanks a lot!
---
He didn’t, she DC’d and we all followed suit
---
Depends. Sometimes you feel powerless as killer, so the times when you have full control really do feel nice.
---
Oh I knew they existed but my first game I was taught by someone else who knew the game so I never bothered
---
&gt;I feel this will help killers prepare as there are certain perks and strategies that are not strong against SWF.
---
When this doesn't work, they will resort to dodging nonstop. So no.
---
You are an Internet Explorer aren’t you?
---
Gotta be honest dude his ability is kinda thrift store hillbilly lmao
---
Yes, legion lovers
---

---
Docs treatment mode is INSANE
---
Nice concept, I’m not sure if I’m a big fan of the last perk as it might promote camping. Nonetheless nice work.
---
Insert the ever so popular "getting ready for a loogy" sound effect.
---
Let’s make mend 8.... no 4... no 1 second
---
Can console not adjust sensitivity?
---
Lets not forget he's literally the loudest too
---
I like spaghetti and meatballs.
---
Yummy!
---
Again?
---
This happened to me yesterday. I think I rubber banded slightly when kicking a gen and got stuck in it. I got a grab off the gen which freed me, but the survivor said from their perspective I teleported out of no where and grabbed them.
---
Dedicated servers haven’t effected flashlight saves at all. You just haven’t got good timing
---
Its so good i thought it was a render
---
Yeah, the state of the community right now is terrible
---
I was honestly wondering. But I guess you can just be a smart-ass. Like I seriously want to know if it's possible to do it on console close to as well as it can be done on PC.
---
He’s a little stronger because he can one shot with more control over it
---
Bodyblocking as a killer, Yh that’s so toxic omg. Stay at least 40m away from all survivors and never come close
---
You'd think that out of all things to fix in the game, it would be fairly simple to make exit gates on opposing ends of the map. Or if not that at least make them without DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT of each other.
---
We all did pretty much
---
It almost doesn't matter when you're playing an M1 killer like Pig, between wiping your blade (about 3 seconds) and the survivor's movement speed boost (2 seconds worth of 6 m/s) for being injured, the survivor is too far to chase (24 meters away, divided by the difference in your movespeed, takes ages) without the other downed survivor getting picked back up.
---
zero. her perks are garbage.
---
I'm confused on why he didn't get the mask
---
I'd say I'm a very good killer. If I can consistently get at 3 kills with mediocre killers. I used to play survivor a little more than killer, that's why I had never previously been in red ranks as killer. I also don't play scummy and camp or slug for hatch. I'd say I play pretty fair.
---
Stand User: Michael Myers
---
Stand Name: 「The Shape」
---
Yeah, but I'd have to change it every time I use him.  Might persevere and see what happens.  Just wondered if anyone else felt the same.
---
Then look around the exit gate for the survivors. It’s still a coin flip
---
Don’t worry, I got you!
---
That sounds really bad out of context
---
Fucking damn you...
---
You lost me at the bit where you suggest the Killer "guard the doors" instead of guarding his kill during EGC. If you've ever played killer and had somebody on hook after the gens are done you would know how ridiculous this sounds.
---
Much agreed.  My favorite is to play with the purple add on that Lets you see survivors auras in a 32 meter range
---
I named myself "Let Blind Plz" when doing the regular blind Rift. No one let me Blind.
---
I won't say I'm not guilty of abusing the permanent breakage of hooks but it is a balanced mechanic. Its avoidable if you know what you're doing, abled to be fixed if you so desire with a perk, and not something that comes into play too often. If its really a nuisance you can slug as it doesn't really hold the game hostage in any way. It may be annoying to deal with but it is a punishment for being careless.
---
Adrenaline on killer op please nerf
---
I think they do this so they can do the waste 15 pallets challenge
---
I don't think so. It happened to me on the new map as Oni, on top of the temple. I only got off because the survivors started doing the gen and I grabbed one off. Don't believe they actually knew I was there, but didn't say anything in post game.
---
"That just sounds like Wraith with extra steps."
---
I literally LOL when he suggested the killer "guard the doors" instead of staying on the person he hooked during EGC.
---
Not replacing, random skillcheck are part of his current base kit, not an add on.
---
You will be thankful for them if the killer is a hag
---
You get green rank survivors in your games?
---
Also, name one map other than Hawkins where the survivors don't have good loops they can't waste 5-7 minutes on if you just brainlessly follow them on.
---
0.69 seconds
---
Young, skinny Ash from Evil dead 2? That would be a cool skin.
---
It's pretty 50/50 though, considering they gave both Doc and Pig probably their best maps when they were added. Plagues a tossup because on one hand her map's huge and she has no movement ability but on the other there's not many trees or anything to protect you from Vile purge between the loops. But yeah, the new Yamoaka is definitely a terrible Oni map. Way too much shit to hide in when you can hear him coming from a mile away.
---
We’re gonna live forever is still bugged on Xbox. Once you reach max stacks, it prevents you from getting ANY blood points bonus. Absolutely ridiculous.
---
Well you could start running out of crouching without activating your Sprint Burst and then just pause running for a millisecond and start running again, which allowed you to Sprint Burst.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It may have "felt bad" because it allowed total potatoes to hold their Sprint Burst, but since exhaustion doesn't go down when a survivor is running, good survivors will still 99% their exhaustion recovery if they need to run around the map, so you'll go in for a hit and they'll zoom away and make you miss it.
---
Basically at higher ranks it didn't change much, I 99% my exhaustion to make killers whiff their hits whenever I can.
---
This would work if they made this a headpiece, kinda like what the Wraith has, but with the psyche ward gown? Might clip.
---
While the trapper cries the spirit smiles
---
wait neither of those things are toxic? noed is a solid end game tool when survivors are about to win and rotating back to the hook after the unhook is making sure the survivors isnt a stupid asshat staying under the hook. the game doesn't tell us you got unhooked so we can ignore it?
---
It increased everything by 15 percent. From gens to vault speed. It was very busted.
---
They just started
---
The Grid.......A digital frontier
---
It's gotta be flashy because 3rd person POV. Killer, well 1st person POV and all we see is there weapon (Except Mori).
---
Maybe.
---
Billy requires a bit more practice and skill to get consistent chainsaws with than Oni does.
---
I once was a blendette but I started playing killer main
---
Thank god killers were exploiting this claiming "I'm doing basement hook archive" without a basement build. I reported each of those rat bastards. I had to deal with this bullshit so many times. It got to the point where I had to find the basement and make damn sure I went down on the other side of the map.
---
I’m all good on PC.

Oof some people are the worst.

I'm the killer. I'm asking how to run it as a killer lul.
---
How fast either can get the 4 man injury is based entirely on how spread out the survivors are. The only time Legion trumps Plague is if all 4 are in the immediate area, and even then not by much, just tagging them with a smidgen of Vile is enough, otherwise Plague can probably get it done faster.
---
I would say early downs are better than early injuries, something Legion is incapable of unless you just don't use your power and face potato survivors. Something tons of killers can do.
---
I'm talking from my experience of actually using the power to at least injure 2+ people every time and even then the effort needed to get that is not worth either the risk or the reward. With how punishing a SINGLE Frenzy miss is, how inconsequential your power is if people don't heal, and with the recovery even between power uses, it can definitely be improved. While the speed buffs and actually making some of their add-ons good was a nice chance, Legion is still in a bad spot no matter how you play them.
---
I feel like we're arguing for the same thing, in saying that Legion can do some good, but I personally still feel like they can be improved.
---
I think he's just trying to say "I hope that's the case".
---
Different people have different playing styles. Just cause you play one way doesn’t mean everyone has to or should play the same way you do. Let them be
---
Yeah but remember when they released Freddy? Despite having an alright map, he was still at a huge disadvantage while playing on it because he was Freddy.
---
For sure, I’ve just never seen a game where someone’s play style is letting other people win. Different strokes, I guess.
---
I wish I had teammates like that 😭
---
Devs said in the past they wanted their game to be searious, yet they turned it into clownfiesta right with releasing Curtain Call chapter.
---
He recently released a video of him “destroying a toxic asshole”. It was just some ace that played well with a flashlight and ooo I think, didn’t teabag, didn’t blind at pallets. Just did some clicking and ran him around for a bit, and tru was beyond tilted at him and saying that “high ranks survivors and swf like when killers are play things to entertain themselves with”
---
His head is so far up his ass and his victim complex is extremely annoying to watch. He often posts videos of him “destroying toxic swf” when it’s really just a swf trying to get a flashlight save or using head on.

---
I go into instant panic mode and my heart races as I try to piece together what's going on and why I can't see anyone
---
That's the entire reason why I'm still here. When the game is working, it's fun. It's fun to mindgame the other side and to run fun builds and to get thrilling escapes or kills. But it just pisses the shit out of me so much more often.
---
Yeah I've been practicing, best I can get is like 60 to 70 degrees, not like what I hear they can do almost 180 degrees on PC.
---
It really is a stealth killer paradise. All three Ghostface games have just been easy 4man 5gens. It's a little early to say but I'm tempted to think it's his new best map, overtaking Hawkins. Half because you can sneak up to every single gen with really good cover (whereas the portal room gen in Hawkins is pretty much completely safe), and half because the circular-ish layout means Nurse's covers a massive % of the map just by controlling the big building in the center. The only thing Hawkin's has which is better is that a map offering is close to 100% guarantee whereas a Yamoaka offering pretty much gives you a 33% chance of the map you want.
---
Pretty sure we can
---
Lol if we're talking early game downs, Legion frenzy hits and is immediately only one M1 away. Plague still has to get someone entirely sick and then M1. So Legion wins that. Not by much, but he definitely gets it done faster.
---
And the speed at which both of these killers get an entire team sick is also entirely dependent on how spread the survivors are. If the 4 survivors are very spread out, Plague will suffer because she has no movement increases. I'm not trying to say Legion is better, but these points aren't even true.
---
If you cleanse on the side of the map where you've already popped all but one generator (to potentially avoid a 3-gen) in the corner farthest from all the generators, what is Plague going to do?
---
Walk across the map to get her corrupt purge? That's a free generator, the time it takes her to walk over there, get her corrupt purge, and walk back? Even on smaller maps this takes in excess of 15 seconds each direction, which is enough time for 3 survivors to hop together on a generator and 0 to 100% it while she's gone, and on larger maps...
---
I mean there are some it takes a good 20+ seconds to cross or more, crossing the map to get your corrupt purge and back is going to be 2 generators if all 4 survivors are still up and split into 2-mans.
---
Sure Plague can just puke on them again, though too many broken survivors means they get to choose when Plague gets her power and then (just like Myers EW3) immerse away from the generators for it to end, and Plague is right back where she started, particularly since she can't abandon the generators to hunt for them fruitlessly (or they just hop on generators she's not guarding) either.
---
Corrupt purge is VERY good if people don't cleanse smartly, but otherwise? Eh, whatever.
---
How many hours do you have
---
This sub just love to shitalk Tru for some reason
---
My comment still stands
---
Personally, as a killer i dont mind de-piping if i complete the challenge/daily ritual/whatever i need to do, its only one pip, so...
---
More like facing the clown
---
You could at least see and try to get kills, compared to being blind
---
Update, the game I got into had a basement camping bubba, 2 people in there within 2 minutes and they let go straight away, not even giving me and the other guy not hooked time to do a generator or anything.... So much fun...
---
Just a friendly reminder that the word "toxic" no longer holds any significant meaning on this sub, or in general.
---
Never heard of Faker because I don't play LoL but I've heard of Tyler1 many times, that shows how popular he is, what an alpha
---
You didn't have to mori them. It is worded terribly. You could have hooked all 4 of them and still have completed the challenge.
---
Absolute UNIT
---
What was the map they released with Freddy? But yeah that was more of a "we made a dogshit killer" problem with OG Freddy than it was a map-specific problem.
---
As a survivor main, I think of it as a challenge posed by the game test my skill... yeah, I fail 90% of the time...
---
Aren’t the first five Caucasoid skulls?
---
Are you actually mentaly ill?
---
First time?
---
If someone needs the challnege (and says in their name they need it) ill help them get the challenge but then after im pretty sure they got it I go back to how i normally play
---
If you stop the progress bar between the "E" and "S" of "Escape" the first light won't trigger yet which gives you a headstart. The killer usually can't afford to waste time searching around a gate with no lights triggered.
---
Besides - to actually address the other point, spam-clicking your flashlight was never intended, it's just a consequence of needing to be able to turn your flashlight on and off freely since different flashlights have different blind times and the killer may avoid the flashlight beam causing you to decide to stop wasting your flashlight's charge.
---
Crouching was intended to be used behind obstacles in order to hide from view or dodge hatchets/prevent getting stalked at a loop, with the obvious need to potentially start/stop it rapidly in order to not be M1d at the loop either.
---
As a consequence, teabagging and flashlight clicking are possible, but they were never intended; they're a symptom of other legitimate mechanics.
---
Cleansing is a mechanic unto itself, however, and is fully intended.
---
Yes but he can still be strong, his yellow add on bone Clapper makes him a lot stronger cause there is no directional sound for him. Hes underpowered with no add ons but certain ones make him more mid tier than low tier like he is, some people use him all the way to rank 1 so he is viable hes just one of the weaker killers.
---
That's why I enjoy the slowdown build on her. It means she can make much better decision without everything being "at the cost of a gen." 
---
PGtW + Dying Light really make her snowball, and Thana means people actually become motivated to cleanse because they want to lessen the slow. I know it might not be the most fun from the other side, but it feels so much more like she was intended to play, rather than just 'broken survivor simulator.'
---
While some of your points are valid, I think you're equating fun with winning. I'm terrible at the game, get rekt most of the time but I still have a ton of fun. Working with "non-optimal" perks and seeing what happens can be pretty interesting. I would definitely recommend changing your mindset towards having fun no matter the result!
---
Ok so I just used it and it turned me into hag, cool
---
This game still isn't work. Wtf
---
I believe the game could benefit from this honestly. They could skip releasing 1 of the chapters to focus on delivering health updates such as FPS fixes, bug fixes and more.
---
They could do this easily while still placing one of the "Rift" updates alongside cosmetics to keep the revenue coming in while they fix up the game.
---
I'll be honest if a gen pop in the first 30 seconds, before I can even move a good 20m I'm DCing that game. Putting up with SWF is one thing, sweaty SWF is another.
---
Facts. I'll face camp you like it's my job, oh wait I'm a serial killer it is my job.
---
I've had many matches where killers immediately find survivors, before any generators are even done. 
---
 
---
Glitches are abound right now. Yes, killers have the generator stuck perk. Survivors have the basement glitch (some say it's fixed, others say it isn't), there's the wiggle glitch where survivors being carried don't even have the option to wiggle out or use decisive strike. 
---
 Let's be honest. Most people aren't running several of those second chance perks. It's usually one perk, maybe 2 at most. But most of those perks are to extend a chase by an extremely small amount. They don't suddenly make a survivor best the killer every time. And if we aren't putting dead hard on the list, mettle of man shouldn't be on there either. 
---
 Generator speeds have always been a problem. It's nothing new. But if they made generators take longer to do, they would also need most killer perks that cause gen regression to make up for it. And then we would have killers getting upset that their perks are now getting nerfed.
---
Yeah to make it good, getting rid of the missing shit would definitely improve it a lot, if there needs to be a penalty for missing just use the animation of them stabbing someone but adding an annoyed sound so it's like they're pissed and in a frenzy. Also the cool down after ending the ability shouldn't make my screen pitch black and have them scream dramatically, I don't care if it's a long animation as long as I can see what's happening around me

Needed a chat bubble saying "Pretty good job so far"
---
Yeah, we are still having trouble tonight
---
Is there a reason why they took that out?
---
 But the killer also gets one!
---
I’ve never played as spirit but I have a shit ton of fun playing as ghostface. Having no terror radius with his night shroud is pretty great for sneaking up on survivors, I usually only use his stalking ability near the beginning of the match when survivors don’t know its ghostface and aren’t aware of their surroundings while on a gen. The 0 terror radius makes for great mind games, too. I usually get a 3-4K with him. 10/10 recommend
---
Reading this while OhTofu bitches about survivor queue times. Music to my ears.
---
Survivor mains got what they wanted.
---
I have the same for trapper
---
No thanks, dedicated is a shitshow on pc and everyone on it has said shit about wanting it turned off. I'd rather have 0ms ping as killer
---
They made him faster so I can't complain
---
now this is a meme i can relate to
---
Some of these like "injured after searching a box" or "reduced timer for repairing, and you need two keys" sound like they'd just make Pigs get to tunnel even more, either actually tunnel (you're injured and trapped and have nowhere to go) or just "tunnel" by chasing you off the second box you need over and over.
---
Trapper injures you when you disarm one of his traps with an addon, but you don't have to disarm his traps even if he manages to blocks a generator off with them completely like the one in Myers' basement (you have other generators untrapped), you DO have to take a RBT off your head.
---
I don't think anyone likes that Ghostface gets to move 115% in his Night Shroud, all the other killers have downsides to their movement speed and/or ability to down for being stealthy (Pig while crouching, Myers while EW1, Wraith slowing down to 50% while uncloaking and being unable to attack), but I do agree that Pig is slowed down too much.
---
I feel like if her roar remained intact to some degree (since Myers has a breathing cue) that Pig could actually be moved to 105% move speed while crouching.
---
Admittedly while Ghostface losing his red stain and terror radius without any impact to his movement speed feels too powerful (when you consider he'll just lean behind a tree without hearing you approach and expose you reliably due to reveal angles being difficult when he's leaning since you need to see 'enough' of him, and often just cannot move to the right angle before he exposes you), the other stealth killers are too weak in their stealth states by comparison.
---
I dunno what the answer is, newer killers are getting a lot of power creep, Demogorgon and Oni's powers let them close a ridiculous amount of distance, ridiculously quickly, with high accuracy (and sometimes even anti-loop, since Demogorgon can shred pallets and Oni is more mobile during his dash than Pig is in hers), Ghostface gets perfect stealth with a downside barely relevant to exposing a survivor on a generator since he can approach from outside of LOS. If we're counting Freddy's rework, superb map mobility that good Freddy players can make use of mid-chase, and two generator-slowing addons that they often stack Ruin/Dying Light on top of gives him forever to chase.
---
And then there's Pig/Wraith/Trapper.
---
Alright, BHVR.
---
Yeah no.
---
There's no way to tell if the killer knew about the bug.
---
It's dumb as fuck to punish players for incompetence on the developer side, but at least in the case of double blade Legion they could tell from Data.
---
With the basement bug, there's jack shit. Hooking people in the basement if *normal*. Punishing players for playing normally is *fucking stupid*.
---
Ghostface
---
Jim: Hey Bob, you know how we nerfed the shit out of Legion lately?
---
Bob: Yeah, why?
---
Jim: I have a GREAT idea! Let's get our artists to dump time into making more cosmetics for them! I'm thinking ugly christmas sweaters!
---
Bob: You're a fucking genius, Jim! Cosmetics for a killer no one wants to play! We'll be fucking rich! Rich, I say!
---
Ik this is toxic and shit but run left behind with a key and just hide if you really need to
---
Had some folks do this the other night, I just sat there and ate. It. Up.
---
This......IS MY BOOMSTICK!
---
Nothing says "Gimme more cosmetics" like making them nothing more than a base killer at best
---
Lets be real here, in dead by daylight nerf and rework are synonymous.
---
What.
---
What?
---
# WHAAAATTTT?!?!?!
---
I've never seen an update break a game as much as this one did
---
He's right with his word choice tho. Some killers are kinder than others and allow a survivor who played well escape and them some killers just kill the last survivor. He never expressed a real problem with either.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Same map, same gen.
---
The memes around here never fail to make me laugh. I love em !! hahah
---
noone. i just get tired of hearing it. after every game. in basically every reddit post. survivors bitching when a killer tries to win. like we aren't supposed to have fun too. we just have to sit there and take the teabagging, being looped for 5 gens cuz we didn't take ruin, etc. cuz unless i got no add ons, no perks, no offerings I'm the scum of the game.
---
If the killer couldn't interfere with the survivor while they're searching the box...
---
On the one hand it'd be balanced, the survivor has an RBT ticking down on their head (thus cannot hold the game hostage by cycling the box infinitely to troll) and has to complete the search or die.
---
On the other hand an entire 4-man SWF could abuse this to hold the game hostage together, so it would need a clause that you only get limited "invulnerability to interruptions" once per box per RBT, if you stop searching the box and start again, Pig can down you freely.
---
Than*
---
I'm just glad my boy Bill finally got something other than his default outfit.
---
Same. Especially if I know that I already piped then I'll be nice as long as they were a good sport
---
Sounds like you need to get good.
---
his assumption has no basis unless he believes there to be something wrong with them. a killer taking noed doesn't imply he won't give pity. in a 1v1 during EGC the killer doesn't need noed so that has nothing to do with anything. and a killer walking back to a hook after an unhook doesn't imply anything?
---
that tiny surprised scream killed me
---
For real, Bill deserves it. Plus it's free for everyone which is pretty cool, these all look nice and I'll even buy one for Legion if they ever don't equate to more than killer dog shit
---
its legit in the patch notes under known issues. i swear no one reads the known issues part of the patch notes anymore
---
hiding in lockers might be a possible counter bc he would lose his power if he found you
---
That's the result of bad wording
---
No more passive madness, but a shock that hits everyone in his TR without fail and without needing to aim, when Doctor runs TR perks already?
---
Sounds like a buff, his passive madness very rarely pushed people to tier 2 madness and was basically only useful for the initial scream.
---
I actually like that idea of the closer they are to the person on the hook the more it slows down the hook speed it would give reason for them to go look elsewhere around the map and not stay close to the hook. If they're face camping you it should slow down enough that it gives an extra 3 minutes for you to die in which case the other 3 survivors will have time to do gens and escape.
---
As much as I hate comments like these, he's right. There's a reason survivors are called OP. Learn from YouTube or Twitch to get good
---
I thought RS2 let you see the boxes once the trap was on your head, but not before? They would still see the boxes when it mattered.
---
Downvoted for reading the lore, you nerd! /s
---
The salt and tears of my boosted victims.
---
\*loud moaning\*
---
\*animalistic roaring and grunting\*
---
"um... what are you watching?"
---
Do you want to?
---
Yup!!! I bet now you feel worse about it huh lol
---
“We got to the last generator with all 4 of us still alive” you have to remeber this game is a 4v1 not a 1v1 you were probably the only kill he got amd even if you werent you guys already burned through all the pallets on the map. Why should you be able to counter him 1 on 1 out in the open with no pallets around?
---
prob by accident, but god does it suck
---
it isn't hard at all, but people will downvote you just because they blindly love this game.
---
Claudette
---
Yes they are, they say some really stupid shit on this sub.
---
Here's the build that I beat it with.  However, I have every survivor perk, so let me know if you don't have a perk and I can try to suggest another build.
---
spine chill , sprint burst, fixated, vigil
---
you could try these other stealth perks
---
lithe + quick and quiet 
---
head on + quick and quiet 
---
urban evasion
---
kindred (the buff makes it a really solid perk for stealth)
---
distortion
---
alert
---
empathy (you can get a pretty decent idea where the killer is by seeing your hurt team mates)  If you're playing stealth you may also want to be more supportive in games to allow your team mates to carry you better.
---
Perks to avoid, that seem like they would be good
---
iron will (meta perk, however, you probably want to avoid taking any damage at all, so I'd recommend against it for this challenge)
---
dead hard (same reason)
---
borrowed time (avoid saves at all costs)
---
diversion (requires you be within the terror radius of the killer and generally not useful against stealth killers)
---
calm spirit (It's too niche to be useful)
---
Getting injured by a box you have to search in order to avoid dying to the RBT is going to be tunnel-city no matter what, particularly when it can happen 4 times in a row and you're on a timer.
---
The screams of survivors as I mori lock them repeatedly until they DC. That's what keeps me motivated
---
I just hope BHVR will see this post by some miracle
---
Nope, he went straid for the hook
---
*After EGC?* This is a body block for &lt; min that secures a kill. It's not holding the game hostage.
---
What sucks is i can see both sides of this (I'm actually for fixing the gates and I'm mostly a killer main).
---
Killer side: It sucks that this game will even punish flawless gameplay for killer's. It takes a giant amount of effort to put pressure, end chases quickly, ect to catch survivors in red ranks. At the end point you've basically went through nam to secure your 3k.
---
But now the game still isn't over! Since even if you play extremely well and have no gens finished, the last surv gets to go for hatch and get a chance at the exit gates. This can be a giant source of frustration cause even after playing all your cards right you have the hatch being basically rng and even if you beat them after all that if the gates spawn at opposite ends you are f'd with most killers and perks without information or mobility (Even with great mobility with killers like hillbilly you can get screwed over by maps like Hawkins that don't allow you to zoom end to end or giant maps where by the time you reach the other gate it's already open). You basically just have to quit at this point and all your hard work is forfeit. (Specially since you depip or only safety pip a lot of the time with 3k even though the developers said their goal was to have an average of only 2k per match)
---
Survivor side: It sucks that you have overcome the trials and tribulations of being at the mercy of your team unless you specifically go swf. Praying you get matched with capable teammates. Then you go to find out they can't loop for anything and fail to repair gens. You've played extremely well but because your efforts are only 1/4th of the equation and your team falls flat you are basically screwed. Every gen and loop was hardly earned in outsmarting the killer but there is no way to get the all before the end. There is good news however! You get a chance at the hatch it's a long shot and rng but at this point it gives you a chance to keep your items and to be rewarded for your good gameplay. But Lo and behold the killer finds it before you... No worries, you'll just go for the exit gates! Only to see they are extremely close and the killer is between them going back and forth... You basically just have to quit at this point and all your hard work is forfeit.
---
What I take out of this: It's a very impossible job to balance this game for both sides since it's symmetrical you have to choose which side you want to prefer to have chance.
---
If you make it so even hard playing survs can win even though their contributions are split between 3 other survs by giving them an long shot end escape. You have a chance to screw over the killers who have to fight tooth and nail for a win only for them to get robbed of 1/4th of their whole entire reward at the end cause of the hatch or gates who spawn at opposite ends. But if you don't put in such option then survs are at the mercy of their entire teams even if they are god tier. This would leave no incentive to even try to escape once your team shows they are incompetent.
---
Not to mention there is no "middle ground" gate distance either the killer can patrol both or they can't.
---
Accept it and move on? Not every killer is gonna have a mori. People play how they want its shitty but it happens
---
Isnt that bannable now?
---
Do I want to what?
---
Could you guys fix the nat error that comes up every time i try to search for a game. Makes the game unplayable
---
Think it's fair when the Devs tweeted last year that they were gonna do something about console optimisation then it never appeared even in following patches I don't think there's been really any optimisation for the game at all for console. It being a PC focused game means nothing, if it was released on console and designed to be played on console it should function as closely to how it's intended to work on PC because people pay for the same experience.
---
Tonight they have lolololol. Everyone that I've played but 1. I still stand by them being nerfed till the 3rd hook,  idc. Them hitting us a extra time is to hard,  well us being killed before our 3rd hook is unfair.
---
Which is why I also suggested the Hemorrhage Status, because technically after leaving a Macabre Box your wrists should be bloody/cut up. 
---
It’s just boring that we have a full Saw-Trap and all you do with it is M1 with normal skillchecks
---
Had a similar thing happen the other day were , a rank 10 killer went up against three rank 4’s and 1 rank 7.
---
Hope they somehow fix this issue soon because it isn’t fun to play against people who are so much better than yourself.
---
I don't know why it wouldn't be honestly.
---
Lol. Not even a guy,  but cool story bro. Sorry I have a different opinion than you.
---
Someone isn't popluar with the ladies.
---
I just love challenges. 4k at red ranks with my gf and no addons and meme perks feels rewarding. And dont forget about the salt after match, especially when u destroyed them.
---
Yeah, but that's a lie, I was getting rank 2s and I'm rank 9-10, that's a difference of 7 or 8, not 6.
---
It's also not using the rank of the highest in an SWF, so when I end up with a rank 1 and a rank 20, they don't face a rank 1 killer, they face my rank 10 ass and I can only catch the rank 20 and I stomp them into the ground, not knowing they're new, just assuming they're bad but needing a kill since it's one less person holding M1.
---
I did it with better together (so other survivors know which gen I'm working on), prove thyself (faster gen repair speed), spine chill, and your other choice of a perk. You need to repair gens to escape so this build helped the entire team to work on generators.
---
Whispers work wonders.
---
Yeah, I feel you.
---
Overall I'm actually close to almost never disrespecting killers in-game. Or players in general. At least not on purpose. But what I experience way too often in my opinion, is being downed after a minutes long chase and the killer is just standing right next to my downed body, nodding on me like: "Ha Ha, now I gotcha!" *continues nodding, might swing his weapon a few times*
---
And I'm there like.. "Bud, just put me on the hook or mori me, whatever your plan is, but don't waste my and your time."
---
I'm not being triggered by those actions. I'm just not getting the point. Just end it quickly. Same goes for survivors that just keep waiting in the exit gates for no reason.
---
They heal up? Fine. They're making sure all are safe? Totally understand that.
---
But all the remaining/4 survivors are camping the exit gate? Please just get the frick out.
---
Because it defeats the purpose of them all together. They wouldn’t be worth the red rarity then, at that point you should just get the option to Mori people every match without an add on for the final hook
---
I'm convidenced BVHR throws dart at a board at this point.
---
Honestly, I cleanse myself and run. Screw those other guys, I’m not playing No Mither
---
Right now 5 for both killer and survivor. I deranked from 3 in killer over the course of 2 nights hence why im a little upset. Uh i could give you screen shots if you really want them tomorrow but idk of anyone that lies about being purple rank.
---
Eh, it's boring to get a guaranteed win.
---
 I'd rather have *some* possibility of the guy getting away than just sitting on a hill between two gates and just spinning around till EGC kills them.
---
He's pretty balanced on my part. Every oni I versed was pretty easy to counter. Be wary of your blood, dont leave scratch when he's in mode, try to prolong the first chase as long as possible cause once everyone's injured he's gone have his power on the regular, use of tight corners also lockers too.
---
LOL
---
Eh id say its still worth. Gives you a cinematic ending and still gives you advantage as you get to bypass ds and body blocks for the 3rd hook
---
How would it tell the difference between hook suicide and trying to get off the hook, failing, and slipping during the struggle phase?
---
And ruin1 for pussies.
---
I'd be down to just fucking delete billy's maps. Fuck corn.
---
Well it doesn’t give you an advantage because you lose out on a lot of points, especially if you use it immediately after the first hook. That’s kinda the trade off for them
---
Then at LEAST the 2nd hook,  so people have a chance or a timer so that they cannot camp and kill someone 2 minutes into the match. Idc what anyone says it's unfair,  and should he changed. Killers can bitch about ANY perk surviviors have,  toolboxes,  medkits,  gen speed,  and all but let us say fucking moris are unfair and y'all bring a pitchfork. Insta heals were a RED rare offering that got nerfed to become pointless. Sooo.
---
Good.
---
Yea but your cutting the game short its kind of like keys for survivors.
---
Shush squeaky pallet stun.
---
"mid tier"
---
NOED benefits any killer that doesn't have a one-hit down as part of their kit if the game reaches the end, the speed boost a survivor gets when injured combined with the killer post-hit animation makes it difficult (40 seconds if you're 115% - and Spirit is 110% unless phasing, but even the default phasing duration doesn't cut the time down enough) to catch back up to the survivor before another survivor opens an exit gate.
---
\+ There's a NOED challenge in Tome 3, by this logic the survivors shouldn't run flashlights against Legion because you can run him without one, even when you're doing "blind the killer".
---
I agree.
---
I was playing in the Sanctum of Wrath (ewww) earlier and I hooked a survivor after two minutes. Then all 4 survivors disconnected on me. Then I couldnt join any lobby for 40 minutes then i called quits.
---
No he does not smashed through college and instantly, takes him the same time as any other killer you moron.
---
Then why do they all do it? To be toxic, so obviously it's not needed since it loses points.
---
Killer is more stressful than survivor, but the stats show very clearly that killers are at an advantage.  Despite all the second chances that they get, and there are quite a few, the escape rate for survivors playing against red rank killers is about 1 in 4 games. 
---
You've obviously put in time in learning how to master the killer, but some of the people that you play against have thousands of hours of practice.  As far as answering your question, my motivation is self improvement and when I get crushed reminding myself that they have just as much right to get 4 survivor escapes as I am to a 4k.
---
Never played League. Don't really watch streams. I don't know who any of those guys you mentioned are, but I know who Tyler1 is.
---
If the EGC timer is up when you hook someone, it will block gates.
---
I admire your determination at least, but if you punish people for things without knowing context and hurt innocent people, know that it will bite you in the ass.
---
After gates are opened (end game collapse has started) hook a surv to block off the exit gate for 60 seconds. What are you confused about?
---
Did anyone react or were there just blank stares?
---
That a jaws poster above your monitor?
---
You have to do way more as a survivor to get hatch,  than you do to mori. That's not comparable to me. Mori oh, I hooked you, instantly slap you and kill you. Key, do the set amount of gens,  find and locate hatch without being found and escape. Or if your team gets slaughter and the killer stomps it,  you can reopen it. Half of the times it isn't worth bringing a key because it usually get you camped/tunneled and maybe even mori'd especially If someone else brings a map.
---
Is it me or is it really buggy? I feel like I Have to hold my camera in the direction for a couple seconds before it pings, because sweeping my camera doesn't work.
---
Insta heals were nerfed because there was zero skill involved whereas with mori you still have to catch people for it to work. I agree it isn’t the most balanced thing in the game but news flash, nothing in this game is balanced
---
Survivor? My dude, he'd be a killer
---
I would gladly put them in The basement 
---
,,You get what ya fucking deserve"
---
I appreciate you responding bro. Please do me 1 favor though. Dont quote those bhvr statistics they dont mean anything and bhvr even came out themselves saying they dont mean anything. I know you have ill intentions but i just die a little inside everytime someone brings up those stats because im a big data analysis nerd.
---
I feel like understanding that some people are actually mediocre at certain killers (I like Spirit, but I'm not very good at her, and I'm pretty trash at Nurse) that otherwise top the tier lists is probably as important as understanding (not that I always do when tilted) that not all survivors run infinites or pseudo-infinites optimally or that not all 4-man SWF will escape in 2 minutes (even though if they ran the appropriate perks and toolboxes, they actually could if you run the calculation).
---
On the other hand, balance is pretty whack, splitting up because you spawned in different locations and casually holding M1 on four different generators (even if Ruin is up and you can't hit greats) is far more effective than casually playing Wraith or Pig, Wraith and Pig struggle a lot after the first hit and lose too much pressure if they commit to a chase.
---
Most survivors will open exit gates but still stick around in the match to make sure everyone gets out. Very few survivors run out of a match right away unless they’re doing a daily or have a good item or something. 
---
The idea is to down someone who was maybe careless and not at the gates yet while the others are waiting and hook him/her to trap the others, since most survivors will likely stay to try and save, especially if most of the team is alive.
---
Moral of the story, killers don’t be toxic but here SWF with your 30 second flashlights and new wiggle free perk, be toxic all you want
---
A lot of the time survivors (including me) linger around to make sure everyone makes it out to body block etc, if a teammate happens to go down my first instinct is to go for the unhook with BT.  You can capitalize on survivors doing just that and maybe snag another down, or more if you run a perk that has good synergy with Blood Warden such as NOED.
---
Legion’s design from day 1 to me seems to be that they’re the killer that supposed to be REALLY hard to get away from. They punish pallet looping by jumping over them, they punish locker jukes with iron maiden, they punish body blocking with Mad Grit.
---
Their problem is that their issues were over corrected and they’re just terrible now
---
Getting far enough a head in a chase to use the med kit could be comparable to being able to slap someone as a one shot. Imo.
---
Fuck. If thats how you feel. I cant change minds out here.
---
Honestly I think it's my favourite of the sweaters
---
I think what op meant is that when the gamesl is so full of toxic/completely useless players, op prefer to reward the good sports for being that, so that they don't start playing toxic
---
NOT BUBBA BOI NO
---
Yeah that’s dumb asf
---
Your English is fine comrade.
---
The ‘Ruin was inside us all along’ version of the perk. A rare clip indeed,
---
Stats a part of a larger picture, but they are hard numbers.  Just because they don't match your skewed world view is not a reason that I can't bring them up in a discussion.  
---
You seem a bit like a snowflake.  I can see that you're not worth having a discussion with.
---
Yeah you get 25K blood points for doing the survivor tutorial and another 25K blood points for doing the killer tutorial
---
I only play with ONE other person,  I've yet to see anyone use that perk yet and you have counters such as iron grasp and mad grit for that. Also,  how are those things considered toxic? I think being team oriented is different than camping someone and killing them 2 minutes into the game. Killers bitch about gen speed and how it makes a game go to quick,  blah blah blah. But act like we are horrible if we get upset over getting killed 2 mins into ours.
---
thanks
---
Well no shit people are going to apologize, people are pretty much conditioned to feel bad for using "toxic strats/perks" because survivors have complained about it for ages.
---
K
---
Yui yellow pants really made me laugh. When i bought this game i expected skin such as ghillie suit and stuff to hide from the killer, instead we receive glowy skin.
---
So what your saying is survivors are allowed to focus on their main goal of being a team and doing gens but killers can’t focus on their job which is KILLING. Got it
---
Fine man but if you take those stats at face value to say all killers are overperforming you have to also believe that bubba is better than nurse. So fucking go ahead dude
---
*God I hate that I fucking hear this...*
---
Oni is powerful for sure, however, the best way to learn how to play against a killer is to learn to play that killer.  Have you played the Oni yet?
---
*Swinging sword sounds*
---
It's not just how I feel it is what I have experienced in the game as well. I play killer as well, but it's rare because I enjoy playing with my friend more and I feel stressed. Not gonna lie lol. Have a mori'd people? Yes. Off their first hook? No. Because it's bullshit. Do you bitch about gen speed being to fast? If so,  you cannot be mad someone hates there game being ended in two mins over being insta killed. Imo.
---
But everyone does not have the skill to reach higher ranks, everyone are able to unhook two survivors after the endgame collapse starts but not everyone can play generally well enough to climb the ranks, see where i’m going?
---
I NEVER once said the killer cannot kill us lolololol. Y'all LOVE that line. I just want moris changed since they have NO counter.
---
I usually just cleanse after I pop a generator, before Thanatophobia hits full stacks, and given that you already have it partially completed, the Thana stack or two she gets is a perk running at partial power, only partially through a generator.
---
If there is one thing that seems OP about Plague, it's her addons that increase your rate of infection and/or make vomiting reveal you, there's nothing quite as frustrating as her being able to instantly down by hitting you with a partial stream of vomit and then instantly left-click since you break immediately.
---
Then again I suppose rarer combinations of addons being frustrating to play against is true for all killers.
---
Pop only bothers me when I'm the only one survivor repairing, but it does synergize very well once she gets her Dying Light stacks, though multiple slowdown perks are never fun either... Admittedly I do run Dying Light and either Ruin or Pop on killers as well, so I'm not one to talk.
---
Context is important.  Across all platforms, PC + Console + Mobile the Bubba is better than the Nurse.  And yes there's hard evidence to support that.  However, the devs have stated that for PC the nurse's numbers are much higher, but those stats weren't released.
---
What's your point?
---
But killing is doing their only goal. You’re mad at a mechanic that helps killers but said doing mechanics that help survivors do their goal isn’t toxic. Like what?
---
Nevermind dude have a nice night. Still appreciate you responding
---
This is his kanabo works.
---
Wack
---
I main killer. So many immersed Claudettes since the update because of how much grass the new map has.
---
One thing you can do to give yourself a fighting chance is to open an exit gate till just before the first light turns on so the killer doesn't know you were there. When they turn around after checking the gate you now have a reduced time to open. Doesn't work if the bloody gates are withing sight of each other though.
---
My issue with matchmaking is the fact that I keep going up against players with double, and even triple my playtime, which is incredibly unfair and completely ruins killer matches for me as I just get gen rushed.
---
Do you play survivior? It's damn near impossible to wiggle free. Lol. We have a new perk that could help,  but now seeing the uproar just wait it'll be nerfed. I believe killers are supposed to stomp gens,  be in chases,  apply map pressure and so on. Mori'ing someone off their FIRST hook completely kills the game for them,  that's what is bullshit. It's as bad as face camping if not worse,  because we can counter with borrowed time or DS. Against a mori we have NO counter,  as I said all those things you're mentioning have counters.
---
Yeah I've been having that exact same issue on PS4. It's insanely annoying and I really hope it's the first bug they fix.
---
Groovy

I played a game as Ghostface on the new map and after four gens were done and two survivors were dead Ruin was somehow still up so I went to have a look at where it was and I can’t believe how bullshit one of the possible spawn points on this new map is.
---
It’s like the reverse of that Asylum one where it’s just sitting by itself in the open with nothing around it
---
any ghostface that must resort to NOED already lost. Like whats the point? You have a built in insta down!
---
I'd rather wait
---
Don't think this is a great idea, not only does it make challenges harder than they already are but it requires even more playtime to do.
---
True, but even this can be frustrating, I usually intercept the unhooker if I can and hit them once, then hit them again, but sometimes the hit gets "eaten" by the hooked survivor (even once the animation LOOKS finished) even though the unhooking survivor is closer to my weapon and me and the hooked survivor is on the other side, especially when they run around to use the hook as a shield, but I also run around and follow them and my weapon decides to veer sideways for some reason.
---
Defending against hook rushers can be annoying.
---
What's tap tap?
---
that nancy frozen still whispering "im sorry brother" before bolting off
---
Murder.
---
Glad I’m not the only one.
---
dude if the game isn’t fun for you anymore don’t play? sounds like you’re taking this all just a little too seriously.
---
Yea
---
If you have a different opinion you should speak and tell everyone what you think. 
---
Be constructive!
---
Again, Learn from YouTube or twitch videos. You can easily loop him. It lasts barely anytime at all
---
At this point I'm just happy Doctor even gets acknowledged to be in the game, I mean he didn't even get touched since the Doctor cube after release and the last meaningful change was that "snap out of it" no longer counts as healing. If they improve anything about him I might be motivated to main him again.
---
Two days ago, I had a Meg and Claudette just crouch around map. They complained because I killed myself when they let me go struggle (rando was in a chase). No UE btw :')
---
Maybe youre right man
---
Do you mean they can’t be LOs and within a set distance at the same time or they can’t be LOS full stop? Cause if it’s the latter I have a clip that throughly disproves that unless it was a bug
---
THEY WHAT
---
You just listed borrowed time which is also a counter to mori lol. And yes recently I’ve been playing more survivor than killer and my opinion still remains. I’ve literally never once gotten mori’d minutes into the game. But I also can loop and not just mindlessly run and when I am morid, I just shrug it off cuz it means I can start a new good sooner
---
Pretty good job so far
---
360 into d/c
---
When oni is in demon mode hes stupidly easy to loop, no need for a pallet.
---
Cool Oni skin
---
I cannot make other people run BT so it isn't always a counter lol. You can still be tunneled down. I actually am good at looping and running the killed as well,  I'm not ass at the game I'm rank 3. I have to wait for a match and only have limited time,  so sorry tonight getting 5 minute IF that matches pisses me off. But cool that you never get annoyed,  talk to me more when it happens to you 4 times in a row.
---
I hate Shrek.
---
I don't know why, but he fills me with rage.
---
Honestly tho. Figures crossed for a cosmetic
---
When they first released moris didn't require a hook at all. So as far as a nerf goes they already had a good one. Also when a killer uses them not only do they lose out on Bloodpoints but also emblem points. Only real reason to use them is to take out problem people like a Blendette that you know you'll never find again if she gets away or when you go to pick up a survivor and get swarmed with flashlights. 
---
Personally I think they should be removed as offerings and put in-game as aggro-system. Dropping pallets on the killer, blinding them or teabagging should add to the meter and once full it allows a Mori. That way its strategic on who you use it on, its not something most players would encounter.
---
It could be something like 15% pallet stun, 20% blind, 1% per crouch while in a chase.  Think that would be fair as long as they remove the hook requirement to balance it.
---
I don't know, just the best way to get it to work I guess. Trying to use it with n o e d for the challenge. Tried keeping two survivors alive and let him know I'm finished Jen but they escaped too easy. Guess it would be better to let all four make it to end and open the gate myself and then try and hook somebody.
---
Crows be out here vibin
---
Pretty as fuck and the best legion cosmetics but the real question is what knife are you completing the cosplay with?
---
imagine ragequitting when you fail to hook some1 that gets sandbagged
---
I'm afraid they don't mean the word "my" in the way that you describe it. There are actually some people arrogant enough to think that nobody else could come up with the same build as they did. They really want to say it's their creation. While, when you use your machine at work, you don't mean that it's your creation of course.
---
I want to keep arguing with you, but clearly someone has to end this conversation else well keep fighting and I’m too tired to have a Socratic debate at 2 in the morning. I respect that you’re entitled to your own opinion even though I disagree with it. Goodnight.
---
I'm pretty sure girls prefer guys with better education but that's just imo
---
Dont ever say "be kind" when posting pics on the internet. Youre opening yourself to a roast
---
That's what I was thinking but what else.
---
I dont know if hes super op. But IMO I think his tracking ability/add ons are WAY too powerful. If he hits you it doesnt really matter if you find a way to escape because all hes gotta do is look for the bright shiny red orbs that are flying out of you. Especially with that ultra add on. Its stupid. Maybe he could only see the orbs when hes close to them? Was hiding with iron will on a corner. My blood FLEW out of me. Into the open giving away my position. I should "get good" too but these just arent mechanics i think are fun to play against. Remember, just an opinion
---
Fire up works too
---
Letting survivors go for being a good sport. Does that make you a good killer or a bad one?
---
It does but he was taking me to the hook with no intention to drop me, as he continued to chase me afterwards. Also there have been videos on the sub showing people struggling out at 50%, this bug is one of the more ambiguous ones but I think it should be noted at the very least.
---
Im getting stuck nearly every game as killer, regardless of map
---
*i may be bad guy, but that does not mean i am BAD guy*
---
I think that’s when the killer DCed
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6vd29/hag_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
yeah the killer DCed, this game was an entire mess
---
Thanks I’ll check him out
---
ZULUL
---
I mean at this point legions nerf are starting to get up there.
---
Buy ghost face. Spirit can be bought with shards while gf cant. Spirit is overall stronger than ghostface though.
---
nah I think she jus panicked, she was on death hook and had been camped for a while on the ground. annoying, yes, but I can’t be too angry for her panicking
---
In the tierlist, so far I'd put him in A, maybe B if you're using thrash perks and addon
---
FOOLS! YOUR COCKINESS ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER!
---
Anything with "Optimal" in the title. Anything with "BEST BUILD" in the title. I love the guy, I do. But jesus christ he is the clickbait master of DBD. In some of his videos I would leave in the comments suggestions for titles. An sometimes I outright mock him hoping he'd catch on to his limited vocab.
---
Tru3ta1ent: "Hello kids! Today's special word is "Optimal!" Thanks again for all the bits!"
---
Love ya Tru3 &lt;3
---
wtf are those teleport hacks?
---
I am saying a 4k hours main of a potato would be able to win consistently - its about average player not the best of the best
---
Just happened to me today. I hook a claud and then down a meg1 immediately afterward. I pick up the meg and as soon as I do another meg2 goes for the unhook. I walk back with meg1 and hit the claud again that just got unhooked. Claud goes down. I then hook meg1. I tell myself “fuck it I’ll eat the clauds DS.” She DSs me and INSTEAD IF RUNNING AWAY CLAUD UNHOOKS THE MEG INFRONT OF MY FACE. I down the Claud again and hook her and then I go back to looking at gens. 
---
The survivors at the end had the audacity to call me a tunneler... they said “the claud DSd you you obviously tunneled.” LMAO the DS is to get away from me not unhook the Meg infront of my eyes and you expect me to go for the Meg that obviously now has BT? Lol give me a break survivors. I also only got one kill the whole game. I’m sick of discord chat circle jerks against the killer. Yikes.
---
&gt; bug that you shouldn't abuse
---
I mean, how can I abuse a bug? It's not like it's repeatable by design, I don't choose where to spawn.
---
I know right. That's why I fell in love with AC Odyssey and Origin. Great take on ancient times.
---
How many times did he say the word "Optimal" in that video? I swear to god thanks to him I fucking hear that word in my sleep.
---
M’lady
---
I will say this what I say to anyone that dislikes the insta heal nerf or tries to compare it too insta down addons.  
---
1. and only one point needs to be main insta heals take fuck all in skill to use unless clicking 2 buttons is a skill  
---
2. Insta downs should be removed but insta heals where dumber.  
---
If you get tunneled realize 1. solo queuing survivor is ass and 2. get DS and unbreakable.
---
Shock was never hard to hit in the first place so thats irrelevant. Now you have to actively use the power and maybe someone will scream if in your TR and you can hopefully they're close as you've basically told the survivor to book it. This also makes the calm addon and distressing perk less appealing as a larger TR means more distance to get to them. 
---
Shock isnt meant for long range its meant to close the gap between a survivor or stop a vault/pallet. From what i understand both passive shock and stun shock are combined into a less effective spammy attack that will reveal locations (possibly on a cooldown) but wont be as effective in stopping loops.
---
To save killers time of course. He already managed to kill all your friends, and you thought it would be fair his reward for that would be him just be stand still for 1,30 minutes waiting for you to die? I think they might  probably do a perk for it though. If a dumb survivor want to take a perk slot for the 4% I'd be OK lol
---
Doc with Clam and Order does not suck, lol.
---
Oni has corny effects,this game is going downhill since Demigorgon
---
Its called dumb fucks....there is plenty of them in the US now...the world for that matter...wasnt too bad a decade ago and now they have infested the world with their stupidity.
---
IRC even if you can only technically see a pixel of a hex from your spawnpoint that's fine as it is based on hitbox checks more than anything meaning if it spawns behind a small piece of junk slightly off in the distance it will still count for the general guidelines.
---
Secondly, there is nothing it disprove as this is literally what the devs have said the reqs are for hex spawns after changing a bunch of them.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Oh wait it doesn’t seem like your joking.
---
#A B S O R B
---
since a licensed killer what? Demogorgon brought some more popularity and is okay as a killer. Oni corny effects? the OP is literally about the most corniest "monster" made up at least Oni feels like a fucking ogre with a hammer to crush people
---
he thinks brutal strength and bamboozle on huntress is her most optimal builds. I know he's really good at the game, and he understands a great deal about it but some things he's blatantly wrong about, and he's not spitting harsh facts. Wraith is not in the top 4 killers, spirit was uncounterable and deserved a nerf, and oni is not an average killer.
---
so you're saying we should overbuff certain killers because people cant be bothered to git gud?
---
You only see the box auras when the trap is triggered. So until then you just fix a gen since you don't know where to go anyway.
---
I've played many fun games where I lose. What isn't fun is looking for someone, and 20-30 seconds into the match, 2 gens popping, then finding someone, having them sprint away, and another one click a flashlight in your face, and then a third pops....
---
No matter how good or bad you are at this game you WILL eat a Legion of salt. Shit, tonight I went against a sweaty 4 man as Leatherface, they gen rushed me but at end game I got the nancy down and camped her ass and all 3 of her buddies ran face first into my chainsaw thinking somehow their ego's would survive the insta down. I was then called a camper and threatened with reports because.......they chose to dive a fully charged leatherface?
---
Average - not a 4k hours nolife
---
Bruh...
---
maul and savage vs palpatine was definitely the best fight in the clone wars. so hyped for the new season.
---
MYC is considered "mandatory" by many since it's such a good universal perk that just outclasses so many others.
---
I think I remember that, but I don't remember them saying that they're coming after Doctor. Honestly I hope you're wrong. LOL
---
I've been playing since the game launched.
---
They prefer nice cars and money actually. Any random stupidass with those 2 would fit the bill. I'm sure you've watched the news and talk shows enough to see how canon that shit is.
---
Someone’s gotta do it
---
So remove all game mechanics making the most boring game ever?
---
No they have changed matchmaking since September despite not posting about it. This is outdated information. BHVR regularly change their matchmaking system with informing their users. Sometimes it's great, sometimes it's crap
---
WTF, what video does he say that about Huntress? I gotta see this.
---
incorrect Host killers have nothing to do with ur connection unless you are on console in which case it has been having problems without P2P so yea.   
---
As for having only fun without being toxic killer, I assume playing a high tier killer with their best addons and perks I say this, I very much enjoy Trapper only time I see killers being toxic is when they overly care about winning for me it is all about just snapping traps.  
---
Take a break, if the game is only pissing you off then go play a game you like until you calmed down
---
Pallets arent unbalanced, some maps have stupid rng or setups but pallets arent an issue
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
What would you suggest as opposed to the 2 keys idea to make searching the boxes more reliable?
---
It's perfect for P3 Blendettes
---
Being looped for 5 gens? If you're still looping the same person for 2 then you have been duped. Why chase one person that long? You lose all map pressure. Being looped for 5 gens because you've chosen not to go back to patrolling and looking for people on gens is probably why your games aren't going so well.
---
I'm not trying to be mean, I just know as a survivor main that if a killer has wasted all of his time on one survivor I know I'm definitely escaping.
---
Haha, imagine taking five minutes to gain ten feet on someone you're chasing.
---
Kindred
---
I mean it is not bad just depends on your play style.   
---
I hold shift 100% of my games so I have no use for the perk
---
Not going to touch the main topic of this because every game has bugs so I don't see a point in doing it but cosmetics are made by an art team, not the people fixing bugs. They are not losing any development progress towards bug fixes or gameplay changes by creating cosmetics as the team that handles bugs doesn't touch cosmetics and vise-versa.
---
I’ve been playing PS4 and haven’t really had a problem finding matches. Though like 80% of them have been oni
---
Legit happened to me three times today only because i ran quick and quiet as the quentin was being chased
---
i was exaggerating the 5 gens part. my games are going very well actually. I'm really new to the game(about 60ish hours) and made it to rank 8. i just get tired of survivors thinking I'm not allowed to have fun and have to play suboptimally or bring suboptimal cuz my fun doesn't matter but they can bring the best perks, play as optimally as possible cuz they find it fun to teabag in the exit gate rather than just leave
---
I dont know why but this creeps me out.
---
Well you getting coal this Christmas .
---
You can also stalk a lot of positions from the center of the map, huge elevation, it's like the asylum building with windows all the way 'round.
---
I think trapper can benefit too.
---
Those cosmetics have a bad juju connected to them, you were lucky to have a guardian angel (I’m guessing jake)
---
Great reddit name
---
‘Proceeds to be unhooked in front of killer without borrowed time’
---
That’s exactly my experience, and I don’t really play this game a lot with friends so it would be very beneficial to me
---
How to tell if a survivor is Toxic
---
ok, i dont agree with OP. but this comment is so dumb.
---
It doesn't seems to be working than!
---
nope it is fine for me
---
How so?
---
All he said was that if they have NOED or head back to the hook after every unhook that they probably aren't the generous type who would let someone go at the end. You have a serious victim complex if you took that as them bitching about killers trying to win, having fun, and that they're the scum of the game.
---
Hmm, you're right that SWF could abuse the invulnerability.  This is trickier than it looks.
---
I think removing the RBT when downed is a bit too much. It would probably be more balanced if they went with the 2 key idea and making downing a trapped survivor removing one of the locks as suggested. Then if they already got one key the trap would get removed.
---
Literally nothing, they Made vaulting and sprinting faster at the cost of decreased mend time(10s down to 8s).
---
On hit effects no longer apply to feral frenzy.
---
They changed deep wound in general so that it is no longer coupled with the terror radius, preventing nemesis and beast of prey from completely breaking legion and also making borrowed time a bit more viable vs stealth killers and Freddy who can suppress their terror radius.
---
In a nutshell: sloppy doesn't work but has never been useful with legion anyway.
---
Hex: third seal doesn't work but was at least more useful than sloppy.
---
Noed never worked to begin with and stbfl is now like it is for other killers, gain stacks slower but lose less when hitting you obsession with your power first and m1 afterwards.
---
A viable build might be:
---
Enduring
---
Spirit Fury
---
+2 slowdown perks(thanatophobia/dying light, ruin) or 1 slowdown perk and one Aura Reading perk(discordance, barbecue)
---
A fun build might be:
---
Fire Up
---
Thanatophobia
---
Discordance
---
Claudio is the best!
---
And then there's sandbagging, teabagging, Mori spamming and unhook spamming to make survivors scream. I get this all the time.
---
That's because a lot of its users adopt a largely useless playstyle and use it to immerse around the map.  It can be used intelligently but all the game throwing Urban immersion players give the perk a bad name.
---
Lol

hmm, interesting.. so a pig main says that pig doesnt need buffs, but what so you're saying is we should overbuff certain killers because people cant be bothered to git gud?
---
Yes! And I think the killer came into the room... and it was a Myers? I can’t remember. I just remember it was funny
---
Damn, what do you think is the point of Reddit?
---
Where can you find the stats?
---
it's something 
---
i make this because a guy opens the gates and just stay in there watching me die
---
No, it's just you. Sorry. Maybe reinstall?
---
Not being Instagram
---
Same with my Billy but mine doesn't have noed on cos you know....chainsaw lol xD
---
Yeah, I like the crude simplicity of if. Only thing that’s distracting is the ruled paper
---
The body guard achievement is "In public matches, take a protection hit while the Killer is carrying a Survivor, 30 times." One of the new achievement is came with the Cursed Legacy chapter.
---
I enjoy downing multiple over altruistic SWF, Bubba rules!
---
I agree with the other comments. Plus oni looks cool and has awesome sound effects and music and billy is some ugly dude that sounds like a cow when pallet stunned.
---
He's so easy to loop in while using blood fury, he has a hard time cutting tight corners while demon dashing. He has instadown lol michael has it too and he can down multiple survivors is he op too?  You're probaly just a survivor main not knowing how to play against a new killer. Please investigate further before you start crying on reddit
---
Unsure about others but I can give my personal experience. I don't care about the one hit down because its no different from facing Myers or plague (never cleanse). Its the speed boost I hate, I think it should be removed. I'll put it this way, if me and my friends see that the killer is getting looped easily and is whiffing a lot then more often then not they have noed. We go cleanse the totems and more times then not that hunch is correct. I've come to associate noed as a "someone is learning this killer" perk. Take that as you will.
---
Hope we get a rick and morty chapter  lol but lore wise  i dont think it will work
---
I agree they should be removed as offerings, but rewarding killers with moris because survivors used pallets and items to survive, which is literally their primary objective, is absurd. Crouching is not toxic. Flashlights are not toxic. Dropping pallets is not toxic. Teabagging is annoying but to measure that by crouches is ridiculous, imagine getting “punished” for teabagging a huntress because you were crouching behind debris while looping. Pallets are 1 of the main tools for survivors to use to survive in chases, why would they be punished for using them? You can already mindgame a lot of them, or bring spirit fury/enduring and make pallets much less valuable. This “rework” makes moris absolutely broken and I honestly wouldn’t play the game anymore.
---
I haven't, but I'm pretty sure this system has been in place on PC for a while now... I'm looking forward to it. 
---
The way I understand it is the ability to match make is delayed after a DC. The more someone offends, the longer the timer to start a new game. 
---
Therefore, being a little kid and rage quitting might minimize the effect on rank, but at the cost of being able to play several games in succession.
---
Personally when I use it, which isnt often these days, I use it to maneuver small walls when killer is near. I never just crouch the whole map. I hate when people do that lol
---
You could try being an adult and ignoring the childish people who are toxic instead of being toxic yourself while blaming other people for it. Crazy idea I know.
---
I’ve yet to try spirit , how was it ???
---
I've never seen someone complain people use them. only that they are broken. thats the difference. killers complain things are broken, but don't bitch about people using them. killers get it you wana win by any means they just wish it wasn't broken. survivors don't like something about your build or playstyle and instead of hating the fact the perks or playstyle is viable. they hate the killers that use it to try to win
---
How was it?
---
Absolute legends
---
ehh. thats not as fun
---
I fell you there. That's part of the reason I think it's so under rated. It's amazing when used well but people just crouch the whole map lol
---
He sees them only when is close to them, he just keeps collecting them like pacman and that why he found you.
---
say it with me kids, Fuck urban and fuck anyone who runs it.
---
It just started yesterday so no it hasn't been in place for a while now.
---
Looks fine to me
---
i mean it isnt wrong. noed is basically the first decent perk you find in ever bloodweb. even with the teachables i have I've gotten noed t3 before bbq t1
---
i love how every comment here has been downvoted by at least one person.
---
I havent used it in a long time but I love that perk. Why you hate it?
---
Very fun. Mind gaming was at an all-time high. Acted like I was using my powers by standing still after survivors would throw down pallets and they would jump back over in fear. Made for some easy hits and fairly easy game. Can’t wait till I get ruin out of my blood web 😏
---
? That's not what it means
---
I never argued that though? OP and other people say they add more bugs than they fix and it’s simply not true so why do people keep saying that? If people want to be upset at the devs that’s fine but be upset about stuff that’s actually true that’s my point or is that dumb too?
---
She is hard to use your first few matches but once you understand how her phase works oh boy shes a monster lol
---
I wouldn't say that one is underrated either seeing as how everybody says it's the only counter to Spirit in high ranks.
---
Sounds pretty Fucking sick ! Gonna have to try her ! Keep on killing man
---
Surveillance is one of the least used, strongest perks in the game.
---
Surveillance gives reliable information about the map while not providing easy counter-information to the survivors. Survivors can tell if a killer straight-lines after a hook, so they know BBQ is in play and can use lockers to counter. Survivors can tell if a Killer bee-lines for a Discordance generator and separate to counter. Survivors can't stop Surveillance since they need to halt the regression, and it's hard to tell if the Killer had any information.
---
It pairs well with Surge, allowing Killers to completely ignore having to kick generators -- Arguably one of the largest wastes of time unless you have Pop goes the Weasel.
---
Any killer can do well with the information Surveillance uses. Area-defense killers like Trapper or Hag can utilize it to further protect their area. Mobility killers like Billy or Nurse can quickly travel to whichever gen Surveillance popped on. Stealth killers can use it as an easy tell to know who to sneak up on.
---
It's subtle, it's potent information, it plays well with other perks, and it's useful to every killer.
---
It was introduced because trolls used to pick people up and drop them over and over prolonging the game endlessly for that survivor. The bleedout timer also didn't run out in the process.
---
You: *trying to look at this sword cosmetic in the store to see if its worth buying*
---
The Oni:
---
Even if hes strong at 1v1 i havent seen him to 4K. He spents too much time looking for first survivor and getting His power (while i pop a gen with other team mate on opposite side of the map). What i do after he gets it ? Just hide he cant smack you if he cant find you. If hes running he has pretty small FOV even when he tries to smack you.
---
I'm on console, so I don't even get the new sysyem :/
---
It wasn't like he was going to depip op said the killer had someone on death hook it seemed reasonable that the killer could turn the game around but no he just dced because of fucking sabo.
---
Look at Win rate of Nurse right now and before ''rework'' lmao
---
Yeah it's really sad when they give up. I usually carry them out or to the hatch and it takes them a minute to realize I'm letting them go. Figure they're on their phone waiting for it to be done with.
---
One: Teammates using it are mostly the worst player on the team, they are annoying as shit
---
Two: do you enjoy looking for a team of survivors that do nothing but hide with stealthy clothes? do you enjoy looking for a single survivor for 3 mins
---
Because he was forcing Dwight to fall into the trap, probably for the challenge. Braking the pallet would allow Dwight to escape through the other door that did not had a trap.
---
I mean, I definitely hard agree survalence is an amazing perk. But what's that got to do with urban? Lol
---
I was having this issue as well since the release of new chapter. I sent a ticket into BVHR and they emailed me saying they're working on a fix asap. Keep ya patience mate, they're trying.
---
you're not wrong
---
Appreciate the reply, thanks for the info!
---
That's some serious mental gymnastics you got going on there.
---
It's cause if you're hiding, it means you're usually not good at holding your own in chases and force more attention on your teammates.
---
Which is... Fine if they don't mind taking chases and using setups efficiently. But for a team of survivors to function you kind of need to play musical chairs with the killer's attention. Everyone gets way more points that way, it's the efficient way to play as survivor.
---
its actually kinda funny someone would downvote this comment. he's probably just mad I'm at 60 hours and am higher rank
---
Bug aside, a (Hex?) Perk that injures survivors for failing skill checks on gens (with some condition maybe) would actually be fun.
---
Just leaks so far but with dbd leaks might as well be confirmed so this is what we have so far:
---
Static field replaced with an AOE attack called Static Blast which charges up over time. Can now use shock therapy outside of treatment mode. A couple or add-on changes to deal with the new static blast, mostly cool down.
---
In short; they're removing his ability that gave him passive madness build up therefore removing the Doc's ability to find people really easily since the only way to make survivors mad now is by hitting them with the blast or therapy and blast charges up so it's out of commission at the start of a round
---
Spirit is so cancerous
---
People aren't really 'just like that' though; pretty much any serial killer where we have reliable information about their childhood, their childhood was a nightmare of abuse. Failing that it's usually them having particular contempt for people society already hates.
---
Or both of those things. "People are just born evil" is just extremely convenient for people want to write a specific kind of fiction.
---
Yes I did say they were the most banded maps because most pallets can be played around, honestly if you get "destroyed" it's mostly your own fault.
---
then the girls you watch are just cunts lmao
---
damn bro, you seem mad. i didnt even want to climb to purple ranks. I'm dog shit at the game. and i got skyrocketted into a rank where i can't even learn new killers cuz my base mechanics are shit from lack of exp. I'm actually hoping i derank pretty fast while trying new killers so i can get back to a rank that i can learn and experiment in without being totally obliterated by dudes who are sweating for the win. also i might have 60 hours but I've been in the community for years. I've watched dbd content since launch and browsed the reddit from time to time. i just finally decided that i wanted to start playing it(it always seemed cool, but didn't ever feel like playing it. it felt like a game I'd enjoy more by watching than playing which i was wrong i love the game)
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
So change gens speeds AND punish face camping.
---
I'd say since there's 4 survivors to every 1 killer that's 4 chances for Urban to every 1 chance of Surveillance. ;-)
---
But we'd have to see percentages of usage from BHVR. Wish they'd put out those metrics.
---
Right, so if you're injured, being chased by the killer, you just need to do a pallet stun and then pull someone off the hook. 3 seconds later you're magically healed? That is pretty much the definition of "op".
---
Unfortunately BHVR is really set on not making her traps trigger during EGC. I don't think we have a chance to be heard if we ask for endgame Pig to return.
---
The uni ball fine pencil is perfect for drawings like these. U can draw with normal pencil first, then perfect the drawing with the uni ball and erase the lines after finishing. They're cheap and really good!
---
tbh as a killer I just got facecamp some obscure corner of the map if they've plundered my basement chest.
---
I wonder why. Maybe.. just maybe.. there's too many survivors and not as much killers to fill lobbies. When you have very long queues as survivors is just because there's not many killers making lobbies
---
That's it. It's actually weird since usually is the other way around when a new chapter comes live. I guess this time people like to play vs oni more, which is fun imo
---
With his boomstick and chainsaw maybe but without it most killers except maybe Leigon and Pig could beat him
---
Myers can insta down forever
---
I never said it wasn’t, I’m just reinforcing the statement that is causes bad habits. Your only point is that survivors complain about NOED and treat it like this terrible awful crutch perk. I get it. I’ve heard it a million times, that’s not what I’m saying here
---
No Ed, Pop, Deer, BBQ
---
Maybe extend the time to be healed to 15/13/11 7/5/3 is way to short im my opinion
---
your hair is truly gorgeous, girl 😭😍😍
---
I will buy David then
---
Had OP said something“they added worse bugs to the game with this patch”. that I could agree with but they didn’t say that.
---
 In fact in my original comment I didn’t give my thoughts at all about the devs not fixing long time bugs or them adding worse ones because neither of these have anything to do with what I was saying. So why bother bringing these up?
---
I was hoping they'd do something to him to make him better in a chase so that he doesn't eat pallets like it's going out of fashion. Maybe increase his shock stun from 2.5 to 4.5 or maybe something in between but all they've done is change something that didn't need changing.
---
I'm not single. Care to try again?
---
For starters thrilling tremors and pop are good for interrumpting gens, BBQ gives you more points and also more info and something like devours hope may work if you go to the gens after you hook someone, otherwise franklins or rancor are not bad either.
---
1) The Oni is a fundamentally limited killer on console, I've been a Nurse main for quite a few months after the Legion's chapter and I never felt limited by the sensitivity controls with her as much as with the Oni. Also, there was a glimpse of console optimization in those months and the devs looked like acting on good will;
---
2) I've grown tired of BHVR's silence towards console optimization, always hoping that with the  "next patch" the framerate will be much better, while getting worse and worse instead;
---
3) Titanfall 2 is free for PS Plus owners, an actual optimized game that runs at smooth 60 fps on a normal ps4, while having 10 times the amount of detail and 100 times the amount of activity going on screen. It had a bigger budget than DBD of course, but there is no excuse for a game that looks like a ps3 game to run under 30 fps most of the time.
---
Playing Killer in DBD right now is an act of love that the devs don't quite deserve anymore.
---
Just look the difference between April's data and the latest one. It's night and day
---
One is very accurate while the last one lacks of sny actual decent data. It means nothing and also devs said that we shouldn't make conclusion based on it. So.. what's the point of releasing it in the First place I wonder, if they are so meaningless
---
I have a closet cosplay of Dwight, though mine involves the closet a bit more
---
wait why did someone downvote this? i never said i did it in an online game. just that i tested the glitch and found out it wasn't a 100% chance
---
Yeah in summary you can literally just say that he is an outdated killer overall.
---
I dont think the first 2 evil dead skins would be possible, its not just about voicing their approval, usually there's a good chance Raimi would want some money off that
---
You can say whatever you want online doesn't make it true. But we all know what happens when you press X on that web broswer tonight.
---
Man, I really feel like the Devs are encouraging Anti-Fun legion (Sloppy Build)
---
Girls I watch?
---
I had a Freddy who kept putting snares around me while I was crawling on the ground. It was kinda funny at first but it carried on for at least a solid 30 seconds while I just crawled around waiting for him to pick me up. He eventually picked me up and carried me to hatch, only to stomp on it and go back to snare spamming. I really don't understand why killers do this shit. I wasn't even being toxic to him before hand.
---
Yea I think some protection against some of the exit spawns would be nice. Opposite ends is a coinflip but when a survivor is within your terror radius when opening either gate it's kind of a joke.  Something like how they adjusted the hooks
---
There have been ban systems in place for some time now. At least the devs have claimed this. I've never heard of it on console so I assumed it must have only been implemented on PC... that was just an assumption however and I'm still glad they finally added this.
---
I've posted my frustrations here before as I'm a killer main (7) and I've probably been DC'd on at least once for every 2 matches. 
---
Although, it seems to get a lot better when you reach rank level 10 and below.
---
This again...
---
- Your opponent trying to win is not toxic.
---
- Your opponent is not responsible for your fun. You are not responsible for your opponent's fun.
---
I know it sucks to be camped. And it sucks to be tunneled. But you shouldn't punish the killer for trying to win.
---
Reward the survivor for hanging in there and wasting the killer's time. Make it so that as long as the Killer is losing BP for camping, the Survivor is gaining BP for being camped. Put it in the same category as Distraction.
---
There. You don't punish people who enjoy the Bait strategy, but you also don't overly harm the poor soul that was unfortunate enough to get caught first.
---
Also - Run Kindred. It's been buffed recently, so it's a worthwhile information perk. And it lets your whole team know if the killer is camping immediately.
---
True true
---
Add another box. 2 if you want and increase the timer. It should have the same effect but feel a lot better. It would feel tedious to find two keys but not as much as just searching an extra box. They also wouldn’t have to code nearly as much. There are addons to add more boxes, so adding another key would wreck those, while this should be fine.
---
Heard this in the exact voice lmfao
---
Use Lithe....BL is shxt bcuz it has to be used in the right situation.......basically, only when there's high ground.......Sprint handicaps you from running.......Dead Hard is pretty much useless bcuz Ppl in high levels will learn when to make you waste DH then down you......
---
BL sucks
---
I don't think there should be because hide and seek is very boring to play. On a lot of maps you can go undetected for basically an infinite amount of time if the killer doesn't have whispers. The tricky part is how you balance risk with it all while playing your role in a team.
---
Insidious and noed that's it and bring a ebony mori.
---
the reason why i did is bc you are acting like this update was some sort of god sent patch, you said "can you really notice more then that" and yes actually, i can. there are so many bugs in this game.
---
nope because I find nurse boring and plus dedicated servers have messed her blinks up completely. So yea  
---
also the new map is fucking dark as shit
---
It just shows that they refuse to let killers take a step forward without taking 10 steps back.
---
It's funny how the totem always had a bad spawn when WE are the killer
---
maybe my filtering is weird then cuz the only killer complaints i end up seeing are of how survivors act towards killers something that i think is very obvious that i agree with. reddit mobile just knows me too well i guess
---
Pretending to associate the term "image editing" with Instagram is even more pathetic, lol.
---
I never acted like this is some god sent you just made that up. Hell I never even said the patch was good.  Instead of assuming if you had just asked me “do you think this patch was good” I would’ve said no. I mean idk why you’re even continuing this when you’ve already agreed with my point anyway. What more is there to say?
---
&gt;I've never seen a killer complain "the survivors are using meta perks and looped me"
---
Then you clearly aren't paying attention, killer mains bitch about survivor perks just as frequently as survivors bitch about killer perks.
---
It's just that if that killer returns after every unhook they probably don't wanna play nice. Not wanting to play nice and being toxic is different indeed.
---
Also it's not like using NOED is toxic. It's just that many killers who play toxic also have Noed on them. I think mainly because acting toxic before all gens are powered basically means wasting time, and if you waste a lot of time you can really use some endgame boost.
---
red mori existing is what I'm talking about. Scummy playstyle is what they put in the game nobody likes. Bug abusing isn't really the point of the post. Camping hooks, and OP addons like old beads. That's not bugs. That's a thing you can do in the game because the devs made the game the way it is.
---
I'm not asking for Lery's level of distance between doors, just something to make me actually have to check one door at the time at reasonable intervals ;w;
---
but are they bitching about the perks or that the survivors use them. theres a huge difference. i might think a perk is broken, but i understand why someone would use it. they wana win why wouldn't they
---
yall remember AskaGangsta? This is him now, feel old yet?
---
The biggest balancing issue in this game is the difference between SWF and solo play. The most important thing in this game is information (I'm looking at you BBQ). That's why there are perks to give survivors that information at the cost of a perk slot. However when you factor in SWF they don't need to use that perk slot for info and can get better info than a solo survivor with perks. For this game to be balanced properly they need to remove the communication barrier for solo players and then rebalance survivor around that communication. This halfway point balancing is not working
---
Eith what little you have i'd probably go BBQ devour pop noed.
---
I'd work towards getting ruin of course and monitor and abuse.
---
The little bit of extra sneakup time you get from it pays off.
---
Who the fuck mains legion?
---
More limited? From my understanding, his builds were already super limited. Most revolved around STBFL and sometimes SB. From what I can tell, Legion has more variety. You can still run STBFL and SB, it'll just work the same as every other killer in the game. It isn't like Legion can't use those perks, it'll just be harder to build stacks. You still have to actually hit survivors with M1. And NOW, you can also use things like Bamboozle, Fired Up and PWYF. I'm basically running with janky tier 1 perks that barely do anything, and I'm being super effective half the time. Seems like more variety to me.
---
I very much agree! I was going to go into this but I didn't want the post to be extremely long
---
Still has a &gt;50% kill rate in the ranks that matter. A red rank Nurse and a yellow rank Nurse are vastly different opponents. Killers with high skill floors are obviously not going to fare well in lower ranks
---
swf* happened twice last night, we were all running around with med kits trying to get them to hit us but they never did
---
I’m a console surv main.. you go through enough just abuse it my guy
---
this is just ur stream don't lie
---
Yeah it's a bug
---
Yea generally I run in with dead hard, self care, botany, and generally an aura reading perk (right now I like empathy). I also bring either a toolbox or med-kit if I have one
---
i don't play nice when its a 1v4 which is why i return if I'm nearby if someone is unhooked, but in a 1v1, if i know that guy was messing me up all game, i usually give him the hatch. i play to win, and once I've killed 3, to me thats a win, so i will give the hatch if the last guy was note worthy throughout the game
---
For any killer that let's this happen... You deserve to lose. Sweet jesus. Learn to ditch a chase.
---
It's for the Tome challenge of getting a hook during EDG.
---
But dude. From your manner of speach you don't strike me as the kindest either.
---
Tbf if the didn't change how deep wounds works, everyone would of complain about "old legion" coming back. They did the balancing before people complained instead of after.

LEGION MAINS RISE UP
---
IMO you could replace SC and Botany with Inner Strength and Small Game/Detective's Hunch or Spine Chill. You'll heal much quicker than SC and Botany, and you'll get the benefit of getting rid of totems (possibly even hex totems) while gaining the ability to heal.
---
You misunderstand. 
---
The first key would still be random.
---
In other words they’d potentially have to search every box before finding just one key (same as they do now) but then afterwards need to go all the way to the furthest box from them to get the second key to disable the trap.
---
Minimum possible search of two boxes on opposite sides of the map if the survivor is lucky.
---
Maximum possible search of every box plus one box a second time on the opposite side of the map.
---
It’s basically the same as your suggestion just yours allows the possibility that they get lucky on both the first and second key being the first two boxes they try and them being right next to each other.
---
Plus if my suggestion is too weak you can have an add-on that makes the second key be random as well. This potentially wasting even more time from the survivors as they go all the way across the map just to find the second key isn’t even there.
---
Yea I've debated just not playing survivor again until I get at least a couple ppl in a swf. I don't need a full stack but even going in with one other person is game changing
---
Okay, first off GF has to recharge his power, that's his downside. Not to mention the fact that you actually have to be good at the game, it's not just given to you to play stealth killers. And exposing him is bugged on both sides, you can expose him through 'solid' walls if you get a tiny glimpse of him moving to behind it. All in all, Ghostface and Wraith are very high-skill killers that require as much, if not more, time investment that Nurse. GF's normal stealth speed is the only reason he is viable, and even then he gets wrecked by exploitable god-loops that any brain-dead idiot can run. Night Shroud is only useful against better survivors to players that know how survivors think, aka people that don't main a side like an idiot.
---
You can complain about tunnelling the RBT's, but the time wasted going after 1 person will be an instant loss because all the other gens are done.
---
Not to mention, the Devs don't care. They seem to exist to vilify anyone who touches killers. I certainly DO care, because it's a fucking stupid playstyle that is boring as hell, really mean to survivors and will lose the killer the game, same as facecamping. Even basement bubba 4k is a loss, but toxic idiots don't care about that and invent their own win condition, called the '4k'. Seriously, that's not winning. That being said, if I'm creeping around and I hear someone rummaging through a Jigsaw box you can be damn sure I'm gonna go for the free hit, it's a free hit and it can slow the game down massively just from the panic and pressure it puts on the now-again-injured survivor that just got chased off a billy box without being sure if it has a key.
---
Dying light is a terrible perk against good survivors.
---
Maybe play a little more of both sides against solid killers/teams, you will  understand the mechanics behind the proposed changes better. Pig's ambush is actually worse than just uncrouching. Trapper is one of the worst killers in the game, and their abilities are completely different so I'm not sure why you are comparing them. Oni is awful against good survivors, as is Demo. They are both fun killers than can be looped hard because they are so easy to hear. Freddy is harder to loop, but he is still that - a loopable killer. Not to mention that dying light actually buffs survivors, and ruin usually goes instantly (or gets ploughed through).
---
Remember, it's a 4v1. A killers skill should always trump a SINGLE survivors in the end, but the FOUR survivors ability to work together should give them an equal chance to escape, and a survivors individual skill should give them a good chance to win. Right now, that's only the case with killers like Nurse, Spirit, Ghostface and (thanks to tru3ta1ent's efforts) apparently Wraith (though I think Wraith is the least viable because of his reliance on very rare add-ons). These proposed changes might make pig more viable by combining slower stealth with increased match time. Right now, her stealth is too slow and her RBT's don't extend the match very much, so it isn't in that perfect target where everyone in the match has a chance to win at the loading screen.
---
Make sure you get monstrous shrine as fast as possible too
---
Dead hard is still the king of exhaustion perks.
---
Sure with dedicated servers you can no longer use it reactionary (well sometimes), but it still gives you an extra loop at many places, and can get you to a window or pallet instead of going down.
---
Yikes. The projection is real.
---
Big ass mouth full.
---
So BMing and constantly spamming snares AFTER the hatch is closed is part of that challenge as well? Aight buddy. This was also before that tome came out by the way. Forgot that was relevant.
---
Sucks for both sides lol killers hate swf and survivors hate not having it.
---
I think it's fine in other games but I end up having to heal 3-5 times per match and botany+empathy allows me to heal the rank 20 who doesn't have a healing perk
---
kill la kill
---
I hear you we've all been there
---
Unpopular opinion perhaps, but I think her perks are all garbage. The pallet lifting is pretty useless since most killers destroy safe pallets, and the other two I think are only meme perks
---
Amazing
---
They are always in obscure places like one time bitch we were looking everywhere and it was like in a deep crack in between 2 tree like there is no possible way you would be able to find it unless you hid in that crack which is how I found it hiding from Freddy.
---
Very nicely done
---
this is a good mindset to have
---
That's do fucking toxic
---
Also a killer main and yea it’s a pain. So my understanding was that they tried to penalise dcers but rarely did because it was hard to judge who intentionally did it when everyone was connected to the killer. Now that we have dedicated servers it’s much easier to tell if it’s on purpose or intentional, or so they say.
---
seriously fucking stop it
---
For me personally when I solo queue as survivor I generally just try to be the best team player I can be even if my team isnt really good. I also always make sure to run deliverance for when they betray me lol
---
I got chased for 2 mins and they did 2 gens. The team is half to blame but the killer shouldn't be able to get away with it. Even if the rest of the team just left me to die that's still a complete waste of my time in solo queue.
---
What I expect ( rather hope) to change is that killers get punished for focusing on just 1 survivor and camping them til they die on their first hook. If people just accept things how they are then where is the incentive for change?
---
Two very different things. One is setting up a perimeter of traps - which is how you are meant to play trapper and if people stand in the traps then that is on them. Another is face camping one survivor using the blood fury mode of oni that can down multiple survivors going for the unhook.  Yes the team is partly to blame, but if they want to even try to unhook me they have 0 chance. Your strategy is different.
---
Or maybe just maybe the fact that me and tons of other people complain about this might inspire some change.
---
Haha i dont have many perks on survivors most of the bloodpoints i earn goto killers
---
From what I've heard, behavior is planning on changing moris and keys
---
The issue is that I'd still just be waiting to go into a game and be rewarded for giving the killer a good chase by being face camped to death.
---
The survivor have the same problem with some killer too, like myers or gosthface. But i can understand that as a killer is more frustating, normally i play with the light on, but in the new map is unpossible, u have to play in total darkness
---
From which movie this guy is ?
---
Wait, wth was old brand new part then?!
---
In case this is a real thread and not an ad, BennyBoyTV has an insane level, while playing everything and playing fair. He mostly speaks French, though.
---
Are you serious? Maybe at rank 20 the killer will never find you but a rank 2 killer doesn't struggle to find people. Maybe if I hide in a locker and don't do gens..
---
Dude u dont get camped every game...stop exaggerating
---
Yeah i like otzdarvas trapper 
---
and STBFL fever
---
Ah I can understand that if you're a killer main. I play both depending on how I feel and I managed to get killer and survivor to rank or 10 lower! 
---
I wish you a perfect next killer game friend and  happy holidays.
---
On PC it's by pressing ESC. No idea what it is on console though, probably whatever is the equivalent to the START button.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
some day it might change DBD for the better but there ain't much you can do about it then do gens try to take hits for your team mates use BT and DS
---
Instant gen completion on use. Could pop 4 gens in 1 second
---
Dead hard or sprint burst. If you use dead hard just dont use it for the I frames use it for extra distance at a loop for a extra window vault or to make it to a pallet in time, and if you use sprint burst dont be useless and walk all game, sprint around and just lower your exhaustion while doing gens, or hold it at 99 so you can walk for half a second to activate it.
---
That is not normal. The Bloodweb should continue spawning Perk tiers until none are left.
---
why do you have to hate the grind
---
I feel like stridor should counter iron will bc otherwise the perk would be utterly useless and stridor makes injured people without iron will loud af which could throw the killer off as well
---
Ah that's fair. New players not getting this is understandable, but I still meet killers in red/purple ranks that still can't grasp this. They just DC... I can NOT wait for the penalty to be introduced.
---
happend to me once  walked in the opening  nothing happend then the bitch gave me a heartaatttackk too
---
interesting
---
Oh, I only play on PC, I peobably should have mentioned that, sorry.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Literally the only way to use Legion before was getting 8 stacks of STBFL and then never use frenzy never fucking again. Frenzy is useless because the post-stun is so damn long that is so much better to just hit them with stbfl. You can use frenzy to cover long distance, but is not really the big diferrence.
---
That would be a great PSA, thanks man
---
YEAH
---
When people fuck over their teammates like this I down the one that got fucked over and let them get picked up and then tunnel the fuck out of the one who fucked them over. This one is debatable whether it was super purposeful but otherwise yeah.
---
No, just trying to cover the exit with traps
---
Nobody said it was toxic but it would make sense that actions like getting stabbed in the neck would enrage the killer over time. People keep crying over moris so there's a option. But I tell you this as someone with close to 6k hours in DbD I would prefer a Mori the killer has to earn rather then one they can just equip and then kill the whole team. And im a killer main.
---
Its cool you agree they shouldn't be offerings but weighing the pros and come my idea has more common ground then you may think. They won't remove moris. Its also unlikely they will add another hook requirement. I dont know what games your playing but I would rather get to blind and stun a killer like 10x before he could Mori anyone on my team.
---
Don't get wrapped up in obviously place-holder numbers, and I threw teabagging in because of the "enrage" concept. With or without it would be fine but in a chase Huntress has like 5x Hatchets so crouching 100x in one chase seems excessive but hey who knows.
---
It should not from a mathematical perspective.
---
I think that might've been your connection or his I dont think he dced
---
All the best killers share the hallmark of being able to move full speed while stealthed (Ghostface), cross the map quickly (Nurse, Spirit) or one-hit down (Ghostface again, Hillbilly) without the downsides of being slow (Leatherface) or limited (Myers, though Myers is so good in EW3 that a good Myers can make up for the limited evil in the match).
---
It's hard to imagine the buff not being related to Pig's ability to ambush, the easiest of which would be increasing the speed as she ran out of traps. Giving her straight-up aura reading innately would probably be too much, and one-hit-downs out of stealth (sorry, Ghostface) tend to be overpowered.
---
People have suggested getting to reuse her traps, which I suppose could be a stopgap, either by collecting them or 60\~ seconds after they're removed automatically.
---
I’d love a werewolf killer
---
I do not have dbd for that long, i only have 300h in game
---
What u/inediblesushi said is incorrect. The Hatch may be invisible before the required Generator conditions are met, but it exists on the map already and can be tracked by the Map (with the correct Add-on) or the Rainbow Map. They just don't reveal the Hatch's Aura before it becomes visible.
---
It's an issue that's almost unique to Spirit, no other killer benefits from it nearly as greatly as she does. The issue is that it's in culmination with everything else that makes her completely overbearing and unfun to play against, the one reliable defense you had is now gone.
---
Don't run Exhaustion perks. They are crutches that mean you aren't punished for bad positioning and situational awareness.
---
Play without them and you'll be a better player.
---
no he is on console but people on console are having problems with his movement in the demon dash thing
---
Yeah that's a major ballache. Hook me, fine. Give me the hatch, fine. Mori me, fine. Wait out the EGC timer? Dickhead. Its just wasting time. Anyone halfway sensible is checking their phone or browsing Reddit rather than getting salty.
---
I agree entirely, I'm always in purple ranks except for when rank reset happens (obviously) and yeah sometimes killers, for some inexplicable reason, still do this.
---
Friday the 13th
---
Sometimes, doing a lunge attack unstucks you
---
I can't really imagine how hard he is to control for you guys bc his turning radius is small I doubt PC has faster turning speeds
---
Thank you, what about Michael Myers ?
---
*Laughs in Hillbilly*
---
Rank 1 my ass, you can hit them with frenzy and they can just stay still until they hear your scream, and they would start running and be in fucking narnia before you can m1. Like why would they be scared of you, if you already hit them with frenzy, is not like you could actually down him. But is true that a lot of bad players are also red.
---
*Jesus has entered the trial*
---
8/10 in my opinion
---
Rank 1 player actually that is a Billh main that doesn't use any slowdown perks actually, I also play Hag and Freddy a lot with only Pop as a slowdown perk. Not that it matter as insulting my skill level is not a valid argument it just makes you look childish.
---
I have even 4k'd with clown in red ranks on Bedham before but I'll concede that survivors were a lil potato that game. They still did relatively well though considering they got all but one gen done and I had to slug multiple times to push through. 
---
You are only hurting yourself by not learning how to play unsafe pallets and just calling every loop a "god loop" when it probably is not.
---
Heavy blow seems a bit powerful, it literally cancels dead hard. I think maybe the movement speed during his power should either be lowered or be an overtime acceleration
---
Omg. That’s ridiculous
---
How??? I can't see scratchmarks, blood, can barely hear injured survivors over frank breathing heavely, 1 missed hit and i do not have my power for a long time, after i miss the hit i enter a cooldown, save the best for last legion is gone, so is sloppy butcher, but it still loses my stacks for play with your food, how is he brocken, you are just an entilted survivor main that gets mad when he can't window tech
---
it was apparently a "bug" I call bs on that I think it just introduced more lobby dodging which is fair dodging tbh
---
Source?!
---
multiple killer bug some people know how to do it and some just do it by mistake trying to find a normal game
---
That's not for me to figure out, I'm not employed by bhvr. And yeah maybe they can just ignore it and be ok but if a lot of people complain about something then chances are it's gonna have a negative impact on their business.
---
The killer is supposed to get you. Its a 4v1 not a 1v1
---
I always enjoy making these.  I love this game, even with all its flaws I've never encountered something quite like it.
---
does that come in gallons?
---
Collision was almost a double-edged sword. If the survivor was quick on their feet and picked up on the fact that they'd bumped into her, they knew to Dead Hard or drop the pallet if they're under it.
---
I'd argue that being able to move at mach speed while pinpointing a survivor's exact location in a chase based solely on breathing, let alone additional factors like blood and scratch marks, are quite heavily in her favor. That's assuming, of course, she's even phasing - let's not forget that letting go of the keyboard is a mindgame.
---
Which ghost face perks are garbage may I ask?
---
Buff?? Not a buff, you can't use save the best for last anymore and mend is down from 10 secs to 8, i think this is a nerf, the only good thing ismore running speed and faster vaults, but that  is it
---
I'm getting better with him ps4. I was a rank 9 killer going into him, so I've had to deal with higher ranked survivors. He's tricky but with the right set up he's manageable. Running NC, ruin, sloppy and Infectous Fright. I have some other builds I want to try but the web is being greedy with the things I want.
---
I never said that it happens every game, just often enough that it is a problem. And this is red ranks
---
I love it and I love trapper but maybe I am too used to the normal chase music but this doesnt feel like the trapper
---
I wouldn't be be lobby dodging if I knew that I was playing with players on a similar skill level or in around the same rank area. I don't care if I get sacrificed. I just want a good game, not get massacred in the first 5 minutes.
---
Ah yes, the true stabby wifu
---
Suck it up buttercup....or else go play Fortnite lol.
---
tell me why this would be a good idea?
---
Yeah now you are actually able to reach multiple survivors and the survivors don't gain distance by vaulting pallets.
---
But y'know, just focus on the "nerfs".
---
yeah although DS was useless in that situation and bt may have bought me the ds but I have seen the oni down multiple survivors with his blood fury attack. It's cool and all but very bs when used to face camp.
---
Stridor literally makes playing her take no brain at all so no thanks.
---
They need this, but not so much for bug fixing (that would take recoding the game from scratch), but for map design.
---
By the end of this roadmap, only TWO maps will have received significant changes: Badham and Léry's.
---
Meanwhile; Ironworks still has an infinite, Cow Tree can spawn inbetween jungle gyms, Haddonfield is still cancer, safe Abattoir stilk exists, Mother's Cabin has too many windows, the garage on Gas Haven is a deathtrap, etc.
---
BHVR need to look at their map designs and fix them, as they have been holding the game back for years.
---
And then the last gen pops and the killer down a everyone with NOED.
---
wheelie it and hop off the back sending it screaming into the killer.
---
and the steam powered oldsmobile!
---
I like using Devour Hope on Bubba, you can get the full 5 stacks without the survivors knowing if you just use your chainsaw to down them.
---
BBQ, Gen Blocking (forgot the name), PopGTW and probably NOED.
---
You've made me want that skin now, thanks
---
Dawg, are you suggesting we get rid of all insta down killers
---
When will they fix SWF, half the time you can't see your friend in the lobby and you get separated before joining a host...
---
Before someone brings it up, I must admit - people *have* tested the whole thing with her glass shards glowing when she begins to phase.
---
You have to be almost directly on top of her when she does it, be looking for a very specific single frame of animation, and pray she's not using one of the skins that remove this function entirely.
---
ScottJund's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOHy-NA2qaY) can explain it with far greater detail than I could.
---
People on both sides get boosted over dumb shit, best to just deal with it and go on, if the killer wants to throw the game over you consider your death a sacrifice for your teammates survival.
---
Update: I have ruin
---
didn't they claim they fixed match making so you will only be matched with people at max 2 ranks away from your rank?
---
You overestimate sheer will power lol try to take into account the size of these other killers as well. Some of these killers are big as hell. All it would take is one strike with any weapon to take all the survivors out of commission. Clown would lose because he has a wee knife, sure going against Steve with a baseball bag. But you ignore that killers have the range as well. Longer, heavier, stronger arms with actual weapons designed to kill. Steve might land a good swing, but that doesn’t measure to a machete to the face. Especially if all these killers are so deranged.
---
I'm just genuinely lost with him. I would be okay with him if I could still have a standard lunge with a 1-hit down in Blood Fury, and use his demon dash to get across the map. But his lunge is replaced by that incredibly awkward charge up move that I find to be almost impossible to hit with. So I'm forced to use demon dash for hits which results in me immediately losing control and bumping into everything and losing the survivor.
---
If another suvivor is disarming a trap you csn just walk over it, but so can the killer
---
It's amazing for stealth. But stealth is situational. Best case scenario, the killer passes you over; they then rotate and they probably find a teammate instead and chase them. If you're on low hook lives or in a bad position, that's great! 
---
But that won't be all the time or even most the time, &amp; if the killer never finds you, they'll run through your teammates hook lives much faster. So the use you can get out of stealth is inherently limited. You gotta participate in chases, so I'd rather have chase perks.
---
Console should have a option for more sensitivity
---
Maybe they have friends on console? Awful suggestion, would not agree.
---
I thought it was common knowledge that DBD has spaghetti code.
---
I am still impressed when a new patch completely breaks something that should have no business being even close to any of the changes.
---
New killer perk: Asian Mom
---
"The entity turned out to be an asian mom. Failure is not an option anymore. 
---
When you fail a skillcheck on a generator, you'll be injured/put into dying state/sacrificed."
---
Wheres the third book thats even bigger of stuff they break every patch?
---
I'll be completely honest with you - I just want a closest thing we can get to Shrek
---
gf cuz you dont have one.
---
Hi not_Queen_hbvr. 
---
I have afew questions about the game if you dont mind :). I know i may not get an answer due to "non disclosure agreement", but i just love this game too much.
---
Anyway:
---
Will there come more killer reworks than what BHVR has announced? (I know the doctor has "leaked / announced" a rework) If this is the case, does this include license killers? (Personally, I would love to see the Pig to get some love - i know you cant tell me anything about that sadly :P)
---
I’m fairly certain the “kills during Endgame” challenge counts when you hook somebody during it.
---
I unhooked someone during egc yesterday, killer hit him but I got BT, he went to the exit, I saw "safe unhook" pop up, we escaped, and challenge didn't count. I went to sleep after that, even tho it was only 7pm.
---
u watch people that are better than you and learn some tricks from them like Otzdrava or OhTofu and so on just like I learned survivor from playing Killer and seeing survivors act and move from how I play
---
well o never play killer so now i am mad i got slugged for ThE ChaLeNgE
---
Mobile App, like Google play, but without region block
---
Amen brother.
---
Were you the Obession? She was probably after her challenge (kill 4 obsessions)
---
Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if they legitimately thought it had to be the endgame timer. Some of the challenges are kind of vaguely worded.
---
Sometimes it's the server. I got kicked mid games as a killer and surv randomly. It's very annoying.
---
Ill have to try that it just seems like such a jump
---
I actually don't remember. I might of though. Thanks for pointing that out!
---
Oof, I guess we'll see how it will work out. Thanks! &lt;3
---
Tap the atk button while in rage mode and he performs a normal strike. Helps a ton knowing this.
---
Book 1 is a pop up that just says "lol it's actually a legion nerf again"
---
I get that there's a bigger psychological impact to having to search for two keys instead of hving extra boxes, but in the previous worst case scenario you search four boxes, while in the latter you might have to search in five or six boxes.
---
But you're right that it would be an easy change. Maybe they could just make Jigsaw's Sketch basekit. I'll think about it some more and add it to OP.
---
Spine Chill let's you know when a killer is coming when line of sight is blocked, and counters spirits haunting if you know how to do it effectively, also tell when a killer leaves you to go for someone else or to patrol, it has many flexible uses. Kindred isn't very good IMO so i agree on that, change my mine if i'm wrong
---
Well if you feel like you are learning nothing from just playing regular games and trust me it is gonna go from everyone being plebs to "wtf why cant I hit people" at least that is how it was for me so better to learn from the best
---
Yes. They're trashbags
---
Base line noise is 1, Iron Will reduces 100% so it's -1, Strider increases by 50% so it's +.5. The math goes 1-1+.5=.5 math says it does work as intended
---
It's always the extreme loud ones
---
It is when you consider that legion's original frenzy speed was 5.28 m/s (132%) and now it is 5.2 m/s (130%). For all practical purposes Legion has his old speed back.
---
This is correct. Still 50K for free isn't a bad shout
---
I have to agree. Watching streamers has helped me soooo much. OhTofu, Otzdarva, Fungoose, and Monto are all great streamers and you should check them out. From my experience, I’ve learned way more from Fungoose because he actually explains things instead of just saying “I’ve got 7k hours in the game” like other streamers do.
---
OP has been posting these for months and is only ever upvoted. He has a lot of support.
---
Nice high effort meme, love this
---
Seeing killer mains and survivor mains argue, is like watching Tom &amp; Jerry again...
---
Yeah because playing against plague while broken the entire match is super hard. Now not only does the killer not have his power, but now they can't even slug you to create map pressure, genius!
---
I think DBD is a unique game in that sense. As killer you have the option to control the match (providing you're doing well). You get to decide their fate. It makes it kind of fun sometimes to let people go. I do the same thing if I see that someone has bought their rank 20 friend or something, except I won't make it obvious I'm letting them go so they get to believe they escaped on their own and wiggled out 3 times and just happened to wiggle out near hatch :'D.  
---
Other times as survivor, especially when matchmaking was messed up the other way around and you'd get baby killers despite being red rank, I'd feel obligated to let them hook/ kill me. Simply cos it's unfair. DBD is also hugely about grinding for points so that's why people try and be nice on the opposing side sometimes too.
---
Thanks for the suggestions I take it Twitch is their primary platform?
---
It shows items on the floor
---
"Tru build"
---
 sloppy/nurse calling/thana always worked well on killers who can sneak on survivors. I've seen nurse with that, spirit, legion even trapper with that way before Tru decide to use that build.
---
I mean it was the meta build on legion when he came out, sloppy with thanatophobia and nurse calling.
---
Sloppy/nurse's at least,  I've seen that hundred of times on multiple killers since I play this game.

Honestly I wish I played on PC instead of console just for the perk skins more than anything else.
---
Yeah its really fun when everything is meant to meet your convenience right. Give me this Claudette but not that one, give me this hag, but not that one.
---
E.N.T.I.T.L.E.M.E.N.T.
---
I just wanna use it to make scratch marks hot pink tbh.
---
See ya!
---
I was talking about specifically using that build + never stalking with gf and only using him for stealth but go off sis
---
Why would you even slug a no mither? Easy downs, easy hooks. The whole point of Oni's power is to one shot, and with no mither he basically doesn't need it.
---
Doc Buffs looking good
---
You want to quit the game that's your choice, stop acting like the rest of us should care. It's not like people aren't aware of the issues this game has, we can decide for ourselves what games we play.
---
I would run corrupt intervention, ruin, BBQ and either noed or rancor
---
You can throw down a pallet on a trap and slide over the pallet unharmed
---
I sometimes wonder if BHVR porpsoly make legion a bad killer so he fails into obscurity after all he is there biggest mistake and I think a bit of a saw spot for them.
---
Tt, bbq, pop and rancor. Information plus regressing gens plus bloodpoints plus killing that obs fucker
---
hey guys, there’s quite a bit of hate going around about the nancy; yes what she did was frustrating but I don’t think she meant it maliciously. just a moment of panic of her behalf I think. she was on death hook and had been camped on the ground for a while by the time I got there, and our other teammates weren’t anywhere nearby. I, however, hadn’t been hooked at that point, so I wasn’t too angry, it was better that way. 
---
but in the end the killer DCed, so none of it mattered anyway haha
---
just remember to be nice guys, we all have brain farts every now and then
---
Have u tried to check the file integrity of the game?
---
This is way too accurate.
---
Everything here is something that already exists.
---
What does that mean?
---
Halloween.
---
Yeah, that's what they said... I personally haven't noticed much of a change though.
---
Sheesh... You take a party game too seriously girl. Chill!
---
Let everyone be what they wanna be.
---
Us gamers are the most gullible consumer group there is, with very low self-respect. We constantly get fucked over and then ourselves jump to defend the people who fuck us over. You make a simple point - a significant performance improvement was promised. Again and again. It was not delivered, again and again. Now it's pretty much forgotten as if the promise was never made. And the very people who were promised this will now attack you and defend the devs while throwing money at them for changing some colors on the pixels of their characters. It's maddening and pointless to fight. I gaven in, jumped to PC. If you have that option at all I highly recommend it.
---
Same but in my version she had noed, I was like - I CANT TANK IIII- Dead
---
I also think streetwise and botany's efficiency is also broken?
---
Well doesn't really matter for me anyways
---
Unfortunately for me, I'm quite the stubborn kind of person, so I won't upgrade my pc for something that I should have for granted. But I do agree on all your points, it's quite sad...
---
Yeah might be wrong but Ash cosmetics arent insanely popular (enough to still make them but still). I'm not sure if they would be willing to make an entire new model for younger Ash just for a cosmetic. Especially if they're going to put that much work into a licensed character, they might as well add an entire new character from a license they already own such as Pablo or Kelly from Ash vs evil dead or Adam Stranheight from Saw.
---
Dont get me wrong, I'm an ash main and I'd pay any amount of money for classic ash, but I just dont think they would. And if they were going to buy a whole new license just for a cosmetic, wouldnt everyone rather get the Scream ghostface cosmetic with a whole new survivor as well?
---
I'm sure I do.
---
No any change is a huge nerf and BHVR hates up. - The DBD Community
---
Still a death sentence since you dying early is bad for the team.
---
When this happens I always go into the basement, stay there get a few last blood points before the entity devours my poor soul lol.
---
He needs a complete rework. He's so bad lol.
---
considering 15% vault speed made half the windows in the game infinites, gl with that
---
I feel you, I felt dirty as hell paying for the game again. But at this rate I don't think anything will change on consoles until PS5/next Xbox come with stronger hardware.
---
Validating steam files for dbd just Google it
---
Props to these people, standing to their main, even tho theyre pretty weak AND really hated at the same time.

Thank you

My point exactly, though at least with other killers you don't buff them by having merely existing. Except for Myers but that isn't NM exclusive.
---
You've lost me. Where are we?
---
Ace has the worst perks
---
Yeah maybe the game can‘t see that bit
---
In the fog friend! Now get on those gens. I am gonna look for the ruin. 
---
*Please don't scream at me if it turned out to be haunted grounds*
---
I think they think that changing colors would give people who aren't color blind an advantage. Like making the red scratch marks appear as green or purple will make them easier to spot I'm guessing? Idk we really can't expect much from people who though Brand new part insta-completing gens and insta flashlight blinds were okay.

First time this happened to me I was at the exit about to leave when a Claudette gestured me to follow her, she leads me to the seemingly ago Trapper and within 2 seconds I'm floored with noed and Claudette ran out the exit and left me
---
They want to cover their disgusting matchmaking again so u can't dodge lobbies.
---
Revealing works fine. Just keep him at the center of your screen.
---
That's why we should stop asking for licensed killers.
---
What's with the plaster on your nose?
---
Nice bait
---
*Sidious Voice* DO IT!
---
When you as Ghostface face 4 Blendettes in a stealth mirror match.
---
Revealing works fine, just keep him at the center of your screen for 2 seconds.
---
Hmm. It's been a minute since we started the match, and I haven't heard a terror radius yet- [OH NO!](https://youtu.be/BMlTAZVkyyU?t=10)
---
Ace perk is fun for treasure hunting
---
Well at least you didnt get yeeted off the gen.
---
I really hope you're just trolling.
---
Shut upp
---
The problem is a lot of issues keep coming back
---
In all honesty, I've been playing DbD for longer than I care to admit, and Myers still hecking spooks me.
---
*than
---
have the same issue on console
---
We sure need a tea-bagging and flashlight clicking video now.
---
I would just rather have a fun match where neither side bullies each other and goes full sweat mode every game. I miss seeing Killers like the pig or race as Survivor. And I miss getting to play Bad Killers for fun.
---
Dead hard and Speint burst are now on top. I say that while I used to despise Sprint burst users
---
I still love it and I'm damn good at looping. The plays you can make with it are crazy
---
Sorry for my shyness and awkwardness. But first of all. Great cosplay.
---
Secondly you made Nea hot.
---
And lastly on behalf of the community I would like to thank you for not doing a Susie cosplay. This looks like it took quite a lot of time and effort. And it looks **amazing.**
---
Yeah but the game shouldn’t be like that, no game should. It’s not a good way to build a game with the mindset of “ oh well why don’t you find a way around it” especially when the problem can’t exactly be fixed by players
---
yes me too! It's really annoying but I've kind of got used to it.
---
iirc Wake Up exploit was bannable though, and I never had more than 1 person running it
---
Thank for reply i will think about that
---
PC: S-A tier. Strangely enough I think his loud ass footsteps are his biggest weakness. You can't hear anyone worth a damn. And they know where you're coming from. I find him a lot of fun on PC and enjoy him more than hillbilly who I am quite bored of.
---
Console however.. since I play PC and console. I can safely say I think he is one of the worst killers on console. At least from my personal experience. I'll continue testing him out on my Xbox.
---
I see where your coming from, but it would be a separate gamemode, so you could choose what or not you want to deal with scummy ×2.
---
yes, always when bloodlust kicks in
---
Slugged Survivors don't have collision with other players, that's why.
---
As for body blocking, IIRC Survivors can do it to the Killer too, to deny the Hatch closing animation.
---
HyperX Cloud II
---
Madness does nothing if you can hit skill checks, so yeah he does suck
---
Steve's are worse
---
"The only way to get out of this hole we find ourselves in is to keep digging." -BHVR, on Legion
---
Its usable and Endurance is really powerful. More people like to run it now
---
This is me asking for Ultra Wide support, at the bare minimum black bars on the sides rather then a zoomed in screen that puts you at a DISADVANTAGE.
---
Sorry if my post came off aggressive there, I wasn't trying to say you're a survivor main trying to get killers stealth nerfed or anything. My little rant was more just about how people (not specifically you) often ask for these hitbox changes without considering what they actually mean.
---
I love flashlight users. 
---
They are always around you, *like a mosquito*, happily buzzing you in the face, *like a mosquito*, and will gladly give their life just to mess with you a couple of seconds, you guessed it, *like a mosquito*.
---
Well the main reason they're next is because neither of them fit the add-on requirements. And the last time add-on changes happened, base power changes happened too lol
---
Obviously you've never seen "My Name is Bruce."
---
You kinda need slowdown perks if you wanna have fun in red ranks, unless you have fun druing 3 minutes matches. Yesterday I played as Demogorgon, I placed 2 portals and 2 gens popped out of nowhere(one in front of my face, because who is afraid of a killer). Extremely fun match :)
---
His assumption is probably just based on past experiences. I know that in my experience, killers that run NOED don’t tend to let the last survivor live. It’s not a judgement or a complaint, just an observation.
---
Apparently him being able to turn using mouse and q/e is unintended but they only hotfix the basement and wiggle bug. He’s so unfun to play against, he 4ks in 90% of my matches.
---
It's so satisfying as well too just do it yourself and give the killer this massive middle finger. Bonus points if you have DS and he tries to rehook you immediately.
---
Blendettes sweating rn
---
True but it's the fact that now I have to dedicate 1 of my 4 perk slots to a tracking perk when previously I didn't have to. This is even more or an issue considering another 1 of those perks is ruin because of how mandatory it is but that's a whole other can of worms that I don't want to open right now
---
I have a surplus of keys and add ons, I've escaped a few times like this.
---
Funny how everyone was btching aboit AMN on PTB even tho the killer can just break the pallet.
---
Sorry my bad should have clarified, I meant trying to find a game
---
Not necessarily. Plague has an add-on that makes it so that she can see when you throw up, as well as add ons that give her her red puke without the survivors needing to cleanse, making it a gg on No Mither players. 
---
Even then, the ability is pointless in the sense of "why would I bother with my power when this idiot injured himself for me?" 
---
That being said as someone pointed out, Oni also gets his power over time and from survivors being on hooks, so he'll get his power regardless.
---
They’ve said they basically are doing that by not having as many events. That’s why they didn’t have a summer event this year. Even the Halloween event was a complete joke, it wasn’t even an “event.” Last years events were so much fun.
---
You can't blink in those areas. I tested with the Flannel and the blink indicator stays under Nurse the whole time.
---
Not when their shit ruins the potential of something good, like this.
---
Welp that's all dependent on when u play usually for me I find games fairly fast around 3pm cest all the way to 4am cest but usually by then I'm logging off on EU btw
---
Happened to me more than once. The killers weren't kind.
---
But you have to complete the tutorial to play the game? Or is that a recent thing?
---
It breaks the immersion of the game though, if you force a "friendly" killer to do his job, then you end up with a hilarious trolling match that ends with 2-3 people dead.
---
I haven't seen any P3 Claudettes in my games.
---
I have the same problem, with survivor i only need to wait less than 3 min but with the killer i wait 15/20 minutes
---
Jesus. Punctuation and stuff.
---
You think Iron Will is good, try using it with Lightweight.
---
Once the killer loses sight of you they may as well give up.
---
I made it by myself :) thx!
---
They need to revert this stupid change where there's no grace period after setting a trap, that's what's causing this.
---
It’s so frustrating
---
Go around dropping pallets at the start of the match so that survivors can't drop them on you mid-chase.
---
idk about the generator thing though, unless they were running a full endgame build.
---
You queue within 6 ranks of your level, so it looks like it’s working as intended. If you want to play the same exact rank as you, you’d expect 45 min queues (although that’s not too far off from what it is now).
---
No you don't have and when you first launch it you are not even informed about it.
---
That was the point, and her "issues" were never actually issues.
---
Her "BS" mindgame of standing still is a feature of the Killer. You're supposed to have a guessing game, and since she's forcing it on you you're supposed to be at a disadvantage. Killer is the Power Role, they're supposed to win 1v1.
---
It's like Hydra
---
Cancer
---
It has to do with memory leaks, when it happens just restart the game
---
When I launched the game for the first time it forced me to play through the tutorial for killer and survivor. I downloaded it for free on PS4 so maybe that has something to do with it.
---
a toxic cutie
---
Ok.  
---
Except, it didn’t ruin anything and in fact, has nothing to do with this. 
---
The developers of the game decide what they want and create the ideas. So this character was always going to be what it is.  
---
The only way I can understand your ignorant view, is if BHVR decided to ask the community about which killer to do in a poll, and every time it’s a Japanese theme.
---
Boo fucking hoo. “There are 2 Japanese themes in the game, waaaaaaa”.  Right. With about 18 killers and 20 survivors, and multiple maps.
---
Only 2 killers, 1 survivor, and 2 maps are Japanese.  
---
Go fuck off with that BS
---
Absolutely Billy. Billy does everything he does for free. More general mobility, useful ability in loops, doesn't have Oni's weak start, doesn't lose the ability to chainsaw after picking a survivor up...
---
I got a small tip for when this happens. Sure, it won't work 100% of the time, especially if the killer has direct line of sight of both exit gates. Directly after the killer leaves to the other exit gate you go to the exit gate and work on it just before the first light starts to show (roughly 20-25% iirc) and go hide again. So the killer wont know you where there. That extra bit of progression might give you enough time to open it and gtfo.
---
Sorry, I'm not sure how most of this relates to my post. That they didn't outright copy an existing "Oni" but derive the design from the various existing such types and styles is exactly what I was saying, even defending them suggesting that such a design is bound to be derivative. And what does the timeframe of Demo's release have to do with anything?

That it isn't his real face also doesn't really matter - if I were suggesting that they stole the design from this artwork, it would just as much be stolen even if they used it for a mask rather than a face of flesh. But I wasn't even really suggesting that they did steal from it, I simply found this image perusing some Oni materials and find the resemblance uncanny, especially given the non-typical elements of it, such as long white hair and red-glowing eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if the artist for the Oni did use this artwork for inspiration, among other artworks, but I was mostly sharing it because I find the resemblance funny as well.
---
That it was a deliberate design choice to link him to Rin is a simple fact, and a very similar Oni mask has existed prior to it on the Yamaoka Estate map during the release of which we now know they had already been intending to later release an Oni character related to this lore. But that map was also released after 2016, of course, so I don't see the point behind this assessment either, with regards to my post.

You’re not supposed to know when she phases.

How many hours do you have??
---
My boy Ace is Italian
---
I think a lower percentage like 1-2.5% makes more sense, it's not enough to do a whole lot, but isn't negated in a fraction of a second by someone hiding behind the gen.
---
His fault for being toxic an covering exit but that still sucks and needs to be fixed
---
Why dont they fix bubba? Yeez
---
Well it's a shitty one at that
---
I did the same thing lol. I'd wait at pallet for them to lunge at me. I got hurt every time but it was worth jt just because I completed that challenge.
---
New killer, The Mimic!
---
His fix is coming soon. After Doctor. A Legion fix might be in there somewhere too. They stated this a while ago
---
Had a Billy last night that was afk for 2 gens at the start but suddenly came back, an Ace got wacked eventually only to be hooked and face camped to such an extent that I thought that Ace must of BM'ed at some point? Nope, did it to me after I borrow timed him, then did it to the Nea.... here's the kicker, after we got her unhooked with borrowed and everyone got away, he DC'd... 
---
Wise up, Billy...
---
It's obvious the devs barely play their own game, they say the ideal "balanced" outcome is for a killer to get two kills and two escapes, but in my experience if you get two kills you barely ever pip, and even worse, if you are good at chases/survivors make major mistakes that costs them the game and you end the game too quickly with 3/4 kills you won't pip because "you didn't hook/chase/hit enough" despite never having the option to. Meanwhile killers that suck or rely on RNG are kept the same. Keys and moris still in the game when they are unfunny game-shortening crutches.
---
he's Argentinian, it says so in the second line of his lore
---
Im gonna assume you're a pretty low ranked killer. Im rank 8 and always find a game im 15-45 seconds. Never longer. The lower your rank the longer the queue times since it basically has to autofill you eventually since most players are at decent ranks since they play so often.
---
Looks like it is working as intended. There aren,t many red rank killers and you have a 6 rank window to be queued up with
---
I'd agree to both of these changes ontop of a rebalancing most items and add ons in the game. Most add ons can change the game dramatically.
---
Ultimately this is a casual game that doesn't need to change anything really.
---
The third perk looks good and kinda fun to use with surveillance
---
Nice job :)
---
ah right, forgot to look up were elkwood is, or whatever it's called. Honestly it's all America at this point, you can't see half the characters.
---
Brah, 80% of survivor maps are in their favor. 
---
Billy does what Oni does for free. Oni is easier to loop because he's so loud, Billy doesn't lose his ability by picking someone up, Billy has equivalent mobility the entire game, as well as his insta-down. At the beginning of the charge, Billy's saw can even make sharper turns. 
---
Billy is certainly better than Oni. Oni is good, but he really struggles in early game and at loops, especially nasty loops like Abatoir or Disturbed Ward.
---
Sure but all that is situational. I play a few hours a night and I might get camped once every 20 or 30 hours at worst and usually its more rare than that.
---
I mean potentially  the Trapper, Wraith, Nurse, Doctor, Leatherface, Pig, Spirit, Clown, Legion and  Ghostface all could've had a relationship sooo... unless virgins have a special way of identifying each other I don't know how you could tell.
---
My mom gave them to me

---
This analogy doesn't really make sense. Give a horrible gun to the number one trick shooter in the world and that person will objectively be able to tell it's a horrible gun, and whether they can actually make it work depends very much on the specifics of the gun and in what way it is horrible. Zubat is one of the best players in this game, he demolished survivors with Oni in a way he does not even do as consistently with Billy, and he goes as far as saying Oni might be too strong, that Blood Fury certainly is ridiculously powerful.
---
Besides, again, my point was precisely to show what good players can do with Oni. He is a very strong killer. Analogously, it could be said that if the trick shooter can use that horrible gun like a masterpiece, it is a viable gun, good shooters could use it to great effect.
---
And either way, Zubat is by far not the only player doing well with Oni.
---
Well the Devs can’t change where the licensed Characters come from.
---
There are a lot of audio bugs since the last patch. I can't hear gens pop, downed survivors, hexed totems when they break, etc. Its not just you. Audio is fucked rn

wow, really? A gay joke? Cum on guys.

I find the best thing to do when you're the last one alive is to sit at a gate and wait for the killer to close the hatch if you have no hope in hell of finding it. Then you've got a 50 50 chance of opening the gate and getting out. Just pray the killer goes to the wrong one first. 50% of the time it works 100% of the time.

Just because Jake is asian, doesn’t mean he came from Asia, it is never stated he came from Asia, the only place of origin they reference is in the US.

Focus on licensed killers? Dude, out of 20 survivors 7 are licensed ones and out of 18 killers there are 5 (6 if you count Ghost Face since only the mask is licensed, the character is original) licensed ones so don't go saying there's a focus on licenses.
---
You literally said he gets chased for ages... that's why you're able to do the gens. It's like yin and yang you need both for that progressive harmony.

What we realy need is an anti face camp perk

yeah :(

I can sympathize with your exasperation. Perk releases (and adjustments) are painfully underwhelming the majority of time, and this Chapter is no exception. Particularly on the survivor side where perks are generally the only way to introduce new proactive game mechanics and ways of playing the game, the meta has been as stale as it can be, with mostly the same very limited pool of perks being good enough to see consistent use, for years and years.
---
That said, there are some glimpses of light every then and again. Nemesis' interactions with Play With Your Food, Rancor and Judith's Journal are actually neat, making it a good tech perk on a couple of killers. Blood Echo is worth using on Plague and Legion, basically nullifying Exhaustion perks. Zenshin Tactics can at least be argued to be reasonably useful as a training-wheels perk for newer players. The survivor perks this Chapter are all kinda atrociously bad though, indeed. But we did get that great Kindred buff, and looking at prior releases, Head On is not an awful perk, and it is fun and creates new interactions, Inner Strength has some synergies that make it worth using, Dance With Me is an underrated perk that can be used to great effect, Deliverance and Second Wind are situationally good. Comparably, there's been Discordance, Infectious Fright, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice, and even Thrilling Tremors and I'm All Ears are not bad. Don't get me wrong, these are still not meta-changing perks, and there's still a huge pile of perks that sould all be buffed on both sides, but it's not all awful, and on the killer side some of the releases have actually had impact on the meta (Spirit Fury, Bamboozle, Pop Goes The Weasel, Corrupt Intervention...).
---
Are you fucking mental everyone complained about old ds
---
If there was a killer that could place an immobilizing trap at intersections, hidden by gas or debris or even just incredibly fucking dark, that would terribly unbalanced too. Oh wait....
---
THEY WERE LOOKING KINDA DUMB WITH THEIR "ONI" SHIT AND STUFF
---
I don't know, for such a long cooldown, maybe allow the surv to rebuild the whole pallet.. that way you have a strong perk that can reset loops on a long cooldown
---
and if it turns out to be too strong, makes it so you have 2 cooldown : one for resetting a pallet, one for rebuilding and resetting a pallet
---
Or just grab them mid animation lol
---
Tomato-026- my ps4 name

Well, acorrding to history there were a Lot of Italian and other european inmigrants here in Argentina,  so he probably has Italian Genes, like almost everyone in Argentina.

But they can create original characters from somewhere other than the United States.
---
Thanks for the good laugh, I'll try to replicate this.
---
Perfect perks to counter face camping
---
Or just make the sacrifice health bar thing not decrease while the killer is x meters from the hook.
---
They all need to be toned down but i like the ideas, especially interconnected.

But FINALLY y'all: Since the update those people will get nm punished. :)

To be fair, Jane is Latin American and Jake is Korean American. They may live in America but they still represent different ethnic backgrounds.

She's African American. Her map is heavily designed based on Louisiana.

I had one of those people do that while I was wraith, I literally just walked behind them and closed the hatch......then after the match he complained about noed

That’s a third of the killers as licensed and every single on of them are from the USA, that’s my point.

Thank you i agree shes very underrated

I would highly doubt it, but maybe the devs will do a givaway like with all the Pink rarity stuff they gave us with 3.4.0. recently.
---
If you want a killer mains perspective, drag the games out. Survivors at early ranks until purple-red ranks are trash, there's no nice way of putting that, by this I mean make those survivors feel like they're good. If you can down them early in a chase, dont, drag the chase out and respect pallets/make them feel like gods at looping when they aren't, or leave them to go patrol gens since you want points for regressing gens, hook every survivor once before hooking on twice to make games go longer, let survivors escape and then find them again to get more survivor found points, basically play like you're trash but also keep playing smart, dont get serious until you feel you have the minimum amount of points to pip. Remember, the ranking system is flawed. As a killer you don't pip from getting a 4k in two minutes. You pip from drawn out gameplay, extensive chases, and taking your time toying with the survivors. Once you get to higher ranks its easier to pip since survivors are actually decent and all these things happen naturally.

Now Sleight of Hand I like killers really need a skill to protect their totems a little bit because nothing is more frustrated the losing a totem 15s. into a game.

So could the devs not try to get to use Jason and not have him associated with friday the 13th like with ghostface?

Bl has been nerfed cant do that anymore

Pretty sure that's the same thing just written differently because they're French Canadian.

I dunno buddy. Ive already been cucked out of several grabs thanks to dedicated servers

---
REPORTING FOR DUTY, SIR!
---
TIL using your killer power is toxic behaviour.
---
Myers is very overrated imo
---
Balanced Landing is the only exhausting perk that doesn't work in all maps, so it should be a perk that made something even if you are exhausted. It would be much better if they solved the problems and the maps that caused BL to be OP.
---
Looks like Paper Mario since that's paper Mario Peach that got out of the bars

I tought Feng was vietnamese. I might be wrong.

I like how CHONKY is fengs head

If you were a chill/nice dude I have no qualms bout letting you go if the game fucjed you over
---
Maybe a perk like that should not activate if the killer is chasing someone
---
Plague is from Romania I think
---
I've been saying for a long time that people who think Legion is bad are just bad at Legion. He comes with built in information. Use it!
---
The first one dumb bc if someone is looping me around the hooked survivor then I'm getting punished same with the seconded one.
---
If it just punishes face camping okay cool but 16 meters isn't face camping and usually I'm going to be that close to trap the basement up or the area
---
Swf maybe the rank 9 seems fine same with rank 2 killer the 15 is the odd one but still dumb
---
Uuuuh ... furry porn.
---
4 meters is good obssedion couldnt hide
---
I have saved teammates carefully crouching and then turned back to crouch only to hear phantasms spawning and screeching coz their dumbass have to rush away from hook immediately.
---
Go rescue the same guy again and he will do the same dumbassery again
---
breakout seems good if your playing with your buddies. Oh wait sorry. TOXic SWF BULLY SQUAD
---
Then hatch standoffs would come back and no one wants that, thank you.
---
I think it more or less has to do with the Ranks bottlenecking advancement.
---
\- Survivors have a tough time getting to rank 12-ish after that they will find it way easier to quickly rise in rank, due to the fact that you'll be getting more perks, items and teammates that know the game by that time.
---
\- Killers only have to fight upwards, against higher level survivors running nothing but the meta perks, not to mention the fact that at lvl. 12 and upwards you can be teamed up with red ranked survivor players. This creates a very nasty bottleneck that isn't worth it in the end to really punch through. There is no benefit for killers to go higher in level.
---
In all actuality neither is it that beneficial for survivors either but because it gets easier for them it's less of an issue, but that is one of the reasons green ranked killers get red ranked survivors to go up against because there are that many red ranked killers in the first place. Adept achievements are all but impossible from Rank 11-10 onward unless you're super lucky that you get a potato team to play against which becomes very rare once you phase into the purple ranks.
---
There are so many killers that just de-rank to have fun again that BHVR really needs to look into this issue, but they don't because I don't think they know how to fix it themselves by this point.
---
LOL this is great.
---
What the hell happened here?
---
you can start undoing a trap, say like in a doorway where there's only one way to hit a survivor, and when the Trapper comes toward you you can let go as they swing and it'll trap them instead.
---
Killer is only solo que also u should probably add what system like console or PC.
---
Also I wanna add just a personal opinion but I think it's better if u learn from watching live games like Otz vids when he plays trapper or OhTofu usually makes some informative stuff.
---
The "I'm done" idle stance that killers have before they DC always gets me. He had a bruh moment.
---
Archives are toxic trash that we just want to get over with quickly. Isn't it better than killers use moris and top tiers to actually achieve something useful than just 4k camping to make everyone pip down and write "hehe ggez bad survivors get gud" ?
---
epic
---
No it's not when you can't get it work ever
---
"BuT fErAl FrEnZy Is So BaD nOw!"

"No, it's fine, you're just using it wrong."
---
"WoRsT kIlLeR iN tHe GaMe!"
---
If survivors could always see traps, then the number of survivors caught in traps would be at or near zero. If you're in the middle of a chase with trapper, it's a guessing game at a particular jungle gym if any given window, corner, or pallet is trapped. And as I recall, "guessing games" is what you're complaining about with Spirit.
---
Oh sorry. I'm on PC. And I was referring to custom games, aka "kill your friends".  
---
I have watched videos to prepare myself. I learn better by doing, though.
---
Mario &amp; Luigi: Paper Jam, I think
---
Ok thanks
---
You can do that, but you don't *need* to.
---
I haven't run Exhaustion perks in over a year and am much better for it.
---
Im sure the 4k and the 6k guy enjoyed the mori tunnel freddy
---
People saying that knowing whether she's using her power or not removes a mindgame from her don't realise you could just use her power and stand still.
---
Hit boxes are not broken it's latancy which dedicated servers have fixed by making it more consistent and I'll take that ant day over P2P being inconsistent.
---
And this is still not a reasonable reason to DC no reason is live with it or stop and wait for some good fixes but don't try to say hit boxes are broken bc they aren't
---
Long
---
Except literally no. As long as the interaction time is more than 5 seconds then it would mean that as long as the killer is nearby a survivor cant use a hatch, which i think is completely fair.
---
Adam as a survivor would be so cool man BHVR can goddamn bet that i would spend an unhealthy amount of money on that man
---
Its sad i cant use claudette or a flashlight without being lumped in with toxic trash
---
&gt;Brah, 80% of maps are in their favor
---
It's really not that hard to get a hit someone man. We are not talking tournament super players, it's red ranks soloQ survivors.
---
&gt;Billy does what Oni does for free.
---
Bullshit he does, Billy isn't even close to the level of Oni's charge control, not to mention the ridiculous flick at the end. Billy gets his power from the start, but Oni's power is miles ahead of Billy's.
---
&gt;At the beginning of the charge, Billy's saw can even make sharper turns. 
---
Good thing oni has no need for the turn at the start as he can run into walls and slide off of them.
---
&gt;Oni is easier to loop because he's so loud
---
I have no idea what you mean by that. Oni is harder to loop as he gets around corners ridiculously easily. Here, have an example: https://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulHorribleWeaselNerfRedBlaster
---
Billy can only work with straight lines, Oni curves in 180 degrees.
---
Tbh a lot of the time once someone is slightly sick, I'll just hit them instead of puke spamming if they'll reach a loop in time anyway.
---
Because if someone is getting chased you have nothing to do? Gens are your only objective.
---
Sorted by controversial
---
Oh lmao
---
It just shows how problematic her power is since she was considered trash when she had the bug where her husk would glow when phasing.
---
Nerfing her by giving feedback on the phasing will just completely gut her but keeping her like she is will let her overperform. Her power is essentially broken since i can’t see a way to balance it

This was me after I died on first hook after running the killer for 5 gens
---
This, straight girl here, you are way cuter
---
&gt; Yup! If someone farms the hook *and* the killer tunnels them right back onto the hook that's the same "2nd hook effort" as tunneling into a mori. If survivors don't want to lower the effort for a second down, they shouldn't farm hooks in the killer's face. 
---
Nope, still doesn't replace the 45 seconds you have to divert other survivors from saving them and is so much easier
---
There's no debate here you're just flat out wrong. 
---
&gt; You can also keep from getting flashlight/firecrackered by just *not* getting blinded which is trivially easy to do. 
---
Very low chance &gt; No chance. You have just as much chance to blind someone as any other moment.
---
You didn't even argue against my point. Just tried to sidestep it.
---
&gt; These scenarios aren't assuming you're going to camp the hook 
---
I never said you were going to camp the hook
---
Even the original commenter agrees with me fuck off with your dumb ass essays.
---
And he is never gonna play killer again
---
He just sucks cus you can shut him down so easily. And if you don't he easily creates a 3 gen situation and the survivors just stop playing
---
Perk: Burnt Marshmallow - If the killer is within 10 m of the survivor for more than 15s, survivor is granted Burnt Marshmallow allowing them to have a 100% unhook rate. Once they unhook themselves all hooks break for the remainder of the trial
---
Add ruin. 
---
You can't Franklin + frenzy. All on hit perks ignore feral frenzy hits.
---
Looks like someone doesn’t have enough gen pressure
---
What about Herblend Evasion
---
You obviously haven't seen a good demogorgon because no the fuck he doesn't lmao. A good demogorgon has insane map pressure and will wipe survivors no issue. Especially the ones who know when and how to use their giant ass lunge
---
I think it's a little too easy to rank up as survivor. Sometimes I'll have bad days and get caught immediately, farmed off hook and die without really doing much and yet somehow I'll still pip or at least black pip at red ranks.
---
Go nothing in your loadout if you're wanting a challenge
---
Go in a locker so you won’t get slugged with ds
---
&gt; without a time limit then it disables it
---
That defeats a purpose of an anti tunnel perk.
---
You could be unhooked, wait the entire match get to the EGC I down you fairly and then get D-Striked for no reason.
---
D-Strike is fine as it is, we really don't need to return to old D-strike.
---
There are perks worse than ds. Ds is an ok perk that can still come in handy it doesn’t need a buff. And no, I’m not a killer main.
---
then why does he havo such an low kill rate on the red ranks?
---
It wouldn't even let me swing. I couldn't move at all
---
I've been really fond of either Stridor/Bloodhound with the new broken pin.
---
break 1-2 survivors, find them ~8 seconds later, repeat.
---
Regardless of whether it’s dead or not it’s not useless here
---
Poor kiddo lose his useless rank! oh i'm so sorry!
---
That's like saying why does nurse have the lowest wr/kill rate, because people don't know how to use them effectively and the ones who do play them have no idea what they're doing. The statistics bhvr released don't mean shit.
---
Have you ever played any games with mouse and keyboard?  I'm asking this to establish a baseline.
---
i make the meme because i help to gens unhook and a guy just open the exit and stay stand looking me die
---
As a diehard saw fan I was fucking mad when I found out Tapp was the survivor for the saw chapter. A pretty damn minor character who was very forgettable and acted as the secondary antagonist of the film honestly (even if he was a good guy). Theres a reason not many people main him, hes a character who not many saw fans actually give a shit about/ connect with but at the same time has no good cosmetics for regular DBD players to like. 
---
Even if Dr Gordon became a pighead in saw 7 I think even he could work, I really hope they make a Saw Chapter 2 chapter someday with adam, even if its only like a paragraph like they did with ash.
---
Its not like there is anything else in the game worth doing. Playing well? gratz you now get longer queue times to play with the same shitters. Playing badly? wow the worthless rank system gave you a derank, like that matters at all. 
---
At this point the only fun thing about DBD is the aspect of ruining someone elses
---
The 'Merciless Killer' part is a stupid requirement that's more luck-based than skill based :/. The Onis perks have no effect on generator regression and defence, so if you're playing at high ranks it will be difficult.
---
No first time 🤣
---
Or the one urban evading right in front of you as you get picked up inside a pallet 😑
---
Um.... this is the most stupid question ever. You have to do gens to escape, the quicker you do the gens the quicker you can escape. What else is a survivor gunna do? Crouch in a corner for no reason for 5 minutes?
---
it could've been a way better meme if it was just something like "The Oni while waiting for a game". That would've been much better
---
Nurse just had an rework, people dont quite know how to play her and its low bc of the rank 20ish nurses. She has an high kill rate on pc red ranks. So now ur telling me red ranks dont know how to play demo after 3-4 months?
---
When u move ur camera while walking or running, ur character will walk or run the way the camera is facing. To solve that problem, just hold the A button if ur looking right, D button for left and S for behind. Kinda hard to explain but you’ll get it eventually
---
Mario and Luigi: Paper Jam. A crossover between Mario and Paper Mario. ...Yeah, I think it's weird, too.
---
I don't think you can hatch grab anymore.
---
I had a stroke reading this. I seriously can't understand half of it.
---
you need to look behind you and then press S to run "backwards". It's the same concept  on console
---
I rescued 2 people before the killer started chasing me
---
If by “has been established” you mean that people unhappy with the implications of the data have engaged in ad hoc rationalizations not grounded in anything but their own biases, then yes.
---
I used the A&amp;D keys to 'balance out' the camera turn with the mouse whilst holding W to keep moving forward; also in case you weren't aware you can use your ps4 controller on the pc version if you're more comfortable with it :)
---
Best way to learn killer is to play killer in real games
---
and when he camp i just wanna stop playing
---
Trapper is useful when you have good trap placement and good fundamentals. Put his traps in windows but also in unexpected places. He can be very map dependent at times but you want to trap pathways you think your subjects will go through. Add-one that work well would be (brown) trapper bag and (green) Tar bottle just a combo that won’t completely use your resources. Trapper bag lets you have an extra trap to transport being able to carry 2. Tar bottle makes the traps very dark.
---
Wraith needs good addons to be affective sadly. He can be used without them but it is a lot more difficult. While in cloak form he can interact with gens, pallets, and lockers but can’t hit survivors. After uncloaking you gain a small speed boost to catch up. My personal favorite add-on combo is (yellow) Swift hunt and (green) windstorm. Swift hunt uncloaks faster and windstorm gives you a speed boost in cloak form.
---
Don’t play Billy enough to help with him sry
---
Hope this helps.
---
I have to wait too long for a game as killer to disconnect
---
OK what you have to do is that when you spin the mouse around to look behind you . You have to hit the opposit key you're going so if you are going forward you spin around and look you have to at the backwards button. You'll find it's easier after you get used to it. Plus the mouse keyboard combination is a lot easier in first person's perspective so makes a killer easier to use.
---
If you get a survivor from Bulgaria and their crouch isn't a slav squat, would there even be any point to add one?
---
Pretty sure it just makes you bleed more
---
The ability to see the ranks was a bug, it was never intended. The game just went back to how it was, besides you only want to see the ranks because in the case you see a grey rank you'll just dodge the lobby thats what the devs want to avoid massive lobby dodging
---
I never understood that why it was different from survivor? I don't push myself like I used to so I float around rank 5-10 but when I play him I tend to 4k too quickly or not get any kills!
---
it indeed does
---
Ok thanks I'll edit it
---
Thanks
---
Do you need 4 or 3 &amp; a gold?
---
Lobby silhouettes have evolved I see, knew there was something fishy about them..
---
Becauae you didn't escape, the entity just let you go because its killer was a wimp
---
Yeah whisper is amazing.
---
Too bad it never fucking shows up in the blood web :P
---
I have 8 killers level 40+ and not a single one of them has whispers higher than level 2.
---
If I ever want to do a Monstruous Shrine/Spies From The Shadows build though...
---
I know all that work just to die on 1st hook
---
Man this is terrible. I never realised that it was merciless until after Gorgon and I had all the trophies so figured it can't be that hard. But I'm on like attempt 9 with Oni now :/
---
This pic is just cursed
---
1 buff i would give him is to recycle his portals like the hag
---
I swear, one day I'll go into cardiac arrest because of those traps.
---
I usually run ruin, barbecue, pop, and discordance on ghost face but everytime I purposely play like trash they usually gen rush me and act like they're top shit by t-bagging at the exit gate. It's difficult to rank up when I can never pip but you gave me great advice thank you.
---
Doubt the plague is from the Middle East. Definitely from South America or all the way up to Mexico.
---
My standoh (I can't think of anything)
---
What do you enjoy about Legion that you main them? I main Huntress because few things bring me more joy than the sound of a hatchet connecting
---
probably not, since it seems he was stuck inside the generator. It’s a bug right now.
---
Its the objective, killers objective is to kill, survivors to escape. They NEED to do Gens as quickly as possible, the faster they do them the higher the chance of everyone escaping
---
Saying that as if survivors IQ weren’t already low going against a killer they’re familiar with. HA!
---
I'll just go fuck off and cleanse a totem
---
Honestly, if all the survivors need to do to get an adept is escape, then all killers should have to do is get a 4k. It's really that simple.
---
Aweee Thankyou! ❤️❤️
---
y’all are so nice what the heck
---
Pretty sure it’s something to do with KYF/SWF. Don’t think you can do it by mistake. It will put a swf group with one bugged as killer into an unsuspecting killer’s lobby. Atleast that’s what it used to be .
---
Perfect perk 
---
Rush the gens the killer may get 1 kill but will lose 4 gens
---
The first match i tried oni,  i got called a bitch lol
---
#E g g
---
...Hey, ear ketchup! Wait, that's blood. ...Crap.
---
Unlimited power
---
You are obviously not a bug fan. Your burnt out and should take a break at the very least.
---
The shaft?
---
"Guys I think Nancy Wheeler is THICC af"
---
Yeah, that's also the reason why there are not too many graphic options in the setting. If you could change more things you could get an unfair advantage over other players.
---
I dont really remember what was it called. I remember that it spawns when you complete 3 gens
---
Good
---
Okay, you are literally the only one insulting skill level. I'm pointing out that you have little no idea about the games balance: unsafe pallets waste too much time on badham. The five seconds to get to one, the five seconds to drop it, another fifteen seconds for bloodlust because they are unmindgameable because the survivor can see you... And then they get to a safe loop with the speed burst and you have to give up or waste another minute or so to drop the pallet. This happens every time I go against a solid team, and I do it every time I'm caught in the open (yeah, yeah, I'm not the best survivor: sue me, that's kind of my point. The killer should catch me and they almost never do without a couple of gen pops. It's fucking stupid.)
---
I know what I'm talking about. Badham has an excess of guaranteed safe loops to make up for the unsafe loops, it's observable. Good survivors don't get caught out: they make a mistake, they go for a god loop with the speed burst. They don't make a mistake, they can waste another ten to fifteen seconds.
---
And don't use red ranks as an example, use a good squad. Anyone can 4k with any killer at red ranks: survivors have it easy when it comes to pipping. It's killers that take skill at red ranks, but even then, with the exception of a small few (nurse, spirit, Ghostface) the killer is fucked against survivors than an do gens and don't go down immediatly. No other killers can avoid the chase game and have good pressure. (Even Ghostface is dropping off now that people realised that going balls-to-the-wall is an effective strategy against him, too.)
---
Also, don't brag about not using slowdown perks: it shows off nothing but the fact you go against potato survivors that don't touch gens. Seriously, it's stupid, especially bragging about billy. The best billy in the world will always be wrecked by good survivors (it's mathematically provable given chase time/gen speed ratio, 3 minutes isn't enough for a win for either side and games can be SHORTER than that), so the game clearly isn't balanced, is it?
---
And just back to the first note, don't call someone out for insulting your skill level (which literally hasn't happened) and feed it straight into an insult about their maturity. It's incredibly degrading for the whole conversation. I insulted your understanding of the games mechanics, which you clearly lack since, once again, you brag about no-slowdown billy. And apparently your idea of a valid argument is 'you cant down good survivors every twenty seconds so it's your fault.' right, good argument, really shows off your knowledge of the game mechanics involved in a chase. The only conclusion I can come to is that you do not experience top-tier survivors, or do not think any killer (character) should be able to win them. Either way is pretty bad.
---
Seriously, I want your god damn survivors in my matches, I'm sick of half my games lasting under five minutes before three/four of them are out the door regardless of how fucking much I dominate in chases. I know from experience that most survivors lose those matches too, it's fucking stupid. I want your potato survivors. Gimme.
---
I still don’t get this I can literally see her when she’s phasing she glows like a fucking Christmas tree on ps4
---
Yes, it still would be Ultra Rarity. A good killer would be able to use an Ebony since they played correctly. Whereas how they are currently, any killer needs to win only one chase and can eliminate a survivor afterwards. It’s too cheap for how effective Ebony Mori are.
---
The problem is that would be disputed
---
Everyone keeps suing eschother for the rights
---
They mean while you were in the loop were you trying to move?
---
Legion and Chonky Jesus are both from the same town.
---
The real action begins at 20 seconds in (bad trimming, I know). Can The Oni open lockers while in Wrath mode or were we just small brain?
---
I’m not usually a fan of perk concepts on this is sub but damn these are interesting. I’d especially like to see how Sabotage and Interconnected work in practice. Only note I have is that Not Today is probably way broken and one protection hit doesn’t really warrant a stackable Endurance effect. Getting one stack for Mettle is 100 million times easier than getting three.
---
So let them go, or do you really not care that much? :)
---
I let the last survivor go all the time, especially if they played well, or had a terrible team.
---
Consoles don't play against Pc though.  I wanted to know if other console players felt the same.  I'm sure he feels different from my other characters, more sensitive.  I kept missing hits because the camera felt too fast etc...
---
Crazy... almost like they know their audience.
---
"wHo fED mYErS?"
---
His demon strike is absolute ass on console and is 100% bugged
---
I always hit them when the ruin is already gone...
---
Possibly bloodhound Over stridor and maybe adding blood echo, personally I never use addons.
---
it has happened by mistake many times
---
I desperately tried to do this with Rancor, but once survivors catch on that you have both, they start avoiding stuns like you have Enduring/Spirit Fury.
---
You have to use w a s d not just w lol.
---
Trapper I can teach but Otz can definitely teach more send me ur steam username either dm or not up to u
---
Ah, that's probably not me then, but I did have a game with similar characters where I grabbed a dwight off a generator, so you can understand my confusion
---
It’s the most fucking useless perk to your teammates but sure to you it’s amazing. I seriously just want to throw a brick at urbaning surirvors
---
Just gonna touch on a few things here which in theory sound good but again in reality.. don’t stack up. When you get a FINISHED product.. yes.. you should expect that product to work. When you buy a product that is still being moulded and re worked on a constant basis (as most games are now).. demand that it is continually updated/advanced upon while simultaneously expecting it to be the same quality as a finished product all along the way.. is ludicrous. Yes, people are “entitled” to an opinion. What they are not entitled to is expecting an entire dev team to be able to meet every stupid expectation they have. I like cars, I am entitled to my opinions on certain cars. I AM NOT entitled to expect every car manufacturer to make all of their cars to my liking. Part of that is the reason why there are multiple car companies.. and people have started their own when they can’t find what they want in the market. If I buy a damn Prius, I’d be nothing but an asshole if I spent any decent amount of time continuously driving it while bitching that it’s not a Porsche and that they should work on making a faster and better car. Also on that note, if I buy a Prius... and want aftermarket parts originally designed for a Porsche installed.. I should damn well expect that to take some work in order for anything to function properly which doesn’t happen at the snap of the finger. On top of that.. just because I am entitled to have my opinions on cars in NO WAY means I am a qualified source of feedback on critical matters.. just like 95% of people who use almost any product these days from games, cars, internet.. can comment whatever the hell they want.. it does not mean they know the hell what they’re talking about. And this is the crux of the problem I was pointing out. People assume SIMPLY because they’ve bought a game.. or play games... they have even the slightest clue about what’s beneficial to longevity or progress... and yet... here we are years into this.. people flood in to talk shit about the game full knowing it has issues (part of the popularity even BEING that it has issues) only to jump on the bandwagon of bitching with their 20hours in the game proclaiming they have solutions to shit far over their heads, demanding changes that effect numerous things then complaining all over again when things aren’t working properly. And like I said specifically this spreads to the forums.. where devs then take advice from angry teens because if enough people cry about something EVEN if it’s a non factor, it gives the appearance of an “important” matter then further effecting the future balance or functionality of the game purely because some people can’t fathom their opinions don’t hold any weight whatsoever. The game... works. To say that it doesn’t.. is ludicrous. So the argument “they are entitled to expect it to work” damn well doesn’t apply here and sounds more like “But people who spend money on things are entitled to whatever they want even if their definition of broken is wrong or convoluted and the product functions doesn’t matter.. they expect it to work.”  What they want is no problems which is far off.     
---
    
---
If it was bricking consoles... I’d agree with you. If people were LITERALLY not able to play the game.. I’d agree with you. Buuuut... that’s not the case. If you buy a console and expect the same frame rates as a PC... you’re a dumbass. If you’ve bought a game in any recent time and expect it to be flawless the moment you play it.. you’re a dumbass. If you bought a game that notoriously has issues because of constant changes then decide to constantly complain about says issues... you’re a dumbass. If you pay for ANYTHING in life and always expect it to be 100% exactly up to your exact (exaggerated and non logical) expectations... you’re a dumbass. If you happen to think that Billy is unplayable on console like OP... you’re a dumbass. But of course.. people are still be “entitled” to hold any of those opinions, they just shouldn’t expect to be taken seriously... to never be called out.. or.. when companies inevitably start making decisions/changes based on THEIR incorrect opinions.. expect the game to pan out the way they had it planned in their big brains.
---
How? I don’t see it happening by mistake. If the way is the same as it used to be you have to be trying to get it to work. One of the killers will have no idea it’s happened until they’re ingame but that doesn’t mean THEY did it by mistake because they didn’t do anything lol
---
Wait can’t you get banned for doing this?
---
really depends game to game, and how i’m feeling on that day, but i will 100% let the last surv go if i know they’ve had a bad game or if their team has been garbage haha
---
I noticed this too, I got downed as Nancy and couldn’t hear her making any noise, I just thought I was deaf lol
---
Of course I lost almost nothing, that's just stuff you would normally do when you apologize for some bugs in your game ?
---
At least, that's what I see in other games
---
Ughhh I'm so sick of you survivors whining. You are literally ruining this subreddit with all of the negativity. Just stop playing and go on about your day and let the rest of us who are grown adults enjoy it.
---
My name ain't Karen
---
Be more faithful, man.
---
*"This is Trap Experience Trappuiem, not even my user, Evan McMillan, knows of this."*
---
More killers playing than survivors, so the killer time is higher
---
On Ps4 atleast where i live its backwards, i get a lobby as killer in 2 seconds and survivors arrive in like a minute.
---
For survivor though..dear god, i hated doing the survivor challenge because of all the time I wasted waiting, and it made me extra salty if i didnt complete the challenge
---
Hell yea
---
well maybe get better Friends?
---
No way I'm tossing aside my main girl ❤
---
What issue?
---
I agree. If you are not using a mori, sacrifices should put your score at a minimum point: 2 kills guarantees a brutal, with a possibility for ruthless, 3k guarantees a ruthless with a possibility for merciless and 4k guaranteed merciless. That's my opinion at least.
---
The thing is.. it is balanced about 2 kills and 2 survives. So every game there could be 2 survivors who get the adept, but no killer would get their adept.
---
&gt;What else is a survivor gunna do? Crouch in a corner for no reason for 5 minutes?
---
I see you've met my teammates.
---
Lol.
---
It's called the hatch
---
I once scared the shit out of a Pig by doing that. I was wearing the Jeff make-up and in post-game chat she said she almost fell off her chair
---
Tfw you're blinded, click your left mouse and hear a scream.

Hvilket språk er spillet ditt på? // Which language are those bloodpoint categories?

No, got it wrong.

"This is wasting my time, congratulations, you won, can I play another game please now?"

go read that
---
I'm still mad that game is shutting down. It was such a good game too. It's one of those games I'd switch to if I wasn't in the mood to deal with DBD and the scavengers and hunters all looked and played badass
---
Reminds me of survivors that just stand at the gate.
---
Could say the same about the wake up bug
---
I kinda like all of them
---
How can people abuse his portal, he has a cooldown after travelling, if he wants to camp he wouldnt even use the portals.
---
Lmao wait you actually were serious? I thought you were doing a dirty little joke there
---
r/uselessnobody
---
This one even goes against what nobody was meant to mean and doubles down on it.
---
Heavy blow is busted looks great
---
&gt;Reminds me of survivors that just stand at the gate.
---
Which got addressed by the devs through the addition of EGC.
---
Now devs need to address killers refusing to allow survivors from leaving the game.
---
Are you actually interested in discussing this or you just want to do some unrelated remarks lol?
---
As the creator of this meme. I personally don’t care that there was a basement bug but it’s good to make memes about things while they’re still relevant. Hell, I was one of the ones putting survivors in the basement ;) but all my memes that I put on Reddit and made for my IG community. I just post them on here cause sometimes people like them. Most times however you get an SJW in the comments
---
Oof
---
''things yoy can pull survivors off:''
---
''(...), other survivors''. 
---
Am I the only one who thought he was doing a dirty little joke there?
---
I dont think he can.. at least I haven't tried.
---
Unintentional pun I like it

This is Reddit. 99% of it is just circlejerking, memes and salty people spouting shit about stuff they dont understand. 
---
To add to the post: I think you should be able to speed up your bleed out timer if you aren't picked up. Like to the point where you die within 5 seconds.
---
Nah man i get it youse a Karma Whore

All cool!

Low fps and Max sensitivity being not fast enough are two major factors

I think they're worried you're gonna kill them

it is about 7 days until rank reset and matchmaking doesn't want to put u against stupidly high survivors so yes in rank 20 it is normal

You love mosquitoes?

im in this picture and i dont like it

Oh dang I didn't know any of that. Yeah that's all pretty bad.
---
( I don't think my eyes will ever be the same)

Absolutely.
---
What perk is that the picture looks badass
---
Aw okay am I the only one who genuinely thinks that was super cute of the Meg to help you out there? Wholesome Meg
---
That's the problem :( I can't get into any real games. I think it's having a hard time finding me a compatible match since I'm rank 20 on killer. Thank you for your advice though. I agree with you 100%.
---
Why would you swing when you're blinded lol
---
Hex:higher stakes
---
If surv misses a skillcheck he is put into injure state, if surv already injured he is put into dying state.
---
I have an anti face camp build, It's deliverance, Breakdown, DS and Unbreakable. Basically, don't go down first, get a save and boom, if u get face camped, ur set
---
Uhmm I do
---
Fucks sake. If you have a hundred dollars. And each worker costs 10 dollars. You can hire 10 workers. Assuming a linear progression on work if you hire 5 programmers and 5 artists your stuff will only get finished half as fast as if you hired 10 programmers and no artists. Obviously they use the cosmetics to monetize the game so they should spend money on artists but it still indirectly affects the progress made on fixes and new content.
---
Am I the only one that didn’t know wrath is African
---
Thank you! :)
---
I‘m sadly not a QuenFan ^^‘ sorry. My next project is the Spirit :) and a few other Nea outfits.
---
I think for survivor escaping is auto pip and for killer 4K is auto pip.  Thats how it should be and then if you do a bunch of extra shit you get the double pip.  It’s so fucking stupid right now because the better you do the worse your bloodpoints. And that goes for both sides.  It’s fucking insane to me that you get punished for being too good a killer or survivor.
---
The ultimate counter to this, in my opinion, is to treat them like nothing happened. After all, they are successful in their toxicity only after you change your usual playstyle because of it. You can choose to not give them that satisfaction.
---
How does it feel being a pendantic ass for no reason but jerking yourself off?
---
Her lore
---
Btw sorry about my subtle roast at the end, but I'm kind of impressed to note that some people seem to be familiar with canonical backgrounds.
---
I just assumed as the rest of my former mentioned cast technically lived a normal life to a certain point with the usual development (even though if you were to ask r/dbdgonewild anything can be interpreted sexually if you have the right kinks).
---
I'm also not even going to question why we are casually debating over the sexual intercourses of a cast of murderous psychopaths.
---
Pepehands.
---
No one has said she was "gutted" since like day two of her rework. Everyone still realizes how strong she is.
---
The survivor player base boneheadedness keeps legion viable. I'm so sick of starting the match with three other solo players...
---
Yea this needs to be addressed. Like ik killers had it bad in the past but Jesus. How easy does it have to be for them
---
Lol no, no infinite killer shack pallets please.
---
I use Bond/Empathy, Borrowed time, Dead Hard &amp; We'll make it.
---
jUsT bUy A pC
---
Those corn maps are fucking insane. You got the corn in general, the Torment Creek infinite, the Cow Shed double loop bullshit, the horrible fucking totem spawns, and then the fact that everything is yellow which fucks people with colorblindness in the ass and sideways
---
Before the Oni:
---
Bond/Spine Chill/Balance Landing/Iron Will
---
Sometimes I use Lithe &amp; Dance with me instead of BL &amp; IW
---
Now:
---
Bond/Spine Chill/Lithe/Iron Will
---
Yamaoka isn't as bad. Just really fucking dark
---
The best is when you swap to Lightborn last second and then down them after their first pallet because they're so sure the Sun shines out their ass/flashlight.
---
id use bbq, rancor, pop, and the last perk of your choice
---
It says that she is from Babylonia/Mesotopamia, and not Romania.
---
Problem with that is that the killer will see that red light so they'll know you are at that exit gate so they will look for you. I know I personally won't leave that gate if I know you are there
---
&gt;Totally. When they 99 doors save teammates open doors and have time to stand about. Yeahhhhhhhhhh
---
EGC wasn't made to give killers free kills or add more pressure to survivors, it was made specifically to allow KILLERS to end the match whenever they want if the requirements are met. 
---
99ing% a door is a smart way to play AND the killer can still open it if he wants the match to be over.
---
Stay awake as much as possible
---
If the killer finds me and I have an item on me I drop it in hopes that my humble sacrifice will appease the killer so he might let me go.
---
Not mad when it doesn't work and when it works it makes me quite happy.
---
I'm a schweaty Rank 1 Survivor so I use  
---
Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, and Self Care.  
---
I usually go away from it a bit. To me a fun build is to take out Self Care for something else so I can live on the edge. And I usually take out DS for BT if I'm playing with my friend.
---
I got my DS yesterday, still haven't seen it in the bloodweb yet for any of the 4 characters I play
---
A high ranking spirit will use stridor to counter iron will.
---
Wraith has a literal fucking candle skin
---
Easily high B or low A
---
Hooks op, BHVR plz nerf
---
Beats me, it’s happen to me before, in the post game chat, after a grabbed a survivor off a generator, they said I suddenly teleported behind them.
---
What if the scream turns me on tho?
---
&gt;Suvivors can die. No way you can dispute this.
---
I've had killers constantly pick me up, refuse to hook me, refuse to allow me to work on a generators and refuse to leave me slugged.
---
How do I leave a game like this?
---
Because sometimes the potato survivors stick nearby trying to juke you and you can hit them.
---
You bet I do.
---
Yeah I know. But saying egc stops survs sitting at gates is wrong lmao. If the killer is still playing to win and they have to open the doors to start egc then he’s probably in a winning position and gonna use blood warden. 99 door is smart never said it wasn’t
---
Demogorgon, my favourite American citizen
---
You’d literally need to be like right up on them for it to work. It’s definitely an interesting perk I just dunno how useful it’d be
---
The best way to counter him:
---
1)*Die*
---
This actually made me laugh really hard.
---
I could leave the banished realm because you can still walk even though you cant see shit. I was playing with a friend nearby me and as soon as i was going upstairs i could ser again.
---
Nemesis.
---
Is this rank 21?
---
Don't forget console's godawful framerate along with the cornvision.
---
***flashback to OoO countering stealth killers***
---
Seems America is a dangerous place
---
Glad they got what they deserved. That second hit was broken though.
---
Kwf?
---
Wait so why did Mortal Kombat get him? Did they sue him or did he come out on that game before the lawsuit thing?
---
Quality meme take an upvote
---
What rank are you.
---
You get to just go into the next game. Fucking rough dude. Fucking crybaby survivors. does it suck? Yeah. Is it this big of a deal? Not even remotely close.
---
Killers have Mori and tunneling to make survivors day suck. Survivors have about 15 perks and items that make the killers day shit. Cry elsewhere.
---
It is not an anti-tunnel perk and you know it. Within those 60 seconds you can down and hook someone else. The original person can get healed and then start running around the map again. So you down them. Then boom! DS
---
Give me a break
---
0:35 PRETTY GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
When Obi activates blood fury when he has nemesis activated on you
---
The devs have made a statement about it, actually. They won't go out of their way to ban you, but if the Anti-cheat decides to ban you, they won't help you.
---
However, there have been no reports of anyone getting banned for using custom icons. So I think it's relatively safe to use them. :)
---
Kill Your Friends.
---
It's what custom games used to be called.
---
&gt;Yeah I know. But saying egc stops survs sitting at gates is wrong lmao. 
---
But it does? If the killer can't be bothered to push them out and they don't leave in 2 minutes, they die. Once all gens are done, the start of this timer is in the killers hand. 
---
&gt;If the killer is still playing to win and they have to open the doors to start egc then he’s probably in a winning position and gonna use blood warden
---
Again, EGC wasn't made to shift the balance towards killers at the end of the match, it was made simply to give killers a tool to force the match to end without relying on survivors.
---
When all gens are done in 3 minutes even with map pressure, it kind of did. They both readily bad bugs honestly
---
Wouldnt be better to just follow where they are going?
---
Yep, it is.
---
What? Queue time are literally faster than survivor at red ranks. As survivor i have to wait like 3 or 4 mins as killer i get lobbys in a min it really depends on your rank
---
Can confirm i bounce from red to purple ranks so around there is when you'll see tough matchups on both sides for me
---
Poor killer. Hunt is no fun when your prey doesn't move
---
I use 60%
---
Usually grass sound or moaning without iron will is loud af
---
Literally anything
---
Very true, cleansing across the map from where the gens are is safe bc a smart plague will know it’s not worth it to go all the way over there and collect it
---
*Laughs in PC
---
I has been changed appearently. Her Name was probably Enatsu in an earlier version and they changed it at some point.
---
Okie dokie buddy you too
---
They should just make you hold down the button or not hold it all for struggling :/
---
Nice one!
---
Ah, so the brightness isn't just my TV.
---
This could’ve saved me a couple of times lol
---
I don't completely understand your point. Are you saying I'm good?
---
I was use 100% to help with jukes
---
"hello"
---
sorry for my english
---
If you're getting easy downs by triggering FF recovery and M1ing injured people, you're playing against bad survivors.
---
I like to run Sprint Burst, Decisive Stirke, Iron Will and Lightweight or Spinechill depending on the day.
---
Any other neat tricks for other killers?
---
I feel like this game has given me Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Meh. I’m slowly thinking of converting over too, but I’m just going to wait until Yui gets some better cosmetics that’ll soothe my taste though.
---
That's great and and all, but Plague is technically countered by No Mither as well.
---
Who the fuck traps gates like that
---
The Ace Club has joined the chat.
---
When a big brain pig main downs a survivor in 15 seconds: "Oh you poor boosted fool."
---
When a virgin legion main downs a survivor in 15 seconds: "SEE?! LEGION'S NOT A BAD KILLER!"
---
Adrenaline or Dead Hard or Sprint Burst (depending on how I feel), Dstrike, Inner Strength and WGLF because I'm a BP whore.
---
I try to sit in rank 11 or 10 if I can bc purple ranks are a bit sweaty and red ranks I stay the fuck away from
---
it helps both for end game builds and it also gives him perk synergies with PGTW.
---
Honestly, this is true as fuck
---

Hell no. Yui is a badass biker girl. That's quite different from being a cute gamer girl. The only similarities between them is thr fact that they're both asian.
---
Her ponytail is nice. If she had a bit more like Akali from LoL it'd be absolutely perfect.

Mines 70% for 360s and being able to loop and look around quickly.  I find 80% + was a little high

Well everything indirectly affects how fast things work so its not really fair to say they could spend more money *here* instead of *here*. Yes, having more people on the development team would speed things along but its not like the art team is hindering the entire process to a large degree like op alluded to by just existing. In your hypothetical scenario where the money was that limited yes, they could have a higher potential for development time but that is always true no matter what. Art team or no, by this argument they could also take out voice actors and every other part of the company just to hire more programmers. So while you are right down to a technicality I don't feel its a fair argument to make.
---
Depends how they played, if they played well and you think they deserve it then yeah. But in just a normal match, they don’t deserve it just cause their team mates didn’t pull their weight, that’s just unlucky. You never need to give them anything, but if you get the hatch given to you, that is one nice killer. He’s potentially losing out on ranking up on you.
---
Who cares what any of these dork ass nerd complaining killer mains think? They heard the word "toxic" and haven't shut up since. Because everything that any survivor does, like using tool boxes, using med kits, doing gens even when it's your only objective, any perk build that doesn't make you a potato, or using any cosmetic that isn't a target painted on your back and just standing their taking a hit when they find you, is considered "toxic." Like yeah, do people like the survivor in this video suck? Yeah. It's hella obnoxious. But these asshats are just as guilty of dong shitty things in game, but when you call them out on it they get offended and try to justify their playstyles and tactics. Just play the game how you want to play, dude. Because ultimately it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks. Using things that are at your disposal in the game is not toxic. No one else in this game is responsible for anyone else's fun.
---
Is it just me or shouldn't the Trapper be affected by his traps? I mean... He's the only killer who's power hurts himself
---
But because of a survivors quick movements they can easily dodge and 360 Oni’s dash and slam on console. That’s the problem. Scott Jund describes Oni’s dash as an instant chase ender and his gameplay with Oni on PC proves that. Because the PC survivors and console survivors are so similar, console and PC Oni need to be comparable too in order for him to be viable.
---
Oni also has built in STBFL on it's normal M1's in demon form (as opposed to his 1 shot lunges)
---
I like to run Spine Chill, Distortion, Balanced Landing (Yeah I know it was nerfed but I still like it), and Borrowed Time.
---
What honor is there to be found in Blendettes?
---
It takes someone like 90 seconds to die on hook. 80 seconds to do a gen, solo. Trading 3 gens for 1 player is a lot better than trying to rescue and dying. Punish the killer for camping. 
---
Trying to guard the doors is often impractical; many killers will secure a kill if there's on the table, in endgame. NOED rarely feels good, but I'd accept it. The killer getting 1 kill out of 4 is typically a depip for them unless multiple people were on death hook. You still won.
---
Thanks and bet it is
---
One time I black pip with a game of 2k and 31,200 points the next game I pip with 4k 26000 points the devs have the filosofy of balanced games of 2 death 2 survivors they are very dumb
---
Youd be surprised how many ppl still whine, especially on steam forums.
---
I only ever do it to survivors who have jerks the whole game. I just think its funny to see all hope leave them and replaced with salt.
---
I still don't get it, I never said or implied that the killer had no chance against me. I clearly got caught in the story. I'm just saying that I held my own in a chase for a very reasonable amount of time, and my team could have done several gens or at the very least got ruin in that time.
---
They put capital into cosmetics as an investment that brings more money for the company as a whole which allows them to enlarge teams like the development team. It all comes full circle in the end. I still stand by my belief that the art team doesn't hinder the process of the other departments, the artists are doing their job while programmers are doing their's. If they needed more people to fix the issues of the games they would hire more people. Instead of saying they focus too much on the art team it would be more fair to say that they don't focus enough on the development team. One team shouldn't be blamed because another team doesn't get enough love.
---
Also I chose to address a part of his statement. I don't have to address everything in his post because one point he made irked me. I stated that I wasn't going to touch on the issue of bugs themselves because I felt that it wasn't necessary so I feel like I didn't discard anything unfairly.
---
You get the hatch if you don't BM, if you don't wiggle, and if you were trolled by one of your survivor teammates. 
---
There was a survivor who was clearly playing with his SWF while I was trying to learn killer. Played the worst out of the 4, yet was the only one to BM as if he did anything. Managed to catch him out, took him to the hatch, then closed the hatch on him and hooked him anyway. Post game rage from him was funny as hell.
---
I was weighing between 1/2/3 token stacks and 2/3/4 stacks. I went with the latter cause I felt the first was too little, but idk now. Maybe if it wouldn't work when you're exhausted instead making you broken? Then that way a survivor would have to choose between Adrenaline and Not Today if they're looking to avoid noed or something

All these post about "Legion is unplayable" are grinding my gears. Same with "Pig Nerfs". I can't believe people really think that "Nemesis" not working on Legion like on the PTB is a NERF. Goddammit, the old Legion changed for a reason! Besides that, M1 Perks should've not worked with his power in the first place. Because that's the goal Behavior is amining for: Only basic M1 attacks trigger Sloppy, STBFL and whatever I'm missing out. 
---
And I totally agree that his Frenzy still needs some buffs. I'd love to see a faster cooldown.
---
Thanks for you posts! You are the tiny shiny glimmer in this dark reddit. &lt;3
---
Was good yeah, she was decent with that dead hard as well. Was a good video, I enjoy watching lesser known people, was just explaining your reasoning behind what you were doing and talking throughout the game so that’s the main thing really. Don’t think any other content creators for this game do anything else, unless you played like a few games and edited them to play like the main moments from each game. TrU3 uploads full gameplays and is entertaining alongside it so that works for him. Long as you are talking throughout most of it, will be great content :D.
---
Legion Nerf:
---
-Instead of Feral Frezny he  default dances
---
-He's given plastic spoon, which survivors can take from him
---
-When Legion does not have his spoon he fucking kills himself
---
He is and he isn't. While yes, traps are near impossible to see, gens are all so spread out that it's tough to get a good 3-gen perimeter to set up your traps for optimal effect. Good survivors will be able to easily evade your perimeter of death and still get every gen done.
---
However, if you get someone in the center basement it's pretty much the most free win you'll have ever. Basement is surrounded by dense foliage and the building above it has a ton of stairs and blind 90-degree turns, it's basically free real estate.  You can just trap every possible direction and people will 100% run into your traps and even if they disarm one you can set up new ones while they're saving/healing down there.
---
&gt;I was specifically talking about being the last survivor
---
Yeah that's what I meant sorry didn't make it clear. I want my bloodpoints for a good game but i can't be arsed to wait 5 minutes to bleed out while the killer refuses to hook me and stands there nodding, even though I haven't acted in a way to warrant it.
---
Yeah happened something like that to me yesterday with more than 2 killers who slug for the 4k, but instead of wanting the 4k, they wait for someone to dc because they know about the bans...And I really want to dc just to give hatch to the other one (because the killer already knows and Im trying to get him away as far as I can), but I dont want to eat a ban just because the killer is a piece of shit...

If you try to do this juke while injured youre stupid except if u have iron will

Thought i went deaf between moments
---
I wish they kept the trap auras instead of getting close to the trap and not seeing the aura. There was literally no reason to do that, it's just an inconvenience.
---
Link please?
---
Thanks bro
---
Don't be silly, Bubba just wants a hug.
---
you mean rank 1 toxic ds goals after they get unhooked by 3 people right in front of the killer
---
Yes it’s german.
---
New mori is just him phasing his arm through you.

*Sidious Voice* Good Good!
---
Well his bio literally says he's from Argentina.
---
Don’t really care for all the technical stuff. All I know is that I’m getting hit when I shouldn’t be. Not talking about pallet drop hits, but just actual swings missing me by a few feet yet still hitting me. 
---
I also don’t care if it’s latency or hotbox related. What I do know is that it’s dedicated servers related. On p2p with green connection I never had this bullshit but on these whacky servers i do have this problem. 
---
Are you telling me you haven’t noticed an increase in weird/dodgy hits on dedicated servers? Also you instantly think I’m a noob3 fan. I ain’t. I’m more into puppers,Monto, truetalent and some others but yeah not noob3 because he has always had shitty internet. 
---
So yeah I’ve experienced and seen these dodgy hits happening on myself and a couple of streamers. So you can make it as technical as you want but dedicated servers are absolute cancer to play on and have been since they came out
---
You did say the killer had no chance *against a team of your skill level*, you just may not have realized it. Averaging 1-2 minute chase times means a game loss for killer.
---
Plus that challenge where you have to escape without being hooked. Thanks for that one devs.
---
The Spirit, the Wraith, the Hag and Susie are all pretty nice. Michael and the Clown made me laugh, I cannot imagine the Demogorgon wearing clothing.
---
Everyone else is kinda "meh"
---
Oh wow that dumb. It gives you blood points and an emblem for escaping right? It should count towards challenges
---
On sanctum of wrath, there's 2 rocks you can't pass between. Sorry for low quality, potato pc

---
*Oh I am not like the Flash at all, some would say I am the Reverse*
---
if the last survivor was camping pallets/sandbagging I’ll gladly taunt them with hatch.
---
Don’t really care for all the technical stuff. 
---
then stop talking about stuff u dont understand it is bc people like u that miss information is spread
---
Aowijg you to hold down during the struggle phase would be so handy and would definitely help in making the game a little bit more accessible for people who may not be as able to button mash such as people with repetitive strain injuries or arthritis.
---
after you safely unhook someone your next hook yeet attempt is 100%, but youre broken for like 60 seconds
---
u missed the second shot... u dont deserve that down
---
Bro 60 seconds is more than enogh time to find some one else and join them and find them again at times it’s not always tunneling
---
probobly doing the escape tome or escape witouth being downed and just hoping for the hatch. This is the main problem with these challanges.
---
The only part I don’t like about it is the drums but the other parts are really well put together.
---
Killer queues have always been ass at rank 20, and now that Oni is out everyone is trying to play him
---
Bowser really didn't think that one through, didn't he?
---
How's that? Anything specific you have in mind?
---
The Sekiro memes got me not gonna lie. Good video!
---
Jeff and Legion are both from Alberta. How Ormond is described, it's most likely west Alberta in the Rockies. Seeing as The Legion is 4 people, if you want to go off the main one, Frank, he's from Calgary.
---
You can still use your ears when blinded
---
The new Kindred also help with this significantly
---
A few times when I was last survivor alive, I've managed to trick out the killer by getting one gate to the first red light to make them think I'm going for it, but instead sneak past killer to the other gate and get it opened while they're occupied trying to find me at the first gate. Won't work with Whispers, but it's usually the best shot.
---
I've never heard or seen a sprint burst or gen bug
---
Cute
---
You say that not as a killer you would be 360'd so hard you would never hit them the movement with a mouse is lightyears better. You just can't do the same with a thumb stick and I'm sure the same thing is true with survivor

If someone is toxic never blame a killer for targeting them.

I really thought Nurse would be somewhere in the UK from her outfits and all looking Victorian.

Dudeeee why did I not even think of that.  We have bill, we totally should have 1 of the special infected as a killer!

That is fucking terrifying.

Hello there
---
Imagine seeing that light up in game
---
Aren't there colorblind configurations as monitor profiles and filters, as well as in windows options?
---
Thanks for that I honestly didn’t know how many blood points you earn when you make it out
---
yes but I am not a fucking dumbass that blames hitboxes bc for the 50th time IT IS LATENCY NOT HITBOXES
---
Exactly my point.
---
i don't have a camping playstyle? unless i see immediate scratch marks or a person by the hook, i leave pretty much immediately. and i only return to the hook after an unhook if it makes sense based on my position. otherwise i go to the gens in the vacinity just in case they stopped by there
---
Better than waiting 15 minutes per game and the game population needs it anyways
---
Kick a gen, get stuck in the generator for rest of match.  Happened 4 times last night.

Sprint burst has an interaction with vaulting that allows you to retain sprint burst infinitely if you do it right.   Still EASILY reproducible

---
True, not much is known about his origin but he did reside in PA when the infection broke out
---
This is really nit picky but I don't know why people keep saying this . OP clearly hit the skill check.
---
Yea I guess your right :(  I just hate putting in all the work only to not make out at the end haha I always hope the killer notices that I’m the only one doing everything and let’s me go lol sadly it hasn’t happened yet
---
Yeah that's what i said
---
New killer just came out so queues are gonna be hell unfortunately
---
Ooo thankyou for this feedback! Im going to record the daily missions and the 4th level archives so i have a constant upload every day so hopefully practice makes perfect xD!
---
Was about to upvote but noticed the title. You could've literally typed in "Title" and it would've been better.
---
I saw on twitter it is a known bug
---
Could add "Killer takes me to the exit gate"
---
I've not only never seen that in game but I've also never seen that on this sub I view daily. Maybe make your own post about it?
---
100% agree and you should let them be sacrificed so you can escape if the killer camps of course
---
yeah, as a killer i thought I sucked and gens flew till I squeezed to rank 9~ after that the game could keep as long as 3 min without a single generator being worked on since everyone was together helping out in a chase. I mean.. they are better than other ranks, but not quite fond of doing gens for what i’ve seen
---
Wait there is a basement bug ?
---
Does it matter what I call it? The problem is with dedicated servers. So if my post was about latency and not hit boxes you would have agreed with me? Doubt it since you knew what I was talking about but didn’t use the right words.
---
He's gonna head out.
---
Yeeehh, I have played gainst some Yuis that had it. It is both funny and annoying seeing them just run in circles around you xD
---
yes it fucking does u dont call a car a bike now do you and yes if  u correctly ranted about latency then I wouldnt have a issue bc u would be correct
---
Public Schools\*, leave the private schools with real teachers out of this.
---
Do you think every legion hits people more than once while in frenzy?
---
That was an abandoned perk or something
---
This happens to me but I'm the killer
---
Legion and Nurse’s asthma would like to have a chat with you.
---
That’s a thing? That explains why I’ve been blowing through the med kits I bring faster than expected.
---
These changes in my opinion were overall buffs. Any "nerf" aspect of the changes were more annoying than actual strengths while all the buffs they got are actually making him smoother, letting him cross the map faster, get hits more reliably etc. I played a few games on new legion and i assure u play him like a default m1 killer who gets a free hit, go enduring spirit fury and you will have so much success on his current form than u used to before
---
Had a game yesterday where two people dc'd within the first 2 minutes of the game. I still ran around did 4 gens by myself and 1/4 of the last one still while getting chased a lot by huntress, got rid of her ruin and the other dull totems. No idea what the last teammate was doing. Seemed like they were just hiding the whole time. Luckily near the end the killer  was just letting me hit her with pallets, told me at the end game chat they felt bad for the DC's and the fact they saw me doing everything with no help of the other person. 
---
   I'm no way a high rank but still some people are no fun to have as teammates at any rank.
---
Who cares? Diversity of race and background isn't enough? We also have to have "country of residence" diversity now?
---
It's a game made by a North American team. It's going to feature a lot of North American characters, because that's the culture they know. This is not a problem.
---
It's been logged in the official forums.  Sprint Burst bug gets deleted here every time its posted because the mods are survivor mains and don't want it revealed.
---
You can tell the huntress is from da hood
---
"Pippity poppity give me the zoppity"
---
The usual killer build with Ruin,BBQ,Pop goes the weasel and a 4th perk of your choice doesn't really matter and is more of a personal choice. Try to save his power for the best time to use it such as a unhook or if the survivor is in the open and it will have a high chance of getting a down.
---
P3 claudette here... Happens EVERY GAME AND I LOVE IT!

Bad cosplay. Nea doesn’t look half as good.

Check for an update or restart the game

Australian chapter please?

damn I got to read more lore

I didn't think they could make a bottom tier killer, worse. But they sure did.
---
Name 5.

I said in MY post if you read,  I run DS but guess when it doesn't work? When you're instantly mori'd that is exactly what this is about lololol. Sooo, to say ds or unbreakable makes no sense. 
---
I rarely used insta heals,  just on nights like last night when I was getting shit on EVERY game and tunneled non stop.
---
I did it, but there is another problem. When I try to play killer some '' internet connection error'' shows up
---
What
---
Are you on Console?
---
I expect this to be deleted within...1 hour.
---
The devs are Canadian.
---
For anyone wondering: Rancor, Unnerving  Presence, Adrenaline and Decisive Strike
---
That's server latency, not hitboxes. Hatchets have been funkier than usual for both sides since the dedicated severs got introduced.
---
Ebony moris are a delicious thing...
---
Wait didn’t the wraith move to America it said that he was a immigrant
---
Yes, I forget to say it sorry
---
Like how you placed Huntress close to Europe in stead of a random area of Russia as she is known to have killed several German Soldiers in WW1  (as the the German soldiers are said to be attacking the “collapsing Russian Empire” which began in WW1.) that could have only occurred if ‘the Red Forest’ was nearer Europe otherwise, the Germans would have never had to pass through the Red Forest.
---
Only in this game.
---
Mine updated but now I can’t connect to any games. Has anyone had this issue?
---
*hears oni scream in distance and spine chill lights up*
---
Also his last name is Ojomo I believe. And I always thought that in his original skins those little “twig” things on his head are short dreads. And in one of the other skins he has dreadlocks made out of chains so yeah.
---
Yea your right! I guess I’m still too narrow minded about escaping that I don’t realize I did good 
---
Thankfully they changed the pip system it used to be so terrible T.T
---
Vaguely Russian is good enough I guess:D
---
Same problem on Xbox. Can’t connect to any games

Spooky mans is the killer, he was trying to let her live because of a teammate dc

OKG THE BEAT PERKS YES

Ghostface killed in Philadelphia

African immigrant I believe.

This be wholesome as fuck
---
We could make Sleight of Hand an early game perk, something like Corrupt intervention but every minute and a half one of the fake hex totems get extinguished or something
---
don’t mind me asking how comes your clothing and perks are so colourful??
---
Yeah, and sadly I don’t have enough to get them and won’t be able to play until next Friday
---
Western game studio makes western characters for game. What a surprise.
---
rip
---
I'd like to see a killer or survivor from Australia or tasmania.
---
1. Moris. 2. Bbq. 3. Insidious. 4. Iron grasp, when a killer uses it to basement hook you every time. Aka the trapper. 5. iri hatchets. 6. Judith's tombstone. I mean is that a good start orrrr?
---
I though so based on these two skins that were released for Ace and Nurse based around WW II. They really give off the British vibe.
---
💀
---
lmao
---
Hahahahahahaahhaaha the way she just look at you and said, " fuck you pussy ass bitch" and sllowly walked away
---
I'm talking about intentionally exploiting new hugs, ie basement drop, as being toxic. Run iron grasp and pass 2-3v hold for that basement hook so you can disable a player right off the bat and guarantee a win. Leave them there as bait or let them try out the new dc ban.
---
I HIT A DS WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING, BECAUSE I COULDN'T SEE SHIT.
---
I'd think its a result of the new hotfix. Maybe reset your system (maybe unplug it as well), disconnect from wifi and reconnect then try again. Sometimes mine will do similar messages until I do that. Other than that all I could suggest is uninstalling and reinstalling but that's definitely last resort.
---
And that is what makes you an asshole. For ranting like an idiot about how wrong is was and what not but all the while knew what i meant but didn’t phrase it right. So yeah fuck you sir
---
I do this to survivors if they are being toxic. I'll down them and slowly was them crawl away til they almost bleed out and then hook them at the last second -- making them waste as much time as possible.
---
Stan Smith *wishes* he looked like Ash.
---
Wait what is the bug?
---
Tbh I don’t know either, if you could just give the image I’ll figure it out.
---
I’ve never really given third seal a chance because there’s just always been perks I’d rather use more than it, but is it satisfying to get all 4 stacks? Is it part of a build?
---
Orrr it’s a nickname based on what he’s most known for (cards).
---
oh yeah that could be interesting too. Personally ive never been a major fan of early game only perks but yea that sounds like a great idea. only issue i can see is with that a lot of scaling hex totems would struggle cuz they get ignored early anyway. It'd probably only ever be used with ruin. Its hard man and we really dont wanna buff ruin at the moment.
---
I'm glad you took an amazing picture, compared to everyone else who takes pictures of the screen instead of screenshotting
---
And in cinema, which is where all these characters (save for Bill) come from. If you’re talking about in games, that’s a different story but in movies most the horror icons are very much so from American studios
---
Lmao the pancake moon, that’s just shoddy workmanship.
---
Lmfao. So I said name 5 perks and you named 1 actually good perk 1 offering 2 garbage perks and 2 add-ons. Do i need to explain why this is stupid as hell or?
---
If you can buy iron grasp from the web, do that too. Perfect build.
---
I like Ruin at red ranks because it slows some people down, and then there are others who spend time looking for it, when I know for certain that just chugging through is faster. Any time not spent on generators, is a good time gain for me.
---
Lol not true
---
Ahhhhh I get it, the lady is the Hatch and he went inside
---
# eYyyyyYYYyYyYyYyYyyyyyy
---
Hahaha, 3rd seal is pretty underrated! I only play survivor and thought the killer was hacking when I first played against it lmao because I didn't encounter it until like 2 months in
---
Look at that in game model. Just give him a suit and I see it.
---
That makes sense it’s hard to tell with him being what ever he turned into
---
Dead by Daylight. Hence the subreddit name.
---
See,  if I was being "toxic" in some way I wouldn't of cared. But I did nothing out of the way,  and actually had a off night so it wasn't even like I looped them multiple gens so they didn't wanna chase me again. Literally ONE gen was done both times.
---
Nice numbers you pulled from your behind, but recounted the patch and they claimed nowhere near this number. Unless your counting rebalance on characters which aren't bugs
---
Nothing changed
---
there are no mistakes here
---
Except for pig nerfs
---
Bubba, doctor, wraith and clown: allow us to introduce ourselves
---
I saw the post you made yesterday mentioning the uncloak haste bug, and it got me curious enough to do some testing in both public matches and KYF (I may make a separate post about this and include clips before and after the update to give a visual representation of the bug).
---
From what I (and my KYF friend) saw, it seems the bug is connected to performing a lunge during the initial speed boost. The speed boost after uncloaking is still there, but it’s not synchronizing with lunge attacks like it’s supposed to - pressing M1 immediately after uncloaking cancels your extra speed instantly. FWIW, I tried this with and without windstorm addons and the bug still occurs regardless. The same issue appears in both KYF and public matches as well.
---
Still confused why ash is not in the picture he has a sweater coming
---
Do you have laurie? Cause if not, it won't show up
---
Stridor does make regular breathing 25% louder too.
---
I agreed with you until the end. We're all playing a fucking game so we are supposed to have fun together. This "I only care about my own fun" mentality is the real toxic bullshit because that is what causes campers, tunnelers, glitch abusers, SWF SWAT teams etc.
---
Once you don't give a fuck about anyone else's fun you push away those who just want to have fun with everyone and get the toxic shits who tunnel and mori you because they are salty about the previous game going poorly
---
have some respect for your fellow players
---
oof
---
well well well what do we got here
---
Some survivors (especially with Iron Will) run through the pallet to get behind you after a blind
---
Obviously she's as smart as a bag of rocks
---
I wanted to be a sarcastic ass and echo their idiotic opening line back to them.
---
Not Today actually has a bit of potential for this. You can tank a noed/billy hit to get the save, and run some other assistance like DS/Deliverance to save yourself.
---
I don’t mind the idea, but it’s a completely useless skill. Killer sees the only 1 sabo’d hook and uses the remainder 15 on the map.
---
What? Did you think you'd get all that good and have nothing bad come out of it?

Sure, every country has their own things but solely in terms of film Hollywood is the most internationally recognized. Someone like say Jason Voorhees is much more well known in the film industry than someone like  Jiang Shi. Naturally people who just casually watch movies will know their own local movies and such better than movies overseas, but on the international scale American film is much more recognized

Not if you buy the perk in the shrine

---
It originally had now downsides, then I was considering a cooldown but I had no clue how the cool down would trigger, so I settled with the range reduction. A cooldown could work, though. After leaving the range of a survivor for 5 seconds or so the perk goes into a cool down or something. But even then it'd probably be a bit tedious. Maybe just remove the downside, idk. Good idea though
---
I am. I have no idea what’s going on. Maybe the update screwed with the servers for Xbox?

Killers, survs, which side was harder to play in the Temple of Wrath? Personally, I find it much harder as killer.

Well, no, it's just not really in line with the design philosophy of DBD perks. It also has a number of scaling values that make it utterly detrimental at levels 1 &amp; 2.

Killer: Ned Kelly, the Outlaw.

Survivor: Steve Irwin

I'm sure there's some fun abilities there.

Dead By Daylight x American Dad

I can totally see it happening.

Your claim is legit, the problem is, people would abuse this feature and screw the game to the other players.
---
Imagine the player A, he was the first survivor hooked in the game, the game isn't lost yet, but the things didn't go the way he wants. So he just leave the game. 
---
Or maybe someone just didn't like a killer, addon or map in his match and just leave at the start.
---
I believe if they put something like this in the game, it should have a minimum time to unlock, like 10min or more to avoid abuse.
---
Why?
---
Makes sense since they're from the same chapter
---
I'll never be ok with camping, but if that's what a player does, then far be it for me to tell them how to play a game. I'm glad I encouraged you though. Keep playing and killing and you'll get better dude.  If I may recommend, however, Patrolling is one thing, camping is something entirely different. just learn to hook and continue applying pressure to the gens. You'll get better over time too.
---
I want to know how effected breakout is for people being carried with boil over? 45% wiggle sounds like a good chance to wiggle out if they don't have iron grasp.
---
It’s the best altruistic thing to do as survivor lol I usually always do this with the last person I never leave someone behind 
---
Usually you both end up dying since one gets slugged and the last survivor gets chased to death but I have some games saved where we both made it out alive (even finishing the last 2 gens with only 1 other survivor)  and it’s honestly some of the best plays in DBD I’ve ever had as survivor

That's kinda... stupid

It seems to me, from what I am understanding of the Archives that the survivors may or may not come from our Earth. It states the entity consumes worlds and for all we know those survivors could each be from an individual planet, realm or plane of existence. 🤷‍♀️
---
Alright, but I thought when I read about the wraith in his info page, it said before he worked at auto haven, it was said to believe that he was a Polish immigrant.
---
Oh no, I mean to get them injured quickly. But come back for them later (if it feels right), as you're more likely to find another person going for the heal, leading to another chase etc.
---
Omfg YESSSS it’s been fucking up since yesterday around 4pm Arizona time and it’s still not working, can’t even join friends lobbies

I agree with most of this, but honestly it's hard for me to care too much when getting higher ranks currently doesn't give a reward.

OK but that's where we are now, and it's not my mindset that made the game that way. I developed my mindset from playing this game. You don't get to tell someone else what is or isn't fun for them. NO one is going to play this game like it's some grand uptopic thing. Shitty, salty killers are going to be shitty salty killers regardless of how I play the game. I don't play like a toxic asshole, I don't BM, I can't use a flashlight to save my life. But I run Lithe and Dance With me in my build I literally get called toxic for using a build that let's me escape a chase. Almost every killer I play against is an entitled asshole and tunnels regardless of how I play. So I play how I want to play, and they play how they want to play, and nothing is going to change that.
---
Can I use these perks in a compilation of fan made ideas? You'd be credited

It is. This why I only watch the videos of when it used to be done :(

It's like game devs want me to lower down my brightness level specifically for him. I know it's a small thing but the red glow hurts my damn eyes.

\*shrugs\* Guess I'll tell the red ranks I've seen using said perks that they're not allowed to get anymore 3-4ks with the perks I mentioned when running Legion tbh.

Man, look at those BOObies

What about yellow?
---
Decent I guess
---
Ghostface was never meant to stalk every single time. I mean when ghostface came out I was disappointed , cause I was able to stalk first 1/2 survivors when they didn't knew what killer it was , after that it felt useless apart from hide red stain in loops.
---
Same for whispers, really great at the beginning and at the end, other than that just keeps ruahwuahruahwuah all game long.

Still dont get killers that hook adam francis amd not escape an escape

It's pretty risky, yeah, but sometimes it's fun to do silly jukes like that.

Actually I take that back. Crybaby ass killer mains are changing the game for the worse for survivors, and for the better for Killers. Not that that does us any good, but I digress.

Seriously? Lol. Every killer loadout bbq, nurses, noed, rancor, insidious, iron grasp, and ruin lolololol. It's the SAME situation on the killer side. Funny you say that tho,  because I actually change my perks up all the time. But go ahead, and keep going.

Is it me or does Th e art make it look like it’s a floral fart?
---
Yeah, my thought at the time was "this will encourage players to level it up" but looking at it now, maybe buffing earlier levels might make it better, especially considering brown ranks might find the perk and then put it on because "eliminating facecamping sounds good" only for it to completely destroy them.

The Red Forest refers to an actual place in the world, a Forest in Chernobyl, which is where Huntress is on this map.

I don't get it. Isn't the entire objective as a survivor to power the generators. You even have a reminder on both killer and survivor screen reminding you to turn them on.... Like why is gen rushing a problem? You're literally doing your job. I don't get this community.
---
Really think about this for a second. The comment says that the OP should have learned Braille and echolocation... So basically learn the writing system for blind people, and use their own body as a sonar system. I know you guys must get off thinking that "oh, we're redditors and so smart, everyone else isn't an intellectual and so dumb, here's my /s you stupid plebs, take my /s," but in this case, the /s was completely unnessecary and almost everyone understands that it's not reasonable to learn a new language/system of writing and make clicking sounds at your screen to somehow pinpoint location.... all for a video game. An alien observing human culture would be able to tell this is satire.

Yeah I looked up some images and her gask mask looks more similar to British ones than American ones

A lot of these are assumptions and not necessarily where these characters are actually from. I mean, I myself always thought of the original 4 survivors and 2 killers (not Wraith because it says he's an immigrant) as being Canadian because the game is a Canadian game. At the same time, all four survivors could easily be from various other countries.
---
Bubba - chainsaw is self sabotage if survivors are near pallets or windows other then that maybe a down
---
doctor - power provides some tracking ability other then that heavily reliant on addons
---
wraith - stealth killer with little power to deal with chase
---
clown - can make survivors move around to different loops but slows himself down greatly in doing so
---
Yeeeeees!
---
Yesterday I had a baby legion do that to me yesterday.
---
He dropped me at the gate and killed the last guy, then carried me to the hatch and shut it.
---
Started walking to the exit gate but then turned around and threw me in the basement.
---
He then typed in the endgame chat "Haha, always wanted to do that."
---
I also knew he was a baby Legion, because he used frenzy only for mobility. Hit a survivor with it and then immediately stopped it and chased you normally.
---
I find it funny how it looks as it they used MS paint or something for his eyes. This is way better.
---
The killer would have to be Mad Cow Mike J tbh haha
---
To be fair, I’ve never been impressed with any of the Bloody looks, that Noble outfit tho? Dank 👌
---
Well. Deep Wounds don't count down if you keep running. Chase isn't needed anymore, terror radius isn't needed anymore. What did it do? Fuck Legion and buff Borrowed time. Lol. I think frenzy should be able to down people under certain conditions. For example if you hit all 4 with deep wounds and manage to hit a 5th hit, you down that person
---
Another sad story:
---
*Haddonfield is a bad designed map and makes OP balanced landing*
---
Devs: *Make balanced landing useless*
---
This tho no boomerang plz. Probably something poisonous and with big teeth cuz everything on Australia is trying to kill you.
---
well, i suppose he could be there because the portal for the upside down is in america
---
Oni definitely isn’t as good as pre-nerf spirit. If anything anything oni is like B tier cuz he can still be looped to filth when he doesn’t have his power, and even with his power looping him can be fairly easy if you can find a good turn heavy loop
---
Or maybe every generator completed, that way it doesn’t punish the survivors too much if the killer has an exclusively hex load out
---
Well in that case my keyboard would do a kobe out the window.

I hope the final master killer challenge is "Get 100% Platinum trophy for  Adept all Killers"

Insidious is never used unless your rank 25, noed is the same, rancor is pointless as well, iron grasp is just a basic QoL perk. It doesn't change a thinf.. Bbq, ruin I'll give you for sure. Nurses is pointless to run at higher ranks cus survivors aren't going to heal anywhere close enough. You're obviously dirt tier so how about you stop while your ahead.
---
&gt; but everytime I hit it I manage to get away
---
I wish the same could be said for me.

It is their build, but it's also your build
---
When someone says it's "Their build" It just means it is the build that they prefer to use for what compliments their playstyle
---
What you're hearing is "Hey guys I invented and claim this perk order as my own personal creation, You can try it but it's MY build"
---
He is pretty good but I wouldnt say top 3 killer or even top 5, Nurse is still way more viable so is spirit and Hillbilly still is better just because he has less steps to go through with using his ability. He still has plenty of counters too he'll just turning slightly counters the strike and and any long loop counters the ability.
---
The Upside Down is just a suburb of Hawkins.

Killers have haed adept trophies. Merciless victory with 3 basic perks. For survivors they just need to escape the exit gates. I propose that unless they change it back to killing all 4 survivors to qualify for merciless victory. If not, then make it that survivors can only use their 3 basic perks and have to complete at least 3 gens but themselves with no help, unhook 2 people, escape with an item in their hand, scored the highest emblems and leave with 30,000 bloodpoints prior to any after match boosts.
---
Perk: We’re gonna make it...
---
Instantly make survivors run into the arms of their loving killer.
---
It's extremely frustrating as in the Asia region these survivors are almost always in a SWF group (it's popular to be 4man SWF for streams or social media). When they execute every loop perfectly, on top of having voice communications, I simply don't see how it can be fun for killers in such an environment.
---
Forgive me, but this is the 4th game in a row of this crap, and the alternative of waiting 10-15 minutes for a survivor match isn't appealing.
---
End rant.
---
Fitting, because he was an unwanted child if you read his backstory.
---
This is considered toxic now? Unpopular opinion I guess, but this is not toxic. She's (poorly) taunting you so you'll go into the house and chase her so she can jump off the roof and attempt to rescue the hooked teammate. 
---
To me toxic gameplay is rubbing an error in your face, or taking advantage of you when you are helpless. Teabagging a killer to get him to follow you isn't toxic, it's strategic (douchey yes, but that's the point.) teabagging a teammate when he's down instead of healing him, is toxic.
---
Youch
---
He's a snowball type killer, his early game is slow but once he gets his power he snowballs from there.
---
Lolololol dirt tier? I'm rank 3 you wanna be know it all. You really act like you know what EVERYONE runs,  and if they don't EVERYONE else is wrong. Iron grasp and insidious go hand in hand in the games I play,  but again probably lying about that because you haven't seen it. People on reddit fucking kill me lololol.
---
Nyehehehehehe
---
Probably need a separate subreddit for tru3 hate at this point
---
Also weird because let's say I play 5 matches against red rank killers 3 of those run nurses and bbq. When I get matched against green or purple they almost always have nurses bbq ruin and noed. But I also clense totems so yanno.
---
Lmao if killers are using insidious at rank 3 they should be getting MAYBE a kill. Thats not winning. Youre absolute trash and you can't bear it. Your the guy immersion camping a corner and suicide bombing hooks without BT.
---
If you’re on a super open map, maybe but as I said on my comment any turn heavy loop heavily counters his power
---
Always wanted to go against one of these groups too bad I’m on console
---
Ghostface best killer for this reason alone.
---
Nop in my country it will be something like az and is still a stupid nickname , ace is a non sense if he speaks spanish and I cant think in other surv with aa nickname all of then have their name
---
Clense em eh? I just played 15 games last night. Saw noed twice, no one ran insidious or nurses. So. I guess you have the magic rank 3 brown ranks.
---
It's funny because he stepped right into the next trap haha.
---
The autopip for escaping should only be for exit gates, hatch should give nothing not even bloodpoints
---
Wrong once again,  I actually run borrowed time. :) You can say what you want. Insidious isn't used as much as the others,  you literally picked 1 that maybe a little exaggerated until we are on a match with a toxic killer but none that I'm actually correct about. I'm not gonna sit here and say I'm good blah blah blah,  because I know how I play and sure don't need a random bitch on reddit to validate me.
---
ds, bt, quick and quiet, head on.
---
dead hard fails me a lot more than head on these days
---
Killer queues are long for me, but im on at weird times... what rank are you? I barely play killer so im rank 19
---
I played both addons where you sacrificed speed for range and got a 4 gen on Lery's.
---
Took forever to finally get the hooks but I got a 3k and gave the last survivor the hatch.
---
Id love to see Adam form Buffy the vampire slayer in the game. He was like a Frankenstein’s monster of different demons and a dead soldier who they also made part Cyborg.
---
When i say barely i do mean barely, i have only started playing killer like yesterday
---
"It DiDn'T hApPeN tO mE"
---
He is if you're good with him. If you don't know how to manage your time collecting traps and placing them you'll have a rough time but if you have good placements you'll be golden. Especially if you use time waster perks to give you more time like ruin or corrupt intervention, also thrilling tremors may work
---
I used it on Claudette and I call it my "Insecurity Build" along with spine chill and iron will

Nea from Sweden is interesting, what made you decide on that?

They're dumb for this "filosofy"? Oh the irony

I think there might be an achievement because I've had it happen to me, once.
---
Wait for 2 rank resets, everyone is going to be in red and purple ranks and it will be next to impossible to find a game in rank 12-20.
---
I never understood the point of waiting it out (unless they’re on the last hook), like?? Youd save more time and eliminate the DS from the equation in the future if you just eat it the first time
---
At least that’s how I feel about it. When I wait it out things tend to go bad unless I just camp which,, no thank you that’s boring for everyone
---
Then it's a picture and not a screenshot lol
---
Yeah, it’s a common bug this patch. As you can see, BHVR has done a very good job.
---
Lots of people like playing killer, especially at that rank..
---
I lost an add on to my tool box like that last night. When the killer DCd I kept the box but lost the clamp add on and it never said anything about it in the end game screen and it wasn’t in my inventory.
---
Nemesis is a perk
---
Breakout and boil over do different things, so its not 45% wiggle. Breakout increases wiggle speed (think of it as a direct counter to iron grasp), aka it makes them wiggle out faster. Boil over increases the effects of wiggling, aka it makes it harder to walk when the killer is carrying someone. They're different effects, so it doesn't directly stack.
---
Those ones are so much worse though, but for now its what we got
---
My leatherface wouldve enjoyed snacking on all of them in the basement

You'll have good games and bad games with him at high rank.  His traps always have the potential to create snowballs which is good but optimal groups can make games rough if they assign someone to follow you to disarm traps or something.  Also his emblems similar to Plague get JACKED from using his power too much so ranking up is more challenging playing Trapper.  Still he is very satisfying to play and only has a couple maps that are truly terrible for him.  God help you if you get the Game with him.
---
whenever a killer gets glitched like this, you gotta rescue them
---
LMFAO ok boomer.
---
Keep in mind that Rank 1-4 survivors are going to be in purple ranks, eventually, everyone is going to be purple and red rank.
---
Ah, nice. I’ve been recently thinking about this idea as well. Especially if you either own certain DLC survivors/killers or the entire chapter that got released with a new menu theme. Something of the sort. Also, they should have it to where it plays throughout each and every menu instead of just the main menu too.

No, you can't say they were hooking you hopping it would break the game for you because hooking someone is a normal part of the game, it's one of the main objectives. Someone climbing on rocks or other objects they shouldn't be able to get on is something that isn't part of the game and would therefore be an exploit. 
---
They can't ban someone for hooking people in the basement while it's bugged even if that person was doing so with the hope the game would bug. That was true for people using wake up as well. However, they can ban someone for climbing on objects they shouldn't be able to.
---
The bug is on the company, if you want to complain about it, and you should want to because it's a bullshit bug, then complain to the company. Write to them, they should have hot fixed a major game breaking bug like this within 2 days. If they haven't then people need to spam them until they do to show them we shouldn't have to deal with constant bugs like this that take them weeks to fix. Don't try to push the responsibility of playing around the bug on people simply playing the game the way it was intended to be played.

That change not only doesn't make Deep Wound less lethal (barring gimmicky Tinkerer/Dark Devotion shenanigans, it was already impossible for a survivor to actually go down to Deep Wound, and that's an intended and good thing), but it improves Deep Wounds' general utility. Survivors now cannot work gens (or cleanse totems, heal survivors, ...) indefinitely within your terror radius anymore. They also cannot stealth-juke you in chases, let alone do so using lockers, as they will be bleeding out if they aren't mending (which makes noise) or running. This is also relevant for Decisive Strike locker plays.
---
Why are you concerned about survivors running around not bleeding out? They aren't doing anything productive anyway. There is no single scenario I can think of in which the bleedout timer being stopped in terror radius is better for the killer than it being stopped when the survivor runs, apart from precisely the type of abuse this change was made to prevent. Mind naming any? I guess there's the almost impossibly unlikely scenario where a survivor is dying on hook and another survivor is in Deep Wounds, and now they can run there and make the unhook whereas before they might have bled out doing so. But this requires the bleedout and hook progression timing to exactly overlap to a point where it wouldn't have been possible otherwise, it requires the killer not to be anywhere near either the Deep Wounded nor hooked survivor, and it requires for there to not be any other survivor that could go for the save instead.
---
Frenzy should not down people because it requires next to no skill to use and has next to no counterplay. We've been there.
---
I'm so confused how is this a buff and not an even bigger nerf to a perk that is already laughably bad?
---
Are the legion cosmetics going to be free?
---
I guess he speaks English too and that would make sense then, as in Ace of Spades. Or ace as in “really good at something”, e.g. gambling/playing poker.
---
Silly person, it's a flask not a mug!
---
As a killer I hate when people do this to other players. But unlike other snowflake killers, I'm immersed as fuck and my evil ass will grab you out the locker just because your raging salt will taste much better when I basement hook and camp you with mah chainsaw revved waitong for that sweet DC dessert.
---
Am I the only one who finds hitting great healing skill checks incrediby difficult? The fact that the normal skillcheck is so huge makes it super hard for me to hit the great one for some reason. Which is also why Unnerving Presence helps me immensely with hitting great skillchecks.
---
\^
---
This
---
That’s actually a better idea then having a negative, I agree with this more then my own suggestion
---
R34 when?
---
this should be the topic of a romantic song.
---
How it really be: trying to do gens but end up being found every time since nobody else is doing generators 
---
Why do people make it difficult to play survivor 😐
---
What would be the point of wiggling if they could just drop you at 99% and not pick you up?
---
The smart bitch has jugg
---
If you put yourself behind a wall and crouch most huntresses won't be able to land a hatchet throw. Sure if you go against a good  huntress you're probably screwed but the same could be said about EVERY killer. Except maybe legion and pig post nerfs. Also when you're running from a huntress you should try to be as unpredictable as possible and don't run in a straight line. Demogorgon relies heavily on his portals similar to hag with her traps. Majority of the time it's better to ignore them but keep an eye on them when you spot one the animation for using one is slower than you would expect and it gives you time to run away.

Why is it that Ghostface players are either really chill memelords or the most toxic, teabagging, camping and tunneling a-holes but NOTHING in between? I have never seen a "normal" Ghostface. It's always only been one of the two.
---
Oh right, didn’t know the map is set in Ukraine; well, at least where modern day Ukraine would be.
---
You better quit playing then because this is completely normal and they can't make things stricter due to queue times. 
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;*We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)
---
&gt;# If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019
---
](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
Ah right I See, thanks for clearing that up. Looks real good
---
_cries in Brazilian_
---
Love when I find some1 that I havent fed off of yet so I chase them for a little bit to get my their 3 ready then I go to another person.
---
Yep whether I’m survivor or killer the lobby is empty and eventually I get kicked out with a message “You need a connection to access this content”
---
Now.
---
Spite: if the killer remains within 10 meters of you for an entire hook state all other survivors are granted a 5/7/9% increase to the speed of all actions. If the killer remains for the entirety of the hook the survivors will also gain the endurance status effect the next time they are hit. 
---
Any actions to rush the hook timer will result in this perk becoming inactive for the rest of the trial.
---
What bothers me is if the devs did buckle down to fix all old code it would slow down new content from coming out and the community would call the devs lazy as always . -.
---
This might be a weird suggestion... but I’m a survivor main that’s relatively new to the game and would love to team up with someone that plays killer to have some practice/sparring custom matches. I’m on xbox too. Let me know if you want to run some chases to work on skills.
---
Shouldve put pig there
---
Ok so then the memes about people leaving for Kate for Jane are stupid then too
---
Not me
---
Just the thing with playing solo survivor
---
I'm tired of wearing out the rubber on my analogue sticks and giving myself thumb cramps just to do menial QTEs (yes, I know they're not hard, but still). Also, with the upcoming abandon penalties, purposefully dying will become commonplace, with players deliberately getting hooked, and not struggling.
---
At the very least, I'd appreciate a toggle-able option to disable these annoying QTEs. I'd rather take a breather after being downed, than tediously spam a button, waiting for the potatoes on my team to help.
---
Actually doctor is being changed, there has been talk for it for about a month and the powers already been changed slightly, his abilities description has also been changed. But i see every other point, the difference between the wake up bug and infinite mending is that mending could literally break the game, some mends took over 40 minutes, it was literally breaking the game.
---
I was chasing a Claudette through Autohaven Wreckers. She weaved through some junk and I followed, as soon as I got to the pallet a Nea popped up and slammed the pallet in my face. Didn't see it coming at all and I jumped. Had to stop the chase and just stare at her for a while.
---
I had a ghostface tunnel and tbag me after every down and after two people were hooked next to each other and I was injured with no way of healing, so I had to let them die, because he most likely was camping them because he clearly hates me for some reason? Anyways, immediately afterwards, I died from endgame, and he called me the worst survivor and DBD and that I was a terrible teammate.
---
Always the Ghostfaces, is2g
---
I wonder if the licensed killers will ever get Halloween skins. Imagine a Ghostface or a Pig with a hallowed blight skin that shines brighter than the sun itself lmao
---
Known bug, should be fixed next patch.
---
The traps aren't really an issue at all in any way which is why she's considered a lower tier killer. The changes made it so they don't activate if all the gens have been done and they don't kill at the exit gates anymore. While I could see them being worried about that with EGC, it really wouldn't have been a problem when the hatch would still be an option and traps are often removed as quickly as they are put on due to the randomness of them. 
---
pounce isn't considered a normal hit anymore either which got rid of some perk synergy
---
Yep, so demo does live in Indiana, should have just put his picture upside down in the graphic
---
Hmm. Doctor is literally getting reworked next, do you expect them to snap their fingers and rework each and every killer in a single second? These things takes time. And the ptb exists as a test environment, that is why changes are made when stuff on ptb goes live. As for the disconnect penalty I'd be willing to get it was delayed due to issues with it. I'd rather get a functioning punishment system later than a broken one now. Additionally, four survivors are required per killer to have a game, while both sides should be fun survivor needs to be slightly more appealing or killer queue times will be even worse as fewer people play survivor, and I am saying this as someone who plays killer at least 50% of the time. They're a relatively small dev team and can't do this stuff immediately, and the game has been changed for the better over the last 18ish months. Yes some elements of dbd are aggravating but my guy, chill, it's just a game and the devs are working the best they can
---
I’ll be honest. I purposely run spine chill tier 2 because 3 is too far to make a judgement but i’ll stay on a gen and then use fixated to go somewhere else once a killer comes to check on my gen and i’ll click the flashlight just so thy can hear it and it’s hilarious seeing them check lockers and corners twice and get frustrated that they cant find me. Psychological warfare is best warfare
---
Dying Breath: when downed, survivors will release a geyser of dioriaha from their ass, hurling the kiler into space.
---
there is so many things wrong with this comment
---
You new to dbd or something?
---
Ooo another Devs bad shitpost.
---
I presume the hotfix hasn't fixed killers dodging lobbies on PS4. Just the 8 (eight) in a row just now. What a great hour of dbding I've just had.
---
DBD 3.4.1 = lobby loading simulator.
---
I don't even want to look up if people are that kind of crazy...
---
That seems a bit fast even for really good Survivor teams. I could see it happening maybe if your teammates brought toolboxes, and found gens quickly. Your point is fair though. Your team should actually be productive when not pressured by the Killer.
---
Man people are seriously getting this butthurt over something as dumb as this
---
A small indie team can still learn from past mistakes and change their habits, that's kind of an irrelevant excuse on your part
---
Nemesis and play with your food. Wraith is the best killer at getting play with your food stacks since he can force chases to end by cloaking.
---
They were changed by mistake. None of the new ability stuff is in the game yet. This has been tested.
---
Amd a library for "Useless shit r/deadbydaylight whines about."
---
It’s not that fast when it only takes 80 seconds to do one-  you have 40 extra seconds to do whatever you want, as well.  Even with ruin you can probably do it in that time if you rush to it
---
I mean the Wake Up bug pretty much ensured killers couldn't win either when even vaulting was 15% faster and it was being used in 4-mans across the board
---
Im the billy with discordance
---
Ok, let me restate, they are learning. Implementing changes from that learning takes time because they are small and can only do so much at once, it may be slow but changes are being made. I'd rather have good changes that take a while than bad changes that happen immediately
---
Nope I’m at rank 3 as survivor.  And still nobody does gens.
---
So assuming The Red Forest is actually the real world Red Forest (as in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl, so named because all the trees died and turned red) that would put her right on the northern border of Ukraine, about midway between Poland and Moscow. Of course it didn't get the red forest name until long after the Huntress lived there.
---
You guys are complaining about long que times and saying that's the reason I dropped this game lol but if they cross platform the game and you play against PC players with movement you can't match your gonna play again? Please give me a break you can't even handle a long que lol.  Besides cross platform with PC on console isn't even being considered it's been asked and answered by the developers multiple times.
---
Here's an idea maybe don't just play killer I mean to really be good at killer you need to play survivor to understand their perks and how they effect the killers that way you can counter them with the killer perks if you don't know them how can you fight them?... 
---
And que times get lower the better rank you get level 20 all ppl want to be killer lower ranks you need to be playing survivor to get the right perks or your killer will only get gen rushed and bullied pat level 10 your killer better have all the right perks or your not gonna do well at all same as survivor if you only play one type of character your not gonna get anywhere in this game just sayin.
---
You guys hyped for this crossover next week
---
Wow you are do cool. Fucking over your teammates because you are a salty baby. So cool. No one cares.
---
Ok so you should be used to this by now.  Get on a swf team or nothing will change.  It’s just how it is.
---
Ah, I forget hidden effects
---
You can make it even more annoying by using surveillance instead.  
---
Without SWF level of coordination, it becomes exceptionally difficult to defeat.
---
Arent we supposed to get the new map an increased amount? I've gotten it once.
---
This is why i always say have 2 queues. Normal and Insane.
---
For Normal mode, no SWF (be it 2 3 or 4 people together) can queue.  It is a forced solo queue only. Game goes on as usual.
---
In Insane mode, SWF can queue along with solo survivors as well. The Insane mode is 4x the bloodpoints and ranking doesnt exist so any mofo can queue with anyone be it rank 1 or 20. It's a crazy mode thay if the killer accepts to endure, rewards both players with massive bloodpoints.
---
People will say it will kill the game but I strongly doubt it. The weak bitches will leave and the rest if the fans will continue. Hell, I hate SWF but for 4x the bloodpoints, I'd fucking endure it. For me, it will be worth it.
---
In both cases, any type of dc whether delinerate or not results in 30min ban.
---
so, just like the Wraith?
---
Looks like you need to read more about her. 
---
People are whining a bunch.
---
Okey but how do you properly do the sprint burst “bug”
---
What happens when we get neither then? Most of the good changes even when they took a long time have been reverted, such as when they made scratch marks more accurate and no longer go up walls and when they made pallet counts smaller. Freddy's changes took 2 years and he might get nerfed anyway. 
---
They are also capable of making good survivor changes without taking a lot of time so I don't think they NEED to take a long time
---
Reminds me of the patchnotes for Payday 2, which were sometimes hilarious. 
---
I the long list of small fixes, you could read stuff like "fixed an issue with a rock on Firestarted Day 1" or "fixed a collision-related issue with a bench on the Bank heist"
---
Feng garbo so....  
---
I wouldn't dislike her if every single one I find didn't fail every skill check and lead killers to me all the time, also 80% of feng mains I meat are assholes
---
She's based more on Voodoo type stuff what with the backwater swamps obviously being Louisiana, being called "The Hag" (which obviously calls to mind dark magics because association with Witches, which usually media depictions of Voodoo cross over with), and her model design lending itself to an African American rather than Native American.
---
There definitely seems to be some influence of Wendigo in her design and backstory, but that itself would put her away from the backwater swamps as the Wendigo is specifically part of Algonquian folklore, a tribe that (as far I as I know) were/are located more around the north-northeast of current USA and Canada.
---
Hey guys! We have a small group and I thought I’d put out a feeler for for some DBD players who play solely for fun and don’t mind shooting the crap on Discord chat. (PC)
---
Don't want to oversell our size, we’re small right now with only a handful of people and only a couple of us play DBD as their main game -- which is why it’d be nice to grow!
---
Obviously you don't have to fit this mold exactly but a little about us to see if you might fit and be interested:
---
Who we are: mainly working professionals between mid-20s and early 30s who enjoy gaming in our free time
---
Gender: we have guys and gals. We might occasionally chat about "adult" things but none of us are sexist, that's not cool. We are wholesome people 😇
---
Region: we have NA, EU, AUS -- obviously it's hard to get all of us together at the same time but we try to mix and match depending on the time
---
How we play: completely for fun! We don't play toxic and we don't get salty, everything is for crap and giggles. We are noobs, fail skill checks all the time, and we embrace it. Got an achievement? We’ll dedicate the game trying to help you (and likely fail😜)
---
Our ranks: We have a couple people on the borderline green range and a few in the 17-20 range — but again we don’t care about rank or winning for that matter
---
Twitch: a few of us stream so keep in mind it’s possible you might be live on voice chat (we are small-time — single digit viewers)
---
Anyway if you are interested shoot me a DM and we can connect on Discord! (Yikes, long message sorry haha)
---
They did, I still felt like responding.
---
Or deleted because they don’t want more people abusing the bug?
---
I have been seeing so many legion posts about being purposely destroyed for no reason. We as killers should all just master and play him until the survivors are so fucking bored to play against him that they join our rally for buff
---
Agreed, I loved running DD on Legion but most people assumed it didn’t work. Guess they’re right now 🙁
---
Aside from bugs (which is a technical issue, not necessarily a design one) the changes they've made have been good. I won't defend them on the recent basement fuckery, however, more QA should mean more wait for stuff, which reinforced the whole wait for a good thing instead of getting a rushed thing that I'm trying to get at. Yes they make mistakes but not on the scale some people think they do. The game is still going strong (arguably stronger) after three and a half years, and it has gotten better over that time
---
Either running or getting down by the killer *or* crouching around the map(urban evasion)
---
Why not...Yui clearly has one
---
What do you see in the swamp maps that make them distinctively Louisiana? I just see a swamp. I mean sure there’s the Pale Rose paddleboat but those were pioneered in Europe before coming across the pond. The vegetation looks like some sort of cattail but those are found in wetlands across the Northern Hemisphere. Blackwater isn’t a specific swamps name but a geographic type of which there are several in the UK. What specifically about Lisa or her maps screams US?
---
He said DLC survivors
---
&gt;I'd prefer if you argued on your own merits instead of using whatever streamer you orbit around to argue for you. One good player =/= the killer is good. I'm sure there's a Bubba main out there who does great, doesn't mean Bubba is a good killer.
---
I don't orbit around any streamer, is just an easy and perfect example of how strong pig is. 
---
Being a good killer requires nothing but general understanding of the game, how to deal with loops and how to apply pressure. If you know all this, you'll perform well with any killer and they also provide you unique powers to assist with that task. 
---
With that being said, current Pig provides multiple features that only add up to your general skill.
---
i've asked for hatch once. and only once. When we had a DC as the game started. It may be still a 3v1 but that puts the killer at such an early advantage... I felt like a hatch would have been nice.
---
I'm going to start using this meme when I get the salty "you could have given me the hatch" messages.
---
Now that would be a funny April Fool's idea. Switch the killers and the survivors roles for a day.
---
"Put that thing away or so help me God..."
---
Plague's not really bad, but a big reason why people don't play her is because the emblem system sucks with her kit. The killer emblem system sucks in general, but plague is just punished in almost every category.
---
Ghostface is currently considered one of the top killers and he hasn't received any changes I can think of since leaving the ptb. He also did get a few buffs like stalk progress not decaying when he left the ptb.
---
As far as Oni and Spirit go it's been like 2 days. Spirit changes don't seem big enough to weaken her significantly and people are experimenting with the Oni.
---
Her bio saying shes swedish.
---
What the hell is wrong with you people? Just cuz you dont like him doesnt mean you should join his stream just to laugh or make fun of him.
---
The only problem i have with this is when all of the other survivors die trying, resulting in giving more undeserved kills. They are deserving since he punished altruistic actions performed by the rest of the team, but he didn’t put any real effort, like downing someone from a chase.
---
If i ever get stuck like this, whether its a pallet, a bear trap or what have you, if a chad survivor rescues me you better believe ima let them escape and give them a small loan of a million bloodpoints lol
---
This is something smart survivors would do. The problem is that most survivors aren't smart. Most are toxic and would rather sit there and look stupidly at the killer looking around for them then do what you said and then when they die call the killer a camper.
---
Honestly when I play survivor and I get put in this situation though I go for the all in. Like I wait till the killers going to check the other one then I just commit to it and hope I can make a play with dead hard
---
You see, this is what you're supposed to do: take em to the hatch, close it in their face, then pick em back up and walk right up to a hook to make them think you're the biggest dickhead to exist, then stare at it for a second and turn around towards a gate.
---
I love doing that to people.
---
Yeah definitely , when I sacrifice myself it’s fine but as soon as I see everyone else come back I regret my decision
---
Okay so I specifically read his lore and while it does state that he has Argentinian roots, it also says “...he gamed, scammed, seduced and smooth-talked his way to a life of luxury as a high roller in the land of opportunity.” Land of opportunity seems to as a pretty clear metaphor for the U.S. That tells us that he actually lives in the States hence speaking English and using an English nickname. Hope that clears it out.
---
Wait, small game detects llusionary pallets as "traps"?
---
GF, Plague and Oni were not nerfs since they weren't on the liver servers they were adjustments after viewing footage of different playstyles on PTB.
---
Pig Nerfs weren't nice for the poor piggy but hopefully they are being changed based on updates to her kit and ad ons that are still in early development and they wanted to get the nerfs out of the way before hand.
---
Legion is probably on their back burner and is only getting changes to keep them in their place.
---
Nurse's two blinks did nothing to weaken her and her ad on change was healthy imo.
---
Spirit is just as good as before just has some more counter play.
---
Only nerf I see Freddy needing is to how much he can slow the game down with his ad-ons.
---
I think the Hatch has been close able before but without EGC so the survivor would have to generators to escape but instead they just hid, holding the game hostage. So the team jumped around with different hatch ideas until we got the EGC.
---
Doctor rework is coming as seen by the descriptions to his ad-ons that snuck into the live update.
---
DS used to not have the hook requirement and all 4 survivors could just use it any time the killer picked them up.
---
All of Balanced Landing's advantages only works when you are not exhausted now.
---
Legion Duo Blade and the basement bug stopped gameplay entirely for survivors whereas Wake Up and the no-sound didn't stop the game form being played by the killer just made it more difficult.
---
SWF was added because people dodged queues just to play with their friends making waiting times take longer then they should have.
---
I mean to say NOED not ruin sorry man. Ruin is a must.
---
Interesting. I’ll have to give it a try!
---
Free entertainment better than you can find anywhere else
---
Thats just fucked up if you find that entertaining..
---
I play on PC and killer lobby is taking 10-25 mins to fill up. I can’t get an survivors...
---
Hot
---
When all 4 escape: when they say gg ez baby killer
---
the vast majority of killers absolutely do not perform well against competent survivors and SWF groups regardless of skill, due to how fast gens fly by and other factors. This is why several streamers (Otz, Monto, Tru3, etc) struggle heavily against good survivors when using certain killers despite all being very good at the game. 
---
All killers only do well against bad survivors.
---
I've been saying this since day 1. Wiggling is not ideal, but not too bad since it's brief, but having to spam a button for a full minute on a hook is tedious and annoying. Not to mention it's entirely unintuitive to new players who 90% will die instantly on their second hook because they don't do it right. 
---
It's not skillful, it's not fun and way too punishing if you accidentally skip a beat or your finger cramps, slips, etc.
---
Sounds like you're trying to apply tactics that work against new survivors to survivors who know how to exploit them. 
---
Like camping and tunneling. Really effective against people early on, but actually hurt you if you're playing against people who know how to take advantage of it. 
---
Next time you're in a match, maybe try thinking of all the time you're spending chasing and guarding a hook. Now imagine what that time would look like as generator progress.  You go up against the right group and an 80 second chase or 2 minute face camp could mean 3 - 4 generators completed.
---
My aunt is also in the game, she was the other survivor “GEMMAKISS PR” we’ve been playing videogames since Halo 3. I guess I’ve been so used to it I didn’t think about that 😅
---
Ok makes sense
---
I’m fine with wiggling because you can just rotate your analog stick. Struggling though should be like hold a button to let go
---
Gratz console people, now you can buy 3 great perks for your other killers.
---
Well... who knows, maybe playing on a controller makes it not so bad on console as killer... not like huntress or nurse...
---
I play Claudette when I play survivor and now I just??? I’m mad at myself?? That video has an energy that cannot be replicated
---
Did I miss something, or is Ace actually from South America? Thought he was.... well, maybe not FROM Italy, but at least from  Italian lineage...
---
why we would we?
---
Her Lore and name?
---
Well the glitch made it possible to heal in 5 seconds twice, so that’s a plus. You need teammate with Leader, I believe tho. Aaronplaystv did it. Pretty crazy
---
Yea I do find it entertaining watching his ego get crushed. A couple years ago true didn’t have this ego that he has now. But now he has more viewers. Which made him change as a person. He now has a god complex and is very arrogant. It’s hilarious seeing him being brought back to reality.
---
Fair?  Probably not.  But reasonable to expect?  Very.  You bet my ass I’m doing a gen at the start of the game unless I’m running Ace to farm items, but that is very rare and much less than 1/10 of my games.
---
Also, it becomes easier for killers when there are less gens- IE 3 gen scenarios
---
me trying to find friends outside of school
---
I heavily agree with this. I play both Killer and Survivor equally, and the Killers are constantly neglected. When's the last time Legion, Wraith, Clown, or Pig were viable? Freddy was infamously bad for TWO YEARS before getting a rework (which I personally don't even like, because it robbed him of his ability to remain 100% invisible outside of the Dream World). Meanwhile, Survivors were tweaked regularly, and seldom nerfed after PTB. I think it comes down to Survivor mains being a lot more vocal. They're typically a lot sweatier, and SWF allows them to strategize, leading to frustration when their plans don't work out. That's when they cry out for nerfs as soon as they come across a Killer they can't bully.
---
That's still North America
---
If the killer even finds you in the first 2 minutes of the game you're not playing right. The idea is not to get found. Not chase me and hope the team is doing everything else. The less time you're seen the less chase time the less pallets wasted everything is better if the killer can't even find you. Find a better gameplay strategy than "bait the killer for 2 minutes and throw every pallet on the map"
---
I like playing as Leatherface on PS4 (and now on Switch).
---
Ghostface is still my clear favorite but my 2nd favorite is Leatherface.
---
When played right (not camping) he can actually be a lot of fun to play as.
---
The hag is fairly easy to counter imo via he size and what she can do but a good hag can be mega effective
---
It all depends on how many gens are left or how in control you are. 3+ gens left, I’ll eat a DS. If there are two survivors remaining, I’ll also eat it. 
---
Anything less than that with more survivors and I’ll just slug it out.
---
No i dont think
---
As a Oni main for 2 years, I can say you can counter it by using the buttplug addon
---

Same I had to reset my game 5 times to find a working mach
---
&gt; DS used to not have the hook requirement and all 4 survivors could just use it any time the killer picked them up. 
---
Untrue. only the obsession got the instant DS. Other people getting it was extremely rare. Now all 4 get it instantly and it's not just an anti-tunneling tool because of how long the timer is. I've been DS'd even after hooking other people. I've had people get unhooked, finish a gen, that run over to a hook and I get DS'd because it was STILL up. 
---
DS was 100% a buff
---
I've seen it and it looks pretty trash, the blood is barely noticeable ironically
---
Right now it feels like the best course of action is to just hide in a locker until hes done raging.. And thats not very fun. :P
---
That sucks... I wonder if they ever will implement that...
---
Lol, just the other day a Rank 17 accused me of cheating (he was spectating after dying).
---
"You just hooked someone and went straight for a guy at the other side of the map"
---
"Yeah buddy, its a perk called BBQ&amp;Chilli, its right there in my build, read what it does".
---
I can understand why he is confused but yo will think people new to the game would at least refrain from amking accusations when they dont even understand the game yet.
---
He’s there but he’s in a basement in Texas so you can’t see him
---
As a PS4 player he really isn't that bad he just can't flick making his demon strike and dash weaker then on PC but besides that he's pretty good imo
---
The best answer is practice. I would put the killer in the position to safely practice like only attempt to blind them when they break pallets. But go in expecting to not succeed and to get got therefore you are prepared for that outcome.
---
You sure as hell act like one.
---
after you stun the killer with a pallet, turn around and shine the flashlight in their face. they’ll be stuck in the stun animation for a few seconds and can’t avoid the blind. another way to do it is to wait for the killer to pick up a downed survivor then shine it in their face. there’s a short period of time where they can’t move and if you blind them quick enough it should be a guaranteed save. hope this helps
---
"but it adds tEnSiOn!!"
---
I'm snatching Rancor, thanks for the heads up my friend
---
I never claimed I was a red rank killer. And I am not biased because I play both survivor and killer equally. I’m not the one making a reddit post about “how hard it is to be a killer”. And you saying the stats are meaningless shows your bias. Just another killer main whining and putting aside the actual statistics that were released because it doesn’t fit their ideal of the game.
---
This is a top shelf meme super chief. It provided me with a hearty chuckle.
---
Here is mine:
---
#**[Subreddit Update - Rule 8: Oversaturated Content Addition - Tier Lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr1zmk/subreddit_update_rule_8_oversaturated_content/)**
---
Now we need a Korean killer/survivor.
---
I think you’re gonna get hate for this, but hey, it made me smile
---
I accept defeat
---
So let me get this straight, continously taunting the killer through flashlights and t bags and sending hate messages isn't toxic? Pink gear Toolboxes, Flashlights, Insta heals, and powerful perks like object of obsession, decisive strike, adrenaline, etc, Are tools that the survivors have at their disposal. Likewise, the killers have their own variety of powerful add ons and Moris that drastically make them more powerful. Doing things like taking a hit for a survivor at the exit gates and focusing down a survivor who is dead on hook are a part of the game.
---
Toxicity is being asshole in game and out. And killer mains have to face the most of it, because you're facing 4 people at a time. The odds of running into a prick in the post game chat or just someone following you around flicking their flashlight at you are greater.
---
As a PC player i'd say the oni is among the top 3 bets killers right now and im afraid for a nerf
---
If QTEs and button-mashing are your idea of good gameplay, I pity you.
---
&gt; I think it's a little too easy to rank up as survivor. 
---
I’m probably the biggest “call out BHVR for every little mistake they make” person on this sub/this planet, but I feel like there’s nothing they can do to make survivor pips fair AND  meaningful. They have 4 different categories to be “graded” in, and doing one usually means neglecting the other 3. You can’t gain objective points AND boldness points at the same time (usually), and survival points? Good luck getting those at all. Killers can max 32k BP just playing to the objective (not always easy, but almost always possible). 
---
Survivors can also get royally fucked over for things out of their hands. You’re the first one hooked? If the killer facecamps you, and/or your teammates don’t want to or don’t know how to save you, then you lose a pip. Not because of your individual skill (which pips/rank should represent), but because you got grouped with the wrong people and now you’ll be punished for it. 
---
It’s a really hard system to balance. 
---
(That’s NOT to say that killer ranking is even remotely fair either. Good luck getting any Adept killer achievements, because getting a Merciless Killer score above like rank 17 is an utter nightmare without Ruin to save your Gatekeeper emblem. Any D/Cs? You lost it again.)
---
My complaint isn't with how NOED works. My complaint, is that MY complaints are dismissed by saying totems are an objective. They're not. No one can argue this. If you want it to be an objective, make their cleansing required, and/or give me a counter for how many are left on the map. 
---
There's nothing worse than covering the map looking for the possibility of 1 you may have missed because communication is 0 with random teammates, and you can't be there for the cleansing of every single one. Best case scenario, you don't miss any. Or you miss 1 and the killer doesn't have NOED. Worst case, there's 1 hidden in a VERY bad place, and the killer was proxying the area, so you had 0 chance to get it. And then the killer gets a couple kills in endgame that they wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
---
I suppose that sounded more clever in your head
---
That hitbox ._.
---
I'm new to this sub (only had the game about a month) and Chonky Jesus fucking killed me.
---
Depends on rank. Rank 20-15 take a shit ton and get bad matches. 
---
15 to 12 take a bit less with not so unbalanced matchups, after rank 12-11 the seem pretty agile to me, less than 5 minutes to get matched.
---
If you want faster matches you need to rank up, the higher you rank as killer the faster the queue
---
That's better.
---
The hag enjoys sweet tea and pecan pie in her down time I see.
---
the original survivors are all from Canada and Jane is Latina
---
I'd still consider it up there on the priority list. But they probably ran into a snag when trying to debug.
---
Spaghetti Code can be spaghetti sometimes. Sometimes fixing one thing screws up 32.8 other things.
---
Non obsession DS users could use DS at only 35% wiggle. That is not that far, and also guarantees no basement hooks. Now a killer can literally never get DSed if they don't tunnel survivors. 
---
So non tunneling killers went from potentially 4 uncounterable DSes to 0 DSes. I guess if you're a tunneling bitch, then the new DS is a buff though.
---
Lol it's so ImMeRsIvE!!!!
---
His mobility is a slower but more controllable Billy. He can move in slight zigzags, but it’s in a general direction. 
---
Keep in mind that when he raises his club, it obscures his vision. He also has to charge it. Be aware of the lunge, running in a straight direction will get you hit. Counter him like you would Bubba and abuse walls and trees. 
---
But that’s if you encounter him in the first place. You wouldn’t run around Willy Nilly when Myers has tier 3, so keep a low profile while his rage is active.
---
Serious question this time (in case it wasn't obvious)
---
What do you get from reacting like this to me ? I mean, I obviously lost almost nothing since I didn't really play during the bug, and was just concerned by the fact that they don't really apologize or do anything in the gameplay-wise for the player, like compensations in other games ?
---
I submitted a ticket the other day into BVHR for this issue.  They're currently working on a fix for xbox servers and are genuinely trying their hardest.

I tossed aside nea, i still main feng, but primarly yui

Shame he's a cool character
---
Dude. Thank you. I'll give you some reddit gold later this is actually super helpful. Thank you for taking the time out of your day.
---
This is... Requiem.
---
A game without bugs? Please name any one game without bugs.
---
decisive is fine as it is. pretty easy to counter tbh. 
---
by the time the survivor gets to use it you’ll just have to wait 10-20 seconds before picking them up. that timer goes fast.
---
yeah your saying that im on the right side of the pallet and the kiler behind. he is able to attack me and it would hit but your saying that i could legit just throw the pallet on the right side and go to the left side just because the killer there? does that seem fair, i made a mistake and i should be punished for it
---
Survivors when lighting hits their feet
---
He goes full drift city and it’s hard to avoid
---
Yeah it's pretty much worthless now
---
As long as the person being chased knows what they’re doing and isn’t wasting resources, it’s just as effective of a strategy, if not more because the other 3 survivors can focus solely on gens instead of worrying about avoiding detection
---
Community: Behaviour can you please fix the bugs, buff worthless perks, address performance issue, and fix the console experience that has been broken for years now?
---
BHVR: How about a Battlepass?
---
I've always hated QTEs. But I find the skill checks to be acceptable. Most of the time, they are not too obnoxious. I just wish they wouldn't trigger a notification if you stop your action just as a skill check is about to start (like when you decide to leave a Gen to help someone).
---
The button mashing sucks though, there should be some sort of alternative.
---
If destroying your controllers with QTEs, you’re doing it to fucking rough
---
There's a split in player base between 2 groups. People who play to have fun and people who find it fun to win. If you're playing for fun that's awesome but don't be surprised that as you climb through the ranks you start getting your face kicked in because both killers and survivors are doing what they can to win.
---
PTB Ghostface could stalk exposed survivors to extend the time. While a neat trick was rather unfair since there was no way to really loop out the expose status. Since even if you broke Ghostface out his power regen was fast enough by default for it to be back up before the timer finished.
---
The main change with the exposing ghostface I remember was that survivors had to center Ghostface on their camera for a short time since on the PTB survivors could just spin their camera and break Ghostface out of his power on the other side of the map. It basically just made Ghostface very unplayable since he may as well not have a power.
---
You can make console sensitivity insanely high, but then you go from not being able to look around fast enough to looking around so fast you can't see. There is no in-between.
---
I never said I got mixed up with another character, I got mixed up with something else.
---
How many times are people going to repost this exact meme?
---
Hope you guys do get Legion buffed as the poor boy has already suffered and deserves to be a good killer
---
Timer pause while in chase or dying? 
---
No. That's a jail free card, not anti tunnel. 
---
You only need one change to make it anti-tunnel.
---
It deactivates whenever another player is hooked.
---
Simple as that.
---
deliverance, spine chill, decisive strike, dark sense
---
Removed for oversaturated content
---
Literally does nothing to controllers. People just bitch because they are far to rough with their hardware.
---
Red ranks can be a bit of a mixed bag. Sometimes you get the people who are doing a lot to help their team, sometimes you get the SWFs, and sometimes you get the immersed players who just try to stay alive the longest.
---
I'm a red rank survivor who is objective focused. If I start next to a gen, I'll probably work on it, unless it's a gen that's better left until the end. If I start next to someone, I'll leave them to work on that gen, and I'll head to the middle of the map for another.
---
I'm never going to look for Ruin. Ruin can stay up all match for all I care. I'll cleanse it if I happen to walk by, but I hit enough of the skill checks it's usually not worth my time. It still seems like a decent amount of red rank survivors won't work through it, but it's not nearly as bad as lower ranks.
---
I've led the killer on long chases too, and wondered what was happening when no gens popped. I usually record my chases to see what I could have done better. One of the things I take special note of is if I kept the chase to one side of the map, or if I used a good deal of the map in the chase. If I can keep the chase to one side, chances are gens will get done quicker. If I have to run cross the map, there's a greater chance it's going to disturb people working on one, slowing the progress. Keeping the chase to one side isn't always helpful through, as it can lead to a 3-gen strat for the killer.
---
In the end, you can only count on what you can do. I learned not to care if I escaped or not, but rather to care whether or not I had a good game. Did I do my part in giving the team a good chance to win?
---
Harder than pc defo, not nurse tier though.
---
Ditch the exhaustion side effect and I think that’s fair
---
Your tag makes me view you as less of a person
---
Oof. Now that you point it out...
---
If you are in her terror radius, she doesn't make noise. This has always been the case.
---
IMO, Stun should stay 5 seconds because I've noticed that even that amount of time isn't enough for survivors to get away.
---
Change the exhasted time to match the other exahstion perks.
---
Remove the cannot be used while exhausted.
---
Remove the line "for the duration of the trial" because of the killer perks that move the obsession around.
---
Remove "Killer can be obsessed with multiple survivors at a time." because of clashes with killer perks.
---
Its nerf or nothing
---
New killer looks so cool! Hope he’s top tier!
---
They’re also toxic!
---
If the Spirit is just barely close enough for it to count as you being in the terror radius you won't hear the phasing sound.
---
Ive gotten stuck into the ground with the pig before. Mid-chase. I wanted to cry
---
Some people are really clueless. I haven't played killer in a while so I'm rank 15 and I hopped in to get the monstrous shrine challenge done yesterday and farm a bit while at it, it took me 4 fucking games before someone actually got the idea I want them to farm; they would just keep running away or wouldn't follow me to basement when I furiously spammed M1 at pallets etc. 
---
On the 4th game, I finally got 2 people to come with me to the basement and I hooked them. Finally it is done! then in post-game lobby I realized I haven't equipped the perk. Why live?
---
There's a sensitivity slider in the options menu, and the maximum is too low, there would be an in between if they adjusted the slider, maybe think next time before you comment angrily
---
His last name is Nigerian, iirc.
---
Yesterday I got accused and reported for grabbing someone off a locker. Not for knowing they were there (scratch marks btw), but because grabbing is possible only with cheats apparently. 
---
"You trapped me and I couldn't move!" (actual words)
---
Heavy blow is a direct counter to dead hard so idk if they would implement that in that game, maybe add a timer like 10 seconds after hit or when you leave the chase
---
Pretty spot on cosplays, the Kate tattoo was especially impressive.
---
P3 isn’t with it unless it’s a licensed killer in my opinion, like Freddy has no other cosmetic option
---
Not what I was implying but okay?
---
When is the right time to use the flashlight when they pick up? I can normally blind in pallets, i need save
---
Hi Im TaylorGangKushez on PSN, PS4 Player in Georgia. Usually looking to play SWF. Definitely wanna farm more and test out some perks
---
I think the mega buff you are proposing is quite bad, not to mention that the killer can have multiple obsessions that would turn rancor into a rather op perk goal for the killer ... Here I only see a benefit to the perk but not to the survivors since it encourages the killers to have a permanent noed
---
I’ve been having a ton of fun as Wraith recently, and nailed down a build that helps limit his weaknesses (I play without add ons generally, so keep that in mind)
---
Make Your Choice: you’re good at getting sneaky first hits, so making that the ONLY hit removes the problem of needing to hit again.
---
Nurses Calling: When cloaked you have no terror radius, so you can see healing more commonly than most killers.
---
Save the Best For Last: Niche pick, but Wraith has no tools to end chases faster, if you manage your stacks well this can deny loops and denies overly altruistic play as well.
---
Thrilling Tremors: Minor slowdown as well as telling you where to go while you’re waiting for Make Your Choice to activate.
---
In chases, mindgames will help you better than following blindly.  People tend to relax when running against a Wraith since he’s “easy”...I’ve caught a lot of people at safe pallets by not breaking it and doubling back when I’m sure they’re going to commit to sliding over the pallet.  Had a streamer game a few days ago where when I watched their footage, twice their swf buddies vocally taunted me seconds before they went down, which amused me to no end.  People underestimate Wraith, so be more intelligent than they expect and you’ll see results.

I’ve been wanting The Shining dlc for so long now. I feel like Overlook Hotel would be extremely fun to play, and the axe-wielding Jack Torrence would be terrifying to go against. I can’t wait until they finally make this real
---
Shorten the timer and pause it while dying. Anything else is unnecessary
---
What platform?
---
Except not really-  the actual goal is to pip up, and hiding from the killer is going to do jack shit for your badge points compared to all the successful chase points you could be getting.
---
A survivor could go from hook to gen, injured, like they currently do, and I'd have to feed them 30 seconds of free gen time to get rid of their DS or just take it.
---
DS needs to deactivate when you touch a gen.
---
I do that a lot! But then take them to the gate. I close hatch for points 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
I am not aware of such crash, haven't had it happen yet at least :o
---
Pffft.
---
You mean 60 seconds of being chased and downed in 55 seconds and the killer only needing to wait.
---
Shut the hell up killer. You don't get to fucking talk about balance
---
I don't know what your games are like or how you play, but if you're getting tunneled and called toxic every game, I doubt it's because you're running Lithe and DWM.
---
They should. There’s no reason they shouldn’t. Your player data is saved under a unique cloud ID, but they hide under the excuse of “Licensing”. We want universal data, I don’t care if I have to buy the character again. I just want my BP and my cosmetics.
---
Sounds like jealousy salt to me
---
Yep, anything new or any noteworthy changes to killers, perks, items etc is always called OP or useless right when it's being announced, and not even out yet....
---
At first I thought that was a fart 😂
---
Wow your dc'ed because you missed your skillcheck. Great clip mate
---
Yea pretty frequently when Otz and Puppers aren't streaming. If you or OP want to back up the meme/him being an egotistical asshole with a twitch clip that's not just a joke taken out of context, I'll gladly eat my words.
---
I bought a modded controller to combat this issue. Haven’t used it yet, but will be on Christmas morning and will update as followed. Got mine from amazon from the moddedzone, they sell real Xbox and PS4 controllers that are programmable to Spam a button. Mine was $80 
---
Done Dicking around with BhVR Interactive and a broken game that should have had something as simple as this archaic button massing replaced with a better system.
---
No
---
Party Popper and Sabotage are novel concepts. The Survivor perks are really weak, and as people have pointed out Not Today is basically better Mettle of Man.
---
Yea, that would probably be for the best  
---
I wish i was a bit better at drawing so i could go further with these ideas
---
Wrong.  That would also make it a get out of jail free card if it never expired.
---
The whole point of DS and the changes made was to make it so if a survivor was downed immediately (within 60 seconds) of being unhooked, and then they were picked up, it punished the killer for "tunneling".  This made it so killers at best would need to slug, which gives other survivors a chance to be altruistic and pick them up while the killer chases someone else.
---
But as it works right now, if the killer hooks someone, they get unhooked, and the killer hooks one or more players in the 60 seconds after the first person was unhooked, they are still punished just for being good (or survivors being bad).  It isn't currently anti-tunnel except in very specific conditions.  If they tied it to other survivors being hooked, it would actually be balanced because it would mean the killer is NOT tunneling, which is why it is there in the first place.
---
hes pretty much changed his attitude towards the game recently he kinda just accepts the weird shit instead of complaining but the game is in a far better state than it used to be so it could just be that the stuff he wanted changed got changed but watching him he does seem to have far more fun than he used to playing the game
---
It helps towards the end game when killers just camp hooks too, my way of thinking about it is either it does nothing in which case you probably won the game without much issue or it activates and either allows you to loop the killer for your teammates for an extra two minutes, gives you a second chance at surviving to win the game, or straight up wins you the game by allowing you to make it to the last stretch towards an exit gate.
---
I'm a survivor main and even I can see it's broken hop into a locker he either takes the stun and you can just run away for 5 seconds or hes forced to leave you alone unpunished
---
You're desynced with the host, the killer.
---
I didnt say that shit isnt toxic. I said killers think EVERYTHING that survivors do is toxic. The game caters to killers as it is. Y'all literally just got a character with built in bloodhound that INVITES tunneling. But tunneling isn't toxic right? It's just a tactic you guys use right? 🙄 god knows there are plenty of toxic behaviors that survivors do. Utilizing the items that are given to us in game is not one of those. Using any combination of in game perks at our disposal isn't toxic either. I literally said the dude in this video sucks. But the killer is the one that took the bait. Thank god the shitty survivor got what he deserved, but as a player it's your call as to whether or not you answer to a survivor being an asshole when you have other options. We can't avoid a killer playing like a cocksucker. There's one of him and it's his game. It doesn't matter who receives more toxicity. The problem is that it happens at all and to everyone but the MAJORITY of killers IME act like y'all are angels and that you only act toxic because survivors act toxic.
---
Yeah I was going to say this, I'm a red rank survivor and I think people (on PC) are having growing pains getting used to him but he seems to be doing very very well. Rage mode isn't nearly as constricting as the chainsaw dash is.
---
Probably just shit matchmaking, or the host has crap internet
---
How does that help make them one hit downs when they’re already injured
---
They could always get Mick from Wolf Creek
---
I don’t want to be obsessed with multiple survivors...STBFL is one of my favorite perks.
---
Yeah, a better version of his power. That was my point. And being more powerful plus his setup are the only two main differences. It's a slight variation on an already existing power. Much like Michael and ghostface. That's the issue with new killers now. it's always a slight variation on  an already existing killer. Are they really this lacking in the creative game design already?
---
what does the text say?
---
Interesting.
---
Yeah and when that actually happens more then once every 30 matches then you can complain.
---
Also nice try. You're definitely a killer main, so do us all a favor and go play the game and complain to your mommy when 1 person escapes every 5 matches
---
20 secs is half a 2man gen btw :)
---
I'll try and find the clip but some dude tipped him $10 to run a certain build, it wasn't working, and tru3 just shit on the guy for how bad the build was. Imo, the most recent that I'm aware of him being a bit of a dick is when him and the youtuber Scott jund had disputes about spirit/counterplaying her and he got really mad during that if you watched both of his videos.

---
The only killers worse than Legion are Bubba and Clown. And even then, just barely.
---
I don't really care where people are from as long as they're interesting and cool
---
&gt; Yes they make mistakes but not on the scale some people think they do.
---
If I had the same quality of releases at my job, I'd be fired.   They should be held to a higher standard than the shit quality of releases they have been pushing.
---
I totally agree, I feel like it gives a little bit more freedom of playing on any platform anywhere with your account.
---
My issue for me is the key words I said in the last message “intuitive”. Many times I don’t feel like I made mistake, I’m sprinting towards the pallet and trying to throw it done before the killer gets to me only to suddenly drop it in front of me when I get there. I’ll admit that maybe I’m a moron because I don’t understand the intricacies of how to get the pallet to drop the way I want it too but if that’s the case then I still think it needs to be adjusted because I believe they be intuitive.
---
On the other hand when I play killer, I notice people that sit on gens all game across the map from me and do nothing else. Never try to unhook teammates or take a chase for them. They just keep plugging away on gens and hiding every time they hear my terror radius.
---
I don't run slowdown perks so I'm not going to waste 30 seconds looking behind rocks or in lockers. There are a lot of times where I'll give hatch to the person who did maybe 1 gen but took chases to get the pressure off teammates. Then the person who sat on gens the whole time says "wow give that person hook when I did all the gens? Okay." 
---
Chances are if you did 3 or 4 full gens, it's because you played gen jockey while your teammates did all the difficult stuff. Which is a good strat if you're in a coordinated SWF, but only then. That's why I decided to willingly get into a chase and never hide when it isn't necessary as survivor. You taking the killer's attention to let your teammates heal and take a break is a lot more useful than holding M1 all game.
---
Wait ive literally mained legion since they came out and this is the dumbest take how is this upvoted so much. The frenzy isnt supposed to be lethal, its supposed to be fast so that you can injure a group of survivors in a blink and then run them down as a regular m1 with the added benefit that everyone’s a one shot

You are the dummy as well since you can't accept when you were wrong either. Okay i complained about the technically wrong thing. Latency is the problem and not hitboxes. But now i'm not sure what you meant with that latency has been fixed with dedicated servers as you said earlier. If it's fixed why are we getting these outrageous hits? On p2p with green ping it was alot better for me then it currently is. So with dedicated servers something got fucked up.
---
&gt;leave the private schools with \*real\* teachers out of this
---
A very weird thing to gatekeep.
---
True Idk why they keep nerfing him
---
He was good a long time ago he just needed the backwards walking nerf
---
Tall man
---
But wont the survivors immediately run miles away from you, them moment you step into line of sight. Thats what I've been getting all the time.
---
I’m just curious about how the effects work, not just as killer but also as survivor
---
Once in thirty matches?it's constant usage seriously it's so easy to abuse and why would I lie about maining survivor?
---
When I say terror radius, I am referring to the radius that extends from her husk when she is phasing.  If you exit that radius, and then go back into it, I believe the sound persists. It isn't perfect from what I've seen.
---
I thought Legion was from Alberta
---
No need to prove anything. Queue times for survivors are already long enough, and they will only be getting longer if the sheer stressfulness of playing killer 2ill not be addressed.
---
How i feel when I'm running inner strength
---
I was doing the crouch thing one night, when I found out that ghost face could crouch and move at the same time, so I wanted to see if it was stupid looking. Mid chase with a dwight he dropped a pallet and we both just stood there and crouch spammed each other. Nothing toxic, just communication with one another
---
Perfect cosplay, perfect nea.
---
You should've seen this sub when they came out
---
And I have never felt like the game is survivor sided. I used to play killer regularly until I decided to just main survivor, and I've been playing since release day on console. Unless I get a potato killer, I've always felt like I had to fight to win. Especially when queueing solo. Because it's not just the killer who's your enemy. It's your shit ass rando teammates who think they're amazing after watching a bunch of OchiDo videos on YouTube.
---
I don't have Nurses yet but I just use Nemisis on him it's serving me quite well
---
It would be to fast if you held down one button.
---
I mean, he's really really clunky. I don't see him being very good when there are other killers with similar, but more useful powers. Honestly, I think that oni would be a lot better if he could kill pallets a lot faster in demon rage mod, like billy.
---
Oh, I thought it was different for every player? Cool
---
*Chuckles*  I am in danger
---
The way I personally play killer (as a survivor main) is even if a survivor is saved right in front of my face I let them go and chase the unhooker. I hate getting farmed and then instantly downed so I don’t do it when I play killer
---
You can report them for being unsportsmanlike or trolling.
---
Oops!
---
The whole reason being to pip up is an opinion, like how my whole reason  is to survive and not die, or kill everyone.
---
You can remap it in Settings, mine is on RB
---
Imagine a swf with the best looper using oOo and everybody else using interconnected. The Killer would never get close to anyone.
---
This sounds like someone just bored and wanting some type of human interaction through angry messages. Block.
---
no, it's just the matchmaking
---
Aha a mistake that did not go unnoticed
---
I was in Africa a little while ago to visit my family. I was watching a scary movie about the paranormal. That night, I've never felt as blissful, considering all that Satanic shit was happening somewhere in either America, South America, Europe or Japan.
---
This is beautiful.
---
I would kill for a glow stick ghostface skin. The company seems pretty ok with cosmetics so far. Here's hoping!
---
not defending the perk. defending the reason why someone might use it. and with some of these rift challenges aka sacrificing 2 people during the egc, it could be needed

So ruin our bumpers instead of a button? Fuck no!
---
There’s no real reason to struggle other than immersion, ok? I don’t care about immersion, especially since no one would realistically play mindgames with some big brute trying to put them on a hook.
---
Woah!!!
---
But that isn't the killers fault.  That's yours for getting downed while rescuing....
---
&gt;Doctor rework keeps being mentioned but nothing has come of it
---
 Next Midchapter.
---
&gt;Generator speeds are a problem that has been a hot topic for years and has yet to be properly looked at
---
Gen speeds were increased from 60 to 80 seconds, any more and survivor gets way more boring.
---
&gt;Borrowed Time's design changes were supposed to be a nerf, but being able to use it infinite times in a match makes it a buff
---
Compared to the original BT that protected both people, the unhooked and their rescuer?
---
&gt;Disconnect penalties for survivors were mentioned earlier this year and were supposed to come out with the Oni chapter, but have been delayed.
---
How is this a pro-killer change? DCing survivors hurt other suvivors more than anything else.
---
It has literally never been a better time to play killer.
---
Well there you go, there’s no way to make it easier. Holding down a button would make no sense, especially if you are struggling on second hook.
---
How would this work though, would the glasses be the mask or would they cut the sheet around his head so he still has his original mask
---
I'd rather get rid of the whole rank system all together. Let everyone play with anyone. I doubt gameplay would really be affected, other than faster matchmaking.
---
Imagine having a Rancor
---
Thank you so much :) 
---
Und hallo zurück! ;)
---
Rank doesn't mean anything. You will get chased eventually but its stupid to be chased unnecessarily at the start of the game. Play however you like but im not the one complaining
---
You are right, I consider myself a good survivor but I rank and double pip to easily and sometimes I just dick around. I've been playing killer and I see that the ranking for them is tough as hell honestly the difficulty should be switched somewhat between the two rolls
---
Yes, preferably I like small game at 1 or 2 cause I don't like the range being to big for traps and totems.
---
Coming from an Xbox Rank 1, he is kinda bad.
---
Dang. Thanks.
---
If it's so good then why doesn't anyone use it? It's shit now. No reason to use it over Adrenaline or BT, actually useful perks
---
Yeah I get that, I also keep it at low tiers for precision. This is valuable info, thanks!.
---
I like. I like very much.
---
I had NOED one game as huntress and the game was done in like 5 minutes and the survivor crouched at a gate and I felt bad
---
なに？？？

That flick is ridiculously strong as it is, and I won't be surprised if it gets toned down. It makes him damn near impossible to loop or counter unless he fucks up.
---
it's easy to just cop out and make american characters.
---
I don’t like ruin, generally.  It gets too easy to rely on it and the moment it gets destroyed you’ve lost your slowdown for the rest of the game.  Thrilling Tremors provides less slowdown at any moment, but it applies it throughout the game.  Plus, as I said, it tells you where to go next.  If all gens get blocked but one, you head to that gen and now no gens are being worked on.  It helps you apply pressure and that helps slow games, even without Ruin.
---
That's everyone watching streamers thinking they are gods at the game. They are average rank 1s, AVERAGE.
---
Wow, I really love most of these! Especially the killer perks. The Magician sounds like an interesting fellow.
---
Try this:
---
Ruin, pop, discordance (tier 1 if possible) and surveillance. All these perks make for excellent gen defense when put together and spirits high mobility with phase walking makes it very easy to patrol gens, making this build perfect if you prefer a more defensive playstyle
---
If you like being more aggressive then try this:
---
Whispers, predator, stridor and nurses calling. These perks are all for tracking and make it easy to find ands catch people quickly, however predator and stridor are only needed if you are inexperienced with spirit. If you are confident with playing her then swap predator and stridor for discordance and bbq/ruin.
---
They're*
---
Complaining about button mashing and wiggling your analog stick while playing a game lmao
---
Onions are so last century, industrial strength anal lube works just as well and it doesnt fade.
---
I rank up stupidly easily as survivor. I am not even as good at chases as you. I have maybe a minute max if you give really strong structures. Often a lot less than that.
---
So like, I do a gen, get a save or two, heal a survivor or two, and go down in 20 seconds 3 times and EZ pip.
---
Is\*
---
Omg stop annoying the killer and jump into it the moment you see it. Then shit like this won't happen to you.
---
to be fair you completely, COMPLETELY missed the second hit, but y'know, broken dedicated servers that they are yet to address (if they have mentioned fixing them within the last 3 weeks i haven't played then im unaware but AFAIK they havent said a word since release of the servers.) The dedis legit made huntress the most OP killer in the game and i do not deserve to get penalized for leaving the game the second i hear her lullaby when the devs are the reason she is so broken. Its not an intentional thing so why punish me for leaving the game when you can't defend against a huntress? She will 100% of the time hit your ghost hitbox thats a full second behind you. Its a joke.
---
They just need to make her speed 10%. That way people who don't know how to face her stfu.
---
And that is fair enough, everyone has different opinions on where the game is at and we happen to disagree. My main issue was bringing up them prioritizing the release of cosmetics over content and fixes.
---
Of course! Though from what I'm seeing once he gets rolling Oni has plenty of rage to go around.
---
Server latency causes the timer to appear desynced. It's a bug that was present a while back before it was fixed, guess its back now.
---
Fuck, I’ll have to go to the local Dollar General and see if I can find some.
---
Me too. Mosquitos don’t do gens.
---
Why is oni ass on console? I have been played him for about 5 to 6 matches and he seems pretty strong. Kinda like hillbilly, except replaces the availability of his power with more forgiving misses, at least for my dumbass who holds the chainsaw button down when I miss and I get launched to the other half of the map.
---
Off the top of my head, Fortnite is consistently having features disabled due to game breaking bugs, No Man's Sky and and Fallout 76 both had months of development hell /after/ they were released. New content inevitably means new bugs. The devs have specifically stated that they are putting future events on hold for more quality control, and the game is for the most part playable and enjoyable in its current state. I definitely have some issues with the game, and unlike the OP, I don't think making jokes should be off limits but it is not bad enough to be so bothered about it.
---
If you do it fast as opposed to slow than yeah. Also that’s not what I said, I said holding down a button would be faster. 
---
I don’t think the devs care if you have cramps either.
---
Yeah i'm sure there are no-lifers with p3 already, why do you care..
---
Purrfection
---
Yeah or when you drop a pallet and get hit by a normal survivor. Or when you vault and are like a foot away and the clown can still somehow slash you with his 5 inch knife
---
I'd agree with this, not only is he strong but he is freaking scary to play against. You just hear his breathing heavy and him going into freak out mode to bash you with a bat....
---
This really makes me want a gentleman killer. 
---
Spring Heel Jack
---
Jack The Ripper
---
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street 
---
Imagine a level in the streets of Victorian London.
---
I agree. It's pretty bad for most killers, but I actually enjoy it when I'm playing Trapper or Hag.
---
Scott was way more heated than Tru was in those videos. Tru is wrong about spirit IMO, but he wasn't uncivil in those videos.
---
That's the icon for Underperform, an unused perk.
---
I guess the reason DC penalties being delayed is pro-killer because people have less reason not to disconnect perhaps?
---
There's no comparison between the two totally different games. It doesn't take long to get good at dbd just having awareness of where the killer is and learning the loops. Big thing is figuring out your playstyle then finding the character that matches it and leveling it to 50 and use it to earn bloodpoints to level other characters and killers through that main character. Prestige your main to get access to better stuff and get more bloodpoints. Easy to level if you do the archive challenges and daily challenges.
---
sauce
---
but it doesn’t? try it in-game
---
DS is fine the way it is. If it was ever gonna get nerfed and changed again, then NOED along with it. Thanks. Periodtdtdtdt.  
---
. &lt;--- this thing
---
you're just getting hit through the pallet? means you made the mistake of misjudging when the attack hit you and still threw down the pallet. this is a you issue, not a game issue.
---
Still seems op. It's a hell of a lot easier to get then mettle was, even pre nerf. Can be stacked 4 times, and counters hill billy, bubba, oni, myers, and ghost face, not to mention a huge amount of perks, and ultra rare add ons. Rip devour hope, haunted grounds, make your choices, Iridescent hatchets ect. 
---
Jesus imagine playing bubba, finally getting a chainsaw hit and they just get a speed boost and get away. 
---
It'd be better if you couldn't get more than 1 token and it applied deep wounds instead of injuring.
---
Problem solved! 😁🤣
---
idk, it happes. I once got like -300 for a sarcastic comment lol
---
I mean, it sounds like you WERE camping, but that's just whatever, no reason to message the killer over it.
---
I don’t think it needs change
---
Ah yes, at last I can prevent from being tunneled by 40 seconds.
---
All I'm saying is if I can play R6Siege on PC with a controller and not care I could play DBD and not care
---
Getting hit while the pallet was already down.
---
They try to track down their family, so they can show off the masks they have and the food they made by themselves
---
When exactly was he good?
---
He quite literally is a pioneer of the game both in terms of how long he's been playing (since beta) and in terms of creating builds that have become meta. Fucking nobody played ghostface before he started playing the split pressure GF build. Nothing changed about GF, people just realized how viable he is after Tru showcased it.
---
Hate him all you want but he is a fogwhisperer for a reason.
---
Did we watch the same videos? Scott was fine. He uploaded a 10 minute video. Tru3 replied to him with a 45 minute video.
---
But we have more survivors than we have killers.
---
**_So is the demogorgan just be a deformed Nancy and Steve mutation?_**
---
Been rank 1 twice. Currently at 12. Would be at rank 1 again but for the past 6 months every random has been braindead so I can't do much but run the killer for 10 minutes while everyone else crouch walks in a circle
---
they need to make a spongebob DBD episode... PLEASEEE
---
That's only if he's comboing addons + perks. OG Freddy had way more slow than New Freddy did, as PART OF HIS BASE KIT, and nobody really complained.
---
It really does though, 3 weeks ago I tested it with my friends to see how long it takes to wiggle out from slow to medium to fast. Sure medium and fast were pretty much the same but when I did it slow it was 2 seconds slower
---
Killer chasing with mad grit weapon spamming always get me screaming. Its scares me more than chainsaws
---
One time as trapper I had 1k, 3 survivors at gate tea gagging, then I had an idea. Walk away and trap every entrance and exit in the gas station
---
Thanks to their overconfidence, I got 3k that round.
---
Slugging is not countering DS if that's what you mean by easy to counter. The point of DS is to avoid a quick second hook, and if the killer slugs you to "avoid" it then its always a possibility that you will be picked up, thus DS did its job as you avoided the hook. It also wastes a fair chunk of time to slug and wait for DS to expire. Survivors will be doing gens while the killer stands there like a doofus.
---
It wouldn’t change the fact that BHVR realizes their poor map design.  They’re not likely to rework all the maps, so...
---
* Having an unintentional resemblance to gameplay elements from Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; ...).
---
It'S nOt A bUg, It'S a FeAtUrE.
---
That'd td be awesome! I could finally play Nea as a survivor.
---
Just slug them instead of letting them do the gen?
---
Basically you’d get similar skill checks like you do now but they’d be constant until the gen popped. Would take like 7 seconds. If you missed a skill check though it’s be over and the part would be wasted. Used to deplete the toolbox too instantly.
---
It would bring back the infinites that caused them to nerf the perk in the first place
---
I guess if we have to we can split up Legion to fill in the gaps.
---
Aim for the neck, that's where the killers camera is. It used to be in the head but a bug allowed killers to look through walls so the camera was lowered to fix it. So aim for the neck to actually blind them.
---
If you see the bar light up, you’re making progress. If you wiggle TOO slow, the struggle bar is greyed out instead since you’re no longer progressing toward that action
---
You say that but im still getting a lot of them in game at rank 1 and they play like trash and are just cancer
---
Says he only moves at 110% when absorbing blood.
---
Pig too
---
Not today is just mettle of man the other two survivor perks seem to be worthless and the killer perks are really powerful.
---
Bump those numbers up rookie!
---
wait... missing heal checks notifies the killer? shiiiit
---
Its like hooking one of the lookalikes survivors or someone unhook immediately?
---
so what the pallet is down and you're on one side, the killer swings into the pallet on the other side and you're getting hit? can't say that has ever happened to me so can't help you much. are you vaulting the pallet as it gets destroyed or smacked? that counts as a hit.
---
Yesterday I was using ds and I had a pretty solid team for rank 16..anyways, during the endgame I was hooked right next to the exit gate. I used to as an opportunity to bodyblock once I was unhooked. Either way I was getting out by crawling or DSing. Killer picked me up, I DSed, and got out.
---
I'm a Myers main, every god damn fucking game someone teabags at a pallet. I call it Suicide by Stalk.
---
At launch, kinda. He could guarantee downs in less than 30 seconds and there was nothing the Survivor could do about it. It wasn't amazing but it was definitely annoying to play against.
---
I'm pretty sure Yamaoka's Family Residence got touched up as well to resemble the Sanctum of Wrath.
---
Next to nobody played GF until Tru started playing GF like that. Now they're fucking every other game. 
---
He should get credit for that. It's nothing completely genius, but he did start this stealth killer meta.
---
Yeah I’ve been playing since the week after it came out. I know how wiggling works. The whole time it was lit up
---
Understandable.  Honestly, I felt bad even DC'ing for that but with the way survivor is right now I had just had enough.  I'm on Xbox so we currently still have the basement bug, wiggle bug, and then 5+ minute queues for survivor, about half of the games we try to connect to we get a "host unreachable" error with like 47 dialog boxes, killers dodge if you have what they arbitrarily determine are too many items or too many cosmetics or too many fingers, etc., etc.  By myself and with friends last night I tried to play survivor for the better part of 3 hours and earned fewer points than I earned in the 1 killer game I did to complete my killer challenges for level III.  It's absurd.
---
If you call counterarguing crying, then sure I guess. I mean, people will do whatever they can to shit on Tru I guess. The dude can't even explain his stance without being called a whiner apparently. 
---
To be clear, I don't agree with Tru's stance at all and think Spirit is uncounterable as fuck, but I think their argument was civil.
---
removed for name shaming
---
Welcome Fam.! Muc Love
---
Dude on the bottom got gen rushed for sure
---
It's always a Freddy
---
*much
---
I play deadbydaylight twice week and I've been able to keep at rank 1consistently seems to me your just bad making excuses for why you lose
---
Freddy could apply a heavy amount of pressure via keeping as many survivors asleep as possible. When it came down to actual chases he was otherwise bad (Excellent at getting that first hit though) but when you grind the game to an absolute halt it's only a matter of time until you get everyone.
---
I’ve yet to check the new one, but I was so happy to get Self Care from the last one, that perk is so useful
---
BBQ isn't that great only most killer roster tho. (Not with the nerds it got)
---
Also survivors have much more challenging queue time! :P
---
I play Survivor more often than Killer but I'm still firmly of the belief that everyone should play both sides.
---
Once you experience a few games as Killer you'll understand why you get tunneled (because you're the next Survivor the Killer sees, why would they give you a free pass?) and why you get facecamped (because you're being an annoying little ass and ensuring you die and are denied points is worth it for the karma).
---
Then that still needs to be addressed. It shouldn't look fine for one person, but looks like you escaped for someone else. It's hard to judge if some games are almost right on, but other games had the killer hitting you beyond his attack range just because it looked right for the killer.
---
Surprisingly interesting and relatively balanced perks. I'd love to see almost all of these in game (not today is too situational and strange imo, as well as being too similar to mettle).
---
Just downvote and then upvote
---
That pressure was pointless when he had to wait 7 seconds to attack.
---
I mained of freddy, he needed slowdown to stand a chance.
---
New fred doesnt need quite as much.
---
I offer a warm bowl of [chicken soup for the soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwMaTn5HFOA) for anyone who's ever been the victim of this.
---
Idk if this is a bug or what but sometimes when I get picked up I can't wiggle at all and I checked my thumbstick and it's all fine and the option to wiggle wasn't even there and this usually happens when I get grabbed from a locker, while doing gen or while vaulting a window
---
Run it with unbreakable and tenacity. If you get downed right off of hook, either way, you're getting back up.
---
Trust me. I'm fine. Could stand to juke better but I am a good player. But I keep getting paired with absoultely HORRIBLE players. For almost 6 months I've had just the worst random imaginable. It's insane.
---
Also, fuck you asshole. Why don't you go do the world a favor and destroy your router. Don't got anything good to say then don't say nothing
---
Yeah it's quite loud but as a steve main its okay
---
I calls it as I sees it
---
yea, but server desync is an issue not easily addressed in a lot of games.
---
Yes, but I’m. It seeing as frequently as the Plague’s map when that first came out. I probably get the new map 1 out of 6 games
---
he’s like the perfectly balanced killer. what are you smoking?
---
I'm not sure if it did get changed and then reverted back, but when the game first came out that's how spine chill worked. I stopped playing for a year and a half in between though.
---
That can’t handle the JOCK
---
Usually if a killer dose it they think you deserve the points and that it’s *mainly* your team’s fault you would have lost or you seem incredibly new to the game and they wanna help
---
Bro, this made me chuckle. Although I think the rattlesnake in heat couple be something else.
---
Why can't we have any constructive discussion? Instead of just saying let it die
---
i’m guessing because you’re essentially applying sloppy with the pin that gives mangled and then hemorrhage with Blood Echo, because you can injure survivors very easily as legion as long as you’re getting a hook someone out there is most likely getting the afflictions, it also makes chases easier as they can’t use their exhaustion perks, combine it with BBQ and you’ve got a nasty build imo.
---
That was clean.
---
i wouldnt message someone but i would 100% be salty.  
---
whatd ya end up getting points wise? 15k maybe?  
---
thats the only part of this so called "strategy" that bothers me.  nobody gets any points.  
---
i played against a camping wraith the other night.  he'd hook and stand nearby cloaked.  so innovative.   and we finished 3 out of 5 gens.  he got like 19k. everyone else had garbage too.  
---
i dont tell people how to play the game.  its your money spent, play however you want to.  but as a killer main, thats gotta be boring as fuck.  
---
ive played this game for 2 years as a killer and i am yet to get any sort of salty message.
---
BBQ gives double bloodpoints ofc it's great the fuck kinda shit you smokin
---
Damn I already have all 4
---
That was a bug that was supposedly fixed.
---
When I said moaning it sounded like a pleasurable moan than a painful one
---
Most people ran dead hard with balanced landing before, as much as it would disgust me but I understood it and didn't think it was that rough to deal with
---
You’re much safer on the ground than in a killers grasp. Picking you back up opens up chances for a flashlight save. You can crawl away. You can unbreakable. There’s a whole list of things that can be done here. On top of all of that you don’t get hooked.
---
it counts toward xp on my steam profile, so it counts for everything i want it to count for
---
Haha i love that perk for memes! Some poor survivors try body blocking guy to his last hook. I swing and I swing and I swing. They looked so confused!
---
No, I left and still had one, and after that mach I got another one and that put me at two :/
---
Billy about to trampoline off buildings
---
I got that 1 point from a previous match, that rpund I didn't get any
---
I never thought of this before but I’d think it was a good idea if the speed burst was removed but kept the silent falling and stagger.
---
Good thinking👍
---
Charge addons are bugged??? Whatt
---
Hold on. Trapping the exit gates is completely legit, the survivors have eyes in the head, so it‘s possible to ignore the traps. Tunneling is just ruining someones experience
---
If you don't need BP then literally anything else is better??
---
It's easy to bypass and you can sue literally any search perks in its place.
---
Apparently you're not allowed to like both just because they're asian, judging from the downvotes. I guess it's racist to think asian girls are cute?
---
it's all fun and games until you get matched with a duo of head on gamers that are spamming locker notifications
---
yes
---
Ahh insults the basis of every good argument and I highly doubt you run into nothing but braindead players even one competent person can end a game quick if uninterrupted going from gen to gen. Oh and no u
---
Thana procs if anyone is injured at all, doesnt matter if they get hit, i run ruin, bbq, M&amp;A, and thana so I dont see how blood echos would improve my build at all, but those pins are pretty neat since I cant use sloppy anymore
---
I'm an almost brand new player to the game and I am constantly getting matched with rank 8 killers or better, most of whom have used Oni the last two days. 
---
My first impression is that he is a mobility god that is next to impossible to avoid. The only time I've made it out against him was in the Underground Complex where there is so many compartmented rooms where breaking his LOS allows me to escape him. 
---
I've been ravaged and creampie'd on every other occasion and map as you can just mouse flick with him to turn around debris and never lose distance your target. All in all i'm not a fan, but maybe its to do with how I'm getting matched with high rank killers with loads of teachables, most of whom use BBQ&amp;Chili and noed.
---
thats not what you said though. You said he's the worst killer, and oni is just as viable at m1
---
Yup, they've been bugged since 3.4.0 and I thought maybe 3.4.1 was gonna fix them but nope they're still bugged. Even though I've seen BHVR address it on Twitter it still doesn't seem to be a widely known issue. Hence why I wish there was an in-game warning at the least.
---
I have custom files for my offerings and I don’t crash
---
Thanks!
---
I want back the ability to see ranks of other survivors in the lobby. It sucks going solo queue as i would end up with 1 hook of death or others doing litreal nothing.
---
ok. still gonna use it for double bloodpoints though. get mad.
---
Thank you!
---
To be fair, stuff like wall hacks feel unfair if you have no idea on the conditions and counters (since he’s probably newer)
---
Wow Bhvr sure is diverse they believe in the moon projection theory
---
I mean... ranks won’t change that at all. These guys all escaped. 
---
I solo queue with reds and purples who don’t do shit all the time.
---
\*huntress mains\* "It's free real estate."
---
"I play to win" while proxy camping hook with a killer that has no terror radius. Such skill, so much fun! 🙄 Get used to hate mail, it's usually what happens when people are trash at the game.
---
He got the huntress teaser wrong. That's if I am remembering the right guy.
---
Bro, the skill level is contagious. Thanks for the inspiration
---
You could also flip this and say killers are scared of playing a match *without* ruin and bbq :P
---
BBQ is god tier. It’s better than almost all other aura reading perks like Bitter Murmur and Rancor (though Rancor is fun sometimes for the Mori aspect) plus you get 100% more bloodpoints. Add Thrill and Distressing and I always max out with at least 80k a match
---
The only nerf freddy should have is losing bloodlust when placing snares.  It’s dumb that he can mindlessly bloodlust survivors without any strategy or interactivity.
---
I like some of these changes, honestly I think dead hards no collision is unique and fair due to its short dash, Lithe is fair, it makes sense for you to go fast af boi after hitting a fast vault. Like I said I don't think BL should have any speed boost as I don't see how tf dropping from like a 15-30 foot drop would make you go ZOOOM
---
Thhats why you run Jeff. To mildly inconvenience the killer.
---
Tunneling is obviously a lot worse but like still the gate wasn’t even open bruh like really your gonna cover it all
---
The fact that their feral frenzy doesn’t synergies with certain perks anymore, even though they’re literally using the same weapon.
---
I understand your POV but personally I’d like BHVR to leave it as it is. If he can only dash for a limited amount of time unlike hillbilly, at least give him some pros to allow him to compete in the higher tier killers.
---
You insulted first asshole. Already having a shitty day, and while normally I ignore garbage, I might just make an exception for you.
---
And yes, when I'm the only other competent person on the team, I'll die, because the killer realizes this, tunnels and camps me and nothing gets done.
---
Or, while I'm getting chased all 3 are in a chat together, gen rush, then leave while I'm getting hooked.
---
Or, my personal favorite, someone who CAN run the killer around better then me screws me over, gets me hooked, and proceeds to farm me til I die.
---
I'm the unluckiest person on the fucking planet. Any game I play, no matter how good I get at it, I lose. Why? Who knows.
---
Now sit down, shut up, and leave me the fuck alone
---
He’s bad *for us*. Console players usually get the short end of the stick when it comes to strong killers. We’re at a massive disadvantage because of framerates and hyper low sensitivity.
---
Unnecessary wear and tear on your controller.
---
well its not a licenses dlc to anywhere from next year's Halloween till 10- 15 years. It definitionally possible, just not likely soon.
---
PC: Yikegodx
---
Looking for SWF groups to join and even open to joining a discord group! Currently red rank survivor (2 atm) and purple ranks killer
---
Same. I even give last survivor hatch sometimes. I’ll still get salty messages, I’ll even give them a break like let them heal off the ground and I’ll still get ‘sweaty killer’ stuff. Do you actually want me to hand you the game?
---
I see I struck a nerve
---
Most people? I rarely see people run both
---
Wait I thought we the bugs patched out yesterday?
---
I would love to help them learn but the killer wont be nice most of the time and yea its jus disappointing to see teammates doing nothing and it hurts my soul to die with one hook not being rescued.
---
I think that was shortly after the PTB, because I believe it was nearly impossible to reveal Ghostface with the changes made from PTB to live so they made the field wider then later they made it slightly smaller.
---
it’s definitely a niche perk but i think if you hook someone see someone else with BBQ and head towards them and if they’re injured they won’t be able to use any exhaustion perks and will be leaving more blood on the ground for easier tracking if they aren’t running, obviously you lose the blood if you’re in frenzy but if all survs are injured it might be worth it just to run towards one with frenzy to get there faster.
---
...every killer can bloodlust. Thats kinda the point of bloodlust
---
I run away because I don’t care about farming. Not worth my time. I want to play the game
---
Lmao this is true , in my swf group I do all the gens xd
---
On PS4 and PC (Steam).  Not on Xbox, Windows Store (PC) or Switch yet.
---
Just because he's "perfectly balanced" doesn't make him one of the best killers. He also:
---
1. Lacks map pressure
---
2. Low game pressure at the start of the game. Pressure at the start is vital unless the power makes up for it late game like the Oni. Overall too much downtime
---
3. Tier 3 is good but he can still be looped
---
Freddy, Ghostface, plague, demogorgon, hag, huntress are all better.
---
Oh damn I wish we had that prototype menu UI, that looks clean tbh. Might just be me though. Pretty interesting though!
---
It isn't you... Completely anyway. Just a shitty day
---
As a legion main, I rarely notice anything tbh. The speed increase is cool. Sometimes your ability doesn’t do what you’re used to regarding the old builds people would use but to me I don’t mind legion at the current state. It is a little annoying that they continue to nerf legion.
---
It's an unwritten rule if there's one survivor left after super early DC's then sure, let's farm and you get hatch.
---
When I got to the struggle part I was out of ideas, oh well, I'm glad you liked it!
---
This is so sad when I play killer and I face a very bad survivor I just feel so bad like I don’t want this isn’t funny for me or for the survivor , why are u doing this ranking system?
---
I wish we got black Meg and white Claudette from the prototypes/super early alphas as new survivors.
---
I don't see why he would get nerfed. While his blood fury is very strong it's a very finite duration and it does take a while to build up initially.
---
Pls
---
i agree with you, but a person who knows how to play Myers can overcome those setbacks
---
It's not the point of the clip but I'd like to point out how this is a perfect example of DS hitting killers even when they're not tunneling. Though yours didn't actually hit
---
I want to know what it looks like why do you care?
---
I’ve had multiple killers “fake farm” recently. They pretend to farm then start killing once their challenge is done. It’s hard to gain survivor’s trust because there are killers out there exploiting it. A few bad apples...
---
ye exactly i think hes in a pretty good state its just the guy sounded so sure of himself and no offense to survivors but if 4 survivors complain about something and 1 killer complaining the survivors will be the louder voice
---
&gt; it's usually what happens when people are trash at the game.
---
Like continually saving against a killer that's sitting right the fuck there? Stupid shit like that, right?
---
Sad oink :c
---
Whether it be server or not, it is extremely glitchy and it’s the reason why me a bunch of survs refuse to play DBD anymore. Why put so much effort into playing a broken game when you get smacked by janky af hitboxes. Dedicated servers BTW.
---
Pretty sure hunntress is deeper into Russia than that
---
Yeah They said they fixed it but it still happens sometimes
---
True.  Team just couldn't stay up long enough to allow my timer to run out and a killer, not in this situation but when the DS actually works which is most of the time, gets punished for playing too well.
---
Sound like rank 15-20
---
F U  
---
That's what you get  
---
Yes It is
---
He can, as far as I know. I bought the chapter as soon as it dropped and tried him out in a custom game.
---
If you really want to challenge yourself, stop running Pop, Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, and/or a bunch of other slowdown perks and addons.
---
He's just running his mouth. He might get nerfed, or buffed. We need to wait and see. Either way he'll be left alone for a while.
---
Doesn’ every moan sound like a sexual one?
---
Just remove gens. Survivors cant gen rush if there are no gens to rush *taps forehead*
---
It’s definitely more FUN than ruin. It can take survivors a lot of time to find hooked people.
---
BBQ is fine. It's just an information perk that offers good BPs.
---
I always wished we got Black Meg and White Claudette because it meant Blendettes would never exist.
---
Of course any killer can do well with lots of playtime, but I'm just looking at their powers and what they can do. Myers is simply held back by his power unless the survivors feed him and make mistakes which good survivors won't do
---
Feng would probably be very embarrassed with so many people seeing her undies
---
I'd say I saw it once every 3-4 games
---
[here it is](https://imgur.com/a/N3NvgvJ)
---
In reality, boil over is one of the worst survivor perks in the game. The effect really isn't that strong on the killer. I've never had someone use it against me and wiggle out. IMO, breakout would be better combined with flip flop and unbreakable, although I would never waste three perk slots trying to breakout of the killers grasp
---
Ayy another proud Happy Clown perk user!
---
So 1 out of every 12-16 players. That’s the overwhelming minority
---
I have no clue why you’re getting downvoted when it’s the truth.
---
It was like 23k one match and 25k the other. I never worry too much about points personally. To me nothing beats the feeling of getting a 4k. For me, that's where the fun of the game is.
---
Strange, I see many saying that the new map is dark, but for me Haddonfield is the one that is very dark now (light and textures), the others, so far, seem normal
---
and as long as the killer doesn't run franklins
---
Lol was posted at 2 am
---
I really really want a Werewolf type killer. Before Oni came out I was thinking of a killer that uses blood. Werewolf hits x amount of times for blood then howls and can sprint on all fours.
---
hEHe I'm zOo Guddd xdxdxd, cOme aNd gEt mE duUuD *Gets downed ez*
---
...kIllErz tOo oP!
---
my game updated this morning while i was playing R6, I played after it finished and it says that the bugs too wiggling and falling through the map in the basement should be fixed, i will say the one game i got to play before leaving for work was a Legion who never managed to hook someone or even hit me so i haven’t been put in the basement yet to see for myself.
---
It seems like you don’t have much respect for someone else’s preference on playing the game. Regardless of its shittiness, it’s viable to play like a total fucking asshole (I know that people who play this way are cunts). Although, if that’s what they want to do, they BOUGHT the game, and DEVS keep those tactics in the game, so deal with it. Don’t complain about other players for using mechanics DEVS allow; complain to the DEVS themselves.
---
i get hit after I already dropped it. I'll drop it and get hit 0.5 secs after i already drooped it. 
---
I've played more than enough to know when to drop and when i'm gonna be hit through the pallet, but the Deducted servers are killing me.
---
I mean, skill or not, I won. They didn't pop gens and I predicted exactly what they would do and I was right. I'm not gonna pretend I'm some prodigy at the game or anything, but I only won because they didn't do what they should've.
---
I play on console and the turning seems fine for me. Only thing that's ass is the flick
---
You act like 12-16 players is small in a game of over tens of thousands of players
---
The main offender in my eyes is the survivors who go out of their way to use it but still complain about tunneling especially when it ends with them being slugged for a minute
---
I’m in your debt
---
Yes even though it doesnt say it in spine chill's description
---
No not really in my opinion...if so yui and Jane's are the most sexual ones
---
Technically his uncle isn't his parent. Smooth brain boi
---
It was posted at 2 am didn’t expect it to blow up but I’m happy with how it did downvote idc
---
If thats true, there is a bug, because I can't. Or do I have to attack the pallet with a basic attack? That would be really counter intuitive.
---
That's similar to requiring two keys and ensuring survivors always get one in the first box. The difference is merely psychological.
---
I've also added a suggestion for downgrading the rarity of RS2 to common.
---
and with ruin it's super hard to hit.
---
Especially in new swf, if the killer goes straight for  someone every time then it seems sketchy as shit. Even now I have games where I call bbq and there isn’t any.
---
Of course he is strong, look how swole he is
---
Yeah, you have to actually smack it.
---
I hate leather face. He encourages camping. I'm at the point I just stopped unhooking or leave when I see him
---
Unless he m2s you on your death hook.
---
Just make 1 door and 1 gen tonpower that door, boom balance
---
Love these perks, all useful and pretty strong. “Not Today” would be super overpowered I think, especially with a coordinated team running it, but still nice
---
I don't think you should just hold 1 button down because it makes the game less intense but they should make it less annoying.
---
She could have just blocked the exit gate lever
---
Bitch wtf do you mean nurse spirit and Billy are top 3
---
The killer wasn’t using stridor this happened to me more than one game and iron was fine before these new updates
---
A friend told me "They can't open the gates if YOU dc" when I had a bad killer match today and now I see this post
---
thanks for making me laugh again
---
I know you did add that, I just said I’d rather it be base
---
How the fuck are you a surv main with 1000 hours on killer? How much is your total time?
---
I believe this was a *QUESTION* and perhaps not a *STATEMENT*?
---
We really need to keep in mind that some of the redditors are new players and shouldn't be down voted into oblivion for asking a question. Though I will say the "lol" made the question sound snarky...
---
Tossic
---
Yeah, killers with more experience can predict survivor locations to a T.
---
I remember when I was a noob from my perspective it looked like it was impossible to win.
---
Nice.  I didn't see anyone say it was out in the hotfix thread or on BHVR's Twitter so I assumed we were still waiting.  Just fired up my Xbox and started the game and I see it's 3.4.1 so that's nice.
---
Really need dedicated servers now though.  I imagine that would get rid of the host unreachable errors and maybe alleviate queue times a little bit.  Either way I imagine they'll be a better experience than the kinda "standard" 170-180ms ping my friends and I get on DBD most of the time now.
---
Billy is better than Oni, oof
---
I thought he was really strong seeing him play on YouTube where he could down people in one hit. 
---
But then when I play with him, it’s not making them go down in one hit when I use the demon strike. Do I have to charge it up? But then I didn’t see you tubers charge it up. What am I doing wrong? Charging it up is insanely hard to land
---
“ Oh hi, how are ya”
---
Little off on the legion. They’re from valleyview Alberta which is a province to the southeast lol.
---
he can
---
I'm getting horrible input and frame lag (nurse teleporting feels like) while playing on PC today.
---
The nurse really potatoed
---
Redesign for Feng Min\`s Phoenis Rise Polo too
---
How many sticks did I wear out. Controllers are not cheap!!
---
Interesting. I personally haven't ran into any issues with Iron Will, and I always run it as survivor.
---
Do you think it might be a NAT port issue?
---
No pc hopefully they fix the issue
---
Thats good to hear. People who abuse GFs crouch for toxicity makes me sad :(
---
I did watch the video, clearly you didn't he got pretty upset. Seems youre doing the same :')
---
Well yes, but actually no!
---
Nah, Hydras drop to Honed Edge Izanagi’s Burden in 1 shot.
---
Thank god for PC's and macros
---
Is this loss?
---
On my shitty opinion, he is B-Tier, would be S Tier if his power doesn't stop when he pick someone
---
i dont see a problem w new killer
---
Not if you watch the Evil Dead movies...
---
I have actually been writing a Mori song to the tune of that's amore for some time. I will post a few verses if anyone is interested.
---
The reason why i said lol was because i find it kinda stupid to do that but i mainly wanted to know why do this, some people did reply with good anwser in my opinion tho and im not a new player i just see killer wasting more tike than anything else by swinging while blinded since except giving more time to reach another loop its just a bet that survivor will do a stupid juke
---
LOL NOED NICE CRUTCH PERK YOU’RE TRASH WITHOUT IT.
---
Because I barely play killer compared to survivor. I have nearly 30,000 hours in the game in total so 1,000 for killer isn’t a lot compared to 29,000 as survivor.
---
I’ve actually heard from medical experts online that realistic groans of immense pain do indeed sound pretty erotic.
---
The double blades add-on and the wake up bug are not at all comparable. One made the game a little faster and one completely stopped the game and held the players hostage.
---
I forgot to mention, I played a game of killer this morning and there was a meg in my match that had iron will and after she was unhooked I could hear her crying and I wasn’t using stridor. I don’t know if it matters or not but I do play on console
---
one is cheating, one is being disrespectful.
---
Because using meta perks means you’re bad
---
Huntresses lullaby deserves to not be revealed the second you touch a genny, maybe make it where it reveals the debuff after you fail a skillcheck.
---
As a survivor main... yeah, id say he is actually fairly balanced. He is pretty easy to loop, and i have been able to survive against him almost as much as not
---
self care, no mither, diversion, this is not happening
---
Bhvr: working as intended. Wait! Did you guys want another Legion nerf? Right on!
---
Uh. Thrill and Distressing only gives you bonus towards reaching the max 8k in the respective category (can't remember which ones it is at the top of my head). Only bbq and WGLF can give you more bp than 32k per game
---
You get transported to the Entity's realm and the first thing you hear is "G'day mate , welcome to my realm ya ain't gonna have fun anytime soon cunt"
---
BBQ, Thrill, Distressing is my go to when I wanna farm points.
---
Wake up is your favorite perk..?
---
I would argue Hag is better then Billy, but that’s just my personal opinion
---
I agree, the killer is way to easily loopable which makes his power useless if you get looped
---
*Great Slave Lake* 
---
ok Canada
---
No the saddest thing is having it at 99 then a speedy meg comes in, fails a skill check, then the killer comes
---
I’ve been stuck on this one for so long tooooooo
---
This I actually interesting
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e73tbm/bugglitch_got_stuck_after_kicking_a_gen_playing/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
The mandatory "well the other side ____" comment on a post about one side
---
Instead of pointlessly asking reddit, maybe go to your killer menu and observe him at the bottom with your own 2 eyes.
---
Just in case the “New Content” window that pops up when you boot up the game after updating wasn’t enough.
---
Ehhh Hags close by the amount of pressure and how fast billy has the ability to end chases puts him above her. People were arguing with me saying hag is bad and I got confused
---
I was able to play a few games last night on Xbox but most of the time and after every successful match it wouldn’t work. I’m pretty sure it’s a problem with the dbd servers as other games worked fine for me.
---
Man, you could have edited the Oni's sound effects over the video instead of stealing a twitter video.
---
I bet the one saying hes too strong has like 4 hours in DbD lol
---
Yet both fall under the category of toxicity, which is mostly blanketed as “being an asshole for little to no reason.”
---
If only there was some sort of For Fun / For Ranked system that existed in every other modern video  online game, including nintendo games. Oh well, can't blame BHVR for having no model to go off of amirite?
---
That perk is nice and all but using 2 perks just to make the game winnable for killer is kind of bs, I feel like they should rework the entire thing.
---
Here's my 2 cents: A beginning, middle and end. During the beginning survivors should set up something, like pallets or something else, while the killer tries to stop them, or set up something of their own.
---
Middle: survivors need to activate gates and distract the killer. Chances of escaping are higher the more gates you open.
---
End: similar to the EGC.
---
What do you guys think?
---
Haha, asking a survivor not to run at least two meta perks?
---
You’re a funny man.
---
Oh god plague release was ridiculous, literally every game and it's not even a strong map for her.
---
Dead By Daylight for DS
---
again what does sweaty mean
---
Alirighty, I won’t be home again for another 9 hours but I’ll send you the file when I get home
---
Well hag can do both as well but billy is just a bit better
---
Nice stolen joke
---
hag is very good but she still doesn’t nearly have the map presence billy has, plus he’s got the instadown. also, hag needs ruin. billy doesn’t need ruin
---
Lol same here.
---
I havnt played against him but are his footstwps as loud as they are when you play as him ? Because they sound ultra loud
---
Literally everybody disagrees and there is plenty of video evidence against that but ok
---
Honestly never understood giving the hatch. Why would anyone deserve a handout in this game?
---
I'm sorry but I don't get why people are being so negative about this, I'm a 20F who simply complimented a cosmetic skin of a character that I enjoy playing. It was meant to be received in a wholesome manner and definitely not any kind of creepy way. 
---
I simply like cute stuff and decided to combine the minecraft dancing parrot meme song along with the killer I found had a more cute look. Mostly because of the pink hair that went along with the filter that I used.
---
A tip for your controller is to rotate it in a circle, you get the same speed but it does less damage to your controllers
---
Eh, my computer loads really slowly when I boot it up, not to mention the load time of Adobe Premiere 
---
Besides, I've done shit like you have suggested before and it's only got 3 or 4 likes on Twitter. Hope you can understand the situation
---
I got this one as well. XD
---
Its always fun when you start revealing him and hes stalking you, he ducks behind a window breaking the reveal, then pops back out and stalks you to 100%.
---
How is that balanced?
---
Hes possibly the least fun killer in the game to play against
---
nurse, spirit, and billy are better than him, and possibly freddy too
---
Something more complicated then the standard Gen rush would be very nice.
---
I feel like the same could be said for us killers I feel imagine asking us to go without BBQ or hex ruin makes it a whole lot harder for no good reason lol.
---
At this point meta perks on both sides are annoying but at the very least comfortable and understood as of now. I'm actually someone who likes to run non-meta meme builds and it kinda ruins the fun that I have to fight tooth and nail just for an ATTEMPT to try to put meme builds into action.
---
My only issue with the Oni is that he just needs to hit you once and you simply can *not* shake him off because of the blood bubbles.
---
Essentially, the only way to lose him is if he voluntarily stops the chase or if he finds someone else mid-chase and is tired of running after you.
---
The blood bubbles appear too frequently and are too visible for you to sneak your way out of a chase.
---
Elaborate please, what is "right hands"?
---
Long wait times for me and a few others I know across the USA who have had 20-25 min wait times to play survivor on PS4, either solo or SWF.
---
Lmao I remember when I was rank 20 and I was scared of bbq
---
thats exactly who I’d expect to make accusations. I played a couple of survivor games before playing killer and I thought the killer was cheating when they went for me after I failed healing skill checks. Because I didnt know the killer sees missed skill checks.
---
Only Waifu! It’s you! And we talked about this. &lt;3
---
He can you just have to do a charged hit on the pallet.
---
I was a big BL user, and I only really used it for the stagger reduction. The speed boost was nice in some situations, but I could have done without it. I'd say the perk had to be nerfed because of the stagger reduction, because I was definitely taking advantage of loops where the killer would have to waste a good amount of time just to get a hit on me. If they left the stagger reduction in, it would have to be reduced considerably.
---
Impressive, I don't think I would have survived that.
---
I once got accused of cheating because I apparently picked a guy up at the exact moment his DS ran out, lmao
---
What rank are you? From my experiences, the low tiers are a pain to get a game. I’m a 14 and it still is a pain 😂
---
It is me! When did we talk about this again? I'm sorry if I can't recall :c
---
The difference is, there’s one killer. There are four survivors.
---
tfw theres no amazonian vommy mommy to step on your cock  😭😭😭
---
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UChA201AjnUnvTOx51yHwjcg
---
Sweaty means try harding, not playing for fun but just hard core survivor pummeling.
---
Technically how every killer should play, but survivors act like they need to be mollycoddled and deserve the privilege of escaping rather then working for it.
---
i have tendonitis (i think thats how its spelled), and after a few matches, having to press constantly space bar starts to hurt, so... i get you
---
A light shines down on ace and takes him to heaven after that play
---
One of your streams. I’m a feng main but I’ve been leveling Yui all day. Don’t tell.
---
Oh my bad I thought he was 110 in demon mode
---
I dont really know what that perk has to do with camping gates in a 1v1, but I like the perk idea. Kinda a reverse NOED in a way, except it's not free and requires you to hook people.
---
I honestly don't have a problem with him on Xbox. I much rather go against him than Spirit still, didnt she just get needed jeez they need to pull a Legion on her
---
Hm you seem to have the attention span of a primate, I said while he’s placing snares not losing bloodlust in general.
---
You added another zero to those numbers or just like to hugely exaggerate. 30k hours in the game means you were online for literally every hour since the launch of the game.
---
Foda q o Ace é meu main kk
---
i think devs said macros are bannable
---
&gt;Because I barely play killer compared to survivor. I have nearly 30,000 hours in the game in total so 1,000 for killer isn’t a lot compared to 29,000 as survivor.
---
What? I dont think theres even a streamer that has that much time in the game and its their job to play the game.
---
lol, survivors trying to abuse HF and failing, I love it
---
Yup, i can always hear him from across the map
---
Your secret is safe with me c:
---
That's the thing he needs map pressure. So he would have to be winning to make it easier to win. Billy doesn't care if he's winning or not
---
I don't.
---
Think about it like this:
---
Wiggle has a skill cap, a short one, but it's there.
---
Struggle requires you to pay attention, and can wear you out.
---
Take those away, and you just dumb down the game, which I think is the opposite of where BHVR wants to go with the game, considering the Doctor leaks and the oni.
---
Pretty sure it's a bug. I hit a survivor with demon strike and it only injured them. Seen it a couple times in my survivor matches too
---
What he said.
---
thats what people like to say about survivors using DS/Adrenaline/DH/BT.
---
The game has been out for less than 1300 days. Which is slightly more than 31000 hours. You're saying you have been playing this game for more than 20 hours a day ever since it came out?
---
and what about people with tendonitis? its not only because of the controllers/keyboard, its also because of the cramps and, as i mentioned, because some people can't just simply mash a button for 1 min straight withouth it hurting them
---
I used trapper with an ebony, bloody coil, the dying state add on I forgot the name too, noed, ruin, and we were on the game. 
---
It was a very good match... For me anyways
---
I hate the fact that if you're the last survivor left in the game and you get hooked for the first time with deliverance active you still get sacrificed right away. Feels a bit broken.
---
Also make all maps 10X10 meters in size
---
They are in the hands of a man with blind optimism
---
I agree 100%
---
oh you go against about 5% of the total population everytime you play killer? Interesting.
---
With how often BHVR fcks up the sounds with each update, im gonna just say nah.
---
How are they bugged?
---
Decent killer gets added survivors....REEEEEE
---
i had something similar happen, and i play on PC
---
My all time favorite build, love doing it in Hawkins too.
---
Forgetting about Steve and yui a little bit
---
Even better, be blinded and do a 360 chainsaw into a Quentin in a corner!
---
Yes its happening to me aswell. 8 times in a row on xbox.
---
Reasonably yes, it's similar to a survivor who memorizes the nooks and crannies that totems spawn in on the Badham maps (or any other map, of course); killers can see the location of generators and start to get a few for which things a survivor hides behind if they're in the area, even without any other cues.
---
The game has been out for 1270 days which allows for a total possible amount of play time of 30480 hours if he played every minute of every day. Assuming someone has played 30000 hours in that time, that leaves them with a total of 480 hours not playing. If you spread that evenly over all 1270 days (assuming they didn’t use matchmaking wait time to get stuff done) they would have a total of approximately 23 minutes everyday to sleep, eat, bathe etc.
---
You have to charge it but just a fraction. Same with breaking pallets. It won’t work with just a tap but the smallest hold makes it an instant break.  Unless you are dashing then a tap seems fine.
---
You on console? This happens to me somewhat frequently but I’ll get a game eventually
---
Two kills and a DC...you should safety pip at least...
---
Uhhhh what
---
It's a fun one!
---
If you are having such a big problem just use iron will 4head
---
Pls no
---
Dear devs, there are too many survivors please eliminate three. I am not a crackpot
---
Oh, so you want Billy nerfed too then?
---
I don't about where you live, but over here sleeping is punished by exile... From the planet.
---
So you left the game on since it was released? That's not exactly the same as playing it...
---
I have a little over 70% of achievements and after I get aces teachables I’m just gonna be levelling up everyone to 10
---
What if the community complains that it's too hard again?
---
Will they just let the hatch spawn at 5 gens for these poor souls to "ease" it for them?): Seems fair for Solos if you ask me!
---
Maybe they have a dedicated machine for bitcoin mining and just decided to leave Dead by Daylight up for 30,000 hours?
---
See that’s fine. But that wasn’t part of the argument. He was just bitching because it damages hardware.
---
All I saw was a broken hitbox.
---
A guy who is very skilled at killer
---
The Oni is definitely powerful but I find it more fun to play against him personally.
---
Takes me about 7 minutes just to find a survivor match. It's 3pm here, east coast, ps4.
---
Claudette is from Canada
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Just wait 60 seconds until its gone :D
---
I don’t disagree with you and I typically play killer but I’m not a fan of the flick. I don’t really fee like he should be able to turn on a dime and insta down someone because there’s not much counter to it.
---
puise no mista chuapper
---
You'll get the hatch when you complete at least one generator, you MEG HEAD! 👻
---
The meme changed it do
---
&gt;doing gens, you?
---
I play red rank pc, oni is just hillbilly
---
Tome? 
---
I see what happened to you and iOS changed it to time and I had to correct it and soon...
---
I used this exact build for this exact challenge, it worked.
---
well then that shows that you are QUITE the killer
---
What is a stadia?
---
It absolutely is sarcasm lmao. I hate her as a survivor main so I know why people hate her. But damn is she fun to play.
---
sure, going with the game mechanics
---
God Stadia is a mess. I knew it would be a flop. Google has like a graveyard of cancelled or shit projects and products.
---
HOPE GANG RISE
---
UWU wuts this *finds ruin*
---
Hm you seem to be unable to read. I was just stating a fact moron.
---
Looking cute Mr. Legion.
---
Eh, it's your opinion, but i can see where you're coming from, i just like to know where they are
---
You can both be hit while hitting the killer. Simply throwing the pallet does not stop a hit; only when it's down. So they're swinging just before you throw it, killer connects, then pallet connects
---
thanks :)
---
It's not a massive problem I'm just wandering others thoughts
---
Yeah I just cranked it up to max and it does not help at all lmao.
---
Pretty sure self promo isn't allowed on the subreddit.
---
Sometime in early 2020 I'd assume. We Sony knows the exact date yet.
---
I looked at the rules before posting
---
They blocked the word Analog on the ingame chat system back during socom 3 days
---
Boil Over actually makes the killer BETTER, the sways left to right are super predictable so if the killer swivels their camera with each sway, they move to the hook faster than if they were traveling in a straight line.
---
Also due to this, once they move towards the hook, they just have to hit spacebar on the sway back.
---
Never run Boil Over, you're basically sealing your own fate.
---
google game streaming thing
---
you can SPEND MORE MONEY to get GAMES THAT FEEL LAGGY TO PLAY
---
The original intent for the game was 1v1v1v1v1 or 4v1 
---
Meaning, you can say "fuck my teammates" as a survivor and only care about escaping for yourself. 
---
 Or if you feel like it, team up as a whole and try to escape.
---
That's just what the game was originally intended for, so it's kind of a 1v1 game but we all know it actually isn't!
---
uwu
---
His rage mode can get looped pretty hard because of his lack of being able to turn while moving. If you’re getting matched with killers way above your skill level that’ll be a problem regardless, its just way less forgiving with Oni due to the instadown and map pressure he can put while checking gens in that form, sort of like billy. 
---
Are you doing SWF? SWF matches based on the highest rank friend, which would explain why you’re getting killer above your level.
---
You're not allowed to self promo on here. Grind on YouTube. Don't self promote on other platforms.
---
Why would I spend money on that?
---
&gt;Nope, still doesn't replace the 45 seconds you have to divert other survivors from saving them and is so much easier  
---
&gt;then says  
---
&gt;I never said you were going to camp the hook
---
Yup neither of these things contradict each other
---
&gt;So which is it?
---
Both
---
&gt;Objectively wrong. The only time you have a chance to blind someone is while they're breaking a pallet. You have 0% chance to flashlight save against a killer who knows how to play around it and is expecting them.
---
Objectively wrong. All killers can be blinded and is not a 0% chance. See how being pedantic is really stupid to do in conversation? Lmao
---
&gt;lol. It's cute that you're trying to sound smart
---
Only you would think I'm trying to sound smart. The rest of us call it normal.
---
Fuck off with your essays.
---
Blood warden is my fav perk because I went from a 1k to a 3k more times than I can count
---
The power of my stand king crimson
---
TLDR
---
Ok.
---
This is the best thing I have ever seen
---
ok
---
Exactly, generally worse case it never activated because you’re rolling the killer and best case scenario it literally wins you the match when you would’ve usually lost
---
hot
---
Or the survivor could just be lagging, I've been hit through windows due to dedicated servers when well past them, but nothing as bad as most of this.
---
Unsure about that one, sorry
---
I’ve seen to many thick trapper claps.
---
You really should check out the forums some time, it's a killer sausage fest.  But Oni definitely is a late-game killer but once her gets there he is really strong.  Honestly I don't think he needs a nerf besides maybe having the wind up for his insta-down attack take a little longer, as it is now it barely takes longer than a normal attack.
---
Yeah bruh, I know what you mean. I took a look at her cosmetics, cracked open Yui's bloodweb, dropped a few points into her...
---
Then I went back to my bae and got her all the new teachables. Feng is love, Feng is life 💜
---
Id smash
---
Awarded for being good in a chase. Great killer design.
---
It’s a lot of fun
---
Okay also fair but still. ;(
---
So does fast vaulting, fast lockering, fast closing chest (closing without pullimg down the chest lid), failing any skill check (sabotage, Pig Helmet removal, self heal)
---
I know rankings broken yet im too scared to play solo because im at rank 8
---
Gatekeeping what?  I didn't say you can't upvote the post.  I said this comment.
---
Onky the archives of no one escaping, and having no doors open using unnerving presence.
---
You can use as much as 4
---
Ok, I’ll bite. How are they playing like trash? As in you’re escaping easily?
---
Hag is African
---
True. I noticed she has a smaller terror radius but I thought it was just to give the survivors a better chance to hear the phasing sound
---
you can
---
Well its not that bad
---
Actually I dissagree, his 2 rage ability’s allowed a sprint that last a while with the slam down then the regular one hit slam but compare that to the hillbilly who already has his M2 constantly and the oni is thrift store hillbilly, the only difference is the oni don’t have a bump into objects penalty
---
even if it was balanced or not it's still really well made so it shouldn't deserve a negative rsting
---
Only if there’s 2 people w 2 brand new parts.
---
*Fails skill-check:
---
Survivors get off the gen and point for you to leave
---
Claudette head-bobs you to remind you what a failure you are*
---
No as in the majority i find facecamps
---
I'm pretty sure matchmaking restrictions don't apply to ranks 16 to 20, someone else posted about it awhile back, so that new players can always find a match.
---
how else can you explain them being 5 feet apart?
---
And tunnels hard for the kills...
---
DOZENS!!!
---
Just a friendly reminder that Kindred is a solid perk for solo survivors.
---
From my understanding, Oni is actually a super high skill cap character. And to use him best right now you have to setup certain keybinds so that you can spin when doing your attack. A lot of people are quick to rage about something sucking ass, especially if it takes a lot of time and effort to get good at.
---
Nice outfits!
---
Don’t tunnel the guy off the hook then!
---
Bug
---
I was more referring to a situation where the gates are open and you get that perfect straight to the exit.
---
I like it!
---
*Never*
---
It looks like its the survivors internet lagging.
---
I would disagree on the issue of turning, the Oni killers i've faced seemed to not have an issue flicking and turning on a dime, I've even fucked with it in a few custom games and I've had no trouble turning around obstacles, I would say he needs a hard impediment in that regard just from my first impressions. 
---
I've been doing SWF with 3 friends, an 8, a 16, an 18 and myself an 18. We've been getting matched with killers between 8-6 with the 8 in my party, and 9s and 8s without the 8 in my party. Its been a pain going against BBQ, noed and ruin almost every game as a new player, but I suppose a baptism of fire is the quickest way to learn so I don't mind!
---
Wait, Feral loses PWYF stacks on hit?
---
BHVR, come the hell on. Either it works across the board or it doesn’t work at all.
---
the duality of man
---
The B-word
---
*oh, they heard.*
---
All the Ghostface killers on PS4 are the worst scumbags in the whole game. I think I have had a handful 4-5 that played the game normal and were fun and the rest have just been the most toxic dipshit assholes I have ever seen in the game...
---
The PS4 players ruined that killer for me and I was hyped when he came out, then everyone abused his powers and ruined him for me...
---
I'll never understand why fellow Survivors dick around like that and give the chance for making a mistake.
---
Feng's better
---
*Plays as new Killer for 10 minutes/Plays one match against new Killer*
---
GARBAGE/OP KILLER!
---
I like the idea but sadly I can't help but think more people would complain and call it unfair because of the random element.
---
She dc'd, didnt she
---
The amount of bad teammates I have who don't know how to deal with his dash is giving me a headache. These same players don't know how to handle a good billy too so it makes sense.
---
I got accused of cheating because I went straight to the basement and found the kate hiding in a locker with 3 birds on it.
---
Some people barely have time to play, so they mori/camp to make the challenges easier.
---
Otz, is that you?
---
I don’t understand I finally got to red ranks and all the survivors I get matched with are idiots.
---
They won’t go save u unless it’s in front of killer, they won’t do gens while you’re running, most will hide in the locker because they don’t what bbq to find them when u finally die. Most will just spend the game hiding and try to do “clutch plays” 
---
All getting to red ranks has done for me is match me shitty survivors and a lot better killers
---
Shit looks better lol
---
I was envisioning it as a sort of 'final blow' perk. It only activates when you're dead on hook and down. Maybe the effect could've been a bit more powerful.
---
The vault grab animation does look alot better in my opinion.
---
&gt; Shut the hell up killer. You don't get to fucking talk about balance
---
**lmfao**
---
do you hear yourself right now
---
Honestly after playing a lot of matches as/against Oni, I think he’s really balanced! He has a lot of potential to be overpowered but it depends on the skill level of the person playing him, just like any killer - I don’t get all these people complaining about him being OP or weak.
---
Yeah I have seen a suspicious surplus of huntresses since the dedicated servers started.
---
Must be a coincidence.
---
Yeah, also make old prayer beads base kit
---
&gt; If it's so good then why doesn't anyone use it?
---
you live in a fever dream
---
They suck at playing killer
---
Yep this game literally damages keyboards and controllers worldwide because they want artificial difficulty. They want you to feel like you’re doing something since the gameplay is so simple.
---
Not if the next killer is a bloodpoints thief
---
So wait...
---
Switch killer mains have had to play without BBQ this whole time?!?
---
Nah, she begged for mercy in the end, but I still killed her anyway.
---
The grab is long but cool
---
I for one approve of this petulance. Embrace it. Even *more* strongly.
---
Yes of course you can :) just remember to credit
---
&gt; gen rush
---
GeN rUsHiNg IsNt ReAl
---
Ah yes, a D&amp;D rogue killer. How interesting. Stabs you in the back and steals your wallet.
---
They talked about them in a live chat not too long ago. Showed models of the skin and said they’d be coming in the future.
---
IDK, Oni seems insanely strong.  More or less a billy who has an eternal road map of floating red blobs that just shout 'SURVIVOR THIS WAY PLEASE SMASH'.
---
Basically, targeting and hooking specific survivor to down them.
---
The ethics of it varying wildly on the scenario. I.E. Killer is chasing someone at full health but someone who is injured that was just hooked passes by. IMO, it's acceptable to switch for the easy hook. Competitively, it rarely makes sense not to switch targets on certain scenarios.
---
They either carry the team or handicap it
---
Sometimes they can be right, but the main problem when it comes to such opinion is if the person itself can't tell if they are bad, need more practice or if the char itself is bad/good. And if you ask me, that is a fucking pain.
---
I’m not sure why you’re getting downvoted, why did this guy get instadowned? Was the killer Billy and that was a chainsaw hit even though they’re stuck in the Gen? Was it Oni who used his power silently when someone came up to the Gen? 
---
I figured even if the killer was stuck, they’d still need to either grab them or hit twice without an exposed effect.
---
Just a guy with a sword chasing down a monkey
---
To be fair though people probably don't expect killer instinct to reveal people in lockers when it blocks EVERY other reveal in the game
---
Correct. He's very overlooked, and that's because he is indeed abysmal on PC but he's much better on every other platform
---
Idk, the hatch is meant to be incentive to not give up on your team if it seems hopeless because even if the rest die, you still have a chance at winning
---
Level 1 is trash, level 3 is godtier
---
Not cancer doctor!!!
---
I'd be surprised if they don't come til 2020 honestly
---
Oh I see only when you’re down. The aura thing tho would either be useless if you’re hooked, or op if you escape. It kind of guarantees dying though so maybe something like rancor ?
---
It having happened before Doesn’t make the complaint any less valid
---
Do you use a macro for hook struggle? I've had this a few times, and the only way that happens is I forget to toggle my macro off, so it's still spamming space. So when I get downed and picked up again, the sound goes off but the check never shows up, because the macro makes it miss.
---
They’re definitely not coming till 2020. It’s just a matter of whether it will be early or late 2020
---
That’s strange because no0b3 doesn’t play every hour of the day and like a year ago he released a video where it said that he had more than 20,000 hours on the game. Now 365 x 24 = 8,760 I don’t have completely 30 hours but pretty damn close. I rounded obviously
---
On PC, very good idea is to make a macro one for pressing a d in very short time delays and second for slowly mashing space
---
At this point they should just do MM by Devotion level and dump the ranking system entirely.
---
Sad face );
---
Aaaand I've gained a pip on the same ....sooooo, chase more?
---
And not every SWF is well performing. A lot of goofy squads out there.
---
"We hear you and understand your problem. Legion can no longer break pallets that you're picking up."
---
&gt;Ruin is a must.
---
No it's not.
---
i know what u thinkin, just dont cleanse
---
Wait, since when does he semi flip his knife at the end?
---
That said, I would like for generators to have a minigame gimmick. It would raise the tension a lot.
---
It's ambiguous but very possible that they do with The Oni having come from the same universe as The Spirit. I'm also sure that one of the unseen lore characters came from the same universe as The Trapper since there's some reference to the Macmillan Estate having existed in said lore character's universe. I do like to think many of the original Killers were pulled from the same universe.
---
that's the question everyone's asking
---
Each new tome releases in between new chapters. The next one should release around January - February
---
Oh ok thanks
---
As a survivor, if I see another survivor burn Lerys or The Game,  I'm letting you die on hook. The two worst maps in the game.
---
It keeps progress and unlocks the rewards to match.
---
This playstyle tends to fuck over solo survivors for sure. It's not banable to play like that, but it won't win you any style points either.  
---
You say you know exactly what survivors are going to do when you hook one, they will try and save.  Well that's the no skill part Mr Big Brain ghostface, of course they will try and save and if they aren't on coms, they also can't warn their teammates from coming to get them off the hook.  So you end up punishing altruistic survivors for attempting to play the game and save their teammates.  It will probably work in lower ranks maybe even into green and purple,  as long as you don't get swfs.  It just isn't much fun to play against because there isn't any skill involved.  
---
I also won't tell anyone how to play their game, but it sounds boring as hell to play like that.  
---
&gt;one of the players messaged me and accused me of camping lol
---
Well what do you expect, you admit that's your playstyle. 
---
&gt;Am I the toxic one here? Or were they just sore losers?
---
Camping the hook when survivors come to save isn't toxic, it's just boring af.  If that's what you are going for then by all means, you do you.  Expect more of the same when it comes to the messages you get.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e74qn7/random_player_why_do_you_play_dbd_me_its_a_bugs/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That’s like saying Myers doesn’t have a power because he doesn’t always have it. You just don’t know how to use it
---
You immediately unlock everything from the previous tiers.
---
When I first started I had no idea what scratch marks were and why they appeared lol
---
The only times I've disconnected are when I got stuck in pallets or now when I get stuck in gens
---
I had a guy last night who played well popping gens despite his 3 teammates being worthless. I caught him at the door exit and picked him up, but decided to let him go free. He wiggled out and started healing himself for points. He was maybe 2 inches from leaving when the time ran out and the Entity nommed him. Absolutely tragic
---
Winning was pretty fun :)
---
*sits here playing ghost face as a normal fucking killer seeing all the hate toward my camera boy*
---
It’s unfortunate, but he needed it because bhvr added nemesis :/ proxie legion was back and they needed to fix that. Idk why nemesis is a thing, it fucked legion
---
I'm just glad they removed the ability to Q or E flick because the 180 turns were insane
---
I like his response, lol.
---
Your cosplay is dope, fuck these mods.
---
I rarely fail skill checks like most survivors probably, but if you taunt me after I do fail, that will just make it worse for the subsequent skill checks. Be nice to each other!
---
But does hooking someone, then hooking another person, and then finding the first person and still getting caught by DS still count as tunneling?
---
Honestly, the staggering, injured state and the vault animation were better then than now.
---
it aint their fault
---
even with dedicate servers, the game itself still prioritizes the killer's connection, as a consequence leading to these annoying and unfair hits.
---
&gt;See that’s fine. But that wasn’t part of the argument. He was just bitching because it damages hardware.
---
I said hardware and HEALTH.
---
Ormond is like a shitty Banff from the sounds of it.
---
She just slowly walks away like “I’m juuust gonna go this way”.
---
Yeah I'll happily take over performance for prettyness. As long as it's not too ugly, which the current UI isn't, so it's fine. Still like to see it happen eventually if it's possy
---
Aye, but it is understandable. It was a rank 18 Oni, he wasn't that good. But he tried his best.
---
Every day man it’s taking the fun outta of it
---
I've actually wiggled out a few times at this point thanks to that perk, so no it's definitely not garbage.
---
Legion really needed the nerf though. Literally had no counterplay
---
Could someone please explain "flick"?
---
Also a classic
---
I hate it I’ve bitched a lot about his to my father who plays but doesn’t agree. But why do I get a 0 or -1 if I start the game and kill all 4 people in like 1 minute. If I’m that good at being a killer shouldn’t I rank up and play better survivors why should I have to let them live so I can go kick gens and go chase them and not hit them . Put on hook then go stand in corner so they are not scared to save them. If I kill all them I take that as I did my job I should at least get +1 for a fucking 4k. I started having to play like doctor and clown and just shock and throw bottles and just not attack to get my points up so I don’t depip.
---
previous version was completely useless in swf because you could just tell your friends "i'm going to unhook"
---
Oh it sucks on Ps4 and I know you PC guys can run a macro to spam the button, had another guy tell me about modded controllers to try out to combat this, so gonna give that a whirl and see what happens. I’ve worn out 2 controllers now and talked with many other about worn out keyboards from this game. Love how we are all being downvoted...
---
I like that he has clear weaknesses, if you loop him in a jungle gym it's game over for him since he can't mindgame eith his loud ass footsteps
---
Bruh Its not like he just came out and people need to learn to play as or against
---
Controversial like lol
---
It was a lot of fun. This is that silly honor code I was talking about. It's not my fault if they keep giving me the win. I guess there's just a lot of salty people in this game, huh?
---
I mean he's not overpowered or weak,he takes practice like Billy or Nurse
---
&gt; escape an escape
---
🤔
---
I reckon no red in the eyes would be better.
---
GG and tips happened a lot on lower ranks for me. Unfortunately, they lowered drastically as I climbed the ranks, but it makes my day when I get good messages.
---
Shhhhh, don’t tell them!
---
I still main Legion, never use his power though, I just like his aesthetics
---
I run both lol
---
Damn, that sounds really cool! Maybe something to do with misdirection/confusion, making the survivors think you're places you're not, some sort of combo between Freddie's gen teleportation and the Hag's popup traps? I've always liked spit balling that sort of thing.
---
With some killers it is. Especially if the survs are coordinated enough.
---
Let killers take up to 8 add-ones per match so they can potentially bring as many as survivors
---
The hatch is incentive to GIVE up on my team. If 5 gens are up and my team has been dying left and right and not doing much besides pulling each other off in front of killer I’m not going to go save that last guy on hook I’m just going to get ready to find hatch. Some games are pointless to play and there is no chance to win but I’m not going to DC cause that’s for pussies I’ll just keep tapping gens till the hatch spawns
---
The day you don’t worry about achievements the better.
---
See, the first player only goes survivor while the second clearly is a killer main.
---
I honestly perform worse with friends because we are just laughing at stupid stuff instead of actually trying.
---
/s?
---
i understood 10% of that sentence
---
How about that pallet smash?
---
I was accused of hacking for finding surviors in the basement without TI.
---
As Doctor. With the addon that lets me see the auras.
---
Someone in my stream told me he was the slowest killer in the game, right as he popped out of nowhere and murdered me. Idk how to p
---
XD
---
Oh no yeah it's a great perk I totally agree
---
That’s as toxic as it gets
---
big brain play
---
You forgot to see how many hours does both of them have
---
Finally someone who thinks like me ! Jfjfjfj
---
Sorry, I corrected it
---
TL;DR
---
Billy and Oni are two different killers and people should quit complaining about Oni's power. I agree with him.
---
Oh this is cool how do I get it?!
---
Then what should i run for the pig,spirit and legion?
---
Bria bria
---
Wow i never knew this
---
I'm on playstation and he killed all of us each time we went against him lmao
---
Everybody gangsta till the flat moon start rotating
---
They always make it seem like they were forced to buy it. Like they had a gun to their head. Smh
---
I was really surprised by this. With Ojomo for a name I figured he was Japanese
---
You poor soul... :( ((rip trapper))
---
Just play the game and don’t focus on people’s talks. At the end of the day, the game is there so that you have fun.
---
I could care less about achievements. Prior to mine bugging out everything was dated for 2016. Having legacy with 2019 achievements was the problem/is.
---
Ehhh, I don't think so. I respect your opinion and thought process though 😁
---
Yep there are lot of toxic and salty people. Just leave the game at the end or hide the chat so you don’t see it
---
A Simpsons DLC would be so cool!
---
Nope. Dipshit BHVR is waiting until dedicated servers on all platforms. Maybe next year.
---
Yes! Me and my sister think the same thing!
---
Jesus Christ dude, on console this kills frame rate.  Some Claudette did this in the basement and it was a slide show
---
Honestly, I've noticed a trend in the ranks. Everyone above like rank 10. Complain a fair amount. Anyone in the purple ranks rages about everything and says you are a bad player. Red rank players are honestly the kindest of the bunch. Some are still toxic but it feels like there are far fewer of them. First game ever playing with NOED. Didn't know much about the game. Got called out for it. People are just going to complain because they can.
---
I do remember old legion, I'm referring more to the newest nerfs that bhvr did because the stats for legion show they're "overperforming" same as old freddy
---
This is a really good theory. It’s very thought out and it would fit into the games lore really well. Well done!
---
Haha dude, ppl need to give it some time. Killer mains are learning to use the full potential of the new killer and survivor mains need to learn how to counter them. It's a learning curve for us all. 😁
---
It really is.
---
I'm at rank 4 killer, and I am always playing 4 rank 1 survivors every match, and they are all very good. Every match. No opponents lower than rank 2.
---
Ever.
---
So I know there are a lot of rank 1 survivors.
---
I'm one of them, but the matchmaking thinks I want a rank 6 killer and 3 rank 15 teammates, because thats how it is all damn day.
---
I sort of like that blood on the window after vaulting
---
looping is terrible gameplay though, sneaking out of chase instead of looping should always be the designated method of getting away.
---
Or maybe they just like playing survivor? Idk why the community has to be so toxic to each other.
---
Remember, seeker will be able to be used on all killers. Think about that.
---
Just another legion nerf.
---
its useless against some killers
---
Thank you so much! I love stories and storytelling, and DbD is such a unique story that has always captivated me.
---
it’s a joke dude
---
i assumed most of those, but I don't know where to find that information, and I hardly play killer. so thank you very much, i appreciate it. 
---
i thought missing a heal check notified killer, but its been a long time since i've failed one AND had killer come over to me so i just stopped thinking it did. 
---
i did NOT know about the chest though. but without hands? how do you do that?
---
"Daily does"
---
Having to slug a survivor for \~60 seconds just because they fucked up is not healthy balance and is not a viable counterplay. In that time they'll just get saved and you've lost all your momentum and pressure. 
---
You're also blatantly disregarding the point. BT, especially combined with DS, allows hook diving without punishment, and because it's multiple use now this is done way more often.
---
What show?
---
Nobody names themselves True Talent and NOT have an ego.
---
Insidious is such a strange perk concept to me. It promotes camping, and helps no one except killers who can't naturally camp stealthily. Its also not OP, though, so I kind of get why it hasnt been reworked to function differently or anything.
---
Both together are a classic combo.
---
Major oof alert, oh well
---
Such repost
---
then do not try to heal close to the pallet
---
&gt;They need to add in code or something to make it so the pallet is always dropped between you and the killer
---
and you didnt talk about when healing someone or maybe actually being on the left side then going to the right side where the killer, all you said you wish all pallet throw should make it where your on the opposite side of the pallet.
---
sorry if i was rude oor misunderstood you. im not the sharpist tool in the shed
---
I get an eargasm when I hear the Oni's roar. Demogorgon is just 1 redneck away from catching a slug to the face if it was up to me.
---
Me trying not to die the first 2 minutes against a Freddy because the dream world with low resolution is like a cloud
---
Blendettes are remarkably hard to see on that map. I played against two in one match the other day and had one hooked. I went back to the hook to chase whoever unhooked *because finding anyone is nearly impossible*. It was another Blendette in an even darker cosmetic. They both slipped off the side of the hill and I went down after Blendette 2. She in into some bushes and I pursued and when I got to the other side I saw Blendette and swung. But it was the one who was hooked. She disconnected.
---
Rank 19, 2 perks.
---
I felt *so bad* but I literally followed right behind the other one! I have no idea where she went and where the other came from.
---
*Basically what I'm saying is Ruin and PGTW are irrelevant and a good killer doesnt need a generator slow down perk to win*  what rank are you?
---
It would be nice if they halted production of new chapters for 3-4 months and told everyone they are going to go thru and fix the game. I think many would be fine and understand and of course your gonna get the base who cry’s about it. But fuckem I would rather see the game get fixed than new content that just keeps breaking shit. I understand they need to make money but at the same time, if your cranking out new content that’s massively breaking your core game mechanics then you are just shooting yourself in the foot. 
---
They need to really focus on how they manage the company and definitely bring in some outside help or new help with fresh eyes. They are gonna piss everyone off and people will stop playing. I think the only reason why people are still here like me and others is it’s so addictive. 
---
But if they keep with the course they are on, it just keeps making it look like they are out for a cash grab more and more without any concern on the quality of content being released.
---
He is busy insidious basement camping the meg
---
Same here. With the Oni I can be in awe of his red fury from far away, but I know where he is. With the Demogorgon all I hear are the sounds of the upside down and then suddenly he's coming at me from the place I least expected
---
Oh ? I thought pc got it on the 5th ? Never mind then.
---
It's sole purpose is camping which is useless as your not improving your skills while camping and usually your just gonna lose if you camp
---
I want the ice skating glitch to come back after you drop a pallet! That shit was funny!
---
How many times to we have to teach them this lesson
---
I agree. I also think Oni has something that people tend to overlook; that his power leads a "trail of blood", which is essentially free information, and why I call bullshit on his "weak early game".
---
U trying to 360? XD
---
I played with a hacker yesterday, he put me on a big meathook and I couldn't move. I tried shooting at him but he must have bought the hack that makes your guns not work too. Reported.
---
It came back
---
I mock it up to bad experiences. People who played the killer think its weak. And people who play with random survivors get slugged in the first few minutes
---
I will maybe ditch Feng (for a while) if we get an Australian survivor that talks really Occa. Crikey
---
He’s not great. I enjoy him but he’s a little hard to control. Not as unbearable as Nurse and Billy on console, but he takes some mastering more than other killers. Spirit and Ghostface were super easy off the bat for me. Oni I’ve played a few games and still can’t correctly use his insta-down attacks correctly.
---
i think that was because he was leaving tier 3 not 100% sure
---
Shit belongs on instagram.
---
This looks like a budget mobile game
---
Wraith is not good. I've seen every one of his recent wraith videos and the survivors have been horrible. I MAIN wraith and I know hes bad. I just enjoy his cosmetics plus the fact that nearly any perk build works on him.
---
Wraith has two good factors:
---
Easy first hit
---
Better than average map coverage
---
That's it. He has nothing to land the second hit, nothing to slow gens, and no tracking. Using an anti heal build does not make him top 4. You could use monitor and rabbit on Micheal with anti heal and get the same results.
---
Bro, stop playing the game its unfair on me bro
---
According to Lore, is that there is no escape no matter what. If you commit suicide, you will wake up at the campfire. If you are lost, and have no hope or dedication to survive anymore, the survivor will get rid of your “shell / soulless body. Thereafter the entity will put you in a state / other realm where you “shell” will stay for eternity, kinda like Voldemort’s soul in Harry Potter. You will be stuck in limbo, which is basically the void/nothingness. Hopefully this explains it.

Colluding with the crows. Thats illegal.

You are so right. Lost its novelty the 2nd time I was hooked 3 years ago. They probably won't change it because it has such an emotional effect on new players, making things feel uncomfortable and desperate. Could probably be replaced with skill checks. Make them easy, and spread apart. Then in the last 10 seconds, make them all as hard as Overcharged generators.
---
I'll check my keybinds to see if that's the issue, I know I've messed with the keybinds a while back

But you wasted Dead hard pog?

whispers is like a drug. I can barely play without it now
---
I bought basically all of Legions wardrobe of skins the fortnight before they added his "rework" into ptb
---
Oh right, I keep forgetting these are also particle effects. Yeah I can imagine it being a total nightmare in the basement.
---
Not to mention you spill more blood orbs when you fail healing skill check.
---
Completely countering some killers and being completely useless against some killers does not make a perk balanced lol
---
I said imagine! You, imagine.
---
That does explain it. I'm not satisfied with that, though 🤣 Though the lore says that, I like to believe that there is a way out. I mean, if there's a way in, there has to be a way out, too. Well, maybe not HAS to.. But it would make sense lol
---
*Arrua!*
---
It was rather broken than good. Without moonwalking he was kinda bad.
---
Not that he is too much better now...
---
It’s not anymore because devs changed Deep Wounds to go down only if the survivor isn’t sprinting or mending. It was good before because Deep Wounds only went down outside the terror radius, and Nemesis removes the terror radius.
---
Lol apparently they haven't heard of our Lord and savior Tum Tums

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e75jes/an_interesting_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
In the UK I have very long killer queues and pretty quick survivor queues. Killer queues can hit 20+ mins
---
ok I see now I just wanted to know since I had no idea thanks tho
---
I used to defend him myself but just can't take him anymore.  It has become difficult to take him seriously these days.  You can see videos within the past 2 weeks where he claims good survivors toss pallets immediately I guess looping them optimally and wasting more time and conserving defenses for later into the game is for noobs now lol.  Playing unoptimally is the meta boys "it's observable" lol.  That and the whole Spirit was fine she needed no changes stuff.  Like come the fuck on True......
---
Also I can't take the chronic complaining and constant excuses anymore during his gameplay.  It has gotten so annoying.
---
Are we still in 2018? His movement speed is 4.6 m/s the same as Trapper's.
---
How could I forget? 😭
---
I have never played an multiplayer game with game breaking issues like this. Maybe broken weapons or broken abused mechanics, but nothing like this.
---
I never understand how, when it's so easy to get trapped in a windowless room, cant find a safe pallet, and cant find a gen for the life of me.
---
Freddy imo is still better than Billy and I don't think Oni is better than Billy personally, comparable maybe.
---
Its not going to. A recent change to legion (nerf) meant it wont be busted on him. 
---
Nemesis: A Survivor who blinds or stuns you using a Pallet  or a Locker  becomes your Obsession .
---
Anytime a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they are affected by the Oblivious Status Effect for 40/50/60 seconds and their Aura  is revealed to you for 4 seconds
---
So it would mean that due to obvious the timer would run down even if you were in a chase with them as you have obvious, so you wouldn't be able to stop and meant because legions chasing you and while they are chasing you the meter goes down. Which means your down is inevitable providing the legion commits to you. 
---
But a recent change to legion means that while you are affected by there mend timer if you are running it doesnt go down. Meaning they stopped nemisis being a problem before it was and inadvertently nerfed legion again
---
Are you trying to pretend most killers don’t run meta perks either?
---
If that's the case then I guess Oni is top tier. Ranks also don't mean anything nowadays, that's not directed towards you in a offensive way, but there's dogshit players in purple/red ranks
---
That's dangerous against Mayers 😂
---
He moved to Japan to teach, he was not from there originally.
---
If anyone else can relate, when loading on Xbox usually you could see the ranks of other people but now you can’t at all. Kinda annoying when my rank is changing like mad
---
Agreed. Holding your broken leg or even your shoulder when injured makes more sense than holding your tum tum.
---
Also Tapp should be holding his neck when injured.
---
Lerys is window city plus it's extremely easy to hide. Like smart survivors can waste a lot of time on Lerys by just using Windows. The game on the other hand has like 18 safe pallets which is also cancer.
---
I didn't really think of using infectious fright on hillbilly but now that I think about it.. it actually would be good on him.
---
Iron Grasp isn’t really necessary, it’s a really outdated perk since you should never be that far away from a hook. It’s only really useful for basement builds. I’d recommend switching it out for Sloppy Butcher. Other than that it’s a pretty decent build.
---
What does crouching when going to unhook do? And I thought you couldn’t get rid of her traps (I’m fairly new to the game, sorry :/)
---
5 totems will spawn in every game.
---
5.
---
This but unironically. It has a use but it is so niche in its intended function but as a consequence gives survivors invincibility for a whole minute. Oh, did I just see someone get unhooked right in my face? Guess I have to slug the-and they went in a locker. Unless you're trapper, you have to take the L and leave because all you stand to gain by getting the dumbfuck that got unhooked is a 5-second stun and losing 2 survivors.
---
I've been on the NSFW DBD sub too long, that ending looked like it was about to be something else.
---
Hence why I don't run ruin and play killers that are good without Ruin.
---
They had a fair point as to why bunny feng hasn't came yet though.
---
They mentioned making the hood has been challenging because they don't know how'd they would separate the head and the torso.
---
But... we did get Ash since then so we know it ain't a lie it can't be done. He got a slot for his hand and with his head and body as another slot together.
---
Also ive noticed full piece outfits are accessible (you click the full outfit and it automatically equips the outfit in all 3 slots) when you pick your cosmetics in the menu which means it could also mean if they can't figure it out they should be smart and just lock it to a whole head and torso piece or an entire one piece cosmetic locked to itself
---
We can’t have two thicc queens in DBD. My computer can only handle one.
---
So by this logic, 4 of them could be hexes and the remaining 1 is dull, correct?
---
But when I'm gonna eat my sandwich? Totems are hard to find you know with Nancy chewing them for a breakfast
---
Survivor viewpoint, then killed viewpoint lmao
---
I have this exact issue except it only happens when I solo queue as survivor for whatever reason.
---
Very efficient killer
---
I mean at the end of the day DbD is a game for fun. I get that some people like playing really sweaty because they like being competitive, but fun can be had outside of the gameplay loop of running the same perks as survivor/killer and genrushing/raging on Reddit. It can be cute to give a baby Dwight the occasional hatch, or indulge a baby Wraith by stopping generators.
---
And that is why I 99 my stalk at Myers when the game is almost over.
---
That could have worked...if they didn't make it possible for survivors to be on a coordinated team.
---
It doesn't work with Legion anymore because devs changed how Deep Wounds worked, but previously if you applied Feral Frenzy on a survivor as they triggered Nemesis, you could just follow them and they would go down because the timer was connected to the terror radius and Nemesis causes you to lose your terror radius for that survivor.
---
But now simply running prevents it from going down so it doesn't work
---
Dunning Krueger effect...
---
&gt;It's pretty obvious by now that killer players are getting shafted and survivors take priority when it comes to any sort of changes or balancing.
---
More than two years of consistent, substantial survivor nerfs and next to no viable survivor perk or item releases would disagree with you. Killers have received a few substantial buffs and meta-defining perks within the same timeframe.
---
&gt;Nerfing Killers on Release before they are Properly Tested
---
Maybe they intentionally release killers stronger than they want them to be on the PTB? Your issue seems to be that you take PTB for the end product. They are adjustments the devs deemed necessary for release. Without the PTB, we might have simply never seen the non-adjusted killers to begin with.
---
&gt;yet the problem of survivors revealing him behind stuff still exists
---
As does the problem of survivors not being able to reveal him right out in the open.
---
&gt;OG Freddy was nerfed a few days after release and was notoriously the worst killer for a while after
---
And now he was buffed to be one of the most obnoxious and strongest killers.
---
&gt;Oni was nerfed on release from PTB and is now more or less a direct Hillbilly downgrade
---
Blood Fury is a direct upgrade to Billy's chainsaw, it's directly better in almost every single regard. That it takes Oni some time to get Blood Fury is the only reason why there's even a possible argument that Billy is better (I think Oni is, at least in public play).
---
&gt;Nerfing Killers that are Already Considered Weak
---
So for this you mention 2 instances of this happening for a lifespan of more than 3 years of the game. Hardly a pattern. Besides, a lot of people would argue these two killers are actually stronger now than they had been. Unless you want to argue original Legion should be in the game, which if so, no point in arguing this point further.
---
&gt;Nerfing the few Viable Killers when the Viable Killer Pool is still Small
---
What do you mean when you say "viable", exactly? If you mean "can win more of their red rank matches than they lose", then any single killer is viable. If you mean tournament-viable, then not only does your argument carry little weight because tournament games are 0.00X% of all matches being played in this game, but you also ignore that tournaments can adjust for base game imbalanced anyway, by means of formatting and ruling.
---
I do agree that a bunch of the weaker killers should ideally be buffed, but it's not like they aren't viable in public play. The better the player, the more likely it is that they can win with any killer the majority of their matches in red rank, even without considering perks, add-ons and offerings altogether.
---
Nurse was in the game for years and years before they recently nerfed her, and not only did she actually get buffed during those years, but the nerf she ended up ultimately getting doesn't do a lot about how brokenly powerful she is. Good Nurse players still destroy with her. I can show you a post-nerf tournament in which Nurse players won every single game, and a 1V1 competition where nobody managed to live more than a minute against her, unless they managed to lose her and hid, most "chases" ending in mere seconds. Even some of her add-ons are still very strong, including the range add-ons.
---
Similar story for Spirit, the nerfs don't change a whole lot about how nigh-brokenly strong she is.
---
&gt;Taking an Extremely long Time to Deliver on Promised Pro-Killer Changes
---
They take an extremely long time doing anything. What pro-survivor changes have there been? Survivor gameplay is the same old it has always been, for the most part. At least they actually promise improvements for killers, and come through with some. The only "promise" for survivors was that their approach would be to bridge the gap between solo and SWF play, toward which exactly nothing has been done.
---
&gt;Closing the hatch
---
At least it was implemented. Killers could always slug to prevent hatchplay anyway.
---
Never heard them promise a Doc rework. Doc is better than people give credit, I've seen some very good Doc players that have the timings down to use shocks rather oppressively in chases. But a buff/rework of sorts is coming, as we now know.
---
&gt;Disconnect penalties for survivors
---
Survivors disconnecting is decidedly worse for other survivors than it is for the killer, most of the time.
---
Again, not a promise. But they brought Corrupt Intervention and Pop Goes The Weasel, very effective and meta-level stalling perks. Ruin had also originally been buffed to be what it is now. Though I do think that rather than address this issue with perks, they should remove spotlights from gens and randomize their spawns more, to make survivors spend more time locating gens.
---
&gt;Buffing Survivor Perks while Saying they are being Nerfed
---
This is a pretty funny complaint even disregarding its inaccuracy, given that the survivor perk game has been more stale and worse than the killer counterpart for years. This is not an objective but emotional assessment of game development, definitely more on the scale of whiny complaints. As if the devs would be playing some silly game of pretending they are doing something but cheekily doing the opposite. 
---
&gt;Decisive Strike is more powerful now than it was before
---
It really isn't: 1. "rather than dealing with one you have to potentially deal with four" - the same was true before the nerf; 2. "it can go off even if you don't tunnel due to the timer's length" - before the nerf it could go off every time; 3. "it has no counterplay beyond leaving someone slugged" - that is totally counterplay, which again it didn't have before the nerf. You can also simply not tunnel (I do agree they should change the timer to 20-30 seconds, but only if DS can activate twice/stays active if downed within those 20-30 seconds indefinitely, until picked or healed up); 4. "and it's extremely exploitable (hopping into lockers to force a DS, hook diving with BT and DS, etc)" - those are not "exploits", those give the perk enough utility to make it a good perk at all, since without them it would have no use whatsoever against a tunnelling/slugging killer, this way it can be used offensively to an extent.
---
I do think DS (and potentially BT) should be disabled one exit gates are open.
---
&gt;Balanced Landing was given an arguably more powerful buff when Exhausted than it previously had, despite no other Exhaustion perks having a buff on Exhausted
---
If you are talking about the change where it would reduce stagger reduction while Exhausted, that was indeed a buff to the perk, and nobody ever said it wasn't. But it was also the only reason anyone ever used the perk anymore after the introduction of Exhaustion. Now it has been taken away again, and the perk is again not worth using over the other Exhaustion perks anymore.
---
It was a buff to the perk's primary purpose, which is protecting an unhooked survivor, and a complete nerf in regards to the person running the perk themselves, who gets nothing out of it anymore. It's a purely altruistic perk now, and I don't think BHVR ever intended to nerf its altruistic impact. I think the perk was more ridiculous before because it actually encouraged rushing unhooks, now it is more tactical and strictly protects the unhooked survivor, not preventing the killer from getting value out of that interaction if they actually go after the unhooker.
---
&gt;The only perk nerf in recent times that was a legitimate nerf was Mettle of Man
---
Because no other perks need nerfing, the pool of meta-viable survivor perks is small and stale enough as is. But Balanced Landing did get nerfed into not being viable anymore. Object Of Obsession and other aura-reading perks have indirectly but noticably been nerfed with the Undetectable status effect. Self-Care has indirectly been nerfed with the change in healing times. A variety of survivors perks have been nerfed out of PTB, when they already weren't good perks in the PTB, whereas some killer perks have been buffed coming out of it (e. g. Autodidact, Any Means Necessary; I'm All Ears, Corrupt Intervention).
---
&gt;Survivor Issues Consistently take Extreme Priority over Killer Issues
---
I don't see how. Which survivor issues have been solved? There should be many of them, if this is consistently the case. I remember among many things months during which Decisive Strike would not work when picked up under a hook, or where it would simply not work at all. Imagine the outcry if NOED sometimes simply did not down a survivor.
---
&gt;People who exploited the Legion double blade bug were publicly warned and banned, but people who exploited the Wake Up bug were not and there was no warning issued
---
During the time of the Wake Up bug, the Blade bug was actually back in the game. It was in fact even worse than before, affecting the same Action Speed modifier Wake Up did, thus slowing interactions such as vaulting down to a crawl. People were not being punished for abusing it either. The Mend exploit was also game-destroying, the Wake Up bug despite what all the killers say simply was not. Spending minutes having to stand around mending ruins gameplay and makes winning impossible. Wake Up made gens take 10.5 seconds less to finish, and sped up window vaults by an amount two already-existing perks always did.
---
&gt;The basement bug from the newest PTB was patched, but the bug where killers get stuck on generators has not been patched despite existing for longer
---
I have never been stuck on a gen as killer nor have seen a killer get stuck on a gen, not in my games nor any stream. The basement bug was a lot more common, and worse than that, it was abusable, by going out of your way to hook people in the basement.
---
&gt;Sound glitches introduced in Patch 3.4 that make survivors unable to be heard at all made it past PTB
---
Sound issues always sneak in with engine updates, and they affect both sides. Terror radii are being weird right now, for example, every killer seeming to have built-in Monitor &amp; Abuse.
---
&gt;SWF is an eternal problem with the game's balance that has yet to be addressed
---
3/4-people SWF make up few % of the overall playerbase, and of those few %, even less % are SWF that actually win more than solo players. As stats have shown, survival rates do not noticably go up with SWF. Most SWFs are also casuals and more detrimentally altruistic than non-SWF. But I do agree that SWF with good players playing efficiently are an issue, but I see no optimal solutions for that issue, without punishing SWFs as a whole, which is unhealthy for the game overall given that it would lead to players playing less and less players playing. Though I do think it would be fine to apply SWF-specific nerfs at least to red rank SWFs.
---
&gt;There has been a clear bias on how they handle development and patching of the game for the past few years
---
Again, don't see it at all. Survivors have been nerfed consistently for the past few years, have received no single meta-changing perk, item or game mechanic adjustment since Dead Hard (which is also worse off now on dedicated servers which favour killers on hit reg even more than P2P did), while killers have received more than a handful of meta-impacting perks and fun, engaging, viable killer characters, as well as new QoL mechanic changes such as the EGC.
---
&gt;spoiling Survivors in comparison
---
How so? Literally what did survivors get, which single thing, that has significantly changed the game for the better for them? Dedicated servers were the one thing that could have been a real Quality-of-Life improvement for survivors, but as I've mentioned, the devs did not use them to get rid of the killer latency advantage - the very networking of this game favours killers.
---
&gt;Considering how survivor queue times are getting longer
---
The increase in survivor queue times coincided directly with the change in how survivor lobbies are handled now, where if a killer dodges, the lobby does not get taken out of the queue. This has led to an increase in survivor queue time to get into a lobby to begin with - once there, killers come and go within seconds. The ideal distribution of players would be 1 killer to 4 survivors. I doubt the ratio is close to that, probably closer to approaching 1 to 2. It had been for about year prior to servers being introduced, and killer queue times were atrociously long during those months.
---
&gt;survivor is so easy it's boring and playing killer is so frustrating and unfair for the killer that it's not fun
---
This opinion of yours seems to be a very personal one. Neither the various players I watch nor the global statistics agree with it. If you are in a 4-SWF with 3 other good survivors, sure, escaping is pretty easy against most killer players, but likewise if you are a good killer, killing most survivors is pretty easy. How do you explain that killers comfortably average more than 2 kills across all ranks, how do you explain that many killer players almost never lose, playing for hours daily yet only having a handful of survivors escape through exits total at most? If survivor were so easy, it would not be so hard for people to escape. I can give you streams to watch if you want to get bored of how those killers are barely ever even challenged and win all the time. Fungoose, for one example of a good killer among countless others, has a 120 or something 4k streak with Plague without add-ons or Ruin. Should be impossible according to you, but simply isn't.
---
BHVR's development of the game overall has a variety of questionable or downright incompetent elements, but bias is not one of them that I can see. Any "bias" that is there is simple trying to keep the game attractive to as many people as possible, to make more money. If they really are starting to lose sales and players due to favouring survivors over killers, they would be the first to realize as much and change things, because they are a hundred-million-dollar company with advanced analytics and an imaginably vested interest in selling stuff and keeping people playing the game - I don't think they'd be stupid enough to lose tons of money over childish-seeming problems of whether they like survivors or killers more...
---
"You're in tune with nature on such a level that whenever you crouch, foliage grows up around you to hide your presence."
---
They hated him, for he spoke the truth. I still do just fine with legion, the vaulting and running speed buff feel great and now I don't have to worry about running sloppy butcher anymore because the yellow pin addon now applies it for free. People who wanted Nemesis to work with him are delusional.
---
5 dull totems and when the killer is using a hex perk the perk will activate one of the dull totems as long as there are dull totems to activate.
---
I play ghost face at red ranks with no add ons and always pip or double pip depending on hatch. 
---
Ruin - a must have at red ranks pretty much to keep the game consistent
---
Barbecue &amp; chili - a bp farming perk I always run, plus it gives me information if I’m having a rough time juggling survivors
---
Nurses’ calling - to find healing survivors and sneak up on survivors in the process,  no stalking just stealth
---
Sloppy butcher - to slow down the healing so I can find survivors easier
---
This is TrU3Ta1ents build but with barbecue, but it makes a big difference sinse thanatnaphobia only slows down a little bit at a time while barbecue can interrupt stealthy survivors. 
---
Anyways this build makes really good 4 mans crumble just because of the consistent pressure without knowing where gf is. 
---
If you have a hard time keeping up hook pressure roam around in stealth 20 meters away or so from the hook and wait till you see marks and chase them. Usually they lead you away from the hook and once you down them you can hook them probably just as the others finish healing. So now you know 3 survivors aren’t working on gens, and 2 are in a relative location and you know it.
---
all 5 could be a hex, though it require Haunted Ground which afflicts two totems at once and once one of them is cleansed the other becomes dull
---
Yep I agree with you 
---
and it would've been awesome
---
The moment I saw the image, I went to look for plague and went "nooooooo too far to the left" :(
---
I let one of them farm flash light blinds off me during this phase last night. Didnt let her go though.
---
When you que with a friend you get into games?
---
Ok
---
Honestly a very balanced killer. I love playing against him so far.
---
To be fair, I don't think as many people would play if it wasn't possible to play with friends. There should have just been some kind of middle-ground.
---
All 5 can be hexes. 
---
Haunted, ruin, thrill, devour.
---
It's up to you man, changing things may not sound sweet in Dead by Daylight's standards but see how it can go for you. I do hope you can import your inventory and items into others.
---
I swear to god, I thought this was going to be a Skyrim meme.
---
I mean, there is a gen thats almost complete, a hoomed survivor, a dead person, and another survivor she knows that's nearby. Unfortunately for you she has no reason to leave unless she wanted to be nice.
---
 so have I. I never said I lost pip every single 3k so idk why you're acting like that's what I said.
---
Also in the UK getting fairly long que times
---
Ive posted this like 4 times and everyone just ignores me so im guessing its working for most people but some of us are just unlucky..... i havnt been able to play for 3 days because of this problem..
---
Better get grinding
---
Iron Grasp is just bleh, I would run Agitation over it if you really want a hooking perk.
---
"Hurr hurr Oni is easy to play against, just don't get hit and loop him lol." This is what you sound like. While you might be facing top level survivors, most people aren't looping God's. It would be nice being able to escape from an OnI but if he hits you all you can do is stall for a little while before he puts you on the hook.
---
True to that. 
---
I think a new mode to the game would do it justice that rewards coordination and encourages teamwork.
---
Imagine a mode where only dwight had 100% repair speed and claudette,meg, and jake all had like 50% repair speed, only claudette could heal, only jake would sabotage and only meg had a chase advantage or something Lol
---
If rimmar from dbd saw this, pls do not be mad it was just a bug and it happend to me like 15 times since oni was released, the only way to escape is to grab a survivor from the gen
---
God bless this thread.
---
Wait... the game has a tutorial that teaches you that stuff?!? I've got 300 hours played and never knew there was a tutorial.
---
Not funny, didn't laugh.
---
THIS OPINION ON OPINIONS IS TOO STRONG PLZ NERF
---
oh
---
CC: Every game since Resident Evil 4 . It /was/ cool the first time.
---
I don’t play Michael so sorry if this is a dumb question - if they’re trying to hide in bushes or whatever can’t you use your stalk to see the white outline of them?
---
Which perk counters his slugging?
---
She was a fun to play against I’m more mad at my teammates after I spent the whole match safely saving them from the hook and one was running from the killer around the hook instead of running away and the other was teabaging behind the wall after I saved him from death 50 times
---
Yeah you can still see OoO they just can't see you. On a side note, OoO is op against Freddy.
---
Yah i've seen a few posts but they don't get upvoted. There are also a few posts on behaviors bug report forums but it looks like those also aren't gaining traction.
---
I put the "can the subreddit help the xbox players" part hoping the pc players would help the homies out but we'll see
---
If you mean the next whole Tome, likely the 28th of January. 
---
If you mean level 4 of *this* tome, the 11th of December
---
Oh that's what you did. It didn't show on the vid so I was confused
---
Not laugh, didn’t funny
---
uh what? how is swf relevant and what do you mean by new?
---
also i can find survivors with whispers and no BBQ
---
I see no god up there
---
**Other than ME**
---
I don't listen to Tru3 because for one he's strongly opinionated, and two he's a extremely negative and I don't enjoy watching a streamer that literally complains every second of every match.
---
You have to hold it down a bit. If you just insta swing, I believe it only injures them.
---
May the entity bless you
---
If they ever want to do different modes, I wonder if something where different survivors have their own specific traits could work. The issue there would be balancing and I don't think they would try or do very well in that regard; I haven't played for super long, since January or around there, but I have heard from tons of people that devs don't really play both sides equally themselves.
---
*Awigatou gozaimasu, Entity-san* **UwU**
---
I love how everyone here is ignoring that the second shot was clearly missed displaying how braindead Huntress hitboxes are but it doesn't matter because owning some 14 y/o is more important than broken mechanics
---
I live in EU and yes it’s true that EU is a way harder region than NA. It isn’t Tru3 spouting bullshit
---
there are people here, like weirdodin, who say that exact thing
---
Second hit clearly missed. What a fun game
---
Monstrous Shrine is not losing that position that easy
---
Yeah I don't think they do either. Also a lot of devs don't do above green ranks really too.
---
 But it would be awesome to have a role-specific mode with new objectives and all. It'd also separate the player base, which is something they don't want to do.
---
46 ms on console? That can’t be real
---
No, he proved you can do well in red ranks with any killer.
---
Remember when he said that he somehow is the only person that gets optimal survivors? Like 9/10 times he's says that when he is versing potatoes like wtf.
---
EVEN on the killers screen you missed that second shot. Fucking braindead game
---
You do need to remember tho, you have to lose chase with the survivors so that is what gives them more time to do gens. But I agree, it sounds like a fun build.
---
exactly
---
It's all good! Crouching avoids triggering the traps. Hags will certainly place them near hooks, especially in grass.
---
Dropping pallets doesn’t matter if survivors do gens. There’s plenty of pallets on every map.
---
Yeah. But not when I'm alone.
---
It’s when you let go of the button to search the chest and your character quickly drops the lid with a thud, vs finishing the search and them slowly closing it.
---
I’m not sure either on PC, but I just ordered a modded controller that I can program to spam any buttons on PS4.
---
Wow so funny vibing haha very original
---
Unbreakable and good medkits counter slugging easily
---
Honestly it's the complaining and the excuses that does it, everyone is subject to their opinion. Of course according to him the community is ganging up on him, it has nothing to do with anything he does.
---
Trust me, I was as surprised as you are
---
Why do I even have to play the game, it's pointless and should be automatic.....
---
On ps4 I couldn’t skip the tutorial and neither could my friend I pressured into buying the game. I got it around like? Last year maybe a month or so after Christmas?
---
Yeah I see what you mean. In the healing example it is technically a mistake that I made I just figured that if I was facing away from the pallet that it wouldn’t make me turn around and throw it. The game is sort of quirky sometimes. Don’t worry about it, we’re cool.
---
20s, Canadian. Casual SWF/PC player that prefers games with a discord call, not super into competitive playing / sometimes the best way to enjoy a match is to meme!build and get facecamped after failing to use head-on on the aggro for the fifth time. I only started playing about three months ago so I've got an okay handle on the game, play between ranks 5 and 10.
---
I change my steam name way too often, but you can find me on discord at ratsbane#0666
---
You lose chase every time you get stunned by a pallet and then choose to kick it. So every time you get stunned in a chase you get 5% faster until you swing. It's bloodlust but better.
---
Had a swf help me with end game challenge made my day ;) but being toxic to killers or survivors does happen in dbd for yeah XD
---
He's not really worse at anything but high tier play, because the difference in his ability to perform is only limited to the sensitivity and layout of a controller to a keyboard and mouse. He'll most likely become almost as powerful as his PC version when they increase the sensitivity max on consoles, which I *think* they've talked about doing for crossplay purposes but don't quote me on that.
---
He's still very strong on console, I like where he's at, both playing him and playing against him.
---
Id like to once again suggest skill checks similar to when youre trying to get a bear trap off? Make them slightly bigger and greats stall the timer by half a second(or even better idea, make Camaraderie do this so its actually freaking useful). Keeps the second hook intense. Plus you have to focus on yourself, so when you get torn off the hook you could be more disoriented. Hell I know Im oblivious to killers when Im doing a skillcheck on gens.
---
HybridPanda made a passing reference to the devs changing him "in a couple of weeks" in his last episode of Shrine Watch.
---
Doesn't mean anything, though. There won't be any changes until AT LEAST the next mid-chapter patch.
---
This is big brain time
---
It’s terrifying
---
you really should be directing this comment at the original parent comment since that's the one that implies that point first. but since you're a survivor main you never would do that
---
Thanks for displaying how easy and broken Huntresses hitboxes are!
---
[here’s a link to his Instagram! ](https://instagram.com/kasey.quevedo?igshid=1ijg9k9k6g3hf)
---
did you really dc just because of that. you lost all your points just because you got mad at the game for being dumb.
---
That's not good, that's just annoying lol.
---
Technically yes as we had knock out, but the one week they had bbq in the shrine when the switch version was out we had a different shrine.
---
I think I would cry if I was facing the doctor with my UI looking like that.
---
Basically when my teammate tried to heal me it froze me in this state, the killer couldn't get me either and when the end game clock finished I was still there. Took the killer leaving to end it.
---
The game runs on servers now. The killers connection in no way affects your connection to the server. The killer having bad internet is disadvantageous to the killer.
---
The turning and flick is ass compared to pc though
---
Either you have a serious misunderstanding of the lore of legion, or the geography of canada
---
It’s amazing, Noah
---
not aura reading, but whispers &gt; bbq tbh
---
He plays MOBA’s too, just not ranked mode.
---
They have a sign
---
If dividing the playerbase is an issue, hopefully cross-platform play will help with that. My only worry is playing against players that have an edge over me because I'm on console; I sometimes have a hard time with survivors that are able to give me the run around by going in circles and I think one issue is console framerate.
---
Well your game must be broken or some shit cause for me it’s the same speed as long as the bar is lit up the whole time
---
You should have heard how many tines I threw out the word "wallhacks!" The third time I ever played against Myers.
---
The speed of rotation doesn't even affect wiggle, just do it at the same speed it takes to do a 360... Same with button making. If you're breaking your controller or cramping then your actually making it too hard.
---
Friends experimented with this in customs. The faster masher got hooked first, and only after the time it took to walk to the next hook in the basement+pick up survivor+ set survivor did the slower masher get hooked. Faster masher still died first.
---
So, not stop gimmicks. Just people talking things way too seriously.
---
absolutely. bbq doesn't find you a survivor right at the start of the game. it doesn't allow you to catch the last survivor once hatch is closed.
---
Losing power after pick up is actually an upside. It lets you end it early and save blood
---
And saying RIP to iridescent hatchets isnt a bad thing either. Especially when it requires protection hits which 9/10 times just sets the team back more.
---
English is not everyone's first language.
---
Time zones exist
---
I mean. Everything is compared to the pc
---
Will do
---
Only once
---
I think it was useful on old freddy to help find sleeping survivors,  but now... its only use is camping.
---
The community is one of the worst I've ever seen
---
Only pc and switch run on servers.
---
Makes sense homo
---
I have a feeling that BHVR would fix this by making the Legion unable to vault pallets at all
---
Not gonna lie, I’ve become a survivor main cuz I’m afraid of queue times....
---
Eh, call me crazy but I think it is to avoid confusion on the survivor side. 
---
As you might know, Lery's, Hawkins and The Game have a ton of RNG. The layout of rooms changes every match. This understandably makes it hard to figure out where the heck you are on the map. The only constant thing is the border of the map, but that might not be too helpful.
---
Open map have the advantage of set landmarks. If you look around you, you will see the location of landmarks and understand perfectly well where you are. Rng of the gates can thus be more random as you can relate their location to the landmarks and understand where they are.
---
On closed maps on the other hand you get none of that, all landmarks spawn randomly and it's a one big guess where is what. Gates being on direct opposites are SOME form of a constant landmark that might help survivors find themselves on the map.
---
It's probably just me stretched-out theory tho.
---
&gt; survivors can play extra safe at the beginning and deny you blood 
---
use whispers. it's really good on him
---
After having gone against him a lot the last few days, I respectfully disagree. If you're a good killer, you'll be good with oni. I can't tell you how many times he's been like right up my ass before I even knew where he was. I don't know if his terror radius is off, but man is that guy stealthy for how loud you'd think he is. His power is actually very usable at most loops, you just have to start charging at different times. Unbreakable only counters his slug once, that's it. His power isn't 'lost' when he picks someone up, it just ends at the level it was at so refilling it doesn't take that long. I've face many oni's on lery's and they had zero trouble yeeting around that map. Oni is a very good killer, and anyone that says otherwise either hasn't played him enough to learn him or isn't a very good killer to begin with. And before you say "well you're probably some rank 20 with 100 hours." I've got over 2500 hours and would consider myself pretty neutral when it comes to both sides of the game. While I admit oni CAN have some early game issues, finding people isn't that hard, and one you find one person it's pretty gravy from there.
---
Axey girl for huntress
---
So losing your momentum and map coverage is worth saving some blood?
---
Looping is the meta because it works the best. Devs never intended it, yet they haven’t done anything to change it.
---
This isn't allowed on the subreddit. It falls under oversaturated content. Too many people post about unbalanced matchmaking.
---
I said medkits as well.
---
I kinda refuse to believe this is real because of how dumb they sound lol
---
Doesn’t seem to be too hard on survivor. Killer on the other hand....
---
Wouldn't worry you've not drawn a full on swinging veiny cock giving the thigh a howdya do and im not being funny but a slither of fabric isn't gonna cover any genders privates even in the game you essentially get a complete view of the spirits ass menu screens like a private showing to a RANK stripper.
---
I see your point the entity's just a god that gets life from torture. suicide would further power it and just send the survivor back to the campfire I didn't read carefully and I'm just kinda pulling this out my ass but in not sure but I could very easily be wrong
---
Even if it's not under the rules, which I'm sure it is, it's scummy. This subreddit isn't somewhere for you to gain a following on YouTube.
---
When the FUCK are we gonna get Boomerang Jack from Australia? Same principal as huntress, except his boomerang returns instead of having to resupply.
---
Mb, didn’t know someone else posted something like this first
---
I said "most loops" not all. Don't put words in my mouth my friend. Are you on console? Cause oni is really good on pc.
---
I have a youtube channel where I show how I made it. Look up Oxu
---
Whenever I play survivor I’m embarrassed by people who taunt in the exit. Only reason I stick around is if I’m trying to make sure no one’s getting hooked. If killer comes in I just run out. No need to be an ass.
---
Replace iron grasp with bbq and chili and I’m all ears with ruin
---
For me if anyone gets off the hook I automatically let them win
---
She's not a little boy.
---
Charging your power while having your camera turned a certain way allows you to make tighter turns.
---
U P G R A D E
---
Look up my youtube channel "Oxu" I show how I made it start to finish
---
Oni isn’t weak on pc, console though is a different story
---
I definitely see this angle, and it applies in a lot of games and a lot of situations... but the scratch marks are *supposed* to stick out like a sore thumb. If all players had the option to make them florescent green, and that resulted in more unimpaired killers seeing scratch marks... I mean, good, right?
---
That being said, this whole angle of "BHVR obviously doesn't care at all! They're IGNORING us!!11one", just because this hasn't *already* been done, is infuriating. But thaaaat's reddit!
---
The legion nerfs continue
---
The thing is that the game was never meant to be this big
---
Same happened to my friend one time, he was stuck like that too. Could heal if I got close, and could be injured and downed but wouldn't bleed out. He could also be healed and EGC didn't kill him either, so he had to dc
---
You can only be matched with who is playing , not sure what people aren't getting .
---
Dont have them but i will try
---
FOR ANYONE TRYING TO SEE HOW I MADE IT: [https://youtu.be/Oab1ZdwfflA](https://youtu.be/Oab1ZdwfflA)
---
Really good killers on pc aren't as much so on console either. Feels bad.
---
I guess. I thought they had changed that though.
---
Yeah. I helped someone on their Trapper challenge then they hooked me post gens being powered. I mean, I wasn’t owed the exit but it felt like a dick move.
---
&gt; GF, Plague and Oni were not nerfs since they weren't on the liver servers they were adjustments after viewing footage of different playstyles on PTB.
---
This is utter nonsense lmao it doesn't matter it wasn't live servers. The power was still nerfed as opposed to what it was when presented to the public initially.
---
And to be fair, I used to play and get ranks around my rank so why all the sudden is it like this?
---
No you're fine, lol. But the thing is, even God's have gotten manipulated by humans. And the entity gets power from the survivors emotions, the killers emotions/acts, and from taking matters into its own hands.. But there's nothing talking about if a survivor takes their own life. Especially because The Entity doesn't fully understand human and human life.
---
Bind your stuggling button to your mousewheel. Its much easier
---
Wait me?
---
Be careful, [my post got removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/e6mkhg/anyone_else_having_unbalanced_matches_lately_810/)
---
This issue has only happened to me once before and I ended up having to reinstall cause nothing else worked.
---
Easier to tweak a couple values on a perk that was abusable on multiple maps then redesign maps. Also easier to change 1 thing over multiple. Less resources and money for BHVR. Since they can’t re-sell maps, it’s probably harder for them to get the okay to redo them.
---
Try binding your struggling button to the mousewheel, its way better
---
yeah, both mass murder and jaywalking are crimes.
---
I was waiting for the dc noise lol
---
Thanks for the heads up, glad I’m not the only one because I feel like I’m crazy for thinking this is shitty.
---
&gt; You have seen the stats right??
---
Those stats are absolute junk. They do not control for a single relevant variable.
---
I mean if you were put into a metal box and the door to it was shut and locked there's no escape unless they're monitoring you right if they're doing it for enjoyment and you sit there and dont act distressed well wheres the entertainment which the entity IS in fact monitoring you consider and it plays a part in all trails you play like end game collapse and also struggle stage on the hook so this theory can be correct but also there are high chances it isn't also
---
Honest opinion, this is just me but it looks really good, almost official quality as well, the Killer perks are something I would see a lot in game to actually be real, the survivors perk are interesting, really cool...
---
He’s not good against most loops. He’s good at weak loops where every other killer is good at as well. Tier 3 Myers is easier to control, has an insta down, and lunge range. How does he still get looped?
---
Seriously show me these tiles where Oni excels and I’ll believe you
---
I got it a few years ago on PS4 and I didn't even see a tutorial option.
---
Maybe I was just a blind fuck but I swear I didn't see it
---
&gt;Be careful, my post got removed
---
Why wouldn't it be removed? Your screenshot doesn't even show anything out of the normal.
---
Course sports talking about challenge and adversity
---
Michael Tier 3 then 10 seconds later he tiers down with someone killed.
---
Wait, but Oni can traverse it just fine...? You aren't penalized for running into things, and you can turn quite well for the speed you're going--- so unless your angle is waaaaay off, you should still be fine.
---
Even if you have to skrrrt along something, it's still probably faster.
---
Ah yes, a survivor leaping 30 feet away every 5 seconds like leap frog
---
It may be a newer thing where they’re forcing people to do it I guess. I had watched a lot of gameplay before buying it so I felt confident and wanted to skip the tutorial but it wouldn’t let me until I did it for both killer and survivor,, couldn’t complain with the free blood points tho
---
&gt;Thanks for the heads up, glad I’m not the only one because I feel like I’m crazy for thinking this is shitty.
---
This happens to everyone because guess what? These are normal matchmaking. Also the reason why these posts are against the rules.
---
Oh yeah, sure, if the looper can loop all game and the SWF decide not to tell each other of the killer’s position when it is revealed to them like most SWFs. It’s really not going have much of an affect in SWF and I don’t people will choose it that much over other perks. You’re making out to be real OP when it’s not even close
---
Hey boss. Legion is 115. They’re normal move speed.
---
Literally nothing is different. The system matches you by your rank first. Failing that, it expands the rank range until it finds someone for you to play with. If the only people queuing at that moment are level 20s, you'll be matched with 20s. Somewhere in there it factors region and other variables as well. The alternative is extended wait times while you wait for someone your level to hit the start button.
---
get a load of this guy
---
There is no skill cap in wiggling, what? Either you are far away from the hook and you wiggle out or you don't. 
---
All struggling does is make you annoyed, it doesn't wear you out it makes you want to play less.
---
Neither of those things have anything related to skill.
---
Legion had no counterplay at all, can vault pallets as fast as survivors, vault windows, literally nothing you could do against him when he could look down and follow blood and either hit you again or wait till you died from not mending lmao
---
Literal cuckold with 30 hrs in dbd bought it two weeks ago giving input what a fkin dumbass
---
Id say start with Dwight or Claudette first, as they have some straight fowards perks that are pretty good. 
---
Hex perks are perks that turn dull totems on yhe map into bright Hex totems with special properties, depending on what Hex perk you have. Destroy these whenever you see them!
---
Scratch marks are marks the killer can see to give them info on where you were/are. You leave scratch marks behind you whenever you run. They stop appearing when you stop running so just walk to leave none. 
---
You can get add ons and perks from leveling up thr bloodweb of characters. 
---
Offerings are special tokens you can redeem before a match starts. They can sway the match. 
---
And tbh Id say all killers are pretty scary when you start but for me it was Billy. Do not underestimate his speed!
---
Saaaame. Like it’s not my fault your team farmed you! I’m giving you a chance, other killers won’t give it to you, then you have the audacity to teabag me when you get up?!
---
They’re on console so they probably get it through dms as Xbox doesn’t have chat (don’t know about ps4 tho). I’ve had to block a lot of salty survivors as well as killers.
---
dude i've done this before and i felt absolutely horrible, i wholeheartedly apologize for survivor's whose trust i betrayed for my 2 sacrifices during EGC
---
I don't make you leave. I just keep working so that you feel my disappointed parent stare from across the generator.
---
I get messages like this when I'm doing dailies and don't even try with a killer like Nurse/Huntress who are difficult on console. It's really pathetic sometimes how they feel the need to boost their self-esteem this way
---
Thank you very much!
---
Yeah, I just had a match with 4 iridescents and they all counted, so I guess it's just bad luck :/
---
Imagine how cute Demo would be doing a gen
---
Fuckin a Christ. Then uninstall and quit being a bitchy little baby online. Fuck this community
---
Just like every killer ever in existence, what’s your point?
---
High A tier killer, a top 3 imo
---
lol having an opinion and getting -17 karma for something so simple and non-combative... Herd mentality of the survivor main.
---
I only do that if someone dc’s and i get everyone. Then it’s a bit of pity for them.
---
Rank 1 surv on Ps4. Hes pretty balanced. Bad players get wrecked good players do ok.
---
Different universes
---
I'm pretty sure it refers to being able to "flick" your camera right at the end of an Oni charge. If you were to become good at flicking, you'd be able to down survivors much more easily.
---
The cooldown for a.missed attack for both of them is roughly the same
---
Yeah and you ignored my comparison of Tier 3 Myers. How can tier 3 Myers get looped with increased lunge, instadown, vault speed and Oni can’t be looped all of the sudden when he’s way harder to control?
---
And people still think that the earth is flat... foolish
---
Well, 4 seconds cooldown on FF isn’t really an issue if you zone survivors into dead areas. Also using FF when you aren’t already near a survivor isn’t smart, because you want to use it to body block and cut off angles. And survivors want to worry about getting hit with DW because they have to stop working on generators. If they sit still they go down. If they run you’ll usually catch them. DW is a slow down the game perk, which isn’t the greatest but still better than nothing.
---
*PLTHSOFNCIRNDHOLYSHIT*
---
this is one of the reasons why i dont press on second hook unless im playing with friends
---
oh, rip. Sorry, didn't realise
---
He’s really good dude! Honestly better than hillbilly tbh
---
Only counterargument is the last point.
---
Oni is the captain (of terror) now, and that chase music is amazing.
---
I've had an hour go inbetween games before just waiting, disconnecting and then waiting again. And the cycle repeats.
---
Alright.
---
1. You don't have to main anyone. For killers, just try them all out and see which ones you find fun. All of them are different with different playstyles so test it out to see which you like. For survivors, play whichever one looks the coolest or prettiest for you. However I would start with Claudette as a survivor for beginners since she comes with self care which is pretty great for beginners.
---
2. A hex perk is a perk tied to a totem. Most hex perks activate at the start of the game. A dull totem will light up, that lit totem is the hex totem. A survivor can break the hex totem to deactivate the perk for the rest of the game. Although the hex perk no one escapes death (noed) only activates after the generators are all done.
---
3. Scratch marks are left by a running survivor. If they're dull then it means the survivor that was running was there just a few seconds ago, but if its relatively bright then they were just there and you can follow it to try and find the survivor. I suggest learning how to follow scratch marks early on as its really useful.
---
4.
---
My friend there are great videos made by a youtuber called Bricky for killer info. And a youtuber named Noob3 for good survivor tips.
---
I want you to find me where it says in the rules. It doesn't so why must you say it is scummy? If anything you are just describing yourself
---
I kind of like to play leatherface, but only occasionally. I live ghost face, honestly my favorite killer besides legion.
---
&gt;most people aren't looping God's
---
Looping is literally the game

“Hey honey you want to take care of this monster for me?”

I just changed my name to "Die Terribly" on xbox. Feelsgoodman
---
The killer can be Gary Coleman or your wife, pick your poison
---
Who you main is yours to choose, it's the killer or survivor that seems most compelling to you
---
Hex means there is a totem (three skulled bone structure) that deactivates the perk once it has been broken
---
Scratch Mark's appear around the charecter model as a survivor runs, only the killer sees them, if the survivor has the perk 'fexated' then they can see them too.
---
Addons and perks are gathered in the blood web, on the right of your screen when you go into the charecter menu
---
All killers are dangerous, But the ones that do best are The Nurse, Freddy Krueger (the nightmare), The Spirit and The Hillbilly.
---
Offerings are things you get in the blood web and sacrifice before a match starts, burning them has many different effects depending on the type of offering it is.
---
You literally said that the only reason why the flashlights were fixed fast was because it was a survivor thing. Your not being downvoted because of a "survivor mentality" your being downvoted because what you said was stupid and before you say anything I play both sides and believe it or not flashlights take some skill to use effectively.

I watch no0b3 and will check out Bricky! Thank you!

If America can’t dismantle the 2 party system, I have no faith in dbd community playing both sides like us lol
---
While I don’t really believe most of that person’s response and I doubt this person is getting 20 second downs all the time, body blocking windows and pallets are easy ways for legion to break a loop, especially when coming out of FF. Won’t break all loops, but it can break plenty.
---
Alternate universes.
---
The Entity is near-omipotent being which exists within its own realm. It is able to reach into any universe and take people/creatures from any point in time within them.
---
It can then create Realms from the memories of those it takes. These Realms play host to Trials, with the aim of the Killer sacrificing the Survivors. However, the Survivors must have chance to escape, as the Entity feeds off of their hope.
---
Instant main
---
I’m sorry sir. I’m just trying to show that I love drawing and this game and would like to combine the two to try something different. Double Strike for me to change their gender because this one person isn’t allowed to step out of boundaries for a little bit. Would you like me to fuck myself while I’m at it? I’m not making it sexual, I’m just showing others what I can do.
---
This guy is also the type of person to say Billy should be 105 movement speed And the charge time of the chainsaw should take five seconds while making him move at 150 movement speed during chainsaw sprint
---
When the survivors aren’t anymore useful to the Entity they get thrown into the void, the same place where Rin’s father is currently
---
Looping is literally the game for survivors. Mind games are the game for killer. It's absolutely fine if you never lose the killer and get downed if you can stall him for 5 gens, even if you die your team wins. This game is a 1v4
---
Ok, but considering PC has the largest population and this is reddit, it should be assumed everyone is playing on PC unless they specify otherwise.
---
Had the monstrous shrine basement challenge and i had to proxy the basement as bubba, felt bad for it :/
---
Did they need him after the PTB? He looked really fun and I want to play him on PS4. I know he's not as good as on PC but he still looks fun
---
New Killer: Gary Coleman.
---
Power: Young and Powerful. Bookcases spawn around the map. Survivors can interact with the bookcases to collect Gary Coleman books. Whenever a survivor is within 8 meters of you, you can press M2 to offer to sign a book. If the survivor does not have a book, you become enraged and shoot them to death with an M4.
---
Hit the things
---
Why if it was from a child she...surprised adopted
---
Edit it out! This screenshot is screensaver worthy.
---
Didn't ignore it, it just isn't the same, oni can attack and break that pallet much fast than Myers, you know how many times oni has lunged and hit me through walls with his shit? A lot. Like I said, I really disagree with that sentiment. Oni is not worse than wraith, pig, doc, clown. If you think that then your username is very correct, cause that's a very Chad thing to say.
---
I swear people are just shitposting this for easy karma even though Legion is stronger thanks to the buffs to FF's movement/vault speeds.
---
A good hag has the best map presence in the game, it all depends on trap placement. Hag also doesn't need ruin. No killer "needs" ruin
---
I second this action
---
Splinters used to be available for non-licensed characters, but they removed them with the shop update. (Since you can buy them for shards and whatnot.)
---
a lot of assumptions you just made
---
My bad. But yeah at this point, I think I’m just gonna take another month long hiatus from this game. I didn’t mind waiting to get into a lobby with ranks around mine so I don’t know why they changed it.
---
Thanks for the answer!

Still didn’t expect it to blow up the way it did. Ik it it was a good meme though. It’s not like the title is responsible for the upvotes clearly
---
Played many games. Got all MoM stacks once. Got instadowned so didn’t even get to use it. Not good enough
---
Yeah that's basically my experience with teammates against Trapper.
---
I never opted for a STBFL/Sloppy build, and my Legion play has only drastically increased from this change. I really love newest legion, and he feels so fun and fast.
---
I would say main Claudette, Feng or Dwight to start out on. Most people have explained your other questions. The scariest killer is any when you first start. Oni, Hag, Billy and Spirit are the ones that give me jump scares now. I main Feng and love her for doing gens. It’s important to just find what survivor/killer you like the most and play as them. For some advice, don’t DC just because you didn’t get your way (yes some killers will camp or tunnel you) and don’t be toxic as it just adds to the issue of toxicity between survivors and killers already. I’m glad you want to buy the game, I hope you enjoy it as it’s an amazing game!
---
Same here. Too bad devs mainly care about PC
---
It’s all from different universes. The devs even say that, so that’s why we got quentin going up against leatherface and laurie going up against freddy krueger.
---
Equal to or next to Billy.
---
Haha get it because she hides in bushes haha so funny
---
It's not stellar. The range in breakout is really small. Pretty much have to throw the game to use the build.
---
I get roughly 95-110 on average. I consider anything around 90-100 ping good and sometimes in really good matches I can get around 85 ping. I usually dodge when it's over 120-130
---
Deceased by dawn
---
It's proof. The moon is an artificial construct.
---
Not alive by morning
---
But then what about the new licensed killers we got? Neither Demogorgon nor Ghostface got splinters
---
And then there's the situations where you finally get into a match, and get stuck on a generator while trying to damage it like 5 mins into the game
---
No problem!
---
That legion nerf is a little much
---
What counts as being toxic?
---

Translation: 
---
Sick of going down to one hit.
---
Skill (or somewhat skill based) killer power.
---
Its like that for pretty much all the dlcs that adds a killer. That and the ones that are "This game is too killer/survivor sided "
---
OoO is still active but they cannot see your aura when you're in undetectable status.
---
I will say tho that the perk still lights up when facing the killers direction, but gives no aura. Not sure if bug or intentional.
---
&gt;Missing stuff like that is problematic if you want to use the numbers for an analysis of game balance.
---
But all of those things have to be considered to be skewing the game in both directions. For every survivor that decides to go on a suicide mission for the last person (which is actually still a valid play within the game context), there are killers that give the last survivor hatch (which has no validity whatsoever from a pure game perspective). I am actually one of those players that not seldomly gives the last survivor hatch. There are also killers that let multiple survivors go, farm with them, mess around, play more unoptimally than they could on purpose, for more points or a more fun experience, and so on (also something I often do). Point being that why would we expect such variables to skew the rates significantly in either direction, when both sides have things that skew the "kills per match metric"?
---
&gt;this is literally the exact issue. That is not adequate for statistical analysis
---
What issue? The original poster argued they weighed 1ks as much as 4ks, but that makes no sense with regards to what the stats actually are, which is literally telling us how many kills killers on average get. Nothing to do with "weighing".
---
&gt;Source it please?
---
Had to look myself: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/866137#Comment_866137
---
&gt;on the flip side, this means that killer rage quits where everyone got out were not counted which is an issue.
---
Survivor disconnects happen way more often in games survivors are losing, which means a lot of loss games/kills are excluded from the stats. The devs can now apparently also differentiate between killer and survivor disconnects, so there's that.
---
&gt;you're using survivors being individually bad to argue that the game is killer sided
---
I did say the at its core is survivor-favoured, but for actual matches being played, statistics and all of my experience with the game tell a different story. I consider myself to be a good survivor player, better even than I consider myself to be a killer player despite having started out as a killer main, and yet when I solo-queue, my chances of survival are a lot lower than my chances of success if I play killer. The fellow survivors I get in red ranks solo-queue are regularly bad, and the survivors I face in red ranks as killer regularly are bad too. If I watch streams of good players, which I do a lot, they also die more as survivor yet win the vast majority of their killer matches. It takes 4 decent or good survivors to have a competitive survivor side, yet only 1 decent or good killer to have a competitive killer side, and the former scenario is just very rare to occur outside of SWFs that actually get 4 of such players together, whereas that killer scenario happens literally every time a good killer player decides to play killer.
---
I mean legion has never been a good killer ever. They were broken but broken doesn't mean good
---
Petition to remove trapper's walking animation with him ominously sliding towards survivors
---
Not entirely. They just moderately decrease the stalking distance.
---
Thank you very much for this HUGE pile of knowledge!
---
I don't understand why they can't just have the good be invisible when the torso/head is not equipped.
---
LMAO that injured run is like an accelerated animation of the zombies from half life.
---
Almost like it's a problem affecting a large sum pf players.
---
When I can actually play the game (which has been difficult since the last update) Oni has been laughably bad. I’m decent at the game but by no means am I great, I’ve been able to run most oni’s for 2-3 gens without much difficulty.
---
That’ll probably change once people learn to play him better but it’s been a breeze playing survivor against him
---
Same with old Freddy, doctor, and plague. They're not the best but people really get annoyed by them
---
What will this community find to whine about next? Probably something dumb.
---
Don’t twerk/tap crouch in front of a killer, don’t point at a killer, don’t mock the killer at the gates and don’t spam them with saying they cheated or they respect something (i.e. you being the last survivor).
---
Sounds also reasonable, but denies kinda the idea of the perk or? I think the effects should only be triggered when you're actually "left behind".
---
Can vouch for people being clueless. Whenever I find a match with a nice killer I think they’re just messing with me for an easy kill. Sometimes they’ll carry me near the hatch and I’ll frantically look for it when I’m done wiggling out, or I wiggle out and escape before they can bring me there. 
---
I haven’t played this game in awhile but after being a part of the Reddit community it definitely keeps me motivated to be more open minded next time I play.
---
This happens in every game with characters being released lol
---
Sadly some people deal with their games crashing during the loading screen. It's happened to me a few times and I feel god awful for it :/
---
Looks slightly below Identity V in quality.
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
But Billy can use his power forever
---
99 them and let them go, the fuckers won't know what hit them...i love ghostface
---
Ok! Will avoid that!
---
But none of those killers you mentioned were broken, only bad and annoying. They all had counter play, old legion did not
---
Might, but it is the game map and lullaby is infinitely more obnoxious.
---
Good job bro
---
Are you trying to use a secret offering? Moris, shroud of separation or splinters?
---
I suggest trying out the outfit with the mask half covered in blood. It's the best mask IMO.
