Very bold. 
---
---
---
Okay.
---
Approved.
---
Damnnnn! Beautiful timing with that adrenaline 
---
Yep me and the r2
---
That’s called pretty good job so far. 
---
They said it may return in the future and the numbers could be diFFerent. I imagine they have been keeping an eye on what the community thinks. It'll be fine.
---
Due to there being no stats released by the devs on this topic there is no way I can give accurate numbers so yes, I did. It’s a rather common thing for people to do but thank you for choosing not to answer. It really helped your case.
---

---
Anyways I’m done with any and all conversations we currently have going as your acting like a 12 
---
y/o pre-pubescent boy trying to rebel against their parents.
---
I actually did completely forget that the ability doesn't have to be fully charged to use it. That would be a good change as well. As for missed attacks ending Frenzy... it's worth considering. Bigger punish and reduces the power level of the ability significantly, but it's a pretty powerful ability to begin with. I don't know how I feel about the movespeed adjust though, it just reintroduces the unfun aspect of chasing as a slow killer.
---
I like the direction you're going with these suggestions, though.
---
This might be the most overpowered perk I've ever read. You could stand at the totem and keep them there for 3 hours ROFL 
---
Not angry, just being blunt. You sent a notification to me when you did that, so I let you know. No need to be passive aggressive about it.
---
No Care. Sounds fitting
---
Anytime a survivor uses an escape cake one to two other survivors dc on loading screen making it a near impossible match.
---
&gt;Killers that aren't good enough to play Nurse rise up.  
---
FTFY bud. 
---
Link to the video!: https://youtu.be/lKwON5JcAv0
---
For survivor I would have Urban Evasion Botany Knowledge Dead Hard Adrenaline and self care as the one extra perk 
---
As killer I’d have my normal Build Ruin BBQ Enduring and Spirt Fury and id add and Thill of the hunt or Nurses Calling as the one added perk 
---
I think I'd stop playing Killer if I had to wait 2 minutes, instead of just dodging 2-3 4-stacks with medkits and toxic names.
---
Nah dude you gotta run calm sprirt. Don't wanna alert the B I R D S now do you?
---
It is most definitely not a huge advantage unless your against a trapper Freddy or any other low tier killer. 
---
I should bring up that every killer has over a 2 kill rate. This would include SWF groups so if killers are so hard done by SWF groups why exactly are they beating them more often than not? 
---
Your arguments are so flawed bro... rank doesn’t mean skill in DBD. For example I have over 3.5k hours in the game and have achieved rank 1 on both sides every reset until the last two. It’s simply time put into the game. 
---
You should also keep in mind that these 4 man swf that are actually winning most matches are not at all common to come across as most SWF groups aren’t tryharding every match. 
---
What makes him Canadian?
---
Oh no, the killer might try extra hard to kill me this time.
---
Your reply didn't answer my question.
---
Sorry. I'm on PC.
---
Nah I always try I’m just gonna play dummy you know proxy camp tunnel slug stuff I’d never do in normal games 
---
Dedicated servers coming soon!(:
---
IT IS REALLY AMAZING THAT TUNNELING IS A THING THAT PEOPLE GET PISSED OFF OVER. IMAGINE IF FOCUSING THE HEALER IN A HERO SHOOTER BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE IMPORTANT TO KILL WAS CONSIDERED A "DIRTY MOVE" BY THE COMMUNITY AND GOT YOU LABELED A TRYHARD PLAYER. FUCKING BAFFLING
---
Why are you saltmining here? I'm gonna move on, you do you, I guess.
---
Don't worry. Every time I decide to stop mid heal or mid repair, Mr. Skillcheck likes to appear suddenly and give me away.
---
Well looking almost invisible and having no terror radius is invisible enough to me.
---
I get you're being hyperbolic but I want clarification: doesn't Prove Thyself just negate the 10% repair speed decrease if multiple survivors are on a gen which was supposed to be in the game the whole time but wasn't?
---
did you clap?
---
Another JenDenise thread, wild
---
It’s footsteps for killers too. I cannot hear Freddy walking and that’s the only clue you have to his location (apart from grass moving). 
---
A lot of maps are ridiculous where you can’t see over the loops....audio is all you got! The survivors and killers are looping on pure guesswork.
---
Tunneling, also known as the law of the wild to go for the weakest link/prey? Sounds right.
---
I'm a combination of 2 and 3
---
some survivors think you want them to wiggle free
---
Because 4 survivors can overpower a killer and even more so when they can communicate and be toxic 
---
Nice, never ran up the ante before but if its confirmed I am tempted to now.
---
THANK YOU. LEGIT THE FIRST SENSIBLE PERSON ON THIS SUB REDDIT/GAME. 
---
Lucky for you it actually adds to the image
---
How often? How much are your fps fluctuating when it happens?
---
Run something to monitor everything 
---
( GPU &amp; CPU load and temps, memory and disk usage etc) and see if it gives a hint towards whats happening.
---
Which drivers? 
---
Leader no longer affects repair speed
---
I want to make sure we're cool. I don't want to end on these terms.
---
8 tokens and can't self care that's not a buff
---
I lost it when the other survivors appeared. I think this is what hell would be like for D'wight
---
I would like to be able to customize the death sound. "Fatality" or an off tune bugle playing taps would be awesome.
---
And then I've had multiple people tell me some variation of killers being mad at SWF because they hate people playing with their friends, which is just a laughable attempt at distraction from what everybody knows is the real issue: SWF commonly play on voice comms, which this game simply wasn't designed to have.
---
&gt;More maps would also mean more confusion for casual players to remember layouts and features of each and every one
---
I respect that you are causal player and it would confuse you.  That's really all I can say about that as I have no problems figuring that stuff out and simply cannot relate to that comment. I've never heard that request before on a MP game. Less maps. I can't imagine you'd do well playing COD, Battlefield or even Battlefront due to the overwhelming amount of maps to play. But to each his own. 
---
&gt;If they threw in like 10 new, uninspired, generic locations as maps, like graveyards, maybe a harbor, another forest, another street, I certainly would lose oversight.
---
What's there is uninspired. So I do see your point. Curtain Call looks like everything else with a small circus on one side and Legion is simply any other map with snow. The other maps are variations of maps. It's getting boring playing the same maps over and over again and back to back to back to back. 
---
Three days to get to rank 1?!
---
Also for 5,  disconnecting doesn’t mean you’re bad at the game lmao. There’s no way to die instantly.
---
r/okaybuddyentity
---
By chance did he change the in game icons? I know BHVR won’t ban you for it but if the EAC catches it, it’ll ban the player. 
---
I main because he’s fun, and before you use the your delusional card: you can’t tell me what I find fun. I find legion fun, I find some games fun and others not. You can’t tell me what I find fun. 
---
Killer player using Noed on Cannibal is such a glaring admission of mediocrity that it's actually funny
---
Lol youre in for a surprise if you go on the PTB.
---
Lol i made a post about corn fuck corn maps tbh
---
Using the Spirit's hairstyle to flatter her and convince her to kill your friend first
---
It helps with steady running
---
When you realize ormond can have infinites if you use balanced landing
---
Then I miss used the word casual. I just don't play enough to care about meta, strategies and such. I have my 300 hours on steam and definitely enjoy the game a lot. 
---
It might have been a Tithi video because I can't find it on Demis channel
---
Wait says who? IIRC on the PTB its still working that way. Did the devs say something?
---
I will shut that shit down! No exceptions!
---
I mean.... I guess you could do that 😄 
---
Nothing you can do besides wait. It’s most plausible he was banned for saying something in post chat that he shouldn’t have, but anything is possible. What system is he on?
---
😄 😄 😄
---
when you mention L3 are clicking it like a button or just pushing it?
---
What’s the ratio of Schrute bucks to Stanley nickels?
---
Pushing it
---
Didn’t even think of that holy shit the map is ass in so many ways it’s a big fuck you to killer but hey you will never be infinite looped if you can’t find the survivor after hitting them once considering scratch marks might as well not be a thing on the map

I love legion don't get me wrong, but I just had multiple people tell me that he's weak (keep in mind this is PTB here). I p3 main legion and I can easily tell you with confidence legion just hit S rank now. He doesn't have any counterplay and because of this, there really isn't anything you can do against him.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe making it so that he can't turn on missed attacks would be great but even then the no cooldown and long lunge is still very strong. We should also mention he can vault pallets that survivors stand directly in front of. Maybe somehow getting a way for survivors to block pallets (like they can against other suvivors) against legion would be wonderful, so he isn't vaulting every pallet in the game and killing survivors right away.
---
I don't know, his agility is too much while feral and finding every survivor is incredibly easy. Finding a nice balance between his power and it's side ability is going to be incredibly difficult since his power is broken but his side ability is almost never good.
---
Why wouldn't they wiggle? It's the only way for them to get off. I don't care if they wiggle off my back, the goal is to get them to the hatch, and splitting up finds it easier. 
---
This goes for both sides, both sides come up with some ridiculous rules for the other. Maybe just play the damn game and quit bitching. 
---
If you mean rank up (since bloodpoint can be use to both survivors and killer), wait until rank reset , it would be a bit easier.(for me anyways) 
---
Or for PC, wait for ptb, I found to be easier while ptb is active.
---
I hate flashlights from having played so much Killer, so I almost never touch them as Survivor.
---
Truely inspiring story, for me its a jake face on bubba. My cause is no were as noble as yours it was done with the intent of love that turned into begrudging anger. Jake was my first main. Leatherface was my first main (the first time I watched a fellow survivor being moried by bubba I was literally and figuratively "hooked". Thus began my side gig as a part time killer. The collection started off well enough, first weekend claudettes face was my first trophy quickly followed by meg. Then the pig came to xbox and poor bubba was left to collect dust, the days came and went and the p3 claudette meta became standard. Clown release, was left disappointed but enjoyed playing girthy killer. Bubba round 2, several months of searching before a wild dwight ever appeared even longer for the jake. Long story short jake was the last face obtained purely due to the lack of his use on xbox. It was to the point that I would purposely switch to leatherface if a jake joined my lobby. Sorry to all the jake players I tunneled but if you ever decide to attempt the task of gathering all the faces you too will do the same if your OCD is strong enough.
---
The wraith does the same with his feet,my question is though is how does he do it with those damn chicken legs of his.
---
People always talk about how much it sucks to play against SWF because they can plan and coordinate, but from personal experience I can tell you that we usually play much worse in SWF because we’re being idiots and laughing at each other instead of paying attention to any of the tasks we’re supposed to be doing.
---
It was quite clearly a sarcastic comment. Perhaps it is you that is, “dumb as fuck,” 
---
Holy shit you’re right 
---
yikes I’m a fake fan 😂 cause idk 
---
He only got a 2k, He was gen rushed while waiting for my team to come save me. Finally left and I was yoinked off hook.
---
Dead meat is great
---
Which is why I said he wasn’t applying pressure well. Seemingly he just went after the potatoes while allowing all gens to be completed without and contesting. 
---
I love it when people get shitty when they lose, it sustains me
---
Looks good to me...
---
This was their true intention. To get everyone on both sides to unite and agree on a cause. Bravo, BHVR. Bravo.
---
You betrayed me I watched like 10 vids
---
Me: It’s Haunted Ground!
---
My SWF teammates, every damn time: Out of the way bitch, 1,000 points!
---
I never claimed that I can say what people find fun. Your entire point is based off of something I never once insinuated or said. Quite the genius you are I suppose... 
---
Big brain dev moves
---
Apparently Survivors are now supposed to be mind readers?
---
The r button puts them down.
---
Lmao 
---
I used (with permission of course), u/Sprongo-‘s awesome pixel art as reference and Stitchfiddle to turn the pixel art into a cross stitch pattern. Unfortunately not all of the colors from the pixel art were available as thread colors, but he’s still cute! Thanks again u/Sprongo-!
---
Sure
---
I've never heard of a Killer coming up with rules for survivors
---
I do too. I’m thinking of doing a few videos where I just read out some of the shit people say after matches
---
Lol I am sorry, but now you can watch some tithi if you want :D
---
All it needs to do is give you better items out of chests.
---
Not cool. Not cool
---
You didn't misuse it at all. There are other games that I don't play a lot which I could care less about in this sense. There are 14 Killers and 14 survivors (15) w/ steam. That's a lot of choices, but the maps mostly look the same. 
---
I've been playing since it launched on consoles and just started using Meg. However I played backwater swap 5 times in a row yesterday. That's ridiculous. 
---
No offense, but why can't you buy it yourself?
---
He's on pc
---
Killer v killer game mode
---
Please be patient I have autism (literally)
---
It may be a Codename or next chapter name idk
---
Killer v killer game mode 
---
Okay we all know it’s the pig stop being funny 
---
Never heard of him but demi is one of my favorites
---
Leatherface is my main. I love him. He’s Top Tier IN MY HEART!!!!!
---
^Love ^ya ^bubba...
---
No worries. Are you a killer or survivor main? Who’s your favorite?
---
&gt; Regardless, thats my piece and I won't be replying to you anymore. 
---
Real resolute there, lol.
---
&gt;Bless you little keyboard warrior troll 
---
Says the guy who appeals to reddit to fight his fights...
---
&gt;Lastly, I didn't post their name. Nowhere in that thread is the name typed. Implied? Sure but not typed nor stated.
---
Again, the preteen shirking any responsibility.  Your little "hint" is no different than posting his name outright, especially considering according TO YOU it wasn't supposed to be hard to figure out.  How dense can one be?
---
&gt;"they did it so why can't I?"
---
This is bullshit.  You absolutely said, "well they do it on twitter and youtube anyway".  This is a childish mindset to justify your poor behavior.
---
Now keep parroting keyboard warrior and troll with absolutely no substance behind it, it suits you.
---
8=====0~~~~
---
Except what if it’s the only reliable perk you have? Then are you just supposed to throw it away giving yourself perks like monstrous shrine?
---
I really like the healing nerf. Survivors seem to work together a lot more, and I've always seen this as a team game so that's what I like. Everyone being weak but working together to overcome the killer.
---
I mean you only have 2 health states so healing one should be a big deal. 12 seconds in retrospect isn't enough. Getting hit before the nerf wasn't a big deal for many timewise, now they think twice.
---
You say sloppy butcher went from a C tier to an S tier perk was wild, but what about self-care going from an S tier to an A/B tier? Theres that site that lets people rate all the perks, self-care for years was the only perk rated S tier for survivors. Everybody took it, it was the single most powerful survivor perk you could have. It really needed the nerf. With the healing changes they did manage to nerf self-care without touching it.
---
The game was designed around either being healed by someone else or by using a med kit. In that regard having the ability to self-heal is incredibly powerful so a 50% reduction in speed is understandable. Its not something you'll use all the time but its there if you need it. Its slow just like sabotage, but nobody attempts sabotage without a toolbox, so perhaps they should use a med kit for healing and have SC as a back up.
---
If they need to chanhe the healing times they could go half way. 14 seconds. SC would be 28.
---
Or perhaps with your idea, 65% healing speed, but you get healed by others at 85% or something. I think we can both agree that 75% was too much, its also stupid not being able to heal others as fast, why should they suffer due to your self-care?
---
You do you boo, do me a favor and apply this to the one's who use a coldwind offering as well 👍
---
I reccomend starting with the try not to laugh one
---
That was a different person, I just checked I’m sorry lol
---
If your talking about “Kenya” they use names like those as a sort of code name for chapters, Kenya was assigned to darkness among us
---
Wow, this is great! Great job, both of you!
---
Me in the swamp map
---
I rathee dip then to be toxic 
---
\#pussy
---
I don’t care about cold wind it’s not that bad of a map at least the scratch marks don’t fucking disappear and there’s not an ass building you can loop the killer around yeah 
---
nice ahegao
---
Ok, that doesn't change the fact that the goal is getting them to the hatch. Wether I drop them myself, or they wiggle off, it shouldn't matter.
---
Most of the community wants NOED and DS gone but here we are...
---
I had a game once where I got literally a single hit off on a survivor the entire match because corn.
---
It was an interesting stream which got real cringy. Paulie going off was the highlight of the entire thing.   Loved it.
---
Oh my idea was 65% for self care and 100% for healing others.
---
Also self care didn’t become any less necessary because it wasn’t directly nerfed, and it also can’t be replaced by other perks (besides maybe bond). Sloppy butcher was directly buffed because the mangled effect was buffed.
---
What if Legion could only do the fast vault when they are in Killer instinct? That would allow counterplay at pallets and windows without hurting their ability to chain stabs.
---
I report wraiths that run Sloppy Butcher currently, it's not like they don't know that this happens.
---
Information is the game changer here. Where the generators are, where you friends are so that you can get healed faster, where the killer is and what killer they are, that's all information you're not going to have as a solo survivor. Once you get past the base mechanics of the game, which are very simple, that information is all that's left, and SWF removes it as a mechanic. All of the difficulty of decision making is gone. Not a huge advantage? You're still out of your mind.
---
As for the kill rate, I've seen the thread. It's imperfect information at best. Half of em could be rank 20s. I don't know. And as much as rank 1 isn't the ultimate indicator of skill, you're not going to sit back and tell me those number mean half as much if ANY significant number of these SWF groups are well below 10. What the hell does kill rate mean when even a Freddy can stomp down there? Not a damn thing. 
---
The pussy thing to do would be to leave soooooooooo yeah still gonna do it but hey I guess not liking playing against survivors who exploit the clearly broken map is wrong hmm who would have guessed ;) 
---
Which, again, separating SWF from solo would eliminate most of the toxicity in this game. They are the root of all evil in DBD. 
---
You don’t have to be toxic? Just play with strong addons. That’s not toxic. 
---
Without dedicated servers the game uses the killers internet if the survivor lives on the other side of the world the connection will be bad and the game would suck hence dodging
---
What they definitely need to do is improve the shuffling. We had 4 out of 6 games coldwind just today, it's really annoying. 
---
Rank "doesn't matter" is a fallacy. It does matter, but there are a lot of survivors that play enough, and are good enough, to make rank 1,but they can't handle the good killers. 
---
Sorry I thought you were talking about being a killer 
---
Oh well thanks for the warming it is quite cold on that map
---
How about I run Wraith with Sloppy hmmmm that would be a good idea I’ve seen survivors Bitching and screaming about that so yeah maybe that ;)
---
I love coldwind farm maps. I remember back then when it was increased in the map pool. 
---
Just don’t burn the offering and make sure the other survivors don’t I won’t play like that if I get the map randomly 
---
so if he is using frank's mixtape you lose 5s of bleeding (10 vs 15) compared to having to sit 30s + healing (and h'es gonna tunnel you if he is using that).
---
if he is not using add-on you lose 10s : 2 cases
---
he is chasing you moonwalking you lost 10s before being downed.
---
He chase other survivor/ actually chase : doesn't really change anything your gonna heal to full when he loose you.
---
I still won't spend 30+s to heal to Maybe win 10 at best.
---
Oh I definitely won’t burn mount orland offerings anymore but I’ll still use the mount ormond offerings
---
Oh i didn't know, thx
---
Shameless
---
PTB is 2 hits to down you. I dont know what all this math you're doing is for.
---
I've seen it in game
---
Uhm nope if it is removed I will stop playing. I only play with my wife and son. 
---
It's not sloppy butcher alone that does it, it's combining it with the blind warrior-white add on.
---
I didn’t consider that. But as survivor if you’re the last one alive, you don’t run a 35% ds, there’s basically no chance they’ll mess up and not get you to a hook if they’re competent enough to get a 4K in the first place. So I figure it’s futile
---
Titty streamer or bust
---
I actually like coldwind farm....... Its kinda fun not being able to see the killer and not being sure if the killer can see you (i havent gotten around to playing killer often) It adds to the suspense
---
Lmao..with asthmatic swagger
---
Schedule?
---
Not saying its that bad (fuck corn) but ever since the last 2xbp event that offering is being burned like its going out of style (xbox).
---
Wraith has an add on that inflicts mangled and hemorrhage on hit, just like sloppy butcher. Running both of the together causes the bug.
---
I wonder who was nice enough to give you one? JK, glad you are still rocking it.
---
No problem
---
Survivor:
---
Dead Hard. 
---
Sprint Burst. 
---
Self Care. 
---
Adrenaline. 
---
Killer:
---
A Nurses Calling. 
---
BBQ and Chili. 
---
Hex: Ruin. 
---
r/subsireallywantedtoexist
---
Perks depend on what Killer you play, however the few "standard" perks which are good on all Killers are BBq &amp; Chili which is from Leatherface and Hex: Ruin which is from the Hag. As Survivor Self Care is nearly a must have but if the changes from the test build come in than I wouldn't want to use it, you heal yourself quicker than before but the downside is that you heal other survivors slower
---
God tier Perk, honestly now I think it’s one of the best
---
Guess they didn't know what a hook grab was
---
Just look on this subreddit. Killers are.always making up rules. Survivor's cannot loop, 'gen rusb' whatever the frak that means. Cannot flashlight blind, cannot escape the hatch when they are the last one alive, cannot escape with a key. Should leave right away. And countless other made up 'rules'. 
---
Yeah in the stream today they stated that they will not implement that change or the self care change.
---
I’m a Billy main so I thrive in the farm maps
---
I don't get to play all the time but wasn't the corn easier to see through back then like am I just going crazy or is corn and weeds harder to see through as killer now?
---
?? If your trying to be clever then your faking pretty hard 
---
Very cool.
---
They now think huntress is OP
---
EVERYONE. I love people like this. 
---
I suggest just reward them for using the power correctly and punish them for using it to tunnel people or if they miss.
---
Every person you hit should either slow down your frenzy drain or speed up your movement to encourage you to tag multiple people and not go for one person so you can also go further distances as well.
---
Every missed strike should drain like 5% of the frenzy, so you don't have legions able to whiff 5 attacks before still being able to successfully heal you.
---
when you hit someone with frenzy and they are already deep wounded, the stun should last longer and also blur your vision a tad more, so that the survivor has a chance to counterplay with either getting a decent amount of distance or breaking LoS to hide.
---
the more people you inflict deep wounds on with a single Feral Frenzy should reduce the stun you receive afterwords to allow for an easier followup on a chase to someone once you exit the frenzy.
---
This is to help reward Legion for tagging multiple survivors allowing the power to grow stronger as you chain hits and lower the fatigue of getting out and punish Legion's who tunnel/miss with longer fatigue and a shorter duration of power.
---
Maybe not all these ideas at once but I think it's a start
---
Dead by hitboxes
---
I’m actually a survivor main so for that reason I love Coldwind Farm so I’ll say it’s more of a love/hate relationship, because I agree it adds some suspense bc you’re not quite sure if you’ve been spotted (hence from the Killer POV where you’ve been “spotted” but the killer has no idea wtf is going on 😂)
---
They will learn to fear the Butt-Shark!
---
The same as the ratio of unicorns to leprechauns!
---
floor ornaments are the scariest, although heating up the exit door handles is probably the best idea!
---
The way you made Dwight's mouth move was like South Parks' Canadians.
---
You either skate fast eat %@$!@ or stay safe and look both ways kiddo
---
you have to use the mouse to look behind. 
---
I hate teabaggers 99% of the time... but a few days ago I went against a leatherface who chased me for 4 gens, camped me, then tunneled me again. He only went after somebody else after losing me in the last minute. You bet your fucking ass I spammed crouch at the exit. 
---
Gender fluid probably. 
---
Everyone ask "did you clap?", No one ask "How you clap?".
---
Sweet! Time to plunder them juicy chests :D 
---
Safe or dangerous, fast or cautious, your choice
---
Why leave that’s what they want, go after the other three. 
---
At this point it’s so common I feel like it’s a secret built in leatherface perk to always have no-ed. 
---
Yup you’ll go sloppy and then lose. It doesn’t sound like a problem to me
---
We're not going to be happy if you keep spamming this... Please try uploading clips...
---
I wish, I’m ass as killer. To be fair though I am on console lol
---
Dude. Wtf. 
---
I wish he was fully invisible but to compensate maybe make his footsteps louder or something. 
---
I used Mematic for it. First you pick the style of the meme and then it takes you to the second step. Here I’m able to select VIDEO. 
---
I’m on iOS though
---
No, stop spamming this shit on here. 
---
I de rank sometimes, rank 1 survivors no matter how hard I stomp or get stomped are just toxic.
---
Had a doctor 4K earlier 
---
But you know... 
---
It’s like nonething but ds, adrenaline, borrowed time, and etc as far as the eye can see

If it's the cooperative action one you should just trash it and get a new one. 
---
Nah I win on Wraith without sloppy and the fact that sloppy kills every survivors framerate yeah it’s not gonna be nice for survivors 
---
Yes
---
ALL I WANNA DO IS BRING IN FUN BUILDS AND PLAY IN AN INTERESTING WAY THAT ISNT TRYHARDING BUT IT FEELS LIKE EVERY GAME I MAKE A FUN BUILD INSTEAD OF RUNNING ENDURING AND SPIRIT FURY, 2-4 OF THE FUCKING SURVIVORS HAVE DECISIVE STRIKE. 
---
Congrats and welcome to Hell my friend :) 
---
Which is nuts because the goddamn icon pops up WHEN OPENING A CHEST!!!
---
When you play at rank 20 I guess anything works
---
lmfaooooo “spammed crouch” . welcome to the club 💀
---
I didn’t even pip because he was on my ass so long I got 0 altruism and objective 
---
It's kinda weird that vaulting doesn't drop his frenzy gauge at all, most of all. It should cost. 
---
Self promoting scum.
---
Well if you weren't ass, you wouldn't be butt, so good job!
---
Only plunderers does that, but its not the normal "Luck" stat
---
Oh boy. Reminds me of the monto leatherface thing that happened recently Lol
---
YOU COMPLETELY MISSED THE TOPIC OF THE POST
---
Fixing the chessing will make him more bearable, but it's not even a band aid fix, because it leaves his main problem p much unchanged: his core design.
---
Missed attacks need to decrease a little of the meter and slow turn speed when using frenzy. Also Franks Mixtape can be swapped in rarity with Fuming Mixtape. 
---
No worries man
---
Wow petty insults now hmmmm I just asked in a asshole tone yes for survivors not to use a offering to a broken map that’s unfair for killers and survivors can’t seem to function with that idea but hey they are allowed to scream and cry about Sloppy Wraith (for good reason) but hey killers problems don’t matter right? Because who gives a shot about legitimate complaints about the game if they come from killers they are just salty killer mains right ;) 
---
See that’s the thing that annoys me . Dbd expects you to save each person and get chased and do obj , so even if you get someone off the hook everyone else loses a lil percentage for not saving ... I think right ?
---
hasn't happened to me but I've only gotten the chance to play against Legion and mend like twice... That's a weird hack/bug...
---
We could have started the generator next to us at the beginning of the clip
---
I think at the beginning of the game all gens are yellow if one is touched it turns to red so you know exactly which gens ate being works on. If you kick a gen it turns white for 16 seconds then back to yellow until it's worked on again. It's a great tracking perk. I might have forgotten something
---
Now that's using your head 😂 thanks
---
We could have started the generator next to us at the beginning of the clip, but I was enraptured by this new technique my fellow survivor was displaying.
---
New Xorcist girl killa confirmt!
---
I think it’s more like if they die you lose percentage? But yeah, if you have no chances to be altruistic the game punishes you.

---
Looks like the devs have installed RGB campfires
---
This is why I stopped using offerings lately because it makes this decision easier. Just run WGLF to make up for no offerings.
---
Didn´t even think of him, damn that´d be dope
---
He's following his mentor, Herobrine. 
---
Probably phosphorous...
---
Yeah, I run it regardless. It’s ALWAYS when I run BPS or Escape Cake that I go against a tunneling legion, though.
---
Well, he has the upper body strenght, so when he kicks it he transfer the strenght of her upper body to his legs
---
did you throw a purple offering in?
---
Seeing as any level headed survivor doesn’t get scared not knowing the killers location, among other things, it’s nothing more than a minor assistance at best. The strongest part of SWF is how they can work around whatever perks each survivor brings. This is without a doubt an advantage but most definitely not a huge advantage. 
---
They have separate numbers for each colour of rank... are you sure you’ve seen the thread? 
---
Actually we have no way of knowing what rank most SWF players are. You have to remember a lot of the better players in this game derank for easier games and whatnot so it’s possible most decent SWF are actually in the mid to low ranks. We have no real way of knowing as stats for this have not once been released.
---
I need a huntress hit or mis for....
---
***purposes***
---
Eh, I do that anyways. Not doing much.
---
Sorry, I forgot to reply to this. It wasn't so much your post that was gross as much as the people arguing with me who seemed to want nothing else from the game.
---
Can't argue that,he did rip a man's spine and skull out
---
Predator wraith skin when Behavior?
---
I'll always advocate for Save the Best for Last, especially if the killer you want to play only has an M1 hit ability.
---
I didn't even realise that, that's hilarious.
---
I'd say you could derank naturally by playing Speed Limiter Leatherface but you're immune to that, aren't you HTML. Love the content, keep it up.
---
David's dead!!!!
---
Or maybe some people just want to play on a new map since most of the maps have been around for years?  
---
If you can use windows and pallets well enough they will not get a hit on you before their noed gets clensed. 
---
Legion will vault the pallets and windows and hit you regardless.
---
In a game where rank doesn't ultimately mean anything and isn't exactly competitive I don't think deranking is a bad thing.
---
The Devs themselves have stated that not every killer is viable at rank 1 and so if you main one of those killers and manage to get up there you'll essentially be at a disadvantage just because you play a character you enjoy and frankly that's stupid.
---
If you're not enjoying playing the game at a high rank, what's the point in playing the game at that rank? 
---
Now, I don't deliberately throw games or DC but I do take breaks from playing killer that often last over a month just so that rank reset keeps me around ranks 9 through 12 where I feel most comfortable playing the game whilst killing. I don't mind playing at high ranks as a survivor though.
---
What about the Ultra? 
---
What about popping into Frenzy with no charge for a quick break? This would actually make Legion stronger. You frenzy so you don't have to worry about pallets. This just means there's no way to juke anymore.
---
Thank you for blessing us
---
Yes.
---
Great ty
---
Lol I play killer and survivor so don’t give me that bs, I’ve been playing Spirit without being able to hear footsteps for awhile now so I get being upset about the game but I’m not gonna be a little kid and go out of my way to try and ruin the experience for other people because of shit the devs did. Here’s the thing, a majority of survivors don’t know about these issues. They don’t know about how the killer can’t hear footsteps or how mount ormond is with scratch marks. They just play the game and I don’t understand how you can fault them for that. This post literally screams salty killer main and that’s why the point got disregarded.
---
I think the point is that he has no heart beat, but he is completely invisible after standing still
---
Good job!  :)
---
But what happens when you have to chose between saving your wife or your son THE GAME BEGINS!
---
He’s just so bad that I think it’s kinda fair. Him, Freddy, and kinda Pig shouldn’t be judged for NOED like Billy and Myers should. 
---
I think it is because of valve. I'm pretty sure I read that some where
---
Never understood camping. You barely get blood points 
---
What's PTB?
---
Then play Clown instead.
---
But when I do my character starts to turn that way... so when I go to looks behind to I have to then press s to keep moving forward?? Keep swapping between W and S?
---
I love his channel! Such a fun dude
---
I save my wife of course!!!!
---
Daddy Spirit 
---
I CANT GET DEEP WOUND TO WORK IT ENDS BUT IT DOSNT DOWN THEM
---
Wtf that's amazing lol. That's like a top 5 perk no contest
---
Its only if i play swf with my 1 friend, if i play killer or solo survivor its near instant
---
For others wondering if this works on console, it does.
---
5% wouldn't really be worth it, maybe 25% with increases or decreases depending on addon. 
---
I'll updoot for Archer cuz it's lovely, but I think getting off the hook and a free head-start woulda been nice (altho no killer I played with ever let me/others have that), I think with Deliverance the killer can't know it was actually a (based) 4% anymore anyways... 
---
[P.S. - that is probably the only instance of actually properly using that term]
---
Wasn't Jeepers Creepers supposedly hinted at sometime back with the whole "Every 23 years" comment?
---
Wow! 400k...  
---
“Baby killer needs to mori, gg ezzzzz”
---
That’s good to know. My bf and I play on ps4 normally but we share the same account, so we don’t want to pay two separate subscriptions for PS Plus just to play together 
---
HAHAHAHAHA! I LOVE IT! That's hilarious. :D
---
Exactly this and it's faster to find hatch on the shoulder too, plus they don't have to mind read to realise that they're done for and if they want a chance to live they should give up 
---
Real talk, after running calm spirit for a while, I've realized how loud and obnoxious crows are. And since spies is getting buffed, might be a solid pick now.
---
Thought it was potassium chloride?
---
Billy just got a skin.
---
&gt;And all but the Hallowed Blight skin are awful.
---
That's 100% subjective, just because you only like the Blight skin doesn't mean everyone thinks that way. I for one enjoy many of his skins.
---
No, no you are not. I’m fairly certain you must be aware of this as this is among the most posted things on this sub.
---
But they made Leader not work on gens
---
She phases from her side of the window to the survivor side, but for her it just looks like she climbs through it, so a killer main who rarely/never plays survivor wouldn’t realize it.
---
actually the first time i Heard legion's concept i thought it would be an insider
---
You right: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX2v-Oac5yk&amp;t=1m23s (purple flame vid)
---
I was like which of the Ps is it..., but phosphorous is just the white.
---
I see quite a few hags tbh.
---
There’s some exaggeration going on here
---
When you’re moving around the map, look for pallets and make a mental note. Urban evasion is good but crouching around the map the whole time hurts your team. Keep an eye on the killer when vaulting/looping pallets and NEVER EVER heal in the basement. And if it’s end game against leatherface and he’s got someone in basement, don’t even think about it. That bitch is dead lol. I won’t recommend perks because you need to figure out your playstyle and use the perks that fit for you. 
---
I'm also talking about flashlights. I'm not talking about picking someone up, I'm talking about when you break the pallet. There's no dodging a flashlight during the break animation.
---
[removed]
---
With stab wound study and frank's mixtape you go down in 2 hits. 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/PlainResilientPeachPartyTime
---
Oh goodness 
---
A good killer with a more original power. The last few have had technically different powers, but all with some sort of likeness to a previous killer IMO. Like, how Spirit Fury was immediately followed by Frenzy. The last few killers have just felt creative, but unoriginal. I want a killer with a brand new power, unlike anything we’ve had before. It’s no easy task, though. Also, if a killer could come out already balanced, that’d be nice. We need another Huntress, so to speak. 
---
Myers trying to stalk in the corn stalks lol
---
Just Frank's mixtape isn't a two hit down, but with stab wound study and frank's mixtape it is two hit down.
---
Oh Jesus 
---
Or should I say
---
Oh Jeff 
---
Are you in the US? When I play on PS4 in the US it usually takes me a minute maybe.
---
Hmm, so when the match starts the gens aren't highlighted or anything?
---
So why attack me for telling people about the issues 
---
How is it fixed?
---
They can still moonwalk you, they can hold W while vaulting a window/pallet.
---
Im pretty sure the change in the PTB was if youre injured you only need 2 hits with frenzy to down to incentivize players to heal to full.
---
Bring beer in a cereal bowl, they'll never expect it.  
---
  
---
Then you can drink at work!  
---
Then your performance can go down.  
---
Then you will lose your job...  
---
Then, just as you are about to hit the ground after jumping off a building, the Entity brings you in his world.  
---
New Killer coming soon confirmed!
---
Even as an ultra rare it's not something that should stay in the game.
---
That wouldn't give a perma ban.
---
Would be a soft ban at max. 
---
Perma bans are mostly for savegame editing or other ways to cheat progress. 
---
If you keep in mind that there's no public EAC bypass rn it's easy to get banned.
---
DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!
---
Yeah just ignore the issue and take it up the ass without saying anything about it :D
---
Yay science!
---
Lol other than Jeff being way off...these are pretty funny. 
---
I was going to say the same for Quentin, until I realized if you stare for a second his one eye is just a liiiiiitle bit crooked, giving him a strung out excited junkie look...and i lold
---
I found a few posts of it since December, it's a pretty unfortunate bug/hack but yeah I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/39250/unable-to-mend-vs-legion
---
Part of that is his ultra rare.
---
 I derank as survivor to greens to get games easier but leave my killer in the reds because I like the challenge and have no issues finding games.
---
Scary is a survivor dropping a pallet on you when you didn't even know they existed.
---
factssss ! especially the shards . Or even clothes I’m fine with both 
---
I know what that’s why when I play solo queue and I face wraith I don’t save anyone unless I see the wraith chasing someone or somebody else gets injured. Other than that I’m a gen warrior that match until one gen 1 is left then I’m hunting totems because you know damn well he has NOED
---
False, it’s just as easy to look behind you on console as it is on PC. I got pretty triggered seeing OP run around the whole game without lookin back at the killer once. 
---
Do you mean their power? That's already the case, they can only do a fast vault when using their power.
---
It’s prob on crack
---
I was expecting NOED haha. 
---
i love all cold wind maps except rotten fields. 
---
I wanted to find that scene from Star Trek where Kirk fights the Gorn and Spock says, "Recall your basic chemistry, doctor." But I can't find it so I'll just 2nd, yay, science! Thanks for finding the true culprit behind this mystery!
---
Damn the hunt for that totem must’ve been so exhausting for you
---
Sure thing, just don't be suprised when eventually you will recieve the same treatment you are doing to others. 
---
Lmaoo, absolutely worst map for nurse.
---
Exactly I really like to stay between ranks 8-12 . If I get too high I sacrifice my self for team 😂 
---
We need mike. Probably would get Sam but mikes the real badass. I want him missing those fingers too. 
---
Me asf last week 😂 twice !
---
I don’t blame you haha. 
---
I get these type of people I mean the winter event ended pretty recently I’m sure there’s many more moris to go around 
---
"GET OVER HERE!" - Scorpion to an inattentive waiter
---
Another day, and another fucking idiot reveals themselves on r/deadbydaylight.
---
 
---
Thank you! I'll go look now!
---
Someone who throws quarter sticks of dynamite that you can also plant on the ground as time bombs, but make it so the blast radius is small. Basically an explosive huntress with a temp land mine ability
---
He's not saying all Survivors, probably not even most of them. To be fair, I've had people at Rank 2 and 1 say basically the same thing above. However, to be doubly fair, those sorts of interactions are the ones I remember more than the survs who just said "gg" in chat. Negativity bias and all that.
---
TIS BUT A JOKE 
---
Two of them had insta heals and all had decisive, but okay, I’m the bad guy
---
Adrenaline ticks me off so much.  In normal matches, it's never a problem and when it works, it's clutch.  In SWF?  Na, bro.  Seeing SWF squads pull off adrenaline plays with a well timed gen pop is bullshit and another testament to the power of SWF.
---
And insulted right off the bat nice forgot this was dead by daylight we were talking about
---
I thought they quit cuz they suddenly realized they were playing Legion.
---
But it *is* often the most practical thing to do unless you're already doing something else at the moment the unhook happens.
---
(It's a joke, please don't hurt me...)
---
So basically....they’re bad, heard ya loud and clear
---
Do you play on ps4 by any chance?
---
you're not wrong, can confirm that definitely wasnt the case though. see that nice perk i have called devour soap, it had 4 stacks real quick. :D
---
Right, because I don’t currently deal with flashlight flickers, teabaggers, “adrenaline, dead hard, self care, deliverance” every game at this point
---
Honestly ya can’t blame em. Moris are pretty fucking op especially the ebony. (BHVR please remove I’m begging you)
---
Traitorous birbs probably Upped him cuz he used the stale bread offering...
---
I'm confused...what exactly does the description for Prove Thyself mean, regarding the "one effect at a time"? And why do people dislike the new hook spawn rates?
---
In a normal game with no SWF?  It's clutch and worthy of a "well, damn.".  In SWF?  Hair pulling rage as it's almost always timed to proc in the worst (for you) possible way.
---
This is the most confusing post I have ever read
---
*object of obsession teabagging in the distance. 
---
There is actually a dangly tusk attached to boots and on her chest I think I missed to add it here.
---
Dev's have already said they don't wanna make console exclusive characters.
---
Oh I'm sorry. I thought that's what you wanted? I mean, that's the only reason I would make a stupid fucking post telling people I'm going to play like a scumbag.
---
Everyone trashes on Leatherface but he's pretty good. I have no problem 4king with him. Although I'm only rank 10 at killer. 
---
Such a helpful hardware store...
---
‘Tis but a joke my good sir 
---
This is a straight up buff to DS lol
---
"Rank doesn't matter"
---
Proceeds to shit on low rank.
---
Some backstory: I was using Legion. Two of them had insta heals. All were running decisive tier 3. The rest of their perks consisted of either dead hard, urban evasion, balanced landing and sprint burst. 
---
I disrespect kobes all the time.  Got told off recently for "being an asshole by waiting for the attempted kobe".  I'm not gonna have a 4K slip away because of a kobe.  Screw that.
---
Way more op than ds
---
Nah, only PC
---
Why do ya ask?
---
I believe with nurse you can actually get them
---
My only real guess is he like dh’d onto the killers head or some shit lol
---
Well although I have acknowledged if I missed the joke then maybe I am the fucking idiot, I must be honest and say that I'm struggling to see you are actually joking from all your comments which seem to imply you do genuinely intend to play like a scumbag? (In which case my original 'fucking idiot' post must stand)
---
Just git gud. It’s a beautiful map. I wanna play it so I can look at it. 
---
I hate how Wraith can just stop the chase from procing even though he's clearly following you. It's an issue for stuff like this, stops Lithe from procing, and just robs people of their chase points in general.
---
Git Gus the balled of the survivors any killer has any problem big or small “git gud” the survivors chant as they ignore every single problem a killer has because who gives a shit about killers right? 
---
Lol
---
Actually most you've suggested has been said several times before. But the devs don't seem to like the idea of buffing totems. Lemme tell you why:
---
Consider the "good" hexes, being Hex: Ruin, Hex: Devour Hope, Hex: No One Escapes Death, Hex: Huntress Lullaby, Hex: Haunted Ground. 
---
Ruin: You can "tap" through it or git gud and land great skill checks, hex is "balanced" because of the time it makes people waste, even finding the totem requires time already. It really punishes those who cannot land great skill checks consistently and tapping is not as fast.
---
DH: Hex is really powerful, but it doesn't start giving you any advantage. Survivors can cleanse it before it becomes a problem. That's the only reason it's balanced. Survivors don't have a reason to search for it so that gives you chances of it not being cleansed. The ability to insta down with M1 already is too good, then think about mori people you didn't even hook.
---
NOED: The only way to counter it is cleansing all totems, and if you are not playing SWF it's hard to tell if this was achieved. Normally you can counter it but letting 1 totem not cleansed closeby. The power this gives is enormous, remember this **used to not be a hex**.
---
Lullaby: This hex with 4-5 tokens is as good or even better than ruin, and there are perks that compliment very well with lullaby, making it the best for slowing down progress. It's worse only because you are required to hook people for it to grow strong, that requires time, which translates into gens done, so you follow me. It's "balanced" because some most survivors won't search like crazy for it when the game started, they believe they can outplay the hex if things go wrong.
---
Haunted Ground: this hex was thought to counter the fact that totems are easy to find and cleanse, it gives you insta down with M1 for 1 minute, it has the potential of proccing on a very convenient time or a very bad one and it can only proc once. That is why the perk is balance.
---
So if you analyse it properly you will find that hexes are already a way to put overpowered abilities in the game but be able to control them. The example of NOED is perfect, because it was too strong and they just made it a hex as a way to nerf it. So if hexes represent a nerf to overpowered abilities, there's no logical reason to buff them. Yeah, they were lazy to do something about random spawns, but since Haunted Ground exists there's no point on that. Why would anyone hide this totem? Why would a totem be straight up on the open? "It's HG". It's really easy to know which hexes killer has rather than NOED.
---
I hate when I want to give the last Survivor hatch but they waste ten minutes of my time urbaning around in the bushes. By the time I find them, I’m so annoyed that I just hook them on sight.
---
Oh, thank you

Killers have been constantly getting buffed. If it’s really an issue then stop playing killer. The map is a part of the game. Learn how to play around it. I’ve went up against plenty of killers who haven’t had an issue on that map against me and vice versa. 
---
You can’t just get good with this map have you seen the scratch marks on this map they are legit impossible to track if a survivor rounds a corner for a second safe to say there will be close to no scratch marks left and the survivor will be gone also I can win on the map I got a 4 man my second time playing Spirit once they fix the map then okay play it all you want also we aren’t gonna talk about the broken middle building 
---
It was ruin.
---
no, he is just bad at the game. I do just fine as wraith without camping and tunneling 
---
Yeah right 
---
Again a joke but hey guess im an idiot 
---
I'm saying you should hate people who play like that not Wraith because he's someone that has good speed for map control, unless the player isn't very good.
---
They’re a part of the game. Just because you don’t like something doesn’t make it toxic. Toxic is messaging people post game and being rude. Using the perks and add-ons in the game is literally just playing the game. 
---
shame, would have made a better story.
---
that is right it only activities when you kick the gen 
---
Soo they should just not fix the scratch mark issue that literally everyone has talked about and oh wow killers have been getting buffs oh wow and again I can function on the fucking map but this is the problem no matter what killers have a problem survivors will aways without a doubt write of their complaints is it so hard to ask that the scratch marks get fixed in that map 
---
We'll make it is the cap
---
haha, yes a real Sophie's Choice in no good, not funny.
---
wow I see you like dank memes
---
I don’t use or do any of those things except play legion hold your horses lol
---
Also have you seen the new bug with the Wraith and sloppy butcher what if I were to say git gud and play around it yeah that wouldn’t make much sense right because it’s clearly unfair and gives and unfair advantage to the killer but survivors can still win against so does that mean we should just ignore it 
---
I never once said it shouldn’t get fixed. It’s a bug, yeah it should be fixed. I think you need to relax a little. Quit stereotyping survivors. 
---
Playable test build/beta  it’s where all the changes and killers go before they go live
---
I do not understand how they got blocked either you can not block survivors in when stalking
---
Lol sure.
---
December 13th was the latest developer stream where they posted their graphs, none of which have anything to do with SWF whatsoever.  
---
"Most" was your word, not mine. And reasonable implies that your statement about the 'majority of survivors' do, in fact play SWF, and I can't even begin to guess how you figured that out. I'm done, friend. Have a nice one.
---
Gotta secure that kill!!! 
---
It’s quite common for survivors to come back and save a hooked person so you’re only fucking yourself over by facecamping. 
---
The killer could have downed my friends or put pressure on and forced them out but he chose the cheap and easy way. 
---
We still won. All 4 of us. 
---
So camp me if you want i’ll just put on Spotify and wait til the next game. (: 
---
no. I was just scrolling r/dankmemes yesterday and thinking when the Mafia meme will appear here :D as in when it's already dead or still relevant
---
Even if you don't unhook yourself, the person that unhooked you *made their choice* and the hook will be their new home :)
---
Bullshit, wraits movement speed is great while cloaked. You have great map presence and can kills without camping, easily.
---
I think clowns gas made you hallucinate.
---
Procing, getting something to proc. "**Proc** is a common term used primarily in game programming to refer to an event - a "procedure" - triggered under particular circumstances."
---
I mean NOED its the only way you can secure kills when the gates are open against good players 
---
how can you bodyblock while stalking?
---
It's my faves of the old Star Treks and one of the killer/survivor combo crossovers I wish they had (The Gorn is also my steam name)! I watched with my older bro! 
---
There are of course a lot of clips of what is called the "worst fight ever" etc. : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SK0cUNMnMM 
---
but hard to find one of them talking about the black powder ingredient gathering...
---
They made a reunion type commercial but they keep changing the look of the gorn over the years which is lame/FOOLISH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hnBp7x2QAE

I main both.

*gasp*

I'm not [**META**](/intensifies)
---
He needs a buff outside of his power and a nerf towards his power. He's so reliant on it, it pretty sad. 
---
Nurse is similar but it's because her power is so fucking strong, that her base self slower than any other killer and using her power gives a penalty (fatigue).
---
It's so weird because everything about Legion's power is so fucking strong. Vaulting pallets/windows, no cooldown for missing a hit, or even hitting someone, increase movement speed, and a recharge if he hits someone not in bleedout. But the part that makes it suck is the **Lethality** of it. It takes forever to down someone.
---
Can you imagine if Nurse or Huntress were like that? When you get a hit with your power, you have to hit them 3 more times or once without your power? That would really suck and make them waste so much time (which is what Legion also suffers with, he's spending so much time trying to down 1 person that gens are getting done) not to mention that the survivors get a speed boost everytime they're hit and you have 110 movement speed (or less if you're the nurse) out of your power.
---
Simply just buff the lethality so it's not shitty to play the Legion and nerf and add drawbacks to the power, while also adding counter play. 
---
If it were up to me, with his base kit (No add ons) make it 2 hits to down someone, (1 hit to apply deep wound, 2 hits to down) but only give them a speed boost on application of deep wound, (or keep speed boost on all hits but give him 115 Movement speed)
---
Make it so that being in his terror radius doesn't decrease deep wound time, and make it so that everytime he vaults a pallet he looses like 10% of his FF meter and missing a hit takes away 5% of his meter.
---
it adds counterplay, makes it so that his power takes skill, penalizes Legion for missing or not using his power wisely, makes it so that everyone can't cheese, makes it so that deep wounds is actually a threat instead of a joke. Then just change Stab Wounds Study and Franks all together.
---
I'm not going to lie. It's happened ***once***
---
please tell that to the wraiths im going up against bc thats all theyre doing in my games
---
for real chucky could be a lot of fun.  his power could be in his  tiny size making it easy for him to sneak up on people.
---
Its because people help justify their arguments with their rank as if just because they’re a rank 1 whatever they’re magically an expert on whatever they’re talking about. Only issue is I can literally go from rank 20 to rank 1 in a single day, or drop from rank 1 to rank 15 in a couple hours. You’re right but it does go the other way around where people invalidate your opinion because you aren’t rank 1, and people often drop rank in the game because they’re too scared to play at a high rank. 
---
IFrames on unhook actually made Wraith horrible to camp as now. Borrowed is just so common that I don't think a lot of people realize that yet.
---
But as the unhooker, you get the unhook without fear of a grab if he's uncloaking. Then you get to bodyblock and trade hooks if desired.
---
Problem is most altruistic survivors don't play efficiently, they just farm that unhook and let Borrowed ensure that it counts as a safe one for their emblem. I will almost always offer myself as a fresh hook option to buy the unhooked survivor distance and a heal opportunity.
---
are you seriously saying pig is even close to being as bad as Freddy? 
---
Did you just combine my favorite archer character with my favorite killer? 
---
How can I upvote this more than once?
---
You were Michael Myers the whole time. 
---
Well if 3 rank 1s play with a rank 8 lets say that rank 8 would soon become a red rank even though he wouldn't have since he plays solo
---
Woah... this was a straight up banger from start to finish great job!!👌
---
It's just because doing the things that maximize your pips doesn't always maximize your chances of winning. I can run around the map flashlighting the killer, doing 0 gens and healing all my teammates until they're all hooked and dead and then we lose the game but I gain pips. Meanwhile had I just done gens, and ignored the plights of my teammates I might even get a chance to escape without gaining pips.
---
I DID NOT
---
I chased an Adam for 3 gens. Finally got him: DS. Got him again: Flashlight. Got him again: Flashbang. Got him again: Flashlight again. After I finally hooked him, I camped because at this point all the gens were done and my noed was destroyed. End game chat was filled with fake rules that I "broke".
---
STOP RUNNING!
---
I would also accept a Jim Carrey/Matthew Broderick combo crossover tho: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5n28hpMFBE (this is an Amok Time joke if you didn't see/don't remember that one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCamCYip2t4 )
---
I definitely agree, especially when you look at the perks used on huntress. 
---
But with that said there are people who have played long enough to unlock lots of teachables and they are still potatoes. OP may be one of them. Or OP might be a survivor main who finally started playing killer after unlocking all the perks through playing survivor (for the bp). 
---
Here’s an idea. Get rid of ranks all together. You get a starter zone of like 20 games where you play against other new players and after that it’s a stomp or get stomped world. I just want games faster and getting rid of ranks would help that. 
---
Ds is not op it is just annoying. Idk why you guys are like this is sooooo op. It happens only once a game, and they can even miss the skill check, so it is fine the way it is.
---
wish more survivors would play like that. sometimes though killers ignore the healthy survivor trying to grab attention and straight tunnel the injured survivor. 
---
Did you live though
---
You and I know that but I don’t think the survivors did lol
---
Nah it just works so well with piggy’s endgame. Save a couple traps and just throw them on some people and go find whoever’s left. It’s not a necessity but it works much better than just as a crutch on her. Plus he said “kinda” anyways so I think he acknowledges that it’s not because she’s bad and needs it or anything.
---
Myers has been hanging around the Doctor too much.
---
Legion is the inevitable death. Once they've locked on, you're done. It's just a matter of time.
---
Another Jen Denise thread
---
Best is when I get excited and try to cleanse my own hex totem.
---
Yup! When looking behind, you have to press S to move forward.
---
When looking forward, you have to press W to move forward. 
---
I gen tap because I hit great skillchecks 10% of the time so its easier.
---
Before you call me a pleb, I'm a killer main. I was never good at survivor. Highest rank I ever got with survivor was 10.
---
Well that's obviously going to take a lot of practice to get use to especially when I'm being chased 
---
Funny enough, you have access to those stats on Xbox for whatever reason. It shows your total blood points you’ve ever made ever, all your sacrifices, all your escapes, your total time played, and some other stuff I didn’t particularly care about so I can’t quite remember right now.
---
They would call you out for camping and tunneling if you let them all escape on 2 Hooks each. 
---
Man these Myers buffs are getting wild
---
Thanks!
---
[Nope.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvdf5n-zI14)
---
Both, don't completely abandon gens but also try to find totems
---
I dont think anyone mentioned this but that pebble throwing perk (i forgot the name) now creates scratch marks so dont be deceived by it
---
I literally just had this happen in a game. I was huntress as well lmao. Although 1 of them had unbreakable, but still it gave me the momentum to easily 4k after that. 
---
I already said what in my original post.
---
I see nothing wrong with gen tapping RNG can be a pain at times with the skill checks being back to back
---
he said separate it from solo queues, you have some lovely reading comprehension.
---
I think I'm the only one who loves coldwind, since I play billy
---
oh that does make it cooler then huh, i am happy with it dont get me wrong, i just think at lot of the recent cosmetics cut corners and arent as fully realized as it could be, esp compared to splash arts
---
The new self care helps. Self heals lock in injury points, while team heals take away the points for successful attacks. Emblem wise anyways.
---
Above and beyond, I appreciate the little journey down memory lane. 👍
---
I adore Coldwind
---
Decisive teach😂😂
---
It is pretty unfair when you know the location of the gens and don't help them.
---
It always makes me chuckle when people say stupid things. Then you point that stupidity out and they ether go away or defend their position even harder.
---
In this community Literally everything is toxic. You hit a survivor? Toxic. You touch a gen? Toxic.
---
Whats really toxic? Abusive Messages in chat, sending hate Mail. Etc.
---
perhaps...
---
It definitely made me chuckle
---
Oh ok got it so basically if you play the game you're toxic lol 
---
yeah she’s easier than huntress so we’re gonna see a lot of her this halloween.
---
Does vaulting count as an action?
---
Exactly 
---
You have to rely on survivors being dogshit and grouping up against Legion. It's nearly impossible to tag more than 1 survivor unless they are on top of each other or you have longer duration/speed addons. (Which they still need to be grouped up).
---
If you give additional speed on survivors hit then Legions will just use that speed to hit the survivor again faster.
---
Stun duration is irrelevant since the optimal way to play Legion is to get out of chase after the second hit to start the countdown, then hit the survivor when they hit 1/3rd bar. (Or just have Frank's mixtape and down them without any thought to your chase).
---
Only way I could think that would make your idea good is if Legion gained a massive speed boost when heading toward that survivor indicator after the first hit. Even then you'd need to either run Iridescent button or Distressing/Monitor&amp;Abuse. Might be able to solve it by adding increased terror radius once you hit a survivor with power. But then people that like stealth would complain that Legion is a second Doctor and removes stealth from the game.
---
Just rework him honestly.
---
toxic = a technique that introduces a sour grapes/cheese/salt feeling
---
(we're all very hungry apparently)
---
hit miss
---
me guess never miss
---
URRAAAA
---
you have boyfriend
---
bet he no kiss
---
*kiss*
---
he find different girlfriend
---
he no miss you
---
he skkrt and dab
---
like wiz khalifa
---
While it's being sold by Strode Realty they don't live there. It's the Myers house.
---
Was going to say exactly this. Everything is considered toxic. I mean, just try not to be a dick, but if others are dicks first, it’s fair game. Don’t let others dictate how you play.
---
Alright sorry
---
Boyfriends memo is one of Michael Myers grey add one, which means you'll find it fairly often. It lets you do a lunge attack in tier one
---
Scratched mirror is as a purple add on. And is one of Myers most unique add ons that doesn't let you get out of tier One, but while stalking any survivors within 32 metres have their auras revealed (you can see them through walls and objects)
---
Map offerings give you a higher chance of going to the map that it's for. Lery's is a fairly small map with lots of walls, meaning while using scratched mirror you can see them, but they can't see you. The lery's offering is called Shattered Glasses and is green.
---
If you have any questions at all about any Killers feel free to hit me up, I'll do my best to answer
---
i’ll need pictures if you have them.
---

---
*a friend*
---
Hey mate, if ya don't find anyone you can always try r/dbdlfg
---
I may have one but my wife may be in the photo and if so I can't share. I'll check.
---
I hate how Wraith can just stop the chase from ~~procing~~ activating even though he's clearly following you. It's an issue for stuff like this, stops Lithe from ~~procing~~ activating, and just robs people of their chase points in general.
---
People need to get over "tunneling". Focusing on taking out a survivor as opposed to getting a few on hooks, is a viable (and smart) strategy to win. Going from 4v1 to 3v1 drastically affects a killer's chances to win. The biggest complaint is that the game and gens go too fast, and removing a players helps.
---
I agree that calling any strategy “toxic” is super silly.  Reserve that for actually toxic behavior like harassing messages, yeah.
---
If I'm on a gen by myself then I just try and struggle through, unless I get a shit ton of skill checks then I look in my area for the totem
---
I go look for totem if someone else is on the Gen with me and they don't leave because 2 people on one gen with ruin doesn't work. 
---
Reddit hates us Twitch streamers.
---
Also, having a number in your Twitch name... Not helpful.
---
Good luck though
---
Most of my games, Ruin is found within a minute because it spawns right next to a gen. Then I say to myself "These shits were supposed to be more difficult to find!"
---
Lol it can happen like that yeah but SWF  don't always remember to do that. This clip I didn't know how close last gen even was and I didn't know they were popping it when i kobed. Which I also didn't even know i was going to be able to kobe either xD
---
Hitting survivors with a pickaxe would be sweet
---
Always thought that was a stupid "rule" anyways. Plus now with Deliverance, we have no clue if it was due to the perk or that 4% chance kicking in
---
ruin can help, or you can also watch streamers like scott, zubat, ardetha, tru3. killer is so much more complexe than survivor so it's kind of hard to know what you are doing wrong and right but by watching these streamers you can learn a lot of things
---
Right?
---
Soo a smaller pig?
---
In a locker
---
When I  solo i have empathy on my build to try to help people in match if i'm finishing last genny and see that they're still in injured state (being chased or just in general) it doesn't have to ever been communicated through coms to make plays like that lol
---
Give them the juiciest butt rubs.
---
Feng with her long bob, dark sweater &amp; black pants = sneaky sneaky :D...   
---
Then someone getting chased purposely runs right next to you
---
If you get the PS plus account, and set it to "Primary Ps4" on any a Ps4, other accounts on that Ps4 can use any licsenced content owned by the PS plus account, and they can play games online without Ps plus (because the primary account has PS plus)
---
thank you, i didnt know that page existed!
---
I just repair through it.  Even if you’re not very good at hitting great skill checks (which I’m not) you’ll still get the gen done in decent time just hitting good.  As long as you make sure to let go of the gen as it sparks from the good skillcheck penalty so that you don’t trigger another skillcheck during that period where your progress is paused.
---
Obviously you might get lucky and find Ruin quickly, but I think more often than not you’re wasting more time than powering through it and only searching as you move between gens/dodge killer.
---
The reason why Legion seems strong is that he wins every chase in a predetermined amount of time unless either the Survivor or Legion misplays badly. If Survivors played optimally by not healing to full, genrushing, and not focusing on stealth then Legion would be trash tier. But that's every Killer tbh.
---
Any Killer without good/decent map presence can NOT be top tier. If Nurse could only blink when she was in a chase she wouldn't be S tier. If Hillbilly could only chainsaw in similar distances to Leatherface then he wouldn't be high tier either.
---
You sir, is why this community is going to shit. Thanks.
---
lol this happened to me too on the same map but oddly enough the killer DC’ed right when we loaded in. It’s almost like he knew 🤔
---
Deliverance applies Broken, so you always know, unless they also brought No Mither.
---
Wasn’t that good he should’ve m1’d you. 
---
It should?
---
This man has lost his goddang mind.
---
out in the dangerous uncharted territory of "if done poorly, it will look distinctly like blackface"
---
Assuming I even like Dwight smh. We all know that the Clown's thicc ass is where it's at.
---
True but that's the name of the game for survivors. Why would they be playing in a way that would stop them from doing that? It goes both ways, same thing for NOED with killers. They're playing to get all survivors killed. Personally I love empathy for many reasons. It lets me know where chase is going on and whether or not i should go try to take aggro or get myself away. Sadly in games like this everybody doesn't get to be happy at the end of a match result because one side wins and one loses. Each side gets plenty of rage ensued moments on them :/
---
Drive fast and leave a sexy corpse -Florida Stanley
---
I just try to find it now bc I know if end up getting chased for 5min team will do like 1gen lol

Frank's Mix Tape and Cold Dirt imo.

Oink
---
4 of the last 5 huntresses I faced used iridescent head with mori like wtf
---
Reminds me of Kenny's pizza commercials in Kenny vs Spenny if anyone knows what I'm talking about haha
---
Tfw you take premonition but get a huntress 
---
You don't stick next to unsafe pallets. If a Survivor runs some where else that's most likely because the Killer just started breaking it.
---
Legion just goes over it so it'd be decent to have faster vault speed to get chases done faster.
---
There's nothing wrong with gen tapping but unless you are getting skill checks all the time and arent hitting any greats it is so much slower than just working through ruin
---
As a survivor I don’t expect the killer to respect the 4% cause it’s not his job, it’s his business to kill me. However if I’m playing killer and someone I’ve hooked yeets themselves off the hook, I give them 10 seconds.

---
There are probably more that I'm missing but these seem to be **HOT** issues with most of the community.
---
Yea. If you use self-care then you heal 25% slower on everything but get the ability to heal yourself.
---
I'm console pleb too but I thought that was pretty obvious. xd
---
Everyone can debate rules. But nobody can deny that getting tunneled into oblivion sucks ass and ruins the game for 1 survivor. 
---
First of all, it was a terrible analogy that reflects just how much shit comes out of his mouth. Secondly, he doesn't realize how his attitude and comments have been affecting Jen. If you have a problem, then talk it out. Do not make it public and shame her. It's in poor taste and just makes you look like a dick. I also feel like the devs need to interject and help with the situation. The Twitch community helped evolve the game so they should remedy this.
---
The only way you can combat camping, when you're the one being camped, is Open Handed and Kindred Spirit. Open handed will increase your own radius to where your teammates can see if the killer is within 16 meters rather than 8
---
I feel your pain though. I don't BM or teabag. If I make it out of the trial easy enough, I let the killer sacrifice me, or try to change spots with another teammate.
---
The only other way I could see it is allowing for mic communication, but it'd have to be with a twist, to ensure killers don't have a worse time than they do now. **Voice comma are activated on hook**
---
How can you decide a perk is god tier without even trying it out?
---
Is this game more favored towards the survivors or the killers would u say?
---
That's the one thing I haven't faced all Christmas. I suck against Freddy so the Entity made sure to torture me with him.
---
Chainsaw downing is probably his daily. 
---
10 seconds is a lot in a game about time management. Maybe 3 seconds?
---
lol
---
yeah, like TINY.  can barely see him in the grass kind of tiny.   i'm not sure how it'd work beyond that but it could be cool.    i honestly think legion's  ability would be perfect for him.  annoying fucker that slices you up constantly.
---
I don't know, I've seen a mix of excuses and reasons and a fair amount of "As a content creator I need to do &lt;X,Y,Z&gt;. 
---
And it's probably best that Tyde doesn't host any actual podcasts. We're better off with people like Tofu or Paulie taking the reigns for this conversation. They've been absolutely killing it in the discussions I've seen.
---
It's more favoured to the survivors imo. Based on the fact that its an asymmetrical horror game meaning 4v1 meaning more people prefer survivor so they make that experience more enjoyable (again., in my opinion)
---
I'm sorry, but who the hell are all these people and why is this such a hot topic?
---
Ruin or gen Rush the killers dont have a choice 
---
I don’t do it out of trying to win, I understand that I’m giving them a HUGE advantage and in no way think that any other killer should feel obligated to do what I do. I just know that as a survivor saving yourself off a hook is a really good feeling, so I don’t take it away from people when I’m killing. But if I find them after my 10 seconds, you can bet they’re going back on that hook lmao 
---
i pointed at the hook to tell him to hook me, so he either wanted the bps with the chainsaw or had the chainsaw daily.
---
Not currently. It was about half way into the stream right after they talked about hooks and totems.
---
If you pick them up to bring them to hatch just make sure you pass a bunch of hooks to make it apparent that you are not going to put them on one. If you whack a hook they'll probably think you're taunting them lmao
---
The one and only time this has happened to me was when I was relatively new to the game. I was playing Freddy for the first time and all 3 survivors left got up onto some rock surrounded by trees. I spent a solid 10 minutes AT LEAST trying to get up there. They were holding the game hostage, teabagging and everything. I finally did get up there, but it wasn’t worth the suffering... FeelsBadMan
---
Nah you can literally walk up it but you have to do it at a certain angle
---
Killers can easily tell if its a Deliverance or not.  Deliverance applies Broken to the survivor in the hud that the Killer can see.
---
Only if the survivor runs No Mither can the killer not tell.  And no survivor seriously runs No Mither and expects to live to tell the tale reliably.
---
I'm not ashamed to admit that I remember usernames of people who do this and either lobby dodge or bring a mori and tunnel the shit out of them. You teabag the exit gates you get put on my shit list.
---
Honestly wish they’d completely rework the ranking system.  Ideally ranks should matchmake players of equivalent skill as accurately as possible, and this system where you’re pretty much guaranteed to move up in rank if you play enough doesn’t do that at all.  
---
Actaully it was ruin, the killer DC'd after someone else found their devour hope, if it was haunted trust me I would have put that in the clip.
---
You have no skill
---
What they mean by global healing nerf is that everyone uses self-care (even though they don't) so everyone heals each other 25% less so you might as well just heal yourself.
---
I see a TON of people not run self-care but everyone thinks that everyone uses it
---
This is like the monto video of playing with a 4man no hook squad in red/purple facing a r20...
---
Yeah
---
Same. I love the bing bong boi. 
---
Yes. Same as if you catch someone working on a generator
---
Yep, survivors can be pulled off any action like this. Unhooking, cleansing, opening and repairing. I believe the only exception is healing. 
---
Love it
---
I'm the rank 1 and I always play solo so it was a case of bad matchmaking which seems to be the norm
---
You realize that both your fact and my fact can be true simultaneously right? I know that I’ve already been downvoted to shit by people that probably haven’t even tested it themselves, but just wanted to point that out.
---
Not gonna lie. I did this once and once only. It was against a face camping nurse. She would hook people right next to the hill I was on and the only time she left the hook was to try figuring out how to get me after she figured out where I was at. I stood there from the start of the match to the very end of the match when I got a message from the killer asking if I was going to stand there all day. I just said yup. And then pointed at her. She asked me something else. I don't remember what it was but I just said I just turned Netflix on. Little did she know I was still watching the game. She quit immediately after that message. If she wasn't face camping I probably would have felt bad but I didn't care because she was face camping the first person she downed before the crows even told her where I was at. 
---
Damn how did I never see this in game, i always hit them when they are unhooking
---
What rules do killers make up for survivors?  Outside of meme basement chest builds and the like.
---
I’m a good both but like killer what about you?
---
No need to apologise. Like I said to someone else in the comments, I messaged the killer asking was he really rank 20 like the others incase it was showing something else on his screen and he said yes and that was it
---
And yet it's always the people running DS that complain saying Noed is cheating.
---
Ok fair
---
Spirit for killer and Kate for survivor!
---
Shitty killers do.  Borrowed Time is a far far better perk when it works for being obnoxious as fuck to deal with.
---
How about they go directly back on the hook because they 4% right in front of me :)
---
True when I first started playing I knew nothing about the game and looping and all that so I would be with rank 9 not pulling my weight and dying. It was hard I only pipped because I always did obj
---
The stun noises are ape shit lol
---
Legion is the lowest skill level to kill ratio in the game. It's brainless. 
---
No. They still struggle to down people (unless you're deliberately going after one target) and cold dirt barely has an impact on the stun duration. They still can't make use of exposed unlike all the other killers you listed, they don't traverse the map as fast as nurse, Billy or spirit and they don't have the Huntress' ranged capabilities. Hag I wouldn't label as top 5 myself but she's definitely effective when used right.
---
Nice. What are your favorite survivor perks to run?
---
He is really good at securing a first hit. The problem he has is the follow up hit, if you want to start the timer you have to specifically remove yourself from the chase and then be able to find them again because healing is easy if you’re not worrying about the killer but if you get too close or see them again you stop the timer again and as long as the timer is going off frenzy hit does nothing practically. If you all think he takes no skill let’s see you actually win some matches with him
---
Yisssss.
---
Pls tell me he at least broke shack pallet?
---
I watch her casually. She often plays with subscribers. Who are often lower rank than her. (Now I did not watch this video and I dont know anything about this call of action against derankers)
---
Let me guess, Claudette main with ds, self heal, dark bloodied red clothing, and always comments “tunneler” or “facecamper” after every match?
---
it is in ggez. you abuse the perk - you own it. instead of saying others are bad. because BBQ is really broken on these two and ruin is just very annoying and gives too huge of a boost to two killers already dominating the game. Nurse and Billy have enough map pressure to not need these two perks(I get BBQ gives points but come on, mate, you know how most Billies and Nurses use it). 
---
and I don't recall any horror film(unless comedy-like slasher but then where's the god damn Ash Williams?) to have victims t-bagging or bully killers. they all were running in fear for their lives. they would do badass moves, surely, but they wouldn't flex like 8 year-olds unless they literally killed a killer. 
---
I’m a survivor main, so I don’t have the answer, but I relate so hard to this. I remember a clown I was running from and legit was yelling at my TV “JUST BREAK THE DAMN PALLET”
---
So even with those add ons he isn't better than any of them? Who do you think is better than hag that's not on this list? 
---
What about the other 4
---
You can't get balanced landing in that room on critics penn. not high enough. I don't know about the other one you mentioned.
---
You also can't get BL on that truck on Ormond unless you do it right .
---
Respect the 4%.  I love it.  I've played 100 hours of survivor and Kobe'd probably 20 times.  Of those, the killer has "respected the 4%" exactly 0 times.
---
He has a strong skill ceiling but it’s slightly less in the chase and more in the decision making of who to go after and where to put pressure. He has a lot of trouble getting that second hit and actually down someone because if he does it in a frenzy it won’t actually down them and if he’s not in a frenzy he has a little movement speed so he can’t catch them. He hast to decide if he’s better off trying to chase down one survivor or separating and going after another one if he sees a heartbeat and trying to play around a little bit to elongate the game
---
steady running? like are you using the left joystick or actually using L3? what?
---
Pushing L3 while moving joystick forward 
---
If Vigil did that I definitely would run it.
---
since when are ruin and dead hard toxic
---
Ah, that sucks. Those spots seem perfect to use balanced landing on. I guess I can try it out some more and see if it's worthwhile. It just sucks that some maps have very few places to activate it.
---
Tacky.
---
Mmmm doesn't look loke what they changed would affect stability on the console. But hey the sound will be better. Kind of.
---
He is only boring if you think about him like a normal killer. Legion is a teen, this is all a game to them. You have to play with Legion like you’re playing with your food, like you’re playing a game. He’s not about killing is about enjoying hunting people down and toying with them
---
idk probably.
---
Nope, I specifically checked to make sure that I wasn't exhausted after they didn't work. As the other user said, it was probably because it wasn't high enough, which is unfortunate. 
---
i was saying "just break the pallet bro this is uber safe."
---
I check the immediate area around the gen and then do the gen.
---
I play Tapp with that hunch. So I know I just slog through my first gen I'll use my omniscience to find it after the fact. And the killer doesn't feel free to do nothing.
---
Try haunted grounds with ruin?
---
Allow it to also affect players in a small range and it'd good again.
---
A stun on a single missed attack would be quite brutal imo.
---
Just reworking the *Feral Frenzy* effect to grant a slowly depleting movement speed buff that gets reduced by missed attacks/vaults.
---
**Feral Frenzy**
---
Base Sprint Bonus Speed - ~~+22%~~ **+30%**
---
* **REDUCTIONS**
---
 * **1.33%** of max bonus speed for every **2%** of the Power charge depleted. (Would be faster than current speed for the first 2 seconds, maxes out at 66% reduction as Feral Frenzy ends.)
---
 * **25%** of max bonus speed for every missed attack.
---
 * **10%** of max bonus speed for every vault.
---
Sprint Bonus Speed increases by a flat **20%** upon triggering *Killer Instinct* (Cannot exceed 40% Bonus unless you have a movement speed add-on)
---
* Losing all bonus speed *DOES NOT END FERAL FRENZY.*
---
This would punish mistakes as the Killer has to worry about losing their bonus speed if they do not land attacks on Survivors.
---
I almost wish killers were matched based on their level not their rank, because every time I try to complete my dailies that are for one of my killers I haven’t leveled up yet I get trashed at higher rank
---
Iron Will Urban Self Care and Lithe, you?
---
I know some people have said that their running isn't as fast as it should be due to the joysticks being messed up basically. They said cleaning them or getting new controllers helped. Maybe hitting L3 is giving your joystick what it needs to actually run the normal speed but L3 doesn't actually have a purpose. I'm going to guess that's what's going on but it works for you so keep on then
---
Sure you can. It's all around you.
---
No looping? The fuck? I suppose I’m just gonna run in a straight line until I get got then huh? 
---
I mean there are quite a few, helps to know the maps though. I use BL because it basically gives me more routes to loop. If there's no pallet/window nearby but there's a hill, you're dead unless you have BL.
---
Tell me your secret.
---
Yes thank you.
---
I've cleaned it, it stopped my controller from bugging a lot (moving up for no reason) but in DBD it still doesn't run the normal speed idk why it only works with L3 and it makes my thumbs hurt 
---
I've ben extremely unlucky with Haunted Grounds. It usually blows up and I can't find anyone.
---
I find the Doctor to be a lot harder to play against and I play better with him. Of course this is anecdotal and I do run a built that essentially turns the hag into a slow powerless killer when I'm surviving.
---
Just so you know leader before the nurf stack and when 4 people are working on a hen it 27 X 4 = 108% repair speed it faster than prove myself by 68 percent 
---
I can see how that would be beyond annoying! I'm sorry.
---
Does multiple Leader perks stack? Do multiple new Prove Thyself's Stack? (As in multiple people using it on the same gen).
---
If either both stack or both don't stack then Prove Thyself really doesn't improve much on Leader. Leader gives 9% repair speed on a gen per survivor near you. only 3% difference alone. 27% vs 30%.
---
If they both stack then it's 12% more with 4 survivors working on a gen. But that's pretty unlikely. 3 survivors working on a gen is more common. (9% difference) 2 survivors even more so. (6% difference).
---
Doesn't seem like a huge buff tbh.
---
*laughs at survivors "you dumb bitch"*
---
Damn that was long read and I can see what you mean all the points you pose are valid and constructive critics make from my perspective 
---
I actually hope dwight doesn’t get too strong purely for the fact that I don’t want the toxic Claudette‘s to switch to Dwights, I almost always let Dwights go because they are usually awesome people
---
If they increased the duration and removed/reduced the CD to his ability, people might actually use his ability to track survivors after he hits with frenzy.  
---
Right now there's no point since there's almost no chance to catch up to another survivor making his secondary ability useless.  
---
I just don’t like having to lick my fingers after a hit
---
Wait hooks respawn? Forgive me I'm new.
---
The awnser isn't as cut and dry. There are alot of factors you have to think about. The map, add ons of other killers/expirience with a charakter.
---
The nurse is, unless expirienced or having a bad game on Coldwind, the most efficient killer in almost any scenario. On maps with janky tarain hitboxes and alot of buildings, huntress is worse than legion. Billy should always be better unless you cant control the chainsaw right. For hag it is all about how her setup works out, if it does she is stronger. 
---
If a player has never played either of these 4, legion is going to be better simply based on how simple they are. 
---
But the new leader isn't supposed to work on gens. The old leader did
---
Tunneled... LMAO you mean chased.. by a KILLER. It’s called losing.
---
thank you for reading and commenting. do you have anything to add though? I'm really curious if you have some other perception on these matters. 
---
That what I said I said before it was nerf because the new leader is a nerf
---
What about spirit?
---
Lots of survivors in here by the downvotes lol I’ve gotten some hilarious DMs from salty survivors when I chase them down.
---
Depends on theap (big or small / hard or easy to check totem spots) and maybe see if the killer is so nice to give away the location. 
---
This is correct
---
Yes. It's a part of the game, but like the comment you replied to said, it completly ruins the fun for the survivor. There is nothing fun about immediately going down after getting unhooked. Also, the unhooked person is not a better target. If you go for the unhooker, you get more pressure. The unhooked is gonna have to self care themselves. That way only 2 people are working on gens, because you're chasing one and one is healing. But if you go for the unhooked, yeah you get an easy down, but more people are gonna be on gens and you'll have less pressure. You're exactly the type of killer who tunnels one person the entire match and then cries about how the survivors "genrushed" you
---
Same here
---
You expecting them to use no perks? Lmao stfu.
---
oh, yes, the lag and actual game mechanics problem with the insane auto-aim and ridiculous hitboxes. like when awake people can bodyblock sleeping from getting a hit or taking the auto-aim and counting it as a successful lunge attack with a given stun after it. that's just... my favourite. love it. losing to game flaws that were not coded properly.. mmm, amazing.
---
Why do people meme my country’s queen?
---
I love the idea, would give me a reason to buy him. I’d also like to get pharmacy
---
Let's not forget that non-obsession DS has no warning and the killer doesn't know if that person has DS or not. A free escape at 40% wiggle on 3 people without the killer knowing is just cancer, especially if they also have toolboxes to sabo the nearest hook.
---
Depends on the area if it’s a small area I don’t break but if it’s a safe loop I do break
---
"Huh would you look at that" Its almost as if totems as a mechanic are a shit design and should just be removed.
---
Didnt even need to use a hatchet. Could have done this as wraith lol.
---
***JUICY***
---
I mean it was introduced as part of the goal to make survivors do less farming "saves" with an incentive not to.
---
Doesn't really help though with the safe unhook timer being so shoddy.
---
No, I don’t cry about getting “genrushed” because I don’t cry about stupid made up rules. Going after the generators is part of the game, just like killing survivors. And honestly, I don’t care if the way I play “ruins your fun” lol do survivors care if they “ruin the killers fun” by being the last one alive and hiding for 20 minutes? Or standing around teabagging the exit gate? No, because that happens almost every single game I play. Do I send salty DMs and cry about nonexistent rules being broken? No, because I’m not a little cry baby like 80% of the survivors on this game.
---
Genrushing, tunneling, all of that is 100% bullshit. There’s winning and losing in this game.
---
Me: Bloodwarden is a shitty perk and doesn't work on survivors that guess/know you have it or see the ward before they give you aura.
---
Also Me: Why can't I escape? What the fUUUUhe's got NOED too GG guys. 
---
I don’t think you can activate BL if vault the window in the back of the house on springwood
---
Hahaha. I am excited for the timer. That will help. A lot I think
---
Not all the wraith players are scumbags trying to lag you. Most are just scumbags 
---
Or, OR, Slug the guy who got off hook, chase the unhooker. If unhooker fails get two, or force one of the two who were working gens to save the poor slugged guy. The unhooker gets away, pick up the unhooked and put them back on.
---
Even better
---
Juice, sauce, little bit o’ dressin’?
---
The fact so many people get salty about being left on the ground astounds me. I was chasing someone else. If your teammates come scrape your sorry ass off the ground, you got a second chance, if they didn't, they obviously though objectives were more important than you going down. Also, how many objectives have to exist in an area before it stops being camping and starts being tactical?
---
I had two on hooks and HATCH and they wanted to bitch about camping.
---
idk something about her legitimately triggers really bad memories 
---
PS4 by any chance? I’ve noticed lobby times even as survivor have become absolute trash from around 11:00pm est through at least 1:00am when I finally give up. Takes forever for a lobby, and when it does come up it’ll be a minimum 300 ping.
---
No you don’t, L1 is the fastest way to move, L3 does nothing but control what direction you move 
---
A. I did not know that, I'm not sure if they will (thank you for the knowledge get tho)
---
B. I'm not sure they look at the side of the screen when they see that teen fleeing the dinner table without saying thank you
---
C. It's all kinda moot cuz again no one seems to honor the kobe beef
---
Part of the reason is that only a few killers are consistently viable at high ranks, and AFAIK, that's how the devs want it, which I really think needs to be changed. 
---
Kills entire family
---
UwU sowwy daughter-san
---
I cleared it up with someone in one of the comments
---
I just hate you. literally. don't you dare to compare Dream Daddy and his pain to these edgy teenagers that don't require skill or brain to play as. 
---
to do good as Freddy you have to be a good killer in general since his power cripples him mostly. there are no add-ons or perks that can bring him up the tier or be uncounterable.
---
Yes, ps4
---
[I cleared it up with this guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aeo9em/comment/eds0qfl?st=JQRMK0C2&amp;sh=b7846329) 
---
To be honest this late in the game I would think most p3 meta squadettes would probably easily be able to get Dwight’s perks without ever playing him.
---
Ooh good to know, this doesn’t happen behind walls though right?
---
Correct.
---
as an ace main, I kobe every other game. 
---
Cropping, my friend. *Cropping.*
---
But it wasn’t Tyde’s podcast. Paulie, Monto, Geef and a few other names were discussing
---
No, I am a R1 Survivor and killer and this is too broken in the way you’re suggesting.
---
First hook on a survivor = token. Lose a token by hooking same player again. Expend 4 tokens to mori a survivor. Slightly better and balanced imo.
---
Wow I [really](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9xzcfy/killer_idea_the_copycat/) like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/a2l9wa/killer_that_could_morph_to_look_like_survivor/) totally [unique](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7chk03/killer_idea_skinwalker/) never [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/76xce6/new_idea_shapeshifter/) heard of [idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/6eq95z/can_we_get_a_shape_shift_killer/) that [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4p56qz/suggestions_new_killer_ideas/) just [had](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/4oicin/killer_suggestionsurvivor_perk_serial/). It's almost like we don't even have a sidebar.
---
Yeah, also nurse, Billy, spirit, leatherface, Freddy, legion, doc, huntress, trapper too. So underrated
---
As someone with a maid Huntress cosplay, you're not wrong...
---
And there's a way to get around it anyway. Just don't get caught first.
---
He isn't running it, it's on his level one bloodweb?
---
Dont bring james into these memes please
---
And Huntress, of course
---
?
---
You’re worse than a camping leather face with noed.
---
I had level 3 insidious by level 7 when I leveled him(before you got perks in levels 2-4. It's pretty dumb 
---
Thanks for the reply, unfortunately no dice for me, point still missing. I'm on Xbox but considering picking it up in PC for less bugs n such 
---
If you're not in a chase you're most likely doing a gen or healing, in which case you're recovering from exhaustion regardless. This wouldn't change anything. 
---
You just jealous smh my head
---
Yeah I didn't think BHVR could make a character that was both unfun to play AS, and AGAINST.
---
Played a game as Pig. 4k the survivors. Reach end game screen.
---
Me: GG
---
Stupid David: BULLSHIT
---
Me: Hmmm?
---
Stupid David: You play a broke ass character! Admit it!
---
Me: *facepalm*
---
I love Pig. She has built in slow roll for the game. Get a collar on by the second gen, and the game becomes so manageable. I've had Game Over at least three times tonight. 
---
This.
---
3 Frenzy hit downs and incredibly short stuns.
---
This week has been awful. Takes 10+ min to get in a 500 ping lobby. Its crazy. And once I get into a decent lobby the lag is nuts!
---
Lol dont worry about it. I was just making a joke. Didnt mean to sound hostile.
---
Really? I usually let the last one go almost every game and I don't really see these survivors you're talking about. Then again, for the survivors that you're talking about, if you're good enough at chases you wouldn't lose them due to there being no distractions from other survivors, and the fact that there is no time limit because you want them to get out the hatch.
---
I wear the Claudette face so I can also be stealthy
---
It’s cool dude. I wasn’t trying to be hostile either, sorry if it seemed that way.
---
So you’re upset with the community not the game itself
---
Not everyone on the internet wants to spend their entire time arguing with randos. You go into threads where people are being nice to downplay their accomplishments and call people cancers. Why should they be nice to you, or do anything other than tell you to fuck off?
---
I agree fully. I will say when it comes to any competitive game that you play a lot. There will be some toxicity, its just the nasty side of competition coming out of us.
---
I don't personally watch DBD streams that much, but hearing that popular streamers are toxic. I can see how people who like to watch them can abosrb that. Games like League,Overwatch, and CSGO. All these games have toxic streamers as well. DBD is no exception either. I see where your coming from and agree.
---
Noob3 is the only DBD streamer i watch and as far as i can he is a pretty chill dude. Not toxic too much if at all. :3
---
I'm not disagreeing with you completely as I have heard a few other people say they had the same issues but personally I've never had that issue. I definitely would rather play on Mount Ormond than Yamaoka Estate.
---
Survivors usually wants to play the game. It doesnt come down to "hey lets play effectly" at that point, it comes down to "this game is fucking boring and its all on killer" - no1 cares about pipping at that point when gameplay isnt fun
---
Because it was recorded on PS4 lol
---
Why so serious man? He's married, it's a joke.
---
no, I think they're easy because I played them and got the Adept achievement playing really casually on red ranks on pc. used only their base perks, naturally, that I didn't even use in the game cause no one went into a locker, only worked in group on gen this one time and then never did it again and no one ever tanked a hit for the Mad Grit to pay off. so yeah, I was perkless. 
---
not only I got the Adept, I also got double pip and perfect score cause I didn't camp/tunnel, literally just hook and go. 
---
and trust me, survivors were not potatoes. if I'd face them on the same map as Rin, Evan or Doctor or any other killer I love playing, I'd be happy to get 2k even with good perks cause they were very skilled survivors. 
---
the things you say they need is also something other killers need, you know? like when to follow your obsession, when to waste ds or slug them, when to switch targets. it's killer 101. you have to know these things to do good. and there's never a perfect recipe. it always depends on a game. don't shit me here Legion is hard, they're not hard. they're easiest killer to play as because they ignore pallets and windows and don't require good prediction and mind game skills like Nurse.  
---
Thx. I’ve been practicing 😂🤷🏼‍♂️🤷🏼‍♂️
---
When? During the Hallowed Blight?
---
Huntress got a skin then, too...
---
Lmfaoo
---
Cant wait for the killer population to drop
---
I hardly see any nurses, hillbillies, or spirits at rank 1, personally.
---
It's mostly legion, Huntress, and Trapper for me. I try to play Myers and Leatherface to add variety. I don't personally like how nurse games end up; all the DCs make it impossible to have fun. 
---
Oh,shit is that [  D E C E A S E D  F L E S H  ]? 
---
Nurse and Spirit  
---
I don't blame you for doing it this game makes people be assholes, but it's still kinda messed up cuz you're abusing a glitch.
---
Ok, that was good!
---
Is it like this for you at all hours of the day?
---
I could understand if its happening around this time for me is 12:26 a.m. So if its even past 10 I would see where your coming from.
---
But in the morning and until late afternoon I feel lobby times are pretty good and sometimes killers have bad ping. Sometimes they dont. Gotta roll with the flow. 
---
The only male dbd cosplay that matters is Shirtless David

---
It shows! Ugh, I thought Chazz Michael Michaels *was* figuring skating but I am shook right now. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWi0Owg4ZbM
---
you're not listening to me. 
---
they don't care that killer image is being shitted on, rank image is being shitted on and that survivors facing Legion are being frustrated and bored. cause apparently some guy getting rank 1 worth the crap survivors had to go through. and you didn't read my previous comments, as it seems. no idea what actually you replied to. I said that I only bitch when it's posts about getting rank 1 with Legion. other cases I either ignore cause I don't care about them or if I see some cool non meta build or, like, Freddy with no noed getting the last pip, I say nice things cause that's pretty cool what they did. 
---
and they *are* spending time arguing with strangers, you know. by replying me on the public posts on the internet saying I must not express my opinion while they're doing it right now by expressing their opinion on how I must behave. because apparently they have the right to have an opinion while I don't. 
---
Oh sorry, I thought you were being serious. I couldn't tell your tone.
---
Huh, I don't know any killers that say not to do those things. we all used to bitch about DS but the changes to it have made it less toxic, pallet flashlighting still feels like a dick move though, and toxic SWF groups are still as un-fun as it gets. SWF groups on voice do feel like it is SUPER against the spirit of the game, as it is getting away with clean and traceless communication between survivors across an entire map with no penalty to the survivors no matter how much they communicate. 
---
It would be amazing if there was proximity based communication in the game where Survivors could only talk to each other within a certain radius or something. That'd at least make experienced SWF a little less cancer to play against.
---
Apocalypse memes will be the best, but unfortunately the last.
---
You do understand that these weren't quality of live changes for killers? It was needed or the game would be dead by these days? If Killer had shit like these back in the day , they would fucking fix it in a blink of an eye. Just because it better than earlier doesn't make it better in comparison with suvivors moron, this argument MAKES NO SENSE 
---
I'm not sure about that either... 
---
HELL YES! CONSOLE FRAMERATES ARE TERRIBLE. MINE STAYS AT AROUND 120-160MS.

It's cool, I was kinda hoping you weren't gonna be cool about it in the response so I could pull another of my shitty jokes off on ya. "It's a funny ass joke, why the fuck ain't any of you bitches laughing?"

Maybe, maybe not.

But if it takes that long hopefully I wouldn't need NOED in the first place

I feel like that should be the text of a "save the planet" commercial (just black text on a white field) and it will end with "make your choice."

 Nurse literally ignores pallets and windows with her ability too. If legion is easy so is nurse, except nurse can use her ability for the second hit too so she actually has an advantage. Nurse may take a game or two to get used to her abilities distance but after that it’s auto gg 4k. Also almost no perks work for legion because his deep wound doesn’t count for healing so he is very limited on useful perks so on top of nurse already being more op she has more perk options. And what kind game and prediction skills? The same mind game and prediction applies to all killers except that legion still has to actually vault pallets and windows whereas nurse is just boom there and hit. You can call legion easy if you want but if you do then nurse is the most basic bitch in the game and an auto win
---
Playing pig because it's the closest thing to a hotline Miami killer.
---
damn, I laughed bit too hard :D 
---
kinda weird when you're 27 yo woman but have a sense of humour of a 12 yo boy

It has definitely gotten worse this week. Even when searching solo it's a good wait but when I'm searching with just one friend we usually only get to play 1 game, maybe 2 if we're lucky, each hour. Hopefully it'll change at rank reset in a few days, my friends and i being rank 1 probably isn't helping. Hopefully it gets better soon.
---
haha, the humor of the gallows indeed
---
Yeah legit, as a through and through killer main, people that say this have no idea what they're talking about. If it weren't for pallets or looping the game would strictly be a stealth mission for survivors, being found = death, so I think they just say looping is toxic because they don't know hoe to counter it and therefore get salty about it
---
Honestly, an Archer / DBD crossover meme was the last thing I expected in life
---
I wish people didn't give Claudette a bad rep. She's the survivor I play the most because I like her back story, plus I never play toxic. I never really use her super dark and stealthy clothes either. I've said it before and I'll say it again, every time I play killer I get more toxic P3 Neas than any other character. The tea bagging, following you around the map flicking a flashlight at you, No0b3 wannabe types (I actually No0b's videos, no hate here). 
---
It logically and mechanically makes absolutely no fucking sense.    
---
Maybe all of the SJW corruption in Canada is creeping into the dev's heads, making them absolutely batshit crazy.  I don't fucking get it.
---
then why they mad?
---
look, I can turn your words on my side, you do realise that, right? and it will be logical whatever you have to say about it.
---
that's the thing, there's no ultimate truth out there, no right or wrong, all things have more than one side to them. and all things when they relate to humans get an emotional colour to them. and this where the arguments are born. there's nothing certain, only opinions. what you're doing is useless unless you're like me and just enjoying getting into arguments with people on the internet. if not, then I don't fukin know why you're replying to me at all. cause none of us is right or wrong. just two people with different opinions looking at things from different angles. 
---
If you think sloppy butcher is good on legion than you’ve clearly never played him. It doesn’t effect your deep wound and most people don’t even waste time healing because you can only hit them with frenzy and it won’t down them so there’s no point. And sure huntress has slow speed because she can FUCKING THROW her axes, she doesn’t have to catch up to survivors. She’s another example of a killer who uses their ability for the down like nurse, whereas legions ability hinders him from the down. Nurse does the same thing she just hucks her entire body at the survivor instead of an axe. Predicting which side of the rock they go to? Ooooo no you predicted slightly off, good thing you have a second teleport or more with add ons. It’s almost like it takes no skill you just tp to anyone and win. Also you can tp across the map crazy fast, and have even more map control than legion. He speeds up a bit but not billy fast and def not nurse tp fast. His ability lowers the effectiveness of pallets and windows and helps him gain for his first hit but that’s it. It’s not op, it’s just a tool. They nurse? Op and easy, she’s the real bore.
---
Thanks mate
---
I came back just to reassure you that you're dumb, in case at any point you had doubts. 
---
:)
---
&gt;"You're worse than a face camper" according to you I'm the worst person on the planet for seeing if I could even do it to begin with. Lol.
---
I'm sorry? Since when are face campers the "worst people on the planet"? Or when did I ever associate the lot in such a context?
---
I got 99 problems and, I assure you, face campers ain't even one.
---
&gt;Then you go on in your second rant talking about taking a game seriously. 
---
Not really a rant but okay.
---
&gt;The whole point was to just fuck around. But I'm being the one taking the game seriously right? You're bent out of shape over a post on the internet.
---
I take opposition to a person who takes advantage of an exploit and makes the game unfun or unfair to the other players. Noob3 and the like got banned for this before. Why should it be acceptable now?
---
Also, I ain't bent out of shape. That's wishful thinking on your end, my dude. Despite my dislike, I'm just chilling and browsing reddit.
---
&gt;You're a joke dude. Hahahahaha. 
---
A joke at exactly? 
---
Especially with the rubber band add on. Lunge 3 feet!
---
have what? and no, I said you're not my supervisor. 
---
Then you’re friends are either just as suction cupped to their chairs as you or they make fun of you behind your back. Because friends that approve of that are no friends. And fuels you? Dude get a life, or atleast drink some water because you are clearly thirsty and lonely
---
Gj mate, you tried.
---
Lol no killer likes d-strike also when you get unhooked maybe hide near the hook and let the other survivor run away and take the aggro?
---
Oh so you actually do have mental problems that make you take this way too seriously. 
---
The slasher's even getting killed in the entitys world. Not only that but by his own teammates.
---
I have fought Legion as well. You can grow up. The fact you'd rather be butthurt over it makes you the immature one. Not the Legion Main you keep harassing.
---
Simple, play as survivor and put your bloodpoints into killer.
---
Playing the pig solely to teabag survivors
---
I really don’t see an issue with what he said. 
---
Im a R1 Killer, and the reason DH is a Hex is because it would be ridiculously op without it. Its not hard to hook someone then be 24 m away. You are basically proposing everyone gets permanent exposed after I get my 4th bbq stack, every game. Even without the other effects, the 3 stack exposed would be broken. 
---
I like DH the way it is, its not supposed to give you those effects all game, its a nice little mid game suprise, as soon as you get a hit at 3 stacks everyone starts looking for the totem, slowing the game down. 
---
Totem spawns still need some work, but not this, this is garbage.
---
Yeah those Flashlights are hard as fuck to use.
---
I've been playing for about three resets when it resets on sunday.
---
My total count of successful flashlight saves = 1
---
I've been avoiding the flashlights, saving them up for a time when I have many so I can practice but haven't used any of them.
---
The one time I did manage to save someone was when introducing my friend to the game and I made a smurf so he wouldn't have to go up against rank 1 killers his first games.
---
TLDR; I suck with flashlights, they are hard -.-
---
I never said both sides don't have idiots. I just meant that, in general, that's how both sides are. There are obviously outliers for both sides. I've met some really cool survivor mains, even in matches when I got 4 kills. The norm is that survivor mains can't accept a death, especially if they had an item on them. If you're offended over me talking about shitty survivor mains, then the chances are that you're one of those shitty survivor mains.
---
As soon as the exit doors are powered, and someone is on the hook, you're damn rights I'll be chilling by the hook waiting to take advantage of their altruism.
---
The freddy buff we needed.
---
Literally every killer requires those things, you’re not special you’re just an egotistical dick lol you know what nurse doesn’t require? Talent past learning her ability
---
door open = 20s
---
wake up time = 17.3s
---
leader door open = 16s
---
Leader boosted Wake Up time = 13.98 ~ 14s
---
yep, new leader is meaningfully boosting people now, like a support perk should.
---
and just for fun:
---
6 stack remember me door time = 50s
---
6 Stack remember me Wake Up time = 43.47s
---
6 stack Remember me Leader door time = 40s
---
6 stack RM Leader Boosted Wake Up time = 34.96 ~ 35s
---
new dwight buffs are like the dude who helps you carry a heavy package to your car when previously it was like the same guy kinda getting out of the way, but otherwise is just their for moral support.
---
wow lol. you people when out of arguments always pull out "mental issues" card, that's old. 
---
literally just said that I am completely aware of what is going on in these arguments and said arguing on the internet is basically my hobby. 
---
are you able to comprehend my words or you're just trapped cause have nothing to counter with? 
---
Yes please devs
---
Yeah mostly it’s Claudette’s but Nea is definitely a close second, and I wish nobody had a bad rap because I wish there was no toxic survivors or killers
---
 I do that when it’s a toxic serve or if I need my lass bbq stack , most of the time I just give the hatch though.
---
&gt; so I think they just say *anything that's hard to deal with* is toxic because they don't know how to counter it and therefore get salty about it
---
FTFY

You're being the toxic shit you accuse others of being by logging in. You complain and make up rules the killers/survivors have to live by to be good citizens in your happy little world.
---
Don't use Nurse or Billy!

No Legion!

No ED and DS are banned!

Play my way or you are the cancer killing this game!

---
I might need a boat for all the salt you bring with you.
---
They could have still jumped in lockers though. 
---
Jack torrance can be nice
---
Yes! That sounds great!
---
on console we have to type with controllers, so the chances are not only less but multiples of factors less.  
---
Makes perfect sense to me
---
Don't forget body and hook blocking when a survivor is being held. Buying your ally time to wiggle out of their grasp is somehow toxic as well.
---
What if you don't play NOED?
---
A boat on an ocean and you still thirsty, oofdah man are you like super fat or just really ugly?
---
Easy to do on computer, takes less than 30 seconds.    
---
Typing "Killer has noed" on ps4 chat with a controller, while also adding that person to a chat is a fucking chore. 
---
There's 4 survivors.  
---
One can at least take one for the team and let the other 3 have fun.
---
I have one rule for unhook,if i hook the last guy and the hatch is available,if he manages to escape the hook I give him teh [hatch.Life](https://hatch.Life) gave him and opportunity and I wont interrupt it.
---
Breakdown + saboteur
---
"I broke his shit and now he's mad."
---
This perk has 1/2/3 tokens. When entering within 2 meters of a hook the perk consumes a token and the hook breaks.
---
I wouldn't be surprided that you drink ocean water with the amount of salt in you. Did a post on the internet cut deeply into you? Who hurt you 
---
MESSAGES DISABLED? SCARED BITCH
---
literally fuck off
---
They flex on you, you kill their team fair and square. No face camping or tunneling, just straight up playing your best. Some people just like to mess around, it isn’t that deep and no one should take it personally. I always just crouch up and down randomly in front of anyone or on my own so.. there’s people like that too 
---
Prove Thyself still doesn’t really do anything. Sure if you’re working a gen with three other people, overall repair speed is about 30% faster...but there’s also a debuff for every survivor working on that gen...about 30% slower in fact. 
---
It’s not an exact counter to it. Prove Thyself will still make it go faster (but not by much). In the PTB Prove Thyself is bugged and is interacting with toolboxes and whatnot (it shouldn’t). That’s how gens are getting done in like 15 seconds in the PTB. 
---
In the twitch stream today, the devs also mentioned decreasing the % on Prove Thyself. So it will be even less effective. 
---
did you even read my comments? 
---
it's not what I said. I said abusing Ruin and BBQ as Billy and Nurse exists. 
---
Legion is inherently broken and needs a rework because their power is frustrating and boring to play against.
---
DS and noed bringing frustration to the game. and you don't have to use any of those to win or have fun. I did not tell anyone to not use them. 
---
I did not tell anyone to play my way or they're cancer. I said they're cancer for choosing the broken killer and abusing certain perks or saying ggez after abuse instead of just owning it when other people call you out for using those. that's what I call an opinion and you're free to disagree with it. while you're getting real mad for some reason and insulting me personally while not even understanding what I said.
---
my own opinion on noed - idgaf. I don't use it as killer main cause I don't enjoy the one shot kills. but as survivor I either cleanse everything, the noed or die and couldn't care less. 
---
on ds - I never use it and as killer can't be bothered unless there's more than 2 of those, then it's really annoying with an swf. 
---
but I know these two are a very touchy subject and make many people frustrated. and this is all I said about them. 
---
 Quite like this actually. 
---
And you're the person I can't say "GG" at the end of a match. I get it though, I get them too, but i usuaully diffuse it.
---
Don’t cry about ds too, Noed is much more powerful
---
It's just petty, but it is a video game, who gives a fuck lol. Pettiness isn't "scummy". But it's childish lol.
---
Lol maybe from your wife but I’m sure she’s too busy fucking other men right now, I mean hey when you two split atleast you won’t have to worry about having kids around

---
The next 2/3/4 survivors who are hit cannot see the skill check prompt.
---
Legion is pretty fun though...
---
Oh nice you mean what Legion probably could have been? ;) 
---
I read through it and I actually love it. I love a disguise mechanic and the hallucination debuff is nice but it would have to be the same killer hallucination otherwise it'd give away who the actual killer is. The fake gen idea is amazing though. 
---
I love the mind game potential of "is the gen slow because the guy next to me is the killer or because the killer has thanatophobia etc etc" 
---
When I am feeling generous, I do want them to wiggle free. If I want to get them to hatch I try to get them to follow me.
---
Something about that Ps4 intro and outro makes this way funnier, I'd like to see it with some crazy bad fps and bugs.
---
When you spawn right beside your totem and think it is safe and gets broken literally a second later
---
Or you can down the injured one, hook them again which will likely result in their death and permanently lower the number of survivors.
---
For anyone curious his YouTube channel is “Anestra”, do with that as you will. His username is “I_Onyx_I” though I’m guessing you won’t find him, he’s probably either changed it or set to private from getting so much hate as he’s deserved already. Be a dick? So what who cares. Purposefully exploit glitches or hack one of my favorite games? Feed ya to the sharks
---
you see, saying someone chose the specific character because of lack of skill is not the same as call them insane or say they're acting like an infant. I repeat that I don't imply everything must be as I say. I imply that I want to voice my opinion in a whatever form I find fitting as long as it is in subs rules. I solely said that there's something wrong and to avoid certain things you gotta act differently. I don't want to be called camper or tunneler so I don't do these things. simple as that. if you camp and tunnel be ready to be called out for it. 
---
That's how they get you to chase them when they're being jerks so they can save their friend. It doesn't really get better unless you play during peak times like events where people are less likely to be dicks with friends, sorry. Roaming is a kinder play-style but especially early on, camping just to get anyone is completely understandable but you should try roaming to extend the game, you get points even if you don't sacrifice people so I'd recommend trying to get better at roaming.

A random dull totem becomes a trapped totem. Upon being cleansed all survivor auras are revealed for 10/20/30 seconds, and the one who cleansed it is exposed for 10/20/30 seconds
---
Wow, this is rare.
---
Just because you don't see those perk sets often, doesn't mean it is an exaggeration for other players. Surprise surprise, but our gaming experience can be VERY different.
---
Partially true short term yes it benefits you to have two people hurt and healing to gain some time but overall KILLING that person that was on his second hook and completely eliminating him from game gives you bigger advantage. 
---
Every time if they unhook you after struggle I will smack them even down them but still tunnel YOU because playing 1VS3 beats playing with 1vs4 and that's about it.
---
Thanks for the free promotion. 😍 
---
All the hell screeching. You can’t come back from that
---
Maybe you should be asking why your Queen is so meme-able...
---
Tried burning the Myers offering so I could try him out for 1 game, immediately got a SWF team and Coldwind
---
Even better when they had chance to leave but teabagged the killer and misjudged where the escape threshold was
---
But that's not the Killer's fault. You're there and one hit away from letting them slow the game down/get safe kills. Unless the person who unhooks is also hurt, it just makes sense. Blame the person who unhooks you while the killer is there.
---
Spies in the Shadows + Whispers
---
Whispers in the Shadows
---
This is an obsession perk. You become obsessed with a survivor. You can hear their audio faintly in the background. Once the obsession dies or is sacrificed, the perk deactivates.
---
(I don't encourage tunneling but you gotta do what you gotta do)
---
playing pig because you are a pig
---
and if you do bad, don't worry, playing with a friend or friends is a huge advantage for the survivors since they can coordinate all of their actions, can often know where you are, and can bring complimentary perks and equipment. The game wasn't really designed to compensate for that imbalance of power.
---
Same here my dude, I don’t expect anything from killers but when I play killer and someone loves, I give them a nod and go for their teammates
---
From the notes I could see it sounded like everything *but* repair speed was getting a buff, and that was saying the same
---
My locating and assisting teammates build*
---
dont judge his food baby nurse
---
just because you never got the family you wanted
---
Suffocation Pit must be located on the dark side of the moon
---
I think they should base the chase stuff based off the killer's mobile direction. So if he moonwalks, it up keeps the chase. For all killers, pig and whatnot too.
---
True, you gotta point.
---
I don't play Nurse, dude. I just don't hate playing against her, because that thing that "literally every killer requires?" Legion doesn't. Legion can cheese survivors to death. Nurse requires more talent than Legion does, and that's a fact. Legion only needs to follow survivors after hitting them twice in Frenzy.(since you get the second hit for free anyway) You literally break chase and wait 20 seconds. How's that for "not even a game anymore?"
---
Play however you want that’s not cheating or using an exploit. People won’t like it, but don’t give a damn. Close the after match chat if you have to, or just immediately leave the lobby. If you play on console make it so that only friends can send messages. 
---
You’re going to win some and you’re going to lose some. Probably more of the latter for a while since you’re just starting out. It’s a game, it happens to everyone. No matter what, there’s always a loser. 
---
If you feel pretty heated or downtrodden after a match, I strongly recommend taking a break for a couple hours or days. Go do something relaxing. 
---
Finally, if you’ve devoted a decent amount of time into this game, and you’re not having fun the majority of the time, then I really do recommend moving on to a new game. Games are meant to be fun and enjoyable. If you’re not having a good time, then don’t play it. 
---
I don’t pallet blind/save I only try to go for chain blinds into pebble at a vault into q and q a different way 
---
so the best people can do some times is camp, but again they don't like it and it's a tug of war of things they want vs what you want, the war is unwinnable but small battles can be won just try and enjoy yourself and don't take it personally, it's not you.

Last mid chapter patch, Feng Min rose up with her huge buff to Alert, allowing our residential W33B 3L33T to pretend she has anime powers.
---
This time, Dwight " Friendship is Magic" Fairfield finally leaves his long term waifu, Locker-chan, to actually fucking help.
---
Prove Thyself: This once terribad perk provided Dwight with all the benifits of old Leader with all the effectiveness of No Mither.  Now it has swallowed its competition and gained its powers like a metaphorical Kirby.  
---
Prove Thyself grants 10% faster gen repair speed to him for every survivor working on the same gen as him.  No matter how you look at it, this once bad perk is realling **Kami**ng up.
---
Leader:  deep in the belly of Prove Thyself lies the discarded shell of Old Leader.  In it's dying breath, it manages to cough out an egg out of Prove Thyself in the hopes that it's heir will avenge it.
---
That day has come as the Piccolo Jr of dead by daylight  matures and squares off with the perk that killed its daddy.
---
New Leader channels it's strength not into assisting in gen repairs, but into everything else, from healing to cleansing totems to even opening the gates faster than Wake Up.
---
Bond has always been a solid pair with Leader, like a **Nail** to a fretboard, but now with New Leader and Prove Thyself, they have become a being with a name lost a long time ago.
---
They are simply known as "The Fairfield"
---
If they're on death hook, sure down them and hook them. If they're not, it's better to create pressure because otherwise the gens will be done instantly
---
I love running into swf like these, they're just so stupid.
---
Hey, I need to reduce Healing time, Tell the Devs to fix the game?
---
Ha ha get it? Because office man is smiling.
---
If they're not on death hook, it's better to slug them than hook them. If they're on death hook, kill them. 
---
I do too! I respectfully smack them again and hook em up! Those survivors so clumsy sometimes ...
---
I had a group that all spawned together so they finished the gen in about 15 seconds after match start and it scared the living daylights out of me because I was not yet mentally prepared for it
---
*Finger Guns the devs*
---
Ace: Good looking out, Mclean
---
By "letting the other 3 have fun" do you mean that they work on gens the entire match whilst one person gets tunneled to shit? Just working on gens isn't exactly "having fun" to me
---
good fucking idiots gen rushing and cant even stop it with ruin when the hex spawns inside their pussy
---
Yes, but what does that mean? Prove Thyself only effects yourself. It can't be put on you by anyone else.
---
My thoughts are that maybe it means only one Prove Thyself works on a gen at a time, while the others do nothing. But that makes multiple Prove Thyselfs literally useless so I have no idea what they mean.
---
These are the biggest DbD players/streamers.

You're a bit late fam they removed Insta down bear traps.
---
That isn't how both sides are in general. That's how you and this sub perceives it to be. You only notice more douchey survivors because there's more of them in a match. I'm not even a survivor main, I've played both sides since the game came out I'm just not fooled by biased posters like yourself and a lot of others on this sub. But anyway keep jerking dude
---
I see you are a man of culture as well
---
Ice, wrist, little bit of flexin'?
---
Ah, I see. They literally buffed Leader by 1% and put it on Prove Thyself instead. That's why I thought he was referring to the 9% Leader gave. My bad.
---
If Blindness removed the Survivors HUD as well, it would be worth running.
---
we love the archer dead by daylight crossover 
---
Must be a damn good huntress if you can chase 4 survivors at the same time
---
Tyde is right here though...
---
Oh ,Look at that, taking it like a champ! 
---
I did not say it is toxic to use strong perks, please, stop it (T_T I realise it's my fault for not phrasing things better but English isn't even my second language, I'm sorry. 
---
I have no problem with the game apart from BM and ruined immersion because of it(well and balance/lag/bad coding issues but that's not an opinion). all I claimed is that these perks(BBQ and ruin) and people playing the two characters with these two perks is kinda toxic because these perks give them more advantage than other characters when they already have enough advantage just with how their powers designed. that's all. 
---
also I do not care for ds, personally never use it.
---
 as killer, unless there's more than two of those in one game, I also have no problem with. it's not wrong to use ds. what I said about everything is that the listed perks and certain things/playstyles bring frustration on people. and these perks and other things are not necessary to have fun or win. 
---
looping is in no way toxic, I never even said anything remotely similar to this. 
---
I listed many things, most of them don't bother me. I included them because it's what I see every day on Reddit or in the game. my personal problems are typical Freddy main problems. I did not list a single one of them cause it's strictly a Freddy tough luck. 
---
I'm salty about Legion. nothing else. because Legion is a broken killer and is very frustrating to face. 
---
If you chase a good player don't cry about "gen rush" lol. 
---
I understand it is unfair but honestly I prefer playing with my friends and giving the killer some disadvantages than joining in a match and having 2 people DC the first time they are downed and having to repair 5 generators alone because the other guy is afk in a fucking locker. This shit happens in at least 4 out of 10 games I play alone 
---
Prove Thyself is the name of a perk and a perk *type,* like how Sprint Burst and Dead Hard are both Exhaustion perks. Prove Thyself, the perk, and Leader are both Prove Thyself perks. So my guess is like how Exhaustion stops you from chaining Exhaustion perks, you can't have  multiple PTS perks buffing you at once. Like, now 75% action speed boosts from 3 Leaders. How this applies to PTS, the perk... Yeah, I dunno. My guess is the same as yours, only one buff applies per group, so max boost would be 30% and not 120%, but it's not really clear.
---
So if you’re only trying to say he isn’t fun then why are you wasting so much time on an opinion? I don’t think nurse is fun. I don’t think Freddy is fun. That doesn’t mean jack squat about them let other people enjoy them if they want fun is based on personal interest in a character. I have tons of fun as legion and other killers. And getting juked as nurse is the same as getting juked as legion, ever tried to hit a small moving target while running 60mph? And yes I can follow tracks and bloodstains but that’s what I’m saying is survivors have options there as well. Try hiding, or juking back and doing things any killer would struggle with. Legion has a strong ability to attack but he wastes so much time on 1 survivor just trying to get them down and survivors if they are half decent can waste plenty enough of his time for other survivors to get their gens done. Legion is fun and takes plenty of skill, just because you don’t like legion doesn’t mean you have to hate on everyone’s parade. Clearly you just are far too pent up with personal issues that you feel a need to bag on a killer you don’t even choose to play. Let people have their fun and play killers you want to play, just don’t be a dick

I guess it's not their fault that most DbD survivors look like the most generic teens ever.

But I will give credit for putting on things like bloodstains, dirt and the actual haircuts and small details like Dwights tiny wristband, the pens in his pocket or the little badges from his job.
---
If you cant pip without tunneling then you dont really deserve to be at the rank you are, and maybe a few full escape games would put you were you should actually be. 
---
Rip the homie.

My favourite way to use them is with Iron Will! It's way too difficult to get a flashlight save, I'd need the stars to align. I'd just prefer to use it as an escape tool.

Oof that bold to do with her having rancor on you lol

Nah, they just want their D to stay wet in bloodpoints.

Nice write-up OP. I can agree with you. I don´t like using decisive because I hate when I get hit by that perk. The solution is in ourselves indeed. I hope people played fair if they got more points in games in general. Too much grinding right now especially for a student like me who has not got that much time right now. That 2x bloodpoint week was a blessing and it should stay somewhere around there. 1,5 maybe...

He got cocky and kept crawling to the edge of the rock so I tried the glitch myself while spamming pick up button then I got him lol he was about to bleed out too. He ds me but I had enduring and got him back down asap

Doesn't he go straight into phase 3 if he's the last guy when you hook him?

i'd say the "remembering im the one playing killer" would keep the really stressed heartbeat. (in my opinion)

Wait are full escape games meant to depip? I get those a bunch but I just don’t pip, doesn’t make me depip

It’s the purple engineers toolbox that doesn’t unlock sabo. Guaranteed that’s what their using.

only reason to use luck offerings now,welcome purple flaslights lol

Tbf half the time the only person I see is the person that got unhooked. So I just go for who I see.

You can hook everyone twice, get some chases ..they don't even need to be killed. That's at least safety for not depip, and will likely pip I though??

Suvivor community of DBD is the biggest group of Sissy's I've ever witnessed in my life
---
That's why I whoop that ass
---
More like Neo is Ruin and that train is a survivor 20 seconds into the match. The inevitability of cleansing. 
---
Also not that true and dependant on situation ..., if I smack or even better slugg unhooker and tunnel unhooked guy I create pressure too..., Now they have guy on in struggle phase that they need to save and one person licking their wounds somewhere in corner or better slugged either free second hook or pressure to them to save.
---
Ain't nobody fixing gens in that situation also if it's your SWF buddy nagging and bitchin on TS about me being cun*  that derails you and him and works in my favour.
---
Again it's quite situational but saying it does not benefit killer to tunnel just isn't true...
---
I don't think it gets any better. This game is really good at generating salt. At the end of the day, as long as you're not hacking, cheating, exploiting, etc. etc., then you can do whatever you want. You're the killer, you don't have to listen to the survivors. If you don't want to see the salt at all and you're on PC, you can close the chat box by clicking the &gt;&gt; button, and it'll stay closed forever until you open it again.
---
The only counter to loops are playing Nurse very well, or knowing how to use Clown well. Some Huntress builds can also counter a lot of loops.

---
I don't think you understand what I mean, so let me try to explain this in full.
---
I thought I couldn't hate a killer more than I hate Doctor before Legion went live. I don't play Doctor ever because I don't want give survivors a bad experience. The reason I hate Legion is not because of the level of enjoyment I think I would get out of him if I played *as* him. It's the personal experience of playing *against* him. A Legion that plays to win does not interact with survivors, because with *minimal* skill they can follow a survivor without being in a chase, resulting the survivor having literally nothing to do except run around for twenty seconds, try to mend, and either get hit or go down because they are harassed to death instead of actually getting hit.
---
Let me say this again. *Legion follows people to death*. Nurse teleports through walls, but still has to hit you twice, and doesn't have a point-two second recovery time between those hits. Doctor harasses you and can make your life a living hell, but you still *interact* with him. You can avoid his passive madness by hiding in a locker, you can dodge his active madness to delay tier 3. ***And he still has to hit you twice, with a standard attack cooldown.*** Legion hits you twice in the span of 3 seconds, then breaks chase in 5 seconds, and follows outside of a chase for a maximum of 20 seconds, throw in 2 seconds for funsies and you have a 30 second chase, wherein the survivor had 3 seconds to actually effect the outcome.
---
And yes, I'm standing by my claim that if you can't track a survivor without direct line of sight you are actually very bad at playing killer.
---
It was a joke please dont downvote me to oblivion

How long you been waiting to complain about this match?
---
I think the actual 84% figure (because I remember reading a breakdown of the actual math in a post) is how likely you are to actually unhook yourself running this build with these circumstances with max luck and 6 attempts. 
---
Post them, obviously.
---
Ashton kutcher is laurie XDDDD
---
Just use borrowed time. If survivors did this more often then this wouldnt be an issue. You literally have a perk to help stop this. 
---
no it isn't. Not by a long shot. NOED can be easily cleansed just by clearing Dull Totems and thanks to RNG sometimes spawned right in some open easily seen area and immediately cleansed.. While NOED is a training wheel perk to reward shitty killers, DS is a straight up training wheel perk to make shitty players who can't loop or run feel better about getting caught by throwing them a get out of jail free card at another chance.
---
It CAN ALSO be used and abused by skilled players who you might have to spend 10 mins chasing around and maybe thanks to a mistake they made you finally got down.. only for them to get a 2nd chance at running you for another 10 mins .. never mind a whole team can run this fucking BS perk. Please.. GTFO here with NOED is more powerful BS.. fucking straight up comment from someone who probably NEVER plays killer, Pure straight up a clown shoes Survivor playing only comment. 
---
What the fuck is this advert shit. PS4 for the players... of videos.

Oh. Then probably a /s for sarcasm can help. Sorry about that. I tend to find jokes via text rather hard unless written in black and white.

4k hours since June 2017
---
At least you can get rid of it now. When the game was first out,  noed didn’t need a totem, it was just there. So they could just go back to that if you want
---
It would be great if there were other hex perks that make you go for dull totems, but at the moment, going for dull totems is against a single perk out of many the killer can run, and takes up a large chunk of time to do. If they add more perks that inculde dull totems being a threat, cleansing them can become a proper side objective, but doing it for one potential perk is just badly designed with the amount of time the task takes.

Okay okay so The DS part sure thats believeable. But then he gets flash light saved okay thats sounds legit too. But then fire cracker saved? You know how hard that is to do? Its already tricky to do a flashlight save so im supposed to believe the guy whos already been flashlight saved once by his friends was now saved by a fire cracker? okay sure lets say thats true. THEN he downs him and he gets saved AGAIN by a flashlight? Honestly if you really think this happen you must be stuck in 2017 DBD because these flashlight save squads are very uncommon even at red ranks and not only that but the killer hasnt caught on at this point of the 3RD SAVE?! really? Im sorry i just dont think its true. If it is that damn that sucks but im thinking its too convient.

Jewcy saltines

Goes both ways as a killer wraith i had a perfect round and sacrificed all 4 immediately zero gens done. But only got 14k bloodpoints for it
---
lol.
---
This is the DBD Sub, that's why. LOL
---
The highest luck you can get is 48% total ever at the moment. I broke down the math already in my comment above. Your odds dont increase with each attempt, they stay the exact same. That's how carnival games make money.
---
(This isn't under the shit posts flair so this is fair game imo)

"I'm going to tunnel you because you're willing to grind the points or financially support a game and it's developers which in turn even just cosmetic releases can help provide enough support to help keep a game alive slightly longer till it can release a majoy content dlc or uodate"
---
That's not true, how do you suppose Billy's, Hag's, Doc's, Pig's etc. Get kills then? I mean if every survivor just looped there would be no way to catch them if there are no counters... the most obvious is mind games, quite a few of the loops are poor for survivor yet people still try to run it
---
Cause usually I'm that camping-patroling cunt that didn't notice anyone with chilly but seen those sweet scratch marks close to hooked person. I smack you once and interrupt your unhook animation, second time after you save him and off I GOOOOO tunneling like a bad killer I am :)
---
Again situational....
---
Can always make more sons! Thass juss logic ;)
---
How do you hold a game hostage?
---
It’s cool but ultimately it doesn’t matter. The devs won’t do a chapter based off of a fan’s idea. This is still a cool idea though. 
---
How the fuck does a leatherface fail to camp you?
---
Or the killer who camps nearby the hooked survivor
---
I love it when they teabag at the exit gates. Little do they know they just got blood wardened in here with my NOED Freddy
---
Its way too convient how everything lines up. And a fire cracker save top on top of that? Tell me how many times have you been blinded by a fire cracker let alone had someone get saved from you off it? Also as a killer if someone were to flashlight save on you would you let it happen again? Cause i doubt you would. There have been so many buffs to the pick up speed at this point that a simple patrol to make sure no ones around pretty much guarantees a save cannot happen in time or would be too trick to time. Let alone 3 times in a match with 1 being a fire cracker. I dont know man maybe hes right but for me? Nah i dont believe it.
---
Im made this for community, not for devs
---
I personally find firecracker saves Much easier than flashlight saves. And on some maps having no walls/spots to block flashlight saves commonly happens. Especially if it’s a swf (I’m assuming it is) the animations give quite enough time to flashlight save a person w/ addons.
---
And using the analogy of 2017 gameplay makes no sense when you just said “flashlight save squads are uncommon.” That shows they still show up.
---
I call the story mild exaggerated, but highly feasible.
---
Oh okay. Well it’s definitely an awesome idea! I’d buy this chapter 
---
I purposefully am avoiding rank 1 until its something of value again. Which means dc'ing is now my hobby.
---
This is such a creative picture haha
---
JamesChamp
---
&gt;Tell me how many times have you been blinded by a fire cracker let alone had someone get saved from you off it?
---
Like three times? What rank are you at?
---
&gt;as a killer if someone were to flashlight save on you would you let it happen again
---
You wouldn't *want* it to happen again, but when people are good with flashlights and you aren't near any walls it's a crapshoot unless you want to look around for the other person first.
---
Didn't you?
---
Me: Shitty survivor mains are worse than shitty killer mains.
---
You: WOW YOU ALL JUST TRASH TALK SURVIVOR MAINS IN THIS SUB.

Me: Wow, you sound like a shitty survivor main.
---
You: WOWOW GOOD JOB PROVING MY POINT WAY TO ASSUME I'M A SURVIVOR MAIN WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE BACKING IT UP. 
---
I mean, if you're not a survivor main, good job being professionally offended on behalf of them. 
---
Oh so it will be in the next available bloodweb? Awesome. The I will definitely get the t3 perk. Thx
---
hahahaha EVIL ! I hate blood warden so much , I don’t tea bag Freddys for that very reason . I’m gone .
---
No player should be able to hijack the game, no player including the killer. The fact that the killers have (and have always had since release) monopoly on deciding if after hooking a survivor the game should continue as normal or not is just simply wrong.
---
"No useful perks"
---
*Pharmacys in angery*
---
Hence why I said the proposed speed buff/frenzy elongation for each subsequent hit on a fresh survivor. This helps get across the map faster not only to get to other survivors but to patrol better, this will make the Button worthy of being ultra-rare as you can capitalize on the map wide TR, and make M&amp;R and Distressing amazing. Legion will also have strong maps and weak maps they're better/worse on just like any other killer.
---
Legion's problem is not being able to get more than a few meters after an initial hit, I'm suggesting the speed boost/Frenzy duration be rather substantial and only made better with certain add-ons. Yes Survivors can separate really far, this should be a viable counter-play to legion and make people think twice of being huddled together to co-op a gen or heal each other, etc.
---
Remember hitting an already DW survivor ends your Feral Frenzy, my suggestion is to give them a long stun, like equal to a multi-blink Nurse, also keeping in mind Legion doesn't get their power back right away this should give the survivor ample time to get decently far from a 110 speed killer who is stunned for ~4 seconds, this is to discourage going for a tunneling Legion. 
---
Optimally you would be hitting multiple survivors every frenzy and can end the chase on the last one rather quickly with my also supposed suggestion on less stun IF you hit multiple unwounded survivors to help slow the game down a lot with 1-3 survivors busy healing (assuming the shorter DW timer from the PTB goes through, they will be healing a while) and another somewhat easier to down than if you were to waste time tunneling them like you would now.
---
try again next time ...
---
No but the overall binomial probability, 48% chance taken 6 times. You usually will succeed. 
---
At least he wasn't tunneling. Problem is that if legion doesn't tunnel he gets no kills while simultaneously stalling the game infinitely.
---
Much easier but theres a delay? So you not only have to drop it perfectly to time with the sholder drop but also be facing the killer. Plus most killers ive played against will patrol first to make sure no ones around so after the 2nd save to let a 3rd one happen is just way too much. Also my point about 2017 DbD is that flashlight saves were a lot easier. They have since made the animation faster and tighten the timing to do it. Its still possible of course but its a lot tougher than it used to be so thats why 3 times in a match with the killer having no counter play just makes this feel like a super exagerated story.
---
It's Incredible! So glad I could help with this! :D
---
850ish hours since June 18. 
---
I almost never get it to work out but when I do it’s the greatest perk ever. Usually it’s only the people still alive tbagging at the gate, or they all died before the gens finished. But in that sweet spot lies some real game changing moments, with usually a lot of DCs.
---
if some doesn't know, it's a Wraith bug with Sloppy Butcher where you have this fountain of blood even when healed. the whole game until i destroyed ruin, couldn't do gens, and overall it was really irritating to the eye so now my head hurts real bad and eyes feeling weird.
---
No, rank doesn't matter. If you're good of course you're going to easily climb up, but it's also easy enough for crap players to 1 trick pony or cheese their way up the rank ladder too and stay there. You constantly see people at ranks 1-5 doing shit and playing like they should still be ranked 20.. Just like levels, rank doesn't really mean shit in this game either since it's so easy to game.  Sorry to bruise your ego 
---
lmfaooo sweet spots . awww wow DC . take your loss. Yk how many times I got caught at the gate being a dumbass 🤷🏽‍♀️ i gotta take my L, lessons learned 
---
At least boil over is a good meme perk and not like vigil where it’s just bad.
---
During the event I got upwards of 30 smoking splinters. Haven't burnt one, probably never will
---
The point is counterplay. Legion moves at 132 and vaults pallets and windows - no counterplay compared to the two killers you listed where survivors can use pallets and vaults still
---
Literal Jerries
---
Dude he's the killer..that's a ridiculous statement. He controls if you live or die..hence the term killer
---
If he wants u dead it's his call on how he wants it
---
LolDBDcommunity
---
To be fair, we are only hearing the salty story of the killer. We don’t actually see the gameplay, the rank of the killer, perks, add-ons, etc.
---
On the other hand, two flashlight saves in a swf can be considered normal/likely. And timing the flare isn’t that hard if your between the killer and the hook their going too.
---
Rank is irrelevant in this scenario because we dont know the OPs rank either but i made it to rank 1 killer before and ive had someone flashlight saved from me very rarely but even as a survivor main in my games ive seen my fellow survivors rarely be saved themselves at red ranks. And every time ive gone to try and flashlight save the killer has always done at least a semi patrol to see if anyones near amd im sure by the second they wouldnt be letting that happen again. I mean do you as a killer just pick up the person you down or do you patrol first? Also honestly as of lately how many times has someone flashlight saved on you? Let alone 3 times. One with a fire cracker too.

If people who run killer around and juke are shit are people who do gens and get insta downed when in chase are good?
---
Can confirm this.
---
I hit rank 1 for the first time yesterday on the back of simply prioritising healing and saves because they're rewarded way too heavily. I can't complain though since it's technically "healthy" for the game as it means that hooked survivors don't get ignored all match.

(Disclosure: I'm not as skilled as rank 1 survivor would imply)

It's actually useful I can camp the basement while the blue hair girl squirms in agony..hemad.com

---
Maybe like i said it could have happen and maybe my joke came off too harsh a triggered people lol but i dont personally believe the story. Could be true and even as a survivor main ill admit that sucks ass but i watch content creators who are also killer mains (tyde tyme, monto, unintelligable gibberish man aka Tru3) and a lot of have spoken on how rare flashlight squads are let alone saves. 
---
You really suck toes? 
---
I can understand your bad phrasing, im also not good at it. But its just a synergy between billy and bbq, not abusing or toxic in any shape or form
---
Only feng min’s
---
I personally I would want Murphy Pendleton as the survivor and the bogeyman as the killer. I felt like silent hill downpour was the best game of the series. It was certainly my favorite. Murphy was an interesting character, and the bogeyman had a very creepy presence. 
---
Could be more subtle and just let evey survivor know when a totem breaks. Up to your to count. 
---
Eh I play both also but this place seems more biased towards salty killer players which I sorta understand. You also contradicted yourself there.
---
not sure if hexy is anti derank since he did it himself with the excuse of "better queue times"
---
I dont really understand what is your point exactly. How are killers at mercy of survivors if the survivors end up being dead more often than not?
---
How fast do you propose Legion goes after hitting the first Survivor? You're proposing that the speed boost ramps with every Survivor hit, but the issue is hitting the second survivor in the first place. If you increase the duration after a successful hit then what counterplay do other Survivors have after their team mate gets hit? If Legion can just sprint across the map after hitting one person then you make his kit way more toxic than it currently is. It'd be stupid to think *Welp, Legion hit my teammate. He's coming towards me. Guess I'm going to get hit too no matter what I do.*
---
I know hitting a DW'd Survivor ends your frenzy. What I'm saying is a longer stun won't matter. The optimal way to play Legion is to take the stun, turn around, and walk backwards/sideways towards the Survivor so the chase ends and the DW timer begins. Once it starts just look at the ground and follow the scratchmarks+blood. Then, once they hit 1/3rd bar, you activate your ability and down them. It doesn't matter how far they get. Once they get to low DW timer they have to stop to mend, in which case Legion catches up and downs them.
---
Also Legion doesn't gain too much from procing DW on multiple Survivors. Only bad survivors heal to full against Legion. If he chases you while injured, looking to just M1 you, you are now able to loop him. If he uses his ability to hit you then it didn't matter whether you were full HP or not.
---
This is why his kit needs a rework. There's no counterplay. Any sort of buff makes him even more oppressive to play against. If you buff his map presence (his only weakness) then he becomes god tier.
---
Oh you're one of those players, that explains it lmao
---
Shadowborn was always making me dizzy for some reason haha
---
and yeah, killer times for migraine mates are harsh after Darkness Among Us D: i'm also killer main and can only afford one killer game per day or migraine comes

---
They both look pretty good, but I’d say your huntress is better. Your Feng Min cosplay make you look like a vampire. Still good though!
---
Some people de rank to learn other killers. Like if you’re trying to learn huntress and you mostly play nurse,  trying to learn a new killer with an entirely different skillset at a high rank is not a good time. 
---
Nothing to do with the made up rules topic but: try to counter flash saves, it's not that hard. Happens from time to time, but it shouldn't happen 3 times in a row.
---
&gt;I mean, if you're not a survivor main, good job being professionally offended on behalf of them.
---
...What part of me playing survivor and killer did you not understand lol? I'm not offended I'm merely pointing out something obvious. 
---
You also proved my point by being incredibly jerky circle and biased but you seem to have still missed that point entirely. 
---
Have you tried changing some network settings? switch to static IP, change subnet mask etc. The game might have some ports that it needs which your router hasn't opened/enabled or something.  
---
Don't think that I'm an IT technician now. I just mess around with settings a bit.
---
binomial probability doesnt change your luck, it's still the same. they're more like an educated guess. 
---
Just draw abs on for shirtless david! You can draw the beard on too
---
In general exposed perks are just lame to go against. Being chased is the most fun bit and these perks deny that. 
---
Lol, “Panda Fanboy”. You clearly don’t know his community. Most of us are adults and are too old to flock to someone’s defense just because we’re “fans.” This is not Ochido’s army of 12-year-olds, friend.  We watch Panda because we enjoy his content and have similar views on the balance of the game. When we disagree with him, we can have a mature, reasonable debate. I suggest you watch one of his streams someday. His twitch chat is by far one of the most chill in the dbd community. 
---
I don’t understand what anybody is even arguing about. Don’t wanna do totems? Fine. Don’t. But then you don’t have the right to bitch about NOED when it procs. Simple as that. That’s the point of the OP. 
---
Nobody needs to attack anybody or talk about burner accounts or witch hunts or whatever. The people who agree with the message of the meme are not the ones escalating things or pointing fingers. That would be you. 
---
Vigil was good before the exhaustion change, now I can only see it being useful if it was buffed to *prevent* Mangled, Blindness while increasing how fast you recover from Hindered and Exhaustion (exhaustion while standing still). So it would be a good perk to counter clown and it would cancel out sloppy butcher.
---
Firstly, by treating every player with the assumption that they intend to shit on you for their personal entertainment, you become the player that's shitting on *them* for your personal entertainment, and then perpetuate the cycle of behavior that, to me, it sounds like you resent.
---
And secondly, how would you, if you were a dev, make tunneling *fun* for survivors? Make Borrowed Time baseline; create an invisible wall around survivors for several seconds after they're unhooked? Players giving other players a bad time is not always something devs can reasonably fix without a severe negative impact on what is otherwise a perfectly functional mechanic and valid option in certain scenarios.
---
Thirdly, "winning" is a relative term for both sides. If you make it about emblems, you can do just fine without deleting someone from the game, and actually reduce the amount you can gain in the Chaser category because *each hit* is a successful chase. Downing someone that's already injured and then just immediately hooking them means less progress on that emblem. If you play for BP, you the same rule applies in the Hunting category, and also in the Sacrifice category (each time you hook someone is BP, which means if you deny survivors the chance to unhook, you deny yourself up to 1000 BP). If you make it about getting kills and nothing else, then there is no direct downside for you tunneling that survivor down, except for the fact that it lets the same two survivors focus on generators without worrying about being chased off of them, letting them get those generators done without interruption while you secure your one kill and let 2-3 generators pop.
---
I want to be clear here that I'm just making a case for my opinions. I know that I can't change your mind, and that's not what this is about. But I'm reminding you that you have options. That tunneling isn't always the optimal strategy. That if you disregard other players' fun, you imply that they are free to disregard yours.
---
r/technicallytrue 
---
Honestly, if I can tell a game is gonna be smooth sailing, I play nicely. I don't tunnel, camp, I respect the 4% etc. But if the game is progressing too quickly I'm gonna do what I have to do to kill your ass. 
---
No Mither+Boil Over+Sabo 3+Tenacity/Unbreakable. Go upstairs in the Thompsons house and sabo that hook up there then sit in the corner. Watch as the killer cannot get you out of that house and you constantly wiggle off. You can do that for 3 minutes I think with Sabo 3
---
Totems are always disposed in a circle, once you find 1-2 you can easily find the other ones. There are justsome exceptions, like The Game map. In any case Small Game and Detective's Hunch help learning the spawning patterns.
---
True, but that's just The Game being The Game and an Ultra-Rare Add-on being an Ultra-Rare Add-on.

Legion is the epitome of bad game design. There's 2 ways people enjoy playing Survivor: Stealth and Chase. Some people like the Chase and some people like Stealth.
---
While the Stealth players complain about Doctor, the Chase players don't. While the Chase players complain about Clown, the Stealth players don't.
---
Legion says *fuck you* to both styles of play. I think the Devs are out of touch with the game but that's just my opinion.
---
You thought that Silent Hill Downpour was better than Silent Hill 2? I thought that Downpour was one of the weaker games in the series. Not quite as bad as the train wreck that was Home Coming, but definitely not as good as 1, 2, 3, or Shattered Memories. Downpour had bad enemy design, uninteresting characters, the Boogieman was literally just a Pyramid Head stand in, only less interesting.
---
Don't be too close to pc and get some sleep. 8hrs/night.
---
You might be good after that. 
---
"Death is not an escape"
---
what's your native language? 
---
So you missplay atleast 3 times 1 by overchasing, 2 by getting repeatedly flashlighted which you easily can avoid and not once but twice. Good flashbangs cant be avoided but you screwed up atleast 3 times. And then because YOU played bad. You punish the survivors for it. The point of the game is to have FUN. Good killers can abuse the game easy to get 4k every round. The best killers choose not to.
---
😑
---
I did for quentin, worth it
---
I think his Great Knife is too iconic for them not to use it. Not only is it almost as recognizable as Pyramid Head himself, it's also hugely significant to the events in the game too.
---
Its been nearly a year since I've seen this bug, glad to see its still around.
---
 Good for you?
---
Yeah don't hide near the hook. A lot of killers start their search for a rescued survivor at the hook and grunts of pain are a dead giveaway. Can't tell you how many kills I've gotten because someone thought it was a bright idea to hide 3 feet from the literal first place I should look
---
I went to the store for some chocolate flavored milk
---
Hmm... Yeah, that sounds legit, shit like Scream and Happy Death Day comes to mind right away
---
The Spirit was kind of trash on release but they did fix her shortly after. I do love the character design of Legion (even though the way they did Joey and Susie were meh), I just hate the power. I don't think the Devs are *completely* incompetent and I still love this game.
---
But any Dev that's in charge of game design/balancing would have seen the idea of Legion's power and how it cancels out all tools survivors have and immediately scrapped it. The fact that it got passed the idea phase and made it onto live is what makes me lose a lot of trust in the design/balancing team.
---
Romanian(daco-latino-slavo influences). You do the math lol
---
That is kind of just, one of those tricks you are only likely to pick up if you play both killer and survivor. Since if you play a lot of killer, you know how perpetually in meta bbq and chili is for how good it is. As a survivor you start to play with the assumption that a killer has it, since you would always run it. Same with nurse's calling. If you hear the terror radius, you know to stop healing since the killer has about a 50% chance of having it. A lot of survivor mains also pick up on killer perks after a while, but it is easier to do if you also play killer enough to notice how other good survivors counter your perks so that you can imitate it.
---
Sadly there's not much you can do other than making the killer want to give up on you. Getting really good at looping, improving your map awareness (like where good pallets, windows, and overall loops are,) and learning how to break chase are really the only things you can do. If you can make it not worth their time to chase you, then many killers will just give up and go somewhere else
---
Why do you care if someone’s following you? It just means that 2 people aren’t on generators 
---
DS is completely wasted on players who can't loop anyway what are you crying about ? At worst it buys the survivor 10 second, at best he misses DS. The perk is op on good survivors who can handle killers only. Contrary to NOED actually rewarding shitty killers
---
oof, yeah... my native is just Russian. second - German, third Polish and then English. but i was studying Latin and Ancient Greek in university so i can grasp the bits of Romanian. 
---
can you share some Romanian rap? really curious, only listen to German these days. 
---
Sorry for the incoming wall of text.
---
It is not black and white. In a chase both the killer and the survivor need to make decisions. Making the wrong decision as a survivor means that you are getting smacked, making the right one means the chase continues. So far we agree. The thing is, however the claim that survivors are always in a position to have all the information to make the right decision is wrong.
---
An extremely good, and common example is the L &amp; T wall combo. If the killer chases from the wrong direction the survivor gets easy, uncontestable fast-vaults on both walls. Chasing from the right direction, however, means that only one of the walls can be looped which turns the scenario into a mindgame. Neither the killer NOR THE SURVIVOR is in a position to make a definite right choice before a vault, both of them can only bait, and bet. Even a traditional M1 killer can force these scenarios, there are only a limited amount of places where no mindgaming is possible.
---
There are a lot of situations where getting a hit comes down to predictions and luck, but it does not necessary mean that the survivor needed to make a mistake, its a 50-50 game.
---
I agree that it sucks but if that is to change, it has to be changed by the devs, not by the community unwritten rules.
---
Cool, does these colors have any effect during the trial? Like on aura reading ability?
---
I played Planetside 2 for almost 5 years and they had an infiltrator class which is as invisible as wraith is. I can spot wraith from quite far away... so i think he should be fully invisible
---
I was about to suggest that
---
*You're about to get added to my kill count*
---
Broken fundamentally, yes. Legion removes skill from the equation, doesn't get kills unless he tunnels, and wastes a ton of time for survivors. They're not fun to play as or against, and sadly with how the power is designed I think that the Legion is going to stay that way
---
I want to learn german too. My great grand-father was german.
---
Here it is one: https://youtu.be/-98SH4YwUSI
---
This guy is a very known rapper in my country. Very notorious.
---
Title is "The perfect present"
---
same thing happened with me the other day... I was like lol the killers luck is ass
---
Why let the artists do their work when they could be fixing those bugs?? 
---
Clearly their fault for doing what they learned to do! /s
---
This comment hits too hard home lul
---
&gt;being on PS4 j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶h̶i̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶g̶r̶e̶a̶t̶s̶ ̶a̶l̶l̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶t̶i̶m̶e can be difficult
---
FTFY, it's rough times for everyone at the moment
---
Hello,Entity Police ?
---
I'd take it mainly for the points. Those 4 to 7 seconds that I could save on a gen aren't even considerable.  
---
But gaining on average 2k more per gen or 800 per heal sounds more like it.
---
Why is streetwise on the corner? 
---
I can't judge this situation simply because I have not witnessed it myself. Hopefully it was just a misunderstanding. 
---
Yeah they wont see the survivor running away i swear every damn time i find the injured one because the other guy just unhooks and hides
---
Then run whispers.
---
These perks are fucking REDICULOUS
---
Meme law supersedes your own desires.......unless it's an adam.
---
Don’t get me wrong, the other games were definitely interesting. I just liked downpour the best. It’s the only game that really stuck with me. Plus it had rain and I love rain. 
---
The fuck they shouldn't do something. If something is broken, fix it. It's as simple as that.
---
WHY IS OT WHEN IM KILLER, THE SURVIVORS ARE AI CRATED BY A MONGOLIAN CHILD AND A SPIRIT FROM HELL THATS BEEN LEARNING THE GAME FROM DAY 1
---
BUT WHEN IM SURVIVOR EVERYONE ELSE HAS THE SKILL OF A WILTING CACTUS, STOP SAVING ME FROM THE HOOK WHEN THE KILLER IS GIVING YOU A PROSTATE EXAM
---
it was obviously ironical because i'm in pain and because it's kind of unpleasant that there was new cosmetics added but a really annoying bug haven't been fixed in a month. like how hard can it be to fix this eye breaking stuff? pretty sure not too hard but there were holidays and fuck community pretty much they'll just add it in a mid-chapter update. 
---
do you know that tier 2 Tinkerer was actually fixed in couple days after the bug was reported and not moved to a chapter/mid-chapter update?
---
That Adam kicked your ass and you just tunneled him, and won because of killer advantage. I don't blame the Adam for being salty.
---
I don't think I've ever played against a Legion as a survivor. If I have, I don't remember it. However, from a killer's perspective, it depends on your playstyle. Me, personally, I hate tunneling one survivor as Legion. I like to spread the pain. And, typically, using his skill in the way devs intended you to just leads to you farming up a bunch of BP, but not really getting any hooks. If you play in that way, which again is the way the devs intended for the killer to be played, it can also be pretty unfun. Especially if you get a SWF group.
---
Removed - Shaming other players
---
Thats what i said. They shouldnt fix it because because its the nature of the game and theres no way to fix it without destroying the balance of the game imo.
---
You should get a unique cosmetic for getting to Rank 1 every reset like how Hearthstone cardbacks work. So for the Feb 13-March 13 “rank season” if you hit rank 1 on Survivor you get a sweater with hearts all over it for Feng OR Ace. On Killers you get a bunny mask with a big heart on the forehead part of it for Huntress OR a Billy shirt with hearts around it. For Valentines day. So every rank season could have a unique skin and there will be a choice between two different characters so people feel unique. What a quality of life change that would be, too bad it wont get added because they could add it to the store and make thousands off auric cells instead
---
Except elements of both are true, and the devs consistantly do nothing to fix it.
---
That is actually something I can and will agree with. But then again, most of the streams, and I mean big streams, is a one huge display of someone's ego. Limits being are streamer's upbringing and streamer's general attitude towards people. Either streamer wants to make the stream about herself/himself or about people around her/him, the game they are playing and communty they are building. In current case I am pretty sure it's very obvious which one is it. 
---
*Ahem*... Thrill of the Hunt does and there's some big brain killer mains that use it with NOED because not always will they go out of their way to cleanse totems. 
---
The latest PTR patch has this bug fixed. be patient.
---
Well, that wouldn't be a problem since warewolf are basically humans with a lot of furr. 
---
Why do you post 3 of these kind of topics every day? We get it! Small dick energy.. now just go pkay the game and shut up about it
---
But... she does not though... Twitch chat is not something as a call to a friend, when you talk for 15 minutes and then forget about each other's existence for the rest of the day. 
---
The rework the nature of the game. It's universally accepted and acknowledged tunneling and camping are unfair, yet both are still in the game with little to no counterplay.
---
??? nice fringe case scenario that doesnt applyto the majority of the players. Just wait till you get better perks?
---
I watch just about every stream... She interacts pretty much throughout the games especially if someone asks a question 
---
Don’t forget cherlene
---
Yeah the biggest misplay here is not giving up on the chase in the first minute and finding an easier target. Camping when gates are open is reasonable though, since leaving the hook just means everyone will get out.
---
Fuck... i cant play pig anymore
---
Yeah i can see that. His perks also are amazing for me because when i started playing a long time ago i hates flashlights, but Franklins existed.
---
Yeah ps4 I think it was me lol.   
---
That's probably littered with moris and doodoo low ranked fodder. Show me someone who knows the game mechanics and I'll show you a sad killer. Go play f13 now that's a mans game
---
&gt; Welcome to the club, only I’m ~~31~~ so it’s way lamer. 
---
25, we are all still 25, for another 20 years.. at least.
---
What 
---
I really want to know where that 100 points goes.
---
Is 12 Hooks more than 8000?
---
Everyone agrees that some perks (on both sides) are over powered and not fun to play against, my point was more that it’s getting so incredibly boring having every topic turn into a killer vs survivor autism fight. 
---
I am a nurse main and I love the reward you get for learning her. I got to play legion when I visited my girlfriend and while playing him I just lost every kind if brain activity, sticking to one person for so long and never being able to lose them removes mind games for most of the time. The only thing legion kinda lacks is map pressour but he can get that map pressour with the iridecent button which makes him see everyone after one frenzy hit. 
---
You can't depend on the plain statistics like that, though. There are people who DC on the first down, there are people who throw, there are people who help the killer find other survivors. Hell, there are even people who'll die in SWF groups to relay information about the killer's perks to the rest of the group from what I've heard. Lots of survivors die in ways that aren't simply because the killer is powerful, or that they're good with their killer. 
---
This guy dbds
---
This guy gets it.
---
NOED activates once all gens are done so how can you just do gens when they have NOED not knowing if they have it until end game? Just a bit confused. Can you clarify please?
---
Bubba is good if the survivors aren’t good. Which happens to be the case quite often on PS4. 
---
The basis for the better spawns is now in place (on the PTB) so they can now start working on better spawns.
---
That is badass.
---
I WISH I DID
---
but i didn't know that combination of Lery's and this bug will cause the migraine, when it started to hurt it was already too late. i have migraine for 11 years and know my triggers. blinking things is not one of them. i already had this bug on me some time ago on Coldwind and it was alright.
---
Considering its still not fixed on the PTB I wouldn't say it's that easy. 
---
But luckily I haven't run into it myself yet. 
---
All we can do is wait and hope they'll find the root of evil sadly. 
---
Hope you're feeling better and won't run into this again.
---
Yeah, basically you can record up to 30 minutes of in game footage, then trim it to what you want.
---
Nah I think I’ll keep talking about it 
---
Amazing.
---
Ah man, that's rough... I hope you feel better now. I get them too.
---
I had a bing bong farming with me, and he smacked me so I thought he knew where the hatch was and was taking me, didn't bother to wiggle. 
---
The fucker hooked me. I was so butthurt lmao 
---
Looks better than before.
---
Sadly, that's not possible with reddit's native system. We'd have to delete EVERY flair manually, then input all the necessary data manually AGAIN in order to implement this suggestion. And we'd have to repeat this every time we update our flairs. The effort is not worth it.
---
That said, we're working on an alternative system which will include a search function (e.g. search "Dwight" and the system filters every flair that is related to Dwight). No ETA on that yet though.
---
No. The in-game description lists everything it does and that doesn't include vaulting.
---
James’ face is a meme and I’m so happy.
---
That´s a very good point haha. I will get the time in the future I hope. With other games if dbd "dies" eventually. And yeah I never use moris in general. I want to learn how to play against a good swf without that kind of stuff. Used them only when I was so close to being rank 1 and felt like that I need a little help
---
wait, what? in notes there's something about fixing it. did they not fix it in the ptb?
---
i mean, okay, me and my migraines - who cares. but this bug is literally potentially dangerous for people with epilepsy. either remove the killer or remove the perk if you can't fix it straight away and need time. cause i don't see the epilepsy warning anywhere on the game description. someone could have died or get severely hurt because of this shit and it's not a joke.
---
but why? its just a cess pool of salt and shit.
---
It's been quite some time since this was reposted.
---
thank you, it's been almost 2 hours, the pain dropped to 3/10 
---
Let me rephrase my statement. While such behavior from survivors does not fit a horror game, or is respectful, nothing stops the killer from chasing them down one by one. Nothing. The killer can play the game the same way find survivor, chase survivor, hook survivor. If the skill gap between the group of survivors and the killer is so-so huge that they can get away with such a cocky attitude the killer can only blame himself, as he is not hindered in any way.
---
Or maybe they should take the high road and stop doing the thing that's causing everyone to freak out?...
---
A rework of the subreddit theme, including the focus on a dark theme, is on our list, yes. You can access our current dark theme here: http://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/#nm
---
Legion is definitely a tough one to balance, given that if you buff survivors to counter-play him, he indirectly makes all other killers weaker. However, nerfing him does put him back to a less-than-viable status. One way to maybe make him a bit more fair to fight against would be to make his stun when exiting Frenzy last longer, that way, his chases aren't always in his favor. Or, on the same sort of concept, maybe make it take longer for scratch marks to reappear when exiting Frenzy. 
---
That would force Legion to take Bloodhound if he wanted to easily track after a Frenzy double hit, thereby weakening him by wasting one perk slot if he wants to easily chase down one target. 
---
Being a furry and Pig main, fuck you got me.
---
I think I've seen it listed under known issues. But not 100% sure tho
---
NOBODY CARES DUDE YOU TOTALLY MISSED HIS POINT.
---
I TOO, AM SUPER SICK ABOUT THE NOED/DS BITCHING, SO TAKE YOUR CRUTCH-SHAMING ELSEWHERE BUDDY
---
that's actually a dangerous issue. what are they thinking??
---
Nurse also has the advantage of being the best killer in the game. Given that most of the skills required to play her are mechanical and involve a lot of muscle memory, you can most definitively lay back once you are good enough, unless you are literally add-on-less, perk-less  against 4-Man Squadette with Toolboxes. Legion might have a guaranteed down, but that means literally nothing when chases with most killer last actually less than the 40~50 seconds for an "ez down", which is also bar-none the worst way of playing Legion: it hindered the edgy bois's skill ceiling AND floor, it's unfun to play as AND against and makes you rely on crutches like Frank's Mixtape (The most overrated add-on in the history of forever). Legion's ability to guarantee downs should be used, optimally, in loops that usually last more than the time it takes to down survivors (think Killer Shack, Crotuss Prenn, Rancid Abbatoir, etc.). I usually play Legion by hitting someone in Frenzy, unpopping it and then chasing them. Who gives a flying fuck you are a 110% movement speed when you can catch up to them in a heartbeat (also most people don't expect that and run randomly against Legion, even far away from pallets sometimes). Also Huntress doesn't complain that hatchets don't work with exposed because the hatches aren't exactly hard to hit, but most importantly because it's incoherent: Legion's attack is a melee hit which applies every single debuff in the game BUT doesn't work with Exposed. Huntress' hatches DON'T apply SB, Hex: The Third Seal and thus they don't count as a regular hit, whereas Legion's do, according to those perks. I'd immagine it would make it as such: if Hit by frenzy when exposed but healthy, counts as a PTR Frenzy hit when injured and nothing changes when you are injured, which if you think it's bullshit that Legion can "one shot" you in this case, he would still need two purple add-ons (SWS and Frank's) and an Exposed perk to make this work which is honestly quite the investment. Is it cheesy? Well, yeah of course. Is it bullshit? In the same way NoeD, PB Spirit, IH Huntress, PF Clown and Tombstone Myers are bullshit. And don't tell me there is counter play to THOSE addons, or even that Legion is so easy he can be played with little to no effort in higher ranks, sure, it's easy as hell to pip with them but it's sure as shit harder to get 3-4 kills consistently with them, even harder with no add-ons. 
---
Do many people have diversion though?
---
If you talk about it with salty and shitty people of course that’s what it’ll be
---
As my name suggests, I love playing as Bubba.
---
&gt;should they say “hey dont do this” and stop doing it, yes.
---
i know its a problem, but i dont think they’ll change anytime soon. i’ve just accepted it.
---
The same argument could be used to defend camping. Nothing is physically stopping survivors from rescuing each other - it’s not possible for a killer to block the hook, and if they’re skilled enough to repeatedly stop rescue attempts, the survivors have only themselves to blame. Just run Borrowed Time.
---
Except that it’s not fun and not the best way to play - either camping or fucking around. Both play styles just make the game annoying and boring for the other side. 
---
Lmao how can looping really be a complaint. It's how you stay alive
---
I'd be happy to respect it, but they unhook right after I have hooked em dammit
---
Nurse: Time to go to the gym good sir!
---
Yikes imagine being this mad over colored hair 🤢🤢🤢
---
Yeah. He sucks as a killer and he can't accept the fact that he would  finish the game without any kill.  He let his ego get the better of him.
---
Don't forget the "I'm a x main but here are my rules!"
---
Be the change you want to see in the world and don’t post about it? 
---
Ain't mad I'm motivated
---
i think an until dawn chapter would be dope but it wont happen 
---
Well enjoy getting reported and potentially banned.
---
Only camped to represent how toxic he was being. He died because he was being an asshole. It sounds like if anyone is salty here it's you
---
&gt;killer advantage
---
Explain?
---
Cold Dirt and Susie's Mixtape. Makes "frenzy, fatigue, and hit" much more viable
---
Yes it does the devs have said so, but nice try
---
i had an idea that when he got everyone in deep wound he has automatic franks mixtape it would make it so that you wont tunnel with legion
---
Going out of your way to piss off either side (no this doesn't mean doing the objectives)
---
&lt;3 and we love you
---
Just juggle. If your not near a hook they miss the ds skill check as you drop them, you have to time it right. Also even if they get off, just go chase then again. Off your not skilled enough to keep up with them, then bring enduring. Usually you can just juggle the obsession.
---
Yep I was calling them a dumbass there too xD
---
Welcome to the killcount!
---
Where we tally the victims in all of our favorite horror movies!
---
Im James A. Janisee and today we are looking at the newly released movie based from the game Dead By Daylight.
---
1. I tried leaving him, but he everyone else just sprint bursted away 2. I was on rotten fields so it was hard to find a wall to face in the middle of a corn field. 3. They all brought toolboxes, they were gen rushing. I wasn't playing "bad" they were playing toxic
---
Then hook them faster, it’s not hard. Also even if they do get off, you can just down them again pretty quickly.
---
Who made you a moderator?!
---
hit hatchets easy, play Nurse easy. then why these two are only killers i suck at while with Mixtape on Legion i do 4k without being bothered at all?
---
and you have to be shitting me  
---
noed - cleanse.
---
Beads - you can hear Rin's footsteps like Wraith's but little quieter + perks that alert you of killer's approach aka Premonition and Spine Chill. and, of course, grass if there is such. but i truly think the footsteps sound she makes while phasing is enough to avoid to be grabbed off of something.
---
Iridescent Heads - she can only have 3(!) hatchets! 3! you counter by dodging just like you do with normal hatchets. she doesn't get some autoaim or different hitboxes.
---
Pinky Finger - he has few little seconds to instadown someone IF throws the bottle DIRECTLY at survivor. just dodge, ffs.
---
for activating Tombstone Michael needs to stalk longer, needs to not mess up the click to actually Mori someone instead of downing them. and they still can fukin loop you for ages since you're not immune to windows and pallets.
---
if these perfectly counterable add-ons annoy you, you must be not so good at the game. i mean i also do think some of them are bullshit but all of them i personally countered and seen people counter very well. and my Beads decent survivors counter like nothing. 
---
but there is no way to get away from Mixtape. there's no counterplay to it. stop bringing up other things that have counters to support your weird vision of Legion. no one here said they're any good without the Mixtape. they need a rework. a full power rework cause it's annoying and boring.
---
I lost 100 in sacrafise
---
And cheaters get banned.
---
There was no walls for meters, it was rotten fields
---
Kicked gens will stay white until the progress reaches 0% or someone works on it (to which it then turns yellow)  
---
The sounds of it being worked on will also be louder, meaning you can hear them from 24m away
---
What makes you think I'm a moderator?
---
What Tyde just said...about fun for others... THEN WHY THE FUCK DOES HE ADVOCATE CAMPING AND TUNNELING?!!? Is THAT fun for others? NO. 
---
So sick of him and his warped views on a game he thinks he's good at but is in fact, just another average pleb.
---
You never mentioned that he was toxic. All you did was explain to us how you got butt fucked by survivors and how you got salty later. 
---
I don't get how moderator wotks, is that flair mean anything
---
The incentives should be to open up matchmaker to allow more than just rank 1 and 2 to get in the lobby before 90 seconds.
---
No amount of prizes make the low player pool worth it. Rank 2 is vastly better because of how matchmaking works. 
---
Why keep posting salty posts every single week?
---
 It's obvious that the adam was the toxic one in a swf i know it's hard for a survivor main like you to understand that survivors can be toxic
---
With the upcoming totem placement changes, I really think they should make it so NOED spawns on a random totem at the beginning of the match, but it stays unlit until the end.
---
That way survivors that cleanse totems have a good chance to get it without having to scour the entire map just to make sure they don't get hit with the old insta-down+facecamp tactic.
---
That's inserting objects into urethra. Fetish for sound is probably audiophilia, but I dunno.
---
You could make the argument that forcing a killer to shephard you out of the exit gates is creating time for the other survivors. I know I've opened a gate to go back and grab the killer's attention knowing I have an easy escape to stall the killer for my friends at the other gate.
---
Thing is though, if they're just staying for the purpose of being a dick, chances are you'll get another cheeky hit on them. Possible extra BP/rank points for someone trying to be a jerk? Sure, I'll take it.
---
I think this is going to be the primary use for it (especially since it'll buff all the healing on yourself). It's pretty rare I search a chest with someone nearby, but I always need someone else for those heals. 
---
Nice counter arguments 4Head
---
This is an actual juke tactic and if you pull it off... you’re a cot damn boss!
---
You are dumb as fuck. You want people to assume shit? Wow. 
---
One msg’d me, you didnt respect the 4% bro xD
---
When ur 12 but have the humor of a 25 year old
---
I got "reported for toxic play" yesterday for not respecting the 4%. 4 gens were left and he was the last survivor. I guess he thought after he got off I'll wait for him to repair a gen and find the hatch? We'll never know...
---
Just juke him at the pallet 5Head
---
And now we see the Hag in her natural habitat
---
Don't need to assume when it's obvious. Why are you taking it so personally? You sound saltier than the Adam in the endgame chat
---
true. but that's just part of the game. If i'm being chased throughout a big duration, that's just a good chance for my team to do the gens. It goes both ways. people just want to complain.  
---
Not everyone will enjoy every match of Mario Party, Super Smash, PUBG, Fortnite or whatever. Some matches WILL suck. deal with it.
---
So, I stepped away from the game just before Legion was dropped, but kept watching Tru3 to stay familiar. Take everything that I say with a grain of salt, as I don't have an extremely nuanced understanding of the killer.
---
But, in my opinion, I think the base of the Frenzy could use a change. First of all, I agree with /u/Kurazur that the Deep Wound timer should only go down when out of Terror Radius. This helps alleviate the moonwalking problem I see people upset with. Since I believe it was the devs intent to make a killer that could effectively "juggle" survivors and would want to bounce between them all as much as possible, I think Frenzy should lean into that harder. I like that the gauge refills on a new survivor hit. Then, to push Legion into chasing down the next person, make the second person hit take off 1/3 of the Deep Wound timer. 3rd person hit has 2/3 of their timer chunked off from the start, and if the Killer can hit all four survivors, the last hit is an insta down. This rewards playing as intended, and I think increases the skill ceiling. 
---
Oh. How does the hooked survivor counter camping? Please explain to us. Don't tell me that the survivors can gen rush and leave.  I am asking from the perspective of the hooked guy who is getting camped.
---
Added to this how many times do you actually see a full team with DS? Honestly, I hated it when I played killer too but at most there was 2/3 survivors with it.
---
bhvr isnt gunna listen to a bitchy scrawny white boy on the internet.
---
i’d love to see something done but i mean nothing to them.
---
*gets mindgamed
---
Make NOED only apply the Exposed status effect for each dull totem left standing on the map. For example, if there are 5 totems and one was used for Ruin and two were cleansed, the Killer will have two totems left (or two hits) that apply Exposed and then break on use. 
---
Survivors still have incentive for a secondary objective but don’t have to spend five minutes searching for totems alone while not knowing how many their teammates have broken, and Survivors will be less likely to leave their teammate on the hook because of NOED when they may have done the most all game and just got unlucky at the end.
---
I don't want to bother explaining to someone who thinks that tunneling and gen rushing are the same. You killer mains are laughable.
---
I like Freddy’s little claw swipe though ;—;
---
how are they any different ? each is a tool in the killer/survivor's hand. They get to use it how they want.
---
It's not about "can't get a kill", but if I have the choice between chasing someone who I've hooked twice, and chasing someone who hasn't been hooked yet, I'm gonna obviously pick the former. Getting the first survivor off the map is a big deal.
---
And perhaps that's not your definition of what "tunneling" is but I've had people flame me for just happening to come across them and only them 3 times in a row without hook camping or anything. Some survivors actually want me to go "oh, I've hooked you twice, well, I'll give you a chance and just leave you on this gen matey".
---
Borrowed time, adrenaline, rush from other survs, deliverance. In any case "winning" for me as survivor is any survivor leaving through the exit gate. It's a team game.
---
The killer gets rewarded a pathetic 825 points compared to the thousands that he would have earned from that survivor, and the emblem loss
---
If you want us to assume, you could have just said you hooked a guy in a swf game. Why did you mention about getting owned by flashlights and fire crackers? You can't accept shit, can you.
---
true dat. except I probably won't go for the healthy survivor if they unhook within my reach. i'll almost always go for the injured one. survivor's bad play is not my responsibility.
---
You might not act toxic but the perk can sure make the game less fun for everyone else to the point of just ruining it.
---
you can get up there the same way survivors can
---
How about that tombstone? Why is that in the game?
---
I had that with a Jake!
---
u h h 
---
Twinsies 💅🏻
---
Killer trying to secure one kill = ego getting the better of him. Alrighty!
---
You don't want to bother explaining that because you can't.
---
That sucks. You can try baiting by standing above the survivor, and just checking the surroundings. With the new timing they are either in front of you or need to rush from the back which means they gonna be really close. Until you can safely slug you can take deerstalker, nurses if they try to pick the slug up etc.
---
It's fun for some killers to actually get kills. Fair enough if you just insta-hook and camp a surv and they don't even get to play, but the guy he was chasing clearly had an active game. It's not like he completely cock-blocked him from playtime like some camping/tunneling.
---
What annoys me is as a survivor its way to easy to rank up so when you get to these red ranks where the survivor's skill is supposed to be great but you get these immersed bois who won't unhook you in case the killer is near. The type of survivor who urban evasions the entire map to unhook once they know for a fact the killer is on someone else.
---
Honestly man, there's no need to defend yourself. Play your own game and don't let people give you shit for it.
---

Bubba was the reason i have bbq &lt;3 plus he is king of the basement
---
&gt;if the Killer can hit all four survivors, the last hit is an insta down.
---
Absolutely not dude. No way. There is no counter play to him as it is. He's built around tunneling since deep wound pokes with his nerf knife are just there to delay the game. Imagine minding your business and you just happen to get the 4th poke. You're hooked then the rest end up getting slugged. I know you said take what you say with a grain of salt but this suggestion makes him more broken than he already is.
---
Been playing ever since, I manage to run the killer for 2-3 gens consistently now. God help me, I'm addicted. 
---
you earned it.   
---
though it's better to sometimes give up on a survivor who seems like he'll waste most of your time and get him later. also once you know they have flash lights, be extra careful and chase away people and do a quick sweep of the area before picking up the downed person. You'll get the hang of it with time.
---
What rank are you?
---
I don't play him much. I only just recently started using him. That's the add on where he becomes a walking mori machine right? Correct me if I'm wrong about that.
---
*2019
---
I've hit rank 1 four times now, and I decided to try to get to rank 1 killer for the first time. At rank 3 now.
---
Oh dear. I’m guessing OP used the wrong term for that then because Idk how sound has anything to do with that. 
---
I usually don't t-bag because it is a douchey thing to do. But if the killer camped someone during the entire match (not counting if he camps after the 5 gens are done), I will absolutely t-bag at the exit door until they chase me. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes..
---
You can't accept the fact that survivors can be toxic, can you? 
---
Niiceee 👌🏼✊🏼
---
I would rather people stop complaining about ds and noed
---
Thank you! ❤
---
Holy shit. A comment not from a toxic survivor main.
---
So are many other survivor perk and add ons. That’s the point of having powerful things in the game. Most killer I’ve encounter won’t DC if they see an insta-med kit or multiple d-strikes in a game. It mixes it up every once in awhile. Also, disconnecting puts your team at a disadvantage, especially when they do it in the loading screen and slow everyone down or outright crash games. 
---
You should see it on console I had to dc bc my eyes started actually hurting

I like the name btw 😉

They need to add a fedora headgear for Jeff. Call it Karma Warrior or something

[This thread](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/31262/save-error-code-300) suggest a possible reason for why this might be happening, have a quick read through it. Also, another thread suggested doing a full pc restart fixed the issue for them so give that a go too.
---
but he can "open chests slightly faster"!
---
Most Killers don't actually camp. Like, a legit camper isn't that common. Like, I've had surv otps complain about camping when they constantly come near the hook while I'm straight looking at them, or I can tell they're close due to B&amp;C or stuff like that. If you don't give me a reason to leave the hook, then don't complain when I don't.
---
Like, when I play Survivor I just run to the other side of the map and do gens, and either my team unhooked, or did gens too. Suddenly we have enough pressure to force an unhook. It's not *that* hard, especially when you're an swf
---

Yeah but the issue with deranking is that so many people do it in a ranking system that barely matters to begin with bc emblems don’t mean crap, and because of this you can literally be anywhere and you’re still fairly likely to go against someone who “doesn’t belong” at that rank. As far as you dropping I would recommend you go back to rank one. It’s seriously not much more of a difficult experience, and most of the people that join up and look like they’re really good actually suck ass and just think they’re good. Plus, you’re never going to get better and have an easier time at rank one if you don’t go play against people that will whoop you so you can practice playing around that stuff or outsmarting them. Those are personal reasons that you should, but yes it is highly unfair to your opponents that you have dropped rank so you can easily beat them, and it does ruin the fun to go against someone like that. 
---
I am a rank 1 player btw, but I play killer far more than survivor so when I DO play survivor the killer is very weak and its kind of boring for me.
---
Can't crop if she's in between the 2. 
---
That’s how literally anyone with an opinion on this game works, but still rip my man Tyde 
---
Maybe use your brain a bit and maybe, just maybe, tbag next to the actual exit, so you dont get caught.
---
I get holding out to give other players time. But when they're all standing there and I see it, I immediately go the other way. They don't need any extra points and I get enough just being a killer as is. But again this is my personal opinion on it. I totally get getting that last hit in, but for me I don't care to give them the extra bold points or whatever. 
---
this sub slowly kills me like srsly are u guys dumb ? the objective as KILLER is to kill the survivors who the fuck cares how! if i get camped so be it atleast in 90% of my matches the other guys finish gens and maybe even get out....its not just about u its still a 4vs1 teamgame if 3 get out thats a win in my book its like playing csgo killing the T with the bomb and just going away because the t's need to get the bomb and u camping it is just toxic....grow some balls 
---
Clown, the most powerful of the three by far (altho pig's more fun to play both as and against imo) and he has better perks overall (mostly bamboozle tho). pig's myc is amazing as well tho, but her other 2 perks are total crap

You're correct!
---
A month ago I saw everyone complaining about how the Legion is too difficult to play and that you get 0 kills with them and that they require skill to play them and now people are complaining that they are too easy to play, get 4K each match and they require no skill. Some of y'all need to make up your damn mind.
---
You guys really lack empathy. Can we not just agree that as killer, yes, it's sometimes annoying to get looped/DS'd/gen rushed/body blocked and that as survivor, yes, it's sometimes annoying to get NOED'd/tunneled/camped/downed after unhooked. Both universes exist. Both sides have their own struggles.
---
That's just the game, and it's not either sides responsibility to make sure that YOU get the exact experience YOU want.
---
Well I got this 16 days ago while off work for Christmas, I’m currently on 141 hours. Weed makes time go too quickly on this game.
---
We already offer a night mode for browser users: http://nm.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/#nm
---
&gt;It would be amazing if there was proximity based communication in the game where Survivors could only talk to each other within a certain radius or something. That'd at least make experienced SWF a little less cancer to play against.
---
That would only power up solos. Wouldn't change anything about SWF.
---
Everytime I'm in a match I do all the totems 😫 got no choice
---
Just black it out, theres just too many solutions
---
Thrill of the hunt doesn't affect survivors or make them need to cleanse totems, it's a bloodpoint perk which I never clear.
---
I like the crazy plays
---
So, hangman's trick is basically useless now
---
I CALLED YOU OUT BECAUSE MY POINT ACTUALLY COMPLIMENTS THE ORIGINAL POINT AND IS NOT TRYING TO GO AGAINST IT, ADMITTEDLY IT WAS WORDED VERY POORLY 
---
THAT SAID THANK YOU FOR BRINGING SMALL GAME WHILE PLAYING SURVIVOR, YOU DA REAL MVP I HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY
---
Nope rank doesnt mean shit.Most people derank on purpose anyways.You are probably playing with fellow rank 1s but you dont realize it.
---
Yeah, the poor nurse eventually got tired of me and flat out ignored me. Literally refused to hit me as I walked up to her to distract. 
---
I don't know.
---
I'll start playing her when rank reset hits
---
There aren't enough Archer memes in this world
---
You shouldn't be trying to touch the totems then 
---
Legacy nurses are mean people.
---
I agree it makes it more intense. But theyre so common now, it doesn't feel special while still denying the most fun part, the chase.
---
There are no facecampers at rank 1 and rank 1 players don't get 360'd. 
---
I think I like watermarks now.
---
Haha very true
---
But can resist the flaminess?! 
---
Not really I've seen Rank 1 players on both survivor and killer do things that would literally make a rank 20 shake their head in shame.
---
Honestly given enough matches a potato could get to Rank 1.
---
On stream they said they weren't and would probably become a separate perk 😁
---
All u need is the beads then it is
---
Can’t be any faster then the 30 seconds ruins lasts anyway.

I dont now where the argument that camping gets 3 kills every game came from. I never gave you a number, and I never claimed that camping is a good strategy. Do not put words into my mouth. Hell, I never said camping is good for the killer, at all (although it turns out that way surprisingly often). I said that camping kills fun for everyone (or at least for every survivor), while having no fair way to counter it. That was my claim. Even if (face)camping only gets you 1 survivor kill, it already killed something bigger, the match itself. Killers fail to secure kills by camping because, they themselves fail: losing focus, not timing their attack properly, going for the wrong target... or a surprise adrenaline or BT etc. But does my previous sentence really matter? It doesnt. Does escaping camping - stacked against unfair odds - every once in a while make camping acceptable? A few survivors getting away justifies all those lost minutes in a match where the killer plays a surveillance camera instead of going for chases?
---
I also never told anyone to "git gud". My claim was, that pressing ctrl repeatedly does not hurt the killer in any way. You can chase a survivor the exact same way. If you cant get a teabagger, you cant get them without them teabagging either. It makes 0 difference. Zero. What your fragile feelings may or may not find offensive does not matter.  If seeing a character crouching repeatedly hurts you as a person you might need to grow up. In fact, getting the killers attention this way is a completely legitimate strategy.
---
Camping someone to make the kill easy, and, lets say, writing in the game chat that "gg easy" are at an incomparably different level. One might hurt your fellings, the other one might hurt your feelings AND prevents you from playing the game. It is like insulting someone, then (someone else? is) getting shot in return. Neither of those things are nice, but they are on a different level.
---
From a distance it might look like that im defending survivors who made their goal to make the killers experience miserable. Im not doing that. At the end of the day I just want the devs to make camping an extremely undesirable/impossible choice from the killers perspective, under any circumstances. Treating butt dancing even remotely close to this - IMHO- game breaking "strategy" is just really sad. Removing it would make the game incomparably better, at the very least for 4 out of 5 players.
---
🗿
---
Anyone can get to rank 1 if they use noed. But some rank 10 players are SO bad that they still manage to only kill one.
---
For a second i tought you were talking about lyth, which also makes sense
---
Meme of the year
---
DS is massively stronger than NOED. You have to put 4x DS on the scale vs 1x NOED considering survivors are a team while killer is a solo team.
---
Piggy is getting a buff, show her some love
---
That's just wrong 
---
Wait is there an actual achievement? Cause I didn’t get anything :D I’m on PS4 so I don’t see too many nurses lots of Billys though :D
---
I should make some really dumb promise that if X happens I will crossdress cosplay Feng.
---
Yeah. Survivors are literally just skins and that sadly won't ever change. 
---
Not gonna lie, every time there's an overly angry post on Reddit about gen rushing or survivors being OP I imagine it's by some Huntress main that didn't break a safe pallet and got looped for 5 gens.
---
Monster killer could do to prevent decisive strike is to dribble the survivors a hook if they are lucky enough to be close.
---
Now you might say decisive strike will only by you 10 seconds or so but you would be surprised what 10 seconds can actually do with a game that's time based.
---
Mandatory perk to run: Spirit Furry
---
I think the better option is DLC, it technically saves you money
---
That's the other way around.
---
Yeah but then you don't need to use ruin, everyone would be going around doing totems at the start of the match.
---
Actually let it be a solid perk. Let Exhaustion recover in- and outside of chase with it.
---
F
---
That isn't a bad idea. I am not sure it deals with the main problem people are annoyed with, that there is no counterplay to be had for the person being chased, but changing it to actually give value to spreading out your hits is a good idea.
---
understandable, have a great day.
---
And they put sloppy butcher on.
---
Those kinds of people are what mori lists are for.
---
Swap that BBQ for DH. Fun times. 
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
Doesn't look like anything to me. *smiles robotically*
---
Clown or Pig
---
its a good idea on paper but in practice I'm sure at least 1 person will DC every match.
---
I just added you, my psn profile is a fish.
---
Noed is the counter to ds. Ds kills all momentum as a killer while noed gives you back momentum. 
---
Yeah that is the one limitation I’ve found 
---
Claudette mains are the worst mains though. :( every true survivor main knows Dwight is love. 
---
K
---
U in school?
---
Yep
---
Same
---
Change jeff to dwight plz
---
You make it seem like facecamping with noed is a good strat. Do totems, play safe and hide if it activates. The problem with so many survivors is that they play like lemmings and get steamrolled by noed because they are commiting to gates when they know that noed exists. You should treat everygame like noed, bbq, nurses etc exists, thats how you win.
---
This isnt even mentioning all of the perks and strats survivors can use to save from hooks. A killers cannot, if the survivors work together, prevent a hook safe. If the survivors want they can get a guaranteed save and have no one go down. 
---
But the alert is only for hex totems and the cleansing speed isn't really a huge problem
---
o thanks its a combinaison of stab wound study and mixtape. My bad its actually stupid wtf.
---
DOING GENS, YOU?
---
Seems like alot of the 20xx cards have issues
---
The rule changed, all a posts needs is to be recognisable from the picture or the title that its about dbd, since this post mentions hex totems i believe its following rules.
---
The problem I see is not their excuse it’s the astounding lack of ability to admit they are breaking the rules,
---
Yes they are google dead by daylight EULA and take read.
---
If they didn’t learn basic morality as a kid then there is no debating with them at an “adult” age, because you are debating two different things.  They are 20 years beyond help in most cases and they are being enabled by 1000 screaming white knights in diapers.
---
I fuck up all the time but at least I hold my hands up and say, yeah I fucked up I didn’t meant too and I won’t do it again. 
---
But whatever Behaviour should step in.
---
Yup. Once you go t3 you can Mori if you get within grabbing distance (no hooks required). I couldn't believe it was in the game when I tried it out
---
P R E A C H
---
Still doesn't make vigil very good
---
are you kidding? dedicated servers will fix every problem ever
---
With the new self care changes no thanks, I let my team down enough already
---
NOED is the counter to Adrenaline. 
---
Name checks out.I agree with your point.But at least at rank 1 most survivors do gens lol.
---
When they have bbq and chili yet they decide to only camp one person lol
---
Just run small game 4head
---
No, really, run it. It helps quite a lot, especially if you’re new or not used to new maps and their totem spawn locations. 
---
I have ENOUGH time to spend dealing with tier 3 madness, all my teammates damaged with Thanatophobia affected by Sloppery Butcher and the killer using ruin which is hide somewhere in this "gideon meat plant" map
---
So NO I still cry cos those kind of trials are the ones to leave as fast as you can.
---
Also I didn't mentioned the 3 frames per second of the Skilcheck
---
did you admit that the pig is poor?
---
Or maybe, just maybe, you’re a bad killer. Just because someone disagrees with you it doesn’t make them salty survivor mains. 
---
My friend just bought the porkster *oink* *oink* *oink*
---
Make it so there can't be two of the same killer. Two nurses would be downright nasty.
---
Claudettes must suffer painful sacrifice 
---
You should have pulled over next to them and say "Where's the optimization patch!" Then instantly regret that when they lose it on you.
---
Switch ome of those to Discordance and youre pretty op
---
- bbq and chili
---
- Hex ruin(best when combo'd with haunted ground)
---
- A nurse's calling
---
- Discordence 
---
- Enduring
---
- Save the best for last
---
- Spirit burst
---
- Sprint burst(or lithe)
---
- We're gonna live forever 
---
-Leatherface Camper with NOED
---
Self care, sitting burst, hope/empathy, and either urban evasion or unbreakable or boil over.
---
Because no one had the idea until now
---
Momentum is a big part of success as a killer. It is the most reliable way to counter genrushing. Being able to always have atleast one survivor on a hook can force 2 people off generators. Having even one survivor use ds on you early game can snuff out your momentum and easily allow 3 gens to be done before you get another hook. 
---
The big contributing factor to your momentum is how fast you can find down a survivor, thats why perks like nurses, bbq, and all instadown perks are high tier. They either help you find survivors or help you down them. Noed is arguably the best instadown, it triggers reliably and at a time when survivorrs are forced to complete 1 of 2 objectives making them predictable. This can lead to very fast downs with it.
---
A killer who has lots of momentum will almost never make it to endgame, but if there momentum is stopped by perks like unbreakabe, adrenaline, deliverance, and decisive strike, perks that help survivors out of a state where they cannot contribute (hooked or downed) reaching the endgame is very likely. If a killer is good and perks like these arent used, noed will have no effect, but if these perks are then the gens will be powered and noed will activate, allowing the killer to gain  a huge amount of momentum.
---
So while they arent direct counters like calm spirit and spies, or iron will and stridor, from a gameplay standpoint, noed counters ds.
---
Glad I'm not the only furry who loves pig. 
---
There’s skill required in survivors looping ?
---
ANY TIME A GENERATOR IS FIXED ANYWHERE ON THE MAP MY GAME NEARLY CRASHES AND IT'S PRETTY WELL UNPLAYABLE FOR ME NOW
---
Excuse me?
---
SMALL GAME IN DBD, BIG GAME IN LIFE, RIGHT?
---
I think it'd be better if instead of regressing gens for the future survivor, the banked gen repair should go towards the amount of time the killer can spend disguised. 
---
My Claud is level 40 so no probably not 
---
Killer v. Killer games rockem sockem robot style
---
Just a minor clarification:
---
&gt;It also gives the killer an alert when a survivor begins cleansing a [**hex** totem](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_Thrill_Of_The_Hunt).
---
Funny story, I was playing as billy last night and I got bullied by a David all game and he t-bagged me in front of the exit gate and let me rev up my chainsaw because he had Dead hard I ended up rubbing against him and eventually downing him in front of the exit gate. He got what he deserved!
---
No thanks, I takes like a week to get back to rank 1, let me enjoy my few games at green ranks
---
Wow... Really... Really ... ?  
---
"I was just baiting"  
---
Jesus dude learn to lose.  
---
I said the same thing as you when I saw the post, but saw that I was wrong and edited my comment.
---
Just because you can't abuse vigil to get sprint burst 20 times in chase doesn't make it a bad perk.
---
He will pay for insulting the Dwight. 
---
LEGION IS SO ANNOYING TO PLAY AGAINST I'M ONLY WAITING FOR THE GAME TO BE OVER WITHOUT SCREWING MY TEAM
---
IS THE FUCKING MEND BAR SUPPOSED TO KEEP ON DEPLETING WHILE I AM MENDING MYSELF? YEAH THAT ALLOWS FOR GREAT COUNTERPLAY WHEN I GO DOWN IF I  KEEP ON MENDING AND GET HIT, OR STOP AND GO DOWN BECAUSE THE TIMER RUNS OUT.
---
AT LEAST I CAN OUTPLAY THEM AT PALLETS AND WINDOWS, RIGHT? /S
---
Remember this when you see all the posting and complaining with people who DC or kill themselves on first hook :P
---
Thrill immediately makes me seek out every totem on the map (pressure allowing).  It immediately makes me think killer is pairing it with another hex perk, and cleansing dull totems while Thrill is up allows you to cleanse hex totems faster.
---
this is so fake she saw you multiple times you were doing survive with friends 
---
Exactlyyy . Call me cheap but $5 for nea pink hair alone 😬 nty. But I want it so bad lmao
---
I saw this on ifunny last night
---
An above average ruin wasted by RNG survivor spawn feelsbad
---
Incorrect, survive with friends has all perks at level 3. Try again lol
---
But mending isn't healing, remember?
---
lmfaoo
---
I think the main issue, apart from only SWF who cleanse totems, is that you don't know it's active until someone gets hit, leaving you a looot more cocky than you should be sometimes.
---
Sometimes it’s worth it to make the ultimate sacrifice 😞😞
---
then que sniping. either way this isnt a real game or a real killer trying to win a real game hes in his line of sight 2 times. closing the locker he would have seen teh other door closing. opening the locker at the end animation wouldve seen teh other door opening. try again
---
"Just camp your Ruin"
---
I cry everytime ;-;
---
I don't need to read replies before I make one of my own.
---
And that's relevant to this how?
---
They're already working on the solution. It should be fixed once the PTB is over in a few weeks.
---
k
---
Nothing it's amazing 
---
I have no idea what que sniping is, but this is a real game. The whole vod should still be up on my twitch if you are that worried about it. 
---
*legion then activates power and hits you regardless leaving no room for mindgame
---
The difference is that survivors want Killers to give them freebies if they get lucky or close. Killers just don't want bm. And this is coming from someone who plays a lot of both 
---
How about we don't make anymore exclusives? The devs themselves said they didn't want to make anymore exclusives.
---
Looping takes a hell of a lot more skill than pressing m2 and being guaranteed two hits. 
---
It can be used on every map, just not effectively. It is straight up OP on some maps however, so much so that I can’t believe killers keep chasing me with it.
---
Thing is, it doesn't.  
---
DS produces loss of momentum  
---
NOED produces gain of momentum  
---
I agree on that and that is where you are correct. But having two things do the opposite of another doesn't make them a counter. Counter means to negate something. Does NOED negate the momentum loss? No. It simply gives you momentum gain. And not even based on wheter or not you lost moment to DS or not. It gives you moment gain either way.  
---
Enduring+clown gas counters DS. Noed counters Adrenaline. The momentum loss the killer suffers through DS is never negated through NOED, thus NOED doesn't counter DS.
---
Dont you know? All 5 gens need to be finished in under 6 minutes so they could open an exit and tea bag you just before the escape line. To be fair, most survivors Ive dealt with just accept it. The only ones I've gotten whiney messages from are P3 Claudettes with a purple flashlight, Adrenaline and Decisive Strike. And honestly, I'll 3-4k most matches so NOED just ends up being a wasted perk slot. 
---
THIS IS SOMEHOW UPLIFTING THAT EVERYONE IS YELLING AND DISAGREEING ON REDDIT BUT IT ENDS WITH A YOU DA REAL MVP GOOD JOB FOLKS
---
What stream?
---
Looks like a 13 year old's Minecraft house
---
Ah, yes, him having to stab you 5 times instead of 2 really is broken. 
---
Yeah I know. I like to drag games out for the most points possible. I ran infinite ew3 with Judith book or tombstone or whatever it is that makes my ew gain faster by stalking the obsession. Oh boy that was fun. The game ended in 3 minutes and not a single gen was done. They legit let me just stare at them because they didn't know what add on I had equipped and they probably thought I was farming or something. It's strange what people do on the other side of a pallet when Myers is just standing there. I'm just like "Mmmm feed me." At least no one dc'd and took it like a champ. I got 18k points that match. Feels bad. Normally I get 60 to 80k per match on my pig just by dragging the game out and not running instant down perks. 
---
This is therapeutic my man
---
Because killers have terrible framerates im told try getting rank 1 killer!
---
I USUALLY PLAY KILLER BUT HAD A KILLER RAGE QUIT WHEN ALL OF THE SURVIVORS WERE ABOUT TO EXIT, UGH IT SUCKS FOR EVERYONE 
---
JUST STOP RAGE QUITTING PEOPLE
---
I'm gonna be honest no killer in their right mind are gonna pretty much tell the survivors to just pretty much giver up. I feel like survivors are a little more guilty here. I see WAY less salty Killers than survivors after game
---
No, totems don't need to be removed, game designers just need to change totem spots or spawn spots, or both, so that you don't spawn next to any totems.
---
Don’t complain about DS if you pick up obsessions or non-obsessions
---
Literally spat my coffee everywhere thanks a bunch
---
It's also stupid that snapping out of it is considered a healing effect and show up on nurse's. 
---
Its right behind that bush now.
---
I wanted to die first
---
Just don’t play him. Please for this games health I beg you.
---
you know, that would explain a lot if i was 
---
Holy crap 
---
I know, and thats a really good totem spot on the game too.
---
After game, you might be right, but on this Reddit you just need to take a quick look and there are a lot of killers that just want an easy kill. And anything that denies it is BM. 
---
Really???
---
This is where I get screwed up a bit, I'm assuming you're seeing all 4 at one exit, so maybe my experience as a survivor doesn't apply - I'll be at the exit with one (sometimes even two) others, and I won't know what's going on with #4.
---
I don't want to abandon them if they need help, but I don't want to just waste time if they are at the other exit waiting for the same thing.  
---
I HATE LOSING THEM WHEN I SPAWN AND HEAR A CHAINSAW THEN BOOM DEAD NO MORE ITEM
---
Aliens
---
That's way better.
---
They fixed this in the new patch 
---
I fucking hate the glitch especially since I play on ps4 and holy crap does it fuck with my frames! My frames drop and I get a headache. Feel bad man. Take care and I would take a break and wait until it's patched. It sucks but you're better off that way.
---
Yeah Im on ps4
---
Running Ruin and Devour together without thrill is stupid. Ruin makes them totem hunt, and Devour is a stealth Hex.
---
Maybe think laterally before you blame your poor builds onhex spawns.
---
You don't need to but it helps prevent commenting about it twice or three times.
---
Well that hardly to never happens but every killer nowadays have noed
---
It's always been around but no one really explicitly talked about it. Recently there was a \[reddit post\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/act27v/streamers\_deranking\_on\_purpose\_and\_then\_are\_toxic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/act27v/streamers_deranking_on_purpose_and_then_are_toxic/)) that called out Jendenise, a twitch streamer, for deranking. This sparked some debate and there were two podcasts done by DbD content creators: \[Tofu's podcast\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjSPT-sL7E0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjSPT-sL7E0)) and \[King's podcast\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBp4G5kCmo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEBp4G5kCmo)) , with some drama going on over at twitter since some content creators started taking things personal.
---
Needs more cosmetics
---
Just work through ruin. It really doesn't do much if everyone is on gens. If you find it going to another gen? Great, break it. If not? Just do gens.
---
Dedicate servers realese date:
---
3,768 player base on steam
---
They will quit the gsme for ever lmao
---
Fucking master chief lol
---
Happened to me multiple times. On PS4.
---
Can you please tell them to crank that Tony Todd aka Candyboi
---
So much sodium! It's fucking with my heart! 
---
Actually more blinks is the only good add on using range add ons fucks with muscle memory and makes you worse off. 
---
Tunnelling isn’t his issue.
---
Excuse me wtf, the Pug is not the best killer
---
Oof
---
Sloppy Butcher/Thana aint very good but its used. Thats all Vigil needs. To be somewhat useful
---
Rank reset should send everyone back to 20
---
Whenever I play like this I don't give a damn what happens in the game and I'm tilting less. Makes the game much more enjoyable. 
---
You hardly ever have a game against a god nurse. Does that mean its okay that she is broken overpowered?
---
Understandable. If I see 3 or less I'll go in and chase them out of the game. But as I said I like me my blood Warden, and if I see all 4 in the gates I just go hide in a corner. 
---
I guess my own little rule is more for myself and more of a pet peeve than anything. And I usually play more killer than survivor, so when I survive I personally just leave the game as soon as possible. One so I can start a new game. Two because I dislike it when people do it to me as a killer. (three because I originally played Friday the 13th and it's more everyman for himself in that game.) But like I've said this is more the little rules I've made for myself.
---
*Billy sobs ;-;
---
Put a mori.
---
I didn’t read your whole post but Doc being tower tier is like the most common opinion
---
It’s basically a necessity unless the survivors don’t try for gens at all. If there’s no ruin then two gens get done practically immediately if your killer needs time to gain power or isn’t very fast
---
Jeff sounds like he’s been smoking since 12
---
"Try &amp; correct me" 
---
There is nothing to correct when you didn't put up any valid points that could be argued against.
---
I’m just gobsmacked you think running around an object is difficult compared to aiming at high speed with blurred vision in corn. 
---
As of this moment there are 25k playing on PC
---
Assuming you choose to tunnel someone down (which most legions do) you are as long as you have a very basic understanding of them game. 
---
Activate power, get first hit and reload ability, get second hit. 
---
Good on u. He deserved to be punished for his greed
---
*hugs* you’re okay now my child..
---
OOf
---
It’s pretty sad lol.
---
Maybe try a controller.
---
Horrendous fps.
---
Hard for one person to find all the totems... but if all were to cleanse a totem as they passed them it wouldn't be as rough
---
To clear things up i have not played the game.when i save the money and i buy it i do plan to play more killer than survivor.what i am getting is that a hex perk is a more powerful than a normal perk with the downside that survivors can disable it.By running a hex you are taking a risk.If survivors are so annoyed by a hex then they should be out looking for the totem.
---
I meant that cause it seems to be a disliked opinion. But his style is definitely different which makes me like him. I would say I have a decent amount of experience as a survivor but as a killer not too much, to which legion had recently made some changes
---
So get your eyes checked? 
---
As someone that suffers from actual migraines I call bullshit, clearly you're just seeking attention. 
---

---
DS punishes the player who for winning the chase and can DOUBLE the length of a chase, so an actually good player who managed to get away for 1-3 gens can turn it into a full gen chase.
---
They did their job initially, a good chase, 3 gens are down.
---
They shouldn’t get a SECOND chance to do it again when they didn’t do anything additionally, it’s a skill shot that we all can hit that rests in another free escape except this one has a built in stun. 
---
Ok fair point
---
You obviously don’t play against good survivors.
---
and then Dwight remembers Discordance exists 
---
The blessed child
---
Controller sensitivity as well.
---
I got to rank 1 killer in a matter of a week of first buying this game, if you know what to do the wins are easy for killers.
---
Most killers including me use ruin because these teams lately will have 3 gens popped in the first 30 seconds of the game and you maybe just found 1 survivor if your not running this perk, heck even with ruin have had teams come in and pop 2 gens in 30 seconds at the start of the match...
---
Just dc. Screw that noise
---
How can you have such a strong opinion and not even play the game even lmao. You should play survivor first get to high ranks and try to do as you say then report back here. Honestly i mean it im curious to see if it'd sway your opinion.
---
Prestige him
---
I made a Joke :(
---
broke=no money 
---
no, you don't understand me at all because how you changed my words in your favour is either intentional but stupid cause they're literally there or you didn't understand me. 
---
you know, it's funny. the person i attacked, by your words, actually showed that they're immature and can't use arguments to support their position and can't argue someone else's opinion or be constructive at all, you know. that's funny. 
---
but here is me, not calling you names, not being nonconstructive in my arguments yet i am immature and wrong. while YOU were the one to change my written down in this very thread words as if i'm delusional and just want everything to my favour.  
---
You know how when first playing the game, survivors emidiatly try getting off the hook by themself? Well, first game I ever played: first time trying it, get off. Never kobe'd after that every again. I for example had a 3 player game against nurse. First guy gets hooked, but kobes off, second guy gets hooked, but kobes off, I get hooked, proceed to second stage -_-
---
ok so get rid of anything that one shots a survivor, anything that kills a survivor before their third hook. lol
---
If you've played the game for more than a day, you'd realize that at red ranks, ToTH won't deter survivors, and won't help you protect totems, unless you want to defend those totems and lose all your gens.
---
ToTH has never stopped me from killing every totem on the map in under a few minutes. If the killer uses ToTH to rush at me, he's the going to lose all of his totems, and probably a gen or two.
---
I'm gonna cosplay Pig, make a trap to stick on my roommate cosplaying a survivor, and chase her around NYCC this year
---
you're right you don't. and non of us should expect the other side to play any certain way to be honest yeah. So long as it's not griefing/trolling that it punishable by the devs, go nuts.
---
I too chose to play differently occasionally. mostly when someone disconnects. Because that really sucks for the survivor and puts them at a big disadvantage. So it's not fair. I either turn it to a farm or let them win a chase/gen or something.
---
OH BOY
---
I like playing as him and pretending it's Scary Terry.
---
Pink jeans for the win.
---
That’s how base exhaustion should work, only not going down while running while in a chase.  Also killers exhaustion addons, at the very least, should go down while in a chase, since it can literally take a perk slot away from you.
---
Should have put Doctor there instead. 
---
There no way to know if they have it though so your counter play could be for nothing and waste time.
---
She isn’t overpowered because you need to put a lot of time and effort into her not like bubba or clown. And yeah im rank 1 i play against god nurses from time to time 
---
lol yeah i've been doing this for ages so it's getting tired so i have to go to even more extreme measures which usually gets me banned quickly but it's worth it :( ps4 noobs are so stupid lol
---
My killah. 
---
Same build as me in terms of perks. I might replace BBQ with Huntress lullaby or ruin but I have neither. 
---
Also I LOVE using BBQ with railgun doc (high stim electrode and interview tape.) as you can zap people's auras from a shockingly (pun sort of intended) far range after a hook. 
---
Agree tbh, at most in my experience it gives them an extra 10 seconds lmao. Not to mention half the time if the survivor isnt the obsession they don't get chance to use it, because the hooks are so close.
---
You do know that porn belongs to dbdgonewild, right?
---
Ah, I guess it's just RES nightmode that doesn't work.
---
Thanks.
---
Wasn’t there a guy on here who had a pretty cool Meg cosplay a while back? 
---
But they still get rewarded
---
I rarely see legions playing the intended way but maybe that’s just me.
---
I’m not saying it’s bad that people do this but you can’t deny that it takes little to no skill to play legion in this way and from what I’ve seen and heard that’s why most people like legion. They don’t struggle with killing people because the way his power works essentially feeds them free kills. 
---
He never should have been added with his current power. 
---
Never realized you commented on my post Scoot.Im a fucking idiot btw.
---
&gt; She isn’t overpowered because you need to put a lot of time and effort into her  
---
Thats not how good balance works. 
---
Lol but eh, I’d totally do the same if I had more time and a console for myself or if it was running on my PC... Aside from RDR2 it’s the only game I’ve been playing for the past 5 months but I’m only at 200 something hours 
---
[*What does a mere mortal matter to a god?*](https://imgur.com/PCMCeea)
---
Did I stutter!? 
---
Or Heaven on PS4. Assuming said nurses don't disconnect after failing to down anyone 3 gens later. 
---
I never trust anyone who says they play 50/50.  Sounds like fake news.
---
I thought that was changed now so it wasn't visible using Nurses...
---
Maybe with dedicated servers will be able to get a mode like this. 10gens 8survs 2killers and change it to 3 or 4 doors to prevent camping
---
Yeah, that would be stupid, luckyly it is not true
---
Give us Alfred from bloodborne, I wanna walk around carrying a giant wheel as Michael Myers stalks me
---
It wasn't concidered healing, but it did show up on nurses, untill Legion came out, you can't see it anymore
---
Last match I had a game where I got hooked pretty much at the start of the match and then the Killer proxy camped me. When someone finally unhooked me the Killer immediately came and downed me again. Thankfully I was Jeff and I run Breakdown so when the Killer picked me up the guy who unhooked me tried to bodyblock for me. When I got to about 70% struggle the Killer dropped me to go "listen here u lil' shit" to the guy who kept dodging him when he tried to swing while carrying me. I got picked up and by that point there were only 2 gens left.
---
I had Aftercare as well and holy shit the guy who unhooked me was looping the killer that whole time. I did the last gen as fast as I could and felt really proud when I saw two people run away with Adredaline. (Could see everyone with Aftercare.)
---
Guy even had NOED but we cleansed it and distracted him while the one guy with Borrowed Time unhooked the other Survivor he was camping. We all tanked hits for the Survivor to get to the exit gate.
---
I was going to self care in front of his face but accidentally left early. The guy who unhooked me teabagged until everyone else left.
---
This was at red ranks so of course there was a lot of "baby killer" and "trash camper" comments in the post game chat.
---
Shouldn't it be the other way around?
---
Nice! 
---
A few high profile players, who purposely de-rank to make them selves look good beating newer players. 
---
Oh, bless your heart
---
They cant balance at all dude. Just look at all the killer and survivor updates
---
To be even more fair, since the hook-density changes a non-obsession won't trigger it anyway.
---
I don't know, I don't play killer so I haven't checked. One of the people I play with who does play doc was talking about it with me
---
New Self Care is only on PTB tho.
---
I super hope they fixed it lol
---
Rework of it got promised by the Dev twice already and they still try to find a way to change it. Nurse is broken as shit overpowered (if mastered) and doesn't get changed. So why does DS get reworked?  
---
Because its op and easy to use.
---
You know what else applies pressure? Hooking anybody. Bring in the altruism. Unless they have kindred, 1 or 2 will come running
---
&gt;snapping out of it is overrated
---
lol'd
---
I was going based off your other comment, maybe you should've worded it better. Bye
---
I had a 5 gen chase the other day against a pig because there were like 3 pallets she never destroyed that I’d loop. All were safe too. I never got hit during it, but she got me with NOED at the end. A tale as old as time
---
Ok got it. Does that apply to all hexes?
---
How did you get a ps4 clip in here. I can't seem to find a way to do that.
---
I was joking :(^but ^like ^even ^more ^:(
---
They removed that like 2-3 patches ago.
---
Healing has a cap of 100% speed. So tier 3 we'll make it is all you really need.
---
Cleansing dull totems is detrimental except you make sure to get all 5 cleansed. It's better to remember their locations and go check once noed is active. A thousand times I've seen survivors cleansing totems and then not finding the last one for the rest of the match so you make noed much more difficult to find once its up.
---
Exactly haha
---
All killers are equal.
---
\&gt; Hit Hatchets easy, Play Nurse easy
---
I said hatchets are relatively easy to hit, which with the bullshit airplane hitboxes they kinda are: Huntress is my third most played killer and I've seen very few people, even in red ranks, who can reliably dodge a fully charged hatchet. Nurse isn't easy as much as it's muscle memory: again, it's not easy, but once you learn her it becomes easy. Muscle memory is a skill you aquire and you lose with time, by playing Nurse you become better at Nurse and games become more laid back. You don't have to sweat your heart out if you know how to play her.
---
\&gt;  then why these two are only killers i suck 
---
Well, no shit. You are bad at the killers that require muscle memory - which needs practice - to be good, who would have ever guessed. Legion isn't very mechanically challenging, but neither is Spirit nor Myers nor Hag.
---
\&gt;  while with Mixtape on Legion i do 4k without being bothered at all?
---
Well, I don't fucking know, it's a killer that doesn't require a fuck-ton of skill to be good at with a great purple add-on? Geez, I wonder how you could do such a feat.
---
\&gt; NOED
---
Yeah you could just clense every single totem, but imagine playing alone in a lobby with randoms "Well I clensed 4 totems myself, surely my teammates have at least got one, right?" - P.S.  This happens more times than you think. You can call me bad and whiny because I don't go around checking the entire map thrice over for all the totems just in case a person as a perk, but obviously it's my fault really for not wasting half the game making sure the other three guys I've been teamed with have done their job.
---
\&gt; IH
---
LOL JUST DODGE THEM 4HEAD. Hey, just a question. What if the guy who's throwing the Axes still has a functioning frontal lobe? If he's a Huntress worth her salt and she's in red ranks, trust me, dodging the hatchets becomes more like "Have you been blessed by the gods of broken hitboxes?"
---
\&gt; PF
---
LOL JUST DODGE THEM 4HEAD. Again, if the Clown is good and isn't fucking stupid, he hits at least one out of them all. Or if he's not that good, he closes the distance in a loop, goes like 2 inches from your face, hits you in the face with it and then down on the ground.
---
\&gt; JT
---
I get that you can loop a Myers, but what if he plays like EVERY OTHER MM PLAYER EVER and holds EW until he's breathing down your neck, pops it and then Goodnight Irene. The counterplay to that is pray to your god he doesn't have Enduring and Spirit's Fury.
---
\&gt; PB
---
Oh wow, Spine Chill counters Spirit. And Calm Spirit counters Doctor, and yet people complain about how annoying he is all the time. It's not like I always have Spine Chill on because I'm psychic and now the guy is playing not only Spirit, PB Spirit; AND EVEN THEN, even if you know that she's looking at you, you don't know what direction she's coming from, so it's not really a complete counter, more like a soft counter.
---
\&gt;  if these perfectly counterable add-ons annoy you, you must be not so good at the game. 
---
Oh fuck off, says the guy who thinks Legion with fucking Frank's Mixtape is overpowered. You think the Mixtape is overpowered but have no problems whatsoever with IH Huntress? I think you are the one who's pretty bad at the game here, playing against potato huntresses that never hit a single hatchet, or maybe you are a potato huntress yourself and see nothing bad with what's widely considered the most broken add-on ever.
---
\&gt;  but all of them i personally countered and seen people counter very well 
---
I also escaped multiple Frank's Mixtape Legions, belive it or not. Let me be clear, I do think it's an UNFUN add-on, trust me, I've been to the reciving end of that. I'm saying it doesn't make Legion nearly as strong as you think. Unfun? Yeah, what you said and more, but OP as PB or IH? Nowhere close. Does it make Legion Strong? Yes. Does it make Legion stronger than Cold Dirt + Joey's Mixtape? Nope (Trust me, try that shit, you have like not even a second of stun out of FF, it's more broken than the mixtape by a mile).
---
\&gt;   no one here said they're any good without the Mixtape. they need a rework. a full power rework cause it's annoying and boring.
---
People wanted Hag to be 115% movement speed and look at that, top tier killer without even touching that. People wanted Legion to be 115% movement speed not even realizing how fucking stupid that sounds. People are saying that he needs a full-power rework, not even a fucking month he's been out; I say give Behaviour some god-damn time to fix stuff, they know it's annoying when people tunnel with Legion because it's very hard to lose them, this sub won't shut up about it; they will do something to touch on that. Surely they don't want the killer to be about tunneling and I see that, having played a fuck-ton of Legion in the " weird vision " I have about the killer, and it's the first one I brought to P3. I played him perk-less, add-on-less, fully decked out and with every add-on and I had the most success with this "weird vision", It's the "weird vision" that allowed me to stay competitive (meaning being able to actually kill people) with him; maybe I'm delusional when I say that for me they are fine, maybe it's the way I play them that makes me feel like they are fine, I feel they just need some tweaks and they'll be perfect. I'll keep playing in my "weird vision" because people I play against aren't irrationally angry like most people on this sub against Legion. If you seriously think Behaviour implemented this killer just to tunnel the fuck out of people or to moonwalk your opponent to death, I want to remind you that he used to have a double stun hitting a deep wounded person. And it got removed because people on this sub complained about it. They didn't fully rework the power then, they didn't fully rework the power now and sure as shit they aren't going to fully rework the power later. They never did and I don't really feel they are going to start now. Sometimes, just a bit of tweaking is required, but maybe it's the "weird vision" talking. Kudos anyway.
---
Yeah everyone knows that killers that require skill are poorly designed, and that brain dead boring killers are great
---
Yeah it's almost always a dead perk when someone else gets the obsession. The most raging thing is when you manage to trigger it, land the skill check but noooooope too late the killer began the hooking animation one quarter of a second ago. 
---
What's a clown?
---
That Haunted Grounds was embarrassing lol. 
---
I understand. But the better you get the shorter the chases get as well. I like legion cause you can either chase, or mindgame. Though a good killer can do that with everyone. But with legion you never know if he's after you or the next one, with others it's 90 percent of time the one who got hit
---
Is it good to save a couple of traps for the end or should you apply them all ASAP? 
---
Jake Park to the rescue!
---
DON'T COMPLAIN
---
DEAD INSIDE
---
Lol get to rank 1 survivor and then you can have your opinion about NOED. I'm sure you'll just end up being that wraith that does nothing all game then pops noed so he crutches his way to rank 1 then complains that he's still bad. 
---
But I've seen some snipetresses. Huge admiration towards them
---
I know, sorry I was just poking fun back lol
---
I know what you are trying to do but I don’t understand how it relates.
---
Yeah pretty much, people are just downright obsessed with the idea that this perk should focus on recovering exhaustion like it used to because that was the biggest reason people used it. They need to forget about the past, forget about this perk's unintentional use and come up with actual ideas.
---
Don't fall for the bot!
---
You sketchy bot. 
---
Only living bodies move so as a killer you want to kill a wiggler. If they don't wiggle "oh shit I grabbed a dead body" and throw it in the bin (hatch). This is what I always tell people post game as killer. At least it brightens up people a little after a 4k. No killer wants to kill and already killed person. That's no fun :). 
---
Lost their credibility after posting this idea that is already beaten to the ground and admittedly a pretty stupid one too, it's just has more effort put into it.
---
Noed was on like a 2min timer back then. Everyone knew to just sit back and stealth until noed was out. It was way easier to counter back then. 
---
LeChappa w/ Andre the Giant outfit in DBD when?
---
Clown is the best but pretty basic  
---
Freddy is fun but the worst  
---
Pig is in between
---
What we need is more perks to courage anti-camping and tunneling and maybe a better spawns to totems. Imagine if a totem could spawn to basement/ locker/ actually inside a bush? 
---
he means out of them
---
Just play your favorite killer and use the BP from them to level up other killers. Eventually I will play survivor once I get all the perks. Eventually...
---
Yes, that is exactly what I stated.
---
Rank is more about how much you play than how good you are. Better players will rank up quicker but mediocre players will reach rank 1 if they play enough. 
---
Yes nerf fire up pls
---
Wait, they buffed the flashlights or is this a bug?
---
Needs an upgrade, I think you meant Doctor + Iron maiden perk
---
He didn't have Wake Up equipped as a perk. =(
---
That's the point, dick-cheese. 
---
Its a known ps4 bug then haha how do they frig up a killer like that though
---
From OK to Not OK, love it.
---
Fire up too stronk, allows daddy myers to break my wood too quickly.
---
👏 Fix 👏 this 👏 fucking 👏 shit 👏 thanks 👏
---
I recently had a game as Wraith where not only did my totem spawn in the stone circle with that one gen on Red Forest but when I went to check it *there was already a Survivor on it.*
---
I burnt an Ultra Rare addon that game and I basically didn't have a fourth perk due to this game's crap RNG. Seriously totem spawns need fucking fixing.
---
Toxic community tho
---
I feel like a lot of people commit too hard to using a chainsaw. If people are looping me I'll just M1 them and get em eventually. If I catch them out in the open I'll chainsaw them. Camping is a waste of time and is just asking to lose lol. 
---
I just think he's pretty underrated despite having an instadown ability and still having 115%MS
---
“That we can all hit”
---
Speak for yourself, haha. I can smash ruin and overcharge skill checks all day, but the pressure of hitting d-strike screws me up most of the time when I run it. 
---
It was intentional if that helps you decide 
---
Why not just teleport survivors straight onto the hooks when the game starts?
---
Quentin is a support survivor, not a looper. IMO Maybe get rid of the exhaustion buff and just focus on other things.
---
Yeah no one would have much honour haha 
---
I wouldn't mind giving her the family she always wanted ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Nah, I like not being punished for getting legit 4k's.
---
Because it’s very possible to pop 4 gens in one chase even without ds used. 
---
Noed isn’t the equivalent of ds. Noed just means you actually take the time to take out totems and suddenly almost like magic the perk doesn’t actually work. Noed is more like the hatch except it takes his perk slot and can be shut down. He can’t close hatch. We can deny his end game desperation event. Moris are just killer toolboxes. It’s there to make his objective go faster after he jumps thru those hoops. His objectives that all have telepathy and have brains. 
---
and then theres Noob3 in the corner playing with Nea
---
Yup. 
---
The No Mither survivor teabagging the Rancor Survivor as they got Moried. Fucking nice.
---
Noup there are more than 20k players 
---
Yeah I've met some looping gods already and I'll usually ignore them in favor of the gen jockeys. I know Leatherface isn't that good and I prefer Myers or the Spirit over him but he isn't as bad as people say. I probably won't play him as much at higher ranks though haha. 
---
generic doctor build.  I say take out Distressing for Iron Maiden.  
---
Ok that’s assuming they are miles away. Who’s assuming now mr smarty? If they are nearby it can be more advantageous to hit multiple people and slow down the game forcing them to mend, as well as going to down the person you are chasing is how you play as a killer? Like why wouldn’t you chase someone and down them? You must be a really bad killer if you don’t do that
---
You can't do that Doctor man that's illegal.
---
I waited an hour for one match for the killer to dc last night. Ps4 struggles. ;-;
---
Well then tell that to the SWF who yelled at me for "camping". You cannot stop people from throwing those miners around, it's to the point that they're meaningless.
---
She is the only grown ass adult woman with shoes in the game. Meanwhile Nurse is so broke she had to learn to levitate to not need shoes
---
Doh! :/
---
all killers would have zero honor then 
---
You called him childish because you threw your OPINIONS at him, and he said he didn't care. Those are opinions not facts. Get your head out your ass.
---
Since almost every one of these buffs is already addressed by add-ons, would the add-ons all stay the same or would they be changed too? For example, if you significantly increased his base chainsaw movement speed (and made Award-Winning Chili actually do something) then could you conceivably create a Legion Frenzy-speed instant-down Bubba train?
---
You mean every single day. 
---
Oh wow. Seriously? This is your defense? "I parrot what this guy says and try to police the community to enforce this thinking and I can't be wrong when doing so!"
---
Grow up.
---
"If you won't listen to me I'm gonna sacrifice you myself."
---
I just hit 500 hours two days ago. I started playing in early December. 
---
Fire up needs to be straight up removed that perk is ridiculously OP smh what were the devs thinking putting that into the game 
---
Yeah I only bought him for BBQ for the double bloodpoint week. I got so many puddings and streamers when levelling him up that I played him a few times and found out how effective he actually is. 
---
Stop taking life so seriously you only have one
---
People still look at that tally screen?  I just play for fun, dont care about pips or rank at all.  You'll enjoy the game 100 time more if you do the same.  
---
If you consider the gens your sole objective. It is not. As a survivor it is our role to do what we need to in order to survive. If that means doing totems to increase our chances then so be it. It’s a perk that helps slow down the game. It’s just like say self care or med kits where we slow down the killers progress by undoing his damage. It just does it differently
---
That's when they're salty you kicked their ass.
---
Does nothing happen when you are afk as killer?
---
&gt; Why not just teleport survivors straight onto the hooks when the game starts?
---
I like how this dude completely ignores that -good- decent Survivors can get all the gens done and leave in less than 5 minutes. And that's even when you're using Nurse. If you're playing an SWF squad then even with Nurse you might kill 1-2 of them. Maybe you'll get 3-4 if you're really good and are using an Ebony Mori. 
---
Why did he camp tho?
---
(it's a joke)
---
This is a super fair and mature response. Are you on the right sub?
---
Good god my eyes
---
You should just change one thing and never play the doc again, thanks! Hope this helps
---
They did omit voice comms, but here they are. I know that sounds mean, but it’s really not. It’s unfortunate to an extent but it’s now unavoidable. Hell, they could just send invites to the randoms if they aren’t a 4 man and now they are. Your best bet is to just practice and gain the experience and wisdom that allows you to counter it, just like they said. It’s honestly that or just uninstalling the game as this is something that will never change 
---
Monto was looking for something like this to replace the Perk Wheel (which doesn't support the now &gt;50 perks in the game) and said he was willing to pay for it, so you might be able to get a buck or two for your work. Check out his Twitter.
---
it was more of a joke, you know. i enjoy this humor and happy to have it.
---
I got down voted for it, but checking the previous patch notes it seems like Snap is not shown by Nurse's anymore. 
---
Honestly its such a joke.
---
Almost as much of a joke as people down voting this clear shitpost
---
“You can run but you can’t hide, bitch”
---
Then they go against a bunch of Claudettes
---
Maybe you should reflect on what you are doing wrong and try to improve instead of blaming the game. Survivor is not fun to play anymore, and if you were in charge of updating the game no survivor would play anymore
---
Fwiw I enjoyed the shitpost
---
Fire up too op no counterplay 
---
omg, you're more annoying and needy than i am, holy heck. consider yourself a winner, really, my respect. i love arguing and love long posts but i literally got bored and tired reading that sheet you typed out.
---
Aww. I’m a mod for HybridPanda’s stream. We don’t ban people for disagreeing. We ban people who come in with the sole intention of being dicks and starting drama. There’s a difference between saying “Streamer, I think you’re being rude/toxic when you do xyz” and “Streamer, you’re the worst content creator ever and i hope you kill yourself.” I don’t understand why people would ban for difference of opinion as long as the discussion is civil. 
---
It's the hair that holds you back
---
So, I do play for fun. Which if we get a shit-headed Killer or even alike a shit-headed survivor teammate. It's not as fun. Sadly it happens often.
---
But, I am one who can't but help look at stats. Because stats are true, they are supposed to be at least. Same thing with ranking. If the game is going to give me to option to see how well I did. Then, I'll look. 
---
But, in this game its also a big slap in the face to see your bar literally under an ending point of the marker and it somehow just not give you the nice Shiney badge, especially if it was what would've saved me a ranking or gained a rank. 
---
I'm a rank 1 Killer and 4K almost all the time with Billy because I'm forced to use Billy because the rest of the Killers are garbage and I don't enjoy using Nurse.
---
Maybe you should reflect on the fact that the game's balance is absolute dog shit and is still massively Survivor-favored especially when playing against an SWF squad using mics. 
---
TL:DR: Grow Up.
---
Long Version: Thank you for agreeing I'm right and you're trying to impose your totalitarian viewpoint of what is and isn't fun.
---
I don't agree that the devs have done nothing to fix it. They removed killers being able to block people from being unhooked by face camping. They've removed nearly all infinite's. They also made hooks respawn so survivors couldn't sabo a ton of hooks and just run over to that area every time. All those things in my mind were pretty toxic gameplay that they have changed. 
---
Other languages arent allowed here. Also you can add people from other countries too :)
---
Probably deliverance seeing as it's Adam.
---
Well Sabo still has no real incentive and because no one Sabo's, Hangman's Trick becomes extremely situational. 
---
But if They finally gave Sabo some real incentive, this perk would become stupidity powerful.
---
That's basically what I said ;) 
---
then what do you do? you chase that one guy for about 1 minute and he cant do anything about it.
---
It's in the game. I have purchased it and use it every game.
---
It's been here since before the winter event came out.
---
I hope it fades abrupt stop is obvious af
---
He kinda looks like ace visconti Lmaoo 
---
Intense Myers airchoking and stabbing
---
Don't agree with the DC thing but you're right about the rest.
---
Yes, you need to play more. It took me a month to get the full hang of it. The more perks you have, the better chance of killing. With you just maiming Spirit, you are very limited to what you can do if you don't try other killers. 
---
Trying Survivor too helps you become a better killer because you get to know how they act and where they go. 
---
Trust me, bear with the game. Rank doesn't mean you are amazing. The only time I rank up as Survivor is being altruistic; most of the time I don't escape. 
---
Just because you are going against high ranks doesn't mean they always escaped. The game rewards those who do a lot, and that includes killer and survivor. Survivors must do as much as they can to help each other, and Killer needs to do well with predicting survivor movements and having a good build that controls the game. 
---
This is awesome! One thing I think would be nice to have is if the randomize killer or survivor button chose item and offering too instead of just perks. I hope monto uses this, that would be dope!
---
the only way to get better is by losing, you will slowly try to learn the mechanics, and the little things that you can achieve with a killer, sadly we all started that way, in 4 days there is no way you can be a top player, on the other hand, when you start winning matches agaisnt the same people you were loosing agaisnt it's so incredibly satisfying, also, the spirit I'm sorry to say it, but it's not a begginer killer friendly starter, I would suggest trying someone easier, eitherway you have to master all of them but try to play with someone different. this is a game of practice, no matter how good the other player is, and how well ranked, if you have enough practice on you, you can easily kill survivors, as they don't have many means to escape you once you hit them at least once, try to get the good perks that will help play your play stile, like for me butcher is a god damm send, even though is not considered a top tier perk, in my play sile it helps me so much track survivors. another thing is that this game rewards you for playing even if you loose, because you get some blood points, so the more you play the better perks you'll get. 
---
PC. Audio bug, things like survivor footsteps, screams upon being injured, and loud noises from killers such as the Nurse’s screams are either really quiet or just muted. Have restarted dead by daylight 3 times in order to try and fix. Might just reinstall
---
:( They should have kept that and deleted Frank's.
---
*\*cries in legion\**
---
Tydetyme made a video on it and then a couple other prominent people in the community made a video with their opinions.
---
Why now? have no clue but it’s here.
---
Spirit is already Billy tier. In fact she's better
---
*confused beeping*
---
Meyers has to work for his insta-downs; NOED rewards bad killers who are losing with insta-downs. 
---
I had one of these last night as well, playing as spirit, noed (don't @ me), phased to the exit gate and saw a Kate just sitting off to the side, too far to fall into the escape area. Hook'd.
---
I agree with Freddy, clown,wraith and trapper but the rest are op. The hag and LF do need a buff but not as major as you mentioned. 
---
Don't complain about my NOED if you didn't even got the second gen
---
It's mega crutch and rewards a player for playing bad.
---
in my opinion one of his problems is tunneling bc he is unfun to play against bc theres no counterplay when youre being tunneled.

That's why running ruin with NOED is so good.
---
The only objective should  be gens.

They could infect you with some disease and make you find parts for a cure if they decided to. It would technically add a new objective but it would still be shit.

It's really slow anyway too speed up the animations?
---
Cause I had a ritual to do and lobbies were fast so there was no point sticking around - got into they game as a surv though and god did I sandbag.
---
You are wrong.Here is the part of the lore that says it.
---
Susie didn't want to do it. Frank shouted at her; they had to finish what they'd started. Julie closed her eyes and slid the knife into the man's chest. She handed the wet blade to Susie: they were all in this together now. Susie stared at Julie in disbelief as Frank grabbed her trembling hands and inserted the knife deep into the man's throat.
---
Just remember, bro.  Hard for me to remember, so I just cleanse them.
---
I always assume noed until shown otherwise 
---
Downed survivor outline animations, when being viewed by an upright survivor, are upside down. Seen on PS4, not sure about other platforms.
---
You're the one bitching about downvotes. 
---
Monto might be using it,message him or something
---
Just hit goods, its still faster than gen tapping, plus you're being a bit of an ass by tapping. 
---
Um....what is noed ?
---
One thing I’ve learned with 4 man SWF is that they tend to be hyper altruistic because it’s their buddy on the hook so I use that to my advantage stay close to the hook but not enough so you’re “camping” and pick them off one by one. 
---
No, we all know BHVR doesn't care enough about clown to put him as their flair
---
I've never wanted to learn how so I still have no idea 
---
Killer gets 4 perks, survivors get 16.  Killer perks can afford to be significantly stronger since they take up 25% of one team's slots.  Once DS is used, the survivors still have 15 other perks up. Once NOED is used or destroyed, Killers have 3 perks left.  It also makes the Killer team play the whole game with 3 perks beforehand.
---
Learning how survivor play is great to counter any groups and probably the best way to beat them, swf group have some big weakness....they tend to be overly altruistic(to a stupid extent) and some groups if one of them die, they all pretty much give up as they wanted to play and escape together. 
---
Ive seen many 4 man solo be far more effective than a 4 man swf.  As they 4 man swf usualy has a couple weaker players.
---
Just dont get hung up on swfs and use it as a excuse
---
You’re not Satan if you’re burning a Bloody Party Streamer. You’re doing god’s work.
---
Still worth only half of a perk slot
---
You can't just hook them faster. You need to be lucky with hooks. Also, you can't just down them if they're good at the game. A 2 or 3 gen chase can be extended to 5 gens if the DS user is a good player. 
---
Maybe first the optimization patch, then they can add anything they want
---
Well diddle my biscuit, how did I miss that? Lol.
---
I cant understand one single word, but i know whats going on ! 
---
The Spirit is awsome :D
---
I was playing as tombstone Meyers. Accidentally mori'd someone instead of hooking so they opened both gates. One of them was dumb enough to teabag instead of leaving. You don't teabag tombstone. That's just a braindead thing to do... needless to say, he got grabbed on the last pixel and stabbed through the heart. Threw his ass out the gate too, just to spite him. Very satisfying. 
---
Imagine playing Chucky on Coldwind
---
*all of the above*
---
Doctor also hold his stick wrong, when you watch him as surv he holds it between both hands will lightly tapping it, from his view he's only holding it with one hand not moving it at all
---
No one escapes death
---
Just some further clarification before I'm asked later, yes this is a real game and I am playing. No, I don't know how they didn't see me. I know he sounds like he's dying, but he's in shock haha. Yes, the nurse hates me now. I do not blame them.
---
Well generally you run it with another hex and the cleansing speed can give you just enough time to scare them off the totem if you're playing a killer with movement powers.
---
I got Hag with dying light, remember me and insidious. The tool wants me to be an ass lol. 
---
I think the OP has lost it....really needs to take a break from DBD 
---
Probably being sarcastic
---
You should post it, I’m sure a lot of people would find it useful.
---
But how? I can't really think of anything because his power is basically so trash that it has no real application. 
---
Like Bubba is pretty shitty but at least he can play basement defender better than any other killer. Freddy's power is asking for permission to hurt survivors ....and that's it.
---
I mean, you still have to know what to do against them, so when you're getting into killer they're real annoying. I only really started being able to deal with them a few days ago when I watched a video on how. So like, they aren't good, but they punish not knowing about them.
---
It’s not mine and I can’t exactly recall whose one it is! But I will post it once I find out. Don’t want to take credit for something that isn’t mine. 
---
I hear ya. Good on you.
---
Delete him
---
"Every killer 4k almost all the time" is not a balanced game. I really hope you understand that.
---
But that means you don't go for easy hook saves, then, which you should at least try.
---
I dip whenever I see NOED active and I'm at the gate though.
---
BBQ Stack &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hatch

Sorry ☹

Because it’s a fact you learn from being streetwise
---
But at least the bamboo is in patches. There's too many patches, but it ends. Coldwind is just endless god damn corn.
---
Wrong, chest looting
---
The Clown is the better of the three, Pig is getting a buff but still not as good as Clown. I wouldn’t buy Freddy under any circumstance.
---
Yupp, lol. My flair give it away? Btw what does my flair say?

r/DunderMifflin
---
Started playing a week after launch in 2016 and I'm at 1250 hours. Took 2 fairly long break though of about 2-3 months.
---
What exactly is new?
---
Probably needs a break from the computer as well.
---
Cause you know, bbq totally doesn’t reward you for doing your job. 
---
If you read past the comma you would see that they brought it to gen rush
---
this.. can _still work._ 😂
---
Yeah, this needs to change. Was playing a Leatherface game and I ran straight for my totem and I literally could not get there before it was cleansed because someone spawned right next to it. Like, they generally make sure the killer and survivors don't spawn right next to each other, I'm sure they could do something for hex totems.
---
A good rule of thumb is to never buy characters with Auric Cells, it’s better to get them from the store because sometimes the set comes with some extra cosmetics. For instance if you buy Laurie, Tapp, and Quentin from the ps store they’ll all get an additional outfit. If you buy with auric cells you will only get one outfit. Plus you can get a set for $8 from the ps store whereas it would cost you $10 in auric cells.
---
I play claudoot and I started on her because I was always a medic in games and empathy and botany knowledge let me do they better then just Bond and now with the new clothes thicc thighs save lives
---
That’s how mafia works 
---
I mean honestly, if your only going for a draw then yeah, facecamping with noed can easily get you two kills making it an ok strategy.
---
It does already though... everyone in 8 meter range is effected
---
Both at once, just different players
---
Thats an amazing idea. Still wouldnt make me use it, but amazing idea
---
SWF using voice comms in a game that isn't balanced around them is unfair, but here we are. 
---
True, I was talking about running it by itself. It’s definitely useful when combined with Ruin, Devour, etc.
---
naw not salty at all, killers are salty over DS to the extreme but are perfectly ok with being able to one shot survivors and moris.
---
That's right. That's why you have to cleanse all 5 dull totems to prevent it from activating.
---
*Immediately shines flashlight before sprinting to the next pallet*
---
I'd rather fucking die than use tiktok
---
Excuse me what the fuck
---
Buff *Nurse*??? Lol, this has to be some god-tier shitpost or something
---
The guys such a clown... I really don’t see why he still has such a following, though in this case I don’t think what he said is that outlandish.
---
Basically.
---
I'm like 95% sure the killer was just memeing, pretty sure he nodded at you at 0:10-0:11.
---
If not that dude must be legally blind.
---
I mean it’s a difficult task to cleanse all 5 but it’s high reward if the killer is running NOED, and means that the killer used only three perks as one of them never went off. It’s fine the way it is because it encourages survivors to participate in a secondary objective or risk defeat. It’s not mandatory to escape but it limits your chances if you don’t do it. When I run NOED I don’t particularly care whether it does or doesn’t go off because if it doesn’t then it still bought me time during the match in which people weren’t on gens, sorta like how ruin works but with all five totems and it doesn’t actually inhibit the speed in which gens get done. But if they ignore my totems and straight up gen rush me then they pay the price and get 4 man slugged in the final seconds of the match.  
---
Coulda been avoided lol
---
Dude, Franks mixtape is light years better than susies.
---
((NOED))
---
Y? You have 5 stationary gens to do. A killer has to hit 4 moving intelligent (assumingly) people each with the capability of using something different for him to deal with like 3 times each. Gens are way easier to do then catching someone. I mean we pop 3 gens usually before the first chase is resulted in a hit. Sure that’s rank 5 but still I’m gettin there. 
---
It’s 4 seconds after crouching.
---
gen rushing is a made up thing doing generators is the only objective as a survivor
---
Just wait until you get to play against SWF that has a key. Pure cancer.
---
You need meta perks like BBQ and Nurse's to counter SWF. If you run Ruin, you need a counter totem like Haunted Ground or Thrill Of The Hunt out there, because once one of them know where it is, they all know. Figure out which player is playing what "role" and adjust your strategy accordingly.
---
There's this meme here that SWF is a bunch of ultra altruistic dumb dumb players, but that's not true. Not until the end game at least.
---
SWF breaks the game, but it's an unfortunate reality, and it's not that big of a deal if it's just a two person SWF 
---
NOED is the only hex that will appear after gens are done, so no,  it doesn’t apply to all hexes. 
---
Once a claudette did this to me while playing as clown and somehow i climbed up there and rekt her
---
Facecamping is a mad up thing hooking survivors is the only objective as a killer
---
Maybe because leatherface is all you see on console
---
Step 3:   Hex: Haunted Ground
---
That sounds a bit too good
---
At that point you probably would’ve won anyway because they would’ve wasted too much time searching for totems and never finish gens
---
Survivors who don’t play killer are always the first to complain. They don’t know what playing killer is like so it’s impossible for them to understand
---
Survivors get 5K BPs
---
300 comments
---
This'll be good
---
That is not true
---
She prolly also had decisive strike and thought she could get the bar high enough to use it. Then DC’d when the hook was too close lmfaooo the entity is pleased
---
The audio mix  has been bad since 2.4 dropped because of the engine update. 2.5 should help fix things.
---
He went under heavy fire over his 2.3.0 tier list and that’s where it really started to snowball against him but apart from that I personally don’t mind his discussions. I don’t watch him for his gameplay because there are many other content creators that provide a more engaging experience, but his opinions about the game are quite respectable and well founded. (most of them at least ahem tier list) It’s often his presentation of those opinions that gets him a lot of hate.
---
Is this the power of the ultra instinct? 
---
Did you really just say looping and playing pallets properly takes no skill? It takes people a long time to be able to do it properly. Legion is a braindead killer you play if you cant win with any other killer.
---
I've played lots of player so on the rare occasion I do have to play Survivor it's a bunch of "Sorry that I have to do this to you man" when against the killer.
---
Maybe don't blame the killer for your friends unhooking you in front of him
---
This has so many possibilities 
---
Precisely
---
Console has nothing to do with it lmao
---
While it's a bunch of pixels representing a made up world, no one lives there :)
---
I literally see the killer going away and coming back to me every 5 seconds when im on hook and this happens to me with every 3rd killer
---
Why the fuck would you even need to buff killers?
---
It doesn't have to ruin the game if you're not a lil' baby about losing. The survivor entitlement around tunneling is hilarious, it's no different than getting gen rushed out of a match. A five minute game lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you left it. 
---
Her: come over I miss you
---
You: I can't. A freaky murder is in that area.
---
Her: My parents aren't home
---
...
---
haha it'd be ridiculous, but i'm in the camp of the game not needing to be perfectly balanced since  killers will never face each other.  they just need to make him powerful enough to be balanced against survivors.
---
Next Hillybilly: 
---
There is no more hillbilly only chainsaw
---
It still notifies you when they begin sabotaging a hook.
---
Enduring doesn't disable DS. Not even close to the same thing, lmao.
---
Even if he could 1 shot and if he could move at 120%, you wouldn't see shit but cause of the grass. 
---
SHIT I FORGOT TO TEABAG
---
But 4 flashlight squadette.You dont understand our struggles.
---
lol I love the whataboutism that comes from the NOED arguments
---
Yes , I get autohaven maps all the time and I hate them.
---
How about a separate queue pool where leavers play with each other
---
It says "Now that's the Spirit!"
---
That's assuming you are facecamping to the point where you are there when they are in the animation of unhooking. I'm often times about 5-10 meters away when someone is unhooking in front of me, too far away for the grab, but close enough to stop my victim from running away
---
Well you are certaintly living up to your name but your toxic attitude aside im not saying its overpowered im saying it promotes un-fun gameplay. For one the guy on the hook already fucked up enough to land themselves there and has now slowed the game down for the other players so whoever decides to save him now has to be exposed for the next 60 seconds for playing the game. Of course the killer still has to catch you but in reality i've seen a lot of killers just wait it out far enough for the person to get unhooked come right back down that person again and slug them then go after the exposed person. So sure that guy whos slugged is living longer but 1 its completly un fun for him and now someone has to go save him so now only 1 person can even work on a gen and that's if there isn't a ruin up which lets be honest there always is. Forget about it if its the nurse. You will always have 2 people downed pretty much.
---
Yes it's literally broken. The devs know and they know how to fix it so this won't be showing up on the live update.
---
&gt; It would be great if there were other hex perks that make you go for dull totems, but at the moment, going for dull totems is against a single perk out of many the killer can run, and takes up a large chunk of time to do.
---
That's the entire point. This is like saying *"chasing the healthy survivor instead of the one that just got unhooked takes up a large chunk of time to do"*, well obviously. 
---
I make sure to face a corner so they can't get Chase points
---
Leather face or Lucky Luciano?

I forgot my locker 
---
Lmfaoo accurate 
---
Pretty concentrated effort here to undermine his complaints, this community doesn't appreciate "uppity" killer players. 
---
Why did you block out your perks? If you have insidious I may have found the problem
---
Unfortunately it's sort of unavoidable. Some high rank players just like being assholes to low rank players. I'd recommend that if you find 1 or 2 survivors are way better than the other survivors, just ignore them. If you see anybody else, go for them instead. They all do gens the same speed, so going for the people who are the worst at looping will lead to faster downs and then you can more easily pressure the better survivors, who will have to rescue their friends.

Increase dream state transition to a base 10 seconds, decrease movement speed to 110%, and remove stacking of dream transition reduction items and nerf class photo add-on to only reveal the location of survivors inside of a small fixed radius.  HOWEVER, for each survivor currently in the dream state, Freddy receives a significant buff to increase his power.
---
1 survivor in the dream state:  Freddy’s base transition reduced to 7 seconds, his movement speed is increased to 115%, and sleeping survivors heal, sabotage, cleanse, and repair speeds are reduced by 50% (basically, 1 survivor in the dream state means Freddy is equally as powerful as he is now).
---
2 survivors in the dream state:  Freddy’s base transition reduced to 5.5 seconds, his movement speed is increased to 118%, and sleeping survivors heal, sabotage, cleanse, and repair speeds are reduced by 50% and they cannot use any items in their possession.  Awake survivors attempting to wake a sleeping survivor may be prompted with skill checks which, if failed, will result in the awake survivor being placed into a dream transition.
---
3 survivors in the dream state:  Freddy’s base transition reduced to 4 seconds, his movement speed is increased to 120%, and sleeping survivors heal, sabotage, cleanse, and repair speeds are reduced by 60% and they cannot use any items in their possession.  Awake survivor attempting to wake a sleeping survivor will be prompted with hard skill checks which, if failed, will result in the awake survivor being placed into a dream transition.  Survivor auras are not hidden by lockers or their own perks.
---
4 survivors in the dream state:  Freddy’a movement speed is increased to 121%, sleeping survivors heal, sabotage, cleanse, and repair speeds are reduced by 70%, and they cannot use any items in their possession.  The two survivors who have spent the longest time asleep now suffer from the exposed status effect.  Survivor auras are not hidden by lockers or their own perks.  Sleeping survivors cannot escape through the gate.  You’re in his world now, bitch.
---
I'm going to use this later
---
This game never ceases to make me laugh with the weird shit that happens 😂
---
Nope, stable 80 fps here (I play on Low)
---
Maybe its only while walking?

Constant clacking sound when Leatherface is selected/played

If that’s the case then it should specify that, I’m sure you would agree.
---
ofc salty survivor mains use this thread to whine about killers
---
feel ya bud
---
I swear we had the same killer. I was getting in and out of a locker in front of the killer and then he just ran off
---
&gt; the I'm not in a chase even though I'm chasing you build
---
Is there video of this?
---
And what does it do ?
---
DBD casefile; the pig.
---
What's some good perks on him? I'm having a hard time finding a build
---
Dollar Tree Claudette for life.
---
I have to say, I really love Freddy. One of my favorites. Takes some adjusting too. Also he's like, the worst killer. But he's real fun once you know how to play him.
---
This man is either for some weed or some puss
---
maybe that's why you constantly jump - so you can see.  honestly that fits his maniac of a character
---
Uhh utilizing survivor altruism once the gates are powered are literally your best chances of getting sacrifices, which is...oh yeah the whole point of being a killer. Your ego is astounding in how the game "must" be played. I have a feeling based on other comments you've made on similar posts I've seen you on, that you get caught frequently trying to style on the killer and then bitch saying they're "tunneling" you or didn't respect my 4% etc...
---
Rank 1 survivor here noed its ok ds is very op 
---
Are you a good person...
---
On the internet?
---
I must catch you and put you in a zoo!
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Maybe its his turn in the trial and thats what happens while we load
---
BBQ, M&amp;A, Ruin, Thantaphobia, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, Discordance, NOED (scrub oWo)
---
very cool
---
There's also not a lot of games where you take the role of a supernatural murderer, so survivor mode feels like the 'main' mode to a lot of players, I think that feeds into some of the entitlement a bit. 
---
All killers? Hell, no. Weakest ones? I think it's a good idea. And I think top-tier killers needs some nerfs for their add-ons (baseline powers should stay... for now)
---
If somebody's being an asshole I don't see anything wrong with telling them so.
---
Very cool! Only thing i'd say is add the option to disable perks so you dont get perks you dont have but looks very promising. Thanks for your contribution!
---
Even if you had punishment for misses, you could only use that for counter play against people using Legion poorly. It wouldn't fix the root issue that is awful power design. 
---
Wait. Doesn't changing the dps cap get you banned?
---
they be all clumsy falling off their hooks. Just helping them back up, it's really a civil service.  
---
"Don't go that way, nothing but the edge of the map!"
---
Are you.. gate keeping tunneling? It's ONLY tunneling if you do xyz and then they do ABC? Get out of here, man. Keep telling yourself excuses. People get tunneled at the hook, away from the hook, doesn't matter. Tunneling killers will always tunnel. It's their crutch.
---
Yeah I know that it‘s random :)
---
I just I think it‘s really weird that lately I I always get the same map twice.
---
Just wondered if someone else had this issue too. I know I‘m not special haha :)
---
I didn’t get to experience it for long, I got the game just before the Hag DLC was released. I’m just going off of friends that had the game longer than me
---
Shouldn’t it be the Doctor giving him the news? Nurses don’t typically provide medical results to the patient. 
---
watch the clip
---
shes looking at him before she hangs the body
---
she also nods at him when hes in the locker.
---
This is why if I'm going to give someone the hatch and they start wiggling when I pick them up. I stop and shake my head a few times.  If they keep wiggling I head to the closest hook.
---
I think it's because Leatherface players, by in large, tend to be toxic af campers with basement and/or Insidious builds. So every time a survivor on console sees one, we just assume they are trashy, asshole killers. Sorry that you get lumped in there, but it's the cold, hard truth.
---
It depends if you step on a crow stepping on a crow calm spirit or not we'll make them fly away.
---
Same goes with killers in their stealth mode like a cloaked Wraith or a crouched piggy won't alert crows unless they actively you step on them
---
You bet he did xd  
---
real hidey boi
---
if 2 people are running Prove Thyself, only one of them will have Prove Thyself in effect so it doesn't stack. 
---
I’ve had that happen with ping. Killer does 80 to 687 in the 5 seconds when you can’t leave 
---
I'm ok with NOED because I think it's had a positive effect on the meta, the threat of it slows down matches without having to increase boring M1 generator gameplay. The killer is also handicapped with three perks for 95% of the match, assuming it activates at all. You can't really remove NOED without making dull totems worth cleansing otherwise, or adding another objective for survivors to do that would slow down matches. 
---
If this is true, the description should be updated to reflect that.
---
then all you get are broken keys :(
---
even on an x for me the frame rate makes me physically sick. the clown update ruined frames and I'll never get over that until they fix them
---
None of those are quit worthy...
---
Wait you run Franklin's standard? It's usually a situational perk (if they're bringing in a bunch of items)
---
It was active. You can tell by the perk on the bottom right.
---
Why though. I payed money for that killer. Just so some dickheads dc why should I waste that. Although I pretty much always get at least 1 dc a game I really like that killer
---
How does this glitch even happen man I love this game
---
Yeah, I would much rather just cleanse them as I see them, and thats what I tell my group of friends to do as well. Its better for the killer to just never get NOED popped and potentially get a free kill from doing nothing.
---
I agree that it isn’t overpowered and I’m a devotion 4 killer main. It’s a minor inconvenience that occasionally pays off in a major way, and when it does - good for them. 
---
Yeah, and they fixed some bugs too (hopefully Sloppy butcher as well) so it can't be worse, right ?...
---
Thanks for answering anyway !
---
That’s why I let no survivors hatch anymore. Take ya lumps.
---
Yeah we can, DC'ing from a match is lame, it screws over teammates and the opposition, both. 
---
Yeah, I used to run unrelenting but I found Franklin’s useful as survivors always find flashlights in chests , don’t know if I’m unlucky or there just really common 
---
It aint easy being sleezy
---
new best shitpost in this sub hands down
---
Im happy in most matches, as long as I dont go out like a bitch.  Im sure you know those kind of matches lol
---
definitely not cheating, just very ~toxic~ and generally not appreciated in the community. as a survivor, it kind of ruins the point of the game if you dont really have a chance after youve been caught once
---
Camping is not cheating. I know it kinda of makes the campy hate the game( I hate camping) but it gives the other 3 time to do gens
---
Damn this person plays dead by daylight a lot! lol
---
I can’t attest to the difference of the xbox models, but I can tell you the difference between playing on a base model PS4 and the PS4 Pro is staggering. I imagine the Xbox One X would be a huge improvement as well.
---
my 'personal' pip, not the actual game pip.  During the event I'd play legion and have games where I hook everyone twice, lots of chases, and would double pip.  But to me that's a complete failure (other than wanting the bp).  It's a rarity for me to have fun on a match where I got 0 kills.
---
I don't use BBQ on any of my killers anymore, ever since it got nerfed with locker changes and the new survivor perk, it doesn't feel as useful anymore besides point farming (if you need the points, use it.) so I run Discordance on all my killers now, the most I suggest to you is to go for a build that makes survivors not want to heal themselves and abuse that by just using regular m1's versus them. (so sloppy butcher) and make sure to have Ruin too. I use bloodhound with sloppy butcher cause the survivors never heal themselves, so I just find them easy with their bloodstains.
---
Coming from a doc main.
---
Thank you. Wasn't going to play anymore until they fixed the FPS on console as I can't play it on 30. 
---
Maybe so. But it has its counters (dribbling, etc). And if somebody looses 2 gens from DS, it really is the killer's problem at that point.
---
While this is true I meant it in more of a, “legion is literal cancer to go against,” sense. Not entirely serious.
---
You can still get away by clever using the environment and movement. If it's that people don't find it fun, I doubt killers enjoy being looped but that's apparently not bad
---
Faking Dwight 
---
The point is you provide points that I argue with.
---
The Doctor is an oncologist actually. 
---
It is lame ye, not for me though because I get free points and still get matches pretty dang fast.
---
god bless
---
Maybe this is the way out of this place. Well, here I go
---
Also I just love the shoulder check Dwight pulls.  The fact he didn’t just clip clean through and had actual collision makes this even better.
---
Just now?
---
Happened to me earlier in what feels like forever in a really unfortunate hook set up. It rarely happens so I forget if juggling still works in that case.
---
The FPS is still lackluster on the PS4 Pro, but I’m just saying it’s significantly better than the base model is. Night and day.
---
Slowing the game down is exactly what the game needs, though. The biggest problem with the balance in this game is how fast gens get done, especially with SWF. 
---
That looks great!!
---
Fair point, upvoted.
---
Thanks. Been watching PC gameplay and it's so much smoother to play, hopefully console gets there one day
---
If you get all five totems and they aren’t running it then you have technically wasted time, but if you decide not to do them because it could be a waste of time then you are decided to maybe be a serious disadvantage late game. The waste of time is helpful to the killer but not super significant to your escape because if you are pumping gens out while the killer is struggling to kill then you have time to cleanse totems even if that totem time costs you a hook it’s better than having NOED go off. If the killer begins to snowball your team and you’re doing totems it isn’t like you not being on a gen has suddenly cost you the game, the killer is just putting in work over wherever and the coming loss wasn’t particularly because of a “maybe NOED”.
---
Case in point taking the time to cleanse the totems might affect how fast the gens get done but it won’t really affect whether you’re going to win or not as much as other variables unless you decide not to cleanse and happen to get NOED’d.
---
It has counters. Mainly soft counters, but counters. If killers loose that many gens from one DS strike, it is kinda the killer's fault at that point. Also remember you can always slug. It is basically a less efficient hook, but it still works. Also survivors quite honestly don't hit DS that often.
---
Nopenopenope
---
Because posts that didn't directly link to dbd got taken down, so people started putting a small killer head in their memes so it would count. Not sure if that's still the case
---
Also because it's fun as fuck.
---
Mega O O F
---
I just wondered if it would disconnect you or something. But since you host the game yourself that shoudn't happen, now that I think of it.
---
So I played DbD on my OG xbox one for about a year and I just upgraded to a one x for Christmas and to put it simple, the difference is incredible. The constant FPS stutter that I would experience when playing killer is basically gone and I get steady frames most of my matches. Hitting backrevs with billy and throwing hatchets have never felt so smooth. Hell, I could probably now practice nurse without it looking like a slideshow. I can't say it's a constant 60 fps, but it's *definitely* better and more enjoyable.
---
And survivor is even better. Most survivor games I get a constant 60 fps. If you have the X, I highly recommend coming back, I don't think you'll be disappointed. 
---
Sharefactory gang
---
Just like the ability to cleanse totems isn't a hard counter against noed.
---
Lowest skill floor belongs to legion. 
---
Leatherface can run with his best addons and do about as well as a no perk billy without camping.
---
Source: Leatherface was my first killer.
---
There is a bug with Prove Thyself in the PTB, that's why Gens are flying by so fast.
---
I'm gonna be honest, the mods on this sub suck.  I've mad a meme it was taken down AND then another meme was made exactly the same format as mine and left up.  They also took down about three other memes a few days old after they were posted.  The best mods and the ones they should try being more are r/boottobig those mods are great AND ACTUALLY CARE AND WELL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID WRONG AND ARE UNDERSTANDING, FRICK YOU MODS WHAT THE HECK!!!
---
Perfect title for the joke. Made the clip even more funny. Well played, OP!
---
Jake then or Nea (dont @ me)
---
Ooooh look at this cool guy, be doesn't make complaints in a fucking VIDEO GAME. If no one ever makes complaints about a video game, how will the Devs know to fix that issue? There is obviously a problem with Legion. It's up for debate what that problem is, but there is a problem. You're delusional if you think he's a balanced killer. He's at one side terrible, and on the other hand he's absolutely mind numbingly crappy to verse. You speak about it as if it's soooo simple.
---
"Just pallet loop, just mend, just do generators, just just waste his time." It doesn't work like that. If you think I'm the only one who doesn't see a problem with Legion you're delusional. Half the playerbase, probably more knows he's busted.
---
Did he just say the f word or actually go full homophobic, trying to attack you for your sexuality?
---
Skill floor = lowest amount of skill required to be effective
---
The only maps where totems randomly spawn on the edge are swamp and Lerys’s (correct me if I’m wrong) but apart from that they spawn in certain locations on certain tiles so totem hunting really isn’t that hard once you get it down, and even on lerys the spawns are still predictable, just... weird. Plus as I said on the other guys reply it will cost you a little bit of time but it’s rarely significant to the outcome of the match and when it is (like a pretty close game where maybe 1 guys dead and someone’s getting chased while you work on the last gen with your other guy injured or by an exit gate) then I can understand it feeling a little overpowered but that’s sorta the intended purpose for the perk, to clean up whoever’s left when endgame hits.
---
Really? If that is the case, then I can't wait to play it again 
---
Can someone please explain to me how NOED works? 
---
You know every time i fucking forget about Tim and Moby y'all internet bitches remind me and im not at all mad about that
---
I think with some buffs a rework wouldn't be necessary. In the original movie, the final showdown with Freddy appears in the real world, with Freddy himself battling Nancy in the real world. Why not allow Freddy to come out of the dream world in dbd as well? A buff I would think would be good would be allowing Freddy to pop out of the dream world if survivors perform an altruistic action in his terror radius. This would give Freddy a fighting chance and a response to survivors bum rushing hooks right in front of Freddy's face. I also think the addon that makes Freddy completely invisible during the dream transition should also be just integrated into his ability.
---
Not really that bad at all. If you’re going for a Satan build replace BBQ with Ruin or Lullaby and the BPS with an Ebony Mori
---
I get accused for tunneling pretty much every game, and I kinda do, but not to an extreme extent. I'm sorry I'd go for the claudette who is closer, injured, and out in the open after being unhooked, as opposed to the Dwight who is already running away, fully healed, and by a pallete. 
---
It could definitely be worse.
---
Welcome to the new Killer Spotlight: The Cereal Killer.
---
God that clown was bad. Why doesn't he uses his fucking power
---
All. The. Time. 
---
Yeah man for real. I was so fed up with the poor FPS and the constant stutters that upgrading to a one x was my "last resort" for this game (plus it was time for an upgrade anyway), and seriously, I'm so happy I did. 
---
To be honest 8/10 leather face players I have played against have faced camped me or hard patrolled me it is very seldom I find a non toxic lf if you aren't one please be aware of this also thank you
---
I don't, I let them bleed out or I get ready for another chase. 
---
d a r n, I meant Joe's. The double cooldown setup basically. I'll fix now
---
A couple ways to make Freddy better from a Freddy main. (P3, adept Freddy etc..)
---
**The Easy to Implement**
---
* Reduce the time to sleep on default to 4 from 7. Make sure he has a minimum sleep of 1 second w/addons.
---
* Extend his default killer power range.
---
* Make a 100% reduction in action speed while in dream state.
---
**The Visual Improvements**
---
* Its rather hard for Freddy to see auras in some maps due to the intensity of the whiteness and the brightness of the dream world. This is something that needs to be worked on. Lery's is a pain to see survivors auras on.
---
* Make the slight survivor picture change for Freddy when the power hits them more noticeable, the slight white change is a hell of a difficult thing to see. Make it longer or more obvious.
---
**The Reduction in Annoyances**
---
* Make the skill check to wake up exclusive to generators and team healing. Self care is a great counter to Freddy in general.
---
* Make it so survivors have a 100% reduction to action speed while falling asleep. Allowing Freddy to prevent totem destruction and gen completion instead of standing around like a dunce.
---
* Allow Freddy to pick up survivors while people are healing them outside of dreamstate.
---
**The Weird**
---
* Start Freddy out with a 2.5% reduction to move speed at the start of the game that is removed when the first survivor is put into dream. Then for each survivor more than one that is in dream state Freddy gains a movement speed buff. (+ 2.5%-1.5% buff)
---
* If all 4 survivors are in dream Freddy's terror radius decreases by 8m or drops to 0m.
---
* Put in an addon that provides a visual indication for Freddy right before the survivor is about to hit dream state or put in the ability as an additional part for an existing addon.
---
These are all separate ideas and shouldn't all be done at once. Some are redundant. 
---
Any same human playing high ranks
---
lol fair enough
---
Yes, but they are changing the totem spawns, and wiping the remaining survivors at the end-game may be the intended use of the perk, but that doesn't make it balanced or well-designed.
---
Sure, I am not saying that it would fix Legion in any way. But it is still a idiotic design decision to allow someone to whiff a ton of attacks, use the lunge to travel farther (although I am now not sure if it does or doesn't work, with all the conflicting info here). It is just a stupid decision to add this to their power, because it does nothing other then putting the skill floor even lower then it is
---

I can't, there's a huge man with a knife chasing me.

damn the entity needs to chill with the ambient lights
---
darn,  I've been off reddit for a few weeks and have only recently started posting again...
---
Yeah mate sorry to tell you it died like 5 days ago
---
The amount of downvotes just because people don't like legion. wew
---
heck.
---
most swf's just fuck around. playing against swf is way more fun than playing against 4 immersed solo players. 
---
Were not talking about the balance of the game were specifically talking about MYC. If we talk about trying to balance this cluster fuck of a game well be here all day and practically no one on this sub can balance the game because were all bias to certain things. My point still stands MYC imo promotes unfun campy play style more than anything else and punishes survivors for playing the game. I think it rewards the exposed effect for little to no effort for much too long.
---
but what about my ms paint killers?
---
Reminds me of a fun game. I tried to get Adept David, so running no Mither. Playing with another person together to have some fun while doing so. Starts the game, lags super hard even though we supposedly had green ping at the start. First person gets caught, kills themselves on hook. I get caught out a little later, notice it is the spirit and go down. Get put on hook and get camped for nearly half my bar. Ok, spirit goes away seeing someone else. I kobe of the hook trying to kill myself (because that game was so stupid), run away, finished 2 gens and escaped, getting the achievement and the House of Pain (I think that is what it is called) achievement, too. I find it funny that I got my Adapt David chivo first try, while it did take 5 tries to get Claudette
---
Not been my experience at all. 
---
Hmm dunno man 
---
Hooked survivors often become part of my patrol if either:
---
1. They are hooked near a number of generators since, like gens, it is just another objective for the non-hooked survivors.  If not, I'll probably just go to the opposite side of the map to apply pressure.  OR
---
2. I saw someone nearby when I hooked them in the first place since it is almost guaranteed that person stuck around for the unhook and I might be able to get them.
---
\#2 in particular looks like a blatant camp to the hooked survivor (and perhaps some/many would argue it is), but I'd call that smart play on the killer's part.  If you can get 2 people hooked in the immediate vicinity, that's a huge game swing.
---
The other scenario where I like to go back is RIGHT at the end of stage 1 since people tend to rush to get someone off a hook in that scenario.  
---
PS4. 
---
Ormond, 
---
outside along one of the walls of the resort building (forget which side) there’s a brown pillar running up on the corner and the actual collision box extends outwards making it impossible to turn the corner against the building tightly 
---
He is both overpowered and underpowered at the same time.  His map presence and ability to stall the game are non-existent, so getting multiple survivors before all of the generators are done is very unlikely.  On the contrary, in a 1 on 1 chase, he is basically guranteed to down even the best of survivors, as there is no real counterplay to him other than 360ing, and even that is a gamble most of the time.  
---
\*insert comment about david\*
---
*laughs in iridescent axe head*
---
The killers have exhaustion add on vigil should allow you to escape from exhaustion faster and in a chase
---
I doubt they'd ever do Jeepers Creepers because they'd have to give money to that child molester. 
---
Wow, I'd really enjoy seeing more of those. Damn good video man, gj!
---
Thank you so much it means a lot!
---
Killer: doesn’t play nice
---
Survivors: “fucking try hard god it’s just a game just have fun let someone escape every once in awhile, we are all killers such dicks”
---
Killer: is nice
---
Survivors: “gg to ez bb killer”
---
Killer: stops playing nice
---
Survivors: insert shocked pikachu
---
ok this is  A E S T H E T I C
---
That's mostly due to the ebeing more survivors so there's obviously going to be more toxicity between them. 
---
There's no good argument against this, so sure, why not. 
---
That doesn’t change what I said though
---
While I agree with this sentiment, I think it does do what your asking as well, rank 1 killer on xbox and a lot of the time I get lobbies similar to this of a rank 14 playing with their red rank friends, and it ends how you imagine it would, usually its a friend on a "smurf" account just trying to get easy games for the friends and the unfortunate times it isn't that becomes a 4k slaughter as the overly altruistic reds try and help their low rank friends. Just try not to let the salt/toxicity get to you it is just a game after all, meant to be played for fun not anger. Good luck in the fog friend may the entity be pleased.
---
He's just really fun to play against and through my share skill and knowledge of loops and mind games I feel like theres outplay potential behind every move. /s
---
But seriously he's not powerful but he's so fucking boring to play against and is broken by design. A killer that voids every survivors skill is surprisingly boring. 
---
&gt;All 4 can escape without you losing progress so long as you didnt stand in the basement all game
---
But my goal is to get a 2-3k each match.  Fuck progress, depip me if I don't get a kill because that's complete failure in my mind.
---
I was nice quite often during the event.  End up inadvertently hooking the weakest link twice and downing them before the first gen is done.  Instead of killing them just leave them on the ground and run off to gen patrol.  Problem is while weak at looping they do gens just as fast as anyone else, so they get healed and pop two gens by themselves while I'm getting looped by the others.  One game on yamaoka turned an easy 3-4k into a hard fought 2k after the gates were powered.
---
The toxicity takes all the fun away.
---
It doesn't, but it explains why what you said is the truth. 
---
Yes, gens are done quick. But, sometimes you can counter it, in fact you usually can. If you can't, just slug.  Or if you are in the position to, just eat the stun.
---
r/prequelmemes
---
As a legion main seeing the panic in a survivor when they don’t you know I can vault them is the best feeling in the game 
---
(Yea yea “LeGiOn mAiN hErE”)
---
we'll **not** make it
---
How do people have trouble against legion, he's by far the weakest killer in the game. He's an automatic pip. 
---
What does the lil 3 mean
---
Cool story bro do you have time to tell it again? 
---
I never said everything is the killer's fault. But if 4 gens do pop that fast, it is the killer's fault. That shouldn't happen. Also I don't understand the last sentence.
---
As much as I would love this, it would only split the player base even more. Matchmaking would be worse I would assume. 
---
I'm not gonna lie, he is boring as fuck. He's the only killer in the game where you know your getting a pip just by being in his lobby. And his power is very weak, but annoying. At least with doctor and pig and Freddy their power helps them. Legions power is basically just built in ruin, but because his map presence is so bad it's basically useless 
---
The player base is not big enough to do this so it will not happen. There will never be a separate queue, ever. Period, end of story. We don't have enough people, so people need to change the way they play or people will continue to derank.
---
Not according to Dragon Ball. Besides, everyone knows your true power is only released when the shirt comes off.
---
Sure do! 
---
I'm sorry your teammates disconnected within a minute of the match starting due to my insta-downing chainsaw. The two of you got the game down to 2 gens; you did very well. Jake, I hope my mori didn't upset you too much. I couldn't waste the offering.
---
Main point of this post: don't disconnect mid-game and fuck other survivors. The two that stayed and at least tried, you're awesome.
---
Cul
---
Lmao nice. Good stuff man. 
---
That does sound pretty accurate to movie Freddy, since the whole point of Freddy Vs Jason was that Freddy needed Jason to get him back to power.
---
Only time Ive seen it happen. Sucks
---
Wait. Can you?  I thought you're stuck in place while they heal?
---
M'lady is in trouble!
---
It's just unfun and toxic, the other side will always say that the other is cheating.
---
Do you have fun running around in a circle over and over trying to get close enough for a hit and bracing for a pallet? Or even having your screen flash whiter than a marshmallow's ass?
---
Do you think you'd have fun getting hooked then mashing the button all the while staring at the killer who's standing in front of you? Of if THAT survivor unhooks you in front of the killer and you're downed before you can start running?
---
Neither are cheating, all four are (sadly) valid strategies. They just aren't very fun.
---
Yeah, this is the main blessing with SWFs, it’s rare to encounter one that doesn’t dive bomb the hook.  They’ll probably call you a camper, but if they don’t even give you time to leave the hook before rescuing, going after them isn’t camping, it’s the only smart play.  
---
Every time I’ve been called a camper it has been by an SWF who constantly tried to body block, flashlight save, and heal in front of my face.  If I know three of your team mates are within ten feet of the hook of course I’m not gonna arbitrarily go patrol gens on the other side of the map.
---
you'd be surprised to see how they can still fuck up if you have an instadown killer (especially billy)
---
I solo que and always try to do at least 2 dull totems. If we ever get hit by NOED, my initial thought is, "WHO DIDN'T DO THEIR ONE REQUIRED DULL TOTEM?!"
---
no
---
Not everyone actually using the word is truly homophobic. Kind of a bit like the south park episode actually.
---
I don't 9iu56yog7ith 
---
Would block too much of the screen. Killer fov in this game is already a dumpster fire.
---
No rank, no addons, no perks, plus a DC, this means literally nothing. 
---
Survivors wont have fun playing againts legion
---
Most killers are trash. Nurse and to some extent huntress are the only two killers who have skill ceiling on par with survivors. By that I mean they are the only killers where player can continue to improve potentially without limit while rest of the killers hit the ceiling so much sooner. Theres only couple tricks Myers, Pig, Spirit, Legion, LF, Doctor, Freddy, Hag, Clown, Billy, Wraith and Trapper can pull to outplay the survivors.
---
Myers takes fucking forever to get the game going and can get looped for way too long. All he can do is charge his stalk so he can pop it to lvl3 and get instadown. Very simple to play, can't do anything special without addons.
---
Trapper can proactively/preventively place a trap and hope survivors loop into it, but his traps can be disarmed. Other than that he gets looped forever. Player can try to predict what loops to trap and try to tunnel survivor into them. Other than that, can't get more skillful or play cool tricks.
---
Wraith is just shit. Its just shit. Banging the bell gives you speed boost but is completely negated by a single vault/flashlight and welcome to loop city. Player can't really improve the effectiveness of wraith. Its just invisible dude with huge headsup bell warning for survivors.
---
Billy actually is decent killer on CERTAIN MAPS because of his speed, giving him presence on gens. But on other maps his speed is completely useless (Hospital, Meat Plant). Gets looped like the rest of the immobile killers. Outside of learning how to use his chainsaw though, Billy doesn't have any other tricks and player really can't improve all that much or do any "sick moves" against survivors.
---
Hag is like nerfed trapper whose traps can be negated by walking around slowly or flashlights. All she can do is hope someone triggers a trap during chase so she can jump to it and hopefully get a hit off. Like with the trapper, player can get better at placing marks ahead of time to hopefully herd survivors into them.
---
Leatherface can break pallets slightly faster and instadown multiple people with single attack. Thats it. Killer made for camping. He doesn't break pallets fast enough to make him effective tunneler. Player can't really get better at leatherface.
---
Clown is fairly close to Huntress because of his gas slow which actually helps him in chase. Has higher skill ceiling than most killers because he can possibly predict the path survivors take and punish them for taking it. Player can always get better at tossing the gas.
---
Legion.. Is. I don't even know. I guess he can tunnel and chase you through loops for a while but downing a player takes forever. I suppose skill revolves around knowing when to use/not to use frenzy and knowing the map. Outside of that, can't really do anything special. I was kinda hoping Legion would be the kind of killer that disguises itself as a survivor (like was shown in trailer). Would've been much spookier.
---
Spirit is just nerfed Nurse. I guess the idea with her was that she suddenly stops and could appear anywhere.. Which can work if people aren't walking/vaulting. Player skill can improve effectiveness of Spirit considerably up to a limit.
---
Pig is supposed to be stealthy and slow the game down with reverse beartraps. Completely countered by selfcare and looping. Player can get only a little better at launching surprise attacks but that's it.
---
Freddy has to be the weakest killer. Just dogshit. Can't hook anything without the guy getting instantly unhooked. I'm not even sure what gimmick Freddy is supposed to fill. He is invisible and also completely harmless. I don't get it. Its so easy to get out of the dream by simply failing a skill check and he gets looped just like everyone else. Player skill simply doesn't matter with Freddy. Theres nothing special you can do and your ability is just a hindrance.
---
Doctor can actually counter looping and also has higher skill ceiling than most killers. Kinda shit killer if survivors don't loop him though and just run away while vaulting and palleting. Player can always kinda get better at landing treatment provided survivors are trying to loop.
---
Nurse has got to be the most powerful, probably to a point of being broken because she doesn't have to care about looping, vaults or pallets. All survivors can do against her is try to genrush and maybe get crutch dead-hard play off. Player can always get better at warping through obstacles for shortcuts.
---
Huntress can actually deal damage from range. Enough said. Using pallets or vaults is dangerous against her. The player can always get better at throwing hatchets.
---
MEANWHILE the survivors can palletloop, bodyblock, take hits, flashlight save, flashlight after pallet, flashlight before pallet, flashlight during pickup and dstrike your ass all day while rushing gens on the other side of the map after which all the bullshit adrenaline-instaheal-borrowedtime kick in. There SO MUCH stuff that the survivors can do and get better at to make the killer look like a joke. Theres not even a handful of killers which can be considered good. You're forced to run Ruin on most killers so you don't get rushed while you spend 5 minutes chasing some asswipes through pallets just to land one hit. 
---
Anyone who honestly and genuinely thinks that most killers aren't at a massive disadvantage against survivors haven't played rank 1 games as a killer. It's frustrating because there's simply nothing the killer can do to win a game. The game is for survivors to lose, not for killer to win. The only times when killer gets 4k is because survivors tried some stupid shit and made a mistake or because the killer is playing Nurse.
---
OP is probably talking about Prove Thyself. Since it alone is about to start a new meta of 30 second gens.
---
WoRkInG aS iNtEnDeD 
---
Don't have the edit skills to censor names lol sorry, bro. I guess this post was shit. Sorry :(
---
You can use legions ability to down, nurse can be juked by skilled survivors, legion can’t.
---
Counterplay to nurse is blocking line of sight and minor mind games that do work against any nurse that isn’t godlike from time to time. 
---
The chase is only fast if they are great and your shit or you make big mistakes. 
---
I've gone against a few and I liked the thrill of it. 
---
You don't have ms paint? 
---
It’s not just where you are it’s world wide
---
No
---
This was taken from my phone. It'd be a much longer process if I was committed to do it lol. 
---
Nah, you're good. 
---
What is a bulrush?
---
I think they prolly just spelled wrecked wrong 
---
Ah yes I love it when people start to think they're superior and talk down to me during an argument. Just goes to show how you think you're so right about everything. Big superiority complex right here. It's not worth arguing with you anymore because this is a waste of time and arguments on the internet have no worth, especially with people like you. Kys and good day.
---
"3+ minutes" my ass. I've run TotH to see how long totems last on average. I'd say at least 60% of the time all 5 are gone in under 3 minutes (and TotH slows cleansing, remember). Which, btw, is about 1/4th of the average game. There are, of course, exceptions. Killers that can better defend Totems can keep them longer. And in general Totems seem to last longer on The Game, Lery's, Yamoka, Ormond, and both Backwater maps. Meanwhile Disturbed Ward, Rotten Fields, Thompson House, Coal Tower, and Shelter Woods seem to go the fastest. And out of the 7 games I've had on Rotten Fields during this not a single totem has made it to the end.
---
Who needs luck when you run deliverance
---
I'd make Ranked mode and Casual mode, and put SWF in Casual mode so it'd be sort of a KYF, free-for-all hybrid. There'd be no more SWF in Ranked mode.
---
If I become twitch partner through DBD, feel free to remind me of this, reddit.  
---
Pretty good job so far
---
It is after all the gens are done. But it doesn't spawn until then because it would never survive otherwise.
---
I find that the best way to play the Legion is to play Nurse. 
---
Say whatever you want, but Legion gave me nice cheap cosplay for next year's comicon, instead of costly as fuck Hunt: Showdown cosplay I was going with (meh, getting custom-made glasses for that is a biatch).
---
When I was playing killer for the first time, I hooked someone and thought hitting them over and over again made them die quicker. I noticed they were dying quicker. Not because of me hitting them but them trying to kobe off the hook. I kept on doing this in all my matches. Realized my mistake after lot of hate messages on PS4. Game does a terrible job at explaining these things.
---
That's the problem. Why post something that has so effort put into it. I mean yeah good job, but people already dislike these posts.
---
 What was the rank anyway?
---
It's the only way it would ever work as a totem. Lit totems attract Survivors like moths to a flame.
---
Original NOED wasn't a Hex, activated after a gate was open and lasted forever. Then it got nerfed to activate after all the gens were done but only last 120 seconds. Then it got nerfed into a Hex.
---
Do you run any other hex perks with it? This might not have a huge effect, but if a survivor notices you had TotH, they might assume you have another hex totem that isn’t immediately apparent like Devour Hope and prioritize that getting those to avoid it. Again, not sure what effect that might have or how often that’s the case, but it’s worth taking into consideration. Also, what rank do you play at? You might be more likely to fight coordinated swf teams the higher you are
---
I need some Silent Hill in my DBD! Personally I’d love to see Heather from SH3 as a survivor.
---
Both perks are pretty bad but vigil is definitely worse, with so many effects that add permanent status conditions like sloppy butcher, noed, or clown's acid add, ect point being a lot of stuff in the game isn't effected by it even Michael's tier 3 isn't effected by it so kinda trash Imo....
---
You can make the survivors think you are not chasing them, they go mend and surprise one down. Or you can chase the last one. The first one getting hit has the hardest to avoid the hit since legion has the longest time frenzy left. The second survivor can run away and by avoiding one hit avoid the hit completely for the time frenzy loads. Some cases the legion keeps with that one, some cases goes to the first one. Which is what I mean it's not so preventable, at least with good legions.
---
I don't see a point stabbing survivor 4 times so I just frenzy one and do the other one normally. So it's just a nice Sprint burst to me, another way going around pallets or windows. 
---
But since many people tend to play legion in one excepted way, they have expections and you just have to do it the other way.
---
Anyway, I'm having fun with playing him, learning him and in all ( him= I'm a Joey main) so hopefully I'm not ruining too many games. But I've at least got some positive feedback so I guess not everyone is hoping me to DC :)
---
NSFW because daddy Ace can cause sudden orgasms.
---
I have no idea how is Lightweight the best perk tho.
---
Slugging intentionally isn't bannable, either. 
---
I dont use ds or noed. I'd love to see both go. The vast majority of the community argues about it, so, take it away I say! 
---
Your rank 13 kid, chill. Legion is garbage at high ranks. 
---
O shit i think hes running burgerking myers
---
At least we own the cancer. Also our cancer isn't taking advantage of devs not realizing how their chase mechanic works. Doc, even with the skillcheck build, has counterplay. With your build you find somebody with Disco Dance, give them deep wounds, and just follow them until they bleed out. 
---
They've already stated are not doing it because of the Creator being a pedo
---
Elaborate.
---
Were they on the ground? Something I noticed they don't do anything but if you get too close and essentially step on them they lose there shit (as most creatures would)
---
If you get hurt by words even without context to it means you gotta grow up and stop being a little bitch about life.
---
Mind gaming doesn’t lose the killer, it prolongs the chase. You can mindgame any killer regardless of how good they are, that’s why it’s called a mind game.
---
Of course clearly you’d know this what with your dual rank 1 grandness of which you have no proof of and are currently making quite questionable claims.
---
If it’s such an outlandish thing for me to say that looping is currently the strongest of all things survivors have and I’m a noob for thinking this what do you have to say to the dozens of streamers with 2-5k hours who say the exact same thing? 
---
I’m sorry that you need to make up blatant lies about your rank to attempt to push your ideas across despite them being clearly wrong according to almost all of the top players that we currently know of.
---
Platform: Xbox One
---
Type: visual (in game?)
---
Description: when playing a killer (for me micheal myers) if I were to grab a survivor off a gen, I would go through the animation however the survivor would not be grabbed and instead be able to escape only injured. Also frames would drop slightly, I rarely grab people off gens however this happened in two cases... maybe caused by connections?
---
This is pretty impressive! Whats your tactics when using him? Im currently trying to farm so i’m curious.
---
&gt;Does nord have that too?
---
No, I don't think so.
---
But I wouldn't find it useful as it would be annoyng having to meddle with the router to turn it off when I don't need it. I prefer having it on the device.
---
I had two games last night they would hit you then just walk backwards towards you so your timer would go down then when their power recharges spins around and hits you. The power should be a terror radius thing not that they can just look the other way and your timer goes.
---
The games were not fun for the entire match. I dont enjoy playing against him at all. Theres no fun back and forth with a chase like with other killers. I'd rather just get hit twice to get downed than deal with the whole borrowed time garbage.
---
haha exactly! Like yeah no kidding, they follow you to the hook but I am surprised how they hide away after i hook their friend.  Which I always find surprising...but I know they are still close by, so I start looking around.  Thats camping too ya know haha
---
Nice choice
---
Seriously, I don't know how that idea has gotten so much traction. It's just simply not true
---
With a medkit
---
Over a 1000 hours In the game. Most cosmetics either unlocked or bought. I’m still boosted af 🤷‍♂️
---
It's not supposed to be. Just like old brand new part or insta heals. They're meant to be a huge advantage, not a fun enabler for your enemies.
---
With the ruin to slow the game down just a little bit
---
So not fun to play against. Now people are starting the hit you then walk backwards garbage which causes your timer to go down. Just give the dude two hits and not this whole drawn out thing where I have to get hit 15 times. Chases aren't fun and its safer to just run in a straight line out in the open.
---
Why the fuck would you run Mirror and Tombstone?
---
I want to go back, I want to go back!
---
I sure love watching someone waste absolutely every pallet on the map without looping around once.
---
Yeah I get that. I was just thinking it would be nice on my smart tv to change regions easily.
---
He ran Scratched Mirror and Judith’s Tombstone r/facepalm
---
Normally it screws over your team but not in this case since they all dc’d
---
Oh man I feel you. That‘s the worst.
---
A slur has a universal context that you can’t strip away with your individual use of it.  Every queer person is going to have tons of experiences behind them where they were othered and abused by the same slurs, and the fact that you “meant it in a different way” ain’t gonna mean shit to them when they hear it.  Why is a word like that so important to you that you’re willing to risk bringing up all these shitty emotions in people that have suffered real hurt when, you know, there’s infinite other words.  Fucker is a fun one.
---
Put a trap on survivor, crouch behind them to prevent them from getting boxes and from being in a chase do this for 30 seconds and they die toss in dying light and you have a massive problem
---
Hi hayden
---
At least you have to be hooked first. You would have had an aneurysm during the old days. The whole point of a mori is to end the game. 
---
Yup, in fact I find a lot of swf that get salty
---
This. For as much as people complain about lobby times, I don’t understand how anybody thinks two separate queues could ever work.
---
Dwight's gonna give it to ya! 
---
LOL...good stuff :D
---
He may have lost but he asserted his dominance
---
Yeah well we’ll have to see how good the totem spawns are because honestly I’m not expecting them to be anything crazy, and it’s definitely a more powerful perk than some others that may be poorly designed or unbalanced but then again it’s not like it’s the other perk that is. 
---
I don’t want to bring up DS because then I risk this discussion turning into a survivor vs killer debate and those turn ugly fast but it’s also a perk that has an intended use and gets used as such just like NOED but is also unbalanced and poorly designed. It’s not a good argument to say that because one exists the other should and my point isn’t that “if NOED gets nerfed DS should too &gt;:(“ but my point is that both of them are really strong perks that suck to go against, but they both have methods of countering them, whether it be perks or in game actions that also offer counterplay. 
---
I’d say NOED is a strong perk, but not overpowered, and I’d say the same for DS. You don’t always have the ability to counter them and the perks themselves aren’t total counters. That being said, are really strong and can sway the match in your favor, but I don’t see either of them needing a nerf in in their current state.
---
In every case, you're downranking to get easier/more comfortable matches against players less skilled than you. I don't think that's justifiable even if it's understandable. I think you can learn how to play a killer even while you're down pipping. As a survivor, your skill ceiling on survivors is a lot higher than your opponents, so I especially don't think it's fair in their case to downpip to play against weaker killers. 
---
I've been using those too lol always end up with at least one or two rage quits.
---
I love this 
---
*[HALLOWEEN THEME INTENSIFIES]*
---
Good stuff
---
It doesnt break the game though? Look at it this way: an amazing nurse can down you almost instantly. With FM, Legion will too, but it will be locked behind a higher rarity so you won't see it as often. Like Spirit's Prayer Beads. Those need to be Iri too.
---
What did you expect? 
---
In*
---
He is certainly fun to play, probably my 4th most played killer, the fact that you can simply use your chainsaw to stop chases 20 seconds earlier is amazing. I still like him but at red ranks he just gets looped for 20 minutes without even being able to use his chainsaw most of the time. You are guaranteed a 1k at least since no one is getting out your hook if you camp(even vs BT) but well, that's not a really good strategy
---
BBQ is a top tier perk, Knock out can fit in some niche slugging builds and Franklin makes survivors angry and sometimes gives you a free second hit when they try to get their item right away
---
No legion does not need faster movespeed for this. It's simple, don't miss. It makes it where legion players need some skill, instead of being mindless chasers like most currently are. 
---
There is literally no reason that his movespeed should be increased for this, since that would in turn make him too op once again and would negate the whole point of this nerf. 
---
Such crude content on this subreddit 
---
The thing would work, but we need bug fixes and console stuff rn
---
no u
---
He's still garbage, but he can make one or two survivor's match hell with his inescapable power and the "moonwalk" strategy. Legion is still both ineffective and obnoxious. 
---
His issue is the inevitability of chases. A legion with half a brain will *always* down you eventually. There is no counter play. That is the problem. Legion's missed attacks should partially drain the frenzy meter. And pallet jumps should too. That way survivors could **do** something.
---
who cares about disabling??  Just pick them up, go into a corner or next to a ledge and wait for them to either hit or miss.  Honestly, Killer's who are scared of DS are sure to lose.  If I find the Obsession, I get them and waste their DS ASAP.  
---
Make it so they can’t walk/ crouch? Only walk/crouch? 
---
They have some experience
---
I saw you on Edgar’s stream. Nice stuff. 
---
Congrats! Here's your medal! 
---
Yeah I assume that some one who unlocked the cosmetics or paid money for them take the game more seriously on average, and make for tougher opponents. That's my confirmation bias, at least. 
---
Are you new to game subreddits? Besides the Darkest Dungeon subreddit, every gaming subreddit is full of crying shitlords. 
---
Asserting dominance 
---
Awww thanks ❤️
---
You can tell his soul got crushed at the end just by the way he stood there 
---
If you want actual chase without his power then his power needs to be completely reworked. Or you can think about it like nurse, where her low movespeed is needed due to her power being op. Legion's power is op because there is literally no counterplay, it needs some counterplay apart from just genrushing. Also legion has such a low skill floor-skill ceiling that they need something to make players use more skill when using them. 
---
Then when something similar happens while chainsawing :)
---
This has been discussed a million times and it would be completely worthless against SWF. Is it unfortunate that SWF breaks what would otherwise be a cool concept? Yes. But it is in the game and isn't going anywhere, so we can't just ignore it.
---
Legion can sprint at 132 and vault pallets and windows. Thats the second closest thing to teleporting
---
Camping and tunneling are very fixable
---
I agree with you. I play on console so that makes playing nurse difficult. But I would say she has some of the best cosmetics. I won't buy them though because it would be a waste.
---
You ignored the entirety of my conclusion. Don't blame players for game design issues. 
---
You literally just said that it isn't because he has no drawback. So no, that isn't what you said. 
---
True, but until we get changes to the game, it's not gonna change.
---
SWF players have an incentive to downplay their advantages, especially on forums where the developers are active. 
---
Keep painting yourself out to be a victim, that’ll sure work and wont make you look ridiculous
---
So rather than constructively working towards a positive answer to issues, you wanna be a salty anger baby? Lol I bet you're great to work with in team projects. 
---
Killers are designed to have the advantages when chasing. A killer should always win a chase unless they get juked, which isn't always possible.
---
oof. thanks
---
I normally (and relentlessly) hate on these ideas. But this could actually work. Well done OP. Well done 👍
---
Underappreciated Lost reference. 
---
Why wouldn’t they allow the mimic to walk and crouch while mimicking? That’s seems dumb. 
---
Because killer advantage makes it too easy and unfair for survivors who get camped and tunneled.
---
Instadown Godly Nurse has a counter too: stealth. Also, with franks mixtape it just makes it like being caught by a Billy or LF. 
---
True, but they have made no progress.
---
What thrill? The thrill of constantly mending? Thats not fun
---
Okay so I get what you mean, maybe not being able to not counter looping isn't a slight weakness, It's where most killers that don't succeed at every aspect really choke at. But the reason I say Wraith is underrated is because, as I said, bis base power helps him with almost every other aspect there is, which is where he can succeed. And yes, you are right, every killer, even the dastardly Freddy Krueger can be pretty dope with addons.
---
Also the part about TydeTyme really made me laugh because it's so true. xD
---
Honestly this game has forced me to develop thick skin to the point where a 12 year olds pointless internet insults can't bother me. I recommend you relax before and after a match of killer as I understand that this game can really get to people sometimes
---
He was meme-ing you. I'm sure he fully expected to lose.
---
Just make it so certain non skill check activities can be performed to make them be able to be detected. Or be able to turn into survivors they have hooked most recently
---
Difference between DDoS and DoS - 
---
DDoS - It is multiple people or a botnet all sending false data to a router to flood it with false data, since it cant tell the difference between fake data and real data, it sends everything through.
---
DoS - 1 user sending data to a router in intent to flood it.
---
It's not worth a million discussions. People just keep bringing it up without ever addressing the outcome of the previous discussion.
---
It was the last few seconds i could have used it! :(
---
What build were you running? Perks are hidden
---
Well people just DC against him at rank 1 a lot of the time, so Legion actually wins. He is a much different killer than Freddy I wouldn't compare the two just cause they are "weak"
---
the surprise one down, isn't a mindgame, it is an unstoppable exploit of the chase mechanic. If you follow surviviors using the scratchmarks and blood trail, there is literally nothing they can to stop you catching them when they are forced to stop and mend. I'm sorry to say it but what you are describing in't mindgaming, it is just choosing not to down a survivor when you are able to and wasting your own time. A killer shouldn't need to be voluntarily played intenionally suboptimally to not be incredibly frustrating.
---
*laughs in deliverance
---
Judging by my roommate's complaints: horrible framerates + having to use a game pad = braindead survivors being able to survive.
---
You are so right. I got so frustrated that I just started making mistake after mistake and they capitalized on it. 
---
I guess I just can't give up and have to learn to deal with toxicity because it is part of the game.
---
I'm pretty sure he died abit inside
---
No wonder they couldn't sell it. They left it as is from the murder

When did I paint myself to be the victim? I never did so I don’t know where you got this from I’m just making a point that most survivors feel entitled to tell us killer mains what to do and what perks we can and can’t run all because I disagree we should listen to one post I’m suddenly the victim? There are probably other people like me but don’t have the confidence to get in your face and tell you your fucking not aloud to tell us what to do if we don’t want to listen to you we won’t. All this because you disregard my opinion of using sloppy butcher as wraith have you ever thought a some what intellectual thought in your whole life? I’m making a point yet you wanna ague because daddy always gives you want you want.Welcome to the real fucking world so doesn’t agree with a post get over it I don’t agree because I like the sloppy butcher and bloodhound combo yet your to stupid to realise oh he might have a point that we don’t always have to what survivors want because sure it used to be. WHAT SURVIVORS WANTS SURVIVOR GETS however now it’s SURVIVORS AND KILLERS ARE EQUAL get it? I’ve probably just rambled what came to head the point is I paint myself the be victim you might of interpreted it that way but I didn’t I like sloppy on wraith get over it and fuck off
---
have been out argued. Final point: there should be some way to regulate who they can turn into, such as having to hit, Mori, hook, sacrifice, stalk, or something. Maybe only being able to turn into obsession. Maybe have requirements changed by add one. My previous points were bad, sorry. Just may be difficult to figure out requirements and how those could be balanced
---
I mean I'm all for that. Buff solo players, then buff killers accordingly. 
---
You said it’s been discussed a million times. Ergo, it is worth a million discussions. Otherwise people wouldn’t discuss it. 
---
Yes and no. Few new players would already buy cosmetics for a game they barely know. However, in my case, I've known the game for a while but only started playing this Christmas. I know I'm going to play for a while so I bought some cosmetics. I know what to do in theory, but in practice I'm still a potato (story of my life).
---
This thread makes me wonder if I should get good first and then wear my pretty cosmetics lol.
---
If you’re getting juked as nurse then you’re just bad. Blocking line of sight effects legion too he doesn’t have some radar tracking that tells him where you are at all times, only sees heartbeat if he hits someone. And it only downs after about 4 hits, you can’t use it to down you use it to waste time at that point you clearly haven’t played legion. His second hit only drops the timer a little it doesn’t down in ability 
---
Where did they say that? 
---
No.
---
Nurse is quite possibly the only killer which is truly countered by stealth so that’s a pretty piss poor argument.
---
Except with mixtape you can basically do what billy or lf do but without the difficulty and requirement of being close. Pallets and windows hard counter billy and bubba yet legion doesn’t have this issue. See your problem now?
---
Even more of a reason to use her bun hairstyle.
---
It’s so fucking annoying. We’ve waited like 1,5 hours to get a game. Got one game and the killer disconnected instantly when the game started.
---
Any power can be OP or worthless without the right balance. I don’t believe we can assess balance until we actually have the base power to start with. 
---
Wrong
---
Thank you for your advice! I actually got the game after seeing a yt video from Azralynn. So I would love to start watching more DBD content creators. I will check them out.
---
Your advice about leaving a chase and finding someone else is something I am going to have to remember when things start getting frustrating.
---
Think of something original for once.
---
Unless they changed it very recently, it's always been capped at 100%
---
Ultimate Nostalgia bomb
---
do any lil peep fans think she looks like toopoor
---
&gt;If somebody is clicking a flashlight near you, run at them while looking a bit to the right or left and they can't blind you.
---
Thank you for this tip. I'm going to try that.
---
The devs confirmed in a recent post that healibg speed stacks with all healspeed perks
---
Yeah, that seems like a likely explanation. I do think SWF groups can be inclined to turn up the altruism to a point where it could be detrimental after the gens are done, but before that? Nah. I've seen it happen, but very rarely. And saying "most" is simply willful delusion 
---
I’m sure my post was more original than your comment ;)
---
Lol telling someone they have a superiority complex and to kill themself because you have no good argument or points. You clearly have a big ego if you can’t even have a conversation you know you’ll be proven wrong in, might break everything you believe in and actually have to CHANGE YOUR MIND! What insanity! And you’re right they have no worth, constructive criticism and debate have worth but you are clearly incapable of that level of thinking. You just further my point, you aren’t here to talk or debate you’re here to whine then run away when people don’t agree with you or succumb to your temper tantrum. Don’t kill yourself suicide is never the option, plus as sucky as you must be making your own life I’d rather you suffer till you grow up and can talk like an adult
---
You somewhat fall into what I mean. You know you'll play it long term thus meaning you'll get better. I watch people play this for 6 months before I got it myself. Wear your cosmetics. 
---
I never see doc or wraith when I play I usually see leatherdick
---
I assume you're joking.  Are you? 
---
 It's hard to tell given the overwhelming stupidity that some people of reddit can produce.  
---
You deal with a face camper by using even more scummy voice com tactics? I guess that checks out.
---
Yahar!
---
Stopped watching after you wasted god pallet
---
Male players: *cosplaying* as Clown
---
Something I do to help, is play 2-3 games of killer than switch to survivor for a couple matches for a good de-stress method.  If dont dont already, I would find some killer mains who stream on twitch and watch how they handle stuff like you experienced.  They helped me a lot
---
If the framerate gets fixed I'll take it
---
Ah yeah it would (I was running order). Thanks for the help. 
---
I fear no man. But this thing. It scares me
---
ye I know. but there is no way of knowing what was used in this case. prob the latter though
---
Agree, I'm on ps4 and 80% of the time, a leatherface its gonna be camper, worts thing the other surv goes for the save instead of leaving. So it goes both ways i guess.
---
I agree with you on all points but the Doctor will never get buffs. The simple fact that the loud, unskilled majority hates him and refuse to adapt to anything that isn't "throw down pallet and Sprint Burst away".
---
Getting stuns like these are my favorite part of playing Survivor.
---
Yeah, I know I'm wasting pallets by not looping them 5+ times before hand, but it's too amusing to resist!
---
No, but he can make 1 or 2 survivors lives hell with the strategy people are talking about in the comments. I'm lucky to have never went against it yet
---
Not a bad idea but it would separate the player base.
---
Avoid a survivor once they’ve been downed or are hooked. Got it. You can just down all 4 survivors then since they won’t help each other. 
---
Lol unlike you I actually rank am rank one and aren't shit at the [game] (https://imgur.com/gallery/2lNwOcP). 
---
Escaping killers isn't even hard, you just can't be shit, and the fact that you think mind games are "outlandish" says more about you than me. You think they're impossible, because You specifically can't do it. Just because you're not good enough to do something doesn't mean others can't.
---
And people being streets doesn't mean anything. Alot of survivor only streamers tend to derank to look better. Pretty sure your just annoyed that your incapable of anything besides looping because you lack any skill at the game. Talk to me when you learn knew ways to survive that don't include looping. 
---
Survivors in bright clothing WANT you to find them usually so they can loop you the whole game while others do gens (or at least try to loop you all game).
---
That's completely true. It's just less clear-cut, because by the same logic people could just avoid letting the Shape look at them. Heck, people generally shouldn't be working on a generator together anyway. And yet both of those things happen all the time, so a killer who relies on that sort of bad judgment seems...kind of OK? SWF would completely destroy this, though.
---
How about just making M1 instantly mori and spawning all survivors in the basement? The game has to be fun for both sides, and these changes would make it so no survivors play.
---
And have you brought anything new to this conversation? No? Then it sounds like you’re wasting my time. 
---
We were facing a Spirit, and when the gates were open, she smacked someone in the back, injuring them. This meant there was no NOED, but a teammate saw a lot totem and started to cleanse it... so I started spinning in circles, pointing to the exit gate being powered by a teammate (6 stacks of Remember Me making it ultra slow), just trying go do what I could to get them to stop cleansing. Lo and behold it was Haunted Ground, do I just fucking flew out of there. 3 of my teammates died.
---
No, slugging is part of the game
---
I don't blame them, he's boring to play against, I prefer the nurse because she forces me to tryhard and just feels really fun for me. 
---
What the hell is gen rushing? I thought that was the survivors only thing to do in that game ? 
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
inb4 people flame me for the BM in the end LUL. Glad u liked it man!
---
I think OP meant same Killers and Survivors as in always Nurse, Hillbilly, and Claudette, *not* always Tru3, XxXSniperWolfXxX, or whoever.
---
how amazing would it be that the Devs give Hooked Survivors the ability to kick the Killer in the face if they are face camping us?  Obviously, he has to be close enough to basically be touching the Survivor, but when that happens, the Killer gets stunned and takes about 6-8 seconds until he gets back up
---
Play at peak times, some times of the day the servers are dead. SWF takes a while 
---
It would only be for X amount of hours. Would that still be a problem?
---
Ah, a claudette in her natural habitat. Hiding in the grass
---
The salt was  considerably good this time! :D
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I love matches with survivors like that. It just feels so good to 4K a SWF. You should probably learn to play a stronger killer like Nurse, Billy, or Spirit.  Once you get the hang of one of them you’ll be destroying SWF like it’s nothing, especially if you master Nurse. You just need more practice, that’s all. 
---
I was with you until you said they "gen rushed" you by doing 2 gens in 2 minutes. You also stated at the beginning all 4 of them were making noise to get your attention. So gen rushing (tool boxes and the pre nerf BNPs) isnt a thing and if all 4 were getting your attention how were they being so successful on gens?
---
That's what i thought you meant. I just wanted to be sure. For me I'm a little different. I like my survivors all colorful because it feels more like what they wear. I don't think they knew they'd be hunted down and would need to blend in with the environment. Well at least in my head.
---
&gt;This was an exception where two were blinding me at a time
---
So dont pick the guy up and bait the flashlights, they will run out pretty quick. Multiple flashlights are even easier to counter, no one is dong gens and they tend to mess up each others timing
---
Wait a minute. Someone online, on a mature game, was immature? I don't buy it sir, sorry but downvoted for blatant lies.
---
@TigerKirby tries to get thread locked of anyone who disagrees with him. 
---
My comment about the difficulty of programmability being a lie was factually accurate. Something I picked up from my profession as a programmer. Something I actually explained in another comment had you bothered to read. 
---
I reply to troll comments with the same amount of respect they gave me. If you come across as aggressive, that’s what you’ll receive in return. Don’t be that five year old that smacks another kid and runs crying to a teacher when you get smacked back. 
---
Both. They complain that they get the same players and killers.
---
It makes sense, guess it's a matter of playing more and practicing. Got it, I'll still use my pretty Meg :p
---
I'm not gonna lie, I watched this five times before I realized you were Feng and not Jeff...
---
True, tbh I should remove it because considering I could have stopped it I shouldn't say "gen rush"
---
Voice comms are OP.
---
I just thought to leave this here just to share my experiences while repping up

---
Wait he says tally not "tell you (of)"?
---
Yeah, and Red Ranks are easier than Purple Ranks because deranking is so popular among experienced players.
---
BHVR really needs to provide some kind of incentive for higher Ranks, because there's no reason, besides being lazy like I am, to **not** derank.
---
Had multiple matches where we all burned Vigos along with 2 people having Up The Ante. We all kobe'd on first 2 matches within first 2 trys even when we had Slippery Meat. No one was broken and we mostly all escaped. 
---
Even had 2 ppl kobe on 1 Up the Ante and 1 Vigo/Salt Pouch since we were just screwing around and I forgot to change my build. 
---
True, I removed for further clarification
---
Depends. If it's a killer, I don't assume one way or the other. When it's a survivor... well, if they bought dark clothes I usually assume they're not that good at the game. If they're wearing all bright pink, orange, red, etc, I know I'm about to get fucking looped for days.
---
I just dislike using voice comms, it totally unbalances the game. Yeah, face campers suck, but at least it is using in game mechanics instead of using third party programs to give you an advantage.
---
He left through the other exit, which is actually just an entrance to the your exit gate. This looping survivors in this purgatory forever 😶
---
Yeah, that’s happened to me too. So I do I get that, and they need to fix that. But I know this has happened because of my mori this time around. 
---
you face camp a Survivor like that for no reason, at the start of the game, then all bets are off!  Enjoy the Pallet Looping, enjoy the T-Baggs, Enjoy getting Pointed at, Enjoy the spamming Flashlight clicking.  We do what we can do to stop this game play!
---
Hey do you mind if you can tell me the name of the song? I couldn’t find it for a long time.
---
You'd think the average normal person would have stopped replying after my obviously bait comment but you right a wall of text. That's pretty pathetic even for me.
---
This is why I tend to make people crawl.
---
I also like to think that it gives them time to reflect on the mistakes they made.
---
Okay, take care:)
---
I figure after overcoming face camping, a tiny bit of gloating isn't unreasonable there. That was a little excessive to dance around in front of him though.
---
Thanks for this totally unique experience 
---
I do play Spirit a lot and usually get a 3k - because I give hatch. She is very easy to dominate a match. I'll have to try Nurse out. The two times I tried Billy were comical, getting the hang of that chainsaw is tough.
---
In any game voice coms give an advantage I don’t see why it’s seen as a crime in this game
---
No problem, anytime!
---
ait
---
Oh yea, well that's more of a killer balance issue than a rank issue really. Some killers are just objectively better than others and it's kinda unfortunate.
---
I’m guessing last game 
---
What do perks look like or are they are certain color?? 
---
I personally prefer pop goes the weazel or the new surveillance for this build but I can see why you would use overcharge too.
---
That is a ridiculous statement. Having voice comms is the equivalent of having empathy, and bond and kindred and object of obsession all without ever using any of th eperk slots you need to. There is a huge difference between theoretically possible to know where others are if you use the in game resources to get that info (perk slots are a resource here) and using a third party program to access that information without spending any of those resources. No it isn't instant win, but that is a ridiculous false dichotomy to say it is either fair or instant win.
---
In that case sounds decent
---
I agree, partially. Although it is still quite minor unless you let yourself make it major.
---
Hmm I'd say rare and above add-ons, perks and good offerings. Read up on them before clicking :)
---
Already being patched in 2.5.
---
That's basically Evolve.
---
For survivers:
---
Dc when the exit gates are open or you are the last surv or when you know the other can get the hatch.
---
I hate it when people dc at the beginning of a match. Just ruins it.
---
“It’s fine guys I popped a chalk offering”
---
Yeah, it's pretty common and seems to be a lag issue.
---
Most of the addons you proposed to change were already changed to that
---
You got me
---
Ya I will someone before told me u just click on em all I guess I got trolled :/
---
Either way playing with your friends is more fun than solo
---
I get it won’t stack for repair/healing speeds, but both players get the bonus coop points....right?
---
I don't know how to explain it any way else. They did three gens very quickly - at the end they left one gen and decided to twerk and blind and point and wave at me. Any time I would down them - I downed all of them, some multiple times - they would swarm me with heals, blocks and flashlights. One was following me taunting me the entire game. 
---
So even if I was hitting and downing them - I was only able to hook one. 
---
They weren't play badly, they were playing toxic. I've only been playing for three months. So while you may have found this a cakewalk I found it frustrating to be constantly blinded and taunted and body blocked by and entire coordinated team. 
---
survivor OP brainded ez kept pallet stun while i try to rev chainsaw bg reported
---
Play killer and you won’t have wait times anymore, to many survivor mains is why you’re facing long ques and we just finished a 2x event so a lot of killers are going back to their main games ( RDR2 etc) because honestly playing now after 2x is a let down especially if you have DC’s/ bad games back to back.
---
The only solution right now is to help your fellow survivor mains that refuse to play killer and play killer yourself and you’ll have instant ques and your friends/survivor mains will thank you for it, and encourage them to play killer to.
---
I knew what this would be about without even seeing the image. 
---
They will have little marks on the top left part of the emblem indicating the tier lvl, also they are a different shape from offerings/items. They come in 2-3 colors depending in rarity. Green and Yellow are uncommon perks that are usually not character specific unless they are teir 1. The purple colored perks are very rare character specific.
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
I've seen a video where all 4 survivors spawned with myers in the shack. *terrified unknown language*
---
The tall weeds. They're getting a trim so they're not slapping Hag in the face anymore.
---
Have had a problem with PS4 survivor dailies for months now. The co-operation daily is frozen, and “open gates with ____” doesn’t work
---
LOL. Now I want Thana to spawn fox running around in the match, lol.
---
Name something something trio something something wait.
---
When you use aftercare annd they bring the killer to you
---
Perks are diamond shaped. They appear on the edge of the bloodweb and have a tick mark representing the tier in the top right corner of them (1, 2, or 3). You can only get one perk per bloodweb, so compare the two and figure out which you prefer.
---
Claudette's best perk is Self Care (it's also one of, if not the best, perk in the game).
---
At levels 30, 35, and 40, you can learn teachable perks. These are orange. Once you unlock them, they can start appearing in other survivors bloodwebs. Definitely learn Self Care teachable.
---
Aside from perks, try to get bloody party streamers, escape cakes, red/purple items and add-ons.
---
I tend to skip offerings that increase the chances of getting a certain map. Sometimes these are good with Killers who are better on certain maps, but for survivors it's not really needed.
---
If nurse really was as good as you are saying she would have been nerfed by now. Blocking los is irrelevant against legion because he tracks via footprints and blood a LOT more than nurse does. It’s a pretty hefty different. 
---
As said before I’m only talking about legion players who cheese via moonwalking and legion when he just hard tunnels one guy. 
---
Only time I teabag, my friend was getting moried at the exit gate and I teabagged him before I left 
---
Yeah, bonus BP for both. But repair speed maxes at 30%.
---
Bodyblocking isnt toxic and neither are flashlights. Its part of the game. Also bodyblocking really shouldnt ever be an issue go to the nearest hook abd hit when they block the hook. 99% it never works
---
Clicking and t bagging is taunting and being obnoxious sure but its just a game. 
---
It’s definitely an indicator of some level of investment, yeah.  Especially on ps4 where the game was free fairly recently so you get a lot of people who just kinda randomly downloaded it and aren’t super experienced.  If you see cosmetics you know they’re probably somewhat plugged in.
---
Obviously gonna vary, tho.  I bought the Susie cosmetic day one for Legion just because her look was the main reason I wanted the killer, but I clearly wasn’t at all experienced with her.
---
Thanks. I was worried for a sec lol. 
---
DONT COMPLAIN ABOUT DS IF YOU PICK UP SURVIVORS
---
I'm confused, are you saying you want Rank rewards because people want them and NOT as an incentive to rank up, or are you saying that you don't want Rank rewards because they're not the source of the problem?
---
Because what I'm trying to say is that the Red Rank players should get rewards for the skill/time/effort it takes to reach the Red Ranks.
---
Okay. Thanks for your advice.
---
Thank you.  I feel dumb now. 
---
i swear to fuck i heard julie when i listened to it.
---
Thank goodness. Thanks for letting me know.
---
That sounds hilarious. Still got the video?
---
No, just saw a link in a different Dbd vid. Imma try and find it tho
---
Feel better
---
It isn't that I don't get why people do it, but it is still an unfair advantage in the game.
---
LOL you right
---
That’s why I do it I can’t stand playing by myself I need people to entertain
---
Thank you for your help! Who should I look to main after Claudette? 
---
It's on a video by 4gamer "SPAWN WITH KILLER?" if you look up "dead by daylight all survivors spawn in shack" then it should be the first result. It's pretty funny
---
Like I said, I get that. I understand the reason the vast majority of people do voice comms isn't because it gives a strategic advantage, but just because you are playing with friends, and it is more interesting if you can talk to them as you play. That doesn't change whether it unbalances the game heavily in the survivor's favour though.
---
I think it's actually worse when survivor mains try killer just long enough to steamroll brown ranks and walk away thinking killer is so easy with no perks, Freddy, and giving away free safe unhooks.
---
This only makes them more convinced that the game is killer sided and that they need their SWF template build and comms to make things "fair" or "fun" which really means heavily in their favor until they face an equally dorito dusty billy/nurse main.
---
Darn that hurts...
---
I have tried playing huntress on ps4 and it is surprisingly difficult compared to pc. Practise makes perfect I guess. Still, respect for playing huntress on console!
---
ye that's why I said "ability to cleanse totems". I agree I worded that poorly.
---
4x Up the ante = 4×9% = 36% more luck 
---
4x salty lips  = 4x 3% = 12% more luck
---

Fuck your 4%
---
Nah man, it's not said anywhere in-game, that I'm aware of. You're fine
---
You know what you do?
---
I'll tell you what you do.
---
You write "oink oink" in chat.
---
That'll show 'em.
---
Take a look at some of the other survivors exclusive perks and see which ones you like most. [Here's a quick tier list](https://dennisreep.nl/dbd/perks/survivor/)
---
I'd recommend:
---
1. Meg: Sprint Burst and Adrenaline
---
2. Nea: Urban Evasion and Balanced Landing
---
3. Bill: Borrowed Time (great if playing with friends) and Unbreakable
---
4. Jake: Iron Will
---
5. David: Dead Hard
---
6. Feng: Lithe
---
If you don't want to spend money, save up Iridescent Shards as your total level increases and wait for Decisive Strike and Deliverance to appear in the Shrine of Secrets (you can unlock teachable perks without leveling the character there). If any of the above perks appear in the Shrine might want to pick them up too.
---
After unlocking Claudette's teachable Self Care, you can switch to a different survivor and start leveling them up while still playing Claudette. Self Care will appear in their bloodwebs as well as their strong exclusive perks. Once they are strong/leveled, you can switch to them.
---
Example:
---
Level Claudette 1 to 40. Unlock Self Care teachable. Play with Claudette while leveling Meg. Once Meg has Self Care, Sprint Burst, and Adrenaline, switch to her until you get to level 40 and unlock both those teachable perks. Play with Meg while leveling up Nea. Once Nea has Self Care, Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, and Urban Evasion, switch to her... etc.
---
O wow I thought u had to say the character to level them that's soo cool!
---
Also Hellraiser and Freddy. Mikey and Predator.
---
Yeah, Legion’s probably my third favorite killer behind Spirit and Pig, so I will continue playing her quite a bit.  Been trying to learn all the ones I didn’t initially gravitate towards at the moment, though.  Gonna buy Leatherface tonight to level him up for BBQ.
---
Needs NOED. Then they’d be severely hurt status
---
Nice work!
---
Shit, my toolbox, fucking Franklin's
---
Might have been hiding in the basement with Insidious. 
---
I had a game like that recently. Leatherface was in the hospital basement and waited while we did all the gens. Then we looted the map and someone went down there for the chest. He downed them and hooked them. 
---
At the end of the game he made one comment:
---
STAY OUT OF BUBBA’S BASEMENT!!!
---
But I cosplay Claudette :(
---
Calling yourself pathetic? Maybe you actually are learning I’m so proud of you! Except you came back after saying this wasn’t worth your time, what happened? Felt a need to respond after being totally called out? I get it it’s hard to get trashed so hard and deserve it but hey I’m sure you’ll learn from your mistakes
---
The video doesn’t work :(
---
Yeah, I'm barely in green ranks but ended up having two, nasty SWF teams of the downright rude but skilled kind in a row with only BS1 to try and "counter" the neverending loop abuse (with some misreads and bad luck on top of it), that put a bit of a halt to my unexpected enthusiasm for him.
---
Got him to 35 before and including that though so at least it's not a long way from getting the same toys on Nurse.
---
So the strongest character in the universe probably is a bald without a shirt
---
Nurse and Nurse
---
I still have 46 million of those.
---
Can't even use my moon offerings anymore.
---
Jeff is cute and a sweetheart don’t drag him like this
---
They work fine for me :(
---
Yeah, on ps4 I’ve encountered some deranking killers who don’t disconnect so the survivors get to keep their items, etc.  you can usually find them just standing where they spawned.
---
What killers do you recommend? I watched a lot of the Hag she looks op I just never touched killers before because it seems to stressful and hard to win 
---
At least it isn’t Judith’s + infinite + an ebony Mori
---
Yes she is but not to the extent that if you don’t down people nigh instantly your bad with her. There is potential to outplay nurse, unlike legion. Nurse doesn’t rely on tracking, she blinks to a location and either lands a hit or scopes out the survivors location and gets ready to continue the hunt. It’s pretty common sense and anyone’s who’s played nurse 10+ games will tell you the same.
---
Yes that is a legion thing, you turn around and look slightly down whilst tracking via bloodhound and wait for the timer to go down for the survivor. If you don’t even know about this I don’t feel we need to continue this conversation. 
---
Every killer can tunnel but legion is guaranteed a down with each chase via tunneling. Something no other killer is promised. This is the issue, it takes literally no skill to win chases as legion and chases are the biggest piece of DBD. 
---
the other player’s games are already ruined because of the mori anyway, so it makes no difference. if you don’t bring a mori then it won’t be ruined for you too :)
---
Yeah, atleast she has counterplay (even tho she mostly owns me)
---
2 hits is insanely overpowered considering there is no counter to the legion during chases. That's why it takes so many hits, only thing keeping the legion from being OP.
---
I don't think what you intended worked the way you wanted. Thanks to you and you only, my views went up 87% over the past few hours and actually account for 33.5% of the views over the lifetime of my channel that I've had since I was 17. That's 16 years of random videos being posted whenever i felt like it that I've had my channel up. Thanks for the support! 😉 Don't forget to subscribe. 😀
---
I like your username.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
Lmfao, sure I would go through the trouble of taking someone else's trophies and trying to pass it off as my own. 3k hours doesn't mean shit if you spent those 3k hours doing the same thing and not learning anything new. The fact that you can't mind game, and assume that because you can't nobody can tells me your just garbage at the game. Have fun complaining about the weakest killer in the game, and trying to impress people with your 3k hours of pallet looping. 
---
Cool buddy. You just keep complaining I guess. I'm done talking to crybabies who just want something to whine about.
---
You know she's not *actually* a pig, right?
---
It also happens when you get too close to a crow sitting on a stone. That's definitely not a 100% chance reduction.
---
Yep, it just gives every survivor the exposed status and you get the movement buff. 
---
I decided not to make it automatic because most people only want to randomize the character and perks, and even the perks you can exclude by unchecking the box.
---
That said, I would like to add a settings panel at some point, so that might be an option in the future.
---
The absolute thiccness of Frank’s neck
---
Thanks man.   
---
I definitely have had bad luck at times with people unhooking a bit too fast lately, I will try to observe a little more like you said with point 1. As for point 2, I avoid crouching entirely unless it's to thank another teammate, I kind of wish there was a proper thanks emote because I don't want to rile up friendly killers by crouching either, but ah well.  
---
I don't run D-strike, I'm just starting to think I'm an easy target because I main a slow guy. 
---
were you the trapper in the video? 
---
People don’t like the fact that he can hit you, then not look at you and follow with bloodhound and you go down, wanna mend? Nah I’m right behind you waiting for the mend to run down.
---
Omg dude are u just so fucking irrelevant  or are u just making a joke?
---
Legion mains don’t no. He is broken, and it’s fucking annoying being chased but not actually being chased so you go down for minimum effort.
---
Hey, OP, mind if I use this as my profile banner? Great work on it mate. 
---
Dwight forgot the pizza
---
I played like 2 or 3 times on the ptb and it was fun Now everyone is running the same add one so they basically constantly have the power and learned to abuse mechanics.
---
So fucking hilarious. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
me when i missed that last noed
---
As someone who prefers killer over survivor, it just feels unfair when you see a group that is very obviously coordinated through voice comms.
---
Not necessarily.  A Legion with bloodhound can end a chase while still technically chasing the enemy player.  It is an effective one-shot, even if it takes longer.  And even if Legion requires extra hits, it does not change the fact that Legion is not actually out-playable in a 1 on 1 chase.  Legion is outplayed by generator rushing, and they are a lot more powerful with addons especially.  However, even a Nurse can be mind gamed with limited visibility, whereas the ability to win a chase as Legion does not typically require mind games or exceptional skill as a killer.  Which is why he is both underpowered and overpowered by nature.  Like I mentioned, it depends on what you are referencing.  
---
So.. Going up against bad killers at r a n k 1 0 makes it OP...? That isn't proof it is OP, that just means you've had success with it.
---
100% of my hate messages are from other survivors, regardless of what I’m playing. 
---
Does anyone know if they’ve fixed the fact that Myers can stalk through rocks and trees?
---
I found out that i have noed for my ghost.....in green. FUCKING NOED. WOOHOO
---
I would have assumed you would have guessed I ran it at rank 1, I only recently retired to R10.
---
I was clarifying in case you decided to look up my stream since my only recent survivor games are R10
---
Red ranks getting hooked in the first minute of the game. 
---
People are stupid.  I can't trust that it's a joke.

Sureeeee

Deliverance = 100% I don’t take no chances.

As someone who's been called every name in the book, I can say firmly that being around hateful speech doesn't make you stronger or immune to it. Growing up around it, being desensitized to it, it doesn't suddenly cure you of all the shit you've been through. I'm not going to get "triggered" by it, it just makes me stop and think "oh, that person's a piece of shit." It isn't shielding anyone or being somehow coddling to not use terms that harken back to being burnt alive or lynched. Whether or not you acknowledge the power words have, or where they come from, I'd urge you not to play Devil's advocate with hate speech.
---
It's common knowledge that time=/skill in any game. If it was true you wouldnt see people who have 5k hours in games like rocket league, overwatch and csgo still be stuck in bronze and silver ranks. If you spent 3k of those hours just pallet looping, all you did was learn how to run around in circles for 3k hours. But good luck bragging about your 3k hours of running in circles. So much talent bro. 
---
brought to you by mememaker.com
---
you're\*
---
The only other idea I had for rampage (which sounds more true to its name than my above idea anyways) is that when you down someone, everyone on the map gets exposed for 20/25/30 seconds. 
---
But with the luck build u get almost every time 4 kobys instead of just yourself jumping of the hook 
---
Deliverance can't get ur team 4 kobys 😂
---
One tactic you can try if you either suspect they'll try flashlight blinding you to save their friend or have done it before, go to the downed survivor, stand by them but don't pick them up and then turn and hunt the flashlight user down.  
---
Otherwise face a wall or any sort of hard LOS.  Amanda is pretty short so she can get away with looking at LOS taller killers wouldn't.  
---
Also if they're storming the hook or not giving you reason to leave it, don't bother abiding by their silly rules of moving away or respecting that.  If overly altruistic survivors play stupidly, make them feel stupid.
---
Uhm.. You still haven't disproved my point?
---
You just made my day. I’ll do that after every game.
---
Slurp slurp 🤤
---
What's the alternative though? Just never playing this game with your friends, or 4 people muting themselves in Discord? Sadly it's a game, and not a super competitive one with an actual ranked ladder so people will play to have fun with their friends if there's a queue with friends mode. Muting yourself in Discord just to give a random Killer a fairer playing field will almost never be fun to people, so it's just a flaw in the game design more than people willingly "choosing" scummy tactics IMO.
---
Probably because it gets posted every 26 hours...
---
Anytime, I’m always happy to have people seeing both sides of every community and now they can see the garbage side. Also adding 3 more viewers isn’t really a whole lot, and making your kids and wife make accounts to follow you doesn’t really accomplish much but congrats, just remember the more popular your hate becomes the more danger you put your family in.
---
&gt;your only point was “if a chase lasted all game the killer is just bad” and yet there is plenty of gameplay showing killers getting looped and finessed for 3+ gens.
---
Yeah exactly. If they get looped and "finessed" for 3+ gens, THEY ARE BAD. You literally just repeated my point. (One of them).
---
&gt;It is the meta to Always go find your own gen and work on it, that’s why a runner build is META because one person is committing to being chased for 3/5 gens.
---
This is about DS, not genrushing. Genrushing is unfair, but that doesn't mean DS is. The point of getting the first hook is to make sure not all survivors are on gens. You don't HAVE to chase the obession.
---
&gt;The point is that I had plenty of success in R1 with it much like many others DS doesn’t get ran in R1 because it’s “decent”.
---
Ranks are about experience not skill. I'm not covering that.
---
&gt;If you don’t understand that, than I don’t know what to tell you.
---
I don't know what to tell YOU. It is like talking to a wall. You can't keep repeating the same things. I'm tired of responding to the same things. Please, bring up new points.
---
It is essential. You think Ruin gets cleansed seconds into the game because that's all you look for; it's pure bias.
---
As survivor in R1 ruin gets cleansed halfway into the game usually, sometimes never or very late into the game. Most survivors just plow through ruin anyways so it's not a big deal, but it's still essential. I would be surviving a lot more games if ruin didn't exist. Roughly 1/10 or 1/15 games does Ruin get cleansed immediately.
---
Franklins is worthless and annoying, so don't pick that up.

If you have the upgraded version of the console, just go for it and try and learn her! I played on pc when the game originally came out because I liked the idea so much even though I mainly play on Xbox (simply because it’s what most of my friends play on so I’d be lonely on pc) and ofc got to play nurse and loved her back in 2016. I’d eventually branch out to other killers but obv nurse is what you want to play if you want your actions to be interactive instead of reactive, so I’ve stuck with her as my main since I got her and still going. The game did eventually come out for console, so over time I switched to Xbox, and restarted my career there. Nurse definitely has the advantage of a lack of sensitivity restrictions and better performance on pc, but I still play her just as fine and just as broken as I played her and play her every now and then on pc. If you want to learn her and be the god nurse you aspire to be, just go for it and don’t be deterred by anyone saying nurse is harder to play or isn’t as good on console. Her disadvantages are really slight, and the only reason she’s made out to be so hard to play on console is because the fact that she has those minuscule disadvantages acts as a nice placebo for anyone to blame (even subconsciously) their first few bad matches with her on. Just remember that you’re gonna take a fat L your first series of matches, and that’s okay! As per the words of Shia lebouf, just do it my man!
---
Just appreciate the shitpost

No tips, but I feel you, mate - had some terrible games today as well, last one with some incredibly rude SWF team right after another already moderately obnoxious - in-game and post-game - losing a game, even badly, is one thing, it's over eventually, but people feeling the need to be a bunch of absolutely awful shitbags for no reason just really gets to me - I didn't get angry in the way of starting to throw insults, it just... kind of makes me lose faith in humanity, or rather strengthens my faith that a way too high amount of people are basically absolute bastards. Of course that's an overreaction, and I've heard the "thick skin" nonsense a million times for decades, can't help it, only works for me to the degree of *pretending* not to care. Then I realize I want to play games to relax, not to get stressed and misanthropic over - that's what I go to work for already. I had already quit this game before because of the people (although repetitiveness from overplaying it played a part as well), friends (it's not like SWF itself is a bad thing even if voice communication kind of screws the balance, just some fucking people are just that frustrating...) and the gameplay got me back recently. But playing with random people is just absolutely not fun sometimes, some are really nice but it's always the assholes that you remember. Man, this was like 3 hours ago and I'm still fuming.

Oh, people who don't acknowledge there being valid viewpoints besides their own are narrowminded idiots. Thus you are right. You can hurt people by insulting them and also trying to make them feel bad about something by using words desinged to dehumanize them.  
---
The only time I think people should be less sensitive is when the words aren't used in a negative context. On twitch for example for a while there was a phrase "vodf-word". It wasn't in any way aimed at gay people. It was a joke about people who are the ones only showing up for the vods. And someone shouldn't lose their shit and get hurt cause the word is used in _any_ context. If however people use slurs to hurt people, they are scumbags.  
---
I have to say, I simply have another opinion on the value of desensitizing. People shouldn't face actual hate, but making words have less or barely any meaning is a good thing. In that regard me and my best friend call each other f-word on a regular basis (Hes straight, I am bisexual if that matters). Another case is a girl that is very close to my heart. She is trans. She on herself started making a few trap jokes about herself. When she did that, I joined into it and made sure to use that phrase always in good fun with positive intention. Not really because I believe people should suck it up, but rather so that words don't forever keep a hurtful, negative connotation. Similar to how one black dude calling another his bro, his n-word is a good thing.  
---
It's not that I am an absolute free speech extremist. I am very free speech oriented, but the reason that I believe words shouldn't be "Voldemordt" is because that only makes them more powerful, even acknowledges them as being destructive. Like as dumb as it sounds... imagine we could achieve in the world that 99/100 people would use one slang word to refer to someone as "their best friend". Would it really keep being as hurtful? Like imagine someone coming up to you. "Damn, friend. Pah." It would be confusing, maybe even funny.

---
Boil over isn’t bad if you want to get a surprise DS off, as it buys you extra time (even if it won’t help you get off normally) to wiggle to 35%. It’s not a setup you’d run normally but if you’re playing with a friend or friends who are also bringing DS it’s alright.
---
Yeah just type oink and leave the chat lobby they'll be very tilted man
---
Looks safe to me
---
I don’t use it on  all my killers, only the ones I’m bad with.
---
You make who you are pretty obvious even over internet and if I know anything about people it’s that they don’t stick around for people like you. And I’m not threatening you, I’m trying to point out your poor decisions before you hurt yourself and your family. I have all the life I could ever need but the more you try to trash people and cause hate the more likely that hate will hurt you and the ones you love. You really need the help man, but first you have to admit to it
---
Well for the most part i feel like Rule set No.2 becoming part of her base kit and it being changed, along with her ultra rares are super OP. Reduces the timer by 2 minutes? Doesn’t it only last like 2:30 minutes? You can just use another addon to remove time (Idk how much it removes nor its names I just remember Monto using it). The key thing where it removes first try is honestly a good idea, but all the boxes you add and removing the ability to see the boxes with a 30 second timer would just make a game against pig “dont do gens”. 
---
Damn I refuse to play against p3 Claudettes, flashlight/toolboxes, or legions! /s about Claudettes and items but legion isn’t fun and if I’m playing 4 stack swf we’ll just disconnect. Doesn’t screw anyone over and allows us to not sit through 10+ minutes of pointless running simulator. Still tho it isn’t very cash money of you to disconnect unless you’re in a four stack, which even then is still hella cheap to hoe the killer like that, but if you’re solo then you’ve just ruined the match for your mates. 
---
Plus, if you’re only playing to win, then yah you’re gonna get annoyed with it, but personally me and my friends like playing against stuff like tombstone Myers. It’s not likely we’re gonna win, but it’s gonna be pretty scary/intense and we’ll be having a good laugh about it.
---
And insulting instead of making a actual argument tipical thing kids or people with a low level of intelect usually do, something you obviously still do.
---
Smol billy is photo-bombing. Good billy.
---
And I hate getting paired with rank 15s becayse the survivors are crap but, unlike rank 20, the killer starts grasping whats going on.
---
When I play killer if I intended to give someone hatch why does it matter of I carry them to it or the wriggle free? 
---
Had a game the other night where a friend of mine was last to die then killer sends a message 
---
"If you didn't struggle I would have given hatch idiot"
---
Was so confusing and makes no sense, how was my friend to know this? Also as I said if you really wanted to give hatch what does it matter how they get there?
---
The only thing that makes her difficult is the frame rate. Once they fix that a little more then I'll continue to work with her. I can do decent with her. A kill or 2 but I want to be as good as I am with her as I am with huntress. I love her.
---
Respectable

Imagine being that close to Myers 😍

Nope

I had a game like this recently playing as Dwight. All the gens were done, and I couldn’t find the killer, so I figured it was a Basement Bubba. I decided to try to make friends with this peculiar creature. Perhaps, as an equally misunderstood character, I could get through to him. I readied myself, offering of a flashlight in hand, and descended into his lair. It was mere moments before his gaze was fixated upon me.
---
There was no revving of a chainsaw, only silence. Strengthening my resolve, I slowly approached the Basement Bubba. With sweaty palms, I dropped the flashlight, and pointed towards the offering. He swiftly smacked me with his mallet, but quickly backed off afterwords. My mission was a partial success. I had given him a flashlight, and lived to tell the tale. 
---
Surmising that this Basement Bubba did not see me as a threat, I began to plunder the chest in the corner opposite to where he was standing. By the time I heard the cries of an angry lunatic, it was too late. 
---
Meg watched from the stairs as the Basement Bubba lifted my body from the blood soaked floor. I did not struggle. It was not the Basement Bubba who was at fault. My brash actions were to blame. I set my controller down, conceding to death. It did not come. I felt the familiar, cold floor beneath me, and two rugged hands rubbing my butt.
---
I do not know what compelled that Bubba to show me mercy on that foggy night, and I likely never will. I can, however, take solace in knowing that there may be a shred of humanity left in these vicious creatures. That knowledge is enough.

---
Feel bad for the trapper. He seems to be a real baby. He tried to stand in front of the exit door so people are scared of opening it.
---
I see what your saying about vigil, but the reason i think it should nullify effects instead of reduce the timer is because most things that cause status effects don't have one. Sloppy and 3rd seal both don't have them, and they are probably the 2 biggest effect perks. The only addons that have effects are from the huntress, clown and hag, I think. Currently, it is kinda useless unless your fighting those 3, while my proposal could be used more. I mean, if it is to strong, it could maybe cut the timer down by half instead. (I personally like the Exposed thing, but your right, it could be OP). 
---
As for the aura reading in Pharmacy, i think that sound good! It would have to be kinda small, like 12 meters max to keep it as more of a bonus, but it would work well i think. 
---
That’s messed up mate, might as well start dodging swf or any set of people that join at the same time because it would ruin my fair experience as well. You’re right in that you won’t usually win games where the killer brings a mori, but if you only play this game to win and get better and never to have fun then you’re experiences with this game are not gonna be good man. Wait till you hear all the other unbalanced game changing stuff that’s in this game man; you’ll never want to play either side ever again.
---
My girlfriend is rank 9 and was put with rank 2 survivors.. Very odd
---
Well making Rule Set No. 2 apart of her base kit isn't a new idea, many Pig mains have been asking for this one.
---
Also the new Rule Set No. 2 is kinda a weird one. You might want read it again because it doesn't just reduce the time by 2 minutes. Also Tampered Timer doesn't stack. I made sure to add the part in for that particular reason.
---
Sure it’s a legit strat but it’s a really bad idea
---
Know nothing about? I have completed the game, fully, and Legion has been my main since they came out. FM isn't as bad as people say, and besides, it doesn't matter anyway. Salty survivors such as yourself are just going to review bomb the game until they change it, so what does it matter? Idgaf about FM because I know by the time it trickles down to consoles they will have hastily changed it to appeal to their survivor player base. You're fucking stupid.
---
i didn’t say anything about winning wtf? it’s about fun. it’s not fun getting tunnelled off hook then having the game finished just like that. if they use a mori, they’re the type of person to tunnel. not enjoyable so why should i play it?
---
Just be prepared to get some hate for using that perk. Survivors usually say something along the line as "baby killer needs NOED to win".
---
Yeah I can’t speak for everyone else but I can speak for myself when I say it’s not just “survivor mains” downvoting you.
---
It's totally okay to teabag when a killer facecamps
---
Alot assume a lether face will camp and its not entirely unfounded

Just because there could be worse doesn’t mean people don’t want better. Why they choose to whine about their problems is beyond me, but still.

You just said in another post you don't use that word, but now you do with a friend regularly? If I'm totally honest I don't care what words you use in public or private, affectionately or with malice, I just thought it might be worth saying in case you wanted to avoid hurting someone you know accidentally. It seems really, really basic to me that someone might not know you're joking or might not find it funny, and saying they're being a bitch or need to toughen up is about par for the course for that attitude. I get a 4chan vibe from that. I don't really care though. I'm going to be overly honest and admit I think you use those words, affectionately and otherwise, because the way you spout off anti-PC, anti-SJW rhetoric is really familiar to me. So I've already made a snap judgement, I might be wrong, but when I get that feeling I go with my gut and I'm gone. It's what a lot of people like me do too when they hear hate speech--I good, I'm gone.
---
Thank you for your help mate. Exactly that! Still no bigger rewards for reaching devotions...
---
Nope, especially megs.
---
But like as a permanent replacement for Ruin, no. Like if he plans on using it when only one or two survivors have items it's useless. Really only good against SWF 
---
/u/Spoiled_Soul this sub needs you and your amazing work! You don't have to justify yourself, but if you can't do them anymore (for whatever reason) it would be great to hear it from you officially, so maybe someone else can follow in your footsteps.

I don't understand why they need to be overly aggressive against legion players and always restating the same info we already know since he's been released, that is that he's annoying to verse/takes no skill to play, it's like worse than the dbd steam forums.

When you get hooked, and the only other survivor us down, and you manage to Cirque du Soleil off the hook and get the hatch.... mmmm.... no better feeling.
---
What I love is those who whine about tunneling... This is basic logic.  A predator has two prey.  Who do they go after?  The bleeding or the healthy?  
---
My all time best, though, was when it was two left.  Gates open.  I hook one and stay nearby.  Friend leaves and he dies.  After game, as expected, I got salty mail about camping the hook.
---
"I simply gave your friend a choice between your life or his."
---
Agreed. Noed isn't as much of a problem when playing SWF but a lot of solo players see it and just leave, even if you helped them the entire game. The perk itself promotes bad teamwork and encourages them to just leave someone behind and save themselves. 
---
Just hearing any slang word without a context hurting you is in my opinion a sign that you should try to fix that situation. If we put it in the context of people using it against you, that is unacceptable. Yet, just randomly hearing or reading one slang word being enough to hurt you (by the way not talking about you directly, but in general whenever it affects someone that hardcore) then there is a problem you want to look into. And you should indeed thoughen up. That is my stance on it.

And what about this + dying light?

Let me put this in simple words for the survivors who do rage about this.

You are the meat that goes on the hook to die, or get lucky and escape.  If you don't enjoy getting hooked and dying, I have a few choices here;  git gud, play killer, or play something else.
---
I am not responsible for the pain you suffer when you play.  You chose to be here.
---
'nerfed into a hex' so what you're saying is that they should 'rebuff' it so it only lasts 120 seconds after the last gen is done? Because I am very on board with that idea. Even better if people would consider it a buff.

How did they?
