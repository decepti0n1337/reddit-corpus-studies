What like a Terrorist and a 9/11 victim? Lol no, people would rightfully get pissed.
---
---
---
Typically the meta at the moment is borrowed time, DS, Adrenaline, and sprintburst/ dead hard/ Balanced landing. 
---

---
Borrowed time for easy hook saves
---
Adrenaline for getting everyone healed once the last gen gets finished
---
Decisive strike because its basically a get out of jail free card
---
And (Insert Exhaustion Perk here) because they're all good in their own ways.
---
I would love to get some of these as posters.
---
I should say i don't condone this but this is why so many survivors rage quit tbh.
---
I doubt Daddy Yamaoka would have the same power as Rin. Given the backstory he'd likely have a more brutal, rage based power.
---
The only new survivor perk that is even somewhat meta is Inner Strength from Nancy.
---
Fun perks would be Head On from Jane and maybe Deliverance from Adam.
---
‚ÄúPerk is broken and it sucks‚Äù ‚Äújust don‚Äôt use the perk 4head!‚Äù Seriously? That‚Äôs a lot like saying ‚Äúsounds are broken again, just don‚Äôt use sounds!‚Äù If shits broken it‚Äôs not unfair to want it fixed
---
You're fine. That build is still very good and the only real thing I would switch out is self care for either inner strength for faster (albeit more situational) healing or borrowed time for riskier hook saves.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, killers are just as toxic.
---
Its sound effect files for the next DLC but OP ain't to bright and thinks its nea related
---
Don't set any goal, have fun and before you know it, ranking up will be as effortless as it gets. Don't grind for ranks because they don't mean anything, just try to lose your fear of the killer and have an active play style rather than stealth.
---
Excellent, thank you very much!
---
So there's something hidden in the gif. I paused the gif to pull up to old spirit teaser and when I went back to the gif 3 japanese symbols appeared in a gray box like a subtitle scrolling downwards, like the Japanese lettering on the wall. Like a dummy I clicked on the gif again and it went away. Not sure how I got it to come up......
---
Interesting post. Thank you!
---
Oh I already use legion a lot and I have leather face too so that should be easy to do thanks again!
---
Okay that sounds good. Thank you :)
---
Happy to help!
---
You‚Äôre obsessed with hazbin hotel
---
He getting ready for a suprise backstab.
---
Definitely just play for fun. The moment you start caring about your rank the game just becomes frustrating. These days it just feels like a task for me to play the game because instead of enjoying it I'm constantly trying to outdo myself. But in a game like this there's only so much you can do by yourself
---
To be fair it's the only theory with an ounce of thought behind it
---
Just because The Entity took Rin because of her rage doesn‚Äôt mean Mr. Yamaoka was left behind.
---
Like how a lot of people want Jack the Ripper? Me too pal. Me too
---
Not even a little if a killer moris everyone on one hook he still depips but a survivor could be losing but still escape and pip as long as they had some altruism or evader. Like a mori you still have to chase, down, hook then they have to be saved then you have to find and possibly chase and down again to do it that wastes time which could result in losing. A key on the other hand, you find hatch push one button and leave. Then you have cases like killer finds hatch closes it starts patrolling gates and survivor finds a key opens hatch and leaves, but if one survivor goes unhooked by the killer he cant get moried but no you‚Äôre right its the same thing.
---
Why not have his girlfriend Tiffany in her human form as a killer and Chucky can be incorporated into her power or something? Could help get rid of the whole too small to carry survivors issue.
---
Rins lore is only good because it's super fucked up and graphic.
---
Any other lore would be "rin had a bad day at school" unless they make up even more dark shit but the devs weirdly arent into making dark themed killers
---
Yeah, level up Leatherface first and get his perk if you don't already, it'll help you out a lot
---
has to be in custom game mode if i‚Äôm not mistaken. hold x and move the curser around
---
Your bias is showing

I dunno man, they seem pretty damn common. I get a key in every bloodweb and when I‚Äôm killer theres a key in every other match. Not to mention the fact that plunderers is almost guaranteed to give you a key in one of the three boxes that spawn by default.
---
I'm pretty sure he's talking about a serial killer and one of their victims and I'm sure you understood that also. Obviously you're example would be a bad one.
---
I actually enjoy this play style, setting goals for myself, improving and ranking up. I find games to be kind of pointless when there‚Äôs not a little bit of a competitive edge. 
---
It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone but it‚Äôs the most fun for me.
---
You can get 2 pieces right now, unless you‚Äôre trying for full costumes
---
Okay but can you dispute anything I just said?
---
My Freddy build is Franklin's, nurses, remember me, and BBQ.
---
Rank 1-2 as well. Freddy doesn't need ruin or pop IMO
---
Looks like a shadow to me.
---
I seriously don't wanna think about what Ted Bundy's Mori would be....
---
I thought adept plague was easy, i got it the first day i had her
---
I remember I was really high the first time I watched that movie, it was one helluva ride.
---
Same here. I always joke that I'm like a T-Rex, because my vision on killer is based almost entirely on movement.
---
Ahhhhhh yes, my faverit kiler. BuBbA
---
And you‚Äôre so biased towards the majority opinion that you don‚Äôt even understand what im saying
---
Younger Rin would be very interesting. Would they have her killing herself if the spirit went in the game.
---
That's not really a territory I want behavior to dive into though
---
My concern is for the amount of DC's that'll occur from a wave of Spirit games.
---
You get 60 serums from the rift.
---
Each outfits costs 30 - so you can get 2 outfits.
---
You can also buy each piece of an outfit separately for 10 serums.
---
Everyone in Legion except Frank is a minor.
---
I would hope so, my only concern is the  amount of DC's that'll follow.
---
The teachable will continue to show in your bloodweb until you buy it. You can just ignore it if you want, but it will continue taking up one of the perk slots in the bloodweb.
---

---
I don't have a ton of hours playing killer, but I like playing it and I'm alright. But it is really disheartening when you're trying to learn how to play it and you get toxic SWF stacks and people shit talking you when you don't 4k. I try to play fair, and even give second chances if I'm rolling them. But whether I do great or do poorly, there's still trash talk and it makes me not want to play killer.
---
Cool cool üòÉ I would recommend trying Pig, she was the first killer I learnt on and she‚Äôs pretty fun
---
BHVR makes the most conflicting bugs, this is clearly not intended but its so smooth and transitions well.  It's like for everything they fix the bugs make it better.
---
Need is subjective but you definitely want it to exploit gen tappers, ive popped a nearly complete gen to 0 cause of them
---
Welcome to every single one of my games in purple ranks. Constant red ranked SWFs, even went against rank 1s as R8.
---
God I cannot wait for reset, the ranking system is one of the stupidest things ever in this game.
---
Np!
---
If they decided to make her father as a killer they need to make her as a survivor before her father killed her.
---
You can‚Äôt exactly hook yourself if the killer decides to let you live. Just let them be salty, you did nothing wrong.
---
If you did not give any locations or unhook in front of the killer or anything like that you are fine
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here‚Äôs how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor‚Äôs rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)**
---
 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;* New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there‚Äôs no other new players queuing.
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019

](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/92295/developer-update-september-2019)
---
#This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.
---
It‚Äôs one of my ninth grade vocabulary words, and we teach it with a ‚ÄúZ.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even realize it could be spelled differently.
---
Or a survivor had enough of this shit lol
---
I wish Claudette could look like that in game nice drawing
---
Is that it because I have only played for 2 days
---
There aren‚Äôt other options of dead hard. Just saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use that perk then‚Äù is pretty ridiculous, because it‚Äôs a perk they want to use. Devs should definitely fix DH, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre doing their best. But dismissing people that can‚Äôt use a perk they want to use because of a glitch is just pointless. If it were anything else it would be perfectly reasonable for the person to want it fixed, so why does it being a perk change that?
---
So into it. Imagine if the tweet today is teasing this as an add on too.
---
Fair enough, good luck out there
---
Lmao yall will talk shit about literally any build like you aint throwing bricks in glass house
---
The color adds a lot to the cross hatch work good job!
---
FUCKING RAD
---
Jesus, calm down. Why are you so upset about me for having a different play style and enjoying different things?
---
You just sound salty about something. Like since you got to rank one and didn‚Äôt enjoy it, I‚Äôm not allowed to either. Why u heff 2 be mad, is only game
---
With how the other survivors look, they're not very good stories.
---
Stunning the killer after unhooking yourself should be an ability that is an addition to another perk. For example like fixated where you walk faster and get to see your scratch marks or pharmacy where you open chests faster and you‚Äôre guaranteed a green medkit
---
Ruin is honestly a wasted slot considering how trash its totem placements are
---
If you hit a survivor and see them panic and run into a wall, you've already won
---
You're the one bragging about it lul
---
Encountered the same thing on ps4. I was so confused then I clicked that it was a wraith. Haha
---
You can do whatever you want, people are just giving you advice. Rank in this game is just broken, and the higher you are the worse the games are. This is not really a competitive game, and unless you want to play the same build over and over again for absolutely no rewards other than you feeling good, your best bet is to stay around middle ranks where you can actually experiment with some interesting builds instead of tryharding for no reason. Most people in this game set their goals for other stuff like unlocking perks, learning killers, playing various builds, getting achievements/archives etc.
---
But hey, you do you.
---
The way he hit you down was hilarious. Like swatting a fly out of the air
---
YEEEAAAH BOIIIIIII
---
pig is really cute in this aweeeee
---
Yes, Freddy was played by actor Robert Englund in every film except the remake. So Freddy‚Äôs codename was a hint to his identity, but none of the other ones were (Legion was codename Kenya, Spirit was codename Haiti I think, etc.)
---
This is a trailer?  Isn‚Äôt like 6 seconds GIF on repeat? More like a clue to something about to happen than a trailer for new content
---
The middle katana in the first pic is a shadow. Might've been a PTB bug, because Rin's father took the middle katana in the [First Cut](https://youtu.be/lv35nylikfU) teaser. The shadow isn't there in [this more recent pic](http://imgur.com/a/wnpn3X9).
---
However, the bottom katana is *not* a shadow and is missing in the second pic.
---
Been asking myself this same question dude it‚Äôs ridiculous. Played near 20 games today and probably 9 of them dropped
---
‚ÄúYou wanna blend, Claudette? ILL SHOW YOU BLENDING‚Äù
---
The problem isn‚Äôt haddonfield, the problem is if someone uses an offering for that map they most likely have balanced landing and would of told survivors in the lobby to put it on too
---
Happened to me with the hatch just a texture bug.
---
Yeah, but I mean it‚Äôs not impossible. I just hope for a balanced killer that‚Äôs meh difficulty for both mains and no complaining from either side. Never gonna happen of course but one can hope.
---
Yeah I found out the hard way the other day that you are entirely vulnerable for the entire animation from start to finish
---
I didn‚Äôt want to know what to prioritize. I know what I prioritize! I prioritize ranking up.
---
This is so weird lol. You really do seem upset about ranks. 
---
It‚Äôs fine that you shared your opinion, that doesn‚Äôt bother me. It‚Äôs more that when I said thanks but that‚Äôs not for me, you became argumentative and seemed upset that I don‚Äôt want to play the game like you do.
---
Like the other commenter said, calm blue oceans. Breathe.
---
I‚Äôd assume the Katanas are stuck there just like the hatchets are stuck in the lockers.
---
Bro, I'd love to see actual comics on the killers backstories, maybe even comics providing non-cannon stories. I'm only hoping, tho.
---
This video goes so hard...and Jason like always just killin it....he just wants to party with him and the bois...
---
Not for freddy lol
---
Oh boy, NOW I get it. It only takes into account the ranks of the adversaries. I was wondering why I keep getting lobbies with rank 15 to red. I sit at rank 9 right now.
---
This makes for hilariously lopsided games where I destroy two rank 15 players in the first minute and then go on long chases against the red rank players. 
---
Must be fun on the other end.
---
What do u think ?
---
Can we get some customization or outfits for The Cannibal?
---
Huntress was a little girl who seen her mom die and had to raise herself while she adopts other lost kids *some who she made orphans* but because she didnt know how to act she didnt know about child care and let them die 
---
The plague was a deeply religious woman duped by the entity into becoming its servant
---
I fail to see any connections to what you're trying to make
---
Yea my theory was either this week or next week there will be some sort of reveal maybe? Idk
---
I thought they did tease one for Freddy's rework? There was an image of claw marks that they tweeted out, I'll link it as soon as I can find it
---
I agree with mostly this I don‚Äôt think it should deplete 100% and they used to have the directional phasing and it made her super predictable. I agree I think that a character that‚Äôs built around mind games should be more about the mind game as for the 100% depletion I think 25%-50% would be alright because there are time where I miss click and I don‚Äôt feel like people should be punished that hard for a mistake.
---
Codenames doesnt mean shit
---
Yeah I can imagine after I hit red I‚Äôll lose some steam, but I‚Äôd still like to try.
---
What‚Äôs the average rank, in your opinion?
---
That spirit looks fucking amazing, love it!
---
Quick and quiet is also a fun perk if you want to play a more immersed play style. You can sprint around corners and jump into a locker /through a window without the Killer hearing anything.
---
Quite often the killer just runs past you confused.
---
&gt;To put Plague into perspective her Killer-specific achievement to down Survivors who are at max infection is owned by less than 1% of the playerbase on Steam. I know she's pretty new but the fact that less than 1% of the playerbase has essentially used her power says a lot about her. I got that achievement in about 2 to 3 matches of playing her so it's not like it's hard.
---
I get what you're saying, but achievements are a terrible way to look at this. Trapper's achievement is only 0,7% higher than Plague's and he's been around since day 1. Only around 41% of players have even ranked up once as well. It's also impossible to get her achievement done in 2 or 3 matches as you need to down 50 survivors, so that bit isn't true either.  
---
I'm not disagreeing that she should be looked at, for various reasons on both sides, but these stats don't really mean anything.
---
Lol yeah well true but I don't wanna annoy everyone ya know?
---
I watched a rank 17 Dwight run with his head at a 45 degree angle full backwards run through a wall yesterday........... Rank 16 dont mean what it used to mean after that.
---
exactly. this is just way too situational for anyone to use. only way it'd work is with deliverence but no one would want to to waste 2 perk slots just to dehook themselves and stun a killer who might not even be camping
---
Maybe I‚Äôm a try hard but I see basically any game as something you can either be good at or bad at, and I think the ranking system is at least some indication of that skill level. If you do more gens, win more chases, unhook more teammates and survive more, you rank up. You‚Äôve done good, you‚Äôve honed your skill.
---
I was a total potato the first few times playing and I like to see my skill at the game increase as my rank goes up. It seems like a pretty good indicator of that.
---
I was stumped til the end lol
---
You're mending 80% of the game.
---
Michael Myers is dope. Can‚Äôt wait for his next movies.
---
Rank reset is going make you play with used to be red ranks
---
True but you depip for winning as hillbilly
---
Nah, I¬¥m going away for a week tomorrow so when I come back the tryhards will already be higher up again.
---
It actually does look pretty creepy
---
r/foundthereddittracker
---
Smart
---
The Huntress is inspired Baba Yaga. The Plague is inspired by the Exorcist and off real priestesses in Babylon. Those are the connections I‚Äôm making. Nothing is original.
---
See if the devs acknowledged it anywhere and submit a support ticket if you don't
---
I have such mixed feelings if he is the next killer. It's pretty cool that two killers would be connected for the first time, but having two characters potentially be similar aesthetically is a bit eh. We have the situation already where there's a ton of people with knives and they'd be sharing a map etc.
---
Die with it and your bro takes it out winning
---
Could you reiterate that?
---
Yeah, it would only be useful against killers who basically face camp which is something that nobody really does these days.
---
Killers amaze me. I just had a killer today who was camping a dwight and blamed us for gen rushing then I specifically said, "maybe next time you should stop camping and actually chase survivors." IMMEDIATELY after I said this, he says, "alright next time I see you I am putting a red mori." (This was a rank 3 Leatherface btw).
---
I understand that both sides can be toxic, but it just amazes me how killers act towards toxicity. Like, if you disagree with them a little bit or you annoy them a little bit, they just target you next game and who can stop them? As a survivor, you jump into a lobby not knowing who the killer is at all. On the other hand, the killer can see who you are and what you could be using (ex: Med kit, type of survivor, etc.). Fortunately for me, I never got that killer again, but what I am trying to say is that killers have it easy when dealing with players they don't like. This LF isn't the first btw, I have met many toxic killers that just target people who come into their lobby and prep the harshest builds ever. Hell, I remember when there was this toxic killer who kept targeting me every time I jumped into his lobby (he would put red mori and top tier killer w/ NOED) and I was fed up with it so I told him, "how about I jump as killer and you switch over to survivor" and its so surprising to me how scared they get or how hypocritical they get. They go like, "well no, I am not going to switch to survivor because you are just going to tunnel and camp me and there is no way I can escape." I'm over here, "Like no shit! That's the point!"
---
Sorry if I vented. This post really triggered some bad memories dealing with toxic killers.
---
What did you need the reminder for?
---
Alright so in this situation I should call 911, let them know, and then take Mrs.Piggy to court?
---
I feel like GPU programs should have colorblind mode options in the first place so that colorblind people see everything clear at ALL times.
---
Oh yeah that‚Äôs true. Regardless, the map could be related to the new survivor. It doesn‚Äôt have to be tied to the killer
---
I got jumped by a Nea with iron will! The entity is scary when it inhabits a human
---
Survivors don‚Äôt like anything that makes them adapt or change their perceived gameplan. They want to do 5 generators, run a few circles, drop a few pallets, and all escape.
---
**Anything that changes that is deemed unfun**.
---
Legion changes that. Legion changes the game‚Äôs, and therefore the survivor‚Äôs, healing mechanics. Legion slows the game down, which means the generators aren‚Äôt getting done as fast as the survivors want. Legion forces the survivors to play in a vastly different way.
---
So Legion is unfun.
---
Nurse skipped loops and walls. Spirit skips the heartbeat mechanic and changes chases. Plague changes damage and healing. All are unfun if you listen to survivors.
---
There‚Äôs a pattern to what survivors have been complaining about, and it‚Äôs not a pattern brought on by anything that‚Äôs changed. Spirit and Plague have been the same for months, yet the cry of ‚ÄúUnfun!‚Äù has only started in the past few weeks.
---
Survivors are crybabies. Don‚Äôt listen to survivors.
---
Cutie cunts everywhere bursting into tears as their leader makes his comeback
---
Never give them the satisfaction
---
Run detection perks instead to get a feel for where Survivors like to go. A powerful hex throws off their movement because they have to look for it.
---
Literally any other exhaust perk, DH is a great perk, but it makes people make easy mistakes during looping and they end up dying bc of it.
---
SB is still the best anyways.
---
not only that, they would need to hit that 4% without deliverance
---
Bruh just loop smh
---
Spirit is getting a rework? Why? What has been said about this? Do you mean like a full freddy rework? Or art or something lol..
---
Want to look good sitting around the corner of the basement with insidious waiting for someone to go for a save so I can body block and chainsaw them both
---
dont care
---
There was no previous cases of that. But it could happen honestly.
---
She lights up.
---
In a perfect world.
---
There's more nuance to it, though. Trapper and Hag can control the area with their traps and discourage Survivors from running around recklessly, but they don't actually stop the players from running. Hillbilly and Cannibal can down Survivors in one hit if they use their chainsaw, but they also might need to use regular attacks so healing is not always wasted on them. Nurse's Calling is a perk that encourages Survivors to be more careful when healing, but they can still opt to do so if they want to. All of these are examples of how gameplay can be changed up while keeping things interesting.
---
By contrast, the Plague's power is one that practically shuts down healing. You might as well throw away any medkits, forget you ever brought any perks devoted to healing, and never think about it again for the rest of a trial against her. Sure, you can cleanse and enable healing, but then you're probably going to lose, so why would you bother? On top of that, there's no way to communicate these mechanics to newbie Survivors on your team and the game does a bad job of teaching them on its own.
---
There's a difference between changing up the gameplay dynamics for the better, and completely shutting down elements of the gameplay entirely.
---
Legion and Stranger Things are the closest ones.
---
"Survived" has to be replaced with "Entity Displeased" for them.
---
Pls, tell me the killer gave you the hatch.
---
Doctor's power doing nothing to help in a chase? Bruh, he literally stops survivors from vaulting or dropping a pallet with a well-timed shock. That quite literally ends chases early.
---
The tomes are free and nobody is guaranteed to like any paid content regardless.
---
Your build can really be useful. I should try It.
---
You must be a basement bubba
---
&gt; To those bitching in the comments that it doesn‚Äôt matter Marth is currently doing hardcore dbd killer challenge where it‚Äôs a fresh account and he has to go from rank 20 to rank 1, if anyone escapes on a killer he has to stop playing them until he‚Äôs out of lives/killers and every thing is fresh with no perks
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So while a normal dc game like this is annoying it‚Äôs especially annoying because it means he deranks and is another pip away from possibly loosing the challenge.
---
Who's hosting this challenge and what are the prizes?
---
i was, i use it to my advantage when its close and only about two of the 6 games did i even get a basement hook, survivors werent even all too bad either.

I need these on posters, they're incredible!
---
See, characters like Adam almost kind of annoy me, because this is the only perk of his I actually want but dont want to level him to get it, and waiting for it in the shrine is just a gamble lol.
---
I almost 100% agree! I find that most legion players are actually survivor mains who play legion for the high bp they bring in, except I can't stand Ghostie, everyone who plays him on Xbox only play him to teabag you on hook. I also love DemoGordan Ramsey and Trappie mains, I always have fun against them :)
---
If there is a tome dedicated to the spirit, you're going to have to play spirit for some of those challenges Aka locking stuff behind a pay wall
---
Wraith should be fully invisible, but have audible footsteps and move grass he walks through.
---
Walking through walls might be a bit much, but Wraith should walk through pallets and be impossible to stun with them. It's obnoxious that he gets MORE stunned when hit while phased, and he would still be vulnerable while changing states, so he couldn't both be safe and able to attack.
---
Anything more than that might be a bit much to add at once.
---
Maybe he will embody the mask, and come in as a oni
---
Yeah for me the "cat" perk is also sooo useful with all this stealth killers and the spirit
---
rank 10 is the average.
---
people generally consider purple ranks as good and red ranks as best. the lines are blurred though with how many people are choosing to stay in purple ranks.
---
and for some advice.. after getting to your desired rank, just give up on the ranking system. you‚Äôll hear from a lot of people that purple ranks are better and it‚Äôs true. yeah, go ahead and reach your personal goal or whatever but in the long run rank one is an absolute headache.
---
Outside of a rage quit we get a cool concept. DBD giveth and DBD taketh away
---
Ah yes, a fellow blendette of culture
---
It's a ghost from Destiny
---
I'm half deaf. Can't tell where sounds are coming from.
---
Technically a "teaser trailer" which just recycled a old trailer
---
Return of the King
---
To true
---
I‚Äôll play quinten if he no look like entitty
---
Legion changes the damage and healing aspect of the game. His initial hit puts you into Deep Wounds instead of Wounded, and you need to mend before you Heal. If you're already Wounded, you still go to Deep Wounds if he uses his power, so there's a possibility that not healing is beneficial.
---
And yeah, Mending is tedious... It's supposed to be. That's how Legion slows down the game, by making you spend extra time healing instead of doing generators while he wears down the Survivors and their options. Sooner or later there won't be pallets, or survivors will be hooked enough times to die, and such. 
---
Is it "Fun"? Debatable. 
---
Does it need to be fun? Nope, **not at all**. The killer isn't your friend here to bring you happy, fun time. The killer is your opponent. That makes the game a zero-sum situation. More survivors need to realize this.
---
I actually would‚Äôve got it my first try if I hadn‚Äôt hooked on of my survivors only once, then it became a downward spiral of poor matchmaking and swf.
---
Could probably be a reskin of Spirit in the same way as how you can play as Julie or Frank
---
That's probably why you got 6 4ks,you're newish to the game and went against bad players
---
really? because In this video, the thumbnail has the same image:).

---
How can you tease a recycled trailer...
---
Honestly really like the tritanopia look. Makes the game spookier. Not to take away from the point of the post, hope the filters come soon!
---
Im newish to the terms not so much the game though, id say im not a newb gameplay wise atleast
---
Or Mama Yamaoka as the survivor. Have every member of the family involved in these trials
---
and isn't a pedo
---
Maybe that's the theme of onryo that inspired her, but her lore is pretty clear she wants "vengeance". And that "an oath was made". I don't think they can both exist as Killers, everything that fuels her would evaporate if her dad was promoted to Killer.
---
Premonition I think is better because you have a general direction of where the killer is coming from. I used this all the time back in the day as it was one of the original generic perks.
---
It helped with the wraith when he was some what strong. 
---
It helped massively when Freddy first came out. 
---
Spine chill just means the killer looked in your direction, but what you don't know. Which direction, is the killer even walking towards me? Did the killer see me?
---
Premonition gives the one advantage and that is direction.
---
how is noob ochido 2
---
What you get for cleansing /s
---
That‚Äôs actually fuckin big brain, never thought of that before
---
It's about the actors being willing to let BHVR use their likeness, and how much they'll charge for it. Even beyond the actual film companies.
---
Kyle Gallner -while an amazing actor -isn't as big as JLC, and is more willing to work with them on it.
---
T1 myers doesn‚Äôt need m&amp;a anymore, its still good on t2 though
---
Hex: Dedicated shitters: 3/4/5 seconds into the match you will automatically dc
---
Those pink moris tryna tell u something tho
---
Yeah that's not what I had in mind. I'm more of a devours hope and thrill of the hunt type of guy.
---
Yes please
---
The Entity drives him through a mental breakdown to murder his family, yeah. Perhaps as a killer he has a "crazy" mode where he's a bloodthirsty murderer, and a "sane" mode where he's a remorseful and terrified person not wanting to cause more pain
---
Makes ya wonder who the survivor's gonna be
---
Why does Meg look like Ax the Andolite from animorphs???
---
How about John Wayne Gacy? LOL
---
I love you, and this artwork. Ghost Face needs more fan art!!!
---
I like that its not too op, and its not too weak. 1 strong perk, 1 weak, but still helpful perk, and 1 in-between perk.
---
We are assuming he is a spirit, like the erm, spirit.
---
He could have been taken by the entity when he was the monster that he was whole alive. There entity takes from any time and place
---
This definitely seems plausible but I'm not sure how they would go about making a middle-aged salaryman into some kind of fearsome killer.
---
10/10 for steve usage, he‚Äôs our boi
---
This would be so cool, transmutations abilities between multiple existent killers in one new killer would be amazing. 
---
It would have to have the downsides very well done tho, imagine a blinking stealth killer with traps and shock therapy lmao
---
Wow! I like it. 
---
Only one suggestion thought
---
Keep up the good work
---
I‚Äôm saying that mending is a boring mechanic, and that‚Äôs why people dc against him. I‚Äôm not saying I agree or anything. I‚Äôm just saying that this is why everyone hates him. You can disagree all you want, but imo mending sucks and it‚Äôs not effective. 
---
Also, the thing about Legion is that he‚Äôs very easy to counter. Just drop a pallet on him and run away from other survivors when he goes into his Frenzy. He‚Äôll be lucky to hit one or two survivors. After that, you wait 30 seconds for his power to recharge. Also, mending doesn‚Äôt really slow the game down THAT much. It feels like a minor inconvenience more than anything. Plus, large maps are his biggest weakness.
---
I‚Äôm a killer maim btw. I feel you have a strong ‚Äúsurvivors=bad‚Äù complex. Sure, a lot of them are toxic but it‚Äôs just a game at the end of the day. Just because everyone hates a killer doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs broken or op. They just find him boring. Which I have to agree with
---
Even better when they're offline on Twitch and have no vods.
---
I can suck ya dick.  
---
  
---
#NO
---
Tbh when I play killer, if they do manage to get the gates open, I‚Äôve just stopped going to the exit gates because I know they‚Äôre gonna wait and teabag so I just don‚Äôt even want to give them the satisfaction even if they will give me a free hit. Just get out of the trial.
---
i love the casual shittalk/BM that happens but i guess i‚Äôm the only one. i crack up at all of them tbagging and vice versa when the killer is tbagging or something. it‚Äôs just part of the game meh
---
LOL your edit
---
&gt; It forces you to play some suboptimal builds, so that's kinda fun.
---
&gt; Get out there and rock some birds and basements.
---
Unless you prestige the smart way, by having a complete build in one character you play as while you dump bloodpoints on another.
---
It's not HORRIBLE, but I dont really like it. If you can get the charity case pack, sometimes I like to run the SxyHxy jacket and the bloody pants with a random choice of hair. 
---
I'd personally wait for P3, save up to 20 serum, and buy the Vigo's shirt and pants, then run that with the bloody face. 
---
If you ARE willing to spend money, I LOVE the military shirt with the bloody pants and the grey knitted cap. Totally worth the money.
---
This is a good opportunity to refresh your drink, I've found.
---
Hate the cunt
---
^^^^
---
Removed for highlighting unbalanced matchmaking
---
If that‚Äôs the case then they are running out of ideas.
---
Naw, man, that's so unsatisfying. Rin's dad needs to be a Survivor. The whole point of Rancor seems to be that Rin is fixated on the Obsession as though they were him.
---
Rancor Mori'ing him could even be an achievement. "Vengeance"
---
You suck at this game broah
---
I run at them backwards so i cant see them lol. Just leave silly.
---
Yes Officer, there's been a murder.
---
Being sweaty has never been harder. Do you tunnel the unhookee, or do you get that salty DC at the cost of BP?
---
Wish I could.
---
Could you imagine though? It could be like those ‚Äúquirks‚Äù the devs wanted to add to the survivors. Like each survivor having something that makes them unique about them to make them more than reskins of each other. Rin could have something that makes her some sort of ghastly type thing, where she is translucent when crouching or something.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs cold.
---
Does everyone see the same loading screen tips while going into a match? Wasn‚Äôt sure if the survivors in my matches were able to see the tips about my killer powers to give them a heads up or not.
---
I take more notice for a man of culture using STBFL on Hillbilly, STBFL is the best perk in the game even on killer that one shot
---
THAT'S why fans like Kane.
---
Not because he "was Jason" (although he IS), but because he's an all around decent dude who doesn't take himself seriously (cough Bruce Campbell cough cough).
---
Also, LOVING the fact that my above post somehow got negative votes...shows you what values people have when they downvote a username and not the content.
---
LOL.
---
Well, Rin is covered in shiny shards...and probably likes seafood.
---
But what if I have both B and C
---
That's really cool if it means something. Have the devs done anything like this before?
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs okay to vent. I get you
---
I played against a Ghostface the other day, and two gens popped while he was chasing a Nea. He camped the fuck out of her, and when I went to get her and saw him camping I tried baiting him out, but he downed me, carried me to the hook the nea was in, and slugged me at her feet like an idiot. When she died out, i was hooked. I wanted to kill myself and go to another game, but i wanted to make him work for his bm, and I stayed. 
---
On post endgame chat, once my teammates got all the gens and totems (he had NoED btw) he called them try hards and commented how he hated ‚Äúgen-rushers‚Äù and that‚Äôs why he camped. Tf?
---
People seriously need to take the game a little less seriously, and try to remember there‚Äôs a human trying to have fun and complete their objective (kill/survive) on the other side of the screen.
---
And you are right, when it comes to lobbies survivors are at a disadvantage (which makes sense, the killer is alone and if you see lots of items bring franlkins, a SWF bring good counters, in low ranks identify possible perks be the survivors you see) but ivories are annoying to go against and if they see prestige (even with solo queuers) the fuckers bring moris galore and op shit to bother the fuck out of everyone
---
Like, I wanna play the game too mate, and dying after my first hook against your prayer bead shit really makes the game stale and boring for us survivors
---
Nah. Prestige when you have nothing else to spend BP on.
---
Oh god, protanopia is like Ormond, but for every map
---
..what
---
Oh you poor thing. Enjoy the brown ranks while you can.
---
*Checks date* Preferably now.
---
True true unless the killer was being toxic first
---
Do you mean buying Spirit? Cuz you can get her for free...
---
Spirit/nurse but you can 360 billy easily.
---
Survivors dont see Killer tips and vice versa. The only time a survivor will know what killer it is from the tips is if it's their first time facing that killer.
---
You could‚Äôve hit him coming in and he still got in. Happens all the time personally
---
I can't stress enough that the strangers things chapter is not worth and that I want a refund so bad. I'd rather the devolpers actually just take the 20 from my hands and spit in my face then ever play that killer again.
---
Ps4 sorry. I wish there was cross play
---
I'm not saying only killers should have fun. I just understand that a competitive (as in a versus game, not competitive like professional) is near to a zero-sum situation in regards to fun. If the survivors have fun, that means the killer is having less fun. If the killer is having fun, the survivors are having less fun. Can there be overlap? Sure... Should one side be expected to weaken themselves for the benefit of the other? No.
---
If one side wants to weaken themself, sure. That's their choice. But for survivors to say "Killers shouldn't do this!!!" or killers to say "Survivors shouldn't do this!!!" is absurd.
---
And since we typically don't see Killers overly complaining about survivor mechanics (Keys being the one that gets the most complains), compared to Moris, Spirit, Plague, Nurse, Legion, NOED, Ruin, etc and etc and fucking etc... from the survivors side... Well... Survivors are crybabies.
---
And as I've started running Plague a lot, I've seen a ton of the Plague hate. It's there in game and it's here in the subreddit. It might not get far out of the New feed, but people are making the posts.
---
I can agree Spirit needs tweaking, but not because of the reasons most survivors are complaining about. It's not a matter of "Fun" or "Fair" (Because they're your opponent, see above), but it's a matter of interactivity and ability to counter the change in mechanic.
---
Spirit isn't interactive. Spirit is "Guess which way to go and pray" and if you're wrong, you're dead. It's a luck aspect for the survivors, where-as the Spirit can use skill to increase their odds (Breathing, reading the survivors actions, etc...). There's no counter other than a single perk that may or may not be useful, and in all honesty even that isn't enough of a counter. So Spirit doesn't need a nerf because she's unfun or unfair, she needs a nerf to add interactivity to the Survivor side of playing against the Spirit.
---
Look at the Plague. People say she's unfun and unfair... But she has interactivity -- Do you cleanse or no? If you cleanse, you open up Corrupted Purge, which is a huge increase in her chasing power. If you don't cleanse, you're broken and downed in one hit, but if you can loop and escape chases you may be fine.
---
But if you open Corrupted Purge, her chasing power increases, but her area control decreases since she can't puke on objects. And if you can stealth for 60 seconds, then the Corrupted Purge is meaningless. And if the fountain is far away from the area you're in, the Corrupted Purge is less than useful.
---
There's a lot going on there in making that decision, and that's what makes it interactive. That's what makes it balanced. Is she "Fun"? Debatable.  If you 3-gen yourself against a Plague you are not going to have fun, but that's more an issue of you 3-genning yourself. But a team of survivors can work together to overcome the disadvantages Plague imposes, and do so often enough.
---
And that's a good thing. Different Killers impose different disadvantages, require survivors to adapt and adjust in different ways, and good survivors can do so. But too many survivors complain that having to adapt a certain way is unfun and therefore unfair.
---
When is the leaked Ghostface cosmetic dropping?
---
Should be coming soon if there‚Äôs windows x Stem
---
I actually really like the idea of her wiggly-arms being visible to Survivors, but if you can mindgame with it, does it solve the problem?
---
I guess in conjunction with something like removing phase collision.
---
Dont like him, ignore the post.
---
I can see how changing from low/mid tier killers to a mid/high tier one nakes a diference
---
I think the issue is their engine is 1 line of code away from needing therapy so they extremely restricted on what they can and cant make a killer
---
DWEET!
---
You forgot spirit.
---
That you can finally talk to a girl. 
---
(Jokes aside) 
---
Well at least you found your killer main.
---
Please do demogorgon next. I would love to add it as my wallpaper
---
I really like the 1973 Make Up and Blue suit dinner outfit as well
---
It can be funny but sometimes when you‚Äôre just not doing that well and they all decide to start teabagging you at the exit gates, it‚Äôs like rubbing salt in the wounds especially when they DS you at the door and then continue to all crowd around you to teabag you during the stun. It‚Äôs not necessarily the teabag it‚Äôs the mindset behind the teabag like ‚Äúhaha I got away, ggez trash baby killer.‚Äù
---
I get trolls exist and they want a rise out of you and that‚Äôs why they are teabagging but it doesn‚Äôt make them any less of an asshole. 
---
I love my slow teabag babies who do it to thank you or just communicate with you in general, or when you throw a dance party as ghostie.
---
Honestly? Bubba (he‚Äôs really hard for me) Myers, Pig (for perks) Clown because he screwed me over in a good game and never played him again, and Hag especially in the swamp because with the right add one you have to crouch everywhere oml
---
I can show u the the original image if u want lol that guy didn‚Äôt show the full pic in his thumbnail
---
Good ridance, no counter play to this perk at all
---
As a Killer, he'd be a massive disappointment.
---
-We have a Yamaoka with a katana already.
---
-Ours has superpowers.
---
-Rin's entire motivation is revenge against him; Entity recruiting him would sour the deal.
---
But as a SURVIVOR, he'd be hype.
---
-He'd be the first Survivor to be armed.
---
-Rin can finally have her vengeance.
---
-Most Survivors are fairly good people; not this one.
---
-Wouldn't interfere with us getting the Alchemist.
---
Oh sweetheart.. I hope you enjoy your time here, just hope you can get through the toxicity :(
---
1. Billy.
---
2. Huntress.
---
3. Demogorgon. 
---
4. Legion.
---
5. Wraith.
---
I would put Doctor on 5th if his constant heartbeat and screaming didn't give me a headache.
---
Sometimes spirit and billy het boring
---
The nightmare Please!!!!
---
Two sides of the same coin. I'm really into the black and white dinner suit attire.
---
Think I'd want something a biiiit stronger during my stay in infinite hellscape thank you very much.
---
Holy shit I can still earn serum even when the event ends?? Thank you so much for this information, here I was trying to grind out the last few vials lol
---
Get a controller. You just have to spin it in a circle to get out
---
Thank you!!
---
If you sell the spirit one on a canvas I‚Äôll buy it
---
In the Grudge, the first person Kayako killed was the husband who murdered her.
---
Yeah but we need ps4 x Xbox x pc
---
I have a controller. I‚Äôm talking about the 2nd hook struggle mechanic.
---
It's still more efficient to have them WILLINGLY help, though. The Entity isn't going to sit around torturing each individual dissenter for years if it doesn't have to, and the easy way to get Rin is just "Grab the guy you were going to anyway."
---
Lots of indie developers/studios turn a blind eye from fan created art being sold (on a small scale) - walk into any comic con or gaming convention's merch area. I mean, if you're just taking screenshots or printing sprites/models from the game files and claiming them as your own or publishing your own competing game it would probably raise a few legal eyebrows.  OP spending hours drawing posters for a few fellow fans only strengthens the fanatical base of the game. I'm not saying they shouldn't get permission (and I totally  respect them for feeling that way!) but I also don't think they should worry much if they don't.
---
"I'm in this post and I dont like it" 
---
Hella relatable though, me with wraith XD
---
Hi Rin, am dad.
---
 Jokes apart it's a really nice concept, they can work a lot of lore from an idea like this.
---
Thank you! And yes, he does.
---
no need to downvote me lmao. im just saying that shes fine with getting her likeness put into the game
---
I mean I suppose but it seems somewhat irrational to consider that luck.
---
Right?
---
Ah.  I thought Clementine was like, 12 or something, and I seem to recall BHVR specifically stating that all characters were 18+, for that specific reason, to not bring flak upon themselves for depicting violence against kiddos.  My mistake I suppose, carry on.
---
Because clueless people jumping on the retarded bandwagon some idiot youtuber got going. Anyone remember how "Billy OP" was a thing before it suddenly switched to "Spirit OP" when it was about the "second" place behind nurse?
---
1 Doctor
---
2 Billy
---
3 Legion
---
4 Wraith 
---
5 Freddy
---
I think it‚Äôs the alchemist, since he can go in and out each realm and take what he needs. He just wanted a sword.
---
Saying Ormond isn't tied to Legion is a pretty weak argument considering the tie to Jeff is that Frank hired him to paint a mural, which is on the top wall in Mt. Ormond Resort.  It is canonically the gangs hideout. As far as Stranger things, I'd agree that it is a pretty loose thread.   
---
But the odd's we would get a map just dropping without ties to a killer, especially a non licensed killer, are not likely.
---
Yeah I definitely like this idea. It would be really cool.
---
How I miss those days of playing my favorite character from any horror series and being able to use such a good perk. Now I just use him as my main perk whore. Ah, memories..
---
I mean, if you like, but all of the lore boils down to just "The Entity."
---
Why is Spirit a Killer? The Entity promised revenge, but also didn't have to and may canoncially recind it by making her dad a killer, too.
---
Why is Doctor, Nurse, Trapper or Wraith a Killer? The Entity made them do it, despite bothering to negotiate with Rin.
---
Why is anyone there? Entity; seemingly no coorelation to behaviour or personality for Survivors.
---
Why does the Entity keep Michael around when he keeps killing everyone himself? Somehow, The Entity.
---
Deliverance looks cool too, i've never used it but still.
---
Im a woman
---
yeah i always follow up with GG regardless of the game, so it feels in good sport to me lol. i think some people take it too personal when they shouldn‚Äôt.. it‚Äôs a game.. for fun!
---
Very true, I've always just viewed it as much more situational and therefore less useful to me.
---
Maybe her father is the survivor.
---
1. Freddy
---
2. GhostFace
---
3. Billy
---
4. Spirit
---
5. Clown
---
Spirit because of her being Spirit, Huntress because of hatchet hitboxes, Legion because boring mending killer, Hag because traps are everywhere and im constantly getting heart attack, Clown.
---
It's on the devs for making them viable when they are, then leaving them that way.
---
Sorry - I neglected your original question! I suspect that average is probably somewhere around 10 or 11. There are likely fewer players who play up at red ranks, and most casual players won't fall much below 15 even at rank reset. On a day like today, which is just a couple days before reset, the average is probably a bit higher. Maybe 8 - 9ish?
---
Change the button to right trigger, it‚Äôs so much easier
---
I didn't down vote you. You were simply stating that she was ok with her likeness being in the game there's no reason to down vote.
---
 Yes! So fun. So fast
---
Werewolf would be pretty cool
---
I came here to post this. 1000x true
---
Ehh Hillbilly and Leatherface exist together, i think it would be fine.
---
ok then they can deal with it not working? has DH ever worked 100% properly? its just worse rn bc servers.
---
I have this too, until I see the killer. Then it disappears completely for some mysterious reason
---
I swear her song is ingrained into my memory, and until I actually know for certain it's not her, I'll randomly start hearing her humming even when I haven't played against her recently
---
Choose:
---
A op as fuck
---
B Nerfed to the ground  
---
C Fine but you have to wait two years  during that time the perk/killer is going to be option a or b
---
I want it for my PlayStation logo!
---
Spirit became of her being Spirit, Huntress because of hatchets hitboxes, Legion because boring mending killer, Hag because traps are everywhere and im constantly getting heart attack, Clown.
---
I've tried it, and it's super hit and miss. If you dont get a rescue before getting hooked, its worthless. If you've been hooked already once, its worthless. It just requires specific circumstances for it to be useful and theres other perks that are useful like all the time so I dont see a point in running it unless you wana mix it up some
---
Maybe it's a new skin for Spirit which will be her father
---
I think it's generally accepted that if a killer strikes a hooked survivor or a survivor teabags consistently and/or at the exit gates, they're a shitty person. What's even sadder is that some of these (probably even most of them) are adults, albeit adults acting like whiny little 3rd grade bullies. In the end, they're the true losers.
---
How are you disabled for playing survivor?
---
Yeah, more inhuman killers!
---
Has no one considered the alchemist was a survivor and he may be improvising with any weapon he can get?
---
I can think of no more gratifying way to die than at Adiris' beautifully taloned hands.
---
Plague mains rise up
---
The beast is what I wanted forever.
---
Yeah thats true, it's too especific maybe.
---
If the power isn't called "Huff and Puff" Imma fuckin' lose my shit
---
It used to take significantly more bp to level a character. They already toned it down a whole lot since then.
---
I dont find Demo "frightening" I just think he's fun to go against. Scariest killer goes  to Michael. Literally the only killer to make me actually scream.
---
I mean, he was a teenager when he was doing those toxic YouTube videos. You can't blame the guy that much.
---
Somebody with built-in tracking would be great, and a werewolf would fit the bill with enhanced scent and/or blood tracking. I've had some stupid fun recently with Sloppy and Bloodhound on Myers, and each hunt feels inevitable.
---
1. Wraith - Absolutely unfun to play against. Almost nothing helps in the chase. ggez baby killer‚Äôs at the end of the game from toxic survivors that think they‚Äôre gods for being able to run wraith around.
---
2. Leatherface - Same problem as earlier but if you fuck up badly enough to get caught by this guy theres a good chance you‚Äôre not making it out and the rest of your game is sitting on a hook.
---
3. Plague - A gimmick killer who runs you around and throws up on you. Nuff said. She can get almost as gud as Huntress for a little bit but only if you‚Äôre dumb enough to cleanse.
---
4. Doctor - An annoying cunt with nothing that substantially helps him in chases.
---
5. Legion - Wasn‚Äôt fun before their ‚Äúrework‚Äù, absolutely gutted now and still pretty much as annoying. Mostly feel sorry for them.
---
I generally like going up against all the other killers though. Each has their own counterplay that is usually fun and engaging.
---
inb4 Spirit has no counterplay and is unfun:
---
No. You‚Äôre just bad.
---
Nah it says in her lore that her dad worked for some type of company and got fired for basically being a scapegoat for a product that wouldn‚Äôt sell. No way he was the teacher.
---
He‚Äôll be back just in time for the horrible Dedicated Servers, constant disconnects and horrible lag, only to get immediately burn out again.
---
I‚Äôm honestly glad he took a break. Ye Game has been a complete dice-roll since the Archives
---
Same with inner strengh that assholes
---
Downvoted bc truth
---
Ooh boo hoo I can't stop survivors from gen rushing I should pip anyways and the game is unfair
---
it's on Amazon prime video for free if u have that
---
Oh my God
---
Then he turns out to be a mid-low range killer and the memes about how the spirit is a better killer will haunt his memories until he regrets killing her
---
Survivors don't give kills, doesn't make sense to give hatch and lose a pip
---
If you're doing your best to intentionally piss and annoy other players, you're really just a loser. Games are supposed to be fun. Only a truly shitty idiot would try to take that core concept out and replace it with misery.
---
So I can't get them back?
---
This is fucking great!
---
Whats a good add-on that goes with Scratched mirror
---
Awesome as the previous ones, great job.
---
Please tell me the Billy one will be with Meg.
---
I think it wouldn‚Äôt be too tasteful since he raped/ sexually mutilated women in real life. Might have been a long time ago but he still has real victims. Not a big fan of any serial killer being added for the same reason to be honest. I get why people think it would be cool though.
---
This. The Entity can alter states/human forms slightly, maybe he‚Äôll just have a demon face
---
It is. A have a mix of protanopia and deuaranatrope and I can‚Äôt see tucking scratch marks. I‚Äôm genuinely surprised every game when I don‚Äôt see dance with me in the survivor perks
---
Thank youüñ§
---
Its just Mayers cosplay)
---
I made a concept for Jack The Ripper and got slammed for it my dude. I still think it‚Äôd be cool though
---
Pc would make it so more mechanics aren‚Äôt as adjusted for it. For example aiming in huntress and 360

You get destroyed by boosted survivors with "low" tier killers? Now I know why survivors are the way to go
---
If Spine Chill is lit up for a couple seconds, the killer is headed your way. 
---
Now, if you are in an open area, it is unlikely you can get away unnoticed,so you know you can run. If you are in a walled area, you have potential to hide. Sure, you don't know where the killer is coming from, but it is still better than Premonition.
---
Premonition gives off way more false positives than Spine Chill, and since it has a cooldown, you are vulnerable for 30 seconds. With Spine Chill, if you use the strategy I mentioned above, you know when the killer is headed towards you. However, with Premonition, the killer could be getting looped 36 meters away. You know where they are, but you don't know if they are coming towards you. Ever. With Spine Chill you can use situational awareness to pretty accurately guess where the killer is coming from, but with Premonition, unless you see the killer, you can't know if they are heading towards you. If you see them, then Premonition is useless anyway.

Awesome, thank you!!

Love it!!!!

The reason people do that its because the game doesnt have an ingame chat... Its a way for people to say "easy game" or something... You dont need to trashtalk about them for doing that. The real assholes are the ones that take a stupid rapid crouch too seriously.
---
i want a non licenced killer
---
You are right)
---
Yes
---
You just got bad RNG. Some times survivors can have a completely deadzone in the entire center area, leaving just a few pallets around the map with some LT walls which aren't the best option to hold a killer.
---
Consider: Finally being satisfied with a game even if you die
---
Freddy is so strong he does great with a majority of builds. Even Tinkerer instead of nurses. All great builds. I love Freddy.
---
Why teabag the killer, though? There are no good reasons for it besides intentionally trying to piss them off. It just tells everyone that at your core, you're a shitty person and an all-around loser.
---
NO I REFUSE
---
Maybe i will be art creator for BHVR in futureüòÇ
---
"just don't hit them lol"
---
Just had a game where I downed two survivors who instantly DC'd, when i was playing a no addon Wraith, who the hell DCs too a no addon Wraith?
---
Damn when are they just going to delete Wraith? /s
---
She does, isn't there a clip of her playing it somewhere?
---
If it‚Äôs an easy game take the win &amp; go, no reason to be a dick. Also that‚Äôs a straight up lie my dude, I‚Äôve seen people get teabagged on PC &amp; still get a message saying insulting things afterwards. They don‚Äôt need to trash talk/teabag because they‚Äôve won. No one likes being taunted, do you? Is it genuinely fun for you to consistently get groups of survivors who wait to taunt you?
---
Was it Otz? Cause he did that yesterday lol
---
Ty for you opinion,i appreciate thatüñ§
---
I got sent to downvoted hell because u saw a bill post and commented okay boomer
---
I see more people tunnel because someone landed DS than not tunnel because DS exists.
---
I admit i occasionally DC. But I will only do so when the killer decides to tunnel and camp me before even the 1st gen is done. I mean, I understand the strategy of camping towards the end on a match if only 2 survivors remain and the survivors have shown to be very altruistic etc.. but surely we all earn more points if catch, hook, release, chase, repeat play is used?
---
I don't see why i should wait around to die on a hook in the 1st 3 minutes because the killer is thick as fuck and doesn't like earning bloodpoints during matches.
---
I have never met anyone on here that has claimed they dc after getting downed. I play killer enough to constantly run into people who do it though. I think everyone probably tends to have some toxic traits when they play but it may not be all the time or something. It just doesnt add up.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs prob me.
---
üñ§
---
I wish it too btw
---
but that video is literally 2 years old. this image existed, nice try buddy;) dont do it again:)
---
I played a match as the plague earlier, someone cleansed in the first minute and everyone else dc‚Äôd
---
r/legaladvice
---
Tengu-masked samurai killer sounds like the best thing ever. That shit would be terrifying.
---
Hahah)
---
Dude I said I didn‚Äôt make the pic I only edited it I can post the original pic so u can see the difference
---
Is it really? Is the appropriate response to go for the save and get downed in one hit causing a scramble amongst the team? I dont get it
---
oof, honestly it would just be nice to have a single rework that does not either gut a killer, or make them ludicrously reliant on their addons to cover up their weakness, because like between nurse,Doc and Wraith its what it always seems to be, minor QOL changes to power that should have been a hotfix instead of being considered a 'rework',then if weaker, make a bunch of addons that compensate or cover up the very defined weaknesses the kit instead of fixing it, if stronger, nerf the power making addons that bring them somewhat up to how they were anyway.
---
Even Freddy has quite a bit of that, needing addons to at all be decent.
---
Dawwww,thank you üñ§
---
You could be a lesbian or bi? Lol
---
I use bubba in red ranks and get more 4ks with him then almost any other killer. I have no idea why i guess survivors are just not used to going against one that doesnt camp
---
I wish I was still level 99 :(
---
Thats 100% not the point of my post
---
BHVR aren‚Äôt going to do that though, hell they just released Nancy‚Äôs perk which encourages working together on gens and reworked prove thyself not too long ago.
---
Not all spirits are cream of the crop too. All spirits ive faced recently have either been genrushed into oblivion, or in one game they managed to get 2 hooks.
---
Man how are you getting taunted by this??? Why even bother??? You telling me you are on your pc, and getting angry by another guy miles away from you??? Just because he teabagged you??????? Imagine if he did that in real life man... Would you kill him???
---
1 Doctor 
---
2 Ghostface
---
3 Trapper 
---
4 legion 
---
5 Plague  
---
I know trapper seems like a weird one but there is just something about him. He always gets me.
---
Idk why but i cant draw spirit with angry face.All my works looks like she is kawaii girl from japan)
---
I want to be a tattoo master in future.THIS IS MY DREAM)
---
I liked the no ruin stream he did today. Proved you don‚Äôt need it with the right amount of pressure. Otz is just god tier at killer.
---
She is already killing for the Entity, so it doesnt matter either way.
---
I dont really care about the lore at all, but its entirely possible the entity is making her see the survivors as her father. If not, then she is under the impression that she will kill him eventually. 
---
Im pretty sure the devs have said the killers never cross paths, so it wouldnt matter if her father was also there since they would never see eachother.
---
You definitely have the skill for it these are amazing!
---
One time before gen 1 was even done, I got tunneled and moried
---
This is my favorite so far!!
---
Doesnt make much sense though. Dude was pretty vicious. As far as we know we dont have any bad hearted survivors.
---
I do the same thing. I won‚Äôt  give them the satisfaction
---
I mean she has counterplay but ok.
---
LOL WOW. I would never kill someone for crouching in real life and it‚Äôs hilarious that you would even jump to a conclusion like that because I‚Äôve stated it‚Äôs mildly annoying &amp; insulting to be teabagged at an exit gate (in a game) just like it would be to get face camped or tunneled or consistently get hit on the hook. Video games can be annoying and frustrating dude.
---
1) Hillbilly
---
2) Legion
---
3) Ghostface
---
The rest vary from fun to not fun, but I can tolerate them all. These 3 here are the ones where I would rather not play the game.
---
Which sucks because I enjoy watching him even without DBD. Still waiting for him to finish that Outlast play-through
---
I wasn't talking about quitting over the free stuff being a grind. I'd been given false info that at the end of the Blight event, we could no longer get the serum, and that is why I just didn't want to bother.
---
I'd love to see a killer whose power is a roulette of other killer's powers. That way neither the killers nor survivors know what they're up against.
---
Did they get rid of the killer offerings that let you try out killers you haven't bought? I remember they were a thing before but I only recently leveled a killer through 1-50 again without seeing any and I haven't bought the Demogorgon, Legion, or Plague and was hoping i'd see one of those offerings to try them out before deciding if I wanted any of them.
---
I dont make this works for money.I just want show what all dbd character have soul)
---
I know that now. I'd heard that when Tome 2 opened, serums would be removed from the Rift. I was misinformed. lol
---
Seems about right with how much this game caters to killers lmao.
---
O M G I want this so badly.
---
if u do a 1 minute chase u lose 3 gens pop and they already are starting on the last 2 gens
---
Have they had anyone who‚Äôs murdered someone be a survivor....?
---
Spirit is bad, it's a fact. She's bad for the state of the game.
---
I've been playing this game since early 2017.  It doesnt matter if it can or cant happen.  He wanted a fun discussion and you had to be a dick.
---
He's trash
---
To bad he wouldn't let me fix his internet like a month ago.
---
I agree.
---
No, but survivors do need backstories. And it would give Rin her vengeance
---
Pig honestly isn‚Äôt that bad lol. People are just bad at playing her. Watch Sciorpionz if you don‚Äôt believe me.
---
I have medium level Protanopia color blindness. Not game breaking, but it can be a struggle at times.
---
You better plug that god damn hard drive into the back of that console or I will lose my fucking mind. Love you
---
A survivor is crouching over to the gen to help me! It's Danny...
---
I think wraith still needs to be buffed
---
Just wouldn't sit right with me since he killed his own daughter
---
1. Spirit because she has almost no counterplay at all.
---
2. Trapper because he doesn't have to outplay me based on my looping in order to catch me.
---
3. Ghostface because his stalking mechanism is broken and you can't break him out a lot of the time because of how inconsistent it is.
---
4. Freddy because his lunge is too long or at least it feels that way.
---
5. Clown because he shuts down loops easily with his gas but honestly, this one is just me being picky.
---
&gt;!I'd probably derank a rank or 2!&lt;
---
I mean face your battles head on and play that killer you have no experience with.
---
&gt;!Which is probably demoralizing!&lt;
---
But I believe in you
---
&gt;!Help me, I'm a rank 7 Legion that just wants to learn how to play Trapper!&lt;
---
Go team!!!
---
You‚Äôre 100% right.. when I see a bubba I honestly am relieved.
---
im the one who killed jeffery epstien i shoved my dick in his throat and that killed him
---
camera: Medkits can‚Äôt save you from me, Claudette. Nothing can save you. My flash reveals your every move. Every hiding space you have is just a dead-end
---
Lol people complained so much you can no longer actually hit hooked survivors
---
Would‚Äôve been better with a ;)
---
Brings phone closer to face 
---
Ah, I see.
---
I spy would be unfun for survivor because he can see your exact location and then making nearly impossible to escape in my opinion. Power house is just sloppy butcher but slightly different. And tracker is just old predator.
---
Guardian? Eyes up Guardian! Say cheese!
---
every claudette ever
---
I mean it was pretty nice having an invincible human shield.
---
Go to select your flair, but edit it before confirming the change.
---
You know there's an issue when the optimal playstyle of a killer is to facecamp, because he sucks at everything else
---
If that works is it legit 300IQ
---
Um. First of all, that's a crazy idea. Awesome, but crazy. Second, how do you fail to see that that would be ridiculously overpowered?
---
Hey, that's fine by me, I did the same way with the commission I had done
---
This is spectacular and groovy, I especially love the pig. As an artist I‚Äôll take inspiration from this post and love it forever
---
Love it! But I feel like some people won‚Äôt get this cause no one taught them chess lol
---
Damn you‚Äôre gunna get downvoted to oblivion. SWFs reee whenever someone threatens their godmode and even suggests the game shouldnt be a 95/5 matchup in their favor.
---
Then why does he usually put it on all the time so that "3 gens don't pop in two minutes"? I think he needs to decide which narrative to push.
---
Iron will has definitely increased is use recently. I can see why; it lessens the burden of being injured and is especially helpful in solo queue when teammates can‚Äôt/don‚Äôt heal you.
---
If it makes you feel better I got 179/180 on seconds I need to chase people with Trapper
---
(Insert "Why did you eat my fries" song here)
---
Who's ready for the Fun World Classic Ghost Face skin on Wednesday?
---
Says in Spirits lore ‚Äúher father started hearing a dark whisper (presumed entity) in his sleep‚Äù and later on says ‚Äúthe darkness whispered, promising blood and revenge.‚Äù  Makes more sense to be a killer, and it wouldn‚Äôt make sense why a survivor would be a killer in the real world
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth
---
honestly idc I just strive for this game to be a bit more balanced. it's not super far from it but i feel swf really hits it hard more than anything does
---
I feep stupid for not knowing what pip means...
---
I mean, legion is just annoying. Tedious, really. Their power isn‚Äôt ever strong and if you know how to play against her she‚Äôs nothing more than a pest. Legion is just... boring.
---
If i was to switch Nurses id go for Surveillance, better to keep gens from having progress rather than getting a notification when its about to pop
---
imagine tbagging the spirit with her own murderous father lmaoo
---
If that comment of mine means I'm a dick, you never met someone who really is in your life
---
Again...the theme here is how durable Freddy is. Surveillance is great too.
---
.............but free bloodpoints while the Legion runs away to get another stab.
---
Whatever you say, crybaby.
---
Its how you rank up, you can depip/safety pip/pip up or double pip
---
Thats Casper!
---
Maybe it could be a toned down version, like instead of billy's power instadowning  it could just injure.
---
I love it how the devs are doing what they can to make the game less toxic. What are we gonna do now that we can't BM people that are on hook?
---
Agreed, this would be so much more fluid, considering the ridiculously long queue times
---
I think what the devs should do is to lessen the gen requirements when someone dc
---
Agreed. He's still better than Bubba in my opinion. If he is used right, he can make use od his stealth, while Bubba is an M1 killer most of the time. Often, it's determined by the map or the survivor's positioning. If you're playing on, for example, the Crotus Prenn Asylum, if you just run into the asylum, it's basically impossible for Bubba to land a chainsaw, making him am M1 killer and even then, since he doesn't have traps or hatchets or anything, with how powerful the asylum is, he's gonna have to rely on bloodlust.
---
How exactly is getting another killer's power, which is already in the game, for a set amount of time, and maybe with an added randomization factor, overpowered?
---
All the more power to good killers who will be favored by the odds and who manage to find strong combinations.
---
Or like u/daddydeath1 said, since he is mimicking other killers but isn't as proficient as them, it might be weaker versions of their powers
---
They managed to turn an obese, alcoholic man in his 60's into an Olympic sprinter, so it must be doable for them lol
---
It's honestly shocking that not many people mention him.
---
Hybrid Panda mentions him in his shrine watches at least once every 1-2 months
---
13th, according to the leaks: https://i.redd.it/z3ary0p52qx31.png
---
personally anyone immersed as claudette/blendette just bugs me but you do you!
---
Can you post these online?
---
I run all killers but the ones who get hurt the most are doctor, wraith, clown, legion. these 4 i run different builds but i always run pop and ruin on all of then except wraith which i run corrupt the other 2 perks i use depend on the killer. the problem isn't the chases but more of gen speed with these groups i can 2 hook 3 of the 4 people and 1 hook 1 guy but a lot of the time gen speed just trumps all progress i do even if i do get loads of 20 to 40 second chases the gens still fly even with ruin up my average games last 6 to 8 mins at the most
---
lol it looks like hes scared of the cat
---
What do you mean?
---
When you see a Nea with a skin different from default, you know that you're going to get mad
---
Because it's fun to see a game where the game lasts for 4min and you got just few hooks. Yep.. totally fun
---
Try to reach rank 1 with killer now that you played easy mode (survivor). As survivor I can rely on them all the time, one of the reasons why I play it more than killer. Try to rely only on yourself now and see the difference
---
Was your 4th perk urban evasion?
---
1.) Spirit (nuff said)
---
2.) Clown
---
3.) Freddy (Blood spam is so annoying)
---
4.) Hag (proxy camp + bodyblock bullshit is so annoying)
---
5.) Legion cuz Legion
---
Fun fact: there hasn't actually ever been a new map released without ties to a killer.
---
I mean murder is murder.... sounds like he listened to what the entity was telling him too.  And Rin only killed because she did it to survive, and plague didn‚Äôt kill anyone.  It‚Äôs unrealistic to me that they‚Äôd have someone who willingly murdered as a survivor.  Normally those people are well, the killers
---
Nah, not new. Been playing for over a year. I just know how to be a decent human being. Trolls like this are the equivalent of dogshit.
---
Finally
---
Actual conversation (he was talking about when they were trying to finish the last generator)
---
salt boy: you never left the area with the generators
---
me (Freddy): ...to go where
---
salt boy: to chase! God you‚Äôre so bad the only way you got any kills is by gen camping 
---
me: lol
---
salt boy: trash player never play again
---
me: well what does that say about you?
---
salt boy: what
---
me: I killed you so if I‚Äôm trash what are you
---
salt boy: 
---
salt boy: you only won by gen camping
---
Yo i dont Care Nice edit man new background yay, dont mind the salty babys
---
Who's hybrid panda? (I don't know many dbd youtubers/streamers except for bryce, ohm, otz and a few others I can't think of rn)
---
I feel like Ghostface is fine as he is. The only thing that I hate about him is how incosistant his reveal is. Half the time you can't even reveal him, the other half you'll reveal him a second after he got to cover. And sometimes it's balanced. Much like the Huntress, the killer is balanced, but bugs (inconsistant hitboxes for Huntress) kinda ruin that.
---
If using a mouse bind your scroll wheel to spacebar. Even better if you have those scrollwheels that will let you flick it and it keeps spinning.
---
I hate these kind of people. Play dirty and when you Tunnel because they play dirty they say you play dirty. Yeah, next I‚Äôm going to open the exit gates for you...
---
The entity feeds off emotions, having somoene getting what they deserve will probably be tasty to it
---
He's a popular DBD streamer that was mentioned if a few of NoOb3's videos.
---
&gt;!Please tell me you at least know No0b3!&lt;
---
yes
---
As a rank 19 noob a few weeks ago, I got matched against a rank 4 killer and jeez it did not go well
---
Where tf did you find this picture?
---
Lol but its all so one sided, you'll never see them do anything about the teabagging, Swf using comms &amp; objects of obsession, DS users bodyblocking when you're trying to down somebody else, Bodyblocking in general, trolling endgame collapse till the very last second, spamming the rushed action notification when the killer isnt going for their aggro, Disconnecting with the soul purpose of deranking thenmselves &amp; killer
---
Shit I don‚Äôt mind d/cing when the killer starts lagging
---
So Funny!
---
Apparently some sounds were leaked that were labeled as "tomb"
---
Maybe it *is* Mr Yamaoka, and he draws you closer to death
---
Can't be a loser if you're a teabagging winner, have you played Halo btw?
---
And i aint disagreeing with you, its why i gravitate to his playstyle cause it produces results
---
I have hit rank 1 killer several times...
---
Sorry, but its really not that hard assuming youre grinding pips instead of "fun."
---
Doctor actually requires a lot of fore thought if you want to play him right, some doctors will just hold put their shock therapy and won‚Äôt be able to stop loops. While smart doctors would bring it out at the right time, to prevent loops or stop gens.
---
The rift ends in 57 days.
---
The event progression isn't actually tied to the rift, but earning the special cosmetics are. You can earn putrid serum throughout the end of the rift, and spend it on the cosmetics up to 2 weeks after the rift ends.
---
Tbh I think that was me lol I use both rn because I‚Äôm buying a new survivor soon and I haven‚Äôt gotten many good perks for Meg
---
Yes, that is why hard-tunnelling at least the first survivor out of a match is a very effective strategy: it is a lot easier to control, build pressure, snowball and outright win the game off of many situations as soon as there are only 3 survivors left in the match. Either way, my point is only that "balance" is considered 2 sacrifices and 2 escapes, and the global as well as rank-specific statistics show that all killer characters average more than 2 sacrifices. The game is statistically imbalanced in killer favour.
---
I know that at its core, given equally-skilled and experienced players on both sides, the game is survivor-favoured (though the extend to which obviously does depend on killer character, add-ons, items, offerings, map, with some configurations yielding a pretty equal and even killer-favoured playing field), but in public matches, it is awfully rare to actually have 4 good survivor players in a lobby. Which means that a good killer player will only awfully rarely lose. And there's countless hours of video evidence of as much. I've gotten tired of watching good players play killer because all they almost always do is win without really being challenged. An SWF composed of 4 actually good survivor players actually playing hard to win will also almost always win and only rarely really be challenged, due to most killer players not being very good, but BHVR can't reasonably balance for either scenario, because it would tilt the game way too much in either side's favour for general, global gameplay. They kind of have to balance for the global playerbase, though ideally with a leaning toward red rank gameplay. Or they change the ranking system to be a lot less forgiving than it currently is and then go for a rank-specific balancing approach.
---
As a by the way, for tournament DbD, the core game imabalance is actually not a problem at all, since the tournament format or ruling can easily be adjusted to accomodate. If for example the format dictates that both teams have to play the same killer, it doesn't matter that the killer is weak, since the competitive comparison lies not simply in killer against survivor performance, but in killer A performance vs. killer B performance; if team A's killer gets 3 hooks in a game and team B's killer 4, both killers most likely lost their respective games, and quite decisively so, but team B's killer still performed better than team A's. The competitive premise is simply changed and it is perfectly balanced.
---
Excuse my rambling about tangential concerns here, that pertain a larger "balance" argument. I definitely agree that Spirit shouldn't need major changes and should largely play the same way she does now, only with more actual mindgames, and that Billy should be left alone. I think BHVR did say they want to look at the chainsaw killers' add-ons, but I doubt it will be "nerfs", more-so "reimagining" them.
---
They did do something about object of obsession
---
I found a love for distortion and I knew I‚Äôd be using Inner Strength the moment I saw it. In this game I was replacing my usual adrenaline with pebble
---
Spaghetti code : wait that's illegal
---
I want Pretty Woman Leatherface
---
No they both laid on top of each other and span around making it RNG on who I picked up
---
Hope he doesn‚Äôt just complain like he does on Twitter
---
Wow, you're so talented! I would totally buy something like this.
---
Keep the good work!
---
It would still be like this if they tunneled ... there would Be and X amount of time after u were unhooked for the killer to start chasing u (tunnel u) and within that time if they chased u ur DS would activate and u would have 1 min just like it is now
---
Well, there's nothing else to do other than jumping into a match lol. Don't worry too much, everyone at ranks 20-17 are pretty terrible.
---
If you make any mistakes, the community is pretty helpful and won't hesitate to let you know what you did wrong.
---
When you first click on killer or survivor, the first block at the top lets you choose who you want to play. Survivors are basically just skins with no single one being different from another (height and noises vary slightly, but that's largely irrelevant). However, the third box, which should have a red exclamation point takes you to the "bloodweb" which is where you unlock items, offerings, and perks for your survivors. Items, like toolboxes and medkits, make your character perform slightly faster. Offerings mainly give you bonus bloodpoints for certain objectives during a match. Perks are what truly define your character. Each character starts off with their personal 3 perks at tier 1. Through the bloodweb, you can unlock basic perks available to everyone, but when you get characters to a high enough level, you can unlock their personal perks for all the other characters.
---
The second box lets you equip your character with the items, offerings, and perks you have bought before each match.
---
Finally, the fourth box lets you customize your characters appearance.
---
Also, a brand new feature to DBD is the Archives which includes two sections: The Tomes and The Rift.
---
Each tome focuses on a particular survivor and killer and is filled with many challenged you choose and complete during matches. Finishing these gives game lore, bloodpoints, and rift points.
---
The rift includes two tracks, a free and a paid, that gives you cosmetics and other goodies for collecting rift points. 
---
TL;DR: Go to the archives, select a survivor challenge, go to the survivor tab, pick a character to play, dump some bloodpoints into their bloodweb (third box down, red exlamation mark) go to the second tab to equip them with items, offerings, and perks. Go to the fourth box to customize their looks. Then ready up to play a game!
---
Playing stealthy is a waste of time. And yeah, I ran spine chill for about a year. Then I realized it wasn‚Äôt helping me anymore.
---
Spirit - Absolute cancer right now. Just constantly facing them all running the exact same shitty build. If I get them back to back with the same build I just kill myself for any other game.
---
Doctor - Almost always pick the game map with perks designed to piss people off. Fun for the killer not for anyone else.
---
Legion - He's so boring and weak. I wish they'd rework and buff him.
---
Bubba - None of my teammates ever seem to force him to M1. Also generally nods at you like he's a pro for a chainsaw down.
---
Huntress - hatchet flies through my head, no problem. Hatch hits where my foot was 5 seconds ago and I take a hit.
---
I've seen that too. They make me scream out before I can drop the pallet and they get the hit. The way I see people play them is they will just shock all around and wait to hear screams so they can find people easy. When I first started playing killer my biggest issue was finding player even when I knew they were around a gen. Doctor seems like a decent way for a new player to be able to locate survivors without doing much other than using his ability. At the same time if you can loop you can shut those doctors down pretty easy. My issue personally is I usually can get away but I will miss those skill checks or get found trying to get rid of madness. I'm always really worried about jumping into lockers when he is close because I dont want to be heard and I dont always want to run quick and quiet just in case I run into a doctor.
---
it's pretty obvious they have it if they play like that
---
Makes sense to me. Who took the sword though?
---
For the record this guy knows his shit\^

So if this were trapper u would have a problem ? üòÇ my problem isn‚Äôt with DS I use DS on ever survivor build I use .. my problem is I didn‚Äôt tunnel but I still lost bp for them using DS in this way ..
---
If Quentin's getting a face rework, maybe they'll get around to everybody. They've been adjusting their hairs and it's coming along nicely so obviously they care how the survivors look.
---
Pretty good job so far
---
Welcome to dbd where the hitboxes are more like figure eights and the matchmaking is painful.
---
Legions mechanic is not fun. You spend all game mending and can't hide from frenzy. Its crap. Some idiot said the killer doesnt have to be fun for survivors. W...T...F are you smoking? If killers aren't fun to play against nobody plays survivor and the game dies. If survivors are OP and always win killers stop playing, the game dies. The game overall should be as close to balanced and fun for both sides. Legion is cancer for survivors.
---
There is no other game mode but "ranked". And rank is stupid, so just go ahead and play. You will start at Rank 20 and can't derank until rank reset or after rank 15.
---
Pretty much what the title says, this is a charm I haven't seen before, and doesn't seem to be in the Rift. Anyone know what this is?
---
Poor man's got a kill at least lmao
---
You guys make no sense yeah I was using spirit so it doesn‚Äôt hurt me that bad .. but this stupid shit doesn‚Äôt just happen to spirit is happens to trappers , pigs, and clowns  that‚Äôs where this would‚Äôve really hurt
---
oh yeah, what‚Äôs the deal with getting that map with myers?
---
AND you DC'd, remember?
---
We live in a  society
---
Just play the game. Don‚Äôt care about the rank
---
Yeah
---
yes in a previous post i named this possible killer the Omnity, for omni + entity. i always do Random Select when i play fighting games, so i would like a killer who is also like a random select, or Edge Master's mimic style in Soulcalibur, to be a different style every round, or, in this case, likely on a timer, where the killer changes who they are every minute or so. there would be simplifications, such as that traps are only there when youre the trapper/hag, and disapear when u change into someone else
---
It‚Äôs a fog whisperer charm
---
I havent seen this? When I hit someone on the hook it does the normal blood splatter.
---
Like where? They‚Äôre on imgur currently.
---
I mean after you got DS'd
---
Thanks!
---
Wait are you being serious
---
Proooooobably next
---
You still got a hook and you got rid of ds
---
When you finally beat the lunatic cultist in expert mode... wait, wrong sub...
---
Body blocking isn't toxic. I agree with the rest of those things being toxic, but body blocking is to help a teammate. It's usually only done when said teammate is on dead hook.
---
1. Spirit 
---
2. Freddy
---
3. Hag
---
4. Ghostface 
---
5. Hillbilly
---
This is because it‚Äôs the killers ‚Äúrealm‚Äù that‚Äôs where they live when they aren‚Äôt in a trial. I think survivors are always by the campfire.
---
But what about his shadow? Would it just a shadow with a camera stabbing you to death?
---
This was me before I found my man ghost face
---
What I love to run on doctor is either stbfl or pwyf, these reasons why, 
---
stbfl; doctor is a major m1 killer that can‚Äôt usually shut down loops but the moment you hit a survivor you‚Äôre losing a lot of distance, but with stbfl survivors can make a mistake or have a scream animation stop them from dropping a pallet or vaulting something. With that 0.8 seconds scratched off my attack cooldown I can do a lot more. 
---
Pwyf; Shock therapy doesn‚Äôt take up any stacks as it is not harmful to the survivors, and doctor while in shock therapy is reduced to 110% speed, but with three stacks of pwyf you go up to 125% in treatment mode and 130% in punishment mode, I can easily shock a survivor and catch up quickly to smack them. No one expects it, and I can find the obsession easily based on their scream.
---
He's gonna be the next killer people complain about after spirit gets nerfed
---
Decisive Strike 2.0
---
You have a katana. The killer does not.
---
When the killer tries to pick you up, show them the superior strength of Japanese steel that has been folded 400 times and cut them in half. The killer is [moried and removed from the game/is moried and has their killer reset to level 1/is moried and has their account deleted and game uninstalled].
---
When did they say that? If you are talking about the gif I don‚Äôt think they actually did say it that was a theory if it correct
---
YO THIS SHIT IS HOT ID BUY THIS!!!
---
I'm bagging long and hard if I escaped vs a face camper
---
Just make the add ons determine its abilities
---
The good ole first days of dbd üò¢ wish I could go back, nothing compares to the feeling of ur first few escapes. hope u have fun and I‚Äôd be willing to teach you about the game but probably not in a public match cause I don‚Äôt want to put you through red ranks, I‚Äôll add you. (Btw don‚Äôt know why my font changed)
---
Tunnel whenever you feel like it, Camp whenever you feel like it. You don't owe anyone a fair game and you don't have to adhere to the fictional "Survivor's rules for Killers" these kids made up, so play the game the way YOU want to play it.
---
The third sword is missing. If you go to the Yaminoka Estate map, in game, only one sword remains.
---
Do what you want when the killer is being toxic but I‚Äôve seen too many people who don‚Äôt do anything toxic in games and still get teabagged and insulted.
---
These are gorgeous, I'd love a tshirt with them for sure.
---
Ya those guys r just brain dead fools. I cringe when I'm playing killer and people do that
---
I mean it be pretty tough to see a tiny set of stairs behind a hook chuckles hook animation is him quickly climbing the stairs to pick up an hang the survivor. Just holding the body while stepping up on the steps
---
Snares or pallets? I‚Äôm loving Brutal Strength and fake pallets if I want a laid back game. Snares if I‚Äôm really working for the 4K. Seems like a higher skill cap and higher reward.
---
?
---
Don‚Äôt ask who joe is
---
Lol did u watch the clip ?? I didn‚Äôt know since he came back full health within 1 min and he laid right on another survivor?? I was just supposed to slug 2 people bc one came back with in 60 second ?? And if anything my idea would be to buff it .. if u get chased with I‚Äôm 30 sec of being unhooked than DS activates for the 60sec but if u don‚Äôt get chased than it never activates making it a actually anti tunnel perk Instead of this bullshit
---
You don't lose bp if you get ds'd?!?
---
Not true red rank here and they tend to struggle in the higher ranks against a sold team granted any killer does but it ain‚Äôt normally never lose
---
I M M O R T A L I T Y  S E V E R E D
---
I still wouldn't skip it, depending on how much you play certain perks you should definitely go for, some perks like Hex: the third seal for hag I'd skip but something that you may use like quick and quiet are impossible to pass up, only straight up garbage perks should you skip
---
Right now I'm tossing up between Curtain Call and Shattered Bloodline. I have no interest in playing Clown, but I want Pop and Kate has some really cute outfits. But then Spirit seems really fun to play and I'd love to have Haunted Grounds. I'm honestly real torn between the two.

I just made mine in photoshop, you can set it by right clicking and changing the icon. If you want this one I can definitely post the png

Waste of time.. ok
---
My favorite thing about maining Clauddy is that killers never expect anything from me. Being constantly underestimated is great
---
Sure. That would be nice. It makes a good alternative to instant safety.
---
Down votes to the left
---
Maybe even end the game  since she‚Äôs fixated on her father?
---
Ohhh yes please could you post it TY!
---
Alright, take a chill pill next time. Maybe even more than one
---
It's a tossup between him and Radio Demon for me...IF I WANTED TO HARM ANYONE HERE, I WOULD HAVE ALREADY DONE SO
---
Bro tbh he better than modern day rappers
---
Unfortunate timing, I edited my comment at the same time you posted yours. Stealth gameplay is usually a bad idea in this game though, it just leads to time not spent being productive. But you should check my edit, I approached this with a little too much vehemence earlier
---
The Spirit üò≠ it's too much!
---
Holy fuck, I‚Äôm not reading all of this but I‚Äôm going to assume you know what you‚Äôre talking about good job! 
---
But damn that‚Äôs a long ass paragraph lol
---
Existed.
---
How. Fucking. Dare you.
---
I only play Myers. Myers is only killer. Ghostface is baby Michael. So Ghostface can exist sometimes.
---
I'd rather have him as survivor. The satisfaction to kill him as spirit would be unimaginable
---
No one tell Jund about this.
---
Are you killer or survivor main
---
How about on pc? Dont see the option tonbuy with them?
---
Exactly, there's so many countries with rich cultures, fokelore and potential killers to come from that, let alone still existing movie tropes.
---
If they give up to chance at them to make ANOTHER weeb killer I'll be pretty pissed.
---
Sure he had the power to DC, but it just made his time in the match a complete waste. I'm complaining because I just can't fathom a reason for the DC on 3rd hook. Just die and move on at that point. It must be some 200 IQ play that I just can't understand or something
---
Killers are allowed to grant mercy at their own discretion. The others got salty that they died and you didn‚Äôt, but you did nothing wrong
---
Actually, it‚Äôs their first 5 times against that killer
---
Tbh, The Camera wouldve been a better name for GF than The Ghost Face
---
You can scare people with any killer if you play a certain way, but playing those ways almost certainly means losing hard for most killers.
---
The game was made to play pretty much the least scariest way possible.
---
What?
---
Premonition is shit.
---
it might be bugged &amp; occur randomly but for the most part its been out of the game for half a year
---
Rin just suffer from pain(
---
Was literally gonna comment about this
---
There is nothing more infuriating than hearing the chase music in the corn field and not seeing a survivor, not because they are hiding, but because *THIS FUCKING CORN IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THROUGH*.
---
I'm so relieved I'm not the only one struggling. Two gold and two iridescent with the 4K isn't enough for the bronze trophy, yet I can walk my scrub ass out the gates as a survivor without any points whatsoever.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll take any help I can get. I‚Äôve been interested since the game launched so I know some things but have been caught up with other games
---
This image, which details some leaks, seems to indicate that the ST DLC will be on sale at the end of November. I don't think there's been any official confirmation yet, so take it for what it's worth.

I‚Äôve made a group chat where if you need help I could give
---
This is so fucking cool I love all the subtleties and the composition! 
---
How did you get the old worn papery effect? Did you use a photoshop overlay?
---
Can you get the "Where did they go!?" achievement as the killer?
---
PC in NA
---
There isn‚Äôt much of the point, you‚Äôre right. But 94% of the dbd community are nothing but piss babies.
---
what happened? newer player, sorry.
---
Yep, no one else reads books.
---
Awesome job!!
---
Hmmm this is where it depends on what back story we give the entity in this. For exampleif the relationship between Chucky and the entity originates from when Charles says the verse that summons damballa ‚Äúthe Entity in this world‚Äù to transfer him to the doll. This could open up his ability to be storyline based or unique. My favorite ability concept would be when playing as chuck is when you spawn into the world there are roughly 5-7 dolls scattered around the map like the trappers traps. Chuckle can pick the dolls up an ‚Äòdrag‚Äô them where he chooses once he drags it to an area that satisfies him. When a survivor enters the area he would get a trigger like the hag. Now he can teleport to the doll that was triggered but he has to be in close proximity thing Half of the distance for the hag but the verse he says is the same time as hag and the dolls teleport option doesn‚Äôt disappear until the survivor leaves a range of the doll or destroys it. Destroyed traps would respawn after x amount of seconds. Due to height impairment he could be portrayed bigger or have larger terror radius an or speed reduction.
---
That's a bit odd, I'm on ps4 and get into lobbies as killer very fast. Isnt PC usually faster on queue times?
---
What's a book?
---
I wouldn't know, it was my first 2 attempts
---
I fucking love it! Its also how I feel when Im ten seconds into the game as killer lmao, ruin b gone.
---
I‚Äôve been hit through walls against a clown pretty sure some hit boxes are broken rn
---
I only know how to use phone
---
Pallets exclusively, theres no greater joy than slamming a survivor camping one of my fake pallets and then they run to the adjacent pallet thinking "surely this has to be the real one" only to get cucked again. i love builds that exploit their crutches
---
Well, that'd jank out the mechanics and probably be a lot of extra programming, but it'd be neat if they could put in a bit of code where Mr. Yamaoka has a 99% base chance of being Spirit's Obsession, or has the Obsession tag even if there are no perks that would create one in the match.
---
When is the last time you have seen anyone run daja vu? no one at red ranks is going to waste a perk slot on that. 
---
Also good luck breaking a doc out of a 3 gen when not playing swf with good teamates. even if you break the 3 gen, its still super annoying to go through no matter what.
---
It gotta be painful to be forced to play the same game over and over ,
---
Well, Bloodhound has the blood duration, so that's something, but Predator is pretty trash. Really, my point is just that some teachables are absolute garbage, if they are few.
---
Dead trees, mashed up and pressed together, with ink on them. Some people like to look at them and hallucinate.
---
I don't, really. I've met braindead players like you before, don't worry bubsicle :)
---
I can just take some LSD for that
---
Predator is only good for spirit and bloodhound and sloppy butcher is great for anyone
---
Maybe we can get more diverse body types? Jane, Jeff, Kate and David are good but what about Claudette, Feng, Nea, Dwight and Jake
---
What if the Killer's Spirit? She does have a katana.
---
Its the event, making queue times a tad long as a lot of people are playing killer rn
---
Yeah until they have back to back leaks like they did earlier this year.
---
As an avid comic geek myself, including Heavy Metal and Savage Sword of Conan, I approve this.
---
Also strikes a very Tales From The Crypt / Creepshow vibe.
---
Well done.
---
Zubat is that you?
---
Definitely survivor. I really enjoy killer but I play survivor way more.
---
Is this a sexual thing?
---
I like it
---
Puppers stares off in the distance....
---
Sounds like the DbD equivalent of TF2 Randomizer.
---
Actually, a Random Killer/Random Perks button would be fun, but would need a BP or XP bonus for using it.
---
Well...good. They've also added like 50 perks, so that was a good idea.
---
Naw it was like a normal hit but didnt effect hook progress at all,
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if the killer is doing it on purpose, it‚Äôs the survivors job to pay attention to where gens are getting done. It‚Äôs not the killers job to help them escape.
---
I always thought this would be an awesome concept, a survivor versus a version of themselves that's been corrupted into a killer by the entity.
---
Honestly they should start stripping points for hanging around inside the gate after the gate countdown has started. Want to stick around and be an asshole, then it'll cost you. Make it exponential every time they do it so each match becomes more costly to the point that their go negative bp.
---
I especially like the "No bandages" bit. Very pulp.
---
What are you talking about? ¬´Strong feeling¬ª cause i just said you're a worthless loser ?
---
You're nothing, for me and for the rest of the world, so who should i take it seriously?

You're nothing dude, calm down
---
bubba (face camps)
---
spirit (no counterplay)
---
clown (bottle spam)
---
huntress (broken ass hitboxes)
---
legion (absolute cunt)
---
no order
---
Nobody at red ranks is running a 3 gen doc either...
---
1. Hillbilly
---
2. Plague
---
3. Spirit
---
As unlikely as it is, wouldn't it be cool if the new killer had the demon mask and wore samurai armor? That would be badaas in my opinon, as the closest thing we have to "ancient" is plague.
---
Can't wait for this to be posted for the 4th time.
---
He wearing The One Ring.
---
"Resurrection"
---
Does this mean a certain somebody was able to bring peace to the Spirit and now the entity is going to yoink the dad and use her in its games to compensate.
---
It would be really cool to see a samurai themed killer and his wife be the new survivor, now spirits will feel extra guilty about camping them on hooks
---
Yee yee
---
Dis a gud meme
---
Sorry to be so toxic defending teabagging don't worry bro I'll change my ways and never teabag again. Thanks for saving me from being a teabagging loser right before I escape.

I‚Äôm so impressed by the 180 he did. From insufferable prick bastard to my top 3 favorite content creators in a short amount of time.
---
Hit your greats
---
1. Doesn't matter what you start out saying if your final point is somehow blaming the killer.
---
2. Just because you don't want to use the tools to counter the strategy doesn't mean the tools aren't there. It's still the survivor's fault.
---
3. And you should be perma-banned for DCing. Such a damned baby that you would ruin the game for others because you can't stand a challenge?
---
    Even though I agree the Spirit needs adjusting and nerfing, the fact that you admit to DCing against every Spirit and purposely ruining the game for others means you're just an asshole and your opinion is irrelevant. Wish BHVR would start banning all of y'all.
---
Don't DC and don't repost, please and thank you
---
Mine is Pop Goes the Weasel. If i don't have it, i just feel lame every time i kick a gen
---
I remember prestiging was kinda a big deal cause it took sooo long to get to 50.
---
People say you rely on ruin but it gets destroyed really quick so your not relying on it. Ruin is more to stop the first gen they all spawn at.
---
That definitely should have at least been a black pip if nothing else
---
Doesn't sound like you did anything wrong, so you're fine. I'm not even sure the report button does anything other than make people think the devs give a shit
---
The walls? I need more help
---
Damn, rolling Bubba's power would be disappointing.
---
Some People don‚Äôt want to play killer cause if they lose then its all there fault. if they lose as a surv then they can blame it his team.
---
Raped by a camera
---
He could become an actual demon that represents the mask.
---
Cool story but where is the screenshot of your emblems? Even better if you took a look at the breakdown.
---
No she isn‚Äôt her addons are
---
It seems like shes willing though usually in cases like this it would probaly be pretty expensive due to how big of an actor she is. Quintens actor is relatively unknown, Jamie Lee Curtis is a celebrity with over 2 million followers.
---
I'm far from an expert on this though usually it's a lot more complicated for more well known celebrities.
---
I had the same thought about Pinhead yesterday.  wonder if devs have ever considered.
---
I'm hyped keep up the good work! üêªüôèüòç
---
theres a lot of factors that go into points and emblems, you just listing off things doesnt give enough info. did you get hit during chases? downed? safe hooks? co op gens?
---
Incorrect. Baba Yaga is a story of a Russian hermit that kidnapped children and was viewed as a witch. She was said to have animalistic features too. Ding ding ding. See the connections?
---
Spirt uses the katana

the "missing" thing is the katana. they changed the map, before, the katana, (3rd sword) used to be there, now it's gone, that's what's missing.  [proof](https://twitter.com/leakbydaylight/status/1194032581945315328?s=21)
---
This sub is 4to1 surv to killer. Anything that doesn't benefit survivors in an argument gets ignored or downvoted
---
The ONLY reason they want spirit nerfed is because they already got the nurse
---
After spirit will be billy "lOwEr hIs rUnNinG sPeEd" 
---
Then clown "NerF hIs bOtTlE cOunT" 
---
*but a "anti tunnel" perk that lasts longer than it takes to do an entire gen is perfectly fine and totally "anti tunnel"*
---
How so? If they weren‚Äôt stuck there, survivors would hypothetically use them to fight back. Ash didn‚Äôt come with his shotgun and chainsaw because of this. Same with Steve and his bat. No weapons for survivors.

Ochido harassed his (underage, female) fans for nudes.

People play as Freddy and it is confirmed the 2011 movie this incarnation is based on molested children.

He was pretty fucked before the Entity though, a better example is someone like Plague or Legion.
---
Is it bad that i created a subreddit for this majestic lad?
---
I have never noticed this.
---
Has anybody been getting this map more often recently? I don‚Äôt know. Ever since around when they posted the tweet I feel like I keep getting Yamoka estate
---
Am I dumb? How tf is this relevant?
---
I don't get why you would dc at that point. Whatever you were hoping to do, it didn't work - take your points and move on. DC'ing just tells everyone you're a bad loser and a total crybaby, not to mention also a bad player.
---
Pinhead next OR WE RIOT!
---
unless I'm mistaken, this is the same move.
---
The issue was where he is currently living, his internet just sucks complete dick and after contacting his ISP many times, having people come in to test his connection, etc. They supposedly keep finding that his internet is fine and nothing should be wrong to be causing his internet to just randomly cut out, get choppy, etc. He was talking about moving for months now and that he basically had no internet until that move.
---
Huntress needed a mom, and vommy mommy agreed.
---
Funny. In my opinion the game caters to both sides. Also bold of you to assume I‚Äôm even a killer main when I actually play both sides pretty equally and still think teabagging is a dick thing to do when you‚Äôre playing against fair killers.
---
Whoever owns the character owns the likeness -- in its entirety. Actors don't own their personal likeness at all, in fact. The entire concept of likeness is all about created property. They couldn't charge a dime on top of the IP owner's licensing fee if they wanted to.
---
Now, whether they'd let you scan their face directly versus you working off pictures is another issue.
---
Tbh, I usually just do work/chores around the house until I get a game. My room is clean and my work is always done thanks to those queues...

don't the files say something about the power being like snapped or something? like rins dad, it'd make since since he went mad and killed him family

"Sensitive" I just simply put dont respect toxicity and idk why you are so adamant about defending this guy for his actions that you know were disrespectful.

1. Complain about the OP killer. (Nurse)

2. OP Killer gets nerfed. (Nurse)
---
3. Complain about the next OP killer. (Spirit)
---
4. Next OP Killer gets nerfed. [We are here]
---
5. Complain about the Next NEXT OP Killer. (Plague, Ghost Face, etc...)
---
Repeat until all killers are given a small squeaky toy, have 65 movespeed, no lunge, can't kick generators, and can't move from a 5'x5' square in the corner of the map.
---
At a certain point people are gonna complain that Trapper is too good at controlling windows or that it's unfair that they can't see the Wraith approaching them.

I would 99% say it's vigo cuz from the original hallowed blight event those videos were released along with the vigo's apprentice cosmetics for Dwight and Claudette respectively, with the flower cum on their clothing.

---
Well, first off the Plague is an okay killer but can lose easily against really good survivors, she doesn't effect the meta a whole lot but two of her perks do. These two perks are Corrupt Intervention and Infectious Fright. 
---
Corrupt Intervention is basically a discount Ruin, at the start of the game it blocks of the 3 gens within the closest proximity of each other for 120 seconds, this makes it so that not only survivors can't work on these gens but it makes it so that you have less area to patrol, very good perk and I'd definitely recommend picking it up. 
---
Infectious Fright is an amazing perk as well, whenever you down a survivor and if there's other survivors in your terror radius, those survivors will scream and reveal their locations to you, this makes it so that you can leave the downed survivor and go after another survivor to make a ton of pressure especially when used on killers like Nurse or Hillbilly who can very easily down survivors, it also works great combined with Monitor and Abuse (I'm looking at you Myers **:D**).
---
As for her third perk, Dark Devotion, what this perk does is it gives you an obsession and when you hit your obsession, your obsession has a 32 meter terror radius and you have no terror radius for 30 seconds. It can okay in the right situation, but if it's not the right situation, then it's not very useful.
---
Next Ghostface. In his PTB, Ghostface was honestly the new worst killer in the game, but then he would receive a major buff and become one of the more stronger killers in the game **:D**. He has one really good perk, one decent perk, and one perks that's absolute garbage.

His really good perk is called Thrilling Tremors and what this perk does is when you pick up a survivor, all gens not being worked on are blocked by the entity and highlighted to you in white for 16 seconds. Now, on paper this could just sound like old Surveillance 2.0, but if you think about it, this actually gives you A TON of information on where the survivors are and which gen they're doing as the gens being worked on by survivors are not highlighted in white to you, meaning you now know where and which gen to go to. Works great combined with Pop Goes the Weasel and BBQ + Chili.
---
His Decent Perk is called I'm All Ears, and this makes it so that when a survivor fast vaults a window in your terror radius, you see their aura for 6 seconds. This in my opinion can be pretty good for when you're in a chase so that you now don't have to guess which direction a survivor is going to go and instead now automatically know where they're going to and what their next move will be. Works pretty okay and I'd say it's worth giving it a try.
---
Finally, his horrible perk is called Furtive Chase and what this perk does is it gives you an obsession and every time you hook your obsession you gain a token that goes up to 4 token and each token decreases your terror radius by a couple meters while in a chase. This could've been a solid perk if it decreased your terror radius at any time, but unfortunately it's only in a chase which is the absolute wrong time to sneak up on a survivor. Sadly this is a really sucky perk and I wouldn't recommend running it.
---
Final killer we have, is the Demogorgon. I'd say he's one of the most balanced killers that we've gotten in quite a while and I would definitely put him up there with all the other high tier killers. Despite Demogorgon being a pretty strong killer, he is now the second killer to have some pretty awful teachable perks next to Huntress.
---
His first perk is called Surge, this perk is at most just kind of okay, what it does is when you down a survivor, all gens in your terror radius that have work done on them explode and regress 18% faster than normal. This sounds good on paper but from my personal experiences with it, this only works when there are no survivors working on it when you down a survivor, and so far I'd say it's a 45%/100% chance that there won't be a survivor working on it. Plus, unlike Infectious Fright, it only works when you do a basic M1 attack. This perk is just okay, but completely outclassed by other game slowage perks.
---
His second perk is called Mindbreaker, this is a god-awful perk and honestly one of the worst in the game to me, what this does is whenever a survivor is working on a gen with less than 50% progression on it, they suffer from the Exhausted status effect and when they get up from the gen or the gen goes past 50% progression, they are Exhausted for 3 seconds. Literally all this perk does is less than 50% of the time, maybe even less than 25% of the time counter Sprint Burst, and since any survivor that doesn't play Meg runs other all the other Exhaustion perks, Mindbreaker does basically nothing and is the old Surveillance 2.0.
---
His final perk is called Cruel Limits, another poopy perk that could've been better if it was looked into more, what this perk does is whenever a gen is completed, all windows within 24 meters of the completed gen are blocked by the entity for 20 seconds. Honestly, the only time this perk is ever useful is if you're playing as Leatherface on Lery's Memorial Institute. The 24 meters is just too short of a range to be useful and the 20 seconds is just too short of a time to be useful, survivors can easily just run to another area away from the blocked off windows (which btw is most of the time is only 2 windows, smh) and not worry about getting bamboozled by this perk (again, unless you're playing as Leatherface and you're just a few meters away from the gen that got completed.
---
So basically, Plague is decent and has two really good perks, Ghostface is very good and has one really good perk and one pretty good perk, and Demogorgon is pretty solid but has all trash perks. Hope you enjoy these new chapters **:D**.

I actually look up to this guy and his content. I've recently made a YouTube channel in hope to be a dead by daylight youtuber he honestly inspired me
---
You wont think he's anywhere near op at rank 1
---
Enjoy it while it lasts, but i do have to warn you, on the 13th we're having a rank reset and everyone will be around your ranks*.* I would wait about a week after the reset happens.
---
lmao
---
Shameful.

Aaand here comes the playtime argument, which has almost no bearing on your skill in the game! Even if they did have low play time, that would mean you have low play time as well. 2000 IQ move my dude.
---
link me i wanna support you
---
Although I agree with you, "the survivors" don't get to choose, the survivors who randomly get to finish gens do, and only if the killer is being dealt with.
---
I find that the vast majority of players will work on any gen they find, and not keep track of anything, even in red ranks. 3 genning isn't exactly common, but that's more about getting away from the area and the killer than it is about players working together strategically.
---
It's one of the reasons I'd love a better ranking system in this game. There are clear differences between players even at red ranks and even at rank 1.
---
great job!
---
Theres alot of pictures in Lampkin and most are just some sort of blob paintings but that might be the first legit painting i've seen

What about a good nurse vs good spirit?
---
And you turn around to find ghostface has walked right past you without either of you noticing
---
Hex: You're Fucked
---
My fianc√© and I do this and it's the best!
---
I'd have to disagree with you, ruin is literally the best slowdown perk in the game, its instantly active the match starts, which is great because that's when the killer has the least amount of pressure. Killers have a severe lack of early game perks it's really annoying actually. The only competition for ruin is corrupt intervention but thats on a timer and doesnt effect every gen, it relocates survivors, doesnt slow them down too much.
---
Before this I went against a rank 20 and a few in purple. Is it just console that does this or is this normal? I understand SWF but Jesus fuck what‚Äôs the point of ranking is it‚Äôs like grabbing ranks from a hat?
---
i don't read because then i'd resent the game if it pulled me from a good part
---
mostly i reply to emails or look around the subreddit with the occasional twitter shitpost thrown in
---
I like enduring and or spirit fury since ghost face does a lot of chasing. Play with your food can also help, but only if you're gonna play super stalky. 
---
Sloppy butcher and nurses calling are really good as well. Best add-ons are typically recharge time ones, for me at least
---
Making an M1 killer have 110% movement speed is the easiest way to make them unplayable
---
Well yeah, 90% of front line staff are bots.
---
There is a chance that his place is just fucked, it happens and i've seen it. There is also a chance its as simple as a different modem (not the newest and greatest the company thinks is best because spoiler alert its trash).
---
They switched his modem a few times, he‚Äôs probably just in a shitty spot
---
Why would you cripple yourself though
---
Tombstone so when you reach tier 3 you can mori survivors.
---
Idk man your negativity is really affecting me more right now. Come to think of it, i've never got anything but entertainment out of his videos, whilst all of your comments thus far have only served to make me lose hope in the human race. Imagine thinking you're some special little snowflake for going against the community and farming downvotes. Couldn't be me.
---
No my apologies for not being more specific. On the 13th of every month, everyone‚Äôs rank ‚Äúresets.‚Äù The reset is based upon what rank you achieved (killer and survivor are separate) the previous month. So in a couple days you‚Äôll be having a lot quicker queue times as there will be more people in brown and yellow ranks to fill lobbies faster.
---
Willing to bet any amount of money they switched it like for like. Not a different model.
---
Add "DbD subreddit to the list
---
&gt;* **If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank.**
---
Killer vs Killer (or 2 killer vs 8 survivors) when?
---
unfortunately ‚Äúsuffering from success‚Äù can be an issue when your whole team genrushes. sucks but yeah :(
---
Could get buffs from chests, or steal items from survivors?
---
Okay i changed my mind. You seem alright lol
---
I think people are smart enough to connect the dots
---
How can I successfuly unhook myself? I've seen people doing it all the time, but all that happens to me is that the entity apears faster and I have to mash the X button (PS4 player here) like crazy.
---
Jesus that guys an idiot. 
---
I love the whole your homophobic part. God that was a good laugh.
---
ok foot
---
This is pretty common
---
Imagine Rin having to spend her tortured afterlife knowing her father was that close, but never being able to kill him.  
---
Sounds like some bullshit the Entity would pull.
---
That's what made it funny.
---
dude youre like the MVP of this subreddit. i‚Äôd give you gold on every comment if i was rich. thanks for helping cut down on the spam posts
---
Context: Survivor (yellow) was attempting jukes like window techs, 360's, etc. After he used dead hard, I had a hunch he was running decisive strike. I forgot that killers aren't allowed to play around DS.
---
im sorry is that a milky glass with a broken glass?
---
Its a luck thing. There are a few perks in the game that give you a greater chance of doing it but its very rare and as a result of trying it speeds up the entity if you fail. Its really best reserved for dire situations most of the time its best to be patient.
---
Thank you for posting that I genuinely didn‚Äôt know. Always wondered why sometimes it seemed spot on, other times similar to OP.
---
There was a HOLE here. 
---
It's still fucking here
---
Exactly! Needed to be said, but wtf do u mean homer isn't canon, me and him have connections to the entity.
---
Deserved, lol
---
"Most killers rely on ruin"
---
"Its not important tho"

Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
---

---
Reward bloodpoints for every second remaining on the final countdown timer. It wont 100% solve the problem but it could help.
---
Prob so it stops ppl being toxic
---
Yeah when i realized that the hole was there, i was like "wouldn't it be funny if he fell for this" and then just, plunk.
---
I just hit red ranks sooo maybe that's why lol.
---
Just need to fix his buggy reveal/stalk. He's broken from both perspectives and it's random.
---
Where is the Petition to change it to this
---
Some people are retards. 
---
Jeez, I also get pretty salty when survivors escape with an ass pulled keys or use BT and DS in the end because I wasn't able to proc DS earlier, but the worst I said was that they didn't put any effort into victory. Talking about homophobia and all that kind of stuff because you lost in a videogame is lame
---
They‚Äôre hissing at each other
---

It's basically entity sweat.
---
This is just so cool! I could look through them all day. I like how the locker represents Dwight.
---
The only reason not to run ruin is if you're being a contrarian, you are using corrupt intervention, and/or you're using devour hope.
---
He has been missed dearly!

I'm used to OW where we get a new character every 4 months so the fact that DbD comes out with so many new playables is wild to me
---
Yea dude cause he was ‚Äúunfun to play against‚Äù said the survivor mains but dont get me wrong he was a bit too strong to begin with so a small nerf would have made sense but they gutted him
---
As a ghostface main I can say that is some quality art
---
Now I can only see the woman yelling at the cat meme

The original blight lore was about the alchemist discovering Vigo's journals and following them, so the alchemist himself isn't Vigo, he's Vigo's 'apprentice'.
---
&gt;So those facing 3 ppl 2 ranks above you isn't broken from here on out Im disregarding everything you're gonna say.
---
Like I said in my other comment, matchmaking can go 6 ranks above or below yours and still be considered normal (this isn't even considering SWF).

Omg, imagine the sleeping bag killer as his mori

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv5n2d/forced_hook_suicide_bug_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I think it has something to do with the new updates this never used to happen and now I get games with rank 20s and it seems random.
---
&gt;next canceling your power effectively locks you in place for 42 seconds
---
Only 42 seconds for a power that does practically nothing?
---
hmm...
---
Still not punishing enough, increase it to 80 seconds.
---
I'm in the same boat. I get looped for what feels like forever. If I try to switch targets, I still get looped for quite a while. I've been hovering around Rank 8-9, and fighting red ranks is no fun.
---
My wait times are pretty quick also. Less than 1 minute during peak times, and less than 5 minutes when there's not many people playing.
---
As cool as it seems, that feels like such a cop out killer. Like they couldn‚Äôt think of any new power so the devs are just like ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just give this dude ALL the killer powers and call it a day‚Äù
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs not true. At least I‚Äôve only seen it once with every killer that has come out in the past year
---
Thanks for pointing out the typo, will fix it.
---
I assume you get clowned on.
---
According to that data, Trapper has a kill rate above 60%, putting him in the top three killers. That alone shows that the data doesn't tell a lot about overall balance.
---
See, I did play spirit to find a counter. I didn‚Äôt find one. I saw survivors juke me occasionally, but half the time it was clearly an accident and they never did it twice. But even if we disregard the strength she still needs changed. She doesn‚Äôt need a rework because of how strong she is, nurse is still stronger and I think nurse is fine. Spirit needs a rework because she‚Äôs not fun for the majority of players. I don‚Äôt care if people try to claim it‚Äôs a minority, if 2 or more people in almost every spirit match is disconnecting then clearly HALF of the people in that match hate playing against her enough to leave. And it really is a consistent 2 or more dc as spirit, because she isn‚Äôt fun. It often feels like you‚Äôre not even playing because you never know what they‚Äôre doing, and you can‚Äôt capitalize on any mistakes because you don‚Äôt see them.
---
Borrowed time, self-care or afrenaline i can guess
---
I‚Äôm all for it, I love debating the merits of spirit.
---
If he is a survivor, he'll have to have  be going through a hell of a redemption arc. To be fair though, it was the entity manipulating him that drove him mad, he'd probably come to his senses pretty quickly after it dumped him for his daughter.
---
I just started playing killer and so many survivors have been sacrificed bc of this. Do they not know what no ed is
---
I had a ghostface scare the shit out of me an hour ago. 
---
Scrolling down to see this haunted me for a moment
---
The game is fine without either of those.
---
I see.
---
If there was ever a Netflix series on DBD this would be the twist you knew was coming but completely surprised on who it was.
---
It would be some sneaky twisted version of Jake or something
---
Ok
---
You gotta remember that it's easy for twitch streamers to get stalkers. You could understand why he'd be overly careful when someone from his ISP specifically reaches out to him because they know him.
---
No you can‚Äôt they just vomit over the walls

This is so important and finally shows people how severe the difference is. Thank you.

what does that have to do with anything? n00b just sucks. he's a soggy sandwich.
---
Well that made fail NNN
---
who?
---
What if survivors get boldness bloodpoints when the killer is near them on a hook? I know that killers get punished as gens get finished and other survivors can escape, but at least give the hooked survivor some compensation.
---
Probably should have mentioned I took a year off from the game (last October to this October) because of school. So I may have missed the theories, sorry! Thanks for reading!

Making every killers powers be completely optional due to 115% movement speed is a great way to -Not- Balance the game. I swear the Reddit portion of the community are useless in this regard. Probably due to the anonymity, They can go be preferences alone and downvote anything that goes against it.

Let's be honest, orange and white are the only winners here.

Entity: I enjoy all the sacrifices and all, but you‚Äôre feeding me too fast. Chill.
---
Probably a rework
---
Hawkins has some really great pallets, though, and by great I mean unsafe so that you actually have to use your brain to play them well. Even as a survivor I'd prefer that over running the same overpowered jungle gyms over and over again.
---
my god. I was the real victim all along

Get some stalling perks and information perks for now

Just run Deja Vu to stop 3-gens.

Just run Comraderie and Kindred to counter camping.

Just run balanced Landing and adrenaline if you are getting chased all game.

Just run iron will and Spine Chill to counter Spirit.

Just run Unbreakable and Tenacity to counter slugging.

Just run Urban Evasion to counter Hag.

I can't fucking run 10 perks at the same time. But please, tell me more about how I should run a useless perk to counter a 1 in 200 chance game where a doctor from the start of a trial, sits on three gens.

Good point. Some of these streamers/YouTubers I do wonder how that don't get burnt out playing what 3-8hrs a day of the same game. 
---
TrU god bless him is someone who I think would do well with a break, like I dunno it's a fun game but I couldn't commit to playing massive hrs of this game every day.
---
you just describes a killer setting up a 3 gen not survivors accidentally doing it. you didnt make anything different by adding this

THANK YOU. If I chase ONE of you then you pop the gen and you all get out. You must think I‚Äôm booboo the fool if you think I‚Äôm going to chase your ass to a dead area of the map.

The fuck? This sub is pretty much 50/50 and it‚Äôs hilarious seeing some people say this sub is killer sided and some people saying it‚Äôs survivor sided. 
---
The ONLY reason people want spirit slightly reworked is because she‚Äôs stupid and an unfun killer. I‚Äôve never seen anyone calling for Billy‚Äôs movement speed to be lowered and where have you seen anyone calling for less bottles for clown?
---
A gen takes 80 seconds to do so imagine still complaining about ds
---
Individually they are:
---
Ëµ∑ (rise) + Ê≠ª (death) + Âõû (return) + Áîü (birth, life)
---
You criticize something not because you hate it, but because you love it.
---
First of all, the mentality to change or nerf something to appease the majority is dumb in a PVP game of any type imo. If in any game something get nerfed to help the majority, which are casual most likely, it just will make a never ending cycle of abusing strong shit to cater to bad players in high ranks. So be in high rank just means how much time you spent not how skilled you are, which is exactly how it is now. I cannot even think to have this mentality in any other PVP game, where DC get punished regardless
---
Anyway the only change I would make is make her shards be more visible, especially for skins. I agree on that, her skins gives an unfair advantage and her shards should be visible regardless, even a sound would be fine to me, like an unique glass sound when she start phasing. That's about it
---
Idk where you play, but here in EU in high ranks I've seen many people juke me pretty well, even with decent headphones and pin pointing where they were they knew how I would've react and used it against me. While others just give up due to lack of adaptability they have, which is a shame..
---
Her biggest weakness is her eyes, she's blind like a nurse, and like a nurse which you play differently against her, you have to do the same for her. You won't loop a nurse would you? Ofc not! Same for spirit, you will make her guess where you are, even making noise on purpose to fuck her up. Her hearing too isn't as sharp, is easy to hear a grunting noise but due to her power's sound she can't hear your steps and barely hear your breathing if very close.
---
You can fake a vault, run in a straight line forcing her to use her power to catch up and start to mess with her since she has no way to understand where you are except for scratch marks and if there's some high grass which are not everywhere. So you can slow vault something when you notice she's phasing then fast vault on the other way. You can drop a pallet so she'll think you're on the other side, use lithe and dance with me how I'm used to run and totally lose her while she phase and so on
---
The point isn't really to win a 1v1 but waste as much time as you can. In eu games lasts for 5-7min max and 1min chase means 3 gens will be popped and she has to make 12 hooks in total. Sometimes you get potatoes on your team, I play solo and I can see that, but that's a emblem system problem not a killer problem that's too easy to rank up.
---
I usually can run a spirit for 1min, sometimes less due to a fuck up or a bad read, but that happens to any killer to me. Especially because I'm not great at chases, I'm quite average at best but decent at stealth. She just need a little input when she phase, that's it, not a big one, as I said even an unique sound like a glass breaking would be fine and make her glow be visible in all skins
---
Prayer beads, welp, I don't care about it tbh, you can do whatever with that add on. I barely use it myself since by using distressing you have the same results. she has a lot of downsides the problem is sometimes you might forget how she'll react to things. Whenever I'm against a spirit I try to guess what I'll do in her place and most of the time I'm right thanks to the time spent playing her myself.
---
How do you get it?
---
"cunts

Ah return. I‚Äôve seen Ëµ∑„ÄÄin Ëµ∑„Åç„Çã, Ê≠ª in Ê≠ª„Å¨, and Áîü in ÂÖàÁîü
---
Well back before her rework, hag kinda *was* low tier. That movement speed was abysmal.
---
...they were the last three though. If they‚Äôre close enough together (which they were) ANY gen patrolling is going to look like ‚Äúcamping‚Äù

may god rest your soul
---
‚ÄúWait no‚Äù
---
When you wanna hit that prestige 2
---
Jesus Christ that is one paranoid build. That spirit must have spicy armpits 24/7
---
And what's worse, is that they invented EGC because survivors would wait HOURS at the exit gates for the killer to chase them out. It was absolutely insane.
---
you mentioning Otz made me look up gameplay of his and his Myers build is outstanding, thanks so much cause I really think I'll be running monitor, surge, and pop now
---
Well he barely makes videos now, and literally every tweet about DBD he makes is some sort of complaint, I love how people seem to assume I‚Äôm just wanting to cause issues because I critique a YouTuber, as if nobody can think badly of him and that anyone that does is a troll. 
---
People like monto and panda have nice audiences as they are positive for the game 
---
While noob has created the most toxic, sheep like followers that will take anything he says as gospel.
---
The only problem I have with Freddy is that he can spam snares at loops with no CD, no movement slowdown or penalty to himself while being a 115% killer.
---
Both hag and trapper have to place traps down before they enter a chase and if they want to place a trap, they are forced to stop chase, and stare at the ground for a few seconds.  Survivors have to go around and disarm them outside of chases, so if they‚Äôre in an area with traps while chase, sucks to be them.
---
But with Freddy, survivors don‚Äôt have any option to disarm Freddy‚Äôs snares with how quick and easily he can put them down. He can keep his 10 snares with him, and spam the absolute fuck out of a safeish loop to make it unsafe with no penalty or real counter. Dropping the pallet as soon as you get to it and moving on to another pallet isn‚Äôt a counter.
---
But shouldn't work for both and I'm a survivor main. And the fact he face camped you means he lost points if someone is face camped in my game at all I'll leave them for dead because I see it as a sacrifice for the good.
---
i'm so glad they nerfed that perk it was basically just "get a second chance for doing nothing". people say it's been completely destroyed but honestly i have friends who still use it and while you do have to work for it (body blocking for people in a chase) it's not impossible to get off
---
You cannot because there are none.
---
I think that's the risk you take when playing with limited communication or solo, I have games when I get camped on the hook and its my first hook.
---
But it's okay, because the people I play with know how to work around that.
---
I'm not saying its easy because it is fustrating but you just need to learn, adapt and overcome. :)
---
Shit ping, Or the person made it on my list for being toxic or rude or both.
---
God he's either memeing or a really shitty and annoying person.
---
How did you reach out to him?
---
Tru is obviously burnt out. He complains more than ever and seems bitter. I loved having tru on in the background, and the only time you really see that side of him is when there‚Äôs a new Mortal Kombat
---
Oh man. Love it when they get this angry for their own mistakes.
---
Thank you!
---
i don't have her on pc, but i remember picking up hag the first time on ps4 like "dang i was made for this"
---
And usually the ISP provided modems are the shittiest quality possible to maximize profits for them.
---
yes if survivors give it to you that is one thing but forcing it is another. the same thing with camping hooks if survivors are over altruistic you stay if not then that is bad camping
---
Is Feng your SWF?
---
A. If you didn't read the image he has been moving and dealing with internet troubles.
---
 Bit of a big thing.
---
 And please, point out where I called you a troll, I'll wait.
---
 His audience is fine, and I'd bet just the same as the other two given people usually watch all of them.
---
He is the worst DBD streamer out there. Constant excuses, complaining, ‚Äústream sniping‚Äù, etc.
---
Ooooh so *THAT* is the reason StrangerThings is now in DbD!!!
---
He got a report because I love the DBD community and I hate to see players like these. :)
---
Lol so he can complain about hitboxes more? Yay
---
I get this alot as someone who mains the trapper
---
If he face camped you he also depipped. You're gonna have bad games. That doesn't mean it's unbalanced, especially with your proposed fix
---
I'm sorry? I didn't even intended to say it in a negative way, why you gotta do me like that
---
Welcome to EU region
---
No, after the match I asked her if she was swf with them and she said no too. They 20's immediately died, leaving only us two the whole match.
---
Keys. No reason to take a game that's going to be half as long. I also don't run moris outside of dailies so I think it's fair.
---
Hey though, You said splinters stop spawning if you get the dlc but I'm still getting pig and freddy splinters and I own them both.
---
This will get taken down for names and because of salty after game chat. 
---
But I do love reading the stupidity of people!
---
I don't see anything wrong with His imagine, it's just a typical DbD lobby
---
To quote u/arver48 quoting Loomis: "I SHOT HIM SIX TIMES!"
---
First game I played tonight was on it against a spirit. I knelt down in front of the altar hoping she would spare me for showing my respects, she didn't.
---
Are you on console? Do you own the actual DLC or did you buy the killer with cells? I know if you own the killer with cells the splinters still show up, and I have heard conflicting reports they can still spawn on console even with the DLC.
---
The game is 4 to 1 it would be crazy to think a 4 to 1 game would have a 50/50 community. I'll be generous and say 70%/40%
---
I haven't seen so much spirit hate either until the nurse was hit with the nerf hammer. Spirit has been like this since she was officially released yet just now she has somehow became so broken and OP we need a new meme about it every 5 minutes? Sure m8 sure
---
And yeah gens take 80 seconds *without any skill checks* which literally never happens. If a gen takes you more than a minute you are either gen tapping or have the worlds worst skill check RNG
---
Depends on the killer. 
---
Ways to interpret it:
---
- Ooh they're giving me a free hit before they leave, nice.
---
- Ugh why don't they just leave? They've already won, no need to rub it in. They just want me to see them leave.
---
- They just want extra chase points before they finish the trial, it has nothing to do with giving me a free hit, and they're not trying to BM me.
---
Keep in mind I'm using the Chinese meanings which should be the same as Japanese for the most part (though there are definitely differences).
---
The fuck is your issue? God forbid someone takes a break right?
---
Isn‚Äôt she Japanese?
---
The more I think about it, the more I'm starting to think it's a nerf but in the last patch they made all stealth killer undetectable. So now myers is undetectable in teir 1. However, now hes able to be spotted with spine chill so I'm not so sure if it's a buff anymore lol
---
Do I count as a shitty person if I play killer and strike a hooked survivor after I hook them to not hear them scream hella loudly
---
What, cos he's a killer? And how is that worse than almost all of the killer cast? How is it worse than Huntress starving many young girls?
---
Stay away.
---
Youtuber who cheated, has been banned twice, and who's whole gimmick is being toxic, but he's self aware so its magically ok, and overuses the word cutie and cunt.
---
I gotta agree with you. The other guys idea may seem fun but sometimes you just don't want to go through all the trouble
---
I actually picked up the hobby of building and painting models. (Warhammer 40k)
---
It‚Äôs a nice idea but pretty op. And the second perk is almost exactly like ghostfaces so it would have to be replaced
---
Then why'd you reply to my post? I'm asking about people who do lobby dodge.
---
Weird i couldve sworn that your comment was close to the most downvoted in this thread. I'll go look again. 
---
Huh. Nothings changed. 
---
Yeah definitely not going against the community. Nah, there was never an option for you to see a thread you didn't like and scroll past. I think your definition of "whiny twat" needs a bit of a rework, seeing as from my point of view here, you're being a "whiny twat" for coming on a noob3 celebration post and being a massive buzzkill.
---
The King pointed out that if you go to the spirits map the Katana is missing.. thoughts?
---
Its a swf with the 3 so actually its working as intended
---
Because it's about lobby dodging and some people don't do that.
---
DAMN you bad!
---
When I‚Äôm survivor, I only dodge if the killer‚Äôs ping is like... 24 hour McDonald‚Äôs wifi levels of bad.
---
I‚Äôve only dodged a lobby once as Killer and it was due to an annoying sfw that bm‚Äôd me the entire match and then yelled about reporting me in the chat. It was annoying so I just took a break after that.
---
&gt;Its a swf with the 3 so actually its working as intended
---
People struggle to read the devs notes and think this isn't normal matchmaking.
---
Yeah but people act like he was fuckin dead.
---
Plus not everyone on reddit gives a shit
---
True
---
I only lobby dodge if I somehow get put with rank 20-16. Other than that I try to stick with it
---
He quite literally is a jason knock off. He only has traps to fit the gimmick. Man in mask with machete. You dont think it's odd that the only mask he doesnt have is a legit hockymask? Almost as if that's lawsuit territory?
---
Before DBD by some miracle because successful they would make their own knock off versions
---
Trapper is jason, Billy was leatherface and hell even legion was supposed to a ghostface. Seeing as they only got rights to the mask shows they never thought the licensing deal would go through so pumped out legion
---
Why'd you reply? I'm asking for people who do lobby dodge and their reasoning. If you aren't one of those, keep scrolling
---
Yeah this is normal. They are a 4 man swf so it goes based off the highest rank player.
---
I'm asking for the reasons people do it. Not the reasons they don't.
---
Why are we supposed to hate him?
---
Seems pretty reasonable
---
Yes but the meanings of the Chinese characters are generally similar if not the same but not always. That particular 4 character phrase is derived from Chinese though so it's both Chinese and Japanese.
---
there are several ways to add more players without risking to mix console and PC DBD could easily become free and monetize themselves of DLC and the new battle pass and the shit ton of skins
---
I think people who DC should be forced to play the next game without perks AND get a least 1 pip in it. Disconnecting while having no perk games doubles the amount of no perks&amp;items&amp;addons&amp;offerings games.
---
What I just did is make a new steam account. It seems like things you buy directly with $$$ is unlocked. That means buying auric cells and unlocking something will leave it locked.
---
You'd think it's unfair, but I still get looped forever although not as often. I also started doing other killers, so it's like learning them with less stress. Not even getting 4K with the games. I don't even know how I reached rank 8.
---
Yeah. Keys are just cheap. If I can spot them in lobby, you know I'm going to dodge that real hard.
---
Huntress has weird lore. She has the mental stability of an eight year old with PTSD. She simply kept them alive not knowing anything better. Rin's father is just a piece of shit who went psycho and killed two innocent family members.
---
I hold no like grudge to Rin's father cause 1: He s fictional, and 2: He's fictional. But compared to all the other killers, he is the only one who has done real harm to others on purpose. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Yeah. No reason to waste your time on players that'll most likely get you killed.
---
Oh no problem! But just in regards to said book, I was just wondering what the name of it happened to be just because coincidentally I've got so many annoying birds living around my premises and I wouldn't mind thinning them out a touch.
---
Because they are from they're own universe. It's like a filler episode for them you know what I mean ?
---
See it like that: Saying that they are canon in the DbD universe is like saying that Scorpions, Sub Zero or Raiden are canon in the Injustice universe, or that the Terminator is canon in the Mortal Kombat universe. They are guest characters that are here gore the players only and that's about it.
---
Seems pretty reasonable.
---
You asked when people lobby dodge. I replied I don't. It's a valid answer.
---
Try not to get your manties in a twist, it's just the internet.
---
I do hope the next killer is not licensed by anyone and is a DBD original. I know some people want to be able to buy killers with shards and have some new and original designs and not people we‚Äôve seen before

Honestly just say gg and leave before they say anything, your always going to be playing ‚Äúwrong‚Äù one way or another.
---
Cause He is the antagonist in spirits storyline. But I would hate him more for cursing dbd with the spirit meta, than actually killing Rin.
---
Is someone fr going through this thread gilding hate comments?? Yikessss
---
Alright.
---
 Alright, but again. *Moving* is a big thing, that takes a lot of work since you can't just pack up your stuff and go somewhere else.
---
 Ehh, I think that's just you. He seems to have a good amount of fun with it.
---
Seems pretty reasonable. Franklins Denise is a good perk to have.
---
i think that would also work really well with Amanda(before saw) as a survivor and Amanda(as the pig).But i guess we already got tapp, so that ain't happening  :/
---
Through his discord mods.
---
I'm on console and I only bought the killers on most of the dlcs with cells.
---
Loved that play.
---
100% and it is important to be careful. I provided his discord mods with Photo ID from the ISP
---
As if there was a time when this game wasn‚Äôt a joke
---
At the moment it's about 6AM\~ in Europe where I'm playing and there are over 12k people playing on steam alone ( keep in mind that there is also crossplay with Microsoft store ) . That is a decently sized player base, and the reason games take so long to find is the servers being utter shit rather than the difficulty of finding players to fill the lobbies up. Suspending people for  a brief time  like 15 mins (the usual time of a match ), would make people think twice about disconnecting since they won't be able to jump back in to another for the duration of a whole match anyways. They'll actually have to comitt to what they started instead of ruining the game for everyone else . Eventually, people would actually become educated to not lobby dodge like assholes because boohoo it's \*insert killer / spirit \* again and I can't be bothered to learn how to play .
---
Their choice
---
But it's not even fun for the killer to play against new players, at least for me
---
You're a good person, the dbd community would do well with more thoughtful players like yourself.
---
I only dodge if the ping is doo doo. Other than that I'll play. If I see like 4 flashlights or some shit I just bust out my boy doc and render them useless lol.
---
fat
---
Was not offering to go to his house at all, that's creepy.
---
YES! YES! YES!
---
I agree but again, what are ya gonna do? It's better this way. If it were a rank 9or so killer in this case, the rank 1 can hard carry the other 3 so it has to be like this
---
Oink
---
Yay
---
Touch√©. If editing the title was a thing, I would totally remove the unnecessary "rn", but alas we do not posess such technology.
---
Well that's pretty much confirmed at this point, but why couldn't it be the teacher, I would've loved to see that, or the Alchemist, that would've been super interesting, instead it's just spirit but she's a dude and no-one likes him. With spirit at least the people who play her usually like her.
---
Doctor tortured people for the government? Trapper abused the miners who worked for his father then caused a mine collapse. Clown was a serial killer and implied rapist. The rest I think were unwilling mostly.
---
That would mean giving both Susie and Joey default cosmetics just like Julie and Frank have.
---
Otherwise it would become a P2W situation
---
I'd agree with this if they simultaneously made more killers viable at high ranks, because currently, you either down  super fast, or you lose the game by default on account of how fast generators can and will go, even if the survivor runs in a straight line and throws down every pallet without even looping it
---
Spirit isn't so much good as she simply has the advantage of not trading away 2 generators by the time the first chase end. Not to say the way you get downed doesn't feel cheap, but if the survivors actually go for generators instead of crouch around, you really can't afford to spend more than 30 seconds in a chase
---
Who the fuck gilded your bitter ass?
---
Thanks for sharing! I'm not sure I'd have the ability to play the same killer that many times in a row.
---
Just a heads up that the terror radius stats in the video are out of date. The Shape now has no terror radius is T1. It's only been like that for 2 - 3 weeks now, I think.
---
Basically cause he's an abusive asshole who hurt Rin and that's why everyone who likes the spirit hates him, but everyone who hates the spirit hates him cause he gave us the spirit in the first place.
---
The text is broken. It‚Äôs actually 2 minutes
---
Hex: Go Fuck Yourself
---
Yummy lore. But do we hate trapper for his abuse. Do we despise doctor for doing dirty work for the government? We all hate clown so no point in restating that question. My point is the hatred towards rins father is unnecessary but I understand why it exists.
---
19 bp is legit impossible. Literally any action in the game gives more than that.
---
This USED to happen.
---
Now everyone just sits on the line and rushes off JUST before you could smack em.
---
Cuz being a dick is fun and healthy
---
&gt; They'll actually have to comitt to what they started instead of ruining the game for everyone else .
---
No they won't, they will just suicide on hook. What then? Start complaining every day until BHVR starts punishing people for "griefing"? 
---
&gt;At the moment it's about 6AM~ in Europe where I'm playing and there are over 12k people playing on steam alone ( keep in mind that there is also crossplay with Microsoft store ) 
---
Isn't the info on steamdb global? 12k global isn't that much if you ask me. 
---
&gt;That is a decently sized player base, and the reason games take so long to find is the servers being utter shit rather than the difficulty of finding players to fill the lobbies up. 
---
Also because we have ranks ranging from 20 to 1, the necessity of finding 4 survivors for each killer, the necessity of finding a killer of a specific rank for all the SWF groups queuing and all of this while trying to maintain a balanced matchmaking otherwise people complain its unfair.
---
&gt; Eventually, people would actually become educated to not lobby dodge like assholes because boohoo it's *insert killer / spirit * again and I can't be bothered to learn how to play .
---
Ah, I see the problem. If people don't want to play against boring killers, loadouts or play styles, they won't. End of story.
---
Deliverance is bugged at the moment. Just a friendly heads-up.
---
Yes when and why do you. 
---
Not a does everyone lobby dodge? 
---
This question seems to be pointed at only three people that dodge not the special people that need to feel instant gratification of not lobby dodging. 
---
Mate it‚Äôs just the fact that you can‚Äôt read clearly.
---
Nurse killed 54 people in one night
---
Puppers has said before that it's his favorite game despite the issues
---
Unless you immediately start mending in their face lol.
---
Who?
---
A while ago people called me crazy when I mentioned it being gone
---
It‚Äôs actually a good change tho. It makes it so you can‚Äôt be as toxic and it buffs killers, as you won‚Äôt hit then by accident with others around
---
Animation after hitting a wall is shorter than the weapon cleanse thing
---
*When you main Killer because you cant fucking hit skill checks*
---
**PROFESSIONAL CASUAL**
---
He isnt that person anymore.Stop spreading bullshit.
---
Niiiiice. Plague is the only Adept killer I have, and that was a tough few games to get.
---
I don‚Äôt have her yet haha
---
Is 891 bloodpoints really worth your hand nerves and hardware lifespam? Unless you use a macro.
---
Who the fuck thinks this is a thing.
---
I used to think the same but think about this. If the killers purple rank vsing 2 reds and 2 yellows, the reds can hard carry and loop the purple without much issue. Then the yellows get boosted to a rank they shouldn't be in.
---
running around like a madman stabbing everyone is my favorite thing about legion
---
Thanks for the positivity. The point of the perk 2 is made to be like ghostfaces but. It is 2 gens not all and activates differently. I think it would be a cool  to combo those perks because thats the purpose the knight serves to block gens.
---
Yeah sorry, just had a bad day yesterday with a rather awful leatherface  who messaged me taunts because I got out of the basement on borrowed time and he couldn‚Äôt camp me
---
With all the mori's?
---
Yes tbh. It's not hard pressing space. I think you should still skip the phase and die instantly, but just get the point for struggle. Saves the time wasted and you still get the points
---
yeah vid has been in the works for a little bit. Lotta stuff outdated but still proud of it
---
When you don't like something on reddit, try to scroll past it. LPT
---
FAKE. DOWNVOTE.
---
Yeah I've been getting so many killers with mori or just plain ass holes who tunnel and camp lately. Rank 1 survivor also.
---
I'm pretty sure trapper killed his dad for making him into a monster but he was still abuse to the miners. Doctor still had a choice. Rins father was working nonstop for 22 years and he had a lot of stress. He was hearing voices. Whether he had mental health issues or it was the entity manipulating him I'm not sure. Tbh he doesnt even sound evil. He just lost his mind and took it out on those who were the closest to him.
---
HOW THE HELL IS THIS FAKE I EDITED THE DAMN PICTURE I CAN POST THE ORIGINAL RIGHT NOW IF U ALL WANT PROOF GEEZ
---
and also THANK YOU! for watching :) hope you liked it &lt;3
---
If you read rins bio it basically says the man lost his mind. He was crazy stressed and overworked. Not really evil. I'm pretty much assuming up until that point he was a loving caring father.
---
Or, use the comment section to voice my opinion because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs there for.
---
Don‚Äôt like my opinion, try to scroll past it. LPT.
---
That is exactly what I thought should happen and I know that it‚Äôs not a big deal but it‚Äôs like you are punished for playing relatively well.
---
Honestly, the scariest thing is there's people in real life who work themselves to the bone like that. I feel so sorry for them, but they have to do it so they don't starve, so I kinda understand him a little better now. Still don't like him tho.
---
Sounds about right. He just snapped from everything and went psycho. I said it twice and I will say it again, it's stupid that people hold such a grudge for a fictional character who had some form of justification.
---
F*ck her drag, right?
---
But I must has karma and I must has alot. gimme upvote
---
/s
---
Yeah it's not all that much. But the extra 1k is nice
---
I get that. I prefer to play for the team when surviving. I only ever DC rarely as a protest at the killer in the hope they might play different next time when I'm super frustrated with it. 99.9% of the time I struggle on the hook as much as possible to keep the killer from hunting down my team.
---
Oof. Tunneling usually doesn't bother me but camping. Big frocking oof.
---
Yeah but we all thought that with stranger things AND more importantly the scoops ahoy!
---
Oh i know saying I‚Äôd rather have a gladiator is knit picky but that doesn‚Äôt mean I judge anything you do differently. I take how I see every perk as in it‚Äôs added to the game. 
---
Yes anti gen perks are good but number 2 is too much of a Ghostface perk.
---
Even if it‚Äôs a rough draft I will judge as in you want it in the game since you posted that. I‚Äôm giving you a fair judgement as I do everyone else. 
---
The whole power thing is just the fact that if you miss it you are on the shoulders of a killer which is neither fun for both sides. 
---
People also train themselves (especially on pc) to get good at skill checks. There‚Äôs a skill check simulator on the web and that would be the 1. Counter to this killer lol. 
---
I like the animation but I don‚Äôt think the power is going to cut it, it would have to be something else or do something else.
---
People dc against me all the time as ghostface. It's not because of anything I do. They see the killer and leave. You betcha he will be nerfed at some point.

Sometimes u have to choose between not hooking gaining map pressure for more slugs and a chance just winning that's something trappers just have to do bc hooking creates no map pressure bc it tells survivors "oh he is over there it's fine" and then u could get cucked by BT
---
That does look cool, for having a sacrifice. And could load things faster.
---
It doesn't take much to negate it either. If you've got 4 healthy, unhooked survivors you should be able to brute force the 3-gen. 
---
And if you don't have 4 healthy, unhooked survivors then the Doctor didn't "sit in one area the entire game."
---
You're just another crybaby survivor that doesn't want a challenge.
---
And sometimes if you don't wiggle you die and sometimes if you do wiggle they'll still let you have it.
---
no you are taking the worse possible take from what i said. there are some strats that are looked down upon and this is one of them. sitting at 3 gens from the beginning of the game planning for the survivors to come to you. ill just dc and move on
---
As a killer: 
---
a) too many toolboxes
---
b) streamer/youtuber when I'm not playing good
---
As both killer and survivor: offensive nickname (Russians mostly) - I just don't want to play with these people
---
So basically go play a killer u haven't lvled and shit on noobs?
---
Hag isn't confirmed to be any sort of little girl when she was taken. There was a mention of learning from the elders, but her age at kidnapping is never indicated to be young.
---
No and no
---
Like I said, to my knowledge. I don't play hag or care in the slightest about her lore, but I knew she was kidnapped in some weird cannibalistic cult.
---
No problem (:
---
The devs claimed it is supposed to give you better items but it actually doesn‚Äôt, big surprise.
---
I wait at the exit gate to make sure others are safe before leaving, and to let the killer have two no-chase hits, which grant a giant bonus in chaser category
---
Same I bought ash even though I've never watched the show or seen the evil dead movies. I haven't even bothered leveling him up to level 30+ yet
---
She did a little better than the people I usually run into. They just drop the pallet while I'm stunned from DS therfore wasting it. Best thing to do after using DS is to just run and put distance.
---
But what if you got bubba and hillbilly?
---
if you have everyone on the same page yes but by the time a bunch of solos realize this its already too far into the game. it is very easy to smack leave go back to gen repeat for infinite take 5 seconds dude. i would like to enjoy the gameplay loop you know. id like to enjoy my video game
---
I did one survivor and killer for the achievement but after that I said screw it, there‚Äôs too many cosmetics to be wearing bloody outfits. No one cares if you‚Äôre prestige 3.
---
Bro im lvl 46 fuck me dude
---
I‚Äôd buy these damn comics.
---
I have not found the icon backgrounds to change.  In the sets I have seen online, they just added them to the icon, and that is not how I wanted to do it for the first time.  
---
Alas, that may actually be the only way.
---
What the fuck are you talking about
---
Discordance is actually better at tier 1 than tier 3 as well. I think they should just remove all of the first tiers of every perk. It takes so many bps to get every perk it‚Äôs insane.
---
Now I just like to switch back and forth to him in lobbies to get him to say lines. I guess that‚Äôs worth $5...maybe
---
big thanks to the homie who left two keys in chests for me. it‚Äôs definitely nice when you have at least 1 person on the team running it!
---
timer bans do nothing ill just go play another game. less bp i could see
---
wtf
---
Survivor mains and calling literally every killer in the game annoying: name a more iconic duo
---
OKAY: Old MoM was to OP, should not be nerfed as bad as it was? No absolutely not. The problem was that survivors could gain a free extra chance for doing NOTHING. They could have definitely worked for it but they didn't have to, there was also no counter besides grabbing them out of a locker/window but why would they even do that then? It just needs to be buffed to work with safe hook rescues as well as protection hits.
---
SWFs and bad luck
---
Im waiting at the exit gates to get more blood points from boldness and giving free hit to killer so he can too get something
---
If they haven‚Äôt already maxed out chaser, sure. I didn‚Äôt say you‚Äôre an asshole if you wait at the exit gate, I said you‚Äôre an asshole if you wait at the exit gate to teabag. I get making sure your team is safe but when you‚Äôre all (whether it be 1/2/3/4 survivors left) at the exit gates waiting to teabag it‚Äôs not cool.
---
Sweety, you probably went  down immediately and killed yourself on hook. Getting chased for 2 minutes with vaults, pallet drops, possibly a stun etc would have had you close to maxing out boldness points.
---
Git gud :)
---
No you‚Äôre just a fucking nitwit
---
Will we be able to do the previous tome after?
---
Awesome. But why are you teabagging when you do it?
---
*laughs in excitement*
---
Giving him nurses blinks/hillbillies chainsaw/clowns bottles for a short duration is worse than actual nurse/hillbilly/clown having blinks/chainsaw/bottles at all times
---
To my knowledge, I wouldnt see why not.
---
Are you OK?
---
Who said I teabagg?
---
Queues at red ranks are 5+ minutes so I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because the majority of the players aware red or because there‚Äôs no red rank killers. I find it too easy to pip in the game so I can‚Äôt stay in purple but that‚Äôs definitely the most fun imo. You actually get a variety of killers too, not just huntress, Ghostface, and billy. It gets old.
---
People just die if last hooked as it just wastes time. Its 800 points for over a minute just you sitting on hook. It ends the game
---
Then either link the original video or don‚Äôt post it
---
I really don't know why people downvoted you here. you CAN'T hit survivors on hooks anymore.
---
Proof: I'm rewatching my yesterday's stream to find it for M1 hits, [have a chainsaw for now](https://www.twitch.tv/oicmorez/clip/PolishedBlithePeppermintHotPokket)
---
If I don't manage to find it, I'll just do it on tomorrow's stream and put that in
---
Lol butt hurts killers not loving the deep squat
---
Me too i lost my kates shirt
---
They need to fix his stalking and Myers for that matter. They are both glitchy af right now. Other than that there fine
---
Damm i hope this is like LTN‚Äôs dropped 100 times videos would love a full series
---
It's a dumb change. They essentially just buffed facecamping
---
I'ma be honest.... that would be AWESOME.
---
....yeah.
---
I've seen multiple streamers with like 300 ebony moris lol.
---
I do like clowns perks better
---
Yes we can but it‚Äôll only give bloodpoints no fragments
---
It's the current state of the game that's making it happen. I will be the first to admit i get can get triggered fast but boy do i hate how the hitboxes are on dedicated right now. Combine that with europe being flooded with eastern european/russian killers constantly and ill play 3 games on a day and call it quits
---
i feel relatively sure he's the next killer. i mean his archive entries say he'll kill anyone if he can get a whiff of those good flowers. his obsession with understanding the entity/trials has given way to an addiction to something only the entity can give him access to which makes him a killer that's easy to control. plus his fixation on the serum already lays the groundwork for a potential killer power.
---
i mean lore-wise, they're skipping out on a goldmine if it's not him imo
---
Spirit.
---
Really.
---
I never realized tbagging was seen as something negative.  Just looked funny to me.
---
Iron Will combined with No Mither counters Stridor (the effect stacks), big brain plays
---
Usually I‚Äôd watch those subtitled japanese porn.
---
How would the killer win?
---
bro you ever stop puting words in my mouth?
---
Some people say you have to be a youtuber or streamer with a good following to unlock it.
---
Why are people booing this man? Literally i pressed play as killer on PS4 and i got into a match instantly
---
Well that's the thing was it really worth getting Bruce Campbell to "voice" him? When I heard that there was actually gonna be voice lines I expected him yelling "holly fricking shit" when he got hooked or something but all we got were like 10 lines... in a lobby and on the menu.
---
I actually did this FOR a Steve- and he actually thanked me in post-game chat. Made it totally worth it tbh.
---
I play both sides and think you‚Äôre an ass if you teabag fair killers. Everyone knows they are doing it to taunt you, sorry it can be frustrating to see people who‚Äôve clearly won stay behind just to try and rub it in and then insult you afterwards. I just don‚Äôt get off on it like some people I guess. I take my win and go.
---
Sadly, you can't edit backgrounds themselves.
---
You have to add the background to be a part of the icon
---
Retardo devs nerfing her into the ground
---
Why aren‚Äôt you just given the points then?
---
I genuinely believe that people who main survivor aren't over the age of 15
---
Dead Hard takes zero skill as well and you can do it multiple times a game.
---
If someone is running MoM and it activates, you are clearly out playing them and it only happens once a game.
---
DH was and is way more of a crutch than MoM ever was.
---
They could just give you the points then
---
Apparently this subreddit really likes this particular streamer.
---
Can't blame them am I right tho.
---
Sounds like it'd be a little too long for a mori animation
---
Nurse seems pretty free to me for a killer that has no price tag on it's chapter.
---
Well spirit is considered the strongest killer in the game currently. Do with that information what you will.
---
its not that you shouldnt cleanse, its that you should cleanse optimally, not just whenever you are  sick
---
Yeah, me too. I main spirit and she is very fun and all but clown perks are better. I use pop goes the weasel on a lot of killers and bamboozle can help shut down that pesky shack loop.
---
Papa Yamaoka is very similar to Nurse in that he just completely snapped. Not to say he's like, a good dude or anything but he's not exactly evil incarnate either.
---
Dectective tapp new killer
---
It's pretty much what happens when you have splinters but own the killer.
---
Got it! So I should get clown
---
Just give her some tome shit some entries and a cutscene
---
No lol
---
But what about the many documented cases on this subreddit where someone Kobe'd with DS next to the open gate or got the hatch?
---
Very awesome!
---
Devotion 6, level 82
---
Killer mains... missing the point of the statement. üòäüòÜ
---
If you like. Good in a chase, no map pressure. Two fun perks. Pros and cons.
---
Hag can't get looped...
---
Definitely had some inspiration from his videos! with the amount of positive feedback im getting i definitely intend to do more with the other killers
---
Play nurse, I've gotten a couple by splitting off of a chase onto a Gen I know is being worked on
---
Oh how the shit did I forget about stranger things?
---
I did not in this video, but i have since recording it and it is crazy strong. Will probably do a standalone video of that by itself at some point :)
---
Pretty sure he was just joking mate
---
Yeah maybe it is Rin's father but what if it's a samurai killer? Just pulling
---
so cool!
---
Unsung champion
---
I was wondering the same but what else could have been taken? 
---
Bottles from the clowns cart? ,hatchets from the hitresses shack? , reverse  bear traps from the game? 
---
A killer who has been around long enough to take other killers items to use themselves but with a word twist.
---
I enjoy getting "ha ha you missed your DS!" In the post game chat, but I dont have the heart to say, "you didnt tunnel me so I didnt feel right using it."
---
Meanwhile my friends bitch and moan if they miss their's, so they can fail at doing head-on stuns over gens.
---
I'm gonna be honest they shouldn't have that chance. They've lost. It's just cheese if they get away due to that
---

Its 800 points if you care that much dont get hooked after everyones dead.

It might be but like it's meant to sorta be ferocious and quick if that makes sense so maybe like a 3-4 second Mori if it's done really quickly
---
Don't look at the perks - decide whose power you like most. I first "bought" Hag, then Spirit and I currently have 10k+ more shards sitting around because I first want to level all my remaining characters before buying another one. Also, I don't give a damn about cosmetics so that comes in quite handy. Eventually, you'll get 9k shards again so can buy the other one anyways.
---
Go in the game and look at the news tab.
---
Keys always there's no skill to using a unbalanced item, it's like bragging after getting a 4k with a mori. Old insta-heals.
---
I also used to dodge against OoO SWFS.
---
Good album
---
Considering that I've seen not one single object to buy that wouldn't include real-life-money as well, that might not be the worst thing.
---
I heard it was because of the new skin that got released and they took that sword but that's not really reliable.
---
Rin is an idiot and didn't think about which weapon actually killed her, failing history class SEVERAL times while working her job leading to her just assuming a Wakizashi is a Katana like a complete *idiot.*  Like *everyone* knows the difference between a Wakizashi and a Katana!
---
Jokes aside, oversight is likely.
---
the same thing happened to me too about a week ago but with randoms
---
"Get the fuck down from there!!"
---
Ugh, yes. I played with it for the tome challenge and noticed how freaking handy it comes in.
---
Of course, that's mostly for characters you don't have many items to start with.
---
she isn't really a child imo, she's more like a wild animal with the urges and desires of a human. not a perfect analogy but nothing in her lore points to anything childlike about her-- she clearly recognises herself as an adult and positions herself as a guardian. she's also broken and traumatised and insane and doesn't seem to understand how to keep these kids alive because her only interactions with other humans since she was eight were either murder or kidnapping.
---
obviously she's probably stunted developmentally because of what happened to her (you know, aside from the obvious ways,) but that's not the same as being mentally a child at all
---
i know this post isn't about that, but i have very strong feelings about the huntress
---
I find it funny that I see this a day after I got legion lol
---
r/woooosh
---
Yeah, I would never cleanse a totem in a Spirit's face. The chances of it being Haunted Grounds is too high. I also don't think someone getting hooked is worth cleansing a lit totem.
---
That's what I had gathered.  That's a bummer.
---
That bubba is shit he didnt even stopped to look
---
https://imgur.com/k2KdG9m This survey result from 8 months ago says that 54.2% main survivor and 45.8% killer. 
---
Spirit hate has been around way before nurse add-on reworks were even announced. There's multiple reasons why there's more of it nowaydays: Its awereness has risen, streamers have started talking about it so naturally there's more of it now. More people have started playing spirit and more people have gotten decent at playing her. In the survey I linked, 16% said spirit was their main, and nowadays sometimes like 60-70% of survivor games can be against spirit. I had one more reason but can't remember it atm I'll edit the comment if I do.
---
Kuchisake-onna uses scissors tho.
---
I dunno, I didnt see the "/s"
---
You may not get a map right away or none at all but It has more benefits than running small game thats only useful for hex totems
---
Survivors should have limited lives instead of infinite respawns
---
If the killer face camps &amp; I escape they are definitely getting tea bagged at the gate.
---
Oh tofu did one not too long back. Was that it?

Sorry I gotta ask, what‚Äôs a tome?

Reading the comments, I feel like I'm the only one that would love to get Rin as a survivor as well. I just... want a better life for her.
---
I've started DCing as killer as soon as a survivor DC's. Don't wanna play? Fine! Now you don't have a match anymore! I change my stean name to "Surv DC = I DC" so there's no doubt why I left. 
---
On the plus side this means I can counter a ***TACTICAL DISCONNECT*** to give hatch. You can't escape through the hatch if I disconnect and end the game first, just like how if a survivor DC's "The killer doesn't kill you."
---
#CHECKMATE, ATHEISTS!
---
Why was Mettle of Man good? Taking 3 hits is a lot, and losing the killer after just one of those sounds hard
---
What are some good Spirit addons BESIDES anal beads?
---
&amp; that‚Äôs fine.
---
I don't know why people are trying to put words in your mouth when you started out saying it's the survivors' fault. Just know that you're being downvoted because you're upsetting people, not because you're wrong. Redditors are very emotional.
---
Survivors use tactics that annoy the killer. Killers use tactics that annoy survivors. That's just thee nature of this game, neither of them are wrong for doing it. It's not realistic for OP to say gen camping isn't real. I myself use gen camping (breaking chases to go back to my 3-gen spot constantly) all the time in this game, it definitely exists.
---
Lol, i haven't seen season 1 since it first came out that summer. What scene was this?
---
Play with your food is really fun on him. Other than that, your standard m1 killer build: spirit fury, enduring, BBQ and ruin with variations of your choice. As far as add-ons go, probably a mix of charge speed and chainsaw speed.
---
Loving the  pc version, but I was thinking about getting the Switch version, as I use it more due to convenience. Can someone who owns both tell me if they recommend it or not? Thanks!
---
can't wait for individual killer ranks
---
&gt;If you refuse to adapt
---
Evolve or die.
---
Guess the game was slowed down just a little bit to much
---
Beautiful! This was it! Thank you. :)
---
Mine inglish bad
---
How old is this kid?
---
Everybody here is just calmly debating 3 gen strats in a pretty civil way, except for you. You're the only one using personal attacks, raging and cursing people out left and right because you're getting emotional over a game. Who's the real crybaby?
---
The killers a just misunderstood!
---
Normally I wouldn't but he offered himself and it was humor for humors sake. We both knew It wasn't worth it but we did it anyway because it was funny.
---
Killers hate this one easy trick!
---
yooo this is great can you do legion?
---
If it‚Äôs an obvious SWF (same or similar names etc) or when there is a map because the ONLY time I see a map in high ranks is when the team plans to ~~genrush~~ play optimally.
---
I don't use discord! But happy to check our your twitch streams if you share the link :)
---
- Uses killer that gets a free hit
---
- Uses killer that gives survivors the option kf staying 1 hit all game, or holding M1 all game
---
- Cries for buffs
---
Legion is as dull as rocks. Not only that but he takes the least skill out of all killers. He needs a full rework. He shouldnt be granted a free hit.
---
If you ever get to that point mate, just relax take a breather and do something else. 
---
Hell grab a cold one.
---
I always feel like somebody is watching me
---
I guess they're both just trying to stay fed. But Pennywise does it in a much more interesting way. Besides, I didn't hear anyone asking for Rin's father, at least not over everyone trying to boycott Rin herself
---
A man of dbd
---
Theentityslefthand or something like that is a trapper main 100%.
---
Are they worth buying? My friend says they suck
---
I was always thinking that the game wait for everyone to load before starting... guess I was wrong :/
---
I play both and laugh whenever I am teabagged.
---
The fact people get salty about this is the exact reason it will always be a thing.
---
Uf5f
---
Bloodlust 3 with PWYF at 3 stacks would be busted then. 145%? My God.
---
Is he on YouTube or Twitch?
---
Twitch for sure, not sure about YouTube.
---
I had 9k shards before but i wasted them on legion when they first came out
---
Devotion 7 level 5
---
I've been playing the game for about six months now and I never knew that was a thing.
---
Killers don't need to be nerfed, if you only have 19 bp there is no way that you were chased for 2 minutes. If you were chased for 2 minutes you would have at least 2,000 bloodpoints if not more for other actions such as if you stunned the killer (1000 bp) and the points you would have gotten for struggling which is \~900 BP according to BHVR.   
---
 [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints#Boldness](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints#Boldness)
---
Holds M1 the whole game on a generator while other teammate loops
---
Thes hood nurse is better, spirit is just easier
---
Unless the killer was camping.
---
And don't forget how scratch marks can be barely seen.
---
Yeah I get you. It grates me when people misunderstand the backstory.
---
She's not totally animal though - doesn't one of the survivor quotes say she still has something human in her, unlike other killers? I think it's on her wiki page.
---
Whatever the situation is, she's definitely fucked up.
---
Thanks for the info! Gave him a follow. I'm new to Twitch but have watched all the Streamers' YouTube channels for months. Any other streams you recommend?
---
This is why I wait at the exit gates. Not to be toxic.
---
Ye
---
I also want to know
---
you know... 
---
for **R E S E A R C H**
---
can they make this, please?
---
Whats the point of this? Got them in every match. I'm a rank 1 killer and survivor.
---
I mean there is a good reason if the killer pissed you off by playing dirty. I leave if the killer played nice. But if he facecamped or tunneled me or my team I teabag them.
---
Looking forward to when they make some changes so people stop bitching about them relentlessly so that I can feel conformable to buy them with shards. XD
---
To he honest though, they are still toxic and face camp. Even when app you were doing the whole game was generators, or being chased, though not as ask intentional distraction.
---
bad.
---
I love Laurie but her face... And her reputation. I can't play her without killers thinking I'm gonna troll...
---
EAC also told us that they don't care, but if BHVR chooses to ban you they won't be able to do anything about it
---
Sweet fuck it bugs me when people think we don't use all our brains
---
Good for you. Sorry to offend you with my happiness lmao
---
Fungoose (him and otz are friends) 
---
One of my favorite streamers with killer builds and explains himself, watch out for rapgod mode where he speaks fast explaining things. 
---
He doesn‚Äôt mind questions and the chats usually super nice. If you !Nurse or whatever killer name it‚Äôs a command that will give you the perks he recommends and why. He has one for all killers.
---
I ship him with Billy from Stranger Things.
---
How do you know that Rin's father would be just like her?
---
There have been so many recreations of that scene put on here, that I can't even crack a smile. Any meme that uses that scene is instantly shit.
---
I thought as long as you disconnect through wifi being turned off and not quitting you dont depip or lose items still?
---
I don't do that because I usually want to get a new game quicker but all I can say to this is: grow a spine, it ain't that serious
---
he probs means that the time of legions launch, where he was a free 4k machine
---
I didn't mean advertise my stream, I just mention that I was testing it while streaming and that I will send a proper proof later. I will edit it out tho
---
Just wait until you rank up, it's way more common there. 
---
Honestly it might be due to the rank reset being in a day or so. I'm noticing far more disconnects lately than normal.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I have a spine, I can walk pretty okay. Thank you though! It‚Äôs not that serious but you‚Äôre still an asshole if you do it to fair killers, thanks for coming to my shit post &lt;3
---
I honestly don‚Äôt know, but I promise you will rarely come across that kind of behavior in higher ranks. And if they ever add an incentive to ranking up it will be less and less common. Some people quit to derank on purpose which blows my mind because the game simply isn‚Äôt challenging or amusing at low ranks.
---
No, I'm just pointing out how much of a hypocrite you are. You whine and complain that people are whining and complaining, when you're the biggest offender. If it makes you feel better to take pride in being an asshole go ahead. But just because you're saying the things "people don't want to hear" doesn't mean there's actually any truth to them. You clearly just get off on being self righteous and think that if you insult people enough, it means you've won the argument.
---
You're the kind of person that people stop arguing with because they're tired of talking to you, not because they're actually wrong.
---
People brought up Rin's dad being a survivor and it occurs he would be the first villainous survivor. That ultimately we enjoy seeing die. That would be interesting and able to open the door to other kinds of character's.
---
I think it should scale the other way. you want to give them less time to cleanse it
---
Plot Twist: Killer vs Killer mode incoming. Rin vs her dad, competing to off survivors and then the winner moris the other.
---
Why should you deserve to have fun at the expense of others?
---
Yes, he post videos sometimes. I think you'll find the link to his YouTube on his Twitch page.
---
....And? I fail to see how any of those killers' designs are in any way dictated by their choice of weapon. (This is evidenced by the fact that some of their cosmetics replace their weapon with something else- like Myers wielding a pipe, or Legion wielding a ruler with a math compass stuck to it. If Myers can be the same with a pipe or a knife, then two killers can wield a sword and still be quite different). You're assuming that BHVR has no imagination- what's stopping them from doing something completely different aesthetically and mechanically but the two killers both wield similar weapons?
---
And if you're really getting down to it, a shattered wakazashi that forms out of thin air is quite different than... well, any kind of katana. For all we know he's going to be a demon that holds a flaming sword or something. There is no reason to think that the two will be in any way similar unless you lack the imagination that you're ascribing to BHVR.
---
PLOT TWIST: THAT'S AN INCREDIBLE IDEA AND I LOVE IT
---
Makes sense to, the entity has pockets of time for the trials and can go to different time and dimensions. It would make sense and totally push the story if they made her a survivor.
---
Agreed on exit gate, disagreed on ds though
---
Who is ligma?
---
1: i'm not gonna check ur recent post like you told others.
---
2: DAMN YOU SUCK the killer was rank 15. FIFTEEN

I burn a white ward with nothing if I make a trade with a friend, usually a spoopy
---
I wouldn't mind sprit if she had a vault animation and some sort of audio cue when she phase walks so you can't bamboozle people on pallets to make them vault into you
---
theyre fun if youre into their style and gameplay but you wont be 4king the survivor teams past rank 10 unless they really fuck up or you have a good build. theyre very much a fun over effectiveness killer. discordance is worth getting them tho.
---
Pebble goes through walls?
---
The entire asset is different tho. it used to have two sword "slots", now it has three
---
I think my favorite thing about
---
&gt; making their fan base wonder what the actual *fuck* they are doing. 
---
Is that I feel people think that with almost everything BHVR does and it's usually not for good reasons.

This is why DC bans should be implemented . . .

Never seen someone who said deja vu is a counter against something.
---
I'm not whining and complaining about them. I'm insulting them because they're little crybabies who think they have the right to dictate what their opponent can and cannot do in a video game.
---
You said yourself in another comment:
---
&gt; Survivors use tactics that annoy the killer. Killers use tactics that annoy survivors. That's just the nature of this game, neither of them are wrong for doing it.
---
But that's what these people are arguing against. That's what they're complaining about. They say that the killer shouldn't protect 3 generators and force a 3-gen endgame. They say it's "looked down on" as a strategy or "is unfair."
---
Even the person you responded to in the other comment was arguing that Killers shouldn't force a 3-gen.
---
And they keep saying it. Over and over. Everyone I've spoken to here keeps coming back and try to argue about how they're right. They don't stop arguing because they're tired of talking. They keep at it because they insist they're right and will never realize how hypocritical they are. All I'm doing is pointing that out to them.
---
In a mean way? Sure. Do I have to be nice?
---
Not to little crybabies.
---
You? You're not hypocritical. You're stating a fair point (I'm mean). I'm not being mean to you.
---
There's a difference in how I treat someone who brings a fair argument to the table and someone who brings the hypocritical "Killers have to play how I want or I'll just DC" argument. People who say "My opponent has to follow my made up rules or I'm ruining everything for everyone" don't deserve niceness.
---
Though you are trying to defend those people... So maybe you're a little misguided? Though you're probably just more on the "Desdomen is being mean" more than "Defend those Desdomen is being mean towards." Can't hate you for wanting to see a little more niceness in the world though.

DBD : battle royale
---
Yeah, but if your not hit 3 times you‚Äôre already going to win...right?  The killer probably gonna hit you twice before you ever get hooked, so your basically semi-immortal after your first hook, no?  The extra hit is a powerful tool!
---
Link?
---
Imo clown seems tougher to play with and be good. I dont think he can go as high in the ranks as spirit could if you got good with her. I'm sure if you were good enough with clown you could it's just not as easy or common.

Just because he would be using a similar weapon, does not mean it'll be a similar killer. I'm interested to see what happens with him
---
I searched ‚ÄúFirst Cut trailer‚Äù but found nothing. An i doing it wrong?
---
I have never depipped from a killer DCing so where do you get that idea from?
---
People are screaming punishments and that they should implement systems to stop DCing when in fact a big part of DC‚Äôs at the moment comes from the servers randomly kicking people.
---
Which is probably why you see people against further punishment atleast for now.
---
They should fix the servers before they punish people for trying to use them
---
What about deliverence with DS? That's 2 perks you have that is just negated totally just because you are the last person alive and haven't been hooked yet.
---
Play killer for once whiners will find you.
---
Pretty sure they don't, it's all back on your inventory.
---
It literally shows you the 3 generators that are closest to each other at the beginning of the game and every time a generator pops. It's literally built to counter the late game 3-gen.
---
Just because most people don't use it doesn't change what it was built for.
---
Hell, pop a map on with a Crystal Bead and you'll be showing all the survivors where the 3-gen is. That way you can force a break from the very beginning.
---
Is it an efficient use of a perk slot? Maybe, maybe not... But Iron Will is in the same pool of "Extremely Situational" and people are saying to use that to counter Spirit.
---
Kekketh or cringeth?
---
I would absolutely adore this addition. She IS 'The Walking Dead' to me at this point.
---
Match people who leave with other leavers. That way if you think disconnecting is fine you wont mind if your team or opponents do it
---
Can't say for sure but judging by how fucking long I waited for a gen to be clean the other day after she revomited on it, I'd say it does reset it.
---
That's how it is supposed to work however that is not what is happening.
---
Because it has been fine to DC as an survivor for years now. Sure people complained but it was basically taken as a joke.
---
Now that survs get punished from DCing they suddenly want further punishment on killers.
---
On top of that the game is kinda unstable so a lot of killers DC atm simply because they get force kicked from the game. Nobody‚Äôs fault except BHVR
---
if i dont see any heart beats or if they are too far then im gunning for your ass and your ass only
---
It was way overpowered. It would make chases much longer (remember, it‚Äôs one extra hit per survivor to down them). If 2 or more survivors used it, and they were somewhat good, then it was GG. It was basically a ¬´¬†fuck you killer¬†¬ª for no good reason.
---
Yeah, why can‚Äôt I put people on hooks for my own amusement? This world is cruel...
---
You think that fine baby, then you do you but when exit gates spawn badly, like on the same side of the map. Especially right next to each other, that's an issue to be fixed, my sweet baby child.
---
I mainly mean when other people come up to teabag during DS, not necessarily the person who used DS although if I left you and happen to find you again right before your DS went out it‚Äôs not really worth a teabag or if I pick you up at the door because everyone else already escaped and you teabag it‚Äôs kind of annoying.
---
you forgot prayer beads
---
If the killer is right there chasing you, all right. 
---
But waiting at the exit gate when the killer is nowhere around? Bro just leave the game and move on, if the killer played well he already has stacks of BBQ and a ton of hits on his score, you are wasting my time for a few hundred points.
---
I hope your title is sarcasm
---
No... no it's not. One is spelled 'metal' and the other 'mettle'.
---
I still feel like the Legion could have worked as that, have the Legion be the only Killer who can also be a survivor, Mask on Hoodie up is killer, Mask Off Hoodie down is survivor, play with the 'darkness within us' motif.
---
The fact that you think anything ever gets fixed is what was so naive about your comment. These are just words, dont let them affect you so much.
---
Unless I think I can still help another survivor or heal/get healed by someone for extra points, I always leave immediatley. No point wasting my (and the killers) times by standing around like an idiot IMO.
---
Int3ract (sorry if I whiffed the spelling) is both Twith and YouTube. You've likely seen his videos explaining killer's details to the decimal. The thumbnails look like a chalkboard. His videos for killers is amazing and many streamers (Especially Otz) reference his videos often.
---
OhTofu has been playing since basically day 1. He has some phenomenal videos on YouTube as well, more so gameplay and perk breakdowns. His Twitch is very fun to watch. The man really loves the community.
---
Of course they say gg. It¬¥s easy to say gg when you win.
---
It¬¥s not as easy when you lose.
---
Farm Fresh!
---
Ive watched every Entity Education video!! I also love Tofu. He's so good at Billy.
---
How tf you gonna DS at the end of the game if you were ‚Äòtunneled‚Äô
---
Until they find out you have NOED as you get one of them while the rest run off. Satisfaction right there.
---
I can understand sore losers, but not being able to win with dignity is a *far* too widespread epidemic in this game.
---
Imagine actually believing this lmfao
---
Just make a macro. I had the exact same feeling after getting fucked over so much (also my keyboard is pretty loud so it‚Äôs nice not spamming my friends headphones with a space bar.)
---
In this particular comment chain, /u/MarbleTheNeaMain started out saying people will complain about a 3 gen doc even though its their own fault, which is a true fact.
---
You went on to agree with them by saying it's the survivors' fault that they're getting 3 genned and then gave your idea of a counter to it (which I gotta say is easily re-countered by the killer just not chasing).
---
Then /u/CantingPython saying a killer can simply force a 3 gen, which is another true fact. You can never reliably lead the killer away from the gens, because the killer can just turn around and keep camping instead.
---
At this point, you pretty much start trashing his morality and call him a crybaby. I don't really know where this came from, maybe you started raging in another comment chain before this and you're taking it out on him.
---
Either way, you're misunderstanding my overall point. I'm not trying to say that gen camping is bad or good here, I'm literally just pointing out the fact that you're accusing everyone else of being a crybaby when you're pretty much the most angry person in this thread. People are just in here discussing the facts and then you come in and start putting words in peoples' mouths, assuming things about people's arguments and jumping to huge conclusions about them. I just figured something that sort of ridiculous has to be pointing out by *someone*.
---
And while we're cross referencing eachothers comments:
---
&gt; Do you care about me and my feelings? Do you not bring in Decisive Strike or Adrenaline or Dead Hard?
---
Here you are complaining about some overall pretty harmless perks (if you're a decent killer), as if survivors who do these things have no right to have an opinion about how killers play. Do you seriously get offended when a survivor brings in post-nerf Decisive Strike?
---
Her default weapon is literally called Shattered Katana.
---
I like people that do that. I just get an extra 5k bps, and they get their extra obsession escaped and stun. If you are mad that they tbag, just wait for the endgame collapse
---
it is like THE HUNTING HILL HOUSE ALL OVER AGAIN
---
Likely outcome:
---
Survivors get through hatch
---
Killer remembers he has guy slugged on other side of map
---
Thinks theres no way the survivor could crawl there in time
---
Tenacity makes them crawl faster
---
People don't like to face a killer who is challenging, so they DC instead of learning how to counter her. But don't worry, when the devs nerf the Spirit and make her almost useless you won't get DCs anymore.
---
How dare I have an enjoyable experience with my friends.
---
So moris aren't just weird for me right now? They've all been misalligned in the last few days. I keep getting killed by thin air.
---
I wouldn't mind an actual samurai as killer.
---
The laughing perk could be on a count down like thrilling tremors or have it so for every hook get a token max 3 and when coming out of chase it spends a token
---
It would be epic if she left you after ripping the timer off, leaving The Pig free to move when the survivor dies in pain. You can watch them if you want, but you can just turn around and go somewhere else if you wish
---
I play in all honesty more surv than killer. DBD is a game I usually only play with friends so there‚Äôs that. And I only SUPPORT killer in these posts because it‚Äôs literally an issue many killer have atm and an issue I don‚Äôt have when playing surv.
---
Which is why I point out in most posts that I get a lot of random dc‚Äôs as killer which is demotivating as hell but none when I play surv.
---
So much I have completely given up on killer and only play survivor recently.
---
But you actually get healed when you cleanse and she has to find and chase you again for the duration. Making her lose more time. I think its better than getting one hit downed while being easy to spot
---
Swinging 'n' running. I loke that.
---
The first thing I did was googling OhTofu
---
then I checked the comments. someone beat me to it
---
In return you get to use exhaustion perks twice before becoming exhausted??
---
When i know the players wait at the gate ill already start browsing go get a drink or similar.  They probably think the killer is not even finding the gate , but iam long gone.  So it doesn't bother me at all.  During the match ill try to ignore it and just okay normally. The killer should be able to taunt as well x)
---
That I love crotch at the exit gate.
---
My point was that the truly toxic tbaggers have other words for you aside from gg.
---
Ya it doesn't happen every time a killer disconnects but it's often enough lol. Just one more of a hundred bugs needs fixed.
---
Spoiler:
---
In Chapter 2 IT there were some important objects that were memories of when they were children and also in IT 2 was missed
---
How dare the Killer have an enjoyable experience.
---
So... Which one of you is more deserving of an enjoyable experience? Why is **your** experience more important than the killer's?
---
And of course, the natural response is "Why is the killer's enjoyment more important than yours." To which, it isn't.
---
But the game mechanics are the great equalizer, isn't it? The game we play, that we agree to play together in-so-far that we queue up to play a 4v1, Survivors v Killer experience, say that the mechanics used are such.
---
If someone is using a mechanic in the game, it's fair use. No one, Killer or Survivor, gets to tell anyone else, Killer or Survivor, that they can't use a certain mechanic because [reasons].
---
Because if you say "Killers shouldn't do this because I don't have fun" I'm going to say "Survivors shouldn't do this because I don't have fun." And you don't want to start that game, because then touching a Generator is going to be outlawed and Killers will have squeaky toys for weapons and nobody will be having any fun at all.
---
... Yeah, because DCing after a Survivor has already DCs is gonna hurt them soo much.
---
Played with plague yesterday and wanted to comment here on this post but i lost it, and maybe if they just change how corrupt purge works and what it does, it can be nerfed a little...downed 3 survivors at once...kinda op
---
I haven't seen anyone mention this but what if it's her mother. I mean she died pretty brutally that night. Or an ancestor who died in war and returned home but not his home, the entities version of his home. Maybe we can even get another legend from japan like the slit mouthed woman or something
---
I would main the fuck out of that survivor Rin („ÜÅœâ„ÜÅ*)
---
Only when the match is clearly unbalanced (eg rank 6, 10, 26, 18).
---
Once I was second to last person alive with way too many gens left. I was downed and picked up, but DC'd so the killer wouldn't find the last surv with BBQ. Luckily, they managed to escape through the hatch. It may have been scummy, yes, but my goal was noble.
---
It was broken, because a single hit is around 30 seconds for M1 killer and unless you skip a hook state, you were guaranteed to have it.
---
when 4 survivors had it, it was bonus 2 minutes to a game that rarely lasts more than 8 minutes. Killers don't have time for that
---
It was a free escape card. it mostly activated in the end-game. getting two hits when the gate is open is hard enough. landing three is impossible
---
The "complaining" you are talking about is me literally just calling it annoying. Is it not annoying? did i say you shouldnt do it? did i say that i would DC if someone does it? 
---
Idk why you bit my ass so hard even though i was just making a statement on how it exist and it can be forced.
---
And yeah I know some killers do it on purpose and ofc I‚Äôm against that.
---
But they would need to be able to flush out assholes killers from the ones that generally just have issues at the moment.
---
I guess if people DCing is what's bothering you, I can see why you'd become passionate about it. DCing triggers you into being rude, just like people being rude triggers me into being rude. I see someone throwing out excessive insults in an otherwise tame conversation, and it immediately makes me feel less of that person. You're right in that I was more interested in attacking you for that then I was in "defending" anybody. 
---
I'll end my side of it by saying something you've probably already heard. Just because you disagree with someone doesn't mean you need to throw a tantrum and start throwing out every insult you can. I'm not just saying that because it bothers me, it's actually in your best interest not to. When you do that sort of thing, it just invalidates your opinion to people because they see you as unreasonable. Atleast people like me do. 
---
So if you're interested in actually changing someone's mind about the topic you're discussing, you'd do better to keep it civil. Otherwise they're not going to give a damn about whatever you have to say.
---
Why would you want the virgin Jason when you can have Chad Trapper.
---
Honestly, some ppl are too bad to face spirit...yeah she is op when u can play with her, but thats what makes her difficulty hard...nurse can also be very hard to go against when someone can play as her...
---
I think it's sad that she's probably going to be nerfed to the ground, she's strong yeah, but she's imo one of most fun killers to go against because she's actually scary to go against.
---
i hate this response so much. 
---
Everytime you talk about spirit its met with "iTs bC sHE Is gOOd".
---
People dont like her bc how easy she is and how unfair she is to the survivors. Its as simple as that.
---
I usually wait at the exit in case another survivor gets downed or hooked, but i don't tbag when the killer shows up.
---
It is not scummy to gen camp, for me, it is really fun building up enough pressure to outplay the killer with it. it always doesn't end up well for killer anyway that if 4 survivors are alive.
---
To be fair, that depends. Good killer, I wont ever teabag. But if you've been plying like a camping/tunnelling piece of shit then you gettin teabagged.
---
so you're saying stuff from the killers memories are disappearing in anticipation of something?
---
that's what happens when one survivor is still dying on the hook (and shows why you shouldn't be able to kobe when you're last)
---
Some of them even come in yellow versions too.
---
I feel like as soon as the trapper saw 4 blendettes with object tbagging across the map he just noped out, cant blame him
---
Well even then, low rank killers also have a shit ton
---
oh, the strongest type of perk in the game has a chance to backfire? this cannot be!
---
I wonder how much xp you would get if you actually leveled up from that
---
Spirit's dad as new killer
---
Man and you got on the 2nd best killer to farm BP, that's pretty lucky.
---
Still not worth it. Best case scenario you use the ward for an item that you could have just taken from your inventory, worst case scenario it's totally useless.
---
T bagging is always a dick move. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs part of the game, and it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all‚Äî but when you think about it, how can it be anything other than asshole behavior
---
I have a handful. I dont really go through 50+ bloodwebs though.
---
If you never died to a Spirit, then they weren‚Äôt good.
---
I really love these, keep them coming
---
&gt; excessive insults 
---
&gt; otherwise tame conversation
---
Here's the problem... The moment someone puts out the threat and ultimatum of "Play how I want or I'll DC" it stops being a tame conversation -- It's a tantrum.
---
And if they throw a tantrum, I'll throw it right back in their face. I don't care about actually changing someone's mind because these people will **never** change their minds. They're so secure in their hypocrisy that they think everyone else is wrong. You don't be civil in an argument with someone that isn't willing to listen.
---
They throw a tantrum, they get called out as crybabies. Simple as that. You want to defend that, that's your call... But ultimately I have to question why you want to defend that.
---
You seem to have the same mentality as I do, in regards to "Killers and Survivors should play however they see fit," yet you're here trying to defend people who insist otherwise... All because I was mean?
---
Instead of actually seeing the arguments at hand, and basing your opinion on said arguments, you're basing your preference on which side was mean or not...
---
That says more about you than anything else.
---
&gt; Idk why you bit my ass so hard even though i was just making a statement on how it exist and it can be forced.
---
Okay... I'll bite...
---
It was the "Play how I want or I'll DC" aspect of your comment. That shows such a high level of entitlement that you are no longer making a statement or participating in an argument, you're throwing a tantrum.
---
You're the playground equivalent of "Do what I say or I'm taking my bat and ball and going home!" And honestly, you don't deserve any respect after that point, so you get none.
---
And to show the breakdown of my posts:
---
[First Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv3a4y/listen_you_3_genned_yourself_not_me/?st=k2vpajj8&amp;sh=d27a3441): Wouldn't say it's mean. Maybe a little brusk, but not mean.
---
[Second Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv3a4y/listen_you_3_genned_yourself_not_me/f7alguh/?st=k2vpbj83&amp;sh=b0d09b7a): No personal attacks here. I used the verb "To bitch" in reference to your complaining but that more just vocabulary instead of directed attack. Maybe a little meaner than the first, but still no "Biting your ass."
---
[Third Post](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv3a4y/listen_you_3_genned_yourself_not_me/f7amkph/?st=k2vpbmsg&amp;sh=456dc5e1): Here's the first personal attack towards you. Let's see what it's in reply to:
---
&gt; i literally started out by saying that most of the time its the survivors fault.
---
&gt; You cant honestly be using the argument that just bc you have the tools to "counter" it, its not annoying. You get 4 slots. the chances of that perk being useful is prob 1/100.
---
&gt; **oh and i will DC against every spirit thanks.**
---
My bolding to highlight.
---
While I can be brusk and maybe my vocabulary might be a bit on the rough side, nothing was personal until you basically admitted to throwing a tantrum unless your opponent played how you like (specifically in Killer choice). You throw that tantrum, you no longer deserve a nice discussion. You get the tantrum thrown back into your face.
---
So yeah, that's where the ass biting came from.
---
so, you're saying the killer can force a 3 gen?
---
Ah yes, Jake üÖ±ark, my favorite survivor.
---
This is what I was going to point out...I am new to the game, so I may not have enough experience on the matter...but in the few weeks I have played (ps4), I have only run into a small number of spirits and, for the most part, then killers I run into are pretty much an even variety of the killer pool...currently rank 12, so maybe making my way from 20 has to do with that...playing with new killers that is, that are learning the game as well
---
I'm just wondering what she would look like in DBD, since Telltale's TWD has cartoonic graphics.
---
In all honesty when she gets nerfed it‚Äôs just back to only nurses and billy in red rank.
---
I think it‚Äôs fair to say that balance wise the game is dumb when half the killers aren‚Äôt really viable in the higher ranks.
---
Kinda boring just playing against the same killers over and over
---
Nah fam. It‚Äôs behaviour. You know they won‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs basically free bloodpoints if you get camped
---
Doing gens, you?
---
He be climbing through yo windows and snatching yo people up.
---
Im on a Plague spree atm. Sometimes I destroy them with the power, but most of the time chases get longer. The bigger the map the harder to snowball with vile is what I experience
---
Cool art style, I especially love the way you do hair.  The Claudette and Amanda sketches are my favorite!
---
opinions on people finding 3 gens close together and never leaving that area from the beginning of the match?
---
it‚Äôs fair and all but there‚Äôs fuck all you can do about it on solo que
---
The Big Sad
---
Survs use T-bags as hellos and banter between them. I personally T-bag once at exit gate to say bye. Same way I would nod or bang wraiths bell at exit gate
---
Ahoy
---
Love this idea but can 95% guarantee bEhaviour ain‚Äôt got the balls to do something that out there.
---
Of course not, but if Ruin is popped, Ruin would still be active since there's another Ruin totem.
---
Imagine 2x Ruin, 2x Haunted Grounds, 2x Thrill of the Hunt, and 2x Devour Hope.. 
---
Of course they don't stack, but that's a lot of totems for 8 survivors to be worried about.
---
Alot of angry spirits in these comments...
---
I'm not going to be forced to fight a killer that is no fun, I hate Spirit because she is a guessing game, not a mind game.
---
And when you successfully "juke" her you don't feel accomplished because you outplayed her you just guessed right. Spirit has all the cards and has advantage in all situations, whereas you are allowed to be cutscened by the killer over and over again much like how legion used to be.
---
I mean I play to have fun rather than just thinking about escaping, probably the most fun games I've played I've actually died in :) I can see how it could be easily abused  and I guess some people only care about escaping/4K-ing.  (not like they'll add this into the game anyway) And obvs they should probably prioritise bug fixes first! These connection issues are so bad right now rip
---
So yes I'm going to dc when i see her, I want to enjoy my night off of work thank you
---
Maurice
---
I was just coming here to post something similar. Why DC on death hook? If you already lost just stick it out. Are you THAT salty as a rank 7 you have to DC as I hook you? (The answer is yes)
---
Any skin Steve with P3 head - Steve by the end of the season
---
I find her extremely boring. She needs to at least have an indication between standing still and phasing and lose collision when phasing. It's just boring to "outplay" a spirit just for her to accidentally bump into you and it doesn't matter anyway.

Problem is you have to chase them out if you‚Äôve still got someone hooked/downed or running around the map, otherwise they can come back in and help
---
Ah, yeah ok I get that.
---
In my experience as both a Killer and a Survivor, this is more a Dwight thing than a Claudette thing.
---
Wait, you can use custom logos on steam now?

I've got a few of these, have some of the moonlight offering as well. They are just old.

Can confirm. Out of the many people I play with, the only one who teabags is a 25 year old who lives with their parents and has no job
---
No ur doing everything wrong stop playing spirit play nurse

You can't teabag me if I'm in the basement

You better bring the Nurse and the Doctor 'cause this pic is hella sick!!

Her lack of counter play is why people dislike her.

Claudette: eerrrmm...Ohhh that isn't running its breaking from the non-broken ruin your using
---
I'm rank 1
---
Typically I'll only see Adams using it as its his teachable, it's quite a rare perk to run.
---
Then act like it.

Top 10 worse anime endings

Number 1. Key in the dark lock I hated it
---
Moonlight offering were my favourite to use
---
It's a fun perk but no not really
---
I tried to make people shit their pants but only had one lerys offering. Guess what? I fucking used the vanity mirror accidentally
---
As somebody who played since launch, it was actually very helpful for me. I had no idea how fucking long those scratchmarks stayed there.
---
Was definitely surprised.
---
But yeah other than that, it‚Äôs just a neat perk because of the speed increase and tinkered more towards newer players.
---
The only dead by daylight game is teabagged at the exit gates was on roblox, exit the facility Beacause literally 95% of the killers i saw there were fucking campers, every single one of them would not move away from the survivor

Spirit doesn't really need a rework she just needs to have her glass shards actually glow when she is starting to phase which they do but it's fucking impossible to actually spot
---
In all my killer games over the last month I think I've seen it once.

Can I introduce you to my associate, League of Legends?
---
[Imo] the DbD community isnt *that* bad at all.
---
Paired with a couple purple mist offerings made finding Claudette impossible lol. Was still fun tho.
---
It's really difficult to "safely" reveal him if that makes sense. You can't exactly reveal him without him gaining a fair amount of stalk progress or even marking you right there and then. You look at him to reveal him and if you can see him he can see you.
---
Ah yes, Bungie. Those beautiful motherfuckers.
---
Solo queue it can be okay as no one saves you
---
Seriously, only remember going up against 3 of them in the last month, I survived all of them. I'm rank 8 on console.
---
Fathers' glasses, yes, I've seen some people running it but I'm incredibly terrible at tracking blood in general, even with Sloppy, I just can't see shit.
---
I would say on an average as long as I have owned the game that is about the same rate at which we have gotten our DLCS. Maybe closer to every 3, which would only be 1 more dlc.
---
I know you said playables and not dlc per say, but if you look at it per individual side it's only about one more character a year for killer/survivor respectively (excluding that some dlcs may vary and may not provide 1 killer to 1 survivor though most do)
---
And OW doesn't really have another "side" so it's not like the game requires them to release two different playables each time.
---
I hear you though, they do a pretty great job of providing new content to keep the game interesting and introduce new types of gameplay/tactics/etc.
---
IIRC he isn't actually evil, he snapped and the Entity pushed him further to the point of killing his family.
---
The ratio is always 4 to 1
---
That's why I liked it lol
---
Did you get to rank 10 as a killer or as a survivor ?
---
Dunno how you‚Äôre never seeing Spirits at purple ranks. At red ranks she‚Äôs nearly all I see. Her and Billy and Ghostface anyways.
---
Lol she doesn't need nerfs, she isn't OP, she just needs clearer signs of when she's using her power so that there's some actual counterplay.
---
But it has a draw back since you can't see scratch marks. Or was it a different one?
---
That's a blast to the past and a half.
---
I love the salt on PS4 messages when I‚Äôm killer or survivor. All I just say is: You mad bro? They say something back to me then I‚Äôll just keep saying, you mad bro? Eventually they stop or just lose their temper usually resulting in them swearing. I report the swear message and they usually get banned on PS4.
---
\*Plays uno reverse card on myself\*
---
Me:... fuck
---
He didn‚Äôt just do, he was pushed towards becoming it as his life became increasingly stressful, I‚Äôm not saying what he did wasn‚Äôt wrong but I think he deserves more sympathy than ‚ÄúHe killed his family cuz fuck it he wanted to‚Äù
---
Jake says: *the longer you're reading this the less you're running away from me. I can only get closer.*
---
Yeah her son is a streamer(or involved with a group of streamers?) and she played DBD on his Twitch channel in a charity stream.
---
Make this an actual thing please
---
Ok everything you just said, made no sense:
---
1. Gen rushing is not a thing
---
2. Tunneling a surv off the hook is a bad tactic that will lose you the game against good survs
---
3. Tunneling is just an asshole thing to do (I'm talking about PROPER tunneling, not what some peoppe try to make the word mean now)
---
Tbh just make it 2 stacks and it would be serviceable. And remove that your aura is revealed at full health when it‚Äôs active.
---
I bought the DLC for "look who's shitting in the tall grass"
---
By the way you aren't fighting the killer. You should not be able to beat a killer 1 on 1. There's a reason it's a 4 vs 1 game.
---
I actually like this idea. Good job OP!
---
the power play was to NOT pick her up, follow her to the hatch and then activate end-game
---
My uncle's a homophone  
---
Well, close enough
---
Also
---
Playing survivor = still 4 others in the game that can whine
---
Just going off of the leaked sounds and files for Chapter 14, it would make sense for Mr. Yamaoka to be the next killer. Here‚Äôs my thoughts on why. 
---
For one, Leaks By Daylight has been an incredibly reliable source. So, the files that were data mined features noted on the killer‚Äôs power, which will include switching between Normal/Crazy State. It will also feature a one-shot ability. We know that Mr. Yamaoka, lore wise, went batshit insane. With the katana missing, I feel that this would tie in correctly. As for the sound effects that were leaked: Upon hearing them further, they sound less like The Nun or Egyptian killer. In fact, one of the sound affects sounds like a deeper sounding version of Rin‚Äôs Phasing. The music that was released sounds similar to soundtracks I‚Äôve heard off Japanese Horror such as Fatal Frame.  Combine that with the heavy footsteps. 
---
Now, this is all just my thoughts and opinions. I‚Äôm sure we will find out soon.
---
Why do people want Pennywise to be a new killer? Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King, but we've already got one killer clown.
---
Also, I'm scared of clowns.
---
And.... The whining ensues..
---
My favourite is Huntress btw)
---
Bungie usually stuffs their games with little obscure secrets that require the community to come together to figure them out. They usually have really obscure answers as well
---
Obviously the gen requirement would have to be raised to like 8-10 range. They's also have to expand the maps; if you think low rank survivors are too scared to do gens **now**, imagine how slow the progress is when there are **two** terror radii.
---
Apparantly they did something with Warmind and hid a Replica of a Javelin somewhere
---
It‚Äôs not confirmed tho.
---
It can be fun but half the time I use it I either get downed first or the person I save runs at the killer lol. I wouldn't say it's meta. There is a fun build if you can get it work tho, deliverance d strike head on break down. You unhook yourself while the killer is near and then hop in a locker, if they pull you out you d strike then jump back in to head on them just as they recover from the stun, if they don't you pop out and head on them and then jump back in hoping the stun will piss them off and they will pull you out to get d striked.
---
I only with a toxic swf group
---
Definitely bottom
---
Unlucky. You insulted their god and got downvoted. Good try, soldier.
---
I think so.
---
Lol this. ‚ÄúRed ranks is only billy and nurse‚Äù
---
*spirit enters the ranks*
---
Nerf her!!
---
Well back to billy and nurse only I guess. Hmm guess at least there are a fair few freddys and ghostfaces there too
---
Inbefore it's the thief
---
Lol :D
---
Can‚Äôt wait to visit their concert this winter.
---
Perfection (especially Evil Within icon)
---
Thanksüñ§

wow that freddy was a blind ass
---
Oxford dictionary - ‚Äúa word that is spelled like another word *(or pronounced like it)* but has a different meaning‚Äù
---
You don't know if the killer is heading towards you though. All you know is the killer looked in your direction.
---
Play slug builds lmao. I love executing that strategy and post game salt only makes it better.
---
She stuns the killer for 5 seconds then stands next to the killer to try stun him again instead of running
---
'Gen camping' is the same as 'gen rushing', they aren't real.
---
I think its strong enough to be used, but i wouldn't call it meta. 
---
When i play killer im usually shocked when someone deliverances themselves, but not the point that im like "Who the fuck runs that?" like when i get flip flopped
---
Where's the billy?
---
In the hole.
---
Nerf LEGION! Too op! Runs at you with a PLASTIC SPOON!!
---
If so then make these requirements to be time banned IMO  
---
K: if 40 seconds have passed ( 40 seconds because it should be fine since nothing has really happened on both ends and if killer needs to do something )
---
S: if on-hook / being mori-ed / being sacrificed ( See example Above ) OR when a team-mate has been hooked / mori-ed / sacrificed / Disconnect before 30 sec ( rusher is gone, DC QUICKLY )
---
this would be fine right?
---
You forgot to add, that games are supposed to be fun for you in a first place. 
---
I'm not justifying dirty strats but if I feel like playing camping bubba or ghostface, I will play camping bubba or ghostface because it will be fun for me at that moment. Same for anything else. 
---
The only unforgivable thing is direct bm - nodding, teabagging etc
---
I mean I play console and all we ever face is face camping and slugging but hey ho
---
These are really accurate ! Good job OP
---
So, your killer concept is telling someone how you want to name him and let them make the concept? Brilliant idea
---
You can literally argue the same against spine chill. All you know is they looked towards you. Even for a couple seconds doesn't mean they are heading towards you. Just means they are looking that way. Hell as killer I strafe while chasing people to hide my stain, or to look around to see if I see other survivors. 
---
Either way I think the direction is way more valuable and it's a reason it has a cooldown
---
Thank you so much! There‚Äôs a couple ways I work it in, but one that is probably the most important is finding a nice rough paper texture and putting it over the top of the entire piece and changing the layer to ‚Äòmultiply‚Äô. There‚Äôs also things like erasing parts of the art after flattening it to give the impression of it being worn away or folded and the burn and dodge tools to help add more texture :) hope that helps!
---
Some people wait at exit gates to let killers get extra hits. Most of em teabag still tho.
---
Look at the comment section, lmao.
---
People use the shitpost label to make real complaints and use the excuse that "lol it's a shitpost you're not supposed to take it seriously" all the time, Intothepensieve. Shitposts are supposed to be funny :) But again good attempt. Grow a backbone before playing online videogames. Have a good one
---
We should go on strike and not buy the killer if it‚Äôs the case or not play them at all
---
He kills and eats them?
---
Thanks you very much :)
---
I do
---
Couple of reasons:
---
1) It was actually extremely easy to charge since you'd take 2 hits for your first hook, then if you'd be healed you'd take a third hit into Injured state and then ignore the fourth hit into Downed. It was a guaranteed bonus hit unless....
---
2) It promoted toxic Killer play. Survivors can't take that many hits if you just camp them at the hook, and that was much more preferable for 90% of the killers in the roster who couldn't reliably counter MoM.
---
3) Finally, while an extra hit doesn't seem like much, 1 hit, dead hard, second hit, second chase, first hit, dead hard, MoM, second hit on every single survivor is 7 times you have to catch up to every survivor solely for the second hook. Throw in healing, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time, and pre-nerf healing and there was literally nothing you could do to most SWF groups as the majority of the killers.
---
MoM might have been fine as an exhaustion perk, but as it was it was just yet another second chance perk for Survivors, which means the killer had to get 4 more hits every game.
---
Damn. When you put it like that, new DL sounds kind of shit. In an absolute ideal scenario, assuming you focus hooking non-obsession players, the max slowdown you can apply is 18% (6) to 3 people, 21% (7) to 2 people, or 24% (8) to 1 person. And after it's only 2 people remaining, it's almost guaranteed that no further gen progress would occur regardless.
---
On top of that, this is in the ideal scenario that you hook everyone twice with no deaths, ignore the obsession, and still have progress for the survivors (gens, healing, etc) to do so you get value out of high-stacked DL.
---
Contrast this with the old Dying Light, which gave you an entire 25% to all 3 survivors for 3 hook actions. This dying light gives you max 18% to 3 survivors for 6 evenly distributed hook actions.
---
Make Mettle Of Man Great Again
---
Personally, I feel like that's a terrible story. I can't care about that: "Well, we need to keep this thing going" angle. I want to story with a beginning, middle, and end, you know? If her father was added to the trials as a survivor, she would have a reason to keep going forever, and that would be an ending. If she never encounters him, her story is unfinished forever, and that's in my opinion bad writing that tells me I should never start caring.
---
Spirit mains pretending to be survivor mains in order to defend her are by far the funniest thing to see
---
One of the worst ideas I've seen on the sub.
---
1. Queue times will be longer,
---
2. Good as hell players will be able to play with newbies, who just bought the game.
---
We'll need Artemis to double check the translation
---
Just do gens. 
---
If you are the one on the hook, don't kill yourself.
---
First time hitting Rank 1 AND it was a perfect 8000 point game!

Also, they should make doctor pallets work as freddy pallets.
---
Unfun and unfair to go against, people that defend her always use strawman arguments
---
God, I really hope they give bubba, trapper, wraith, pig, doctor, plague, and clown even half of a quarter of a fraction of attention they gave freddy
---
thats kind of romantic tbh
---
That's probably because you're bad and play against even worse killers.
---
I think its a yamaoka map rework.
---
Dont forget the absolute top killer Plague. Because its "unfun" (which seems to be the code for nerf that next since legion) to go against her as you cant cleanse without getting a penalty, so her power has "no counterplay".
---
I want what you have
---
iF yOu GeT dS iT mEaNs YoUrE tUnNeLiNg

I dont know. I wasted a few before I realize it. But healed people in under 2 seconds it felt like lol
---
No, because it's situational and a DLC perk. 
---
It can be very powerful in the right situations especially when paired with Decisive Strike though.
---
*After you cleanse a totem when you enter a locker for 30 seconds you find a bullet*
---
Yeah but it blows that i cant help my teammate. Seems like the person slashed with an saw had their match hijacked. Maybe that is why so many players play toxic back.

I don't know man Ghost face is looking a little to OP...üßê

Team leader at behaviour? Cause Legions leader is Frank, a white dude from Canada. They are all from Canada.
---
10 lines is better than no lines. I think it's cool that he talks in the first place.
---
That's the one. Problem is, once BHVR start swinging the nerfhammer, they don't stop until the original thing is nigh unusable. Legion, Pig, Nurse is now a LOT worse, no matter what everyone else is saying, now  Spirit. They won't just nerf the add-ons, they'll add some ridiculous limitation to the main power and remove the add-on effects. Prayer beads now make you full visible while phasing but you get 25% more hunting points. 
---
I don't know which part of the community they are balancing for, but it's not red or purple ranks.
---
I find red and purple ranks d/c much more often.
---
Plague is just annoying. If your teammates are shit plague can be insanely strong and that's what people mostly dislike about her. Like it's not fun, even unintentionally, to be killed because someone wanted to cleanse. Which other killer has a power that lets survivors fuck each other over?
---
i thought it was gonna be a cute moment with your sibling, that took a dark turn.
---
F
---
i predict surveilance and surge for killer
---
Tehnician and Lithe for survivor
---
Vigil, Left Behind, I‚Äôm All Ears, Make Your Choice
---
That's awesome but empathys kinda scuffed I mean I can't do better but keep it in mind
---
seeing as, in 99% of cases, DS is only proc'd by tunnelling... you're already being an asshole. How people respond to you being an asshole is on you, not them.
---
Wow such skill
---
It let's me practice getting chased and what not, because i'm still trying to learn how to loop. If I can get the attention of the killer easily, that's a good thing, since I want to be chased.
---
Can you still surf the harvester on coldwind maps as I killer?I tried doing that yesterday it pushed me off the hay bale as if there was a wall
---
Yes! That would be so cool. To actually have the same character in the game on both sides... Before - after kinda thing :D
---
BHVR plz
---
lol how bad was the killer?
---
Plunderers, Spine chill, We'll make it and Iron will is what I run on Jake with no other character's teachables, Meg has decent perks at least (not shitting on Iron Will)
---
I just got Adrenaline yesterday, so I concur. :(
---
If 3 hits was to many before activation then make it 5.  It would give you an extra go before being downed for the last time.  The way it is now only works if you are playing 100% altruistic.  So if someone else wants to save/defend then you are tying up 3 people which is an advantage to the killer because they aren‚Äôt doing Gens.
---
Cuz then he'd be unplayable. Imagine the amount of spirits with busted addons and mori who tunnels you and kills you at the start of the game just because you're playing him.
---
He said something you'd be surprised by
---
Welcome to dbd
---
SCP-049
---
Yes it will
---
Yikes..
---
Now I want a mod that plays that every time I get hit with a pallet
---
I think it is just going to be a Spirit / Yamaoka Estate rework. They said they would be reworking Spirit. The devs also said they would be making their way through the maps and reworking them with more medium and low safe loops.
---
the perk is fine now. Before it was no risk high reward. You always end up being hit so you didnt had to do a thing, just play normally and you get the perk activated. Also, since the word "counterplay" is so hyped now on this community, the killer had literally no counterplay against the perk. At least they fixed the perk quickly, contrary to ds which stayed broken for 2 years. Now MoM is high risk high reward and the killer can counterplay it. Balanced.
---
Sure dude, if you want to br mori'd by spirits after 2 min of gameplay every single game as him
---
do the pro-gamer move and use both
---
If they hit you, you had endurance
---
If they wanted to wait it out, you'll heal back up
---
True true.
---
it gets better at higher ranks

As a plague main you want a nerf ?? Now I‚Äôm definitely not saying she needs a buff but she definitely doesn‚Äôt need a nerf either, she‚Äôs perfectly fine as is, lots of survivors just don‚Äôt know how to play well against her and end up paying the consequences. But if they start crying and she gets a nerf imma be :(
---
Ok that actually helps. Thanksüòâ
---
Playing against her is basically like flipping a coin and she isnt very counterable or fun
---
I get you but they can just say that winning a game also has the same effect on the opposing team.
---
Right bumper (R) to pick up survivor
---
(A) to drop survivor
---
Well there are also entries about the Alchemist, the Entity and some other entries but we don't exactly know yet.
---
Nurse is absolutely fine - still the best killer in the game easily
---
I think they‚Äôll keep her base power more or less the same, maybe just remove survivor collision but nothing too drastic
---
For prayer beads it should reduce, but not remove the phasing sound so she can still surprise people working gens but not get free grabs
---
I remember the worst one I had was when I had a truly terrible game as killer, no hooks at all let alone kills. Last gen got done so I said fuck it, parked myself in the basement and then went off to use the toilet and make some food. Came back 15 minutes later and the round was still going! No idea why those idiots were still around, they could've played another round in that time.
---
Only her add ons are gonna get nerfed. Deal with it.
---
just leaving a note that killer doesn't have to 4k when you're the last survivor. the rest might've left you behind
---
I'll take that over being gen-snatched by ultimate stealth Myers or silent phase Spirits. Also can't say I'm a ran of having a jump scare Piggy riding me all of a sudden.
---
As the killer, it's free points for finding, chasing, and/or hitting survivors. As survivors, it's free points for being chased, escaping chase, distraction, and/or healing.
---
Pretty sure the entity had nothing to do with the death of his family
---
AFAIR, in a stream about Archives they said something about focusing on OG characters. So I doubt yesterday's teaser has anything to do with the Archives.
---
Nah, he is fine. His reveal mechanic needs some fixing and his add ons need changes aswell but thats it. Right now he only has his recovery add and all the other ones are pretty much useless
---
Funny thing is, Julies unmasked face looks closer to Jamie‚Äôs face than Laurie.

You can bait Dead Hard, can you bait MoM?
---
As a killer I dodge if I have a bad feeling about survivors im about to go against. Sometimes I don't and later in the match regret it because I was right. Just a feeling. 
---
As a survivor I dodge if I join lobby with a survivor a rank colour lower than my rank is (purple-red). Very often its a newbie and it is a lot more difficult to survive with them because they just do stupid things or nothing at all and die quickly. I dont blame them really, I was there too once , I just prefer not to play with such players. Its not that there arent any noobs in red ranks but green and others are just too obvious.
---
I'm happy that my huntress is considered so low-tier in the meta, it means I don't have to worry about nerfs anytime soon haha
---
With my luck, it'll be Adrenaline or Dead Hard, my literal 2 newest perks
---
I have no idea if suvivors do this to be nice or to be a dick.
---
He was probably in BHVR‚Äôs studio for 15 minutes tops
---
Survivor mains who think you should be able to 1v1 killers is a pretty close second. People on this sub love to pretend that Spirit has no counterplay at all other than IW. 
---
Not even a Spirit main, just not insanely biased towards survivors, unlike many people here.
---
Well, if they let you hit them, technically you get more points, but tea-baggers are still assholes.
---
Teetering on the brink...
---
Catch them t-bagging in the exit gates, "Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer."
---
The presumption is Pennywise will have shapeshifting or other illusionary tricky powers, as the clown form is just his default.
---
Nah, more like 5 minutes
---
Theres a difference between high risk and literally being required to throw the game just to proc it
---
**Better not fucking touch my trapper or imma go Hag and put my traps in the weirdest places while also being good places to catch you**
---
The Ortz hard-on on this sub is rediculous. Look up theentitylefthand, man.

Ummm he brutally murdered his own family he loved over something that was completely unrelated. Psychotic breaks can only justify so much. And the way he murdered his family over his job is not one of them.
---
Upvoted for truth.
---
It is so weird that people are reporting vastly different queue times. On Saturday I queued a game and waited 13 minutes to find a game. I tried to queue another and gave up at the 10 minute mark. I would honestly be fine playing a game with higher rank survivors if it meant I'd get a game faster.
---
People think they should be able to 1v1 killers in a 1v4 game. That‚Äôs about it.
---
Trapper most likely to cry when someone insults him in the after-game chat? Fucking YUP
---

---
oh no

Using a good headset kills any semblance of difficulty when playing as spirit, dont pretend shes hard.
---
You're*
---
I'm a killer main, Spirit has no counterplay, you can't see her glow before the phase, if you have been injured you already lost, the fact people try to say she has mindgames is a lie, mindgames imply that you can outsmart her, you can't unless it's a stupid ass Spirit that can't track people.
---
sometimes i like to mix it up and hit the same guy twice, even if it doesn't do anything. it's just fun to stab.
---
Monitor is gross. Also I think PWYF+Dark Devotion on Leatherface would be horrifying.
---
Playing on wifi lmao
---
If your team sucks, they can give Myers tier 3 when you‚Äôre grouped up. They can give STBFL stacks. They can disarm a trapper trap near the trapper as you do a gen right next to them after the killer just put th at trap down, or worse they can step into it. They can throw a pallet down during the killer‚Äôs pickup animation and not during his carry animation resulting in a wasted pallet, they can throw pallets down at random.
---
A bad team is a bad team because it‚Äôs a bad team is the short answer to why people struggle with basically anything in the game.
---
Freddy who is a child murderer and rapist
---
Azarov best waifu
---
Of course it's sarcasm! Behaviour aren't getting smarter
---
this shit is getting out of hand.
---
Yeah watch all those red or purple rank Spirit onetricks drop back to yellow or green ranks after the nerfs.
---
It's definitely a "win more" perk as I've heard others call it. By the time it starts making a significant difference on it's own, you've practically already won the game, that's why it's main benefit is just stacking it on other slowdowns like Sloppy Butcher and Thanataphobia to essentially just help you snowball mid to late game.
---
Though I personally think if you're able to, purposefully eating a few DS's to switch the obsession around can squeeze a couple extra stacks out for the perk.
---
Yes, her potential. Funny thing, that. See, I do believe I have the potential to be fabulously rich, immensely famous and extremely sexually proficient. But that won't happen. I do agree that the nurse is still potentially a very strong killer, but very few players will be able to realize her potential now.
---
Maybe that's good, maybe it was necessary, i don't have the numbers. But it was a heavy nerf that raised the skill floor a lot.
---
Have you tried her new 3-blink? On a good half of maps it's simply unplayable. And blinking past survivors to make them scream for bloodpoints? Removing her blinks and turning her into a 115% m1? Most of her add-ons are gimmicks or just memes now.
---
1)Doesnt understand the simple fact that ghostfaces power is "optional"becuase his stalk mehcanic is incredibilly hard to make use of so it offers multiple playstyles, so imstead goes on to say that its tied to his movespeed
---
2)changes the subject about 3 times in one comment
---
3)"Reddit bad"
---
4) Unnescesary nurse comment, that is first and foremost false.
---
Yep its all here
---
Nobody asked for a vommy mommy or a group of teen killers but nobody complained when we got them. Its no different here
---
I think they meant original as in their own creation.
---
Spirit is their own creation, but I'm sure the entire first rift is about Claudette and Trapper.
---
There is no counterplay after you've been injured once, unless you happen to use a perk that makes you not bleed and moan, which is unlikely, you are already dead against Spirit, because once they hit the first hit you already lost the chase
---
Teabagging during a DS stun is only valid if the Killer is blatantly hard tunnelling or camping. And even then toxicity just breeds toxicity.
---
if you have to get to jason X territories, this argument is going south
---
Rin gets added as a Survivor and her dad becomes the new Spirit.
---
ez Spirit nerf just remove her from the game kappa
---
I play 80% survivor and really hope they don't touch freddy
---
Bit late to the party.
---
It breaks the momentum of the killer by being active for a minute. Yet survivors love to complain about getting slugged and things not having counter play. Slugging how killers counter play DS.
---
Grabs are borked since servers were implemented anyway, I don't think I've finished a grab since they went live - always locked into an animation, then the survivors run since they reacted before the server processed my grab. Don't even get hit.
---
Why cause they both have a form of katana?
---
I play surviver and killer so, and actually do much better with pig than spirit. But spirit is more fun
---
Man haven't seen this meme in ages.
---
"nerfed to the ground"? I've read the exact same thing about nurse
---
Yeah youtube would keep getting stuck on upload, was recorded like the day after release sorry üôè
---
A new killer with new abilities and add ons
---
Yeaahh... no. 
---
As cool as it sounds that's not happening bud. 
---
We don't even know IF the Alchemist is going to become a playable character, much less if it is going to be the next one.
---
It's just a Katana missing, it makes much more sense that it's Rin's father, that we know actually used one, than a guy who by injecting serum now becomes omnipotent.
---
Or make protection hits actually work. Or make it get a stack on safe unhooks, like we asked for from the start, BEFORE they nerfed it.
---
They had yellow ones too! They only use the green ones now lol
---
I do this. 
---
I come from OW where tbagging is kind of a funny joke rather than a personal offense. I think it adds fun to the game, I take it lightly when a killer keeps M1ing me on the hook too. It‚Äôs fun. 
---
I‚Äôve honestly never seen such a deeply sensitive community. Other game communities tend to have much thicker skins and I don‚Äôt know what it is about DbD that makes people really sensitive to stuff considered normal and funny in other games.
---
Hi nrkdingbat
---
I mean if any thing rin should've been a survivor but her dad is an actual killer so it would make since for him to be one
---
Congrats on losing me to the literal dozens of directions I can now run while you take forever to set a trap. And do you really think that trap is going to stay up at a MAJOR loop like this? One of the other three is eating it, or tripping it 100% of the time. You're not getting much out of this, or you're playing with literal idiots.
---
First of all, its not confirmed if her father is the killer, a rework makes much more sense.
---
Second of all, wtf is that supposed to mean? 80 percent of killers are horrible people, Ribs father was an overworked man who was being corrupted by the entity and then lost his job, if you know anything about Japanese work culture you'll now that's the worst thing that can happen. He then snapped and killed his family, what he did was awful but compared to people who enjoy torture like The Doctor or The Trapper, even before the entity took an interest in them, he is one of the more understandable characters in regards to their actions
---
Would be nice if we don't get a killer that has multiple personality disorder because it contributes to the stigma that people that actually have multiple personality disorder are psychotic lunatics who could snap at any moment when in reality a lot of them are just kinda depressed and need help.
---
Most of her add ons are terrible yes but her base power is incredibly strong and buffing how that power works with add ons would bring her right back into the broken state her add ons might be memes but they offer different playstyles for a very good base power and no one is forcing you to run add ons if you dont want to play with them
---
Devotion 10, like level 15.
---
&gt; *Monitor is gross.*
---
It's *exceptionally* naughty with Play with Your Food *and* Bubba because it leaves survivors very little time to react to the instasaw.
---
Doesn't matter how loud the idle saw is, most players are making their decisions based on the heartbeat, and that's why this works.
---
The thing I hate the most is people who wait at the hatch and hold the whole game hostage when they can just end the game. ‚ÄúHaha killer you see I found the hatch. I ‚Äúoutplayed‚Äù you. Even though I was the last remaining survivor. XD baby killer‚Äù bruh just leave lmao
---
I had a game yesterday where 2 people instantly dced, against a spirit who camped when they hooked the other person. It‚Äôs bad :p
---
I see you're man of culture as well.
---
I'm sure dictionaries help you with your usual trivial vocabulary squabbles, but the Oxford dictionary isn't exactly an authority when it comes to linguistic terminology.
---
"Homonym" literally means "same name" and, in linguistics, usually strictly refers to words that have the exact same spelling and pronunciation. Words that just sound the same but are spelt differently are homophones. Words that are spelt the same way but are pronounced differently are homographs. So homonyms are both homophones and homographs at the same time. Otherwise we don't really need the term, do we?
---
I know it's Wikipedia, but [these tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homonym#Related_terms) are quite handy in distinguishing between different terms.
---
Have you tried using your eyes and ears to locate the killer? Works 100% of the time, no need to run these perks :)
---
I still like the red one if you run the killer around at a pallet or some windows it‚Äôs not to hard for it to pop
---
Survivors: *Do all the gens on one side of the map when I have Pop Goes.*
---
Also Survivors: REEEEEEEEEEEE TRYHARD KILLER BHVR PLZ NERF SO KILLER-SIDED
---
Part of the reason I run Pop Goes on so many of my Killers is because it makes 3-gen strats brain-dead easy. Surveillance is nice for the same reason.
---
~~Off topic the only time I've ever been called out for "gen camping" is when I run Surveillance. Man if only you could check the Killer's perks after the match to see why they played the way they did...~~
---
Didn't ScottJund make a response to this video basically disproving every point Tru3 made?
---
"Use your brain." AKA play a dumb killer. Almost every loop on that map is easy to double back, and some of them are even bad when it comes to just dropping and running, as they're not curved enough to offer a game of cat and mouse, and the killer loses next to no time taking the stun and going around.
---
I had a game yesterday where two people instantly dced. my other teammate got hooked and the killer turned out to be a camping spirit who apparently ignored my dead hard bc I got exhaustion but still went down. this game is perfect I swear lol.
---
Yes that one
---
I personally would love the idea, having 2 different killers from the same lore who are also original characters. Also idk why I would hate it just because he killed Rin, have you seen all the messed up shit the majority of the killer cast has done?
---
It would make sense too, since the Entity originally wanted to make him the killer, but took Rin instead due to her lust for vengeance.
---
I just wonder how he would work power-wise, he could be like a damned soul regretting what he did to his family or maybe just went the extra mile and snapped permanently and the power could incorporate one or both of those feelings.
---
SO unprofessional.
---
This is what happens when young actors get involved in drugs and alcohol.
---
Poor girl...
---
People who were around back then will still have the Brown and Yellow addons. They can still be used (unlike the moon offerings) but their effects are very weak.
---
To put it into perspective the green map offerings are coded as a 9999 increase to a given map. I presume that was just some intern being lazy and changing one line of code, but still when you consider that the brown and yellow addons are a 2 and 5 increase respectively?
---
Or maybe you're just an asshole.
---
I like how both turned out, the Purple one is for stalling chases and the red one is for pure efficiency
---
Hahah
---
Pretty sure her add ons are being touched after doctor, but I don‚Äôt remember where I saw that.
---
Had a Nea Tbag at the exit.
---
Managed to down her with a hatched before she could leave. Most satisfying thing I've ever done in the game.

So you agree a change is needed?

The Stridor icon is definitely my favourite, but every one of them looks amazing! Great job!
---
Thank you)
---
Idk I've just never gone against a Spirit that was much of a problem, so thats why I don't find her difficult. Also I'm Rank 8 with both because I die/fail a lot going for Adaptive Achievements.
---
And? The game is about killers and he is a killer
---
Yo they just running out of ideas I'd they make the killer her father
---
Does it actually work like that now? I'll have to try it!
---
The killer can now close the exit gates. Any survivors still in the trial are immediately sacrificed.
---
I'm gonna do what is called a big brain move. Elitism at its finest.
---
Not everyone wants to be a big-brained bigot.
---
Cheaters are going to use the filters to more easily see scratch marks. (Sorry about the confusion earlier you made it sound like you were going to change the base game graphics).
---
Also can you stop trying to be passive aggressive towards me? Sorry if I got on your bad side dude... just was putting up food for thought and you seem to be taking personal offence to it. I never meant this to annoy you :(
---
Shattered bloodline gives spirit, who‚Äôs one of the best killers rn imo. She‚Äôs nurse but more forgiving if you know how to play her.
---
Stronk*
---
Lol would be the funniest shit
---
I just mean that the reply is so ridiculous, you can't be serious...
---
*sad chainsaw noises*
---
I wouldn't mind that, actually!
---
Pretty sure you can place traps where they hop off since the hop off spot is farther away than a survivor attempting to unhook you is, so yeah.
---
The survivors are
---
I can always stop mid animation because I know you‚Äôll get outta dodge the moment you see me bend over and wouldn‚Äôt bother watching me. This works literally every time I do it, then again I rarely have to since I never end up in infinites.
---
*Yes, FBI?*
---
Are there red offerings for spirit? I mean the ones that allow you to play a certain killer.(I'm one of those people who buys DLC on the spot I'm a bit too addicted, so I've never actually seen one)
---
They could make those appear way more frequently if they do something like this. Unless they decide to do "Kill a survivor with rancor as spirit",  but if they just stay with post-phase stuff and other ability missions it could work
---
Yeah he‚Äôs bad, but have you tried Expert Moon Lord? He‚Äôs a goddamn nightmare to deal with.
---
*CRITICAL HIT*
---
Who‚Äôs that?
---
Part of me was thinking of that after I posted it, probably why BHVR didn't go with that approach?
---
Get those STBFL stacks
---
Everybody knows that if you DC before you get sacrificed means you won the game, moried the killer and got laid.
---
Now give me a generator fixing  Adiris. Imagine a tall ass  pre-islamic Iraqi woman dealing with new technology
---
licencing issue. For some reason they cant release it on new editions of the game.
---
I‚Äôm sure Danny has a whole collection of photos of survivors and other killers that he looks at when he‚Äôs not stalking around and murdering people in matches.
---
He should make a scrapbook.
---
Oh shit
---
Legion definitely isn't terrible even if they're (at least I'd say) the 3rd worst killer in the game. Feral frenzy is useful for getting the first 1-4 hits on the survivors, but since it cannot down them it basically has no use in a chase. Legion starts strong but ends weak, which is fine if you can stall the survivors enough to kill some of them in the early game.
---
we actually do know, its been on live for 3 weeks and its been datamined for that long too lmao.
---
Right
---
How about a new scoring event something for last to die but it is your first hook...
---
Call it what you want maybe "last man standing"
---
"Tough to kill" and make it give 1k points maybe.
---
And then maybe if it is your second hook but last to die 500 BP
---
I mean literally every other killer change announcement is a buff. The only foreseeable thing's I can see them nerfing is Hillbilly's insta-saw and the nerf will most likely just be increasing it's rarity. and other than that, they are looking to buff Doctor, Bubba, and Legion. Not to mention Demogorgon was buffed after launch, or in general how good of a place several killers are in right now.
---
Despite what crybabies will tell you, the game isn't "pick Nurse or Billy or lose" anymore like it was years ago. Like killers are literally in such a good spot in general, and are being made better; they are slowly getting add-on reworks, maps are starting to be made fairer, albeit slowly problem loops are being looked at, the stronger survivor tools are getting nerfed, etc. Like how can you continue to have this victim mentality when changes are happening for better balance on BOTH sides.
---
It would be nothing special if you would be devotion 10pr something. But for a starter its pretty impressive!
---
#2edgy5me cal police plz
---
Pulling from existing lore material is not a lack of creativity, if anything it enhances existing lore. This really can only work in Spirit‚Äôs case cause she wasn‚Äôt the Entity‚Äôs first choice. It only lacks creativity if it isn‚Äôt inspired by anything exciting. 
---
The only way your stance makes sense to me is if they pulled a really convoluted killer idea from another killer, like the first person who The Doctor tortured and killed or something random like the guy who Wraith crushed in one of the cars he worked in, like that‚Äôs boring and uninspired. 
---
Ron‚Äôs dad, homocidial samurai sword swinging maniac? I‚Äôm here for that shit.
---
Well yes in a way it's their responsibility if people are asking for it especially going to ask Jamie Lee Curtis herself.
---
Yet behaviour doesn't feel like going for it there's not really much they could do if Jamie Lee Curtis is interested, reaching out to behaviour is probably the best option
---
I play both sides, and I have to say that when I had my first game with a level 1 spirit at purple ranks, it was easier than any killer I usually play by a mile.
---
To the point it was boring.
---
Okay sounds great but sumrai sword swinging maniac just sounds like a male spirit to me
---
Inb4 pile of guts and bone with a katana sticking out of it.
---
A few Hours ago I was in a match and 3 survivors quit but 1 person who stayed I downed him and placed him next to the hatch. sent me a thank you in my inbox made me feel all good inside my dark Freddy heart :))
---
they still need to fix protection hits though. i've gotten protection points for being hit across the map from another survivor. it's buggy and inconsistent.
---
I've only seen Michael shards, Freddy shards, and Bubba shards. Idk if there is a spirit shard
---
That only punishes the people who didn‚Äôt disconnect you idiot. The actual culprit gets away scottfree.
---
tfw you disparage the literal dictionary definition but link Wikipedia as your source lmao
---
Pretty sure they said that they want to go over all the killers who don't got the 'standard' format for add-ons meaning 2 red 4 purple etc. That doesn't necessarily mean a Nerf but it will probably mean iri head will be reworked which I think most huntress players wouldn't mind
---
Huntress aint low tier cuz even tho she doesn't have map pressure she has several good things
---

---
You can clearly tell they were joking
---
That was my joke earlier. I'm surprised people are still replying to this a day later. I'm not gonna take the time to reply to them all now anyways but it seems my one reply made a long ass chain.
---
Wasn't that shadownerfed? I've used that combo myself for memes long time ago in a No Mither build.
---
I mean this with no malice or in a snide manner.  I was under the impression that the Oxford dictionary was considered the "higher" dictionary.  What would you say is the authority on linguistic terminology?
---
The problem is that spirit is too easy to play and also lacks any real counterplay.
---
Old enough to play Halo: CE and not whine about teabagging
---
Really? Is that why top level players pick mostly Spirit, Nurse and Billy? Or are we all just imagining that Bhvr is forcing a tier list?
---
okay boomer
---
ü§°
---
I don't know why everybody loves dead hard so much. I'm not a very good killer and it has never once prevented me from catching a survivor who has used it. Just extends the chase a few more seconds.
---
I think its still working , vaults are pretty fast with both
---
What if it's Mrs. Yamaoka that's the new killer because she also wants revenge on her husband? Then Mr. Yamaoka could be a survivor.
---
You forgot Noed. Whether it‚Äôs even used or not. You will get shit for it. Every time.
---
Ain‚Äôt my fault I run distressing 3 with doc, -and maybe restraint-
---
She has no counterplay, you are injured ¬∞ you loet, simple as that.
---
I get where you coming from,but more of a ghost themed killer if you know what I mean.
---
I would say spirit but she about to get nerfed
---
I always knew she was like this. I think people were busy complaining about Legion and Mettle of Man first
---
Meme made with google translate ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è

Why didn't you just target the unhooker?
---
BM‚Äôing bad, positivity good
---
Premonition tells you if he‚Äôs there. Spine chill tells you if he‚Äôs there and if he‚Äôs coming for you. If it lights up for a millisecond he might have just turned and faced you. If it stays lit up, he‚Äôs hunting you
---
All 4 cinematics are leaked.
---
Final one is presuambly the alchemist injecting himself with the serum and walking into the field. Its supposed to come out mid december, which is when the ptb should be released around so people expected it to be the alchemist.
---
Can you imagine the unmitigated outpouring of salt if this were an ultrarare offering?
---
&gt;One survivor chosen at random begins the trial on a random non-basement hook
---
I would pay to see the amount of whines and disconnects that would cause.
---
Dude you got talent!
---
i love these memes
---
Please tell me more about your green rank experience cutie.
---
when survivor, when my ping is baaad
---
when killer: when more than 2 people have bad ping. I don't dodge if only one person have bad ping. Too bad many people don't understand it should be surv dropping the lobby where they are the only person with bad ping. I got so many hate messages about my internet from people who got, like 700+ ping in my lobby, while all the others got green ping.
---
Also, when I try to do dailies on killer I don't know how to play, AND I see fully equipped swf-looking team that will give me hard time and I probably won't be able to do the daily. I also dodge those fully equipped teams if I feel I don't have enough energy to deal with them if they end up being toxic
---
The fact nurse has visible counter play says so
---
She must have no boobs... it says dat the backstory
---
A friend told me it does

I haven‚Äôt checked myself tho

Check the shrine of secrets in the store every week. It always has 4 teachable perks that you can buy with iridescent shards. Some really good ones have been showing up lately.
---
I just want Object of Obsession and Make Your Choice...

I‚Äôm guessing the guy who obsessed over the entity‚Äôs serum took it in an attempt to please the entity by becoming a killer, so it gives him more serum as a reward.

There's a chart down a bit.

Before, there used to be common and uncommon map offerings, but they removed them like 2 years ago so yeah it‚Äôs super old, but still use able
---
When are the servers being fixed or removed? every time I get a Ghostface out of stealth he's behind a wall
---
It‚Äôs really rich when he says spirit has always been a problem when in his legion video he calls her his favorite killer to play as. It‚Äôs a new narrative but people acting like it‚Äôs always been this way. Prayer beads, yes. But every other complaint is recent. How long before it‚Äôs the Coxcombed Clapper that‚Äôs OP?
---
Reminds me of when Monto and a bunch of others called spirit not very good after her post-launch adjustments and everyone ate that shit up without a second thought.
---
Nah, stop replying.
---
I get accused of "gen camping" a lot as Freddy. Man it's almost like he has an ability to teleport to a generator.
---
All the walls make the Hospital map very popular for Scratched Mirror Myers using Monitor and Abuse. This leaves Meyers in T1 EW all game, but with 0 terror radius and the ability to see survivors through the walls (of which there are many) and sneak up on them for a sort of "Jump scare" effect.
---
I have a bunch of old offerings like these but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever use them just cause I‚Äôm a an offering hoarder
---
They should buff lower killers first.
---
Yeah but survivors get really upset at the killer when they get downed right after they‚Äôve been unhooked. Even though it‚Äôs technically the person who unhooked them who should be at blame.
---
You gain iridescent shards for leveling up your DBD account and there isn't a limit for this, your level just resets when you hit 100 and you gain a devotion level each time you do so. Therefore your rate of gaining iri shards is just based on how efficiently you gain your exp. There isn't a whole lot to this, you shouldn't stress about it, just play normally, but PainReliever has a video about exactly this topic on youtube. (to sum it up, you get an XP bonus for your first game each day, and your games shouldn't last more than 10 minutes).
---
The shrine of secrets features 2 teachable killer and 2 survivor perks each week (changing on wednesdays). Buying a teachable perk will allow that perk to appear in any character's bloodweb in that role (for example, if you buy balanced landing in the shrine, that perk can now potentially appear in any survivor's bloodweb for you). So it's essentially the same as leveling up a specific character to level 30/35/40 to unlock their own teachables. I recommend that you unlock the perks of characters in the shrine that are behind paywalls (every licensed character) and you dont intend on ever buying them

If ever you need evidence this sub is ran by children...

The longer he chases someone the faster he gets in all actions up to 50% faster, but it drains over time outside of chases. That‚Äôs all I got.
---
Well, the syringe still as powerful as before. It's just how you use it is different now. Yes, it's nerfed from being able to heal from 2 state to 1, but it's still useful when you're looping a killer, drop pallet then use syringe, and continue to loop for a bit longer until the heal comes to effect. Any decent survivors should be able to do it. Hopefully

I tried replacing mine in some games. Got a 1 hook bc no spine chill and nobody came

Sitting on 3 gens close to each-other stops those gens from being done which stops the gates from being powered.
---
Like it or hate it 3 gen strats are a valid strategy. Boring for both sides perhaps, but it works.
---
If Survivors are allowed to run the same goddamn infinites every time I chase them I'm allowed to protect the same 3 fucking gens every match.
---
I did. The unhooker had mettle too.
---
Yes, maybe some more people would play the weaker killers if they got buffed
---
Oh well that‚Äôs not my problem that he got unhooked once I turned my back
---
Facts.
---
They're amazing
---
Yeah Nea‚Äôs the entity not a killer or a survivor you would never see it coming
---
I mean it's a strat. A boring strat I agree, but a strat.
---
That being said most of the time when I three-gen it's because I chased a Survivor around one area and no one wanted to do gens in my Terror Radius. Then the last 3 gens are in an area with no pallets and the Survivors QQ about OP Killers.
---
Toxic survivors you just gotta ignore them, if they unhooked when you were still around it's their fault. Doesn't make you a bad guy for playing the game correctly, just don't camp and you're fine.
---
That would lead to complaining that it‚Äôs too hard of a game. I play as both sides and have no issue with any killer unless they have bad internet
---
What killer?
---
Who‚Äôs sug-on?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvawew/anybody_have_any_idea_when_the_2nd_tome_of_the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
they are the BEST options, I'll agree, but that doesn't mean every other killer is an auto-lose against the average team. Personally the only killers I see that can be guaranteed losses against decent survivors are Bubba, Doctor, Wraith, Trapper, and Legion, even then with the best add-ons and great perks even they can edge out several kills (inb4 add-ons don't count!) and 2 of those killers i play religiously, but I am agreeing that those 5 need to be looked at, *cough* 3 of them are *cough*. Probably not even them directly, a lot of the time they lose due to map design, which is being looked at. The other issues of the game are being looked at as well, infinite loops, map design in general, insta-heals just got reworked, etc.
---
Like do you honestly ignore the good Huntresses out there? How good Freddy is overall now? How good Michael and Ghostface are as stealth killers? The map pressure good Hag's can cause? Sure Pig, Plague, and Clown are on the median line but they aren't really awful like some people claim and all these mentioned killers can literally insta-win games with all their strongest builds.
---
Super slow Freddy literally makes "gen rushing" non-existent, Iri heads still exist with Huntress let alone even having good accuracy with her is enough to wipe teams, Ghostface can keep everyone on edge if played well, Michael's T3 lunge is enough to play around the strongest loops same with Demogorgons lunge, Hag can lock-down entire areas of the map and god forbid she gets someone in the basement, Plague's UR add-ons basically guarantee a win and her apples guarantee corrupt and if someone decides to cleanse you basically win right there, Pig has decent game slow down and anti loop potential with her issue being that her power is RNG, Clown has anti-loop too and granted it's all he has he can still snowball pretty well especially with his more annoying add-ons.
---
Like do we want to pretend all I mentioned doesn't exist and all those killers just get endlessly looped around a TL wall while 5 gens pop in 20 seconds because the average killer is just a boosted ape? Or can we acknowledge that a lot of the killers are viable if used well, because I've definitely seen some monster plays from all of the killers. Just because it isn't easy to instant 4k with them like the 2-3 top tier killers doesn't make them not good.
---
Sounds like they were just looking for an excuse to farm blood points. One could argue you tunneled that Survivor and should have tried to kill the person doing the unhooking but since you're new you just played it how you thought you should have played it and there's no issue with that in my opinion.
---
Thanks)
---
So what sounds like happened is you "tunneled." Which is a term survivors throw at you for going after the same person right off the hook. They use this as an insult and to call you trash when in reality they got farmed by their team and you made the optimal play for yourself.
---
Ok like I‚Äôm obviously gonna hit the guy who‚Äôs a one hit down rather then chase but I see the anger now
---
Yes, it helps a lot thank you for the information. I am very new at this and I'm enjoying playing as Meg but I wished I had access to self-healing since I'm a solo player. The game doesn't explain a lot of things at the start and since it's an older game not a lot of people are asking these more baby dweet type of questions.
---
Rank doesn‚Äôt matter, all it does is say ‚Äúyou go against better players or rookies‚Äù via how low the number is. Rank 1 is the biggest of bois and 20 is the newest of the new.
---
I just had a stroke
---
I also play both sides, and I agree that it‚Äôd lead to complaining but the game isn‚Äôt supposed to be easy for survivors, the killer is supposed to have the upper hand, and some of them in their current state don‚Äôt
---
I don't think the problem is consistency, the problem with the old MoM was that you didn't need to go out of your way to activate it. What the perk needs is a time consuming and inconvenient activation condition which could be safe unhooks maybe.
---
Iron Maiden, Cruel Confinement‚Äôs (Demogorgon one), Flip flop, and Boil Over
---
Auto was a bitch while I was writing this
---
I agree with you here, feel like you should be given any escape attempts, but instead maybe like 1k bp or something as a consolation prize
---
Nurse is harder to play but she's absolutely top tier.
---
do you mean my match or his vid with the ads?
---
Ok thank you for the info. It's somewhat confusing at the start of the game and I was unsure on what I should spend shards on. But on topic, what is a Devotion Level? Is it like a prestige level? Do you gain anything?
---
i bought him after the nerf, knowing that all his perks are trash, just because im horny for bruce campbell.... and then even more money getting his skins üò©
---
maybe her father will be a new survivor. Then she can get that sweet sweet katana revenge
---
Oh I was gonna say the match
---
Oh thanks for explaining!
---
I really don't think it's the perks that are the problem. It's the people using them most of the time. But, It's hard to argue with perks like object and insidious that just promote the said "toxic" parts of the game. object only further helps swf groups which already having comms provides an advantage in a 4v1. Insidious only promotes camping, there's literally no other use than to hide near a hooked survivor hoping to catch other survivors going for saves. Meanwhile you have ds to try and stop tunneling and bbq to promote going after other survivors to get more tokens. It's really a thing bhvr has been struggling to combat. They either keeps certain things like they and hear people complain about the state of the game that's not tailored to 1 side . or they make rapid changes to and end up disappointing almost everybody because they can't play how they want to play.
---
You're the type of person to run into a bear trap after you watched me put it down in front of you. I explicitly said "I know it's Wikipedia" - I linked the tables to visualise, not to prove my point. Feel free to check any Linguistics 101 books if you need a source for my claims. There's a ton of plebs who can't grasp that homonyms and homophones are (and should be) different concepts, but anyone who has a remote idea of linguistics will tell you there's a reason we draw that line - because otherwise, we needlessly diffuse two clearly defined terms. Just because many do it doesn't make it right or sensible.
---
Being so adamant about dictionary definitions is beyond silly when it comes to advanced concepts. They frequently simplify things and that leads to people (like OP) extrapolating from lacking information and arriving at a false conclusion. Here's a few more appropriate sources, including some linguistic glossaries:
---
"homonym: Any set of words which share their form but have different meanings, e.g. bar 'legal profession' and bar 'public house'. The formal similarity is an accident of phonological development and the forms do not share a common historical root, contrast this situation with that of polysemy." - https://www.uni-due.de/ELE/LinguisticGlossary.html
---
"homonym: Two words which are identical in speech and writing." - https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%253A978-1-349-22869-0%252F1.pdf
---
"First, for a little linguistics 101, a homonym is a group of words that are spelled the same and sound the same, but have different meanings:" - https://www.lexalytics.com/lexablog/salience-and-homonyms-differentiating-between-identical-words
---
"The word Homonymy (from the Greek‚Äîhomos: same, onoma: name) is the relation between words with identical forms but different meanings‚Äîthat is, the condition of being homonyms." - (https://www.thoughtco.com/homonymy-words-and-meanings-1690839)
---
Also a dictionary definition, just so we're even:
---
"a word that is spelled the same and sounds the same as another, but is different in meaning or origin." - https://www.ldoceonline.com/Linguistics-topic/homonym
---
Anyway, there's plenty more, feel free to check.
---
Anything about the killer meta vastly change since the Clown released? That was around the last time I've played.
---
Can you validate the skill level of the Spirits in those videos? No. 
---
In any case, look at what he has doing in the videos. Was he reacting, or guessing?
---
Could he tell when spirit was using her power and what direction she was going, or was he guessing?
---
How about pointing to a specific video and a time in that video which he outplayed the Spirit. Then assess as to if it was a good guess or if he was actually reacting to something Spirit did.
---
Don't worry! I started off as a baby Dweet as well and I felt so lost. But after some time you get more and more used to the game and things will feel more natural. There's no shame in asking questions like this.
---
If you want self-healing, you should unlock the teachable by Claudette called ''Self-Care'' at level 40. Once you have it unlocked, it will start appearing in Meg's bloodweb as well and then Meg has the ability to self-heal. Alternatively, you can try running ''Bond'' by Dwight instead (it highlights auras of your teammates so you can find them and let them heal you) or use a medkit instead.
---
The game looks much better on a wide screen phone like an S8...not sure what OP is playing it on, a Moto RAZR?
---
The game play is great, but you need some kind of controller... The on screen controls suck if youre using your thumb to rotate the camera you can't see any of the other buttons.
---
yeah it‚Äôs not up and I doubt he‚Äôll post it. can‚Äôt look bad to his 3 subs lol
---
Yeah it's just a prestige level as other games refer to it, and no it doesn't give you anything, just prevents veteran players having ridiculously high numbers for their level i guess lol
---
Me, minding my own business and playing Clown despite him being low tier: 
---
Some P3 Meg from across a field of nerfed killer corpses: NO LIKE RUN SLOW! FIX NOW!
---
Yeah. He just stopped for a sel√ßie
---
Starting with 80%? OP please nurf
---
I really respect Survivors who can complement me on good gameplay. It makes me feel good that I did well enough for my opponent to commend me on it. I often get comments about good gen pressure when I play Freddy which makes me happy.
---
On the other hand I often get comments about me being a "toxic tryhard" or that I'm "abusing an OP no-skill character"... there's a reason I own r/entitledsurvivors

Oh my god yes. I brought in a red map with the ward, and I lost both. Luckily I had more than 1 of each

These are literally perfect I can‚Äôt find one with an error

I love how the comment 'play for fun' can get down voted. Well in that case take the truth instead. You are bad. You're concentrating soooo hard on being good that you're not having any fun at all, but in your own narrow mind it couldn't possibly be your own failings.... no it has to be those damn SWFs. Each of them are trash, nothing compared to your AMAZING SKILLZ but together it's such a difference that you can't even hit them. Woe is you. 
---
Quit the game, go minecraft. Or does that cause you to too much stress too?
---
GF is the king. Imagine him stabbing you like that and just before you fade out you realize he is taking a picture of you. I would come back as the next Spirt if I died like that.
---
Here I was thinking about seeing a guy with Level MXVI like Payday 2
---
On the hallowed blight skin Spirits leg shards will glow when she‚Äôs phasing
---
I run double crouch speed addons as Ghostface just to tbag in chases it‚Äôs not really toxic just fun and many survivors find it hilarious.
---
so both of them no longer use up the med-kit
---
Is healing not classed as altruism?
---
I would say a mix of both, mainly fun and viable, but some op perks (as bhvr always has some)  I‚Äôd say 6 viable to 1 op perk

---
I don‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs strong or ‚Äúmeta.‚Äù Spirit is just bad for the game‚Äôs health. When you play spirit you might as well be playing a single player game against bots programmed to do something random. Spirit is not a reactionary killer, leaving skill out of the equation for survivors. You just guess and hope that you get that really small chance of getting lucky. Nurse is much stronger than spirit, but she is less of a problem, because the strength of the killer is not what is important here. Spirit is not op, she is just bad for the game‚Äôs health.
---
I've been in 3-gens countless times when playing solo or in a 2-man SWF, but as long as all 4 Survivors are alive it's not too hard to get the last gen done. You just need to split your focus and keep the Killer distracted while not making it obvious.
---
Problem is that a lot of Survivors are too scared of going down to buy their teammates those last few precious seconds. They get hit and run across the map to where all the pallets are in order to Self Care. And if the Killer has half a braincell they're not going to go 3 miles away from the gens just for one down.
---
3-genning is your fault, and not getting through a 3-gen is also your fault. Crying about it in post-game chat just proves that you're too much of a neanderthal to realize that the person who burnt your hand is the same person who put it on the stove.
---
Then they will bitch about someone else
---
Like they did asking for Billy 110%ms because is too easy just before legion launch
---
No, I'm the one who uses stealth to evade the killer while getting generators done because I rarely escape them. Seriously, I've been able to get gold, sometimes iridescent lightbringer without getting chased. I don't even have urban evasion. That, and being able to know where the killer is, even if you can't see them is always good.
---
There's alot of Perks in this game and I'm sure there's tons of fun builds. Obviously being part of this Subreddit I've seen people talk about DS, BBQ and Chilli and all the meta perks. But if possible I'd like to make my own way without relying on "crutch" perks I guess I'd call them. Spine Chill is a favorite of mine, Piggy and Michael and Ghost face can't stalk if I know they are watching me. I'm having tons of fun honestly and can't wait to get back to playing it.
---
There's no such thing as gen rushing; just gens being done too fast.
---
Likewise there's no such thing as gen camping; just 3-gen strats being easy to do.

what is the point of this game?
---
In my head his mori is he grabs them by the legs, lifts them up by the feet and lowers their head first onto an armed trap. They struggle a bit to not put their head on it, but are eventually overpowered.
---
I really hope they rework it. The ol' stomp and chop is a little limp.
---
I will look at Tru‚Äôs response later it is fairly long. 
---
You are not fully understanding Scott‚Äôs responses in regards to how Tru presented them. 
---
I used to subscribe to Tru, but I found he was not as good as he shows in his YouTube videos. I am not saying he is a bad player, just that he is very selective about what he presents on YouTube. Plus he gets really annoying. 
---
As to the 30 second chases, that is with a VERY skilled, 7,000+ hour survivor and the entire chase, from fully healed to laying on the ground is 30 seconds ds on average. Think about that. That is about 15 seconds per hit. That is the amount of time for a 115 M1 killer to just walk at a survivor sprinting away in a straight line without any loops or power usage or anything. That is not OK
---
Called it

BHVR needs her anyway just to spite you
---
Spine chill is a really good perk
---
And Texas is the place i'd really love to be
---
&gt; it mostly activated in the end-game
---
This is what irked me the most, Due to the very nature of the perks activation requirements 80-90% of it's activations and uses where in endgame. A time that the killer cannot afford to be delayed, in some circumstances when multiple people used it it was essentially a free win perk.
---
I like the idea of using the shotgun trap from Jigsaw. She ‚ÄúAccidentally‚Äù loses her grip on it and the survivor grabs it, tries to shoot her and it backfires, killing them
---
Killers gotta kill, It‚Äôs just simple as that, just gotta move on to the next match. Sure, it‚Äôs no fun getting a mori after a hook and less than 5 minutes of the game. It‚Äôs still not gonna change the mentality of said player who does this, if it‚Äôs in the game, then it‚Äôs gonna happen quite often.
---
BUT ALLLL MY EXES LIVE IN TEXAAAAS
---
If he wants a 3 gen he's not really winning. And even if they do win you may as well just constantly get hit and run away to Self Care and farm Bloodpoints.
---
If they want the match to last 4 hours at least you can get max Bloodpoints before killing yourself.
---
Eh let him die.. that will spawn the hatch and i can pick the key and help those idiots escape who 3 genned us.
---
Greater Good and something like that.
---
The point of view is tunneling what do you you mean on whatever it may be? You can disagree . And I do understand about d strike and borrowed I‚Äôm aware just a point it view some people play fair some people don‚Äôt if your offended idk what to tell you
---
The last killer was really nothing other than a flower. I wouldn't be surprised if the next killer is just a sword like Exor in Super Mario RPG.
---
i tried to use it once last week and twice it granted me protection hit bloodpoint events but not mettle stacks, such a useless perk, just like all of his perks

You can't claim the Syringe as being "still as powerful as before".  It got nerfed from 2 health states to 1.  It went from triggering instantly to taking 16 seconds.  It quite obviously isn't as powerful as before.
---
I'm hoping it's genji
---
How is purple better? It wears off before you even get hit. I used it when in the middle of a chase just to have the killer immediately leave me and my medkit was wasted. The pink one on the other hand i have used mid chase and it healed me, have used it right off a hook and got on a gen, have used it right off a hook when I was tunneled and got a full heal. Purple is definitely not better

Then, they came for my Shirtless Myers, and there was no one left to speak for me.

Reasons why I don't prestige my Claudette, she got a bunch of these plus full moon offerings
---
Nurse wasn't going to get super nerfed because they knew what would happen if they did for someone that iconic be nerfed that much
---
The rest of the cast? Not so much
---
Lmao prayer beads are broken as shit man, they won't make the nerf that ridiculous but they deffo need to do something with them.
---
I'm aware. Just being optimistic
---
I'm already sick of seeing these characters...
---
Yup, you might be sarcastic but some people aren't
---
It's so annoying, TBH.
---
People just want the other side to follow their imaginary made up rules without realizing that those rules basically read "don't have fun so I can have more fun." Different people define fun in different ways but humans universally want to win. If a Killer takes a "boring" or "annoying" strategy to win then it's still in their right to do so; it's in the game so it's allowed. Camping (hooks or gens), tunnelling, abusing overpowered addons and perks: they're in the game they're meant to be used. There's no made-up rules about how you shouldn't use something built into the game.
---
If there's anyone you should complain to it's Behaviour for allowing these annoying tactics. But the players shouldn't compensate for the developers' bad game design. Our only job is to play the game, not to fix it because the devs can't.
---
And yelling at players for using a mechanic doesn't solve anything. "Oh you don't like how I'm playing? Okay let me just intentionally hamper myself so random person I'll probably never meet again can be happy."
---
Freddy is next
---
I just count to 8 seconds when i see the med kit disappear and then hit them, and it wastes both.  They really shouldn't make that addon consume the medkit anymore
---
You must be new if you think **this** nurse nerf is significant. The original nurse had 115% move speed and base 3 blinks. Guess what, she was still the best killer in the game. Don't overreact to balancing changes.
---
No, who makes you the judge of him
---
Only seen (as) huntress nurse and (against) Michaels tombstone in game , by far the best in my opinion is nurse it‚Äôs just so disturbing it‚Äôs awesome. Michaels is intense tho. I rarely play legion as or against so I don‚Äôt know how it applies in game but it‚Äôs a cool kill none the less.

I think Nurse is definitely also in the high tier.
---
More like people say Legion in general is bad.
---
Yeah choosing to play Killer or Survivor is hard...
---
...or you can just play Nea.
---
Obnoxious Forever Freddys. Not the fun, normal Freddys from the first few weeks after his rework
---
On one hand this would be really great because at this point, survivors are just skins, and once you unlock the teachables there is nothing unique about them other than maybe how stealthy they are with their base model.
---
On the other hand, being able to unlock teachables and then simply level one survivor up to 50+ and just instantly get perks there is a HUGE help for newer players. With killers you need to unlock each good perk on each killer, but with survivors I can just level them to 30-40 depending on which teachables I want and then have one dedicated Survivor that I unlock everything on and just instantly add those teachables to him. 
---
If they did this, they really need to update the Bloodpoint economy. There are too many characters nowadays, and this would increase the grind by a lot.
---
I think that devs said that they aren't going to do something like that and that survivors are just skins
---
He's "special" for not playing like a little bitch?  You libby Dodgers our total jokes.

---
Duh

---
I've done it in kyf with noed. It's absolutely insane.
---
I rarely ever blame a killer for forcing a 3 gen. Sometimes they try but ultimately it is the survivors fault. It sucks when you know that the far off gen cant get done, but then a random pops it and you are 3 genned. One time I was playing killer one badham preschool and i was getting wrecked. They 3 genned themselves w 3 gens in and around the school and i ended up 4k-ing bc of it lol

freddy
---
It's genji.  We're getting genji.
---
I just bought legion 2 days ago, I've barely got them to level 12 and I have tier 3 discordance, so thats cool, not mad or anything.
---
&gt; Which other killer has a power that lets survivors fuck each other over?
---
All of them
---
Lmao I forgot about that.
---
well yeah thats just people disliking their power, nothing to do with their mori animation.
---
I say that everytime i see that movie on netflix. I watched the trailer for "in the tall grass" and i thought it looked horrible. Now i just shit on the tall grass.
---
this subreddit just downvotes randomly, and then sheep see the downvote and go along with it until some saints take it back to positive number, at which point it just keeps getting them or stagnates
---
i have so many offerings like those from so long ago, they're old map offerings back from 2017-2018, i'm saving mine until maybe years later to confuse everyone of what they are
---
No they do
---
I‚Äôm starting to think cleansing is better
---
Seriously Spine Chill has ruined me so much. I have played with it for so long. I was playing Kate because of a daily and I didn't have it on her, felt like I was brand new to the game.
---
I would start with collision removal but consider removing sound if need be. I think collision alone may do it though.
---
Oh I absolutely agree. I play survivor WAY more than killer, and I hate getting tunneled with a passion. 
---
BUT.... I'm making myself right with it, and I'm working on having better teammates, and looping/evading better.
---
Exactly
---
Trapper already gets nerfed every update by the bugs
---
PLEASE TELL ME MORE ABOUT HOW I SHOULD RUN 15 DIFFERENT PERKS AT THE SAME TIME.
---
Not all the time but yeah I can agree thanks for your opinion tho
---
What a coincidence that the players in my match get randomly disconnected the second they get hit once or see the killer
---
no, it always makes you annoying, People dont care if you think they should play different
---
Grammatical*
---
Only the devs know.
---
1. She most definitely did NOT get easier to play. The only thing that made her relatively easier was plaid flannel being made a common addon. The fact that you need to track 2 cooldowns for ur blinks and cannot bloodlust due to you being slower than survivors. 
---
2. The scream addon ur referring to (I'm gonna guess anxious gasp) does literally nothing except give you extra BP for precise blinks. That's it. It doesn't help you track survivors, it doesn't help give you mindgame potential, it doesn't make you any stronger actually. All it does it give you more BP. Fun? Sure. Powerful? Hell no. The hitbox for the scream requires you to actually blink \*through\* them, not just past them. 
---
3. The healing one ur referring to is bad mans keepsake. Everybody assumes a Nurse has Nurses calling, which is the bonus that bad mans keepsake gives her. Nobody heals in her terror radius in fear of Nurses calling, so it's an addon wasted 99% of the time against survivors with a brain. 
---
4. It's not just a nerf for Nurse mains. It's a nerf for NURSE. She's still holding onto red rank viability by her addons and addons alone (the few that are viable), but Basekit Nurse is NOT red rank viable anymore. Source? I'm a red rank Nurse main who used to be able to get into red rank without addons before the rework. Now? Fuck, I need Cincture at the very least to keep up with survivors. And I'm not the only one with this sentiment. I had a 6 hour gaming session playing only Nurse, adjusting to the changes. Even after I had fully adjusted and gotten used to the changes, survivors were still in the postgame screen saying "I cannot believe she actually won" or "Wow, mad respect to you sticking with her" or "Damn dude you make her look like she doesn't need buffed". And even when I lost, most of the non-toxic survivors were saying things like "Yeah one juke should not end the game for her." "At least make her move at 100 and not 97 anymore." or "Revert base kit nerf please I miss fighting Nurses". 
---
TLDR: Ur wrong.
---
Do you know what irony means?
---
It actually DOES help as you can see them look in your direction when they are close by, even behind walls, which you can't see.
---
But still besides that, what 4 perks do you use that helps in a chase?
---
I can't think of 4 skils you put in a single build that ALL helps in chases.
---
Dont worry Bubba fixed it for you
---
I'll start by saying I play both killer and survivor. I think tunneling is a fair play. It sucks to be on the receiving end but I get why it happens. As a killer if you've shown to be the weakest link I'm going to get you out of the game as quick as possible so I become more at an advantage. The game is all about time management. The quicker I take people out the more likely it is for me to win the trial. As a survivor when I get tunneled 9 times out of 10 its because a teammate pulled me off the hook still in range of the killer. I am more mad at the teammate at that point than the killer because I recognize they made the smart choice in who to go after.
---
I love its they look like the icons in the game.
---
Wish I had the same talent as you.
---
I don't use the 'separate the survivors offering: because it makes it more likely they will find and work on four different generators, this is particularly painful if that have toolboxes. It can fuck you over as a killer in my experience.
---
So yeah, it's always a ivory or ebony mori haha.
---
they do
---
Freddy pre-rework was undeniably the worst character
---
Maybe have a message when you DC saying "It looks like you disconnected before your game ended. If this keeps happening, the entity will block you from playing for a while. Check your internet to see if it's working properly before you play again." Splatoon 1 &amp; 2 does this as well, and also doesn't allow you to quit during a match through the menu. (Meaning you have to turn the console off, or unplug the internet.)
---
Oh well in that case let‚Äôs make some rules that survivors must follow how about that?
---
Everyone has their own opinion on how they play just put my thought out there it‚Äôs okay to disagree thanks for sharing your opinion tho I appreciate it
---
because bhvr devs are idiots
---
That's my point! It's not the killer's fault when your teammates are idiots and farm you for bloodpoints.
---
I agree with all your points. Well done.
---
It literally looks exactly like the ingame one ! Amazing !you should have more self esteem and if you are proud of them that‚Äôs the most important part !
---
Dude, killer don't need to be likable. They're killers.
---
Which makes sense as a console user.
---
Also the katana is missing from the map so thats a good indication that the next chapter will have something related to him
---
Dude killer, don't need to be likable.  There killers.
---
I honestly think more people would see it that way if they played both sides. Getting tunneled sucks for sure but place the blame in the right spot.
---
I don't see that happening anytime soon.
---
I will always hold Spine Chill in a special place in my heart for one clutch play it helped me pull off, I was last survivor left after all my team got fucked by a noed pig, I just decided to stick an exit, pig was heading my way but the bonus opening speed meant that I got the exit open quicker and got out by the skin of my teeth, without it I would've gone down for sure,
---
I always wished the game automatically took a screenshot when the flash goes off.
---
tl;dr
---
Tier one Myers can do that, too. So can Pig. What you're describing is a stealth killer.
---
Nerf the add-on not the killer
---
Doc's mori the best...imho
---
What does your steam bio say
---
Not wrong but it should be 1001st time sorry I‚Äôm a grammar nazi.
---
The devs really need to make some new game modes.
---
If he becomes a killer, he won't even be the one with the worse atrocities committed in his backstory.
---
Bhvr insidious camping? How dare they do that
---
The counterplay was insta-downs or killers with an m2 ability
---
1 billy
---
2 ghostface
---
Right. 2 ppl are to blame before the killer...
---
1. Yourself - get better at looping and evading,
---
2. Teammates - get better at timing unhooks
---
You just answered yourself. It extends the chase a few more seconds. Also not to be rude in any sense, but if you‚Äôre not a very good killer you‚Äôre also not going against very good survivors. Dead Harding out in the open will extend a chase for maybe 4 seconds, depending if you swung/lunged or not. If you use it correctly for making distance to a pallet or window, you‚Äôre extending the chase by a significantly longer portion of time.
---
You‚Äôre‚Äôre* dumbass
---
Basment Trapper here please bathe me with salt!
---
üßÇ
---
I wish. I'm constantly getting the swamp.
---
Survivor mains complain about boring game design foremost.
---
Was old legion op? No, he was horrible, but you couldn't counter him so it was boring to play against. 
---
Is spirit on a tier of her own? No, new nurse is as good if no add one are used. Only difference is that nurse has counters while spirit hasn't.
---
it just aint that useful as a dead perk for 95% of the match
---
I very much agree, I hate messing with the color grading of the entire game, but it gets asked with such consistency that I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it never comes.
---
And not how they had it in the PTB where it worked even if you were healthy. Just leave the Endurance how it is now since it can still be avoided. But make the perk function like WGLF to charge it
---
You are exactly right.  The sad part is they expect it to be your problem when it isn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre getting flamed.  Unfortunately it happens a lot.
---
Spine Chill assists in countering the stealth aspect of Ghostface, Wraith, Pig, Myers Tier I
---
Survivors shouldn't open up an exit gate if a survivor is hooked because it's toxic and promotes unaltruistic behavior.
---
i have Discordance so the instant they stack on a generator im already on the way
---
&gt; Tier one Myers can do that, too. So can Pig. 
---
Both of which have drawbacks. T1 Myers is slow, has no lunge range, and can't chase survivors afterwards.
---
The Pig also has drawbacks. She not only has her visibility limited massively by needing to crouch to become stealthed, she also moves much slower like T1 Myers.
---
Ghostface has no balancing factors. He moves stealthed at full sprint speed and can doesn't need to be crouched or otherwise hindered in order to get the stealth back. He can just become fully re-stealthed even during a chase on a whim.
---
It also does this the other way around as killer I lose addons and offerings when survivors dc during loading it‚Äôs very common if you put up a hidden offering (eg. Mori) it‚Äôs stupid but no game is perfect.
---
Submit a help ticket and they‚Äôll give them back
---
randomly guessing where a killer you're deafblind against isn't a "mind game"
---
Flip Flop is quite good in one specific combo. Flip flop + Boil over + Unbreakable + Sabotage.  
---
That's kind of a troll combo and not that great solo (should be better with more people sabotaging) but at least it has a use.  
---
Plus it (in theory) can situationally punish slugging as it could grant you an escape.  
---
Buckle up on the other hand feels like one of those "better than nothing" perks that you only take when levelling a survivor.
---
Those are all valid points and I agree with them for the most part in regards to the theory and methodology, but If argue that hooking the unhooked survivor more often than not results in the uninjured survivor hanging around to unhook the tunneled survivor, if not more than one survivor if they're in the area, and also creates a sense of sympathy for that survivor in which the others try to help more, this stopping one or more survivor from moving forward with gens.
---
Now, that might start to go away in lower tiers and survivors sense the tunneling and leave the injured survivor alone, but I think the added advantage of being down a survivor and occupying the others by forcing them to stop progression to try and "save" the hooked survivor had it's merits, would you not agree?
---
Calm spirit, streetwise, shadowborn, and hex: the third seal.
---
I sometimes have horrible tunnel-vision, to the point where I'll be turning my camera but still staring at the same spot. For killers I'm not particularly great with, I always run Bitter Murur (BM LAWL), because otherwise I can't find anyone lol. 
---
For killers i'm REALLY bad with, I will literally run BM, Rancor, Discordance, and Nurse's calling together because I'm fucking BLIND.
---
Billy has terrible turning while sprinting, and has no counter for looping.  Im confused on why the standard loop/juke tactics dont work on him.
---
Mb one day BHVR take me to their company(I believe) and i start my concept artist career
---
The issue isn't tunneling though, people call tunneling simply if you kill them in fairly short order, even if you do apply split pressure at the same time.
---
Fixated is worthless use empathy or botany
---
Thanks üñ§
---
Solid, solid
---
Since 12 June 2018 we've had the Endgame Collapse added, a lot of perks have changed (Save the Best for Last got a big buff, it's very nice on certain M1 killers), a lot of add-ons have changed, Freddy and Nurse have been overhauled, we've had 5 new killers added.
---
In terms of "meta", Endgame Collapse has changed how you approach endgame. Overall, Nurse is still the strongest killer, but there's something of a 3-way fight between Billy, Spirit, and Freddy for second through fourth place.
---
Well considering you need to heal 3 times after getting hit while the killer is carrying someone (I think?) You could do a gen or 2 in the time that takes. and that‚Äôs not even considering the fact the killer might find and down you first or you go down because they hook and find you before u can get the heal off,
---
Survivors get upset when they can't survive, killers get upset when they can't kill. It is what it is, play whatever way lets you have the most fun and ignore the messages. Someone on the other side is almost always gonna get upset about some made up rules that you didn't follow

Run a build that's designed to end the game before endgame can even happen.  No Adrenaline to worry about, higher likelihood of ranking up due to Lightbringer being protected, guaranteed to 3K or better if they don't have a key.  Once your past the learning phase of the game, NOED just holds you back as a player and encourages game losing habits.
---
Seems like good antimeta, I have Adam at Level 35, might mess with it a little bit.
---
Who's that
---
Yeah I know what you wrote. I'm not fucking illiterate. Knowing for sure if the perk is activating on a totem is a massive advantage to the survivor and fucks over the Trapper and don't fucking act like that isn't true. People who don't play killer are fucking wild, I swear
---
YES PLEASE!!!
---
The Dwight build
---
Really? I was trying to make the worst shrine I could think of.
---
But in no way whatsoever in your post did you describe how having his aura hidden in Night Shroud has enabled him to now sneak up on Survivors and get easy hits, which he was able to do before anyway. Explain to me how Undetectable has enabled this new, popular style of playing him then.
---
I exclusively play Doc with Unnerving, Distressing, Overcharge/Pop, and Huntress Lullaby. Only time I ever have people quit, is when I run a Mori for a daily. Which is rarely.
---
Seeing alot of Tinkerer requests, it is a spooky perk after all
---
Devs aren‚Äôt nerfing NOED. They already confirmed it many times
---
ew! at least overcharge isn't here
---
Yeah. Like I said, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, but it just makes the game an absolute slog with nothing too much survivors without comms can do
---
Like, I‚Äôve seen some killers walk around in a circle to three close gens *from the very start of the game*, even with no one there
---
Still not a smart choice to go for the unhookee. Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike exist. Also the fact you're not applying pressure to multiple survivors means more survivors on the gens, so gens will fly faster.
---
See my other post for a more detailed explanation why I don't think tunneling is a good idea.
---
Reflector's been bullied too long
---
That's why I said solid. ;) Accurate at least. Kimda want streetwise
---
r/unexpectedjojo
---
Why was he always stacking his garbage in T- and L- shapes if not to train My Hero Academia style?
---
Just go for kills however you want as long as you're having fun. Check the results of the match and leave so you can wait 10-15 minutes in que for more fun times.
---
Wasn't Rin chopped up as well? But she is still a killer.
---
I have many of the questions
---
I mean, it could be considered a buff if the perk worked the way it was supposed to now. But the whole concept of "protection hits" defeats the purpose. The only way this would work in theory would be to take a hit for someone, get away and heal, and do this multiple times. Which if you're actually getting away with, you're already going to win the game. And it's simply a "Win harder" perk. It needs to activate off something that doesn't involve you getting hit honestly.
---
That's also very true. Tunneling is too loosely used.
---
No I hope not. People just haven't figured out how to counter him. If you were the last one to see gf, you have a responsibility to break him out. You don't see anyone doing that and people end up dying.
---
Head On is more of a meme perk than something that will actually help you. Run any other exhaustion perk
---
I do it for inner
---
He also told the Entity that actively putting people to sleep is not in his job description.
---
In my opinion, Demogorgon and Ghostface mori is better than Legion mori.
---
All of a sudden? What rock have you been under and is there room for more?
---
Sounds like a lot of whining.
---
It looks great!
---
yeah i watched some of his videos but then saw him do dumb stuff like refusing to stop cleansing a totem even when the killer was repeatedly downing him - and then just leaving the game. Like fuck his teammates right?  
---
It's weird that he's known for being a killer when he fits the stereotype of entitled survivor so thoroughly
---
It‚Äôs still not great tbh. I run Inner too but not Head On. Empathy would honestly be more useful
---
All I can think about reading this is that guy that posted some "cool concept" clip of his game where he DC'd on death hook. I don't think as many people cared about his concept as much as the DC.
---
# *Kono ofukuro da!*
---
It most certainly can not work well. Ever. Under any circumstances lol theres not even a consistent way to get "protection" hits
---
its more that survivors learn 1 way to run a killer (looping) and refuse to try to escape in any other way
---
In my opinion, yes, I love playing legion and have been playing him since I got them. if I were you I‚Äôd watch gameplay and look to see their abilities if you haven‚Äôt already to help With the decision.
---
Survivor mains are 100x more toxic than Killer mains.
---
Change my mind.
---
I don‚Äôt list my build because I don‚Äôt run just one build. I change it up every match so that I can fill different roles, or switch it up, and make sure that it‚Äôs my skill that carries me rather than the meta. the most common build I run is plunderers, ace in the hole, empathy and autodidact. Because I don‚Äôt really need the perks and I find those one fun to use. I try using spine chill once in a while, and everytime I regret it. Because when I use it I do just as well wether I ignore it or not. It really makes no difference to good players
---
He wasn't "too strong." He was shit. They gutted him because people who used exploits were killing the game.
---
I pretty much exclusively play survivor so I don‚Äôt have any recommendations for killers but just letting you know, on the 28th is a Black Friday sale where all characters are 50% off except stranger things who are 30% off. If you are in no rush definitely worth waiting 2 weeks
---
I got stuck in a game with ghostyboi but my audio was endless Plague vomiting :(
---
I‚Äôve seen people moving around when the game is turning the camera at the beginning but this is just insane.
---
Happy Cake Day ‚ù§ü•≥
---
I watched that movie and it seemed low budget
---
Ikr.
---
Wait tractor tech is back last time I checked it was still bugged
---
I'm in purples right now, and I get matched with reds and purples constantly. They DC more than anyone else from what I've experienced, mostly at the start of the match when they're the first down
---
This. Exactly this.
---
The problem with Spirit is that the mindgames are one-sided, the only one playing the mindgames is the Spirit. As survivor, you can't really mindgame her, you just need to pray you're lucky and she mindgames herself.
---
That's just unfun.
---
Green ranks probably
---
Bing bong your opinion is wrong
---
I pulled this before the most recent rank reset i think but i dont fully remember
---
They won't touch her. They'll just keep adding more trees
---
And as we know anything thats fun for the killer is illegal
---
I love playing Legion xD
---
Same! I waited until Spine Chill went off and then rotated my camera to find them with Premonition.
---
Ah, good times...
---
TOP!
---
What does the exposed status effect do?
---
Corrupt Intervention, Lightborn, Stake Out, and Aftercare
---
I‚Äôm actually hoping for corrupt and stake out cause those are the only 2 perks left in the game that I need to make teachable.  The other 2 are just guesses
---
Alchemist stole the katana
---
I mean I do think balance is necessary, but I don‚Äôt have an issue with anything Freddy does. I could maybe see slowing down his teleport time if enough people complained, but it‚Äôs not bad at all.
---
I disagree
---
I would agree before the DS change, but now if it is used because you are just tunneling them then it is fine, but when I play killer I generally avoid tunneling if I can so I do not experience DS that often anymore. I do agree with the exit gate one if that is literally the only reason they are still there.
---
Nurse us garbage on console. The recent nerds made her nearly unusable. Spirit is all we have to fill that void, and now she's targetted for nerfs next. This is literally the result of a bunch of arrogant Survivor mains who are upset that they can't infinite loop certain characters, then flaunt their exploits via T-bagging.
---
How would you tweak my survivor build?
---
Self-Care | Urban Evasion | Bond | Lightweight
---
i'm primarily a solo player and don't like to rely on other players. i feel like my skills in general are pretty good, as i sit in the low purple ranks comfortably. but how would you adjust my build to optimize it?
---
Well, to be fair, when Legion came out the audio in this game was utterly and completely fucked to the point where Spirit was barely playable. Now that the audio is actually functioning, she's much easier to get value from. But your point is still valid.
---
I'm getting ready for them to nerf her into the ground or over complicate things with a rework. To be honest the simplest way to make the spirit more fun would be a subtle directional audio cue for survivors that she is using her ability and to remove collision with survivors while phasing. This evens the playing field but still gives the vast majority of the information to the killer but allows the survivor to have an opportunity to react with more than a guessing game. The important part is that the audio que is subtle and directional, it needs up be somewhat difficult to pick up on unless you are paying attention as the spirit is also listening for subtle audio cues like breathing or footsteps.
---
I will admit I have way more hours on survivor than I do on killer but I do play both. I want to keep what killers seem to enjoy about spirit the same but give the survivors more to go on so that the game is more interactive and fun. Does this sound fair to you spirit players? I legitimately want to know.
---
As long as using their power doesn't crash your game.
---
OMG clown to op no country play I can‚Äôt avoid his bottles, broken sweaty killer
---
How many pens did that cost you?
---
Amanda is is both a victim and an apprentice to the Jigsaw tests which confused the Entity recreating the Pig from Amanda's memories. The Pig is being tested along with survivors. Since Amanda rigged many of her victim's games, her nerfs are Amanda's sadistic aspects applied to the game the Pig is playing.
---
Are you the epic meal guy lol
---
*turns out it's a legion with franks mixtape who tunnels you the whole game*
---
Aw cute! But you‚Äôre wrong.
---
Karate uke waza perks CONFIRMED.
---
You speak the truth. Don't listen to the PC elitists. Nurse is trash outside of the top 5% of players who've actually had the patience to lose over and over, just to play a mediocre character.
---
Shit, you're right. I always forget how screwed up the audio gets every other patch.
---
Her insta down is the most unfair thing in the game that 100% needs to be removed 
---
- Killer main
---
It means you get downed in one hit even if you're in the healthy state
---
Yeah I play console and while I haven't hit red ranks I can do pretty good with billy and the we can only wait and see on what the nerd is if it's not just one or two changes like prayer beads and the vault animation
---
It made a ridiculously hard Killer, who only a tiny minority of people have the patience to learn, even harder. Seems legit.
---
I usually teabag in the exit gates because I'm waiting to make sure everyone's getting out before I leave. It's fun to just sit there and spam. Sometimes I think people read into it too much. Sure some people are assholes but I'm just chilling and tapping my triggers while I wait.
---
You can land on the hay bale when lunging over there
---
Me too, I kept a huntress busy for 3 minutes as I took 3 hooks out and just ran into the same corner so she was too far from a hook to take me.
---
I love The Legion. I like their simple design and the Slightly maniacal playstyle. I love the mori since its simple in idea but its nice to see the survivors fight back for a bit. I just wish Legion was a bit more viable and better in general.
---
Nope. Tunneling someone all game is the opposite of applying pressure. People do this and then complain their gens go by so fast while ignoring the people actually on gens because "why shouldn't I chase the injured guy who's already ran me for 2 gens"
---
I like everything except the revealing the totem after small game goes off twice. If you want to see totems auras bring a map.
---
Nerf Trapper pls, too OP.
---
[Take the player test survey here!](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/DbDCSAT)

It distracts the killer from tunneling and it eventually makes my life easier
---
Strong killers aren‚Äôt a bad thing
---
Especially with No Mither.
---
Fixated is great for the walking speed increase, good for being stealthy.
---
Sorta. Can you describe it and associate it with your joke?
---
2  pens and 1 marker)
---
Yeah that's the trade off really hard to learn but really high potential if you learn nurse then you can do a lot but you have to put time into her
---
Rich when someone doesn't 100% understand a killer that has been out for like 2 months and just got buffed into viability! What a hypocrite he is. /s
---
The only problem though is people are going to bitch if they constantly see Freddy and will say he's op because when used correctly he can stop loops. I enjoy playing against him and think he's fine but people aren't happy if they aren't bitching about something
---
I mainly mean when you get DS‚Äôd at the exit gates also I don‚Äôt tunnel, I always let people go and chase the rescuer but I will eat a DS to get it out of the way before it gets to End game where it will really count.
---
It's an optional thing anyway, the point was to further reduce the time taken to search for totems although that would mean gimping Detective's Hunch
---
or killer will wait exactly 8 seconds and you waste both
---
right? there‚Äôs too many sensitive bitches on this community that take squats too seriously. I always Tbag at exit or whenever I get the oportunity. And when im killer and I get Tbagged is funny for me, but ppl here feels like u were dropping the hard R on them
---
I still really think that's a cool idea. How they would implement something like that would be a interesting to say the least.
---
Spine Chill is that perk that went from; really is it that good, to I will grab it as soon as I see it in the bloodweb. I have only not played with it when I have had a daily for survivors that don't have it yet
---
Unless you‚Äôre already maxed out in those things.
---
ok boomer
---
That‚Äôs also a thing that exists. I‚Äôve seen people randomly disconnecting when they were running to the exit gates or just wandering around cleansing totems, or doing gens.
---
I hope their looking in to cross play gets some positive results. I personally said I had no objections to cross play as a console player as I‚Äôm ready for anything. True, I may get steamrolled some times, but at least the matchmaking queue will probably be reduced, and if they go the route of Fortnite where it can go from console to console instead of just console to PC (or all of them at once), that‚Äôd be amazing.
---
i did not hate her too but i hate the people how disconect when they see a spirit xD
---
Strong killers arent a bad thing but killers that hsve no reliable counterplay are quite a problem
---
Just wait 60 seconds after downing the three of em and smack the 4th if they try to play medic.
---
I see a pattern here that i dont really like OWO
---
The only true new meta perk is Spirit Fury when paired with Enduring. There‚Äôs a debate as to which is better, Corrupt Intervention or Ruin. Cirupt is useful for killers who need to set up first (Hag, Trapper).
---
I was just kidding. I do think Merriam Webster's is better (at least for US language)
---
Console players want crossplay between Ps4 and xbox one not pc due to fps/control
---
I'm probably the only one not excited for Rin father..I rather have Rin as a survivor
---
Yep. I also had a game in which 2 survivors dc'd at the start of the game, the other guy didn't want to dc so he just ran up to the killer for mercy (he didn't get any). Then when he died I look for the hatch for 1 second until I realized that the stupid RNG gods spawned the hatch right next to the killer. Then the killer types in post chat, "gg ez"
---
**DBD IN A NUTSHELL**
---
If you see a brown map offering it means you're about to get riggidy rekt
---
I just imagine the crab on top of an alligator meme and makes me laugh every time. lol
---
Yeah, survivors do it to themselves a lot, create a 3 gen situation super fast. We're often in too much of a rush to bang out generators quickly, because the game is basically a race, but people gotta fucking pay attention sometimes.
---
If I'm working on a generator and I see a survivor has completed the one nearest me, the best thing I can do is actually just stop repairing that generator and move to a far one. But few people do this, and then we all get 3 gen'd at the end.
---
*laughs in trapper*
---
they want to cross play pc with consoles?
---
That's 100% truth. Another Killer is getting the nerf hammer because of loud Survivor trolls who can't bear having their 20 escape streaks broken.
---
Free him
---
Because it's a very good killer, very unpredictable and easy to mindgame with. Plus, if an expert spirit uses the add-on prayer beads the game is pratically over for the survivors
---
It will be probably plague or freddy
---
Have the dev's given a timeline on Dedicated servers on ps4?
---
Is the ‚Äúeverything has a capital first letter‚Äù a big brain joke involving OP‚Äôs title?
---
My friend said that legions Mori sucks, clearly he hasn‚Äôt seen at least 50% of them
---
Welp. That was the most ''constructive'' satisfaction feedback I've given since the launch of the game.
---
So the legion (or at least Joey) didn't mean to kill that guy, and all the licensed killers (exception being leatherface) killed without reason.
---
But they recognize their faults at least.
---
No. I was genuinely trying to understand whether you were sarcastic or not because it really isn't clear. Not my fault all the assholes are out in force today.
---
Have to be a survivor for that one.
---
Thanks so much for the reply I'll be saving this comment and trying it out soon! Appreciate it and excited to see any more from you :)
---
I already hate Rin father and he's not even in the game,if they gonna release him its probably gonna be the least exciting one so far literally no one cares about.
---
Would you like a nerf for her or a change to the prayer bead add on?
---
The same can be said when like 3 survivor dc when you bring good addons ...... don‚Äôt just go on for survivors mah dude
---
Lack of feedback for the survivor side and some broken addons (I.E Prayer Beads).
---
That is true and i dont get it why they dc
---
Can someone please, for the love of God, explain what happened on this sub?
---
It's like the hivemind completely flipped. Just 2 weeks ago its was:
---
Spirit bad=upvote
---
Base spirit is ok= downvote
---
Now its: 
---
Dont nerf spirit= upvotes
---
Spirit is way too strong= downvote
---
I'd love both. Rin's father as like The Oni wearing the mask in more traditional Japanese clothing and wielding the katana would be awesome, but Jack Torrence with his axe would be just as sweet
---
I was not patternüòÇ,just look at this fingers and the sneakers)
---
Have a little self confidence and don't put so much value on what a sub full of reeeeing plebs think
---
Samurai Killer and like a Sensei Survivor who TRAINED the Killer??
---
him? they are both females
---
There are some iconic killers everyone likes but honestly with Rin father is a different kind of hate,like no one cares about him,at least when it comes about killers like myers or freddy they are both likeable in their own way.
---
Rin killed for revenge, lad. She was at death‚Äôs door but the urge for revenge made the entity say ‚Äúwoah this gal got some grit k then let‚Äôs deal now fuck up your papa.‚Äù
---
I strongly recommend anyone who has the time to complete this survey.  BHVR taking the time to put it together to hear from us is awesome, and it covers some major undecided points like cross- play between PC and Console.  If you have a voice in this, this is where you will be heard.
---
yep
---
Prayer beads and collision while nyooming around are the minimum imo
---
I mean micheal then ebony thrn ds then sprint burst
---
I can't really tell because I don't play survivor a lot, but I don't think it needs a nerf
---
He is speaking the language of the gods!
---
It also makes sense with the sane and crazy states of the killer. Either the father or Jack Torrence.
---
Far as I know, it seems they have made it impossible to gain 2 rift points in one game
---
Pretty much,I cant simpathize at all with Rin's father but I can with huntress,this is why she's one of my favorite killer.Rin father randomly thought why not murder all my familly cuz why not.
---
I try to grab a perk as soon as possible to get the entity going. Then grab the other perk if thats an option. From there i try to buy all the cheap stuff to get through as fast as possible. Also look out for opportunitys where the entity cuts off a whole part of the bloodweb \^\^
---
Thats my strategy to spend as little BP as possible
---
Over powered, as in no counter play = too powerful. I don‚Äôt think you know what it means.
---
In my case it depends if I‚Äôm going for Prestige or a trophy or what not. Prestige I‚Äôll grab the cheapest things and sometimes grab the perks if they‚Äôre good for the killer/survivor in case I want to play them. If I‚Äôm going for a trophy usually I‚Äôll go for the better add ons for the person (such as Iri Heads for ‚ÄúSkilled Huntress‚Äù trophy), it all really depends. If I get them P3 then I always just go for the best things perks and items alike
---
I'm actually down for Rins Father. The entity was going to choose him originally but went to Rin instead because of her thirst for revenge (which is typically what makes a vengeful spirit). But the entity probably saved the father after her was cut up by Rin but we just dont know it yet. I'm interested to see how theyll do this. Mind you the other ideas would be pretty cool.
---
Prayer beads need changed and more obvious tell  when using her power. 
---
EZ fix.
---
The xenomorph is never coming, and rins father isnt even close to be anything related to confirmed. A fucking sword is missing. The new killer isnt rins father
---
Could you PLEASE learn how to use periods and commas. Your text is so hard to read.
---
They need to fix the shit out of the "break out of stealth" mechanic though, and maybe make the stalk meters slowly regress. Then significantly buff him some other way.
---
Having a Ghostface walking right behind you, waiting for his cool down, then popping stealth in your face and stealing you for 3 seconds while you stare at him trying to get the "break out of stealth" to work, then getting exposed... That shit sucks.
---
Really? I think they said they wanted to make the Survivors unique somehow but didn't know how. Rumours lol.
---
The michael myers icon is awesome
---
There are no true infinite loops.   
---
Only thing that needs to be changed about spirit is making her glass shards glow much much brighter when she is phasing or vaulting
---
Yet for some reason people hate Rin father way more than these 2.
---
Dang you are lucky. I recently prestiged the Plague and I didn't get BBQ until I passed lv50.
---
Disguised killer fans: AnD hE wOuLd SwItCh To HuMaN bOdY aS a DiSgUiSe!
---
Well, as someone who has over 100 hrs of Bubba experience, it's easy to say that they *just couldn't handle the Neutron style*
---
I really like rancor
---
Do they really tho?
---
I'm not sure I'm completely onboard with this 3-gen thing. Killers can choose to do it on their own (like if they are playing a forever build).
---
But as a survivor, I consider it a win because if the killer chases you, all you need to do is run away from the gens while you're team puts pressure on them. If he goes to your team, then you just work on your gen while they run away from the gens. Though this does require the survivors to be coordinated and smart enough to execute.
---
From my observations most survivors in red ranks run Decisive Strike, and an exhaustion perk usually Dead Hard or Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and the last perk is usually personal preference.
---
BHVR confirmed toxic plz ban
---
As the one guy said the amulet, disgusting with the beads even more than the beads alone, anything that increasing her movement coming out of phasing works well too
---
I was playing her before the the buff because I bought the chapter only for pebble but soon realized how fun it was to play Spirit
---
Congratulations mate. Enjoy the game before you enter the yellows. At that point, welcome to hell.
---
Zubat was using it on stream and had similar problems, so not only is the perk dogshit, it doesn't even work
---
This is probably the best meme on this subreddit
---
I think your right about the that phasing needs to be more clear but im not so sure about prayer beads. If you change her phasing to be more clear i think then prayer bead is in a good position but rn its too strong
---
camping is better
---
Sickness should cause exhaustion, makes sense if they are puking all over the place.
---
I know that.  Not sure what you‚Äôre trying to say.....?
---
Nurse has always been shit on console
---
It could also be a Red Herring while simultaneously hinting at a character similar to Rins Father, I.E Jack Torrence. But who knows, I think either would be a great addition to the game.
---
Demi's mori is the best because you can still hear you're character screaming while being eaten
---
Killers when survs complain about something being broken: lol these idiots always complain git gut
---
Killers when they saw old DS, old BT, old MoM: oMg nErF tHiS iS bRoKeN
---
Brought to you by local 50/50 player with iq higher than room temperature
---
Howd you do that
---
By saying they don‚Äôt like disconnecting and admit they do it sometimes, yes.
---
Yes spirit is fun to play but ofc theres gona be entilted survivors who want her nerfed so they can twabg and so on
---
Ghost face.
---
If only BHVR could buff some low tiers instead of nerfing them for once...
---
Personally i am not a big fan of lightweight, i think there are much more impactful perks you can run. As u/ChaoticTech mentioned, an exhaustion perk would be great. Also one of my favorite perks is Borowed Time. Works great with either potato mates or camping killers.
---
&gt; Legion has a low skill floor but a high skill ceiling. It means that you 'll have it really easy against low rank survivors
---
That's not what low skill floor means. That'd be a high skill floor.
---
Has it been confirmed that it's her father?
---
Rin did not kill to survive, she did it to get revenge on her father.
---
Possibly, maybe after he murdered his family he went into a deep drain of regret and depression, thus the entity took them in as a Survivor as a way for punishment as well as getting a new victim.
---
If anyone touches trapper I‚Äôm gonna make sure that they never leave the basment again!
---
I dont think the pedophile thing is really relevant when were talking about killers, I'm pretty the fact that freddy killed like 3 people is alot more evil then being a pedophile, and not to mention that the trapper killed like 300 people
---
ofc that is the goal but think about what is fun for the other team you have no obligation to make it fair for them or play nicely but sometimes you could be nice and go for the unhooker and let the unhooked person live for a bit longer
---
Could you clarify why it would split the PC community? Wouldn't they be able to play with people from both the PC and Console community pools at the same time if cross play was enabled?
---
Completed, recommend this survey.
---
translation: "I was a wad"
---
The only thing they do is ruin the game to the others players.
---
I love basement traps, put them on the stairs just right so half of the trap is hidden by the one step on the bottom or top! SNAGGED!
---
I have a feeling the Alchemist may be the NEXT Killer, when the 1st Tome is finished.
---
Remember that your main priority is to defend gens, not kill survivors if your goal is to win the game
---
go play another game man
---
i wonder how this game having so many idiots player
---
after i read your post i figure out why
---
lmao this is just gold
---
well but it would also lead to more variety at high ranks
---
Yeah that's the problem with this community.  Play for fun and you get tbagged and bm'd for playing a low tier killer.  Play as a high tier one and you're a loser for playing someone that's actually hard to play against
---
OK salty killer main
---
You must be new around here
---
That actually kind of works. He was in this blood rage that kept him attacking through everything when he killed his family, but he had completely blanked out mentally and wouldn't have any caution or consideration.
---
That sounds more like his second perk, though.
---
"Fog of Rage: Great skillcheck zones are reduced by 100% (so anything increasing them gives back that much), skillcheck success zone is decreased by 10%. You can use exhaustion perks twice."
---
Most people who facecamp are just really bad at playing killer, and are most likely trying to get a daily out of the way.
---
Got it
---
Not enough hours. A god like spirit should take thousands of hours minimum
---
I feel sad when i get one on my bloodweb and have to use it, they are so bad rn
---
Nahh, the beads just remove the audio cue, I want a more pronounced visual que when using her power, to salvage the integrity of the yoink spirit build, but also to counter her fake outs at pallets/windows/etc.
---
Are they different for each Legion member?
---
SCUD GANG RISE UP
---
How would a PC Spirit be any different than a console Spirit?
---
Spine chill is a hard nerf to prayer beads, and even when i dont have it you can hear her godzilla steps from 10 feet away
---
glad to hear that
---
I'm aware of that, but thanks. Being 1 off, just infuriates me and my ocd :/
---
It has to be with Rancor, which only works when the gates are powered.
---
I mean, fuck Rin
---
Why are we so focused on nerfing spirit when we should be focused on bugging trapper
---
You're entitled to you're opinion, but I think BHVR doesn't tease anything like this unless they have plans. If it turns out not to be, you have my permission to scream "I told you so" at me.
---
As someone who doesn‚Äôt like Ash‚Äôs voice lines, f*ck u /s
---
True that, played 4 matches yesterday and all 4 different killers facecamped from the start since the randoms were running kindred. Also these are rank 6 killers...
---
By just stating this you show how toxic you must be lmao
---
Jake disconnected in the locker.
---
r/dbdgonewild would love that.
---
Imagine thinking Rin's father is going to be the next killer when we already know The Alchemist is the next one.
---
Have there been any punishment for people dcing btw. Havent heard of any
---
Ahh so many perks need the goddamn rework but I feel like they want to change stuff but it just takes them such a long time to make sure everything works and isbln't bugged.
---
You'll be convinced the other way once you actually do cleanse and face a Plague that can actually make proper use of it.
---
For context: when I pointed my finger at him, I wasn't trying to be his friend or something like that, it was just me saying that I give up and he could kill me (because honestly there's no way I would survive that), but instead, he pretended to be a friendly guy so he could kill me when I was almost winning and t-bag me.
---
Also, he laughed at me in the chat.
---
I would like to know a single moment where that cant be quoted lol
---
I feel like with all the sheet metal and wood sticking out of the Killer shack would make climbing it pretty easy. I also never recognized there being a hole in the roof until seeing this.
---
Turn out meg had some form of glitch or hack as  she went through multiple walls and the exit gate
---
Im not a new but just interested to what other people think
---
Put hag traps on windows and pallets, especially the god pallet and window at shack if you find it. Even better, of shack has basement and you hook someone down there, real every entryway into the shack and the top of the stairs and above the left wall of the stairs.
---
Rins mom as killer and dad as survivor would be dope
---
These are rank 6 killers, tried just banging gens out and getting out but people just killed themselves on the hook.
---
Because this sub constantly changes from survs circlejerk and killers circlejerk
---
Ah so that's the bar I see at the top on the a few of the youtube videos I've seen. I played when Huntress was top tier with Billy and Nurse. Didn't know Nurse got reworked either tho, so thats pretty sweet.
---
I saw a similar idea some time ago to this where someone suggested that the survivors get a 4th tier of their teachable perks, so claudette would have lvl 4 botany knowledge, empathy, and self care, for example.
---
Well, that's progress. Although from the other side, that's like 10 hours + RNG for a new player to have one fully competent character to use, since the low-level perks are deliberately trash. Assuming their start speed isn't lower due to only having one perk slot at the beginning and not having BBQ/ having T1 WGLF.
---
I doubt anyone ever accused you of gen camping. And I have been accused of wallhacking with Scratch Myers
---
Playing against *insert new killer name* is boring. /s
---
He‚Äôs just playing the game? His main goal is to kill people why do you have a stick up your ass
---
They'll never do anything about instaheals either! Oh wait...
---
They'll never do anything about survivors stalling the game out once the exits are open! Oh wait... That's literally *what endgame collapse is for*.
---
Srsly though, you're right overall. Nerf survivors.
---
What‚Äôs the killer supposed to do when exit gates are right next to their hook victim and, judging by your comment, when the exit gates are open?
---
Secret lore: Rin is actually a weeb and made up her backstory. She's from modern Japan, a huge horror fan, and pranked the Entity into giving her fantasy powers.
---
Hes a disgrace to me and ghostface mains everywhere
---
It's good for going in for an unhook if you expect to need to take a hit  after you unhook and are already injured and can't use your medkit to heal yourself/cant be healed fast enough before they change hook state
---
Very niche and uncommon, yes, but it has a use
---
He's saying there are other killer Mori's that suck a lot more. Personally the worst offenders are trapper and wraith
---
I disagree.  I like playing against Spirit because she requires a different style of play besides running the same loops every game.  Getting instadowned by a chainsaw from across the map is way less fun.  Billy is easily my least favorite killer to go against.
---
They do, they just don't reduce charges anymore. So you can get a fully functional medkit on top of the special use which you can pop when it's almost depleted.
---
Adding a new luck offering probably
---
Who is saying otherwise? What is the point of this comment?
---
No, I was saying that Legions Mori is better than most Moris in the game.
---
Playing the game and being a dick is different. If he was just playing the game, he would have killed me right away, he wouldn't pretend that he would be my friend, t-bag me, and then laugh at me in the chat.
---
I see no issue with this, he let you get some more objective points and then got a free hook from you.
---
Stop bitching already. Cant stand these posts asking for things to be made easier
---
never trust a killer. i cant count how many times ive tricked dumbasses into doing a gen just to grab them off. "oh you had a dc? let's farm then.... PSYCHE! Gotcha bitch!"
---
Here's my idea for Freddy:
---
###The Nightmare
---
*The Nightmare is completely invisible to awake Survivors, and cannot harm them.*
---
**Dream Demon:** The Nightmare casts a spell that surrounds him. Dream Demon can be activated by **holding down the Power button**. When activated, any Survivor within an **18 meter radius** will **fall asleep** after **5 seconds**. While Survivors are **asleep**:
---
- They leave their bodies, and enter the **Dream World**.
---
- They can see The Nightmare and other dreaming Survivors, but not ones who are **awake**.
---
- They cannot **repair generators**.
---
- Their auras are **revealed** to The Nightmare every **20 seconds**.
---
When The Nightmare places a Survivor on a hook, they **wake up**, and their dream body becomes their real body. Dream Demon lasts for **60 seconds**, and cannot be activated again until either **30 seconds** pass, or no Survivors are dreaming. Survivors can wake up by:
---
- Using the **Wake Up recovery action**. While stationary, Survivors can go through a process that includes skill checks, allowing them to wake themselves up. *This functions just like curing The Legion's Deep Wound status effect.*
---
- Being woken up by another Survivor. While dreaming, Survivors' bodies are left on the ground where they fell asleep. **Awake** Survivors can perform the **Wake Up recovery action** on sleeping Survivors, transporting them back to their bodies.
---
Every time a Survivor completes the **Wake Up recovery action**, it becomes **10%** harder to do so the next time they fall asleep, stacking to **100%.**
---
**Dream Projection:** *Remains unchanged, except awake Survivors cannot see the blood spewing out of the generators.*
---
I was really trying to stay loyal to the source material with this concept, since it bugs me that Freddy can be seen while Survivors are awake. I believe this rework would make him viable, whilst still honoring to the lore.
---
Yeah it's unfortunately common in this game to receive hate mail if you do something that the other team even slightly dislikes. If you can or want to, i'd recommend restricting your chat settings to just friends.
---
Yuck
---
Gate keeper rewards you for gens not done
---
Yea especially people who teabag at pallets. Like fucking pressing spacebar to throw down a pallet isn't skill.
---
It is a minor change to her base power all it is is putting like one or two extra seconds before you can use the second blink and while seconds matter and add up they could have made it so she couldn't blink through things which would have killed her
---
To entitled, T-bagging Survivor mains, it is.
---
He needs baseline eboni mori to make him balanced
---
Yeah, myers mask is quite nice. Also, can you attempt to draw the Afterpiece Tonic?
---
the match you described is boring for survivors and killers. match start killer goes to 3 close to each other gens and waits. survivors just think killer isnt really there, they do gens, then oops they realized too late here comes a 1 hr game.
---
Just as OP already said, adding a permanent exhaustion to the sickness would be a strong buff and it would actually give a bigger incentive to cleanse aswell.
---
However I also think that we shouldn't forget the reason why Survivors don't cleanse in the first place. A good Plague can anihalate several Survivors during these 60 seconds.
---
So I'd dare to say that if just exhaustion would be added and nothing else, Plague would become stupidly OP. Survivors can't stealth against her due to the disease fucking stealth whilst the Survivor is broken aswell. So they'd have to rely on loops in order to handle her.
---
The issue with that is that Plague has A LOT of stalling potential when we consider slugging, Dying + Thanato comp, and the bare pressure emitted by her having CP (cause atleast one will probably cleanse right?).
---
Giving Plague players no issue to rely on consistence and safety in loops to shred as many pallets as possible. In addition to the fact that CP gives Survivors a very hard time to swap locations during a chase, they'll render areas "dead zones" pretty consistently as the game passes on.
---
So yeah, we gotta be very cautious there.
---
IF exhaustion is added, I'd dare to reduce the duration of the CP from 60 seconds to 45 seconds by default. Simply because her m/s is already reduced by 5% for CP's duration, while reducing it by another 5% would make her too immobile to actually get value out of it if she doesn't go for it mid-chase.
---
&gt;I disagree.  I like playing against Spirit because she requires a different style of play besides running the same loops every game.  Getting instadowned by a chainsaw from across the map is way less fun.  Billy is easily my least favorite killer to go against.
---
I'll disagree on the different playstyle thing. If you are injured without IW near the spirit and she starts phasing it's a guaranteed down. No "playstyle" will help you there. It's just uniteractive for the survivor player.
---
Where's the funny
---
Technically Legion only killed one person
---
Rin's father isn't just terrible lore-wise; he also can't possibly be worthwhile.
---
Oh, a Japanese Killer with a sword? Yeah, that's hot and fresh, we don't have any of those. What's his power? Not being a vengeful ghost, just a dick? Sounds like an M1 Killer, we need more of those.
---
But what if...he's a Survivor?
---
That's detective taps first name.
---
It do be that way, it really do
---
funny who ?
---
Please explain why?
---
Is it because you cant turn around as fast with controller?
---
Cause there are many tricks for that.
---
He didn‚Äôt have counter-play in chases meaning once he was on you he could have the choice to down you no matter what. This process took long so this allowed gens to get completed. I don‚Äôt think you know how this game works. Spirit needs changes to add counter-play.She doesn‚Äôt need a nerf but instead counter-play and have fun for both sides and not a guessing game.
---
Not to my knowledge - dedicated servers have always been lumped together whenever timeframes have been mentioned. Remember that their implementation on PC is still officially "in testing".
---
Yes,mb i find this sketch and post(if if find my work exactly)
---
That‚Äôs his name though, Detective David Tapp.
---
Tapps name is David dude.
---
Detective Tapp.
---
&gt; Cause there are many tricks for that.
---
Feel free to show me in game.
---
That's not a nice thing to say to someone on their cake day
---
That‚Äôs an issue of BHVR balancing around bad players. The cost of using her addons is a big fat ‚Äúwhat the hell Ever‚Äù I don‚Äôt care about her addons. Her basekit got a very unnecessary nerf.
---
If you have to resort to tricks to turn fast with a controller then this argument is pretty much dead.
---
No one on console would ever use keyboard so that would make no difference
---
I'm not sure people will all be so heavily invested in the lore that they go out of their way to mori Mr. Yamaoka, but this is the community that focused Scoops Ahoy Steve so maybe I'm overestimating.
---
yeah idk if they think a killer cant force a three gen or what. i got -60 on another comment and im just like wtf happened lol
---
I can only play freddy, so if he gets nerfed I'm fucked
---
Billy has flown under the radar for far too long. The only Survivors don't mind him is because he's loopable. That the only thing that matters to them. Nevermind players who don't run strict meta perks. No, looping is all their is.
---
He's obviously being sarcastic. I truly have no clue how you don't understand that
---
Glad they did this, so I could hit strongly disagree on the idea of crossplay with PC
---
i play trapper mostly killer side.
---
So ***that's*** why I can't find anyone when I play as the killer.
---
I would add that i dont think Myers or Billy are OP though, they have to work for their oneshots and both have outplay potential.  
---
I can understand that both Nurse and Spirit are frustrating to play against, i play plenty of survivor and find it rough - but i like that it offers a different sort of gameplay than 'run to Jungle gym until window runs out - drop pallet - run to next loop - get bloodlusted down'
---
Everybody please vote that it's not scary enough. I want to bring the horror back.
---
nasty
---
They can turn around faster to hit you so they have a lower chance of being 360'd compared to consoles
---
I like Legion‚Äôs mori a lot because of how the survivors fight back. It gives it more action/personality.
---
and i like wraith kinda dislike spirit and nurse and billy
---
Satisfactory
---
It‚Äôs not at all a minor change. There‚Äôs now a 3.5 second cool down on a double blink, which is crippling for a killer who cannot move faster than survivors. 
---
Basically after every double blink there‚Äôs a 3.5 second window where survivors have complete control over the chase.
---
I misread his comment. I thought he was being sarcastic. Didn't see the parenthesized portion.
---
Yea man didn't you know the best way to defend gens is to not kill survivors?
---
Shit Posting 99.
---
I hear this argument a lot when certain streamers names are thrown about as being 'the best killer' that there is always someone to shoot them down saying that they are not even close to being the best killer, yet you give no names as to anyone else who is better. 
---
I am not disagreeing with you, just wondering on who you think is the best killer, or a better killer that Otzd
---
As a survivor main I feel like im the only person to have never seen a problem with Spirit
---
this is a stretch
---
Exactly. Addons are 99% of the problem, in most cases. Billy is an exception because he's braindead easy, and has ZERO penalty for spamming his broken ability.
---
Had a trapper who used surveillance overcharge and ruin who forced me into a three gen due to two other survivors not paying attention to spacing.
---
It became pretty obvious he had surveillance and I  a disgusting Claudette made him work for his 4k which he earned by using a good strategy that pushed the game into his favor due to people having good game sense. Post game chat random meg lost their shit and left while my friend and I talked to him about the set up and how good it was.
---
What I mean is if youre away from a loop in an open area and try and juke the chainsaw right behind you any billy player who knows what theyre doing WILL land it. The hitbox is very generous on it
---
Also the turning isnt what makes his chainsaw sprint good, its how much map pressure he has with it + the shredding pallets is a benefit.
---
And when I play survivor I don't teabag or even use ds. It's still a one sided post complaining about survivors regardless of what you've done to "defend them". And it's not even about what side you play, the point is that this format and type of meme is overused in this sub. It's a constant circle jerk of either side saying "Waah survivors do this, killers do this". No one wants to hear it anymore.
---
I disagree with The Spirit nerf. I'd rather agree with a Spirit ***rework***
---
Lol 'a little harder' yeah, sure. Have you ever actually seen PC gameplay? Like actually watched and paid attention to the absolutely massive benefits of playing with a M&amp;K?
---
And if they made cross platform optional it'd just split the playerbase and make queues worse.
---
Cross progression is definitely the biggest thing in the survey for me, I have DbD on PC and PS4 and never play PC because of it, I‚Äôd buy it on my switch as well if cross progression came in.
---
Strictly speaking, she's not overpowered. She has a strong Very Rare add-on that has no practical counter, but outside of that her main strength is that she's *easier* to use than Nurse or Billy.
---
Nurse takes practice to get her Blink down, Billy is hard to steer and very noisy, but Spirit moves about as fast as Billy *with full range of motion* while making less noise than either.
---
&gt; I feel like this subreddit is majority console players
---
It's not. There was a survey and it has more PC players
---
Happy birthday, bb &lt;3
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure you can google it and find a more in depth answer but what I do is just click on the discussion flair when I run into one which there is one like 5 posts down from this one and you can see all of them there.
---
To give an example of a killer that wasn‚Äôt changed because of their power level but instead of their bad mechanics. People just blame survivors for every killer change and shuts them down with shitty memes with no real discussion.
---
It seems like it could be a red herring as to the new killer but I was thinking maybe spirit changes, but I really highly doubt he really is the new killer
---
Haha okay?
---
Also, Bhaviour has said that they will look into making the sensitivity of controllers way more then you're capable of doing now.
---
Unless you have played nurse and huntress with controller for a few months your agrument is literally invalid...
---
My money was on Billy, but I hadn't considered console.
---
Unfortunately 99% of this subreddit displays everything in memes. Not just the funny stuff but actual suggestions that would probably make better discussion in text than in a shitty meme format. That's just how this community operates, and I wish it was different but not a lot you can do.
---
Thanks for the tip then !
---
Detective Tapp's first name is David.
---
she is very strong, and forces survivors to play in a way they are not used to. with certain add ons she can be very uninteractive to play against. Those addons are very rarely used however and seem to be used to construct an argument that she's that powerful all the time which is simply not true.
---
Do killers actually whine that survivors are doing their objective?
---
I see it that if a killer is bitching at survivors doing gens as quickly as possible, that's dumb as shit. If they're complaining that the game is designed in such a way that survivors can get 2+ gens done in like 1 min, that's another.
---
Increasing gen time won't change gen rush even with hex ruin. Devs should give them 1 more objective before they starts gen rush. My ideas: find parts to gens, release themselves from ropes... Whatever to slow them down.
---
&gt; To give an example of a killer that wasn‚Äôt changed because of their power level but instead of their bad mechanics
---
But no one was saying otherwise literally ever about Legion. This is totally irrelevant in this conversation. If anything, you're proving the point about whiny survivors correct by doing this
---
Gen rushing = killer doenst have enough map pressure 
---
Gen "camping" = you done fucked up and gave the killer a tiny area to pressure instead of a whole map
---
Exactly, but Billy is still way to powerful. You can't just consider meta-abiding pro-players. Most players want fun and varied experiences, and Billy is by far the most toxic Killer, IMO. He's braindead easy, has a spammable 1HKO ability, AND can fly across the map with no cooldown.
---
Any word on the insanely long queue times? I've been in queue for almost 45 minutes as of this post.
---
At this point, they should just add some universal Killer skill and deal with the fallout while they're already nerfing meta Killers, instead of nerfing meta Killers and not having time to even try to buff the losers.
---
Imo spine chill is overrated
---
I‚Äôm doubling this down by saying I‚Äôve played both PS4 and PC and I am MUCH better at getting flashlight stuns in one than the other. I‚Äôll let you guess which is which.
---
Legion, too.
---
How have you not seen that happen once?  It happens in 99% of my games as a survivor or killer.  
---
You say it doesn‚Äôt exist because it‚Äôs just doing the objective... as if killing survivors and putting them on hooks isn‚Äôt the objective for the killer... that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm saying that they‚Äôre both the same thing.  Doing whatever it takes to get gens done isn‚Äôt any different than doing whatever it takes to get survivors down.
---
If i'm levelling a killer i will look up what their best addons are (most killers have like 2 or 3 that are useful and lots of trash) 
---
I will pick up those if i see them, otherwise go for the most browns/yellows i can to get through cheaply.  
---
I will also try to pick from one side so the entity will chew up a whole portion of the bloodweb and save me points.
---
Oh yeah I forgot about them
---
First excuse is that you need to use tricks, then you admit that controller sensitivity needs tweaked.
---
You‚Äôre literally admitting that you‚Äôre not on par with KB/M.
---
Prayer Beads are the ONLY issue.
---
I acutally thought Spirt was in a nice spot but I am in the minority
---
Why would you run M&amp;A in that build? If it's for Prayer Beads then that's just a PB build.
---
The reason I got with Freddy instead of Billy is at least in my experiences. Billy's seem to run lose in green ranks but then just disappear in purple. I've seen more Myers and Freddy's in red ranks than any other killer. So it's hard to say if PC and consoles will have the same next overused killer or not
---
as a Quentin main, we need more cosmetics
---
It is. I watched it, and it reaffirmed my belief. He was respectful, but he really tore down Scott's logic. A lot of Scott's arguments just seem totally ridiculous and not based in reality. The best example is when he said "if you go through all the pallets you just fuck over your team and 2 gens are done". If you have a survivor that runs you through like 10 pallets, at high levels(which is what we're talking about, not grey ranks) then 3-4 gens are done and the killer has already lost. Basically, Scott spends a lot of time not really grappling with reality. 
---
I understand his responses perfectly well. That's why I think they're not very well reasoned. His other video on WHY people hate Spirit and playing against her is fine. I totally get that. But his critique is just not good imo. 
---
I mean, Tru isn't the best, but I watch his stream too. He's pretty consistent. He isn't the best surv or killer, but he's very good at both(I know you said that). 
---
30 second chases is another thing that isn't accounting for other killer activities or accounting for advanced structures. Like the Abattoir loop, Preschool, Disturbed Ward main bldg, etc. In these structures, or interconnected jungle gyms which are quite common, even as Spirit against a good survivor, there is a 0% chance of you ending every chance in 30s unless they're always fucking up. I'm a pretty reasonably good Spirit and I have good headphones, and I realize it's an anecdote, but Jund's scenario is, from where I stand, not very realistic.
---
Welp, time to stop playing as Claudette
---
Freddy needs a second rework. I propose a hybrid version of his two kits.
---
I think BHVR shouldn't ALWAYS, listen to the community, like, if the community wants something, they go out there and do it. Even if it doesn't need a fix.
---
I want him to be a killer just to dab on the Spirit mains. First their waifu is getting nerfed and then the man who chopped her to bits is getting added.
---
I don't think he will be added though.
---
I hate to say it, but if you can‚Äôt hide from a killer they *should* get a guaranteed down, at least eventually.  They are the power role and they are fighting the clock.  Survivors can use teamwork and numbers to balance it out, but in a 1 on 1 chase it should not be about if the killer gets you but when.  The purpose of a chase is to try and waste as much of their time as you can.
---
Her "mindgames" are completely 1-sided. She can hear you walking, breathing, grunting, see your blood etc. run into you while phasing, you cant see her vaulting animations, she can stand still and just look at what you do before phasing.
---
She's a boring killer and every single chase against Spirit 100%, with no exception, relies on her skill entirely.
---
They should brighten up her shard glow and make it visible on all skins so observant players can tell when she's phasing, too. Or just make her giving the wiggles before phasing visible to Survivors.

i honestly like when killers facecamp because its just shows that they love losing the game and letting all the gens get worked on i just hate when the other survivors dont work on gens and the killer gets two or more kills since he doesnt deserve it
---
Then unfollow the sub. It‚Äôs almost as simple as that, if you‚Äôre not having a good time then don‚Äôt visit. I mean apparently a lot of people want to hear about it if we all keep posting and upvoting/commenting on them. But I can‚Äôt post 2 memes in 1 also complaining about face camping or mori spamming or anything killers do to be toxic.
---
I‚Äôve been playing killer a lot lately so that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a post specifically about survivors.
---
If Nurse is the best killer in the game, why does everyone play Spirit now?
---
Freddy main here. Yeah
---
Are we gonna be here *ALL* day?
---
Im still salty that they removed this, it was fine (and really funny) and honestly shouldn't have been a high prio thing considering *insert literally any actually significant issue*
---
Agreed
---
Billy has eluded nerfs for far too long. The only reason for it is because he's loopable, and that's all sweaty Survivor mains care about. Nevermind trying different strategies.
---
I think if they redesign Quentin like they've been talking about, they should keep the original Quentin in the game too.
---
They should balance for the ranks the majority of players spend the majority of their time in, inclining higher because players will gain skill over time.
---
I don't know if that's green or purple, but I doubt it's as low as yellow or as high as red.
---
The only trick i use is changing sensitivity to 100% when playing as nurse.
---
It would be better if they gave us more options when it came to controller sensitivity. 
---
But i dont see why you would have any problems with cross play?
---
yeah i agree this is best argument i‚Äôve seen for spirit. people would rather her just be nerfed than learn how to play.
---
Oh got it
---
Just those, really.
---
So shit
---
How can both those things be true then lol
---
firth
---
So most people do look down on straight up face camping like nose touching nose camping. id like to know your opinion on that. it ruins the survivors experience and isnt super interactive for the killer. people can play that way and as A FUCKING KILLER MAIN i see that as dirty (have you noticed the bloody wraith in my title i kinda like him). So if you agree face camping should he looked down upon then i put this strategy in the same level.
---
MATCH STARTS
---
killer looks around for 3 gens closest to one another. sits on those 3 gens until they are the only 3 gens left in the match. whacking people then abandoning chases to protect his 3 gens. rinse repeat.
---
that match can go on for 30 minutes. i dont want to experience that match on survivor side so as a killer i wouldnt do this.
---
HOWEVER if there is one gen left in the match i agree camp the shit out of those gens. if the survivors gave you a 3 gen even fucking better. capitalize on their fuck up. tear them a new asshole. win
---
You are mostly talking about doing this yes i agree do that dont do the first example
---
Would be nice for killers on the platform but the consoles suffer more from fps issues
---
A towel.
---
&gt; the majority of players spend the majority of their time in
---
this is around 9-13 which is where they definitely balance, and which is relatively low in context of how high rank play goes
---
I thought her sword was made of glass?
---
Imagine Sempiternal and amp together, awesomely made imo the breakdown is also filthy and reminds me of Shadow Moses
---
Oh please, Survivor mains are far more toxic. They're arrogant trolls that live bullying Killers, and flaunting their escapes.
---
Looks like he face camped
---
Yeah when i saw the cosmetic question for freddy and cannibal i was like ????????
---
I‚Äôm so useless at premonition I always forget to use it :( Spine chill is great for me but then I don‚Äôt know which direction to run so that‚Äôs why I just run Alert or Dark Sense
---
I dont remember who said this but i think it would be good if the removed the bumbing in to you while phasing
---
The subreddit serves as a host for two extremist groups of players (radical survivor mains or killer mains) that constantly spew their bullshit views and point fingers instead of looking at the bigger picture. Then the same people wonder why BHVR doesn't listen to the community. Well it's because of idiotic posts and ideas like these.
---
Am I stupid or has anybody else been hearing like a phone ringing sound randomly while playing?
---
thats pretty funny
---
But why?
---
Holy fuck. I get why they added the matchmaking change for ranks 15-20 but this is fucking ridiculous. Are you seriously telling me that the only suitable lobby in DBD at that point in time was ranks 4/5, Behaviour?
---
Unpopular opinion: the older Moris aren't that bad. I actually really like the little leg pull Wraith does in his.
---
Do agree that Trapper's is really uninspired though. There's a lot they could've done with Trapper and instead he kinda just slaps them a bunch.
---
Exit gate tbag is the worst, I just want to get to the next game, hurry up and get out. Tbag at windows or pallets arent a problem for me cause i play huntress and it just gives me the opportunity to hatchet them.
---
ive been playing trapper more after the archives because it forced me to get off wraith and i found out i actually like him. so ive been spending time on him. my wraith has all the perks but my trapper doesnt but im still doing ok. normally 3 to 4ks
---
Getting the hook is, and the is the prerequisite for that action
---
On PS4, is there anyway for a survivor to message the killer before or during a match?
---
I‚Äôd love crossplay if there‚Äôs an option for us to do it only with other consoles. I don‚Äôt like the idea of being forced to crossplay with PC with no options at all.
---
The pig have EYES?
---
yaaaays
---
Doc's is simple but effective. Shows a lot of his character: zero regard for the Survivor as he's filled with pure anticipation of what he's about to do.
---
Verry nice the detail and everything keep it up
---
What rank do you play at where you dont play him territorially?
---
Decisive Strike is literally a must have perk. You *can* run without it, but you simply will not be as strong, it is extremely, extremely powerful. An exhaustion perk is always good - Balanced Landing is the strongest imo since it has a very useful effect even whilst exhausted, and whilst people say its map dependent, nearly every map has a place to use it. If not use Dead Hard, free mistake every chase what more could you ask for?  
---
Adrenaline is very strong, BT is good if you're going for saves and Iron Will is insanely strong vs nearly all killers and especially vs Spirit which you'll see a lot of at high ranks. 
---
I main killer so play survivor less, but run DS/Adrenaline/Iron Will/Balanced Landing every game. Sometimes i'll swap out Adrenaline or IW for something a bit more fun like Spine Chill or We'll Make It
---
I will call the police.
---
Make it so you only get a limited amount of Moris or Keys every season. They could make them available in the free tiers of The Rift and you would only get two or three in those tiers.
---
Yes,sirüòÇüñ§
---
Did you just say true that to your own post
---
They really did great reanimating sonic
---
&gt;  I'm sure they're smart enough to figure out some balance 
---
You have too much faith in them.
---
They are reworking maps like they are reworking addons
---
Just play on xbox, havent seen a spirit in months.
---
Are you planning on doing more ?
---
Don't forget the whole thing started because the entity was grooming him into a killer, he probably wouldn't have snapped otherwise.
---
around rank 8
---
I guess you're a god then
---
the cross play they have between steam and the microsoft store has it optional so i would assume this would be the case for cross platform as well
---
Honestly the more i play the more i don't really have a problem with prayer beads, thats only a problem for gen grabber spirit, you would take a hit from ghostie or t1 myers just the same as you get hit from a spirit coming out of invis.
---
The only real problem i have is the lack of agency in a chase to tell when she is in a power. Make her body just stop moving entirely instead of continuing an idle animation. Also remove that random ass mini-phase she gets just for walking around, or make that a side power the killer controls, but uses up like 25% of her ability bar, like cancelling a freddy TP does.
---
That's the thing, you shouldn't need to run one or two perks out of dozens to even play against one killer out of 17. jUsT rUn iRoN wIlL anD sPinE cHiLl like no, when your only option to countering a killer is your perks instead of your gameplay, that's a sign that the killer is overpowered.
---
True but if you keep getting looped back there every time you find one survivor that is just a match up where you weren't gonna win from the start just like efficient survivors is gonna beat most killer mains
---
There is a hell believe me I‚Äôve seen it. There is a heaven let‚Äôs keep it a secret.
---
So its time for ~~Hillbilly~~ Doctor.
---
Turns out Behaviour does a massive sneaky one and they reveal that The Alchemist just stole the Katana to use it
---
I want try 2 weeks of my arts in this reddit,and now i am drowning Rin.Mb 2-3 Hours and i and this
---
You must have been real proud of this almost not at all related DBD meme to take a picture of it and immedaitely post it to Reddit.
---
Anything goes in endgame. If a killer is facecamping in endgame you should just leave or accept it as a challenge.
---
She doesn‚Äôt need a nerf. People just can‚Äôt counter her right.
---
My god, please no cross play with PC. Xbox to PS4 (and potentially switch?) but it‚Äôs just a completely different game on PC
---
&gt;when only 2 survivors are alive cuz chances are both of you are looking for a hatch
---
Most of the time people stop trying to get the last gen done at 2 Survivors anyways from what I find.
---
Tbh I just am done with spirit
---
Billy is oddly absent from console, I don't really know why. I'm an xbox billy main and I really don't find him that tough to use, at least nothing that isn't just part of the learning curve of billy on all platforms.
---
I've never seen someone obtain so much karma, then lose it all in the top comment chain. 
---
Also your claim that a Wakizashi and Katana are the same blade but different sizes is just wrong. The cultural significance of both are huge and they're also made completely different. Samurai wielded both a katana and Wakazashi, having both was called daish√µ (act like that line above the o is a straight line and not wiggly) 
---
The wakizashi was usually a more straightened sword that could be used for stabbing rather than a normal katana that has big slashing attacks.
---
The wakizashi acted as a quick and deadly backup sword incase the samurai ever got disarmed. 
---
Eventually the wakizashi became the main indoor practice weapon as it was significantly easier to use over long training hours.
---
We can assume that if Rin's dad will become the killer, he will be wielding a wakizashi as Rin "disarmed" him. There's not much reason to make assumptions about things until we get more teasers. It's just going to result in people disagreeing with your opinion and mass downvoting you, even if your intentions weren't to be rude.
---
i just get a lot of bear traps on healthy survivors so chases are like 10 sec. i bet its so frustrating
---
Thank you.  I've been playing Spirit as main and with fair frequency the survivors all escape or I don't even get half of them.  It fully depends on if the survivor knows what they're doing and knows to listen for her spirit phase sound.  The good players I've been hit with pallets while phase walking.  It's definitely easy to see the difference between those who know how to deal with her and those who don't.  Those who don't just get killed quick, those who do are capable of stopping her in her tracks.  Trapper on the other hand I have at level 1 and constantly get 4 kills a game.  He's just so good.
---
So, did you not get the ‚Äúphone bad, book good‚Äù boomer joke?
---
Bruh, if you don‚Äôt have a counter play that‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs too powerful, you want me to grab a dictionary?
---
Looking forward to more &lt;3
---
No. That would wreck the game psychology and allow points farming.
---
I appreciate thatüñ§
---
Not my build btw
---
The Devs literally stated that Spirit is the only killer that is *over-performing*
---
well i think for mori's i think they should be in the killers base kit for every game but you can only use them after two  hooks and then just get rid of the offering
---
I'll come in here as someone who's studied linguistics in the past. The term "homonym" has a really subjective definition. Usually it is used to describe different words that are both spelled and pronounced the same (like you said). I've also come across the term "true homonym" which refers to words that are homonyms _and_ differ greatly in their meanings. Some definitions actually state that only true homonyms are actual homonyms.
---
However, sometimes (like in the case that's being argued here) it is used as a collective term for homographs (words that are only spelled the same) and homophones (words that are only pronounced the same) as well. In the case of the Tweet, it's clear that it's referring to homophones so I'm not going to complain too much about the wording. I feel like more people know about the term homonym than homophone anyway...
---
change out everything except bond. self care is the worst healing perk, it's much better to find someone else to heal you using bond, bring a medkit or run inner strength. Urban evasion is only useful against hag and trapper, it's just bad otherwise. personally, I like lightweight but I prefer something like iron will if I'm trying to remain stealthy.
---
No problem
---
You are a rank 4 and you need to disconnect against a 16?
---
Stealth killers can no longer have their auras revealed while using their power but still trigger spine chill. Mikey was buffed and nerfed: he has Undetectable in T1 so no killer radius but he now sets off spine chill. 
---
Also, spine chill helps against spirit.
---
Me too. I like SO MUCH about the game, but I often quit out of it feeling.. Well, not good. For me the general toxicity within the game is a big contributing factor.
---
Nope but congrats on finishing
---
tomorrow.
---
sorry That‚Äôs what I meant, thats why it wouldnt work together cuz the endurance would give you deep wound, unless its MOM
---
Would you mind elaborating on that? I would say that a portion of the community refusing to play an aspect of the game is a symptom of a bad mechanic within the game and considering that it's typically a DC on sight if a player dcs against a spirit it likely isn't just one add on. I think it's relatively clear that the spirit has issues. Sure the players dcing are whiney and should probably just take their lumps but that isn't what is happening and it's hurting the fun of the game for everyone.
---
Him just not showing up is the second best possibility, really. I completely lose interest if the lore is just "everything is terrible all the time forever" with nothing to work towards or look forward to. The only way he'd be acceptable as a Killer is if his announcement comes with a Killer vs. Killer mode announcement, and they've said they won't make one.
---
Just remove prayer beads
---
i just think its more important than nerfing spirit if they do a big nerf which i kinda doubt
---
Legion's mori is great. It's legion themselves who suck
---
What is your sensitivity at? On console it has to be high so you can quickly turn to the survivors and smack them. I personally have it at around 80%. Play around with it and choose whatever you like.
---
Also, if you play Nurse you have to make sure your fps are high. The more you play the game, the more the fps drop. I personally restart the game every 2-3 games to keep the fps high. You don‚Äôt have to restart the console, just the game. This is only for console btw, not really a pc problem.
---
Other than that, you‚Äôre doing pretty well (from what I saw). Many people think that Nurse is unplayable on console but she‚Äôs the same as pc once you get used to her. It‚Äôs definitely harder to learn her but not impossible
---
You sound like a below average PC player looking for some console guys to stomp because they have a massive hardware disadvantage
---
Well, I still have 4 more killer archive things to do, but I made it to the end several days ago. And, I don't play a lot of killer. But, thanks :)
---
2 days ago i bought a drawpad.If i can learn draw on it i will upload new works)

I don't know, I kinda like the offering. There's something satisfying about it being a somewhat rare occurrence that putting it in the base kit would destroy

Very true.

Cant wait to get this build together.

Right, so incline high. Focus on 8-9 and things should tighten up at reds, meaning only major issues would need special attention.

I mean youre drawing already looks good so i think you will do great :)
---
Yep the shack!
---
yes i agree but when a killer decides to go to 3 close to each other gens at the start of the match and waits. thats not on the survivors
---
You said it yourself: DBD is about time management. How do you buy yourself time? By regressing gens and stalling using perks like Pop goes the Weasel, Ruin, Thanatophobia or Dying Light. These perks are meta because they buy you time. I said the *main priority* is to defend gens, I did **NOT** say it is the only thing you should be doing. Killing survivors will come naturally and shouldn't be the main focus as by patrolling gens you naturally encounter survivors. Read before you post please.
---
changing the rarity does nothing, people who have them stocked up still have them and will continue to not use them, and now it just is a massive bloodpoint waste for the same effect, especially if its on the path you need to take and cant avoid it.
---
Should just do a BP refund of all moris and put the yellow mori baseline into the game.
---
Their Mori's are identical. I don't blame the devs since they are literally 2/3 of the OG killers that were here since release so the devs probably didn't think too much of Mori's at the time, even Hillbilly's is rather simplistic. I feel Trappers can use an obvious update of throwing a trap down in front of the survivor then slowly pushing their head into it with a bit of struggle from the survivor only to have it ultimately snap shut on their head, killing them.
---
I think Wraiths can be unique in pulling the survivor into tue spirit world in some fashion as well.
---
Enduring spirit fury is hardly the meta anymore. Literally Pop goes the Weasel is the new meta and sometimes Infectious Fright. Spirit fury became a little dull when everyone started throwing pallets early to play around them not even camping pallets for stuns
---
If the console steering's good, I don't know why he wouldn't be popular. I just assumed sticks made it very awkward.
---
To quote myself:
---
&gt;I personally think that the ease of tracking is a bigger issue with Spirit but I do agree that the lack of feedback for 95% of her actions is a big issue. Spirit only has **five** total animations: walking, attacking, breaking a pallet, carrying a survivor, and hooking a survivor. She doesn't have an animation when she uses her power, when she starts using her power, when she cancels her power, when her power recharges... fuck she doesn't have a *vaulting* animation.
---
&gt;There's a certain degree of educated guesswork you can do (if she just finished a long phase she probably can't do it again for awhile) but this is thrown massively out of whack with add-ons. This is also why Spirit without add-ons is so strong: you have no way of knowing what add-ons she's using with the exception of the movement speed out of phase add-ons and Prayer Beads. Contrast this with for example Trapper: if he sets a lot of traps without picking up more he has bag add-ons, faster setting = an add-on, slower disarm is also an add-on... Yes you won't know if he has Serrated Jaws or Rusted Jaws until you step into a trap but not knowing "if the trap causes a debuff" is a far cry from not knowing "the entire power."
---
&gt;I still think the ease of tracking is a bigger issue, as it takes what little skill is required with Spirit and completely removes it. But I don't understand why people say she needs to be able to hear pained grunts when she's the only Killer who has thousands of mindgames built into her base kit.
---
The collapse needs a shorter timer
---
Maybe facecamp, or just hating the plague so much
---
*runs killer whole match and leaves instantly because you did all the work, resulting in 1 person dying*
---
Immersed Claud in chat post match: Trash survivor you didnt do anything all game, that's why your points are so low. I did all the gens and the killer only found me once. I died on first hook even though I did all the work. Ghostface is so Overpowered ü§¨
---
Exactly.
---
I see a lot of spirit and ghost at red ranks but few billys
---
I don‚Äôt have the switch version but I‚Äôve heard people complain about some awful wait times on both killer and survivor.
---
I can prepare to exams....but i think drawing is better)
---
Exactly, spirit mains acting like shes balanced when its literally a one sided chase after you're injured. She can even take stridor to counter iron will, she HAS NO counters.
---
Because it takes a minimal amount of skill to play nurse - people don‚Äôt like that
---
Surivor: we shouldn‚Äôt have to run a perk to counter a killer
---
Killer: running ruin for 3 years to counter gen speed
---
&gt; Rank 8 is obvious no need to comment
---
what is wrong with you
---
My God man, I know you spelled Strength wrong, but even the meme doesn't make sense! It looks like the Spirit's strength is already leaking and therefore getting worse on it's own. Why would the community attempt to stop that!
---
What "cosmetic rework" are you talking about?
---
He keeps the sword as a Survivor, though. Easy fix.
---
Okay but what if the alchemist is her father?
---
The only way I enjoy this sub is browsing by new. Obviously you're going to still see some of the dumbass memes but at least you're also see some of the more interesting discussions that never get upvoted enough to show up in hot.
---
I've had tons of close calls and I've never been grabbed when the killer was right on hatch as I'm falling in
---
as someone who plays PC with a controller
---
LOL
---
Bo0b3: Today I shall play immersed.
---
Killers: Is this some kind of personal attack or something?
---
That's a potential option, though it would be a weird one. That would also disadvantage killers because survivors can get keys from chests while killers would only be able to get them from the rift. Then if you remove keys from boxes it's just making perks like plunders weaker and removing a potential clutch play. There's a fine line between rare and too rare that I'm trying to walk with this suggestion and I worry that yours might be on the wrong side of it
---
I don't think it did get fixed I've seen it done in the past few weeks on PC
---
I don't have issues with killer being a power role, when I play killer vs survivors that are worse than me it's not an issue. However, if survivors are better than me I shouldn't be able to kill them instantly "because I'm in the power role". 
---
Spirit effectively has a m1 + 15 seconds down. Lots of characters have one shots, but it takes conditions to meet them. Spirits one shot condition is: 
---
1) have power up
---
2) be close
---
3) wait 10 seconds
---
If the survivor doesn't have iron will there isn't much they can do to stop this. Even Billy (who you say is unfun), has tons of ways you can interact with and in most cases can juke. If the Billy is able to land a saw on you, barring lag, he outplayed you. If the spirit injured you and you don't have iron will, you're pretty fucked.
---
Right.
---
I'm only upvoting this because of the broken english
---
Who knows mayby if you focus more on drawing you might even make money of in the future you never know right
---
But Nurse was top before and still took skill.
---
If you think the Nurse is "unusable", you're tapped from all directions.
---
So you don't see the word nerf in your text?
---
If he‚Äôs a surivor then if he‚Äôs killer by spirit then spirit is put to rest because she is only a spirit because of her vengeance
---
No thats dumb
---
My mind may be playing tricks on me, but I do remember the devs mentioning some changes to the cosmetics system that could make Bunny Feng possible? That was in late 2018, iirc.
---
Wait... the busty, raspy voiced, punk milf?  Chasing and killing survivors?
---
I can only get so erect.
---
That's why he's been in the top 3 most-picked Killers at high-ranks for years, right? That's why solo-queing as a Survivor against him is basically a guaranteed L?? The bias is so strong. And why? Billy is just a dumber version of Leatherface, weapons and all, yet he makes the character he was clearly based on look like a chump. Seriously, if you think being able to loop a Killer is all that's needed for them to be balanced, you have no place demanding nerfs or buffs. Some players like to play the game using more than one bland strategy.
---
Lol shit I didnt realize
---
Haha, you're a fucking idiot. I'm a PS4 player who has only been playing for a couple months and just want a larger player base. But good guess there buddy. I'm also not afraid of a challenge like apparently all the other console players are.
---
OH BOY WHO'S READY TO RANK DEDICATED SERVERS AS VERY NEGATIVE? :D
---
He'd have a perk where he starts the game injured, passively loses a health state occasionally, but gets to move faster
---
Poor killers they're always the victims.
---
Ahh I thought you were going to say sepertimeal
---
I already have 2 ways to earn money.
---
1)I make pictures for friend
---
2)I learn little Russians kid english language
---
And he‚Äôll yes I‚Äôm a fan
---
I did this experiment earlier this week maybe 3-4 nights ago.
---
Yea, there are good games and bad ones. I just need to figure out how to kill people a lot faster. It seems like it takes me forever to kill people at times. And I don't always want to bring a mori with me. Maybe devour hope and find a perk build that helps with slowing the game. I have one on the Legion, but not with her yet.
---
Which icon pack is that?
---
It's the worst healing perk. It's like giving the killer a free 40 seconds where they don't have to worry about that survivor doing gens. If you want to heal yourself during a match, bring a medkit, bond or inner strength.
---
Killer mains did the exact same thing with DS,BT,exhaustion,maps and instablinds which were all neccessary nerfs but now that the survivors call out bullshit killers havenurse used to be completely broken,spirit lacks reliable counterplay,some killer sdd ons are ridiculous people are all complaining
---
This wouldn't really affect those who don't use them. All it would change would be how often people that insist on running these items/offerings get a chance to do so. In fact, it would limit BP waste on people that don't use them by making them less common in the bloodweb, so it's really a win either way.
---
YES! Legion add-ons are so lackluster now that I barely see the reason to use anything besides the ones that reduce the cooldown.
---
Then how do you counter her?
---
It‚Äôs been removed as far as I can tell
---
The only thing that‚Äôs needs to be changed about Freddy is he can fake a gen so good that he will appear to survivors and then cancel it and not actually be there.
---
Sounds like a good use for sure
---
Me and a Friend tested in Custom Games and it only applies the addon you put in the first slot. If you put the syringe in the first spot you will get the syringe effect and if you put the syptic first then it will give you the syptic effect. This could be wrong but that‚Äôs what we found
---
It is nice that you can make money doing something you love to do not everyone can say that
---
I actually had to take a break from playing killer. I used my Beyerdynamic DT-770s at the time (high end studio monitor headphones). Now for most games, and before the Unreal engine update, they were fantastic due to the sheer frequency range (down to 5hz and up to 30khz). Everything was crystal clear even through the chase music.
---
However, every sound and music clip was being smashed through heavy limiting after the engine update, an extreme form of compression. This caused the in game music to not only drown out other sound sources, but also distort heavily on the low end itself due to being ALREADY run through studio post-mastering. I ended up actually getting headaches and nausea from how bad the audio was. I ended up maining survivor and not using headphones.
---
Thankfully it's all been fixed and I can play killer again. Still, because of that I've switched to HyperX Cloud Alphas for gaming, which are much lower quality but less sensitive to poor audio output. They also provide support for 7.1 surround which works particularly well on Spirit.
---
Gonna love people insulting their favorite game's devs but keep buying dlcs and playing the game.
---
uh oh
---
If you want to get people down faster as Nurse, use Infectious Fright and MYC. They are her strongest perks by far. Other than that it‚Äôs just practice
---
What is this place?
---
Look at the news in game
---
All good
---
I love learn english,but i have 1 problem.I hate kids(
---
Better on doctor, he has addons to increase terror radius also and has always a default 32 m terror radius, myers has this only on tier 3
---
I meant its still really good, still can be used not as powerful as before bc its not but I agreed w the rest of the post
---
Making them less common does not reduce the frustration though and thats the main problem with them.
---
Knowing that it took him 10 levels to obtain the mori to ruin 4 survivors gameplay rather then 5 means nothing.
---
The collision would even nerf the beads because you're not guaranteed what part of the gen they're on.
---
i guess you have to do the double killer exploit to fulfill this ritual
---
True true that is fair
---
There's a few shitheads out there, but I don't think the majority of them are guilty of camping without frustration being the reason
---
It's the same reason survivors toxic and are BM(At least I think that's why) - They get camped, tunneled, slugged or slapped with noed after a game where they otherwise ran the killer around for 3 minutes before said killer gave up
---
Very few people exclusively play camping because that's the 'Fun' way to play
---
Are you just going to keep commenting that sentence or are you going to actually respond
---
That would be awesome
---
I face camped as nurse because it was an altruistic team which meant easy 180 seconds of chase(fuck that daily btw)
---
Ive since dropped spine chill again and you're right,more enjoyable. Also lraves room for another 2nd chance perk. Totes betta without it
---
I flaired it with shitpoast/meme. That alone should've been a good indicator
---
It only takes two good spews(or doing an infected gen) to get you sick again and by cleansing you gave the killer a huge upgrade to her power that she can choose when to use.
---
Because nothing you do as a survivor matters against a good spirit. You can only try to guess right and that's not very interactive or fun :)
---
You disagree with the point of the post then
---
Thats fair but I already run spine chill a lot of times just bc its a decent perk. It helps against a lot more than just prayer beads spirit
---
man forgot to switch accounts lol
---
Relatable. 
---
17 Scratched Mirrors, but no Game, L√©ry's, or Hawkins Offerings.
---
It was during a live stream....not sure which one, but I remember this too. They said something about having to rework the cosmetic system because the bunny ears would be fucky. Something like that. Your mind definitely isn't playing tricks on you. LOL!
---
"Just use both then" üòÇüòÇ
---
I mean, we got the whole store cosmetic system, so I don't really know what they would rework.
---
Man I love a good int3r4ct video. His killer videos really helped me up my game.
---
I mean I do disagree bc the purple one isnt better than the pink one except in a few niche circumstances.
---
If you don't 4K as Spirit it's a complete user problem lol.
---
maybe with an add-on, but base kit? no
---
Which is why I proposed a change to mori's as well. I know firsthand how a mori and a key can ruin a game.
---
Well, good news is I'm not going crazy.
---
Bad news is we ain't got no bunny Feng yet :(
---
1. Trapper
---
2. Spirit
---
4. Billy
---
5. Huntress
---
I just hate having to constantly be paranoid about traps in loops when I'm playing against a Trapper
---
he is gonna say the cheap argument abour using iron will not realizing stridor totally counters it
---
depends on map and the plague's build imo
---
I thought we couldn't grab you anymore and no I'm confused. You've sown the seeds of doubt!
---
Billy is not fun to play against imo. He's obnoxious as hell, and will shred through solo-querers like paper. Yes, I mainly solo-queue. Looping him is pointless if your team is mediocre. He'll down everyone in minutes. Spirit is only a problem when she has Prayer Beads, but other than that, I have fun facing her. Billy (and Michael Myers) just frustrate me to no end. Billy more so though, because he has no cooldowns whatsoever, and he's just a dumb character with a ballsack glued to his face.
---
Just remove collision, then the skill cap goes up and you can counterplay at pallets.
---
If you give her a phasing que in terror radius then she's very bullyable.
---
Collision is what makes her a bit too hard to counter
---
First a new face, then more cosmetics!
---
Actually I had this happen to me while playing killer in pregame lobby somebody messaged me asking for my rank and then stating he saw my platinum trophy and was scared. No idea how the survivor pulled this off though.
---
&gt;On the other hand, being able to unlock teachables and then simply level one survivor up to 50+ and just instantly get perks there is a HUGE help for newer players. With killers you need to unlock each good perk on each killer, but with survivors I can just level them to 30-40 depending on which teachables I want and then have one dedicated Survivor that I unlock everything on and just instantly add those teachables to him.
---
Agreed. I love this about Survivors.
---
Also I used to think Survivors should have some in-built ability to make them unique but eventually 2 or 3 would become meta and you wouldn't see anything else. I like them being skins.
---
I bought it 'cause everyone loved Ash, and I liked his silly quotes. Then I later watched the show, and Ash is now nearly fully perked P3 with shorts, a bloody torso and ashy slashy
---
He's just a man who enjoys his job.
---
Don‚Äôt give them ideas
---
I would use this if I had coulraphobia
---
The fact there are users here like you who believe the game SHOULDN'T be balanced around high skill play is scary and is exactly the reason the devs should ignore this subreddit altogether. 
---
Billy is the only perfectly balanced killer in the game (except maybe Huntress) - and I'm talking in terms of BASE KIT here. His default high map pressure still abides by map geometry unlike the Nurse, and you can SEE him and don't have to play a guessing game to win chases against him like you do against *good* Spirits. Plus, you can force Billy to M1 half the time if you're good at looping and pathing.
---
Yeah, I suppose I never thought of Chests. Seems like something that might need more thought and doesn't have a simple solution. P.T.B. worthy changes would need to be tested.
---
Give me the option and I would use it
---
I think dat da killer that counterpallets bad!!1 üòéüòé
---
Same here
---
If you die in the entity you just come back cant be put to rest if her vengeance is never complete
---
This is priceless, happens all the time
---
Did my part
---
They stated that you would have one be useful; if the killer his you then the endurance from styptic would be useful, but if the killer tries to avoid that then you get the full heal
---
Exactly! Thank you!
---
&gt; Not to mention Demogorgon was buffed after launch
---
Being able to shred pallets isn't a buff to his power. it's just fun. it makes almost no difference
---
Ikr lol, Freddy will probs end up on the chopping block of we need something to whine about.
---
H A G
---
Right, so you‚Äôre a noob that doesn‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about then - got it
---
On Myers? Probably not. Overwhelming Presence is also just terrible. I'd probably change that out.
---
Nah that got patched with the update.
---
BHVR are taking a weirdly aggressive stance on little tricks like this. The one of swinging over the Bedlam Preschool hole was patched. Boyo-tech as patched. Space Billy was patched.
---
It seems BHVR's future vision of DBD is a game without any technical knowledge at all beyond the explicit perks and abilities of Survivors/Killers, which is a damn shame. This game really needs the technical depth, because it has so little of everything else.
---
I bought him for Flip-Flop like a complete fucking buffoon, then I watched the movies and an episode of the show and now I'm just like you üò©üí¶
---
&gt; the short version is that you can use unpredictable patterns to mindgame her
---
that's not mindgaming.  you're going based on zero information to go in an unintuitive path, there's no mind game with zero information.
---
True but couldn't they lock it to say 30- 60 FPS in cross play lobby's to balance pc against console or am I missing something
---
Am i the only one that thinks bubbas is the best?
---
Wait .. how..
---
Then literally anyone is toxic if they have an opinion if we use your logic
---
Someone else asked this further down the thread but no timeline has been given to PS4. PC players have it and apparently so do switch players. The rest of us just have to wait.
---
It's very very map dependant. Taking the time to stand still mid chase to apply it will just result in you getting hit against a good killer unless you're at a very safe loop
---
just remove her phasing collision and make beads red and she's ok
---
I checked it off since I bought the DLC and it comes with another outfit.
---
They're asking questions about cross platform. *Yaaaaas*
---
You are speaking the language of the gods!
---
Lol you can be immersed and still help the team. Example 1 you are on a gen and the killer comes your way, you sneak away while he searches wasting time for others to do gens and then you get back on it to finish the gen. Example 2 someone gets hooked. Instead of running in and saving in the killers face you unhook when it is safe and have enough time to heal the person you unhooked. Example 3 when the last gen is done you are already near a door so you 99 it so the team can escape. The right kind of immersion doesn't make you a bad team member. I took the survey as well, seems they are bit to worried about cosmetics if you ask me.
---
Tell you what, if they gave it 16 seconds of BT effect instead of 8 I would consider it on the same level at the least. I use red syringe and heal mid chase. Heal right off the hook when tunneled or to go work on gen. I used the purple one and just lost my medkit and it did nothing bc killer left me right when I used it and even if he did I woulda ran him long enough for it to wear off unless I baited a hit but then what is the point? I agree its better against insta downs and for clutch hook saves
---
Was Nancy the entity all along?
---
It wouldn't be a challenge, it'd be a massacre. If I'm afraid because I haven't deluded myself into thinking the gap between PC and console is just some minor thing.
---
It is, but personally I'm fine with cross-platform
---
Now that Nurse and soon to be Spirit are ‚ÄúFixed‚Äù, I think Plague is next. But I swear to god if anyone complains about Billy or Freddy I will deadass uninstall
---
Need I remind you that battlepass was already half way in development when the survey about it came around, crossplay mentions about xbox and ps4 are already in the game as well, if you don't believe me, fine by me this always happens. Whether you like it or not, it will happen either way.
---
Probably
---
they said something about possibly finding a way to make it work, but i've seen people say they've since said it isn't coming, although I didn't hear/see that for myself.
---
replace fixated with quick and quiet and play full locker build
---
Very well worded.
---
Yea ok that's a good idea actually. Is this only for pc or console aswell? I play ps4 so no point waiting if it's not even for my console.
---
Im really diggin my speedoüò≠
---
Because they tested it and it was still way too strong.
---
stinky
---
&gt; Like do you honestly ignore the good Huntresses out there?
---
she has massive console playability issues
---
the rest of your post is just an irrelevant rant of gish gallop
---
oh, that doesnt even work tho, cuz the endurance only lasts 8 seconds, I guess if you got to a loop im those 8 seconds it could
---
I don't think he rage quit. He got disconnected at the start of the match, we did all 5 gens without anyone of us 3 getting downed.
---
Leave my Billy alone!
---
The fuck? Rin's father would probably be like an oni or a samurai, he wouldn't be anything like The Spirit
---
Regarding the key part, you do realise that the door closes on its own anyway right? with both SK and DK. Re:mori changes, making it death hook is a big change and makes them worthless imo. Moris advantage is to slow the game down, requiring 3+ downs of that person is already a huge ask. The only benefit to this is that it ignored DS but at that point i dont think it matters. Making it work like tombstone also would be a huge buff to it, even if it was death hook, cause now you just need 2+ downs to trigger it, though its countered by just hopping in a locker like mikey, but its still a hook if you do that. Makes it even less fun to play though, cause now you don't even get 2 extra hits before being killed
---
And the community outside the game doesn‚Äôt help. Look at the threads on this sub, people forget there‚Äôs someone else in the other side of the screen and don‚Äôt play enough of both sides
---
That‚Äôs a really good drawing of Mariah Carey
---
OK, cheers!
---
You seem to just be overestimating you're skill. Getting killed is just part of the game. It doesn't mean a Killer is broken, unless there's some sort of insta-down or spammable speed mechanic ü§î
---
Fair, but shitpost could fall into either I think. My initial comment was only trying to figure it out lol
---
That literally doesn't make sense with the story at all.
---
But he didn't kill anyone in normal state. Sounds more like the Alchemist getting desperate for juice.
---
Next in line is Billy or freddy right?
---
Absolutely, this is just a bare bones suggestion that I think is a good starting point. As with any major change there would have to be somewhat extensive testing to ensure it works as intended, because something can sound goo don paper and be ass in game
---
What the fuck does that even mean, I laugh at it every time he says it but it sounds completely random
---
Coulrophobia and distressing only really work on doctor who can have a map wide terror radius, most people will just run away and heal elsewhere if you got a normal sized one
---
That is *almost* true. There are really only 2 good things that came out of it; their sick theme song, and their mori. Actually, make that 3. Jeff Johansson (Chonky Jesus) is pretty cool.
---
step on me
---
You'd think so, but A) Entity will keep reviving him, and Rin may be okay with that since she gets to kill him more, and B) Vengenace ghosts persist after getting their revenge a lot, like Kayako and Sadako. Probably the antagonists in Fatal Frame, as well.
---
That, and they should have a visual queue for when she phases.
---
lol no Clown is S+ tier
---
if you think otherwise youre just bad
---
Right??? :(
---
Is this the new "you just posted cringe, you gonna lose subscriber"?
---
Q over Leatherfaces suit and makeup mask?? hell naw
---
I would replace head on. it's kind of useless. most killers can just mind game you out of it. maybe spine chill?
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs very vague on purpose
---
Prolly did but talent agents tend to hold up stuff... or just not pass things over at all...
---
This missing katana is just a decoy.
---
Lmao, if you juke a saw, he'll just glide across the map and snag you anyway. Alternatively, he'll rush a gen your buddies are working on and blindside them before they can get off it.
---
There is far difference in how one wields a wakizashi and a katana than there is in how one uses a butterfly knife and a kitchen knife. There's a reason samurai carried both, they're for different purposes
---
You clearly cannot follow any points I'm making, I wouldn't of made references to other things knowing you couldn't do something as basic as that. And My point remains meaning you'll just as clueless as to why I brought up nurse as how you think a killer should have completely optional powers to make things even easier. I try not to waste too much time on people like you tbh
---
For me I hate how easy it is for people to be good with spirit. If you get a pair of good headphones and now basic mechanics and tactics, you‚Äôre considered a god spirit. 
---
I like Bricky‚Äôs ideas of changing spirit. Either get rid of collision or make deafen survivors
---
Btw, I play both sides evenly
---
Is it actually possible to get 60 serums through the battle pass without buying tiers? I only just managed to get 30 today
---
I love the head cosmetic that goes with them. The goggles are great. :C
---
That would be amazing!
---
Emote?
---
Only feels awkward when a survivor is hugging you when you charge the chainsaw.
---
Other then it feels fine to me
---
I always saw it as more of a fisherman
---
Give him the speedos!
---
Seems trash to me, but it was meta at some point.
---
He returned to Twitter yesterday with a Hi
---
thank you! Glad you enjoyed it :)
---
Funny bc I usually let the end game kill me so newer killers can pip and not feel bad
---
relax issa joke
---
It would be for both I‚Äôm guessing, I play Xbox and am waiting until then to get a new survivor myself
---
So if you're injured anywhere on the entire map you insta-collapse or...during a chase?
---
Because I don't need to be spirit to locate and down injured survivors out of position.
---
It's still 50/50 if you go through a window. If you have exhaustion perks you can still get distance. If she uses up her power before she gets to you she's just a regular 110 killer until it fully comes back.
---
If you're injured you're easy to spot for any killer who can see blood stains.
---
What do you mean by bullyable? Worse case scenario that I can see happening is a pallet slam if she just walks right through while phased, the pallet slam is then of course followed by a tbagging neon nea with a flashlight as is custom in her homeland.
---
That‚Äôs a good point.  Personally I‚Äôm not going to assume it‚Äôs already a done deal, but those who agree with you have reason to do so based on BHVR‚Äôs, well, behavior.  I just hope it‚Äôs done the right way if (or when) they do.
---
No counter-play in a chase bud.
---
I know
---
Confirmed arrogant T-bagging Survivor main. Learn to play without relying on one tired strategy.
---
He probably posted this meme using Internet Explorer about 6 months ago.
---
The survey was very oddly worded at some points. 
---
I'm still not sure whether "purchased" just meant auric cells, or if it was referring to auric AND shards.
---
Yeah, that is the weakness of the combo. Somebody else already mentioned counting the eight seconds and then hitting, so you'd need to get to a loop in the time it buys.
---
That is literally the opposite of zero information. You have the information regarding usual survivor patterns, usual killer responses, and the knowledge that most people don't execute these things. Getting in her head and doing the uncommon thing is the mindgame. 
---
This is what I was talking about. People just can't understand for some reason that the Spirit has such a drastically different mindgame than other killers. Every other killer save Nurse is just "loop around X until I drop pallet or get hit". That shit doesn't work with Spirit, and that's why people get hit or die quickly, and that's precisely why, once you learn how to mindgame her, it is consistently effective.
---
You'll lose a lot, but the important thing is you have fun doing it.

cant tell if you are being stupid on purpose.
---
read my post again.
---
I just figured they meant immersed as in immersed int the story. Do you want to know more about the universe, how it was created and by who? 
---
Same way you become immersed in a book/movie or campaign mode in video games.
---
Imagine being so toxic you get everyone else a buff just to disable your BS.
---
New killer, Nancy Wheeler, confirmed.
---
These can't be taken separately. If keys get changed as I suggested then mori's need adjusted too, and vice versa. I agree that the mori changes are a little weird, but that's necessary. If you straight up nerf them to just death hook then they're pointless, but if you buff it to tombstone it's much closer to a wash. I know mori's ruin games, keys do the same thing. That's the point of the rarity changes. This is to try to make them more rare, and make them ruin the game slightly less when they are used, while still making them viable options instead of memes.
---
Your GOATED
---
The fact that survivors can see in third person is the mistake they made when creating the game in my opinion. A true horror game is in first person because you are scared of the unknown and not knowing if someone is behind your back is what makes the game scary (Myers for example).
---
Pffft.... Detectives Hunch and Plunderers... Knock it out.
---
Easy, peasy.
---
I'm very relaxed, and I know I just thought I'd take the time to clear up the misconception haha. Let me ask you on a slider how likely you are to recommend this game to others.
---
Heh)Thank youüñ§
---
I think they need to remove her collision while phasing and make it so that you can always hear while she's phasing (make prayer beads remove the sound while in heartbeat) and give her a visible vaulting animation, that would fix at least some of her issues.
---
Rin Momma
---
spirit flair
---
That clip cracks me the hell up every time
---
If the killer has no counter play that‚Äôs fine if there power isn‚Äôt broken(op)
---
*Augh...* What now??
---
I imagine they'd want to keep who they're adding a secret to build hype.
---
&gt; 10 seconds after the last totem has been cleansed, a special sound is heard for *all* players in the Trial. 
---
Not a fan of this one. There's an element of surprise when the last gen is powered to determine if the killer has NOED or not. Killer just hooked someone. Last gen goes off. Should I save them or not? Survivor has Borrowed Time, but Killer may have NOED. That means you're still in danger if you try to go for the rescue.
---
&gt; NOED is instantly shown to Survivor's HUD \[when it's revealed that killer has NOED\]. 
---
I think this would be a nice change. Mainly helpful for new players.
---
&gt; A totem counter is added to Small Game's perk icon akin to Hex: Thrill of The Hunt 
---
Makes sense. A perk for totems should have totem counters. I don't think it needs cleansing speed though. Cleansing is fast enough IMO.
---
Yeah, I suppose. I just want someone fun and unique. Added fan-service is always welcome.
---
Answer will depend on your platform and time zone. DBD tends to pick up in the evenings, and consoles have a lower population than PC.
---
I have to say that 45 minutes is excessive, and sounds like a bug more than anything else. Might be worth contacting official support, especially if you still can't get a match after creating a SWF.
---
Survivor would be impossible to play in first person
---
I don‚Äôt think alchemist will be a killer, at least not for a while. He sounds like a character who‚Äôs meant to push more lore out for other killers and daddy Yam is looking to be the first main offspring of his lore
---
i cant tell the difference
---
You cant get granbed anymore, the changed it with EGC.

I just hope he is gonna be hot

Keys dont really ruin games that much for me, the only time i feel its bullshit is when its found in a box, otherwise the person who has the key gets tunneled until hes sluggable death hook. 
---
Downed people cant open the hatch so i just keep em on the ground
---
Not at all. I actually let the last Survivor escape most of the time. I also play around with emoters, and give them freebies for being friendly (including Piggy snoot-boops).
---
Yes. Some streamers are already over Tier 40, and the second page of the Tome is about to drop and give us more Rift boosts.
---
its sorta like a pig mori mixed with hag, minus the cannibalism
---
Gotta love one of the top reasons the survey has for why you'd stop playing the game is that the community is toxic.
---
Oh lol it probably means that yeah. I didn‚Äôt read the sentence fully it seems. Bad use of immersed in a survey if you ask me but you‚Äôre right

Watch the technique fingers and you find difference)

Can't tell if you are being stupid on purpose.

I'm saying it's about more than just M&amp;K, on console certain maps and killers absolutely tank the frame rate.

Damn, new Sonic actually looks good. The movie‚Äôs gonna suck, but at least Sonic doesn‚Äôt look like a Five Nights at Freddy‚Äôs reject.
---
I'm probably on the minority that plays with a controller on PC, and I have no issues with cross-play. Maybe it's because I play the game for fun instead of competitively. (I play both sides)
---
done!
---
1. Its wasting everyone but the killer's times. In that 40+ seconds (depending on add ons and perks), you arent doing anything to help your team
---
2. You have a useless or detrimental perk depending on the killer. Self care is instantly useless against Legion, Plague, Bubba, Hillbilly, and potentially Myers and Ghostface. If the killer has nurse's calling, they can just smack you down anytime they see you, and when you figure out they have it, you'll probably be running to a corner to use it, wasting even more time for your team.
---
3. It encourages selfish gameplay. Imagine this: You and your teammate are working on the third gen, killer just hooks someone and walks straight over to you, he hits you and you speed off, he then kicks the gen with PGTW, then chases your teammate that was on the gen with you. You're probably healing now, while youre healing, that gen has instantly regressed 25% plus the near 40 seconds your heal takes. If you happened to tap the gen to revert the regressing, that gen isnt regressing but is getting no work for that 40ish seconds.
---
4. Nobody really heals at higher ranks because they expect you to have Adrenaline. They usually will heal you if youve been tunneled or youre at 3 gens left, but when theres no gens done or one gen left, you arent going to get healed since its a waste of everybody's time.
---
Overall, Self Care is every killer's dream. It can lead to a collected 2+ minutes of 0 progress at once if everybody decides to use it. If you want to heal, bring a medkit.
---
*White ranks FTFY
---
Uhhhhh, yes?
---
Lmaoo this is too good. Survivors finally understand the struggle of having to be forced to run a perk to stand a chance and they hate it. The irony is delicious
---
they look exactly identical to the in game icons good job :)
---
~~Please tell me this means Quentin is finally going to not look like a gremlin.~~
---
&gt; Rin "disarmed" him
---
Idk man, I think her dad did a better job disarming her
---
This comment section is making fun of survivors complaining about killers based on their power level even if they were weak. I gave an example of how it‚Äôs not about that. Even the meme is making fun of survivors complaining about strong killers.
---
Exactly. The stupid ass streamers are dragging this game down, as is the case with so many others...
---
Overwhelming is pretty useless against everything but flashlights. I wouldn't use caulrophobia either. They all rely on terror radius which can be avoided by just waiting until youre gone. This would work on massive terror radius doc but not Myers.
---
These are so freaking good wtf
---
I mean syringe isnt half bad though, can prolong chases for team, as long as u can lose em for 5 seconds to use it then make em chase u until it heals you up then u can now take 1 more hit after making the killer think hes almost had you
---
What if we got a "what if" chapter with both, like what if the entity *had* taken rin's father and we also get and alt !rin as a survivor. Personally that's what I'm hoping for
---
Dang
---
I'm literally a killer main - ruin is also bullshit.
---
Glad we all pay taxes so millenials like you can go loiter in school and make nothing of yourselves. 
---
Bet the thought never occurred to you to do this AFTER school, instead of video games.
---
Sad commentary.
---
&gt; as someone who plays PC with a controller
---
&gt; as someone who plays PC
---
&gt; ***PLAYS PC***
---
learn how to read
---
THEN ENLIGHTEN AND EXPLAIN HOW TO GO AGINST HER
---
Well wtf is the OP on about
---
Depends how it's done. Sometimes you can make friends with the killer with a well executed butt dance
---
He was just trying to make sushi and mistook his daughter for a salmon. God I hate when I accidentally filet my daughters!
---
What‚Äôs the link to this survey?
---
Issue is that sometimes you can't see the key. Maybe it's a console thing, but I literally can't see the key unless we're both memeing two feet away from eachother. Plus it could be a broken key. besides, feeling the need to slug because they have a key is due to it being particularly unfun to deal with, right? The point of this is to make it so that people don't need to dislike keys or tunnel people for having a key, try to make them a bit more balanced. Same with mori's
---
You heard it here first. After Spirit. Freddys going to be targeted next lol
---
*With iridescent head.
---
Working with the killer is bannable, so there's always the risk of one party sending the messages to BHVR and earning the other person a ticket to the penalty box.
---
Dunno it‚Äôs probably old and he doesn‚Äôt know.
---
We need The Disposable Assassin NOW
---
Steve is the sht! he brings a lot of morale to the group üòÅ
---
I would argue quickly eliminating a player is in fact stalling gen progress. Because now there is an entire player removed from doing gens. Patrolling gens is very important yes, but someone getting unhooked in your face isn‚Äôt the time to go out on patrol.
---
Never go a game without it.
---
As a surv main, I am fine MoM got a nerf. I just wish it wasnt such a harsh one, they have to make it useable bc right now its just to bad
---
Wish I had your mindset, I hate versing Spirit. For me, the only scary thing about her is her complete lack of counterplay
---
Done
---
Yeah because the Freddy map rework is *sooo* good.
---
Had a Demogorgon try to charge across a pit in The Game while he was chasing me and I snorted from laughing not gonna lie it had been awhile since I saw that attempted.
---
"Well, they didn't outright gut her. The changes could've been far worse."
---
That's not an argument. The point is, only her addons needed tweaks. Her phasing was fine, and even weak for console players (thank the unnecessary camera slowdown).
---
and now me xD
---
Now I wanna give that a try myself. It sounds rather good.
---
That was beautiful
---
Apparently it's too easy for her to find players and too hard to know when she's phasing.
---
Shit....... Fellow Ghostface and Freddy mains. We gotta go incognito now
---
I live in Russia,relax.But i laugh a lot about your taxes story hah)
---
P.S you make my day broüñ§
---
Congrats on missing the point.
---
Don't forget that you're stuck staring at the ground the entire time, and actually landing hits on console is asinine.
---
Expected from someone who likes ‚ÄúMangoes‚Äù.
---
Bruh get gud if you have to relay on only top tier killers
---
Why do people think spirit is betrer than nurse?
---
Did you see Quentin‚Äôs actor contacted BHVR about getting his face fixed? Lol
---
BHVR tweeted a [gif](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1193908271784120320?s=09)
---
I really hope they fix her she‚Äôs such an awesome character but her gameplay for both sides is just frustrating and awful. Idk what they can do but maybe if staying sick for long enough downed you or gave exhausted/a speed debuff and she only got corrupt once every pool was used up? I just hope it‚Äôs more than they did for legion which is change him without admitting the entire power needs to be changed like Freddy.
---
Could have been worded way better.
---
I assume you're saying that you would recommend DbD to a friend so you don't have to wait in a lobby of randoms (where one is likely to DC?)
---
This message will not get across in your message.
---
"Fix your servers and lobby/host issues" with a score of 0 would have sent a message to get it fixed.
---
Wait did I miss something? Boobless woman?
---
1 out of 10 protection hits like that actually registers. You have to be healing someone on the ground and take a hit or take a hit while killer is carrying someone.
---
I'll lump both your replies into 1 for simplicity:
---
You can pretend all the strong killer builds aren't capable of halting or ending matches outright, but that doesn't stop them from existing.
---
Hawkins has benefits for survivors and all killers. All the LoS blockers allow for stealth killers to shine, most pallets are mindgameable, there are still long hallways for easy LoS moments for Huntress, totem spawns are hidden, there are still several strong structures a good survivor can potentially waste time on. Along with much more, I wouldn't say it's the best map overall, but it has elements all parties can take advantage of.
---
Shred breaking pallets is no different from the chainsaws, it forces early pallet drops, makes the survivor run the loop overall less times, and the shred in general makes some of the strongest loops (biggest example being killer shack) a lot weaker.
---
They reworked Badham and are looking to rework other maps, leaks suggest Haddonfield and swamp or coming sometime soon.
---
And yes the literally got rid of insta heals, especially the syringe which instantly gave you 2 health states on use. Stronger survivor perks have been tweaked while both weaker killer and survivor perks are slowly becoming buffed.
---
Acting like "uh no 4man SWF destroy me in 10 seconds every single match I play unless I'm omega blink nurse, insta saw billy, prayer beads spirit or iri head huntress" is the norm doesn't actually make it the norm.
---
Nice extrapolation :)
---
My only regret is that I couldn't be more specific about why I generally dislike the game.
---
r00d. You deserve it for being mean. Not everyone has top notch headphones unlike you.
---
I like that you named it "possible hacks". Never seen a glitch like that, and if it happens 3 times, then I think it's safe to say definite hacks
---
To be fair, prayer beads are pretty darn busted.
---
I play on console. Try it, and see.
---
For me it's less about her strength and more about how much I hate going against her. She's like a fun straw, with me being a fun drink. She just sucks it all up.
---
What if they replaced the terror radius with something less obvious? Do you feel scared vs. Ghostface?
---
Okay killer main
---
Iron will and Urban are the hard counters. Ive noticed if I watch my movement and avoid grass I can hold her off long enough for a gen or 2 to pop
---
Doesnt it work when killer is carrying someone and taking a hit at the hook when saving as well? Serious question I dont actually know
---
There were a shit ton more trees added when Ghostface came out. I guess to "help" him be more sneaky, but all it did was fuck over huntress
---
Pretty bad build, but i guess it works on console..everything works there
---
Bruh just Rancor so you also get murder.
---
Im rank 9 and game matches me with red ranks.
---
Also tho if you don‚Äôt cleanse against a plague that good then you‚Äôre just a 1 hit the whole game so I mean
---
 New meme format right here
---
Be honest with it guys.
---
Okay yeah I know I thought you were saying because some PC players handicap themselves by playing with an inferior control method that somehow console players can compete with PC players.
---
Like, if not then what purpose does your post have?
---
Just letting me know you use a controller?
---
I mean, neato, good for you buddy? I guess?
---
The Survivors were idiots. They farmed their teammate (unhooking while the Killer is very close) and you just did the logical thing. They don't get to blame you for that, especially since they didn't bring Borrowed Time to protect anyone they unhook.
---
In celsius or fahrenheit?
---
Spicy my dude.
---
It‚Äôs clearly not. The point of a multiplayer game is to have fun for both sides. People do not like relying on pure luck or feeling helpless. Some people do but the majority clearly don‚Äôt like this.An example being the amount of DC‚Äôs back when legion came out
---
Not on PS4 he's not.
---
All I get is him and Spirit.
---
Bro this is such a shit rework tbh
---
Of course. There we go. So you couldn't possibly understand having a PC frequency of good Nurses or Huntresses. Your opinion is useless. Console is the lowest common denominator and all balance should be focused around high rank PC play. I'm not saying you can't have fun, but the game does not needed to be balanced around what you think it needs to be balanced around.
---
I'm not particularly interested, "my dude".
---
Haah
---
&gt; This comment section is making fun of survivors complaining about killers based on their power level even if they were weak.
---
Because you do. All the fucking time. Just because there was one previous time this wasn't the case doesn't change that fact.
---
be happy they are even responding, our devs are just: **\[Radio Silence\]**
---
Seriously.....stop.
---
His teleport &amp; cooldown is already slow enough
---
I don't think he needs to be changed. It's just the most unfun experience in the game.
---
Well you cant wait too long but if you turn sharply he will have to stop.  But if hes not sprinting he‚Äôs exactly like every other killer.  Leaving spirit and nurse the only killers that survivors have to change their chase behavior for.
---
Passives would be exciting, but could get pretty ugly from a meta standpoint. A single slip-up like "Gain 2% Haste after completing a gen" would have everyone running the same character optimized to abuse that power.
---
At least you get SOME variety, I haven't gotten anything but a spirit for the last 2 weeks
---
I think Billy just has the issue of some maps just making his power useless, inside maps along with just areas with lots of windows just turn him into an M1 killer and kind of act as safe zones where he can‚Äôt chase you unless he‚Äôs willing to waste 3 minutes getting looped
---
Oh, it doesn't prevent a loss. It's just salty. At most, it spites the other players.
---
Any add-ons. Boosted.
---
I'm sorry, but if you think Billy is braindead easy you've never played Billy. Spirit with a decent headset is about 10 times easier.
---
I think they get my point
---
&gt;See, this all makes me wonder if you‚Äôre just not good as spirit. Especially the whole ‚Äúcan‚Äôt hear footsteps or breathing‚Äù part. If you have decent headphones and average hearing you can easily hear footsteps while phasing from a surprising distance, and breathing is pretty noticeable within a few meters too.
---
Welp, I don't have 200$ headphones I guess. I can hear them only if pretty close otherwise I won't hear breathing while phasing that easily. **while phasing** is the key part
---
&gt;You‚Äôre right that changing things to fit the casual masses in some pvp games is a terrible idea, but that doesn‚Äôt apply here. This isn‚Äôt a competitive pvp game, it‚Äôs designed to be a casual game.
---
Still competitive. Especially after twitch rivals that cannot be said, and could've not been said before either since is PVP, therefore competitive to me. Anything is competitive as long as there is a player v player environment. Even smash was meant as casual, still meant as casual from it's devs, but is on Evo every year, so the excuse that's "casual" doesn't mean much imo.
---
&gt;Another issue is the way you compare her to nurse. Nurse is at a similar strength, but that‚Äôs really where the comparisons end because their chases are completely different. It‚Äôs like comparing a queen and a knight, they‚Äôre fundamentally different even if both are strong. The queen (nurse) takes a straight path in any direction (including through walls in the case of the nurse) while the knight takes a weird path. Likewise with spirit, she‚Äôs not confined to a straight line and can‚Äôt pass through walls. You don‚Äôt loop a nurse because she blinks through pallets, you have to loop a spirit because she can take any path and smack you if there‚Äôs nothing between you. You can‚Äôt compare chase dynamics between them, you might as well compare nurse to wraith at that point.
---
I see your point but mine was that spirit and nurse, unlike other killers, to buy time, you have to play differently. That's it. Something many people doesn't do, that's my point. They try to loop her like any m1 killer while you have to try different approach, something that I like about her since is very satisfying to juke her when you notice she **has to** phase to catch you. There, you have the chance to throw her off, put her ability on CD and play a jungle gym, for example.
---
&gt;Faking a vault is semi effective on a long wall tile, but otherwise is pretty pointless. And even then she just stops phasing and chases you normally, so the hit comes a few seconds later than otherwise, unless it comes sooner because she used the speed boost to catch you. Run in a straight line and then do wonky scratch mark things is a great idea on paper, but worthless in game. As soon as scratchmarks disappear she just stops phasing and catches up with the speedboost because you lost so much distance by walking. 
---
You say doesn't work in game. Every example I bring up are stuff I do in game tho. I break line of sight while abusing the fact she is blind when I have a decent distance from her. As I said, I find it unbelievable how many people in this sub find her so hard to counter when they have more hours into the game than me
---
Isn't difficult, she might even lose you just by doing that, or at least waste a lot of time gaining distance. There are tons of footage about it, just look how people counter spirit, isn't impossible or "unfair". I just run, she's 110% so she either phase or takes forever to reach me while people do gens. When she stops she's phasing, there I just try to hide or gain some distance taking a direction where there's a pallet/vault or if I'm already on one, fast vault and go back. I cannot explain every single example in existence, is like explain every mindgame there is to make a point. It will take an eternity
---
&gt;As soon as scratchmarks disappear she just stops phasing and catches up with the speedboost because you lost so much distance by walking. I understand that the point is to waste time, but where‚Äôs the fun in that? The counterplay for a killer shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúhope your teammates do gens‚Äù because that‚Äôs simply not practical, you never know what they‚Äôre gonna do. It‚Äôs not an emblem thing either, a lot of people who deserve to be at red ranks don‚Äôt want to sit on a gen all game, and rightfully so since it‚Äôs so boring
---
Wait.. the point isn't to waste time? What it is then? Win a 1v1 in an asymmetrical game and lose her? Because I will totally disagree on that. What's the fun? The chase itself, juke her, fuk with the opponent head and buy more time than they have to chase you. Still, any killer will eventually get you, if wasn't like this, why even bother play killer if every single survivor can 1v1 you?
---
Isn't practical to make killer chase you wasting as much time as possible and rely on a **team** as the **numerous role**? I really don't understand
---
I agree that do gens are boring but that's the objective and do a gen takes 80s, isn't that long. I had games that lasted 3min, it wasn't fun for the killer I suppose as isn't fun to me loop a safe pallet because I cannot do anything else using any other killer that's not nurse or spirit. So what?
---
&gt;I do think that a glass effect when phasing would be a nice touch, though I wonder if that might even make her too weak. I honestly believe that they might need to take her power back to the drawing board and rebuild it like Freddy, because it‚Äôs fundamentally unbalanced and simultaneously riding a knife‚Äôs edge between strong and weak.
---
After the work they have put on her, and they showed it on a dev stream in details, I won't do that at all. Not even try just out of respect of their work to make a grudgeish like killer. She was meant to be like that, not be visible with the drawback of not see anything but scratch marks. I'm not that entitled to ask to rework her completely to cater towards newbie tbh.
---
A nice change that will maybe keep quiet the people who won't adapt? Make Survivors sounds unilateral, so she won't pin point their position. That's it, it's the best change I can think of (except prayer ofc. It has to be changed somehow) so, people maybe will actually stop screaming that she's too easy to pick up, just make her skillcap higher
---
&gt;Not buying the DLC just for the king of horror
---
Imbecile
---
Bill need the Left 4 Dead Beta outfit, I would get that.
---
Her nerf should just be fixing what's already broken instead of a rework, her dad should be a Survivor so she can have revenge, and she's currently fun to play despite a lot of people hating playing against her.
---
It is coming back soon but likely not until the next killer/big update
---
There are plenty of people who mori legacy survivors and twitch streamers
---
Nope, it's not bad at all. Honestly find it easier with controller, kinda like racing games
---
Waiting at the exit gate isn't ALWAYS toxic if you at least give the killer a hit or two before you leave. Crouching at the exit gate, on the other hand, is always toxic.
---
*cough cough* pig *cough cough*
---
Honestly there's a few games I get in the higher ranks where they don't care about totems at all. It just depends on the team you're up against.
---
I just started running prem and so far i like it. I guess ill have to give chill a shot.
---
No one knew it was getting nerfed when it came out. It actually did take them quite a while to nerf it.
---
You can get corrupt by going to a used pool. If every pool is used you get corrupt immediately but all pools will reset.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it meant auric cells because you can‚Äôt buy shards. You unlock stuff with shards, not purchase.
---
The complaints outside of Prayer Beads are from salty Survivor mains who are mad they can't bully characters like Spirit and (previously) Nurse. They want their endless loop strategy to be completely foolproof, allowing them to taunt the Killer at the exit every match, before collecting their 20th Escape in a row. Spirit has audio and visual cues for her ability. Survivors can strategically place themselves in places that throw her off, since she can't see them. They can plant themselves by a pallet, scatter their scratch marks, or wait for her to appear, before immediately running, causing her to miss an attack. Prayer Beads are the only questionable addons because they allow Spirit to teleport without any warnings. Removing that ability would make her completely fair IMO. Survivor gameplay desperately needs more variation, and characters like Spirit can really shift the meta, and make more perks viable.
---
As Survivor, I'll die on hook if I get a hopeless start.
---
As Killer, I only DC if I get to rob really toxic people of the satisfaction of bullying me.
---
I believe they‚Äôre required to make it optional on certain platforms to be able to add it at all.
---
Why not just use the entire outfit?
---
So you want something like [this](https://youtu.be/EV8CzzaNLAc?t=147) for his mori? Mainly the last bit.
---
It's great for a meme end game build. NOED, bitter murmur, blood warden, and then a random perk of your choice can be fun if you aren't focused on winning.
---
I...I know?... I was giving ideas as to how her power should work to be less frustrating for both sides lol.
---
While I totally see what you're saying in a way I also just think it would be silly. Can you imagine doing a gen in first person? It's boring enough holding m1 but being forced to look directly at a gen 1cm from your face for that long would be stupid.
---
Spirit has counterplay tho, just learn how they normally play, learn her mindgames and how to not fall for them. The only thing broken about her is that she can just bump into survivors accidentally and get a free hit because of it, that and prayer beads isn‚Äôt a pink add-on.
---
I love how lore wise claudette is just a person studying plants but shes now the face of toxicity in dbd
---
You know that this game is pegi18 right?
---
I'd say the amount of PC players who use controllers tell me you are overly scared.
---
We‚Äôd need some fundamental changes to the game if we want more killers to be viable at high ranks. Top tier killers all have one thing in common: map pressure. Spirit, Nurse, Freddy, and Billy are capable of getting to you from across the map with very little issue (other than on maps like Hawkin‚Äôs or L√©ry‚Äôs). Huntress doesn‚Äôt have to be near you to hurt you. 
---
Generators are done too fast and too easily for killers like Pig, Plague, Doctor, etc. to ever stand a chance without some MAJOR buffs. And unfortunately, the severity of the buffs they‚Äôd need probably wouldn‚Äôt be good for the game. It‚Äôd be better for everyone as a whole if the matches didn‚Äôt end in 4 minutes without Ruin (and sometimes with!).
---
Hopefully we get cross platform soon. These queue times are becoming too long at high ranks
---
I'd personally really like to see his tank top from [Payday's No Mercy cameo.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RCbIGTABD38/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
Well...there is gen camping, not the way most whiners think of it, but there is, and it's more the fault of gen spawn locations than the killer.
---
When 3 gens spawn particularly close to each other, and the killer is running pop or thanataphobia, camping those 3 gens from start to finish is extremely effective. Forcing the survivors off those gens and into a gen lock is viable, and annoying to play against, especially when you're facing a killer with high mobility.
---
Um ok?
---
They're not gonna do all this just to tease a balance patch. They didn't even tease Freddys rework
---
But those were the addons, which could have been changed separately, right?
---
Aura blindness bruh
---
I‚Äôm pretty certain cross play will be a thing in about a year. Dedicated servers will make it much easier for them to accomplish stuff like cross play and cross progression, so when the dedicated servers are fully functional then it shouldn‚Äôt be too long of a wait.
---
just make spine chill a passive for every survivor lmao
---
Stridor actually f's me up trying to locate injured survivors.
---
Get out of rank 15
---
I don't like closing a book on the spot.
---
If only we could browse the store or archives in queue.
---
I don't feel scared, but I do enjoy the tension it adds.
---
You think I'm a PC player who just wants to stomp console players but you're obviously just a console player who is scared to lose their precious rank. Besides there are plenty of PC players that use controller so you are absolutely wrong here.
---
I always thought so, but maybe that's just because my dumb ass usually ended up running directly into the Killer when I heard the heartbeat get really close.
---
Usually games that do have cross play across platforms are opt-in, so you can decide yourself if you want it or not.
---
Holy shit..its Kim Jong Un!
---
I completed every challenge in the first week, and have just been waiting for the next batch
---
Here come the toxic survivor mains
---
Its the best it could find, its that or no game at all.
---
But that's about status, not lore.
---
Wow that's pathetic
---
Forgot to switch account mate?
---
That would serve them right.
---
 \*\\ A Plague main sweats nervously \*
---
Nobody is saying some Killers couldn't use nerfs, but in most cases, the required nerfs are minor. In Spirit's case, Prayer Beads is the only issue. Without that addon, Survivors are notified when she phases. Looping is a cheap and tired strategy that desperately needs alternatives.
---
Didn't the devs say it was the entity that drove him to kill Rin and it was going to make him a killer until it changed its mind and took Rin instead?
---
I play on PC on steam. My friend just got the game on PC but through xbox game pass. Can we play together? How do we add each other and join a lobby together if so?
---
Not even a hunterss main and play her without addons but iri head is the only "op" addon. Correct me if im wrong.
---
It takes a certain skill to even be able to draw but you my friend. You don't just *have* the skills, you utilize and practice. Great job
---
&gt; You can pretend all the strong killer builds aren't capable of halting or ending matches outright, but that doesn't stop them from existing.
---
I have no clue what you're even referring to
---
&gt; Hawkins has benefits for survivors and all killers. All the LoS blockers allow for stealth killers to shine, most pallets are mindgameable, there are still long hallways for easy LoS moments for Huntress, totem spawns are hidden, there are still several strong structures a good survivor can potentially waste time on. Along with much more, I wouldn't say it's the best map overall, but it has elements all parties can take advantage of.
---
It literally only has two maybe three areas in the map good for survivors, and only if they have BL. Totems are nearly impossible to fine, even with Small Game
---
&gt; Shred breaking pallets is no different from the chainsaws, it forces early pallet drops, makes the survivor run the loop overall less times, and the shred in general makes some of the strongest loops (biggest example being killer shack) a lot weaker.
---
Uh, no. For starters because shred is infinitely weaker than Billy's saw. Secondly, it's anti-looping potential is nearly non existent and only dipshit survivors will drop the pallet early out of fear of Shred. It is only decent in the shack if the gen isn't in there. If there is, Shred won't do shit. Shred is still one of the easiest abilities to dodge in the game
---
&gt; They reworked Badham and are looking to rework other maps, leaks suggest Haddonfield and swamp or coming sometime soon.
---
abloobloobloo this has no substance to it whatsoever and the new bBdham maps are problematic for survivors and the overall realm is still really unfair to Huntress 
---
&gt; And yes the literally got rid of insta heals, especially the syringe which instantly gave you 2 health states on use. 
---
instas were not "strong survivor tools." They were utterly busted mechanics. Complaining about that change in order to make survivors look like little victims is pathetic
---
&gt; Acting like "uh no 4man SWF destroy me in 10 seconds every single match I play unless I'm omega blink nurse, insta saw billy, prayer beads spirit or iri head huntress" is the norm doesn't actually make it the norm.
---
And you top it off with a huge fucking straw man fucking epic
---
I‚Äôd switch your killer. Myers really doesn‚Äôt need to counter healing. I‚Äôd suggest using the Doctor or Legion if you‚Äôre running anti-heals.
---
The ‚ÄúWho needs ruin when you have a bruisin‚Äù Legion
---
1. Distressing (Because killer instinct is based on terror radius)
---
2. Sloppy Butcher
---
3. Nurse‚Äôs Calling
---
4. Dying Light (It‚Äôs better than Thanatophobia)
---
Addons: Filthy Blade and Etched Ruler 
---
Dr. Abduul ‚ÄúTouched From afar‚Äù Jafar
---
1. Distressing 
---
2. Coulrophobia
---
3. Unnerving Presence 
---
4. Infectious Fright
---
Addons: High Stim Electrode and ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù
---
(Really good on small maps)
---
Ok mate
---
Get the fuck out.  Really?
---
never said anything is OP
---
that your argument is invalid because i can play as good as PC players.
---
hell most streamers comment its EASIER to 360 with a controller.
---
Killer is harder because of how you have to pin point for things, which is why Nurse and Huntress are hard for controller users.
---
100% sensitivity isnt 'cheating' or whatever you were pissing and moaning about, it allows us to move around faster to make Nurse and huntress more viable. 
---
~~also, just pointing at something is easier than aiming with a controller. so you are actually a scrub in that regard taking the easy way out~~
---
I dont think it should be a base thing for killers, but am totally fine with 2 hooks and then death
---
Especially when it‚Äôs on the exit gate, survivors crawl out and get pulled back in
---
*nO cOunTerPlAy, shes unfair, I wanna loop her like any other m1 killer, REEEEEEEEEES*
---
The same incentive as every other killer?
---
where do you get these names
---
This is true, most are bad imo. Yew seeds, faster throws, and exhaustion are only good ones.
---
 https://youtu.be/a7_jS1XqvVg
---
I'd actually prefer to have her arm cracking before phase audible, anyway.
---
Why? That makes no sense
---
They buffed medkits massively while changing instal heals into a portable Mettle of Man, if you knew how to fucking read you'd see i specified trolling the entire 3minute collapse &amp; leaving at the very last second.
---
I still don't get why people spend 5 dollars solely for that perk
---
Dont forget the stretchy arms
---
I play Bubba at red ranks. I lost my sanity years ago.
---
I'm just glad no one really complains about Hag, probably because its your own fault for walking into a trap as a survivor, can't blame ineptness on bad game design.
---
Why would anyone NOT want cross play? Genuinely wondering
---
There is a thing called exploits and I have seen people reaching the exit before they are open.
---
I think Pennywise and Chucky are two most likely candidates for the next major license in DBD. Jason is highly unlikely as there‚Äôs still a ton of legal stuff going on with him, but I do think he will eventually be in the game, even if it‚Äôs a few years in the future.
---
Terrible reason? Lemme just copy-paste a little from Rin's Bio here.
---
 "*Her father faced a debt that grew without end. He started  working double-shifts in hopes of obtaining a promotion. That's when he  started losing sleep. A dark whisper would keep him awake all night,  reminding him of his hopeless situation. Exhausted, he started to lose  grasp of reality. Fighting to deny what the voice whispered at night,  Rin's father made a desperate move. He met with his superior and  explained his situation. He begged for a bonus, an advance,  time-off---anything.* 
---
*His request was denied. The company had launched a defective  production line that was costing them dearly. Someone had to be held  accountable and Rin's father fit the bill perfectly. He was fired after twenty-two years of service."*
---
Dude had a psychotic break from mental and emotional fatigue and getting fired to be used as a scapegoat, not to mention the line about "the whispers" which we all know by this point is almost always about the Entity pulling strings.
---
Meanwhile Pennywise's motivation is legit just "I'm hungry... gotta eat!". (Now I could be oversimplifying that there as it's been a while since I read the book and neither the mini-series nor the first film really got into his cosmic monster origins, and I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet.)
---
I feel that not being able to do gens for 60 seconds might be a bit harsh for simply being in his terror radius
---
That would be such a twist. I wonder how she would even look like in game, considering she was thoroughly sliced and slashed.
---
I don't like her Father, it's not a matter of sense it's a matter of my personal opinion
---
Iridescent Button is the only fun one, but it‚Äôs PINK rarity so I never get to use them :(
---
Or.. do bones
---
Against a bad spirit that doesn't learn that is a thing but after a good spirit sees you use her power 2ish times she knows what you do and can react easily Scott made a video explaining why spirit can't be countered and has another video where he goes through all the "counters" spirit has and does a few Chase's with Zubat who is probably the best dbd player out there and he downs him in like 30 second every time
---
A totem counter? Like, cleansing totems? Don't pull that "but what about solo survivors" BS, I play solo all the time and cleanse totems just fine. It has no skill checks, killers never care about dull totems, so unless you start cleansing right in front of the killer, you can really easily knock out all 5 on your own. NOED has the easiest counter in the game: break it before it activates. And even if you don't know that the killer has NOED, it's a free 1000 points.
---
well, shes not gonna have a matured mind, seeing as the only humans shes seen apart from her mother she has KILLED.
---
I‚Äôve been sitting on some Gateaus for a while now. Saving them for a special occasion (I put it in my freezer and forgot about it)
---
Moris in general suck. I've seen more gratuitous violence in Super Mario Odyssey.
---
Lol nah fam
---
yeah he did lol
---
What are the alternatives to looping also spirit tight now has 0 reliable counterplay so how does that not warrant changes
---
Everyone knew they would nerf it. Everyone. Not a single fucking person thought they would let it stay as is.
---
Thank you,i appreciate thatüñ§
---
Okay smart one, how about you learn to place yourself near palettes, or take advantage of windows? Looping needs to be made obsolete. It's a cheap exploit that the devs didn't foresee, and now the entire balance of the game revolves around it. Many Survivor mains are just salty that their "foolproof" strategy isn't viable against certain characters.
---
Oh that makes more sense
---
This. Taking it a little further though, I'd say nobody "asked" for Rin's Father because none of us thought BHVR would actually bring in a Killer that has a link to another Killer, especially not such a close/heavy link. Now that the idea has been floated a bunch, I think it'd actually be really cool to have.
---
Not really. Pre-gutting, Legion was still considered the worst killer in the game. It was just that their power exploits guarenteed you would down someone. It took a really long time though, so generators would all be done by the time you finished your second down. 
---
A case of being fundamentally broken rather than too strong.
---
May I ask why? As a console player I would love to play against people on the pc.
---
Bill: Am I a joke to you?
---
Nice work!  I like it too!
---
Hahaha THE SPOOOON
---
Finger lickin good.
---
I love to play against the spirit, however playing against a killer with ultra rare addon+mori with 3 random guy in my team is really painfull. 
---
I always thought they should remove all addon and balance each killer stats. Addons just unbalance everything.  Same goes for the survivors.
---
Appealing to players that prefer fun over sweat is always a good idea. The mindset you have has led to nothing but restrictions and lack of player choice.
---
So do I, and we would get some more lore for her
---
Ah, ya know what, I'm gonna dodge this one...
---
I know, the truth hurts.
---
Fantastic work
---
They're both Japanese with Japanese weapons, clearly they're the same exact thing!
---
I main Billy on ps4 and his auto aim is just silly sometimes. He's still very good
---
How can someone who previously murdered be a killer?  It just doesn‚Äôt add up.  He‚Äôs already corrupted like all the other KILLERS.
---
One of the unsaid rules for the game is that survivors are allowed to proactively and reactively attempt to slow down or confuse the killer. While killers are often given ways to snowball the game by predicting survivors movements and getting quick downs.
---
*Proactive examples:*
---
Against Legion, survivors can spread out to make it harder for Legion to get value from his Frenzy.
---
Against Doctor, survivors can eat an early tier 1 madness as to not give the Doctor a free way to find them later.
---
Against Freddy/Trapper, survivors can eat traps (or fake pallets) when he is chasing someone else.
---
Against Hag, survivors can run through her web when she is carrying a survivor.
---
Against instadowns, survivors can hide or position themselves near windows to fast vault.
---
*Reactive examples:*
---
When a killer camps a hook, survivors react by doing gens.
---
When a Nurse finds you, you can juke her by watching where she is looking. (Nurse's can then react to this by flicking their camera. Which you then can juke by heading IN the direction she is looking. It's all about being unpredictable.)
---
When normal m1 killers first find you, you can play it safe and loop normally. Or you can take risks to mindgame and read the killer based on your observations, extending loops and saving pallets.
---
Against Pig, she can use her roar to scare survivors off loops, or commit to the lunge and try to make survivors juke into her hit. They can then try to guess how good the pig is and can either walk/run away, or call her bluff. (This is an example of a healthy mindgame. ***Both sides*** are taking a risk here and expect the other to do something. Both sides can be punished.)
---
A more general example of a healthy mindgame is killers choosing when and where to show their red stain (such as at the killer shack window loop). Survivors can read the killers moonwalk, and juke the window. If the killer thinks the survivor will juke the window, they can hide their red stain and commit, either getting a hit because the survivor slow vaulted or forcing a pallet drop (and maybe a hit if the killer is lucky). If the survivor thinks the killer will commit, they can vault the window and be safe. ***Noone complains about killers using their stain to be unpredictable. Survivors are fine with guessing being a factor in a chase.***
---
The problem comes when *all you do is guess*. That's where Spirit comes in. You cannot react to Spirit because she has no vault animation, no consistent way to know if she is phasing, she passively phases making her exact location difficult to know, and she can bump into you while you can't see her. I won't even mention Prayer Beads beside here. Yes, you can guess right multiple times in a row. But how likely are you to win an unfavoured dice roll every 10 seconds?
---
Proactively, you can attempt to ***"counter"*** her by running Spine Chill and Iron Will (which Spirit can counter using Stridor, something that's already good on her). I put emphasis on "counter" because it's yet another dice roll, and not an actual strategy. You are putting on perks, hoping to go against a Spirit without Stridor, and all the perks do is make the dice roll move to be even/slightly in your favor.
---
Noone gives a shit about a killer being strong. If we did, we would complain about Nurse. Yet, oh wait, no one does. No one complained about base kit Nurse (meaning no add ons) before the nerf, either. Survivors try to tell killers this, but they won't listen because it doesn't fit their stereotypical strawman of entitled survivors. Survivors WANT strong killers. But we also want FAIR killers. Nurse is strong and fair. If you successfully juke her, you get multiple seconds where she can't do anything. Huntress is also strong (on her good maps) and still fair (when hotboxes aren't broken). A really good Huntress or Nurse can absolutely destroy survivors, but noone complains because they know they were outskilled.
---
Yes, survivors may find certain killers annoying, but no survivor with half a brain wants any of them nerfed. I find Doctor, Hag, Trapper, and Bubba to be extremely annoying (for various reasons. The main one being that in my experience, most people playing these killers proxy camp all game). Do I think they should be nerfed? No way in hell.
---
I don't really know how to end this. So this is it.
---
They didn't even tease Freddy. It'd be incredibly tone deaf even by BHVRs standards to do all this cryptic teasing just to build up to Spirit's phasing not having collision anymore
---
Oh for real I didn‚Äôt even know about that I gotta go look
---
I don't mean for this to come off a "le pc mustard race console gamers dumb" but I know it's going to because there's really no way to elaborate this point without it sounding like that:
---
It's usually console players who don't want PC-Console crossplay. They know that PC having access to better hardware and M+KB being better for shooters/first person games puts PC players at an advantage most of the time just by virtue of the game running better and being easier to control, so they don't want to be put in the PC matchmaking pool a lot of the time. It's not as big a deal in DbD as it would be in, say, Call of Duty or Counter-Strike, but for some killers like Nurse and Huntress M+KB offers a significant advantage over a controller, which means those killers aren't usually seen that often on console. Throwing PC Nurses and Huntresses into the system for Xbox/PS4 players would throw them for a loop, most likely.
---
&gt;Lmao, if you juke a phase, she'll just phase across the map and snag you anyway. Alternatively, she'll rush a gen your buddies are working on, and blindside them before they can react. Nevermind also having addons that erase your phase sounds.
---
see how that works? you're far too angry about this, my dude. it hasn't even been confirmed that she's being reworked or nerfed. some people just think she's unfun to play against and the community picked up the meme per usual.
---
Shes been hated since she was released. People are more vocal now because nurse was overpowered since the day she came out, but was nerfed into only being incredibly good. If they nerf spirit nobody is going to call other killers OP. Billy has been essentially the same since launch and nobody calls him OP. Its because you can actually counter his power. You have pretty much no agency playing against spirit, whether or not you survive depends entirely on whether shes a fucking idiot or has a brain.
---
Well I already see a bunch of comments in thread discussing Rin's father that they'd love to mori him. I cant say much for a fact but I'd be surprised if you could escape a single trial against a spirit as Mr Yamaoka
---
It seems weird then that you‚Äôd point to console as proof that her rework killed her. We could never play her because of the framerate and slow turning speeds. 
---
Nerfing her base power was unnecessary but the add-on rework was fantastic. ALL killers should have ones like her. Add-ons like Legion‚Äôs and Pig‚Äôs, which just change some numerical values or apply mangled/hemorrhage/blindness for 50 seconds, are extremely boring. Nurse‚Äôs can change her power in a really cool and fun way.
---
Why is Sonic baeby now (I agree with this meme)
---
NUDE MYERS
---
What's wrong with trapper?
---
Remove all the killers! Let's just repair generators and open gates. Best game ever.
---
Oh we love seeing these posts a million times over.
---
You don't need 200$ headphones to hear breathing while phasing, I do it just fine with my beaten up 60 dollar turtle beach recon's, you just need more practice.
---
For this to be balanced as if it were a competitive game would require a complete overhaul as too much of it is simply map rng. The focus shouldn't ever be to cater to some competitive elite, it should always be to make the game more fun for the most people possible.
---
The problem with this comparison between nurse and spirit is that what you're saying doesn't actually work against competent spirits. If you leave the pallet they end phase early and catch you before you make it to the next tile, so you have to try to loop her. That doesn't mean you should always stay at every pallet, because that doesn't work either. But you do need to try to play the tile until she phases at least, and then hope that while you're sneaking away she doesn't notice or end her phase early.
---
I say it doesn't work in game because I've tested it from both sides. Against any competent spirit you can't juke her with scratchmarks because they'll just end phase and catch you with the speedboost. I've tried this as survivor and it doesn't work, I've also had this tried against me as spirit and it doesn't work. 
---
I didn't say the point isn't to waste time, I actually specifically said that that IS the point just that it isn't particularly fun. It's kinda like old legion where once you got chased you were like, "welp, nothing I can do that will stop me from going down, just waste time I guess." There should always be a way to win a chase as survivor by outplaying an opponent, that simply doesn't happen with spirit.
---
regardless of the effort put forth in making spirit's power, it still needs changed. The devs also spent a lot of time making old Freddy's power, it still sucked. I respect the work they put in and I know they tried to make something very coo, but it doesn't work so it needs fixed.
---
Make sounds omnidirectional? Are you an idiot? That's a direct nerf to every killer in the game, and I really don't think the devs could make it work for phase only, sounds are already broken every other patch.
---
Frankly, I don't think you really know what you're talking about. None of your points stand up to any scrutiny and you seem to lack some basic reading comprehension skills on top of it.
---
When it comes to balance, they are most of the tiem.
---
You know nothing about him though, he hasn't been revealed yet
---
What? We don‚Äôt play Spirit/Billy only at red ranks because it‚Äôs what we want, it‚Äôs because playing Pig/Wraith/Legion will guarantee you get destroyed in 5 minutes. Probably even quicker if you don‚Äôt have Ruin or they find it too fast.
---
They did the same thing with the Killer list, like yes I love all the Nightmare cosmetics
---
Your originality is stifling.
---
How do you get to this survey?
---
I wouldn't mind seeing some small nerfs to his chains addons.
---
Mori
---
HOW DARE YOU SUBMIT TO THIS SUBREDDIT? jk
---
I love goblin Quentin, I am against a face rework if I lose him
---
You'd still have the ability to move your head to the side and see things to your left, right, and depending how far back, things behind you.
---
I play console and I think anyone who is intimidated by playing against PC just needs to git gud and quit whining. Think of all the benefits!
---
*Sad doggo noises*
---
What would the nun's power even be?
---
I don‚Äôt think they do DLC perks until the next DLC comes out
---
What is a tome?
---
Uh, massive shout out to whoever included the Non-binary option for gender; that was a bit of inclusivity I wasn't expecting today.
---
I really like this survey, hoping it'll provide some good info for BHVR so anyone who can, please do it!
---
I have a picture on my phone of when I played as a rank 20 trapper, they set me up against red and purple rankers
---
https://youtu.be/3sYSt26kh6Y
---
That was an exploit, but I'm talking about moonwalking to not trigger a chase
---
I thought the Halloween event ends tomorrow so we wouldn't be able to use serums to buy cosmetics
---
I‚Äôm convinced this is a console thing. Never happened to me on PC.
---
Yep, on Twitter
---
Lol says the level 17 Bubba main.
---
I vaguely remember reading that rins dad cut off her mom's tiddies
---
Well tbh they've already done that; Bloodlust and Entity window blocking are two universal skills that help either get a hit in or force survivors to leave a given loop.
---
Honestly while I'd hate it as a survivor, maybe giving killers a smaller PGTW effect after hooks? First gen kicked after a hook automatically regresses an extra 5% (this doesn't stack with other effects like PGTW) if they kick within 15 seconds of hooking or something. It wouldn't be as powerful or as large a window to use as PGTW, but it could definitely help buy some extra time if killers get regular regression+ 5% immediately.
---
Thoughts? Not sure what other way they could add universal skills. The other two deal with Loops, but the reall issue with killers seems to be gens popping too quickly - maybe this could help alleviate that?
---
Obviously you still have to kick a gen and take time for that so it doesn't go well with Surge or whatnot, but it's something yeah?
---
Yeah you got me man, well done
---
I hope this is there way of saying they‚Äôll get cosmetics
---
well then i think devour hope should get a buff then requires 4 token instead of 5 to get to suvivors
---
I see you know how the system works too.
---
The people that are worse are the people that wait at the exit and dont let you get a hit
---
Playing against a pc nurse as a console survivor would be hell. Console is harder to use than pc by a long shot (generally speaking) and pc killers would likely be seen as "op" just bc they have easier controls, which isn't something they have any control over.
---
I'd like cross play between xbox and ps4. Not console and pc.

If pc does get cross play to console, I'll be happy either way. It's a good idea. Except for the killer situation.

I love how people call what she does "mindgames". She either pretends to use her power and hits you, or uses her power and hits you. Its literally a 50/50 chance whether or not you guess what shes doing. Survivors hate her because you literally have to rely on her fucking up or being stupid in order to escape.
---
No to Nun. No to Chucky. I would live Hannibal the cannibal as a killer the most. The rest are fine
---
Quentin needs a pajama outfit
---
What are we looking at here? Killers are allowed to be a difference of 6 ranks +/- survivors. Nothing wrong with ranks in this shot.
---
Awesome work! I would be interested in comics as well.

I'd **love** to hear your ideas. Let me guess, Freddy should be visible at all times, and the dream mechanic should be scrapped?

Where is my Quentin face re work and and Speedo???

What really ruins fun for me in this game is Hex: Ruin. Wish there'd be a skill rating in the survey.

And they didn't even kill him cause they went psycho, they got scared and acted irrationally which led to the janitor dying.
---
Before that they were just a bunch of dumb teens causing havoc but never anything crazy like murder.

---
What exactly is special about that map?
---
I think he actually talked through the logic and explain actions. He even said some dumb things like a gen can be done by one person in 40 seconds. That is absolutely false. 
---
Tru also completely ignored impacts of map pressure when you have someone down. You don‚Äôt need to look for survivors as much when someone is down or on a hook. 
---
Regardless l, Tru completely ignored the main problem that Scott and many others have said: there is no active counterplay other than guessing when to walk, run, or vault. That is the real issue, not whether randomly changing your guesses can work.
---
Spirit has no tell of where she is or what she is doing when she uses her power. That makes it impossible to actively make decisions as a survivor based on observed actions by a killer. Sure, you can guess to run a bit and double back or walk in a different direction, but that is a guess. It may work, it may not. You have no way of telling if Spirit is chasing you or if the player is taking a bite out of a sandwich. 
---
Every single other killer has tells that let survivors actively avoid getting hit by making split second reactions. Spirit does not give you that chance because she was designed to not give indications. She doesn‚Äôt even have a vaulting animations. 
---
That is the issue. Every one of Tru‚Äôs statements comes down to guesses and not actual reactions. 
---
From watching Tru‚Äôs video, and you point me to any place in which he says how to react to her, not a best guess on what to do?
---
Except for the information revealed in Rin's backstory where he slaughtered her and her mother because he was fired after being made into a scapegoat for his company because he was in debt.
---
But like sure, we know nothing about him.
---
You're a piece of shit if you proxy camp hooks and play like a bitch.
---
also one of the complaints for this game is that the hooks kill survivors not the killers it could cure that.
---
I do think it should be two hooks and then tombstone if you brought a mori. Base kit would make this too strong, no tombstone makes it completely pointless.
---
Another survey where they aren't going to publish the results and are just going to do what they were already going to do regardless of the results (hey guys would you like a battlepass? No? Well we were going to release it a few weeks from now anywhere so too bad).
---
Pass.
---
That first trailer Sonic would make a great addition to the cast of Killers in DbD.
---
Also if the saviour is better at hiding than the victim there is no way that I will stop pursuing the victim!
---
Being bad at the game, you?
---
That‚Äôs as fair as it gets in this game lol
---
That's not a good idea. And the issue wouldn't be the tokens part, just that it would make it pointless. It would save you like one hook state and be far less satisfying in the process, not nearly strong enough to justify being a hex perk either
---
Holy shit a survivor player that has a brain hold up im going to go play the lottery.
---
No it was a response to the guy above _sparQ_ but it didn‚Äôt post as a reply to his even though I clicked on it. Sorry for the confusion
---
I've never heard that complaint.
---
So thematically this is cool and I applaud your effort, however for gameplay this would not really work all that well.
---
correct me if I'm wrong but she couldn't even use ds. U have 3 stacks on bbq and 3 are dead. so how can she ds you if u never hooked her?
---
This is gold.
---
What was Boyo tech?
---
lol they aren't going to touch Fred after the initial fiasco with him
---
I find I do like 3 genes and my teammates don't do any :(
---
Than someone dies.
---
Iri heads a perfectly balanced for me cause I never hit any of my hatchets anyways
---
I bought ghost face and I love it hes just an m1 killer but he‚Äôs really fun to play im rank 7 now and he‚Äôs still kinda viable if you have the Tru3 build or close to it.
---
Im so glad otz gets as much recognition as he does in the dbd community. Ive followed his channel since the dark souls videos, but the community never seemed to appreciate how good of a content creator he was then
---
My only issue would be people using Nurse on PC vs console. My system still shits itself while teleporting (or getting bloodlust stacks in a chase as any killer)
---
I‚Äôd suggest some tweaks to her, but a complete nerf to everything in her kit seems too extreme
---
I don‚Äôt understand how people aren‚Äôt seeing this. It‚Äôs like they get upset if they can‚Äôt win every single match.
---
We can only hope
---
Strong killers are not a problem at all. I would actually love to see stronger killers. It becomes a problem when skillful play is removed from one side. In this case, the survivor‚Äôs skill is irrelevant when playing spirit. You just guess and hope you don‚Äôt get hit. It‚Äôs a single player game at that point.
---
Michael has 3 tiers of his power. Tier 1 he has no terror radius or red stain. He stalks to tier up, tier 2 is a 16m terror radius. Tier 3 is a oneshot ability with an increased lunge, vaulting speed and 32m terror radius. He can only stalk each survivor so much though.
---
Ghostface can go into stealth and will only leave stealth if he attacks, gets stunned or gets revealed, then it's on cooldown for 30 seconds . While in stealth, he can stalk and expose a survivor, the exposed lasts for 45 seconds. He has no limit to how much he can stalk a survivor. 
---
I prefer ghostface over myers personally.
---
Gruesome Gateu is a point offering, not a map offering. It was avaliable in the bloodwebs during the 3rd anniverary.
---
haha thanks so much! That mystery has been bothering me for awhile.
---
You do know the devs are going to absolutely destroy her harder than her dad did right?
---
Do something you love and you'll never work a day in your life
---
it wouldnt need to be 100% of the time. repairing gens needs to be fleshed out in general. like maybe a limited camera view so you can only see a certain angle aroudn the generator, while still hearing the terror radius.
---
Survivors should also go into first person view while in a locker. it really helps create a sense of tension in games that do that. 
---
come think of it, I dont know any game that allows you to hide in lockers without forcing you into a first person view, it's actually unreasonable to allow third person view of the area while you're completely invisible to the enemy. that would really defeat the purpose of it in those other games.
---
Ooh gotcha thanks!
---
Bullshit. Base nurse was overpowered from day one. If you knew how to play her and had ruin you'd win. All they did was take away her even more ridiculous add ons. Nurse has always been bullshit.
---
I don't know, I'm pretty sure the Trapper would rather be Dwight's key holder...
---
;D
---
Honestly I kind of agree, it's just people don't want to have to learn how to play against new playstyles and killers they haven't seen before. Survivor with analog sticks have a _slight_ tradeoff with kbm players as well. Mouse lets you look around faster and more accurately, but movement on sticks lets you 360 killers significantly easier.
---
*sad oink noises*
---
Because unless the Spirit is just bad, she is going to essentially win every chase in 30 seconds. Her counter-play relies strictly on her messing up.
---
I like to headcanon that Susie is the most brutal and unhinged of the Legion after their start of darkness. Makes watching her preform a mori even more satisfying.
---
I would replace overwhelming presence with unnerving presence or thanatophobia.
---
I was hopeful from pennywise and chucky. In my opinion Rin's father dlc very unnecessary. I think that this list will create more excitement, isn't it?
---
5 survivors
---
Wait, do you mean that we aren‚Äôt supposed to be complaining about a killer that SHOULD be overpowered and scary.  After all this is a horror game. Well.....
---
Frank did
---
Gotcha! I can completely understand why some people would not be for that.
---
Some matches it goes like that. Sometimes it seems like you're the only one doing gens while 1 person gets chased and 2 people are wasting time hook bombing and failing flashlight saves.
---
People don't realize that double hooks in the same area of the map almost instantly lose the game for survivors. Especially as a stealth killer who can bypass borrowed time, ruining any chances of unhooking someone without another person going down.
---
I wonder what they could do to let it keep its power while changing it? Deep wounds?
---
Very old. There used to be brown/yellow Map offerings. That's one of 'em.
---
I never even used the word sensitivity lad, and I have no idea what you're going on about. And I certainly don't play on PC or with a M&amp;K.
---
My argument is that a combination of M&amp;K and FPS makes PC-Console crossplay unviable. And I'm sorry but some guy coming up and claiming he's just as good with a controller doesn't invalidate anything.
---
Ah I didn‚Äôt even catch that!
---
I have one account on here

Who was flickering the lights?
---
I don‚Äôt think OP knows what a slasher is
---
Noob is alright, he isn't as good as fungoose, AaronsPlaysTV, etc, but he's entertaining atleast.
---
And she had a high skill ceiling. If you spent hours on practicing her you would be really good. Its easy to juke a bad nurse
---
this logic is so bad. coming from fortnite where they've implemented this its made console players at a SEVERE disadvantage. saying git gud doesnt solve this. theyre different systems they shouldnt mesh
---
As a P3 Quentin, I concurr. He is my Goblin Babe.  But...I'd also love me some Gallner.
---
I don‚Äôt think they aren‚Äôt seeing it I think they just don‚Äôt care as long as it doesn‚Äôt effect them but eventually it will. It already is to a degree I play killer and find a match in a heartbeat but survivors always say ‚Äúwow im in a queue for 20 minutes just to get lobby dodged‚Äù or something like that but they don‚Äôt realize that they did it to themselves because they have blinders on
---
I'm for it, but some reasons I've heard from my friends is the change in performance between them and controls. Mainly, the difference of controller vs. Mouse and Keyboard.
---
Okay elitist. I've got a better idea. How about different versions of the game recieve different tweaks?
---
I know, crazy, right??!
---
Also, catering to high-level play is one of the easiest traps devs fall into. Try-hards will ALWAYS search for exploits. There's no stopping that, and no amount of balancing will change it. Fun and player engagement should always be the highest priority. Otherwise, a game just becomes a glorified math problem, with very few variables. Even new players should still be able to have fun without a Billy flying across the map every other game, wiping them in two minutes because they and their team doesn't have meta perk builds, and knowledge of looping. I miss the days when games were made to be purely for entertainment. Now, they're designed around arrogant streamers and "pro-leagues".
---
Shoulda made it bitch and bitch because why not bitch, it‚Äôs Freddy‚Äôs catchphrase, you bitch!
---
One of the devs said on his stream that Iri heads are being destroyed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt invest in Insta down Huntress‚Äù were his exact words iirc.
---
Given that the Plague is from Babylon, so likely somewhere between 600-2000BC, and the samurai class emerged around 10th century CE, I‚Äôd say the Plague is not only definitely ancient, but also far more so than a samurai would be.
---
Oh idrk that lol
---
Mediocre, just like the movie
---
*feng
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture I see.
---
nope. But thanks you for your participation.
---
Because you can counter play freddy. Spirit has no counter play that's why people hate her. Heck you can counter any other killer more than her, you can at least see nurse
---
We‚Äôre talking about Freddy not scary terry.
---
Jockstrap myers.
---
Nurse has always been bad on console
---
I do sometimes until I run into a ghostface or piggy and am like ah shit
---
Her boobs got cut off by Mr. Yamaoka.
---
Did you guys play and see what happened?
---
Cant and wont take people seriously who think there is more than 3 or 4 killers in the entire game who are viable against an optimal 4man.
---
So instead of buffing the other 13 killers to be viable we nerf all the viable ones? Good stuff
---
Nuh-uh it's rated M for mature, which if you had used instead of PEGI would actually BTFO me, since while I'm nearly 30 I'm clearly also an immature man baby, so uh, better luck next time.
---
That is literally what i had in mind for a while
---
Cant be Vigo, the dude found Vigo's Journal and he cant be Benedict Baker because the Alchemist entered from an Opium Den whereas Ol' Baker entered from the Macmillan Estate near the Town of Weeks
---
Ah yes, we all love killers like Clown and Freddy, a disgusting incel and a literal pedophile.
---
Ok you're actually dishonest. No point arguing with you after "omnidirectional??? That's a direct Nerf on every killer!!" When was obvious I meant it on spirit while phasing only..
---
I guess with people like you I really cannot have a real discussion, at the end it's just strawman and dishonesty. you're not the first or the last who do this sht
---
I'm done with you
---
i know this is a joke but seriously guys it‚Äôs just the ‚Äúcode name‚Äù for the entire DLC (like Nepal or Oman)
---
Nerf [insert killer], I'm not having nearly as much fun playing against them as they are against me.
---
Exactly THIS.
---
This IS NOT M-SCROTE giving a fuck about us, or turning over a new leaf, or any such sappy, sentimental,  make believe bullshit.
---
This is a PR STUNT.
---
No doubt these asshats were trying to negotiate another liscense or something and their contractor was like "pfft u guys suckzzors", so now to make it LOOK like they give a fuck about their shitty game so they can suck investor balls.
---
Oh hey there, remember Exxon Valdez?

No?

How....socialist of them.
---
Enjoy your "freedom", Americans. 
---
Yes we are! 
---
See you in Court!
---
Just if you look at the difference in controls on both sides. On PC, it's a lot easier in terms of skillchecks, and playing as certain killers. Not to mention performance on PC compared to console.
---
Triggered Killer main
---
You're the same person asking for Billy who's a perfectly balanced killer to be nerfed dude.
---
Sure buddy. That's why you agreed to yourself like you were another person. Mhmh believable
---
Doing gems, you?
---
Yeah that's still dumb, even if it was working properly.
---
I play rank 1 with wraith, trapper, and ghostface. Never mastered nurse, don't really enjoy billy, and don't play spirit bc I'd rather not have players DC in the first minute of the game. Top level players kill no matter who they are using.
---
Plot twist new killer is Pre-remake sonic
---
But you hook people when playing killer anyways
---
You don't have to be a god to know to loop. The fact is there are too many shit players. This is the exact reply I expect from a casual player. Looping is an exploit? Moron.
---
Not really considering the Janitor did grab Julie or Susie, one of the girls I can't recall which, and he acted out more to protect them and himself from this sudden threat and in a moment of not thinking he stabbed the guy.
---
Not really psycho moment, more like things shouldn't habe turned out this way and we fucked up moment
---
Billy is literally labeled "easy" by the devs. Nobody gives a shit about soundwhoring Spirits. Nerf her Prayer Beads and she'll be far less toxic.
---
Believe what you want if it makes you sleep better at night.
---
The entity took the form of nancy
---
where's the guy who is not in the right position against a heavy?
---
I play survivor and killer equally. How boring would the game be if every killer were a low-tier that you could easily escape from? I think most survivor players get too butthurt whenever something is too challenging.
---
Myers is a more straightforward killer, just a basic slasher unless he's stalking to prepare for exposure. You can control his terror radius pretty easily with addons, perk, and stalking. (That said, addons transform him into something else entirely if you get bored.) He's a basic, enjoyable killer that's pretty robust.
---
He's better, in my opinion, for sudden jumpscares and exposure, since you 99% everyone and can pop it whenever you see fit. Doesn't matter if you're chasing the wrong survivor, unless you've siphoned off all their evil. In fact, you'll often stalk some unwitting, wounded survivor to use the exposure on some better, healthy survivor.
---
Myers comes with Save the Best for Last, which is great for ending chases much sooner. Dying Light can be fun as well on gen/heal slowdown builds, especially with Thanatophobia and Nurses. When I run him with Monitor and Abuse and Dead Rabbit, it's jumpscares for days.
---
Finally, he has a hospital gown.
---
Ghostface is a little more complicated, with stealth and marking and crouching. Most of the streamers I watch don't use his full kit, and even when I'm playing him I find myself neglecting certain aspects entirely. He has Thrilling Tremors which _may_ sometimes compete with BBQ (if you ignore the BP gain).
---
Ghostface can get knocked out of stealth pretty easily, I've found, including by survivors on hooks.
---
Eventually you'll probably do both, but to me Myers is more robust and straightforward. Slightly better perks. And better legs.
---
They both have abilities which expose survivors, which means they can be downed in one hit. 
---
Ghostface is more about stealth play. He can crouch and shroud himself which gets rid of his terror radius, and he can stalk a survivor to expose that player. It's more limited than Myers but it's faster.
---
Myers stalks all survivors to increase his Evil Within: 
---
EVIL WITHIN I:¬†Tremendously Decreased Terror Radius. Grants immunity to detection perks. Slightly decreased movement speed. Slightly decreased lunge.
---
EVIL WITHIN II:¬†Moderately Decreased Terror Radius. Slightly Increased movement speed. Slightly increased lunge.
---
EVIL WITHIN III:¬†Normal Terror Radius. Hit Survivors suffer from the¬†Exposed¬†Status Effect. Evil Within III lasts for 60 seconds after which its power is considerably drained.
---
It's slower but it affects all survivors.
---
Personally I'd say Myers is more powerful, especially when you start using add ons. But ultimately it's up to how you want to play the game. I'd suggest checking out the wiki and watching some videos to get a better idea :)
---
Sure nearly 30 talking like a 14yo kid. I hope you aren't really almost 30, that would be embarrassing
---
Yes.
---
Both of those are technically correct. As well as body blocking and taking a hit for another survivor. 
---
Breaking a chase with a distraction and taking a hit should count.
---
Letting a teammate get a hook save, and taking a hit for them and/or the hooked person. There's dozens of ways to get protection hits. The only issue is that 95% of them never actually register as a protection hit. It's bugged.
---
And yet the other indications she is given still make the ring one of her better addons. It‚Äôs almost like you don‚Äôt really need the scratches to play her well.
---
Your opinion is weird
---
Spirit is blue
---
These look fantastic, really authentic too. Do you take requests on which characters you'll do next?
---
This has been a suggestion for ages. 
---
It has been determined that players would most likely abuse the feature and get their fellow teammates killed, which throws the match. They won‚Äôt add it.
---
Oh my god, it would be so nice! I got pals on a different console that would love to play with but won't due to having to go through all that progress again.
---
banana hammock myers
---
Let me think. When she screams the screen goes dark for a few seconds, as if you were blind.
---
It's ALWAYS console players who jump into these discussions and have no idea what they're talking about lol
---
It's a valid reason sadly
---
Only killer I can see happening in DBD is Jack the Ripper. He was playable in games such as Assassin's Creed Syndicate and Identity V (made in collab by the DBD devs). People loved playing as him and the dlcs got amazing reception from fans. It wouldn't be fair for DBD to not add him.
---
Except Spirit can't 1HKO, unless a Hex is active. Hillbilly has 1HKO at all times, PLUS a ridiculously fast sprint that has no cooldown.
---
No proof of him raping anyone. He just killed them
---
You can't use pallets against a spirit phase the fuck? Her swing is faster than you dropping the pallet and you WILL go down.
---
Second of all you're clearly killer biased because if looping was obsolete survivors would have no way to get gens done or any way to run from the killer.
---
Killers are such cry babies, they are introducing more unsafe pallet loops and letting killers keep bloodlust with that change.
---
Looping is a fundamental part of this game, if you remove that then you might aswell remove survivors.
---
Yeah, if they kill my main killers Ghostface and Plague, I'm quitting, because they would cross the line.
---
I got them both not too long ago at the same time and swap back and forth playing them equally now. I would say I have slightly more fun with Ghostface and he's also slightly easier to get kills with. Myers is a little harder but more satisfying when you get his tier 3 instadown ability in a match. If I could only have one though I think I would choose Ghostface.
---
Just gonna ignore most of what you said and go straight to the important part, you say choosing any killer but spirit, nurse, Billy is not an auto-lose against the average team. Fair enough. But here's the thing... it IS an auto-lose against an optimally playing 4man. And since those do exist, it's pretty hard to justify playing a killer that literally loses that game the moment it begins
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dve1qp/what_are_some_things_that_you_consider_a_problem/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
That's the game man. It's a very risky strat and very easy to fail if you're easily baited. at that point it's time to change strat. You're gonna have to try baiting them out then. I hate toxic behavior like teabagging and clicking flashlights, but that's a solid way of getting them to follow you. definitely a tough spot to be in.
---
God forbid survivors complain about things that are broken in the game
---
What is the spirit nerf?
---
No they aren't survivors have been nerfed so much in a row recently and killers are such victim cry babies to realise that.
---
Forgot Pinhead and Candyman
---
A low skill floor means that a character is easy to pick up, a high skill floor means that there is difficulty to pick them up
---
A highskill ceiling means that putting effort into improving will mean you are much better than the average player/one who is just starting, a low skill ceiling is one where putting much time into proving will make little or less of an impact
---
The skillfloor/ceiling system has nothing to do with player rank in any game but rather the maximum and minimum potential any person can meet with said character
---
I'm sorry to say you are wrong in this instance
---
Love them but i kinda think Micheal look like he's smoked 500 blunt, and i love it
---
Literally nobody is asking for that all they want is some way for survivors to know when she phases whether it's grass moving or she makes a noise or something so that it's not just a guessing game
---
I met a leatherface that did this the other day. His name was "salt farm" or something like that and he literally just slugged everybody and facecamped. Then when the game ended he typed a whole bunch of insults incredibly fast, and was begging for "salt". Its sad that people like that exist.
---
Something like that would be nice
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, and I agree with you. I enjoy playing against a Non-bead spirit. Sure, I will lose chase eventually, but at least I get to be chased. 
---
One thing I see here tho are people confused between fact and their opinion. While the game is asymmetrical, it doesn‚Äôt mean one side should have all the rights or fun compared to the other side. 
---
The problem with spirit with prayer beads, at least to me, isn‚Äôt the chase. It‚Äôs not the jumpscares nor my perk selection. It‚Äôs being pulled off a generator with no warning and no real way of knowing. I guess the counter-play to that is gen tapping? 
---
But then, is that real counterplay....
---
It's where you fake an unhook on a hooked survivor, bait the Killer into thinking you're committing, wait for them to lunge at you for the interrupt, then cancelling and restarting the unhook on the side opposite to the Killer. The Killer swings into the guy getting unhooked and does no damage but is forced to eat an attack recovery, giving you enough time to complete the unhook and start running.
---
He's more than viable with a lot of different builds. As long as you get decent at leaning to stalk it's really fast. The guy is good but his build isn't the be-all end-all.
---
Found him
---
you seem like a douche
---
Most killers can already be escaped from easily. If we‚Äôre only talking about spirit, there is no reason to bring in other killers. 
---
It‚Äôs about counterplay. This game works because there‚Äôs interaction and mini games between survivors and killers. A spirit with a half decent headset eliminates this interaction. Nobody wants her nerfed because she‚Äôs strong, people want her nerfed because she‚Äôs not fun to play against.
---
Welcome to Dbd Subreddit if you say your opinion against killers in a killer main thread you get down voted. Gonna like those down votes on my post.
---
Spirit does warrant changes. Her Prayer Beads should be nerfed or removed. And you counter Spirit by camping pallets when she phases, and slamming them down when she appears. Alternatively,  you can get to windows, causing her Phase to run out before she gets to you.
---
Console killers will be at a disadvantage because the analog sensitivity is way too low. It doesn't make much of a difference for survivor either way.
---
Survivors seem to hate any killer that isn‚Äôt easily loopable haha
---
Hoping for cross play between the consoles at the very least.
---
If one of Hannibal's skins is Mads Mikkelsen, I'm in. The mori is a seven-course meal set to Partita No. 2 in D Minor. Everyone else escapes in the meanwhile, but still.
---
At higher ranks? Damn maybe im just suck then lol.
---
I really wouldn‚Äôt consider Billy to be well balanced imo. I‚Äôm a red rank killer and survivor (not that rank really matters), and I‚Äôve always felt that he‚Äôs a big problem. Nurse is very difficult to get value from without a LOT of practice, and her mistakes are extremely easy to punish. Spirit is easy, but if she makes a mistake then she‚Äôll be punished super easily as well. 
---
Billy doesn‚Äôt have that. If you mess up a chainsaw, it doesn‚Äôt matter. The ‚Äúcooldown‚Äù is nonexistent and he doesn‚Äôt have to recharge his power. Worse comes to worse, he‚Äôs 115% movement speed so he can M1 you if needed. 
---
Billy has been in the game since launch and everyone is very comfortable with him. I think he gets a pass on way too much for how much value you get from him. He‚Äôs very easy to use, very easy to get value from, and very hard to punish unless you‚Äôre in an indoor map.
---
Jake and Nea confirmed into scat
---
Yeah, that's why the perk works
---
That's what most of us want I feel like
---
The Plague is one of my mains too and Sadly I think if the Spirit gets nerfed the Plague is next. I don‚Äôt understand how survivors are complaining about the plague. Like seriously she‚Äôs so well balanced.
---
Goosebumps confirmed: Say Cheese and Die chapter
---
There's plenty of great third person horror games, it's not inhibiting.
---
The core issue is that Dead By Daylight is a game designed to be played again and again and again, in a competitive manner. That's inevitably going to erode any sense of horror.
---
Let's just say 
---
Its fucking epic
---
I remember Freddy consistently calling people bitches though in nightmare on elm street...
---
You should stick to single player games.
---
She is though because shes really just an m1  killer that gets her power if someone cleanses so if you dont cleanse shes not that strong
---
Well shit

Where‚Äôs the guy who is **also** not in the right position to be against a heavy?
---
The dc? The slug? The game?
---
Lol I'm just making a joke but thanks for the downvote lolol
---
Ahhh see that makes more sense just thought they mentioned Doc and Huntress specifically due to them not following the new add on ideology
---
I honestly put down "not scary enough" instead of "not scary at all." Because there _are_ scary killers in this game that can make you jump or be very surprised, like Myers or Ghostface.
---
I feel weird without it glad otz made a video on it
---
I am sure there are ways to work around that issue such as limiting how many times you can prevent others from unhooking you or having the Struggle Phase go down by a bit each time you use the action. I am sure other people would be able to come up with even better ideas to work around this.
---
He asked why are you running I N S I D I O U S on Billy??????????
---
Now that's immersion!
---
What I want in my heart of hearts: each Legion member gets their own Mori.
---
Thank you all for the answers! I think im buying both.
---
damn you sound even younger than 7. Read Reddit's ToS dud.
---
And what would the addons be? More blindness? I really think there's no potential for the Nun as a character, just like (as much as i hate saying it)  Jason Voorhees
---
I have fun playing against her because she‚Äôs one of the only killers who is actually able to jump scare. It is tough though, I will admit, playing against her (unless you run Iron Will). I bring other killers into this because once the spirit is nerfed then people will complain about another killer. First it was the Nurse, now Spirit, and people are already starting to whine about the Plague.
---
60 second is the maximum. Any Survivor not being chased can wake themself up with a brief animation, like curing Mangled.
---
they cant decide if they want it to be mature game or sanitized pg-13, 0 gore, body damage, very little blood despite being cut in half both vertically &amp; horizontally , disemboweled, stabbed, curb stomped, hand shoved thru their chest, axe to face, reverse bear trap, decapitation etc
---
Nah, that's bs, I turn fine to deal with 360's. If you're getting 360'd on console, turn your sensitivity up and use your brain. If you get 360'd twice, and your sensitivity is up, then it's because you aren't learning from your mistakes.
---
Complaining is literally how you change things though. If the community never complained about things then the game would hardly change at all.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm not really offended by what you‚Äôre saying because you‚Äôre coming at this discussion in a reasonable fashion.
---
Which kind of proves your point, and is one reason why I haven‚Äôt disagreed with you. You‚Äôre not wrong in most of what you‚Äôre saying.
---
Except in that you seem to think I care what the hypocritical, entitled crybabies think of me, or if they change their minds.
---
I know they won‚Äôt change their minds. They‚Äôll continue DCing because they care more about their enjoyment than anyone else‚Äôs‚Äô and they don‚Äôt see the hypocrisy in that.
---
But it is what it is. I‚Äôm not here to try and teach them, my aim is to shame them.
---
And again - I haven‚Äôt flown into a rage with you. It should be fairly evident at this point that the only people that get the insulting asshole side of me are the entitled hypocrites.
---
That's why everyone needs to run spine chill such a great perk
---
Doesn‚Äôt a catchphrase have to be said not too often but often regardless? Thought he said it not too often but still often from what I recall. Also, Terry got his joke from Freddy, which suggests it‚Äôs Freddy‚Äôs catchphrase.
---
I saw nightmare on elm street before I would say I was 8 years old. That‚Äôs when my memory wasn‚Äôt perfect but it wasn‚Äôt that of a 2 year old‚Äôs.
---
Lmao lol xd hahah
---
ur welcome. points r very important
---
Nah fam. I can play this game however I want. There‚Äôs no message in the terms of service saying I can‚Äôt play the game in whatever way I want. If a killer wants to camp then he can camp. If he tunnels then he can tunnel. There‚Äôs no rule against it.
---
Yea but killers have to deal with unfun shit all the time and look how long it takes to get nerfed *cough* instaheals *cough*
---
So you are saying it is actually possible now for survivors to escape a nurse. That is a good thing. 
---
Also, she is still 100% viable at high ranks. She is actually easier to play now that the exhaustion wiggle length has been swapped for waiting on a charge (you would previously spend 1/10 the game looking at your feet)
---
There are absolutely balance issues with survivors and SWF coms, but the devs have been using Nurse, Billy, and Spirit as their excuse to play them if you want to win. The Devs have been using them as an excuse NOT to fix game balance. We need all killers to be viable. Having 3 killers as the only viable go-to‚Äôs for a majority of players at high ranks hurts the health of the game. Nurse, Spirit, and eventually Billy need to be changed so that the real balance issues can be fixed for ALL killers.
---
lol i like the idea of kicking someone trying to unhook you. "No i LIKE the pain!!"
---
DS BT BL is not fun to play against, please nerf. That logic doesn‚Äôt hold. Also, she has no counter play if you want to loop her just like you loop every other killer. And you shouldn‚Äôt run killers 5gens just because you see how killer act and you react in a certain way. I think the only unfair part rn about spirit is for some skins you cannot figure out whether she is phasing or not.
---
The alternative to looping is stealth which is 10x more boring to play vs than looping and camping pallets will not work vs a good spirit unless you have inhuman reaction time all she needs to do is just move to the pallet and see if she bumps off you and when it comes to the window vault she just has to cancel her power and then use it again  a few seconds later
---
Oh boy smooching time!
---
He shouldn‚Äôt be in the game regardless other than being part of lore.
---
No the person who posted this. Who makes you e judge of him and say he is doing it all wrong.
---
You didn‚Äôt counter her, you kinda just did her job for her. I think you could argue better for Legion honestly.
---
Or jus make locker view first person like Identity V
---
Boop
---
yeah, and you can see him coming and juke it. his mind games are visible and predictable, depending on the player. it is possible to outplay a good Billy. a lot of what makes Spirit unfun to go against for a lot of players is that she's literally invisible and can hear you at all times, especially when injured. it's hard to tell when she's going into phase except purported hair/glass animations that i have yet to see (and i specifically looked when i was playing yesterday).
---
look, all i'm saying is that there's a lot of anger present in this thread and it's not that serious. nerfs or changes haven't been confirmed. it's all good, my dude.
---
Guaranteed you're the bitch boy that complains about camping and tunneling at the end of the match.
---
N A N C Y
---
Since everyone dc‚Äôs against iri head anyways, it won‚Äôt be too much of an issue when they change it
---
You can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the whole point. You need to pick and choose as the situation calls for, and you need to sacrifice some capabilities for others.
---
That‚Äôs part of the game.
---
Do you NOT want to play the game? Do you just want everything to be perfectly easy with no challenge?
---
I agree. I also think console should be balanced completely separately, just like Overwatch. The versions play completely differently.
---
I like to stay hip with the kiddos.
---
I‚Äôm planning on doing order of release but accidentally skipped billy haha but hopefully we‚Äôll get through all of them
---
Yea and my level 17 bubba gets more kills then your p3 spirit
---
I think it‚Äôs around 12ish Times throughout the entire extremely long series maybe twice in the first move and most of them are in Freddy vs Jason which is well.... Freddy vs Jason aka a comedy that almost took Freddy‚Äôs iconic features to the same extremes as scary terry.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the fact that you can give yourself turning addons for Hillbilly for free with keybinds.
---
When a survivor loops me for too long, I ignore him for the entire match and kill all the others, then go after him
---
I do like using premonition from time to time, since it gives the exact direction the Killer is coming from. It is still not all that good in comparison to the passive godsend that is Spine Chill
---
i think its limited by the engine
---
new lore, trapper was framed
---
Demogorgon's map-wide screeches creep me out, and I have 3k+ hours
---
This is in not strict enough. Doesn't solve the problem.
---
&gt; Like seriously she‚Äôs so well balanced.
---
they know that. it doesn't matter. survivor mains dislike anything that requires them to do anything other than blindly running around the same loops 2000 times and hiding in corners for 10 minutes
---
It‚Äôs not worth it lol. I‚Äôve been saying for years now that Billy is too powerful, but people find a way to defend him. It‚Äôs only gotten worse since Spirit came out. 
---
‚ÄúWell at least you can SEE the Hillbilly!1!1‚Äù, as if being able to see the deformed man sprinting at 10000mph across the map to insta down you somehow makes it totally cool and balanced.
---
Yes because 3 DC'd teammates = his mistake. Moron.
---
Poooo hahahaha
---
Ah OK. Billy and hag are two of my favourite athletically so I'm hyped either way. Keep it up.
---
Honestly, the Custom Terror Radius music would be a step in the right direction. 
---
The problem is that eventually over time, the game is just going to naturally stop being scary. I‚Äôm sure new players/casual players find it pretty tense, but I have 900+ hours and that feeling is kind of gone.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong though, seeing a Myers staring at you through a window/Pig creeping around the corner will still scare me pretty badly, and The Spirits noises still freak me out.
---
A lot of the horror I feel comes from aesthetic and atmosphere. The new Hawkins Lab Map is a perfect example of this, with all the industrial noises/creatures chattering/rats squeeking
---
If anything her ability needs to give survivors more information to work with, slightly reworked addons, and in return some buffs to the base power.
---
Hahaha preach
---
Yep when I have mother's ring and green slippers, I don't even notice the scratch marks being gone. You move so damn fast that with Stridor you can be right on top of the survivor before they can even consider reacting to you going incorporeal.
---
Ewwww lmfao cursed screenshot but I love this
---
What evidence is there besides the vague gif on their twitter obviously referencing the spirit rework
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
Stopping you there. If I am talking about the state of spirit, I don‚Äôt care about anything else. Just because X currently isn‚Äôt balanced, doesn‚Äôt mean we should balance Y. Stop equating. 
---
Both sides have issues. We should be trying to make the game fun for both. Not complaining about which side has it harder.
---
Survivor mentality needs to change. Stop worrying about the escape and worry more about getting a pip. At that point it doesn't matter how strong the killer is as long as you're making progress and improving in your gameplay. My personal goal when playing survivor is 2 gens, 2 saves, a totem or 2 along the way, and then running the killer for as long as I can. I might get sacrificed but at least I had some variety in my game instead of just genrushing and bouncing.
---
It takes longer to find survivor matches already, it's kinda funny..if i queue as a killer it's almost istant
---
People really dislike to play killer nowadays, me included, i got rank 1 a few times and recently decided to stop playing killer at all..it's not fun at all, not anymore at least
---
Yeah people overlook map pressure for killers, that's why even millies can be dangerous even when they don't know how to use the chainsaw (on open maps that is).
---
offcourse watch youtube many idiots players are rank 1 
---
as a killers or survivors
---
I had a 3 stack of steamers do this to me, I was chased by a huntress for 4 gens on the new map. I go down, they start going down like FLIES. Ie literally one somehow got 3 hooked before the final gen. Manage to do last gen, shouldn‚Äôt have been hard, I leave with one person on hook because I was waiting to get healed by a claud at gate, but she just keeps gesturing. Not even joking they both then died and I got shit on, told me I did nothing and they, and I quote ‚Äúdid all the gens while you did nothing‚Äù. Tell me to uninstall and how I‚Äôm absolute shit. expect it to be 3 kids or something. Stream shows it‚Äôs 1 grown man and 2 grown women complaining about how I was awful. Delusional peeps, been that angry at their age.
---
A game can‚Äôt be scary in third person? Silent hill 2 says hello
---
Your next buddy
---
the role called KILLER not gen defender u idiot
---
the purpose of this game as a killer is to KILL survivors
---
If this is a parody this is genius
---
A for effort F for execution.
---
üòò
---
Lol I *hate* the Hillbilly with a passion. I‚Äôd only play Pig and Legion if I could, but it‚Äôs not fun to get destroyed every game. Then again, I guess it only matters when certain people have fun lol.
---
Remove collision and add perma beads to base imo
---
&gt; How about different versions of the game recieve different tweaks?
---
But the game doesn't receive different tweaks for different versions. Really don't know how console players such as yourself can form solid opinions about the balance of the game. The fact you're complaining about Billy, one of the most balanced killers in the game, shows how wrong you are.
---
Devour Hope isn‚Äôt a strong perk. It‚Äôs fun when it works, but it can get cleansed quickly. Thanatophobia and Dying Light aren‚Äôt good perks tbh.
---
Thanatophobia, at it‚Äôs strongest, does very little. As for Dying Light, if you have enough stacks to make a big enough difference, you‚Äôre already winning the game anyways. 
---
You can try it out but there‚Äôs a reason why Nurse mains don‚Äôt use these perks
---
People 7 years ago
---
is it just me or do older gameplay videos show it running on a different engine, cause ive watched some youtubers who's games look way more HD than mine &amp; im running on ultra
---
Oh I believe it
---
I think if Billy was more fun to play, he would be considered a bigger problem. I feel like his mediocre to low popularity is what keeps him out of the spotlight.
---
It's basically a hybrid of Freddy's two kits. The AOE sleep ability would simply give him more target options, as well as stall affected Survivors. The biggest issue with Freddy's original kit was that he could only target one Survivor at a time, while the other were free to do as they please. In this version, multiple Survivors can be put to sleep simultaneously, and ones who aren't being chased can just wake themselves up, the same way Mangled can be self-healed. Alternatives, awake Survivors can wake up sleeping ones, which is nothing new.
---
Aren‚Äôt we all?
---
To put it simply, Ghostface stalks individual people, and Michael stalks many people.
---
To put it longer, Ghostface activates his power to lose his terror radius and red stain. He can crouch and lean over cover in his power. He can also crouch out of Nightshroud. When a survivor looks at him, there‚Äôs a noise notification that gradually gets louder the closer you are to losing your power. When the survivor looks at him long enough, he‚Äôs booted out of his power, and there‚Äôs an indicator of where the survivor who put you out of your power is. While using Nightshroud, Ghostface can stalk a survivor. Each survivor has their own individual stalk meter. Once the meter is complete, they will receive the exposed status, and you can insta-down them. Leaning from cover can make this meter progress faster 
---
Michael starts off in Teir 1 of The Evil Within. He has no terror radius or red stain in this time, and is also slowed down. He can hold down a button to stalk. Once stalking, you can look at survivor to fill up your Evil Within meter. Once the meter is full, he gets into Tier 2. Tier 2 allows you to move faster, and you get a stain and terror radius. You can continue stalling to get into Tier 3. Tier 3 will give all survivors the exposed status for a moderate amount of time.
---
The stalk time for Michael takes a longer amount of time to tier up then it is for Ghostface to stalk a singular survivor. I personally like Ghostface more because he can hide his stain and radius at a whim (as long as his power is available)
---
This.
---
Defending that fact that you're an asshole by saying "Its not against the rules to be an asshole" is a pretty weak defense. The fact that you're allowed to be a petty loser doesn't mean you should be one. 
---
Its not against the law to flip over the board and cry every time you lose at monopoly either. Nobody is going to want to play monopoly with you if you do that though.
---
At least up to rank 10 where I get matched up with ranks 4 to 6.
---
I dislike that he can do a little bit of everything from most other killers.
---
However my main issue with him is there lullaby when you're asleep. There's really just straight up no reason for it and being that you can't hardly see him until he's in terror radius anyways just makes it needlessly difficult to determine how close to you he is.
---
I figured my dislike comes from how they teach new players bad habits in the tutorial. I pointed out that if they are going to have a rank system that judges you on your actions, then they should be accounting for that in the tutorial of the game.  I tried to get friends to play the game, but they each consistently had to deal with face campers in each person's game. BHVR failed hardcore on teaching the game play loop in their tutorial is my only thought, because if they taught the game play loop proper, face camping would be a far less common occurrence at those early ranks.
---
did you miss my sarcasm or am I missing yours?
---
What if we are overthinking this and a thief just stole it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It has a giant effect on learning. It makes survivor run around the map, trying to find it and releases lots of pressure from you, making you not apply as much pressure on others as you could've if you were in a bigger rush
---
While I agree, that‚Äôll never happen lol. The devs can barely balance the universal version. 
---
(Also, the balance changes between PC/console Overwatch got removed. Turrets deal the same damage on all platforms now iirc)
---
Totally. This is my mindset when I play survivor as well. I view escaping as a fun bonus, not as a requirement for the match to be fun.
---
Jake doesn‚Äôt shower
---
Cross Platform Progression is the single thing stopping me from playing DBD on anything but PC.
---
There is no way in hell I'm doing all that grinding AGAIN from scratch.
---
I guess I must have misunderstood his name, clearly that‚Äôs Celeryface.
---
Forgot to mention I wasn‚Äôt thinking of Terry when I made the comment. With that out of the way...
---
Well does he say anything else more than that which could be used for his catchphrase instead, or does he use bitch in ways that makes it seem like he couldn‚Äôt think of anything else to say instead?
---
I have seen approximately zero evidence pointing towards Jack Torrence
---
This mentality is so fucking stupid. Lets never change anything in the game because someone might be upset!!! Lets go back to old DS and Mettle too, because why would I want to play in red ranks without them against good killers
---
They forgot to put an option like " TONS OF BUGS " on that "why did you stop playing DBD" question.
---
Like I said, let killers do what they want as complaining about what they do is going to make them hate you all the more.
---
I like your Mori rework.
---
As for keys, they should take time to open the hatch and if you get interrupted, the key brakes.
---
And then you run away directly into the killer because you didn't know which direction they we coming from. Premonition gang rise up.
---
Only killer being complained about is spirit..... Billy Freddy Nurse and even Huntress/Hag are viable at rank 1.  Haven‚Äôt heard anyone complain about any of those killers except maybe freddy recently.  When even popular killer main streamers are saying Spirits power is too much of a guess to even have a reliable counter than there‚Äôs an issue.
---
That doesn't need to be changed, if you have that in mind you can be ready for it. He has a 10 second cool down after that too.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt have an issue with Hillbilly or Nurse. Both offer counterplay that doesn‚Äôt rely on using perks. Using a perk slot to counter one killer is fucking stupid. 
---
Good Nurses at least have to earn their stripes, and playing dodge-the-chainsaw is fun to me tbh.
---
MoM doesn't need to be fixed.
---
It's fine the way it is.
---
Take your pill and deal with it.
---
And now she's even worse. See the issue? Balancing should be separate for both versions of the game.
---
I see you completely ignored my entire point because it doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative. It isn‚Äôt about fun. It‚Äôs about counterplay. I mentioned this, you skipped over it. 
---
She has no counter play regardless of circumstance. If the spirit is competent, you get hit.
---
Skins are not a reliable way to tell if she‚Äôs phasing. You may think it is, but I will run a private match with you for however long you want to prove that wrong.
---
Uh oh
---
Billy only gets a pass because he's loopable, just like Myers. That's not an excuse for a Killer to have busted abilities.
---
Wrong.
---
Very much wrong.
---
Stridor does counter Iron Will.  The Perks aren't multiplication so much as addition or subtraction.
---
Think of it like TV volume.  Survivors start with their volume at 100.  Iron will lowers it to 0.  Stridor then adds 50.  This the survivors are now half as loud instead of completely silent.
---
The only way to lower it further at this point is to use both Iron Will and No Mither.
---
I'd totally use it.
---
Tension is all the game really needs in my opinion. You should never feel safe in DbD, but thanks to the terror radius you know for fact just how safe you are at all times. Don't hear anything, 100% safe. Just started to hear it, you have roughly 10 seconds before the Killer is there. That's one hell of a problem in building tension.
---
I for one would like to have the standard terror radius reduced. 32m is very forgiving. 24m might be better as a default. This wouldn't effect stealth Killers at all either. 0 will always be better than 24 and Killers with modified TRs almost wouldn't need any changes either. Shape can stay at his 16m in EW2 and keep the 32m at EW3 for how strong that is. Hag would likely be the only non default TR Killer needing changed. Hag has a 28m TR at the moment, take it to 20m.
---
Doin' gens, you piece of shit.
---
Why did you respond to yourself?
---
If Dwight brings in a key....then he is no longer a Baby Dwight...
---
*Brings in Iridescent Head Huntress*
---
Fuck I didn't know I could do that o woulda put Steve three times lol
---
i had somebody literally &amp; unironically say "the only way you get kills is with freddys paintbrush" 
---
These are the people dictating what gets nerfed yall
---
So every post/meme should come paired with a dissertation of clarifications/exceptions/counterexamples/"other side" points?  Cause that sounds exhausting.
---
Sometimes I want to say "Survivors who do X are assholes," not "Survivors who do X are assholes, but under circumstances like X, Y, Z, that behavior is understandable, and I realize I wasn't in the room so I don't know what their side looked like, and sometimes killers are also assholes, but also Killers are only assholes when they do A, but under situations A, B, C, that behavior is understandable, and I realize this perk can counter that behavior but I don't think it should be a mandatory perk to avoid assholes in a game I play for fun."
---
Maybe, rather than trying to constantly assume that everyone who complains about a shitty behavior is automatically complaining about All Survivors or All Killers, and move on.
---

---
The fatigue stun was not removed. It still exists and remains unchanged. Your first paragraph is 100% irrelevant. The problem is now on TOP of the fatigue stun, you have a 3.5 second ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt double blink‚Äù window. That‚Äôs a time period where the survivor you are chasing has 100% control over the chase since you likely won‚Äôt be getting bloodlust and your base movement speed is 96.25% of a survivors running speed, meaning they will outrun you. You STILL spent 1/10 of the game looking at the ground, the issue now is that on top of that 1/10, you spend another 1/10 being the most non threatening presence in the game. 
---
The devs have never outright said they will not change something in killers favor bc Billy, Spirit, or Nurse would disproportionately benefit from it. In fact the Badham map rework is a blatant example of your statement here being dead wrong. The changes in map structure meant nothing to Nurse since she doesn‚Äôt play the pallet game and uses her blinks for map pressure. Spirit largely ignored the changes and Billy actually benefitted from the rework tremendously. 
---
The issue is NOT that Nurse, Billy, and Spirit are too strong. That is Blendette rhetoric if I‚Äôve ever seen it. The issue is that they were the ONLY killers viable against optimal survivor play. Nurse is out of that bubble, Billy doesn‚Äôt have enough intricacies to ever stay in that bubble long enough, and Spirit has now been confirmed to be getting moved out of it soon. If the killers on the cusp of being Red rank viable aren‚Äôt buffed, we absolutely will return to the dark age of DBD after Spirit gets nerfed. If Hag, Huntress, Plague, Bubba, Myers, Pig, Ghostface, Demo, and literally EVERY OTHER KILLER don‚Äôt see buffs to be red rank viable, the Spirit nerfs will be the beginning of a survivor meta. Literally the dark age of DBD will return if killers keep getting nerfed.
---
People like Scott Jund being really toxic and spreading bad practices, showing people to DC and basically toxic gameplay that screws over not just the killer but also his teammates. So spirit wasn‚Äôt the top top killer because it used to be the nurse. People were complaining about the nurse and it got nerfed. So survivor mains obviously saw the chance and pattern, so they‚Äôre targeting the next meta killer. The whole ordeal is a slippery slope because of BHVR starts to nerf each killer like this, it‚Äôll one day result in a bunch of unplayable killer while survivors get better as they learn how to play the game. The game isn‚Äôt supposed to be a 1v1 between survivor and killer. It‚Äôs a 4v1 which the survivor, if caught in a chase with the killer, is supposed to go down no matter what. But nowadays survivor mains feel the urge to outrun a killer in all situations and since they can‚Äôt do that against a spirit, they feel the need to nerf her. But I‚Äôve played against a spirit a shit ton of times, I‚Äôve seen a good spirit that can literally finish 12 hooks without us completing two gens, I‚Äôve also seen bad spirits that can‚Äôt even get a single hook the whole game. See, it‚Äôs clearly dependent on the spirit user as well now if you nerf the whole killer, you‚Äôll simply see less spirit in the game now as I notice nobody really uses the nurse anymore.
---
Who's top left laurie?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been getting unnecessarily slugged a lot.. I feel you
---
The realism is insane... amazing job
---
First of all, you are crudely misusing the term "parody".
---
I am sure you meant something more like "satirical".
---
Another quality human being.
---
Bravo.
---
You should watch The Haunting of Hill House.

Bill's cosmetics should just be other Left 4 Dead survivors, kinda like how legion works
---
I would love a Wuinten looking Quinten
---
The only experience I've had with toxic streamers is some small streamer with ttv in their name was playing killer and he tunneled me all match. Never pressuring a single gen, he just kept proxy camping, ate the borrowed time, and kept chasing me. After the match I asked why he played like that and he said cause I was a toxic SWF 4 stack.
---
Told him to check my friends list and he found nobody ingame on my friends list. He proceeded to claim it was because he didnt know how to play demo since he just came out.
---
Its wild just have toxic or stupid some people play. Especially when playing the objective is a lot more important than things such as healing, opening a chest, sabo'ing, etc
---
Some people take the game too seriously and some think that if something happens, it's all their teammates fault.
---
So basically like Rocket league or league
---
I am honestly fine with stressful, I like the suspense for the entire game, but playing against red ranks as kiler is such a chore. Unless you are Otzdarva or other 1000 IQ player with thousands of hours in this game, you need to play meta all the time because if you don¬¥t you will get utterly bullied, teabagged and flamed. God forbid you want to try a different build, or better yet a new killer you are unfamiliar with. A few days ago I tried playing Trapper, even used a BPS Offering thinking hey let¬¥s have a friendly match, I got utterly bullied, teabagged and blinded at every single loop. I fucking hate ranking up it this game. 
---
You play a strong killer, people DC, you play a weak killer, people bully you, you play a niche killer people DC because "tHaT KiLlER Is JuST No FuN!!!" as I have been told in my latest Plague game.
---
Yea I want to have fun playing the actual game not basing it on if I make it out or not. I would rather get killed after an intense chase than sit on gen after gen after gen.
---
Well, let's see now. First, they tried burning me.¬†[slices off thumb]¬†Then they tried burying me.¬†[slices off index finger]¬†But this... this is my favorite.

Idk if Leatherface is really bottom tier, his endgame is so good, I'd probably put him ahead of plague without add ons.
---
Old Mettle of Man = Meta of Man
---
I think it‚Äôs more of his go to profanity than a catchphrase. The most iconic part of Freddy at least Imo is his lullaby. Honestly saying Freddy has a catchphrase in general is a disservice to how iconic and creative he is with a tendency to tailor everything he does and says to whoever he‚Äôs tormenting at any given point.
---
I don't think you could make the nurse work on console without totally changing her. She just doesn't translate to controllers very well.
---
I don‚Äôt want to upset you,but look at the fingers(
---
Yes, looping, specifically infinites, is exploitation, dickhead. Face camping is the equivalent for Killers. With all of your higher knowledge, I'd thought you'd be able to see that.
---
no. Two people being on the hook is always worse then one, even if that person just got off.
---
I also added on that they should make a better tutorial. Its horribly our if date and new players will be overwhelmed by everything it doesnt cover
---
The smell of Jake‚Äôs nether regions was so horrid it tainted Nea‚Äôs eyes.

rumors saying they will nerf her to the ground
---
legion no2
---
I definitely see what you‚Äôre saying. However (and this could totally just be a platform-specific thing so correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) Billy has always been the best killer on console because Nurse isn‚Äôt usable. I see him more than anyone else (along with Spirit at the moment lol) in high ranks. He‚Äôs also never fallen out of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù since launch. Obviously that‚Äôs not fair for super early DBD because there were *only* 3 killers, but no matter who has joined the roster, who has been reworked, or what perks have been added, Billy has never even slightly been weakened.
---
Plagues not gonna get nerfed anytime soon
---

---
[I just really like her, ok?](https://i.imgur.com/gsZa7tp.png)
---
I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of people complaining about Plague recently too
---
I'm pretty sure the ego comes from dark souls 3. I believe that's where he made his initial following. He was known as a talented pvper and for knowing in depth about a lot of the smaller mechanics.
---
I believe he eventually left it for basically the same reason. Lots of shit got started about him whining when losing and being a dick about it. Complaining about people using certain builds, etc. I can see it going the same way.
---
The last time I played Plague I was told that Severed Toe is OP lmao
---
yeah sure whatever... but overall the piece is absolutely amazing and you should be proud of yourself
---
And after spirit is adjusted the complaints will move to the next killer at the top. I'm guessing either freddy or ghostface end up in their sights.
---
Nice feng min?#
---
Have you seen him in tier 3 with it tho
---
This is wrong. Survivor mains are not more toxic then killer mains. 
---
As a killer main, you will inherently play against more survivors then you would against killers, as you would only play against killers when you are doing something you normally would not do.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, and I can tell you I come across both toxic survivors and toxic killers. Sometimes equally, sometimes far more survivors, and sometimes far more killers.
---
So realize this. Toxic players are able to be anything they chose. What you see is not 100% of the player base. What you remember isn‚Äôt 100% of what happened.  You play a game and get harassed by 1 survivor out of 4 and say OMG survivors are toxic (even tho only 25% were). Survivors play 10 games and get camped twice. ZOMG all killers camp (although only 20% did).
---
Stop overstating and stop making up data. You can express what you feel you have witnessed, but remember that‚Äôs not indisputable proof.
---
I stalk with trues build when they run to god loops or a big time waster, then i just come back later when they got healed later in the game and get the free expose hit that you almost always get.
---
I love this lmao
---
How is stealth (the lriginally-intended method) more boring than running around in circles for minutes at a time?
---
And like I said, being an asshole just because you can is literally the dumbest reason to be an asshole.
---
Haven‚Äôt seen anyone complain about plague except survivors complaining about other survivors cleansing.  Not sure where you‚Äôre looking, considering she‚Äôs mid tier anyways nobody‚Äôs gonna agree with that
---
No Feng Min here(
---
no prob! I hope to see more drawings like this because it‚Äôs so good... maybe try balanced landing next time? ;)
---
No, is it bad?
---
The only reason I'm against punishing DCs is because the game still has a ton of bugs. I had just one game end for no reason. None of us DC'd and we were all in chat wondering why we're on the results screen. I also get random disconnects occasionally and getting punished for their bad net code will make a lot of people resent them.
---
Myers aint the only one with jumpscare potential
---
Even though this is a horror game, I find it more relaxing than other games. I laugh more playing this than I do in any other game, and it is because of the little jumps and the tension that comes.
---
I suppose to me, go to profanity would be his catchphrase then. Specifically the word Bitch.
---
Don‚Äôt recall him looking for a specific way to torment the first movie character‚Äôs he just looked for creative kills after scaring them a bunch to gain strength.

---
Missing 8 blinks in a row isn‚Äôt unfeasible anymore. Nurse is now harmed by bad maps due to her basekit nerf
---
The student skin don‚Äôt have visual differences when she is using her power, other skins does. Also she is one of the strongest killers, of course your chance of counterplay is lower. But it is clearly possible to trick her to believe you are in one place when you are in another and waste her time.
---
You said you get hit if the killer player is competent, but shouldn‚Äôt that be the case for every killer? If a survivor has the ability to stay alive forever as long as he/she does not make mistake, then a good survivor can just run 5 gens against a good killer. it is unfun and not fair for the killer, because they win or lose totally depend on how survivors perform. Your skill as survivor should only determine how long you can last before you go down, and it should be impossible to run killers for very long if the killer plays correctly.
---
tbh my issue with Spirit isn‚Äôt that she‚Äôs strong, it‚Äôs that her ‚Äúcounterplay‚Äù is basically just guessing and hoping you made the right choice.
---
As a trapper in red ranks you gotta push through and learn him inside and out. Trust me it is well worth it when you get in a game where the survivors think they can bully you bc of trappers reputation and before they know it you 4k them.
---
Worst is when you know everyone can see everyone when you are hooked and you watch all 3 survivors just crouching around waiting to unhook you.
---
&gt; A low skill floor means that a character is easy to pick up, a high skill floor means that there is difficulty to pick them up
---
No, that's what a high skill floor means. FLOOR means you start on that level. A high skill floor means you start playing the character at a high effectiveness despite no experience with him.
---
Low skill floor means a character is extremely hard to play and you start off at a low level of effectiveness with him.
---
Thanks :)
---
Survivor mains who love to put prayer beads as the reason to nerf the entire spirit is toxic af as well. The game is suppose to result in survivors getting hooked constantly and if a killer can‚Äôt do that, it‚Äôs a bad designed killer. Survivors aren‚Äôt suppose to outrun a killer at every encounter because there‚Äôs four of them. Listen to truetalents way of saying it: the mentality of nerfing killers one by one is a slippery slope that‚Äôll result in a bunch of unplayable killers in future. No point pretending that survivors are toxic in this situation. It‚Äôs 16 perks vs 4 and you can‚Äôt team play a game? That‚Äôs pathetic man.
---
I would kill for Xenomorph or Predator.
---
You misunderstand. They're leaving match while slugged.
---
They couldphase around like rin's limbs
---
Well, there definitely wasn't much space to tell them about that. There was really just the one "Why would you (not) recommend this game to a friend?" and I didn't want to cram a book in there.
---
But yeah, the tutorials are a mess, too. I joined before they were out, so I didn't even consider that.
---
Only killer nerf in the past year has been nurse, because she needed it ofc.  Spirits power is a simple guessing game for survivors so it‚Äôs fair that she‚Äôs getting nerfed.  If any other killer was too op they‚Äôd be getting complained about right now.  Ghostface isn‚Äôt broken at all and isn‚Äôt even used in high ranks, Freddy is very good but there‚Äôs no need to nerf him either
---
I'd love to hear suggestions. I feel like this does it's job pretty well, but that's what PTB's are for after all
---
Devil's advocate but comparing DbD and Fortnite is like comparing Vanilla Ice Cream and Pickles. They're completely different and the only thing they have in common is "theyre both video games"
---
I‚Äôm 2 weeks into this game. I was a rank 15 killer and 11 survivor last week. I switched from ghostface to spirit and now I‚Äôm a rank 9 killer. I went up 6 ranks in one day and I don‚Äôt even like playing as killer. I just wanted bloodpoints but I couldn‚Äôt stop killing people.
---
&gt;Bubba. My favourite killer to play as when I‚Äôm looking to get a rise in some people.

I dont really like the pipe in general, well its cool looking the way he slashes with it and it makes the knife sound even though its a blunt object really bothers me lol.
---
Idk probably, it could be because of an engine or the fact seperate models of them being in half takes too much time
---
I only get a rise in people who deserve it
---
I see plague getting nerfed after spirit. Don't see them going after freddy, since he just got his rework, but I don't think he'll be far behind.
---
9/10 times the person getting unhooked is chased and downed again anyways, so it‚Äôs uaually safer for one guy to get downed and hooked while another goes for a safe unhook
---
It's more fun to actually be engaged with survivors than it is to run around for the entire match not catching a glimpse of anyone and seeing gens pop across the map just to go back and have all the little P3 claudettes to all scarper off and then you don't engage with anyone for the entire match
---
Also if you run in circles for too long you might just be shit at running certain tiles

Ehhhh, I see where you're coming from. It's an interesting dynamic that could be a good change in it's own right (especially explaining broken keys) but makes them too weak in cojunction with the changes I suggested. It would have to be an either or situation and I'll leave that to others to vote on, as I'm a little biased
---
I didn‚Äôt mean to come off that way sorry if i did im just saying that killers have annoying shit to deal with and its slowly becoming a longer list than survivor just want it to be apparent that even though both sides have shit to deal with one side gets more attention
---
if everybody ran no mither it'd still look the same
---
Rank 1 Killer main with Spirit being my second most played (to Pig). Absolutely this. You cannot 'mindgame' spirit. You can just get lucky. Nothing you can do is reactive to spirit's decisions, spirit must misplay for you to get away especially when injured.
---
I don't think spirit is op, I think her chances of winning/losing is pretty fair. But I do think she is unfun to play against and her design in unhealthy because it requires survivors to not only have more skill than needed to face most other killers, but they also must essentially get lucky to ever successful evade or drag out a chase.
---

Lol and who says I do that? Also sure let me walk to the other side of the map so you can get a free unhook since you just want an easy win!

Can't slug no mither users though
---
Read the post, then scroll to the top and I corrected it
---
NGL I started watching him because someone recommended him after a match and it turned around my perception of the game. A lot of the streamers I saw before were kinda toxic and kind of assholes so it was really nice seeing someone who was REALLY GOOD and also pleasant
---
Hell yeah. Do you have painted ones for sale too? I only see black and silver.
---
I agree, although if this feature was implemented it would mean people would not try to save you while being chased and so you would be able to be saved by one of your other team mates. Meaning there would still be only one survivor hooked, not two. As well as that the fact that it would be a different survivor being hooked.
---
Ooo nice imma have to try that
---
Quentin tried to boop the snoot
---
I was mainly running it since i was doing a daily ritual and i dont have anything else for bubba
---
Can't argue with that tbh.
---
All of them are valid points. They help me with the legion, but I'm not sure how they will do with the Nurse. I will literally have to play hours on end with her to get a great reel for her build that suits my gameplay. But I'm not trying to lose rank over it either. I need the high ranks to challenge me to be a better Nurse.
---
You can't fucking pick perks after the game starts. I can't choose to run bad perks "based on the situation" unless I am guaranteed to be in that situation. If I keep getting slugged, I can run Unbreakable. Am I guaranteed to get slugged next game? Absolutely not. If I don't, I am down a perk slot. If I run Iron Will to help deal with Spirit (which gets countered by Stridor anyway), I have a chance of going against Plague, Doctor, or a camping killer, where Iron Will won't help me.
---
A doctor holding the game hostage by three genning ***from the start of the trial*** isn't a part of the game, and stop survivors from playing the game.
---
&gt; Do you just want everything to be perfectly easy with no challenge?

Nice bait. Too bad I never mentioned difficulty, so your assumption makes you look like a fool.
---
When will no0b3 upload? IT HAS BEEN 3 WEEKS.
---
What did you correct exactly?
---
You should try watching some of the others some are trash but others like dream warriors are peak Freddy in all his glory and honestly better than the first movie.
---
Lets agree to reconvene on this I'd say about 2 months after spirit is finalized. To be clear I agree spirit needs an adjustment. I don't agree that she needs to be gutted. Ghostface is definitely viable at red ranks and I have seen complaints about him and Freddy both already.
---
That‚Äôs so nicely put! Majority of this subreddit survivor mains aren‚Äôt that good and hence they usually just succumb to panic against the spirit. While for me I‚Äôve played against the spirit for a shit ton of games, I used to hate it too but now I‚Äôm just treating spirit like any other killer and do loops, pallets windows and basically the same jukes. It doesn‚Äôt work all the time but it sure doesn‚Äôt make me a complete noob in front of the spirit. People here just refuse to get good and want the easier way out. The thing is there‚Äôs no end to this slippery slope argument. It‚Äôll be Freddy GF huntress billy next. And then it‚Äôll be literally all the rest of the killers. And one day you see people asking to nerf the clown and the hag. You‚Äôll know the survivors have won against the entity.
---
Good spirits don‚Äôt fall for that lol
---
That said, I'd appreciate seeing less spirits in red ranks.
---
Not my personal experience but I watched a streamer get **nine** spirit games in a row from 5 unique players. Some killers need a buff like the clown, others a rework like nurse and imo legion, and some need a nerf. If that nerf only consists of getting rid of prayer beads then so be it.
---
Okay. If you are on Xbox, I will sit with you in a private session for however long you want just to show you it‚Äôs not reliable. She just listens for your actions and does what will gain her the hit. That‚Äôs competence. 
---
And no, the spirit isn‚Äôt affected by pallets whereas the other killers (barring nurse) are. So it doesn‚Äôt matter how well you play, some loops you‚Äôre just following the survivor around because you‚Äôre affected by the pallet. Most killers depend on survivor play, the spirit doesn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the survivor does, she wins.
---
Right, and everyone seems to like bloodlust and window blocking.
---
The pop effect probably wouldn't get used all that much, and is generally pretty map-based. It'd be helpful when it can come into play, but consistency is good to have. Plus, I feel like slowdown isn't the ideal way to go.
---
Maybe if Killers all got a 5% speed buff for 5 or 10 seconds after hooking? That would discourage camping, since camping wastes it, and discourage Survivor hook camping/ baiting, because they're in greater danger if spotted. This would also have a scaling effect where it helps Nurse, Spirit, Billy and Freddy much less than everyone else below them.
---
Fortnite is a different beast to be fair. They can bind a key to specific builds and specific guns, where on console you have to cycle through them. 0.2 seconds is actually a big deal and it adds up very quickly as well in big fights.
---
DBD the biggest thing is that PCs are running better FPS, less hitches and PC can do moves that consoles simply can't. 2/3 could be fixed if they optimized their game, and IDK how better side-stepping and moonwalking would be all that much beneficial.
---
I‚Äôm not interested in the movies anymore so that won‚Äôt be happening, funnily enough.
---
framerate is an issue when close to survivors. the fps is so low that it makes it much easier for them to dodge a hit because as a kilelr, you literally cant see where they are sometimes when they 360. once they learn to use this to their advantage, there's very little the killer can do but guess where to swing, since you often dont know where they are when you think you see them.
---
I might sound rude for saying it, but tritanopia looks cool as heck
---
"RESPECT THE PIPE" but no seriously its pretty rough though I like how it looks, the sound and swing animations from the knife dont fit very well, but the Mori looks great.

Rank 15 swf Claudette's in a nutshell

It's one of my primary reasons.
---
I miss No0b3's videos
---
I hope not. Legion is so aweful to play now. Even sucked before but at least we had an idea as to what he was supposed to be.
---
Trapper and Spirit can be part of the "My dad is a piece of shit" club together.
---
Oh yeah man I know, I love playing Killer because of this. Every single one has his own playstyle and it is a lot of fun to constantly change it up. Survivors are just skins with swappable perks, but killers are just much more diverse.
---
The thing is, it¬¥s very hard to learn a new killer when going against a meta SWF that is just looking to roll you over. I get it, it¬¥s fun for them, but I cannot wait for rank to reset so I can finally be out of there. Worst thing is I know I will slowly rank up anyway because even if I let survivors go after matches I pip anyway...
---
If you‚Äôre interested in movies at all I‚Äôd watch dream warriors at the bare minimum it‚Äôs AMAZING
---
That would be fine with me.
---
It sounds like this is one of the issues they're looking into as that was one of the reasons you could give, which I did, as your biggest concern if cross play was implemented.
---
This is unprecedented

Well, nobody's forcing you to pick him. Jeff is bigger and louder than everyone, but people still play him. People love to mori Scoops Ahoy Steve and people still play him.

I was told that Spirit is more fun to play against.

Ok I guess.

Serum has nothing to do with the event this time, you have 2 weeks after the rift ends to use your serum

i mean the least the could do is add a convincing amount of blood or damage textures to the models, its kinda ridiculous when a chainsaw just slides unconvincingly thru a stationary character model with 0 blood

So you don't like reading, I see.

Holy shit this is the last place I'd expect a MPGiS reference lmao. The insults on that show are actually perfect for this sub tbh.

I'd be happy if they'd just make Quentin look like Kyle Gallner, rather than a cracked out street goblin.
---
Cosmetics? Lawdy Lawdy, I might die happily.
---
Ghostface needs no changes except a more consistent way to reveal him as it‚Äôs broken like usual.  I think freddy needs to be able to be susceptible to borrowed time and actually have a terror radius in dream mode.  But other than that gutting either of these killers is not in their plans.
---
These are really impressive, great job bro!
---
Yah but the time it takes them to pick themselves up is just enough to get a hook or two and play wack a mole with the rest
---
I main scoops ahoy steve and I dont get moried more than I used to. Im just saying that playing Mr Yamaoka will be like using no mither but worse
---
Fucking Hag traps still make me scream irl
---
Im on the mixed sides on the phasing collison, but i can deffenetly agree with the beads. Replacing it with fathers glasses would be for the best.
---
We talking basic build spirits or meta spirits? I‚Äôm talking basic build spirits, no meta spirit talk here because you kind of have to bring a meta build in response like with every other meta build killer makes you bring meta build for your survivor.
---
If it‚Äôs basic build, they waste time standing still, enough for you to zoom away with a little bit of a head start. If they move any time during when they would actually be shifting to the other phase, you run like normal because they didn‚Äôt actually shift. Either way you give your team time for gens, and a good spirit just decided to stop moving in an attempt to confuse you, and all you did was crouch behind something.
---
I mean, that's kinda what happens when you hard Smurf. I feel bad for the little baby killers.
---
No mither, flip flop, tenacity and unbreakable meta 
---
Ez slug fix
---
I‚Äôve pallet stun plenty of spirits to know that you‚Äôre either too noob to play against any killer or just toxic. Survivors are the crybabies here for crying about the nurse before and now the spirit and in future the nightmare or the plague or the huntress billy. You‚Äôre biggest cry baby right here if all you can say is you‚Äôve lost against all spirits well that‚Äôs not true for other people who managed to outplay her don‚Äôt bring everyone down to your rank 21 level.
---
"One of the most balanced Killers in the game."
---
Yeah, that's why he hasn't left the top e most-picked Killers at high-rank for years.
---
If I‚Äôm the last survivor and the others are on their way out then cool that‚Äôs fine , you can still catch survivors trying to open gates or running toward , but if they camp on first hooks then they getting a strong cup of tea.
---
Sus af
---
It didn‚Äôt reply to Sparq still.
---
you're an asshole if you facecamp. Period.
---
I don‚Äôt dc but whenever I load into a game and see a fountain I just think ‚Äúughhh, boring game‚Äù I think a lot of ppl agree she‚Äôs just fundamentally unfun to play against, esp when you have potato teammates
---
&gt; and apparently so do switch players.
---
huh interesting. i didn't know this
---
I deleted this post and reposted it to his and is showing on mine as such
---
I totally see what you‚Äôre saying, but that would make Head On absolutely brutal to try and use lol.
---
Trapper is also apparently an Artist, i just imagine him canonically being the one designing all the survivors new outfits for the entity
---
Nah I read it.  So what Rin gets her revenge or whatever, he‚Äôs already murdered and is corrupted.  Therefore can‚Äôt be a survivor.  Doesn‚Äôt fit with the entity of good vs evil if there‚Äôs an evil person on the good side, does it.
---

---
Funny... it seems like it ***is*** a part of the game since so many entitled survivors are complaining about it.
---
He‚Äôs fine, trapper main here.
---
I was just talking to my friend the other day about the difference between these perks, Spine Chill is just better I feel since it's when the killer is looking at you
---
I prioritize eliminating perks from the web and then using the cheapest path possible
---
Otz get bullied and flamed all the time. Yeah I totally agree it‚Äôs not a good experience when only few killers are competitive and playing other killers and winning requires you to utterly dominant the survivors by a large margin. And people think those few killers are unfun to play against and OP
---
New bt is 10 Times stronger than the old one , same with ds , mom was useless against half the Killers in the game
---
Framerate, I believe
---
The game is literally designed around looping. It gives time for your team to do gens, and the most powerful killers are anti-loop killers. I can't believe this is something that even needs to be explained. If the devs wanted you to instantly throw down pallets and not loop, they wouldn't have halved the number of pallets a year and a half ago. Learn to origins of the game and its development, then you wouldn't spew so much bullshit with your comments.
---
Whos getting the checkup him or you
---
Stopping the camera slowdown would be a huge start. Also adding some aim-assist would go a long way.
---
Leave mettle of man in the dirt please it made the game almost unplayable.

---
There was a text box for comments if I remember correctly.
---
Isn't he sounds also still the same as with the knife?
---
Ah, must have taken my phone a moment to register. It‚Äôs there now.
---
Unbreakable with no mither is like Wraith with Insidious
---
Next time?
---
the first nerf was definitely warranted but they didn‚Äôt need ANOTHER downgrade from there
---
I think getting rid of the fact that she can collide with surviours when in phase is enough to make her balanced because if she can collide with you. You cant scratch mark juke her
---
They would rework the skeletons used for costumes since the bunny ears would have the hood up over the head you would either have to make the head part the hood and the body the sweater or you would have the hood go above the head and leave it whatever hair they have equipped
---
I dont see thanataphobia
---
WHAT IN THE GODDAMN?
---
Probably shortly after they cover the OG four.
---
Unbreakable also fills the bar faster so you'd get to 50% before they return for maximum flip flop.
---
"Entitled Survivors" ok dumbass. I play both sides equally but go off.
---
Talk to me again when you have had a 25 minute game against a doc who does what I described.
---
Seriously, the devs look at performance in matches. Spirit is killing way more frequently, and as such is overperforming. They don't want every game to be a struggle to escape. A balanced match in the dev's eyes is 2 dead and 2 out. Plague definitely meets that requirement, where spirit can just map the floor with a team because once you're in a chase with her you're pretty much guranteed to go down unless she leaves the chase.
---

I‚Äôm a super trashy survivor but I still managed to win against a ghost face. What I‚Äôm saying is that ghost face is not op it‚Äôs a normal killer where u just need to look around u to win him. U can say ghost face is op and get him nerfed but it still doesn‚Äôt rly affect me cuz my main killer is trapper but I don‚Äôt like that the survivors have full control of everything cuz they clearly don‚Äôt know what they are doing.
---
Thats the problem- Meta killer. There really shouldn‚Äôt be a meta killer

I‚Äôd leave my fianc√© for that sweet lil Canadian üòç

Removing Prayer Beads would alleviate the Spirit predominance.
---
That and the speed bonuses from when the killer is looking at you as well.
---
Friday the 13th is so good! I feel DBD can learn things from the game like not only having to do gens as a means to creatively escape, but the game is hella scuffed

Why slow down healing when you can disincentivize it entirely, plus everything is slower when asleep especially with addons
---
I've played the game for a short time, and I'm effective at completing generators, cleansing totems, and unhooking/healing my teammates.  The flaw in my game is when a killer is on me, I panic and have no idea how to lose them.  What perk set/tips would you suggest for polishing my evasion skills?  Or is it inevitable once the killer is on you that you will be knocked?
---
What if he's even more of a ghost than his daughter, like the devs don't even make a model for him, it's literally just a samurai sword floating in the air
---
Just go hardmode on rotten fields 4head
---
&gt; Lets go back to old DS and Mettle too, because why would I want to play in red ranks without them against good killers
---
Its funny how for a lot of these people it only goes one way. I'm not going to assume everyone thinks this way, but I bet a lot of people who are telling survivors to "get good" against Spirit had no issue with them nerfing MoM, DS, flashlights, vaulting, pallets, exhaustion, some of the more ridiculous loops, insta heals, BNPs, healing speeds, and so on.
---
I'm not saying those nerfs were bad, just that its funny how the "omg get good instead of crying for nerfs you entitled person" only seems to get directed at survivors.
---
KONO DIO DA
---
It's odd to me how people can watch Billy mains like zubat and ryanpez consistently 4K with no Ruin at red ranks with like 2 gens at most done and not say that he's overtuned. 
---
He has by far the **best** map travel in the game and on top of that has the most spammable one down mechanic with a hitbox that's the size of China, no other killer has both. He is far too easy to use for how powerful he is (compare this to killers like Nurse, Huntress, Hag) and he doesn't get punished for making any mistakes because he can just rev back up on your shoulder again. You can play like garbage nearly the entire round and still snowball into a 4k in a matter of about 40 seconds. You can't really "just loop him" either when maps will spawn massive dead zones and every Billy runs SF Enduring anyways.
---
Much like the Nurse, if Billy was released in present day (as opposed to back in 2016) he would 100% have some sort of cooldown on his ability and he honestly probably would only have one or the other, either extreme map travel or the spammable one shot. He'd still be top tier even with just his map travel alone.
---
As an unbiased 3rd party to this conversation, I'm sorry but you are wrong.
---
Imagine being at like a killer conference meeting and Rin seeing her father there.. that would be so awkward...
---
Sucks to suck then, in my experience this is a non-issue. Guy unhooking should of taken the hit, or you pathed wrong.
---

---
Did your team mates escape at least? üò©
---
I put Jake, Quentin and Steve
---
*does all Gens while team dies* USELESS ACE DID NOTHING.  K then
---
Lmao and his wife is just not even there for the survivors
---
Absolutely disagree. They did drastically reduce her fatigue animation length when using addons. It used to be huge 5+ seconds. Now, you get a short fatigue followed by waiting for the second blink to charge while moving forward and tracking survivors without needing Shadowborn. I never said they removed it. 
---
If you think survivors have control of a chase against nurse, even now, you are mistaken and need to get better at Nurse. She is just as lethal, but now gives survivors a better chance to escape and juke. You just need more skill and can‚Äôt spam her power as much. 
---
And the devs absolutely did use Nurse, Billy, and Spirit as an excuse not to make changes. They used them as an excuse not to make strong killers. 100% happened in one of the live-streamed YouTube videos. 
---
And you are missing the point. Do you think they will buff every killer other than 3, or continue to use the excuse ‚Äúplay those three if you want to win, we are going to make fun killers instead‚Äù? 
---
For the good of the game, Spirit, then Billy, needs to be changed to being all the killers around the same lethality. Then, the real issues will show up and can actually be resolved. 
---
If you have only 3 killers that are crutch to win at red ranks, DBD is already in the dark ages. I am for making killer stronger, but fixing the balance all around. SWF is too powerful, but adjusting for that hurts solo survivors. Many things can be true at once.
---
I retract my statement about you not having played Billy. If you put blind faith in the killers difficulty rating you've clearly never even played killer. The fact that this post is literally about how much people give a shit about soundwhoring Spirits disproves your second point.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs just a fucking pilot. Only one scene barely qualifies as a meme template and this isn‚Äôt it. Also, this post in itself is just not good, lad.
---
I just don't like the way he's gripping it. Like, shouldn't his hand be a little lower, closer to where it bends? It just looks odd the way he's holding it now
---
Awesome
---
Imagine calling me toxic and a crybaby to then making a toxic, insulting and demeaning comment because you're salty about what I said.
---
What I said still stands, you can not pallet stun a good spirit player because their swing out of phase is faster than the pallet drop. My point also still stands of how once you're injured, there is 0 counter to a spirit phase but to hope and pray that she messes up, if she doesn't well you're dead.
---
Stop defending whats broken just because its the only thing getting you to rank one. Nurse was a broken shit too, the only counter to her was stealth which can be negated by killer perks so you only had the option to lose sight against her which isn't always possible because of the maps.
---
Pretty sure I‚Äôve been disconnected right after the the killer hit me more than once. Could be remembering wrong though haven‚Äôt played in a bit :D
---
This is referencing when a guy unhooks after being hit or with the killer close enough to farm you, not when a fully healed survivor with the ability to take the killer on a chase unhooks you.
---
I get so many 3 man d/cs when I play Freddy :c
---
That's what I did. I'm better with Myers but GF is a bit more interactive as far as controls.
---
No, it‚Äôs the toolbox
---
David David David XD
---
I don't get that, i play plague but also love going against her.
---
I find it thrilling not to know if i'm good enough to loop her while broken, or when the first survivor breaks and cleanses, making the game even faster. 
---
Of course plague heavily depends on the map. If it's bloodlodge or haddon i'll think "this will be easy". If it's lerys or the underground i'll think "oh that's going to be hard" but it's still thousand times more interesting than going against the same spirit, billy and nurse build for the hundred time.
---
Where does it mention it in game?
---
True im a p3 spirit u just need to see and hear the hints that she give
---
Nah old moris are terrible legion, hag and especially doctors are amazing. Some new ones suck tho alot looking at you plague
---
I don't think she's unfun at all
---
Yeah, watching his games can be crazy sometimes. He tries to play fair all the time but he gets called a shitty tuneller and gets bullied. Just right now I watched him get absolutely shit on as Trapper because they abused DS with Adrenaline and then teabagged him in the exit gates. And then in the chat they were like "foolishly brave, not running Ruin"...
---
Yeah okay. And survivors wonder why people run Spirit with Anal Beads and Mori.
---
Sure, you can beat a 3 gen strat that the killer initiates from the start of the game, but at what cost? I'm not spending 25 minutes in a game where I'm holding m1, then running 2 feet away when the killer gets close, only for him to abandon the chase.
---
He's just super weak to being looped. His instadown is situationally very good, but it can be hard to use it to great effect against good survivors.
---
If you're good at plague, though, you have permanent insta-downs on all survivors, but if the survivors are idiots, then you have a ranged attack that can injur survivors over most tiles. The issue with LF is he is so easily loopable and against a good looper, it'll take a long time to get a saw, but with Plague, you just need to infect them enough to injur them and get an m1 through a pallet or window
---
Still better than the repeated cat memes or tier lists. 
---
Would rather see this expanded to other killers than those.
---
If that isn‚Äôt a mood. I was so terrified when I had a bunch of dcs while trying to do the quest for 4 kills but thankfully it counted dcs
---
I dunno man, every new player I see in dbd is panicking and hiding and screaming.
---
Once you played enough, you just see this game as a loop simulator with some mind games because you're over the discovery and surprise phasen but there's not much that can be done about it after hundreds of hours in a competitive mindset.
---
Trying locking it at 15-25 instead. 60 fps lmao, maybe on the menus.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they were in on it but I didn‚Äôt stay to watch because I was triggered af üòÇ
---
I googled ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs horny‚Äù and didn‚Äôt find her.
---
Fair, some times you gotta have a coffee and reddit break to avoid burn out.
---
I'm more bothered by the pipe and screwdriver making a sound of a knife
---
It is reliable to figure out whether she is phasing or not. Of course it is not a reliable way to out run her. In fact, any killer should not be reliably out ran just because you react to their input. They are players, not robots to test your ability, they want to get rewarded when they play correctly as well. 
---
And yes she will always down survivors if she play well, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she always win. If you watched the recent video from Scott Jund explaining why there‚Äôs no counter play to spirit, he end chases 34secs on average, if you are as good as Scott‚Äôs spirit and always end chases in 34 seconds, it will still be over a minute long including the time you look for survivor, down him and put him on the hook. That‚Äôs enough time to push 3 gens to over 70%. Then you slow them down because they need to hook save, but by the time you get 3-4 hooks, all gens are done. Just so you know, you need 9 hooks per game to rank up reliably as a killer and through the calculation, you can see that there is no chance for you as the killer to rank up if the survivors performed well, even if you also performed well, and that‚Äôs not fair for the killer player.
---
You can still hit survivors on hook on console ?
---
You could always turn the chat system off, or play SWF.
---
They bought the licensing from the holder when they released him, since then the license has changed hands so they cannot add him to any new versions like switch.
---
Freddy will be next to the firing range
---
That makes sense, I was confused what you were trying to say there.
---
You can already tell when she is phasing or not.
---
The unfun part as Survivor is the guessing game and nothing you do really matters when the spirit knows what shes doing.
---
I don‚Äôt see how a shitty tik tok has anything to do with dbd and ghostface other than a Halloween slut using a mask. You guys are a bunch of thirsty neckbeards
---
Send the video and print if the message in the forums, can result in bans iirc
---
the thing is, he had counterplay. it's just someone found an unintended exploit that had no counterplay, and also a minor glitch that should have been fixed in the testing phase. but then rather than just fix that exploit and glitch and be done with it, BHVR decided to not just fix the exploit and glitch, but ALSO nerf a whole bunch of other aspects of the character's power that were unrelated to those two small issue. 
---
And this was on top of the fact that when played as intended, he was already a bad character. In fact, the devs even mentioned he was never intended to be good, just to have a play style some would find fun despite Legion being no good. so he got nerfed from basement tier to beneath sub-strata tier. 
---
and its interesting, because a major result of Legion being created was that Borrowed Time got buffed, then buffed again, from what was originally a free escape in clutch situations, to a free escape that makes you near invincible. which means that all the killers ultimately got nerfed because of Legion, who remains a shit killer.
---
I have. We broke the 3gen because the doc never hooked anyone before it got to a 3gen. Another time we lost because the doc held. That‚Äôs kinda how things go...
---
You‚Äôre just mad/sad/bad and think you can dictate how your opponents play the game. Just another entitled survivor bitching that his opponent dares try to win.
---
One important note I realized was that Croquedead's most recent tier list was made *before* the Undetectable status was added to a few Killers, including Ghost Face and Pig.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt; consistent high rank gameplay
---
I don't actually know what that looks like yet, but I assumed from the [pip conditions by rank](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems#Pip_Conditions) that things are more consistent than they were before. Though I realize SWF vs randoms would add a large amount of inconsistency.
---
&gt; I will not include CP here
---
You know that often stands for "child pornography", right?
---
But anyway, I've been curious as to how Thanataphobia plays into Plague's kit, if nobody ever heals. I noticed a lot more Survivors healing when I ran it, but I haven't gotten my rank very high yet.
---
I played Plague a couple times, and realized in the emblem screen what a big weakness of hers is: she gets significantly fewer Malicious and Chaser points because of often only hitting people once instead of twice. 
---
It's still pretty bad for Legion that missing an attack (lockers, Dead Hards, and 360s are not your friend) means you get a long stun. You also have to take into account that he can't see scratch marks or blood pools while frenzied, which can make it really easy to juke him. 
---
Also, Blessed Apples are an uncommon add-on, which means Plague can use them pretty consistently. This is the *one thing* that puts her in the "maybe viable" spot.
---
But, I do have to give credit to Legion for wasting Survivors' time with mending.
---
I only recently heard that Leatherface can make use of Play With Your Food to actually be usable, which I guess makes him more salvageable than the Killers below him.
---
Clown is so low because the act of throwing the bottle slows him down, which can make slowing the Survivor down useless. And also, his power does nothing about Survivors that just wait at a pallet instead of looping. Plus, he has no stall, mobility, map pressure, or *anything*. Freddy basically has his ability in the form of a trap, with a bunch of extra stuff added on.
---
Legion is so low because, while he can get Survivors injured, he has no tools whatsoever to get them downed. The mobility he has is only 10% extra speed - which is less than what Play With Your Food gives you - and faster vaulting (1.1s), which is still over twice as slow as a Survivor fast vault (0.5s).
---
&gt; Ghost Face
---
Croquedead did say that Ghost Face is the Killer he knows the least about. But he makes a good point that Survivors can reveal you from the other side of a wall when you can't even see them, and it is frustrating as crap, especially when they reveal you in 1.5 seconds, and it takes 5s/2.5s to Expose them. Also, the wiki says that there's a 2 second delay before stalking commences, after hitting the button. 
---
But if the Survivor isn't running Spine Chill and there are enough line-of-sight blockers, I *can* see him getting an early first hook. Also, the stalk range is 8m longer than the reveal range.
---
&gt; you'd also have to hit the person fast enough to get your insta-down.
---
This applies to Ghost Face (whose mark only lasts 45 seconds, by the way), not Michael.
---
Good Michaels get their stalk meter to 99%, then wait until the last possible second to trigger Tier III. Infectious Fright then reveals nearby Survivors, and he can snowball from there. Ghost Face cannot snowball like this, as he needs to wait for his power cooldown again, and everyone knows he's there in the meantime, making stalking worthless. Even if Michael can't find the other Survivors, he still gets a full minute of free pressure. He also gets better lunges and vault speed to help him in chases.
---
I'm not sure how you see Ghost Face using his ability in chases when it takes a mere 1.5 seconds to disable it.
---
&gt; If you give the Survivor a huge enough window to just fuck off, the Pig misplayed
---
Having to crouch and charge the ability in an open loop gives the Survivor more than enough time to run out of range: she can cover 16m in 2.5s with the ambush, and the Survivor can run out of range in that time plus the crouch and charge times. 
---
The problem with line-of-sight blocking loops is that the Survivor can use the 3rd person camera to get an extra advantage. But I don't know enough about loops to say much more on the subject.
---
Although, strangely enough, Pig used to be [A tier on Croquedead's tier list](https://youtu.be/jEUfL7Ga2IE?list=PLQj48p5_Apvl5BgaVJnpoGzVgs3zNb9WC&amp;t=1193), and the only changes since then have been:
---
* Base crouch time changed from 2s to 1.3s
---
* Terror radius changed from 28m to 32m
---
* Terror radius fade changed from 6.6s to 4s
---
* RBTs aren't triggered by the exit gate
---
* Ambush is no longer considered a basic attack
---
He even noted that there aren't a lot of good Pig players out there. And [his Killers guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=943828847#2310222) was what taught me that the ambush could be used during loops.
---
Legion is still the worst designed killer. Change my mind.
---
This looks really good wel doneüòä
---
I STILL get random disconnects out of nowhere.
---
Working on a totem/gen, disconnect
---
Saving someone from the hook, disconnect.
---
I already had contact with customer support, sadly to no avail. 
---
I think 2 out of 10 games I get randomly disconnected.
---
Plague is far from balanced. The new build everyone is using for her makes her impossible to play against and it‚Äôs just not fun at all. You either stay broken, die in one hit and do objectives stupid slow, or cleanse and get destroyed by OP ranged hit. She is very poorly designed, I think instead of a nerf, a re-work is in order for her.
---
Hold on.. so the entire event is basically just a bonus bloodpoints?
---
Honestly? It sounds like you just need to mature some more. You need to dig deep and try to empathize with other people who are playing the game- maybe they're also tryhard and are upset with your plays, or maybe they're just playing for fun because it's *a game*. 
---
I'd suggest taking some screen breaks, or switching to different games that are less frustrating. It's not worth it to make yourself upset or to intentionally upset others by DC'ing or being toxic.
---
Yea, he does count on survivor mistakes and threading the needle around loops.
---
Demogorgon and Ghostface's moris are in a league of their own honestly.
---
Yuppers, at least on ps4 you can
---
Lol maybe ;)
---
Gotta Love that bill cough
---
Same but, David King David King David King
---
And for your previous comment that got hidden, spirit players have MUCH MORE information than survivors. Thats why its a one sided mind game with her.
---
We have perks in this game for a reason, WHY WOULD YOU PLAY WITHOUT OPTIMAL PERKS? Lmao imagine using "not every player has them" as an excuse. You're clearly stupid if you think not every player has stridor when its a nurse perk and EVERYONE owns nurse. How about you learn what you're talking about, next.
---
When the survivor that unhooks you is injured then they should still  take the body block unless on death hook.
---
God I love a perfectly cut scream. Something about the sudden panic and then silence kills me.
---
Both are fun, Ghost is a bit stronger but Myers has better perks
---
If you drop pallet instantly, a good Spirit will just guess which side you're on. 50/50 that she's right, if she's wrong she breaks the pallet and keeps chasing.
---
She doesn't need bloodlust, and you're going to burn through pallets best case scenario fast af cause you can't loop you have to drop immediately. Worst case scenario you lose the 50/50 early.
---
If you're already injured the 50/50 goes much more in her favor, especially if she's running stridor like most good Spirits do.
---
I don‚Äôt think either of them need changes at all. They are both in good spots in my opinion. But when they start to be the killer faced most often and they walk out with consistent 4ks the cries will come. I don‚Äôt think nerfing the spirit was originally in their plans either so that‚Äôs not a very good guarantee for me.
---
Looking around the internet most people agree with our definition of skill ceiling however, from what I can see very few people agree with your view on skill floor.
---
Your viewing the Skill skyscraper (to use a metaphor) as something which dictates the start of the climb, the higher up the starting floor is the easier the climb to the top
---
The view I (and others from what I can tell) see is that the skill floor is what must be climbed up to to begin, the higher the floor is from the bottom the harder it is to begin the journey.
---
I think both definitions can be used, but I believe finding which one to use as a universal constant is important and, as a result push the definition I have given
---
My favorite thing is joining a game, not knowing who the killer is, and the first indicator is the map wide screech from his first hit. It's just badass.
---
I haven't been in a game where this has happened, but I'd probably feel the fear of god.
---
Little bit of cheese
---
On PC you can't anymore it's like hitting a wall
---
What about lobby dodging makes you some kind of better person? 
---
I asked for people's reasons for lobby dodging, not "does everyone lobby dodge?" There's no reason to be an asshole and shove both your own legs down your throat in the process.
---
God I wish that were me
---
I relate to this. I play on ps4 and killers are so petty. They get one hook and they'll camp like it's their IRL bank account
---
Also I hope you understand I'm not saying LF isn't good in the right hands, as any killer is. This is strictly an issue of skill ceiling. His just happens to be lowest
---
Can we at least get a leather face cosmetics I mean yah you can say the survivor faces count as a cosmetic but I mean leather face has some many appearance in the movie take the 2003 reboot the pretty lady one you where talking about their just so many For leatherface  we just have to wait because look at the pig it  took a almost year to have a cosmetic for her.
---
&gt; le pc mustard race
---
This actually made me lol.
---
And yeaa, as a ps4 player I‚Äôd really prefer to only play with other console players. The post game chat would also have to end up being added to all platforms (nice!), kept for only pc players (boo!), or removed all together (extra boo!). The framerate difference is also night vs. day and I absolutely do not think BHVR would fix console‚Äôs fps issues beforehand.
---
What I‚Äôm trying to argue is they shouldn‚Äôt have to take a body block because you should wait for the killer to leave before unhooking, other then certain circumstances like EGC about to happen and stuff like that.
---
So try hard is mad that other people are try hards? LOL this is the typical DBD player for sure
---
I would love to but honestly, it takes too much time. Printing and shipping everything for my shop is already taking me more than a few hours a week. Painting just one took me 3+ hours, and it still needs a bit of work. I'd have to at least double the price, but even at $60, I can only invest so much time into painting. I feel the quality would suffer unless I sold these @$20/hr=~$80+ for it to actually look good after 3 hours of detailing. A solid hour if that is just sanding it.
---
That's not the issue. A lot of looping and decisions come from looking behind you at what the killer is doing and third person allows a little view in front as well that can let you know if you've run into something. It also allows you to peak around corners and stay competitive with the killer that is much faster than you.
---
It seems most of the community can at least respect a good Huntress. She's a high skill ceiling killer, but has counterplay and is pretty fun to play against in my opinion. I've been meaning to play a bit of Huntress to try her out because of how fun it is to play against her.
---
In the actual game data, not gonna give specific details as to where to make it easier for some individuals, but whoever knows some of the basic files can find it himself, its been mentioned since demogorgon ptb I believe.
---
I say every rank reset that I‚Äôm gonna just play chill and not have to worry about the sweatiness of red ranks but i always end up finding myself there again and hating it.
---
I don't really play Killer but isn't the point to be patrolling gens.
---
Plague is a nobody, don't worry.
---
There should be full crossplay between W10 and Steam so you should easily find matches. Maybe the first few ranks will be harder due to the separate matchmaking AFAIK but after that you are fine. 
---
Game Pass is honestly insane value, get it if you can.
---
Yeah means I'm not a coward and I don't disrespect others times queues for survivor can be brutal.  Killers got plenty of shit they play survivors don't want to face yet you have the balls to rip on them for DC's when you're essentially doing the same thing from the pre lobby.  It's hypocritical and sad af
---
Maybe I‚Äôm not being clear enough.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that only Spirit, Nurse and Billy can kill at red ranks. Yes, the average killer will be capable of beating an average 4 man squad.
---
But. When against an optimal 4 man SWF that are bringing Toolboxes, Keys, and flashlights, you just aren‚Äôt going to beat them with Wraith. Or Trapper. Ghostface will make them sweat.
---
Spirit is picked against them for a reason. And only Spirit.
---
Tbh the only about Freddy that I dislike is the timer to sleep, it kinda gives away the killer and could be a hit slower? and how little I can see while sleeping, but I don't think he needs any real changes
---
The devs literally changed Billy's difficulty rating. They went through the trouble of doing so because they realized he's a fucking joke to learn.
---
Thats not exactly the answer I was looking for. Lobby dodging is when. You leave the lobby before the match even starts to avoid certain people or things. 
---
Dcing or hook suicide isn't a good thing.
---
Meg, Nea, Dwight. I committed to the OGs...
---
I‚Äôm finding that frustrating, I mean every single match is a stressful sweaty try hard game and I have to play the same way or get completely destroyed. Then whether I play well, play fair or get rekt my inbox fills up with toxic messages from people. -_-
---
Dont nerf her. Rework her.
---
Nerfing her will destroy her completely, and thats what survivor mains want. They wont rest until every killer is completely weak
---
Sure
---
Matchmaking times need to be a priority
---
Oh totally, custom music really does go a long way. Being chased by the Demogorgon feels more intense to me for that reason.
---
I'm suggesting these changes because this would fix the only thing that makes me horribly mad about keys. 
---
I can deal with survivors suddenly escaping my 3 Gen doc, it is fair, okay. I can deal with survivors suddenly escaping my EGC builds when I already locked up the exit gates.
---
But what I can't deal with, is that when survivor just uses the key mid-chase. When a survivor acts extremely confident, because he knows that I have no way of catching him when he has a key and is standing on hatch. When I close the hatch and then he just immediately opens it.
---
This makes keys extremely cancerous and there is no counterplay to that. You may say I need to use franklin or just "don't let them do gens before they get to use keys etc" but these arguments are stupid for obvious reasons: Franklin still doesn't fully counter the key, as survivor can just leave it somewhere and pick up later or he can find the key in trial, when I didn't bring the franklin because I saw no keys there. As for not letting do gens, last survivor still gets hatch and I still can't do much about it.
---
P.S. 100% escape rate survivor build: Left Behind, Plunderer, Distortion, Iron Will, Lightweight + Dull/Skeleton key. Play extremely stealthy and there you go. Into the hatch.
---
Except Spirit has needed something done to her for a while. 
---
You can't mind game that which can't be mind gamed. She's not fun to go against. 
---
She's boring to play with after a few games, assuming tge survivors haven't disconnected already. 
---
You just have to hope the player is new to her or just incompetent. Anyone half decent as her or wearing headphones better than $50 has to much map control as her by default, at which point its just luck and no skill involved.
---
Freddy needed a rework to stay viable. He's a much more effective and fun killer with his powers receiving a major overhaul and his add-ons are just mostly ineffective. 
---
Nurse didn't really need a "rework" and she's still mostly the same with her add-ons getting most of the "rework' 
---
Spirit, however, needed to rework before Nurse was ever considered.
---
That‚Äôs kinda hot
---
the fact that she literally becomes blind to survivors when using her power as well as not being able to vault is a perfectly reasonable downside to being able to move at that speed. simply because she might be able to bump into you does not make her OP, and does not need to be removed.
---
the fact is, the looping mechanics of this game are ridiculous, and usually favor survivors unreasonably, since a killer's only counter is mindgaming, which is impossible at loops you can see over. Spirit levels the playing field on these loops by introducing the potential that she **could** mindgame you there, at the cost of being unable to vault and going blind. 
---
survivors are just pissed off because their OP weapon, high visibility loops, can be effectively countered by the Spirit with some skill and risk. and they can still counter her, just in different way than they're used to. and what happens? they bitch and complain they can't counter her at all. nevermind that she literally can't see them.
---
Jason doesnt teleport either yet here we are
---
I'm glad you didn't. The lead to to the Nerf was straight up cancer with the sheer amount of insta heals everyone had.
---
No worries! The thing with dictionaries is that they're usually not too great at toeing the line between being overly simple and overly specific. I guess it's an artefact of the olden analogue days where pages were numbered. Especially when it comes to complex concepts that take a bit more than just a few lines to elaborate, the reliability of dictionaries suffers - including the cases where there's a bit of controversy on definitions of a term, like in this case.
---
In those cases, advanced reading material is required. Many times, subject-oriented glossaries are necessary. These take the time to present a more nuanced definition and take the necessary detours to establish a clear picture. Additionally, textbooks and papers are a common form of establishing consensus. The topic of homonyms is a classic linguistics 101 thing that shouldn't really be causing this much of a ruckus but people really don't like being called out for not making much sense.
---
BECAUSE IT IS UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST KILLER WHO HAS NOED ON YOU AND IF SHE IS NOT YOU ARE GOING DOWN IN LESS THAN 20 SECONDS, REEEEEEEEEE.

PC/console crossplay would break the quality of games on both ends in a bad way due to the advantages a keyboard/mouse have over controller.
---
The question Bill, Quentin, Freddy, and Leatherface mains are all asking.
---
You just need to relax even when you are playing seriously. You can‚Äôt control the outcome or how other people play but you can control your actions and reactions. 
---
I‚Äôve ran into a lot of situations where people do silly things, just last match someone cleansed haunted grounds when ruin was already cleansed causing everyone to be exposed. I ended up dying because of it as well as everyone else but it‚Äôs honestly just a game. 
---
I go in with the expectation that I will die every time so if I do I‚Äôm not overly upset about it, but if my team plays well and we win then I‚Äôm overjoyed.
---
What if her father isn't related at all
---
Remember the spirit teaser? "It's gonna be a samurai killer" spirit popped
---
That's too obvious, therefore discard that idea
---
I seem like a person who does not understand why I should care about anybody else's fun if I am not having fun in the first place.
---
Sleepy Boi, best boi.
---
I hope they rework Legion. There has to be a middle ground between their release state and their current state. I'd probably main them if they were viable, I have a blast with them
---
Yeah you should, once you are back you can tell us what this comment was about :)
---
It goes then so does the player immediately after they cleansed it
---
Yeah, all of that is obvious. Idk about you, but the core gameplay of dbd is not scary in the slightest. First person would make it actually scary for survivors. Core aspects of the game would have to be changed, but things like improved auditory clues for survivors, innate spine chill, and a longer red stain visual among other things would help with decision making during a chase.
---
Outside of the gameplay not being scary, the vast amount of bugs instantly takes you out of any ounce of horror the game manages to conjure up. 
---
Finally, the survivors being essentially just skins and behaving exactly the same leaves them feeling lifeless, and I end up not really caring what happens to them. In most horror films, you want to root for your favorite character to survive. This feeling is absent in dbd because the characters have almost no personality.
---
Just keep watching and eventually it will go up.
---
I thought it was Nea
---
Doing you, gens?
---
Rins father is getting added to the game
---
But i want a killer that has multiple controlable bodies )':
---
Your right ig I didn't think about that
---
Please do keep calling me an entitled survivor when 90% of my solo time is me playing Legion. PLEASE. It makes me so happy.
---
Regardless of whether he wins or not, a doctor running straight to three close gens and only shocking gens for 30 minutes is holding the game hostage. I will report him and dc at the 30 minute mark, because I'm not playing the game at that point. I'm just watching a bar go up and down for half an hour and holding m1.
---
Probably yeah. Although it seems easier said then doneüò¨. Irl I honestly am barely annoyed with people when it comes to skill, yet online I am. Thanks!
---
I can‚Äôt tell if ur being serious or not
---
Sorry, you had a stroke while typing this?
---
Was hilarious tbh
---
How is that toxic? lmao
---
Exactly. I absolutely don't want to see Spirit become a garbage tier killer, but she needs reliable counter play that isn't straight up guessing. Its a bit like old Legion who wasn't even a high tier killer, but had a serious lack of counter play.
---
Someone else watched the Sean O‚ÄôMalley ‚Äúfunny‚Äù weigh in highlights today too?
---
This was in public tho
---
Happy Cake Day
---
We tried to but they left for some reason
---
ZA WARU wait hang on
---
Haha
---
This is actually really helpful. Thank you!
---
Yeah, reveal is weird. It needs some changes.
---
Survivors shouldn't be able to reveal GF when they are completely hidden by something and there is no way for GF to stalk them. Survivors shouldn't be able to reveal GF when he hides behind the wall, but revealing still goes on.
---
GF shouldn't be able to just stand without any cover and still be unrevealed.
---
I love spine chill but sometimes i get too scared when it lit up but have no idea where the stealth killer is and ran into them face to face.
---
Certain Survivors already have outfits that make them look sorta like some of the L4D crew (silently cries in no Louis outfit), but actually getting them as playable characters would definitely be cool.
---
Well,  I am. NOW STOP CLEANSING LITS TOTEMS YOU-
---
Xbox as well.
---
he was abused by his father
---
*It really do be like that sometimes*
---
What's wrong with freddy lmao? He can be annoying sometimes, but he has counterplay and he is definitely not broken
---
Yeah I really like legions aesthetics and animations, it's a shame that playing him makes me want to die
---
Some of us been on that Spine Chill wave ü•∫ü§Æ
---
I can get them if I tunnel. However I don't wanna tunnel survivors over other survivors. It's not really effective
---
So much bitching over something so small, who cares fr
---
I‚Äôve always hate spirit and wanted her gone but I guess I‚Äôm in the minority
---
As others mentioned, it's really the fault of the survivor that unhooked when you were close by. I like to play with the mantra that you should punish those survivors. Let the unhooked survivor escape and go after the saviour, because they're the ones screwing people over.
---
If it's teabagging at the exit gate you mean there's little you can do about it, if the game is lost just go on your phone for two minutes or if you really want to punish it noed + blood warden. 
---
If it's shit like teabagging or pointing after throwing down a pallet just try to think tactically about it. It used to annoy me, now I just enjoy them wasting their chance to gain some distance.
---
100% escape rate with a guaranteed depip yeah. And yeah, watching them escape into the hatch mid chase is aggravating, but it's also the most clutch play ever and more than worth it for the survivors while being somewhat rare for the killer. I honestly think that it's fine the way I suggest, but as I said before it's a matter of preference. We both know that the odds of this actually getting implemented aren't good, I'm just trying to strike up some healthy debate that focuses on discussion rather than barbs so the devs might get a clearer picture of what the players want. I appreciate the input, and I gotta admit that yours is a pretty cool idea
---
I feel that instead of making the good killer add ons trash tier BHVR could just make them rarer
---
&gt; They're extremely dumb **if your teammates are the usual potatoes.**
---
the problem here is the teammates, not the add on. though I'd actually be ok with them removing the insta-down ability, *as long as* they remove the survivor's ability to get a speed boost when getting hit. they simply shouldnt be rewarded for a failure, especially when the levels are filled with OP loops and killers already have a fairly long cooldown even if they miss. that speed boost shit would be like if killers were caused to move faster every time they get stunned.
---
Friday does still get patches and fixes, just no new content.
---
I never said it made sense I just said it would be cool
---
Shes bugged in that video, thats not even relevant
---
This. Killer queues on PC are unsustainable especially for ranks higher than 4 and ranks lower than 16. I returned to the game after nearly a year off, and it has been impossible to get into a single game as rank 20 killer (US East) and I've tried every troubleshooting/timing tip imaginable. Queues in some regions (South America and Europe at times) are approaching close to an hour.
---
&gt; Survivor mains who love to put prayer beads as the reason to nerf the entire spirit is toxic af as well. 
---
Or you could just go off the Devs who have confirmed [that Spirit is very clearly overperforming in all their killer stats](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/501700970?t=1h2m32s) as the reason for it. But yes it's only prayer beads.
---
Or maybe there are such things as bad killers, and people prefer to play killers with competent powers. The power gap between the Spirit and Billy is huge, so if Billy is OP, what does that make Spirit?
---
Ruin is fucking weak
---
Thank you. 
---
I was wondering if there was a surefire way to counter it.
---
He's my main and I got him to triple prestige during the 3rd year anniversary event, I had like 60 Gatue left afterwards. Every game I make like 96k because of BBQ and the Gatue, if there's a 2x Bloodhound it's even more.
---
Thats why you have to edit rules like: predefined map for specific mission, preedited killer with defined perks, can be included a selection of various Survs with predefined perks.
---
The problem with this is the same problem with SMITE's crossplay, which is that it is turned on by default and only those who care to look at forums, news, etc. would actually know it exists considering most people who play these games don't really look at anything.
---
So if you turn it off, a large percent of the community would not. What thens procedes is the realization that your wait times will be huge if you don't turn the crossplay option back on. 
---
At least that was my experience playing SMITE after coming back to that game a few years ago, completely killed the experience. Not sure how it will work out in practice though.
---
But it is necessary to keep surivors off gens in the beginning
---
Genji : A steady blade balances the soul
---
Spirit: What the actual fuck?
---
Not being able to Outplay the killer at all, having to guess in order to survive, getting no feedback that I‚Äôm about to get hit rather that quiet footsteps that I can‚Äôt trust. There‚Äôs no counter play to her, it‚Äôs not fun.
---
No better feeling than playing against prayer bead spirit, getting hooked then watching her phase grab the unsuspecting random trying to do the gen.
---
If anyone thinks there‚Äôs counter play to the spirit, you‚Äôre wrong and know nothing. If you can outplay a spirit, then you‚Äôre playing against a shitty player, thats all.
---
I main Ghostface. I get consistent 4ks. Usually if I don't its because of a key. They are in higher tier atm. When spirit gets adjusted someone will jump her from high tier to top. When that happens the talk will start about whoever that ends up being needing to be adjusted as well. Whether it be an add on or something from their base kit. Wait and see.
---
Oh right, I was pleasantly surprised to see nb as an option! 
---
The survey covered a lot of things too, I definetely didn't expect that
---
Nothing about dedicated servers? No questions about Spirit/the new map? Early impressions about the rift or Nurse rework?
---
K guys, appreciate it.
---
*1 2 Nancy‚Äôs coming for you*
---
&gt; They buffed medkits massively
---
Mostly medium buffs to healing speeds for others only, I wouldn't call it a massive buff. They also cut efficiency AND charges on emergency medkit.
---
&gt; changing instal heals into a portable Mettle of Man
---
That is a *massive* nerf, don't act like it isn't.
---
&gt; i specified trolling the entire 3minute collapse
---
You're literally whining about BHVR not doing anything about it, but it's a mechanic that was *introduced to stop* the exact kind of trolling you are talking about. *forehead*
---
A counter as in showing how many are left.
---
I love doing fire bones
---
If you're playing against a bad Plague she shouldn't get to M1 you in the first place.
---
Nah that‚Äôs just what people are hoping is gonna happen but it probably won‚Äôt
---
Crotchless onsie myers
---
Do you actually search for any posts that talk about "Billy" and "nerf" in the same sentence? Hahaha
---
I respect that
---
cheers mate!  I'll try those suggestions.  Much appreciated
---
Done and dusted. Grad school forced me away from DbD but being unable to completely play killer since returning does not bode well for me continuing to play the game. I've been unable to get in a single game as Killer since returning a few weeks ago.
---
I swear to god every survivor is an ochido fanboy who bitches and complains if they can't bully a killer.
---
Something like that haha.
---
Occasional random disconnects are fine. There should be no punishment other than maybe a short time out before you can requeue, maybe 5 minutes. That's usually how much time it takes you to close and restart the app in some cases. 
---
We are specifically talking about people who either hit Escape and mash Leave Game, or straight up pull the plug on their connection when they are on a match they don't want to play. This goes for killer and survivor. When you click Join Game, ready up and sit through a loading screen, you know what you are getting into.
---
That being said I still think that there should be a "Quick Match" option that is the current queue and a "Ranked Ladder" that allows killers to ban 4 perks and survivors to ban one killer each, along with a vote on map ban by survivors and a map ban by killer. You could draft Dodge at any time without incident but the flipside is that punishments for disconnects in this mode during a game in progress would be severe.
---
Lmao
---
Bc I said small game needs to show totem auras you say o don't play killer, ight
---
Yeah, I play it on the Windows Store with gamepass, matchmaking times have been very quick for me, almost instant. It shows an icon next to their name if they're playing on Steam and 99% of the other players you encounter will be Steam players, there isn't a difference apart from the lack of post-game chat on the Windows Store version for some reason.
---
what are the worst add ons for doctor and which ones are the best?
---
Anyway this is pointless, as devs going to do what they want to make it "less frustrating".
---
Are you suggesting that to earn the achievement all you have to do is survive? Just play a character and get out?
---
 How about the killer? Any 4-K should earn an achievement then, right? Because 4-K with their own 3 perks and Merciless (aka double pip) is very hard already. 
---
Just wondering how much of a test of skill uou propose be removed from the game.
---
You are free to do whatever you want, personally when this happen i down the unhooked guy and chase the rescuer. To make sure he learn the lesson i tunnel him until death. Post game chat is hilarious since he get insulted by is own teammates.
---
So Spirit's my third most played killer and well, I'm from US West in red ranks so I see her as survivor every 5th game too lol. Here's my take on Spirit changes:
---
Changes: prayer beads no longer eliminate the phasing sound. Instead they reduce the radius of the sound while you're in phase. Lets you get much closer to gens in phase for a free hit but doesnt give you a free gen grab everytime you press m2 with Surveillance. If they want to get extra spicy they could do three addons for slightly, moderately, considerably that don't stack and Prayer Beads could be the considerably. 
---
Keep collisions. If Spirit bumps into you in phase you lost the mixup. Your mixups vs Spirit should be designed such that she doesn't bump into you. Things like putting the pallet down on the opposite side, or not walking right next to the loop instead a few feet away, or doubling back on your scratch marks when she starts to phase all leave you plenty room to not run into her if you play it correctly. If she plays it correctly and does read where you go (because a LOT of Spirit is guess work) the collision allows her to have confirmation that she made the correct read. Without collision she just randomly has to come out of phase at the perfect moment with no indication as to whether to swing. It basically makes the extended lunge after her power useless because she'll need more of that time to reaquire the target. Not to mention that she is especially weak to window loops since she can't vault while phasing and you can track if she went the long way by watching the grass. 
---
The spooky girl has plenty of counters and I think the community overexaggerates how strong she is. I feel like she gets so much hate because you can't traditionally loop her, you have to play a more deliberate positioning game. I feel like if more survivors understood what was good against her they would actually start to like the killer. She's one of my favorite to go against without Prayer Beads tbh, you get so rewarded for making her miss and go on cooldown that you can go on some huge chases if you read well.
---
there is no way valve is giving a green light for bill cosmetics after all the shirtless daddy memes
---
The egc timer was almost up so he didn't have a choice.
---
That sounds really bad tbh or at the least unnecessary as hell.
---
The only way to make this less of a problem would be making it only available in custom matches with friends.
---
I also have a background in the subject. And I do agree with you here, don't get me wrong. Maybe I was a bit overeager to correct the issue as I belong into the "true homonyms are the only actual homonyms" camp and all my ling professors did too. 
---
But choosing to use "big words" but not using them properly is a douchey move imo, so I don't really have any reservations about criticising OP. Using homophone instead of homonym would be more accurate regardless of definition and is such a minor change. As it stands, the tweet (and the loud people arguing) only lead to more people forming a misconception regarding the definitions.
---
From what I understand is that they implemented it during a PTB but didn‚Äôt roll it out because people just abused it.
---
Hag for me
---
You can scratch mark juke her with collisions just fine. You have to mix in walking and running and position yourself in an unlikely spot for her to run into. If she bumps into you that means you were too predictable after she started phasing.
---
In before devour‚Äôs 4th stack. You‚Äôre welcome
---
Dude its gonna be a pinecone as killer not rins dad nor mom
---
In my opinion, some of the best killers in the game are in the competitive community, but most of them don't stream themselves and/or people just don't really follow the competitive side of the game. I've played against many of those players and that really proves my point but, again, people just don't follow the competitive community at all. Its still a small part of it though, in which surprisingly russians make a big part of it.
---
Are you a red rank killer?
---
EVERYONE VOTE IN FAVOR OF CROSS-PLAY, BUT STATE THAT CONSOLES MUST BE BALANCED WITH BETTER OPTIMIZATION AND AIM ASSIST!
---
Its luck based, who are you watching play against these Spirits?
---
My Devour Hope approves of this advice
---
In a good way?
---
Sure, premonition is nice to have, you'll know the killer is within a certain range, but with spine chill you'll know hes headed right for you.
---
Deranking fucking sucks. I'm an ok killer for someone who doesnt play too often. I am at about rank 12 and ended up complimenting someone for playing a chase well. Their response was "yeah it wasn't a big deal I have thousands of hours and this is just one of my smurfs". That mad me feel good for killing him but I felt how gray ranks would feel if they got stomped from a high skilled player that cant handle playing against others their skill level. 
---
Tl;dr: Dont derank, it sucks
---
That doesn't fix the issue with her though.
---
You can moonwalk on console; you might break your joystick learning, but it's doable.
---
Its very nice
---
Spirit complaints are not new, people have been complaining about her since she was buffed out of being trash.
---
You insist you‚Äôre not entitled, but you still cry about how other players need to play the way **you** say or you‚Äôll DC *and report them*.
---
Like hell, you‚Äôre the worst of them, aren‚Äôt ya? You‚Äôre literally saying you would report your opponent for trying to win the game. And somehow you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre entitled.
---
Check out pain reliever for videos in which he plays against killers stealthfully or the one that describes how to use spinechill those are pretty useful
---
have you tried realizing that you cant see through walls megamind
---
Sounds like that knucklehead in tf2, elder god something, actively got pissed at valve for banning him for using hacks in games which he showed on YouTube as his content.
---
Oh I have no issue juking her since I play her so I know how most players think when they play spirit but I mean for newer players will get ruined because of it especially since matchmaking sucks. Even for experienced players who dont play spirit have issues with the collision thing since most players jolt for the nearest pallet
---
It would be cool if it was the other way around?
---
I tried watching fungoose a couple of times but he comes off so annoying and condescending in the way he talks and acts it's unbearable.
---
Exactly this! People are so caught up and immersed that they forget there are other things in this game besides escaping out the exit gate. The only thing I really enjoy about escaping is the music that plays when you run out. Otherwise I try to focus on my actions in game. I enjoy looping so I try to run the killer for as long as possible. If I am not running then you best believe I'll be on a gen, saving a hooked teammate or cleansing some totems.
---
Well then just delete her and move on to nerfing ghostface and plague.
---
Ik I love my Vietnam outfit for bill
---
Rank 1 pal.
---
Imagine the taste
---
I mean personally I never teabag in any game unless I beat a very toxic opponent, but DS isn't a gimme so a short celebration is understandable.
---
A buddy of mine and i have spitballed ranfom ideas before. I personally would ask nothing else Except make them faster. Theyre the youngest most spry of the killers. And they're whole idea is "run fast with knife" if they had a Slightly faster base speed and faster but shorter frenzy. It would already be better as they have their raw speed to help in chases.
---
Imb4 they hit you after the 8 second endurance but before the 16 second heal.
---
Exactly, he was protecting himself from Adrenalin.
---
 I borrowed them, sorry!
---
&gt;!No seriously, only the support can help you!!&lt;
---
As a console player, I will say that Huntress is quite good, and aiming with her is perfectly comfortable, but Nurse is utterly atrocious. She gets a slowdown after teleporting, making turning extremely difficult, and usually ending in missed attacks + annoying fatigue.
---
The lunar year... DAVID... Cosmetics? That's my big "Dafuq" of all that.. sadly I haven't heard if any items being misplaced my man.
---
The idea of the entity torturing Rins dad by him being killed by demonic versions of his wife and daughter is cool to me... Why does that bother you?
---
A+ btw)
---
I don't know why, but her smacking the shit outta them with her item when it starts always makes me giggle. Would've been better if she did something other than puke on them, though, even if they just change it to her puking corrupt purge, since it actually damages survivors.
---
Git gud
---
Yeah for sure, they're the best moris in the game imo
---
When the fuck did they introduce the nerf where you can't move forward after setting a trap or there's an 80% chance you trap yourself? It's annoying as shit.
---
It literally doesn't I just commented on the error. Plus entity feeds off hope not fear.
---
No they aren't completely different that's just something douches like you tell yourself so you don't feel like a piece of shit doing it.  It's the same thing.  You're disconnecting from the lobby.  They disconnect from the game because they can't see you and your loadout.  It's the same thing and yes it absolutely does make me a better player and killer for not doing it.
---
If they added aim assist and fixed the optimization issues (no FPS dips), I'd be fine with it.
---
And then when you run ruin it just disappeared when you get into a chase with any damn survivor
---
As someone who plays fairly well on PC with a gamepad I wouldn't mind cross play with consoles. But I defiantly want cross progression. I have it on my switch xbox and pc and sometimes I just wanna play it in bed or  on my xbox in my living room. But my PC has my best progression
---
High rank killer queues are super fast on PC
---
Instead of 2 hits you get 2+ hits omg so useless, much nerf
---
Even if you happen to guess right, the feeling of 'outplaying' your opponent just isn't there. You just guessed right
---
They need to incorporate custom chase music, it would do so much
---
As much as this community shits on the devs, they really do try to please us. I think we should be more appreciative of their work.
---
The entity actually feeds on all strong emotions.. Like the killers rage and the survivors desperation
---
that's exactly it. there's a long history of BHVR nerfing killers, even weak ones, when survivors complain a lot, even when they counter play is obvious. that's how original Freddy ended up nerfed so bad. complaining about Legion gave him unreasonable nerfs that weakened things they never even complained about. Then Nurse got nerfed, even though she's only good on 1 of the 4 systems this game is available on, and is near unplayable on the others. once BHVR announced they were successful at that, within about 48 hours, the forums were filled with complaints about Spirit being "uncounterable" that no one had mentioned before. It's just so transparent.
---
potato
---
1. Trapper (I dont want to talk about it) 
---
2. Nurse 
---
3. Legion (Ptsd) 
---
All the other killers are fine
---
Why do people honestly think the devs will just listen blindly to the loud minority still? Billy was never changed, nurse got a healthy change, GF was never fixed, killers still have OP addons, moris are still OP ect. 
---
Spirit has an issue and it needs to be addressed, I don't enjoy playing against plague or GF but they are not getting changed, GF just needs his power to work properly
---
I dont think its exaggeration that shes strong when you just admitted yourself you see her every few games at the highest ranks lol. I'm not saying shes broken but she is definitely  one of the strongest killers in the game without question
---
Honestly while I personally love the horror aspect, most of my friends won't touch the game because of it. Which is sad because at its core it's a fun and wholly unique PVP experience.
---
Yep, I'd never want to repeat the grind. It takes way too long to do it once, let alone two or more times.
---
They aren‚Äôt just bad- Most are actually not even worth the BP! 
---
https://i.redd.it/6wpggcswwax31.png
---
Int3r4ct‚Äôs chart showing the changes made by each add on.
---
Well plenty of things things I want nerfed in survivors as well. Keys is like a cheat/hack, you can simply cut the objectives in half and still get an escape for free. God loops which is insurmountable to any killer except the spirit and the nurse. Oh damn that‚Äôs why y‚Äôall want to nerf the spirit, is it because your safe harbor for bad survivors are gone because you‚Äôre insecure even in the god loops. Next.
---
Lobby dodging is leaving a lobby before a match or any points are beginning to be earned. 
---
Disconnecting from a match looses the points you just earned and stunts the points of you teammates. 
---
One is just clicking a button to leave a lobby and the other is a reportable offence. They are no where near the same thing. 
---
You have no idea what you're even talking about. Why even come into a comment with such an aggressive opinion that I didn't even ask for. 
---
It's fine that you disagree with me and don't lobby dodge and don't like people who do lobby dodge but there's nothing productive about your approach to the topic.
---
Ok thanks. I totally agree with you. Just for context what are some of the overpowered add ons that killers and survivors have?
---
It‚Äôs simple. One of them is the killer.
---
* General Spam - Extremely low effort and/or zero effort posts.
---
This.  
---
If they added features to even the field when it comes to ease of control, I would be much less apprehensive about cross play between PC and console (PS4 here).
---
Because they have done it before. Spirit giving an obvious tell that she is phasing isn't enough for you. Why do you think you should be able to win against a killer 1 on 1?
---
At least Legion's lore is realistic to their gameplay
---
Nah, he's fine. Takes about 3 matches to earn 2 fragments.
---
Spirit has counterplay. and the fact is, there have been many nerfs to survivor abilities over time because the game started out unreasonably survivor sided due to many flaws. and it still is, but it's getting better.
---
the fact is, if one side has dozens of unfair advantages, and the other has like 3, removing 2 from each side doesn't make it "fair."
---
This is my biggest concern as well in getting DBD on multiple platforms. I'd love to get it for my Switch or the upcoming mobile version but the concept of all my progression and cosmetics being locked to PC gives me serious pause.
---
I copied my three posts and broke them down. None of them were mean with directed attacks *until* you said you DC.
---
Your hypocritical ‚Äúcare about my fun, but I don‚Äôt care about anyone else‚Äù outlook is what makes you an entitled crybaby. No matter how you project that it doesn‚Äôt change that everything is right there in your own comments.
---
There‚Äôs a goddamned reason you‚Äôre so heavily downvoted and I‚Äôm upvoted. 
---
And yeah, the killer can‚Äôt dictate your fun. THAT‚ÄôS MY WHOLE FUCKING POINT. You‚Äôre trying to dictate the killer‚Äôs fun. I‚Äôm saying no one has the right to dictate how anyone else plays the game. You‚Äôre arguing against that, but ONLY in your favor. 
---
That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre nothing but a hypocritical, entitled asshole who throws a tantrum. So fuck off crybaby.
---
I'm 99.9% sure it's a red herring and he most certainly will not be in the game. I personally think they're going to do this a few more times with other things in the game, start removing little items from different Maps to hint at the next chapter.
---
The rage was explained by what he did to her mother. You can doubt it but is that a assumption or do you have a secret dbd lore book somewhere that no one knows about?
---
Agreeing with you 100000%
---
I have no issues with Huntress (for the most part), but trying to aim Nurse's blink AND get a hit on the survivor is god awful.
---
Just always hit perfect skillchecks. 4Head
---
Not like it completely ruins team repairing cuz it's nearly impossible for multiple people to hit every skillcheck perfect. And every game becomes a treasure hunt because 95% of killers use this skill. Probably all of the killers are idiots cuz by your words it's super easy for survivors to play around it.
---
You would get more surprise hits in people trying to work gens. with spirit a chase of an injured is ended quickly so you dont lose one of your precious gens.
---
I pray this means we are close to cross-play since it was asked about. I'd really enjoy that.
---
The issue with instaheals was downing a survivor and having a cheeky boi get the to full health while you were still wiping your weapon.
---
Now you get borrowed time for 9 seconds.
---
Big fuckin difference.
---
One gen needs to be left in order for a key to be used if four survivors remain, they did four gens for an escape and have to find the hatch so it seems pretty fair to me. Compare that to an ebony mori that requires one hook before you can execute survivors and its completely fine.
---
There are barely any god loops in this game, most of them require balanced landing, are they an issue? Yes. Are they a common problem? No.
---
You still have provided 0 ways to counter a spirit so try again.
---
Seriously, I die a little inside every time I see a console player boast about their instant killer queues while I'm waiting 5-10 minutes or more to play killer on PC.
---
I like running it just for fun really I enjoy being scary when I play killer
---
They were asking about original killers. Of course all the licensed killers are bastards.
---
Phase speed nerf would be terrible indeed. I frankly couldn‚Äôt careless about addon nerfs or phasing animation or calling animation etc. the only thing I want to keep is phase speed and also recovery. Visible during the phase walk removes the whole characteristic about the spirit. Then it‚Äôs only fair to allow her to see survivors as well. Both sides can see each other. And now she can phase. LOL that‚Äôll be a classic serve you right situation. You asked for it you get it.
---
I completed the survey and was then redirected to the surveymonkey site which asked me to create a free account. That was the end of it right? Because I didn‚Äôt feel like creating an account.
---
If you watched Zubat or Ryan for long enough you'd see that they 4k at 2 gens down only against teams that don't know what they are doing. I've seen plenty of matches where they got like 1-2 kills max and they get ran around the whole match.
---
(Here, have an example.)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px_Kct9rWwM]
---
The only problem Billy has are his add ons, and the devs said those are being looked at. Instasaw's days are counted.
---
There needs to be more down sides for him setting traps. Hag and Trapper both have to completely stop, go into animation for seconds, then move again. They even lose sight of the survivor during said animation. Freddy? You can literally spam it during a chase with zero repercussions. I've seen streamers just spam the ability "just cause" while they are just looking for a survivor. I know your argument would be "it requires the survivor to be asleep", but that means nothing when the survivor falls naturally asleep so quickly, even during a chase. 
---
Is he overpowered? I don't think so. But he is up there with old legion annoying alone while still being insanely strong.
---
No loving father can just "break" from being overworked and stressed. If thats how mental issues worked we would have 1/2 the population left.
---
Steve and Dwight are the only acceptable answers in my book. (Maybe Ash since I really like The Evil Dead).
---
noob3 is toxic and part of the problem
---
Fungoose is amazing smh
---
Agreed. Which is why I think they're trying to push crossplay as an option. It would greatly improve MM times.
---
Ok boomer
---
Ah yes, hooking a person or two before someone else's DS timer expires is now tunneling, thank you for enlightening me /s
---
His arms are blue &amp; his eyes are split. 0/10
---
Yeah me too Freddy was already nerfed to the ground once
---
Which is odd because I see the scratch marks with the MDR still when I phase. Weird. Maybe a bug.
---
Hell yeah. PS I hope?
---
Holy mother forking shirt balls. The killers the MOM
---
Nothing to wake you up like an unexpected hag trap!
---
There's an entire write in section at the end. You can add all that if you want.
---
Frankly as a spirit main I don‚Äôt give a damn about nerfing spirit addons and giving her a vault animation or phase walk indication or sound indication even. The only thing that I see that‚Äôs significant to a spirits power is her speed in the phase walk. As long as we keep this characteristic, I can still use spirit to own the game. Seriously, I personally couldn‚Äôt bother mindgaming at the pallet or window etc or using prayer beads to jump scare people. The most common addons I use are speedboost and phase walk recovery speed boost. That‚Äôs prolly all she needs anyways.
---
P3 Claudette invisible memeing.

This right here is why the community is so hated. Hopefully your life gets better friend.
---
This is a perfect example of the community not having actual discussion and just calling the opposition stupid or complainers. I don‚Äôt even main a side but as soon as I say something that helps one side I get called an ‚Äúx main‚Äù.
---
That's Japanese culture though. They work more than any other country and having mental breakdowns is common. That's why they take precautions in high rise buildings so people dont jump out to end their lives. It makes plenty of sense. Dude was hearing voices. I mean come on it's pretty cut and dry. There isnt much to argue unless you know something about the lore that everyone else doesnt.
---
New DS is stronger than old DS??...you‚Äôre a moron
---
Ya I'm on my gfs ps4 pro right now working for rift fragments, send me your username in a message or just post it here if you want. I'm in a game as killer at the moment so give me a couple minutes.

If he was hearing voices, its likely he had some pre-existing mental condition so I don't think he was loving, if he was loving im sure it would be shock and not rage.
---
FOUR weeks though... It's tough, I swear I'm going through withdrawals
---
Very nice.
---
Yes, they said this was the case way before it started
---
Why dont we make it so he can only walk backwards while we are at it?
---
gg piece of shit
---
Gens would just be doubled to accommodate and maps would be larger. Really the only thing they have to do 
---
(Identity V does this already and it works really well. They also separate playing for rank or for playing casually)
---
Definitely a great idea, I like it. What you say about the game not being scary to experienced survivors is so true. There was a clip on here a few days ago of a couple of survivors running around a killer practically chasing him because he wasn't very good and they thought it was hilarious. It just seemed so ridiculous.
---
Balanced.
---
Putting Feng into a David sandwich. üëå
---
Survivors don't really have any OP add ons anymore that I can think of since med kits got reworked and BNP have been nerfed but I think keys are quite a broken concept but for killers I'd say tombstone piece feels quite unfair to play against bit is probably balanced,iridescent heads,prayer beads,instasaw and while they aren't OP I hate clowns exhaustion add ons
---
Barf
---
I want to see a noob3 vs orz match up
---
Here's the catch, neither one works on Michael.
---
Yes, in PS4 the higher and closer to purple the rank, I have found a greater DC rate.
---
My biggest concern with cross play would be the control differences.  To highlight a pc killers advantage with the hag, they can bind teleport to the scroll wheel to instantly teleport once a trap is sprung.
---
Please tell me what counterplay a good spirit has
---
Idk. It's a pretty decent correlation with their customs and schizophrenia. Who knows. There are cases like this though where people just snap and kill their families and kids when the day before they were perfectly normal and caring. It's why mental health is such an important thing to stay up to date on. I cant assume he was a great dad because the lore doesnt state that. We cant assume he was horrible either. So if we do ever learn more about spirits dad hopefully it will shine some light on the matter.
---
Can't say no to that logic
---
Yeah, I always thought it seemed silly when Survivors start chasing a killer. Maybe There would have to a be a Tier 6 that would take an ungodly amount of time super close to the killer to obtain that is actually debilitating. 
---
Would maybe prevent something like that from happening. IDK.
---
Billy
---
Spirit 
---
Nurse
---
Huntress
---
Hag with good addons 
---
What are you talking about
---
Billy and huntress are the best examples of a balanced killer imo and they‚Äôre what I would like other killer to be like. They‚Äôre fun to play as, and against. There is counterplay to their abilities, and none of their powers make the survivors feel useless or like they didn‚Äôt have much option in the what they could have done in the same way nurse, spirit and Freddy‚Äôs snares do, but they‚Äôre still incredibly strong in the right hands. Both side‚Äôs game-sense and how well they play affect how the chase ends. huntress can‚Äôt just spam her hatchets like Freddy can spam snares, but she also can‚Äôt be looped in the same way another m1 killer can be.
---
My two favourite moris are ghost face and demigorgon
---
Cleanse totems.
---
That‚Äôs the counter. It‚Äôs right there, already built in to the game.
---
Why do you think it needs another counter when it has a counter built in.
---
&gt; But Desdomen... I don‚Äôt wanna cleanse totems! Waaahgh!
---
Yeah, see... that‚Äôs your choice. You can either cleanse totems or die to NOED. No one‚Äôs stopping you from making the choice.
---
Adapt.
---
I feel that people who act like that must be very unsatisfied with their lives. I feel kind of bad for them.
---
Finally, a balanced killer. Watch the killer mains whine about her being too weak. Lol
---
I do feel keys need a change as yesterday I had a full 4 man escape through hatch after they 3 gen'd themselves. Most of those add ons could be reworked or nerfed pretty easily and I feel you on that clown one
---
No he's not.
---
It's Pig mains who propagate the meme, to lure folks further into stabbing range.
---
A+ it is then! Also bonus points for not fucking around during math class haha
---
So camping when gates are powered/open makes you an asshole? Even though you have no other objective and abandoning the hook will almost certainly cayse everyone to get out?
---
?sneg, uoy gnioD
---
Tht is unless they take her katana and focus more on her phase walking
---
Sure thing m8 :D
---
Oh, shit. Pig is _bad._ Pig is _real bad._
---
Practice with one solid killer like Freddy or Ghostface without changing your build much unless you feel certain perks are lacking. Just use them til you get a good rate of success and play survivor intermittently, using the tactics you see working as you switch roles. Things like moris and keys you can't do anything about them really so just collect your bloodpoints in those matches and let it slide.  Remember it's a game and try to have fun like everyone else. And once you get good with a build, experiment with others to keep improving.
---
I think everyone who's played killer has at least done the occasional "fuck you" camp to an obnoxious survivor or done the "I had a rough game and at least want one god damn kill" camp once or twice
---
Tbh, I quite like that the horror elements fall away over time
---
Once you get past the tension, it becomes a neat stealth-strategy experience that I really dig
---
Yeah because devs totally are the experts of difficulty in this game. GF, Freddy and Myers are rated as "Hard", Wraith and Clown are "Intermediate" and a freaking Doctor is labeled "hard".
---
My life is fine? This isn't even toxic lmao
---
Spirit is very strong, but she doesn't need to be gutted like the nurse was. She just needs to make a noise when you channel her power in line of sight of the survivor being chased. The only reason she's so strong is because it's a gamble what side of the pallet she's going to be on. You SHOULD be able to take out survivors with it since her Ms is 110, but it should be based on prediction and skill. Not just some random chance. 
---
As a spirit main, my idea would be this. As long as you can see her husk there should be a noise of her phasing. It shouldn't be directional though. That way the survivor knows when she can and can't see them. Currently she makes no indication she's using her power or not.
---
&gt; Missing 8 blinks in a row isn‚Äôt unfeasible anymore.
---
You *can't* miss 8 blinks in a row if you're good at Nurse. Come on... You should be missing less blinks if anything since you need to make every blink count (so you use your CD period to direct the survivor to X location or wait for a better "angle").
---
Which maps do you consider bad for her? Only bad maps she has currently are Lery's and Hawkins (and corn maps if you're corn blind AND Hawkins only because it has unblinkable tiles).
---
Noob3 is trash
---
How do you think she should be re-worked?
---
Same thing happened. Billy's BBQ hammer, Kate's Summer Shirt, Huntress' Wolf Mask and David's Jacket (Reskinned Donkey Jacket) went missing randomly and aren't back still
---
Yeah plague is like bronze age right? Still, samurai are cooler than sick religious ladys
---
pig is p cute though
---
It's not a recent thing. She's been complained about since her release to live servers.
---
Hell, she's been complained about more than Nurse before her changes. She's not fun to play against.
---
Your view of this makes no sense. The term had been coined as a skill floor because it was used to define the beginning level someone started at. Then, as gaming grew and outsiders started pouring in they adapted the term, changed it to fir their view but didn't change its name without caring that it no longer makes sense.
---
If we use your definition then both skill floor and skill ceiling talk about how hard it is to be effective. It's redundant.
---
Love the idea btw :)
---
How small is doc's terror radius with double addons and monitor?
---
I thought the Archive ending entry/cinematic all but confirmed the Alchemist.
---
I never said Spirit wasn't overly-viable.
---
It's nowhere near being a new thing. Go back months in the past and you can see him and many other people saying that Spirit is awful to play against but really fun to play as.
---
Things can be fun to play as but not fun to play against? It's not a hard concept to grasp. He's gone on record many times that he often avoids playing Spirit because he knows she's awful to play vs.
---
people are delusional if they think this survey was pushed out in an attempt to garner feedback and improve the game.
---
you wont convince me otherwise when 1/3 of the entire survey asks me what purchases I have made, why I made them, and what purchases im likely to make.
---
I'd be hard pressed to not bring Nurse's Calling to capitalize on a slow healing build
---
ok so, the match that i first tried this on was badham I, are you seriously going to shit there and tell me that the only thing i need when im inside the fucking school or any of the houses to instantly find out if the killer is coming towards me is my "ears and game sense"? that is appalling, you're acting like i play with these perks every fucking game, i dont, i run tenacity, dead hard, decisive strike and bond every game, im a rank 3 survivor, i dont know what you are but if you say that you have such good Gamer Gear (TM) and game sense that you can know where the killer is no matter what, you should be rank 1 and double pipping every game. are you rank 1 and double pipping every game? are you escaping every game? if you answered no to any of those, you're being a hyperbolic shitter who needs to like go outside or something
---
well i heard it when i was watching a video criticizing dbd its not a very smart complaint since the hooks killing the survivors is the entity taking their dead bodies
---
an actual way to know if she is phasing, Make hearing omni directional, remove collision, completely change prayer beads since rarity does nothing. 
---
These changes just make her a worse killer, but i dont think it really fixes her issues. its just to make things seem a little more fair
---
With how good he and all the clocks strewn about like the pigs jigsaw boxes i don‚Äôt think that matters, and it‚Äôs honestly a pretty long timer if you actually wake up the proper way. Which you should almost always be doing especially if you‚Äôve been snapped awake a few times. As for the vision thing I can always see pretty well and I‚Äôm blind as heck I think it might be your tv settings.
---
Yeah. I bet every player has 800 hours in the game to adjust for perfect skillchecks. I have an idea - I played the game when it was released and it was doable for the killer to play without it. Even when survivors had insta-repair details and op skills. Killers doesn't have to kill all the survivors 90% of the time in my opinion. And if every killer has rely on some skill cuz he can't succeed without it then there is clearly a problem with balance that need to be addressed.
---
Really? I've played on PC and PS4 and found they felt very similar.
---
Did the developers say that?
---
Killer disguised as Survivor, confirmed? 
---
At the end, it asked how likely you'd recommend to a friend with an open-ended comment section. That was your opportunity.
---
right now, no. its only cross play through steam and windows store. BUT.... i DO believe they are looking into mass cross play considering the survey they just sent out earlier asking how we would feel about pc/console cross play
---
im pretty sure you did not watch the clip lmao
---
To be honest it doesn't do that much in terms of matchmaking. Just today we (Rank 5-7 Survivors) have faced a Rank 17 Plague on Disturbed Ward. Actually felt sorry for her, even when she facecamped. Considering the disadvantages she had in general (Ruin being cleansed in the first 20 seconds, the map, Ranks, Perks) I actually defended her in the post game chat.
---
The thing about Thanatophobia is that it's mostly a placebo. And a very bad one at that. If you don't play Legion or Plague, it's tough to keep all 4 Survivors injured. And even if you actually do, the 16% it debuffs 12,8 seconds in terms of gens are not impactful enough. In terms of heals the 16% equal 2,56...Seconds? And none sabotages anyway so that factor is irrelevant. The only reason why Thanato is actually not THAT bad, is thanks to Dying Light also existing. Stacked with Dying Light you can get a slow down of up to 40 % before you actually sacrifice Survivors with your hooks. But that's about it. Both ain't good as a standalone but need each other to be useful. Else you can just go for Ruin and Pop, having much better value that doesnt need to ramp as much.
---
The Emblem System has overall the huge flaw that is punishes Killers that rely on one shotting Survivors. But that's a known fact, it'll probably be fixed within the next bunch of months.
---
And yes, even when the Apple is uncommon, you do realize the massive flaw of a Killers abillity being tied to a particular Add-On do you? Plus, having just one CP won't make enough of a difference if you don't go for the early game Plague. And even then, the Survivors can actually be smart enough to not group against a Plague with CP active and spread properly. This is the issue that Plague has. One apple ain't enough, while 2 are too much of a commitment. And smart Survivors just won't cleanse. If you're actually capable of getting high value out of that 1 or 2 CP's, it's mostly because the Survivors misplayed and didn't respect it.
---
The thing you don't see about Legion is that you don't have to use your Frenzy anymore once the Survivors are all injured. You literally use the Frenzy ONLY to keep every Survivor injured. Else you're a typical M1 Killer, just like Plague. The fact that it can be locker-juked or stunned out doesn't make that much of a difference if the Survivor doesn't commit to it. Simply because the first Survivor you approach won't have a chance to do so, while the others know that you're coming but committing to it would mean that they'd have to stop doing whatever they're currently doing while there's not much time to react. Else the Frenzy might maaaybe be used for mobillity, if there's a gen that must not be finished or a hex that must be protected. In terms of a chase the 4 seconds of fatigue are obviously a big oof, but this is why Legion players only deactivate it during a chase when the Survivor is cornered in a way that they can't make that much out of these 4 seconds. For example the Shack at Thompson House. It's always in the same position so it's a good example. When the Survivor is cornered in a way that they MUST run around you to get distance, Legion has the easiest down ever. The good thing is that many Survivors don't realize that. So the fatigue is not necessarily that much of a hinderance, it just depends on the positioning. In addition there are also add-ons that reduce the fatigue duration. Sadly the Add-Ons ain't worth it as you merely cut one second when using both, Joey's Mixtape AND Cold Dirt. 25% might seem much but to be honest 1 second out of 4...For BOTH Add-On slots...It's just not worth it. Legion benefits A LOT from Killer experience. Recognizing and punishing movement patterns, adapting to Survivor behavior, hiding the red stain during mind games, etc. All these things can make Legion quite lethal. But the same goes for Plague in that regard.
---
If I remember certainly Survivors can't do that anymore. I've played Ghostface several times and walking behind a wall while I was about to get exposed saved me several times oO
---
So I'm quite surprised if this actually still works. And yes, ofcourse Michaels 99'. However you seem to overvalue Infectious Fright. Just because you know where Survivors are, this doesn't mean that you get them. Yes, you have a one shot. But if we anticipate that you slug the first one and obviously run for whoever was closest and within range of the perk, the Survivor has enough of a head start to get to a spot at which he can easily loop you until EW 3 is over.  Aslong as you don't go for add-ons that increase the EW 3 duration and are lucky enough for Survivors to move around a dead zone, you don't snowball as easy as Michael as you make it look like. Survivors will have to be...Not that experienced, when they actually allow you to make that happen.
---
Ghost Face should NOT be revealed whilst not being in direct LoS, and the mere fact that they're marked the same speed regardless of distance allows you to stalk Survivors from out of 40m of distance and gain enough progress to the very same Michael does. Approach, tap and one-shot. This comes especially handy when you successfully defended the gens located at the center of the map, since this allows you to stalk and approach Survivors from much more directions than cornered gens do.
---
Another HUGE difference between GF and Michael, is that Michael's amount of stalking is limited, while the stalking of Ghost Face is not. So you will never reach the point at which your power becomes literally useless against particular Survivors.
---
Another point would be that every Survivor has its very own stalking progress, giving GF the chance to ramp every Survivor up to 99 before he one shots one after another, something Michael is not capable of.
---
When the loop is actually open you'll fake the dash to force the Survivor out of position, switch stances and go for the free M1 you'll almost always have if there aren't 2 safe pallets quite close to each other. Then you'll obviously have to force down one of them first.
---
And the fact that Survivors use 3rd person camera is why Killers developed a technique that allows them to conceal their red stain during chases. Which takes away essential time for the Survivor to react by dropping the pallet or even reach the pallet before the down occurs. Ofcourse, when Killers don't even attempt to hide their red stain, almost all of them have a huge handicap.
---
Yeah but simply because there ain't many, it doesn't mean that the Killer is bad. This actually means that A, the skill ceiling of the Killer is pretty damn high, or B, that there are not enough people playing the Killer in the first place. There ain't that many good Nurses left either, however she's still the very best in the entire game when put into skilled hands.
---
And yeah, the crouch changes were a thing because the Combat Straps were too much of a essential Add-On, I can remember that.
---
It's just that Pig's ambush is VERY situational. You need exact awareness of the tile you're currently at and decide which type of action benefits you the most. And if you make the wrong choice, you're heavily punished. This is the issue Pig has, she requieres massive knowledge of particular tiles while the punishment if she made the wrong choice (pun intended) is pretty damn high.
---
But as already mentioned, that doesn't make her a bad Killer.
---
Until pips do anything, no one is going to pay attention to them.
---
Oof, look at this toxic Survivor main.
---
Wait that was you? LOL brotha I was the guy who replied and then deleted my twitter account later.
---
Not at all, base Spirit isn't anywhere more fair to go against.
---
Nurse, freddy, billy, huntress, demo. 
---
Spirit isnt getting gutted. People are overeating just like they did with the nurse changes.
---
I'm pretty sure the is a visual que. The glass lights up when she begins phasing if I remember correctly
---
I always try to juke like that but I can never get it to work
---
Sexy time has begun
---
Whether you understand my view, the majority of people who use these terms use the definition that I have laid out, I'm sorry to say that your definition has mostly become irrelevant
---
Also starting effectiveness and effectiveness when you are well experienced are not the same thing
---
&gt; because I rarely escape them
---
Because you never get chased so you don't learn how to loop?
---
&gt; That, and being able to know where the killer is, even if you can't see them
---
Being aware of your surroundings and using your ears should do the trick, no need to waste a perk slot.
---
12 meters in Punishment, it is not a rocket science
---
Having the same character as both a killer and survivor would be a super unique and cool take actually
---
I love how this entire thing spawned from the nurse changes. Calm down, she is still the most OP thing in the game. you are hurting yourselves.
---
I just tried Freddy out for the first time since his rework the other night and I don't understand how people are complaining about Spirit over him. He has to be tied with Demogorgon right now for most overloaded base kit and his add-ons just make him even more crazy.
---
I SWEAR if yall mfs didn't put very weak for all the demogorgon teachables... I mean there's SO MUCH POTENTIAL FOR THEM
---
People complained about Spirit way more even back before Nurse got changed. 
---
Spirit doesn't have any feedback for the survivor to go off of. Nurse at least shows when she's charging the blink, shows you the direction she's going to, you have things to work with. With spirit you get none of that, it's a guessing game. That's why she's disliked the most.
---
&gt; I committed to the OGs...
---
You gonna do my boy Jake dirty like that when Nea wasn't even in the game at launch smh
---
the possibility is here, because there are two parties that don't interact with eachother much. They both told us they are fine with it, but don't know about the other. you're 100% fine.
---
Look, changing your settings files to uncap FPS seems like a thing you're more likely to get banned for and what? 
---
latest hotfix: Fixed an issue that caused the mist to move faster when the user had uncapped FPS.
---
Not all OP powers, like T1 or T3 Myers, have counters. The only difference between Spirit and Myers is you‚Äôll get some notification (phasing sound, or glowing in mind games) with Spirit
---
During a chase try to make immediate, sharp turns, as many as possible. Get used to moving the camera between where you're going and behind you to check if the killer has you in sight. If you can't see them, make more sharp turns and/or duck out of sight. I use Urban Evasion on all my main characters to skulk around most of the time, works well immediately after you're out of sight as well. Sprint Burst is incredible for getting away quickly as well. 150% running speed for 3 seconds, teachable Meg Thomas perk
---
You will get downed quite often by good killers, it's all part of the game. Just try not to run in straight lines, break the line of sight, make loads of sharp turns and be ready to crouch-hide at a moment's notice
---
Please tell then how you feel with DCs.
---
And yet every time you bring it up someone says "trU3 pRoOved tHAt wROng"
---
The only issue I see here is stealth killers not getting a full advatage of this feature. Ghost face would really only instill terror when he stalks and is in chase. Visually seeing him could also work... but honestly this system could work as the power of a single killer and throw it on all of them will really bring up the fear, doctor with distressing especially.
---
Thanks for the condescending answer. Considerably and Moderately don't exactly tell me how much it is reduced.
---
Tier 1 discordance is the best tier
---
&gt; Instadown on an ability that ignores pallets/windows is not healthy in its current state.
---
it doesnt ignore walls or trees, which there are an enormous number of. it's pretty easy to avoid them even at windows, you simply have to approach the window at a different angle than you would against the other killers. drop the pallet early and duck behind the high side of it, most of the time she cant angle herself to throw over if you do that, forcing her to stand there aiming and waiting for you to move while the others do gens, OR put the hatchet away and break the pallet, at which point you should start running to the next loop, which is easier due to her slow speed. 
---
hillbilly already has the ability to instadown at point blank range with only one hit, and without add ons and with high speed. no one seriously argues this is OP. (though several will switch to bitching about him if Spirit gets nerfed.) further, Huntress still has a cooldown on hatchets, so youre just wrong.
---
This build is pretty decent, maybe Spine Chill over Fixated. If you want to fully maximize Head On tho, if the Killer is chasing after you after just being unhooked recently, jump into a locker if you can. If the killer pulls you out, you DS them, if they wait out DS and stand in front of the locker, Head On stuns them. If they choose to stand away from the locker and wait out DS to counter both, then you‚Äôre just wasting their time that could be used to apply pressure on gens or chasing someone else.
---
I report people for holding the game hostage and then leave the game, as to no longer be held hostage.
---
*If you can't understand that, you are more stupid than I thought.*
---
Nice try at a strawman though. Maybe someone will fall for it.
---
I think these are decent changes, but please never list a rarity change as a nerf/fix, it does nothing. In fact people might start getting more if the bloodweb works properly
---
What happened to Noob3? I‚Äôm out of the loop
---
It is only a 1v1 if your team has already lost the game. If you think you should be able to 1v1 every killer then you don't understand the game. You are supposed to get hooked as a survivor. There are 3 other survivors doing gens while you are in a chase. As a rank 1 survivor you can pip without escaping, as a rank 1 killer you can't pip without getting at least 3 kills. Yes you hate spirit because she is unfun to play against aka you can't bully her like wraith.
---
Her not seeing you doesn't matter when she has headphones and functioning ears + grass movement. 
---
She's unfair because she doesn't give you any information feedback as survivor, everything you do against her is a guess.
---
&gt;consider using Spine Chill.
---
Consider this amazing strat against spine chill: I look away from you as I phase and move towards you. Now your spine chill is worthless and I get a hit for free.
---
It's mostly because new/low level killers don't play ultra optimally so they can be scary and unpredictable.
---
Once you get higher levels and killers play optimally, it's pretty much the least scary way to play possible except for certain killers. Just chasing people across several dozen pallets is not scary.
---
This meme format is beautiful.
---
Mains are peasants. I go both ways like my sexuality
---
And if the leaks are true about files with the sane and crazy modes...perhaps a lack of the flowers is what drives him up the wall.
---
Where is this "sword teaser"?!
---
I'm totally down for this because if they do take memorable items from the maps of killers (spoiler alert) if you havent seen IT chapter 2 the losers club gets memorable items of theirs to try to defeat pennywise. So maybe its their way of teasing that. If we see more items of importance disappear then pennywise would be my guess
---
I‚Äôm not talking about ‚Äújust doing the objective‚Äù, I‚Äôm talking about SWF groups who coordinate it so that one member has eyes on the killer at all times, organizing a rush where three gens will pop at once.  It sucks being a killer and having all the gens get finished before you even see any survivors.  I‚Äôm not mad survivors who do this, because it‚Äôs part of playing the game.  I‚Äôm also not mad at killers who chase down and take out already wounded survivors.  Because that‚Äôs their objective.
---
This sounds fantastic.
---
Probably the Huntress. Those hatchets must be heavy, yet she throws 'em like a pro. 
---
Also, she's hot.
---
I'd say keys and dead hard do have problems, I have no idea how you'd go around fixing them without making them worthless tho.
---
looks more like winnie the dictator
---
If you're running duration addons, then sure maybe.
---
But honestly with a bit of Spirit experience, unless it's a really unsafe pallet anyways, you don't really have a lot of time to stay put and interpret which side they're on if they dropped the pallet. Which is why typically you just pick a side.
---
Oh. Yeah, I meant somewhat not scary enough then.
---
what you mean why would I do that he grabbed me thru a vault
---
I'm a survivor main. My "Killer sided opinion" is more "People shouldn't dictate how others play the game."
---
But you keep thinking what you want to think to convince yourself that you're actually a good person. You're nothing more than an entitled, crybaby who only wants what's beneficial for you without regard for anyone else.
---
I did this yesterday to a twitch streamer on accident. They love the wraith...
---
Yeah I know. If I match inner strength with that, essentially I get a stun in any way. I want to get Quick and Quiet but no bp for it ;( not in shrine
---
and wraiths needs a rework as well since its basically the same as trappers but i dont know what idea to do for his specifically.
---
The walk of shame
---
I think his forver freddy build might get looked on.
---
I'm pretty sure you get the offerings back, unless they changed it recently. I think this because I used a black ward once, and I didn't lose it when a survivor dodged in the loading screen.
---
As annoying as getting face camped is doing this to bt would ruin the game. Sometimes you just take the loss and move on also if you have 19 points you didnt even struggle and instantly went down.
---
it's only for SWF and KYF tho- and it's optional.
---
No sir, everything killers have is fine, the survivors have to pay for their crimes of picking survivors in the main menu.
---
Ghostface could definitely give a big Terror boost from being revealed and exposing a Survivor. And of course, Killers like Wraith and Pig would give off less Terror while hunting but still a fair bit when they start a chase (as closer to killer=more terror and if they can get right up to a Survivor before exposing their TR, that means a big boost at once.
---
Spirit robs players of proper feedback to actively engage in mind games with her.
---
While that is a interesting concept, having killer and survivor from the same character.
---
(Like people are talking about rin (the spirit) as survivor and her father as killer right now because of the leak)
---
It is also kinda confusing about the entity and while I am interested to see it, I would rather have more original or lore character in the game then every character be turn into killer/survivor.
---
I think Small Game should be able to count broken totems you have been within a certain radius, kind of like map tracking but much closer. That way on your mission you'll eventually know whether all 5 are gone or not, but in a way that still slows the game down for the killer.
---
When it was released nobody really knew how to play the game.If people had today's knowledge everyone would escape every time.I play 50/50,maybe killer slightly more than survivor so make it about 350 hours as survivor.I've had games where 2-3 generators got completed in the first 2 minutes,while having ruin that is.
---
I agree
---
I have never received my offerings back, maybe that‚Äôs just a bug for me. Annoying however...
---
Honestly it should just be Windows x Steam and PS x Xbox
---
As a Hag main, its soo good to destroy survivors and in the end game chat when they talk shit I just hit em with "Well you shouldn't have walked into my trap." They can't blame me getting a 4K on their own incompetence because then they're just admitting they're bad.
---
....or just do the totems. They raised the BP. The devs says it's fine  I clean 2 or 3 a game  If people would spend the same amount of time reminding everyone to cleans totems when you see one instead of bitching about it. We would not be doing a NOED Iz Op PleZ nErF. Every other post. The gens are done to fast they want you off them. You have to consider if you don't do totems then they might have NOED. I know. What you are going to say.... But idk if other team mates are  doing them .know why they are not doing them?  Because we are teaching people to not do them by bitching. It's not hard. Do you see a totem! Is it safe to cleans? Can you spare 16sec? Then cleans the fucking thing and talk about how to convince others to. It's lazy people that  don't. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Sorry but the NOEDs post get to me. I play stealth during last gen so I rarely get caught by it. I do totems and don't see NOED that much. Prob because me and 1 other team mate  just do them. You are  welcome teams I stop NOED.  Wish we would spam that it's always a objective to cleans them in stead of telling killers what they can or can't do.
---
yeah, I don't think that's a common complaint
---
I really don‚Äôt know how protection hits work, I got hit while being chased by the killer while someone was unhooked and being healed like halfway across the map, and I get the ‚ÄúProtection‚Äù score event as if I took a hit for the guy who was nowhere near the killer
---
Freddy bad. Gimme uphooks to the left.
---
crossplay would be awesome but should optional like the steam to windows version. also i would love to play with keyboard on console, as I can't afford a pc but like playing with mouse and keyboard
---
How is that possible that the matchmaking is in such a terrible state with so many players?
---
Agreed. I was worried with their new survey that they would really make it complete cross platform
---
&gt; when im inside the fucking school or any of the houses
---
Houses are not an issue to me personally, idk where you'd need those 2 perks or one of em in the houses but the preschool does have the shitty gen spawn on top of the basement stairs.
---
&gt; that you can know where the killer is no matter what 
---
I totally said this.
---
&gt; you should be rank 1 and double pipping every game
---
Ok.
---
200 points for reunited
---
700+ points for struggle
---
Something doesn‚Äôt add up.
---
The rarity change is just part of it, not the whole thing. Rarity by itself doesn't have much of an impact
---
Thanksüñ§üåö
---
1. Remove and/or rework prayer beads to be more fair. I.E. giving it a map wide terror radius or having it cause a slow down when she gets out of the terror radius her husk is making.
---
2. Have her actually be a spirit when phasing, no accidently running into a survivor.
---
3. Her glass shards grow and glow when phasing
---
&gt;!4. Her Katana is replaced with a butter knife with the same range as her original weapon!&lt;
---
üñ§Thank you
---
the only thing that bothers me is why would you waste some of your hard earned cash onsomething that doesnt look anywhere near as good as what you already have?
---
Would you want to see a real version of sonic with bald arms?
---
haven't seen a billy in red ranks for about 3 months now. Nothing but spirit in red ranks in my region. Purple is 90% spirit and 10% demogorgon with mori
---
See some games have optimization for mouse and keyboard. If they do it they need to make the sensitivity extremely customizable and same thing with key bindings.
---
Ummmm.   I'm pretty sure I already have trappers power.  Like I can go buy bear traps and leave them laying around to have people not step on them
---
If you were to buff her in a way that forces people to clense you also have to make the purge weaker. 
---
The reason people don't clense is because she's REALLY strong if they do. So now you are punishing people for trying to not give their opponent a really strong buff. That's not really a good design.
---
I completed it, but seriously, just put crossplay in and make it optional. You can't go wrong with making it optional. Those that don't want it won't have to deal with it and those that do will hopefully enjoy the benefits of it.
---
I love playing plague. Not frustrating using her power at all. Also, playing against plague isn't as annoying as a spirit. Spirit is just fucking bullshit.
---
Did you make it into the match?
---
It doesnt have to be a nerf if they compensate in another area.
---
I haven't really seen anyone rallying behind nerfing a killer besides Legion and Spirit. I don't think the survivors with half a brain want everyone to be clown tier. Killers can be strong, they just need to have counterplay like Nurse.
---
smack a hook as you carry them
---
It's most likely hacks as she seemed pretty sure on what to do
---
I mean, exploiting to get ontop of the shack or exit gate has been known to happen here there, mostly due to latency, but straight up clipping through hay stacks is where it's pretty obvious it was a hack being used otherwise some confusion would've been present in her behaviour.
---
Yeah if they Nerf Legion I'm quitting dead by daylight.
---
&gt;!The benefit of being at the bottom is that their is no where to go but up!&lt;
---
The only reason I'm against PC + Console Crossplay is the fps and how well the game runs between the two groups. Mouse + Keyboard wouldn't be as much a problem as it would be in a fps, if a console player doesn't want to play against a Mouse+Keyboard then they can easily just disable crossplay.
---
At the very least they should at least try all versions crossplaying but in a way they implement it so if the worst comes to pass they can easily separate the groups.
---
I remember Nurse coming out, I guess I just didn't venture away from Dwight originally and didn't realize she was added XD
---
The thing is it‚Äôll be too op if played normally especially in high rank , I understand face camping is bad but buffing bt like they will be too op .
---
Wait so if I'm doing survive with friends on console I'd have the chance of ending up with a PC player. It's weird it's optional since it's always considered a ranked game.
---
Ik
---
Nea who?
---
Never thought I‚Äôd see a corella comic as a meme üòÇ
---
Out of curiosity, what makes her well balanced? I don‚Äôt have any particular problem with her, but she does seem odd in that the counter strategy to her ability is to remain in a broken state. That seems strange to me, since healing up and being able to take two hits is the baseline of a normal game. Plus it seems like a more powerful version of exposed, so it beats out killers that use that. Plus, one guy healing up can  potentially down a whole team with her firehose. Maybe I‚Äôm not very aware of strategies around her, but the way the game plays around her doesn‚Äôt exactly feel balanced and certainly doesn‚Äôt feel like it represents the normal gameplay. (Not that you said that. I‚Äôm just thinking of if a group of people started playing the game together, who would represent a well balanced game for them.)
---
He plays on PC throught the Xbox Game Pass. That is Windows Store.
---
OP, yes you can play together.
---
I played around 9 games at red rank 2 days ago. 3 hillbillies total. Of course I‚Äôm not just generalizing from this one day, but just making a small point. Of course, we could be on different consoles and regions so results may vary.
---
That's probably the only chance for a skin we'd ever get, hat less Bill with tank top.
---
you didnt struggle, you didn‚Äôt do anything at all, those points are literally only possible if the killer bee lined you and instantly downed you, even boldness points give you something, in honestly shocked at how you got so few points
---
Yeah people thinks that playing the game is running straight for the save 2 seconds after they get hooked and without BT, I've seen a few "streamers" (for example) that does that and then complaint that they teams are trash
---
You don't need meta perks to loop. People loop killers with head on.
---
Billy being loop-able is perfectly fair counterplay, it's a counterplay to most killers.
---
You didn't even struggle on the hook.
---
I used to play real stealthy but try not too as much now. Im at a very weird rank where some games I‚Äôll get an absolute baby killer and then the next will be a P3 demogorgon. They gotta work on it, hard to find consistency
---
I didn't know they said it was optional I just saw it on the survey they posted.
---
Some of the people in this thread are the same who were screaming earlier for unironic nerfs to exhaustion perks. Like.......
---
This. Killers keep spouting "Entitled survivors just want Spirit gutted" but literally no one is saying that. The strawmen are everywhere on this sub.
---
And I will finally join in the crying. Freddy is BY FAR the dumbest killer in the game. Absolutely brainless (passive buffs and spammy ability without resource management) AND super strong. I know Iri heads and Beads and such is bullshit, but at least they still have to play the game to some degree. Freddy is basically a fucking bot except actually super powerful.
---
Use your eyes and ears.
---
Heh
---
Vigo isn't the alchemist, last year's event released lore which said the alchemist found notes signed by Vigo when he came into the entity's realm.
---
People like Scott Jund, OhTofu, Ussylis, Alex, HybridPanda. Pretty much every longtime high rank streamer from both sides of the game. Including some of the least toxic people in the community (OhTofu). But sure, it's all just Toxic Scott.
---
Feng is just trying to be the coolest 3rd grader.
---
Well, Billy also gets fucked on by the really good teams, just like any other killer that can't bypass loops to some extent, sooo...
---
well technically using bloodpoints to get the bloody clothes technically counts for buying it.
---
Toxic killers that tunnel and face camp are not in it for the blood points, so reducing them won't punish them only the ones that don't.
---
You should have got more points for struggling.
---
Using your own logic, why does it matter if spirit is nerfed? As long as she gets a few kills a game and not consistent 4ks, that should be fine. 4k can be a fun bonus, not a requirement for the match to be fun....
---
I think they will make it so you can't use two of the same add on on him and lower the values on those add ons. So you can't have two charge speed/cooldown add ons.
---
Also some add ons will have new effects, look at nurse for example. Old boring "your blink charge speed is x% faster" became "get a free nurse's calling for x seconds after a successful hit".
---
Survivors don't want a hard nerf to Spirit. I know for a fact I would be fine if they added counterplay (like giving her a fucking vault animation) and then buffing her slightly in exchange.
---
You are a dumbass :)
---
People have been complaining about Nurse for Y E A R S. It took literal years to get her ass changed. Why do you people act like the complaints and changes came and went in only a month?
---
Oy when are you releasing RIFT PASS - LEVEL 2?
---
I call bs I made a post about people being hypersensitive and I got disliked galore üòè
---
Name checks out
---
Right now crossplay is only between PC Steam and PC Windows Store and there is an option on at least the steam version to opt out of the crossplay.
---
I'm not sure how extensive their crossplay options will be out side of Yes Crossplay and no Crossplay.
---
I'm making a list of changes for every Killer / Perks because I don't have anything else to do and I'd like to have new ideas, might post the list I have here later
---
Being able to shred pallets is massive, what do you mean? You can absolutely devour pallets with it and it's faster than having to walk up to it (often get stunned) and go through the breaking animation.
---
&gt;they made several new maps totally unfair to survivors
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeah, really not a fan of Stranger things map on either side. Chases are so boring since almost every pallet can just be ran around for free.
---
The old Silent Hill games were true horror games, some of the best ones, in third person, but yes, they relied on the same thing. Instead of perspective, they'd make the player fear the unknown with different techniques, that's the key.
---
I just want rankings to be fixed.
---
Use Spine Chill and walk ffs. if there's grass nearby, look at it to see if she's phasing through it. just like she can do with you. when she phases, the two of you cant see each other, so youre almost on an equal footing, except that she cant vault. so you still have the slight advantage. 
---
I noticed you add in the qualifier "good" spirit. have you considered the possibility some of them are just better than you? we all get outplayed sometimes. it happens. 
---
Now, I'd like to know what counterplay the OP loops in this game have. you know the ones; the piles of random junk that we can both see over, but the killer cant reach over despite being a 7-foot man with a 3 foot super machete. which means the killer cant mindgame you at all so he has no choice but to throw the game by chasing you for long enough for 3 gens to get done since they take only 80 seconds and it's likely multiple survivors started only 20 feet from one. OR he can leave to look for someone else while you tell your friends exactly where to go to loop him on this map using the comms that arent programmed in but you probably use anyway. 
---
Know what a good counter to those loops is? Spirit. her power weakens these loops by putting both sides on a roughly equal footing, for the reasons outlined above. just because this result in an OP survivor weapon being nerfed does not make it unfair. actually, fair would be removing such loops entirely or at least weakening them to the point they can only last a few seconds before you get hit and use your speed boost reward to go to a loop that low-mid tier killers have a chance at mindgaming. that way the rest of us could have a reasonable chance at having fun as Pig/Demogorgon/Wraith/Trapper/Clown/Leatherface/Doc etc. when Ruin goes down in 30 seconds again.
---
That BT re-buff is stupid. So survivors can just run in as their being chased to do a save with no downside? lol
---
What make and model? For science...
---
I try to tunnel the unhooker instead when this happens instead of repeatedly going for the person who got farmed by their dumbass teammate
---
Are we sure Aim assist is what we want with Huntress? I see that inspiring a lot of rage on console side, let alone if they went into a PC crossplay match.
---
First thing to understand with Doc addon wise is that he pretty much needs the brown electrode to have a functional power, sad as that is. The default shock range is so pathetic that it will often miss if people just run in a straight line away from you, even if you're hugging their ass. With a range-boosting electrode it becomes useable.
---
This leaves you one other addon slot. Of the others I think the strongest is the "Restraint" class of addons. This addon is notable for causing you to be able to see the fake Doctors through walls at Madness **2** instead of just at Madness 3. As people can never leave Madness 2, this means you basically know roughly where that person is for the rest of the game. Optimal Doc gameplay is probably getting the first two people you hook to Madness 2 and then tunneling these two people in rotation, as you'll be able to find them again easily. A bit dirty, but Doc hasn't got much else going for him so he has to try hard to make up for it if you want to beat good Survivors. This addon also gives you wallhacks on people when they tier up in madness which can be super helpful sometimes, especially if they have Calm Spirit as they still show up. This addon in general just destroys all possibility of stealth, even more so than Doc's base power does.
---
After Restraint, it's probably between fake pallets and maybe fake red light. Both can trick a Survivor into getting hit occasionally, but aren't particularly powerful.
---
Iridesent King is obviously noteworthy, but if I remember correctly Iri King does NOT give you the ability to see the phantom Doctor through walls/across the map at Madness 2. Only Restraint does that, so Iri King lacks the best effect (imo) of all the addons. That and the fact you have to shock them like 6 times to get all the Iri King debuffs on them...I just find it too time-consuming to bother with. The debuffs are annoying for the Survivor but that's pretty much it, just annoying. Arguably not worth the time spent on your part.
---
I think the most powerful things about Doc are finding people with the initial Madness 1 scream in critical situations (when you have people exposed, or when almost everyone is slugged/hooked and you know the last Survivor is around somewhere), and the Restraint-class Madness 2 wallhack, so those are what I abuse on him, in conjunction with well-timed shocks with the brown electrode. You can stop some usually strong window loops with the brown electrode if you put effort into learning the timing.
---
Interview Tape is also noteworthy as a replacement for electrode but very high skill cap to use well on loops. It has much more range on denying vaults and charges faster, but is much harder to aim. Interview Tape with green electrode (the classic "Railgun" build) is also pretty degenerate for 3 Gen patrolling if that's your thing.
---
Regarding bad addons, it's definitely the Scrapped Tape, unless someone finds some way to abuse it in the future. The Green range electrodes are also kind of a trap in that they make your shock so slow you can't really do anything with it to stop loops; it's only good when used with Iri King (or the aforementioned Railgun combo) to just easily get all the debuffs on someone, but this is a weak playstyle imo. Go short range, fast electrode and take whatever other addon you like best.
---
So when you can actually use her power to its full effect, it's more strong than it was before when you couldn't do that? And people notice that it's not fair to play against?
---
I'm shocked.
---
Original...
---
I dont know why a failed salaryman has 3 ancient japanese swords at home and a big home too
---
Wanna do a kyf with me and show me your reliable counterplay to spirit that isn't just making random guesses and hoping you get lucky? I'm dying to know.
---
BBQ,ruin,enduring,spirit fury
---
I love it on my meg! Makes everything so much easier and kinda thrilling because when it sets off you don‚Äôt know exactly where they are but you know they are nearby.
---
I held of for months for this very reason. But I finally broke down and switched to PC. I would still be in favor of cross progression, I won't get all of my shit back for a loooooong time.
---
Optimization, yes. Aim assist, no. It was removed for a reason.
---
Pretty much. I don't think it's fair to call everyone losers on account of having camped. It's too much of a blanket statement
---
If they did they should make it an option to switch it up with what you wanted to be in. I‚Äôm 90% sure it‚Äôs more expensive though and cross with just the 2 groups would be less
---
It's just a regional thing I'm sure. Xbox where I am is just endless spirits as soon as you hit rank 10, it's brutal. haven't had a fun survivor match for about a month now. 45% of the spirits have a mori, 45% have prayer beads and 10% have both. And if it's not a spirit it's a demogorgon who first hook mori's.
---
I never said she wasn't strong, just that the community believes she's stronger than she is. In Spirit discussions you never hear her weaknesses brought up and even though her power is strong if she hits it, it's a long cooldown and she should almost never catch you without it.
---
And i would argue that her being in every game says more about the viability of other killers. I see Pigs, Ghostfaces, Wraiths, Demos, and the occasional Clown that dc's after getting bodied half the game. Other killers I literally only see when after match they say "thanks for the daily". 
---
This is a bit more opinion than fact but if they nerf Spirit too much we are going to have this exact same discussion in a month about Ghostface. And if that path continues we won't have any killer mains left after they all are down to Wraith's viability. It's already hard to get survivor games for a reason, that's only going to get worse if the devs keep alienating one side of their game.
---
The good old days when the Clown wasn't a thi.g and Claudette were more invisible then Wraith
---
Ghostface isn't invisible.
---
You don't play console to use keyboard and mouse keep them well away
---
This isn't about power level. People complained about Spirit way more even before Nurse's changes.
---
Nurse has feedback to the survivor, you can actually use what you see and try to juke her/react to what she's doing. Spirit is hated because she doesn't have any feedback for the other side, it's entirely a guessing game, which is just less fun to play against.
---
It's not an argument of what's stronger.
---
Nope, one of the Megs left
---
maybe if the survivor is within 10 meters of the hook and they have BT it tells the hooked person that they have the perk?
---
Repeating things over and over makes my head hurt
---
Oh... I didn't know about that
---
We were wrong it wasn't Nea as the entity it was Nancy
---
Your ideas are terrible. Adding rng elements like stumbling would kill the game for good survivors.
---
Oh, well I didn't get to unhook cause there was a 10% chance that I fell the fuck over.
---
Complete dogshit.
---
But it works so that doesn't make sense. But I guess it makes it unfair to other console players without it. There's plenty of games on console that are optimized.
---
We have no info about her changes yet, just that they are coming.
---
Theres always that chance. Theres a reason why YTers who mention it always cover their ass and say the chance you'll get banned
---
A bot checks the files not people so if the bot sees edited files in a "competitive" game it will use the ban hammer. 
---

All this debating over Prem vs Spine Chill but where is the love for Alert? :(
---
So Spirit players get punished because players are bad against her? That's not balance that's appeasement. Taking away collision is enough of a nerf to knock Spirit down close to out of viability, if they stack more nerfs on top of that it's going to straight up ruin the character.

Why Balanced Landing over Sprint Burst? You can SB whenever you want if you keep your Exhaustion meter right on the edge of being finished, and there really aren't that many big drops for BL. I use Urban Evasion and when caught I try to zip out of there like Roadrunner

What's so great about Iron Will also?

Thanks for the info! I dont imagine I could transfer my progress and add ons over to the xbox game pass version from my steam profile? Kind of bummed I'll have to start over with no perks and no expansions or anything.

Yeah,especially if its Rin

Dude I'm rank 4 and my queues take less than 2 minutes I dont know what ya mean, survivor times arent NEARLY as bad as killer times. I've waited 35+ minutes for killer matches before

I‚Äôm a console player and I really want crossplay.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong I hate fortnite crossplay and shooter game cross-play, you explained that perfectly. But I think in deadbydaylight the skill gap with controls won‚Äôt beat that of just having good knowledge of the game and the mind game aspect of it. So anything to speed up queue is gucci

You don't have to use your entire power gauge to go around the pallet, that's just wasteful. If you use it in short bursts then you get it back in 2/4 seconds with no add ons.
---
Unpopular opinion, I like the new syringe. It no longer kills the charges on my medkit, so I basically use it on a standard medkit as basically a bonus heal once the medkit is out of charges. It's not as strong as it was, true, but it's still pretty good value especially against Sloppy Butcher users that kill your medkit efficiency.

My money is on Ghostface believe it or not. I've faced some beastly ones who utilized the stealth perfectly. They didn't bother stalking. I think there might be something to it and if more people catch on, Ghostie will be next.

I think it has to do when the killer DCs. If it is in the loading screen you should get it back but if they have already entered the game then you lose the offering. That is at least how it has been for me

False with the recent Undetectable change both perks now work on him.
---
If I find the totem quickly, I hide in a nearby locker bc 99% of the time the killer comes to check on it and I pop it as soon as they leave lol
---
gentleman, that isn't the only problem with her. Not only is it hard playing her cause of her awesome body but it's difficult as hell when her ass cheeks be clapping all over the place and be giving my location away -_-' but overall 10/10 she's awesome, locker perk ftw!
---
I'm in the same boat. I've recently bought a Pc but have been laying off of the DLC. If it goes on sale for insanely cheap then I'll probably pick it up. But most other companies don't allow cross platform purchases so I don't think this would be any different.
---
I would change diversion to have up to 3 tokens so you could throw multiple rocks at once. Obvious down side would be an SWF being super annoying with it, but it would be a nice change as a solo survivor.
---
The only time the killer chats with the survivors is after the match. So, just leave immediately and join queue again like a normal person. Don't "go into your settings and restrict the chat to be only from friends." 
---
Its actually insane that you're offended by words, and some trash talk on the internet can "ruin your fun."
---
Weakness disgusts me.
---
I just think either giving up collision or adding more feedback will make her more fair as from what I've seen I have to try and not get a 4k every game
---
Myers. Currently, it takes way too many stabs to down folks.
---
&gt;hillbilly already has the ability to instadown at point blank range with only one hit, and without add ons and with high speed. no one seriously argues this is OP
---
He has to be up your your ass to do it? And he has long charge time so if you have a window or a pallet you are safe and sound? That's a ridiculous comparison, Billy is way worse than Huntress in a chase.
---
If playing around hatchet throws against a competent huntress players was as brainlessly easy as you're saying then huntress wouldn't ever be getting any hits vs competent players. Hatchets destroy most loops really reliably, and them being an instadown breaks their balance. You're playing vs some really bad huntresses if they legit can't hit you on loops.

I'm a survivor main and I never had a problem with the Nurse, she was easy to juke untill she had no more than 3 blinks, but Spirit is so disgusting, such a lazy character design and very unbalanced, even perkless rank 18 spirit can get a 4k, nurse required skill, spirit requires ears.
---
In addition to what others say, it takes a lot of zaps to get someone into madness 3 without the shock effectiveness adder (Discipline? Order?)
---
An effective build for doc is Sniper Doc which is interview tape and a distance extender. You take hex perks and Surveillance, then blast anyone who touches a totem, hooked survivor or gen you‚Äôve kicked.

Not true, but ok.

My favorite is when the gens are completed and the killer DCs bc his NOED didn‚Äôt proc after I did all the bones

It doesn't actually slow it down. Adding additional survivors overall increases the speed a gen is finished but it adds a small penalty to efficiency to prevent insta gens

Nurse is a bitch and a half to play and you won‚Äôt get good at DBD playing her, you‚Äôll only get good at playing nurse.

The Real part of me found an issue with Dedicated Servers and no matter how fast you mash space you die. This irritated me, so I made a macro that spams spacebar on a side of my mouse. As soon as this bug is fixed I will drop the macro, but as of right now I die on hook for no reason so I am going to use it.
---
You're missing the point. you ask why you should use Spine Chill "just" to counter Spirit. You should be asking, "why are almost all killers counterable by looping the exact same way?" because the loops are badly designed.
---
And to your point, you don't "need" Spine Chill against Spirit. it does help a lot, and it's great against all killers, but especially stealth killers, of which Spirit is one. I use it on every survivor and I have all of them. So it's not just for fighting Spirit. it's as universal as Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike, as well as any healing or exhaustion perk. in fact, it even buffs healing perks, since it makes you do that faster. 
---
just because you don't feel like using a good counter does not mean there is no counter. You know what I don't want to use on every killer? Ruin. and neither does anyone else. it's totally broken because it's rng based on multiple levels. but since survivors' objective is so easy and fast while the maps are filled with loops that are OP against most killers, we're stuck with it. you have the option of using Spine Chill, a good and free perk, along with other viable gameplay counters against the Spirit, in order to change the way you loop. Don't claim she can't be countered just because you have to counter her differently.

You link me one YT video from nearly a year ago of him losing a match vs. a likely SWF, pre MoM nerf, on old Preschool as proof, in that video he missed multiple point blank backrevs within the first minute and lost 3 gens in about 100 seconds and admits he should've had the chase ended immediately. 
---
I have news for you:
---
A) that match is gonna happen to any killer and if anything Billy would've been the only one able to recover it with his 1 down + slugging and 
---
B) if you play 10 months of matches and get a small handful of games in which you can point to not completely wrecking teams (at high ranks with no Ruin) that doesn't show that the killer is perfectly balanced it shows you had a bad match running no game slowing perks (you could find the same for Zubat playing old omegablink Nurse, that does not mean she wasn't overtuned it means he fucked up). 
---
The second video shows nothing about a **good** billy it just shows a pepega who [attempts m1s like this](https://youtu.be/YYYGSSt-Pm4?t=243) (no proof that it's a red rank either since he ends the video before ranks are shown and we all know how MM is) going up against Zubat who is one of the best all around players in the entire game. 
---
He 100% would be viable at red ranks with just the map travel (according to Billy mains red ranks don't let them land saws anyways yet they still kill people at red ranks). Good killers can get downs in a relatively fast manner, the issue with the majority of killers is they simply can't get around the map to pressure survivors and gens this is why BHVR has released 2 killers in a row with teleport functions. 
---
I watch Zubat pretty much every time he streams (I know you do to I see you in there Jasmine), I legitimately haven't seen him even have to break a sweat when playing Hillbilly in months. Is this just because he hasn't faced an elite survivor in months or is this because Billy is overtuned and needs tweaking?
---
I‚Äôd be so mad and camp you for that
---
transphobes have one joke, and it's not even funny.
---
Billy is one of the only killers who can get across the entire map in 10 seconds, which is why he‚Äôs good. His chainsaw killing people in 1 hit is a bonus at that point.
---
I don't mind paying $100 per character. I don't mind having to play a little more but I'm going to need a few things to get done and I'm going to need to see progress. I'm not paying for half-assed work.
---
Maybe that's also my problem since it got worse with dedicated servers thanks made!

Last time I played against a Freddy on PS4 I was getting skillchecks at like 10 FPS when in the dream world. I could still manage to hit them but it was near impossible to ever hit a great.

Monstrous shrine could add something actually usefull like making basement hooks inescapable (4% into 0%) or increasing unhook time. Or maybe it could affect every hook on the map (inescapable, longer unhook or even faster hook stage progression)
---
To be honest I like to imagine that a YouTuber will play a single game primarily but will Branch out the show other things.
---
That's why it's a good idea to make that known on your channel so people show up for you and not just because you played this one game
---
I hope it will at least share progress, and cosmetics. The purchases are probably not going to be shared as the companies that are selling them (PS$, Microsoft, Steam) would probably not be okay with that.
---
I am a killer main, and finding when people are bad at looping is very easy.
---
Finding people is the harder part. Using Spinechill to find when the killer is coming your way allows you to be bad at looping but still play the game. The downside is your still bad at looping.

Ingame, lobby issue
---
Killer Main here,
---
I've recently gotten back onto Dead by Daylight and can't play killer. I'll be stuck in the "searching for game" for about five minutes, then put into an empty lobby, and then, after around another five to ten minutes, sent to the start screen with the message "Network connect required" and "The lobby was closed because of an error. Please try again."
---
This has happened repeatedly over the last week as I've tried to get back into the game.
---
I have more than fine internet connect, LAN is open, and so on. Is the game just broken or is there a fix?
---
Any help is super appreciated. Thank ya.
---
Nancy's special power is missing skill checks, preventing the survivors to leave
---
The fact that they aren't even considering adding Mr Envy's custom chase musics to the game is a crime. I would never be mad about facing Legion if his theme for him was in the game. The guitar riff is insane.
---
I sometimes do this if a game goes really quick or someone dc's early on, except I'm bad at finding hatches so it's a bit awkward having me just like "sorry hold on I'm trying my best to find it sorry" as I walk around the map feeling like an idiot
---
It doesn‚Äôt
---
First off, I said 3 or 4 and you named 6. Sooo not that far off even assuming all of those are viable.
---
Second off I think we have to agree to disagree.
---
Spirit and nurse yes for sure.  They are the only killers on the game who are viable (at top level play) with no addons.  And on every map
---
All the rest need addons to compete. Billy can do it with a green and yellow but he is map dependent and cannot win on just any map.
---
Hag and huntress are also map dependent and also require good addons to even have a chance (again at top level play)  
---
Sooo yeah. Spirit, nurse, and mayyybe freddy or Billy if you want to count them. But nurse and spirit are the only killers who cant be looped properly.
---
My friend came up with a tweak that I think seems pretty fair. When she is phasing, make the moaning from injured survivors on her screen non directional.
---
Only for his bitch scream.
---
It doesn't show it's optimized in settings. So I had no idea.
---
Honestly...and I may be downvoted for this...but I find killer is really easy now. With the right build, and the right addons, it's pretty easy to pip.
---
Now, obviously there are things that make it hard. Map RNG, actual good survivors, shitty maps in general like Ormond. But if I really want to win most of my games, I just got to stall out the game long enough and everyone dies. 
---
I prefer survivor a lot more, lately.
---
Um. I don't believe you can friend each other, and this might make joining a lobby together difficult, as you can't add friends though the game or between steam and the Windows Store.
---
Cross play was implemented less than a week ago, so we may see the ability to join each others lobbies in the future but we will see.
---
are you seriously calling people from the Apache gender, a joke? 
---
shame
---
Didn't realize you can force the entity to consume more options by leading it to a fork, thanks for the tip!
---
Ring+beads baseline for gen grab only gameplay, lol.
---
Lol same, Steve Harrington, Steve Harrington, Steve Harrington
---
In lower ranks it‚Äôs more frustrating for the killer as survivors will often just not cleanse reducing her to an m1 killer which skilled survivors excel against. In higher ranks though she can be really frustrating for survivors  because they will cleanse and just get butchered by huntress 2.0
---
X_BoostedEgirl_X add me for a laugh, I BM killers and use annoying perks like Object and head on.
---
&gt; Because he has to be up your ass to do it? And he has long charge time so if you have a window or a pallet you are safe and sound?
---
correct, and Huntress also has to be up your ass to hatchet you point blank, which is what you were referring to. 
---
&gt; You're playing vs some really bad huntresses if they legit can't hit you on loops.
---
sometimes they can, sometimes they can't. it's all about how the loop is structured coupled with how the survivor approaches it. that's how looping works. 
---
I keep noticing that when survivors claim a killer cant be countered, it often turns out they just cant wrap their head around the fact that killer X cant be countered the same way as killer Y. you're playing against 2 different opponents with 2 different powers. countering them is not supposed to be exactly the same. in fact, if it is the same, then the two characters are badly designed.
---
Np, the more you know the better but Michael's gonna be pissed.
---
Lol I mean it's not like some people haven't owned a PC before. Some don't have the money to fix it though. Also if they played against them then I'm sure they would learn.
---
Hag still the best Mori tho
---
Same exact shit happened to me. I damn near cried.
---
Never heard the term
---
I‚Äôm only responding because you mentioned Scott‚Äôs video. And I will only be mentioning Scott‚Äôs video because this isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Just need to lay out facts for you next time you want to try and have this conversation. 
---
Scott‚Äôs video included a 34 second timing on Zubat, the arguable best player in the entire game, and Scott mentions how he thinks he‚Äôs the best player. Zubat and Scott are miles ahead of everyone, so 34 seconds isn‚Äôt applicable to everyone. That was an average for ZUBAT. Not me, not you. 
---
Also included in the video, a disclaimer. When Scott said he played using the purpose of his build, that time a survivor lived decreased dramatically. It went down to like 11 seconds I think. 
---
Finally, you‚Äôre just outright wrong at this point regarding hook times and gen times. Have you ever seen Scott‚Äôs stream when he plays spirit? The dude actually shows you how unfair spirit is. Gens don‚Äôt get done after 3-4 hooks. He usually 4ks with absolute ease.
---
Way easier to pull off 360s on PC.
---
Well duh
---
Giving Michael tier 3 relies on Michael stalking, the survivors can absolutely stay grouped up and cause it to be quick but generally people don't while Plague still completely relies on survivors cleansing. Like, Plague does NOTHING to make survivors cleanse, other then hope that they do since it's rarely worth it since you'll just get put into broken shortly after you're seen again.
---
Giving STBFL stacks is basically saying, "Well they can get hit." Yes, your team is vulnerable to the killer pressing M1 but again same with Michael people tend not to just give M1 hits and AGAIN, Plague relies on the survivors completely to get the damaging version of her power.
---
Disarming the trapper's traps while you're near doing a gen, sure. It's justifiable since it still wastes the trapper's time and without his traps set up he's basically just wraith without cloak. Disarming his traps set him behind a lot, especially if it's the only ones in an area OR if it's on important pallets/windows. I get your point of bringing him back and getting you off the gen, but it does have justifiable reasoning. If they step on it that's just them fucking themselves over, they probably weren't going to provide shit to the team anyways.
---
Throwing down a pallet or even trying to blind a killer during pickup and fucking it up usually comes down to people not knowing or messing up the timing or the fact it just isn't consistent. Like it has happened to me many times and has been in many videos where the killer is already starting to move after picking someone up, a pallet gets thrown down, you see +1000 for a killer stun and it doesn't save. I don't think I've ever seen anyone literally just throw a pallet on a killer during the pick up animation unless they were new and didn't know they had to time it and by extension the same people are the ones who throw pallets down randomly since they know it delays the killer but they don't know how how to use it more efficiently. It's rare to see people do this shit just to troll in my experience.
---
Yes a bad team is bad, no surprise. But again, Plague is one of the few if not the only thing in the game that completely relies on the survivors to decide to activate the power. Everything else for the most part, has reasoning OR is generally more reliant on the killer to activate it. I've had a single game out of many against Plague that I actually had reason to cleanse, 3 of us were alive, gates opened, 1 on hook and 1 being slugged and as she should've been Plague was camping. Cleansed to be able to tank an extra hit across the map since she wouldn't be able to get it anyways then went in to save who I could. If anyone cleansed literally at any other point in that match, we'd have all died as opposed to only giving a 1k or 2k whatever it was.
---
First, I'm part of lgbtq+ community, my intentions weren't transphobic. 
---
Second, it's not a meme, it's a shitpost, which is not hilarious it's just random shit from the internet.
---
I‚Äôm literally shaking and crying over this post I‚Äôm so upset and offended
---
I agree, what does hat have to do with your argument?
---
Almost 5 weeks... Still nothing
---
I understand it's long, as it's kind of a large concept to take in all at once. Apologies.
---
As I mentioned, players are not scared. They just aren't. This game is not scary after several hours. I'm not suggesting a system where players are scared. Dead By Daylight is not scary.
---
As stated, the system is meant to make the game more fun and interesting. In addition, it would prevent players from playing like Rambo. It is silly to think that a Survivor would run up and taunt a hulking murder machine. This would make that a bad idea and players would have to manage their Survivor's Terror. Simple as that. You've misunderstood the concept from the get go. Sorry.
---
There is no amount of uncertainty you can create in a game like this without something being random. Like RNG.
---
Imo the only thing she needs nerfed are her prayer beads and the passive phasing
---
Whats forever Freddy?
---
As a Freddy main, I agree. I only use them on swf if they bring a bunch of items or if they are all the same character
---
It would've been better, if I could explain what I like or dislike about DBD, but I guess this is better than nothing. Processing the results in a different format would probably be very time consuming..
---
Wait no I used Anton actually c:
---
WhY yOu BuLlY?!? Lol
---
I play both. Wait what's that I hear. A baby killer that struggles and doesn't know how to play efficiently doesn't play survivor and because of that he can't grasp on how survivors outplay killers. Barely played killer and uses a basic killer build. Yikes
---
Really depends for me.
---
Before spending points I look for high priority perks, that I want. Teachables, Ruin, Dead Hard etc. Then I look for high priority Offerings, If I use items a lot I would look for Wards, Mori's for killer and the Event ones are a no brainer. After that its what add-ons/ Items I need. I like Hag so I look for TP distance and Trap range.
---
If I cant find anything that I want, I look at the cheapest route possible and spend as little blood points as possible. If your are purely looking to level for teachable perks, look for areas from Perks to the center that allow The Entity to cut off a portion of the web with one move, as this drops the cost of that level substantially.
---
Killer main here and I play survivor with my friends every now and then. Playing killer straight up fucking sucks. Playing survivor is way less stressful and more chill. Sigh
---
Too bad the franchise is still in legal hell and we probably won't get it any time soon.
---
Yeah, doesn't help when the killer is invisible, or a stealth killer.
---
&gt; A highskill ceiling means that putting effort into improving will mean you are much better than the average player
---
yes. And that's what i said about Legion.
---
Im part of the lgbtq+ as well. But this joke is used alot to mock trans ppl and anyone that doesnt really conform to the gender binary. (Basically saying oh u can identify as a woman well i can identify as a helicopter) Even if u didnt mean it as transphobic the joke has a bad reputation and isnt that funny to begin with.
---
You can keep your Sprint Burst on the edge of being finished sure, but during that time you cant cleanse totems, you cant unhook, you cant do gens, you cant heal. So it's incredibly niche in that you can run up to the killer, then sprint burst away and bait them into chasing you (which no high level killer will bother with the moment they know you have SB). BL offers the faster landing throughout the whole of the game - and loops with verticality are unmindgameable by every killer that isn't nurse - it's just overall stronger
---
Good killers will track with sound and not making noise whilst injured is massive. It helps you stay hidden very very well, and spirit is the most played killer at high rank (and the strongest) and it makes escaping her unoticed in her power possible
---
Freddy quotes get me so moist, damn I wish Robert Englund was Freddy in DBD
---
Thank you so much!
---
He said facecamp, I think everyone agrees EGC proxy camping is just how it goes. At that point it‚Äôs not camping it‚Äôs literally just securing a kill. I think he means camping during early game or just randomly at anytime not during the EGC.
---
One part of a 3-piece set of bloodied cosmetics. There is a secondary benefit in that the quality of the Bloodweb is "improved", but they've gone on record as saying that it is practically unnoticeable.
---
More killers need inbuilt slow down in my opinion.
---
It's decent
---
"No0b3 bad" is all I could decipher.
---
any killer that isn‚Äôt viable in the lower ranks relies mostly on misplays from the survivors side as well though.
---
One day they‚Äôll hold it the correct way.
---
What a bizarre assumption to make. How do you know what other play will or won't like, especially on a barely fleshed out character.
---
He said on twitter that he was moving and will move on the 15th with better wifi. He will also start streaming sometime past the 15th and will most likely also upload.
---
Memorization =/= skill. Reading Killer movement and patterns to ascertain where to go next  =/= skill. It's all repetitive and there's no situation that is not "If this, then that"
---
This best survivors literally *run in circles*. The skill ceiling is a few inches above the floor.
---
Spine chill is also good for pallet mind games, since if she‚Äôs standing in front of you completely still and spine chill goes out for a second then it‚Äôs safe to say that she‚Äôs going around the pallet

A part of me cant live without this game but another part of me lowkey wishes it dies just to teach the creators a lesson. .....that lesson would be for them to listen to the community when they say the experience isnt fun because of the shit hitboxes and constant ERROR messages.

/r/onejoke

His traps do not allow him to teleport to survivor and hit him immediately or completely immobilize him. His traps do not allow him to slow survivors down immediately like clown can. 
---
Sure his traps can be annoying, but they are not OP. 
---
And downsides are unnecessary. They are unfun. Better reduce slowdown on traps or just get used to them and find the best tactic against them.
---
Jokes are like dick, don‚Äôt take it to hard.
---
The final decision is BHVR's. If they say it's a ban, it's a ban - doesn't matter how many players do it or how we the players choose to interpret it.
---
If you feel it's worth the risk, swing away.
---
Noooooo... 
---
We already told it hundred times ! no use of logic in this subreddit guys !
---
Freddy's hits pulls you into the dream world. The timer will go down even when you're being chased
---
Am I the only one that gets annoyed because they don't hold it right?
---
Why does every Leatherface camp out when someone's hooked? Honestly 90% of them I've ever faced, what's the strategy they're using and do they not care that generators are getting done in rapid succession while they get one sacrifice
---
Well it's a long one that I think solves a lot of things.
---
**Mori Changes:**
---
1. Cypress Mori: **Is base for all killers**. It's a one-time use on the last remaining survivor during End Game/hatch search. Find them, down them, mori them without losing points/emblems. Cannot be spammed/interrupted.
---
2. Ivory Mori: Is a one-time use mori which requires two hooks before it can be used on one survivor **before** the end game/hatch search has begun. If the end game arrives and you haven't used it, you lose it. Cannot be spammed/interrupted.
---
3. Ebony Mori: Allows you to mori all survivors which have been hooked twice after you down them, both before the end game and during the End Game. Cannot be spammed/interrupted.
---
**Chests Changes:**
---
1. All chests are locked in the trial and can **only** be opened via a dull key.
---
2. Inside of chests will only be healing items, BP reward items, a broken key, or another dull key.
---
**Keys Changes:**
---
1. Broken keys (and their addons): Remains the same.
---
2. Dull key: **No longer works on hatch**. Can only be used to open one chest unless you find another dull key in said chest or is given another dull key by another survivor. Several dull keys will spawn around random places on the map and can be found and used.
---
3. Skeleton Key: Allows only **one** survivor to escape through the hatch once it spawns, after which the hatch slams shut instantly preventing more than one survivor from jumping into it.
---
**Hatch Changes:**
---
1. The hatch becomes visible until two conditions: Either all gens are done or, if the all gens aren't done, then it only becomes visible five seconds after the death/DC of the third survivor. **This eliminates hatch camping**.
---
2. While a Skeleton Key does unlock it, the hatch itself is rusted shut and the survivor needs to pry it open. A struggle mechanic/skill check mechanic then starts occurring for a time of 15 seconds. The survivor **must** hit these skill checks/struggle prompts until the hatch slams open at which they can then jump in. Like exit gates levers the progress is saved and can be resumed if you stop prying open the hatch.
---
3. However the killer receives an **explosive notification** of the hatch's location once the skeleton key is inserted into the hatch, and must race to it's location to stop the survivor from prying it open. Once the hatch is opened the killer cannot prevent the survivor from jumping into it, but the killer can grab the survivor if the survivor is caught prying open the hatch in front of him/her.
---
I think that sums up everything. Moris are harder to get, Keys have  specific uses and are harder to get, and hatch escapes are now earned.
---
Nah, now you need to actually manage your blinks and know how to make the best of it
---
Ok boomer^2
---
Honestly man I think that gives them validation. If someone clicks their flashlight or t-bags I just try my best to win the game and show that they aren‚Äôt getting to me. It makes them more mad when you ignore them and play normally. I‚Äôve found I get more hate mail and shit when I kill everyone after a tough game rather than facecamping 1 dude. They win when you stoop down to their level, rise above. Be an unforgiving machine that stomps everyone. Then maybe they‚Äôll learn to just play the game normally idk
---
Wont be long before Bubba requires two direct chainsaw hits to down, and huntress hatchets give speed boosts
---
Gens, you doing?
---
Okay I'm black and in the lgbtq+ community. When it comes down to it it's just a joke and a pretty unoriginal one at that. Don't take it so personally because you'll just come off looking a little crazy. This leads into other jokes of people making fun of us. This is why Dave Chappelle made fun of us because because we gave them so much material work to with
---
Just time it right.
---
Yeah I know the feeling. I don‚Äôt really like to play like that, I usually play trapper, wraith, or leatherface at purple ranks. I‚Äôve been to Rank 1 as trapper before, I just like to play off meta stuff
---
Being part of the community doesn't automatically qualify what you do or say as not being transphobic or harmful. It's a shitpost that replicates a meme.
---
they were joking
---
I speak for the Quentins and we demand a speedo cosmetic
---
If he played survivor with that perk,  he'd know how inconsistent to perk activate truly is, instead of arguing that  it has some niche use on SWF. I agree that old MoM is busted, its downside is negligible and had no counterplay against most killers.  However New MoM is neither "high risk, high reward" as he adamantly claims since its a pure gamble on getting protection hits, for a minor bonus of having the ability to tank 1 hit.
---
you bind looking left / right to QE this way you can steer the chainsaw over long distances way better (if you try it with mouse your mousepad will not be big enought) also you can do some very sharp chainsaw turns if you time it right the sec your chainsaw starts.
---
It does indeed lose them the game, I think at that point it‚Äôs more of ‚Äòhaha I got this guy and now he‚Äôs gonna have a bad time I win haha no one loves me or appreciates me in real life so I must assert dominance over this person I‚Äôm never going to meet so I can get validation‚Äô. And at that point it‚Äôs more sad than anything
---
It is the left bumper. You are just missing it. It doesnt make a sound for fail
---
Those are the 2 I use it for exclusively.
---
Entitled survivor main found. Is legion dirt simple yea? Is that really an issue, no not really. Legion is undeniably the weakest killer in the game by far. Anyone who argues otherwise is either blind or has their head stuck so firmly up their own ass they lack the oxygen to think properly.
---
Oh and maybe use less ad hominem next time and more of constructing a valid argument as to WHY you disagree. Go ahead ill wait...
---
Flair: bloody clown
---
Considering streamers giving survivors the hatch are not banned, I would be supprised if they started banning for it.
---
I don't get why so many people are calling this a transphobic joke. Also the more people there around that term transphobic the less meaning it really has. To a point it's like going around the term white privilege or Millennial it just becomes a joke of itself... also are we really going to discuss this in a video game forum
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt think this too far ahead huh
---
Something really important about hiding.
---
You need to expect that the killer isn't brainless. If they are not chasing anyone, and are around where you are, they will probably see you. If you move, you move grass and if they are not chasing, they will hear it rustle. However if they are chasing someone most people get tunnel vision and as long as your not in bright colours (Ash Default, Megs red coats, Dwights High Vis jacket, Claudette's neon pink jacket thats brighter than the fucking sun etc), they would probably miss you if you are barely in sight.
---
But use your brain, don't try to keep hiding if you are pretty sure they saw you.
---
IMO make MoM not an Endurance ability but either an Exhaustion perk or the passive heal over time like Second Wind
---
When Legion was first released they were pretty broken, but instead of making a balanced change BHVR nerfed them to the ground and now their power sucks. I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôre going to do the same with Spirit.
---
OK deleted lel, guess people stand jokes as I don't
---
This is so sad. I actually left DBD after F13th came out, and have a total blast with Friday 13th, play it almost everyday with friends, having a lot of fun and end up with more then 2500 hours spend in this game, and still play it from time to time, so this whole lawsuit BS ruined everything.
---
I got to rank 7 and decided to afk for awhile to grind out the rift a little. Optimal SWF completely breaks the game to where as killer you have to play a certain way, use certain perks, and certain killers. Plus everytime i get a new killer i dread using them because i know the shit show that's about to take place. 
---
Meanwhile im winning back to back survivor like it's nothing cuz it's nothing. It's actually pretty crazy that the higher survivor rank you sure the easier the game is but yeah fuck it I'm staying green from now on as killer
---
Ghost face mori,best mori. I like to laugh while suffering from the inside because I failed at life and the game.
---
Oh dear look at those numbers! I wish i could get numbers as good as these
---
You're essentially saying that any system that you can learn in is one without skill... reading a killer is skill. You learn what's strong what isnt, you make predictions based on an intuition you nurture through practice and game knowledge, and you apply that to your gameplay. That's skill. That is literally what you do in any skill based game. There are mechanical applications in timing, running loops tightly, when to leave gens, and so forth, then there are strategies with perks, order of gen completion, and positioning.
---
I duNnO
---
I thought there was something blocking that spot?
---
I mean, they are stalky, but their stalking mechanics are very different.
---
This just made me  wonder, why even include Bill on that list?
---
I‚Äôm gonna miss crackhead Quentin
---
Yeah I mentioned that, there is no point in crouching still next to a gen, I usually just walk or crouch away as soon as the killer is coming (spine chills lites up) and hang around the area but from a large distance
---
If you can hit great skill checks then you can hit DS skill check.
---
First of all, I never deny zubat is good, but you need to also realize Scott is far above average in terms of playing spirit, so it is an assumption based on both parts plays really well. If it‚Äôs a very good killer player against average survivors, isn‚Äôt it fair for the killer to win? Also, if dedicated servers are not absolute trash, dead hard works as your extra health every 40secs for a good survivor. If you are talking about reality, when most survivors just walking around doing nothing , self care at a corner, keep failing ruin skill checks or rush in for hook farm, of course they will lose to one of the best killer players playing one of the strongest killers in the game.
---
&gt; While true, that's not really well designed counterplay and not really something that you can realistically do.
---
it's not something you can do everytime. but it's something you can do often enough to make it viable counterplay, especially with her speed limitation. you can't avoid chainsaws everytime. you cant avoid shocks everytime. or Shred. sometimes trapper chases you into a place where there's no way out but to get trapped or dodge his swing, and if you can't, youre fucked. that doesnt mean they arent counterable. it just means you lost. That's the game.
---
and notice where we are now. first, the claim was that insta hatchets have NO counter. you now admit there IS a counter, but it wont work everytime. those are two totally different claims. if it did work everytime, the Huntress would be useless. Counters to gameplay arent supposed to be able to work everytime. you're supposed to lose sometimes. 
---
Also notice that avoiding an insta-hatchet is the same as avoiding a regular one. the difference being that you have to do it twice. so if it's true there's no counter to insta-hatchets, then there's also no counter to regular ones. so the same people will just bitch the same way.
---
Level 1 to P3 50 is probably around 7-7.5 mil BP
---
We don‚Äôt know that tho. Alchemist is possible but nothing is set in stone, it‚Äôs all speculation.
---
3 = 1. Thank you for this knowledge.
---
Anyone else still not getting any auric cells they already passed on the rift? Patch notes said it was fixed but it hasn't given me any at all
---
If you know how to do your blood web properly and go for cheap items and avoid expensive ones, you can easily do it for 1,000,000 blood points.
---
She can see scratch marks, see grass moving, and hear you breath. She can also just fake using her power. You really cant only guess what to do and hope the spirit is stupid. Theres little if any counter play. Also dedicating two whole ass perk slots to counter a single killer who you arent playing against most of the time is stupid. You shouldnt have to lose 2 perk slots to have a chance against a single killer.
---
Yeah but maybe survivors will start blaming each other for ruining the match instead of the killer. A typical thing I hear is if a survivor DC's it's the killers fault since he must have been doing something that upset the survivor.
---
U kinda have a point and I understand its just a shitty joke lol but its also one at the expense of a already struggling community of ppl. It didnt really offend me personally but im also not just gonna let someone get away with a clearly poor taste joke lol.
---
Ok I'll give you that. Skill is a learned behavior.
---
Spirit has full control of her motion, and even if you don't Phase into a hit, you'll often Phase close enough that a hit will happen a lot sooner than with any other killer. Spirit can appear out of nowhere and smack you or grab you. Billy lacks full control and is impossible to miss because he's *loud*.
---
Iron Will definitely counters her Phasing into a hit from out of nowhere, sure, but it doesn't counter a novice Spirit that's just using Phase to close gaps or to travel. She'll just run you down the old-fashioned way.
---
I personally wouldn't say Billy has a high skill ceiling. He has a skill floor, just like Nurse, but there's no real ceiling. Follow survivor, backrev, instasaw when they screw up. That's the easy part.
---
LOL. You know you can eat a DS mid game to get it out of the game right? Also not much I can do when you‚Äôre the last person at the exit gates!
---
Very true. It's a tough to balance game considering how critical balance is to enjoyment. That's without even considering how much of a wench SWF throws in.
---
Play killer and tell me how many DS‚Äôs you end up eating.
---
Dk what u mean by ppl stand jokes as i dont but ty for taking my advice lol ;))
---
They will likely De-pip anyways from dying.
---
This causes Them to depip, and the 4th player to De-pip.
---
Instead they can DC, and get the other player to escape, which keeps the 4th players pip, but still takes the third players.
---
Laughs in five gen Freddy.
---
Idk people is made of cristal or they might just want to be social justice heroes for a day, and I'm part of the same community I still don't get where to get offended, I just deleted the post because I don't want more problems
---
The chainsaw attack can insta-down both the person getting unhooked and the unhooked, so losers who can‚Äôt get any kills sometimes use this strategy. The best counter play is to abandon your teammate and do gens
---
*Keemstar screaming*
---
\^When you're judgemental on the internet thinking what youre doing is activism when its really just being a child.
---
My guess is that it was just generated from a list of all killers/survivors and they just didnt take the time to edit out the irrelevant ones.
---
It‚Äôs all a simulation anyway.
---
nerf fanataphobia
---
What if they touch him to make him better?
---
Because failed salarymen inherit from their families too.
---
I don't like this idea. Chests are already pretty niche, no need to nerf them. The mori's are ok, but the ebony is absolutely worthless. A mori (except pig) almost always takes longer than it does to find a hook, so this is pretty useless. The key shouldn't have anything to do with boxes either, as explained above. I don't mind having an action to open the hatch, but I don't think it should take more than 5 seconds (though I'd have to test it in game to determine a perfect amount of time). The killer should not get a noise notification of the hatch being unlocked. I understand the rationale behind it, but it really just make the hatch impossible if its a killer with high mobility, which is one of the only good reasons for keys to exist.
---
And glowing medkits
---
_dank exhaling sounds_
---
I meant standing it as something offensive. Like another guy said here, it's better if people find the funny sense of the things instead of making things offensive
---
Okay as a black man there's too many jokes about my race and I really could care less about most of them because that's all it is a joke. Also I know too many in the community that has very good standing it hasn't struggled much to get what they have
---
Anyway let's just go back to talking about dead by daylight
---
You can literally do what he does IRL right now. Like, just crouch. If you aren't wearing leather and magical floating strands of fabric drifting around you you'll be even stealthier.
---
I misunderstood the conclusion from your preposition. I had incorrectly inferred that you meant to fix the issue of survivors acting with reckless abandon (fearless) by instilling fear in the players. I see now that you sought to use game mechanics to force players into a mechanical position where that kind if gameplay is untenable.  I still dont agree with the complex application, but i can at least understand the reasoning.
---
No thats not what gen rushing is, gen rushing is doing the gens as optimally as possible so that they are super fast, ur on about a whole other thing
---
Plague is easily my most hated killer. She's simply 110% unfun to play against. I've never had a fun match against the Plague.
---
I don't think she's overpowered, she's just awful to play against.
---
Cross play would be rough, I think.
---
Not even for the skill gap. On a simple control scheme like DbD has, console players could adapt.
---
No, the hardware disadvantage that console players have would be what wrecks the game. My Xbone already struggles with frame drops when I'm killer and also from weird framerates with skillchecks. Some games I hit great check after great check while in other games I'm struggling to hit good checks.
---
It might not be that bad if the game was fps locked if you opted in for crossplay though.
---
That's much more fun for everyone involved imo. A proper challenge (one that's fair, so not spirit) is a lot of fun.
---
I've read that Legion's Killer instinct doesn't get affected by distressing anymore?
---
Killer good. Survivors bad.
---
Add a jaws chapter and swimming mechanics to every map.  In the maps without water.  It would just be a fat guy in a shark suit T posing.
---
Don‚Äôt forget the times when your behind a wall as Ghostface and still somehow get broken out. They need to revert it to how it was in the latter part of the ptb. It was harder but it was still reliable. Now you can get broken out from across the map behind a wall. It‚Äôs stupid. That shit sucks.
---
I will go on. I've said it to every other person I've replied to and I'll do it again.
---
Plague is one of if not the only thing in the game that relies on the survivors to activate their power/effect and it is VERY rarely justifiable to do so.
---
Haunted Grounds can be justified even if it fucks you over because it could be other hex perks. Even when you don't have an indication of the effect, it could still be Devour Hope before 3 stacks, it could be Third Seal and you never got hit, etc. The reason to cleanse it is justifiable in a vast majority of cases.
---
Many if not all perks that rely on survivor interaction to be able to impact other survivors tend to have triggers. Dying Light is just to get hooked but it impacts your whole team, STBFL is just to get hit but it impacts your whole team, etc. A lot of things killers have unsurprisingly is designed to help the killer kill the survivors and when it relies on the survivors to do something it also tends to have justifiable reason/incentive for the survivors to have to trigger it OR it's reliant on the killer or survivors to be trolling. Cleansing against Plague is such a terrible idea that it's bad almost every single time and when people cleanse just because the option is there, which is usually why people will cleanse at all, it's annoying to get fucked by it yourself. In all my games against Plague I have only ever had ONE reason to Cleanse and it was at the very end of a match trying to save 1 or 2 people that were getting camped which if Plague went to get that upgrade it would've been easy saves and escapes so she couldn't anyways.
---
Fun is absolutely subjective yes and what you explained about things like DS or BT is why people complain about them and why people who say shit like, "Just don't tunnel!" Simply get laughed at. However I'm not talking necessarily about fun, I'm talking about bad design. Some people dislike Plague and want change, because of her power being such a stupid gimmick while as far as I can recall, every other bit of complaining rallying for killer changes has been because of either the killer being clearly too strong such as Nurse or Spirit or less commonly because of how annoying the killer is with Legion though that was also mostly because of the mend glitch at the time.
---
Im not sure Ive just seen a screenshot before but it should be somewhere in the options :-/
---
You‚Äôre exactly right. And for the most part I never really had to camp or tunnel either
---
Someone PLEASE change their Doctor portrait to this
---
That's per prestige. Definitely not all the way to P3 though.
---
[deleted]
---
u just trash
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that they‚Äôd let you turn off cross play, cause they let you turn of cross play between Steam and the Windows Store
---
Holy shit nevermind dude I replied to you right when I woke up because I thought you said "audio" And not "visual" But yeah a visual queue might work, depending on how subtle it is.
---
The worse is when you are on your first hook and all 3 survivors are doing gens with no intention of saving you
---
Lol all i did was call out a bad joke
---
Yeah, people claiming they need to camp or tunnel at red ranks just can't accept they don't belong there.
---
Idk, I haven't tried recently, been playing no mither steve
---
Yeah, but they've thrown a few things at us like that. Bubba and Ghostface released without a survivor, and Bill was released individually as well.
---
I don't think she needs to be hard nerfed.. One small nerf and make her harder to play... Its literally impossible to lose chase as spirit.
---
Something I find useful to keep in mind is that, the way timing works out, the Killer has to chase and hook someone roughly every 15 seconds, on average, to get a 4K. That's obviously a bit of an oversimplification, but that's how the math works out so it's a useful point of reference.
---
Healing takes \~15 seconds; when you heal, the Killer gets enough time for an entire extra chase. Self-Care takes \~30 seconds; you've offered up 2 free chases to the Killer.
---
I don't recommend Self-Care. Half the benefit of Bond is finding other Survivors when you need them; get healed that way. Of course, if you stop doing anything productive to go searching for another Survivor every time you're Injured, you can easily waste as much time as you would Self-Caring. So you can supplement Bond with Inner Strength or carrying a Med Kit (to self-heal quickly) or Iron Will (so it doesn't hurt you as much to stay Injured while working a gen).
---
I love stealth and ran Urban religiously for months, but DBD really is not designed to be a stealth game. It's primarily a chase game (looping simulator if you're feeling cynical). I *strongly recommend against* playing without an Exhaustion perk of some kind. Dead Hard is mainly useful to extend looping; if you're less of a looper and more of a stealth evader, Sprint Burst is great for that. Hide behind something hoping the Killer won't see you, and if they do, as soon as they get close you can instantly Sprint Burst away. SB gives you so much distance so quickly‚Äîespecially if the Killer got close enough they tried to take a swing and were stuck in cooldown while you sprint away‚Äîthat it's almost 50/50 whether the Killer will even bother chasing or look for an easier target.
---
If you still want to try to be stealthy, Iron Will is probably the best stealth perk in the game. It will likely do more to keep you alive than Urban/Self-Care/Lightweight will. I also live and die by Spine Chill; it's absolutely essential against stealth killers, and gives you far more useful info than the Terror Radius alone against all Killers. If you have TR but no SC, keep working your gen, Killer's just passing somewhere nearby; if you have blinking SC, they're getting looped nearby; if you have solid SC, move away and hide.
---
So if you prefer stealthier play, I would probably recommend Sprint Burst + Iron Will + Bond + Spine Chill.
---
another survivor main who doesn't understand hit boxes. nice
---
See, if I were to change it, I'd make Diversion actually charge up outside of the Killer's terror Radius at half speed, allowing you to actually use the perk if you're up against a stealth killer or if the killer just flat out ignores you.
---
Maybe not half speed, maybe quarter speed. Just enough that you *can* use it, but are still heavily rewarded for being in TR with it.
---
do people still play F13th? I‚Äôm curious about playing it.
---
And his ability will be able to get fired from his job ingame?
---
&gt;I prioritize eliminating perks from the web (always getting the highest tier one available) and then using the cheapest path possible
---
If you don't like any of the perks, it might be more worth to get the least rare perk (aka usually lowest tier) just so you can get the relatively higher rarity perk out of the perk "pool".
---
Why would NOED need to be changed? It‚Äôs fine in the state it is
---
people keep saying that, is that just a meme, or if not, why is it the best tier?
---
Spirit isn't "meta" she's broken.
---
I hate that garbage ass shitposts like this get so many upvotes on this subreddit.
---
If the next killer is one that needs balance and works, than it will be just as legit and reasonable to complain and want fixes for them as well.
---
It's wild how often this subreddit just upvotes anything that strokes the thoughts of killer mains who like playing whoever is the least fun killer to go against at the current point in time. Oh you 4k almost every game and no one likes facing your killer? Must be because you're soooooooo good at the game. Mhm.. sure.
---
Yeah, you're only queueing with other players who are on PC and have the Xbox pass so the pool of players is more limited
---
so she can potentially compensate for losing the most important sense a killer has. this does not make her OP. it just means she can counter you.
---
I suppose they could jsut remove the TR while she phases and the windy noise so you can listen for her better with your headphones, but then the survivors would be even more mad because then they would't have the free giant alarm bell this game gives them that killers can't counter. they're never happy.
---
I'm not complaining about it tho....I'm saying that everybody that's popular playing DBD constantly bitches about hitboxes and I'm getting tired of hearing the complaint time and time again....I'm not the best survivor so I switch between the two a lot bcuz I'm pretty good as killer......when my hotspot isn't acting up and forcing survivors to teleport during game. Lmaooo
---
Your existence is trash
---
&gt;"Well u saw the chance and took it so ill give u that" is 'i see your joke.'.................. "But posting a tired transphobic leaning joke" is 'its a bad joke from my view'..........." is gonna be a yikes from me" is 'Im  judging for others who are also in the same mindset of being soft.'..
---
So, you want a method to safely and consistently render a Killer's power, in which Killer is DEPENDENT on said power.
---
You want Spirit to become garbage tier then.
---
I was lucky enough to get it a couple games later due to some other players coins and dumb luck of spawning in front one and two more being close by.
---
freddy is fun to play against, spirit is not
---
And by that logic, tunneling is getting survivors down as optimally as possible.  How are you not getting that?
---
That's not a good idea. He shouldn't wait just to play due to a monthly thing. Also, playing against good killers and with good survivors will teach him the ropes of the game.
---
He proves nothing, the video he made was stupid and proved nothing, Scott Jund already broke down the video he made in another video
---
&gt; I'm saying that everybody that's popular playing DBD constantly bitches about hitboxes
---
word to the wise: streamers are literally just entertainers and also don't know what they're talking about
---
I love how you take em out of context for your own personal gain! If you need to that to strengthen your argument, your argument was flimsy to begin with!
---
Gens, doing you?
---
I can probably count on one hand how many survivors are going to report a killer for letting them escape, or that let them farm, or that allow them to do any kind of activity that benefits them. You need reports if you want to see bans.
---
On a related note, I very much doubt BHVR pays a team to keep streamers under surveillance.
---
its up to the game developer to support that on console its not native to all games.
---
So close minded... wtf is wrong with these arrogant people..
---
It's interesting, blood pools don't exist unless I use bloodhound which just makes them stand out like neon, I rarely use scratch marks to track because they're hard to see and the ones I can see are just completely inconsistent with where the survivor is and useless
---
I dont know what else I expected from a bloody Kate.
---
He is your chapter-mate, you are going to have to talk with him about your issues at some point!
---
okay i had no clue that was a thing. Like i've been wondering how those billy's made those amazing turns but thought it might have been controller. thnx :)
---
Did you see Kyle Gallner tweeted at the devs? I think they're gonna try to get his likeness rights.
---
And being apart of a community that is overly judgmental on the internet trying to make the INTERNET PC is not activism.
---
A lot of times there's just a lot of lag in the game making it hard to hit certain players, I've experienced it as a killer and as a survivor which feels really dirty

Honestly I‚Äôd rather play against spirit than snare Freddy with solid addons. If he‚Äôs good loops are more or less pointless while at worst with spirit it‚Äôs a coin toss.
---
Yeah, that's what I meant, forgot to mention it though. Whoopsie.
---
It was green ping ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Right when it goes off, your best bet is to break line of sight, hide and find out where the killer is approaching from.
---
at least wait more than 6 hours... so creative  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvbsg2/he\_will\_return/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dvbsg2/he_will_return/)
---
Skill ceiling was the wrong word. I don't believe his skill floor is high and is with about a doubt lower than Spirits. I honestly think Billy is one of, if not is the, easiest of the killers in the game.
---
Back revving is a very easy mechanic to learn and learning when to M1 is very easy aswell. Learning to use your chainsaw to move effectively takes two or three games but so does using the power of any killer.
---
Spine Chill is the difference between guaranteeing you're always two steps ahead of any stealth killer, and being caught with your pants down if you're not paying attention.
---
I main feng and before that it was Claudette..no I have never DCd lol
---
I knew NOED would be mentioned before I even entered the thread...
---
Got a serial number for research purposes?
---
Ah, a true patrician here. 
---
If I owned Steve I would do the same.
---
When i play killer sometimes my frames drop hella hard and make sit super hard to hit people
---
Okay? Again just calling out a bad joke.
---
It‚Äôs still tied to his terror radius, which is why the iridescent button makes the terror radius affect the entire map.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm a huge fan of him and honestly the Freddy we have is nowhere near as awesome as the og version
---
Claudette‚Äôs passive perk ‚Äúblendette‚Äù
---
The fact that it is like that doesn¬¥t mean it is bad design. She is a unique killer, which is good. Not every killer needs to be the same. The fact that she relies on survivors to activate her power is fine, it makes games less predictable depending on who you go against and there is nothing wrong with it. Not to mention you can even eliminate this by just taking 2 apples anyway.
---
Cleansing is a perfectly fine thing to do against Plague, you just need to know WHEN to do it, like later in the game and far away from gens so you can use the time she wastes to go drink and get back. 
---
Again, you are complaining about bad design, but you set the rules of what bad design is because YOU don¬¥t like it. There is nothing wrong with Plague, her design makes matches different and yeah survivors need to learn how to deal with her. There are tons of other ways for your team to fuck you over for the entire match that you don¬¥t notice, but you are just focusing on her because you need to make a point.
---
People making trying to make the internet PC.. what a time to be alive.

---
On the note of knives I would like to see a kukuri but only if they hold it correctly.
---
Its a damn template chill.
---
It infurates me when I see streamers pull off smooth turns with the Nurse, while on console trying to turn her after a blink feels like you're joystick is lodged in some old baked beans.
---
Irrelevant
---
Honestly I'd rather they fix the bugs regarding revealing him being super buggy. It feels like sometimes you can stare directly at him and he won't be revealed, and other times he'll still get revealed when he's hiding behind something and no longer within line of sight of a survivor.
---
So, a couple things: first, SC is only worth the perk slot when it‚Äôs level 3; second, I personally would recommend **Premonition**. Premonition will tell you *which direction* the killer is, and can be far more beneficial against the stealthier killers than SC can, specifically it tells you where they are.
---
Wraith puts the survivor's head in his bell and rings it until the screams stop.
---
No, too many licensed characters in a row dude. Need some original content.

Plague - Original

Ash - Licensed

Nancy - Licensed

There hasn‚Äôt been an OG character added in 8 months.

No but to her if she thinks she killed him then she will be put to rest

Swf vs a pc killer would level the playing field lol
---
Sometimes I actively wait out bloodlust if I think it's coming soon just so it doesn't ruin my swing. I swear bloodlust erases scrath marks too.
---
You are such a fucking troll dude..
---
Had a game with a bubba who facecamoed a survivor and my whole team did gens while he was standing there and at the end he just said you toxic genrushers.
---
Once your death is guaranteed, why *wouldn't* you choose to die a few seconds sooner if it lets you achieve part of your objective, instead of failing completely?
---
The only reason not to that I can think of is points, and for those of us who have been playing a long time and already unlocked the stuff we want (especially those of us who play a lot of Killer and have BBQ), the small number of points you get from one Survivor match are almost meaningless.
---
Using the Perk Deliverance annows you to unhook yourself 100% of the time after you unhook an ally.
---
Other than that there is a 4% chance to save your self. This goes up with luck. Unless you have a perk to give you more chances and a good luck offering, or have a Deliverance active, just wait.
---
I thought new undetectable stopped alone chill from going off? I might be wrong though
---
&gt;You link me one YT video from nearly a year ago
---
Not a single thing changed about Billy since then. In fact I think sf/enduring got buffed by the enduring changes.
---
&gt;in that video he missed multiple point blank backrevs within the first minute and lost 3 gens in about 100 seconds and admits he should've had the chase ended immediately. 
---
&gt;Oh also (according to the comments) the survivor he was chasing in the first video was I'm pretty sure AngryPug who has 7000 hours in the game almost solely on survivor. He still ended the chase in about a minute and should've had it ended in the first 15 seconds.
---
So two good players faced each other and the one who did more mistakes lost. Pug was able to dodge Zub's chainsaws and make him make mistakes. There is no such thing as making absolutely zero mistakes, no matter how good the player is. If billy was overtuned wouldn't he still win despite making those mistakes? One side played better, the other side played worse, the other side lost. Plus aren't we supposed to balance around the high level? Why is both of the players being experienced a problem?
---
&gt;pre MoM nerf
---
MoM didn't change the result of this game though, he'd still only get 1 kill as Ash wouldn't have gone for the unhook, he'd just ran to the other opened door and left meg on hook. He'd still lose and get 1 kill.
---
&gt;on old Preschool 
---
None of the loops used in this video got changed. Both houses are the same, shack is the same, car loop in front of the house is the same, preschool's basement got 1 pallet removed. All of the safe loops in this video are exactly the same now as they were before.
---
&gt;A) that match is gonna happen to any killer
---
So this match just doesn't count? Should we just discard any match where anyone makes a mistake? If so I doubt we'll have enough of such matches, if any.
---
&gt;that doesn't show that the killer is perfectly balanced it shows you had a bad match **running no game slowing perks** 
---
Patrick and Ryan said on many occasions that having tracking perks and chase perks is more valuable on billy than having game slowdown perks. If you can use billy properly sf/enduring/infectious freight will be much more beneficial to you than ruin ever would.
---
&gt;(you could find the same for Zubat playing old omegablink Nurse, that does not mean she wasn't overtuned it means he fucked up). 
---
Excuse me but I've clearly stated that add ons are the issue. Bringing up add ons as an example here does nothing, as I've already agreed that billy with add ons isn't anywhere near being balanced. Instasaw, cooldown, crack billy, all of them are absolutely unfair.
---
&gt;The second video shows nothing about a good billy it just shows a pepega who attempts m1s like this
---
That's how 90% of killers use spirit fury, they swing through pallets. 
---
&gt;going up against Zubat who is one of the best all around players in the entire game. 
---
&gt;(according to the comments) the survivor he was chasing in the first video was I'm pretty sure AngryPug who has 7000 hours in the game almost solely on survivor.
---
So we have good survivors going vs red ranks killers on billy and this doesn't serve as an example of billy not being overtuned when played vs people who know what they are doing. Ok.
---
&gt;no proof that it's a red rank either since he ends the video before ranks are shown
---
I was watching the stream when this match happened and I remember that the billy was red ranks, but I fully understand if my word doesn't have enough weight to be convincing.
---
&gt;I watch Zubat pretty much every time he streams (I know you do to I see you in there Jasmine)
---
Say hi next time u see me zubPFT
---
&gt; I legitimately haven't seen him even have to break a sweat when playing Hillbilly in months. Is this just because he hasn't faced an elite survivor in months or is this because Billy is overtuned and needs tweaking?
---
Could you show me an example of him going vs a team of survivors that knew how to loop a billy, play around loop curves within the last few months? Billy stomps soloQ with survivors mostly hiding and not knowing how to loop well as he has really good snowball potential.
---
For that matter he hasn't lost a single game of Iron Grasp, Mad Grit &amp; Agitation Leatherface in the last two months of playing it pretty often. The guy is just really good at the game, most of the matches he has the survivors are very mediocore. I haven't seen him going vs great players like Enaria ect. in quite a while.
---
Then they just instantly get hatch
---
Beginner Bubba players, and some without Play with Your Food, see only his potential for area-of-effect instadowns. When it works, it'll wipe a team. To some players that's going to seem like an acceptable risk, especially if they're using Ruin or Corrupt Intervention to buy them the time required. All the better if the hooked survivor gets tilted and deliberately accelerates hook progression.
---
At higher ranks it gets harder to pull off, because people are running toolboxes, using Borrowed Time for easier unhooks, and are quite happy to sit for the full hook duration just to see their three buddies burn through the gens and dance out the gate.
---
Andyou wonder why no body likes you
---
It's super lame. But. Death takes 120 seconds. Gens take 80. That's 3 guaranteed gens, and one was probably done by the time the first hook happened. So it's most likely the only kill the killer will get.
---
If you're in the center of a map you have enough time to run to another pallet and punish the billy for whiffing his chainsaw. 
---
If you you're in the middle of nowhere you have bad positioning, which is the number one situation you want to avoid as a survivor versing Billy. 
---
While a basic chainsaw is easy, proper curving is harder to master than nurse imo, just because there are so many loops you have to learn how to curve.
---
M1ing isn't enough against a team who knows how to do gens.
---
ok, keep thinking these things are gonna change from "calling out bad jokes" aka being offended.
---
I've done my part
---
Then you suck major pp
---
Wow that‚Äôs quite a lot for a game
---
Am I the only one who only knows this subreddit because of "Does Bruno Mars is gay?"
---
If you wait until you see the killer couldn‚Äôt you just... know the direction when you see him? I mean if you plan for a few directions then you can have a whole other perk
---
Clearly, you haven‚Äôt used stridor on spirit.
---
Pretty sure it ends tomorrow lol. Could be wrong though.
---
Honestly same if he‚Äôs not one of the idiots that goes pallets he‚Äôs extremely oppressive especially with good addons. At least with spirit even if you don‚Äôt know where she is it‚Äôs a coin toss. On the other hand with Freddy if he‚Äôs smart theres not even really a reason to attempt to loop. On top of that he‚Äôs basically another version of a stealth killer on top of his slows and map pressure due to how his lullaby functions
---
So make it harder for killers to slow the game down, or punishing survivors for ignoring totems.
---
Survivors get worse flashlights and and worse keys...
---
Cant say I agree with these changes. They seem very survivor weighted, which the game already is.
---
Look at the survivors alive and add one. The Generators completed need to be equal to or higher than that number. So if two survivors are a live and two gens are required to power the gates the Hatch as spawned. If there are two players and three Generators the Hatch has not spawned.
---
All of this is Trumped when there is only one Survivor left.
---
That‚Äôs why the blight doc skin has ankle bracelets, YOUR the one who broke his ankles!
---
In dedicated servers it is much easier to pull this off because survivors momentum is very strange from killers POV and there‚Äôs huge d-sync of your real position and your position on other‚Äôs screen.

---
Not really. If the killer is looking in your direction for an extended period of time, that means two things: the killer is standing still staring in your direction, or the killer is moving forward towards you. The former is never going to happen, so you will pretty much always know when the killer is coming.
---
With Premonition, if it goes off, you will never know if the killer is coming. You know they are there, but you don't know if the killer is facing towards you and heading your way. Like I said, the killer could be getting looped 36 meters away. You can either prematurely bolt and hope you just escaped, or stay and completely ignore Premonition. If you bolt, you either bolted for nothing, or Premonition saved your life. If you stay and think it is a false positive, you are vulnerable for another 30 seconds. 
---
It is much less reliable because it forces you to bolt if you want any use of the perk, so you are constantly in a 50/50 chance of being inefficient or successfully stealthing. With Spine Chill, you know when a killer is headed towards you, and you can use situational awareness to predict where they are coming from to neutralize the advantage Premonition has over Spine Chill.
---
This community is so sensitive. Everything is ‚Äútoxic‚Äù. Cosmetics? Toxic. Doing gens too fast? Toxic. Using a flashlight? Toxic. Escaping? Wow, toxic. 
---
This isn‚Äôt how it is in other game communities. Something about this game really triggers people, especially killers it seems. 
---
In other games stuff like tbagging is considered funny and fun. People who play this game act like it personally wounds them. 
---
I honestly just want to get to the bottom of why. What is it about this game that makes people fucking crazy?
---
Yes, people still play it but playerbase is very small due to lack of new content. On PS4 it takes for me 15-20 minutes before i find lobby and start the game, sometimes even more, On PC queue a little better, find a lobby does not take for me more then 5 minutes, but most people who still play it on PC are some kind of trolls who use Soundpad and play some music all the time and shit like that, so it has nothing similar to gaming experience i have long time ago, when a lot more people play this game and they actually play it. Cant say much about Xbox or Switch, but I've heard that on Xbox queue is even worse then on PS4 people mention this a lot of times, dont know anything about Switch version tho, since it was released not long time ago, maybe it has  healthy playbase and queue time up there is not that bad as on PS4 or Xbox.
---
If you have problems locating a survivor who makes noise I don't think anyone can help you at this point
---
Ok transphobe
---
Ah, right. I didn't know that it counts as an actual hit that sleeps you.
---
yeah saying incoherent, run-on retardation doesn't tend to change peoples mind
---
I know that the serum / skins will be there for the duration of the rift (so like, 50+ more days), but when are we going to stop getting the Halloween items like the lunchbox and petals? I have a crapload of them and wanna make sure I use them all up before they disappear.
---
Just saying dude but I'm pretty sure I've seen you be the rude one to multiple people on here including me. Seems weird for you to post this is all but I agree with the post.
---
üßõüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëâüí°
---
I just told you
---
I would argue the first part that is bad killer. Should never be just staring down in one direction. Always be looking around. Unless your stalking.
---
That would just be silly
---
Hell yeah. Since dedicated servers, people drop like flies. Sometimes people who get dropped still appear to be in the match, and the hatch opens when it looks like two people are still alive. I've filed support tickets with BHVR about this before and they gave me the standard "we know about this issue and are working on it" line.
---
If a survivor is alive, they trigger Whispers. 
---
Healthy, injured, dying, hooked, in a locker, so long as they're alive they're going to set it off.
---
Then just play on console? Its literally the same game but 30fps
---
Are you trans? No? Then don't say the joke. Simple as that, chief
---
Hate to say that the font color could be better
---
Damn I thought he hit you. Looked like blood came out when he swung
---
Actually spine chill is just as good at level 1. The only differences between the levels is the gen progression speed from 2% to 4% to 6%. The range it detects is 36 meters at each tier. People use spine chill for the detection, not gen progression, meaning SC1 is just as good as SC3 for detecting the killer. I agree premonition is definitely better for newer players, but spine chill is better overall.
---
I got one game and lerys, but on my legion
---
He rings the bell with their heads, cloaking and uncloaking with each hit until they die.
---
What a killjoy
---
Rather than a nerf, how about a different way to play? An idea could be to force swf groups to all use different perks. That way they can still coordinate as a team but need to plan out a bit more of a strategy with the perks they use.
---
The understanding is that the second page of the Tome unlocks tomorrow.
---
I have gotten two things from this:
---
1. you have no basis for your 5% prediction. 
---
2. you are way overthinking this bud.
---
"Okay guys in this build I am running save the best for last"
---
My PC resets itself sometimes while loading the game. Sorry survivors.
---
It's unlikely to actually reduce the killer queue times.  Increasing the pool of players won't matter much if the Survivor:Killer queuing ratio isn't brought closer to 4:1.
---
It is not the same game, unless you have a really potato computer. I have enjoyed my time on PC much more, gameplay, performance, and graphics wise.
---
Whoever says gutted followed by Nurse i automatically assume hasn't even touched her or seen good players still play her. If a deadass Nurse noob like me can't use crutches like 3 blinks and omega to get 3ks , then they did a fine job.
---
Thats what I meant, I sometimes play without it and regret it when I am against those 2, PB Spirit and wraith.
---
Yeah this was the best I coud do sorry
---
Freddy with 2 rope addons, Ruin, Pop, Thana and Dying Light. Laugh as the survivors struggle to get even 1 gen done. Realize you are satan incarnate.
---
The Crapper confirmed.
---
Tbh stbfl is really good and doesnt need to be combined with anything it is a great perk on its own
---
I gotta test this
---
I am a like 80/20 Killer main, but I take Small Game in just about every single game as survivor. 
---
Ruin, Huntress Lullaby, etc are disgusting to play agaisnt, and in some cases Huntress Lullaby literally brings the game to a halt.
---
Small Game is a beautiful perk.
---
Yep. so afraid of chicks with dicks.
---
How so?
---
I‚Äôm too dumb to read all of this, but you basically wrote a novel so i‚Äôll assume it‚Äôs all good.
---
It would be kinda interesting and stupid at the same time :P
---
Is this confirmed? Bc it seems like kind of a reach to me.
---
Well if you run they'll see your scratch marks so don't do that
---
Just for perfect clarity first; I completely agree with you MURD3RWAVE and in no way is anything I'm about to say directed at you. If anything its directed at the OP and the crowd of whiners on this sub-reddit. Here goes:
---
I play both sides. 
---
There is so much entitled complaining on this Sub-Reddit for Face-camping and tunnelling its amazing. 
---
If you're getting face-camped any team worth a damn should be able to pop at least 1-3 gens while the Killer is doing this and STILL be able to get you off the hook as well.
---
if not; well - some fellas is lucky - and some ain't.
---
It's a game. Not all games are won.
---
You can't survive every game Survivors. 
---
ALL of the Survivors will sometimes get away Killers.
---
The way people complain about how other people play this game - It'd be like if you were playing a shooter and someone with 6 kills and 15 deaths complains that they guy with 32 kills and 2 deaths "isnt letting me kill him enough - i wanna get kills too! :( " ..... its fuckin absurd.
---
If its part of the game - deal with it and try to find a way to have fun! - If you're not having fun - please go collect stamps or something more in tune with you're delicate sensibilities. 
---
I've never once bitched about being tunnelled or face-camped playing as a Survivor - don't wanna get tunnelled? - don't be seen/heard - don't wanna get face-camped? - don't get hooked. 
---
Here's something else I've never done as a Survivor - I've never tea-bagged anyone - at any point because I'm not a little bitch.
---
So - Jack the Ripper - If you're shocked that some people are cunts - the world outside of video games is going to come as a huge shock to you.
---
TLDR: Everyone whines on this sub-reddit; get used to it. Play as both sides and ENJOY this game instead of whining - there's enough of that as it is.
---
Legion might actually be Viable. Woth all of that.
---
It ends tomorrow, you keep the lunchboxes/flashlights after it ends, only the petals will be unusable
---
 [https://linkto.run/p/Z1V47OQJ](https://linkto.run/p/Z1V47OQJ)
---
I think it's to do with the dedicated servers, the game seems to spend so much time trying to find people at your rank on the nearest server to you before it extends its search to further servers and especially at high ranks the queue times are disgustingly long. 
---
(I'm in the UK and we have a London server but I don't think it's necessary to have one, a strong, general European one would probably be better for matchmaking times).
---
Yeah... I kinda stopped playing killer because it's unfun. You either slug and camp to have a chance, or you lose in 5 minutes (assuming the survivors aren't potatoes). So, that was lame. But when I play survivor it takes a few minutes to find a game, and then it's unfun because either the killer plays lame because of the aforementioned issues, which is annoying as survivor, or the game is a wash and unless you're the one getting chased nothing happens the whole game.
---
I started playing killer but only with busted add-ons (Beads, Iri hatchets). I do feel kinda bad, because it's awful as survivor, but there's no fun as killer outside of that, and survivor is only fun if you play with a full group and can dictate the match.
---
Gameplay and is the same you're literally being an fps/graphics pc master race snob.
---
DbD console looks good and runs well enough you're greatly over exaggerating its issues.
---
This. I‚Äôve been debating the Switch purchase ever since it came out. I really just want it mainly so I can casually play in bed/at friends when I‚Äôm not playing it on PC at home. Mainly also for seasonal depression, my Switch is just easier to flick on and play quick when I don‚Äôt have motivation for much during the day.
---
Cross-Progress would be an instant buy for me. $50CAD **plus** all of the other DLC I‚Äôll have to re-buy is the biggest factor stopping me from finally just making the purchase
---
Hey it‚Äôs fine man sill a good meme
---
The way I do it, down them, Grab them walk to the nearest hook while shaking No, Smack the hook and shake no at it and walk away. If they still struggle Kill them.
---
Yes, thats right!! Youre good at the vidya gem *pats head*
---
The problem is at higher levels, there's not much scary about certain loops because you know they have specific repeatable outcomes. The only variances you get are Ghost Face popping stealth mid chase for maximum mind games, Spirit for pretty much the same, and Nurse teleporting straight at you (more frustrating than scary).
---
The reach in this post could travel across the world
---
It‚Äôs probably where you choose to hide, the killer will usually check around worked on generators and their hex totems.
---
For a stealthy way of playing, as soon as spinechill stays lit for more than a few moments walk away from the gen/totem. If they start checking try to avoid their line of sight by walking or crouching around objects and structors. 
---
As you get better and more experienced you can use spinechill to tell you if you can keep repairing/healing/cleansing in the killers terror radius.
---
New Nerf Idea: Remove the bonds keeping her limbs floating.
---
(New Killer: The Leg)
---
Do you have a number for it?  That's really important, as it effects a ton of things outside killer perks.  Exactly how long are we stretching it out?  Are we changing tool boxes to scale?  What about survivor perks that interact with repair times? 
---
It's a massive can of worms to open.
---
1. Yea. It's just a bit dumb to have a killer related to another killer. Especially when the spirits chapter is called "shattered bloodline", referring to her family. Is rin's father going to be shattered bloodine 2?
---
2. Yes I have.
---
Okay transphobe
---
I think all moris are cool, well except for the 3 OG killers. I also think that 3rd-person moris like that of Spirit, Hag and Legion, are some of the best moris; while Huntress, Leatherbutt, and Pig are the best for 1st-person mori
---
If they could upgrade the moris for Trapper, Wraith and Hillbilly it would be great.
---
The phase sound doesn't play to anyone inside her terror radius (which is attached to the husk while she's phasing). So decreasing her terror radius means you have to walk closer to a gen to touch it with the edge of your heartbeat.  
---
Basically unless you're running Prayer Beads, M&amp;A is usually bad for Spirit. There's always the chance I'm missing something about that interaction which is why I asked, but I guess it's not super obvious how it's functioning so don't sweat it.  
---
Thanks for your time!
---
Calling out poor behavior or use of offensive tropes is a form of everyday activism, activism is about holding people to account. Making jokes that rely on punching down aren't funny or fun, they actively contribute to marginalizing those who are already on the fringes. 
---
It might be seen as trying to make the internet PC in terms of not actively contributing to things that perpetuate stigmatization, even though you using here as "I can't be hateful online waaah"
---
Oh damn, I didn‚Äôt realize the range didn‚Äôt change (is that recent, or did it always detect at 36m?); also, I will fight everyone who says SC is superior to Premonition. 
---
Yes I know I‚Äôm essentially a one man army, and yes I know I‚Äôm probably wrong, but **I WILL DIE IN THIS DAMN HILL!!**
---
My colourblindness isn't bad at all. I realise that my ability to distinguish colours is slightly lower than the average person, but, to me, red is still red, blue is still bue, green is still green etc.
---
Only exception are certain shades of purple, for some reason they're just grey. I don't even know what my colourblindness is called and I don't know of anyone who experiences the same problem
---
I'm pretty sure people forget that you don't have to run everywhere leaving scratch marks and spirit can't see people when phasing
---
Note how I said "at any rank." That is not the same as saying "against any team." This is an important distinction
---
holy shit you are insanely triggered
---
Meanwhile. DS.
---
Maybe have them bloodlust faster as a passive?
---
I don't have a number for it, but I'd say the extra time Hex: Ruin usually buy the killer. Then, if we limit the number of slowdown perks to 1, it should balance things out.
---
I think toolbox speed can remain unchanged, but survivor perks could be changed if there's a problem (Prove Thyself isn't necessarily popular in my opinion).
---
So sonic is fixed... Now Quentin's face's turn
---
Next video: "The Build that Survivors don't want you to know about, Nurse with STBFL!"
---
You butchered this format.
---
It sounds cool but it wouldnt make sense lorewise.
---
Good point. Ik it sounds hypocritical to say we shouldn't jump to conclusions but this is the first teaser. I agree that it would be cool to see characters in the game related to one another but I don't see that happening as half of rin's backstory is about the father. Unless it's about after the murders or adventures in the entity's realm, there is not much to put in the backstory.
---
Yeah saw it after posted this
---
Not even a little bit am I a troll.  Lobby dodging is horseshit and shouldn't be in this game.  It wastes a lot of peoples time and there's no reason aside from horrific ping maybe to do it.  You see the survivors so you can equip an appropriate loadout and killer based on items and shit, not so you can cower in fear and babyquit the lobby.  It doesn't make me a troll to call that shit out.
---
Question for OP.. if we are a helicopter, do we have to put down our serial number? there are many of us out here, kinda close minded to clump us all together. .
---
I've only played for a few months now. Made it through all the adept achievements, ranked purple in survivors and near purple for killers. I'm not "the best" but I'm sure as hell addicted to this game. As a veteran gamer in general, I too feel like some balancing needs to be done. Not because I dislike playing against some killers (cause I certainly do), more or less because thats how games stay fresh. Bringing in new content and constant rebalancing of current characters. It allows users to experience that feeling of learning something new, as if we got the game for the first time. A challenging but obtainable win is what keeps us coming back. This being said, I have obviously thought of ways to balance the game, mostly killers but some survivor perks as well. (I may forget to include the perks at the end)  
---
1. The Spirit - A) Better Visual and Audible Ques of power usage. The wraith stays invisible indefinitely but we still have ques when he is near by. This is probably the biggest itch when facing the spirit, she could be playing scarecrow or using her power and there isn't a good way to tell. B) Also, slow her normal speed down a bit similar but not exactly equal to the nurses.
---
2. Ghostface - A) Slow his speed down when he is undetectable. It doesn't exactly bother me that he is undetectable but how can he be so quite while maintaining such a fast speed? Doesn't seem right when he has all these perks to discover locations and gets an exposed option as well. B) Remove the directional indicator that someone almost reveals him. I mean, if you reveal him intirely, he see's where you are anyway. But if youre not wanting to reveal him, he still knows which direction and a proximate distance you are just because you looked at him for a few seconds. I might as well be running with laura strode against him.
---
3. The Nightmare - (my favorite killer to play) A) Dream Snares shouldn't affect survivors IF they are AWAKE. It's hard enough you can't sneak by with crouching or sabotage without a flashlight, plus he is a dream demon so his snares shouldn't affect non dreaming chars. B) Similar to the last one but awake survivors shouldn't see dream pallets. 
---
4. The Doctor - A) His treatment and area Madness shouldn't travel through objects. 
---
5. Cannibal - A)  Adjust his self stun or remove it entirely. It should be similar to Hillybilly's if anything.
---
6. Clown - A) Reduce the area of effect his tonics have, but maybe increase the visual debuff on the survivors more. Simply make throwing them more of an art skill like hatchets from the Huntress.
---
7. Nurse - A) Make her ability have a cancel button (if she doesn't already) or make it easier to control the distance. Once she starts her ability, a survivor just has to time when to cut back and boom easy overshoot.
---
8. Trapper - A) Should find traps in lockers rather than randomly on the ground. Survivors can spot these traps and know who they're facing without seeing the killer. B) Skill checks and time to get out of traps rather than luck, longer time for already injured survivors.
---
9. Legion - A) Allow him to put survivors in the dying state when hit a second time during his rage. 
---
10. Pig - A) Allow her to replenish her traps instead of just having 4 for the match.
---
Now some balance changes for the survivors:
---
1. Small Game should get a visual highlight of 1 iteam when the audio sound goes off. It does no good hearing a sound when there could be dull totem in front of a trap. I think there should be a highlight of at least 1 item if not more when that perk goes off. Plus searching for totems on some maps can be ridiculous. They can be tucked away sometimes.
---
2. Distraction should have a farther distance when throwing. Its pretty useless at 10 meters.
---
3. Spin Chill should have a sound when goes off. I keep my eye on it but you can't always watch the bottom corner of the screen. 
---
4. Sprint should be activatable instead of just running. You handicap yourself to walking around when you use that perk.
---
5. No Mither......this perk is just silly. I mean, you don't leave blood trails or cry when injured, but youre always injured. I could just not get injured and achieve the same thing, while having 2 hits before I'm down. Maybe, instead of being perma injured the entire match, prevent healing for x seconds after being injured. The getting up from the dying state is rare as most killers don't leave your body lying around for too long, especially when they can see you started off injured. So make it only achievable outside the killers terror radius and apply the same unhealable for x seconds afterwards, or just have it work once like Bills perk. 
---
6. If a killer is toxically camping the hook, then the hook survivor should get points for distraction and the bar should slow down and maybe auto struggle as well. IF they are standing in front of you, watching you like a psychopath, you should get points for keeping the killer occupied and give the other survivors time to do what they are trying to do. This would also give the survivor an incentive to not DC. I also feel higher penality for camping as well.
---
It should be obvious that I play survivors more than killers (mainly cause I do SWF) so the survivor perks are limited because I run D.Tap. My job is to find totems to get rid of Hex Gen and prevent NOED. Bottomline, I haven't tried to many combonations of perks as I already have my preferred combo. So there are probablly other perks out there that could use some balancing. I don't know, what do you guys think?
---
Oh damn I knew they were bad but not that bad.
---
I do play killer. Rarely do I eat a DS, and that's usually because I misplayed. Learn when to slug and spread pressure, and stop being bad.
---
Yes they still have my favorite mori
---
yeah I thought the same thing, I only checked the characters I spent real money on. 
---
it was also a little confusing since they dont tailor the survey to console players even if you check that you only play console. like, I'm a Doc main, sop of course I checked that I mostly play Doc. but I didnt tell them I bought Doc, since he comes free on console. So we'll see if that messes up their results I guess.
---
And this is why I can‚Äôt get into red ranks. I‚Äôve been stuck on rank 5 for so long
---
Yep without a doubt, I have a few characters P3 and others P2/1 and all over the place, keeping those is everything for me. I‚Äôm more tempted to buy cosmetics when I know I‚Äôll keep them because otherwise what‚Äôs the point of me having to buy it again I don‚Äôt have that kind of money. I question why they gave switch an exclusive skin though when it‚Äôs not that exclusive when everyone who plays with each other on there has it.
---
Better than chasing them and all the other escape
---
Although it doesn't specifically say there is killers in the void it is implied via the hunger cutscene and the memories. Although they may not physically be there, the wayyy too tall figures standing in void are definitely killers that are unknown and perhaps we will never meet.
---
Haha thats fair on tbe premonition thing. Different strokes for different folks. Also I believe it actually was a semi recent update, I dont remember when but iirc it didnt always detect at 36 meters at all tiers. Also I used to use premonition, isnt the range kinda short? I dont remember. Does it detect GF and piggy? Serious question, I honestly dont remember
---
Don‚Äôt blame you, it‚Äôs why I bought DbD with only Michael for $10 on pc last Christmas time, haven‚Äôt bought another DLC or anything on it since and rarely play it when I‚Äôm away from the PS4 because it doesn‚Äôt matter when I get to my main device.
---
&gt;Also notice that avoiding an insta-hatchet is the same as avoiding a regular one. the difference being that you have to do it twice.
---
And this here is why iri heads isn't a fair add on. Ending a chase in a single hatchet hit, which isn't nearly as hard to do compared to how impactful it is, isn't balanced. You shouldn't have a ranged instadown.
---
&gt;and notice where we are now. first, the claim was that insta hatchets have NO counter. you now admit there IS a counter, but it wont work everytime.
---
Having near-impossible counterplay (which I'd call not being hit by a hatchet in a chase vs a competent huntress unless you are looping a haddonfield house with balanced landing) is equal to having no counterplay, and world play doesn't get you anywhere since the base argument stays. It's not a fair add on.
---
So you literally go out of your way make a post about *a comment* that doesn't agree with your views, then even comment *on your own post* with another quote and berate it...and *others* are triggered? 
---
...wow
---
ü§§
---
Shots you can‚Äôt see are always so satisfying. Would love to get one one day. Console though, rip.
---
There is a tie between 'Choke Me Harder Daddy' Meyers and 'Imma kiss your neck and eat your liver' Hag.
---
If you really hate the survivors, drop Dying Light (it‚Äôs more of a mercy perk) for Sloppy. And exchange the ropes for Swing Chains and Paintbrush. They will not heal, can‚Äôt repair and are all slower for doing it in the Dream World.
---
It's never really good to have to stoop down to someone. Best option is to just walk (or scroll) away from the discussion and leave them in their childlike antics.
---
Why is this getting downvoted?
---
I am disgusted by my fellow wraith. He is banished
---
literally a few comments above yours some pos survivor mains are screeching that chainsaws should only deal one state of damage
---
but okay
---
I'm just wondering what goes through the Spirit's head as she sees younger her
---
Yes...but I also noticed that sometime I just mess up bc I feel like I know where the killer is and try to hide myself somewhere next to the generator but... The killer is right behind me and gets free hit. Idk this perk make me play different and sometimes I should just run away
---
&gt; shut up, you bitch
---
Why do you feel the need to throw such childish insults at me?
---
&gt; killer is invisible, or a stealth killer.
---
I suggest you try a good headset. I have no trouble hearing stealth killers coming at me.
---
&gt; It's just that I can't make it to a pallet or window in time.
---
So... you suck at looping/planning your route ahead?
---
&gt; explain why they're so popular
---
Because the average survivors are dogshit.
---
&gt; and why skill checks exist
---
How's that related to SC/Premo?
---
I have tons of those maps on hill billy.
---
Please don‚Äôt be that douche that runs Object in a SWF
---
This is pretty much my playstyle but it does feel bad when the only person who got cucked by NOED is you. The changes focus more towards the average solo player
---
Probably the same thing that goes through a survivors head when they‚Äôre healing a clone of themself
---
dont worry, hes getting an addon rework.
---
Is Monitor and Abuse needed? Isn't T1 already 0 terror radius?
---
I don't normally swear at strangers online and I very rarely call bed unless it's to call someone an idiot for them being an absolute stick in the mud. I try to keep my comments as respectful to the topic as possible. Of I've come off as rude, I'm sorry, maybe you weren't being respectful in the situation either, tho I hardly remember due to the fact I rarely ever pay attention to usernames.
---
As long as you can turn it off, and doing so doesn't murder que times (it will) then I'm ok with it.
---
and im sure they'll "small adjustment" to his base kit as well =)
---
His chainsaw will have a charge meter or something =)
---
I play both PC and Xbox and got a blind snipe the other day on Xbox lol. I was so surprised
---
Thanks! I was wondering if anyone would notice. But yeah, sometimes my dog lays still and sometimes she likes to rub all over me while trying to play.
---
I know you‚Äôre right, I really do, but when someone is so blatantly incorrect that it genuinely causes me internal pains, I can‚Äôt help but try to show them a better way to do things. I‚Äôll gladly come down to their level if it means I can dispel even a little bit of misinformation amongst the community
---
Ok so it did get buffed‚Äîglad to know I‚Äôm not losing my mind lmao!!
---
Premonition detects ALL killers except for tier 1 Myers (I‚Äôll admit: I haven‚Äôt tested it since the **oblivious** and **undetected** status effects were introduced, so idk if it sees the killers when these two statuses are in play), and it detects at 36m :D
---
[Sauce](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Premonition) (had to look it up to make sure lol!)
---
Yes it is way too soon to form an actual idea on who the next killer is. This is just a wild speculation post on why I think it is the alchemist and can literally be demolished if a new teaser comes out.
---
HEY U/CANTINGPYTHON
---
[DID YOU DELETE ALL YOUR COMMENTS IN THIS THREAD BECAUSE YOU GOT CALLED OUT AS A WHINING, CRYBABY SURVIVOR WHO COMPLAINS THAT KILLERS USE STRATEGIES AND TACTICS TO TRY AND WIN](http://removeddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv3a4y/_/f7ask3p/#)
---
ONLY TO START WHINING AND COMPLAINING ABOUT KILLERS AGAIN **IN THE SAME FUCKING THREAD**?
---
Yep... Yep you did.
---
Not only are you a hypocritical, entitled crybaby [who admitted to DCing and ruining the game for everyone else if you don't get your way](http://removeddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dv3a4y/_/f7awxze/), you're a coward. You can't stand the idea that you're wrong so much so that you'd just delete the argument and ignore it instead of actually owning up to it.
---
thats such a good idea! i love it , would make his mori even more memorable
---
i am not the one screeching obscenities, friend. i am merely pointing out the crusade to nerf every killer
---
Yeah, but the survivors, even as clones, work together.
---
Spirit is actively hunting and killing herself. Survivor Rin may not notice Spirit is her, but Killer Rin definitely would recognize younger her and realize that she's killing herself
---
Please do elaborate how your reply contributed in any way towards the discussion. 
---
I'm not going to quote the whole sentence, ya know? Just the core point.
---
I actually like that better than my idea. Would be nice too for Freddy when it never charges while you're awake
---
I think he said on Twitter he‚Äôs almost got everything all sorted out
---
As you pointed out it's a bit too early. A new teaser can extinguish the idea of Rin's father as well.
---
To be fair man, I appreciate your post, and regardless of what that situation was I appreciate just being able to respond to you now and you understanding what I said as well. I could've been the one you thought was a jerk in that situation in all fairness as well. But I appreciate talking to you now
---
I've seen alot more ghost face recently as well but not in rank reds but it is possible
---
I only dislike him because he didn't finish what he started.
---
I‚Äôve got a lot on my Wraith. I also have a lot on my Claudette and Meg before I prestiged them.
---
You boop the snoot you get facecamped with me.
---
Gens, doing gens?
---
Try restarting the game, system or check your connection. If none of that works, I would try reinstalling or open a support ticket
---
Spirit! Black Friday sales would be ezzzzz with her phase walking

I'm gonna be sick.
---
Playing Killer can really fuck up your FPS at times. I‚Äôve missed a lot hits because the FPS tanked and turned DbD into a PowerPoint presentation. Freddy is a pretty demanding Killer graphics-wise. 
---
There might‚Äôve also been some connection issues on his end. 
---
When you say rank 4, do you mean you are at rank 4 or was the Freddy at rank 4? You might have just gotten matched with a lower rank Killer.
---
Yea I‚Äôve been getting shit on for this lol
---
Bullshit. You didn't delete every comment you made in this thread, just the ones heavily downvoted where people called you out.
---
You're a fucking coward. You try to dictate how other people play, throw a tantrum and DC when they don't do what you want, and then bitch about it. You're a entitled, hypocritical crybaby and a coward to boot.
---
At least be a fucking man and own up to it instead of skulking off after deleting your posts and pretending it never happened.
---
And it doesn't fucking matter if you're a killer main. I'm a survivor main and I'm defending killers from jackasses like you who seem to think you can dictate how they play. You're still the one trying to tell other people what they can and cannot do within the mechanics of the game.
---
They hated him because he told the truth.
---
People complain about spirit? It's way more awful playing against ghost face with that zero TR. Hell it's worse playing with morons running around doing nothing
---
alright im fucking done with you dude.
---
that title XD
---
I just started playing this game not too long ago. There‚Äôs some games where I get 3-4 gens all by myself, a few rescues, but somehow get 3rd-4th place in points. Why is that? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.
---
Demogorgon is better he destroy dignity so much that we can't even ear survivor screaming inside his head
---
demo is like billy hag and a bit of ghostface if you use his stealth right. he is a weird mix
---
Lots of questions about cross play oh boy I‚Äôm starting to get excited
---
I find it useful just for getting around. On maps with lots of low cover you're not gonna be seen easily, especially with Nea in dark green clothes. It's the same speed as walking but less visible. I could of course use a different perk in its place, but often I have that one perk on that doesn't see much use, like Adrenaline when the gates don't get powered for 5 consecutive games
---
I do like the audio cue perks like Spine Chill and Small Game when using headphones, might give SC a try
---
STRAIGHT FACTS
---
4 remove her ability to phase walk 
---
5 remover her ability to win matches
---
YES
---
He anticipated a vault at the same time you did.
---
no those are fine. i think you are trying to say this would ruin her but i dont see how
---
HARD disagree. Spirit &gt; Freddy any day.
---
good man
---
I know he wasn‚Äôt he good, that‚Äôs why all I said was that he was boring to play against. It took literally 0 skill for a Legion player to run at people and in Frenzy and just stab them til they went down, and the survivor he was chasing had no chance to counterplay. At that point I might as well just be playing a robot.
---
I can take a DS and still get a 4K which is why I‚Äôm still high rank killer but thanks for your info. I don‚Äôt care too much for slugging and will only do it when I see fit. I can decide what‚Äôs right for my gameplay, teabagging is 100% different and does nothing except for taunt the other player. I didn‚Äôt come here to get advice on what you think is a good killer, I came here to express that you‚Äôre an asshole if you wait at the gate to teabag when you could just leave. You can join those assholes since you seem to be super upset about my opinion.
---
That's understandable but when in a discussion, it's best to keep a respectful standpoint throughout, even if your opponent is wrong.
---
You too
---
so it is a wig confirmed??? /s
---
Hail, mustard!
---
i main doc a lot and i think this isn't too bad a map
---
you can't shock as many people, yeah, but your terror radius madness is incredibly reliable
---
Ash mains
---
Nice. Dead zone on controllers screw me I wish there was a way to minimize it
---
He's toxic and gets mad when he starts losing just like any other killer main.
---
Im quite dissapointed that one of the answers for not likely to continue playing are bugs and/or unaswered bug tickets.
---
Also I‚Äôm not upset about the DS stun, I just think it‚Äôs rude to teabag after it like oh wow you hit a skill check!
---
I keep seeing this character on this sub where is it from?
---
Hazbin Hotel pilot episode on YouTube
---
Except they buffed borrowed time, and DS.
---
Nerfed enduring so that it doesnt interact with DS at all.
---
You can tell DS is better now because EVERYONE runs it.
---
If DS was nerfed, nobody would run it. Same with borrowed time.
---
Can we please get the Robert Englund Freddy someday?
---
Better together is actually an amazingly underrated perk, try to swap maybe fixated out for it.
---
The ankle stab hurts me on a spiritual level so yes, you are correct
---
&gt; does seem plausible that we would get her father as a survivor.
---
I like where your head's at. My only question: where would the "missing Katana" come into play?
---
Unpopular opinion: Wraith's is okay and Billy's is (worse than Leatherface's, but still) pretty good.
---
Haha rape jokes. So funny.
---
Who the fuck gave this a silver
---
Might go for that, but do you lose anything when you prestige?
---
Would be nice, can i ask the yt channel that explores malls?
---
Poor legion I wish I wish upon a magic fish that he would be slightly better
---
Mmm yes Legion Mending very annoying.
---
Pig traps, Doctor madness, Freddy sleeping very fun. But Legion make me hold Mouse 1 instead of holding Mouse 1, so Legion bad.
---
The Killer is making my life difficult. It's almost like it's their job to try to kill me smh.
---
Great shot!
---
As a console player I'd love to be able to play against the other consoles, the but the thought of playing against people on PC terrifies me. Not only do you guys have much better FPS and graphical stability, but the mouse and keyboard controls are so much better. 
---
So unless BHVR somehow give some kind of buff to the console controls when versing PC players then I kinda hope console/PC crossplay never happens. Would love console crossplay though.
---
Oh shit, it's David King.
---
Plague
---
Mind changed
---
I am not saying its impossible to win with Legion. Just saying hes not nearly as good as other killers.
---
Not entirely sure. Could be like what op said about rin's mom.
---
Was going to downvote until you agreed that "say gibberish and then puke" is a bad Mori.
---
totally agree with giving her a vault animation. No reason she shouldn't have one.
---
Right. Nobody who has thrown 100s of hours at a game like Silent Hill is going to be scared of it. Exposure takes the edge off of things. Dbd rewards you for not being afraid as well. If you hop off a gen and hide in a closet because the killer might be nearby, or if you panic during a chase, you're not going to perform well in the game.
---
Personally I feel like it was a teaser at the next rift spirits lore is awesome
---
Freddy was
---
Billy's chainsaw can fairly easily be juked/baited and last I checked he's far from garbage tier. A Killer doesn't have to be stupidly OP in order to *not* be garbage. There is, in fact, a middle ground.

I'm rank 2, but that's just because I put the time into the game between resets. I  simply am saying I have found killer really boring to play lately because it's the same stuff over and over, and both sides are affected by how boring it is.
---
Recently I stopped caring about rank because it literally is only a red number by my name, and I've just been trying random builds and getting better at killers I hardly play. My goal is to have fun now, not get to red ranks as fast as possible where it's stale as hell.
---
As for your other question, the Ruin and Pop combo is always pretty oppressive (and quite boring), but really strong. Pop works great with Tremors for information of which gen is currently getting touched. Then obviously stacking things like Dying Light and Sloppy Butcher just continue to snowball into making the game last 20+ minutes.

Now now, we don't want to out do the doctor in terms of fear
---
Two channels do this that I follow: ‚ÄúThis is Dan Bell‚Äù he does other videos, but you can find a ‚Äúdead mall playlist‚Äù on his channel. And another is ‚ÄúRetail Archeology‚Äù. There are a few more you can find. The dead mall in my area is called Collin Creek Mall in Plano Texas. You can find some cool videos on that one. Its more 90‚Äôs tho.
---
My suggestion has always been make noed a base killer skill. The reason people hate noed it because it‚Äôs unexpected. But, if every killer ALWAYS has it, then if survs don‚Äôt cleanse totems and just do gens, they‚Äôre gonna pay for it. Slows down the game without just making gens take longer.
---
You can see Ghostface too
---
This joke is underrated
---
It‚Äôs a Claudette P3 what did you expect you are literally a wraith on steroids
---
I play both, not at all, they play really differently
---
Leatherface
---
Can we not promote infighting? Whether you think someone has a dumb opinion or not, trying to shame them by promoting it is just juvenile.
---
I've been using Spine Chill for quite some time now and not a single killer moonwalked to counter my SC yet
---
Quentin Jake and Steve for me
