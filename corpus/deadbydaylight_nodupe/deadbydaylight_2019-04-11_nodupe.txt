It's absolutely MoM that's the problem.
---

---
The game has always been a buggy mess, but for those two weeks between Plague and Ash we had an **almost balanced** buggy mess.
---
Sure, there were/are major issues...
---
* Matchmaking takes ages.
---
* Survivors crash a ton.
---
* Legion infinite mend.
---
* Head On and Dead Hard don't work all of the time.
---
* Multiple killers (how the fuck they made that happen I don't know)
---
...but those weren't something that hit you every single game.
---
It took a while, but when you **did** get a match that wasn't marred by some kind of bug, it was usually a good game.
---
Now with MoM we have DS 2.0.
---
The bugs will be fixed soon enough, since we know that the devs are working to fix those, but we've all seen how long it takes these devs to make balance decisions.
---
MoM will be broken long after this current wave of buffs is finished, and until it's nerfed (**without a third extra life being introduced**) it will singlehandedly ruin games in the same way DS did.
---
---
---
Tru3 is actually a damn good survivor and especially as a looper but he is bad when it comes to juking. Above average survivor though who yes does gens even through ruin :)
---
Ew, she laying on the infected titty. ü§¢
---
YES! YTMND was amazing.
---
I only use Deliverance to counter Monstrous shrine
---
Fucking love this meme, thanks for the laugh OP
---
Last time we got something good was devour hope. Thanks for that at least
---
There is absolutely no need to slow anything down.
---
Part of me wants to say that killers are already heavily punished by the pipping system for camping because currently it is that way. But you are right. Pipping and ranked aside, this wouldn‚Äôt be fun for the survivors. Secondary objectives would be much better for the game, but this is just an idea that they could implement now to benefit the game. At the end of the day however, having fun on both the killer and survivor side is the most important thing.
---
I played a lot of other games and got bored of all of them, only play dbd because I'm bored and have nothing better to do
---
It‚Äôs a bug
---
Claudette behind you!
---
Oh no, shes wearing air pods! She cant hear us!
---
That's when your soul jumps right out
---
It‚Äôs a big
---
I think they just wanted a quick fix for queue times. It's a lot worse for killers on high ranks so letting a few more survivors up there might help.
---
Bug*
---
&gt;Basically, if you're not running an obsession perk as killer (STBFL, Dying Light, etc), you get a penalty for only hitting one survivor.
---
That's stupid tho, why would you force the killer not to attack specific players?
---
HONESTLY I WAS HAVING THAT SAME EXACT GODDAMN PROBLEM UNTIL RANGOR WENT ON THE SHRINE. NOW I HAVE TO TUNNEL THE OBSESSION AND FEEL SHITTY ABOUT IT. THANKS BHVR
---
u are probably right
---
unpopular opinion: NURSE IS NOT STRONG, SHE IS BROKEN
---
I play a lot of killer and it helps me feel better when I just attribute it to the adrenaline rush of playing Survivor.
---
Playing survivor is kinda scary for me so I can understand feeling kinda cheeky when you make a good juke.
---
Well, that's because obligating your opponent to give your teammates a turn on the hook before they sacrifice your precious snowflake ass is the height of entitlement.
---
bloodpoints tho
---
You're saying teammates would rather do a gen (the only objective to win the match) than waste time healing you, while you're crouching(not doing anything to progress the game).  Just hop on the gen and bang it out, then heal if you're that worried about being injured.  You can't win the match by healing, you can only win the match by doing generators.  I have family that I play SWF with and she has this mindset to heal the second she is injured, and we lose everytime I play with her, because I end up doing gens while she self-cares for 5 minutes out the match in the corner.  Then waits for the hatch to spawn.
---
I'm not saying it's not good to heal.  I'm just saying when you prioritize healing over the objective, you will lose more times than not.
---
I disagree with the time limit. I also disagree with the strength of the perk at 50%. I would argue for a 15/30/45 % chance. For balance, maybe add a requirement that the pallet be in the TR.
---
Why is this better than anything we‚Äôve gotten so far? And when can they start developing this?
---
[removed]
---
WEE WOO WOO WEE WOO WOO WEE WEE
---
DOWNVOTED FOR NOT YELLING YOUR OPINION ON RAGE WEDNESDAY
---
You've got to stay on gens for about 180 seconds to get gold I think
---
We can dream
---
I know how far it gets you. I think it's cool to have a mill that all.
---
And this is why this game rocks.
---
You‚Äôre downplaying your previous comments to try and appear like you‚Äôre right. As said before, cya.
---
Yeah the movement speed decrease really does hurt you outside of Lerys, which is why I put it a bit lower.
---
He is pretty good but he‚Äôs mostly fucking annoying, very rarely will he admit he made a mistake and whenever he does go up against a well coordinated team he gets completely shit on. I used to watch his twitch but got bored of him always complaining about things being broken or talking about how smart he is.
---
Still not half as good as ZubatLeL
---
I've seen it too
---
I rarely use it now. I might start back to give myself a fighting chance lol.
---
The grasp escape with DS is indeed still not instant. While the killer cannot drop you during this period because BHVR have introduced a delay on being able to drop a survivor with the same patch (this also to counter an exploit where a killer spamming the "drop survivor" command would prevent flashlight or pallet saves, due to the fact that the killer's inputs have a flat latency advantage over any survivor inputs), it would not be surprising if they can still spam space and hook the survivor, if they are in hooking prompt range.
---
That time window might be caused by latency, or by the skill check duration.
---
I just searched it and don't worry, dead by daylight is one of the games that have been confirmed to not get affected by name changing
---
I hope
---
IM TIRED OF EVERY GAME I AY BEING SWEATY SWF BUILDS. PS4 HAS A REAL PROBLEM IN THE MID RANKS FOR KILLERS HAVING TO GO AGAINST SWF ON COMMS PLAYING AT A LOWER RANK THAN THEY SHOULD OR TEAMING WITH FRIENDS TO GET LOWER RANK KILLERS.
---
That‚Äôs my boyyyyy
---
I don't think it's bad Idea but it is a little OP. I'd have it so if you take a hit by the killer whilst they are carrying another survivor, the closest hook breaks for 30/45/60 seconds.
---
So what is going on now?
---
We can change our psn usernames? Or is this just for dbd?
---
Literally every post-game chat where I'm the killer I tell people "Take care in the fog" before returning to the menu, even when I get nasty comments from people who acted legitimately horrible the entire game while I was just trying to have some fun.
---
I just wanna chase people and be spooky, man...
---
They should boost bp gains or lower web cost now...
---
We have so many dlcs now that the grind is becoming very very heavy, more than it needs to be
---
Og pic?
---
Devour Hope is as far from crutch as it gets. You're banking on keeping your totem up long enough. Dude is just mad.
---
The rule is that any perk that contributed to your loss is a crutch. So I'm sorry but he's right.
---
So the self care situation is a lot more complicated than you‚Äôre making it. 
---
Here‚Äôs a hypothetical: two survivors are next to a generator, one injured and one healed. There are three options for progressing (assuming the killer is preoccupied and doesn‚Äôt come to your gen for a little bit)
---
1) your teammate heals you and you both do the gen. 
---
2) you heal yourself and your teammate does the gen. 
---
3) you both do the gen and don‚Äôt heal. 
---
In this situation, the ‚Äúbest order‚Äù in terms of gen completion is 3&gt;2&gt;1. Since two survivors working on a generator repair it at 0.9x normal speed each, then it‚Äôs technically more efficient to heal yourself while your teammate does the gen. SC has a 50% efficiency, meaning it takes twice as long to heal as having a teammate heal you. So if time in this case isnt the issue, then why do pros/streamers say it‚Äôs bad?
---
Because in terms of gen completion, not healing is just leagues better. That‚Äôs why SC is worse now - because healing isn‚Äôt worth it since it‚Äôs slower. Just do gens and get adrenaline if it‚Äôs late enough in the game. 
---
With the above example, healing a teammate is only better than that teammate healing themselves if short term time is a higher priority than long term time (killer not in chase, for example, might find you too soon to SC). 
---
SC is definitely no where near as strong as it used to be, but it‚Äôs hard to argue that you‚Äôre being a bad teammate by running it if you look at the numbers and consider most people who use it solo queue
---
devour hope... a crutch perk? 
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
---
No....
---
I'm fine with 1 person running it but more than that it becomes really annoying
---
Sony announced that you can change your PSN name, DBD is on the list of games that have no known issues upon switching your PSN ID.
---
I don't understand your anger mate, honestly. Relax.
---
Played nurse a fair amount at rank 12 without ever knowing the fatigue timer increases on the amount of blinks you use plus if you swing it adds a lot too. Made myself look so stupid for swinging that much
---
Oh ok
---
That‚Äôs cool, but I think I‚Äôll stick to ole blobfish
---
Why is paint thinner lower than prototype claws?
---
Omg this is amazing, well done
---
Just so you know if you continued these, either with just the Clown, or changing it up, I would read 10/10
---
Great job! Would love to see Ace and/or Tapp!
---
Or you‚Äôll die because you didn‚Äôt heal. There is no absolute. It is a TEAM effort to help your TEAM so your TEAM can do shit more effectively, which means you healing your TEAM is an investment in them and can triple the length of a chase, letting you get 3 gens done.
---
Also, the fact that your friend has to bring Self Care in a full SWF is really, really sad. Maybe you should heal her, but what do I know right? Gotta get those gens done, a-hyuck. üòí
---
atack
---
Idk, I haven't seen any problems with killer pipping.  Maybe don't tunnel and patrol the hook so much.
---
Well I did say PS4. And regardless, this thread doesn‚Äôt involve you if it‚Äôs perfection right? ;)
---
Dammit, now I have to uninstall.
---
There is, most of the community are indeed toxic but there are a lot of really nice people. I met a lot of nice and funny survivors and killers, and I always try to be super nice myself, you know the whole "be the change you want to see"
---
They fed you an easy 4K. All 4 of them should not have been around you especially after the first two went down.
---
I WANT OLD KATE BACK, ON GOD SHE SOUNDS BORED NOW
---
This is a repost of the exact same meme posted 16 hours ago. That one only got 11 points. 
---
Fair and balanced.
---
Oh yea for sure Ace next! Ace mains=big brains
---
ANYONE ELSE ***FUCKING LIVID*** ABOUT THE DS NERF ? LAURIE IS GODDAMN USELESS NOW. **HER PERKS ARE JUST A SHIT AS QUENTINS.** ALSO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS NEW RANKING SYSTEM? 30K POINTS AND I STILL DON'T PIP.
---
Or mabey he could see surviors auras moving in his terror radius but cannot see see surviours while using his power.
---
The majestic pigeon would *never* intentionally commit suicide on the first hook.
---
Partially because they have no idea how to play the game and wouldn't know what button to press. But mostly because they have *principles*.
---
same...lol
---
Because 3.14. That's why.
---
All I did was put her beauty on paper üò© thank you my dude
---
I believe bhvr balances female survivors by giving them a small size and giving them a loud injured noise and vice versa with Male characters but the recent survivors don‚Äôt seem to be following this trend and seem generally louder.
---
I can see why you say that. And I respect it
---
Finally, a counter to the most broken perk ever
---
Then he nodded like "yep, I'm trash".
---
Gonna have to when your useless ass doesn‚Äôt heal me, cuz those gens are just temptin you sumthin awful‚Äô. Useless gen jockey.
---
Love the two treasure perks! They're fresh and just the right amount of power to them. The first line of Forbidden Treasure had me worried but I think it's a great idea.
---
Yes that reduced fall reduction saves your life more often than not. I stopped using balanced landing because of how broken it was (not procing at all and then procing at the tiniest step down a hill). However I‚Äôve had some pretty bad games and literally haven‚Äôt been able to stay up nearly as long without it. As soon as I put it back on, my games improved and was able to stay up longer in chases (or even get away).
---
Jake in my opinion is one of the loudest out of all the other survivors, [change my mind](https://youtu.be/E9PYgtlZHhs)
---
What
---
Devour Hope is not a crutch perk because it relies heavily on the crappy totem RNG. Those Survivors just got salty that they made a dumb mistake like staying near a Killer with Devour Hope active.

Who cares what they said?
---
I've come across a few good Nurses on PS4. I usually get really excited because I NEVER see people play her :) After the match, even if they were bad, I always make sure to send them a nice message and thank them for trying the hardest killer to play on console :)
---
Yeah definitely
---
Ty
---
It can it just depends on bhvr wanting to add a killer from the future.
---
No.. guys instead of killing survivors... turn them into wendigo... after everyone has turned it‚Äôs a free for all....
---
Don‚Äôt play Legion then lol
---
Survivors complain about killers being toxic and vice versa.
---
This game is toxic, end game try hard players get bored and find it‚Äôs the only enjoyable way to play in this endlessly repetitive RuSh we all sink countless hours into.
---
We‚Äôre all just a little toxic but scared to admit it.
---
OOPS MY BAD GUESS ILL THROW ON MONSTEROUS SHRINE THEN
---
HAG WAS THE SECOND KILLER I LEVELED UP BECAUSE I WANTED RUIN. HAVE NOT LEVELED HER SINCE THEN. IF YOU THINK I HAVE A DECENT PERK SELECTION YOURE OUTTA YOUR MIND CHIEF.
---
HEY GUYS I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE CLEMENTINE FROM THE WALKING DEAD IN THE DEAD BY DAYLIGHT, HERE'S SOME FAN ART I DIDN'T DRAW. UPVOTES PLEASE
---
I main Legion and have put 20 million bp into them...so fuck no?...
---
Joke aside, this TV show is awesome and an esthetic master pice. Give it a try!
---
Also fuck Legion(the dbd version)
---
I'm illiterate. Yeeet
---
WHEN IT COMES TO RUIN I LITERALLY SAY ‚ÄúDO YOUR BEST, ITLL BE BETTER THAN DOING NOTHING‚Äù. I STILL CANT CONVINCE MY FRIEND TO NOT CONSISTENTLY LOOK FOR RUIN
---
I‚Äôll check out the show. And yes F*** Legion.
---
Paint thinner should have been C, with Prototype being D. Black Box is terrible as it is can only be used with one strat, and yeah the obsession can be woken up super easily.
---
Drive a katana through your system
---
LMAO or when another person comes and they fuck it up RIGHT before its finished and just runs away.
---
Sometimes after being tunneled and face camped game after game, some people just say fuck this and DC. Everyone has their breaking point on this game lol
---
All these are good, except the pallet perk
---
Yes the 6 minute mend timer is something the vastly underpowered legion needed.
---
You're right, you caught us. We were all trying to trick you, have fun with insidious Freddy!
---
This is awsome. Each perk is unique and well thought out. I especialy love the forbidden treasure perk.
---
Yep. Lee is also better because he is very evidently like 30. Clem seems like a sketchy choice at best.

---
WELL I GUESS WE NEED TO GO TAKE A SENSITIVITY CLASS THEN!
---
I think they run those perks because they're simply the best
---
I wouldn't mind and would love for Clem to be a survivor! I would be hard for me to see her get hooked over and over but she's still a fun character.
---
Just because you couldn't get into the later seasons doesn't mean that the entire series doesn't revolve around Clementine.
---
With a long power range, freddy can hold M2 all the time and sweep his crosshair back and forth. Between accidentally catching hiding survivors with sweeps and long distance tagging survivors who ran at the lullaby but are still in your range anyway, Freddy is actually a **nightmare** to play without increased range.
---
Looks like we found ourselves a Freddy main here.
---
Yes they really are
---
Imagine this with all of the current killers and perks.
---
As all things should be
---
Lmfao! This is excellent
---
^
---
Why can't I get glitches like these
---
Nice escape!
---
Thank you for that description lmao
---
I think this is pretty good.
---
Ruin would need to be adjusted, but it would make the game a little more balanced and less frustrating.
---
Also I've always thought that the one thing they could nerf on Billy to make him a little more fair was his cooldown. With good addons, he's basically punished less for whiffing a saw than whiffing an M1, and can use his saw to easily catch up any time he fucks up and loses tons of distance.
---
Less range on Nurse is a good one, she's fairly forgiving to play because her range is far enough to get you a hit even if you miss the first blink by a bit. Would make it tougher to be so dominant by demanding much more precise play.
---
I think pure killer mains/survivor mains should have opposite day, where they play the other side and what it's like. That would be funny, a streamer queuing into a Hillbilly match to find themselves as one of the survivors.
---
I really wish they would fix the bugs with Legion specifically cause he isn't all that broken without them, at least not more than say Nurse. I've went back to playing Huntress because just seeing a Legion makes people leave, even if you aren't running shit on him.
---
I know what they are.
---
Idk how this would play out but this is fucking dope idea
---
They'd probably make Sam the Survivor and Josh the killer tbh but Chris is one of the more popular characters and my favorite so I'd still hope for Chris, or at least a cosmetic for my Dwight from Chris like a jacket.
---
To only defend BHVR a little they aren't as slow or as deep of problems that say Overwatch has so I can't really hate them for it. 
---
Still shit though.
---
No what‚Äôs ruining the game are petty asshole killers abusing a pretty bad exploit glitch, that gives you almost infinite mending! If BhVR would block the double blade add on it would solve the problem until they can fix it. But we all know BhVR couldn‚Äôt work there way out of a paper bag with arrows pointing the way!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt abuse this like you are.
---
Hell no. Imagine haddonfield lol
---
that‚Äôs why
---
Lol I think political correctness has just gotten to be too much. Darker skin obviously works well in dark maps. All about contrast. Only an asshole could be offended by that. It's just a matter of fact
---
oh
---
The snow map has always reminded me of Until Dawn.
---
I mean my app crashed like two games later and I had my rank back so it‚Äôs fine now I guess but yeah it wasn‚Äôt very fun
---
Can‚Äôt do much about a camper who waits out I frames
---
Acting + iron will would be pretty decent ngl
---
Same that way I can earn how ever much I need to prestige the survivor I'm working on at least once.
---
MY APOLOGIES THIS SHOULD FIX IT
---
In terms of voice acting meg has an outstanding voice. Though kate's volume will always be the loudest
---
THAT MAY BE THE CASE, IT WAS GOOD TO COME TO AN UNDERSTANDING WITH YOU.
---
i have the big hat dweard and mustache jake
---
It‚Äôs real good
---
But where thicc?
---
I got infinite Legion power once... wow it was fun
---
I love it! Amazing job, I'd love to see more in the future! :D
---
Had an idea for a futuristic killer in the past can't remember where I posted it though
---
Guys too...
---
It‚Äôs not ruining the fun... I‚Äôm not saying just be buddies and farm together
---
I‚Äôm saying take it easy for a damn game...
---
Why do you need to rush through the trial anyway? How is that fun in general?
---
Thirst is unisex.
---
EMILY AS THE SURVIVOR
---
Bloody Party Streamers are cursed :(
---
All I see here are some survivors who don't know what they're doing and blame their loss on your perks instead of their lack of skill.
---
My games, but im the only dead one
---
Pyramid Head as the killer.
---
no but its patched now so it doesnt matter
---
From the future seems that I  correctly guessed one of the new killers perks since she has one that tells you where a survivor is when they get downed
---
I like this
---
Take my upvote
---
'Bout to start posting vomit fetish in there now.
---
Thanks a lot
---
Legion is basically non licensed Ghost face
---
Kinda like how Billy is non licensed leatherface
---
The plague kind of just sucks to be honest, being able to heal to full health at fountains makes her trash, but not being able to heal at fountains makes her too good.
---
Also she has no real way to end chases, other than m1.
---
Jake has a cowboy hat at least.
---
Legion is pretty good
---
What build do you usually use for legion
---
What is the bug like i know its infinite mend but whats actually the bug
---
Legion is way more broken
---
Because the future isn't a time period. Nothing has happened yet and there is no way to get to the future from the current time period we're in now.
---
Bruh, everyone wants Clem to die over and over again, in pain? Didnt we spend 7 years and 4 seasons to prevent that? Fuck guys, let the girl have her happy ending she's been through enough, if you want a Walking Dead game survivor go with Lee since it would fit him to help others escape and hes already dead so it wouldn't matter what happened to him, since he basically gets a second chance at life from the Entity.
---
Class Photo is ridiculously good. Would bring him up a tier if it was vuilt into his kit
---
The only thing really broken about them is the add-on that stacks mends. That and the moonwalking.
---
...*who da fuq is that?*
---
It'll be extra work for them to do
---
Honestly, I'm a little peeved by the ending of the Final Season. She spent nearly as much time as Lee but the ending was what it was. 
---
I'd like Lee or Clem for DbD though. Finally, all of those times I chose to stay silent pulled through
---
Survivor would likely be Sam or Mike, most likely Sam as female survivors are so hot right now.
---
If they go the path of ‚Äòlesser‚Äô characters like most DLC have other than Halloween we‚Äôd probably end up with Emily and fantastic perks such as;
---
‚ÄúUnderstand the palm of my hand bitch‚Äù
---
Your wrath in the face of danger knows no bounds, once per match when the killer is about to knock you down pass a skill check to transfer the damage to another survivor and heal yourself in the process

---
What makes the Yellow dress better than the Green Dress, and what does the drawing next to it do? Also I agree with Class Photo being S-tier, used it once and was getting so much pressure with it.
---
I was really hoping Jane would be one
---
Their names had "txc" in them.
---
I'll only be satisfied if they give him Scratched Mirror aura reading at all times. Legit it's only fair
---
Its scary how much your comment sounds like people in this sub lol.
---
You're sure making it sound like they're not
---
It's also incredibly small and really hard to run away on.
---
Nurse doesn't need to cancel blinks, just make good predictions and stay on the bottom floor when you can.
---
Spirit you can just track scratch marks, most of the pallets are pretty far apart anyways.
---
Yes. I can never trust a Meg
---
How about after more than 3 hits against the same survivor, instead of losing points, that survivor gets something like invincibility for the hit, a speed boost, and the killer has to go thru the animations still?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
...wait
---
Everything seems alright until I looked at the bottom left, noticed the amount of survivors, and then the generator account. Then I was like oh. Well then.
---
On Lery's in can either be in the Library, or the centre with the 2nd story.
---
Ok I'll hold your hand.
---
Nurse and Legion need a rework.

You‚Äôre right, library totally skipped my mind
---
THE FUCKING BLOOD POINT CAP NEEDS TO BE RAISED, IT'S NOT FUN TO GRIND SO MUCH WHEN NEW SHIT COMES OUT. IF NOT THAT, THE DEVS NEED TO AT LEAST NEED TO DO BLOOD RUSH EVENTS WAY MORE OFTEN FOR FUCKS SAKE
---
**THIS.**
---
I'm a survivor main transitioning into a survivor/killer player and holy crap the pain I endure when playing as killer makes me want to rip out my hair or even cry. I sometimes cannot deal with it but dammit its such a fun role!
---
They are, but the difference there is that The Cannibal is a licenced IP, so they created a copyright friendly version of him  in Billy and got the licencing later on.  If they had the licence to begin with, we probably wouldn't have both of them.
---
Wendigo is not a licenced IP, so both versions are the creators interpretation of that creature.
---
I wish Hoffman some how survived, like he always does :(.
---
But urban evasion is toxic
---
That 740 might be me... The queues were so long I forgot I was even playing
---
I dunno man, seems pretty toxic to call me toxic
---
I mean, legion is my favorite killer honestly
---
I mean, his sisters in the prelude
---
claudette main detected
---
More like when you‚Äôve been in a queue time longer than 10 minutes
---
The guy got found instantly and then suicided on the hook. Zzz.
---
Nurse is absolutely fine, she can easily be countered, Legion? Want to make it to a pallet? Nope he'll jump over it. Loop? Nope, dosen't matter. Want to do literally anything? Moonwalk.
---
Nurse? Dead hard, Iron Will, tires, 360's, MoM when it's fixed.
---
Nurse is good, not broken
---
It's not a bug it's the new 3v2 mode that got added
---
Nice username, btw.
---
I really don't feel like enough survivor mains play killer, lol. Saving this post, this is top tier.
---
I would love if they had an OG dbd gamemode
---
&gt;somewhat increased rarity in blood webs
---
it should be known that people have done comparisons on non prestige bloodwebs vs p3 bloodwebs and the "higher rarity" for P3 is pathetic and barely noticeable.
---
Idk. I just thought more people would enjoy Clem
---
Yeah, with me, I tea-bag to get the Killer away from my friends. The other times are when I get tunneled all round but manage to get to the exit gate. I'll definitely tea-bag out of spite. If I tea-bag, I usually have a reason. However, I try not to be to toxic.
---
Give me Janes. I feel as though hers would be really dumb.
---
Yes it has, it was back in July / August of 2018. Still, not a bad idea and way more balanced than the Spirit with her ridiculous OP meme add-ons.
---
I think you replied to the wrong person.
---
Ah shit here we go again
---
Stealth is the most boring way to play the game as a survivor.
---
wait PSN will finally let us change our names??? is it free? oh my god finally I made my account when I was like 13 and the name screams it... :(
---
Are you stupid? Yeah legion can vault over the pallet but nurse can completely blink past it. And she doesn't even need to you 4 times to down you.
---
They refuse to accept defeat, they will always strive for victory
---
honestly he has the best P3 it's really cool looking
---
Her lunge range **after** blinking is definitely longer than other killers.
---
All killers don‚Äôt have the same lunge range lol. So, that kinda shows what you know. Regardless her melee hits that land are by far the most questionable out of all killers.
---
Yikes. Personally I would rather take a Legion than a Nurse any day.
---
I laughed wayyyyyy too hard at this
---
Truer words have never been said.
---
I love this!! I think the big irises make her look cute and stylized. I hope you post more art!!!
---
It works both ways. Survivors job is to escape.  So doing generators, looping killers, using pallets and flashlights as well as body blocking and SWF is all legit.
---
Both sides whine way too much. And equally so.
---
Depends. I think I'd spare the one in the mask and mercilessly slaughter the rest.
---
That would make swfs unstopable
---
AT THAT GUY WHO SENT ME 15 (15!!!!!!!!!!!) FUCKING VOICE MESSAGES ON XBOX AFTER I KILLED YOUR WHOLE TEAM, TELLING ME I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU LIVE AND CHEAT BECAUSE I COST YOU PIPS.
---
I WAS THE KILLER, AND I FUCKING KILLED YOU.
---
YOU SUCK.
---
DO BETTER.
---
DON'T FUCKING DC WHEN YOU MAKE ONE GODDAMN MISTAKE/GET OUTPLAYED ONCE IT MAKES YOU LOOK LIKE A LITTLE BITCH AND IT SCREWS OVER EVERYONE ELSE
---
Is it better on X than L1? Just started playing survivor recently on PS4, rank 12 rn and usually good enough at skill checks but not fantastic at hitting ‚Äògreats‚Äô
---
Or they don't feel like stressing out. There is a person behind that hooking psycho.
---
You can‚Äôt get banned for that, but if you do something else that gets you in trouble and your files are changed then you won‚Äôt get any mercy
---
Just a theory. But I‚Äôm happy you liked it.
---
Well where I live, I tend to run into the same people in my games at higher ranks so I know they have brains. And also I‚Äôm very good at running a killer around so as long as people do gens (and don‚Äôt go and hide as soon as they even hear a terror radius -.-) then it‚Äôs good for me. If you are a solo player that mostly does gens and you‚Äôre altruistic well shit that probably isn‚Äôt fun.
---
This video is now rated 10/10 broken-ass hitboxes.
---
&gt; Saboteur
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Not sure, but at the moment it has really no reason to be ran since it doesn't impact the game in a meaningful way without wasting a stupid amount of time.
---
An idea I've always had for Sabo:
---
Doesn't break hooks anymore. Saboing a hook is much faster and instead just "weakens" the hook. People put on a sabo'd hook are sacrificed MUCH more slowly and/or have a 100% chance to kobe. After the person is rescued, the hook breaks and when it respawns it will be non-weakened.
---
Saboing hooks is a huge time sink so I really think it slowing down sacrifice progression would be a good idea. Spend a little time now to have extra time to finish a generator instead of rushing for the hook save asap.
---
What a sweetheart
---
lol i main survivior. Like heavily, and i still laugh when I read this. If you're not applying pressure, what else should they do?
---
&gt; VERY easy to turn into FaceCamp McFuckoff after a couple of SWF games in a row. 
---
This. The thing is my killer code is to never ever camp. Always run off to look for other survivors after I've done a hook and very rarely do I immediately go back after an unhook (only when its been a silly early unhook tho).
---
I patrolled around an area after I made a hook when the exit gates where powered but I still lost them,(I was patrolling the area in large,not just 4 metres from the hook). 
---
But at times I just wanted to face camp the fuck out of them,and hit them whilst theyre on the hook but I always go off to look for other survivors because in the end,I just want to make the game interesting for them. I'm still rank 18 practicing my Billy and I'm getting better and better but damn the facecamping ways sure do call for me at times.
---
Wait are you in the Oceania area? Cause I have a Steam Friend who uses that name...
---
Haha. Maybe Survivors are more redeemable than I thought.
---
I've almost got Blood Warden. Pretty soon it'll be time to nip that shit in the bud.
---
I  like to play Legion every few matches an just chase people an stab them but never hook em, always dropping people off at doors and hatches etc.
---
This way, with all the Legion hate, I can prove there's at least 1 nice Legion out there to play against
---
You... actually get it. By God, you actually get it.
---
It doesn't work after a blink, it's bugged right now
---
in the trials, there's simply no time      
---
at the campfire, I'm sure they socialize as much as they brood
---
Thank you, very cool.
---
I just saw the post,I expected worse but that one salty baby legion main really got roasted by the two of you
---
Haha he's like "I'll take care of this gen for you if you need to go for a toilet break or something"
---
But it‚Äôs the safest and most effective way.
---
Dodging is for cowards
---
Is BHVR paying Netflix to convince us Legion isnt that bad? 
---
*Well they wasted their damn money.*
---
Second hand cringe
---
The nurses max potential is broken.  If anyonesay she isn't they haven't played a talented nurse. However, Legion is worse in my opinion because a monkey can play legion well and nurse has at least some counterplay.
---
Your cousin/brothers from Identity V is having the same problem
---
3 Gen Strat. I‚Äôve started doing it more recently as Hag and surprisingly it works. Just pick 3 Gens that are close together/easily heard and *guard them with your life.*
---
There‚Äôs nothing more aggravating than chasing someone as a Killer, and hearing *ding! ding!* as 2-3 Gens pop off. It‚Äôs not always the end of the game though, depending on what area you were patrolling the most. If they are too spaced apart you‚Äôll most likely get rushed again.
---
Stressing out? It‚Äôs either you have fun or admit defeat as killer.
---
Still need to get the Dwight and jake masks, tho.
---
Yes, I changed mine! I had the same issue lol I hated my old gamer tag
---
why hahaha? WHY?! the misery(of getting looped). Theres also no skill ceiling with him. Like you could play him for 500 hours and it wouldnt matter. Main a killer that shows skill. Like nurse or huntress or something. Leather face? YUCK
---
The thing I hate the most is smug dumb survivors who teabag or do dumb stuff after minor "victories" early in a chase. Today I went against a David who would teabag every time he vaulted... anything. He was trying to taunt me at every turn and then dced immediately he got slugged.
---
YES EXACTLY! It's horrible!!
---
Recently they had Self-Care,which is #1 survivor perk in the general publics opinion. (Many people on this subreddit think its just a time waster but honestly if youre playing solo ignore them and run Self-Care,its much more viable).
---
Pressure more. If youre getting looped or facing a really good survivor just leave them. Chances are the others aren't as good. And you can get them later when they go for an unhook or something and put themselves in a bad position.
---
Yeah I agree, I give up sometimes.. :/
---
Then you realize they were trying to farm you but they are just bad.
---
Fun fact: contrary to popular belief the survivors are not a team and you are not responsible for anyone‚Äôs survival but your own 
---
But yeah, that dude is the level of toxic that causes me to equip an ivory mori if they end up in my lobby when I‚Äôm killer
---
Yea it is. Based on his spelling he seems like a kid too young to be playing this shit anyway LMAO.
---
Typical Japanese vomit fetish domination porn

There's been a lot of talk about Jane's butt, with good reason.
---
But have you guys ever opened the Exit Gate while wearing that red-and-white striped pirate shirt? Dear lord
---
Honestly, I feel like at this point no one would care.. lol WE JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME
---
No, of course not. But this guy is saying hes on dormroom wifi. There's a good chance the connection is poor because of that. Its frustrating from the survivor POV when youre a full step off the window and still get hit. Meanwhile it looks clean on the killers screen. Again, thats an extreme scenario its more likely the survivor is just whining.
---
As a killer main, theres no such thing as stressing out on swf‚Äôs. It‚Äôs either you have fun and learn or admit defeat.
---
It can be that they were moments from death before they were pulled in though, Adam, Jane, Spirit. The original 4 just got lost in the woods so who knows what that means.
---
Yeah he also got downvoted into oblivion lmao
---
NOOOO just like Friday the 13th lmao
---
i mean its just a fucking arrow symbolizing disagreement. What else would it be for...
---
WHOA THERE
---
RIN IS UNDERAGE
---
some survivors just dont complain, or theyre closer to your connection so less ping. But more than likely its just the survivor complaining over nothing. Im just saying the killer is the host so there is advantages that come with that. Nothing you can do, but I do suggest a wired connection.
---
That might be why you aren‚Äôt de-pipping then. I think I‚Äôve heard that the game can tell if a d/c was intentional or not.
---
Honestly, I feel like the opposite might be true.
---
There's more people playing survivor, but I bet the percentage of killer players who also occasionally play survivor is less than the percentage of survivors players who occasionally play killer. It feels like most survivor mains are 80/20, where as many (not most, to be clear) killer mains have the fact that they never touch survivor as a point of pride.
---
This is just judging by reddit comments and streamers and stuff. I see "I only play killer" waaaaay more than "I only play survivor".
---
I'm def not a professional DBD player
---
creative tbh
---
Do one for groaning sounds,because I can assure you Meg's voice actress was definitely tortured in the recording booth after hearing those sounds
---
I joined a game as killer and quickly found a survivor. Simple chase, nothing out of the ordinary. as soon as they are downed, they DC, and message me saying "Another sweaty tunneller." Like, what? they didn't even give me enough time to tunnel them. do they expect us to hit them once and just bugger off elsewhere?
---
I‚Äôm a nurse main, I‚Äôm always applying pressure but not too much because I don‚Äôt want my survivors to dc (happens in most of my games). Anyways, there isn‚Äôt much to do but do their objective, which are the generators. I‚Äôm not afraid of going against swf‚Äôs(as stated above) because they dc most of the time.
---
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE NEW OR WHATEVER THE REASON IS! JUST STOP TUNNELING ONE PERSON FOR THE ENTIRE  MATCH! AND GOD HELP YOU IF THE ONE TUNNELING ACTUALLY MANAGES TO GET A HIT ON YOU BECAUSE THEN THEY'RE ALMOST CERTAINLY NOT QUITTING THE CHASE! I MEAN YOU USE COMMON LOGIC AND REALISE WHEN IT'S TIME TO PUT THE BRAKES ON AND END THE TUNNELING CHASE ULTRA MARATHON!
---
It was just in case they escape
---
 .  Thanks for the tip
---
I do the same, BBQ is just too good and too fun.
---
I probably camp a little too little, though.
---
As far as fan chapters go, I really really like this. Well done, mate(y)
---
Anyone else chuckle at ‚ÄúSoggy Wood‚Äù?
---
But thankfully, Dwight's pretty reliable.
---
Urban Evasion is basically essential
---
I use monstrous shrine ironically
---
It's a game where there's no clear main objective, everyone has their own opinion of what "winning" is, and everyone is thrown into matches basically randomly. There will always be dc's in a system like this.
---
IF you go into a hospital, and you're waiting a long time to see the doctor, do you scream, fit, and rage about how you saw a janitor mopping the floor? No?
---
It would be pointless to assume that the janitor would do the work of the doctor, yet here you are being pissed off that new content is being created, which is done by a separate team of people than those working on bugs and fixes.
---
Lmao
---
To be fair, I play both sides and find it way easier to catch survivors then loop killers. Although, I admit im bad at looping and often get caught up in the chase rather than thinking about where im going next and what loops to look for.  But killers really shouldn't get so flustered when two pop early, usually the game slows down and its far easier to pressure the remaining 5 gens especially if 3 are close together. And games tend to snowball after a hook or two.
---
There is a hidden extra effect on this perk. Anytime you run with it, you will be downed within hooking distance of the basement. Not an exception in sight
---
Lol communicating threats is a misdemeanor. Hitler better watch dat shit LMAO.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous how many people DC these days!! I lucked out tonight though and had a lot of matches where no one DC which is a huge rarity anymore! I don‚Äôt care how bad I‚Äôm getting my ass kicked I never DC!
---
His sexist comments are out of line but if you play immersed and don't help your team it's very frustrating.
---
If they don't lose any pips then it is a visual glitch. Also if the Killer dc's then all the survivors who are still alive will get whatever bloodpoints they earned and count as "escaped", though that can glitch out sometimes depending on the nature of the dc (whether they manually quit in the menu or lost internet connection).
---
FUCKING SPOILER ALERT TF
---
That‚Äôs the thing I wasn‚Äôt even playing immersed, he was just saying random shit cause he was mad. But yeah players like that can be frustrating
---
heeeellllllllllll yeah duuude!
---
This is like the opposite or shitting on legion for upvotes
---
Am also bad at looping...  As a Dwight main, my idea of looping is breaking line of sight and using Quick and Quiet to enter the safe embrace of a loving locker.
---
Some people say I should run Head On now... but I don‚Äôt know why they would ever want to leave the locker...
---
Thank you. Please everyone upvote this for visibility(I'm not sure if Devs check this sub cuz I'm new). But man is this ruining my hype for this game. 15 mins on average. We literally cheer every time we find a game

You're bitching about a separate team working on new content because you're under the assumption that takes away from bug fixes. That's outlandishly incorrect in the gaming industry and you're a tool if you think that it's impacting it. Your inability to understand a comparison is almost as great as your lack of understanding with how game development works. Good job.

Someone else used a Shroud of Binding:

---
I blame Murphy.
---
from one side you are correct. these are different teams. but still one company that lives off the teamwork. 
---
right now when cosmetics bring in the buck they're not so motivated to fix multiple issues the game has because, well, they still get the money so can afford postpone certain things. 
---
i do not think it's an easy game to balance but all the latest things didn't bring anything good to the game. and i mean the engine, mostly. it completely broke the game sound wise. for some people like myself it's a boiling point cause i highly rely on sound as killer and also suffer from migraines so every time i focus in game, i get the pain. my friend has misophonia, he gets really frustrated and even irrationally angry with current sounds, especially notifications which are imbalanced at the moment. he plays since 2016 so, you know, it wasn't like it before. i play since February 2018 and game before Darkness Among Us was completely healthy for my migraine, i never git slightest triggers there before engine. that's a huge factor for me because if I'd join *with* the current sounds, I'd refund the game. but i got all dlcs and lots of real money cosmetics and spent enormous amount of time in it *before* the change. they fixed the sounds with midchapter after Legion but with the Plague broke it again. 
---
i had my husband playing with me after new engine, he couldn't. he said chase music is too loud, notifications, literally everything about sound is unpleasant so he doesn't play with me anymore, i don't blame him. the chase music is even worse after Plague chapter, especially on Haddonfield. they lowered the notifications, ambient sounds alongside with start music. 
---
most people don't seem to notice it or don't realize but the fact that sounds are so imbalanced is the reason why right now game is so tiresome for most people. that's why killers have hard time, that's why survivors get really annoyed. it's not the bugs, i swear  i've seen a bunch of bugs from when i started, yeah unlucky to get those but they were not the core. and my veteran dbd friend said bugs never bothered him so much. 
---
all in all, sounds in this type of games is really important. i can't understand why it's not a priority in fixing.
---
I saw the concept when you posted. I love the concept and need him in my life
---
If its me i usually just t-bag and point at the gen

Bruh... same. It seems like I can never run into any Jakes either these days, unless I am playing survivor and I‚Äôm just like :|
---
When I get a Jake in lobby as killer I immediately switch to Leatherboi no matter what I‚Äôm doing lol
---

---
I feel bad tunneling every jake and Dwight I see, but a leatherboi has gotta do what a leatherboi has gotta do.

Have you ever seen a nurse on console?
---
I was just curious to see what he was going to say. He instantly added me upon dcing so I couldn't resist but I never thought he'd threaten me.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main. However I play as wraith and survivors are ridiculous. I‚Äôm not a bad killer but I‚Äôm not amazing either. I saw I usually get at least 1-2 survivors every game and 4K every 3-4 games (I don‚Äôt hatch camp.) 
---
It‚Äôs just to arrogance that gets me. Like when everyone is in the gate and I‚Äôve lost. LEAVE! Don‚Äôt make me walk all the way over there. When everyone is dead or has left. LEEEEAAAVEEEE!

Hatchets don't get noed. You have to actually hit them
---
Yo this is some Noob Saibot shit and I'm into it
---
Your analogy isn't in the least bit comparative. Survivors don't have to escape to pip, and never had to escape to pip in the history of this game. Escaping has always been an extra bonus for survivors, both in the previous rank system and the new, and in the old emblem system and the new.
---
Hooking and thus killing has always had a direct impact on survivors pipping, old and new and emblem system old and new. It's just that in the new emblem system/pip system they are making it so that you have to extend the game more while doing your killing to pip, which I find ridiculous.
---
Survivors can die and still do well, Killings can't let everyone escape and do well. Try again.
---
NOED doesn't apply to Hatchets but if you hit an injured survivor with M1 while NOED is active and he has MoM, he won't go down.

what Claudette is doing in the list? these spawns of Satan killed me probably more times than actual killers. 
---
but eh, jokes aside, very wholesome tier list, love it, brightened up my mood. thank youm
---
For the most part, my hatred for my team far outweighs my hatred for the killer. Not always, but quite often
---
Unless I've been wrong for the past 6 months, your husk still gives out a terror radius while phasing, so if you get close enough you can effectively sneak up without your woosh giving you away until the very end. It seems to work fine, so I assume it does.
---
Who actually talks like that? That's like, 90s television bully levels of insults...
---
Those are important things to fix, and I won't argue that fixing these things takes way more time than would seem reasonable. But this is a company with a good amount of people, the argument that new content is being chosen in lieu of bug fixing is an ignorant viewpoint of game development in general. I'm sorry to hear bout the misophonia, my husband has something similar and I know it can make certain forms of entertainment just completely inaccessible for the amount of actual pain or anxiety it causes.  Especially considering it's not something in the game that can be fixed with sliders when you factor in how varying the sounds of similar types are.
---
It's important to fix, but the money the bug fixers make in part comes from new content, which is in turn worked on by separate teams, so it's foolish to think one is impacting the other.
---

i don't think so, pal. when i use bps as killer i tell them that i'm a generous god and they can get some bp before i slaughter them all in the name of our spider Mum.

I'm not sure if it was me or not. Does my gamer tag ring any bells?. It's TheDARKChieftan. I did everything you described.  Well if it wasn't me I'd like to say you're welcome to the survivor I let escape.
---
If you dc for any other reason other than insane lag or or some kind of game breaking bug where you gwr stuck or something, youre trash.
---
They're saying that there's a large portion of perks locked behind paid DLC, hence the paywall comment.
---
Lol true. The shit played out like yo mama jokes.
---
And I woulda got away with it if it werent for your pesky NOED.
---
Honestly black box is not even bad, you get to know we‚Äôre a survivor spawns. And if they snap out of it with another survivor you know we‚Äôre at least 2 are, Freddy‚Äôs power is most strong when there are more then one people at the start in dream state
---
HATE IT WHEN P3 CLAUDETTES PLAY STILL SO FKING IMMERSED
---
Sad...... F
---
***PLEASE LOOK BEHIND YOU WHILE BEUNG CHASED ESPECIALLY AGAISNT BILLY PLEASE***
---
Thank you
---
I hate the beads... there's no fucking counter play to it
---
Is that why I keep getting LF everytime I play Jake?
---
I was actually thinking of a perk where she would scold the killer XD
---
That would be sick! We could have the wendigo as the killer and maybe a couple of the people as survivors.
---
You good homie &lt;3
---
Pretty sure Legion should be lil bitch
---
This was on PC? Huh. ^(Pretty good job so far.)
---
Cold Dirt, Frank's, and an Ebony Mori? I would've dropped as soon as I saw Frank's utilized tbh, there's better ways to spend my time.
---
It is the same reason why you are always in the slowest lane in traffic and why your queue in the supermarket is always the slowest.
---
Confirmation bias.
---
Good to know that unless I play the way the devs make me play I‚Äôm trash at the game considering how many different variables are introduced every other game. Glad to to the my playstyle is on par with most new introductions to the game.
---
so instead of 2 v 8 it's 1 v 1 v 8? that's even more unbalanced. i'd much prefer a cooperative killer mode.
---
As soon as that exposed status popped up, they should have been a had bit more careful. It's like they were drawn by some magical force to your blade.
---
you make good arguments but i still think there is a problem there. i worked in indie companies and used to hang out with game dev group in my country. unless it's a huge corporation, these things highly depend on each other.
---
i worked on tv, small studio of one slightly famous in Russia director, we had different projects apart from actual tv thing. and way too many times we all would slack off on one side just because other brought in some buck. we also had like designer team, tv crew, managers etc. 
---
the game dev thing was also questionable. you could see how lazy some are in fixing certain things just cause "people still play". 
---
bhvr is a medium-small company, they don't have the nasty corporate with rules and standards to tell them what and how to do. i know for a fact these medium to small companies work their best when the cash flow stops. not too much so the company closes but like just not prosperous.
---
Stupid you have to block the name, I‚Äôm all for community shaming if they act like that.
---
When I play solo the other team mates are not the top of my concerns. I will unhook or heal you sure but if you‚Äôre hooked far away from an exit when gates are powered I‚Äôm leaving bye y‚Äôall üëã I‚Äôve been left on hook before and farmed and sandbagged to oblivion so I‚Äôve learned when playing solo to just get in, play the game and leave.
---
Hatchets can't proc the Exposed effect, they will always do a single state of damage (Unless you've got Iridescent Heads)
---
That makes no sense. A fully healed survivor would take precious time for the killer to put him on the hook, time means gennies done by the other survivors. 
---
Your logic is not right. Let's put it this way: Why would u want to get unhooked? If the killers finds you, you will end up on a hook again, so time wasted for your rescue could be used repairing gennies. You can stay on the hook while the other survivors do gennies. These 2 don't make sense at all.
---
&gt; I've heard plenty of people with normal vision complain that the scratch marks were hard to see on Ormond. 
---
It's not just the scratchmarks, I'm not colorblind but my god, the auras on that map are almost impossible to make out most of the time. I'd definitely support a change, can't imagine how much worse it must be.
---
tragic
---
no idea, had this too after updated engine
---
This is why I find it hard to enjoy this game sometimes. I wish people would just wake up and realize it‚Äôs just a fucking game.
---
It's planned for sometime in the summer, that's the time they're aiming to have the servers go online which means they can do a lot more with their system. Now all we gotta do is cross our fingers and pray that they don't fuck it up.
---
For Killer:
---
Hex: Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili, Nurses Calling, Make Your Choice, Bamboozle, Spirit Fury, Enduring.
---
For Survivor:
---
Self Care, any exhaustion perk (Adrenaline, Lithe, Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing), Decisive Strike, Dead Hard, Lithe, Borrowed Time (only in the shrine on PC).
---
There's probably more out there, but I only started playing again recently so I don't know about some of the more recent perks or those which got reworked.  I have read that the hate for Self Care has risen on the subreddit, but it does help when the whole team (including you) are potatoes, which you will be while you're learning the game.
---
they stole it from Reddit D:
---
cute
---
lol
---
Thank you üíï
---
The title made me laugh really loud.
---
it's saggy. i don't mind big booties but this one just isn't pretty.

---
As annoying as it is to lose your party steamers because one guy dc'd as soon as he got found and the other gave up immediately on the hook, yeah.
---
You just ended this man carrer
---
I know Tru3 was struggling to get games at Rank 1, and was also having issues getting down a rank because it was a reasonable amount of time at Rank 2, but playing a killer game and DCing at the last hook was not working for him.
---
You should reachout to chipotle, i heard they need some product for their chips
---
you can literally hear her footsteps in phase.
---
two perks that alarm you.
---
paying attention to grass and birds.
---
no counter?
---
Wiggle for considerable boost to unhook chance.
---
The eyes make me uncomfortable, lips might be a little too big, other than that it‚Äôs a good drawing.
---
I am also red green colorblind and I literally have to shove my face up against the ski lodge walls in order to see the generator auras, otherwise there just isn't enough contrast for me to make em out.
---
Just a possibility. I didn‚Äôt say it would work, just that it was interesting.
---
I mean, what did they expect with Ebony/Frank's/Dirt.
---
Now, don't get me wrong, I never DC, eventhough I don't want to play against a certain killer/build/map/whatever and I play normal game, not dying on a 1st hook but so many people DC against this Add-ons in particular and it's commonly known (still a problem, but it's reasonable, since these matches suck honestly) so why are they so surprised?
---
It nice to see people accepting of those that aren't as good.
---
I'm trying to get perks, and trying to get enough of them to not only run one build on a character, which requires a MASSIVE amount of bp.  I dislike pipping, because I don't have the tools or the terrain knowledge to effectively loop on either side (haven't played that much overall, pretty casually) and getting wrecked by people who obviously have spent more time playing just isn't fun.
---
Fuck that, I ain't raise her up just to be sacrificed to a spider God for all eternity. Send in Lee.
---
/dbdgonewild
---
Finally an accurate list
---
How would they make vendigo though? He would see all movement?
---
good ideas here. needs to be refined and it could potentially be game-worthy imo
---
There are no footsteps when she phase walks with the spirit beads...(least not on console)
---
So you're saying sacrifice a perk slot just to potentially counter this ONE thing...
---
If there is no grass and crows around (such as on the game or  Lery's) than that's mute... or if she sneaks around a corner
---
So yeah, no viable counter.
---
I don't have a way to play it :(
---
That guy who requested this gonna be real happy
---
Megathon, let us depart into the world of campfires and fairy tales to avoid a boring fucking game.
---
He's actually the top comment on this post, as a matter of fact
---
No. She shouldn't have to die over and over again. 
---
This is a definite no.
---
~10. I was Rank 7 and the Survivors (in the order they appear on the scoreboard) were Rank 9, 12, and 9.
---
The Killer, a Rank 10 Huntress with some Yellow-tier addons and a Bloody Party Streamer, was actually pretty chill. Gave me condolences for my garbage teammates and we both wished eachother luck in the next game.
---
Get ready for the biggest acid trip of your life
---
Scorn approaching!
---
there are perfectly distinguishable footsteps you can hear even with chase music/working gen sounds. pretty sure it's same on console if you'd use proper headphones. doubt they only added the footsteps exclusively for pc, man. cause even in chase i listen to those and can effectively pallet stun Spirit or be on a right side of it/window. 
---
this one thing? Spine Chill is a good counter for all stealth killers including Freddy. you can get off the gen when it procs or it can help you finish it faster if you were very close since it gives you 9% progress on when killer looks your direction. plus to that while in chase you don't have to look back so much if you see your cat go meow. 
---
there are crows everywhere on Game and Lery's. plus there you can distinguish the footsteps much better cause when Rin's bare feet step on concrete it even echos. if you heard crows fly behind a corner, can always let go off the gen for a second in case it's Rin with Beads. 
---
to me these are very viable counters. except for Spine Chill or Premonition cause i ain't a stealth player. but i love facing Spirits with Beads cause it's really fun and i love paying attention in game.
---
Pigeon squad
---
Watching this made me on the edge of my seat lol.
---
And you picked leatherface lol
---
Oh no! That man crouched at me in a video game!
---
Never understood why people can't handle something so silly...
---
If something like that gets to you, I pity you for being a snowflake.
---
Clown dosen't really punish stealth but Doctor does.
---
you'd be surprised how many people run it on all ranks.
---
but i know my opinion is very unpopular amongst "dedicated casual players". you are the reason Freddy got nerfed cause you don't want to learn to counter stuff, you just want to win.
---
There is some in between between giving no helpful information and being "an elite swat team"
---
Like saying that the killer is on you so your friend can safely go for a save, or saying you're about to go down so your friend can better time a flashlight, or just sharing the identity of location of a killer.
---
It's not intentionally meant to ruin the game, but being able to share info in a game designed around having no communication is a HUGE advantage.
---
Claduttes watching you from the shadows
---
I got the typical angry "you're tunnelling trash" message yesterday and I actually explained what happened, told him his salt makes the win better, and told him not to be aggressive because it's just a game. He actually admitted I was right and apologized. It was a sight to behold. People are disarmed if you don't give them the toxic response they expect.
---
Of course not. We're likely going to have to put up with that dumb shit until the mid-chapter patch.
---
I love it when they try to use Head On and they have no appropriate sense of timing so I just snatch them as they leave the locker or when they're still in there. 
---
Jane: "HYAA!"
---
Trapper: "Boo." 
---
Complete with the Master Chief voice we *all* know he has.
---
Right. 
---
Because spine chill makes you an advanced gamer. Got me.
---
Nice dude! My first P3 killer was Doctor.
---
oh yeah the blinding. my brain removed these memories.
---
This is illegal lol
---
There's a penal code that prevents this. 
---
Um...so, do something.
---
Is that really an unpopular opinion?
---
Hag IS a little bit of everything
---
That window tint must have been expensive.
---
I was thinking the same thing since the shrine is always a disappointment each week.
---
I CAN'T HEAR YOU
---
personally I prefer lee
---
I‚Äôm not brave enough for Legion.
---
i don't even use those but i see them often in people's builds. stop being so salty. these are still solid perks to counter stealth killers, i don't understand why someone complains there are no counters to Beads but you tell them there are and they say "yeah, these counters suck cause i don't want my meta perks removed". like...???? come on
---
Expecting bugs that only affect survivors negatively to get quickly patched? lol
---
that's not very nice at all. op plz change this misleading title
---
I mean, technically the more you play the less you‚Äôd need to rely on the shrine for a random perk unless you specifically have something against buying a DLC bundle/character
---
He couldn't risk hitting her otherwise she'd jump in hatch
---
honestly this power was what i expected to Legion to have in some form, having the character send out the other characters to do certain actions.
---
I could be wrong, but isn't that a worse Bond? Not trying to be a dick either. Sorry if it comes off that way
---
I knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy!
---
__I like how reddit etiquette forces you to clarify you're not being a dick, when simply asking a question__
---
No matter how much you tweak out
---
I have also used this technique from time to time.
---
Damn right
---
God I had a similar David like that a while ago
---
Didnt even get to pick him up he dced so fast
---
I‚Äôve started using Blood Warden on some of my builds with a ‚Äúflex slot‚Äù for a perk and there is little more satisfying than activating it and walking towards the exit, seeing the realization dawn on the survivors that stayed to taunt when they hit that barrier.
---
How exactly does one "steal" a meme? Sharing it is what makes it a meme.
---
I like where this is going
---
Honestly you want something else to get broken in its place
---
No not the etiquette of reddit just the etiquette of online message boards. Words can be taken out of context or misunderstood, so easier to just say it before. :) Also this is just me and I tend to say this when speaking to people in person as well.
---
It saddens me that shitty legion shitposts get more upvotes than this amazing art üòî
---
Yes but I don't *like* Clementine as much as I like Lee, and even the most of the later seasons revolve around her, at most everyone will agree that the First game was magical. 
---
It also fits a lot better. I think Lee is far more appropriate for the game, and actually did indecent things. Like, he shot people, and piked 'em through the head with pitchforks. He was a badass, and the OG Walking Dead character.
---
I am almost exclusively a survivor and I do sometimes thank the killer for a good game or even mark him as a good player post game if I liked him/her.
---
That's witchhunt and is not allowed, no matter what an asshole this guy is.
---
The legs that sacrifice survivors would say no.
---
You‚Äôre not a dick. You‚Äôre totally right &amp; my post was resolved! Thanks!
---
I do not doubt the stupidity of fanatics.
---
There surely were enough people that were on board with that thing and wanted to support it.
---
Yeah but you deleted it, Mr. Burnapot. I even checked to see if it was you, and it's impossible to tell cause it's deleted. But even then, you're just point farming. Repost the same thing every day until it gets upvotes. Outstanding.
---
I think the question with a shorter awnser is why isnt she?
---
I seriously don't understand that. WHy would anybody disconnect on the first hook? I've seen that in my games and just don't understand it. You can recover just fine, win and get a lot of Blood Points afterwards.
---
*Infinitely increasing mend time fixed
---
*Somehow manages to make tombstone Myers move 10% faster every time he moris someone.
---
That was impressive
---
Well, you have to agree that shitposts pretty much make up 90 percent of Reddit üòÇ but thank you my dude
---
My successes are the survivor mistakes*
---
I‚Äôm still confused. I finished season one, watched xQcOW play the final season. Clem lives, but Lee dies. Why? Is it because Lee lost too much blood?
---
Clementine kills people too...
---
If I‚Äôm 100% honest I was gonna put this at the end but felt people would take it more as a shitpost so didn‚Äôt risk it. However for all we know the entity could have multiple forms but yeah I agree with you that I don‚Äôt have spider-esque limbs. maybe someone out there?
---
Although I agree Lee is a better fit
---
&gt; Also fuck Legion(the dbd version)
---
All four at once or can you spread it out?
---
I've DCed like 10 games in a row.  Played a few, then DCed 6 more and had no penalty.
---
W-gamer and urban evasion, yuck
---
Maybe the'll release them with an event? I can only hope we'll get some bonus BP...
---
No. His gimmick is that people are the true monsters. I love him. I relate.
---
His job? Is he paid? 
---
Maybe we all come back down to planet earth and realize that this is a video game for starters.
---
I agree even in the time when survivors were inarguably stronger I would argue that weaker perks should be buffed across the board for survivors so that they have more variety, just like what I think would help bring killer in line too. We‚Äôve gotten so used to ruin and make your choice or dead hard and adrenaline and all the other perks we see every game feels like clockwork on who brought the best add ons and maps. Little buffs like making brutal strength a little faster or giving lightweight an extra second or stuff like that to make for a little more forward thinking.
---
I love this. I would pay money for an in game icon pack of everyone.
---
At least in his other one he turned into a god damn dragon.
---
Worng. The goal of the game is to get as many blood points as possible. C
---
Nice work! I believe my first P3 was The Doctor on PS4, but now that I'm on PC, my two main P3's are Nurse and Myers.
---
Uhhhh I never said it wasn't? I don't get why this is such a controversial statement. You little kids read too much into shit. üòÇ
---
my toxic asshole always wants to come out when i‚Äôm playing survivor;;;; something about the role just fuels being a dick
---
Dced? A new term for me srry
---
and still most of them are douchbag
---
Wasn‚Äôt laurie‚Äôs scream nerfed too? I seem to recall the sound playing twice whenever she got hooked
---
Disconnected
---
&gt;The thing I hate the most is
---
that's the point ma dude
---
Lol I rarely played killer outside dailies and yikes. Usually they were okay but holy shit the premade were toxic.
---
Oh I'm chasing someone? 2 people start spamming the doors and windows to make tons of noise which just got annoying after a bit. Wasnt evem a good killer, felt overkill
---
Maybe because I like playing leatherface? I play more for fun than for progress, which is probably why it took me so long to p3.
---
Yup. Looks like a Facebook meme lol
---
Oh, thx
---
It's fine. You can change your name and nothing will be messed up. Did it myself.
---
Thanks man I'm just glad to know my data won't be lost
---
Wassup you feathered bastard, Brick here telling you to keep that beak up. Don't let noone keep you down, spread those disease ridden wings and fly the fuck out of those exit gates like a symbol of freedom. Or maybe follow the trail of breakcrumbs I leave to the hatch just before I get instamori'd. Now go, FLY YOU FOOLS
---
*aesthetic 
---
*piece
---
^^sorry
---
Nothing deserves DCs, except bugs or exploits.  The devs put the OP add-ons for a reason.  Yes, many of them are stupid broken, but just take the loss and move on.  The DC meta is ruining the game.  One week it's DC against Frank's/IRI Head/etc.  The next week it's ok to DC if it's a killer they don't like facing.  Now we have people DCing if the killer has Ruin or stupid shit like that.
---
Such a nice post, I love Huntress. You go, baby Huntress!
---
Freddy can't protect the totem, DH should be lower.
---
It‚Äôs on the list of games that don‚Äôt have any issues :)
---
Do you even squat bro?!?!?
---
are people still unironically using "snowflake" as an insult
---
It's not you're fault you didnt no. These heathans and there shorthand misled you. Now you sea had you scene DC'd you probably wouldve understood but the complete lack of respect for the english language in this thread is leeding us to a state of disaray.
---
I wish I could be this woke.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs pretty much pinpoint accurate.  Well done!
---
Dbd does its best to match Survivors with Killers around their rank, so as to avoid this issue.
---
In Overwatch and Siege, most veterans are offvplaying ranked, which hasvthe same system. Call of Duty is just a shitshow.
---
Throwing someone with 10 hours against someone with 1000 is a quick way to turn them off of the game.
---
dead hard thing hasn‚Äôt happened in forever and i feel if you watched him more you‚Äôd see that he‚Äôs gotten a lot better as survivor. he‚Äôs pretty alright at looping and what not imo. everyone obviously has off days and such, when it‚Äôs an on day, he can loop very well.
---
Tbh the brick did really well for a brick.
---
I thought they said were releasing chapter themed outfits for some survivors and killers for every chapter starting with clown. And they did it for the clown, spirit, and legion chapter but not plague???
---
It's the only explanation that works. Lee just bears the infection for too long and it spread to the rest of his body. 
---
Clem just managed to sever the limb soon enough to matter, but it had already been some odd hours later and she was looking pretty damn bad. She should have turned
---
#Rank3DrugGang
---
(I've just seen a lot of my old friendgroup fall apart entirely over it. Honestly, I met them in a bad town.)
---
i like waiting around the exit gate slowly approaching it as killer come, so they almost always can get a hit on me before i leave. They deserve those few hit points
---
&gt;LEAVE! Don‚Äôt make me walk all the way over there. When everyone is dead or has left. LEEEEAAAVEEEE
---
nooo i want to give you free points Wraith ! come here !
---
If only the devs made this stuff
---
True lmao
---
I‚Äôll burn this whole game down
---
Lee or Clem, I wouldn‚Äôt care, but I would 100% from the bottom of my heart P3.
---
How are you gonna talk about civilty when you begin the conversation by being that cancerous lmao
---
https://i.imgur.com/1kJbqEs.jpg
---
The last thing OP sees before the DC'er dislocates OP's jaw with an antique screwdriver
---
But Frank and Joey are the cool ones
---
Did they even release them for the Legion? I didn't realize any were tied to it.
---
Well done, but this seems like a baby killer to me, you didn't look back while being chased and he didn't know how to use chainsaw right.
---
Im talking about civility in the negative. As in I won't even be remotely polite or engage in actual conversation when someone starts a question mark sentence like a passive aggressive twat. Also who are you to give a shit, you're not even in our conversation
---
Majority of the time it doesn‚Äôt work, I‚Äôve tried the stealth game and majority of the time being a good looper is better. The stealth game sucks when you aren‚Äôt a Claudette player.
---
Freddys big fat juicy cock
---
Are they also dying out like blockbuster ?
---
I'm surprised to see this kind of media service still exists with all the options on the internet
---
I started to enjoy playing Nurse lately.
---
But dont be afraid of a Learning curve, its more like a small Learning bumper
---
Honestly gen rushing is the survivors doing their job, tunneling is the killer making sure his objective gets done. Neither are that fun to go against.
---
Yaaawn.
---
Crows are the true lords
---
Spirit has been my favorite since i got her,  i want to play nurse but shes difficult on ps4
---
One example of (negative) tunneling is if a Killer chases you constantly even though elsewhere on the map 2 generators have already been completed by the others, they are most likely already working on the thrid and the killer still doesn't relent and tries to put pressure on the others or at least take a look at the Generators instead of always following that one survivor across the map.
---
You too getting pm'd by salty players? I posted about my experience in the fog recently aswell
---
Okay but like I wanna stab the player through their screen when they hook you and then just stand their and wait. Bitch, go hunt someone else and give me a chance to play the game ffs
---
idk, doubles the question of why you bother replying to me doesn't it.
---
I will say this from my entire heart : dresesses are overrated. Too RNG based to be so high. I saw multiple matches where dresesses did nothing for the user.
---
Normally I'd disagree but it is your cake day so, carry on.
---
I can't talk for other killers, but I often show mercy for survivors that don't actively try to piss me off. Something else you should keep in mind is that toxicity inspires toxicity. If the Survivors all wait at the exit gate just to T-bag me after a game where I actively tried not to camp nor tunnel, I am way more likely to equip an ebony mori and do some tunneling in the next game. (I don't do this myself, but I know a lot of killers who do)
---
Same effect happens when I'm a survivor, if the killer tunnels and camps me the whole game, but I still manage to escape, I will be sure to give him the butt dance at the end
---
You can be hit through windows with 0 lag. They are holes in walls and it's intended.
---
They did! It was the wicked wares outfits. I know there was one for meg, hillbilly, and Adam. I can‚Äôt remember the others. And yeah the packs that came with the chapters, you could only buy them with auric cells. Except at the end of the season they would let you buy them with shards for like a week.
---
I think it's funny how, as a killer, I often back survivors up in end game chat. In ny games, survivors attack each other more than they attack me
---
Played against a streaming fella while I was using Pebble. Had a couple of moments, and it is great now that I can see exactly what pebble is capable of, the possibilities are endless C:
---
I did not know pebbles go through walls.
---
Yeah true. You can be accurate with a controller, but even I know that the "max" accuracy on pc is far greater
---
if you cared enough about the game that you're mad about spoilers you should've played it at some point in the last 7 years.
---
Do you understand what the general concept of a public forum is or is that just not something you can wrap your head around? I think you need to re-evaluate the need to jump into random posts like you're doing whatever the hell this is.
---
Anyway kiddo gotta bounce. Just google "public forum definition" or something along those lines, that's your homework for tonight, later gator!
---
Honestly, if I have any reason *at all* to suspect there are more survivors in the area I'll ignore a teabagger to look for the gen work, injured, or bad juker he's trying to protect.
---
IF you teabag after you drop (and miss, usually) a pallet I'll gladly give up my BPs for the round to camp your face and nod at you all game.
---
fuck thats cringe
---
Just ignore her. What would you possibly expect anyone to do to help you? 
---
If you weren't holding the game hostage then you're perfectly fine. If you were, well stop that. Problem solved.
---
Yeah, it's fun to see the survivors panic when I teleport behind them and it's even funnier to see what the survivors do when I just stand still making them the I'm phase walking.
---
Absolutely agree. Unless it's an exploit or deliberate griefing it's all fine.
---
Game balance is another matter but it's wrong to complain when players on either side play within the constraints of the game itself.
---
Bill mains are the real mvps :'(
---
I don't tbag but I also dont nod as killer like a spastic because both sucks :shrug:. There is legit NO reason to spam the nod one 1K like.. a 1K means you played really awful the entire game and got someone who was cocky at the exit gates. That already shame enough for the one survivor that goes down vs someone who didnt manage to get a Kill the whole game. Why dotta get down to the level of that surv? BVut thats just reddit "These mean survivors' mentality striking again.
---
You can get 4/3,000s of the way to a common item. Or 4/8,000s of the way to a rare perk. Can you slow down?
---
To clarify
---
Dis Connect 
---
Is what it's been split to
---
So it's all "they're gonna DC I know it" 
---
That's predicting a disconnect
---
Now I don't get why dced is a thing
---
But DC'd works fine
---
Obviously better for the team, but not better for the individual.  Pretty sure people wouldn't willingly tank an axe hit for someone IRL if an axe murderer was chasing them, so why do it in a game that's essentially based around being in a horror film?
---
Did you hook her or did you keep picking her up and dropping her?
---
We got Ash, what else would better tie into a killer from when civilization was young
---
I recently got grief for tunnelling after I hooked a survivor who was rescued while I was chasing, and subsequently hooking a second survivor then several minute later hooked the first one again (he'd had time to heal in the intervening period)
---
Moral: some players will accuse if of anything just because they didn't like the outcome.
---
If you are new, I suggest you not to buy teachable perks that are available without buying dlc. Just level up the characters you have to 40, it's not that big of a grind as it seems for new players, that comes later.
---
Play freddy. It takes real skill to master the guy but once you do its scary how strong you are.
---
I was about to say where comes the misconception from that only survivors do that? Some of the Killer Mains should really start playing survivor post Rank 18.
---
Is it racist to want a chung li outfit for feng min?
---
Finally some good fucking food
---
You think I wanna see him go again?! üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüò•
---
nope not a chance nope never again
---
I have a few that I think would be neat
---
Ada Wong or Jill valentine perhaps 
---
Macready from the thing (Kurt Russell) 
---
The legion members (smaller models obviously and without masks)
---
Felt cute, might mori\* someone later idk
---
Everytime at the exit gates, there's at least one survivor teabagging his ass off  
---
It's gotten to the point where if there's more than 1 survivor I just don't go to to the exit gates and go afk so they feel like they wasted their time.
---
in-fucking-deed.
---
I haven‚Äôt touched it in over a month. I have to actively keep myself from playing it because since it‚Äôs come out I‚Äôve had like 5 or 6 games line up that I want to play but dbd consumes all my time lol
---
Well what is he supposed to do? Just waste his time and gift you a free game?
---
Brutal Strength is underrated, but Enduring and Spirit Fury is rightfully considered top tier, certainly not underrated.
---
So you shouldn't be able to be on Discord/TeamSpeak while you're playing SWF? What?
---
I mean, pretty much everyone uses a third party voice chat program while playing SFW. Just because the game doesn't have it's own voice chat doesn't mean it's not allowed.
---
Hell, the Official Verified Dead By Daylight Discord has it's own voice channels for SWF and KYF.
---
If you're a great survivor, you don't even need communication. A good survivor can do just as well with and without communication.
---
At Rank 1 as killer, I personally can't even tell the difference between SWF and Solo players most of the time. SWF does make it easier since you can choose only good players to your team but communication isn't the factor that makes SWF easier.
---
'cause the rules are not the same than in an horror film. Or considered it as the specific rules in this horror film as you want.
---
Calm down Blake.
---
Just accepted your victory. Nobody wants to play against zero counter killer.
---
My man. It is an expression. You can replace "job" with "task" or "objective".
---
I like legion  -\(&lt;,&lt;)/-
---
I‚Äôm not very good with them as the killer, but I don‚Äôt mind them when I‚Äôm survivor.  (The new glitch with their addons stacking the mend is an exception, but even franks... meh, every killer has addons that have deadly potential, I just try and go for glory and then if I lose, move on to the next trial lol) 
---
Not sure why everyone blows it way out of proportion... just try to relax, make it fun for yourself by not taking the game too seriously, and just move on to the next trial :) 
---
that‚Äôs how I have fun at least
---
"bonus bloodpoints" aka 625 in brutality for each dc and it reaches the 8k cap more often than not even without DCs
---
I'd rather have the bbq stack and besides if someone leaves early it doesn't feel like an earned 4k, I'm just being handed one
---
it looks fat but boney at the same time, like wtf?
---
Well, killers don‚Äôt really have as much of an opportunity to talk shit since there‚Äôs one quarter of them per match compared to survivors, and many survivors leave the match when they die and so could be speaking to an empty lobby, but survivors can know for sure that the killer is there until the chat disconnects.
---
It just fits more. Like if they are gonna get a twd license they should defo use it for Rick and Negan.
---
you take it way too personally.
---
Sounds nice. And the legion seems nice too bc i just saw the sloppy butcher + a nurse's calling combo
---
Thats the only logical next release!
---
I am at work can you make one for tunneling killers who ignore the 3 nearly done gens they came pass while tunneling? Like you know they are about to complain about genrush
---
imma dc from every legion game until he has counterplay.
---
Oh shit my bad man I completely misunderstood. Sorry dude, anyway do have a good one
---
Same with freddy except you get auto tracking.
---
Real random but genuine: people play dbd on xbox? I‚Äôve literally never seen anyone even mention it.
---
Nice
---
I usually will wait in the exit gate if I think a killer is trying to do a daily just so they can get it done
---
No problem :)
---
Problem is, more people need to play killer. I‚Äôll wait ages as survivor but killer lobbies are almost instant. Give killer a try and help your fellow survivors.
---
Y I K E S
---
I don‚Äôt even think you can stack it can you?
---
From what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs capped to the limit of hooks you can have/not have
---
Sunken cost fallacy. If Killer where to give up on the chase it will feel as if he wasted time with nothing for show. Especially since there's no guarantee other survivors aren't good loopers either. 
---
Plus, sometimes it's very easy to get into competitive mood and decide that hooking that one survivor who's too good at looping is more important than trying to chase others.
---
This is unrelated but I love how tru3 gets randomly stabbed by Legion right at the end of the clip, that‚Äôs some nice comedic timing haha.
---
Nice points btw, they‚Äôre definitely interesting to think about.
---
I think Legion add-ons never had a chance, since BHVR idiots overbalanced them poorly. (Strong and milquetoast add-ons that have no direct stacking.)
---
That said, eat this upvote for being a chill player. My brother loves playing Legion; I suck as it.
---
When you sacrifice yourself for a pub and they dont even say thanks &lt;/3 .
---
For the exact same reason the rank 20 survivor almost has a full tier 3 perk loadout with a firecracker.
---
&gt; I am way more likely to equip an ebony mori and do some tunneling in the next game. (I don't do this myself, but I know a lot of killers who do)
---
And this leads to a never ending cycle of "they did it, so why should I be nice?"
---
Please don't play Killer when your internet isnt stable. It is easy as that. Yes farming survivors suck BUT i the lobby shows me 60 ping but i play with actully 500 because everytime the killer uses his ability his network fucking dies all my fun is killed. This happens more often than you think and I already use MLGA to see my actual ping and not this shitty ingame system.
---
Lore wise I‚Äôm pretty sure they do talk to each other, because most of the perk quotes seem to originate from their time in the trials.
---
No please not Clem, don't let her suffer.
---
Get more than 2 hooks lol he could farm and make it sort of worth his while, rather than barely any bp
---
Have a clip of 4 dwights on ps4 doing the exact same thing
---
Legion is hated because you can't escape him without being injured.
---
1. You want to hide? You can't. After hitting someone in frenzy he will see you.
---
2. You want to run? You can't. He will frenzy and hit you.
---
3. You want to loop? You can't. He will frenzy, jump on a window or pallet faster than you and hit you.
---
4. You want to juke? You can't. In frenzy he has a faster recovery speed and 360¬∞ with him is impossible.
---
For people who is good in chases is frustrating because Legion hit them without counterplay and then, thanks for blood pools and grunts of pain, he will down them. Or not, hit repeatedly with frenzy and down them without counterplay either.
---
You could cap it in terms of bloodpoints gained but not for pipping purposes.
---
As a killer? YES!
---
If they can't find a way to blame the killer, they'll blame their own teammates. Sad. One day, they'll take responsibility.
---
I'm referring to legion as "fun boi"
---
Especially with Legion, people like to call "tunneller" if you down a single person. Sure, you may not use one facet of their power, there may not have even been someone revealed on the first hit, but noooo, not injuring everyone and not hooking anyone before everyone escapes is tunnelling.
---
I'm not taking anything personally. If you taunt from the safety of the exit gate, you're a child, simple as that. Be a big boi and actually show some skill or finesse next time. There's hardly any bragging rights behind t-bagging when there's literally nothing to fear. This is all especially true if you can't even play the game properly and d/c before you even get hooked. Take it as a learning experience and hope a teammate unhooked you. If you're worried about being camped, don't get caught t-bagging the killer.  It happens so often and typically just ruins games. I hate experiencing it as a killer and I hate it as a survivor.
---
ONE side? Both sides shit talk an immense amount.
---
That is just not true.
---
Haha ok,  add me on steam and then we can chat about discord :) 
---
Same name as here
---
Well it's certainly strange you were playing that way... But unless she was the last survivor left and the hatch hadn't even spawned, you definitely were not holding the game hostage
---
Yesss, best survivor!
---
Have my upvote :)
---
Awwwww
---
Or I've just waited 20 minutes for a game and there's at least 1 DC every other match. I used to be nice about it but now I can't just have a night with normal games, so when I have a game I play rather than go through "come hit me with a pallet then I'll watch you do gens."
---
EXTREMELY TEMPTED TO DC EVERYTIME
---
The usual :)
---
The most compelling argument is (and spoiler alert for those who hasn‚Äôt been caught upp):
---
Minerva cut Clementines leg, and she cut it pretty deep too. Clem was then bitten less than 5 minutes after that. Because the bite was *so close* to the wound, it had a hard time infecting the rest of the body. According to the devs, the time between clem getting bit and AJ cutting of her leg is ~15 minutes which is a long stretch imo (from clear night to day in 15 min?!). A lot of people assumed that the rest of clems body was infected because she looked sick but the most likely explanation is that it‚Äôs due to her blood loss, because of Minerva cut up her leg + she had to walk and run an uncertain amount of distance(pressuring the wound even more)
---
Lee however was bit and then traveled to Vernens hideout and didn‚Äôt cut his arm until *after* he started showing the symptoms. At that point it didn‚Äôt matter if he cut his arm off or not, his body was already turning.
---
I don‚Äôt mind normal Legion it‚Äôs his addons I don‚Äôt like.
---
Devs literally stated they always knew third party communication was  going to happen and that it isn't against their rules.
---
It's nice that you, in your infinite wisdom, have come up with your own rules, but nobody has to follow them.
---
lmao learn to have some fun it‚Äôs a video game jesus christ
---
i didn't know people still did this
---
Just block her, and move on.
---
Applies on Survivors too then
---
I'm not normally for the memey character additions, but jesus Brenda would be incredible in this game.
---
She just needs voice lines on the hook if the killer is nearby to yell "OUTTA MY FACE!"
---
Yeah he goes from 0 to a 100.
---
What I myself dislike the most is if they keep hitting me. I mean why? It serves no practical use and is just insulting to the one hanging on the hook.
---
I really like to play Legion.I juat sympathize with the survivors when i put the op add ons.
---
Priority‚Äôs.
---
as a nurse player, she‚Äôs easy as fuck to learn and after that you just hold m2 and swing and there‚Äôs nothing they can do. easy 4ks at red ranks with low effort.
---
People who play piggie and camp while we pop all the gems then rbt me at the exit gate who think they are good.
---
The same goes the other way, we survivors don't have to gift killers free kills either and you have no right for a 4 kills game each time. It is literally told to us by the game to rush generators and escape as fast as possible with as few deaths as possible.
---
Sometimes he tends to whine too much and don't give credits to survivors or killers when they beat him, but probably because he is very competitive. In a video game like DbD a lot of people are competitive and try to win no matter what. Sometimes he stil recognise a good survivor or a good killer if that is the case. Also, I like how funny he can be :
---
"Stop bodyblock me Meg, you stupid thing"
---
"Balance Landing that love"
---
" You have also a Instant Heal, you're amazing"
---
" You have 3 Blinks and NOED, you're amazing as well"
---
"Survivors, I already play Nurse with 1 blink and without Ruin. But no, we need mist as well"
---
" Spirreh ! Please, stop these things"
---
"Fucking Spirreh with Prayer Beads !"
---
And of course 
---
" Fucking Dead Ard !"
---
Mettle Of Man stops NOED even of your are fully healed.
---
Killer lives matter. Stop the bullying üôÖ
---
The this key nea and run all the way home. Don't stop to talk to anyone!
---
It‚Äôs your field of view in first person,
---
I'm almost ready to p1 freddy.
---
I would actually prefer Lee to be a survivor in this game, or Kenny.
---
LOL I don't think she would have done that if Ashley hadn't been so trigger happy to get her shot tbf
---
You may see it from that point of view, but i can assure you the last thing most killers want is to waste their time more by coming at the gates to trade a couple hits. Unironically just end the game if ur at the gates and there's no risk for the other alive survs.
---
Don't you understand, one survivor dropping a pallet and not getting hooked means all the other 3 MAGICALLY stop doing gens!
---
Sorry, I think you're confused, everyone else here is playing a game called Dead by Daylight.
---
The only reason it isn't against their rules is because there is nothing they can do to stop it. They don't balance around it. They would prefer the game is played without it I'm sure. But there is nothing they can do and so they don't. It's not against the rules but it's still not intended to be part of the game. No one can deny that it gives an advantage where there is none. I'm sure if dead by daylight was made into an esport with a pro scene they would not allow voice comms in tournament play.
---
Killers as Survivors before they went tragic. 
---
* Evan Macmillan- an eccentric but somewhat disturbed ego maniac. 
---
* Philip Ojimo or Whatever his name is - A bright and hardworking young man. 
---
* Herman Carter - A brilliant Doctor with a sadistic curiosity. 
---
You get the idea. However, there are a number of Killer who wouldn't work as Survivors, as their downfall began when they were still children. In Hillbilly's case, since he was a few weeks old- as far as I can tell.
---
I think the deal is both sides can have cheap tactics that aren't exactly fair. Body blocking is unacceptable though unless it's a camping hard tunneler. It's not like that person would have wiggled free if they were alone. At the same time if I get down and it's my last hook I'd appreciate a body block. That's the mentality of a lot of people.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
you decide ...
---
Agreed, once a nurse player hits a certain skill level, they can‚Äôt lose.
---
Salt Powered Nea
---
Camping killers make me want to uninstall this game and never look back. "Yay! I got one kill and the rest escaped!" Ugh....
---
Calm Spirit would like to know your location
---
Nah. If it went bad I'd just tunnel that rank 14 and take my one kill and go home.
---
Maybe he didn‚Äôt play since rank reset or he only played survivor...
---
 Open it‚Äôs fine for me, takes less then a minute for me to get into a full game.
---
So then vaulting through a window and getting hit while in the air is lag? What about right after as soon as they touch the ground? I get a lot of hits like that and I get hit like that a lot if there isn't a little space between me and the vault.
---
Nah, my solo queue is around 60-70% killer nowadays and I'm still considered an entitled survivor main...
---
i personally like referring to legion as "gamer"
---
so if i'm doing swf i'll call out legion by saying "the killer's a gamer"
---
i an satisfied with this decision.
---
Is she old enough ?
---
The real question is how does a rank 19 killer have 4 maxed out perks including NOED?
---
 Maybe you're just bad no matter what survivors you go against.
---
&gt;  you're a child, simple as that
---
again you take it personally. Even a useless tbag at the exit gate isn't an insult to you but more a comical move that can make some players smile.
---
We are playng a game here so we are all childish in a way.
---
Is this how matchmaking works now?
---
killer is literally fine unless you camp lmao, ive double pipped multiple times at red ranks
---
I don't think that will be fixed untill we have dedicated servers.
---
BHVR IS NOT GONNA GET EVEN MORE ACTUAL MONEY FROM ME BY FORCING ME TO BUY A DLC FOR A KILLER I DONT INTEND TO PLAY JUST SO I CAN GET ONE GODDAMN PERK
---
Getting good is a counter

Ahh, pallets still have RNG I see. Besides it, this chapters is now more interestibg!

---
You play Bubba? I see you are also a man of culture.
---
open secret: killer mains don't give a fuck about Ruin when we play survivor, because hitting your greats is actually not that hard.
---
open secret part 2: we go and cleanse it anyway because the 3 survivor mains on the team refuse to do gens with ruin up for some reason
---
"Body blocking is unacceptable though unless it's a camping hard tunneler. It's not like that person would have wiggled free if they were alone."
---
What?
---
Too right. Ego loses more games than anything for killers. Some killers will let themselves get looped for 6 minutes straight then cry on reddit about ‚Äúbut muh gen rush reee‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt gen rush you fool, you focused the entire game on one single survivor who could out loop you. Let him go and get back to pressuring gens and chasing other survivors.
---
Removed for party thread post /r/dbdLFG
---
I like tru3, but he seriously needs to chill with what he considers "toxic" and unfair... hope he takes a turn for the better sometime soon
---
Removed for name shaming
---
He doesnt punish it as hard as doc but if he throws a bottle in an area where someone is hiding it gives them away. Makes it very inconvenient if you‚Äôre hiding by a gen that was kicked or waiting to get an unhook.
---
any time Huntress, happy to eat a hatchet or 2!
---
They should. Instead they endorse the ultra aggressive playstyle to get pips and rank
---
I miss playing against bad killers.
---
Open secret: I'm a killer main (currently survivor main as new geo location is trash) and I always do one gen before looking for Ruin. I get annoyed with Ruin on good killers because at that point it's either a lack of confidence or skill to kill at least 3 before gates are powered (Spirit, Billy, Nurse)
---
My example was a past game yesterday. It wasn't even hidden, it was right next to a gen between tires on T wall L wall gen. I did one gen and they just traded hooks.
---
These Devs rarely fix anything quickly. I'd say to expect this to be fixed with the mid-chapter patch at the earliest.
---
I changed mine and everything seems fine. Everything of mine is still there.
---
Even though I don't main killer, I can understand why he's doing it. He hasn't gotten a kill yet, and you guys have 1 gen left. The guy needs to secure at least one fucking kill. As long as you did something and didn't sit in a corner twiddling your dick you shouldn't depip even if you die, so what's the real problem? I get face camped almost every game, but I still either safety pip or pip. You're really just complaining about this guy doing his part as the killer. It's a video game, get over it.
---
I don‚Äôt know
---
Brenda from Scary Movie for sure
---
In the description says it stacks actually

---
Lee only dies if you finish season one.
---
I never did, so he's not dead. Just missing.
---
It‚Äòs not a synonym though. Having a personal objective is far different from having a job. 
---
I was just mocking the poor expression and made fun of it. People take this game too seriously.
---
KILLERS WHO QUIT AFTER READING OUR AMAZING OFFERINGS SHOULD BE PUNISHED AND WE SHOULDN'T LOSE OUR OFFERINGS FOR THE KILLER'S MISTAKE !!!

what i hate about some killers is that. i have tried getting found within 10 sec of a match and i look the killer for 2-3 gens and then he facecamps me and flame me in post match lol
---
Skybounds hinted at a new season of TWD so I doubt Clem would ever enter DBD. 
---
Which is good because Clem doesn't deserve to be here. Let her have her happy ending.
---
I‚Äôve been loving huntress lately, it‚Äôs super satisfying to hit people with axes and hearing her hum is cool
---
Oo interesting
---
I'm sure they squashed a lot of bugs and setup framework for the game that exists today
---
The end user might not have seen much but bitch you don't know what they did behind the scenes and neither do I so why the fuck are you assuming they didn't do shit and running your mouth like you were on the operation health dev team
---
I just pictured susie with all of the d.va voice lines. thanks i hate it.
---
I know that‚Äôs why bill isn‚Äôt a problem, perks can be ported over easily, abilities not so much
---
reading all these killer confessions makes me sad ;(
---
this game is really toxic &gt;\_&lt;
---
I wish BHVR had the balls to keep their changes and not bend to reddit's crying. 
---
Double pipping doesn't need to be easy and getting 4 iridescent or at least 3 iridescent + gold means you really deserved that double pip.
---
I think this is a film called Legion, the X men based TV isnt on netflix (i think).
---
Good point, but still. If you're not patrolling the Hex Totem(s), they would most likely get cleansed anyway pretty soon. It doesn't take much for the survivor to hide nearby if the heartbeat gets stronger while cleansing a totem. Thrill of the Hunt is a great SWF counter too.
---
Of course it does give a slight benefit to the SWF if they all now search for the totem, but honestly, it doesn't make that much of a difference in my experience as killer. Maybe I haven't faced that sweaty SWFs. Who knows.
---
Also, survivors having benefits from knowing where the killer is, is really situational. Sure, it ***can*** give an advantage **in some situations** but they aren't really major game changers.
---
Callouts like "You can lift me off the hook now" is pretty useless if everyone has eyes and ears, but sometimes a callout from someone hanging on a hook like "He's coming your way" can sometimes change some things, which is why I'd prefer if they changed hooked survivors to have the blindness status effect to prevent these callouts. If you can't see where your teammates are, you can't callout the killers direction according to the teammates' position. This would already be a big enough change.
---
Ladies ladies ladies. I watch Logan Paul
---
 
---
*Mic drop*
---
Yeah... so you know the true saviour?
---
if the roles are reversed then you'd find that behavior disgusting too, yes its a game but we don't need to be dicks to each other in order to have fun
---
unless being a dick in your family =s fun. then you've been raised wrong my dude
---
When I play killer (usually the annoying skill check doctor) If i get to the point of the 4 k, I will let the last guy get the hatch/do a generator to escape
---
Oh well I remember myself getting 3 iridescent before and not getting double pip so they had to change it like a bit. They didn't change a lot tho the lowered it just a smidg of what I know

Did everyone forget about the killer equivalent to teabagging? The head nod.  Some killers will do that after a 2/3 gen chase. Yeah buddy, you sure showed me...
---
Thank you for the TED Talk, Meg.
---
i literally got a warning message off of playstation the other day for numerous reports. turns out it was the 4 spanish swf who i beat the other day who had all reported me simultaneously for 'abusive/racial messages' when i literally did nothing of the sort. 
---
i didnt play unfairly or camp at all, i just got a 4k which pissed them off that much they all had to separately mesasge me telling me how shit i was and that they were going to report me. utterly pathetic.
---
Changed mine and no issues yet
---
People don't seem to realize if I have high wind up add-ons on huntress, you're basically fcked and cant wind the standoffs, I threw a hatchet on a guy sitting on the hatch and he jumped and I grabbed him as the hatchet animation is quicker than the meele one
---
Don't  harass me and blame of lag switcher  in steam comments or post chat if you don't know about that.
---
It does.
---
Idk i don't find nurse that bad... But i do play on console so that might explain
---
No it doesn't. Xaoyu described why it is the superior option which raises everyone's survival chances. It is 1V4 for a reason. The four have to play as a team. They have different win conditions than killers for this very reason. This is the reason they have shittier perks and less individual power. Survival chances of a survivor is directly contigent on the survival of the other survivors.
---
True. And survivors have no obligation to let you catch and kill them so they should use everything at their disposal such as cheap flashlights, looping, body blocking, cheap ass perks etc.
---
bruh. I was surv main but when i played killer I sworn to destroy the teabaggers . thats the story of me being legion main

---
I actually don't think I've had a single survivor do this and not disconnect the second they go down
---
having played both sides i only really view tunnelling as when youre actively ignoring/avoiding others to go for someone youve already hooked. 
---
the other day i saw a killer run around me, who was injured, just to get to my friend they had hooked earlier and start chasing them instead.

It's an honest case of "Don't hate the player hate the game." It's entirely on Behavior to fix unfun or overpowered mechanics and you shouldn't handicap yourself just because of some arbitrary notion of "ethics" and "fair play."

What if i have all of them?
---
I think, the devs are the entity.
---
If we‚Äôre talking top level survivors who are actively using their time well and don‚Äôt spend half the game crouching around, then it would make survivors even stronger.  One extra gen doesn‚Äôt equal 1 survivor.
---
I usually say scummy
---
Man if only there was a perk to stun the Killer if they down you and pick you up in a certain amount of time after being unhooked...
---
Yes, I need to level up so many killersonly like 4 done

If you need help setting it up lmk I will do a tutorial.

1. Farming isn't fun at all for me.
---
2. I play the killer in a game like DBD to kill the other players. That's fun to me. It's less fun when 2 of the quit, so I decide to end it quickly to move on to the next game.
---
You should read the rest of the comments, then
---
Ever considered the other side of the coin? How is it fun for the Killer to sit in a corner and let the Survivors survive because "doyyyyy me not supposed to hook a Survivor more than once it no fun."

Quoting my comment to your other comment.
---
Since when anything you do ingame - toxic?
---
Only bug abuses and chat can be toxic.
---
I meannnn I like it like that xD if I rank up I might won't face campers and tunnelers :D
---
Can't get karma that way
---
No. I play Nurse a lot, I know what she can do, I get scared, nervous but also excited
---
If they wait for longer than thirty seconds, you might as well start pretending to be afk
---
YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE TREE IN SHELTER WOODS TO GET OFF BALANCED LANDING. I REALIZE THAT IS THE ONLY "LEDGE" IN THE MAP BUT IT'S REALLY KIND OF BS. AND IF THE DEVS DON'T WANT TO REMOVE IT, FINE, BUT JUST ADD SOMETHING THERE SO THAT IT ISN'T SO JARRING TO SEE A SURVIVOR FLOAT UP A TREE AND BL AWAY.
---
Oh no what will I do.
---
Looks like you depipped
---
People who think by using an addon your NOT good at the game, because they hate that addon/addon combo
---
Waaaaaaaaaah
---
MoM doesn't counter instadowns from healthy state
---
Or, as it turns out, not everyone wants to slog through that type of game.
---
Tell Tale was great at making stories, but excuse me if "Quick Time Event the Game" isn't something I'd give money for.
---
Billy is my favorite, we go way back. I started with him prestiged him first, legacy, completed him first. The chainsaw takedown is super satisfying, feelsgoodman. The way he walks is funny, hammer is satisfying on impact and he's got the creepy white eyes. He also has so many different outfits which are 'normal' compared to the other killers to the point that I started seeing him as a fashionistaaa
---
But I also enjoy Clown a lot, so fun to chase people with him. He laughs, he juggles, he wheezes ...
---
Nurse: So satisfying to catch a survivor in two blinks after first spotting him, you try to pick him up and...he DC's. They're like NOPE FUCK THAT. Or the blink grab survivor when he was about to jump into the hatch. Sometimes I just float towards them not blinking at all to make them nervous, because they know that it's coming but don't know when.
---
Piggy: adorables noises, fun stealth gameplay, beartraps remind me of events (without the plants or event hooks etc)
---
Legion: Simply because it's basically just a person with a knife. They never did that before. It's the most realistic monster we've got so far. I love it.
---
DCing makes it impossible to do anything as killer or survivor. 3 man 1dc groups get fucked and as killer unless you hook survivors 3 times each at that point, no iradescent devout for you. And that's not counting more than 1 dc. That's my biggest issue other than chaser points.
---
But... but muh personal rules for how everyone should play
---
So that pretty much [B]eletes the one fucken thing that let us know if she's nearby...
---
I got a 3k yesterday and I still depiped :(
---
You've hit the nail on the head. We shouldn't be telling other players to play worse because we don't like a particular mechanic, we should be asking the devs to change/remove the mechanic.
---
Yes I agree I want 6 months of no new content in a game with only 1 objective that gets really repetitive.
---
Well, if you have headphones, it's fairly easy to hear her footfalls while she's phasing. Also, you can usually trace her with bent grass or disturbed crows... but sometimes you can't! It's a crapshoot just like everything else in this game
---
I burn out when I grind a killer to prestige 3 after it comes out. I did it twice. Spirit, 1 day. Took weeks break. Legion 2 days. I took Months break lol. Also Legion is p3 now but lvl 1, how silly is that
---
No they don't HAVE to but the nice ones choose to :)
---
We are cancer*

Well said

I feel like Rick wouldn't work anymore, to be honest. I can't say for later seasons, but The Walking Dead (Comic Book) and The Walking Dead (TV show) were completely different early on, to the point where I hated characters in the show that I loved in the comic. If Show Rick comes in, then the Comic fans are disappointed and vice versa.
---
Clementine and Lee are pretty much the only universally loved characters in the franchise.
---
Dunno,bug? (We're talking about dbd so definitely)
---
Lol that‚Äôs funny ‚ÄúQuick Time Event the Game‚Äù Kudos
---
Wtf, Devour hope isn't crutch. It's my favourite perk, but like, 80% of the time it's gone before/straight after 1 token
---
Yeah if the skillcheck appears at the end of the circle, the killer can still hook you. Idk if the devs even know about this bug :s
---
The Oink never gets old. Piggy rocks. It cracks me up when you try to pick up a survivor and mid way he DC's, it's like he's struggling and you're like "Stop Resisting!". As much as it makes me laugh, I still report them. You never know :c
---
Yes.
---
Artifact I‚Äôm pretty sure are cosmetics that are exclusive to some people like streamers.

Someone from Until Dawn for ps4 as a replacement for Bill
---
I was so confused üòü
---
I dunno, people ask the same thing about teabagging all the time so maybe your answer lies there
---
Unfortunately I'm on PS4, and undoubtedly along with a ton of other colorblind players, I can't just install a plug-in like that
---
THANK YOU SOMEONE FUCKI SAID IT THE GRIND IS TOO MUCH
---
Lol. Unless the Legion is braindead and was born a day before the match, they will hit you in frenzy because they have no cooldown and are at ~130% speed. That's what "not having a counter" means.
---
*actually just someone‚Äôs anus*
---
Refering to Legion as "Tim"
---
Honestly I think this is a great idea.
---
ha yes because ranking up killer is very very hard
---
Thank you sir. You survive my next test.
---
Operation Health was "bad" for siege and often memed for being one of the worst attempts to balance the game.
---
Tldr every update is Operation Health
---
legion
---
Yeah but i feel like they should use the original material. Getting a twd license and NOT using it for the OG series is such a waste and bit insulting to be frank. I mean we got remake freddy instead of the original one and everyone is still content with it so it wouldn't be that much fuss. And they aren't that different either.
---
Except this is an issue on PC as well.
---
true is so overconfident and overrated, hes not even that good, just mediocre. and he gets completely shit on by a semi decent swf and wont admit anything. like he bulllshits so much its annoying af
---
You guys really need to stop fucking normalising the idea that disconnecting because you don't like the choice of killer is ever acceptable.
---
I'm happy you play the game then but my last few days have been filled with extreme camping/face camping and slugging everyone.
---
i always escape vs legion. Hes so easy.
---
Referring to Legion as a bunch of survivor chavs who happen to have found a knife.
---
But yeah I‚Äôll stop telling people.
---
The argument is a fallacy because there are 4 survivors and one killer per match.
---
Bring back Lee
---
Killer mains: omg I got 4 self cares in my game I'm gonna kms why are survivor mains op
---
Also killer mains: lol self care is such a trash perk you waste so much time healing lol noob survivors
---
:0
---
So it‚Äôs an actual game problem?
---
She brings in the beads you say? What kind of beads ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I like how you can hear the heartbeat getting closer ^(again)
---
I like the eye
---
To be completely fair if it is that easy to bypass you, you weren't helping your pal anyways.  Flat out body block them, and if they STILL hit your friend than you wasted enough time to stop them from doing that.
---
They only changed survivor.
---
oh shit yeah, i‚Äôm tired i forgot
---
To be fair not every killer can get double pips or pip well. Killers have different powers while survivors only rely on perks; not to mention as survivor you can sit in the background and work on gens/totems.
---
No hexes are that great on Freddy IMO. If they get found at the start you have to wait to grab them off even if you make it there in time. DH has worked twice for me but the second anyone knows its location, they will wake themselves up and its gone.
---
Seriously I hate this, I was playing purple ranks as the trapper for daily ritual (I didn't have ruin or noed) I got a 1k but the meg that looped me the whole game afterwards said HAHA GGEZ. God so annoying.
---
Left behind is really an eh perk. Usually if everyone's dead than at least two gens are done and at that point it's better to grab hatch.
---
Not sure but this is the first time someone said it and i thought it was my mouse being broke
---
Kindred, I was gonna try dark sense but I‚Äôm not good at drawing people. Thanks tho!
---
What others said, prayer beads removes the whooshing sound you hear when she's phasing and you're outside her husk's terror radius.
---
The best way to run it is with the Father-Daughter Ring addon, and some, one, or all of the following perks: Discordance, Surveillance, and Monitor and Abuse. Then you sneak as close as you can to a generator without letting them hear your terror radius, then phase and zoom in super fast, move around the generator to feel what side people are on, rematerialise and grab someone off it. You can even do it without looking directly at the gen, so Spine Chill doesn't trigger. They get no warning and there's no counter.
---
Hmmm
---
What kind of mouse do you have?
---
hrrrrnngghh Colonel, I'm trying to sneak around but I'm dummy thicc and the clap from my ass cheeks keeps alerting the myers
---
Yeah, that's great and all, except for the 50% of the time the killer is directly in that hitbox and it still doesn't stun them so you just die.
---
Videos here to show I'm not just bullshitting: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/56688/fix-head-on
---
If you tunnel off hook or camp, you should still be executed
---
You can hear a phasing spirit's footsteps while you're working on a gen?
---
I completely agree. RPB is ridiculously good with Z block and NOT with m+a. I see a lot of people use it so they have 0 terror radius but having only 8 metres while in a chase means you can basically see them at all times and easily mindgame around all sorts of walls.
---
Sometimes. But my headphones are noise-canceling, so ymmv.
---
That's what it says on the end screen
---
:(
---
Yeah and maybe try to fake pallets, just a little tip to help you conserve the pallets.
---
Ive gotten the samething more than a few times
---
Well, when I played the game for the first time I thought that hitting hooked survivors will speed up the entity, then I got confused when they were flaming me after the match
---
Jason has been requested since the beginning of DBD, but F13 has the license in use in their own game, so we couldn‚Äôt get it.
---
It's to focus your eyes on the dong.
---
if u only stay in the background u wont rly rank up. lets be real
---
Clearly not. Two perks in the game reward for taking hits.
---
Gwoovy OwO
---
The thing is, you want to keep the early gens alive as long as possible since two gens poppijg early will Kill your gen pip
---
Nah the entity has more than one braincell.
---
You're right, the only things I get really pissed off at the killers / survivors about is when they're super toxic and say smth like "ggez" or tbag at the exit gates or behind pallets... Or when someone plays legion
---
I don't mind camping so much because it IS a "legit strategy" but what I don't like is when other survivors still swarm the hook instead of doing gens and all get downed. Survivors aren't your friends. This is still a 1v5 game weather you're playing survivor or killer
---
WHY CAN'T I SENSE TOXICITY IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE!
---
jason has always been requested but it will never happen
---
I had a match a few days ago when the whole team were like toxic potatoes (toxic people that think they are good but are terrible). So I killed three of them (who where also annoying as f ) and let the last one do some gens, farm some pallets and  get chase bp just because was the one who was really trying to play.
---
I think that even is the Killer's job to kill everyone, feels nice to make others experience good. This survivor I let scape thru the hatch was really fucked because of his teammates when he really wanted to try. This wasn't his fault and I commit my objective killing the other idiots. At least, his time was worth.
---
Same thing happened to me with my level 1 Meyers. 
---
Congrats on ‚Äúrunning‚Äù me. Never mind the fact that I‚Äôd constantly stalk you and the other survivors you ran past to try and squeeze 4 level ups in the game. 
---
You really got me. /s
---
Let's hope there's no honeydew.
---
Stop being a little bitch then
---
Despite the silly complaining he does sometimes, those videos are very satisfying to watch cause watching a good player just dick on a group of survivors all using good flashlights for saves and all copycat meta builds gets even funnier when one or more DC cause they got outplayed.
---
Man you really are good with playing along with a joke don't you?
---
Two to three weeks is a long lifespan for memes.
---
The average meme in the wild lasts a few days.
---
Ruin is very good on him. Granted ruin is good on everyone.
---
i know... same
---
:3
---
Forgive me, but I just got the plague- what's this post about? (No salt if ya don't mind- I'm legit curious)
---
I always approach the hatch stealthily if the killer is already stood over it. Sometimes they‚Äôll panic and hit me or hit me on purpose, allowing me to escape. Other times we‚Äôll stand off until one of us gets bored. When I was a baby survivor at ranks 20-16, I didn‚Äôt know you could be grabbed off the hatch... So when killers took me to it, dropped me on it and then grabbed me back off it, I lost my shit. lol
---
In fact I find easier play as killer than being a survivor. Who rules the match is always the killer. He decides if you live or not, or if you play or not.
---
If he facecamps, you don't play.
---
If he tunnels and you are not a scaping-chase god, you don't play.
---
Once you are catch, if the killer doesn't want you to enjoy, you don't do it either.

So relatable, to all the killers I tea bagged or taunted, forgive me for being such an ass since I can now relate your pain ever since I started playing killer last night
---
BBQ, Ruin, M&amp;A, Flex is usually my go to load out. For the flex perk it's really up to you. Can be something to help loops like bamboozle, enduring, or brutal strength. Or another utility perk like nurses, sloppy, or make your choice.
---
I know right? It is about as bad as tbagging.
---
I was playing LF with no NOED or RUIN.  All 5 gens popped and I downed an Adam. Instead of doing what LF does best (facecamping) I go around to see if I can catch more survivors. 
---
Adam gets saved and then t bags at the exit gate.
---
D: i'm sorry, man, feel ya
---
God I wish that were me.
---
the plague makes people sick :D
---
The bot part can hurt you mentally though
---
Spine chill doesnt work either lol
---
Wow- I just got wooshed.
---
I'm torn on it. I wish they would rework it so it's less reliant on RNG.
---
I‚Äôve had this game for 2 weeks and the survivors are such cry baby bitches. Every game somebody messages me complaining that I killed them no matter how I play the match, they really just want you to LET them win....
---
AAAA NICE &lt;3
---
I live bubbas bloody cosmetics, looks super cool
---
Nice! That‚Äôs pretty rare with the new system.
---
Literally just a shitty pun. She went of to proceed on a multiple message rant about how adrenaline is so OP and how her running no-ed isn't that bad. 
---
I feel like I'm obliged to say that it's fine to use no-ed, you can counter it by just walking around the map and knowing totem spawns. Or not knowing them! Adrenaline isn't OP though.
---
Yes? Whats the point really here?
---
You gotta put yourself in their shoes. They might have a 30% escape rate at best so when they actually win the dopamine rush is so great that they lose all inibition and their ego takes command, thus having to shit talk in end-chat. I usually just say "kk" and move on, knowing that they're gonna get face camped for their next 5 games :D
---
Shoulda clarified if it was a joke with the community being as salty as it is that is something someone coulda legit said out of toxicity
---
I can't stop laughing, the tittle is brutal xDDDDDDDDDDD
---
oh, naturally both sides to blame. but i don't understand why would you bm, specifically bm, when killer is playing like a good boy letting you get all the emblems
---
yea I was surprised cause I wasnt even going for it
---
Not even close. Played all day yesterday with 30-45 second queues. If you play past 9-10 (EST) it undeniably takes longer, but you'll still find matches with patience and a half decent internet connection.
---
So because he didn't play the games yet and doesn't want any spoilers he is a little bitch?
---
I didn't say this in my other comment, but I said it was a shitty joke in chat right before the Adrenaline OP rant. She wasn't that bad of a plague either, getting 3k with only one no-ed down and last getting hatch.
---
Are we back to posting useless *4 iridescent* posts even if still is against sub rules?
---
Exactly, it turns good killers into toxic killers like the rest of them, and then survivors complain.
---
sToP tUnNeLiNg mE!
---
And btw I think it is pretty obvious he was joking
---
Ah ok gotcha i just read the post and understood with context but otherwise just seemed like your average toxic comments
---
I don't always do it, but this two are why I would dc.
---
I didnt realize it was against the rules. I posted it because I thought it was rare because of the new ranking system. No need to be rude :)
---
If you aren't ranking up or getting double pips constantly then that means you've reached the rank that you belong at. I had no trouble double pipping with any killer and trashy perks  most of the time.
---
Yeah, it's not just Ash doing it, had it with David a few days ago. I hope they fix it.
---
&gt;I didnt realize it was against the rules. I posted it because I thought it was rare because of the new ranking system. No need to be rude :)
---
No need to post useless shit but that didn't stop you. 4 iridescent is not that rare, specially outside rank 1.
---
Yea same, I got so used to relying on premonition and one game I suddenly got massacred by this Myers that just walked all the way up to me without triggering premonition or making any sounds.
---
But will it make you play Legion though? ;)
---
Evader=Evade=Stay Hidden from the killer
---
o and if you were looping the killer without breaking chase then all the points gathered will go to him when he catches you
---
6 months playing this game on a daily basis and I've never DC'd. DCing is for bitches; it's a game about dying, do your best and if you die get over it and do better next match.
---
It's really situational though. It depends on why exactly the chase is going on so long. Killer errors, survivor skill, bad map for the killer, etc.? Personally, if I see someone going to a window loop that I'll need bloodlust to catch, I break it off immediately, but I play Freddy so that might just be me.
---
I mean there is no point in conserving pallets at this point
---
So *thiiiiis* is how the three other Survivors go down in the same 20 meter area while I'm still trying to fix the first generator.
---
I've always wondered how that happens exactly.
---
again, you take it way to personally. Try to talk about it without using insult or feeling concerned and you'll find the truth and the peace in your mind.
---
Wtf that's not cool dude
---
The Kazoo Kid techno remix makes the video.
---
What could she be reporting them for? Camping? Smh
---
**_And I just sit here sipping my coffee playing Identity V because my laptop is Jack shit with playing DBD_**
---
Monto: referring to everyone as him
---
When i run WGLF I don't unhook people for the stack. I play like normal and whatever I get is just extra. I see it as getting more blood points for having one less perk to use.
---
exactly its way harder to level survivor thats why they did fine by making it easier. but killer didnt really want a change at all
---
Same. I'm not not going to go after an unhooked survivor if they're the one I see and can get to. I also don't give the last survivor the hatch unless their teammates screwed them. If I can get 4K, I'm getting 4K.
---
I like playing as legion too, they are a lot of fun and like you said slow the game down at the same time. I play survivor too and don‚Äôt mind playing against them, I‚Äôd rather play legion then billy with ruin and doctor annoys me more then legion tbh lol
---
As long as they aren‚Äôt using the moonwalking and to an extent franks since I see that as just a strong add on that‚Äôs not different from other killers strong add ons. I‚Äôve lost legions in chase and most in my experience don‚Äôt tunnel me down they usually want to hit a bunch of survivors so as long as it‚Äôs not just you around I‚Äôm usually just a hit and run victim. 
---
I understand why people don‚Äôt like them tho since the chases are different then normal and you can‚Äôt really use thrown down pallets as barriers etc but if they don‚Äôt have franks and have to down you with just frenzy attacks it definitely kills time and let‚Äôs your team (hopefully) do gens and punish the legion for wasting all that time
---
Or maybe just double the cap potential
---
I quite enjoy that you quoted that, but conveniently left out the next reply I made in that very same thread that I disliked tunneling/camping, but still used it due to the prevalence of extreme toxicity and BM back then before Decisive was nerfed. That being said though, I was pissed at everything back then due to just being diagnosed with Crohn's and looking at possible colon cancer as a double whammy. I've since come to terms with a lot of things and changed my mind on a lot. That includes many facets of dbd, killer etiquette, etc. I have Legion P3 Lvl 50, but I don't even touch him anymore due to how people dislike playing against regardless of if I refuse to use lame shit like moonwalking or Frank's Mixtape. Same reason I stopped playing Nurse, because people hated it and I felt bad doing it. Now I really only play Pig, maybe Trapper or something if I get bored of her. I also treat people a hell of a lot better, in the same manner I detailed above because I know what its like to get fucked over by OP stuff. This is supplemented by the fact that DS is practically gone, so most rude survivors ceased all hyper-rude strats, not that I'd treat them poorly regardless these days. Sorry pal, the troll you're hunting died before you wrote this up. I practice what I've preached here.
---
Noone likes as A survivor to Play against A Killer that camps or tunnels when they can dc just Play another game whats more survivors dont like to Play against A guy that in lobby has 60ms but in game it feels like 500ms 
---
Those are main reasons why People dc's
---
Yes, I play Legion! I think they're cool. 
---
You aren't alone in liking them.
---
That said...
---
&gt;I understand survivors view of it not being fun to go up against, **but killers have to deal with tons of un fun stuff as well**.
---
I wholeheartedly disagree with this logic. 
---
Just because one person has to put up with BS and/or nonsense doesn't mean that other people should too. "An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind."
---
I really enjoy getting hits with Pigs ambush attack. Ita very satisfying
---
I know, but bringing you to a hook right next to an open hatch while there were two on the way is just cruel
---
Wrong. Killer is here to present danger to Survivors. An avoidable danger, to keep things interesting. Unavoidable danger won't attract players, because we're playing for fun, no matter what you might be thinking about it. This is how gameplay works.
---
Abilities means perks I think. Myers in EW1 and Freddy outside the dream world are powers not abilities
---
Yes, exactly. I dont even know why people give a fuck about spoilers anyway. But Spoiler alert Germany lost ww2.
---
When we have to deal with frenzy and ruin it makes it impossible to get any progress done so that's my reason for disliking most legions i face. I don't dc because bloodpoints are bloodpoints. I'm still new enough to not know what all perks do so not gonna complain too much unless stuff is over the top.
---
Please consider this devs.
---
I don't mind a bit of slugging here and there but slugging 24/7 and everyone? yea I can smell the sweatyness all the way over here.
---
2016, we were stupid against hillbilly. He slugged us and brought a ebony Mori, when you didn't have to hook someone before using the Mori. So the game was like 2 min.
---
Could be that she didn't want the huntress noticing her crawling away. That's the only thing I can think of.
---
DBD subreddit: The killer‚Äôs job is to kill, not to make sure the survivors have fun
---
Also DBD subreddit: Anyone who plays Legion should be put to death because he isn‚Äôt fun to face.
---
I don‚Äôt get all the hate towards Legion. The infinite mending and Frank‚Äôs Mixtape obviously suck, but other than those, I actually really enjoy going against Legion. His power is very strong for 1v1, but it‚Äôs a team game. If he wastes his time smacking me 4 times, that‚Äôs great. My team has plenty of time to do generators.
---
Playing as Legion is alright as well. I‚Äôve only used him in a couple of matches, but using Frenzy to vault is a great feeling.
---
Won't happen, he has his own game and it's garbage
---
That‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read. If you play killer, you kill people. It‚Äôs not fucking tag on a playground.
---
That's pure catharsis
---
I translated it through just about every language there is and only succeeded in removing the s.
---
If you dont think only downing everyone 24/7 isnt sweaty then I dont know what to tell you man gl in game
---
Cuz survivors taunt and tease you either way, so what's the point of being nice?
---
Do you really think 3k is a lose and 4k a win? Lose to me is when I can't hook a single survivor entire match.
---
Beep, boop, boop, bop, boop, boop, bop?
---
Yes, you are.  
---
That's actually reverse Sandbagging? I mean, going in front of a killer while another surv is trying to get him away?
---
But why would you not go for the full victory? I don‚Äôt understand the fabricated chivalry of this community.
---
Ha! Dickhead had it coming
---
One DCing trash-person and two dead potatoes for teammates, and you still managed to pull off a stylish escape. Well done!
---
Spine Chill works on Freddy either way (not sure about premonition), EW1 is the only exception afaik
---
My issue with this is it's the definition of a bird in one hand is worth 2 in the bush. Why should I abandon a chase of a survivor I've found just because 2 gens popped somewhere else? If I stop chasing the one and try to find the other 2, I'll most likely just end up with nothing. It's not like they'll be hanging out at the popped gen, waiting for me to take a swing at them. And what do you think the one I was chasing is going to do? Go work on a gen. So now all three of them are free to work on gens. 
---
If the player I'm chasing is just running me in circles to the point where I feel I'm wasting time then I might relent and find someone else when gens pop. But I'm not going to stop chasing someone no matter what JUST because one of the other 3 players got a gen done.
---
Especially considering how he seems to be a killer and not a surv, then again both sides complain and whine and bm
---
That‚Äôs me when I see a survivor getting downed literally within 5 seconds.
---
The streamer here is far from being some saint of kindness and, unless they're reporting for unsportsmanlike behavior, they have no real reason to report you.
---
However, you repeatedly BM'ed them and camped them to the death in a game with only 3 Survivors. Did you expect them to be happy to about it?
---
Not always true, sometimes the game does the work for them
---
Assuming everyone is toxic and responding in a toxic way isnt really helping lowering the amount of toxic players now is it
---
MoM too op, pls nerf, it works on multiple survs, devs did a good job so far /s

The fact they put so much effort into saving an urban evasion/spine chill/P3 claudette is what‚Äôs most admirable.
---
Not chivalry, I'm a main survivor and I know that as killer you have fun killing and as survivor you have fun escaping, so I try my best to have half the fun killing some and letting one of them havinh full fun, at the end is 1/1 havinh half fun and 1/4 having full fun, actually I always laugh most when I farm the last one
---
Myself
---
Nope
---
Though, tbh it went the opposite way for me lol. Rank 20 I was a force with her, rank 10 I was having to deal with better survivors who knew what to do so I lost some steam. Rank 1 I was basically useless against survivors because of all the felxboxes, instapacks, and bright lights. Then I started getting teachable perks and using addons. Now I‚Äôm a pretty good nurse for PS4 at least.
---
I like to do the same, I pretend to be a duck in one of the old shooting galleries and just walk back and forth while the hatches fly.
---
honestly, I don't get these posts. I LIKE dead by daylight. I think the mechanics are interesting. Sure it needs some polishing but i'm sure the overall health will improve once the dedicated servers hit.
---
People say that the game is bad, but it isn't. The side things are (perks, rank). Hitboxes glitches are caused by ping and, yeah. I don't know if you guys understand my point.
---
Like, if the game was raw and had only a few perks and add ons, no ranking system (this would be bad, but we usually get potatoes at high ranks)  and less killers (since they need to create more complicated powers now) it would have less things to balance and the game would be better.
---
Because immersion.
---
Survivors are not worth buying with real money because they are all the same. Jeff's perks are too situational for me. You can buy just the Hag with iridiscent shards, and Ace' perks are useless. Legion is banned and Ash is good only for MoM.
---
Well but that's part of improving as a killer, being able to recognize when it's worth continuing the chase or not. Certainly I don't give up solely because gens pop, but it absolutely affects my evaluation of how long I can allow the chase to continue to be worth it, and deciding if I think I can win in that time.
---
&gt;After that game it always makes me wonder what's the point in not playing like a dick 
---
Exactly. Even though I don't ever play like a dick as killer, you know damn well that most survivors will be dicks at the end of the game *and* in chat.
---
It says in myers description that at T1 he has immunity to decection perks, but yeah i do agree that premonition is misleading, the reason is probably because it was out before myers and no other killer has immunity to dectection perks, they need to update the text
---
Ash
---
Yeah but for future matches
---
my friends i just said mine bc my friend didnt have a reddit account and i help√•ed him advertise
---
Sometimes it's down to a choice on the specific player too. 
---
If I notice that one survivor is way better than the other 3 I'll target them any chance I get to knock them out early on, especially if they're good at hiding. 
---
I'm not going to waste time downing the worst player whose injured since I'll run into them again in like 30 seconds anyway.
---
Seeing survivors compete to out- toxic one another is the oddest thing. Youd think having a huge hatchet throwing rabbit lady trying to kill you would be enough make people work together for once, but its things like this that lead me to believe the human race is doomed.
---
Eh, being toxic in response to direct toxicity (so not toxicity by someone last game causing your toxicity this game) is pretty reasonable, and I say that as one of the vocal anti-tunneling people here.
---
Why apologise after correcting someone? You're doing them a favour.
---
And killers have more ability to actually prevent someone from being able to play in the first place, which to me is the most toxic thing someone can do. The only equivalent is swf on comms who tell each other where the killer is so the killer can never find anyone. There is nothing else survivors can do to prevent the killer from actually playing.
---
Yeah I gotchu, but why do you make it sound like you're giving the survivor team a favor by not using Ruin/NOED?
---
Yeah my favorite salty survivor was some guy who messaged me when the game started. 
---
"Either kill everyone and let me escape, or kill me and everyone else escapes." 
---
I was a little confused but I took it as a self sacrifice thing like maybe he's just trying to maximize blood points? So I took the kinder option and just killed him. I watched the survivors do the rest of the gens and escape. APPARENTLY he was trying to shit talk how good he was saying he was so good it would take all game to get him and that I shouldn't even try, because he sent some unkind messages back about me tunneling and guarding him. No regrets.
---
Hag = hex:Ruin slow the game down just a lil bit 
---
Also devour is fun but risky 
---
Third seal is knockout on steroids
---
Ok man, whatever you say. What a coincidence that you found your "friend's" YouTube channel somehow
---
Then what if we have 2 more gen
---
Why wouldn't you play to win? Obviously having fun is the priority, but nobody loads up the game saying to themselves "Today I'm just gonna lose because I feel like it."
---
You made this? I love it!
---
dude im just trying to help him get his channel a good start
---
If this happens, as a killer I just approach to farm at that point. It's not even a challenge with 5 gens still up and 2 dead.
---
I'm newish, but the "ethics" in this game make little sense for killers.
---
I'll never just sit in front of a hook. I'll always hook, then checkout a nearby generator or two.
---
**But**, well over 50% of the time after I hook, there will be a survivor there to unhook literally within under 10 seconds.
---
So I always stay within 5-10 seconds distance to the hook.
---
I don't see how this is the same as survivors **intentionally** trying to grief/troll me and make my experience miserable, or holding the game hostage.
---
Again, I get how straight up sitting in front of the hook is bad, but I feel like so many survivors basically consider it trolling if you don't let them get immediately unhooked.
---
Referring to Legion as "Yeah we gonna have a grand gaming experience"
---
How did you do that? I have no idea how to get a flair
---
I feel like such a weird one, because I am super against early camping and tunneling, and will always farm if there is an early DC, but I have absolutely no hesitation to get the 4K if I can. I don't pout like a lot of killers on this sub do if I don't get that last one, but I'll also at least try for it.
---
Playing only solo as well and man, i like these games so much. If people who dc would understand this possibility and experience it themselves, i think they could learn to love the game again.
---
Both are great but I prefer Discordance. The start of the match is where I'm under the most pressure and being able to crush an early 3 man gen can save a lot of hassle.
---
Surveillance is really nice but relies on stopping to kick the gen. It's excellent in a 3 gen at the end but if you just want to chase a survivor you find on a gen the perk ends up going to waste.
---
It's also surprising how many times you can catch 2 people on a gen before they realise you're running discordance.
---
Since when is using ruin considered toxic???
---
This is a low effort meme but I like it because I like GTA:SA üòÇ
---
Tinkerer (/s)
---
If you have the beads that make your haunting silent I'd use discordance, otherwise I'd probably pick surveillance.
---
Thank you for mentioning it, if I am not playing sweaty, then don't act like you own the match and don't leave when the doors are opened
---
I hate it when survivors drop a pallet and constantly slide over it to annoy me when exit gates are opened like taunting me
---
Get the fuck out of my game
---
Yes, and I hope they don't forget about South America, cuz its fucking annoying when they gorget about us, Brazilians, and the Spanish-speaking countries.
---
Dude, don't bring your mom into this
---
Seriously? So I take it you've never played the game with your friends and you were one member short, so you joined in with a random that farmed the shit out of you, played like a complete chode, disconnected after getting down 20 seconds into the match, etc.?  
---
  
---
Getting a random player to join you, that not only doesn't suck but is also the guy that carries the whole team, is a rarity in DbD.
---
yeah, especially when ruin is still up.
---
That was so satisfying. Instant karma.
---
i bet u got a doc game
---
I wish they added a feature where you can mute survivors in the lobby so you don‚Äôt see their chats at the end of the game, would make me doing killer dailies or playing killer in general way more enjoyable
---
If you get tunnelled off hook you can use the new DS and then you‚Äôll get an extra hit towards your MoM
---
I try to do this for Huntress players, but the second you go inside the gate I'm out. I'm not letting you touch me when I don't know if you have NOED
---
For me there's about a 80% chance the game will crash if I bring a cake. Not even kidding.
---
Honestly the only thing that gets me as a killer is the BM teabagging survivors do.  
---
But then again Killers facecamp or hit after hook as their version of BMing, one of which ruins the game for one of the survivors so... I get it.  
---
But it still pisses me off.
---
Its a video game.  Leave the political bullshit out of it. Theyre all fucked in the head.
---
Sorry, i didn't intend to make you angry or anything. I play solo like 98% of the time so i am always depending on my team, if they're swf or not. I just thought that a bit more editing, maybe fitting to the beat of the music, could've helped to improve your point. no hate :)
---
I‚Äôd love enduring tbh. Or PGTW. I really don‚Äôt wanna dump a couple million BP into killers I don‚Äôt play for em
---
I've only played against 1 good nurse on console. 4K before the second gen was done.
---
Also take into account that to power up Mettle Of Man he had to have been hit 3x by the melee attack. The hatchet throws don't count towards Mettle Of Man. So you can safely assume that The Huntress player was just horsing around.
---
&gt;If I ran into the old me ingame right now, I'd be singing the same tune I am now. 
---
Have to admit I didn't expect that answer. Kudos to you 
---
&gt;I know for a fact no matter what I write here, I'm still gonna log in tomorrow and have 10 bad matches for every 1 good one because that's the nature of the game balance.
---
I hope you're exaggerating on purpose here. If you really think you're playing  against a dickhead killer who kills you too early 9 out of 10 times you either need to grow thicker skin, are beyond  terrible at the game that you are always sticking out as the easiest target, or are a super toxic survivor, though I wouldn't expect you to be the latter after complaining about toxicity.
---
&gt;As for the double hooking thing, yes, I do consider it an offense, because at that point, congrats, you get to do nothing useful for the rest of the match after only 2 minutes in. Doing a gen? Nah, of course the killer's gonna see the easy sacrifice and tunnel you even more to give themselves an easy edge and steamroll the rest of the match.
---
Probably my fault, but we do have a tiny misunderstanding here. My question meant to imply that the hypothetical killer does not do these things, and starts going for other survivors after the double hook
---
&gt;If only survivors had a way to easily snowball early game and secure an easy win, like an instant gen repair or two, oh wait, they nerfed it into the dirt because it was OP
---
BNP's deserved to be gutted, they were super OP and unhealthy for the game. But I think the same way about moris
---
&gt; Except killer tunneling hasn't received the same treatment, despite being in the same vein
---
You are comparing an addon to a playstyle, hard to give it the same treatment when they are literally two entirely different things. 
---
You also seem to have missed the meta change. With the DS rework and the new MoM perk thing you can make yourself close to untunnable. 
---
Imagine you get unhooked, killer goes for the tunnel. You use Dead Hard to "block" the first hit, then probably go down again. Then your DS procs so you negate a second hit. Killer gets giga enraged, hits you again, but oh wait, assuming a basic M1 killer you will have gotten hit three times by the time you use DS so it's time for MoM to come in hot to block another hit. At that point your Dead Hard may actually be up again. I am aware that's pretty much the best case scenario, but the tools are there, and to say BHVR isn't at least trying to make things better is simply not true
---
Now, from the way I argue you probably think I'm a sweaty killer main who goes for the tunnel every game, but the truth is I play survivor like 2/3 of my games and usually don't tunnel, unless you're overly toxic and/or farm your teammates. I fully understand how it's the right thing to take everyone's fun into consideration, but here lies the problem for me :
---
While survivors make sure to make you feel horrible if you don't value their fun as high or even higher than your own and bitch about perks/addons/playstyle, they never have the decency to take the killer's fun into their consideration. 
---
I did a doctor daily earlier and since I didn't wanna play the boring  impossible skillcheck build (because  survivors hate it) I decided to try stealth doctor and guess what happened?  After they realised I ran an off meta build they went full bully mode. Called me super bad trash killer, even though I still killed three of them with a meme build on one of the worst killers in the game.
---
Being nice to the other side should be a two-way street, but with the way most survivors behave you are almost guaranteed to recieve less than you give, so every game makes me care less and less
---
I slug the last two one, I get really pissed when the last escspe without my consent
---
What a dick move
---
Body blocking is 100% encouraged. Its even added to the emblem system that you get points for taking a hit while a killer is carrying a survivor. Its only in your mind because it doesnt work in your favor that you think its unacceptable.
---
Precisely.
---
?
---
Thank you.
---
Not happening.
---
Not gonna lie, this has always irked me lol.
---
Forgiven, child.   
---
Your killer game penance is:
---
\-20 fruitless loop chases
---
\-10 DS'ings
---
\-10 MoM's
---
\-1 Hatch stand off
---
no turning your chat off until you're done.
---
There are a lot of games. Not a lot of time to play them. I'm currently at games up to 2014, still haven't finished Dead Space from 2008, Dragon Age 1 from around that time as well, AC3, Borderlands 2, Witcher 2. That's games from as far as 10 years ago. It's gonna be years upon years until I play a game from 2018. I'm not in a hurry. And by this time many of these games are in a much better state than they were at launch. GOTY Editions with all extra content cost less than the vanilla game did at launch.
---
This is even more relevant for a classical books example. Remarque's "Arch of Triumph" might be 74 years old, but if I still hadn't read it, I wouldn't want to stumble upon a spoiler.
---
Right at the beginning of the vid we can see that the huntress is wiping her blade, probably from just getting the Feng downed. The huntress then tries to pick her up, but notices Ash is getting uncomfortably closer and is injured. She decides 2 people down is better than one and goes for ash. The MoM is u expected and the huntress turns back to Feng, she decides she has enough time to swing again, but of course we know that she doesn't and Feng gets out. If ash wasn't there and didn't have MoM Feng would have died
---
FIX YOUR GOD DAMN LOBBIES. YOU CANT TELL ME NA USERS ALL DRY UP AFTER 9PM EASTERN AND I GET RED TRASH PING FROM NEPTUNE ALL NIGHT.
---
2 MAN AND 3 MAN GAMES ARE GREAT THOUGH, PLEASE NEVER FIX THAT. BEST FEATURE EVER.
---
RELEASE MORE CONTENT AND CONTINUE TO NOT FIX ISSUES.
---
because on high ranks 95% of people run ruin and around 40% do noed plus to it. and it's really annoying for high rank survivors to deal with ruin every single fukin game.
---
How am I angry? I thoroughly explained what the thing you were missing is. :-)  
---
Since you play solo it makes sense that you didn't know what the deal was.
---
MoM feels like DS before the nerf because it's a free hit perk without the killer being able to play around it in any way, shape or form.
---
I had ~2 games to get adept Ash and now I'll never touch that filth perk until they fix it.
---
that cosplay looks amazing
---
Only noobs heal against legion, you're wasting two perk slots
---
did anyone say toxic? wtf?
---
You know it‚Äôs a video game right?
---
So you let a survivor loop you for at minimum 3 whole minutes? That's your fault for continuing the chase and not leaving him and putting pressure elsewhere.
---
Gave 2 lil cuties the chance to come to daddy Myers but when I lifted my hand, they ran away from me. Daddy punishes disobedience very harshly
---
I don't know much about PC but can't they privately message you or write on your timeline?
---
We don't have post game chat on PS4 yet after almost every game,I get a salty PM from someone.
---
Both piss the other side off. Its no different.
---
Dunno bout the pirate as he is a stand user
---
But I‚Äôd love a shipyard map
---
Ah thank you very much. Very much appreciated
---
stop &gt;-&lt;
---
Every killer has a little bit of toxic in them. I‚Äôm good for the most part, but every once in a while all the BM and toxicity gets to me, and I‚Äôll be damned if I don‚Äôt go full toxic mode on a survivor. 
---
I never go into a match feeling toxic, but sometimes you just can‚Äôt control what happens once you actually spawn in.
---
Why did you think there was fall damage? 
---
No damage, just stagger.
---
galaxy brain: referring to myers as 'it'
---
He got downvoted for being a dick.
---
But you do get points for body blocking and getting hit while a killer is carrying a survivor. So, no you dont get points for the rest survivoring but the longer you keep other survivors alive the better your chances are. Not to mention its a team you want the whole team to do well.
---
Just revert the whole system, it's impossible to rank in solos with all the dc, and leavers.
---
Bullshit. I've had plenty of matches as Legion at rank 1 where I only got 2-3. There's tons of variables like SWF, the map and what perks the survivors have. Just because you're terrible doesn't mean Legion is OP. Learn to play. Stop crying and start adapting.
---
To the OP, Legion is fun as hell and I don't feel bad playing them. The cunts who cry about Legion are the same cunts who cried about Freddy and they think that if they keep crying they'll get their way again.
---
illusion 100
---
You don‚Äôt even look behind you when you run, Definitely shouldn‚Äôt be in rank 1.
---
Dude that's totally fine. You just wanna have fun with your SO, so nobody has the right to tell you how to play the game. Have fun. People being frustrated about this playstyle tend to wanna rank up and being to stealthy (which most of the ninjas are) is not optimal for the outcome of the team.   
---
Stealth can pretty much only be helpful to the team in 2 situations.  
---
1: Another survivor is on the hook and you need to unhook him.   
---
2: You make a gen, the killer comes to you and wastes more time searching for you than searching for others OR you being chased for 2 hits.
---
it's annoying seeing every single game same build that are ruin, bbq and two other good meta/clutch perks. just not fun. i run bbq as killer but it's for points, couldn't care less for auras. but damn, every time playing against killer with PGtW and stuff like Rancor i truly enjoy it unlike bbq, enduring, spirit fury, ruin Billy. pretty sure most people, no matter how good they are, are just annoyed with ruin cause it is nothing but annoying. 
---
and btw, i can hit greats as survivor. but sometimes killers have slightly unstable connection and it makes impossible to hit greats cause they're not smooth.
---
There's more survivor posts because there's more survivors. But both sides complain. You just dont notice it as much because you side with them. Both sides cry and bitch about anything that isnt easy for them.
---
I can‚Äôt see them at all on macmillan maps if they have a brown shirt, so yea..
---
You could've also said "When you get The Game after the Killer burns an offering for it"
---
Honestly, every time I see a The Game offering, it's either a Scratched Mirror Myers or an Amanda's Letter Pig.
---
Monto noob and puppers?
---
TEMPBAN SURVIVORS WHO PURPOSELY DC GIVE THEM A WAITING TIMER LIKE LEAGUE DOES SO THEY CANT KEEP DOING IT
---
Fucking stop with this shit. Jason is never making it into dbd
---
Can you really blame them though? If 4 survivors can run meta perks every game then killers should be able to as well
---
Is that even related to what I said or are you trynna flex?
---
And now you kinda seem condescending to me. I actually do understand it, because i have 3 other guys in my team i don't know... but whatever man. good luck with your 4th guy.
---
Challange to make the game as unfun as possible
---
Just want to correct you it‚Äôs the Mother-Daughter Ring. Additionally That build is disgustingly good.
---
you cant
---
I'd rather have the one in a million rando than the player who stands by the pallet self-caring, wastes the pallet and then manages to get downed.

That's a quality job you did on that hook üëçüèº

**I clicked on your profile and read some of your other comments. I found this gem:**  
---
*im a solo survivor at rank 4 close to 3. But i play like the biggest selifsh a-hole there is. Unsafe hook-safes, letting the third survivor die to get the hatch if we cant make all the gens, etc etc. As a solo survivor it is incredibly stressfull and not fun at all to rank up past a certain point.*  
---
**I guess we now know the reason why you didn't know what the deal was. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)**
---
Just when survivors moan about legion they never comment on the unfun stuff they use them selves, it‚Äôs one sided.
---
I agree, we have to use what we have to use, as long as neither side starts bitching about it the gane will make us all play better!
---
I'm not sure I like this community anymore

I need to look into this I havent played in a while but if this behavui ris rewarded I do not understand the incentive behind it. As crouching wirh 3 people before a killer and blocking of a hook is not feeling like the killer poses any threat at all and can be easily disabled by just standing there.

Catching a survivor quickly without having to feel with loops is fun to me ?
---
D A R N
---
**legion bad LOL**
---
Oh no, I'm not assuming. It's literally every game I try to be nice I get shit on. I haven't really even played killer that much recently, but everytime I try to get back into it I get the worst people. I've been playing survivor more and it's the same thing, dickhead killers. I've played for at least 2 years and sure I've had toxic games, but the amount of toxic survivors/killers I've had is the worst I've seen right now. I totally agree with you tho, it just seems like most people don't give a fuck about being dicks and everyone just wants 4 kills/4 escapes no matter what.
---
Like this post states.. when I get pissed off at survivors, Im taking out my Prayerbead spirit
---
Even his posture and pose are different, that's why I like it
---
But SWF does screw over most killers no doubt.
---
So by that logic, camping is good. You are making sure they don't get saved so why not play leatherface and camp?
---
Ok. And how do you stop the gen rush as legion?
---
I have some to.
---
LeatherFace: REEEEEEEE
---
Myers: .....
---
LeatherFace: Reee?
---
Spirit: Got some mommy issues?
---
Huntress: At least my parent didn't kill me.
---
Spirit: Touch√©
---
Pig: Want to play a game?
---
Susie: Like monopolie?
---
Pig: Yes, actually.
---
Meanwhile mk11 gave him a 1inchpunch
---
Again with the chivalry rules. 
---
ItS a DiCk MoVE So DOnT dO iT
---
Of course. Maybe i read into things too much.
---
Why the hell are you getting downvoted for this...
---
Yeah i partially understand the killers complaining a bit ago but this game being balanced is a lot sooner then some people realize now that DS has a easy counter.
---
Ive always hated Liu. Can he just go away
---
You can‚Äôt he‚Äôs to slow.
---
Uh huh.... Well ok then I guess we disagree. I'd say no need to be rude about it but clearly youre not so polite.
---
I mean.. The only downfall of face camping is that the other survivors get to hit all the gens while you‚Äôre standing there, but there‚Äôs nothing morally wrong with it. In no way is the killer obligated to make sure that the survivor lives. Quite the opposite, actually.
---
As long as you don't camp or tunnel, it's always a gg. Rarely are survivors  rude when I play like that.
---
I did that last night, or something similar lol. I was playing Myers and getting wrecked by one survivor while I tried to get my EW2. She was just doing a really good job of staying out of sight, in hindsight I should have broken off lol. She teabagged once I got EW2 so then all bets were off, she was dying and I didn't care if they got all 5 gens lol. I ended up getting a 3k so it worked out ok, she got really pissed in the postgame but I just straight up told her she made me salty so I killed her and they sort of just laughed it off. Sometimes you just gotta be honest lol
---
Wow. That's awesome.
---
The advantage comes with the fact if I'm in the middle of a chase and we run by my hex totem and the person im chasing sees it, then he tells his friends where it is and runs to the other side of the map.  Now I either stay and puppy guard the totem and let him get away, or I continue the chase and let one of his teammates instantly swoop in and kill it.  In the balanced version of the game, killers can keep track of which survivors know their totem locations and try to keep them in chases or on the hook as a way to protect their totem.  I would say it's a bit more than a slight benefit.  Happens to me all the time.
---
lol what 
---
I think your definition of impolite and rude is flawed mate
---
Thank you! But be careful, nor 54321rome will shit on you for saying it, because actually I can't belong to rank1 ahahah
---
So when you tunnel, the other 3 survivors can just do all the gens while you target a single survivor.
---
Are you on ps4? I would absolutely LOVE to watch you try to down me as Legion with your regular attack.
---
Also can I ask what rank you are without seeming rude?
---
I KNOW IM LATE BUT FUCK IT IM JOINING. 
---
IM SO DAMN TIRED OF GOD DAMNED SURVIVORS DEPIPING ON PS4 AND BEING SUPER SWEATY AT RANK 16. CONSTANT BS TOXIC FUCKNUTS THAT I CAN STAND, USUALLY A SWF(THAT I DONT MIND, I RUN SWF TOO) BUT THERES NO NEED TO BE THE SUPER TOXIC FLASHLIGHT, TEABAG, GENRUSH (GENRUSHING IS ALSO FINE, BUT IM PISSED BECAUSE LIKE 3 GENS ARE DONE IN 2 MINS BEFORE I EVEN FIND A SURVIVOR) FUCKING BITCH TITS.

If you're injured, you're only 1 hit away from being hooked.  If killer is a camper, 1 hook might equal death.  Therefore taking that first hit lowers your own survival chance.
---
Respect kobes ? There is no way to know if they have a luck perk, so no, fuck the kobes if i manage to get you again, that‚Äôs too bad but get hooked
---
Doubt it. I dont think any of them purposely derank
---
Dude, you wasted 2-3 pallets there üòê
---
Yeah, it's a 5 minute video of himself, with Nea sabo'ing a hook (nice) and then cleansing a hex totem (okay). Editing definitely would have helped.
---
Monto or Noob3 for me
---
Super cute artwork, you should keep up with drawing! They're really good, you should be proud. I hope to see more of your art
---
I play both pretty regularly, and even survivor more, and I‚Äôve never seen a killer message me.
---
True, but if you don‚Äôt see any other survivors you might as well chase the one that you know is closer to death. And if there are multiple survivors running, I‚Äôm 100% gonna go for the one that is closer to death. If that means the one that‚Äôs fresh off the hook, then so be it.
---
What I mean is; don't down the dude if you just watched them pull themselves off. Unless it's deliverance, obv.
---
Nope. Killers are entitled babies. "One survivor tbagged so now they all must pay!"
---
Name of the game is to get yourself out
---
Nah, that legacy player 100% deserved all the toxicity tossed at his face. May have been doing that to make his SWF friends laugh at the players expense, hence why they were trying real hard to save him.
---
I'm just stating home truths. The fact is if the lad/ladette ranks up it doesn't mean he's not going to have every game without camping and tunnellers because the ranking system is pretty fucking easy for killer. So chill your beans chap.
---
It is not... it is balanced af stop whining, no wonder why this game is dying
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
Thanks!  My SO bought me a sketchbook and I've been drawing in it constantly for the past few days.  I love drawing dbd stuff so you will definitely see more in the future.
---
I know what you mean, but there are perks in this game that make it easier to kobe without deliverance. But you dm know that till you are on the end screen, so nah il hooking you back
---
By hitting them 4 times with frenzy?
---
you have done well
---
Go to old reddit (because i can‚Äôt find how to change it on new reddit). On the right side under unsubscribe/subscribe button is where you can do a flair
---
He's not naming anyone, he's defending himself. Someone obviously accused him of smurfing, and put him in the same category as the SWF edgelords that derank on purpose to get video material where they bully low rank players. It seems like he deranked to get lobbies filled in quicker because the ranking system change lead to very little high rank survivors as opposed to a lot of high rank killers.
---
Ps4 rank 8. But why wouldn't I be able to?
---
Nice work!
---
Devs need to do something about face camping because the game is dying. 7 of my friends just stopped playing this game because of face campers xD and the number is increasing. just look at the player base
---
YEah, I‚Äôll upvote only because cake day
---
Uhm, and here I thought that in this sub people knows what /s means
---
local gaming communities pp hard from psychotic ghost
---
The prompt to wiggle free from a killers grasp followed me the whole game when NOT on the shoulders of a killer
---
That sentence right there is why he‚Äôs crap and people need to stop complaint, saying he has no counter, his counter is he takes forever.

And that I don‚Äôt give a shit what you play ?
---
KittyChipz and that one guy she plays with. They were teasing him yesterday
---
Didn't mean to make you hostile and upset, woah. We got a stunned Huntress over here
---
My favorite is when I‚Äôm at tier three with Myers and someone doesn‚Äôt realize it. They go for a body block and get insta downed.
---
Uhoh, did I strike a nerve? You're taking this personally.
---
Getting hit while a killer is carrying another survivor gets you 10 points for the benevolent emblem.
---
LMAO, I wanted to bait her into vaulting at me so I could go behind the pallet instantly and drop it on her. I hit the SPACE bar too early though and fucked up.  
---
*I'd rather have the one in a million rando*  
---
Huh? I'm commending the rando with this video.
---
And if the survivor's a worthless pussy, they'll DC instead of running the timer and buying their teammates time.
---
You counter Legion by playing the game. They're not omnipotent.
---
No. I can‚Äôt stand her. 
---
But you‚Äôre taking personals on Reddit. Relax.
---
lol what? 
---
You sound like a leather face stuck in a tantrum. 
---
Also if you don‚Äôt reply to this you gey
---
This is perfection.
---
You can say what you want but I never hated a killer more then a pig who puts the reverse trap on you and then camps you. 
---
The reverse trap was designed to ... well ... not camp because you lose so much time trying to get ride of it.
---
Leatherface stuck in a tantrum?
---
You mean OchiDO's personality?
---
*runs in a straight line away from the killer and gets hooked instantly*
---
"killer op pls nerf"
---
you're a true gem of survivor mains
---
I have a rule: If there's 2 DC's/First hook Suicides and they DCed/Suicided without doing anything to contribute to the team (Looping me doesn't count), I'll spare the other 2 players.
---
It's not much, but it does at the very least get everyone a nice amount of points. That way the game isn't wasted.
---
....I did once however have the other 2 people I was going to spare DC on me before I could even prove I was nice because they didn't want to deal with a 2v1 with 5 gens. When I told them I was gonna spare them they mocked me for it, things like "Yeah right, as if. Stupid Killer". Pissed me off...
---
Actually I said I try for the 4th kill, the person I responded to said they let people get the hatch.  Then someone else talked about not wanting survivors to do anything without their "consent" which shows they just want to dominate their opponents.  I called them out for that.
---
Then you started showing your lack of reading comprehension by suggesting that my issue was with getting a 4K.  You then further demonstrated your lack of reading comprehension by suggesting that the person I responded to originally just wanted a 4K, when it was in fact literally the opposite situation.
---
Unintentionally campy because its a low budget 70's movie. It was made, marketed and released as a straight horror film. It struck such a nerve at the time Sam Raimi was dragged into a UK court over public indecency during the video nasty craze over there.
---
The other day I had 3 4ks and safety pipped every time.
---
someones having a bad day
---
Typical Legion gameplay.
---
That's what happens when you spend it on free candy signs
---
People who message me telling me that I'm camping but I'm protecting my kill because every survivor came to pull this man off the hook.
---
If your teammates are too busy to work gens and are all around the hooked guy, am I just supposed to let them unhook them? 
---
I don't mean to "camp" but seriously, if you were elsewhere I wouldn't have to be on his ass because I know the moment I leave for 5 seconds they'll unhook him.
---
*manicure
---
I keep seeing people say that but I can assure you the average swf does not. 
---
It‚Äôs the ones that do, that you remember.
---
When people try to body block but I run mad grit. Hate me lol
---
110 Movement speed. Imagine chasing as huntress with no hatchets. Let me know when you get Legion..
---
That kinda sucks... but maybe the won‚Äôt see because of the gen highlights.
---
Ur a pro
---
No u
---
Btw the guy just wanted a 4K, but put it in a humoristique way, but you didn‚Äôt get it since you are so hollow brained. 
---
Btw I you don‚Äôt reply to this then ur mom gey
---
Hey guys, so I heard the latest changes made double pipping excruciating
---
IN the scale of 1-10 how fuckign impossible are the addept killer achievements now?
---
It did before too lol enduring is a beautiful thing
---
Ha! I just got a voice message from someone because I spent some time looking for other survivors after hooking one, and then I went back to check if anyone was around the Claudette.
---
How funny that both Claudette‚Äôs DC‚Äôed afterwards
---
We just got a new dlc survivor with cosmetics get over yourself
---
That's really unfortunate. Idk if you're having insanely bad luck or if it's actually just as big of an issue like you say. I have rarely gotten into games and have had another survivor cleanse a totem that someone else saw. Maybe that's just because of the High Ranks since there isn't as many SWF players as like Rank 10 for example, idk.
---
I'm just saying that don't expect your totems to last the entire game. Usually what happens with ruin is that it gets clensed in the first 5 minutes, while Devour Hope will be cleansed 3 minutes after survivors notice the Exposed Status.
---
I don't even usually patrol my totems that much since depending on the map, they're usually a bitch to find anyways.
---
But still;
---
&gt;I would say it's a bit more than a slight benefit.
---
What totems do you run? Do you usually rely entirely on Hex Perks and how crucial are those totems on behalf of your gameplay. How long does it usually take for the totems to get cleansed?
---
I'm just a bit confused since I personally can't see the difference between SWF and Solo Q. Sure, you may come across bad and good survivors but I really can't tell otherwise than from coordinated bodyblocking which happens quite rarely. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Not to mention make your choice which helps when you don't want to tunnel. I play pig bc she has the traps so I can multitask and punish even when I'm not near the survivor. She slows the game and let's me play longer and have fun. Yet when I'm survivor pigs are often toxic facecamping tunnel assholes that get maybe 1 kill bc we just do gens around their dumbass. I don't get that style of play.
---
I'd vote for Hag because she's one of my favorite killers. I usually dominate with her. She's a lot of fun for jump scares. Her power is really unique and there's so many ways to use it.
---
I haven't played as Legion, but I imagine that any fun you can have with his power would be almost negated by how many people DC as soon as they see it's him. That's what has put me off from buying that chapter. I don't know what Jeff's perks are, but he's a giant and easier to find than other survivors and I personally don't like playing large/male survivors because of this. 
---
If you're a big fan of the Evil Dead that may be a good option. I've heard he has some good perks and it's cute how he talks when you select him.
---
So sick!
---
\&gt;Ignoring all the times she plays solo for hours
---
kek
---
Rencor and OoO don't work with Freddy. Premonition should be updated then
---
and they ask me why i prefer to play as a survivor more than a killer
---
team work makes every game so damn wholesome
---
There are counters to face campers. Once you get past rank 13 killers the facecamping stops because it‚Äôs really difficult for killers to rank up just by facecamping.
---
Ash Is fricking amazing! I only bought the Halloween Dlc and I can't afford on buying another one (as a uni student who stole the PSPlus from his older brother ahahah), but he would my first choice now!
---
I would put Hag above Myers and Clown, but in general, solid tier list.
---
No no. That's Nea and Feng!
---
I make my own rules/codes of conduct for how *I* would like to play Killer. Idgaf if a Survivor gets hatch. I'm not going to camp it. I don't camp hooks and avoid tunneling. Why? Because I find that boring. I can get 4ks without doing it, so why would I?
---
But if *you* want to play that way, have the fuck at it. I don't care. It's a game. If that's fun for you then do it that way.   
---
What I don't like is people implying that because I choose to play like this, I'm doing so insincerely or because I feel beholden to made up rules from other people. I'm just playing the way I find fun. I like to add extra challenges and I don't mind losing. I'm trying to win, usually, unless I'm playing around with a new/weird perk build, but if I lose I just take it as an opportunity to get better. The fact that other people want to win is totally normal.
---
Likewise, Survivors doing whatever they need to win is all fair to me. That's the nature of competitive online games.
---
&gt; his intention was to be there for his teammate.
---
More likely to just use his powered up Mettle Of Man.

killers dodge just because of good ping these days, such fucking pussies lmao
---
Nice, you got the god web.
---
Also she plays in purples mostly, so you know, not exactly "deranking to bully".
---
Could you expand on that a little more? I'm interested in the discussion as we as a community try to provide meaningful feedback and ideas in the hope of a watchful dev running with them and improving the game. 
---
Is it overall not to your liking, or one of the bullets specifically?
---
You absolutely should. It's not just that Billy is one of the most effective killers, it's the fact that his best addon build is two rares (or even a rare-uncommon, for max instasaw). He can easily keep himself supplied with his best addons AND feed BP to everyone else.
---
Both sides do, but I feel survivors are usually pretty honest that there are a lot of toxic survivors. Killer players always seem so high and mighty, but that's probably because if they exclusively play killer they never encounter the BM and toxic ones
---
Bad Manners. Its shorthand for toxic.
---
Do survivors teabag killers who don't face camp? That's shitty. Me and the group I play with only ever teabag face campers/obvious tunnelers. I thought that was the norm.
---
"Fuckin kill em... good."
---
                  -VideogameDunkey
---
I had one game in the meatpacking plant where a Jake kept running around getting everyone hurt in an attempt to shake the killer, since he was the first one to get discovered early on in the game.  Slowed down the entire match, would always run and teabag next to other survivors who were either hiding or working on gens, and always sniped chests but would drop the toolboxes somewhere and save the med kits for himself.  
---
When we finally got the gates open, I saw him running towards me from the killer (he had been hooked twice himself but never once saved anyone else), so I moved in front of the van parked in front of the gate and stood there for about two seconds, long enough for him to get downed and be the only one who didn't make it out.
---
Hag is really fun if you play offensively (traps all around the map in high traffic areas). Defensive Hags (traps around the hook &amp; patrolling) are more common and are the reason many people (including me) don't like playing against her. Also, Devour Hope is the most fun perk in the game - when it gets chance to activate before it gets cleansed.
---
Well considering your account is most likely linked to a game ID I very much doubt it will affect your progress, that's going off the knowledge that on the PC version we have a cloud ID we can use if we need to get in touch with the devs about a progress loss.
---
I think it's just in general, I really dont think anyone could seriously accuse a person for playing in purple ranks which are effectively the same as red ranks lmao. 
---
Especially since red-rank Qs are hell rn. 
---
Someone said Kitty was throwing some shit? Idk, I doubt it was more than a snarky remark, not gonna say anything about that since dunno. 
---
The whole deranking debate is bullshit anyways, if you go legit low ranks to play vs noobs you're a dipshit, but if you float in purples or so there's really nothing wrong with that.
---
If this spammer guy can rip off my design and post links to his scam site without them being immediately removed, I'll post a link to mine. [Here's the shirt](https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/t-shirt/men/fucking-corn-distressed/1148637/).
---
DBD is built around survivors not being able to communicate with each other. SWF breaks that, and renders some aura perks obsolete because the information they provide can be obtained via outside voice comms. Relaying the killer's location, locations of totems, being efficient with repairs...having 4 survs on comms makes it near impossible to 4k, unless they really fuck up. 
---
I'm not demonizing all SWF groups, I'm talking about those sweat squads that try their hardest to win despite already being at a big advantage anyway.
---
It‚Äôs trashy, if survivors ‚Äúgen rush‚Äù  it‚Äôs frowned upon but if a killer face camps it‚Äôs ok?
---
Spotted the Nea main
---
Both are pretty shit imo but if I had to choose then Discordance
---
I hate neas, and I‚Äôm a dwight main
---
*Not doing his part. He‚Äôs bad at the game clear as day and it‚Äôs the only way he can ‚Äúguarantee ‚Äú a kill
---
Trapper found it first
---
camping it
---
i saw him and hid for a long time till he gave up and move it slightly away from it and i made my jump
---
if they wanna be dicks, i can be a dick too and let the game run as long as it can. that's my hatch standoff and unlike others, i do enjoy feeling the killer's frustration while they wait for me to appear, but i won't
---
i'm only a bitch when they are bitches, if i'm the last survivor you better believe i'll make it hell for you to find me and i will get away with it
---
You're final conclusion is a bit much I think but your general analysis was pretty sound. People are shitty to eachother, very often, for little to no reason whatsoever other than "Making you feel bad makes me feel better."
---
My buddy, when he has a full SWF crew, does this thing he calls "Narnia" whenever they face a Legion. Essentially, what you do is get the killers attention, jump into the locker and then DC before they open the locker. Then, when they do, there's no one there. 
---
Welcome to Narnia, I guess lol.
---
They ran a late game perk and you got caught with it. I‚Äôm so tired of reading this shit by now. It‚Äôs a hextotem for crying out loud, you have means of dealing with it. People getting upset that a killer wastes a perk for 90% of the game are getting VERY old and annoying. They‚Äôre  investing that at the late game they‚Äôre going to have someone in their sight and bank or altruism to get more for it. Getting kills and escaping isn‚Äôt winning. You can do minimal shit and score a kill or an escape and still derail. The point of the game is pleasing the entity - it‚Äôs weird but it‚Äôs what makes it fun - since if it weren‚Äôt it would just be immersed players fighting for hatches and face campers securing minimal easy wins
---
I don't know who downvoted you, this is 100% accurate.
---
I must admit, I‚Äôm a little angered seeing this
---
Jake looks like Samuel L. Jackson, Jesus is literally Hagrid, and Meg reminded me of the aborted Kardashian fetus from that South Park game.
---
10/10, draw killers too, please!
---
he have it for a reason, to be a team player aka save his teammate
---
which de did by the help of the huntress being a good sport
---
[Tell me about it](https://i.redd.it/3o0alsy42hq21.jpg)
---
Well the PS4 name change just came out and the have put out a disclaimer saying they can be a lose of progress and paid dlc so I just wanna make sure
---
Okay I‚Äôll try my best XD
---
Man it took me so long i got kinda sloppy when i was nearly finished
---
It also sucks if you are not colorblind.
---
Cute spirit AYAYA
---
I mean they're nerfing the charge-addons (at least carburator, and probably primer too) because instasaw is stupid, so good post OP.
---
Check the bottom right, someone just escaped before the video started, probably got smacked and dipped
---
Cause ur garbage
---
Even if you lose progress you'll still have your cloud ID so you'd just have to put a support ticket in with the devs, wait about 4 months, get millions of bloodpoints
---
Well not all of them, I don‚Äôt use any addon above green.
---
yes, and i do but in these desperate situations where the survivors are literarily at the escape gate and crawling i don't have it in me to fuck that shit up for them
---
they did all the gens, they tried to come back for each other and they opened the gate. how can i not respect that by letting them go?
---
It's not even a flat 5 seconds, it increases exponentially, so imagine it adds 12 for second hit, then adds 25 for third, add 67 for fourth and so on..
---
The body blocks were real lol
---
Nah Kenny's better.
---
You know damn well if survivors could see the killer, they would dodge too xD
---
Ty for ur feedback
---
Still a better choice than premonition imo. He wouldn't have known it was a mirror Myers until the game started anyway.
---
I know this is a controversial opinion but I think this game should be balanced as a 5 player ffa rather than a team based game.
---
Make survivors stronger by themselves, reduce the effectiveness of them together and make killers a bit stronger. Give survivors a mean's of fighting back and remove some of the obstacles.
---
As it is, the game performs at its best around rank 10, rank 20 is a joke where the killers just dominate and rank 1 is just a joke where survivors just do whatever they want.
---
Gah, I feel like I‚Äôve just been in this situation. I was a Huntress meleeing and making the mistake of not just picking up the survivor, although I don‚Äôt remember me doing it towards that survivor.
---
Ok
---
We need survivor versions of this. I've seen killer ones like this dont know if your the same creator but we need survivor variants
---
It depends on the SWF themselves I agree.
---
Who doesn't want 150k/250k BP tho
---
Oh SHIT guys 7 of his friends quit, SEVEN! What are we gonna do?
---
If Jen wasn‚Äôt sucking Scott‚Äôs dick I don‚Äôt think half of her viewers would even know who she is. She acts like she‚Äôs some high and mighty person. üôÑ
---
Pretty difficult. I got a 4K as the plague with her three perks and didn‚Äôt get it. They really need to either reduce how difficult it is to pip or give rewards for ranking up because right now there‚Äôs no reason to given how difficult it is and the fact that there isn‚Äôt any reason to.
---
Kinda new here..if u don't mind someone tell me what's happening here?
---
What I want, is proximity chat but with a twist.  At 16 meters, the killer can hear the survivors talking as whispers.
---
Killer can't talk, just hear.
---
Is this a new meme?
---
*Nea wiggles so much the hook starts spinning like a helicopter*
---
Dont letting people go doesnt mean you do not respect their job. They die-That means they fucked up. And they are going to examine mistakes they have made and escape in the next matches
---
The game is massively harder once a survivor or two are killed. It's ludicrous to say that people who commit to saving their team are "toxic pieces of shit." Saving your team is a winning strategy, most high-rank survivors play this way, as seen on youtube. I mean, I don't because I suck, but if I knew how to aim the damn flashlight or how to predict if the killer was going to walk by a pallet I would.
---
Well the more you know, didnt expect my vid to be here!
---
Just did the same thing as a Wraith on Coldwind Farms. I hooked one Claudette and went back to patrolling the gens. As soon as her bar got halfway, I went back to check if anyone was going for the unhook. Lo and behold, the other Claudette was there and I down the first one after hitting the second.
---
The second one DCed to send me a voice message, angrily telling me how I should play, and the first one died on their second hook. The other Kate tried to escape off the hook after I downed Ash, but I actually stopped to listen to the message when she gave up. Probably should have let both of them farm with me, but I ended up doing it with the Ash.
---
What movie is this from?
---
Yeah, sometimes they do it to taunt the killers into chasing them and wasting their time but a lot of people also do it after the gens are done out of pure cockyness.
---
I am not sure but I think it‚Äôs Lost
---
as someone who only plays as the killer i tend to follow certain rules.
---
i.e.  i wont hook camp.  thats just not fun.  Now, if you opened the gates and 2 escaped and i catch 1, i'm def not leaving the hook area.
---

---
Since this dude camped there a few good shots of the model. Don't harass him please.
---
Never had that problem, and can see the controller prompt to vault
---
Never seen any pc users have that problem when I watch streams
---
It's for sure more prominent on console and I'm betting because more of them are on wifi or because console in general
---
I wish they at least moved the achievements back to just needing to wipe all 4 survivors to get it instead of requiring you to reach a double pip.
---
Survivor's addept achievements are so damn easy by comparaison
---
revert killers too pls, that so unfun
---
Damn you must not be able to read because I said in that scenario it doesn‚Äôt take skill NOT that there‚Äôs a problem with the perk or the killer using it.  Please kindly take your bullshit somewhere thanks
---
This really shouldn't be encouraged, this straight up makes the game more toxic. An eye for an eye makes the world go blind and all that.
---
Idc if a group of survivors gen rush, loop, or whatever. I need to pick my battle better if that's happening. I also don't care if a killer tunnels me or face camps me. They're doing themselves a disservice
---
Aight if you complain about ruin you need to stop it.
---
I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôve done this once because the survivor failed to see the hatch that was near the Exit Gate. Of course, Karma comes back to bite me in the butt when I play survivor XD
---
Sebastian from The Evil Within would be pretty cool imo.
---
I see more David‚Äôs, fengs, and neas more than megs
---
&gt; I think that she blends with the environment way bette
---
And this is why the killers hate her because the P3 clothes/hair/skin make her pretty much invisible
---
He's not wrong, but yet he needs to take it even further. Even exploits (within the game) are considered fair play.
---
A bug is the game-developers' fault for not fixing, not the players fault for exploiting. Popular streamers would bring more awareness to that if they would use the bugs, and the developers would spring into action faster.
---
Before playing DBD I used to be into PUBG a lot, and watched Shroud exploit every god damn bug he could find. A day later the devs would have it fixed.
---
no
---
stop it
---
I‚Äôve hit rank one with spirit so I‚Äôm not sure. Just, personally I‚Äôd rather the old pup system. With hooks
---
Like I told the other guy, no point in taking personals on Reddit. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like her then you don‚Äôt have to watch, no point in getting angry at someone.
---
Nah I don‚Äôt feel like it
---
they didn't fuck up imo when they manage to fix 5 gens and open the exit gate 
---
that means i fucked up and if i to not let them go, i'd feel cheap and dirty 
---
its not a clean win if i kill them when they are exactly as the exit gate
---
that's not a fuck up at all, play a survivor and fix all 5 gens then open the gate and be right in it then tell me if that's not a god damn good job on them. if Huntress killed them there she'd be super dirty and cheap. if she didn't manage to get them before all that, then its their win not hers
---
which is why i respect this huntress
---
Oh, I don‚Äôt watch her. It‚Äôs just annoying that someone who plays DBD acts and talks like they‚Äôre hot shit all of the time.
---
Mmm...sounds like the killer wasn‚Äôt putting enough pressure on gens, because adrenaline only pops at the end of the game... 
---
And for your second point about the personal skill shit, how about noed, bloodlust reduced pallets nerfing infinite‚Äôs etc
---
Or negan :P
---
One guy keeps trying to get the claudette killed by getting in front of her and making the huntress hit her. He wasnt doing the best job because the claudette was good enough to get away each time. Then when he started getting chased she got in the way a few times and caused him to get down then pulled him off the hook right in front of the killer to finish him off. Usually you dont want to play that way if you are trying to survive but cause that guy was being a dick and trying to be toxic he deserved it!!
---
I did the same thing with MoM the other day, it was against a Piggy and the survivor had a trap on their head but she was too focused on me and they crawled out from a death sentence..good shit
---
Ah.. instant karma
---
I think you have bad image of gamming in your head. Their task is to escape not to get caught right before they escape.
---
Yesterday I had a game in rancid abattoir where someone was chased into the main building, and due to how the building spawned in, I had no choice but to use the window to run out, which led to the survivor taking a hit (they weren't injured, so I didn't feel the need to take one for them)
---
and at the end of the game, I was the obsession and the killer had rancor, and that survivor sandbagged the gate, so I died
---
Resilience also lets you vault quicker, so it doubles as a chase perk. If you spend a lot of time injured, you get quite a lot of value from it.
---
Needless to say I pissed myself laughing
---
Where‚Äôs Tapp
---
Also, I was in a lobby with her once and she hook farmed me twice against a tunneling Freddy and didn‚Äôt even attempt to take a hit so... let‚Äôs not act like she‚Äôs amazing lmao
---
Yup! The system is badly broken
---
It's rare to find a decent team player
---
Uhh I didn‚Äôt do the license characters yea I might do that
---
*Except Camping and Tunneling, because it truly is unfair and unskillful (granted that may qualify as a balance issue.).
---
Spotted the ace main.
---
To my fellow survivors, if the killer is playing fun and "fair" (where they deliberately don't tunnel)  and you still be toxic to them: screw you, that's how noed nurses are born.
---
...none of that is a counter to face camping. There is nothing the hooked survivor can do to counter face camping, and almost nothing anyone else can do to counter it outside of a *very* coordinated swf team.
---
True good killers don't do it until gates are powered because there are better ways to spend your time, but if a killer wants to facecamp there is no way to prevent it.
---
Lol looks like she needs a razor to go with that shaving foam
---
What's really fun is when I'm just going for a crap daily (like hit intoxicated survivors), then I get the one survivor who wants to be cocky and flashlight me constantly. So I might camp his ass. Whole end game turns into "gg ez, shit camper". Like you wanted to tbag and flashlight me, get over it.  
---
Survivors are entitled little shits usually. It's pretty funny.
---
Nobody is acting like she‚Äôs amazing.
---
I mean... Looping involves actual chase and mindgames, which is what makes this game fun. Being on the ground literally means you might as well alt-tab and go watch a youtube video while you wait for the killer to hook you so you can get to the next game.
---
I don't think any person who mains killer in high ranks would like survivors to run in a straight line and get downed 5 seconds in. Part of the fun as killer is outplaying survivors at loops or mindgaming them.
---
How's your game so bright?
---
I'll run around a healthy survivor trying to body block to get an injured, just unhooked one. I'd rather get the 1 hit and progress their hook rather than hit another survivor and have to chase them down (assuming I don't lose them, and usually people who body block are better at losing killers)
---
YOU'RE THE REASON THEY'RE RELEASING CONTENT INSTEAD OF FIXING THE OLD SHIT
---
I KNEW IT
---
OMG, I didn't even notice it Patrick was on the hook. This makes this 100X better
---
New survivor: Wax sculpture
---
As a Devour Hope user, it's mine too.
---
&gt; but that I go up against a killer with stacked add-ons versus your run of the mill green/yellow addon match
---
What do you mean with the mill green yellow thing? Not trolling, I legit do not understand.
---
I agree iridiscent head/franks/spirit beads are super frustrating to play against, but so are instaheals and double add-on toolboxes. I'd even argue the good survivor stuff can be more broken, simply because there are 4 survivors and if the whole swf squad brings instaheals, you may  aswell alt+f4. Also, that is a balance issue, which you should fault the game for, not the player. If people complain about addons I can't help but laugh at their entitlement and won't be able to take anything else they say seriously
---
I find it kind of funny how we seem to have the same playstyle. Whenever I play with my duo mate I like to take aggro early because with no offense to him he simpy isn't up to par yet in the chase department. However, I rarely find myself get tunneled all the way to an early grave.
---
I guess it's implied that getting tunneled is out of your control most of the times, but there are still things you can do to decrease the chances of it happening.
---
Whenever I play killer and hook someone and they get saved before I find the next guy, I return to the hook in order not to lose momentum. I usually then go for the guy who saved them so it's not a dick move.
---
So my point is, try to keep the killer busy and maybe have that friend of yours who's decent at looping show themselfes to bait a chase. Can't make it too obvious though or the killer will know what's up, but I swear it works more often than not. 
---
And if they are really that determined to tunnel you down, make sure your teammates rush those gens, it literally does the very thing you want to happen - make the killer not get many points
---
&gt;I'd just ask you to take a case-by-case approach for lobbies these days, that's what I do.
---
I usually try to do that, I just don't think anyone is entitled to me playing like that. I guess everyone has their own rules on how they like to play killer. I try to get all BBQ stacks before I start killing people, but if it doesn't work out then it doesn't  work out and it's nothing that deserve bitching imo
---
&gt;but I don't believe one should have to stack their loadout just to counter 1 abusable strategy
---
A killer has to stack their loadout to counter gens being done in 5 minutes too, so where do you see the difference? It's actually worse for the killer again, since assuming they take two game-slowing perks like let's say ruin and sloppy that's 50% of the killer's perks reserved just so the game isn't over for them after 5 minutes. That's literally the same goal you as a survivor have, but when you commit two perks towards that goal that's only 12.5% of all the survivor's perk slots gone
---
&gt; Also, MoM is lowkey terrible because it doesn't proc from a majority of the casts' attacks. Hatchets, Chainsaws, Nurse blink attacks, Legion Frenzy stabs, Meyers Tier 3 hits, Plague puking to Broken. None of it procs a stack
---
True, however some of these killers usually still M1 you enough to get it off. I played a lot of huntress these last days and I almost always go for close range hatchet into melee hit to down them and so far I got cucked by MoM twice now since once it's fully stacked it doesn't care what hits the survivor as long as they are injured. Inagine my face when it blocked a close range hatchet
---
It‚Äôs completely irrelevant as to what the killer doing all match it still doesn‚Äôt negate the fact that the scenario I said doesn‚Äôt take any skill. 
---
I have a comment further down talking about noed and in fact it was my first example so no I‚Äôm not bias
---
No that guy had it coming and glad the killer seen this and took care of him. I‚Äôve had 3 people playing SWF do shit like this to me since I was the random solo and the killer took care of them, while I did gens and she gave me the hatch and they all died.
---
You'll just have survivors spewing racial slurs at killers while looping them. I hear what youre saying but in practice probably not good.
---
CJ as a survivor needs to happen
---
lol Adam's hair killed me
---
Yup. It‚Äôs the one time I do it. Why would I leave when I know the other survivors are at the gate when there‚Äôs a kill right there?
---
There is, just do gens and escape. Going for rescues is a suicide and will just speed up the process
---
What is wrong with people like you? Why can‚Äôt you just say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like them‚Äù and not make it a gross personal attack?
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
I try my very hardest to not be a dick.
---
But I guess by being a Legion main I'm inherently a Dick anyway despite trying to be as fair and friendly as possible.
---
how? i‚Äôm just tryna fuckin play and im getting dodged that many times, how are killers not pussies?
---
BuT tHe 4%!
---
Get bent! Really I‚Äôm making the game worse or more toxic? Ah no I don‚Äôt think so, what‚Äôs making the game worse is a company called BhVR who can‚Äôt simply block a certain item to fix this problem until they patch it and leave its players to suffer a very bad exploit and then what‚Äôs more worse and toxic are punk ass killers blatantly abusing this bug or glitch to make everyone else‚Äôs lives hell and drag a game out for 30mins. I‚Äôm sorry, but In no way I‚Äôm going to play with someone who is pretty much cheating by all accounts for there own amusement and have a horrible game where the killer won‚Äôt even hook you so you can die! I think a jury would agree with me on that one. Now if they fixed the problem or temporarily blocked it, I wouldn‚Äôt DC and allot of other people wouldn‚Äôt either. Until then fuck the legion, fuck BhVR, if you wanna sit in a game for 30 plus mins just to mend be my guest. But what your claiming is total bs.
---
yes they do.

good job!!!!
---
Probably same players that dodge Ash
---
nope, they really don't.  You probably just have a huge ego or something.
---
How is this happening?
---
they really do. how does it make me have a huge ego just because i‚Äôm getting dodged over 10 times? and i‚Äôm calling killers out on it?
---
I agree with you. I think there should be way more mechanics in a chase, it does get tiring as a survivor too, but this game does have a lot of monotonous gameplay. Gens come to mind, literally hold M1 for 80 seconds.
---
I get that killers hate them, but a good 50% of the haters are survivors as far as I can see
---
Ugandan knuckles sir... not red knuckles thing
---
i would say hillbilly, hag, or nurse i just find them all so fun to play out of all of them i find nurse the most frustrating
---
Very rare! And since the ranking system ""fix"" people are becoming more and more selfish, I just don't get it, it a cooperative game, act like this and everyone can win
---
So everything that was added in a patch doesnt belong or isnt balanced?
---
Yeah, this always annoyed me. Like it‚Äôs four people, use a different pronoun for once!
---
I think calling someone a mentally handicapped pigeon is the best insult ever.
---
thats some myers breathing you got going on there
---
he teabagged the killer after pallet stunning him which immediately makes the player who did it a bad person
---
Games not dying but okay
---
it really doesn't. look at the way she angrily hit after they left. and she tried to pick the feng up too. just looks like a low rank huntress to me
---
the only advantage freddy has is his mindgame potencial but other than that hes garbage
---
If you're not booty dancing, no, but honestly the extra BP is minimal and most killers would just prefer you leave to end the match faster
---
Definitely from Lost.
---
You think killers dodge you for good ping but no killer ever does that.  I'm not gonna do this back and forth anymore, good day.
---
Also, I'll be honest, no idea why i put "huge ego", i'm a little tired today.
---
why else would they dodge then, nobody having toxic outfits, nobody having flashlights (maybe 1 at most) and all survivors readied first? there is literally NO other reason to dodge.
---
Not everyone camp for points, some are just cunts.
---
Yeah, Nurse's learning curve is honestly frustrating
---
y'all really are just buzz kills. let people enjoy what happened. they weren't "trolling" the killer. trolling suggests they were doing it in a malicious manner, which they obviously weren't.
---
their mettle of man allowed them to distract the huntress and give the feng time to crawl out before the huntress realised she was too late.
---
It was a good play, not trolling.
---
well the reason why people complain is because you dont know if the killer has noed and it takes you at least 2-3minutes wandering around to get the totem of a perk you dont know if the killer has or not thats why people complain
---
Not sure what that has to do with anything, but okay.
---
Refer legion to the current character they're using?
---
Him or Her ??
---
The devs have to revamp the whole perk system as daunting as of a task it may be, and I for one can‚Äôt tell them where to start. But the way they keep tying to fix the games issues with bandage fixes with perks and features like bloodlust &amp; and 3 window hops is increasingly unhealthy for the game. The devs genuinely have a solid gem on their hands, but instead of cleaning the shit off it, they add more to it. Not to bash on the other games, but Friday the 13th and Last Year didn‚Äôt come close to the success Dbd has achieved, showing that they have something right. As much as this game pisses me off, I keep coming back, cause whether all survivors survive, or you die, when you get that solid game every once in a while, boy is it a blast.
---
That's fair, I just dont think we need to be imposing rules onto each other at all. The only reason to make arbitrary rules to a game like this is if you're starting an esports league where you want to level out the playing field in a way that the community agrees with. The developers don't have these restrictions in place so who are you (metaphorically speaking) to tell me what I should or shouldn't do in a game that you didn't buy for me?
---
I play both sides and at the beginning of every survivor match I put in chat something like "I want a good clean game..no teabagging or anything else toxic. Let's have fun!" And if anyone does anything toxic I'll leave them to die on a hook.
---
But if you clear the 5 totems throughout the game before the gates open you won‚Äôt have to deal with it. I‚Äôm a survivor main and whenever me and my friends play we make sure we destroy the totems if we‚Äôre near one just so we won‚Äôt have the possibility of dealing with NOED.
---
Check your file integrity. Also what are the operating systems of each computer?
---
Just to let anyone know the ready up glitch hasn‚Äôt changed for me
---
Oh.
---
Why do people even do this oh my god
---
The game was created with no communication, and the devs are keeping to that idea. Last I checked, survivors still get new aura perks (last one was Jeff's Aftercare), which means the balance is still around solo play, because SWF with comms invalidates aura perks.
---
You can also notice how SWF doesn't, by itself, provide a voice chat for its group members. Outside comms are just a byproduct, and are ignored because:  
---
1) nothing can be done about them,  
---
2) it's not a big deal since most SWF groups don't try that hard.
---
I‚Äôve run into a lot of people that DC and I can say I‚Äôve only DCd once in my entire history of playing. And even with that I was dead on hook and I wondering if I should do it at all. The losses just aren‚Äôt worth it.
---
I can smell the bullshit on that from here. It's bullshit to pip as a killer now. Hop off your high horse, your truth are lies.
---
How do i do that? Windows 10 for both
---
This is so true. And on the flip side, awful killers make otherwise well-behaved survivors into monsters as well. It‚Äôs the weirdest, most vicious cycle I‚Äôve ever witnessed in a game. Idk why people can‚Äôt just take into consideration whether someone is playing ‚Äúnicely‚Äù or not. Like, if you have to BM, you better have a good reason. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just contributing to the rampant toxicity. I personally never BM even when it would be justified because I don‚Äôt want to exacerbate what is the worst part of this community.
---
I do
---
Looks more like beta Feng
---
Right click on the game in steam and there should be an option titled "verify file integrity" or something to that effect.
---
"It's a perk that rewards a killer for doing bad".
---
I would disagree with this. Just because the doors open doesn't make the killer bad, it could be that the survivors are too good. Especially with the matchmaking issues weve been having. I'm both a survivor and a killer man (mind you I have never taken NOED as killer) and playing against it with 3 of my friends feels completely justified. The current state of the game, survivors have a slight edge over killer and especially in a case like my own where I play with friends, we've genrushed a game and escaped in under 4-5 minutes. That's not the fault of the killer, we know the loop exploits on maps and are really good at evading. We hit 85% of the great skill checks and at least 1-2 of us have decked out toolboxes.
---
Honestly, id much rather see NOED in game than Ruin. Both of them have clear disadvantages which make them pretty balanced (Ruin you can cleanse really easy, and NOED relies on late game - which we generally cleanse all totems before opening doors anyways).
---
you can't really play fair with inherently broken(no actual counter) killer, sorry. when i get a Legion daily, i go no perk no add-ons and still feel bad cause whole power makes it impossible to get away from Legion. i don't know why this killer is considered mid-tier, in my hands i do the 4k on red ranks with no perks/add-ons easier than with full normal build Rin. and that says a lot cause i get compliments from people who play against my Spirit even when they die. 
---
only 3 maps where i don't get guaranteed 3-4k - Lery's, Rancid Abattoir, Ormond. that's about it.
---
Unpopular opinion: I don‚Äôt cleanse every totem, simply because if NOED is there... then I already know where to look.
---
This has saved me and my team many many times.
---
Someone posted earlier "It's a perk that rewards a killer for doing bad".
---
I would disagree with this completely. Just because the doors open doesn't mean the killer is bad, it could be that the survivors are too good. Especially with the matchmaking issues weve been having. I'm both a survivor and a killer man (mind you I have never taken NOED as killer) and playing against it with 3 of my friends feels completely justified.

---
Aura perks still are good with teams with Coms. Either way I think the killer has the advantage against solo survivors its almost too easy. Its a challenge against SWF but its definitely not impossible.
---
Yes the base gameplay stays the same but the killers they add in the update change how you play which keeps the game interesting.
---
happy cake day
---
That post made me post this!
---
I don't have any strong feelings towards this guy, but he never cease to amaze me. I always imagined him as your typical neighbor in the campus area who is getting quite old, but still trying to stay on the same wave as kids around him. 
---
He slowly picks up good builds and strategies, while all of it was discovered long time ago. Then claims to invent it, being very proud of himself. He happily discovers addon combinations, presenting them as something unique and being known only because of him. 
---
He clumsily starts to follow same rules as the so-called young generation around him, trying to use their language and desperately trying to fit in. 
---
Like... imagine a gentlemen in his fifties wearing something clearly out of his age, speaking the words that he hear every now and then and thinking that he is quite "hip".
---
This is somewhat cute and maybe a bit cringe, not gonna lie.

What rank killer are you.

No way. She wanted her in the end, she just knew she got greedy and fucked up

that hurts my killer main ego. why? cause i already listed why the killer is broken. too easy to catch people. literally 90% of games i had to let people do stuff cause tbh i can kill them all before second gen pops and it's really frustrating. 
---
Legion seems fun to you. but they're not fun for survivors specifically because of the reasons you like them, so.........
---
I remember one time I went against a Huntress, 2 of my teammates dc'ed so it was me and 1 other. I helped the Huntress practice hitting a moving target. Was a bit relaxing, tbh.

Well... that assumes you don't teabag on the other side of a pallet. lol

---
 HUGE no
---
Makes me think of Fawful actually
---
Once I was trying to get away from her and was trying to run by a pallet and then I got body blocked by something so I threw down the pallet and guess who it was?
---
The problem with it though is how it rewards a killer for letting the gens be powered. I mostly play killer, and the few amount of times I‚Äôve been able to make use of NOED has been small (at least taking out the start of learning to play, where I had many end game matches) the largest problem with it though is that even if the survivors are really good, the people using it are (usually) the people who can‚Äôt do anything without it, meaning they now move fast and insta down you. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs become an over saturated perk imo, but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs currently in a good position as a perk. I feel if the perk were changed (and again I‚Äôm just posting an idea for discussion) it would be beneficial if it were to work differently. I agree with nearly every other exposed in the game, but this is one that just is too much for what it is. 
---
Also should be noted, I play SWF most the time when playing surv, but I also do solo, and that is where it becomes a problem, as a solo player you‚Äôre absolutely fked if they have NOED, and find you at endgame. And everyone else always leaves ASAP, so you get cornered while they get out. 
---
Also I‚Äôd rather ruin over NOED. Every time. And while I agree that survivors getting to exit gates isn‚Äôt always a sign of a bad killer, the bad killers are the ones benefitting most from the perk.
---
I just had to get in on the confusion train :3
---
I suggest a change to survivors... Instead of Gen rushing.  Get all the totems cleansed first
---
They're one of the things that I give away during my follower giveaways on Twitch (RoryDiesALot). I could also sell them, but they'd be like $20 (since it costs me $15 to make them, plus shipping). It's a fun thing, but I dunno if I'd pay $20 for one. xD

Windows of opportunity needs a buff, give it a similt cooldown like quick n quiet
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main that only really plays killer for dailies anyhow. =w=
---
(Or Legion/Plague for fun)
---
I honestly don‚Äôt find playing against Legion that bad at all; Spirit, Nurse or Hag however.....
---
God I hate every match against those three. :/
---
She survived and still gets shit on, Jesus Christ guys
---
Your argument relies solely on the idea that survivors can just cooperate and cleanse noed so its no big deal. Yeah swf dont have any problems with noed but solo players are at a big disadvantage here. The game was made with minimal communication in mind. Noed exploits that lack of communication to no end making dealing with it both unfun and unfair.
---
I needed to get a daily ritual for Huntress once and I SUCK at killers. After an entire game of not hooking any survivors, all four came up and let me practice hitting them with hatchets. They even pointed at hooks and wanted me to hook them each twice. I got practice and we all got extra BP :) It was a super wholesome moment!
---
Party up or do the job yourself then.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
respect... did somebody offer bloodparty?
---
For sure without coordination between the survivors the killer has the advantage. And has no one to blame but themselves for losing. I do think proximity chat would be really cool. Like within 10ft survivors can talk
---
what else can he do theres only 1 gen left
---
The fact that we're supposed to feel anything but contempt for the players that are *literally* trying to fuck your shit up. Like, they want nothing more than to hook you and sacrifice you to the entity, but we're not supposed to booty jiggle at the exit gates because it hurts their feelings. Like, what? You're there to murder me! Unless it's a pity match you are gonna mori the fuck outta me without feeling a single bit of remorse
---
I think he just Ignored it I guess, tru3 also did it in his team and said it's a counter for aura reading
---
FCK m1 killers I guess
---
Yeah way to spin a good team play into saying it‚Äôs under the killers control the whole time. We don‚Äôt know what rank they are. Anything under 11/12 this would be a common play. Not all the killers are as good as you wish they were made out to be
---
sandbagger vs teabagger
---
Damn did they leave these in KYF again?
---
When someone is a toxic asshole, this is the only proper response. You can call it cringe or whatever else you want, but even using that word makes me think you're a joy to listen to anyhow...
---
It doesn‚Äôt reward a bad killer
---
It punishes stupid survivors who don‚Äôt cleanse totems when they easily could
---
We always complain that survivors don‚Äôt have more objectives to do, but that is false.  Totems being one of them
---
Nobody wants to recognize it however, because hey feel entitled to only do gens fast as possible and escape...  how about you allow the killer a few moments of your time doing a totem? Then some killers also may not complain about gens getting done too fast as well
---
Moral of this story, do totems.... there‚Äôs only 5 of them ffs... it‚Äôs even more sad if you‚Äôre in a swf and don‚Äôt cleanse, because you can literally yell each other how many you‚Äôve cleansed
---
Mmm...unless you were the huntress (if you were you‚Äôre shit) than you don‚Äôt know jack about what the huntress was thinking, everyone makes dumb choices sometimes and that could‚Äôve been hers.
---
I def would pay $20. Hmu with a shop link if you decide to sell.
---
Why is a golden retriever chilling next to a guy who is presumably dying?
---
Use Deliverance to escape and then when he picks you up use decisive strike. If you're playing solo of course. With friends, any combination of borrowed time where decisive Strike should work. Hell saving up Ash's new perk to escape easier with an extra hit can work. Countering them is a pain but it's possible.
---
Don‚Äôt forget World Wide Doctor.
---
Nope, i think i had some random bp offering but no bloodparty. Would have been great tho :D
---
Big wup
---
That'd be cool for sure.
---
Ideas for "mimic" killers are always posted
---
I'm talking about rank 1-9 killers. Each one I'm going up against appears determined to facecamp the hook or circle the immediate area around the hook. I'm just curious if this is what they must do in order to not depip.
---
I mean at least that one was good for a couple days
---
Thanks for this comment
---
I CAN'T FUCKING PLAY AGAINST TRAPPER HELP
---
This isn‚Äôt funny
---
i think WoO should've the same cooldown as Q&amp;Q. or the vault/drop speed to be way faster when the perk isn't on cooldown (this will be amazing with Resilience + Spine Chill).
---
Woa, as a Garbage Ave main, I approve of this. Woould you consider making a Claudette one? one where she idoes not have her cloaking field on tho &lt;.&lt;
---
For whatever reason, the rank 1-9 killers that I've face are standing really close to the hook and will not leave further than the hook 15 feet from the hook before circling back around. Is this the meta?
---
Since you didn't add one, here's my idea for Boil Over:
---
&gt;You are a battler and do everything to escape a foe's grasp.
---
&gt;Your struggling effects on the Killer are increased by 50/75/100%.
---
&gt;If you wiggle free from the killer, the stun time is increased by 0/1/2 seconds.
---
Nice call! I still haven‚Äôt managed to pallet slam a phasing Spirit, but someday!
---
Yes im no good with the uploads of things haha
---
Oh no! A survivor did what they‚Äôre supposed to do and survived! Better report this to the devs
---
you sure about frenzy? i dont recall being able to open a locker in that mode
---
except it did? did you watch the video or
---
people always have to find something to complain about
---
shit, my bad, u right
---
Do you always look for it?
---
Neither of these perks needs a buff imo. Windows is only really supposed to be a perk that helps newer players. Really its kind of dumb that the devs added it in a paid dlc this fast into the game's existence. It should probably have been in the game from the start. Dance With Me is good as it is. It might not be 'meta' but that doesn't mean it's not a good perk. Combo it with Lithe and/or Quick &amp; Quiet and you have a good set up to escape chases.
---
Ash for MoM , Legion a fun killer to play as and you get Jeff.
---
man thats bad. I watched your video, and have seen countless others of the sort but im going to go with latency on yours. Just in terms of programming. Hitbox is a hitbox. The hitbox needs a buff for sure but latency is always going to be a thing
---
Save your grandma!
---
This would be great.
---
Same, I think it's the lack of contrast due to how bright the map is.
---
Why are you getting downvoted?
---
Hag if you want an amazing perk
---
Ash if you‚Äôre groovy 
---
Legion is fun (no matter what anyone says)
---
Camping and tunnelling is fine it‚Äôs a way to play and to secure kills. Counters: while 1 person is being tunnelled or camped do gens don‚Äôt surround the hook or hook dive or unsafely unhook use time wisely and efficiently.
---
If someone sees their tactic is to being effective and efficient they will stop doing them.
---
Yeah my bad I meant more-so when the gates are available.
---
At the end of the day it comes down to what you actually want to do. If you want to be a tier 1 myers and grab people off gens then you should go for M&amp;A, if you want to be amazing at mindgames and catch survivors off guard all the time then use it without. Personally I much prefer it without since when I was prestiging and didn't have the perk yet it worked wonders for me.
---
More info if you want to know more about using it without M&amp;A:
---
The lower TR in a chase helps you end them far quicker on so many maps and it's practically OP on Lerys/Gideon. Freddy is a loopable killer anyway so the 110% movement speed only gets you on very safe survivor-sided loops while at L-walls/T-walls you're almost always guaranteed a hit. The only time it's more of a hindrance is when you're out in the open with nothing around in which case the survivor has nothing to work with anyway, especially with the lesser amount of pallets now. Also if you don't know how to counter the Killer Shack then the small TR can be very helpful in that you can see them when they're on the other side. Oh and you're basically guaranteed to never lose a survivor in a chase again.
---
Comments  like this make me laugh. I honestly want to main Legion because he looks good and for the Skin variety in the future, but he's just fucking trash without specific addons.
---
It'd possible, if you're on PC the only way to derank now is play bad
---
I‚Äôm sorry but it does not take skill to get hit once by a huntress hatchet then as she‚Äôs about to hit again with to finish her combo a gen happens to pop and you get adrenaline. Again what the killer does before this moment is irrelevant because it does not take away from the fact the it doesn‚Äôt take skill to do that. All it took on the survivor‚Äôs part was luck that is at all. There was no running the killer in this situation, the killer caught the survivor out of position and as they about to down them adrenaline happens to pop, there is no skill in that. Not everything has to be skillful nor should it but let‚Äôs not pretend that this is

Over 3 months now and you still haven't fixed the infinite loadscreen bug? Well, guess I still won't be playing.
---
well deserved
---
Ah but it‚Äôs also as exciting to use strategy to screw up with their own tactics, and watch them panic as you‚Äôre ready for exactly what they‚Äôre trying to do
---
Seriously though to those absolute units out there who go out of their way to help other survivors, we killers secretly admire your bravery. Unless we‚Äôre triggered
---
it was my first and only time. 
---
I believe in you.
---
Oh shit, no i din't know that. I think this misunderstanding fueled the whole discussion.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
"There are numerous anecdotes documented on Youtube from streamers that  add up to form a pretty believable and comprehensive narrative:  Survivors are 'slightly stronger' when in voice coms. The least you can  do is to let the killer know about this before they commit their pips  and time to this bull. "
---
You shouldn't need to give pity kills! Why not just have a system that allows the killer to pick stronger offerings and addons before the game starts so you can have fair fun?
---
Thank god they fixed the plague's audio bug!
---
This is still in the game? I haven't been able to play for a while now because of the new job, but this bug has been happening for the last 2 months. Oof.
---
True, but if you ran them for 3 gens, you can't complain you didn't get to play.
---
Lmao what is this, this is hilarious 5 y.o. kid drawning?
---
That's what i meant. I see too many people assume all SWF's are pro players ready to gen rush and leave, coordinating every step. Yes SWF is imbalanced, at the same time if they just removed it we can say goodbye to a large chunk of the playerbase
---
Bloodhound perk buff confirmed
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games until you see T3 Myers with his miniature Poodles and Yorkshire Terriers...

Whaaaa?? I guess you‚Äôre just very lucky then üòÜ

At this point I have like 80+ Haddonfield offerings which Ive been using with balanced landing, its been a slight source of fun looping Myers' house
---
AAAAA THANKS &lt;3
---
I agree with you completely.

That's why i stay at rank 9ish, killers are still good, but you can get potato or good survivors

Why wasn‚Äôt Fenf crawling straight towards the exit? She was crawling at an angle

you can use deliverance for 1.500 survival points and ds for another 500 survival points. self care gives you 300 survival points per full heal but requires you to get injured.

The problem with this is how killers dodge enough as is when they see you‚Äôre in a SWF. For instance, all my friends and I have similar names. It can take up to 4-5 tries to find a match. This change would make this even worse, hurting both sides. Unless the developers released a penalty for lobby dodging, this should not be implemented.
---
Why does this template remind me of Metal Gear Solid 3?
---
2 and I haven‚Äôt been able to get below survivor rank 9
---
New rank system is trash
---
all this will accomplish is more killers dodging lobbies, thus further increasing lobby times for everyone, and benefit no one.
---
I had a piece of shit Dwight sandbag me twice on Coldwind, both times I was coming up from the basement with the killer behind me, and he just sat in front of me blocking the stairs. The leatherface didn‚Äôt even go for him. Makes me wonder if there should be no collision for survs ü§î cause it‚Äôs bullshit that even can happen
---
Hey I like this idea but goddamn I am SO SICK OF KILLERS DODGING LOBBIES because they "suspect" its a SWF. Also, if you keep getting flashlighted you should take a few seconds after downing someone to check your surroundings.
---
i didn't see your comment before i posted my own. Your comment is well-spoken and better stated. +1
---
and this is why I ignore every single complaint survivors have when theyre mad I use something they dont like. my favorites are the ones who send friend request to avoid the PSN block, so they can bitch about NOED. meranwhile their team has 4 adrenaline. lol better luck next time Nea and Meg.
---
Oh boy oh boy oh boy! Another notch to the book of grudges towards bhvr and legion
---
So, you're a rank 2 killer, and believe that you should need three iridescents to double pip?
---
Why waste two perk slots when you could just use one, bleed, and the killer wouldn‚Äôt notice anyway. Whose using bloodhound that you‚Äôre trying to counter?
---
You are suggesting a lobby dodging simulator.  This is a horrible idea.
---
With me it seems fine with escape cakes, but I usually only bring those when I feel like my team won't be too helpful to make up from any BP I might not get.
---
The moment I get a positive crew in lobby? **BAM**
---
They're stuck in the loading screen
---
It's nice to see really good trappers out there, but agree that he's under-utilized and kinda overall sad. Maybe they can give him some variety of traps, like putting in on a vertical surface for those looping survivors...
---
Knowing that the killer is running NOED would actually be a buff to the perk believe it or not, and a nerf to every killer *not* running it. If you knew they had it, survivors would cleanse totems every single match instead of taking their chances and rushing through generators, the killer would get less kills directly from NOED but more kills from normal gameplay since there's more time available in their matches. Killers not running NOED would see their match speed increase, since survivors know they'd be wasting their time cleansing totems.
---
Nice! Can you find one with pink hair nea for me?
---
I still find ranking up to just be a matter of time, which is unfortunate,  so I'm hoping the new changes make it slower because I hate playing red tanks. Theres nothing remotely fun about them.
---
At this point, Im just going to insta DC the moment I find out people in my game are swf. did not know they had to search that long for a game :D. What is the punishment for leaving a live game?
---
Your suggestion does not work against purple flashlights, or multiple flashlights at all.
---
Hey thats fine then, we agree, it justs help you out. I just dont agree that it is always toxic and malicious.
---
Bold of you to assume bhvr will ever do that
---
Dont worry it will come with freddy rework

Good killers can almost always use blood effectively so idk man

Boil Over for sure needs a bit more, there's just so many hooks that if someone isn't running sabo it's very difficult to get value from.
---
Feng min op pls nerf ;)

Except that would indicate the arm isn't usable which isn't true since tons of people "use that arm" every day. 
---
The point of the janitor comment was that you're upset that one section is doing their job and the other isn't in your opinion, so you're mad about the work being done on one side when they aren't related at all aside from the name on the paycheck.
---
Didn't even think about it... Will have to make sure my next bizarre Myers fetish project has shirtless Myers for you. :P
---
Who..?
---
Yeah, there's entire builds that only become effective after five generators are powered. If I'm running Blood Warden/Remember Me/Rancor, I'm clearly geared for the end game. That doesn't mean that I'm any better or worse at playing killer than some one using Ruin/Haunted Ground/Corrupt Intervention etc who are geared for the early or mid game.
---
Fitting name
---
The solution is to make all the possible heads have a custom model for that one cosmetic... Why not just lock the head cosmetic off if you choose that torso?

 Also, wasn't their problem supposedly that because of how they've rigged the models, the hood caused issues?

Why do you care what survivors think? Your objective is to kill them and you did that. Y'all need to stop trying to bend to these made up rules. I play both sides and if I was that ace I would've worked on the gen instead trying to lure you. And imo you did what you should've by protecting both hook and gen. They could've left ace to hang, pop a gen and then come back.
---
You‚Äôre doing the Lord‚Äôs work. The fact that he got saved twice though... Thank god you farmed them. I can‚Äôt stand sandbaggers.
---
Thanks for all of your replies. They were terrible, but I could piece together a lot of helpful stuff that benefits me alone sadly, rather than every killer as I would have wanted.
---
To other killers ITT:
---
1. Check if people have similar pings in lobbies. If 3 do, leave the lobby.
---
2. If they have similar names/same language names, leave the lobby.
---
3. If they are holding flashlights in the lobby, leave the lobby.
---
4. If you really care about ranking up, check their steam profiles in the lobby to see if they are friends with any other member. If they are, you guessed it, leave the lobby.
---
5. If this is too tiring, just quit playing the game (as killer) since the community is dominated by the other side.
---
There is not much punishment for dodging, so make sure you abuse it the same way the swf crowd abuses their advantage. 
---
Lest you wish to face this caliber of condescension in a \*\*competitive game\*\*: " 3 of my friends got me to start playing and we aren‚Äôt remotely toxic.  Usually we try to select one of us to give ourself up to the killer if  all of us are still alive when gates are opened. "
---
They dont care about you, as you can tell very easily by reading the replies of this thread.
---
Cheerio you idiots &lt;3
---
üëÄüíï
---
Being too stealthy literally kills your team. Teammates should want to spread hooks around for the success of the team. Maybe the killer is pretty much forced to tunnel when everyone else is playing completely immersed.
---
Lol you just hit the nail on the head.  When you and your friends play lol.  Try avoiding noed procs in soloqueue randoms don't cleanse totems.  I take out 3 sometimes 4 myself soloqueue and still get rocked by NOED.  In soloqueue games babykillers can and will get their crutch to proc which will immediately be used on whoever they are chasing when last gen pops OR whoever they catch at the door handle trying to open the door.
---
not sure if purple or green ranks I'd assume higher because Legacy but then you see how this killer plays and you just wonder if that's a casual game or a product of terrible matchmaking
---
It‚Äôs when the Killer literally stands right in front of the Hook, usually to camp/kill a Survivor who was annoying, or toxic.
---
Yupp, pallet stun, pallet stun, teabag, followed by window vault, mom, decisive adrenaline. It's just too much sometimes.
---
I had to delete the last one because it was apparently too lazy. If you do not like it, just downvote and move on, no need to call me a 5 year old.
---
Good killers can also use crows effectively but no one is running calm spirit.

Sometimes you have those days where no one wants to play. I never DC as killer during the match itself but gotta admit I have no issue having my game "oddly crash" at the very start if I don't feel like playing the match.
---
Ok thx
---
If someone RQ‚Äôs before the first gen is done, it‚Äôs likely that nobody is getting out.
---
I would argue otherwise, I honestly can't stand playing survivor at all unless playing swf, no matter if the killer is bad or good
---
A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.
---
Why in your mind would killers dodge high ping lobbies? lmfao what a goddamn weird thing to think
---
Honestly i couldn't care less about MoM old decisive was just flat out annoying as fuck
---
not me but thee
---
You should be thinking of it as torturing them really... chase them and get them to waste pallets‚Äîthen down 'em‚Äîeven better, chase them, get them to waste pallets, get them to end up at a generator another survivor is working on.
---
True, but in that scenario having 3 spots to check is way quicker than to scout like 75% of the map for totems you have never seen.
---
Small game might reduce the time to find new totems, but if you are already running small game you have probably spotted those dulls during the game anyway.
---
So i'd say if you have good map awareness and can actually remember the exact locations of dulls then not cleansing them is the smarter choice.
---
Also saves time cleansing those dulls, and after the killer has downed a person you have plenty of time checking those dulls, as the killer will protect his hook at any cost.
---
there is LITERALLY no other reason for that many dodges.
---
I think comparing crows to blood is way too much of a stretch
---
1. Pre-match is very likely a crash, crashes are really common rn.
---
2. I personally find survivor pretty frustrating these days, so I assume a lot of people do too
---
3. DCs have never been THAT uncommon to begin with.
---
Survivors really bending over backwards to deflect from the survivor DC scourge
---
You're telling me you never opened his bloodweb until now? Damn.
---
Play With Your Food\~!
---
lol ive seen more killer dcs than survivor dcs as of late but alr ig
---
So you just made some shit up out yo ass, don't know why, and u stickin wit it. Okay. Got it
---
Funny.  I've had the killer dc within the first 10-30 seconds of a match, and I depipped as survivor.
---
Yes, but I'd say lately 3 out of 4 games at least one person DC's, whether I'm playing killer or survivor. I don't remember it being that common before. 
---
If survivor's frustrating, then maybe try killer or take a break from the game lmao. It's annoying to play as a survivor and have your teammates rage quit because the killer actually hit them, and it's annoying to play as a killer and have the first survivor you down and waste time on immediately DC.
---
Technically, it is harder to play this way LOL
---
If you learn the totem spots it‚Äôs easy to find them. Slightly harder to spot than gens but that‚Äôs it really 
---
Honestly NOED feels really bad to die to because it feels cheap, but it‚Äôs just as bad on the killer‚Äôs end when you really deserve a win but get denied by the handful of second chance perks survivors get
---
Why you gotta lie
---
no i thought of the most logical reason.
---
Not according to the emblem system lol. Actually, this technically works with the backstory too, no? Hope it feeds off of their hope and all that.
---
*Hag mains want to know your location*
---
Both butts are good butts.
---
ahh understand thank you for explaining with all the sales I got every dlc at a discount and completely forgot that most people didn't have the survivors unlocked lol
---
It ain't logical if you can't justify it with rational thought, bud
---
legion bad
---
You disagree with me, but you didn't say it like a douchbag. I will upvote your opinion.
---
Ah, I don't care much for The Walking Dead, but I understand these posts a lot more now.  Thanks for the explanation!
---
dont understand what the point of calling me a liar abt seeing more killers dcing than survivors dcing is,  but if u feel the need to insist my own experience is incorrect then go ahead lol
---
Don't reward them.
---
It's based on rank. Its got something to do with being in ranks 20 to 12ish that the game may tell you what killer you are facing before entering a match. 
---
I believe this to be the case anyhow as I noticed this trend.
---
Could also be that during that time you are facing unique killers as stated by u/JangShierra but I believe I have seen the same message pop up more than once while playing between those ranks.
---
there‚Äôs no logical reason for 10+ dodges, so i went with the MOST logical reason lmao
---
No.
---
BHVR isn't trying to spite anybody
---
Don‚Äôt you always want an exhaustion perk though
---
The entity feeds off of hope. So do the emblems.
---
Bit empowering, isn't it?
---
Too bad this comment was downvoted for whatever reason. I guess people don't like when you get excited?
---
That raises an interesting point:
---
What if more perks would use dull totems?
---
So far only noed uses them (TotH kinda too.. but not really).
---
Now if more perks used dulls that would encourage survivors to cleanse them and would weaken NOED without taking the fun out of it in the process.
---
oh and someone who unhooks you with the killer nearby just to get the "altruism" points
---
nooo they wanna have fun with friends i must wait 2 mins for another lobby
---
Play both sides.  See for yourself.
---
I see courteous killer from time to time who farm or give hatch when you fucked. 
---
But almost never survivors. It's all nah, nah, na, boo, boo
---
Nope. The best part of playing SWF on this game is to goof with my sister, and we play more poorly because we‚Äôre bullshitting together the entire match. Even with full SWF teams where teammates DO ask where the killer is, 99% of the time the answer is ‚ÄúI dunno‚Äù or something nondescript like ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre over by a tree/rock/hook‚Äù. Try NOT failing a skill check when one of your friends randomly screams because the killer surprised them!
---
SWF isn‚Äôt the OP coordinated/stealthy raptor pack you think they are. It‚Äôs mostly friends LOLing at each other for failing jukes.
---
Why did you teabag the killer?
---
All the little survivor fucks who screech all day about how mean lobby dodges are on this subreddit. They need a dose of reality. You have a good head on your shoulders. Spread the  Good News that killers avoiding SWF is fine
---
That doesn't counter it, the person getting face camped still gets fucked.
---
Thank god billy boi is getting some appreciation
---
Then you should know about the high level of DCs in matches with all of the post on this reddit.
---
As for banning for it,if you DC 60% of match, but who knows if thats even factored anymore with the number of DCs I see weekly.  Maybe DC'ing has become a meme, to that end, I can say when facing Legion.  It might very be just that
---
I don't know why you're going off at me I literally don't care, you should take this to your therapist instead.
---
Speaking of Machinegun, at least Save the Best For Last is back with a vengeance to its status as an S-Tier Perk.
---
yup. there's that fucking double standard. survivors get to have fun but killers have to endure unfair swf matches.
---
survivor mains are such entitled shits
---
wanting to enjoy the game with friends isn‚Äôt entitlement
---

With the outburst you're having over nothing I think you should have a therapist at the very least, have a nice day!
---
A lot of people are trying to conjure up other explanations but that's all horseshit. It's simply because survivor main streamers started this shit
---
true balance
---
I never get these people, do they not look at the ping or do they just really hate having fun
---
I loaded into a game as Huntress and "The Game" with only 3 people. 1 DC'd after I hooked him and 1 was salty because I didn't let them farm after that. I have SO MANY games lately where I go against 3 or less survivors and at first I was letting them farm but I want to play the game, I'm tired of sitting there and letting people farm.
---

Yes very last moment of the last episode
---
I agree. I should've gotten the plague trophy i got a natural 4K with just her perks. (No disconnects) i put in some fucking work (rank 12) and it was one of my first wins with her even, but didn't get merciless or whatever it's called. BS if you ask me, i got the sacrifices not sure how much different i would've had to play to get it.
---
You'd be surprised at how often killers won't just bite the bullet and hit the bodyblockers as early as possible. They're so afraid of being slowed down and losing their hook that they'll try to move around them instead, and waste time, and then by the time they finally do get desperate enough to either just start whacking people or drop the downed survivor, it's too late. At least if you have to hit 3 people before losing the hook, that's three wounds inflicted, and often you can down someone else instead because the survivors will get greedy and try to bodyblock for more than one hook apiece.
---
But there's still only a 20% chance that any spot you check with a totem will be the one you're looking for, and you'll have to cover more of the map getting to those areas than if you eliminated them from your search by cleansing as you go. You might have to check those three places you remembered, and still need to search for the other two you haven't seen. 
---
I agree that not cleansing dull totems is usually the right choice, but not because that makes it easier to control where NOED will appear, but because it's usually more beneficial to take your chances and rush through gens than it is to give the killer more time to work with in the match.
---
It is when you have a hissy-fit over killers trying to enjoy a game as well.
---
Fuck your double standard
---
Amazing. Coulda gone for their actual 100% developed child, Naughty Bear. That game was fun... and equally clunky.
---
Polish hasn't been their strong suit.
---
this is the kind of quality content this sub needs. a+ from me my friend
---
‚ÄúWorth... it...‚Äù Xp
---
(And dies)
---
Thanks!
---
Sounds like you need to improve your play style more than anything else.
---
yikes.  confirmed that you don't have an argument. keep disconnecting and ruining the game and acting like you aint a problem
---
I‚Äôve spent over $200 on auric cells. Best idea for profit they‚Äôve had lol.
---
a hissyfit? i wouldnt‚Äôve even brought it up if someone else didn‚Äôt mention it too, and since someone did, clearly that means there‚Äôs a problem.
---
That's pretty good! The Nurse's head is spot-on
---
Its annoying but its not broken.
---
As a feng main please just make the skin and take my money
---
Well no not just that...
---
And normally the killer will be annoyed enough to quit chat straight away, so you won't even get a moment of mutual congratulations.
---
&gt; Thanks for all of your replies. They were terrible
---
Yeah welcome to the subreddit. It's full of fuck face SWF mains
---
Idiots will be idiots there‚Äôs nothing you can do
---
I feel the same as a survivor main. I think that just means we‚Äôre decent people with their heads on straight, though.
---
Fricking BP farmers. Can you report them?
---
SWF is a blatant game balance issue. It's objectively unfair to the killer. Obviously this isn't really the fault of the people in SWF, but it's the truth
---
I have fury!
---
You two are idiots. I hope I don't get matched with survivors who are Too Noble for stuff like bodyblocking or destroying totems or flashlight saves or doing gens.
---
Yup. Reminder that the devs say that they consider 2 kills a ‚Äúwin‚Äù for the Killer. This whole ‚Äúif 5 gens pop the Killer didn‚Äôt do his job‚Äù narrative that Survivors try to spin is bullshit.
---
Im saying aall survivors should get to communicate. And that when they dont the game is too easy for the killer side.
---
What is deliberate griefing in this game?
---
No they don't. I almost only play solo survivor and it's fine
---
keeps the doctor away too
---
You can't adapt though, they are face camping you.  If you get better and they face camp someone else, they are still bringing that toxicity to the game.  The game being unfair doesn't somehow make that unfairness a good thing.
---
Myers is probably the best killer in the game, if you judge based just on fun. His stalking makes him interesting for both sides.
---
Someone trying to kill you in a game isn't out of the ordinary, but when you turn around and they're just standing there, planning to kill you later, that's unsettling.
---
You made the claim. Back it up.
---
urm
---
yep.. i think i've spent over $100 just getting all of meg's cosmetics alone, let alone all of the others i've purchased. lmao
---
lvl50+ LF and no insidious, oof
---
Relying on perks in 2019, what a loser.
---
When I meant adapt, I meant the team to immediatly work on gens. Never said facecamping is a good thing but I cant count how many times I facepalmed seeing them hook swarm and try to save
---
Imagine being triggered by someone spamming the crouch button...  lammeee...
---
Lol it‚Äôs all good just thought it was funny :)
---
You're right, you're not an asshole. You're a terrible killer. You got real aggressive and defensive when I brought up better alternatives to tunneling, but you realized they're too complex for you. While you're tunneling and getting *at most* 2 kills, killers with more than 2 fucking braincells will be getting 4ks but hey, you just needed to make sure that Bill doesn't get a chance to even touch a generator because there are no rules. Maybe one day you'll get past rank 10 when you realize how redundant tunneling is. Enjoy getting gen rushed.
---
So you can't justify it. I didn't think so.
---
And no it isn't. Most survivors just have no fucking idea how to play at all. Survivors being incompetent does not mean killer is too strong
---
You posted this earlier and deleted it. 
---
Move on.
---
Youre clearly a killer main. Just because you don't DC doesnt mean there aren't other killers out there DCing. Nothing in this game is specific to a side. There's whiny bitches on both sides.
---
Lol! Yes
---
I get 4 kills all the time you fucking potato. I‚Äôm done talking to you.
---
lmao sorry I misunderstood. I don't think you can report them for that ü§î I only use to report DC players
---
Shut the fuck up
---
No need to be angry, I get it. Being stuck in yellow/green rank isn't fun.
---
My thought was I'm trying to survive, not trying to stall the game
---
I'm not a killer main. But I do love how many people like to throw that non-argument out to try and undermine something someone says without actually addressing it. 
---
&gt; Nothing in this game is specific to a side. There's whiny bitches on both sides.
---
Yeah no duh, but the current DC issue is 100 percent a survivor issue. That is inarguable. The fact that you're acting like it's equal fro both roles is fucking insane
---
1 people are dicks, and 2 there are a lot of technical issues happening, people are dcing for no reason even when they have no intention to.
---
The Terraria music is really fitting, and it looks like Michael is alot happier now! Amazing work! And if people say its not good, let the try and do better
---
There's one found in the wild https://i.redd.it/anlrsflxyvp21.jpg
---
Ok....but that doesn't counter facecamping, that just lets everyone else hopefully get out.  The killer is still preventing one person from being able to play.
---
PC
---
Crisis averted
---
Yup! They'd rather lose 2 pips and re-queue. SUCKS
---
The only things that truly counter facecamping are Borrowed Time and DS imo, and even there it depends
---
thanks a lot lol, was playing terraria when i have seen how much shit was thrown at me due to that post.
---
what are you reporting him for exactly?
---
Not like survivors do.
---
Are you serious ??  Killers deserve extra blood points for playing against swf? Nah that's dumb af... killers automatically get more points.. I think killer mains should stop whining and play the game. Geez they've buffed tf out of all the good perks for killers. Yall want survivors to start on a hook when a match begins also?  Seems to me killer mains font like a challenge.
---
I justify it with my own experience I don't have to try in games without SWF. I dont care whether you believe me or not. The devs put SWFs in the game its not toxic.
---
Side objectives are always an amazing idea, the problem is they tried this with the Hallowed Blight event. People were more likely to screw their teammates over if its too valuable and personal. On the flip side games were a hell of alot slower
---
*quiter bonus intensifies*
---
I play in a SWF most of the time and only ever see killers DC therefore its a killer problem.
---
Its stupid to pretend there aren't killers who DC from lobby or DC from the game it happens to me several times a night same rate as survivors DC for me. And there's more survivors per game too.
---
You are quite biased and stupid aren't you. If you are duoing with your sister, and my solution is implemented, the killer will see that only 2 of you are premade/swf; and less likely to dodge/tryhard. :D
---
The rest of your useless reply was a bunch of What-ifs.
---
I'll blow your mind for you. What if.... they are not \[things you mentioned\] :O
---
"It's a Pig, and she is just standing around this gen lmao looking for me. You guys finishing your gens yet?" 
---
"Oh shit, he is headed towards the cornfield hahaha".
---
I mean, you‚Äôre just 100% wrong about everything you‚Äôre saying and assuming I‚Äôm bad at the game because I don‚Äôt adhere to your dumb made up rules. I get rage messages from people like you all the time when I play because y‚Äôall can‚Äôt handle losing. I see posts all the time saying how killers should let them run away because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmore fun‚Äù for them. It‚Äôs horse shit. Try that in any other game and you‚Äôd be laughed out of the lobby.
---
And the issue is that the M1 killers are usually the lower tier killers who don‚Äôt need such a punishing perk. Seriously MoM‚Äôs popularity is just going to encourage more people to play people like Billy, which makes the game more stale
---
PEOPLE WHO KEEP RUSHING THE HOOK WHEN I'M BARELY A STEP AWAY AND AREN'T RUNNING BORROWED TIME (AND I'D BE TRYING TO HIT YOU AND NOT THEM ANYWAY) PLEASE STOP IT'S SO RUDE TO YOUR TEAMMATES. I ACTIVELY DON'T CROUCH PIG NEAR HOOKS SO YOU GUYS CAN TELL WHEN I'M GONE. I'M NOT TRYING TO GET A 4K I JUST WANT EVERYONE TO HAVE A DECENT MATCH BECAUSE MY INTERNET IS PRETTY GOOD TO HOST ON AND, WELL YOU KNOW, IT'S PS4.

Goddam that show was bananas. I don't remember any of that. I do however remember this guy fighting a smoke monster to the death atop a mountain...
---
I think... Maybe
---
Id help. But im on xbox :(. I recommend saving keys and getting a few good friends, and try at rank reset.
---
Up and down shakes. "Yeah bruh."
---
Left and right shakes. "Nah man."
---
Took me 4 minutes to determine the Nea was the random
---
So basically, you're saying that perk slots should be "memory slots" like in divinity os 2? That just ruins the entire point of taking a perk. Perks should be something that makes *want* to take them, shit like deja vu and kindred get such little use due to other perks having better uses. If they made it so other perks had a reason to be used then people would have more diversity. But restricting perks because they're good is a bad game design at any level.
---
I love how you call my youre a killer main a non argument then call someone else a survivor main in the same thread. And completely discount his claim of seeing more killers DC as "why you gotta lie". See it how you fucking want. Both sides suck and blame the other side. Both sides play the victim. Both sides need to fucking get over it.
---
After just having binged the whole show on Hulu from beginning to end I realized that as crazy as the show was, it was really really good. The ending was just so heartbreaking to me. I get choked up thinking about it.
---
Communications aren't put in. But they should be.  It makes it a more even playing field. Otherwise the game is skewed towards the killer. But let me add thats my opinion before you go spewing off again. Im done.
---
r/dbdgonewild right there folks
---
You may be right
---
No, I haven't noticed an uptick in killer DC's.
---
You're already rank 1, lad
---
You're bullshitting.
---
It doesn‚Äôt glow, it shows the blood but very faintly, use bloodhound to see them better.
---
Right, so there is no counter to facecamping in any practical sense...
---
on ps4 ive noticed it happening less and less but ok
---
I literally only play killer for dailies, but nice job assuming I'm a killer main because I don't have the same opinion as you.
---
But it is actually braindead easy to escape without any kills when playing in a 3 or 4 stack, so clearly the game is unbalanced when you do so and the party at a disadvantage should have some benefit to make it even worth playing. 
---
I'm not even saying make any gameplay adjustments to make winning easier. How does giving a killer bonus bp for playing a game that is clearly not on an even playing field harm you in any way? It's purely a net benefit to all parties involved as killers would have more of an incentive to play games against obvious groups.
---
You are a true fan.

thank you this bot is amazing, but the feed does not work. i would like the shrine feed but it doesnt post automatically.
---
&gt; I play in a SWF most of the time and only ever see killers DC therefore its a killer problem.
---
Lol what
---
I find this very precious for some reason.
---
For the one whos on hook, nope. Equip ds and hope for the best. People facecamp for that reason, so you dont get to play the game
---
It was just joking, I was referring to Feng‚Äôs face
---
Probably should have put that in quotes that was Sarcasm. And to show that its unfair for killer mains to go on about the frequency of killer DCs because they dont go against enough killers to really say that.
---
Might be confirmation bias, you'll naturally see more killers DC'ing when you mostly play survivor.
---
Holy shit. I haven't played since the recent patch and that sounds horrible.
---
Are you doing the golden mean fallacy thing, or are you really trying to argue that killers and survivors are disconnecting from matches at the same rate right now?
---
Nah i just dont fancy playing a killer who hits you with M2 and watch your timer go down. I rather spend my games vs a legacy nurse then any legion tbh.
---
I mean the way the pip system was, it was "rewarding" them for not going back and letting someone die so that they could actually pip. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I in no way condone that shit. I personally try and get the save if I feel I can. BUT it's the rank system that encourages this.

I got harassed an hour ago lmao. I 4K‚Äôd and got called a filthy immigrant. I had to block and report two people. The hate for legion is getting out of hand.
---
\-Making killers dodge lobbies more frequently is not gonna help anyone. One can do several things against swf.
---
Such as dodging them, yes. Or identify them and tryhard against them with tryhard offerings hence my proposed solution.
---
\-If they run in a sabotaged corner: Slug them till all four are downed.
---
Brilliant. Get no hook points (and most likely lose) and depip when you join a swf match, or dc in the lobby. Whichever is better. :)))
---
\-If they use flashlights: Look at a wall when picking someone up or check your surroundings.
---
Thanks for your condescending tip. You realize survivors can blind you from the side and very easily sprint to position themselves right ? :D
---
\-If they are toxic: Ignore that, it's just a game and who are you to let your fun be ruined by some crouching people.
---
Agreed. When bad things happen to you, just take it and move on. 
---
Jokes aside, you do realize you are so unbearably condescending you have completely looked past my point? I said that I don't want to sacrifice my pips and time playing against unfair opponents OR I would ATLEAST like the OPPORTUNITY to choose to play against them or not. It is a cancer to the game having to coinflip. And it is really hard to "ignore" when you watch your pips drop as you get teabagged and "ez":d in the lobby. Jesus Christ you are mental.
---
\-If they loop you for too long: Leave them if they don't waste pallets.
---
Thanks for your condescending tip. You actually think pallets matter in a game where you literally cannot hook? Let alone the fact that there are 20+ pallets on some maps which take a little longer to break than 5 generators take to fix.
---
\-But  don't turn this game into a lobby simulator. Being a choosy beggar as a  killer can't be fun. And highlighting swf does no good either.
---
I agree. We should not fix problems, as they will present newer smaller problems that will have to be dealt with.
---
Jokes aside, you are an idiot. People still dodge. And I for one am damn right going to start focusing on dodging even harder instead of alt tabbing during the lobby knowing how long it takes for SWF to find lobbies.
---
\-Things more worth complaining about: Legion, maybe the Plague, a DS that can easily be avoided...
---
Very strange attempt to derail the topic but nice try I guess?
---
&gt; BUT WHATEVER, PC CROWD COULDN‚ÄôT HANDLE IT FOR WHATEVER REASON 
---
BECAUSE IT HAD THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON PC USERS.  WHAT USED TO BE A 20 SECOND OR INSTANTANEOUS WAIT TIME TURNED INTO WAIT 5 MINTUES TO GET A LOBBY;  SOMEONE FROM ANTARTICA DECIDES THEY DON'T LIKE THE PING AND LEAVES;  WAIT ANOTHER 5 MINUTES FOR A REPLACEMENT AND HOPE THEY AREN'T PLAYING FROM A MCDONALDS ON MARS;  OTHER SURVIVORS IN LOBBY GET BORED AND LEAVE, RESTARTING WAIT TIMES.    
---
THE ONLY GROUP THAT BENEFITED ON PC WAS 4-MAN SWF THAT NOBODY WANTS TO PLAY AGAINST ANYWAY.
---
Yeah im saying that killers and survivors DC on a per person basis at the same rate. The only difference is that you get 4 survivors at a time. But there's a lot of killers DCing too.
---
Definitely, it's one of the main reasons I rarely play anymore everyone is just so un welcoming all the time haha.
---
I think you were spot on in the 1st point though.  My initial statement of "survivors are always the ones saying blahblah when killer have to deal with blahblah but that's seen as ok" is through the eyes of a killer main so most of the time I'm dealing with survivors tactics and survivors complaining about killer tactics. Though I do want to speculate that having a game where there are 4 survivors in a match and 1 killer leads to a sort of mob mentality that permeates through the community and that's what I was trying to get at more than anything.
---
I had this idea last night of a 10 survivors 3 killers game mode with a huge map. Itd be hard to balance but I thought itd be cool.
---
NTA, survivors aren't entitled to the rescue, you don't have an obligation to leave if you know they're near and waiting for you to do it.
---
Not to mention that when you're against a very skilled nurse, billy, often huntress, spirit (although there aren't many who are that great at the latter two) there is no way in hell you have the time to search for every totem all over the map, especially solo
---
Actually as I learned from my husband, flicking at it will guarantee no tiers and only a cry of pain :/
---
Does anyone know why sometimes you wiggle free when the wiggle bar isn't full, like in this video?  I've never understood that and it's happened to me multiple times.
---
And... there‚Äôs the DC
---
Does anyone know who the streamer is?
---
Well I'm sure that *feels* emotionally true, "can't we all just stop fighting and get along, the truth is in the middle" stuff, I just don't think every problem is exactly 50/50, DC'ing included, it's a false equivalency IMO. Agree to disagree I guess.
---
Don't apologize to us, apologize to your parents.
---
Must be bugged, because your wiggle bar was empty when you were picked up, so it must not show the progress from being dropped.
---
It‚Äôs just the little ticks you need to rank up. Doesn‚Äôt stand for anything
---
I like the engravings just because it turns you from a speedy boy into a very speedy boy. You won't get any saws, but damn you'll be zooming.
---
This was so beautiful. Holy crap. Everyone coming together to sandbag the sandbagger. 
---
Side note: Is it sandbagging if you don't know your team mate is there? Serious question. I've never actually ever done it on purpose and if I see someone where I'm heading, I always shift directions. I don't run bond or empathy so I sometimes just don't realize my team mate is there.
---
Well, actually it's most of the time a negative reaction, which I might be a cunt for.
---
But if I do literally everything in a game, get tunneled and all that shit, save my mates, get on the hook and they leave... I'm sorry, but then I'm mentally fuckin' done.
---
1 gen for 1 survivor would make the game way harder on killer.
---
I usually see people wearing the black skirt with it
---
Do you still need help to get dressed by your mom? Just pick whatever you think looks good, you are not 10 anymore are you.
---
3 claudettes and a meg, why am I not surprised?

this is wildly unnecessary i just want a good outfit combination but you have to be a prick. i hope you dont think being rude is cute or makes you cool bc it doesnt
---
Mettle of Man activates against Huntress

Huntress
---
Lack to any real consequences.  The bar for a DC ban is too high for most people to reach.  You can essentially  DC 1 in 4 games and not be banned.  Add to that no lockout timer like every other multiplayer game for a DC. Finally, even if you do get banned, it is a temp ban for such a short period of time, you may as well not be banned.  You would need to receive multiple temp bans for them to even begin considering extending your true timeout.
---
I could say the same to you. Truth is we dont know unless BHVR releases the stats. Point is most of the shit being argued about here like NOED and the old DS and MoM or Ruin whatever is stupid shit to argue about because when it comes down to it its just not on your sides favor. And both sides are guilty
---
ohh sorry
---
I'd tell you but she's being a cunt about it and blocked me on twitter so I'd rather not viral her.
---
I‚Äôm hooked üòÆ
---
Killer are tougher for sure, but I found that in red ranks people are more willing to help each other, because (maybe?) they understand that one people more means more chances of surviving ahahahaha in purples it happened to me that people if you are hooked in the end just open the door and escape
---
I wouldn‚Äôt
---
Sam for survivers!
---
Hol up lemme just 3  B L I N K
---
The irony of your username though.
---
Nothing cures salt overload like a bloodhound Legion round or two.
---
tbh lmfao
---
Im gonna be real: Despite only making up only 13% of the population, killers account for over 50% of the moaning on this sub. Survivors rise up.
---
We just all need to pledge never to play him again
---
Do you think? I can check the original vid if I still have it, but I think that she didn't take me, so the bar was rightfully empty at the beginning
---
Traditional DS wasn't as bad, if only because there was a chance you'd never get hit by the 35%, and that itself stopped people from taking it.
---
There are no restrictions to MoM.
---
Thanks for all the likes guys when I was making this I didn‚Äôt expect to get this many lmao

Especially Puppers and Monto
---
We all deserve a useful Dwight in our lobby‚Äôsüò§
---
[deleted]
---
*sucks* to be him
---
Gameplay wise? Creating voice lines and then having them localised would be an incredibly strenuous amount of time.
---
Lore wise, while communication by talking would help the survivors in some context, it'd also be detrimental as they're actively trying to hide from the Killer. I'd imagine they talk at the campfire if some quotes from certain perks are to go by. Although I'd assume in-lore and not in gameplay some of them like Dwight trying to get them to the other survivors to listen to him to work as a team and David well...being David with his "C'mon then let's 'ave it! I don't give a shit pal!" from We're Gonna Live (Farm) Forever do actually talk in trials, but that's a case of gameplay vs story segregation.

Uhm, I don't know? I mean, it's nothing toxic saving team members, even if you are a Claudette :D

Except none of them purposely derank to go against newer plays. No0b3 used to but now he doesn't give a fuck. If you want to talk about people deranking on purpose go look at jen and her group of shit heads who will also verbally abuse the killer in their streams because they "Did something wrong"

You deserve an in game statue

I will check it! But if she was dropping me, shouldn't it increased the bar and let me escape?
---
And it‚Äôs legion. Not like she has any counterplay anyway. Op is mad someone had a really shitty game I guess.
---
Yeah
---
Get good baby killer
---
Yeah because you totally have the power to make someone viral just by saying their name?
---
It pisses me off when I do all the gens and take hits but get abandoned, I don‚Äôt mind if NOED is up but when it‚Äôs a facecamp M1 gamer like come on.
---
A combination of no consequences, along with an uptick in survivor encouragement to disconnect from killers and loadouts you don't like facing, on communities such as this one.
---
I might just be lucky, I seem to get into a match pretty much instantly when solo
---
I have no idea what memory slots are, but I'm not talking about restricting perks in any sense. I'm talking about treating perks the way Payday 2 treats skills or the way any pen and paper game handles character advantages. You get X points you get to spend on your build. Say perks cost between 1 to 3 points based on how good they are, and you get to spend 12 points. All the meta perks would probably cost 3 points, because they're very good, so if you just want to spend your 12 points to rebuild your same perk build you could. Or you could grab three 1 cost perks or a 1 and a 2 cost perk instead of a nice juicy meta big perk. I know I'd drop something like Ruin for 2 or 3 more situational perks on most my killers.
---
There are 50 perks and right now they each have an equal cost - 1 slot. In the current system there are always going to be a ton of perks that see next to no use because you're being asked the equivalent of "do you want to spend 10 dollars for 3 apples or 10 dollars for 30 apples."
---
It's hard enough for them to introduce a new good perk that doesn't immediately shove out other old perks, doing that while making all 50 perks equally valuable with destroying their flavor and then keeping that up 3 perks at a time for every dlc's a big ask.
---
I mean, it's a dick move? Probably yes
---
It's a cooperative game and you should save you teammates? Also yes
---
Will the killer respect you decision and not hook the guy? I don't think so
---
Send me a message on PSN: Halo_806
---
I'll be playing this weekend
---
Its not really a crutch perk its just kinda a dumb RNG perk, if you get 3 stacks and it spawns in a hard to find spot you just win so in that situation its crutch but most of the time its useless
---
I know exactly what you are talking about and thought I was going crazy. I'm so **extremely** glad I'm not alone on this. 
---
I don't know when this sound started to occur but I hate it deeply. This combined with non-existent footstep sound &amp; loud chase music drowning everything makes playing killer an exercise in frustration.
---
On survivor? And you think David sounds like the Entity?
---
I mean, you have to have *something* better, given the fact lithe in this build literally cannot be used.
---
I thought I was the only one so i never decided to even see if others had it happened to them. I don't know what causes it, but it ALWAYS sounds like a David is right next to you, and it only happens as killer (unless I can't ever get it to happen as survivor). It happens so much that I just keep walking if I hear it at this point unless I have another reason to think someone is next to me like shuffling of grass.
---
That and the noises of the fire barrels. It sounds like a totem being cleansed I swear down. I think some noises are recycled or something.
---
Its simple math: You're the killer, kill how you want to. If his friends are there then they aren't doing gens and thus are rewarding you more
---
Killers job is to kill. 3v1 might as well end it quick especially if the other  survivors crouch behind walls doing nothing. 
---
As far as stream sniping goes if someone has a stream name I just tweet that I BTFO'd them then check their backlog of videos for the moment.
---
Survivor mains gonna downvote cause I didn't let the 3v1 farm lel. Why should I? Whenever killers let me free farm as survivor I try to sabotage their kindness by sparking gens until they get impatient. I get that most normies aren't sociopaths or have any inkling of killer instinct and play "nice" but not everyone does.
---
I fill my twitter with BTFO moments. If anything a survivor shouldn't be so butt-blasted. It's just a fuggen game lad.
---
For a second I thought the 2 at the top was his bloodpoints.
---
I have around 300 hours played and I was a huge fan of the game... until I stucked at certain rank and couldn‚Äôt progress any further. Despite the fact I was always first on leaderboard with 20k plus points... I would get a pip at the end of the game and I would disconnect before the killer and when I would log back my rating would remain.
---
The most obvious solution they would give me would be scan for the corrupted files so I did , after that they said they can‚Äôt provide me with any other tips... so till they won‚Äôt find a solution in their development team I can‚Äôt enjoy the game and... as u can‚Äôt as well!!!.. because I can log off at any time !!!!!! I like and my rank won‚Äôt change !!! Dead by daylight???? Heh
---
If you really must know it's on my [twitter](www.twitter.com/swolebenji).
---
I like it
---
That‚Äôs the thing though I‚Äôm not dismantling the situation at all. If a survivor is running to a pallet all the killer needs to do is walk forward and click, I‚Äôm not sure what else you think the killer needs to do in that circumstance that‚Äôs all there is to it. Totems have nothing to do with this because we discussing whether the situation takes skill yes or no. Again you misunderstood me I‚Äôm not saying noed doesn‚Äôt take skill to use, I‚Äôm saying that specific scenario doesn‚Äôt take skill to execute.
---
 I just don‚Äôt understand how you can say walking toward a survivor who is running to a tile and downing them with with noed is skillful. There is no moonwalking, no flicks, or any red light manipulation whatsoever. Where do you see the skill needed? Who says you even found the survivor and they didn‚Äôt just accidentally ran by you(which does happen). 
---
I mean say a survivor ran by you, sees you‚Äôre behind them so they try to run to a tile, but the last gen pops and you down them with noed before they can make it. How in any way did that involve skill on the killer part? Genuinely curious.
---
I'm not the one who's wrong, it's all of them!
---
Autodidact will never trigger with that much healing speed.
---
Whispers on killer, because the sound it makes sometimes makes a raspy breath, it was the only thing I could think of.
---
You may play solo but the telepathic powers of squadette played a part there
---
Only killer i enjoy rn tbh and im playing on Ps4
---
You're underestimating the killers by a long shot. 90% red rank killers are Billy and nurses and spirits who go from one hook to another where the chases last a maximum of 10 seconds. And theres always ruin bbq and likely mori. But I digress. It's interesting to hear your experience because mine is the opposite. In red ranks I find people are overly altruistic to a fault: either everybody does gens while on person gets chased and gets lucky with pallet placement or everyone is stuck in an endless loop of unhooking and running away back and forth across the map as the killer tps back and forth. In higher ranks theres other killers, not always run, and survivors have more diverse playstyles besides the only 2 I see in red (those being a. Nobody else exists besides gens or b. What's a gen again?) 
---
I kinda rambled but you get my point. It's not fun and the survivors are arguably dumber (or at least play dumber in my experience). My ideal rank is low purple to high green because theres more killer variety,  survivor perk variation,  and less moris/ragequits.
---
It should yes, but if you were dropped before, the bar shouldn't have been empty
---
Yeah but the bar was empty in the beginning, it's supposed to fill up the wiggle bar a little, and the bar never got full.  It's probably a visual bug.
---
AVOID TALL GRASS SPOTS IF YOU CAN. BUT IF YOU MUST, CROUCH NEAR THE GRASS AND CAREFULLY CHECK FOR A DISARM PROMPT TO APPEAR. OTHER THAN THAT JUST HAVE 2 OR MORE ESCAPE ROUTES PLANNED.
---
Claudette, Unite!
---
You complained about a straw man while creating one yourself. No one is saying "those who say swf is broken hate friendship".
---
I think the drama I've seen in this community is fairly childish, but whatever on that, I just try to avoid it all like the plague. This video is just really cool to someone like me that only started playing within the last year or two, and never saw how crazy different the game used to be
---
What movie is this?
---
in all fairness, this could be applied to killers by switching legion with SWF
---
Wow that's a bad ping
---
I only disagree because ive played it and i love it
---
this is so pure
---
My cunt detector is off the charts!
---
I just got to this subreddit. It was just an idea. Sheesh.
---
The point is she shouldn't be at purple ranks
---
Good stuff, I think it would tie in well to my idea for a new survivor, John Stalvern.
---
&gt;John Stalvern waited. The lights above him blinked and sparked out of the air. There were demons in the base.
---
&gt;&gt;He didn't see them, but had expected them now for years. His warnings to Cernel Joson were not listenend to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;John was a space marine for fourteen years. When he was young he watched the spaceships and he said to dad "I want to be on the ships daddy."
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dad said "No! You will BE KILL BY DEMONS"
---
There was a time when he believed him. Then as he got oldered he stopped. But now in the space station base of the UAC he knew there were demons.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"This is Joson" the radio crackered. "You must fight the demons!"
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;So John gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"HE GOING TO KILL US" said the demons
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. John plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;"No! I must kill the demons" he shouted
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The radio said "No, John. You are the demons"
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;!And then John was a zombie!&lt;.
---
And you get downvoted because... you explained it? I don‚Äôt even get this sub sometimes.
---
Her holiday sweater? I like the white tennis skirt with it.
---
Dead Hard's glitched right now? Honest question.
---
I had a match where the survivors did the gens quickly but 3 gens themselves into a very difficult spot. I held the gens for probably 15 minutes until I had my fun (got bored) with being in total control of the area so I let them all go because I had max points. I just barely got bronze gate keeper despite having total control of the match...
---
I think there is a difference than taking a hit and body blocking. I take hits all the time when someone's camping. Body blocking is exactly one of the reasons people say survivors are toxic because a group will do it to the point of blocking every hook along with flashlight stalking a killer so when you wonder  why some guy is face camping you remember that. Its encouraged.
---
Yesterday someone ran to the other side of the map and purposely died on hook so I could get the hatch. Not all heroes wear capes. &lt;3
---
Wasn‚Äôt saying it was impossible, I‚Äôm saying he negates stealth with his power. Flat out its a terrible idea to try to play immersed and stealthy against Doc because he can find you so easily with just walking around in treatment
---
The point is she deranks after every stream and stays around the purple ranks almost green, when she should be at red ranks
---
I am not native English person , glad u wanted to point that out instead of the real problem ;-)
---
Well my John is loosely based on the detective from call of Cthulhu but ok
---
Isn't slowing the game down supposed to be legions gimmick kinda like how doctor messes up skill checks?
---
Nah they nerfed DS because people wanted them to nerf DS.
---
Right. So many people have been fucked over by G2A as well. 
---
The game was literally on sale on Steam a few days ago.
---
Amazing template
---
Probably because he implied it was the Survivor's fault for being camped.
---
That's kind of begging the question. It's not supposed to be fun, it's supposed to not burden some stranger with entertaining your friends at their expense of a balanced match. It's not a perfect solution, but while there's no incentives or proper balancing, still, it seems like the best one we have. I don't like re-queuing every time a killer dodges my group either, but if there *has* to be some burden of inconvenience for getting myself easier matches and chatting with my friends, why *shouldn't* it be mine?
---

I'll send you a message with my psn name so you can add me if youd like. I got it already but I can bring in a key if you guys want and help you out cause I have extra that I dont use otherwise :)
---
I swear no one knows how to play against the plague. Rarely cleanse if you can help it because of the corruption being basically an insta down from a distance if you're being unhooked. 
---
I had a similar match recently where I was running the killer around a little and a Nea was downed next to me and a David was close by (infected but not broken) Nea was one tap and instead of saving her, he ran to a fountain to cleanse. Like, pick up the Nea and run you fucking nong. Swear people are just so dense at times. We all lost that game tbh.
---
Referring to Legion as the least purchased/least played killer in DBDs history.

---
No problem! I've already gotten the trophy but I take any excuse to help others with it!
---
What I am trying to say is no matter what I will do I would stay at the same rank. I looked on the forum for solutions and I saw that someone said  that if killer would disconnect before you it might cause the bug. It is not the issue with me.
---
I prefer ranking up.
---
&gt;Such as dodging them, yes. Or identify them and tryhard against them with tryhard offerings hence my proposed solution.
---
The person who commented implied you could do things to BEAT a swf team, not dodge them. If you dodge a team because they're swf, killer role isnt for you. 
---
&gt;Brilliant. Get no hook points (and most likely lose) and depip when you join a swf match, or dc in the lobby. Whichever is better. :)))
---
I love this idea that because YOU can't win against a coordinated swf team means it's impossible. If you slug all 4 of them, you can wait till a hook is rebuilt or down them again since even if they get out of your shoulders it's a 1v1 and they have no hope unless you are terrible at tracking. You also benefit if they wanna do a whole sabo team because theyre not on gens, meaning they can't win.
---
&gt;Thanks for your condescending tip. You realize survivors can blind you from the side and very easily sprint to position themselves right ? :D
---
It's funny how it seems your whole reply is in a condescending tone, and you're complaining about a "condescending tip". From this one point, it is easy to tell you are not playing optimally enough so thats why you're here to complain. It is very easy to bait out flashlight savers, and if they can flash you from the side, your positioning is off. There's also the fact that you can see flashlights in pregame lobby, so you could just run lightborn which makes it almost impossible to flashlight save survivors.
---
&gt;Jokes aside, you do realize you are so unbearably condescending you have completely looked past my point? I said that I don't want to sacrifice my pips and time playing against unfair opponents OR I would ATLEAST like the OPPORTUNITY to choose to play against them or not. It is a cancer to the game having to coinflip. And it is really hard to "ignore" when you watch your pips drop as you get teabagged and "ez":d in the lobby. Jesus Christ you are mental.
---
You aren't wasting your time nor pips playing against unfair opponents, you're going against survivors who tend to be better than the average lone survivor. I know you're gonna say "Ugh that's so condescending", but both sides require skill, killer requires more skill than survivor, and if you do bad one match, you should just keep improving on yourself. It is not impossible to beat a swf, especially considering that most swf are not the "navy seal team six" people tend to talk about on this sub. It may be harder, but it isnt impossible as long as you know how to play the killer you're playing as. The ranking system isnt the greatest, but if you can't handle the heat of a swf team and you keep depipping, you may not deserve to be at the rank you were.
---
&gt;Thanks for your condescending tip. You actually think pallets matter in a game where you literally cannot hook? Let alone the fact that there are 20+ pallets on some maps which take a little longer to break than 5 generators take to fix.
---
In my experience, it seems that most of the time, a swf tend to have 1-2 great players who are better at the other 2 at leading the killer around, and other 2 that are gen jockeys, so go for those ones. If it is a 4 man squad of god tier players, it might be hard and you might lose but it is possible to force them into unfavorable conditions. You're literally complaining that you aren't playing good enough.
---
&gt;I agree. We should not fix problems, as they will present newer smaller problems that will have to be dealt with.
---
&gt;Jokes aside, you are an idiot. People still dodge. And I for one am damn right going to start focusing on dodging even harder instead of alt tabbing during the lobby knowing how long it takes for SWF to find lobbies.
---
Not every kill will be handed to you on a golden platter. Stop spending your time calling people idiots and improve on yourself, using swf games you lose as a motivator to get better and more experience towards getting better.
---
You complain about condescending and you insult people who are trying to refute your claims/giving you tips. Amazing
---
Thank you so much!
---
Conversely, like Jeff, he couldn‚Äôt be any fucking louder in game. I just love being injured and hearing literal non-stop moaning at max volume.
---
I did crouch on top of Bill so the killer wont be able to pick him up. Ended up on a hook and for some reason the Bill decided he didn't want to move when he was 1 step away from getting out and was thrown on a hook. End chat? Killer thought I was t-bagging and left without giving me a chance to explain I was body blocking.
---
I'm going for I'll probably alternate between Myers and pig. I want to finish with the licensed killers before I move on to the Other ones, since I want to build up shards to buy cosmetics for those.
---
np it makes sense not everyone would know i guess thats my fault
---
It is I love it
---
You're casual too, you're running Urban
---
I don‚Äôt regret any of it lol. Fashion By Daylight!
---
I agree.  IMO I think SWF Should be penalized 10-20% per match where as solo queuing should be rewarded higher.  It‚Äôs harder to solo que.  it only seems fair that if you have comms you be penalized.
---
Easy fix. Don‚Äôt go into the basement
---
In this game, five dollars buys you squat. 
---
If you want to trade out your Doctor Spiky Dildo for a baseball bat, that's five bucks. 
---
Want to make Adam's hair a pubic ounce taller? It's five bux. I'd probably spend a lot of money on this game if it wasn't so absurd.
---
How did this game even get as much traction as it did is beyond me, you would think people would quit early with the game being so painfully unbalanced. Thinking back on it, not until some point last year did the killer game start becoming bearable with long overdue nerf to survivor defenses and QOL/buffs to killers. It's looking very bad now too, with the game's lack of actual  gameplay variety (even after all these years) starting to irritate people and other bugs and dev fuck-ups to top it off.Ôªø
---
Don't bother with them, wasting your breath.
---
The fact camping exists creates awesome moments like bubba mowing down 3 ppl with a chainsaw... doesnt make it any less scummy dude.
---
No and you're an idiot for not backing out and joining a new one.
---
Update:
---
I got the game to work! Thank you all who helped me out y'all are awesome
---
I would agree that it does need to be addressed and talked about calmly without all of the stupid comments about this topic that is prevalent in the community and I would also agree with the point that this is a game and therefore should be fun for all players involved. However, there are always gonna be people who are salty for losing and will blame the smallest mechanic for that loss or just go straight to insulting the winner/s. So I guarantee if they find a way to completely remove vamping and tunnelling and then on the survivors side looping infinite‚Äôs, pallets etc.. the salty players will just settle on something else and start an entire new thing on that and so to that extent I do not think that everyone being happy and having fun w in this game will happen. But I do see your point though.
---
Spine chill is like my favorite perk, I never remove it. It's great when you see a black ward and then its spirit and you completely shit on them because of spine chill working on prayer beads
---
What rework?
---
Look i'm a hen
---
As someone who frequents this subreddit and r/prequelmemes I enjoy this immensely!
---
I see you're a man of refined tastes.
---
forgot to mention I did this like 4 times already. Whos the "ibvibvot" now, huh? :-D
---
I personally feel the exact opposite. From watching tons of DBD gameplay long before I got the game and initially playing survivor I thought MOST killer complaints were justified, after playing killer more extensively I feel less and less sympathy for killers.
---
I'm not saying the game is perfect, and acknowledge problems with aspects of the game from BOTH sides still need to be looked at, but tons of people made it seem like killers never stand a chance no matter what they do.
---
I'm not sensitive enough to cry about teabagging, I still consistently get at least 2-4 kills, I don't get mad and throw games because a survivor outplayed me, I don't complain about survivor perks, I play several killers (though admit several still need changes), and I have fun and enjoy my games.
---
How long were they stranded on the island?
---
Pretty much this. I'm all for some sort of timed anti-collision to prevent hostage taking, but the basement is meant to be a dangerous place.
---
Just thought it was cool to finally see footage of stuff I had heard about in the past (those loops at Cow Tree and school buses were fucking BRUTAL)
---
Heck if I know.
---
They're gone now tho.
---
Stands for "point in progress".
---
It‚Äôs a complicated answer honestly because they ended up traveling through time at one point but the best answer is they were on the island for 3 years and 108 days.
---
I have never once heard of a killer complain about people using pallets or doing gens and I‚Äôm sure 99% of the people that say killers cry to much about those particular things have either never experienced this or have seen it happen once and act like they‚Äôve heard it 100 times.
---
Especially with Head On.
---
I never said that I ask for it, so why do you put that in my mouth?
---
I am a No Mither user, only time I cleansed was to check if there might be a glitch where your No Mither gets removed when cleansing, just so you know, it doesn't.
---
Anyways, I just don't cleanse myself when I get sick, I try to get sick as soon as possible in the hope the plague doesn't realise I have No Mither. If I see her puking on a gen at the start of the round, then thats the gen I will be working on. I just hope that my teammate doesn't give her easy corruption. If they do, I'll have to waste a pallet to stun her out of it.
---
It just depends on the person doing it. I've been burnt in enough survivor matches to know it's some bs. At the same time I've been burnt by killers enough to so either way people play like dicks.

Well if we look at Payday 2 in regards to mandatory perks basically everyone runs Swan Song and ICVs. Payday's perk system has its own problems, but in fairness Payday as a whole has its own problems.

he has a couple of these. some of these do feel like a swf bullying him but there's a few (specifically one on The Game when he's mirror myers) where he keeps saying this team was gonna try to bull him because they had like 2 flashlights and...that's really the only reason.

I honestly hope this happens.

---
I do think certain exploits (Moonwalking Legion) are very scummy but at the end of the day they exist and it's very hard not to use them. I do personally try to keep away from tactics that feel very scummy to play against even if they're effective. I try to keep away from Frank's Mix Tape and Stab Wound Study as Legion for an example since I think those addons are way too strong. (Also try to keep away from Legion since I can't deal with the toxicity. :^) )
---
I think there's a fine line between "well known simple exploit" that's on Behavior to fix and "complex exploit" that would be a bannable offence if abused. (Out of Bounds glitches or ways to exploit connection quality, just as an example.) While I think moonwalking as Legion is bad it's on the devs more than you for abusing it, but if you're going out of bounds with glitches then you're the asshole for abusing a tactic few people know about.
---
I don't know how to explain it I have a lot of opinions on the morality of exploits.
---
I TRY DOING THAT BUT SOMEONE ALWAYS GETS HOOKED NEAR THE BASEMENT, HE SHITS TRAPS ALL OVER THE PLACE, SOME WANNABE HERO FALLS FOR IT AND NOW THERE'S 4 GENS AND 2 SURVIVORS LEFT
---
I PRETTY MUCH JUST GIVE UP WHENEVER I SEE IT'S A TRAPPER
---
Again, too RNG based to be in top 3.
---
You not enjoying the game has literally zero impact on my enjoyment of it.
---
Survivors are labeled as more toxic than Killers because there's 4 times the chance that one of them is a toxic shitbag #ChangeMyMind
---
if you do pls let me know! i‚Äôm currently trying to become a tattoo artist
---
It's quite a nuisance to Leatherface. Other than that, it's just an annoying perk that's usually impossible for the Killer to work around. Like a situational Mettle of Man.
---
&gt;when you're a shit killer for killing all the survivors ü§î
---
I went against several twitch streamers, but one stood out the most.
---
Mostly every streamer likes to keep it cool, since. Well, Twitch is a shit program where if you breathe too loudly, then yeah. You're getting banned. 
---
I played against a streamer who face-camped, tunneled, and nodded at every chance he could get, I looped him around as a shirtless guy for the whole match, he was chasing everyone else, at the start. They went down, tunneled, and one died to that horribleness. Camped em, too. Once he got on me, It was an instant regret, safe to say it was Ironworks as well, infinite is strong there. My one last teammate managed to do all the last 3 gens while I was fucking with the killer there. 
---
Safe to say we got out, because of this. I haven't met someone so toxic in the chat, calling me \*the forbidden NWORD.\* and all these other slurs, I'm pretty sure he was banned the next day from twitch, couldn't find him afterwords, lol.
---
ok
---
I'm actually surprised that the cannibal doesn't just meta-morph into a nurse mid-match and go ape-shit. Could you imagine if there was an offering that let you change killers mid game?
---
I hate it just as much as the next guy, but there's an actual reason behind this. Apparently, when the game freezes/infinitely loads it doesn't provide any sort of error code or formal crash report, so they can't really figure out whats causing it. 
---
It's not an excuse for them; it should've been fixed months ago. Just an explanation as to why it's not fixed yet.
---
I mean, hypothetically yeah. The thing is most people don't plan for Blood Warden because it's not exactly considered a "core" perk. You're not going to run into it with anywhere near the same consistency as you do say, Ruin.   
---
I had a Survivor ranting and raving about it in post-game chat about how BS it was. Asked him if he was new and didn't know about Blood Warden and he said he just never sees anybody using it.
---
Compassion is nice but ultimately they aren't meant to be nice.
---
Don't worry, I've got you beat. Every survivor is at level 1, and the only Killers I have prestiged are Leatherface and Doc. 
---
And also Billy.
---
Go for it. The wife and I are huge DBD fans, ( she prefers to watch me slaughter survivors then actually play). Her favorite killer is huntress while love the plagues design
---
I use Ruin, Overcharge, Distressing and NOED. As soon as I get Devour hope for him I'll switch that with Ruin.
---
I believe it happens for almost every game at which you are between rank 20-16
---
*Ayyy,* It's Smashoprime. Guy ragequit against me on his Stream a couple days ago. A car crash is always fun to watch.
---
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE i thought ‚Äúwow i can actually hear survivor breathing for once‚Äù and i have been tricked
---
The killer is not a fucking robot. That's flesh and blood behind that character, same as you.
---
Yeah I can see why. Personally I find that the other aspects of it make up for that.
---
I don't play much unfortunately but I've been playing doctor for the past month and so far I like it. Here's what I learned:
---
1. It'll definitely take you time to learn to play him well.
---
2. He's like a troll killer, you basically annoy the shit out of survivors and have them give up. I've had 2-3 rounds where literally survivors came to me to be hooked because of me dominating the last 3 gens and they couldn't do anything. 
---
3. He's super strong if played methodically. Shock/Gen Control. sometimes you'll need to stop mid chase to return to the gen to make sure it doesn't get finished, kick it with overcharge, return to chase. 
---
4. With the right perks I think he becomes tier A-B.
---
PS - Some survivors will really hate you in post game chat.
---
it does glow wdym

Ok yay! Thank you so much!

Its an ok perk. It works better in concert with others. Like use in with deliverance or adrenaline or MoM.
---
Trust me man, finish it. This may seem like a spoiler, but it really isn‚Äôt there is so much to this scene you don‚Äôt get.
---
Wraith - always fun unless you run into a SWF group that loops. But in general it's cool to come from behind survivors and spook them.
---
Billy - Fun because everyone is really afraid of him. If take the time to learn the chainsaw you'll be super strong too.
---
Did you consider not camping or maybe going after the savior instead?
---
lmao all fear The Bush
---
nice job!!
---
Whoa. What's with 13 downvotes?!
---
I have no idea.
---
&gt;Dont worry it will come with freddy rework
---
STOP WITH THE LOW BLOWS, IT HURRRRTS.
---
I feel like people didn‚Äôt like it because they didn‚Äôt understand it. The waterworks usually start for me once sawyer and Juliet meet at the vending machine in the hospital.
---
People don't like his confidence/arrogance (depends on how you view it) as well as his lack of respect for the common "house rules" of playing DbD.
---
I won't say he's a perfect player, but he's better then people give him credit for. 
---
Ultimately I think it comes down to this: With DbD there's pretty much two types of long-time streamers. 
---
* Those who treat both the game and BHVR as owing them a living. Their attitudes are that DbD exists only to give them a paycheck and anything that hinders their ability to produce content is blasphemous. They aren't interested in making DbD a better game, just one that produces more 'lulzy' moments for their chat to go wild with donations.  More often than not they tend to treat anyone they don't personally know in a shitty manner and have no qualms about acting like 99% of the DbD community exists only to inconvenience them.  They don't want the game to be balanced or competitive because in their own words, it's just a party game. 
---
* Then there are content creators like Tru3. They recognize the flaws with the game and are prone to venting about whatever BHVR's latest clown fiesta in balancing is. However they still try to play there best in nearly every match because of the allure of the competition DbD provides. Their ideas of how to fix balancing widely skew all over but mostly come from a place of just wanting the game to be as fair as a 4v1 can be.  
---
On a personal note, I think it also comes down to streamers who would be comfortable if DbD shut down tomorrow and could move their audience to a new game, and those whose viewership would plummet near instantly because they can no longer watch someone constantly mock strangers on the internet and tell their audience how shitty someone is for playing a game in a manner the streamer hasn't personally approved of.

SO FUCKING SICK OF KILLERS WITH INSIDIOUS SITTING AND CAMPING HOOKS, ITS LIKE YOU DONT LIKE FUN
---
I totally get that swf can be total try hards, (as some one who has had many horrible games against those teams as an average killer) but me and my friends are pretty chill and normal at the game. So it would suck to be dodged in a game that already has long wait times. Or even worse for then to have a toxic try hard build preparing for us, when we are just pretty normal players just trying to chill and hang out together
---
Thanks so much :)
---
I've had many people with bond or empathy bring the killer to me. So I return the favor by bringing the killer back to them :) I only run empathy so they are always injured and if I'm not hurt usually the killer will go for them instead
---
I saw someone drop a pallet on a fellow survivor I was chasing. I made sure the sandbagger died and dropped that other survivor on the hatch.
---
No, that‚Äôs just an accident
---
Easy fix. Run the killer away from the basement before you get downed.
---
&gt; Rank 1 killer, rank 6 survivor at the moment, 1600 hours. I don't notice much difference in DC rates between rankings though.
---
i think i see the issue here my man, you're playing against some of the highest tiers in the game. i'm a mid rank survivor and low rank killer (17!). i never see people disconnect in my killer games (no need to, i get trashed daily), but i see them all the time in my survivor matches.  RUIN and caught first? disconnect. Freddy? disconnect. Legion? disconnect. 
---
and i'm left as a lone wolf with 4-5 fucking generators to fix.
---
That was my favorite part too xD
---
As a massive fan of the show LOST as well as someone who often sacrifices themselves for the greater good,  I heavily approve of this image.
---
Me, a Legion main
---
Not sure if psn has this but xbox let's you prevent friend requests unless you initiated it.
---
The lit totem isn't always found when using NOED, You got a down because you performed poorly, and Its applies every time you get to the end game yeah you may not get to use it because of the situation, but that doesn't mean there isnt an issue with the perk you just got unlucky when choosing which gate to go to.  
---
When You get that one hook, it has the potential to snowball into a 4k and what does that mean? You pipped bcuz a single perk carried your game.
---
Not sure how to feel about this
---
Where instead of complaining we need to report the problems to devs and wait for changes!
---
Too powerful, please nerf
---
u/ZombieHuggerr gets all the credit for the template, hopefully not a repost
---
Which are the two good ones? Deja Vu is pretty much useless, Open Handed is completely useless to him, and slippery meat is slippery meat.
---
I haven't noticed much of a difference between DC rates as I climb through the ranks tbh, I'd imagine that the loss of two-pips would bother players in red ranks more than purple and green anyway, but who knows.
---
Clickbait. ‚Ä¶Goddamn.
---
Also, 70 seconds is ridiculous due to the fact that they POTENTIALLY might have it, you dont know if the killer will have NOED so wasting 70's on a chance is ridiculous
---
I love this community
---
Plus he‚Äôs the best stealth killer in the game hands down when he has scratched mirror and monitor and abuse
---
It's ridiculous due to the potential they may have it, so lets say I waste 70 secs on cleansing totems and you don't have NOED, i just wasted so much time on gen progression, and made the game longer than it needed to be
---
I‚Äôve seen people suggest wait times after a number of DCs like how LoL and WoW does it. Honesty I‚Äôd be down for that.
---
If I'm not mistaken the first 3 times you go against that killer it will do that, after that it will not.
---
I play both killer and Survivor, and I work through ruin. I assume your just trying to disregard the points..
---
Maybe
---
looks pretty gay
---
You used my idea! :)
---
Of course! My favorite thing to talk about is Lost! 
---
The smoke monster was basically the physical embodiment of pure evil. The island served as its prison which is why it was trying so hard to leave. The island is also a place where electromagnetism and strange energies are held in huge concentration so it had healing properties and time displacement abilities. Injuries sustained in the island healed much much faster than anywhere else. A broken leg could heal in a week. 
---
When the stone cork in the heart of the island was removed, it became unstable and the island started to disintegrate and break apart. Jack stayed behind because he went to place the cork back in its place to stabilize the island so the others could escape on the plane. He had already been mortally wounded in his fight with The Man In Black (the smoke monster) so he knew he had to stay behind.
---
I normally sit at gate for a bit against huntresses and move around fkr this reason exactly, that and so they get a few extra points :)
---
Sure I'll play, what's ur steam?
---
The Hunter- This killer is all about baiting is prey. They pick up the following three items 
---
at the beginning of the game.
---
Spike Traps (5x)
---
Grappler (5x)
---
Bush (3x)
---
The Chiller- The cold-blooded hunter. They pick up the following three items 
---
Snowmen (10x)
---
Wall Builds (3x)
---
Impulse Grenades (3x)
---
The Assassin- The quiet killer. They pick up the following three items 
---
Smoke Grenades (5x)
---
Crossbow (3x)

When I play Killer, if there is a Survivor that really stood out... like maybe they out played me or maybe they were really good team players and the last one, I will give them the hatch. That's just my thing. They deserve it.
---
http://s.team/p/fdqv-tcmr/DMVBHVTF  unfortunately cant be on tonight but maybe tomorrow? I'm EST

I pray every day for a Legion daily.
---
That guy in the background is getting swoll.
---
If you watched the clip, you'd know that she was saying she would get off (a joke) and she actually did...
---
Tomorrow‚Äôs good for me just message me when you‚Äôre on
---
"a bad person" ahahahaha
---
Your really think you can tell a person's entire humanity in how they press buttons
---
The amount of salt this game brings is simply unreal. People get unreasonably mad the moment you aren't playing exactly like they want you to. Seriously, the amount of survivors that whine about camping because their fellow SWF friends unhook 1 second after I hook is insane
---
So, every match then?
---
As someone who just spectated the Jeff get hooked, the Jeff who ran the p3 Nurse around for the entire match.... I feel this. Jeff was the hero we needed, but not the one we deserved. I distracted so Laurie could set him free from the prison basement, but in the end... it just wasn't enough. Godspeed Jeff. Godspeed.
---
Terrible, he‚Äôs still wearing a shirt
---
unnecessary to be a dick, i was just asking lol
---
Jeff: He's...just a kid. No older than my son.
---
I hate the fire barrels, I always think there's a survivor and I waste time checking, only to realize it's a stupid barrel again
---
Considering Dwight is the leader, this fits.
---
This might be a plague thing, but I tend to leave, get some corruption and then manage to get 2 people down. Usually everyone ends up escaping, but at least I get a lot of extra hooks
---
this comment makes me feel old
---
So when I hook someone next to an open exit gate, and someone unhooks them before I can even turn around, you want me to "consider not camping and go after the savior." At that point, it doesn't even matter what I do. They've got endurance now. Guess I lose.
---
I can only hit great skill checks but not hex ones
---
It‚Äôs perfect
---
Yeah but that's not when this footage is from. Don't be daft
---
im a "competitive video game" veteran fam. I have played this game for 60 h so far with no dlc purchases, and am at rank 6 with wraith/nurse without ruin/shadowborn/Bbq &amp; chilli.
---
just wanted to make the community less cancer since i saw an obvious flaw. But I guess the plebbit echo-chamber circlejerk was a little too strong.
---
im just gonna survivor until bbq/ruin gets unlocked and spank mercilessly. kinda feels bad for the newer killer players who either face easy solo players or toxic cheating groups, but oh well. Reddit is not known for comprising a nice community of nice people, only people who want to look like they are nice with their karma system. GL
---
If  you see someone spit on someone elses shoes, what do you think of them?
---
Great job! The sppoky music is great too! Are you going to do a Survivors dossier as well?
---
So Kate stays there and they bring the gens to her?
---
Damn that sucks,but you should keep playing the plague,she's probably my new favorite killer she has lots of map pressure and once you get corrupt purge you have the best attack in the game.
---
Wow the most reasonable and sensible comment on the bottom once again, never change r/deadbydaylight.
---
Whenever I start a match. I don't know who the enemy is at first.
---
Sitting there calling someone a hoe, a bitch and so on and then getting farmed = LUL
---
Hell it's funny when someone actually pulls off doing a "360" and they talk shit doing it.
---
Lust
---
What you can do in that case is hit the person trying to unhook before they can do it.
---
 That survivor will either have a chance to run to the gate and leave their teammate, or they will unhook with BT which will give you enough time to down the savior before they get a chance to run away.
---
Uh.... should I point out that the dude you're responding to here isn't even the OP?
---
What the fuck
---
Disgusting childish behaviour.
---
Is this a joke?
---
Ignore the music at the beginning.
---
Anna nurf ? Looks like someone never even Player Anna
---
Leave basement stairs the same, just make some way to prevent the killer from trapping you for 10 years. Make you be able to pass through the killer if running at them long enough, or something.
---
It‚Äôs so true though
---
Pretty sure he was Walt's dog. The Others ferried Walt off the island and back home at the end of season 1 or 2 maybe?
---
Sun Tzu said that! And I think he knew a little bit more about Dead By Daylight than *you do*, pal, because He invented it! And then he perfected it so that no living man may best him in the ring of honor!
---
Wait, they traveled through time? What the hell I thought the show was more grounded in reality.
---
He boutta suck that Claudette nose.
---
Hope you don't mind, I loved this so much I put it up as my PS4 profile banner: 
---
https://i.imgur.com/u4mBMbp.jpg
---
Sadly, true.
---
I Don t think so but i am not sure
---
It would give yourself a higher chance of surviving to leave asap.  So, since the name of the game is to survive... then, yes...
---
It was never intended for comms. The advantage already is there.  Why the same blood gain for a solo person who has no idea what‚Äôs going on?  Swf is single handedly why killers become salty.  You want to group up, fine, squad up up no mics and go to work. You bring a mic into it you might as well have the entity directly telling what the killer to do
---
What‚Äôs the code????
---
Ok but you know i wrote that Sun Tzu said that right?
---
For the most part it was grounded in reality but there was a lot of science fiction elements to it. There was a device used to move the island so that I wouldn‚Äôt be found again but it was dislodged and caused everyone on the island to travel through time back-and-forth. When that was fixed they ended up getting stuck in the past
---
Huh? That's still bad
---
I use The Third Seal, Ruin, and Devour Hope on occasion depending on the build. Whenever I chase a survivor by my totem, I can count on it getting cleansed in the next 30 seconds if I leave it to co tune the chase.  Or if I find someone cleansing them and chase them off it, somehow literally everyone knows where it is.  Communication is pretty bullshit considering the game isnt balanced around it.
---
But Nea you look like the Hags daughter!
---
Sorry, I forgot that speaking increases the chances of unhooking yourself.
---
Not even that; Borrowed Time only works  if you unhook them while in Terror Radius. Wraith, Pig, Insidious, Myers, all of them can render it useless.
---
I didn't know trap didn't go off in the exit if you crawled. Learn something new every day.
---
I've read a bit of the stuff you wrote and I suggest you to read it again as well. Most of the changes you mentioned were heavily killer side biased.
---
I thought it was pretty obvious that was q joke boyo lol
---
How do you counter MoM?
---
Is it the killers problem for letting all 4 survivors getting their adrenaline?
---
Here we see a wild Claudette main in their natural habitat, notice how they spray salt at intruders that threaten their pips! Fascinating.
---
Interesting. I might give it a try, I've never watched it before.
---
Btw the prices are 3x cheaper on russian stwam store. Every dlc pack is 1.6‚Ç¨ + auric cells are way cheaper
---
Judging by the Tweet alone it doesn't seem to be directed at a specific person.
---
I believe everyone should watch lost at least one time and it‚Äôs entirety. It‚Äôs on Hulu if you would like to watch it it‚Äôs really good
---
lol no
---
Probably because it existed before Myers and the Devs never thought to go back and update the description.
---
No it does if she attaches it before the half-way point and you try to crawl out. If you are past half-way and she attaches it then you can safely finish crawling out. In case you aren't sure the rbt gives off a warning, if you hear beeping getting louder you are fucked. If the pig carries you to the exit and drops you past half way you are safe aswell, this is so the pig can't just rbt people and kill them by walking to the exit.
---
They are hitting critical levels of entitlement. They also value pips for some reason. I just want to kill people, idgaf about rank (any more).
---
if you're leatherface, getting the savior down shouldn't be a problem. The savior doesn't get endurance, only the unhooked.
---
I'd say the Ash DLC from last week counts as he came with cosmetics but having nothing release alongside the Chapter, like we've had in the past, is pretty damn weird. Plus the week before Ash and this week.
---
Not on the hatchets themselves, but it will still give you stacks for your M1.
---
Wow, that was rude. 
---
What do you think of someone who pushes buttons?
---
See I try to only use the axe if I absolutely have to so that wouldn't be worth it for me.
---
Lmaooooo ok...  just because its swf doesnt mean that their automatically gonna win. Usually swf are to aultristic, and it gets them killed. But granting a killer bonus blood points is a no for me.  It that's the case I want xtra blood points for going against billy, nurse and spirit...
---
I mean it's not like the game gets tedious or boring playing as or against the same 4 killers, right? Right? Okay I'll go back to playing Nurse/Legion.
---
this is amazing! can‚Äôt wait to see more of your work!! will there be more dbd stuff?
---
Wait. Shit. Forgot Alert is map wide. In my defense it didn't used to be...
---
ok.
---
nope! OP and hazerkillz were a team, hazerkillz is her teammate who got ‚Äútunneled‚Äù.
---
I play for the team you play your way.
---
I never condone DCing, but why shouldn't they DC if the survivors DC as soon as they get downed.  It goes both ways.

Does anyone know how to do this? I've tried a couple methods from YouTube in KYF but they won't work
---
Kitty is constantly flaming killers while playing in a SWF group that have all deranked. Tru3 plays solo and tries to not be toxic at rank 1.
---
What is backwards?!?
---
Agreed, but they need to add a totem counter.  SWF has enough advantages over Solo
---
i dont get it, if he was jumping around a locker why didn't you catch him?
---
I agree no dcing at all doesnt help
---
It's about a equal ratio on xbox. Idk what this guys talking about killers dc all the damn time now. People usually don't dc as often unless its legion.
---
I agree. Keep that same energy and esacpe when the doors are open dont wait at the door and teabag
---
Could they like... Stop already? I'm getting really tired of it even though I avoid it as much as I can.
---
Nobody should DC, if you hit "ready" at the bottom-right corner of your screen you should be prepared to play out the match.

Are clown and doc super good on PC or something? I play on console unfortunately so it's very different
---
They hated Jesus because he told the truth.
---
I had this conversation with a Legion who dc'd the second I got his ruin at the start of match.  He told me he does this every game it happens and he doesn't see anything wrong with it.
---
yh but some people in this community seem to be looking for reasons to be salty and angry rather than being justified in that anger. Also salt definitely can disqualify peoples opinions on camping; it is a legitimate strategy with its strengths and weaknesses but if you do it be prepared for comments and insults on your character as person based on the way you play a game e.g. racism, sexism ect... but also the opinions on camping are that it is unfair and there are no counters which is untrue if you work together it is pretty easy to bait out and if you can't then you can punish face camping by getting 3-3.5 gens done in the time (even more w toolboxes) if each of the remaining 3 survivors does a gen each. so there are easy counters and punishments in retaliation of a killer securing a kill. is in annoying when it happens to you? yes but imo i get more annoyed and my teammates when i get camped bc they usually swarm the hook and give the killer the ez win.
---
also the unfun argument is also relative as everybody finds different things fun and entertaining so how can you argue that one person/groups opinions and thoughts on fun are more important than the others?
---
who said it was me who got put in the basement? The only way to not get blocked in the basement is to not go for a save period. But do you understand what im saying? The fact that nobody can leave if the killer is at the top of the stairs unless you take a hit and either get downed or get protection against being body blocked from taking a hit is the problem while they stand in the middle of the staircase . Not that the basement is dangerous and theres a long path to get down and back up
---
Why they got to do my man Tapp like that
---
Now this is epic!
---
You got one for kate??
---
The letters are too small and you can‚Äôt really read what it says.
---
Then you're a credit to this community. Games can be frustrating, but it's not worth getting angry or crying over.
---
Did you let him go?
---
Since you can get payed content with shards I doubt they will do it, but I do like your idea. 
---
It would work better with a system like overwatch, the gold guns were made to be competitive point rewards only,  rather than something you can either earn slowly or buy.
---
They're just annoying to play against because of their power
---
That theyre rude and prone to bullying same as i would if someone spat on someone.
---
Ash is the scarecrow, Pigs and Myers flee on sight. Ash then began chasing Pig as she tried pallet looping but the t-pose instadowned her

Survivors, don't hold the game hostage to fuck with the killer.
