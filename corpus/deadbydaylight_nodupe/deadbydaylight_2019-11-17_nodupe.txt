You're right. Thank you!

Don't fall for the gimmick of the dream pallets.  His Snares are much much stronger.  Feel free to mess around with them for low effort kicks but if you're up against a solid group you want his Snares to shut them little looping shits down.  One does not successfully loop a Snare Freddy that knows how to use their power.
---
a. No, we don't need 5 perk slots, the mass of overpowered builds it brings would be astronomical.
---

---
b. Karma-whoring link post despite being completely unrelated?
---
He didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwave it around declaring his is the best‚Äù. If you didn‚Äôt comment back this wouldn‚Äôt have started. Since you like your opinion you have to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong and my opinion is good because it‚Äôs the same as most people‚Äù.
---
What show I can‚Äôt remember help.
---
If you give 1 more to the survivor, you have to give 1 more to the killer. Not that I'm for this idea, but it would need hella testing in the PTB
---
UNTIL the survivor is within the spirits terror radius?
---
Noed is reallt overrated tbh. Good survivors will find it, even in the EGC.
---
If I can hear the hatch while bringing them to the hook I will let them have it.
---
No you don't. Remember the insta kill huntress where she would throw a hatchet and immediately m1. Definitely no invulnerable time. Just speed boost
---
i love it
---
I stream with Twitch in my name and I just fully expect people to assume I‚Äôm in a SWF and I‚Äôm toxic, even though I‚Äôve never teabagged a killer before. There *are* people that visit channels before/after matches when you have TTV or Twitch in your name, and I‚Äôve met a lot of really great people who I otherwise probably wouldn‚Äôt have had much interaction with outside of pre-game and post-game chat. I do understand why some people assume all streamers play in SWF‚Äî most do, and it can be a mixed bag of people‚Äî but I don‚Äôt understand why a lot of people have it out for them. A few bad apples ruin the bunch, I suppose.
---
I kinda like having a mori specifically for me though. It forces me to get better at chases, my worst aspect of survivor lol.
---
Absolute power move.
---
This killer has given no indication that they will be similar in their kit to Spirit. Also why would the devs make a killer in a similar vein to an existing killer anyway? Like the only killer who is in any way similar power to another is Billy and LF and evening they have different acting powers. You‚Äôre just complaining to complain. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Considering how fast the heartbeat probably was, I'm assuming she knew he was there anyways.
---
On Freddy it's usually Ruin, Dying Light, Pop, BBQ. Sometimes people swap Corrupt for Ruin, or Surveillance for BBQ. 
---
Thana isn't worth it unless you either are a killer that can realistically keep all 4 injured (Plague, Legion), or are a stealth killer and support it with Sloppy and Nurse's to make a whole build around injuring.
---
Killers don‚Äôt have to ignore you, they just have to chase you as the final gen pops, and them ignoring me  isn‚Äôt fun, because then all I can really do is do gens and force myself closer to a state where I can‚Äôt do shit or I die
---
Ignore any type of flame, explanation or whatever. Just build how you want to build
---
Its YOUR Spirit build, make it how YOU want it. If thats many One-hits, who can judge but you yourself?
---
Sloppy meat
---
Attitude is important! I got super hyped getting mori‚Äôd on stream by a Billy the other night because the mori bugged so that he just chainsaws the ground off-screen while the survivor‚Äôs back erupts in blood. Someone clipped it, I thought it was hilarious lol.
---
Yeah. Protection hits work when it makes no sense, and don't work when they make sense.
---
Yeah I bet you play killer without perks...
---
In all honesty it should be pointed out here. It shows how finicky the servers are that the game can't even handle your internet popping off for a second.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have the same issue with this game atm which makes it literally unplayable (kinda feels bad when you bought a rift pass)
---
I have no issues with other games myself and generally never experience any lag.
---
So yeah i would say that its an issue with the game since all other games handles connections much better.
---
If the survivor is holding crouch when being unhooked, it doesn‚Äôt trigger. Unless it‚Äôs a Dwight, they always run...
---
I brought in and used a brown one, found another brown one but then died before I used it. I got 2/6 for it, probably because I died with it? Idk
---
I've experienced this on ps4 too.  Also, I often get a judder when gaining bloodlust.  That's very irritating too especially when you're about to get a hit.
---
Mori spamming is justified for teabagging (endless cycle btw let‚Äôs just not be toxic)
---
Yikes.... wrong, if I did nothing would change. If this community wasn't so basic and so predictable they would realize that perks aren't the things that get you the win.
---
Ok thank you
---
Probable to be awesome from afar
---
Play both then.
---
&gt;I mean, not everyone that has TTV in their name is going to make your life miserable. If that person is acting like a toxic scumbag, then be my guest, and AFAIK, there are several of those out there. But there are some genuine people that just want to have a good time and are not toxic at all.
---
this. i have TTV in my name because i just started streaming, and this is the easiest way to get new viewers. its super fun too. having survivors and killers come into my chat and chill with me is rly fun. fortunately i havent felt targeted much

Last addon is a flex. Right after the rework happened, fake pallets were the most popular to run along with either Swing Chains or Jump Rope. After a few weeks, running double slowdown with SC + JR became pretty popular. Nowadays people are experimenting with more of his utility addons instead of Jump Rope, like Pill Bottle to make your movement harder to track, or Paint Brush to keep pple in dream more often.
---
I don't mind the toxic people that I can catch as they usually either stop being toxic when they see that it won't work, or they just DC and screw over thier team. It's the ones that are better than me that annoy me. Not because they are better, I'm actually ok with that as that's how you get better. But the t-bagging, following me around and constant flash light clicking...it doesn't make me angry or toxic, but it ruins the fun for that match and I'm just ready for them to get out so I can ignore the bm in chat and move on.
---
Ebony Mori: hey its very rare dude
---
Noed: Just cleanse totems
---
DS: Broken Shit.
---
I need the ghostface costume from Scary Movie and all the masks as cosmetics.
---
I love doing ge's
---
I would go with pop. You normally shreds through pallet and it‚Äôs really hard to get a pallet stun without get hit by shred anyway.
---
yea but id rather wait 10 minutes to play survivor than wait 10 minutes to play a level 1 killer and not even get the challenge done
---
Lol thanks

Hey man it is what it is. It might have sounded funnier in your head. Maybe you just commented at the wrong time. I‚Äôm not sure. No sweat though just keep it moving. It happens Reddit is finicky.
---
Noob3 is a youtuber who is known for playing as Nea with bright clothing and a flashlight
---
I dont care if that survivor is the only one I kill. Bitch you will die, and i will be camping you.
---
This is just a cowsIAM clip
---
Thank you so much for the thorough explanation. I have roughly 1750 auric cells. Is it worth it to buy tiers? And how do I spend this hallowed blight currency?
---
The ghostface grabbed him before he could finish
---
Poor little Dwight or baby Meg...
---
Nahh I don't wait around. If they're at my gate they can go for it if not I just bail if all my teammates are safe.
---
This is beautiful.
---
If I'm not hitting the greats consistently I'll usually gen tap the last 10% just to guarantee that I can get it done. Or that's what I would do, if everytime I got to 85% my teammate didn't run straight towards my gen with the killer on their tail and throw down the only two pallets I can escape to.
---
What isn't good about it?
---
We are Dwight.
---
Her squeal when she gets stunned is probably the most innocent sound.
---
You never know what reddit likes or dislikes. One time they may be like "X is fine" then the next they're like "OH NO X IS BAD DON'T SAY X."
---
More like when you play against Hag
---
Its the same as messaging people on reddit because you dont like a comment they made, people just feel disconnected it seems like because its not real life (in the sense it's on a screen) and think somehow it's ok to be an ass because it's not real to them or they're just jerks, which either way is pathetic to me
---
It's sucks tho
---
By rank, did you actually mean level or does my rank actually affect my shard rewards, because there doesn't seem to be any difference in the number of shards I'll get at rank 15 than rank 11
---
One post using this image gets popular and it gets reused within a day. Love this sub.
---
Right???
---
You can lvl up your killer without actually play killer. And once your killer is rank 15ish, the queues are much faster than survivors.
---
That‚Äôs just the way it goes man. If you‚Äôre a karma whore (like me) just look at the signs and subs. Some comments and jokes might fit one sub but not another, I know I‚Äôm preaching to the choir.
---
But this sub apparently hates Kanye. So I stopped posting about Ye. Just know your audience.
---
How is it hard to mind game her? I mean I don't want to be rude but even red ranks spirit pre-patch were easy to counter just by slowly walking away..?
---
so you having to be in humping distance to see glowing shards?
---
fair enough, but it is still annoying that all week ive only gotten 1 survivor daily and the rest killer, even after replacing one everyday and actually completing 2 killer ones
---
Honestly, the reason I personally do it when I'm playing as a survivor is because I hate the fact that I can spend upwards of 10 to 15 minutes looking for a match sometimes; plus actually staying in a match without any Lobby Dodgers to finally load into a match just to be focused down intentionally or even face camped and only had the joy of playing for roughly about 4 to 5 minutes before inevitably being sacrificed and having to start the whole waiting process again. That's personally why even as a survivor I try to make sure that the Killers don't get gen rushed by taking my personal time to go for hook rescues, cleanse totems, and even search chests. Then when I play as killer I purposely try to make the game a little more fun by not singling down survivors unless they've been acting toxic towards me by acting like a complete jerk off and tbagging etc.
---
I love going against any killer, even legion or doctor, but i hate going against hags because its usually not fun
---
You do you man. Play however is fun for you
---
"hey bubba is pretty bad at anything but facecamping so fuck it, lets make his whole mfin power facecamping" 
---
really? that's the best you could do?
---
I like running resilience for the vaulting speed
---
Press space next time
---
her perks would be "gettin smashed by me harder than i smash ds after it saves me from a facecamper"
---
Back in my day, we killed some one and didnt HAVE to take a photo of it!
---
In a poll they shared on Twitter one of the questions was about crossplay. I think it would be great to increase the player-base but survivors on console playing against certain killers on PC could be at a disadvantage, I assume.
---
This makes me think of a game today where I sacrificed myself for an Ace who was crawling to the exit...only to have his game crashed right before he escaped. Entity just doesn‚Äôt give a shit anymore.
---
Sashimi is cut, raw fish. Sushi is technically just the rice used for rolls. Sashimi works better.

Personally I'd say no to buying tiers. I recommend play what you can, and then buy the premium version if you feel you got enough value out of it. But then I'm a bit cheap so that may be my bias. 
---
The hallowed blight currency can be spent on certain cosmetics. 30 serum gets you 1 outfit or 10 serum will buy you a piece (head/body/pants/weapon). The list of characters with outfits are;
---
* Trapper - King of the Hooks
---
* Wraith - Seeping Hollow
---
* Hillbilly - Osseous Carcus
---
* Doctor - Foul Bile
---
* Huntress - Growth Surge
---
* Nurse - Foul Nightingale
---
* Hag - Scorched Harvester
---
* Clown - Seething Entertainer
---
* Spirit - Blazing Lineage
---
* Plague - Servant of the Serum
---
* Dwight - Vigo's Apprentice
---
* Claudette - Vigo's Pupil
---
* Jake - Vigo's Marauder
---
Honestly this killer was being total dick. Yet I feel bad cause I'm left assuming the person is taking all their anger and frustrations out while playing. If that was my friend I honestly would suggest talking to someone. 
---
I genuinely think the same when I see toxic tbagging survivors
---
No. He‚Äôs a little too unsympathetic. Most of the survivors don‚Äôt have a body count. At least not a human one. Not counting Bill ‚Ä¶ üòí
---
[deleted]
---
Plague main here, gonna shoot myself in the foot and tell you
---
Indoor maps and very large maps feel free to cleanse SO LONG AS she's not right next to you
---
Medium sized maps cleanse if you doubt you're looping ability
---
Definitely cleanse during EGC
---
Her Corrupt is countered by high walls and breaking LoS around corners so if you can stick with those you can negate her advantage
---
Cleansing is always a gamble but sometimes it'll benefit you to not be a 1 hit down rather than worry about ranged damage that will hit you once and give you a speed boost
---
Ace in the baby
---
So you think a good swf without perks wouldn't beat a killer without perks to slow the game down? Yikes..
---
Yessssss!!!! ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
While I do like the clip please give credit to the original creator
---
O shoot ur right
---
It's why the game is unplayable this community is full of cry babies. Someone gets downed in under 30 seconds standing out in the open not looking around either deaf or blind they quit and do the same thing next game. 
---
When they don't get downed quickly they don't play the game and when they barely see the team struggling like 3 injured and 2 gens left they still leave cause it's all about them. 
---
Then there's the type where if someone doesn't unhook them right after they get hooked they let go. By the way immediately unhooking survivors is just farming and so stupid your just promoting camping.
---
As long as she doesn‚Äôt have apple add on, cleansing before 5 gens is pointless IMO. Let me briefly explain why is it pointless. First of all she can make you sick all the time. She doesn‚Äôt have any cool downs on her vile purge. She sees you, she pukes on you and make you sick. You‚Äôll go and cleanse, she‚Äôll eventually see you again, she will puke you and she will make you sick again. Not only that, your teammates can make you sick too. Unhooking them, working on a generator with them will make you sick too. You‚Äôll be constantly sick. So why would you give her corrupt purge for free. Also all these cleansing will take so much time, if you cleanse every time you get sick. Also if one survivor cleanse, it forces the other survivors to cleanse as well. Think about it. Would you like to play against corrupt purge plague, when you are broken. No. You are dead if she sees you while corrupt purge is active. At least you can still loop her when she doesn‚Äôt have corrupt. 
---
Just tell him that he shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of being broken and just do gens if he is not getting chased. From my experience the team who just focus on gens against plague, wins most of the time(I mean at least 3 escapes). It was exact opposite when people keep cleansing all the time. As I said apple can be the only exception. Tbh it depends on how she uses that apple. If she drinks immediately, then there is nothing to worry about. But if she drinks that after making all 4 of you sick, a big fat F.
---
thank you very much
---
This is so cute. I love it.
---
Killers aren't the only victims. There is no argument against the fact that tunneling someone every second of the game and face camping are both just ways of playing designed to ruin the game for others, but is tossed away and referred to by killer mains as "strategies".
---
cute. i wanna see one with the roles reversed too because it's pretty fun sneaking up on a ghostface when he thinks he's being sneaky
---
Yeah but... How long ago were BPS a brown offering?
---
I'm in love with your art style. Wonderful.
---
Same thing happened to me
---
That's another thing though; They're all doing stalk-kills right out of the gate. None of them are trying for gen grabs.
---
1. Pop as many totems as you can. I play solo and can usually get 3-4 totems in a game easily.
---
2. Don't be an idiot in the endgame. Anytime I see people bitch about NOED it's because they were tbagging at the exit gate or otherwise acting like an idiot. Just play safe and you'll be fine. 
---
I've been downed by NOED maybe twice in the past hundred games because I play safe and pop totems. 
---
Literally any Hex is an easy counter, that's why they're powerful.
---
Depends on the context of when they said it. If they were testing it in a private lobby, nah that's not bullshit. But reliably in normal matches? Yeah ain't happenin'.
---
Before EGC I would just look at my phone untill the survivors would leave. I dont see how its somewhat worse when the killer stalls the game.
---
damn that must have been such a farm
---
Alright, I'm not one for suggesting anything, but the secondary power seems less useful for makeing him a viable killer, maybe a chainsaw rework and a faster speed would be nice.
---
On everything but her base skin.
---
I definitely think plague needs a buff, such as she gets her corrupt purge after 120 seconds. making a survivor perform an action though after a certain amount of time such as legion is annoying and shouldn't be her rework to that. and if you do, make it something more like the jigsaw traps.
---
Yeah usually there's some sort of negative for console players when crossplaying pc. The framerate for console killers would also be disadvantageous I feel.
---
when u actually think people care that you have ttv in your name

I wonder if they opted against Nancy because Stranger Things was already a possibility for them.
---
NEW FROM WB ENTERTAINMENT, WATCH AS OUR BELOVED FRIENDS GO HEAD TO HEAD WITH THE ENTITY!
---
That is also true. I hope that either the game can be optimized better to run on consoles, so the frames are smoother or that progress can be saved to the next gen of consoles and hope the problem is fixed by then.
---
Just use corrupt then place and activate portals on the four unblocked gens, from there just chase people or branch out to other gens and check your OG four portals often for activity.
---
I‚Äôve found that really helps him fix his early game presence and ruin isn‚Äôt even really required.
---
Oh nothing, as I said in the title no problem at all, definitely.
---
Any killer adept is way more difficult than it should be
---
He needs a buff and you know it
---
Nothing, as I said in the title. Not like the plague is an infinitely puking animation or anything
---
nice repost
---
My friends and I have a theory that the game gives you more daily rituals on one side based on which you play less. We mostly play the game as a group so 99% of the time I get killer rituals.
---
nah fam you gotta be careful
---
He‚Äôs actually closer to it as you think. 
---
Lore wise, the killer primary job is not killing the survivors (that‚Äôs actually secondary), it‚Äôs feeding the entity. 
---
The entity feeds on extreme emotions and these trials are trying to extract ‚Äúhope‚Äù out of the survivors.  
---
It‚Äôs why steamrolling survivors gives you a depip,  
---
it‚Äôs why a hatch spawns when a single survivor remains and  
---
it‚Äôs also why short chases doesn‚Äôt fill the survivors with hope because they get downed too fast to hope for escape.
---
I'm not even a Ttv and I just went across this build. and I hate it.
---
Loving the numbers. Awesome post.
---
Slippery game: Tremendously increases the chances of having a sweaty trial
---
Don't listen to them!
---
Serious talk now, why os 1 oit pf 4 survivors always so far away? Ots like "no, we do not like him/her"
---
I doubt it. We got the 2010 version of the movie which does have a Nancy in it, but it‚Äôs not the Og version. I think they chose Quentin because his character was probably easier to add into the game because of copyright reasons and all that.
---
Its satisfying I'll give you that
---
At times we as killers gotta know when we are bested and go after others. I remember one time I was up against 4 very great survivors on Lampkin Lane and not gonna lie I just gave up went to the basement and just stared at a corner. Funny enough even when they powered all the gens they were all in the basement running in circles basically taunting me.
---
Thanks man :)
---
You can be hit in the other side. I've hit plenty of people who weren't vaulting through windows.
---
Begins hoping
---
Agreed. So how is it different from letting a survivor bleed out
---
I think a lot of people get so used to being BMed on the side they usually play that they don't realize the same thing happens on the other side. Being toxic isn't a survivor or killer issue, its a player issue. If you play a lot of both sides you'll quickly figure out that some people who play this game are toxic no matter what.
---
The guy who tbags at the exit gate is probably the same one who stands by hooked survivors puking, throwing bottles, or chainsawing them. The person that said "gg ez baby killer" in post game chat is the same person who mori spams a survivor. 
---
Best thing you can do is move on and ignore them. If anything you should feel sorry for them as I can't imagine they have that great of a life outside of video games if they get off by being jerks online.
---
Stand right on the edge where when we down you you then escape
---
I'm not triggered at all lmao. I find it genuinely sad that you even remotely had the impulse to firstly respond by correcting my word usage. I dont give a flying fuck about your experiences, hence me saying it was just a theory.. er.. hypothesis.
---
Exactly. I lost my save file back in October of 2017 and along with it my Legacy 2 Dwight. I sent them an email, got 16 million BP to level up all my characters a month after. No Legacy. Asked in an email, they said they couldn't give players Legacy back because they "aren't able to at the moment" or something like that.
---
Asked again a year later. Sent them an email with screenshots, achievement dates, every piece of proof they could ask and they just said the exact same thing along with "We'll use this email as future reference for when we are able to give them back."
---
I don't really play Dwight anymore, but I really miss my glow-in-the-dark Entity jizz.
---
That not Otzdarva guy is really killing my business and ruining everything really
---
Ok boomer.
---
Damn. You right. Gotta see a shrink...
---
By t bagging I mean your back is to the killer too. Crouching while you‚Äôre facing me I take as friendly.
---
isnt hag free???
---
Thank you!!!
---
Wait right at the line between the end-point and gate, so you fall in as sokn as you get knocked down. If you're healthy, just stay where you are (assuming you could escape during the cooldown) until the slap, then run out.
---
You must be very bad at tracking then.
---
It's a hard nock life
---
That lil ghost face is adorable ;-;

The guy sabotaged the hook when I was carrying Feng so I just said "fuck it" and moried her.

For all wanting to know when this was, bps was changed to rare in patch 1.8.2, whatcha was in November 2017

Yes.

I was playing on rank reset against a group of p2 and p3 Claudettes and megs. I figure out they all have decisive so i imploy the killer technique of dropping them immediately to fail their decisive. One disconnects and i end up playing a game against two people after i sacrfice one who wont come near the gens because im 3 genning. I get one, down the other, close the hatch. She uses unbreakable and escapes and i get pissed as fuck
---
Reason it's still in is if you see someone right at the start of the mori animation so you can begin a chase with them instead. At least that's the reasoning that has been given.

These comments saying to not generalize streamers don't seem to understand that 99% of people with TTV in their name or a pink hair Nea with Prestige clothing and a flashlight. They usually have lower rank survive with friend buddies so they can bully the Killer.
---
I'm not saying all are like that. I'm just saying from my personal experience and a lot of other people's. A lot of the time it's just some noob3 wannabe but sometimes they can be pretty chill. I usually give them bits if that's the case
---

Its absolutely still active and the devs have committed to supporting it for the next 5 years so there's no reason to think it'll be dying anytime soon.

I just realised you dont have to acquire every quest after you finish it - so this is the most optimal way to save as much bp as possible for this tome's level
---
Yeah, be a passive aggressive little shitbird when I show that I'm actually somewhat intelligent and not some innocent reddit user that you can pick on. What a fucking sad life you must live, being such an angry loser.
---
Maybe you didn't watch it with sound? it's hard to understand what's going on without sound.
---
But like others said: the killer was bringing a survivor to a hook, but the hook got sabotaged by the time he got there. So, he just decided to use his Mori instead
---
DC for hatch isn't even that bad.
---
Ive been angrily messaged post game as killer (im on ps4) where people decry me for being a ‚Äòcampy three gen bitch‚Äô despite me bringing only three perks, playing the doctor, generally trying to have fun while they all bring self care, DS and other meta perks. Also: if one person is toxic and Dcs i dont have to play nice and leaving the tree closest gens not done isnt my fault
---
And the alternative is going around the map for 2+ minutes looking for someone to heal them? Makes perfect sense.
---
Slippery Evasion
---
I mean, look at him. If there was one killer who I could picture posting insane shit on deviantart, it would be Herman.
---
I actually was about to make a post about this. I put my best add ons and offerings to try and do a trial just now, and they dc'd before the match even started. Really isn't cool
---
Wow no credit

Hillbilly is braindead boring to play though.

Can someone link me where they have said all these balance changes.

Look, i cant hit greats so i run small game when i play with my high rank friend and find the ruin

Idk ruin as base might be too strong. I just hate billy. Mainly bc back in the day it was either nurse or billy and I could counter nurse more than billy. And that‚Äôs always with me now. My hate for billy as a killer. I won‚Äôt use him and any time I see him I‚Äôm a pos to him. I‚Äôve gotten rank 1 surv and rank 2 killer. Bubba (leatherface) isn‚Äôt a great option if you wanna rank up. Killer is much harder to rank up imo. But not overly difficult. Just comparatively it‚Äôs much harder. And if ruin is a base on every killer would it still be deactivated via totem? If so they‚Äôd have to add another totem to the game making it 6 per game. At least. I think Freddy is in a GREAT spot rn. And demo is a fun killer to play and to play against. Really balanced. Really fun imo. Both sides. I just think they need to work on servers for a bit. Then start releasing killers and survivors again. I dislike when companies refuse to focus and buckle down on problems. Like dead hard just not working sometimes cuz dedicated servers. Or hots going through that shouldn‚Äôt. While they release new content. Then while they pump content out they can work on more balance. I think 90 second gens or even 100 would be decent. And it would make BNP even better. Which I don‚Äôt mind.
---
It still gives out decent bloodpoints though, it's basically BBQ and Chilli for survivors.
---
Streamer bad, Mori and facecamp good.
---
Just gesture towards you. They tend to get it.
---
A big tip for killer communication is to watch their face. Killers often use their camera to communicate, so look for a nod or shake of the head to help indicate what their thoughts are in any given moment.
---

Nah. The woman screaming at the cat is what I‚Äôve seen the most tbh.
---
Doesn't have to be off of sacrifices, could just be off of spilling the blood of Survivors (i.e. injuring them).  
---
From there he could interact with the trail of blood they leave or something.
---
I feel like getting hunted down by your future Killer self is a torment right up the Entity‚Äôs alley.
---
Nice! I hadn't checked if you can do that, awesome info, ty.
---
Lmao this is a good one!
---
Fun fact, Heather Langenkamp co-owns a special FX makeup company now. She still does horror all these years later, just behind the scenes rather than in front of the camera.
---
check out the description of Yamaoka Estate in the custom game menu. The original Yamaoka was a total badass.
---
Yes!
---
My suggestion is do some KYF games and let them learn the dynamics of the game that way first.  Although it won‚Äôt be exact as SYF when the go in public matches, it will help immensely in the end.
---
Man it's so weird seeing comments like this cause I havent waited more than 5 minutes for a survivor game in such a long time. Killer queues are the one that take forever for me
---
And/or they just got this one finished after doing the other video.
---
Is the file up on thingiverse or any other sites? It looks great
---
So what's the strategic value in teabagging? Because that just slows you down in a chase. If you want to pull something like "It upsets the Killer to make them play less effectively," the mori spam would create a similar effect to onlooking Survivors.
---
&gt;hey fuck negativity
---
Ironic.
---
Check my profile for level 2 with unclaimed quests :)
---
Okay I‚Äôm a moron but I didn‚Äôt find the bit about the ancestor. It said something about an honorable legacy being tainted because the house was in disrepair as the daughter entered university, something about moldy walls patched cheaply and the old anger bit
---
Do you have a screenshot or smth? Cause I think I‚Äôm too dumb to find it lmao
---
she is one of the most iconic final girls in slasher history so she should be a survivor
---
but they could only get the rights to remake nancy who sucked and its the original or nothing
---
at least we got stranger things nancy who is loosely based on nancy thompson
---
Yeah, fair enough. Some of his comments read like he's taking a word and then auto-filling the rest of the sentence one word at a time. But then others seem to have too much "cohesion" for that.
---
Man, can't wait for Carl as our new survivor this chapter.
---
Eh, it's less crazy than the RWBY x Smite crossover.
---
What‚Äôs a Nikka? Is that your kind of people?
---
Did anyone dc while on the hook? Those count for whispers
---
But they did implement the EGC, so it's clear that isn't approved of.
---
You could make another steam account and share your library to it. So you have a fresh dbd char.
---
Friend said I should run ruin at rank one rare or thrill of the hunt?
---
I'm almost willing the bet this was connection based. She was skipping all over the place.
---
Okay, but I'm never mori spamming unless it's to a teabagger.
---
when you have to be technical
---
The vast majority of perks "reward you for doing nothing"
---
I hated that challenge so much it took me all fucking  day to do it
---
That is terrifying
---
Except it doesn‚Äôt need one? Lol
---
I have the opposite.
---
As if a killer main could ever admit they a survivor is better then they are and instead go back to the usual "sUrViOrS aRe OP pLz NeRf!"
---
Just do what i do. Go after another survivor and thin out the numbers you will be more likey to get them that way.  More used pallets creating danger zones or less survivors doing gens/doing less unhooks. Can turn a 0k/1k game into a 3k or even a 4k. Pick and choose your battles, don't let your ego get the better of you.
---
using a green and purple add-on for that is seriously not worth it, Legion does have better add-ons
---
At night, the Survivors check their closets for Killers.
---
The Killers check their closets for the Entity (except the cool ones).

The Entity checks its closet for Generators.
---
New Survivor: Francis.
---
Special unique ability: bitches constantly to Bill about what he hates.
---
ok kiddo
---
Only on console
---
And it was fine before too, what is wrong with the servers?
---
Let me put it this way... if they're not on the gen they're not progressing it anyways, they dont give a FUCK about that gen, and if they do, they will be on it anyways, it LITERALLY doesnt effect survivors unless you pick someone up right as they let go of the gen to like, pick their nose or some shit.
---
~~I mean it took a few years~~
---
Meh, I see your point. 
---
Still shouldn't be bannable. The devs should implement a way to combat this rather than just banning people.
---
Sounds like too many people play killer.
---
Way too many players don't get that.
---
Yeah, there are good loops. And no, it's not any kind of abusing game mechanics, they're intended to be there (since I saw people claiming it be like that). 
---
Infinites aren't a thing anymore. Period. 
---
Sometimes it's better to just leave the chase or don't even start to chase at all if you know there's a strong loop around.
---
What's not a thing in red ranks that often anymore, it's always nice to chase down the pallet waster and let it throw down some pallets so you have a "dead area" without any left. 
---
Yeah, of course there will be still vaults around. But if you play it right, you'll always win as the killer role this kind of chase.
---
I may sound toxic/rude but I'm just annoyed by people claiming things that aren't true as a fact.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Yamaoka_Estate lore section here has it
---
Yeah likely they'll do a chapter reveal Monday.  Or save it for when the PTB launches Tuesday.
---
Xoomer
---
Hm maybe u see the killers aura for 5 secs same with bbq for Survs lol
---
No, just retreat back to it whenever he comes up
---
Leave if you're the last one; it's not worth it.
---
Face the Killer, staying crouched is optional but don't teabag.
---
Leaving an item is a particularly kind gesture.
---
Stay near the exit; some Killers are babies or assholes and will hook you if they can off a gift hit.
---
If it takes 5 minutes for 5 generators to get done, between 3 people.... that is a perfect example of gens being too easy to complete. Lol if it takes like 10 minutes, that a different story.
---
I did it with demogorgon and the longer undetectable add on.
---
Don‚Äôt worry bro, after the patch you can stand perfectly still as survivor as a ‚Äúmindgame‚Äù.
---
This happened to me too.
---
That's pretty smart

It's usually around a full second you should start leaving, but on maps with different heights this may vary.
---
How exactly is fire up in any way more skillful than noed? Be honest. You just dont like it because its powerful, and fire up is worthless garbage. If it actually did something good I bet youd hate it too.
---
How does it feel having a Micro-Penis?
---
He was born in 1978 if we're going by Billy Loomis, and Dead by Daylight's ghostface is around the same age of not older so...
---
You can move in an arc as you swing and drag your attack a bit, or just try to spook them into doing it prematurely. It's also harder to 360 non-lunge attacks.
---
The trick is to not chase that one. Find the weaker few and kill them one by one till the toxic god looper is alone and you have all the time In the world.
---
Am I detecting the slightest bit of wacism???
---
If the power required hooks, like how Pop works, it wouldn't lead to too much camping.
---
but it was working fine a couple months earlier and i tried this at all different times of the day
---
i nearly jumped out of my seat earlier. i didn't know the killer was ghosty and just happened to turn my camera to find him practically spooning me
---
PGTW is pretty meta. Enduring is only useful if you find yourself getting hit a lot.
---
Fair enough, thank you for elaborating.
---
He wasn‚Äôt a virgin anymore...
---
yes
---
and they're definitely not supposed to count for whispers, must be a bug
---
 bhvr learn how to not fuck up your game every patch
---
Skill check
---
I'll accept it.
---
If you don‚Äôt pressure enough, and leave 3 people working on a gen while you only focus one person what are you really expecting? 
---
Also like the op was saying, if it takes you 5 min to hook 1 person (leaving the other 3 to do nothing but work on gens) that‚Äôs not gen rushing that‚Äôs just playing killer poorly. 
---
I play killer at high ranks all the time and my games last an average of 15 min because I pressure multiple people and don‚Äôt commit to chasing one survivor for too long.
---
I wished walking didnt set off her trap so damn annoying without urban evasion or a flashlight
---
Right?! Lmao
---
you don't seem to understand how actually strong is to continue swinging chainsaw AND keeping all acceleration after breaking a pallet with it.
---
Are you on Instagram?
---
I usually check out twitch links myself. I've made so many friends by checking out channels and getting to know the streamer, their mods and other regulars. In fact someone I met roughly 8 months ago I am now a mod for, and I would consider them to be one of my best friends.
---
This is what I‚Äôve always thought to be the best choice and what‚Äôs most fair... though with maybe 30/45/60 seconds of fast healing instead of 30/60/90. Most people heal at the hook anyway.
---
BBQ is meta. 
---
It only makes sense WGLF would be too.
---
The master will be proud of my find
---
All hail legion
---
If their intentionally toxic I just tunnel them and let the rest go.
---
U cant have it any other way haha
---
Frenzy is terror radius based so that helps. But if you use monitor &amp; abuse it gives you more range when in chase while also letting you get closer to the survivors without them knowing you're there.
---
It doesn't apply the 10% explosion penalty. The closest you can get to that happening is if a survivor was working on it and got a skill check when the explosion happened, and that caused them to miss the skill check. 
---
However, Surge is definitely underrated. The explosion causes a 3 second delay in continued repairing of the generator if a survivor was working on it at the time, and the 8% damage it deals takes 6 seconds for a single survivor to repair, so you can delay a gens completion by 9 seconds using Surge by itself. While this can be clutch in some situations, it's not always reliable. 
---
Where Surge really shines however, is when it's paired with Dying Light and/or Thanatophobia. I've done the math on using DL+Thana+Surge, and I've got to say, It's nasty. My current Favorite build for Plague is DL, PGTW, Thana, Surge, Mainly because:
---
No one likes to cleanse against Plague, resulting in Thana keeping itself at full debuff all game long.
---
Plague primarily downs survivors with 1 shot basic attacks because they don't cleanse, meaning that Surge activates almost every time it's available.
---
DL's healing speed bonus for your obsession is useless against Plague.
---
Here's where Surge is at its most nasty: DL+Thana slow down gen repairs, meaning the 8% damage Surge does to them takes longer and longer to repair the more stacks of DL and Thana you gain. A team fully injured and fighting against 4 stacks of DL are repairing gens 28% slower. This means that the 8% no longer takes 6 seconds to repair... it takes 13 seconds + the 3 second explosion delay, and at 6 stacks of DL + full Thana this goes up to 16.63 seconds + the 3 second explosion delay! Surge with this combo not only saves you time on kicking the gens yourself for no additional damage, it also buys you more time to prevent the survivors from finishing off a gen, and if that's how long it takes them to make up for Surge's damage: Just Imagine how much longer it takes when the gen is hit by PGTW's 25% damage.
---
This build is incredible on the Plague (and High rank viable I might add) because she gets the most benefit from it with little counter play to it, and it puts the survivors between a rock and a hard place every time.
---
My killer queue is literally usually only like 3 minutes at max I feel
---
Never take an ebony mori into a iridescent head game. I made that mistake once. Game was over in about 4 minutes and I got absolute shit points.
---
One or the other, never both.
---
Give credit smh
---
twitch.tv/umbra
---
I'm a rank 4-3 killer main and I know that pressuring survivors is a big deal. But to pretend that generators being done in 45 seconds with a lot of maps designed they are is dumb. Especially when each survivor is actually GOOD at kiting killers. The better survivors are at kiting the more it makes 45 second completions on generators between 3 people is dumb. I've had games where I could barely find anyone on corn field maps and about a minute in 3 generators pop. Because I wasn't playing a killer that could teleport or sprint from one side of the map to the other, it was near impossible to apply pressure.
---
&gt; survivors 
---
Im gonna either see if monitor is in the shrine this week, or when I get legion to a high enough level, then I will level up doc. But thank you so much for informing me. I was curious about it while watching the casefile by that guy who makes it when he says it adds to your terror radius. Again, thank you, so much.
---
Neat
---
It‚Äôs just ironic because they think being good at the easy role means anything. These kids that act like toxic survivors are never good killers.
---
An Ace used Head On on me while I was playing Legion, I chase him for about a min because the others are busy healing and mending and when I finally down him he randomly DCs. Note that I already hooked 2 people by this point and this was his first down.
---
I‚Äôm not necessarily a bad killer but occasionally I‚Äôll have games where I realise I‚Äôm spending too much time on one survivor and chase another off a gen, the survivor I was just chasing goes on a gen and nothing changes apart from the survivor and before you know it I‚Äôm getting teabagged at the exit gates .. then other games Illl chase one survivor for what seems like forever and only one gen gets popped,
---
Yep! Just the same user as this! Courtenbae üòä
---
It did this to me as well. However, every challenge after it‚Äôs been counting one extra point towards the challenge progression.
---
Yeah, like after they do it tough. Don't Tbag knowing other killers (not the one you're playing against) will do this
---
Does anyone remember sexleg?
---
Just me? Ok.
---
Sorry if you said that, I don't see that on mobile reddit I guess.
---
Have you not seen the equal side thing everywhere
---
Actually ran into that three or so times yesterday when I was playing killer. Even made me feel a little for the rest of the team.
---
This is illegal
---
Such is life on Volg
---
Well based off your current grammar I‚Äôd HATE to be the one that has to read your research papers lol
---
They say there is an appeal system, but when you try to appeal they won‚Äôt let you and they stonewall your emails and don‚Äôt respond. You‚Äôre welcome to try and email them but don‚Äôt expect much. 
---
https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
I'd like it be just hold ngl...
---
It really depends, I personally would run if you‚Äôre in their terror radius and it‚Äôs on for more than 1 or 2 seconds. Sometimes if you‚Äôre in a basement/different floor it will keep lighting up but they‚Äôll probably not know where you are unless you‚Äôre doing a gen or something while on a different floor (maps like the stranger things map or the clown map) and they stay looking at you. hopefully this all made sense lol
---
Imagine thinking you ‚Äúwin‚Äù when you dc when you get zero points and deny the killer a mere 375 (1000-625)
---
No
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous. I just reset to 14 and it seems like every match I get into is a 4 person swf in upper green ranks. Im getting better at managing them but fuck if it still isn‚Äôt a stomp usually. I just want balanced matchmaking. We need a different lobby for casual games that allows group play and a ranked lobby that doesn‚Äôt.
---
Lol, big facts. Survivor mains are such a joke üòÇ
---
bans for first offense are usually 24hrs right? like i have 1.5k hours and have never had trouble even when i was toxic ages ago, and now i get banned for WHAT? lol
---
XD Gotta love talking to trolls that can't actually put together a logical argument, so they result to throwing out insults.
---
It depends. I got a 1 week ban for my first offense.
---
I literally did nothing lol. They won't perma ban for nothing, right?
---
Remember guys, teabag from safe distance! Dont go to the no no zone while doing it!
---
Just tunnel them next time
---
Just started using spine chill in my go to build, and I love it so much. It has so many uses. My favorite use is that it can help figuring out if killers have aura reading perks. If a killer has BBQ &amp; Chili you‚Äôll typically see spine chill activate for a second and then deactivate because the killer will survey where everyone is at and not just stare at you. Sometimes I‚Äôll do a test and heal and if spine chill activates they typically have the perk that lets them see you when you heal. Also another tip is to not stay at gens in the beginning of the match when spine chill is activated. They don‚Äôt have much else to do than check gens in the beginning of the match so spine chill usually gurantees they‚Äôre headed towards your gen.
---
We're not getting a survivor this time
---
It's rough out here in the fog, man.
---
David's muscles keep distracting me when my attention is needed most.
---
I got boldness by running straight at the killer because I'm ~~suicidal~~ a tough guy
---
Dodge lobbies as a killer?
---
I'd start the match even if all of them had flashlights and were SWF. I'm not waiting 10 minutes to get into another lobby again &gt;:(
---
You don't have to button mash if you don't want to
---
They said they want to make it so you feel uncomfortable...
---
You may have an easier time appealing it as you‚Äôre a streamer and there have been known cases of streamers getting targeted by other players to and getting banned. 
---
I can‚Äôt tell ya what‚Äôll happen. üòûI wish ya good luck in your appeal my dude!
---
they probably don‚Äôt have franklins LMAO that‚Äôs a game changer
---
I loled so hard.
---
We are watch üòò
---
That would be toxic farming galore unfortunately
---
Play nurse
---
My killer queues are like 5 secs. Survivor queue is normally 5-10min tho. That‚Äôs probably why it is annoying when the killer dodge the lobby.
---
let's see you talk your shit without franklins
---
I mean I feel more frustrated doing it than uncomfortable, maybe just periodic skill checks on hook instead would make me more uncomfortable
---
I've never seen this but OK
---
Yeah as a survivor I wait 5 min on PS4. Killer it takes about 10 seconds which is why they dodge a lot on this platform if they don‚Äôt like what they see.
---
Farming won‚Äôt really be banned most of the time. It is different from teaming with the killer, which means you show the killer where are other survivors and intentionally body block them etc.
---
Nothing wrong with NOED, easy enough to counter
---
It doesn't reward you for failure, though.
---
It punishes Survivors for not taking the time to cleanse bones.
---
I mean, I can slap NoED, Fire Up, STBFL, and Bloodwarden on my Perk Slots. Am I really being "Rewarded" for failure or am I playing a build that wants to get to that late game? This is a high risk (Very little time to be "online" compared to most builds) high reward playstyle, and I'm not failing at any objective I have.
---
Ok, here goes nothing.
---
Deeze nutz
---
More like Tru3Ta1ent when anything doesn't go his way.
---
And then it progresses much slower so you won't get another 9000 for twice as long. Try not to spend them on shrine either
---
The points are meaningless, just leave so the killer can move on to a new game
---
Usually is, but if you do it right, you get hit once and the dude escapes. Very situational.
---
Yeah, that's what I thought pussy
---
Lol when I first started playing, I used to get so mad at how many stealth killers there were. Hated Mikey and Ghostface the most til I figured out how to counter them.
---
assuming you're on PC: making a separate steam account and sharing your library via family share is the easiest way to solve this problem. any DLC packs you've bought via steam will carry over but it'll be like playing on a fresh account. all lv1s, rank 20, etc which, since you're going to be playing *mostly* vs lower rank/new killers anyway, is a pretty reasonable sacrifice
---
Nothing wrong with NOED
---
The entity might have talked to rins father in order to set up the whole murder scene. This way the entity was able to grab not one but two murderous souls. It might have only gone for one of them originally, but then it saw the side effect of the other one being corrupted aswell
---

I had this yesterday. Guy was put in the basement and a trapper wouldn't leave. I had to disarm the trap to get in the shack and the trapper would just chase me out and keep patrolling. My teammate told me I was an idiot :(
---
Damn b, nice idea
---
Lmao
---
üò≥üò≥üò≥
---
And maybe in 700 more hours you'll learn a better tactic is to take out the stronger players at the start, leaving the "weaker" ones to either play better/more efficient or cause more problems that I could hunt them down for. 
---
And maybe this is just 1 more in a long list of anti-tunneling, anti-toxic behavior memes. 
---
Most killers I face at red ranks don't camp and only slug when tactically smart. But lower ranks? Every other game. 
---
Sorry it triggered you. Gg to the future.
---
I like the floaty bits
---
Also as the person on the hook and occasionally the killer, get the fuck out, you're not helping.
---
Don't mind if I do.

What's karma?

Thanks for the advice. Now that you said it, I just realized that I underestimate killers patrolling gens a lot.

I've been both lol

When you wait 10 minutes to join a lobby then the match ends bc someone left during the load screen.
---
I can see being able to loop her now if you are smart cause of no collision
---
Sounds like the amount effort it takes to hook up with... I think you know where I'm going with this.
---
This is getting out of hand, now there are 2 of them.
---
Most seem to be dead channels with no content anyway from my experience whenever I check out their channels.
---
Everyone knows Spectator Mains are the only players who *really* understand how the game works. You wouldn't get non-spectator
---
Man that was DEAD ON.... I'll show myself out
---
They are both stalkers. Both can be fun but also punished. 
---
Michael has less chances to be punished and his stalking gives Exposed to all survivors for a limited time, however you can only stalk each survivor so much until they have a red aura and you can't stalk anymore. His perks are pretty solid. 
---
Ghostface can only stalk per person and apply a very short Exposed per survivor. You can mark multiple if you have a clear view of all of them. However, his undetectable Night Shroud power can be broken if a survivor looks at him long enough. Ghostface is now an "M1" killer until his power replenished. You must learn where to stalk from so the survivors don't see you otherwise you will not enjoy playing as him. His perks are decent to ok with I'm All Ears being his best, IMO.

Till one of us dies and proves the other the superior being
---
I place one trap and the rest at paths radiating out from the hook. Never bunched up at the base
---
The phase sound is truly bugged. I hear them in TR sometimes, other times I don't her it outside of TR made me thinking prayer beads is used while it's not
---
That's a bit intense, They just made some noticeable changes that completely change how effective she is
---
Wow.  Reddit really does have everything.
---
Because Ghostface is at FULL POWER in those maps.
---
Can't blame em for doing that.
---
Exactly.
---
After a good bootyraping of claudette and meg, i turned then out.

Well, don't keep us waiting. Was it the Hillbilly or Leatherface?

What?

Just suicide on 1st hook then, 4head
---
Depending on rng father cambells main building as well.
---
Perhaps a second addon
---
Camping and tunneling (if they have played long enough to know about it being bad) clicky clicky flashlights, abusing infinites to a horrendous extent, holding the game hostage (not as effective now, but still prevalent), end game chat harrassment, spamming mori.
---
And yet you commented.
---
Twice.
---
I‚Äôm just wanting to know if he‚Äôs still alive.
---
Or if the maps were more balanced
---
I already have to hear this from my girlfriend now I gotta see it on Reddit
---
I usually play doctor because the fact he isn‚Äôt a high tier killer, but having treatment ability at 115% would be really nice.
---
Lolol
---
I‚Äôm excited about Fallen order too not so much for death stranding because I keep hearing mixed feelings about it so I‚Äôm watching a gameplay walkthrough of it till I decide to buy it lol
---
Groovy.
---
I did consider it being SAFE unhook triggering the resistance, just so you can't farm right in front of Killers, but I can still see it going wrong at red ranks.
---
And yet, downvotes for fear the devs would come here and think people want this.
---
30 minutes minimum and penalty fornthe rest if the day of decreased bloodpoints gained by 25%
---
look at the yellow offering. there‚Äôs no more of them in the blood webs they took up space and were a waste
---
Survivor main here. Don‚Äôt see how survivors are a joke other than the toxic ones.
---
Honestly the only time I won't be lenient on DCs is if I'm trying to go for an adept, like I'm sorry, but doing a farming session to where I make sure people have 8k in every category and then having either Brutal or Ruthless Killer show up as the results is just the cherry on top of the demoralizing cake. Anything else and I'll probably just intentionally make mistakes in hopes of emulating an actual game. Either that or just farm with them.
---
I guess the point is that she might not be able to activate it again, but if choosing between Inner Strength or a medkit I'd choose the Inner Strength. Especially if time is of the essence.
---
Guess you're not bitter enough yet, experience taught me a survivor's thanks means absolutely nothing and the next time they see you and you don't give them special treatment they'll show their true colors
---
What was the comment about?

Can you tell them to fix pigs knees before they release her cosmetic too

* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.

That's why there's a PTB before a wide release. Consider it beta testing to work out bugs. Not all bugs are caught though and most of the time new bugs occur when others are fixed.

there‚Äôs two Dwight‚Äôs:

baby dweet, and battle hardened war torn loop the killer the whole game Dwight
---
there is no inbetween
---
Well, without going into the semantics, there's another reason Freddy and Bubba would hide: They're cowards.
---
Bubba's actual lore in DbD is that he's afraid of the Entity more than his family, and even in Freddy vs. Jason where Freddy got massively buffed, he nearly soiled himself when he realized he had to actually fight Jason in the physical world.
---
I‚Äôm glad you liked it!
---
Plague is great but pig is a bit more fun I think
---
fat chance since the next killer is maurice the horse
---
And then get angry and start a witchhunt against the devs and when exposed never mention it again and proceed with their fake ''hi cuties'' personality

Lol Ight

does it have r/watchpeopledie

Why even do it if it isn't fun?

I was gonna upvote, but then i saw the emoji.

Oh I see. I indeed wasn't watching with sound so I didn't see the sabo.

lmao why, they're extra bloodpoints

Atleast you only have 13. I have well over 100 that I won‚Äôt even get to use next year lol. RIP bloodpoints.
---
Tbf 2nd best out of only like 5 actual good killers doesnt mean much
---
Plague imo
---
If survivors are allowed to complain about perfectly valid things such as camping and tunneling then killers are allowed to complain about survivors doing their objective
---
Pig is the best, it's really fun to play, and is a cutie pie.
---
Plague looks good but i havent used her yet.

good for them :)

DeOn HaHe
---
Dude I will go to leave and I'll find a survivor, I chase and down then I see another so I slug. They are all running around the hook. What am I supposed to do, leave the hook?
---
So she does have the tell but cosmetics break it?
---
Fixing the cosmetics would be easier and less shitty than a nerf

It was a leaf blower lol scared me bc whod be using a leaf blower outside a Walmart after dark

I believe humor is the best medicine and the best way to move past something or take that rage and turn it into something else, releasing it from that bottle.
---
It's all luck and even the most skilled are caught up by bad/unlucky plays, bad teams, or being in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
---
I forget which streamer/YouTube player I watched who said that nobody will ever be so good they always get a 4-K or they will always escape. Maybe some more than others but the best killer will lose and the best survivor will die.
---
I do, good way to see which survivor is a complete moron who does not deserve any forgiveness or fair game

Not anymore thank the Nine Divine
---
Wait, you get points for being revealed?
---
Why doesn't Trapper get points for stepping in his own traps?
---
Yeah that's not really a true or relevant generalization but thank you for that..
---
It also is good against stealth killers (for obvious reasons) and especially the Spirit. Recently used it against a Spirit and chases are a lot easier for me now against her. I‚Äôm getting kinda good at looping so she‚Äôll try to juke me by phasing. At that point I‚Äôll typically try to gain as much distance as I can and hope she loses my trail. If spine chill deactivates, I know I can heal or sneak away before she finds my trail again. It doesn‚Äôt really help too much if you‚Äôre looping her around a pallet while she‚Äôs phasing tho. My only complaints about spine chill is that you have to constantly look at the bottom right hand of the screen to use it, and how paranoid it makes me when it activates and you‚Äôre against a stealth killer but you can‚Äôt see which direction they‚Äôre coming from to know if you should leave or not lmao.

Now show me on this doll where sharp hand joe touched you.

With money? Pig. You can save up 9k shards while playing her and get one of the others for free.
---
Clown is probably better unless you're at low ranks.
---
r/holup
---
So putting more toxicity into a game that's bursting at the seams with it is the right idea? Like I said maybe I just want to be nice for the sake of being nice and i dont expect something in return. Maybe try to be better than the people you so clearly hate.
---
I had a bunch from last year and was able to use them, so no worries, wish BhVR hadn‚Äôt been so greedy with only giving 3000 for each gen completed, should have been double and more people would have been burning them. I also hate how the bloodweb dumped out 3-4 every web, that was a waste.
---
Yes officer - this one here
---
you cant get banned for DC or for what looks like youre helping the killer. banning is for things like hacking. you can check it out on the official site. its actually sorta a beautiful thing when the killer knows the game is about fun, not winning. so ur answer is: just have fun! all i do is let survivors win (after hooking each one once for BBQ). they often catch on and know that im not actually trying to defeat them.
---
Instead of clockwise they go counter clockwise
---
The devs only really ban exploits (but even harmless ones like multiple Killer KYFs). Farming is totally safe, but just do gens and you're fine.
---
wat
---
And they say survivors aren't entitled
---
then they did a good job!
---
I have an Uncommon Signed Ledger Page on Dwight (Considerably increases the chances of being sent to the MacMillan Estate when burnt.) and then the Common Shredded Plate on Trapper (Slightly increases the chances of being sent to the Autohaben Wreckers when burnt.)
---
Both of these have since been unobtainable for a while now, since patch [1.8.0](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Patch_Notes_1.8.0)  to be exact.
---
i posted before, that what they should do is simply have the struggle animation, but no button pressing. to add to that, you should press a button to "Give up" if you want to. but that's it
---
I agree with this. Post some original content.
---
The only killer that will make survivors happy is one that doesn't have a power or a weapon
---
How about this : you gotta wait 5-10 min THEN you can queue up.

I showed this to my mom and then she just asked after a long pause, ‚Äú... how did he get in there? ü•∫‚Äù

---
True. Honestly idec if I die if I had a fun match. There have been quite a few matches that I died and still legitimately had lots of fun playing against the killer. It‚Äôs also worth the sacrifice if at least one other survivor gets the dub
---
I also play wraith so I definitely understand your argument and actually agree with it. 
---
What you‚Äôre saying about maps and killer powers not being designed effectively is definitely true and it definitely speaks more volume than ‚ÄúGEN SPEED BAD!1!!‚Äù
---
I am actually just as confused as you are
---
You you spawn to a generator in the middle of Coldwind. 
---
"Hah, this corn will surely protect me." You think to yourself, images of a frustrated Ghostface or confused Myers dancing through your head.
---
You get halfway through the generator and you hear it: The stomping.
---
"Oh no," you think, "it's The Wood." 
---
You hardly have time to react before both you and the generator are crushed into a fine powder by a giant log.
---
If you think giving up on a chase when you don‚Äôt know where any of the other survivors are is a good tactic: you‚Äôre tarded
---
Only to toxic survivors though, i enjoy putting them in their place when they farm the odd one out. Other than that during Tome month, i answer requests in my inbox to help with their tome challenges

It's how it is on Xbox and everyone knows it :) it's because most girls on Xbox are casual gamers.

I'm allowed to share my experiences after being on this game for over 750 hours. And I'm allowed to have my own opinion or take on things.
---
Black widow skin for meg. (Seriously as if we need another sport themed one for her)
---
I always thought it was cool how she did traps and stuff to fight against Freddy. Maybe something like being able to activate pallets with a delayed response, or activating a stun if the killer goes through the same window after a vault on a cool down. I would love the option to play as Robert Englund Freddy too.
---
Nah peeps will just use that...the sacrifice of a small number of innocents is worth the punish ment of the many manginas.
---
Honestly, is it even a theory at this point? I‚Äôm a survivor main and I haven‚Äôt gotten a survivor challenge since sometime before Stranger Things came out and I play the game quite frequently. Any time I do get a survivor challenge, I‚Äôll check it before I queue up for a match and whaddayaknow? It magically turned into a killer challenge :-|
---
To an extent yes, but its mostly just gonna delay the inevitable for another 7 seconds if its a good spirit. Plus you still have no way to tell if shes phasing or not so good luck lol
---
Yeah this isn't remotely true.  Good high rank killers play aggressively hook and leave to pressure gens.  If you have to resort to babycamps and tunnels for your kills that is what it is but don't paint the picture that we all play that trash because we don't.
---
I‚Äôll bet you call the killer a camper and a tunneler for looking in your direction when you are on the hook
---
I don't see anything.
---
I will almost be disappointed if this isn't the design they go with , this is sick as
---
Ohhhhhhhhhh...
---
Idk, survivors would just get used to it.
---
For a while it would brainfuck some people, then they'd just get over it
---
This 1 click option should also apply to Hook Escape Attempts
---
I decided I wanted to use Furtive Chase instead of just letting it sit there, and figured I might as well use my favorite killer, the modular medical man himself, Doc! Normally, with purple Calm and M&amp;A, you have a 16m TR, 12m if you add yellow Calm..
---
But I wanted to push it further, so in comes FC! Find the obsession asap, tier them at least ONCE (and only them if you can help it), hook em', leave. Make Your Choice will proc on unhook, and thus, the new obsession will be vulnerable. Arrive at the hook site, and try to zoom around in treatment to find them. You only have a small 12m TR at this point, but Tier 1 procs fast enough for that to be somewhat negligable (assuming you don't just find them). Rinse, repeat, get stealthier. Once you're TR is either 8m or smaller/ everybody has been Tier 1'd, get them to Tier 2 if you haven't already, giving you tracking via the Restraint add-on. Eventually, you'll have a very fun TR of 0m outside of chase while in punish mode. Should the obsession die, you could attempt to purposely eat a DS to start getting stacks agains.
---
You're last perk is your stalling perk of choice, be it Ruin, or Pop (or if you're feeling REALLY spicy, Devour Hope works well with MYC). You can also use a yellow Calm instead for a 4m TR, but there's more spectacle to 0m TR than 4m, wouldn't you agree? Also, build like this is why Doc is my favorite killer, such an open power for weird builds,
---
Good players will play around Ruin regardless of its rarity. Bad players will panic regardless and waste time hunting the totem. The only advantage of tier 3 ruin is that it‚Äôll slow down the good players an extra % or two. At any level, it‚Äôs still highly effective depending on your rank.
---
Spoken like a true camper, everyone knows if you exist on the same map as a hooked survivor you're camping
---
"you stupid survivor"
---
/r/okbuddydaylight
---
Thats a survivor challenge? Wow what a fucking waste of time
---
If I can do no better than break even on pips, fine. Just gimmy my Bloodpoints or rituals/tome. 
---
A good game is a good game. 
---
Being taken out by Rancor at the end of the game, within the exit, sucked especially when I managed to juke her twice moments earlier and avoided the hook all game... However the other 3 used Spirit's long kill animation to get out of the exit that I had opened so... Sucks but gg, the team lived. 
---
But sweaty try-hards, tunnelers, campers, and just general toxic players who are rewarded by using perks like NOED or whatever due to exploits and/or crutches, that's where the fun is killed and replaced with frustration. Undeserved. 
---
Survivors too... Been in plenty of games with randoms who are in lockers all game, not contributing, not going for hook even when there's clearly no killer around... Most of the time hatch camping... Like, cool... Good job not playing the game.
---
Uhhh, ok. I‚Äôd much rather have easy 3k BP spots over useless iridescent items.
---
You're not wrong. The most BS parts of facing a spirit still apply. Including the "mindgame" that isn't a mindgame at all and ends in spirit favor 90% of the time. Still, small steps in the right direction for sure.
---
Good meme. However, who actually cares about rank in DBD? I play it casually and not at all competitively. Rank means nothing to me, I'm here to have fun.
---
I honestly think they should bring back the whole "hatch only appears for the last survivor if 2 gens are done" because that way the survivor has actually earned and deserved that option. I mean like someone could play like a complete potato and still get the hatch
---
I've yet to see a survivor successfully counter my ability to hear their breathing and footsteps.
---
Has it not been working? I've been hsing it perfectly fine for the past couple weeks.
---
He was just using the funny moments vids to male himself look good not showing when he gets outplayed. When I watched streams or whole vids he never gave credit where it was due. Always blaming the game or devs instead of admitting when a killer got the better of him. Begging for attention before cryng about getting camped. I watch a killer main who face camps if ruin is broke before he gets some hooks or complains how people didn't "earn" the gen that pops during chase. If they break ruin or did the gen they earned it my guy. Same thjng blaming the devs for his bad games.
---
Wheres the teabagging part? BM'ing yeah I see that.
---
How would having a longer animation make survivors happier? Although I do think tea bagging by hatch is cocky and scummy. Hatch escapes are by pure luck and nothing to gloat about. I‚Äôd only bm if the killer was toxic. Can‚Äôt survivors still be grabbed before fully escaping thru hatch if the killer is quick enough? I haven‚Äôt seen that happen in a long time. Whenever I feel like it could happen the killer swings instead
---
I don‚Äôt really see how this is relevant, but alrighty
---
That's what I was thinking but with doctor having those random spots on the screen skill checks I can see it working rather well
---
A civil discussion? You're on the wrong sub for this.
---
Hatch should be taken out of the game tbh. Look up the video from truetalent discussing the hatch. It's one of the few times I agree with him.
---
Gg piece of sht
---
I mean are you surprised people make video game porn?
---
That's what I was thinking would be cool to see it happen to see how good it would be. Imagine ruin, unnerving presence and this kind of a perk together on Doc I think it would be a nasty combo.
---
I use dark sense in solo cue, especially around reset time. To often do I see teammates wandering around doing nothing. I‚Äôd rather get an idea of where the killer is and if he‚Äôs in a chase or not while I complete gens.
---
I used it a lot to get better at chases. I mean go face camo if you want, I don't know why this perk would make you mad.
---
Maybe... 
---
Wouldn't it be better as a Doctor addon then? It could be a waste of a perk slot on any other killer.
---
"Technically the worst perk in the game"
---
nope pretty sure I'd rather run WGLF and get 0 stacks and get absolutely nothing from that perk slot than *ever* run No Mither
---
Why? Because you isnta downed a fully healed survivor with a crutch perk?
---
I agree with this, I feel like the update isnt doing much to change her main power (besides collision) which is why I find it difficult/ luck based playing against her without the right perks
---
What the actual cinnamon toast fuckery was that horsey donkeydoodle lamb sauce ghost shit.
---
Don‚Äôt give him ideas!
---
Yeah this looks way better not a lot of empty space like the normal camera angle it also lets you see the charms better
---
But then you either 
---
&gt; crouch away from all the traps after unhook, giving plenty of time for her to get back to the people waddling away. 
---
&gt; run away from all the traps after unhook, letting her teleport once she gets close enough.
---
Yes you're right u had to do it from my chrome browser also
---
&lt;3
---
I wouldn't say Tunneling is toxic so long as you're being logical about it. I put it as a bunch of IF phrases.
---
- IF I'm far away from the hook: don't return to hook.
---
- IF I'm close enough to the hook: return to where the 2 guaranteed survivors are.
---
- IF I see the unhooked/unhooker, then:
---
    - IF running Dying Light and Unhooker is Obsession: Chase Unhooked. (I will focus on building/keeping my Dying Light stacks)
---
    - IF Unhooker is not Obsession:
---
        - IF Unhooker healthy: Chase Unhooked (1 hit to down versus 2 hits to down)
---
        - IF Unhooker wounded: (1 hit to down versus 1 hit to down)
---
            - If Unhooker &lt; #Times Hooked as Unhooked: Chase Unhooked (Unhooked is closer to dead.)
---
            - If Unhooked &gt;= #Times Hooked as Unhooked: Chase Unhooker (Unhooker equal or closer to dead).
---
- AND IF: Unhooker has known Borrowed Time: Adjust "IF Healthy/Wounded" to Always Unhooker Wounded (2 hits to down equal - Compare #Times Hooked)
---
    AND: IF Chase Unhooked: Allow 15 seconds for BT to pass.
---
There's an extra line for Decisive Strike, but that's never known until it's used, and then it's no longer important. So I tend not to consider it. Of course, everyone could see an obsession and think "Decisive Strike may be in play" but I run Dying Light, so I always have an Obsession. Even still, DS only changes Healthy/Wounded to 2 hits to down versus 2 hits to down.
---
On that note, Borrowed Time also only changes the Healthy/Wounded consideration to "2 hits to down." Basically, it equalizes the Hits to Down variable. If the Unhooked is still the most viable target, letting 15 seconds pass negates the perk.
---
Basically, I've got a quick logic tree when I see someone being unhooked. All things being equal, I'll chase the Unhooker, but if there's an optimal path towards my objective (Kill all survivors) then I'm going to aim towards that. Sometimes that means tunneling and, while it sucks, if that's the optimal strategy towards my objective I can't really be blamed for playing the game and doing what I'm expected to do as a Killer.
---
I honestly might be the only one, but on Xbox it‚Äôs extremely dark in some maps. To the point that I have to squint to see even a couple feet in front of me. Any map that has a building is terrible. I don‚Äôt have bad skill checks I just can‚Äôt see the killer until their in my face half the time.
---
but its funny
---
People act like youre supposed to get away from her every chase. There's 4 other people to kill, if everyone got away, wouldn't be fair, would it?
---
Put it on whenever there's a Ttv person in your lobby and get some popcorn.
---
Pretty much the only thing I consider toxic is after-match chat interactions. 
---
I do consider a lot of other things to be bad unsportsmanlike though.
---
This is why I keep my messages off and don‚Äôt even bother with this nonsense. I don‚Äôt care if the people I play against have the best or worst game of their entire life. I‚Äôll just play the game my way, fair.  No matter what you do people will just act up and spew venom.
---
Is that your cosplay because that pretty d*mn good
---
Maybe if it was a part of the Doctor's effect on skill check, where they randomly go from different directions.
---
&lt;3 dam sounds rough, 100% you play better than them
---
I... Hmm
---
&gt;Oofernet
---
First of all, not funny. Second of all, not possible. Skillchecks are client side and the white mark skipping has nothing to do with your connection in the match.
---
JUST MONIKA
---
idk but i have the same problem it takes up to an hour i‚Äôve just given up on playing killer
---
I'm happy someone else realised. I thought I was going insane. The icons for the big buttons on the main menu are really low quality now if you haven't noticed that too. I think they just keep fucking up textures.
---
Game slippery
---
The art style looked so familiar....then i figured out you were the guy who drew siegetober...!
---
Oof
---
Or maybe just pay more attention to your surroundings?
---
Bruh, if hatch is closed and it is you in a 1v1 against the killer, you are pretty much dead.
---
That's not even factoring in if the killer has whispers, high mobility or is able to trap the exit gates.

---
Ig your way of phrasing it is much better but like I rarely find non toxic survivors. Love that all the butthurt survivors down voted my statement lmao, they don‚Äôt help themselves.
---
Idk. I just don‚Äôt think keys are that OP unless used by streamer worthy player or SWF. In my experience the most likely of ways to get hatch is by finding it when you‚Äôre the last person and at that point the survivor is pretty screwed without hatch. In legitimate solo matches I rarely see more than one person escape using a key. Idk if it‚Äôs just because my luck is shit and my teammates are usually potatoes or the hatch will spawn next to the killer for me. Fr tho, most of the times when enough gens are completed for more than one person to escape using a key, nothing ever goes right (again I‚Äôm talking about actual solo matches where survivors can‚Äôt tell the others where the hatch is). Idk, maybe I‚Äôm wrong. I honestly just have really bad luck, so keys tend to not really work out well for me or my teams.
---
The problem is that her power has next to no counter play, you usually dont even have a chance to get away from her in the first place
---
K
---
Well if they ever rework some of his add-ons is definitely love seeing that as part of a add-on.
---
Since Distressing is %-based and M&amp;A is flat, doesn't that mean that your radius grows by more overall when in a chase?
---
Would be a good decent Doctor buff.

I mean every about 80% of steve players I run into as killer Tea bag me too. I guess I just attract Toxic Survivors.
---
Now I wanna to Boop the snoot
---
So basically Myers but more long term and no stalking?
---
One game I had everyone injured and one was hooked, they all tried to go for him and I got them all, let them bleed, and then after the game they invited me to a party saying ‚Äúcamper, camper, camper‚Äù
---
Rank means alot playing solo survivor rank 20s are usually terrible and even if your really good makes shit really difficult if no one on your team knows what they should be doing
---
Damn oof get oof shit oof on oof kidDo oof

i will test this

He's a toxic attention whore that was banned multiple times for for valid reasons. Nothing else to say on that parasite

Are you actually being facetious on purpose or are you trying to be satirical? Either way, you both just look like fools, hypersensitive ones at that.

It seems bugged for some people when trying as a survivor, but as a killer it seems to work fine
---
Ah you must have TTV in your name.
---
sabo-care
---
you, a survivor, can repair broken hooks, for some reason. you lose 200/500/all of your bloodpoints.

"there we go. wait, what are you doing? stop, no don't do that you god damn idiot!" - Jake Mains
---
I am too lazy to check pfps for that.
---
Yes but survivors are mostly the problem so that‚Äôs that.
---
Well his power doesn't necessarily need to be getting to one-shot Survivors after filling up a bar.
---
Still kinda disappointed the mori animation is less gore than it supposed to be
---
Why do I relate to this
---
Yeah who ever patched this one together is definitely going to the ranch.
---
As a survivor main that's not an asshole this man should be crucified
---
Thank you, you are a good man.
---
Always try to save unless doors are open and the timers damn near finished and killer is running noed.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Maybe pre nerf.
---
I wish we could get that. Problem is licensing, they‚Äôd have to contact the holder of Scary Movie‚Äôs license, get their okay, and probably ask the people that own ghostface if they‚Äôd be cool with it for good measure. The answer to the second is probably yes because they let the movie happen but times change.
---
surely the best spine chill text would be "oh lawd he comin"
---
that said though i love this
---
I was thinking more of the process of tiering up throughout the game
---
Survivors are not mostly the problem you‚Äôre so delusional. Both sides take equal blame. Yeah, it sucks playing killer and getting demolished because of meta perks. But the same case can and will apply to survivors getting demolished because of killer meta perks lol. It‚Äôs just how things are.
---
No credit for the creator? Nice
---
So I started playing today for the first time on over a year, can someone explain what a mori is?
---
The changes they did were good, although slightly worse than necessary, it was a far better nerf than expected, i honestly thought spirit might die, and with no collision, who knows, maybe she will, but all i really want is them to fix the cosmetics. When she phases in her default skin, her hair stands straight up, but her other cosmetics don't  tell you anything. It really helps at loops if you know if she's phasing or not, because you don't hear the sound when you stand that close. If they have it for default, they should have it for all skins.
---
Dead hard + slippery meat = hard meat
---
It's not being toxic it's just having fun with your streamers and &lt;500 viewers. There is not a game multiplayer game on the planet where people dont try to mess with streamers.
---
Now I never said spam your link in post game. You say GG, then Ctrl+V and hit Enter, br nice and then you get more viewers.
---
holy shit üëèüëèüëè
---
Damn. Thanks for the quick response.
---
In the lobby I check anyways cause most have their twitch in their profile desc and mori or watch for more info
---
May the cosmos forgive you for what you've done
---
You dont face camp with a mori, cause then you cant use it.
---
in my opinion, they should do the same thing valve did with cooldown in csgo. 30 min, 2 hours, 24 hours or 1 week of cooldown depending how much you've disconnected.
---
I just remember who some are. I know one streamer who will DC along with her friends because I don't play fair such as 'camping' but they unhook in front of my face and you don't want to take punishment for bold plays hoping the killer is stupid to play right into it. I notice they tend to DC to any killer has a power that is good for chases or can make certain tiles dangerous and I utilize them properly (Nurse, Spirit, Huntress, Hillbilly, Demogorgon for example).
---
I only play on stream
---
Your mom
---
Don‚Äôt do mental gymnastics because you‚Äôre upset over a reddit comment. You‚Äôre not that stupid, I think. 
---
I just prefer to not lose to something with no counter play lol.
---
thats actually not even remotely true. The first 20-25ish levels progress relatively quickly, HOWEVER they offer you practically no shards. It actually speeds up at later levels.
---
Due to the French language classifying nouns as gendered, the word "entity" is female.  Since the developers are in Quebec, I assume that the Entity is therefore treated as female.
---
Fun fact: survivors can use pallets to stun The Killer.
---
^oh ^okay
---
Oh, thanks for that.
---
Yeah, not anymore.
---
Really? You know he has a penalty when he throws them.
---
Thanks for the incredibly insightful comment.
---
I had this issue with the BP challenge. Playing a game as killer fixed it, so maybe try that?
---
Continuous DCs can be tracked internally and punished, especially when dedicated servers officially take off. But the limit of how much you can DC before they start to dole out discipline is something astronomical, like 30% of games or more. So yeah. DCing because you don‚Äôt want to farm is fine. 
---
Farming is mostly fine, as long as everyone is on board and you‚Äôre not the only one working with the killer to help kill your team or something. Even then, I dunno if it‚Äôs punishable per se, but I always figured that‚Äôs what they meant by the blurb in the report system.
---
"Haha I made the killer lose lead than 400 points and wasted his time hurr durr"
---
"Oh I didnt get nothing for it..."
---
Just a joke but campers from the start of a match!
---
You're a dumb basket.
---
About what? Aaahh... "The cat". Yeah, i love that perk. i wish that i can knew how is called...
---
The hatch has to be there to prevent killers from not ending the game, the same reason it allows killers to stop survivors doing the same thing.
---
what do you mean?
---
‚ÄúGood Job So Far‚Äù
---
Lol
---
P3 with most perks lmao, who cares about points? I can explain what P3 stands for and what items are, if you need the help understanding.
---
I‚Äôm not toxic when I‚Äôm killer or survivor, and I can and will continue to complain about toxic killers till the day it‚Äôs fixed knowing damn well the devs won‚Äôt fix a damn thing but that‚Äôs the world we live in.
---
An active RBT always blows at the gates. You can only escape with an RBT if it's inactive.

I can‚Äôt tell if this is serious or not, so I‚Äôm gonna assume it is. Yamaoka estate is the Spirit‚Äôs map

I wish BhVR would get some real help from a more qualified group of coders to help them get their servers fixed and up &amp; running for everyone...

---
he ain‚Äôt quite there, but he got the *spirit*
---
It's not though. If you've got a choice between 2 injured survivors and you go after the one who got unhooked, you're a dick.
---
Dude was even hardware banned and he went and bought another PC, I would be going after his ISP after that.
---
Poor Rin
---
"Mori" is a shortened term for "Memento Mori", an uncommon/rare/ultra rare offering that a Killer can bring into the game. They allow you to *kill* Survivors after you down them, rather than just hooking them. The rare/ultra rare (Ivory and Ebony, respectively) require you to hook the survivor(s) before killing them, while the uncommon (Cypress) does not.
---
Cypress allows you to kill the *last* remaining survivor, Ivory allows you to kill *one* survivor, and Ebony allows you to kill *all* survivors.
---
I guess so. But it just gets annoying when I've stomped the survivors but I get denied the 4k due to RNG
---
the fucking nea like "bro are you okay?"
---
It's worse when you dont know the Killer had Agitation or Iron Grasp and you tank a hit only for them to run halfway across the map with the survivor anyway.
---
ive exclusively had bad experiences posting my videos here but oh well here it is anyway
---
For me, I notice a distinct difference in the quality of my teammates playing at red rank than otherwise, at least as a solo player. Less salt, less DCs, more gg's in general has been my experience. Even if I do end up going against the same killer over and over.
---
if you miss, it makes you mori-able
---
Can we all keep in mind, dedicated servers still suck dick and authentically lead to most of the DCs I feel I see as of recent?
---
Like I was having an issue where NOTHING was DCing for me, but the game. It was 1 second I'm playing, everything is fine no issues, then all of a sudden I'm in the post game lobby and it says the killer DCed but 1 or 2 times I had a streamer on the same team and they're going ahead as normal. Not even normal DCs either tho where I see people run into walls and such, no, literally just an instant I am now out of the match. Should I really be punished because out of 5 games, the game decided to DC me 3 or 4 times?
---
For me it's even an issue of I wouldn't punish people for clicking leave match which could be tracked. Right now so much bullshit happens regularly and while it sucks because it inconveniences others, I don't blame people for who DC when they're hit by something that clearly misses, when they vault a window but get teleported back to the side they vaulted from and get downed, etc. It's not fun, it's not fair, it's nobodies fault, etc. If the game is fixed up and much more consistent then by all means add punishments for DCing especially if a consistent issue with a player but until then shit needs to get fixed before punishments are handed out.
---
You can't be the last one to leave/escape a trial. Otherwise it won't count your gained bloodpoints towards your overall total.
---
huh otzdarva commented on one of my posts
---
What difference does it make? A survivor team can crush a killer for the whole game but then get mori'd at the end as well. I just don't get why Killers are so thirsty for that fourth kill. Anytime a survivor gets the hatch on me it's like "fair play, lucky bastard" and that's that. 
---
The killer has the advantage in the hatch hunt, they're faster and they can also just find and kill the survivor. Ultimately it just seems so salty to be that upset about missing a 4k
---
...
---
And thus, my hope is extinguished and I feel like a clown. Ah well, time to try and find some other meme nonsense
---
I seriously have NO idea how I missed that, it was the first thing I checked given the name of the perk, I must be going blind
---
True but they shouldn‚Äôt be unhooking you anyways with the killer right there up their ass, now if they have borrowed time equipped then it should cancel out you being able to hit the cancel unhook button. 
---
Problem solved but this is BhVR Interactive we are talking about and them even remotely adding something like that would probably break the game or just sling your hooked corpse flying over the map because of the spaghetti coding with this game.

Oh that is a great idea borrowed time overrides cancel. Actually brilliant idea. The coding thing I thing is a non issue if everything breaks it but eventually gets "fixed" nothing is off the table.

---
When I'm playing survivor and we finish all gens yet my teammates still insist on waiting at the gates to teabag. I would like to know how much time they waste collectively waiting around just to show the killer your ass bouncing up and down.
---
As much as I like bouncing up and down with teammates, I've been on the other side of it and it sucks. Would love a perk that makes it so survivors can't teabag 3 times within a certain amount of time in the killers radius. Maybe it could be called broken ankles, or snapped ligament? Just a silly suggestion lol
---
What was the nerf? I'm uninformed ‚òπÔ∏è
---
WAZZZAAAP

Genrushing is a dumb word nowaday. It only applies to the old BNP. Then it gets so popular the moment u finish 1 gen ur called genrusher

Well buddy...

Sounds about right

Thank you kind sir!

No problem

This is so fucking cute. Good job homie.

So entitled.
---
being rude in post game chat for no reason is also toxic. i do think it's okay to call someone out on being an asshole and doing the things i listed though.
---
This is almost as bad as the time I ran to the exit gate but forgot that I had BT, so it ran out and I went down a few feet from the gate. The killer got me and killed me.
---
Can't get any worse than he is now

If that were real that would Kinda be trippy imagine being chased by someone who looks like a murderous version of yourself in a video game it‚Äôs kind of lazy

Its sad survivors can do the mental gymnastics to justify crying about any little thing the killer does, you aren't gonna escape every game just like the killer isn't gonna 4k every game. Get over it and just play, it's a game so have fun!

Cool

---
Nah he was just salty, freddy has a bit of a broken hitbox but otherwise hes fairly easy to play against
---
Right i totally agree so why are you justifying playing like an asshole because you got genrushed lol genrushing can literally happen by accident if the killer isnt good enough to stop it, facecamping/tunneling, not so much.
---
I don‚Äôt get why people complain about survivors doing generators. I put up with it because I know the devs will ban them eventually. Scumbag gen rushers
---
I am a killer main, and I agree.
---
So adorable
---
Very likely the survivor had heard about Forever Freddy and had picked up the complaint. Freddy is stronger than he was and is stronger than some, but he's not broken.
---
We're still, I think, in the period where folks are getting used to him. Every new killer does pretty well, and Freddy is essentially new.
---
I think I'll switch to a killer main and facecamp just for you. And anytime someone sends me hate mail for it, I'll direct them here to you as the reason I do it. Cheers. :)

Literally 0 way of actually confirming this, and aside from that, dont think anyone is going to comb through all of your content. But the fact is, getting banned in this game is... not easy, you practically have to try in order to face actual consequences.
---
And "remember me"
---
No it has been, he means actually successfully pulling it off and it making a difference in the game
---
My bad dude i just getting messages and whatnot saying im an idiot or wrong when calling out killers, i'm so use to everyone disagreeing with me. Cheers!
---
I have asked streamers and they told me spam reports can get you banned. I face camped teabaggers earlier. It's good. They're looking into it.
---
Never wiggle as the last survivor, the unwritten rule
---
Doing gens is not the same thing as gen rushing. Gen rushing is when you ignore literally everything else to do gens. Totems, healing, sometimes even hook rescues. Yes it's the survivor's job but it's as much fun to go up against as tunneling is to a survivor. There's nothing technically wrong with it because everyone's just playing the game but it's a miserable tactic to go up against.
---
This is a really common way to reduce lag in many games. I've seen several speedrunners talk about how they manipulate the camera to have less things on-screen for the game to render, which reduces lag and therefore lets them go faster.
---
SM64 is a good example
---
If you don't look forward to playing this game, don't play it. Games are supposed to be fun. When this game is frustrating me, I take a break.
---
No I 100% agree with you. It‚Äôs hilarious what some people try to convince themselves is good gaming
---
Because fire up doesn't give effortless insta-downs for failing? Fire Up doesn't take skill to use, it just gives you more of a foundation to bounce back up off for when you get to the end game meaning if you're bad at killer you'll still be bad even with fire up, while with NOED you're guaranteed at least 1 kill no matter how terrible you are
---
Found the spirit main
---
Dude it's literally a flip of the meme, not the dude trying to justify facecamping.
---
Doesn't that perk already exist
---
BBQ also has a very useful side effect
---
I don‚Äôt really think the box is broken, it just looks like it because of his sausage fingers
---
So the solution would be to undock and give the console even *less* power to run the game with?
---
Sure

And hes doing it to mock the entire idea of the original point... yes i too have reading comprehension.

This word gets thrown around wayyyy too much in this sub. This persons post basically boils down to "not really feeling the upcoming chapter". Its not like they were throwing a temper tantrum and demanding a refund. 
---
Having a negative opinion about something doesn't equal entitled.
---
If your referring to the two games I go into detail about they were a blast. Other than that the games the night before were a foolish failure to realize that the 13th is reset day and that I cannot pull a training montage in 3 minutes to beat people with triple digit hours when I'm barely at double digits.
---
Yeah uh.... the question needs to be asked, what streamers? Because all of the streamers ive seen claiming this can happen, have literally been caught saying absolutely vile shit, that they are pretending never happened.
---
mm, I play hag and when I face her as survivor I always get annoyed when they do this. I'm even worse tho I guess, i claim one side of the map as mine and use agitation to bring them deep into my territory (just how I play her ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø)
---
Like where the pic is from? Just search what is written. If the scenario the first match I had today.
---
The streamers I've talked to arent banned. Ie.) Fuhnural
---
I meant Julie. I am a fool. Downvote that comment now to make an example of me.
---
Easier to see survivors
---
Im gonna put all 10 and im gonna blow your eardrums out with that one add on, if im gonna suffer and play the hag then your gonna suffer for being faster then the frog lady.
---
If you unhook a survivor when i'm right there i will slap you down and throw you on the hook while letting the unhooked guy go. Because fuck you, You can see i'm right there, don't unhook.
---
~~unless the hooked guy was an asshole in which case they deserved it~~
---
It's the survivor getting BP. I don't think GF gets bp for being revealed.
---
 It's like 2 a month I find someone like that. And besides, it helps my team get gennys done which is my main concern.
---
where's this vid form it seems funny
---
Gotta keep edging us.
---
I'm confused. Was he standing on the hatch too? If not, why didn't you just close it right away? Also please don't generalize survivor mains. I play both sides equally, but the toxicity that goes on between killer mains and survivor mains is ridiculous. You shouldn't add fuel to the fire.
---
It made the sound of it hitting the tractor. Should've just M1d for safety.

Deja vu, I literally just answered this question
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dxgsyn/what_do_you_actually_think_is_toxic/
---
One of those is top tier change my mind
---
One is a clear attempt to make someone feel bad/angry for self enjoyment while the other one is just a dickmove
---
No it didn‚Äôt
---
Just do Gens like you normally would. Maybe equip Prove Thyself/Better Together and bring a good toolbox. It really shouldn‚Äôt be that hard, it only took me like 2 games.
---
I beat him to the hatch but we were both there before it opened. 
---
And yea when I do play survivor I sometimes get some really shitty toxic killers, but most of the time whenever I see toxicity in this game its from SWF groups.
---
Moris arent toxic its just killing more effectively
---
Plot Twist: The new survivor is Rin's Mom.
---
My bad but I downvoted because it was incorrect I wasn‚Äôt trying to be rude

You probably heard the "pwaaaauh" sound while reading this
---
is dcing still a problem in this game? I stopped months ago and started playin league. I heard they were gonna fix it last time I played.
---
Buy ghostface or freddy
---
yes and its bad
---
wtf i dont even remember saying this
---
One time I had a survivor in end game chat who died to NOED complain about the killer using it, and then when I tried defending the killer he accused me of ‚Äúnot doing anything and just ‚Äúlooking for totems the whole time.‚Äù I looped the killer for four gens and did one totem. He just happened to only see me doing the totem.
---
That is so cute!
---
They didn't do what people asked for lol.
---
P3 nurse with noed face camped after 4 bps what a great person
---
Well could please answer the question
---
Both yes and no. Tunnelling isn't toxic if it's the easiest choice atm. If you go out of your way to find the same survivor again instead of getting on with the game it becomes toxic.
---
There isn't a lot of ways to do gennies. 
---
The only objective is to fix gens and open the gates. You *can* do totems, but it's not always necessary.
---
If you think more objectives are needed for survivors, tell BHVR you'd like the old Halloween events back and such. There used to be more obj in-game.
---
The difference is you get points for doing gens, you lose points for face camping. At the end of the day the most important thing is how many points you get, and how much fun you had. not if you escape or 4K.
---
I completely forgot this was a thing so I'm happy to experience it all over again
---
Bring them on
---
‚Äúyou dumb b..‚Äù
---
Add this too, and also don‚Äôt bitch about nerfs until you learn how to play against them. (:
---
Oh yeah let me do this gen right in front of the killers face because unless he hits me or grabs me I'll get this done anyway. There's people who threw the whole game to complete a gen and then what? They died
---
Okay thats actually terrifying
---
You can get chainsawed right down your entire body and survive, and that surprises you?
---
HoOK cAmPinG iSNt ToXIc BeCAUsE itS jUsT tHE kiLlEr dOiNg thEir oBjECtIVe
---
Here's some random input:
---
I used to main Pig but found her lackluster in chases since she doesn't have any support there. I haven't successfully used her ambush attack in mind games except in lower ranks. Maybe others have better experience? The ambush attack isn't too useful when ambushing someone in a gen also because the loud sound just makes them run. Imo, it's better to try to go for a grab. If the grab doesn't work, you can go for a normal attack.
---
She has Surveillance which I don't think is useful in higher ranks. I personally spend most of my time in chases, so I can't really spend time patrolling a gen that  just lit up.
---
It's fun sometimes when you get someone who tries to leave with an activated reverse bear trap. 
---
Demogorgon is decent, I think, because it can close a gap in chases with its lunge ability. 
---
I haven't tried the other ones enough to give feedback on them.
---
Yeah, the perk that tells you someone is somewhere. Whispers is good at starting the game and ending it. In between it doesn't offer much and does nothing in swapping targets.
---
If Whispers is already triggered by the Survivor you just left, how will you know about it triggering on someone else when it never turns off? You cant. You'll never know anything but "someone is somewhere, they might or might not be alone" and it often leads to you needlessly over searching areas.
---
As said, Whispers has its uses. But it often gives too much or worthless information.
---
Gosh I don't even remember when that was
---
Think you were talking about how small game kinda sucks then someone in chat suggested combining it with slippery meat and someone made a joke about 'small meat'
---
Pretty sure it's in a clip on the youtube channel but I'm too lazy to dig it up
---
I aint no scientist. But my research would lead me to believe that the awnser is inconclusive
---
Killer wins that animation.  Tiebreaker goes to killer.  All he had to do was close the hatch in front of him.
---
That's what league of legends does. But if you really want to make it hurt, make it so they have to do little qte's every minute or so, so they can't just walk away.
---
It WAS
---
I‚Äôm getting a ‚ÄúErma‚Äù vibe here.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs called the objective, and often if people are doing gens while someone is hooked, I take it as a hint that there is definitely somebody going for the save at the time. The important thing is to take gen prioritization as an advantage so you can gain a better view of their plans
---
Killer main here too. Yeah it's not toxic, but is annoying.
---
They need to do the same with noed too, and we haven‚Äôt heard a word about it
---
Fat DS‚Äôs are the best DS‚Äôs
---
It looks WAY better and yet they changed it back last update.
---
I agree. I try pretty hard not to tunnel, but pretty often the guy that I just unhooked runs into me. People also like to unhook when I haven't even left the area.
---

You pay attention, if the survivor seems to be able tow waste at least 2-4 minutes at a time without being hit its time to move on and chase another
---
Low effort indeed
---
I think the concept they're trying to go for is the killer watching them from afar.
---
It‚Äôs not bannable. And neither is tunneling or facecamping in the effort of being toxic
---
Just dont cleanse lmao
---
Depending on the situation, it can be.
---
Well posting on Reddit ain't gonna get em done quicker.... Let's go slacker
---
I used to play Pig often, and it's so funny when someone with an activated reverse bear trap runs for the exit. 
---
Also, I don't see it mentioned here, but you can still escape with an activated RBT using a hatch.
---
To my knowledge it‚Äôs not Freddy that people have a problem with, its *FOREVER FREDDY* that some people including myself don‚Äôt like
---
Always a step ahead.
---
Is all you do is repost?
---
But you get more points for escaping in the first place. I get your point and appreciate it though
---
I agree, though something still needs to be changed so that Hex:Ruin isn't a core perk you have to bring to slow down the early game
---
You can activate it more than once now
---
Ghostface now has to quit his job as a killer from sexual assault allegations.
---
what
---
Hey man nice meme where‚Äôd you get it? Looks kinda familiar.
---
Thank you for your input
---
Does killer win the animation? I thought when you stepped off the hatch during the closing animation the survivor could jump in.
---
Yeah "lucky" LMAO.
---
*laughs in xbox*
---
Being able to switch to survivor and killer through the rift screen
---
Frenzy stabbing. Not basic attacks.
---
It should make you bleed less

I think it's because not every killer has Franklin's? I stopped dodging because of items as soon as I got it. I do feel bad for the medkits lately because it's probably for the challenge, but I just gotta wear Franklin's every time I see a flash light.
---
How rude can you get
---
Hey man I care for lore based Claudette but I don‚Äôt care about OwOmyers45 who was hiding in tall grass watching my ass go into second stage on hook
---
End game with 1 person is not mid game where there are 3 or 4 Survivors around the map all overlapping each other's Whispers AOE.
---
Yes but most of the killers I have found using it are either stalkers or chainsaws. At that point you‚Äôre just showing how much you rely on crutches to win
---
Everything is fine for me. Not a single sound problem
---
Dunno how you play killer but it's fine with me, i catch them no prob. Survs are my bitches and will always be. Whispers is not for everybody i suppose.
---
If it takes 5 minutes to get 1 hook you can‚Äôt complain about gen rushing (:
---
Imagine calling 360ing an exploit. Holy crap. It rarely ever works.
---
Sloppy Game
---
Camping isn't toxic, it's literally the killers job to sacrifice the survivors
---
Wait what, whats the 360 exploit? If you are going to say that doing a 360 is considered an exploit you are serioulsly stupid.
---
Are you on PC or Console?
---
Repost my dude :/
---
Happens all the time. I‚Äôll be editing my load out and then be pleasantly surprised I was able to make all of my changes before I started a new match (fun tip: if you want to join a lobby faster, start editing your load out or changing your clothes lmao. Game loves being a dick lmao) and then realize I hadn‚Äôt even clicked join a lobby. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
damn forever Freddy is just too OP rn üòî /s
---
the ritual is complete
---
To elaborate on this even more, there was originally another generation between gen X and millennial, gen Y. For whatever reason it seems to have been more or less split, with the older half being now labeled as gen X, and the younger half becoming millennial.
---
Tbh if I save someone, they better make sure they get their ass out, or else I'm gonna be salty that I died for nothing
---
On survivor and killer? Or just one one?
---
#Salty Prison Bitches!
---
A basic attack isn‚Äôt always tied to a 15-20 second mend timer that you can‚Äôt just ignore and go hop on a gen. Pre-nerf legions main problem was that there‚Äôs no counter play to having your mend timer forced to zero. Multi stabbing was a HUGE problem. There‚Äôs a reason there‚Äôs only ONE add-on to allow it, and said add-on is purple.
---
Yes it is depending on the situation.
---
Ghostface can easily ambush the saver did it once and it worked like a charm it helps that he's a hard counter to borrowed time.
---
It's also something you'll want to do during the endgame collapse when the gates are already open.
---
Poor piggy
---
It wasn't intended to begin with
---
They are mad that you are camping the hook, but then you put Make Your Choice, and they are mad that you are not camping the hook.
---
Oh my god, spinning is not an exploit christ. Spirit phasing you have zero counterplay or response bar guessing
---
Lol it isn't I love spirit, it's just the meme ya know
---
No, they were taking turns looping the Freddy one of them was going for the pallet stubs archive challenge as well
---
^I ^want ^the ^video
---
He really just ripped off your meme, didn‚Äôt he? F
---
your blood are belong to us
---
Everytime I tried it, they were never streaming. No a single fucking time.
---
I like quick and quite + iron will + calm spirit + urban evasion
---
It‚Äôs a great stealth build and if you can‚Äôt be found, you can get more done.
---
I like that more than her father tbh
---
Why is it I can hit a DS check with adrenaline pumping but cant hit great skill checks on gens...why am I cursed?
---
People wouldn't do it if it didn't work. Also aiming for a spinning target with a joy stick is BS, mouse I could see not caring as it would be much easier to land a hit. 
---
Spirit has been that way for over a year, only now people are complaining lol?
---
I had the same situation a lot the last days. But really, can you blame them? How should they know that you are  working on that one gen? They run in a direction, maybe spot you in the distance after a bit... so what now? Should they just stop running? Sometimes there is no time in a chase to change directions. Or if we look at it logically - how many people try to do (fuck emapthy, right?) - "better you, than them". I don't like that reasoning but it seems to fit this community. Why care about someone else?
---
This is one of the reasons why solo q is a nightmare sometimes and a SWF is necessary to avoid "stupid" situations. I play solo most of the time and it's better to assume that you are on your own and even the other survivors are out there to kill you.
---
Honestly I think the difficult challenges will be good for the game but I understand a lot of people probably won‚Äôt like it.
---
Sosig
---
That's not what anybody means. If I play Trapper without ruin. By the time I had my first two traps set two generators have been done. Gen Rush is referring to those games that are over in 3-5 minutes.
---
It also refers to Downing a Survivor quickly but losing pressure due to the survivors getting generators done ridiculously fast. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be but it's still part of why a lot of people don't play killer. A lot of people don't like having mandatory perks like ruin and having to be add on dependent if they want to play their favorite killer at a high rank.
---
Also by this logic. Survivors can't complain about tunneling if they just don't go down. Tunneling is the killer equivalent of gen Rush. IE it is the one side trying to win fast without letting the other side have fun.
---
Either way. If it's taking you 5 minutes to get it down. The chances are you're just not that good at killer. Or you're learning a new killer. Perhaps you're going against much higher-ranked survivors due to the broken or easily exploitable ranking system.
---
I saw someone else in this thread said it‚Äôs all about intent and I completely agree, especially when a lot of DBD content creators do things the community sees as toxic regularly.
---
So poor little Fresh-install Timmy does these things he saw youtubers do thinking he‚Äôs a part of a joke or just general game-behavior without realizing he‚Äôs facecamping, or body-blocking. Etc. 
---
Not everyone KNOWS their being toxic, some people just think it‚Äôs all part of the game, rather than bashing the rank 20 trapper for camping you, or tunneling you, just explain to them ‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs kinda a dick thing to do, try not to do that so much.‚Äù
---
Killer main, if they dont gen rush, im not having fun making them DC üòò
---
Console but I watch high tier PC players like Ussylis and AaronPlaysTV and they rarely pull it off.
---
How about we dont do imaginary rules for killers, as there are no imaginary rules for survivors? How about we just dont use keys and moris and instadowns. And maybe stay away from spirit and forever freddy? Everything else is fair game? Deal? Survivors get the fck off the trial, Killers kill the survivors?
---
It is a strategy, a very shitty, pathetic and below belt strategy unless the gates are open and you can do nothing else.   
---
however it says a lot about your team if it falls for it and give the killer easy points by hook trading and wasting time near hook hoping for some miracle to happen.
---
Of course it often works that doesnt mean you cant just wait and hit them. Just like you can dodge hatchets or chainsaws etc. they have counterplay.
---
Spirit frankly has been hated the last few months since people actually learned how to play her and use some of her broken addons. Everything you do to respond to spirit is guessing. Honestly even after the changes spirit will be annoying but not as annoying.
---
I was healing post unhook when Trapper saw my Kate's blonde hair. He immediately went into tunnel vision and after drawing him away from the gen where Jake and Claude was working, I stepped into a bear trap.
---
Trapper picked Kate and got slapped with DS. In the end Kate and Jake survived but Claudette got NoED'd and despite Kobe, Trapper managed to down her and this time decided not to pick her up immediately.
---
If he is a cute baby bubba, looking nervously around and toddling around me, it's super cute. &lt;3
---
If it's a grown up P3 Bubba, trying to hit me on the hook and revving his saw: not cute. :(
---
Take this scenario, Everyone bumrushes you and you‚Äôve been standing there for a while. What do you do? Not hit them?
---
Sh sh sh sh I know :( hopefully they give her a lil buff soon.
---
Dead Babysitter just sounds like it would be a Myers perk haha
---
Not really. Try playing Killer without ruin at rank 1. Especially when all four survivors have tool boxes and Med kits. Play trapper at rank one and before you have three traps set you will have two generators done. Although I'm guessing you've never been to Red rank killer so you're not qualified to talk about this subject
---
Yep that‚Äôs a stolen meme
---
I don't think its 'easy' to counter but I think it's a good way to slow down the game without literally forcing the game to slow down via stuff like Ruin. You're either going to suss out that I'm a killer who'd really want that NOED and spend time making sure it doesn't activate or looking for it instead of going straight for Exit Gates. For me, the value of people being scared of NOED outweighs NOED's actual effect.
---
I know. It's the camera angle from the pre-search survivor lobby, but they still changed it back last patch.
---
I love when killers think they‚Äôre good for downing me when 90% of the time their weapon is about 20 miles behind my body
---
I mean... I'm not the Noob3 wannabe who has never played red rank killer with TTV in my Reddit.

Which console are you using ? When I upgraded from Xbox one S to Xbox One X the 360s became a thing of the past. I don't know why but on the regular Xbox one and Xbox one S when a survivor spins near you it makes the frame rate funky which is why it's hard to hit people at times because you simply can't keep up with their movement.
---
Yeah, gen sounds are fucked, as are survivors breathing/whimpering/footsteps when in a chase. Don't notice a difference when I'm playing survivor, though, only killer.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Wonderful analogy, but I don‚Äôt find the people who use it to be any less than taunters or campers
---
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like for the killer. It makes no sense for both the killer and survivors perspective to be of the killers perspective at different distances.
---
You know you need to GTFO when the killer who's been chasing you doesn't even hit your teammates trying to bodyblock. Hell I even saw them let wounded teammates go to try to kill my ass.
---

Noed isn't broken or OP, people just don't like playing against it because then they have to change their playstyle to get around it. Killers only have so much control over the gens being done because of perks like ruin and pop, ruin is taken almost every game on everyone that has it and people are tired of seeing it, and pop only works if you can manage to find someone and hook them before the gen they were working on gets finished by the other 3 people that could do it. Plus killers can kick the gens to make them regress, but it's a 2 second animation that can be stopped by a single frame of the survivors repair animation and takes another 2 seconds to do again. It's not unbalanced if there's actually something you can do to stop it from working, like cleansing bones in the case of noed, but aside from trying to kill survivors as fast as possible a killer can't really do anything about survivors burning through gens since there are more methods of speeding up repair speeds for survivors than there are ways for killers to slow down those speeds. In my opinion I think that kicking a gen should regress it a certain percent amount like pop does (not nearly as much maybe something like 5%) so that way survivors can't just breathe on a gen to stop it from losing progress in the middle of a chase 
---
TL;DR noed isn't fundamentally broken its just annoying because people don't want to do bones and then get upset when they get smacked down with it, and gens get done too fast for most killers and that's why there is almost a requirement to have a perk in your build to slow down gens otherwise the game lasts like 4 minutes but its hard to balance that since there are killers like spirit billy and nurse that have so much pressure that gens dont seem to be done fast enough
---
Its a bug that occurs whens you leave the exit gates while using a flashlight. It will use up the entire flashlight regardless of its tier or addons.
---
Yah, survivors can be dicks to each other. Unhooking someone right in front of killer without Borrowed Time is a dick move.
---
It was The LeafBlower. It brought a mori too.

GIVE CREDIT YOU STINKY HEAD

As the killer, I only camp when a survivor tea bags or flashlight clicks. 
---
As a survivor, I only tea bag if I'm trying to get another survivor's attention.

---
Camping is a sure shot way to lose not win, unless the rest of the team are as stupid as the killer. And well when it comes to taunters.. you cant help it. There are toxic killers, there are toxic survs, and there are toxic players who play both sides just for the salt. 
---
They like to get reactions from the safety of a distant screen they hide behind. Don't give it to them. Yes you won't pip up but let rest of the team escape by spending full 2 minutes you get on your hook. And then don't react in post game chat. Let their misery consume them.
---
He‚Äôs like the survivor version of tru3ta1ent. thinks he‚Äôs the shit and if he loses then he will find a way to blame literally anybody or anything else. breeds toxicity within our community
---
Xbox One S so maybe thats it. Also framework sucks with Demogorgon at times too
---
When ruin it's OK but if not come on you can't pay that little attention?
---
Just be stealthy lol. It may not be as fun, but it‚Äôs fairly easy to find a stealth build and use it to keep hidden enough to do 3 gens. I do 3 gens all the time and still have time to get saves and engage in chases.
---
I sing this everytime the killers offering doesn't move
---
Yeah, I do dumb shit because of these too.
---
Billy or Legion
---
the game is fine she just had a bad burrito for lunch
---
Its all rank based, survivors get fast queues up til red ranks and killers get fast queuss only in red ranks. Its just the amount of players. Way too many killers at low ranks and few killers at red ranks
---
This happens for me a lot when I solo que, maybe everytime but I stopped paying attention, never happens with sfw so maybe it is related to that
---
It‚Äôs a joke lol
---
Add staying away from Billy and I agree.
---
He‚Äôs definitely joking
---
How do you say  WHAZAAAAAAAAAAP  without voice chat since the game does not have voice chat? I know you are being sarcastic but still

There's actually a folclore in my home town that tells the story of a hairy leg (yes a HAIRY leg) that jumps around parts of the city and sometimes It decides to kick people to death

---
This gets me hyped for some reason.
---
Watch some high ranked stream and look what they do. Essentially you need to know when to drop a chase. It sucks,but sometimes it is not worth it to chase a survivor who can loop you for 2 minutes straight. Either you catch them early or see that the chase needs to be dropped.
---
Don't respect pallets, make them get dropped early and then you can try to mindgame people around them. It's not always best to break them right away. 
---
Spirit Fury+Enduring combo might also help you out if you are struggling with Pallets.
---
yeah killers act like they‚Äôre hot shit while they‚Äôre playing on McDonald‚Äôs WiFi and hitting me from across the map...like no dude you aren‚Äôt actually good
---
Im meant to be returning to dbd today. Im scared to now
---
imagine your face and reaction, but for survivors when a hatchet hits them around a tree or my favorite around a wall and the blood splatter is nowhere near you. :)
---
Lol! What a tater!
---
I don‚Äôt which is why I had the part about where I switch targets but nothings changed apart from the survivor being chased..
---
Ah yes the ultimate counter to a map design. Waste a perk slot on something I will never use on anything but an infinite. Why should you have to use a perk to counter poor map design
---
This was only a small clip. I thought at first he was letting me escape, but every time I got close he would pick me up and put me back where I started
---
It reminds me of the cover for the wall by pink floyd
---
then you should start looking
---
Seek proffesional help
---
that's part of why im upset.  I have nobody.  I want to die because no one likes me.  All my friends always leave and i cant take it anymore.  I've changed so many times and idk who to be anymore because no one ever likes me.  I just want to die tonight was the last straw
---
Nope I use the Halloween cosmetic for Jake and the game runs smoothly I forgot to say that my game feels choppy only while playing killer.
---
As long as you're having fun and not purposefully trying to ruin the other players' experience then do whatever you want
---
They need to make it so when you open the daily rituals and get a new one (through generation or deletion of an old challenge) you should get to choose between survivor and killer random challenges
---
And?

---
Displaying the name of those whe disconnected while covering others is the opposite of what the rules say.

Shoulda walked as far away from the gate as possible, then dropped them.
---
Let them hope as they try to crawl away as fast as possible.
---
Shame on you, didn‚Äôt you know doing anything other than dying to the killer is toxic you stupid survivor main &gt;:( /s
---
Trying to name and shame and being sexist in the same post? 200iq dude.
---
Are you sarcastic or something?The Spirit was rank 17 at best lol.You just ran in a staright line.
---
Just giving more info on what happened considering I picked up my phone after 2 minutes of the EGC timer
---
thanks
---
And then you miss and you're dead on hook
---
They made walls block sounds but it‚Äôs very fucky sometimes
---
Probably not since it‚Äôs a bug, it‚Äôs more the game‚Äôs fault than your fault. See if you can submit a bug ticket to BHVR about it
---
no matter what I do anymore I feel this way.  I feel so alone and I don't have any friends
---
I'm here because I have no one to reach out to :(
---
The same goes for Spirit and Ghostface. Why should i use perks to counter this killers? Ghostface detection hitbox is awful and Spirit has no real counter, is just lucky guessing constantly and hope to trick her.
---
Disable chat. Go see a professional.
---
Jesus I laughed my ass off hahhahah
---
Wait I thought you were someone else sorry
---
ive tried pills and counselling for years it doesnt help
---
Do you want the few wiggle points or 7.5k points for going through the Hatch?
---
Use my trick: whenever you want a match to start faster, start editing your load out. The game, being an asshole, will try to start the match immediately to fuck you over :)
---
ive tried pills and counselling for years and it doesnt help
---
even more if you're extra petty like me and run camaraderie! 
---
for some reason, it procs automatically when you're the last survivor alive (you have to become the last alive survivor while already struggling or else you'll just insta die on the hook like normal)
---
I literally had a killer once down me and message me "tell me where the last person is and I'll let you live" :/ unfortunately I guess some people actually take that opportunity to rat out their teammates, I've also had teammates rat me out as well it is so annoying
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre stable enough to play this game then. It‚Äôs time to put it down.
---
Killers have the option to open exit gates once all gens are powered. This is meant to start the endgame collapse and prevent survivors from holding the game hostage.
---
Go on an LFG for this game it helps to make friends that way
---
ah yes, the jojo camera angle, as my friend calls it
---
Killer can open the gate to start the End Game Collapse timer. This prevents survivors from hiding or holding the game hostage after all gens are powered
---
Killers can open one door, as long as:
---
1. All gens are done.
---
2. The endgame collapse hasn‚Äôt startwd yet.
---
And yes, the animation is a basic attack on the door switch, it‚Äôs confusing at first.
---
I suggest watching twitch stream and becoming a part of a community. Just choose a small or medium streamer. Those will most likely talk with you (big ones have their chat moving too quickly)
---
That‚Äôs what helped me
---
Ok Zoomer ;)
---
what's an LFG?
---
Please make more of these with ghostface it's adorable and hilarious.
---
1. Yes it can be countered. With lucky rng.        
---
2. It rewards buffed gameplay for the wrong reasons. You shouldn‚Äôt be relying solely on the end game to kill the survivors.        
---
3. You realise how frustrating it is to have a solid game be ready to exit and get one hit, all beachside you missed one full totem.         
---
        
---
Idm if people want to use it, it‚Äôs not toxic like people say. But you‚Äôre not helping yourself due to the low skill ceiling and you‚Äôll piss off a lot of survivors. Be careful when using it mate. Might get a lot of angry messages lol
---
Hot fuzz though. Face it, for the greater good.
---
like that would solve my problems
---
wonder when this was added cuz this wasn‚Äôt a thing back then
---
It‚Äôs not to solve your problem. It‚Äôs to prevent one
---
ok thank you, I might try that
---
Streetwise + a medkit every match would be my way to go. Self-care kinda hurts more than it helps.
---
The dbd discord also has lfg np man
---
Quick, someone who's blind tell us what he said!
---
I know this wasn't intended but I really liked this camera angle.
---
Ah yes. When I see an injured and a non injured survivor, the wisest decision is to chase the one who gets a speedboost after I hit him.
---
It not that great but it amazing effect wise.
---
interesting suggestion.  I'll try that out, thanks man. And I'm sorry to hear that you've gone through this hell but it sounds like you handled it well
---
honestly dude you need to focus on loving yourself and being happy with yourself before you worry about what other people think of you. if you are happy with yourself it wont matter what some idiot in a game says about you. friends, family and girlfriends all come and go, having a good relationship with yourself should be of utmost importance 100% of the time. I know you said youve tried therapy and medicine which havent really worked so far but dont give up man. you are a worthwhile human being and deserve to be happy.
---
that spirit was fuckin doodoo bro sorry
---
He was actually initiating mori and as you got up, M1 was registered as a lunge and you got down again but yeah that pallet hit was nasty.
---
Me when I get pulled by the Spirit
---
generation Y and millennials are the same generation... lol
---
Cus it hit your hitbox before you pressed it
---
Ruin is the most popular game slowdown perk, it‚Äôs available to become teachable on the Hag from level 35+. Thanatophobia, available on the nurse to be teachable from level 35+, causes all survivors to receive an action speed penalty for each survivor injured. Since legion injured survivors so easily, he can usually keep this up pretty well. The slow also stacks with sloppy butcher, making heals take forever. Just keep in mind that survivors don‚Äôt really enjoy playing against this.
---
Ruin, thanataphobia, corrupt, STBFL
---
If you mean basic killer perks, maybe slap a NOED or even unrelenting. Whispers is also great
---
That's a super good cosplay dude, i can already hear those oinking noises :D
---
the worst I‚Äôll do is struggle for as long as possible so the other survivor can‚Äôt get hatch if I genuinely feel like they don‚Äôt deserve it
---
Haha, yeah, that was the joke I was going for
---
Magic word is T H E R A P Y
---
It would be like surv friends and that wouldnt be good
---
What do you mean?
---
I have flip flip, boil over, unbeakable, tenacity its a sin for me not to wiggle.
---
That's so bloody dirty it hurts. Rewarding a traitor teammate? When I play as a Killer I won't accept that kind of nonsense. If I see one Survivor rat out one of their own teammates (pointing at lockers is a good example) I'll pretend I never saw the person who was ratted out and it's straight on the hook for the traitor. Even as the Killer I get no satisfaction from hooking someone if it's just because their teammate pretty much handed them to me. The fun is in the chase and finding them yourself. When I've had lag on my end or a Survivor's had lag I won't chase them until the lag is gone because it's cheap to secure a kill on someone who's frozen in place or lagging into you. Fortunately on both sides I've run into as many fair Killers and Survivors as I have unfair or toxic players.
---
Sadly on PS4 blocking definitely doesn‚Äôt work
---
It probably won't be an issue, it'll be something they've tweaked on their side. Since games running dedicated servers they don't need updates for such small changes. Hopefully they change it back. Hopefully.
---
just stop playing the game and play something else...
---
&gt;imagine eating pallets as legion
---
If the survivor is already injured, what do you do? vault them with Frenzy? lol
---
How do you kick someone when you only have 1 leg?
---
Hi, Ghost Face main here. Ghost Face needs a nerf.
---
A few ideas:
---
Decay for Marked status. If you don't finish Marking a survivor, set a timer. After 60 seconds, the meter decreased by maybe 2-8% every second. 
---
Give the survivors an audio warning when entering Night Shroud. Have him start the trial in Night Shroud to prevent Survivors from knowing who it is too early. Or, alternatively, have it within a certain range (24-40M, maybe?)
---
Nighr Shroud deactivates when not in a chase. After actuvating, if a chase isn't entered for maybe 240-360 seconds, Night Shroud deactivates.
---
Audio warning when Ghist Face starts stalking anyone. Pretty self explanitory.
---
These are just ideas, but any could be a good start.
---
I had that like half my playtime yesterday wtf
---
alright just making sure
---
Wow, I haven't played against a killer in awhile that uses Thanatophobia. I forgot bout that perk.
---
yeah thats true, didnt think of that, but thanks for the info
---
Personally, my biggest problem with higher ranks is queue time. I like being in a more mid-tier rank because I can get in matches fast, I see more diversity in killers, and overall it feels more fun to have more diverse matches. Idk man, I just don‚Äôt have fun facing the same 3 killers running the same 4 perks every trial, or finishing a trial in 5 minutes because my teammates gen rushed hardcore. I like the sporadic nature of playing with newbies and seeing different killers.
---
But you‚Äôre still right about higher quality teams at higher ranks.

meme builds obviously don‚Äôt count but treating your subs like that when they just wanted to share with you how they like to play killer is such a dickhead move. he‚Äôs wrong about hatches. I once heard him talk for like 30 minutes about how good of a killer he was, had to stop watching bc that shit was so cringe. base spirit isn‚Äôt balanced in the slightest, now with her collision change it‚Äôs a bit better. and that last thing you mentioned wasn‚Äôt even relevant to the discussion since I wasn‚Äôt even debating that.
---
He said take his ruin
---
I know it's not easy but don't let some random toxic twats ruin your experience. I suffer from depression and serious anxiety as well and I'll admit I've let some nasty comments when gaming online feed into that in the past but you don't have to look. You can ignore and close the chat. If you have a profile they can comment on make it private. Video games are a good coping mechanism for people with stuff like anxiety and that shouldn't be spoiled. Believe it or not you can make friends through online gaming including this one. It's a lottery where you'll either run into the meanest sorts of people or the nicest. If you make friends you can play with them or even have private matches if they're available. You could also ask about adding people to play with on places like here and make it clear you're just looking to have fun, not take the game super seriously.
---
Lol dude shouldn't have broke into his car lol
---
running just enduring is a good idea tho, but SF felt like an overkill. i mean i already have stbfl, thana, ruin and sloppy, where do i exactly put enduring here?
---
but then it's kinda preference in build. i go for more stalling build.  so i guess it was pointless talking about this anyway, yet i also wanted to hear your take on it.
---
My point is, ochido is super fucking toxic and glamourised it, increasing the overall toxicity. Tru3ta1ent can be a dick about builds, but just fucking hates the games unbalanced rng and the fact you have to slug for the 4-man you worked your arse off to get and will probably barely pip up for it.
---
You are missing my point which is that borrowed time is useless anyways even if it procs cause they go down unless they mend mid chase...
---
I'm not in it for the killers satisfaction, I'm in it for my teams and my  own. I'll do whatever I have to to win the game for my team and I, I'm not playing for the opposing person.
---
All I cared about was her hearing grunts of pain which turns the mindgame into ‚Äúhope you‚Äôre on the right side of the window‚Äù and that‚Äôs the one thing they didn‚Äôt address
---
thanks mate!  that means a lot to me and I do want to try to make friends on DBD given the overwhelming support I've received.  I felt alone and now I feel hopeful thanks to you and the kind others in this thread.  I appreciate it so much man, bless your soul

Lmfao man after my own heart

But it still triggered as you can see in the exhaustion icon.

Are you the same Claudette I played with last night? I was a Claudette with the green apron on and the Halloween hair. username was Lele.
---
And if you're going against a good 4 man swf?
---
Do gens and get a save just before struggle/death for each stage. Killer will either 1 for 1 or tunnel. 
---
Run anti tunnel perks
---
I dunno about iron maiden, but its not bad
---

---
Thanatophobia is literally useless even at 4 stacks and Sloppy is often not good on Legion since half decent survivors won't heal at all. You can remove either or both and go for Enduring + SF. 
---
Thanatophobia at 4 stacks (16%) adds just 12s to a solo generator, 6s to a self-heal and 3s to a heal. For comparison, doing a totem takes longer than Thanatophobia debuff to a generator or opening a chest takes about the same amount of time.
---
The game has a built in system that blocks keyboard and mouse inputs
---
B R U H
---
if you feel the need to slug and waste everyone‚Äôs time just for a 4K then that is 100% your problem. pipping at red ranks is a pain in the ass for everyone I‚Äôve had a million games where I‚Äôve played well and only safety pipped. sorry but Ochido breeds toxicity on survivor side and tru3 breeds toxicity on killer side
---
It took 3 replies to get to porn
---
New record for me finding
---
Damn huntress always stream(er) sniping
---
This is great. Too bad this sort of content is underappreciated on the subreddit
---
It used to give you a stack for every unhook and it was like ‚Äú25/50/100% increased healing to the max of 100 for 60 seconds‚Äù but then to make tiers 1 and 2 not useless they made all tiers 100% and changed something else (I think the time)
---
Dedicated servers are less responsive than P2P even though our ping is lower on the main menu. Some people say you need to take in consideration the killer's ping but I am not entirely sure about that.
---
This is absolutely amazing
---
No, it is obliviousness I am pretty sure.
---
Yeah this guy who was streaming was super toxic and acted like ochido. His wife was not toxic in game but insulted me constantly thru the match and in the end game chat kinda like ochido did when he was still able to play the game.
---
I said that I did that...
---
WHY ARE WE YELLING!?

I honestly see this in Every killer lobby. It might be intentional?

As a survivor main I don‚Äôt think Freddy needs a nerf tbh, he‚Äôs just annoying to go against. borrowed time does need to be changed but that isn‚Äôt only something that happens with him specifically. and forever Freddy is pretty busted but I honestly don‚Äôt encounter it horribly often.
---
I have hard you always get banned if you are reported trough a ticket atleast ones
---
I really wish I could unsee this.
---
I'm sorry for what you're mentally going through, I really hope you find peace &amp; reach out for professional help. Also, remember this is just a game. That has no significant meaning to your life, so don't let it become one. Yes, enjoy the game &amp; love it if you do, but do not let the toxcity of others in a game make you feel this way.
---
My bad 
---
r/whoosh
---
Yesterday I had a killer complain about genrush when the gens took like 10 minutes..
---
This is just so wrong. At high ranks, half the time I down someone in like 2 minutes or so and lose 1 to 2 gens during that time. Its just dumb.
---
Yeah, a statue!
---
What about David. He might have had a few after all the fighting he did.
---
Honestly just think they should just turn it off period as it would be way to strong as a perk if they removed really good loops and shit
---

Tbh the amount of times resilience+spine chill saved my bum is too damn high. Glad that Aaron showed me the way
---
i think this happens all the time (or very often for me at least) when you have the Loadout tab open and you connect to a lobby. i like it as well, up close and personal
---
Well, wiggle points were only introduced recently (Patch 3.3.1)
---
Newbie to abbreviations here, what‚Äôs BNP?
---
Agree
---
If you're a ps4 player we can be friends. If you're pc then damn.
---
I don't have a problem with killers being strong, but Spirit was just too good (especially with some Add ons).
---
&gt; and with sf+enduring you also cut a few seconds at best.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; guess what? seconds matter.
---
The difference is pressure, reason why I don't run pseudo game slowing perks and instead, I try to build pressure by ending chases ASAP. 
---
Spirit Fury + Enduring not only will buy me seconds but also build up pressure on survivors by forcing them to travel all the way to the hooked guy, removing 2 people from generators for that time being. 
---
While the other perks might buy you 10s but thats about it and if you can't catch survivor, these extra 10s don't mean much.
---
Anywhrre
---
same thing on ps4
---
"Left one escapes death?" Is that my left or your left?
---
difference between nurse and spirit tho, nurse needs skill to be able to decimate, you don't need to be a god to play spirit, just run green addons, stridor, ruin ect and fuck up the team.
---
That noise tho

Marge: Oh Homer, you sacrificed yourself for me!

Homer: Now *you* do the same for *me* and we'll both be free!
---
I had the same problem and I think I've fixed it.
---
Go into settings and at the top is "Quality". Set it from Ultra to High or Medium. See if that helps?
---
In that case I can say Otzdarva says its insane
---
I like it on legion not always you smack with frenzy and when you down, the quick recovery closes followup chases quickly. And stacks obviously are easy
---
Reported for that message you deleted right after you sent it
---
Yes thats Good too
---
He means his sprint burst will not activate while using the map he‚Äôs not going any faster
---
By resetting your pc do you mean a hard reset?
---
Quality art but it isn't Nea. Not in personality or appearanc.
---
That‚Äôs not a fix.
---
With Spirit Fury + Enduring not only is the stun time heavily reduced, but the loop is destroyed with a broken pallet and you're just a few feet away from Legion. It can be a annoying combination for survivors but boy is it fun, especially on those who wait by pallets to specifically stun you
---
Playing with Iridescent Head, 3 hatchets and then tunnel and use a mori..
---
I mean, how long have you been disconnected from the game? 'Cause this has been for quite a long time now.

Yah I get super hype but I can‚Äôt imagine how shocked/mad they are

That should teach those pesky leaves to stay out of the damn backyard!

---
Please, spare me! I thought "The LEG" was bad but know this?!
---
The Entity isn't paying him well, so he had to take a second job to make ends meet.
---
Well, you can control the game to a certain degree right? Survivors doesn't dictate how the game goes, killer does.
---
*just a little bit*
---
Ok, so is trying to kill the last survivor
---
then as killer i should facecamping because my job is kill survivors ¬øright?
---
And then you wait ANOTHER 10 minutes and still don't get a lobby
---
Oh, then probably not, but still not an intended feature, so not something you SHOULD use.
---
if you do gens all game and never get chased by the killer you won't pip which means it isn't the only objective. Plus it requires no skill you just hold m1 all game most people who only do gens don't even know how to loop the killer
---
Can he do it to the r/shitpostcrusaders mods as well
---
Make sense, if your hope is to find other survivor who are not that good at loops, but if you face vs 4 good SWF this way is not gonna help at all. Because if you change your target to another survivor, and he good as well, and start you loop at another place, you just waste your time to find another survivor and stuck with another loop, while other survivors keep working on gens
---
This video is pretty famous, not giving it credit is stupid

I saw you were all getting downvoted by the killer mains so I had to bump yall back up! I'm doing my part! :D

---

---
This setup is pretty good so far. I find balanced landing to be the best exhaustion perk honestly. I wouldn‚Äôt try using dead hard all that much since it only works half the time bc of latency issues. I‚Äôd advise going for Meg next as all of her teachables are pretty good (adrenaline is a must have for many survivors) and maybe Laurie for her decisive strike or Bill for his borrowed time seeing as many killers in those ranks tend to camp and tunnel. I wouldn‚Äôt advise running urban evasion as it can end up wasting you and your team a lot of time if you crouch around the map or you can grow to rely on it too much and won‚Äôt know how to stealth around a killer otherwise (speaking from personal experience w this one).
---
The concept of "genrush" is as stupid as the concept of "tunnelling". If you are the Killer and you are chasing a Sruvivor, what do you expect from the other Survivors to do? Just watch you and chill? Of course they are going to repair the generators! Same logic applies to the concept of "tunnelling": you are running against a supposed-to-be **killer**. Do you really expect from him to just let you go because "he can't focus only on you"? It doesn't make sense at all.
---
If you are going instead to say that tunnelling isn't fun, then I agree with you, but that's a problem the developers need to worry about, and not the players, since they aren't breaking any rules and the game rewards them for it. Same goes for "gen rushing". If almost everybody uses ruin it has to meanthat maybe the generators get repaired too fast, but the developers still seem clueless about this.
---
What a mad lad
---
the hookers
---
Keys.
---
Yeah fuck them for advertising you don't even look at most of the time.
---
This is true. When I play survivor in red ranks I'm much less likely to get mad about dying because usually it's not my teammate's fault or anything like that I've just simply been outplayed. Same deal when I escape. 
---
Playing in low purple/green ranks is just begging for me to fucking explode at my teammates after the match. Consistently stupid people for some strange reason.
---
That isn‚Äôt good. If a survivor tries to rat out other survivors I would tunnel camp then let everyone else go because it ruins the game for the other people trying to play and have fun.
---
You will notice that I talk about Cypress Mori being useless, so... no.
---
Rip god pallet and please look behind you lol
---
Brand New Part. Ultra rare toolbox addon. Used to instantly complete a generator back in the day, so 4 BNP‚Äôs = 4 generators instantly completed within SECONDS of a trial. 
---
First rework saw them changed so you had to complete a series of skill checks to complete a generator. They were fast and pretty tiny but still easy enough that it was unequivocally broken. 
---
Current iteration lets you complete 25%(?) of a generator by succeeding a series of skill checks. Nothing to scoff at, but compared to their glory days it‚Äôs pretty rough.
---
Thank you.
---
‚ÄúNo‚Äù ok I‚Äôll give up my suggestion because of the well-formulated 1 word counter-argument.
---
New killer: ultra violet solar radiation!
---
This is pretty shitty but I did get stuff a lot worse back in the day. Literal teleportation of me and/or the killer anywhere from 3 feet to 30.
---
What do they have to do with Moris?
---
You are really new but I recommend leveling Claudette first for Self Care so you can heal yourself. I run self care, Botany Knowledge (both Claudette perks), We‚Äôll Make it (General perk), and then either Spine chill (General perk). That‚Äôs a support build though so... 
---
The meta build is Decisive Strike (Laurie Strode), Dead Hard (David King), Adrenaline (Meg Thomas) and Borrowed Time (Bill) OR Self-Care (Claudette).
---
But yours isn‚Äôt bad right now until you level the other characters for the perks
---
If mori's were to be reworked then the keys would be too, so no.
---
At least you actually have to do gens to get keys to work
---
I‚Äôd run kindred, balanced, spine chill and a 4th perk of your choice from the perks you currently have. Considering that you are new, urban evasion is good for the 4th spot until you learn the game and get better at it. 
---
My current build is adrenaline, borrowed, balanced, ds. Dead hard is currently fucked up by the dedicated servers, so I don‚Äôt recommend it until they fix the issue with dead hard. Once they fix it you can switch dead hard with either borrowed or balanced.
---
Also by the time goes on, you‚Äôll be able to find your own setup. In example whether I have balanced or not I always end up going high ground (of course if the map has some sort of high ground such as hill, harvester etc). So I always keep balanced. As I said you‚Äôll eventually find your own setup.
---
Bill laughs at us mere mortals

---
chances are one of your fellow survivors is gonna see you going between lockers and sandbag as much as possible so odds for hiding the entire match from every single other person seems pretty slim to me.
---
Now if only you would have been smart and clicked into the chat window so it's easier to read.
---
Agreed when I see a killer without ruin I immediately think either: easy game, or, ooooh shit we are fucked
---
I'm reporting this. I feel personally targeted.
---
It is mostly good on killers like Plague or Legion that can get you injured quickly. Problem is, by itself it isn¬¥t that amazing, and it is only really good if you pair it with other stuff like Sloppy Butcher or Dying Light.
---
I agree on this one yeah
---
Killer's dependence on Ruin doesn't change the fact that it's a random-based perk unfun to play against.
---
mall bell ghost!
---
STBFL is really damn good on Legion, not sure why it would be so bad. He builds up stacks much faster than other killers and you cannot down in Frenzy, after that he becomes an M1 killer...
---
That's a good point, I definitely think keys should be nerfed also though.
---
Lol, in this case you just suck. No offence.
---

---
You can get stacks for it from frenzy, when youre chasing injured survivors and down them, you can instantly switch targets and/or reduce downtime. Additionally, if you dont have frenzy up, you can be extremely dangerous with basically no cooldown
---
You can just gen rush right off the back it's happened many many times when I have brought an ebony in the past
---
Right? If Keys need to be reworked too, then so be it. Just because further change is required does not mean we sit on our hands and do nothing. It can be a step-by-step process.
---
yeah this happens way too often. joining a lobby as a rank 9 survivor and watching all the rank 18's join or like you said getting survivors my rank but then after the match it turns out the killer was rank 18. 
---
These matches just aren't fun.
---
Are you trying to do gens all from 0% to 100%? Because you only need to be on a gen as it finishes to have it count towards the challenge. I was able to do it after my third try knowing that that's all it took.
---
Cursed Leg
---
Exploitive? You mean like Haddon field balance landing? Or the rotten God loop? Or maybe when everyone used wake up when was glitched. Or when everybody did bring insta Mori in every game before the Nerf? I can find thousand of examples that applies in the real games easily, not many from killers tho
---
That‚Äôs my biggest draw to his gameplay. Being able to keep up his commentary while playing at that level is just amazing. 
---
If you get the time you should check out his tier list videos on each killer, assuming you like to play killer lol. He gives mid rank and rank 1 builds for most of them, and gives reasoning behind all his perk choices. I will say however I disagree where he has a couple killers placed, especially Hag, but it makes for an interesting watch.
---
He should have brought a flashlight with battery addons to navigate with echolocation and bring nothing but aura reading perks.
---
Congratulations you wont get noeded
---
I just mean powering down and powering back on.
---
I didn't get any but I bet I'd get GG EZ if I didn't do this xD
---
Iron will for an immersed build?
---
Ah yes, slugging and noed make a killer sweaty
---
Imagine comparing the biggest man child, toxic, exploitive, cheater ever existed in the community with tru3talent
---
My philosophy too :P
---
Yeah it is. He's referring to ironworks of misery, right?
---
All rite then..
---
This. Killers should focus the weakest survivor and survivors should focus gens. its their objective in the game. I do wish the devs would do something about it though. As a survivor i want more to do besides sitting at a gen and holding left mouse button. And getting tunneled isn't fun like you said. its just not something to blame the killer for.
---
You will notice I talk about Cypress Moris being useless, so... no.
---
Never seen that happen. I have seen them being unreachable because of placement, but never literally outside of the playarea.
---
That was toxic the whole match then teabagging and wouldn't leave at the exit yes she will get the noed. No toxic = no noed.
---
That other guy is talking nonsense, but this argument has to be the worst I‚Äôve written in weeks.  
---
If struggling is intended gameplay why doesn‚Äôt it just autostruggle?  
---
What benefit do you get from not wiggling other than a ‚Äúmind game‚Äù that the killer might give you the hatch?
---
If they make it death hook only I wouldn‚Äôt care lol I don‚Äôt use them anyways.
---
It's for toxic survivors so yeah it is x'D
---
Xbox capture only records 45 seconds I'll just go back in my time machine and change it ok.
---
so it would take you four hooks to kill everyone versus the normal 9-12....uhhh okay then. if running DS is the only way to counter dying in the first minute and a half of the game then that‚Äôs still pretty BS, kinda like only running iron will for spirit. Ebonies are basically a guaranteed 4K as long as the killer isn‚Äôt a complete potato, and as long as keys aren‚Äôt a guaranteed 4-man escape (which they definitely aren‚Äôt), they‚Äôll never be on the same level of unbalanced.
---
Chaotic neutral
---
Ah okay
---
No, it's useless.
---
just because you‚Äôre a little better at hiding it doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt also toxic, sorry buddy
---
Nom
---
Good point. I need to think about it.
---
Instead of face camping, they proxy camp by staying in the area of the hook and maybe checking the closest gen but coming back to the hook every 15 seconds to check on the hooked survivor. Alot of baby killers do it.
---
Shitty people like that need to be validated and that‚Äôs how they do it.  I‚Äôm a solo survivor and I‚Äôve had SWF ruin a match for me. Whether it‚Äôs trolling, hook diving, or doing nothing.  I‚Äôve also been in a situation where one or two are downed/hooked across the map and I get the gate open and leave.  They complain about ‚Äúbeing abandoned‚Äù.
---
Nothing to do with not paying attention. Skill checks can catch you off guard for a number of reasons. They can be super laggy, Huntress Lullaby, or even just those awful ones that spawn right at the start of the circle so you have a nanosecond to hit it.
---
Well said brother, I think ruin should have been a trapper teachable for how badly he needs it
---
I might be tripping but aren‚Äôt you the guy that comments the link to that hitbox post every time someone complains about hitboxes
---
you can stand and not activated her traps, its just walking or running that triggers it
---
If everyone began to block people and became unable to be matched with said people, the queue times would be absolutely ridiculous.

When I first loaded up dbd after the update I got this screen 3 times in a row and thought it was part of the update. Even said to my friends that I like the new lobby view and they were confused by what I meant lol
---
Lol ur fucking garbage, just dont get hit
---
Yea I had that too, it looks so cool
---
Typical frustrated player. I meet this kind of people every 3/4 games
---
Wut? I'm not sarcastic. I say it post game obviously.
---
I got Adept Shape without much problem, despite the fact his perks contradicted each other a lot back in the day (PWYF and STBFL encourage you to not bother with the obsession, while the old Dying Light actually encouraged you to kill her ASAP). 
---
IMO the hardest adepts are Freddy and Huntress, since you might as well be playing perkless for how useful their unique perks are, even though they themselves are pretty strong killers.
---
meme
---
Lol then pay more attention to these things you mentioned it's not like you don't know what they do.
---
This a type of me I want to send to my friends but then remember they don't play dbd.
---
Yeah, I know. If it did happen there would have to be a limit on how many. 
---
Like I said though, it‚Äôs probably best just to move on
---
You can do a generator from 99% to 100% three times in a match and it counts. You just have to finish the generator, you dont need to fully repair it.
---
If I don‚Äôt loop the killer, I die. I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for keeping the killer off of everyone because they decide to funnel me.
---
If they're that horrible I would just dodge the lobby
---
Right! 
---
Whatever you do is wrong to them
---
Oh he‚Äôs not on console
---
Imagine not just dodging the lobby instead of bitching.
---
I genuinely did this a few weeks ago in a shop around Halloween. Turned the corner into an aisle and Ghost Face's mask is staring right at me. I tried to Sprint Burst irl but I must have had Exhausted or something.
---
I probably should‚Äôve, I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have fun but was kinda annoyed about being denied adept
---
Oh wow, i usually get downvoted to oblivion for saying this :P I'm sure the Spine Chill users will come mass-downvote you but i agree.
---
Game sense and a good headset = no need for Spine Chill. I can see how it can be useful on console though, since people don't look behind them in chases as much &amp; might not use a headset etc...
---
So "Tunneling / Camping" is not a thing either cuz its the Killers Job.
---
I want my perks to be colored like that :o
---
Killer main bad
---
Survivor main good
---
Killing survivors is your main objective, tunneling is the most effective way and camping when done smartly helps to achieve that aswell
---
Survivors doing gens quickly isn't toxic, you're right, killers killing survivors quickly also isn't toxic, I'm sure you agree
---
The adept killer achievements are kinda stupid tho, wish they changed it to a 4K and not a merciless victory. You dont need to double pip as a survivor.
---
If this were a thing then every spirit ever would get blocked in a heartbeat
---
Kinda overdone at this point
---
I mean I didn't take the screenshot because my game went all blurry
---
&gt;Also, I don't know how Michael can almost start a game with the ability too.
---
Someone must've fed him. 
---
&gt;Like five minutes in and he is full beast mode.
---
5 minutes is a lot of time in DBD...
---
Personally not a fan of thanataphobia but if you like the perk then I think it's a good build
---
imagine reading the full post?
---
I play pc with an xbox controller and i'm doing fine.
---
What can you do, it is what it is right now.
---
Yeah this is a really annoying thing that happens to both sides honestly. To pip in red ranks as survivor you gotta lose the killer ten times, unhook 20 survivors, repair 15 generators, and cleanse all 5 totems. to pip in red ranks as killer you gotta hook 20 survivors, down 30 survivors, and damage 100 generators. old pipping system worked better tbh
---
Most of them are timed or conditional, so learn to waste time with stuff like looping until they run out. You don¬¥t die on first hook so being instadowned is not the biggest deal.
---
Michael needs quite some time to get to Evil 3 if you don¬¥t feed him. Try to look around more at the start of the match to spot him stalking you, and always try to keep some objects between you and him during the match so he doesn¬¥t get Evil 3 back up again soon.
---
Yeah but I want to learn on keyboard so I so ignorantly thought I would be fine.... I wasn't fine and didn't win a single game as survivor lmao.
---
PainReliever just has the most awesome voice of all dbd content creators
---
What does bming mean I see it all the time and I know it basically means to be an asshole but idk what it actually stands for
---
I got it on my first try, all you need to do is to complete a gen. It doesn't matter if you're on your own or not.
---
I know, can make any game instantly 110% better
---
Very nice indeed
---
I personally liked the nurse rework. Good nurses are still, well good. However bad nurses are no longer carried hard by addons.
---
All fun and games until this boi pulls out the walking cane
---
That's pixel art meme
---
/s
---
It takes quite a bit of practice to convert, but once you learn it PC is so much better in my opinion
---
People like that lack the mental ability to understand this.
---
If he fails he'd rather set himself on fire than have somebody else a minor feeling of achievement. That alone tells you all you need to know about him.
---
I lost count of how many times i pressed the dedard button but the animation delay fucked me
---
And yes, the national anthem was necessary
---
Have you considered that maybe survivors have been receiving nerfs because they've been the blatantly stronger side for years?
---
Fun fact: they still are
---
If the killer slugs the last person and goes on a 5 minute expedition to find you, he most likely won't give you the hatch. 
---
Now, I'm going to tell you why noed killers often don't give you the hatch. Let's start by saying that I have yet to find a good killer who uses noed. Most red rank killers rarely use noed. And that's not because they respect an imaginary rule book but because they believe in their skill to win the game before 5 gens are done. If the killer is using noed, that often means he is not confident enough in his ability to get kills before the endgame. And those killers oftentimes are quite bad and won't give you the hatch either if they down you. Ask yourself: How many killers down you with noed and carry you straight to the hatch?
---
I have to assume that a supernatural leg monster is unaffected by gravity and is able to lift its foot and swing as if it was supported by another leg.
---
Oh trust me. As someone who is avidly against the idea that Spine Chill is a top tier perk, I get downvoted a lot too. I'm sure reddit survivors are somewhere between "brand new" and "just getting good" at this game. So many terrible opinions are echoed on here, it's embarrassing.
---
Because you used a splinter
---
Oh okay I see. Thanks. Yeah I really should stop running to the closed gen.
---
Bodyblocking is one of the things that are just perfect for SWFs
---
Everybody can do it but without communication it's really difficult to pull off. When you can sit on Discord and say "Bodyblock I can wiggle off" it's a surefire way to prevent a hook.
---
Good point. Seconds really do matter in this game. Thanks.
---
DC, if it is a spirit!!
---
Freddy looks cute
---
Id smash
---
Try somehow being a Rank 4 survivor while possessing the actual skill of a Rank 15 and then you will know pain.
---
Yeah but it should display everything as Myers not billy and trapper.
---
Amen my dude
---
Whos joe
---
Eh, blinding at a pallet and then doubling back is a play that non-top tier killers fall for every single time and gives you way more than a 3 second advantage.
---
So on 19 they will reveal the character HOT DAMN
---
To be fair. Alastor and freddy can kinda be similar
---
Rogue One
---
*wouldn't have
---
That's like saying musicians with egos aren't talented. Sometimes those two things go hand in hand.
---
Perks: Deja Vu, Kindred, Object of Obsession, Dark Sense.
---
In the chest because Steve‚Äôs a treasure
---
Don‚Äôt forget the hearty chuckle
---
Sad part, if that bitch is within full group SWF, then this person WILL be saved. No matter how hard you try, all three of them will come for the save. 
---
 Unless you have a chainsaw at ur disposal, then you better don't even try to camp.
---
WAZAAAAAAA
---
I can only talk about myself, but i give the hatch each time i had a great game. 
---
4K are reserved for games where i tryhard because of ingame behaviour, which also happens much more seldom then discussed here (survivors teabagging for example, it happens like maybe each 20th game, and only one guy)
---
The healing speed of WMI caps at 100%, so if you dont have tier 3 and unhook multiple people then the speed increases. However, perks like Botany and Leader can stack it over 100 because they're a different perk
---
When the thing doesn't flip
---
And you think 'holy shit'
---
That's a mori
---
Little body blocking shits. And that's when borrowed time and DS are used for total toxicity. Seriously it's making me hate playing the game... the devs HAVE to do something about it. :( I love DbD but I cant play more than 1 game without hating it anymore on killer side.
---
The time its active is 30/60/90 seconds. Tier 1 and 2 are 70 and 80% I believe
---
Gen x are the ones who grew up on Nintendo, 80s slashers and MTV. Rap and Grunge.  We are a crazy bunch. You can tell DBD was made by Gen Xers. Calling people boomers is silly. My Dad is a boomer and he is the nicest guy.
---
Volume warning? Jfc
---
Can a killer tell me what they see when this happens or is it just that they swing to late and still get the hit like we see.
---
Isn‚Äôt the escape cake just a picture of a cake?
---
That sucks , i got Robbed  25 k bp from that shiet
---
People thought fully repair and completing were the same thing
---
Not so much, but it's a discovery everytime
---
without killer mains there will be no game
---
No, nobody wants to see a truetalent video.
---
Wraith is extremely hard, as his perks don't slow the game nor help in chases, while his ability has little impact in chases or map pressure.
---
Huntress has bad perks yet her power is good.
---
Same for trapper.
---
Cannibal has bad power, but his perks are really good.
---
You can detect people farther but since they gutted Legion you'll probably not reach them in time
---
Way to build the brand Steve!
---
At first I just thought you were straight up missing bc T1 lunge but then he turned into the nurse and just straight up phased through that first vault lol glad you reported him
---
Let's all be honest here, we all were expecting the head to come off the first time, i mean they could do different versions for certain countrys and all, but y'know BHVR.
---
Hit someone with the crouch attack, if it's not giving points then try and record it and notify devs via support ticket
---
Only peasants submit to turning the volume down
---
Sorry, what? Have you never seen his mori? He always has it on him.
---
Best crossover ever
---
It should be a face kick, when they try and unhook you, you have the option to kick them off you.
---
Guy no mither is counter for everything
---
congratulations, you played yourself.
---
Balance suck
---
I mostly run it because I despise spirit, the extra vault speed is nice too.Neither of these are to do with awareness but I can understand the want for another perk slot.
---
STOLEN MEME
---
It wad cowsIAM, a 4 killer 1 survivor video. Good video, but op should have credited
---
Hiw was this not downvoted to oblivion? This is like saying that tunneling or camping is ok, after all killers are only doing their objective and this is coming from someone who plays both sides.
---
Do you leave after 1, 2 moris or when there is unkown offdring
---
If after 1 you can waster YOUR time because it could be green mori
---
If after 2 again you wasting time and thats being dick. 
---
If after unkown offering you are ultimate pussy and dick at the same time because he could just taken"everyone starts alone" or he just wanted to do his daily. 
---
Either way i fucking hate you.
---
Last time I played with a streamer the killer got mad at us and called us all toxic because he was bad and couldn't kill the streamer before the exit gates were open and someone body-blocked to save the streamer
---
It wasn't a guy having fun with streamers. It was a toxic, salty asshole who decided "hey this guy is a streamer so I'm gonna try to be a dick and fuck you if I can't"
---
Last time I tried to be nice they DC'd.
---
Never again.
---
So much toxicity in one clip. From you tbagging like a chump to the killer just being a camping punk, it's ridiculous. Why would you upload this just to show a really standard use of DS?
---
Yeah, Wraith is definitely a tough one too. You can ease the pain by using some good addons, but it'll still be a challenge. All you can do is wait for rank reset and hope you get to verse an uncoordinated team.
---
Trapper wasn't as difficult IMO. All you need is a basement near the middle of the map, and you can then snowball very easily off of a single basement hook. Got mine on Rotten Fields IMO, just by trapping the shack perimeter and getting one of them to the basement.
---
Plays against a piggy with mask add on, and the hex blindness
---
Let me tell you something kinda interesting:
---
This picture was taken at a hostpital. Diabetes is bad, but getting a ps4 in your room is very nice
---
If he was hiding and not doing anything the whole match then I understand. Otherwise it‚Äôs just a shitty troll move.
---
It seems I am not the only one then.
---
Survivors looking like they about to tour through egypt.
---
You are a very open-minded person. Thank you.
---
Dude shut the fuck up
---
he wasn‚Äôt doing anything, just hiding in corners, otherwise i wouldn‚Äôt have done that.
---
*clicker
---
Trapper in my case. xD
---
So a player that doesn't look behind him against a killer you should look behind 90% of the time complains. This is so sad
---
Are you sure it‚Äôs a hack and not a bug? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve heard about such a bug before
---
Whenever I get this map, I always go see Maurice even if it gets me killed. The poor horse needs all the pets and love. I've had a Ghostface join in once and it was hilarious
---
Cock and ball torture (CBT) is a sexual activity involving application of pain or constriction to the male genitals. This may involve directly painful activities, such as wax play, genital spanking, squeezing, ball-busting, genital flogging, urethral play, tickle torture, erotic electrostimulation or even kicking.[1] The recipient of such activities may receive direct physical pleasure via masochism, or emotional pleasure through erotic humiliation, or knowledge that the play is pleasing to a sadistic dominant. Many of these practices carry significant health risks.
---
So much toxicity in one reply. I teabagged at the start because like I said, the killer was tunnelling and camping the whole game, leading to one survivor dcing and another dying on hook. Sorry I didn't use a 'non-standard' use of DS, forgot this community was only for pros you wanker
---
I'm pretty sure. His account has 12 hours and 2 out of the rest survivors were in his friendslist.
---
That's a normal and favorable spot.
---
Strangely cute. A bit floppy but captivating somehow xD
---
Gen rushing is a desing problem not a problem of the survivors
---
It looked more like auto aim making you miss to me, I‚Äôve missed plenty of free hits like that bc auto aim decided I should M1 the gen or pallet next to the person I‚Äôm chasing instead
---
God, I‚Äôd sacrifice my baby Dwight for this. 
---
I‚Äôve suggested this feature to be added since I‚Äôve started watching streamers play this game, and people‚Äôs‚Äô responses are usually, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôd be a stupid feature. Why is that even needed? Survivors would just be toxic!‚Äù  even though it‚Äôs pretty self-explanatory...? Idk what would be the downside.
---
I think it should only allow one survivor to leave with an add-on that allows 1 additional survivor but immediately destroy the key.
---
At least the killers can spell! Oh wait...
---
*Hello this is dog*
---
If it would, would you buff perk itself? Or how would you cut base version?
---
Played a match with full Blendettes, the killer didnt find us the whole match
---
I‚Äôll let the last survivor get that hatch depending on how the match went. If it was an absolute stomp then I‚Äôll let them get it. If it was a close call I might feel generous but if it‚Äôs a stomp on my end, no mercy.
---
Man the killers main al ready hates the swf and you are not helping
---
People who play Huntress have no problem revealing GF
---
Death is not an escape
---
Why would you block them tho? The second time you didnt dodge and you did let them escape. 
---
I mean, do whatever you want, write gg and leave. Depending on how fast you do it you wont even see their salt. Ez
---
Remember Sloppy
---
I dunno, ask the one legged man in the ass kicking contest
---
This. I was using Detective‚Äôs Hunch yesterday and got that map. The spot Ruin was in I would have never even thought about looking.
---
Lol yah bugs dont let you run thru walls
---
Just because the killer is toxic doesn't make you tbagging any less toxic. I don't get why that's such a hard concept for people to grasp. 
---
I'm not looking for pro play, just don't see why you thought this clip was worth uploading when nothing interesting happened.
---
Thats a new one, never seen ghost hacks before
---
Be funnier if it was just keyboard mash haha
---
Ditto
---
Level up Meg af
---
That spot is used in the trailer when they showcased Steve and Nancy with the new map
---
You sure you didn‚Äôt time it wrong? Sometimes in the heat of the game, during chases, time feels so much longer
---
i had at least 3 matches like this yesterday, they'd be camping from a short distance &amp; run up on the unhooker &amp; down me again
---
Archives challenges most likely.
---
They both seem a little over powered especially the deep would.
---
Oh yeah, that one where you have to kill everyone by any means?
---
It's also my first time seeing this. Hopefully just an exception and not the next trend in hacking..
---
Maurice is the only creature besides crows. Do we know if he only moves and make noise when a survivor is near like crows or not?
---
people don't tunnel because they don't want to slug someone for the 60s ds timer if they are smart enough and you tunneled everyone of them having ds then it is a gg!
---
Face camping is at a all time high with these challenges. If you call yourself giving the killer a run for his money they‚Äôll make you suffer once they get to you. Demegorgon, Ghostface, and a doctor with some insane add on where his power range was frickin ridiculous. I try not to complain though I know not everyone is gonna be challenging.
---
Hatch was right there....
---
Kinda, yeah, but there's always DS. But remember that the best counter to camping doesn't require a perk. Do gens. It sucks, yeah, but if you know he's camping, punish him for it
---
It is possible I guess, maybe I just miscalculated lol
---
This. Have been for years.
---
Oh look another "teaser" that explains fuck all.
---
Thanks BHVR.
---
It seems that they were listening for the hatch instead of looking. It's hard to hear a closed hatch.
---
Same meme but saying " sorry for being a survivor main"
---
 The unhooker is using bt. There's nothing saying the hooked survivor has ds. You can't just assune everyone has ds. Doing gens doesn't counter camping, it punishes it. In order for it to be considered a counter, you need to unhook the camped survivor. Oblivious was unnecessarily given to Freddy and had the side effect of countering bt by just existing.
---
Everybody gangsta until they hear a chainsaw with Bubba grunting noises
---
First, it's t-bagging, spamming flashlight, not hooking victims to let them bleed out, and other types of behaviours to taunt people. 
---
Second, it's usage of unintended exploits, for example, looping an obstacle or waiting near pallet instead of trying to run away or hide will result in guaranteed facecamping in game against me, because if you taunt the scary killer or try to waste his time instead of trying to save your life - you will die, period.
---
I had some suuuuper toxic survivors as Freddy, one on hook between 2 exit gates both exits trapped , noed between them both and blood warden 4 when they open the gate, they went key hunting and 3 escapedüòì
---
I have not seen a single infinite in the past year. Just because you have to vault the window as killer a few times doesn‚Äôt make it an infinite. With how garbage dedicated servers are, half the exhaustion perks are not even working. Everyone gets hit through pallets and windows. I would say the game is more killer sided. When you have a very coordinated swf is the only time it‚Äôs easier for survivors because of communication. They nerfed loops and rebalanced more maps so there‚Äôs a lot more unsafe pallets now.
---
She's sporty.
---
How you got that kind of knowledge? O.o
---
I used it during the heal, I would assume that's what it is asking for.
---
Better safe than sorry.
---
Dead hard should work in any direction.
---
BBQ is pretty much mandatory for the extra bloodpoints for newer players, helps a ton with the grind.
---
Ruin is great always.
---
Sloppy Butcher+Thana is a nice combo on Legion. 
---
Save The Best For Last is top tier due to him simply becoming an M1 killer without his power and he can get stacks really quickly.
---
Pop Goes The Weasel is great to apply more lategame pressure to gens.
---
Personally I would either run BBQ, Ruin, Sloppy+Thana or BBQ, Ruin, STBFL, PGTW
---
Legion does not really need a lot of tracking perks thanks to his power. And you can try swapping Ruin for Corrupt Intervention to see if you like it more.
---
Poor Rin, just wondering what she did to deserve being surrounded by these monsters and murderhobos.
---
Well that sucks. I haven‚Äôt upgraded Claud at all and I only have a brown Med Kit
---
I am not saying make DS duration 30 seconds. If Killer would pick up surv after 30 seconds, killer still would be stunned for 5 seconds by DS
---
Imho, NOED should be base. It's only fair
---
Ghostface is an M1 killer if you run spine chill
---
How stupid are you that your not understanding?
---
If you shoot a bullet and you keep going foward youll get hit by the bullet
---
But if you go to the side of the bullet you wont get hit
---
You want me to dumbify it more for you?
---
After 30 seconds? That sort of defeats DS‚Äôs purpose of anti tunnel/camping.
---
I think you should re-read post
---
The term ‚Äúgen rushing‚Äù is coined by bad killers who blame their lack of pressure on gen times. Survivors are simply doing the objective.
---
Ruin and BBQ are great as always. BBQ is less needed. Always run ruin. Always.
---
STBFL is good because you can build up stacks and then it‚Äôs easier to down people with just m1
---
Pop goes the weasel is great for nae naeing on gens
---
Sloppy Butcher (especially when combined with thanataphobia) is good for slowing down the game
---
I‚Äôm all ears is good for tracking in frenzy so you don‚Äôt lose someone after hitting them 
---
The best add ons (imo) are:
---
-Duration Add ons (always try to run one of these)
---
-Etched Ruler only, the common ruler is useless
---
-Filthy Blade only, the green blade is useless 
---
-Iridescent Button, pallet breaking and lots of info 
---
Killer instinct add ons should only be brought assuming you really have nothing else to run
---
Lol I like how you delete your comments
---
isn't that the point? as they are trying to balance it to averagly getting 2Ks.
---
I tend to give hatches in the event of early/multiple DCs, or I've just done a ritual. I've always found friendly interactions in video games from two sides who are meant to stop each other amazing.
---
Need to get some streamers to get involved with some latency tests to see what it looks like from both perspectives.
---
I ran borrowed time, we‚Äôre gonna make it, botany and empathy. Got lucky and had it done without a few minutes of the first trial. I found it easier to heal an unhooked survivor than just an injured one.
---
Survivor: literally running for their life.
---
Killer: toxic looping! I'm gonna face camp.
---
Even before the trials for like 3days straight I played and it seemed every killer had a mori with my name in it
---
You're way too salty over some clip of a show or whatever.
---
Hook camping isn't toxic, it's the job of a killer to kill you before you can genrush yourself out.
---
No, he said "I will be run over by an ambulance"
---
Unlike others on this post I think that while STBFL on legion may be able to stack quickly there's little point on running it since most survivors will be injured anyway and it doesn't really help while in frenzy
---
Sloppy butcher however may be worth it since, combined with thanata survivors will wind up wasting alot of their time either healing or suffering from thanataphobia
---
Legion isn't too good. They are annoying. Unless they are going to completely rework the power into something more useful for the killer and less annoying for survivors I don't really see anything happening.
---
*Laughs in bing bong*
---
Looks fine, id swap monitor for sloopy butcher, that synergizes better with thanatophobia
---
Thanks got to look more into stbfl. What do you think about nurses on legion?
---
you know you fucked up when you turn around and hear the **ching chong walla walla bing bong**
---
I usually only run franklins on any killer if I know it‚Äôs a swf and they all bring in items. I would do franklins, thana, Rubin or corrupt, and bbq.
---
Just take my up vote and be happy :v
---
This happens alot to me
---
On that same note tunneling isn't toxic, it's literally the Killers job to kill them quickly.
---
Lol ur stupid 1 person on a gen takes 80 SECONDS the time it takes to chase, grab and hook someone with a killer like pig who‚Äôs ability do‚Äôs to help in most chases is gonna screw u over and then u gotta play a guessing game of what gen there on ( unless bbq) and even then if that chase took 30 seconds including pickup and hook u still gotta walk over there and if u can prevent it, guess what? Two other survivors were on gens that entire time, boom 40% of the objective done
---
After one. Or after killer insta downed someone with addons. Not always, but often. Thanks for honesty, I hate myself as well, but I hate to waste my time even more. I play for fun and playing against this isn't.
---
Damn it, guess I should have read the comments before saying the same exact thing.
---
Its essentially bollocks, her shards get slightly brighter when she phases, its unoticable unless your very close to her.
---
How was this even done? I thought getting two killers in kyf required a full lobby?
---
Congrats on hot posts!
---
Hey bitter murmur is solid tho
---
People dont want positive comments
---
Got any comparisons with other stuff?
---
It‚Äôs patched but when the stranger things chapter first came out, it was easy
---
Could be worse, could baby in the hole.
---
It stops them from interacting with a gen that they're about to start interacting with, thus slowing down the game. Unless there's a gen literally right next to it that wasn't blocked, they'll have to wait it out or find another gen, which is game slowdown. It's slowdown + tracking.
---
Hatch in that situation is so rare. I shall wiggle for thy points any day
---
today it does 15% plus two skill checks during that 15% that add an extra 5% each for a total of 25%, if you were wondering about the specifics
---
Too many hazbin memes
---
No, The Who is the next killer.
---
You don't have to feign surprise. Come out of the locker, bro.
---
Rule 34, my friend. If it exists, there's porn of it.
---
The killer gave me the hatch yesterday and I didn't wiggle until he was standing on it and didn't know how to drop me. Thankfully he didn't take it the wrong way üòÇ
---
I started playing solo survivor and reached rank 1 without any experience when the quests started - there are still goodloops in game that are unmindgameable, average gen speeds without ruin is 59 seconds solo, you can get a key and escape with no chances otherwise (ex. 3 gen doc or trapper) 
---
In 2016 nobody was able to play correctly and the people who did abused the game to insanity - seeing how you say it was survivor SIDED and not survivor powercreep is laughable
---
Sloppy Maiden sounds fun, Sloppy Fury sounds like something else entirely.
---
... Tickle torture ?
---
Serves you right, looper.
---
√©chap√©e belle
---
Better yet, get botany knowledge on the shrine. It‚Äôs currently 2k shards and will be there for a couple days
---
Camping is a strategy, and one that is fully countered by the Survivors just doing gens.
---
The only reason these bad killers camp as often as they do is because Survivors stupidly just rush in for the save or just stand nearby not doing anything hoping to get that save.
---
I mean, if Camping gets you the 4K, why not camp, amirite?
---
How do you down people while only moving in Frenzy?
---
DWIIIGHT!
---
But because of Legions base kit, like Plague, thana is usually a go to.
---
Congratulations and you ruin the game for other people which makes the game not which makes them not play the game
---
i went in thinking i was going to have to self sabo my teammates &amp; ended up looping the killer around dropping all the necessary pallets throughout the map while they genrushed. it was magnificent. i normally stick to objectives when i'm survivor, too, so i was extra surprised at myself lol
---
Adorable
---
Happens to me alot, so I wait for him to get out of position, down him and camp him unless it'll cause me to de pip. Perfectly fine with black piping to get toxic survivors üòÇ
---
Offense taken
---
Thank you!
---
Dedicated servers OP, dev's please nerf
---
The same way a little rubbing from a friend makes even the most grievous wounds disappear.
---
The animation could literally consist of a survivor stepping in a trap. It‚Äôs a kill animation. It doesn‚Äôt have to be 100% logical. By that logic you can say that almost all of the killers could conceal something and use it in their Mori. It doesn‚Äôt make nearly as much sense as you think it does.
---
So do you think the killer will be a big man or more slimmer and short?
---
[Guide: Hitbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
I stand in gates to waste a killers time if my teammates haven‚Äôt escaped yet. The more time a killer wastes looking at me is more time for other people to open the other gate.
---
&gt;urethral play
---
Nobody:
---
WolfeTheMind: It's called sounding.
---
Oh I definitely play more killer than I do survivor but I do play both sides for sure. I would say I‚Äôm doing like at good 80-20 percent. Killer being the 80. Recently I‚Äôve been doing survivor more because a buddy of mine just got into the game.
---
Happens in mobile too
---
I want to run this build for fun sometime and see what happens lmao
---
Neither, internet connection. When are people going to learn this?
---
Yeah its auto aim and its gets everyone.
---
They didn‚Äôt remove them from mine, I just can‚Äôt use them. I still have moon and low tier map offerings. They‚Äôre just not usable like the red envelopes and such.
---
Depending on your rank bracket, yes you can pip. If you only did gens and escaped, no killer interaction that‚Äôs Iridescent Lightbringer and Iridescent Unbroken. Depending on how much you were in the killers terror radius for your evader but that‚Äôs a safety no matter where you cut it. And if you heal one ally that‚Äôs enough benevolent to pip, so whatever.
---
If you want to kill one survivor I guess but your job is to kill all of them.
---
Killers and their extendo arms...

Me too, honestly

What‚Äôs that? You wanted to find BBQ on your bloodweb? Here, take Unrelenting instead.
---
It's not new it failed cuz it doesnt work. I remember when I used to do this to everyone as a joke
---
That map is a bitch to find the hatch on lol. But yeah, you missed the hatch as others have pointed out. 
---
The twist still made me chuckle. Have an upvote.
---
Moris are getting reworked as well
---
Macros save your keyboard from immense wear and tear from wiggling and spamming spacebar.
---
I use macros, but I have a corsair. You don't need to worry about 'timing.' Just create a maco, click record and spam adadadadad.
---
Then set it to "toggle" and "constant" It will play over and over and turn off and on when you press they key you bind it to.
---
Selecting "constant" is important, otherwise it will toggle on and only spam spacebar for the literal amount of times recorded in the macro. Constant allows it to loop.
---
This was happening to me all the time right after the last update, it felt way too close to the survivors. Like I had to push my chair back from the desk, that's how in your face they were. I'm glad they went back to the original camera angle
---
entity is tired of all the sweet williams
---
Usually 115% killers tend to be taller than survivors so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the new killer was tall. I doubt the new killer will be a 110%.
---
That seems pretty fucking tame compared to the rest.
---
I‚Äôve literally just put on a video of his to sleep to last night, wish he had faster uploads unless it‚Äôs affect his upload schedule.
---
if you think that's bad try putting up with dead hard when you "should've landed" a chainsaw hit, but someone pressed  ***E***
---
Everyone seems to have Greek God Immortality. They can get all messed up, but it's fine later.
---
Im my opini√≥n camping is only acceptable if there is one or more survivor is at the hook or it is right next to an exit gate after all 5 gens have been done
---
i would but i dont have patience ;)
---
What do you mean prestige? This is every time.
---
The WRAITH does not want Insidious, Entity!
---
What weapon do you think he will wield.
---
I feel like he's going to tell me about the risk of foot fungus in my Murder King Murders.
---
Yeah
---
It's toxic, but not on the Survivors' part. It's the devs.
---
"Uhhhhh, Feral Frenzy is now permanent. Solved."
---
I agree with you on the swf thing. I usually play spirit, but if 4-man swf enter my lobby I would change to wraith with enduring spirit fury built against them and eat all the pallets
---
Finding out a killer brought an all Hex perk build is always funny, especially when totems are just blowing up left and right. Nice art work!
---
I had to search for this again because I think it‚Äôs so good
---
Right, now it's a "Oh shit run!"
---
I was screaming at you the whole time after you passed over the hatch right away lol
---
I only ever got Leatherface offerings after I prestiged my Leatherface
---
It‚Äôs not toxic but oh Lordy is it frustrating to endure gens popping faster than you can do anything. Definitely a design issue given how ubiquitous and necessary Ruin is past Rank 15. And one that BHVR can‚Äôt just band aid fix by slapping on longer gen repair time.
---
It's not the servers, just an upcoming Ghostface buff! Having to chase down Survivors seemed like too much of a burden, so he's getting that time attribute people were seeing.
---
Tickle torture is the gateway drug of CBT.
---
Bringing rare addons and a mori isn‚Äôt ‚Äúscummy‚Äù. It‚Äôs literally built into the game. 
---
Also, if they want to advertise their twitch channel publicly in game, then why not give their viewers a great show? Up the difficulty a little bit :)
---
I'm not sure but I think distressing just applies to the base so a 32m killer with distressing and monitor would have a 48.32 terror radius
---
Finally, true balance. Now they just need to remove Ruin and NOED and actually all Killer perks and addons and the game will be perfect.
---
I really vibe with that.
---
Probably Billy first as a matter of red tape.
---
Right! Any sorta meme or fun build is always appreciated I feel like.
---
WOW...
---
Toxic people like that get their panties all in twist when they finally get hooked because they think they are big and bad. Like its the killers fault or the other survivors fault.
---
I have a corsair keyboard as well but it has no macro specific keys, probably set some through the keyboard software but would prefer to use my mouse software instead.
---
But it is though
---
Lmao thanks!
---
me too, but apparently it was a bug since consoles weren't like this and also it got reverted...
---
Any chance I can know what icon pack this is op? Looks really good.
---
It's not toxic but it's also not beneficial for survivors or killers. Most likely you won't get a pip or might even lose a pip if the trial is over too fast.
---
If you're new, Kindred might be more valuable than Dark Sense. Randoms knowing if anyone else is coming for you and if you're being camped improves your odds of being saved, or at least costing a camper the game.
---
Urban Evasion is fun, but sneaking isn't meta. I don't see anything better in your current list, but make that slot flexible, especially if you're unlocking Botany Knowledge soon.
---
There's also a slightly dated Otz video about Survivor perks.
---
Happy Clown‚Äôs simplistic colored pack
---
Still, eh?
---
Please do dumbify it more.
---
Dm me, I'll be a shoulder and friend.
---
Win two trials.
---
Must be done in one game.
---
Well, in that case, combined with it not actually giving more BP due to caps, it's almost worthless because it sabotages Monitor.
---
You go foward
---
Enemy go foward
---
You go foward a bit
---
Enemy goes foward more
---
You should have gone foward to the left or right
---
Wisely spoken.
---
It's not visible enough to be reliable.
---
P3 face Orange gardener shirt ( dont know the name ) and the science fair pants
---
the compliments my spirit cosmetic mix has been getting (Prestige bloody body, School girl short hair, hollowed blight event katana)
---
That‚Äôs an interesting way to spell ‚Äúnerf‚Äù
---
From what I hear the ptb is expected to be out this Tuesday. Thats not too long to at least see if you like the look of the killer
---
YOU CAN'T TURN OFF AUTOAIM!?
---
What dystopian nightmare is this?
---
  Leave it to the DBD Subreddit to complain about nothing
---
That‚Äôs toxic lol
---
Spirit has been addressed. The new Killers to complain about are Freddy and Billy.
---
I'm not seeing any Ghostface whining even though I wouldn't say he deserves a free location for being revealed.
---
I think your objective is to kill all survivors? I may be wrong tho
---
If you mean slugging one of the last two for four minutes while you look for the last one yea, you can do that. Don‚Äôt complain if people shit on your playstyle afterwards tho, cause there‚Äôs a human on the other side of that slugged survivors screen, that wanted to have fun, and laying on the ground while the killer chases your teammate to take away their last shot at survival so that their ego can be a little more inflated because they hit the dumb lady with their stick is not fun at all mate
---
You can chase survivors, hook them even, and regress other gens while survivors ‚Äògenrush‚Äô. Guess what we can do while you slug to find someone you didn‚Äôt even see? Stay on the ground.
---
Can the Leg's power be to kick 1/2/3 members of a SWF out of the pregame lobby?
---
why do I love some of these perks
---
I always had this headcanon that the entity also gave small buffs to survivors and not only killers otherwise they would literally faint the moment they end up on the hook, the way I see it, the entity made them a bit stronger than normal humans, just enough for them to not lose senses after getting smacked or not die instantly if on the ground or jumping from a high place
---
Pallet flashing. Although as a standing rule, babies tend to do toxic things by accident a lot.
---
Flashlighting a Killer while they're animation-locked to a pallet loses ground in a chase, so it's really only an act of spite.
---
Happened to me as well he blamed it on adrenaline bugged what he couldnt explained was how he zoomed through the map at 400% speed and ran in circles around me teasing me
---
You used a splinter
---
Well, that sucks, but as a Killer, you want more kills, right? Blaming slugging for being the way to get a 4K is like blaming genrushing for being the primary Survivor goal.
---
It's on the devs, not the players.
---
No, theyre completely different. If they‚Äôre teabagging at the gate, you push them out by hitting them and force them out. They either stay and get downed, or leave. The only choice survivors have when it comes to mori spam is to disconnect and lose any blood points they earned. The bleed out takes several minutes.
---
Another made up survivor placed restriction that killers are supposed to obey or else they get called bad by survivors that are shit at killer but yet act like the authority on what is good killer play. Just a guess I don't know either. I don't keep up with all the terms.
---
Right, I forgot using items is illegal for Killers.
---
For stealth : P3 clothes.
---
For style : glorious black waves or wild Violet waves, wild Violet jacket, and blackberry skirt
---
Just don't get caught and hooked by the killer, then downed again? It's not like that's the entire objective of playing survivor or anything...
---
Bro stop with this. This is the 6th time this has been posted
---
The Archived challenges might have caused the increase in ebony mori users as others said. I rarely bring those out but I did recently when I was tasked with making sure no one escapes. I wanted to just get it over with because I'm not the most brutal as a Killer. I often like to let the last person go.
---
Would you notice with some of them? Doctor tooling around at a speed he drops for shocking, Pig fast-crawling and probably still being slower than Ghostface, Trapper actually getting set up before the first gen, Legion actually getting to stab everyone...
---
Bloodlust Spirit and Freddy would turn things ugly pretty fast, though.
---
Evil Heritage
---
The sound design was always a mess, but I remember it breaking before. Apparently my Hillbilly had a silent chainsaw.
---
If survivors have to play a certain way to satisfy killers you should be looking at the devs.
---
But dead hard is supposed to prevent me from taking the hit no?
---
I personally like going out loud and proud, Jennipie hat, Brazil shirt, Science fair pants
---
I agree. Wish there was an avoid a teammate system like what Overwatch has. A maximum of three people and only valid for three days. It would really help to avoid sandbagging teammates without having to wait in queue for ten minutes again.
---
On PS4 the other day there was a pig that I ran for about one gen, my play style usually involves taking the heat (I‚Äôm a Jane main). So once I got off the hook I thought she was gonna come back and start chasing me again immediately, but for some reason she randomly became friendly and let us farm and slam multiple pallets on her. She even let me boop her nose :) 
---
Before I left I looked through a chest and found a rainbow map, but that pig definitely made me smile so before I left I booped her nose again and gave her the map. 
---
And that‚Äôs the story of the most toxic game of dead by daylight I‚Äôve ever had /s
---
Wait how do you cure yourself from insanity? I know you can snap out of it but how do you completely cite yourself?
---
The guy has no idea what he is talking about, he thinks escaping against spirit is him countering her.
---
Yeah. It‚Äôs a challenge that makes sense on paper, but now it‚Äôs frustrating for people who play a lot of survivor like myself and get mori‚Äôed every other game. It‚Äôs better just to get it out of the way
---
You can teabag at places other than the gate though why does that part not register with you?
---
Mori spam is the same as being trapped in a bully game. Your options are DC or AFK for several minutes, or just take abuse.
---
yeah that‚Äôs my point
---
Thanks!
---
Why even state this, it's true for both sides lmao
---
and we have a winner
---
what do you think of nurses, sloppy, thana, and ruin?
---
They won't ever fix the map design, so don't worry about it.
---
So if the Killer DCs, all Survivors should instantly black pip?
---
I‚Äôll wiggle if the killer‚Äôs been playing like an asshole all game and/ or I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs gonna give me hatch but rather close it in my face. It happens so much. Shit killers that only win because matchmaking puts me with rank 20s, it‚Äôs so annoying
---
It's a trash system. They'll work on it never because ranks don't matter.
---
Don't worry, the Claudette escaped through the hatch as well!
---
Tell that to OP
---
If they injured y bother with chainsaw?
---
Buff her Bear Traps so they're golden and shiny. Much more fashionable for Survivors to wear them; they won't want to remove them!
---
well actually i didn't said that he was hacking of some kind  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Should I go for a basement style match, or not worry about it?
---
people are used to have a warning before the killer gets there, so it's easy to get a free hit, and it's also easier to mind game with him, he also is a short killer that can crouch 
---
theoretically he should be mid tier but since the player base is humane he ends up being high tier, his stalk is just a plus
---
That would be a pretty nuanced tutorial that would only overwhelm new players. What's wrong with learning as they go?
---
I understand why they're testing the dedicated servers on live as opposed to PTB but there comes a point where enough is enough and you have to accept that your code needs more time in the oven.
---
You‚Äôre right nothing to scoff at but I can spend 30 seconds on a gen and get more than that done.
---
r/BrandNewSentence
---
Wow he's so funny... some people are just twats, born and raised
---
I can get behind this
---
How do ppl find gen rushing toxic? I mean... that's a survivor's main objective. Even if you increase the time it takes to complete generators, gen rushing is going to be a thing. Now, if you're letting other survivors die that could easily be unhooked so you can complete the generators, that's kind of toxic.
---
It feels good, doesn't it? I recently had a killer let me go because they liked my Kate cosmetics (biker top and bottoms, brown hair)
---
Can we once enjoy the meme without the "other side too does that"?
---
That‚Äôs not going to end every chase instantly, similarly to Spirit or Nurse. Even Freddy ends chases quicker than GhostFace with Dream Snares. Especially against loops that the survivor can see over, like an AutoHaven junk pile. 
---
- they have to constantly look back to see if he‚Äôs still behind them - unless a survivor is a potato they‚Äôll be looking behind themselves, regardless of the killer‚Äôs behaviour. Also, if there‚Äôs a clear LOS he‚Äôll get revealed easily.
---
Every community has toxic people, and dbd tends to amplify some of them. Not sure what you want us to do; the commenter is a shithead, but the most you can do is report him and move on.
---
I'm going for more of a museum here, round up round up, local headass on display
---
Cool motive; still name-and-shame.
---
What comments did I delete, idiot. None
---
If I‚Äôm the last survivor or there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôll be able to get out, I just give up 4/10 times they let me go,
---
*Babysitter in the Hole ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)*
---
No, wait, FBI I can explai-
---
His problem tbh. Shouldn't have hacked in a lobby with someone who can record the past.
---
He's still going, clearly I'm worth wasting all this precious time on xoxo ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
---
Its just skill dude
---
That nest of sadists and psychopaths is gone, as it should be.
---
Find a fitting Instagram filter then point it at your screen. Need to see scratches? Just check your colorblind radar. Problem solved, you bolorclinds can go back to reading braille now üôÑ
---
^^^/^^^s
---
I need to learn this one
---
I agree, having a tutorial on how to apply map pressure as a killer or how to not try to kobe everytime you get hooked could really help new players
---
also I would like a skill check simulator, the fan-site has lots of issues
---
I bought Spirit with Shards tho
---
Yep happens to me all the time on ps4
---
Bad manners
---
If they would be overwhelmed by the tutorial, then how would they feel in game? I feel that they need a way to learn in a controlled environment. I also just feel like the tutorials, while do get the job done, don't go in-depth on some aspects of the game that are usually frequent. Heck, maybe not even a tutorial, but maybe a coaching sytem?
---
You bring dishonor to Ace's everywhere
---
Seems like he wants your attention though, knowing you‚Äôre spending time on a poop museum could give him an even bigger hard-on
---
I did this with my friends and now there's an ancient sumerian demon floating in my living room, help?
---
You can't use items in tier 3 madness so probably not
---
Gotta get back 
---
Back to the shrine
---
Yamao-jack
---
Don't be.  OP is an overly dramatic clown.  Also Infinites don't exist.  They were removed from the game years ago.  Just a buzzword salty players like to throw around that don't know any better. 
---
Survivors been getting nerfed and rebalanced for well over a year.  It's never felt better playing killer than it does right now.  Again disregard salty OP and his rant and play the game again for yourself.  You'll be pleasantly surprised.
---
They learn as they go. Shoving all that info at them when they're barely familiar with the game would probably be way too much. People have been learning organically since launch, and I don't really see how that's a problem.
---
I don't think it could spell reddit, so thankfully the 12yr old stiffy remains unsucked
---
The free hit aspect of his character can still be negated by spine chill. Even so, being able to get a hit on a survivor isn‚Äôt possible all the time (unless you‚Äôre using certain add ons like I said). It still isn‚Äôt enough to make him a high tier killer, as he‚Äôs not going to be ending chases quickly. 
---
Also everything you described The Pig is able to do, but no one shrieks saying that she‚Äôs OP and needs nerfing.
---
- theoretically he should be mid tier but since the player base is humane he ends up being high tier, his stalk is just a plus - I don‚Äôt know why you mean by this.
---
Good
---
Yes killer and survivor should get black pip
---
Entity to Observer: *see man i told you, motherfuckers love that weird horse *
---
Gotta give it to him he's actually really good at this game
---
Or even better: when you select a challenge it automatically takes you to the survivor or killer screen depending on which rift challenge you selected
---
Thank you, that's super helpful actually.
---
Child running away from girl idk
---
These still look so horrible. There was a better way of going about this. Black fog.
---
We survive it because survivors are already dead
---
Run Sloppy and Nurses And two other perks (usually Thanitphobia and Ruin) and don‚Äôt stalk just use your power and hit people juggle people and keep people injured use Nurses to sneak back up on them and down them before they can loop since you have no TR and are switching targets survivors are to scared to do gens if you can down them on once chase fast then do it
---
Its nice seeing a fellow jeff main.
---
No game ever teaches you this, tutorials are to teach mechanics. They aren‚Äôt going to teach you to run loops optimally and so on. That‚Äôs up to the player
---
Nah, pretty calculated on Trapper's part.
---
Well the theory behind it is that you don‚Äôt get into chases. You hit a survivor, let them get away, and hopefully you‚Äôll catch them healing with Nurse‚Äô Calling. After that you sneak up on them with no terror radius and down them. For this to work you have to injure as many people as possible and use perks like Sloppy Butcher and/or Thanatophobia
---
This actually works REALLY well in my experience
---
That was a really bad pallet drop tbh, deserved a down
---
I thought he was gonna keep running lmfao
---
New map variation. It‚Äôs 90% confirmed.
---
It's not even so much the difference in controls, console players generally perform at a lower skill level. Not bashing them or anything, I attribute it to the game being out on consoles for much less time than PC, and I think consoles have more casual players than PC does, % wise.
---
This was awhile back but I had a buddy who was R1 survivor on console, only solo queueing, then switched to PC. He stalls at every pallet he found, never looped something once... You don't get to R1 on PC playing like that lol.
---
Of course I don't blame the community, I'm not this dude. But dbd does attract/breed these gross people who are too childish to understand sporting competitivity, and see the game as "us vs the other" whether the 'us' is killer or survivor. It makes for some really pathetic arguments, even right here on the reddit. I think it's something a lot of people have seen.
---
I really like her glowing orange one but I think you can‚Äôt get those anymore
---
Lmao. I died a little
---
What's toxic is that fact that gens are done too quickly for most killers to have a chance, especially when they're required to have Ruin and if it goes down quickly they're done.
---
Ah yes. The classic Russian Roulette build. I like running this on Spirit and pulling people off of the totems
---
* Images of characters, locations, gameplay elements and the like from other franchises that would make an interesting addition to the game (e.g. Silent Hill, The Evil Within, Child's Play/Chucky, IT, ...). These posts must be submitted as a fan-made concept, including at least two of the following things: character background story, teachable perks, killer power/ability, new unique gameplay mechanic (similar to Jigsaw Boxes, Bear Traps, ...), map concept art/layout/aesthetics.
---
Games are always like this. It doesn‚Äôt attract toxic people. Not gonna be like ‚Äúoooo this is the game for me bc I can abuse people post chat‚Äù. Every game has people like this. Not just games it‚Äôs real life, get used to it.
---
It'll get downvoted to shit and deleted but venting is venting whilst it lasts.
---
You can still buy the hallow eve's skins 2 weeks after this weeks rift closes
---
More like, Spine chill, keep calm, and crouch on.
---
I am a killer main but i have to be honest the change to mettle of man is more exiting than any killer
---
You didn‚Äôt wait long enough simple
---
Oh hey! That‚Äôs the cool apron one right? For Claudette with the glowing orange sap?
---
1500 is 1500. What do ya mean exposed, who cares, I got the blood points so pssh
---
2 years ago it was made rare.
---
Yep
---
where's the bottom half
---
Wraiths new skin?!
---
It‚Äôs not BS, they made it very clear on release you can get there
---
You know that Dark Sense challenge in the archives?
---
I managed to beat it on my first attempt, and our whole team still escaped.
---
Damn, it looked better :(
---
r/perfectlycutscreams
---
His ultimate technique, Ultimate Deep Pass OVERDRIVE
---
DBD‚Äôs had the exact same game mechanics for 3 years now. It‚Äôs not dying anytime soon. But I‚Äôd kill for different game objectives beyond this rift stuff.
---
Yeah, I gotta say that was some smart trap setting. That window can be a pain.
---
It‚Äôs no clip, no collision so you can‚Äôt do anything
---
Balanced landing on Myers house is still infinite. Climb out one side stand on roof wait for killer to follow then fall down run back up and jump out onto the other roof wait for him to follow then repeat while alternating between those two windows to prevent them from being blocked. I've faced it as killer and I've used it as survivor so I know it works
---
Yet in game, it makes you run faster instead.
---
I did it with Hag, it's hilarious.
---
Questions that don't have an answer:
---
1. What's the purpose of life?
---
2. Will we ever be able to move to another galaxy?
---
3. Why are Monstrous Shine and Insidious Very Rare perks?
---
why the long face
---
I‚Äôm on your side buddy :D
---
How dare survivors try to escape as fast as possible 
---
Also killers should stop trying to kill everyone as fast as possible, that‚Äôs kill rushing!!!!!
---
You used splinter, only dodgy thing is trapper, not a big deal
---
Right! I need to try this on her!
---
coming from someone that runs spine chill, barely anyone runs it, also even if you run it as long as you don't stare directly at the survivor running it (ie. look around for other survivors while using shroud, wich is a good habit to pick) you will still get a hit, that logic is even worse than saying spirit is not good because you can run iron will and spine chill
---
pig **can** do the same as a described, but 10x worse, you move slower than a survivor while crouching, you have a loud noise if you use your dash AND when you crouch up, her mindgame potential is shit compared to ghostface as her TR don't disappear instantly, missing her dash garantees the survivor can run away and she can't attack instantly after crouching
---
as GF you show up, get a free hit 80% of the time, chase until you have your power back or get a down, got a down? good, you just did the same as a wraith with some of his best addons (ghost with silent bell), didn't got one? you go away with your power and the survivor either heals wich takes time, specially with sloppy/thana or he/she risks a free down, reavealling is also buggy and depending on the patch you either remove the shroud staring at a wall on the other side of the map or can't get reavealled by the survivor you are chased
---
I never complained he was op, you asked why he is high tier and I answered, what I meant with my comment is that he can exploit mistakes so easly it makes him good, people are used to terror radious before chase and red stain in chase, both of wich he negates with his power
---
Firstly, I play GhostFace more than I do any other killer. Secondly, there is a mindgame. A mindgame is when both sides have a fair chance at doing better than the other. Unlike Spirit‚Äôs case, where she should always come out on top because of the advantages she has over the survivor. That‚Äôs why people use the word ‚Äòmindgames‚Äô in quotation when referencing it. The results are in his favour, but not all the time. If the survivor can‚Äôt see him then yes he‚Äôll most likely win, but if they can then it barely matters. Also, what world do you live in where most loops are insanely hard against him? The survivor can still win the mindgame. Also, I perform very well as him against good survivors, but it‚Äôs not like you can end chases instantly. Maybe if you have recovery add ons you‚Äôll be able to do it more often, but it‚Äôs not like they have no chance of winning.

- Also, making assumptions about the way I play doesn‚Äôt make your point look any stronger.

And I have played those all 3 years. It took them this long to balance out the chase part of the game while keeping up the fresher content. Generators will be altered in near future. The time is coming, players over 1500 hours have mastered the objective part and it needs a reboot in upcoming year.
---
I couldn‚Äôt decide if I wanted to go full comedy or vaguely realistic and ended up in a weird middle-zone of conceptually interesting but unbalanced perks and some that are just out there.
---
Yeah but there's no good players there.
---
how is it useless now is one of the most defining addons you can use, dont tell me you've been using BNP for the first gen i dont know what to tell you.
---
BNP is a wonderful addon it can clutch a game if survivors 3 gen themselves it can complete a 70% gen is just 2 skillchecks
---
Truth. I made a whole essay about why the Memories sucked because there were so many pauses (that weren't even read by the narrator) but the first Entity entry was written and read much better.
---
Finally someone agrees with me &lt;3
---
Or you could go outside for a few hours a day and not try to be the fun police.
---
Survivor bad killer good
---
No they cant a piece of shit one time a piece of shit forever
---
correct.
---
Saying GF is mid tier leads to that assumption. I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre just a troll. ‚Äú I perform very well against good survivors‚Äù, yet he‚Äôs mid tier?? Your points don‚Äôt make sense. There is no mindgame when in shroud, there is no red glow therefore it‚Äôs a guess on what way he‚Äôs going. Soon as you see him it‚Äôs too late to run it optimally depending on loops, most jungle gyms you‚Äôre fucked. Spirit shouldn‚Äôt always come on top btw, especially if no strider going against iron will.
---
We need more emotes
---
Will sticking a cross hair or something similar on my screen help if I change camera angle up or down?

it really is, sure hope not idiot.

Literally

This is what nightmares are made of
---
I don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre acting like getting hits are the be all and end all for killers. He is very good at getting hits, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs strong. It still won‚Äôt end chases quickly. I use Night Shroud often to try to trick survivors but it doesn‚Äôt work often at high rank.
---
Yes, it just tastes like paper or a Polaroid
---
He wasn't hacking. He just had a better rgb mouse than you
---
My last 6 games it‚Äôs ended the game immediately. The fact that ruin stops people for doing anything still is mind blowing to me.
---
Impossible.
---
Sound like tru3twat, wonder if you will call every counter point mental gymnastics
---
That'll just flood the bottom ranks with sweaty entitled quitters.
---
Had anyone noticed that 13 rank image is the killer one?
---
Demos lunges doesn't stop it'll keep going and hit you once dead hard was over anyways. Works that way with Sprint burst and balanced as well so it's true you dodge the hit but once dead hard technically stops if demos still in lunge you'll get smacked on the ass anyways
---
Seriously... this is your fault. Always take out the weak links first.
---
Like any other unintended mechanics or exploit, yes.

[Subreddit Update - Rule 8: Oversaturated Content Addition - Tier Lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dr1zmk/subreddit_update_rule_8_oversaturated_content/)
---
No, there was sprint burst bug months back where you crouch hold shift then just run and it doesn‚Äôt use it. No one got banned even with salty streamers reporting
---
Still no reason to be a dick just because someone is streaming.
---
No tier lists please..
---
Master her, patrol then tunnel first. Then have fun with others. If you see them waste med kit on injured wait for 8 seconds then hit. If you see them use med kit on downed wait 16 seconds then hit. If one unhooks inside your terror radius wait 16 seconds then hit. Wait out decisive strike and hook again. On second stage don't let then escape without exchanging. Hook the one who got downed but also remember where first went. If you have trouble finding survivors then let the downed lay on the ground and follow hooked one. It's impossible to get 4k without camping (slight or strong) on huntress.  Enjoy the results and angry survivor mains about camping you. Every experienced red rank survivor knows if the killer camps and tunnels then he plays to win. Nothing personal
---
&gt; Just utilise the usual technique against camping killers - do gens. 
---
It wasn't the point of my comment and the post, but ok.
---
&gt; She definitely doesn't need nerfing lol. 
---
If you think I asked for Hag nerf by saying entity shouldn't allow killers to put traps within 16 meters of the hooked survivor, you are wrong my dude. I can agree the it seems to be a nerf (kinda), but it won't affect Hag only (Trapper, Freddy, Demogorgon etc.)
---
&gt; I mean you then have a Hag with 5 traps across the entire rest of the map, and so will be incredibly easy to loop 
---
It is obvious and you said it yourself: just do gens if the killer is camping. You are right about it, survivors should do gens. I am not arguing against it, but if you just do gens most likely you'll be able to finish all 5 by the time first survivor dies, so you can open the door and escape (it is possible in theory). There should not be any more chase. But do you think that is what's gonna happen? I mean I've seen a lot of survivors doing fuck all, and waiting by the hook, even though they clearly saw the killer is camping. Some of them were even red rank survivors (I don't say everyone does fuck all, but I've seen couple). At least one of your teammates will do fuck all, run at you, get downed by the camping killer (it doesn't matter if it's Hag or someone else), someone else will try to save you, and eventually killer will down everyone and get a 4k. This happens to me 99% of the time, if the killer is camping. Espacially when I am playing solo.
---
Hag can camp too. But if you are going to camp, what is the point of putting 5+ traps there? I said it before, and I'll say it again. It is pointless.
---
To me only after the gates are open, that‚Äôs the only way to guarantee a kill, otherwise, you are just making it really unfun for the other side
---
Give killer "insert new spine" mori
---
Don‚Äôt mention keys if you aren‚Äôt going to mention Moris bud bud
---
Then you‚Äôre stupid
---
If camping is a strategy, anything's a strategy, gen rush is a strategy! tunneling is a strategy! Say what you want, but all that toxic shit isn't enjoyable
---
Sounds like you don‚Äôt get it and you‚Äôre salty abt it lmao
---
Where was your fucking team‚Äô!
---
B-But.. survivor bad..
---
Yeah your probably right
---
I have to sweat so much to kill strong survivors, it doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs a strong killer. No Ruin or a 4 Man means I won‚Äôt do well, unlike Nurse and Spirit. 
---
There is still a mindgame. The fact that there‚Äôs no red stain doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs impossible for survivors to loop him. They‚Äôre not guessing where he‚Äôs going because they can still see him. Also, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre assuming that Night Shroud is always available to him. You get a free hit on a survivor and what then? You‚Äôre left with nothing your ability has to help you end chases quickly. He‚Äòs heavily reliant on Chewed Pen and Olsen‚Äôs Address Book to help him perform well.
---
I mori‚Äôd someone with Ghostface and immediately got messaged three times in a row and thought ‚Äúo fuck‚Äù but they complimented me on being a good killer instead and I offered to help them with Rift challenges. Felt really good to have a nice exchange with someone.
---
The number of killer mains bending over backwards to justify their shitty plays is astounding. 
---
People, while you camp and stand there like an idiot not doing anything, four other people are bored out of their minds. The one on the hook just spams ether M1 or space to give their team time, and the others are holding M1 getting the gens done. It‚Äôs BORING, that‚Äôs why people hate it, not because it grants you a kill but because it sucks the fun out of the game for everyone. Ffs, 2019 and we still have to explain this shit
---
Edit: typo
---
This looks pretty cool actually. Looks a bit more.. dynamic.
---
Although my preference would be the lobby is everyone at the campfire since their animations are more unique there.
---
No reason for the streamer to be a dick just because their streaming.
---
Don‚Äôt talk balance if you‚Äôre talking abt 4 mans. They are guessing, if they can mindgame it they‚Äôre guessing as there is no mindgame in shroud. I think you‚Äôre a bit lost
---
Don't BL and I think urban have Nea's face
---
What a fucking chad wearing monochrome menace
---
Teacher: the test isn't that bad
---
*The test*:
---
I had a Dwight do it once in a full SWF. He'd only turn it on after being hit so I could always hit once, but never down.
---
You‚Äôre actually a complete and utter clown. Read all of what I said, oh my goodness. There is no way GhostFace is a high tier killer. No way at all. I
---
He uses Stalk as more of a detection ability than using it to insta down anyone.
---
Kiss me, homie
---
Legion as a bunch of compys
---
I used 4 mans as an example because my initial post talks about him being a high tier killer. Nurse and Spirit do well against 4 mans, ghosty boi doesn‚Äôt.
---
If gen rushing isn't toxic, then neither is bringing NOED as it's the killer's job to kill.
---
You cant channel it but you can escape trou hatch
---
Construct
---
Yeah moris are op af as well. Being able to be unhooked and then immediately killed off is bullshit. Even ds can't save you
---
Most of the challenges have either the survivor or the killer symbol. It would decided based on that
---
But my point is that some apply to both
---
Isn't mad grit literally Legion holding his hands in front of his face
---
Also there is a rule against non gameplay tierlists.
---
I'd bet but I could feel the hate coming from them! Thought they would give ya hate
---
They didn't want to cleanse and give her Corrupt.
---
Because I wouldve been able to vault the pallet *like so* and then loop them around it
---
Same I was waiting for a DC or a message saying ''TRASH'' xD
---
Didn't realize how salty other killer mains are at this idea. I play killer a lot,  "gen rushing" is just something salty killer mains made up. If gen rushing means the survivors are ignoring teamates and totems to do gens that should be a good thing for killers right? It's bad if you facecamp and they ignore that teammate to do gens, but if you don't facecamp, the other definition of gen rushing is straight up beneficial to killers, I think.
---
But it still shows up on my blood web even if I have it
---
Because it‚Äôs completely illogical that he could grab one nearby. You‚Äôre taking it FAR too seriously. It‚Äôs an animation. Not a book or movie that needs its continuity to make sense.
---
getting easy hit is exactly how stealth killers are played, he is a hit and run killer, wich forces you to heal if you are not in a good spot, shroud does not garantee you get a hit in a chase, but at worse is a free moonwalk, wich still can cut a loop or 2 out of a good pallet (not on every loop but most). I'm too am at red ranks and his power works wonders, he is at worse a harder to loop plague if you play him well, if he is your most played killer and you still think he is mid tier I recommend you playing a 32m TR non stealth killer and see the difference that a free hit makes
---
No Mither also counters Make Your Choice, NOED, Haunted Grounds, Billy‚Äôs Chainsaw, Leatherface‚Äôs Chainsaw, Tier 3 Myers and much, much more.
---
I didn‚Äôt say to use no perks on him, obviously he‚Äôll do shit. The point is, Tru3 uses a very strong build on him and has suddenly convinced himself and a lot of his following that GhostFace is the 2nd or 3rd best killer. Use any strong build and it‚Äôs obvious that you‚Äôll dominate.
---
That's what I was expecting to
---
Lol I actually do draw the plague but her headress is the bane of my existence. It's so detailed
---
Running away from a killer is an exploit?
---
This was all just hypothetical. If this feature was for some reason added, you most likely wouldn‚Äôt immediately start queuing for a match. So if you wanted to be a killer instead of a survivor or vice versa, then you could switch out
---
Thank you! I'm definitely hoping the new killer is "The Samurai"
---
Legion is my favorite killer but yeah they really need some sort of buff
---
Would have been interesting if they stabbed some shit out of Jeff and got both of them transported to the entity.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a weird thing, hearing a distant chainsaw irl and having my whole body and mind shift into survival mode, only to remind myself it‚Äôs just some bloke chopping a tree. I gotta play this game less lol
---
Then you remember it also gives them a movement speed bonus.
---
Saying that is ignorant no offense, but you shouldn‚Äôt deny people the ability to change
---
I can second this
---
Lmao this was so me last night for about five games in a row.
---
Legion needs a rework. Honestly he's kind of boring design wise
---
Who watches the Watcher?

Sounds like you got farmed and you mad as hell about it üòÑ ROFL!
---
Other players disconnecting any time something doesn't go their way.
---
So you have chosen death
---
Does this happen on loading screens? I know this occurs on PS4, and I‚Äôve heard that FPS are uncapped on those screens. Dunno if it applies to PC, but my machine sounds like it‚Äôs going to space.
---
play wraith with the addon that makes his cloak have TR with the ghost addon and insidious/dark devotion for **CHAOS**
---
I would like to see a kanab≈ç. Katana would be cool as well!
---
And Franklin's demise
---
Oh man u gotta post one I wanna see after seeing the spirit I think u r talking ur skills way to far down ur drawing is awsome
---
Yeah because playing on controller is so much harder!  At red ranks on ps4 there‚Äôs honestly not that much of a difference in terms of skill level and mindgames.
---
Nurses synchronizes well with both sloppy and thana! Good build for wraith, GF, plague and legion!
---
Lag
---
Then I'm happy for you! I wish I had the same experience but Mines been horrid.
---
What??
---
You monster!
---
How did that work out for you
---
Well this is an amazing glitch, this comment was made on a completely different post.
---
Nope they will just listen to bad survivors and nerf any one thats not an easy win.
---
I got BHVR'd
---
Yea I was gonna say LMAO

Ooo we really are gonna have a shugoki with that weapon, if he did have that weapon what type of mori should he have.
---
NIG-
---
Sorry I'm not like rank 1 like all you scrubs lmao
---
Just a dumb meme I had in my head for a while and finally decided to not be lazy and actually record and edit it (instead of just playing DBD / streaming)
---
Get an Ethernet cable it‚Äôs gonna fix your problems
---
Yes, it just relies on the team being close together. But I‚Äôm biased so
---
Yeah wut?
---
Every game recently... I've got to heal health states just stay still, especially when  you see the killer going completely the opposite direction.
---
Quality meme
---
**sees mematic water mark**
---
Well hoarding BP is impossible since there is a limit, so if you don't spend them you won't gain more.
---
If you don't use the items what's the point of them? Just use what you want and spend your BP as you see fit, it doesn't take long to gain more anyway.
---
Isn't it spam to repost this shit again and again?
---
Ever since I noticed how good Wraith is to counter borrowed time I haven't seen a single one. I always imagine their reaction when I smack the guy getting farmed right after he is off the hook.
---
1440x1080 if I remember correctly.
---
Yeah, true, the game in itself is fun, but goofing around can be so refreshing from the usual toxicity :)
---
I personally don't bring items unless it's required for something. Otherwise I only use items from chests because I as a killer dodge games where survivors use multiple toolboxes or items. But I think it's fine for people to use items when they open chests. I use offering every game unless I only have map offerings.
---
Just hook meg, Jake, Claudette and dwights a bunch. :-)
---
Unpopular opinion: I secretly love her ugly shiny silver man-whore dress
---
Would be cool, but I think they have to fix other things first ..
---
I believe you kill each of the original survivors 40 times
---
Ya i know i just wanted to see the reactions
---
Plus he had Decisive and Unbreakable, so...I already guess how that round really went
---
Thsts why you almost never pip with mori, butbi agree maybe after 2 hooks it would be better and idk add a timer for when they can get morid idk
---
Thanks, I appreciate it!
---
Unless you‚Äôre in my case, In which I got repetitive lag switching, camping, or tunneling and depipped so far that I went to rank 13 after the reset, and now I can‚Äôt rank up because all the rank 20 killers camp and the rank 20 survivors are devout to get a save
---
I thought it was hooking each of them 25 times.
---
Huh, only ever had it happen in reverse where I hit the survivor and THEN haunted pops right after
---
You thought I was a Hex: Ruin... but it was I! Hex: Haunted ground !

I hate to sound like an entitled survivor but moris are just fucking stupid
---
So you downvoted me? I‚Äôm just saying that‚Äôs all I know abt it. If anything it‚Äôs harder to get protection hits now
---
You are what I strive to be
---
Because they think they're to good to M1...
---
The sad thing is, I don't have Infectious Fright. Which is why I'm going with brutal.
---
Supposed to get some add on changes or buffs. The pin addons supposedly wont require 2 hits to apply. That's what they said about 2 months ago in stream that they were looking into. But that was 2 months ago so yea...
---
That‚Äôs probably right
---
You do realize he was reworked right? Get with the times, he takes as much skill as any m1 killer.
---
Never once I said he overperformed, no shit, only spirit is overperforming right now, it looks like you want to convince people that he is mid-tier out of fear of a nerf instead of trying to put on his place on the tier list, but the no-heal build just needs perks, you can even use it with no addons and do well, also you can still capitalise on heals without it, I personally like surge/surveillance/thrilling tremors/sloppy, ruin or pop depending on the addons
---
Honestly the way you were talking is no different than anyone actually serious about their opinions. Thanks for the insult though and have a great day
---
You have to kill Claudette 25 times
---
They wont add legacy ever again thats just the chapters name
---
Im a 4head
---
Depends on the map and how fast you find the first person. If you find one quick enough you can find the genrushers and make them mend
---
My Legion build I use at rank 1 is
---
Thrilling Tremors / Pop Goes the Weasel / Hex: Ruin / Sloppy Butcher
---
Well stop calling them infinites, and learn when to break off chase.

No tier lists

His power hides his terror radius and red stain so mid chase you can use it instead of trying to hide your light and get a hit.
---
Vomie mommy

No people have just been complaining a lot recently about ‚ÄúForever Freddy‚Äù and most people follow the crowd. Even if they don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre complaining about they‚Äôll complain anyways because it‚Äôs the thing to do. He was salty and just blamed it on the killer.
---
I have all of those except for Thanataphobia
---
THRILL OF THE HUNT ISNT A PURPLE HEX
---
Damnit, I knew I had messed something up
---
Yeah issue with that it‚Äôs situational asf now and not worth bringing into a game when you can use a mechanical toolbox with add on. BNP isn‚Äôt worth the 8k bp and overall doesn‚Äôt do shit in the end.
---
Bloodlusting can still be avoided with enough skill and mind gaming. Old Frenzy stabs were too fast and with no punishment for missing the legion could just spam the attack until it landed. Atleast with a basic attack there‚Äôs the momentary slow and  ‚Äúcooldown‚Äù for missed attacks. Yes there‚Äôs a PERK to reduce that cooldown but still. I‚Äôm not saying NEW legion is an issue, The killer is great now and actually fun to play against. But complaining that you can‚Äôt multi-stab anymore, to me atleast, just seems ignorant. Old legion was bad for the game, there‚Äôs no real way around it.
---
Plot twist: the killer is also Claudette
---
Not every match needs to be a pimple inducing sweat fest. Learn to have some fun every once in a while.
---
The Hillbilly's nerf is going to make it so his chainsaw sprint is at a set duration. Then some add ons will be changed to increase the duration of his power. =/
---
Sometimes I'll do that, then take them to a gate instead, let them open it, down them again and pretend like I'm taking them to a hook before turning around and letting them go.
---
Keep them guessing till the end.
---
It‚Äôs called the objective. One of the killers jobs is not taking advantage of the game, and most killers who run noed just slug anyway as to not let anyone escape.
---
That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a teaser....
---
Triggered? It's the combination and not using one of them.
---
Iridescent Head is OP, especially with additional hatchets.
---
Pink Mori is OP. And tunneling is for noobs and the combination with Mori is very uncool. And then using Iridescent Head is very toxic and there is no way to disagree
---
yep pretty much
---
Very much agree
---
As I literally just said, people have different ideas of fun.
---
I‚Äôm really excited about the new chapter myself. It‚Äôs awesome to me that they‚Äôre expanding in current lore with the new chapter. The killer will still probably be very different from Spirit. That remains to be seen but I don‚Äôt see why they would just add another Spirit.
---
No one knows what it's like...
---
And their is zero counter play to Survivors on coms. There is no counter play to survivers who DC if you hit them first.  Since you are bringing up no counter play to things. My point is no one is going to stop playing how they want. There are things in this game that you can't control. I could not tell you how many survivor games I got killed from DCing.
---
My favourite is either climate change or the ‚Äúbe better‚Äù one
---
Plagues a lot better honestly and has a more interesting playstyle.  I also kind of dig the fact that survivors give her games two radically different feels and playstyles depending on if they know not to cleanse or not.  You either get to play as a Devour Hope Killer the full game OR you get to rock a machine gun and just unload on everyone from afar.  Makes her feel unique imo.
---
1/4 games maybe at rank 3
---
*Thrill of the Hunt and Devour Hope explode*
---
Oh no
---
Killer: has ruin
---
Me: stupid killer, relies on crutch perk
---
Killer: doesn‚Äôt have ruin
---
Me: stupid killer, get genrushed scrub
---
And that‚Äôs why I actually understand why killers use ruin.
---
The term might not be the same as before, but it still exists. Just because the extent of it changed does not mean the term is nonexistent. 
---
Genrushing is still a thing. You can simply ignore everything in the game, altruism, totems, sabotages etc. and rush gens without doing any other things you can do in this game.
---
Is it toxic? No, not really. But it is a playstyle that will net you a lot less bloodpoints than when you actually play the game to its fullest extent, and it is a playstyle that makes matches really boring. You can look at the same situation from the killers point of view: tunelling and camping are literally just ways to secure kills, which is the killers job, but it is still frowned upon and called "toxic". 
---
There is a reason why we have different categories than "Objective" on the Emblems, and people like playing longer games than just finishing the objective ASAP and getting out.
---
It‚Äôs not difficult at all since you only need to complete them, not repair them entirely.
---
Than is his most important perk.  Funny enough it's strong on Plague too.  I'd level up your Nurse for it asap.  It's good to have.
---
A gen takes 80 seconds bruv, Lets say you need 25 seconds to find someone, which is kinda fast-ish, 10 seconds to get the first hit, which is fast, another 20 seconds to get the second hit which is very fast, pick up and get them to the hook 15 seconds which makes 70 seconds, and that is a pretty good chase all things considered, and 3 gens pop (:
---
Damn, I would say go for Legion then but Thanataphobia is as crucial as Sloppy for legion... even on Plague it‚Äôs crucial
---
The struggle
---
Let me take a bow while I accept my trophy
---
Totems are also called "the objective". So do them. 
---
&gt;and most killers who run noed just slug anyway as to not let anyone escape.
---
Which is literally one of the biggest point bonuses in Deviousness, and one of the killers job as well
---
I did the same thing, except I didn't do it first time.
---
I did 4 whole matches focusing on completing it, finally did it, just to realize I needed dark sense equipped.
---
Fortunately my next match I told the survivors in pre game what happened and they 99% all of the gens for me.
---
Creativity is hard.
---
Hey at least they're not wearing the P3 outfit.
---
I had a survivor teabagging me last night, luckily I was able to hook and kill him early on so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with it. Hate toxic survivors, I always try to be friendly as survivor.
---
Moris should require the survivor to be on dead hook.
---
Keys should close the hatch behind the person using it.
---
Gotta start somewhere! Stay strong!
---
Idk do you get them to use them or to hoard them
---
No? It seems like a double edged sword. Tou get to see them but they also get ro see you.
---
Posted about it earlier because foolish me didn't realize there was a day of the week post for these. 
---
First game I was playing Wraith and hooked a Meg pretty early, did a loop to the three nearest gens and kicking/ checking them. By the time I was on the last one she was unhooked and I ran back to see if I could pick up the trail. What do I see, but a conga line of Megs, a Nea, and a Feng crouching away and then waiting in line as each slow vaulted the window. It was like watching a national geographic documentary..... it was beautiful.
---
Next game of note I was playing the Game, Wrath again, and headed for the farthest gen which was the bathroom gen. Walk in, start uncloaking and three survivors drop down through the hole in the ceiling. Survivor/ Killer stare off for solid thirty seconds.....I walk out the room and give them ten seconds to disperse. Come back, one run's past, gets smacked, second one's working gen also gets smacked, and thirds working the dull totem also hit. Second survivor accidentally sandbags the first by blocking the door so number three goes down and then I quickly down the second survivor. Both are hooked in the basement, do a loop of the nearest gens and I hear a grunt of pain. Watch as first survivor, Meg slowly walks down the stairs to the hooks. Uncloak and due to bad timing on their part I get them all and re-hook them. Cue me laughing maniacally, I turn and head off to get last survivor, but stop as Detective Tapp stands there and just lays his medkit down. Realize I am the bad guy in this scenario abusing poor baby survivors. Let them all go and screw around for five minutes looking at the map details. Survivors escape, look at ranks, (I'm 16 by the way), they were all rank 12-10..........I love this game.

Yes. Check the wiki. https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Spine_Chill

If you scroll down and click on "affected interaction speeds" it includes 6% increased vaulting speed, among many other things.

If we go down, we go down together.

I‚Äôd rather spend 2k shards for a single perk than 800k+ bloodpoints, to each their own though ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I mean... What can they really Nerf? The speed? Maybe adding a cooldown as insignificant as nurses?
---
Well brutal is still a good substitute
---
My main build on spirit is ruin, trill of the hunt, haunted grounds, and barbecue and chilli. Its pretty fun.
---
????????
---
Camp each original survivor 25 times as Leatherface
---
I was looking at the meme and then got a notification of the exact same meme.
---
Balanced Landing and Spine Chill are already really good perks, as for the other two, iron will can heal if you wanna be more stealthy. I'd also suggest either bond or some healing perk to help you get healed (bond to help you find survs who can heal you, self care is good for beguinners, etc)
---
What else can you do? There are no gens to protect.
---

*5 generators remaining*
---
Oh, now I understand
---
I get weary about bringing items. Often I‚Äôm doing a healing challenge (or I just want to do a unique heal others/sustain healing build) and I make a healing build with a decent med-kit to go with it and really heal those teammates, only one with an item in the lobby. PS4 killers: brings Frankie‚Äôs anyway, negating almost my entire build because why not. Console killers also lobby dodge very often in my experience if they don‚Äôt like that they see too many items. 
---
So I guess I‚Äôll behave and bring nothing for the killer just for them to bring insta-saw/iri-head/prayer bead + mori. Yeeyyyyy.
---
You say that when you get downvoted, i think most of us know you did it to troll

You can definitely combo it, it makes it absolutely hilarious speed wise

Goodbye TOTH, DH, and Ruin right as I chase Nea off of cleansing the Haunted Grounds totem.
---
That a new dlc? Will see what comes with that definitely
---
Thanks, do you know what the name of attack is? Like what it says on the right where you get the deviousness points
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not camping, following scratch marks to a hook is not camping imo. It is frustrating from the survivors POV (and in guessing yours too cause the blood points must have been shit) but yea, you did what you had to
---
I mean camping when someone just l...stays...either looking at you or running in relatively tight circles around you, not trying to find someone coming to the rescue even, just preventing you from getting saved. I had a huntress (idk what happened, she was like us purple rank but I am a potato and still ran her a lot) that refused to let me go even after three gens popped while she was chasing me. Downed me when the last two remained, hooked me and the previous to last one popped. There was still one gen left, she camped me running circles around me, and even when one of my teammates came to allow her an easy hit/down, she still wouldn‚Äôt let me go.
---
They popped the last gen and unhooked me, I got adrenaline but downed with NoED. This is the kind of players I hate, because they got angry because the game didn‚Äôt go like they wanted, and they threw a tantrum by refusing to engage in normal play
---
With NoED she could have easily downed at least one more teammate of mine, but nah, ‚Äúpunishing‚Äù the meg for trying to survive was more important. The fuck
---
Free 15% isn‚Äôt it?
---
I've actually taken to doing this with my huntress devour hope ruin and lullaby.
---
 So as long as I get decent spawn placements which I rarely do but I slow them down at least
---
You get to see the killer AT WILL, making call to your friends, and removing mindgames on loops with walls since survivors will always move the opposite way you do anyway. Also, completely removes stealth killers from the game if used correctly. 
---
Its like watching a live stream of the killer while on the same game as him.
---
The last time I saw a gen-rushing complaint was when Wake Up! Was bugged.
---
That has to be a hitbox hack. I'd rather have the shitty aim assist than that.

I once had a match as Legion with just Thrill of the Hunt at Red Rank. 
---
It was the old prenerf Legion, so I just spammed Frenzy attacks when they tried to bodyblock cleanse it. They musta spent almost 10 minutes coordinatedly trying to cleanse it while we sat at 5 gens. 
---
I don't think I've ever laughed so much at this game.
---
Until you realize it's a totem grabbing spirit.
---
Still looking for people to play with? Solo survivor has been tough lately. I can add you if you want to play sometime.
---
ugh you‚Äôre so smart. i love this
---
No one : 
---
Some people who try to reason with the meme when you‚Äôre clearly supposed not to:
---
Silent Stab
---
It's actually a bug. I used BL and the speed got stuck permanently until I used BL again. Killer reported me and I was scared about the ban but nothing happened.
---
Bro I wish i could find ppl like this
---
This is ridiculous, killers shouldn't be allowed to use their power or even move before at least 4 gens are done. And they can't hook anyone bc that's camping
---
Looping is not an exploit and facecamping means you‚Äôre more likely to lose the game
---
But you see, it‚Äôs not. DbD is about as casual as Siege would be, if doing well in a casual lobby got you thrown into a ranked match with gold 1 players.
---
Been wondering this for a while, what the hell is a fog Whisperer?
---
this is so fucking low effort and unfunny
---
I forgot this song existed
---
Yeah I'm whining about playing optimally in a perfect balanced game.
---
Toolboxes are good, but it's just about a few seconds benefit and yes it's too strong when all 4 have one.
---
Keys are strong, but it depends on how many already died and how many gens are done. The most annoying for me is when 3 gens are done, 2 survivor are dead and the last two escape through the hatch. In my opinion they should do something, but I don't have a solution and don't want a nerf like the Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe got. Yes the Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe and the Styptic Agent were too strong, but the Anti-Hemorrhagic Syringe is now too weak.
---
In my opinion DS is not for noob survivors, it's against noob killers who tunnel. Yes 60 seconds are a bit too much, but survivors deserve a perk against tunnlers and it was in the past much stronger than now. And what's wrong about let him lay on the ground? It can be sometimes more efficient to don't hook a survivor anyway.
---
And where is your argument why Mori + Tunnel + Iridescent Head isn't OP and toxic?
---
I just realized, once they change prayer beads, this build might be even better on her. Before you were just able to get cheeky totem grabs, but with the new beads, you will make all survivors paranoid to stay on totems long enough to break them at the risk of getting grabbed since they'll all hear the phase.
---
looks more like no collision to anything but floors since he ran through the wall at one point
---
How did that happen
---
That implies that you earned pips in previous games!
---
Or even just find one in that match
---
I did it  and so did many others,  short answer you can
---
Am I the only one that thinks Spies from the Shadows isn't bad at all?
---
It's so much fun!
---
Probably cursed legacy
---
Why are you the way you are
---
Am a survivor main... Can anyone fill me in on what's going on?
---
I think they removed the stealth killer thing cause I can't  see them but they can see me, putting me wholly at a disadvantage. That being said I guess it would be hood for swf, if I had friends that played this game. I get good practice running the killer but I tend to get tunneled in green ranks regardless if I use OoO.
---
I think the better one is safely hooking someone who has safely unhooked you during the trial.
---
I did it on the first try
---
We can just kill them with the paranoia now!
---
Huntress big strong. 
---
Huntress crush small Doctor with bare hand!
---
You only need to be on the generator as it completes while using the perk. It‚Äôs not like the dailies where you have to repair the equivalent of three generators. I got this last night on my third match.
---
No gimme Sydney Prescott she was a badass who kicked ghostface ass. She could some retaliation perks similar to ds or borrowed time
---
It's because they're shitty perks and no one wants them, so the rarest they are the better.
---
Yes you can. It doesn't mean do all 3 gens feom start to finish on your own, as long as you're on the gen when it's completed it counts. Not that difficult
---
Where‚Äôs Freddy vs Jason tho
---
Not to agree with the guy above or anything, because I don't, but if we start with Moris/Keys etc? Then we have to trickle down to literally everything, cause so few people can't play this game as a good player without some sort of item, add on, perk, or offering. 
---
This is why the word "skill" is kind of funny when it comes to DbD for me. Everyone has their vice.  Ruin, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Pop Goes the Weasel, Medkit every game, Toolbox every game, etc, etc.
---
So very seldom is a game of DbD won by a group of survivors or a killer because they were one hundred percent for sure the better player.
---
This is why the game is such a mess for the devs to balance.
---
Ruin doesn't stop you, just work through it, it doesn't actually slow you down that much
---
the only reason nothing is getting done is you or your teammates are being stupid and wasting time looking for it rather than working through it
---
Perfect. May god rest the souls of the poor fools that throw down pallets
---
Chase somebody, hit them and then immediately start stalking as they're speed boosting away. Do this a few times to get T3 up to 99% and then wait until you're right on a survivor's ass to pop it. Also start using his play with your food perk, it's actually pretty amazing.
---
I did that challenge today, you don't have to do them all by yourself. You just need touch those gens when they pop up
---
I‚Äôm also a survivor main ayee hi!
---
So there‚Äôs four Hex totems in this comic: Ruin, Hounted Ground, Devour Hope and Thrill of the Hunt.
---
Usually a killer wouldn‚Äôt run all of these since they would take up every perk slot obviously..
---
omg it's real.
---
TUNNLER
---
Wow you like playing one certain person that makes you an a-hole. Probably an entitled survivor main that Miss uses the terms tunneling camping and slugging so much to the point where they‚Äôre your three base vocabulary words
---
..because they're fog whisperers? Basically BHVR employees but not really? They represent the company in a way so they reward them for doing so
---
It‚Äôs because of the makeup. It makes her look like a drag queenüòÜ
---
Survivors: "literally exsist on the map"
---
Killers: "omg toxic swf gen rushers fuck you behaviour!"
---
Thought id start using a favourite killer meme.
---
XD the laugh omg
---
Tuff
---
hi
---
Hey I like spies from the shadows. It‚Äôs good because survivors never expect it.
---
...it would only be a horrible perk if killers ran it a lot, survivors would anticipate it, and then games become really lame immersion fests
---
Use it with spirit fury aswell. Simply give 0 fucks about pallets.
---
Wait wheres the hillbilly face
---
I mean huntress is probably next after Billy if this happens
---
Not a legit build no bbq and chili
---
# Claudette
---
I dissagree. His crouch can make high visibility loops a deathreap fo survivors. Just crouch and then you have a situation where you have to mindgame but they have to guess where you are coming from. If you use shroud and remove the light as well its a complete gamble on the survivors part while he gets to just walk forward
---
But they are changing things constantly now. Like end game collapse being added, spirit and Freddy change, etc...
---
Time to bring bond/empathy and borrowed time.
---
Template?
---
That's the dumb shit I've ever heard
---
Sorry but, forever Freddy?
---
That doesn't mean give me people 4 ranks higher than me when I am rank 16 lol
---
They chill at the bonfire, I believe.
---
So true
---
Imagine dc'ing when you just kill yourself on first hook.
---
Then you remember your playing resident evil 4

Who's ORZD? And I thought the title of this video was funny. Its just gameplay not really clickbaiting chapter details or tutorials. The title is literally a meme. "Killers:exist  Survivors: picture of dc button
---
I‚Äôm talking about managing time well as killer and knowing how to waste it as survivor. Also I‚Äôm talking about knowing which gens should be done first, when certain pallets should be dropped, knowing the map tiles are ours you and knowing where your options of escaping are. I‚Äôm talking about thinking before you slam down that shack pallet and knowing how to loop the fucking shack in general. Good killer don‚Äôt commit to a 5 gen chase if they did this game would be played significantly differently.
---
Good perk if you're bad at the game. Bad perk if you're good at the game.

It would most likely be an addon change. Currently his best addon combo is very strong and common due to their rarity. Either they'd make them rarer or they'll nerf them. However I doubt they're going to do anything to Billy since even with this he's pretty balanced.
---
Her mom totally sucks. The dad is great though, and if they both actually supported her and helped her themselves, without involving some random tutor, then Claudette would be fine. With how different they seem, i don't know how her parents even got together, they are like total opposites

Bunch of bitches. All of them.

Ghostface doesn't need any help.  He's doing just fine as is.
---
Honestly. For being the most prominent killer. The first killer. And the guy who's on all of the menu stuff or promo art. He's very weak
---
Instead of just buffing weak Killers to make the more viable. They're gutting all of the only killers that stand a chance against the most optimal groups. We wouldn't see Spirit as much if other killers were viable
---
People say it's Cursed Pedigree but I bet that's just some translation error cause it's supposed to say Cursed Legacy

"It's super fun to be a sweaty nerd 24/7 and I HAVE to 4k every single time on a video game made to be played for fun."

---
Right.

Fig whisperer.

How is clown crouching?

No, because it shows the Deviousness icon. I think the joke is that he reveals a Blendette and gets points for it (see top comment as well).
---
Auto correct
---
It works, but it is a very slight improvement when you stack them, but hey, faster is faster. You can also use the thing that uncloaks you when you break them, so if you do a little mind game and get them to stand there, or stay nearby, you instantly break it and uncloak, giving an almost free hit, like spirit fury enduring if you hit, get stunned, then instantly hit them again
---
Still find the idea of someone talking to a fig funny.
---
This seems like bullying a dog to me.
---
I remember the version of this with Jake in jail
---
Tbh as a constant spine-chill user I agree with you lol, I have a headset that does the job wonderfully, but wearing it for an extended amount of time presses my glasses against my head and gives me quite a headache. Doing some research on comfortable headsets atm.
---
Also not sure if this is intended or not but I can't hear the heartbeat without a headset on? So spine chill is my go to for that stuff cause otherwise I'll just get jumpscared cause I can't hear the radius lmao.
---
totems dont just "blow up left and right" when TotH is on and the killer actually makes use of it
---
You gotta understand they cannot simply just add him they need permission.
---
If they run for longer than 4 seconds away from the hook then I stop chasing them. I got gens to finish.
---
Bullshit
---
Dbd isn‚Äôt sad without Jason, you‚Äôre sad for thinking that way.
---
Awe look at all these sad kids that are upset Jason isn‚Äôt in dbd awe boohoo.
---
Same way with stealth killers, who cares? In fact hes even worse than them, stealth killers can get a free hit off of injured survivors, legion cant, and its hardly "free" considering how easy it is to juke and avoid as survivor
---
If only wayne bros didnt sell the rights to scary  movies
---
And then piggy bursts into rage learning that since her ambush isn't a basic attack anymore, the exposed status effect won't down them with ambush.

The one I'll never get is the "get out of the hatch with the whole team"

Everything else is just a matter of time, but I hardly play killer, so it won't happen too soon.
---
Myers!
---
Played a game of Ghostface against what turned out to be a SWF team (I believe) on PS4 last night. First game as killer in a long time, just wanted to try out my new classic ghostface skin lol. It was horrible lol, body blocked, flashlighted, teabagged, and just bullied from the start. I only managed to get one kill. The entire experience reminded me of how little fun playing Killer is, and why I play survivor mainly
---
eh
---
We had 3 of us alive as we finished the last gen.  One of us had been running the killer (spirit) so we could get the last gen done, but got caught (finished the gen while killer was hooking).  I stayed to 99 the gate while my teammate went to go for the save.  He gets caught, so I use the time while the killer is hooking him to save the next guy.  Get him off hook, point to the 99‚Äôd gate, and head for the second save.
---
Unhooked guy runs straight for the killer, gets caught immediately, infectious fright triggers, I try to run the killer and manage to open the 99‚Äôd door but get caught in the entryway.
---
The one slugged guy doesn‚Äôt even make an attempt to crawl out even though he easily could have made it with the killer busy carrying me.  Killer ends up with a 4k because of that one infectious fright trigger.
---

Ghost Face needs a nerf, not a buff. This isn't coming from a whiny survivor, this is coming from a Ghost Face main.
---
DT 770 for closed 
---
HD 599 for open
---
Good mid range cans
---
I was your teammate who dropped god after one loop sorry
---
must be a super secret charm if the guy even blocked taking screenshots of the video
---
He really shouldn't be affected by his own power, no other killer can be hindered like that with their own power. He has to find his traps, pick them up, then place them, then avoid them it's BS.
---
Is this a leak or concept ?
---
Similar is not synonymous with copies. I think you misread, more perks to reflect her retaliative personality in the movies.
---
Actually had a teammate that camped God pallet and then dropped it hella early before killer even realized. Mind you this was the very first "chase" in the game.
---
It's a meme template! No actual dogs were bullied on my part, anyways.
---
The Entity builds different locations when they're needed. When a trial is going on, the Campfire fades out of existence. When the trial ends, then the survivors are moved back to the Campfire until the next Trial is formed.
---
please save us this F tier pit is painful
---
Honestly, I don't think dedicated servers are that bad. Don't get me wrong here, there are some clear glaring issues with the servers and BHVR is clearly incompetent when it comes down to coding basically anything, but from my experiences over the past couple of weeks, a lot of the issues have been fixed and it's usually up to par with how it used to be on killer hosted lobbies. It's only the occasional dead hard glitch or the Wraith bug where he remains cloaked after being taken out of stealth which are the most noticable for me, most of the time.
---
if you are using shadow dance I recommend banboozled instead, so you can close loops faster then body block pallets, but brutal is fine too
---
Imagine the dude as some gollum type creature wearing a loincloth crouching over a fig whispering to it, makes it even better
---
Ok we don‚Äôt need anything ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù to already existing perks.
---
No, they have to be sacrifices
---
I meant sacrificing 25 times
---
I attempt to get a sneaky gen grab during tier one. Then stalk to get out of 1 ASAP. Then play normally but stalk whenever you hit them or they drop a pallet up to right before tier 3. You‚Äôd be surprised how many people stay in your line of sight while you slowly walk/stalk towards them lol
---
It's basically people that have played the game for a really long time and that BHVR will listen to on thoughts of the game and balancing, like streamers and YouTubers that will work with them on the game to make it better
---
I remember I was literally dry humping ghostface and breathing down his neck and I still couldn't break him out stalk mode. So I gave up on it and when he turned the corner (I was looking at the wall) I broke him out of stalk mode. 50 m/s ping btw.

If anything they need to buff the survivor equivalent (WGLF).

TuNnElEr

Nah they're just doing a lot of laundry in Haddonfield at the moment. Apparently they didn't check the pockets of the work pants tho
---
Can‚Äôt forget flip flop just in case you get picked up
---
lol, freddy is triggered
---
They can‚Äôt add him because of that bullshit lawsuit between the two co creators of the series
---
i think the only way to really do it is luck on a bad killer and a 4man swf, that's how i did it
---
They said that they would buff him like 8 months ago.
---
this gets lobby teched
---
Technician is such a bad perk, why do you run it?
---
I literally played against a pig with this exact build earlier
---
if people don't like something then they call it toxic,
---
you do your objective, as survivor or killer? toxic
---
you use x perk? toxic
---
your side gets nerfed? the other side is a bunch of crybabies, but if the opposite happens the devs are clearly biased against you
---
I don't know how they did it, but last 3 times I ran that build, the survivors cleansed all totems except for haunted grounds
---
I‚Äôll settle for being returned to the menu I was already in when I clicked the Rift Icon.  I‚Äôll be in the survivor menu, click the rift to change challenges, then it‚Äôs the main menu again.
---
Insidious is great for meme builds though. 
---
Slap Insidious on Demogorgon, and get a basement hook. Hide in a corner, and scare the ever living fuck out of the survivors when they go for the unhook.
---
I had an Ash do this and go ballistic in the end game when I showed them hatch and then hooked them. I play survivor too bro, you think imma reward you for showing me where your teammates are? Not a chance.
---
Had this happen to me about a month ago but as the killer
---
Vaults just occasionally didn‚Äôt exist
---
I was also Myers I think also same map
---
Which perk is that again?
---
Midway through tier 36
---
I think the word 'bad' is subjective. I like it because I'm always working gens, I hate conflicts and chases, and it eats half of my failed skilled checks, which has come in handy
---
Well they just said they would put in punishments for DC'ing from the game next patch.
---
Which in all fairness is gonna kill this game for me because i can't for the love of god avoid getting kicked out of games. 
---
I know other people has this issue aswell and it will probably kill the game for them aswell...
---
So yeah you get your punishment system and probably effectively longer queue times since the devs haven't addressed the issue a lot of people have with getting kicked off games
---
I need a template fam.
---
Ya I have them all too!
---
Ok. How long do you think they are at the campfire and are they aware of time passing?
---
I would recommend you buy more fans. In the BIOS, you should be able to control how fast the CPU fan spins. 
---
Is anything on your PC that blocks the fans? Like a pet cat.
---
As someone who runs small game, it's honestly the best. Knockout HG asap and then get everything else while someone sticks to gens. Perkless killer is best killer.

I never considered using Spine Chill as an anti-spirit. I use it to avoid Michael, Ghostface, and Pig.

I wonder how many more excuses survivors pull out of their asses. Survivors get gens done quickly cause their only doing gens focusing on themselves. 
---
Not saving their teammates, not distracting the killer, not cleansing totems etc. Then when survivors get their asses kicked when the last gen is done they dc even though they were "doing the objective". 
---
Cause when it comes to actually playing the game survivors always fail they only know how to do to skill checks and hide the entire time like selfish pussys. Yes it is toxic for both sides especially to survivors.

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
---
Gotta fully sacrifice survivors 25 times each per mask, moris don't count, and the masks you can get are for Meg, Dwight, Claudette, and Jake. The sacrifices have to be on those characters too, Jake sacrifices don't count toward Meg and vice versa
---
The laggy ones are the worst. I'll sometimes get really bad lagspikes and the timing of them always sucks - its usually either when I'm doing a skillcheck as survivor, or swinging as killer - and either one usually ends up getting fucked up because of it.

Technically you don't get anything but a seraded blade which wasn't in scream 1 and the same mask but whiter
---
I also watch TydeTime! He‚Äôs really great, always talking about important perks and buffs and nerfs and always giving build tips. I will definitely check out those other channels though. Thank you!
---
I'm scared, if you were to switch out TOTH for third seal, you'd have my actual pig build
---

---
And how much salt would you like in your coffee sir?
---
So was balanced landing
---
I did that challenge in 1 game, because it was a very weird-playing Freddy, and i kept dodging while he hoped between gens and had Pop goes the weasel. He was also a bit tunnelly and campy, so i did 4 gens almost by myself and prove thyself which started the gen, before he popped it.
---
It was not a gift lol. One of the survivors left it there right next to the hatch to avoid Franklin's, to use a toolbox/medkit, or in case of an emergency. You just went ahead, stole it, and wasted it when only one gen was left and someone on their first hook. I hope you realize this eventually.
---
Relateable

So...?

if it glows it goes

If it gloweth, it goweth.

We found bill

 They‚Äôre all wasted perk slots it‚Äôs just a fun build

Then they say ‚Äúget good‚Äù or ‚Äústay mad‚Äù like there‚Äôs any way to justify that

Hahaha, you are wrong.

---
Legion's power makes me sad
---
Spin in circles. It helps.
---
The problem is that we don't have Super AAA Developers, and they have a small team. And one of the major problems is that they don't play their game enough to know core problems and there are a million voices crying in the dark about every possible  game mechanic and playstyle, so they don't know what to do. The nurse and spirit nerfs actually suprised me, because they aren't  butchering them, like expected, and it shows that they are starting to get better with making snall changes that fix the problem, instead of huge changes that cause more.
---
Yip, A lot of people get kicked because of the connection. I‚Äôve lost track of how many times people get DC at the start of the game then you need to wait another 15 minutes.
---
44
---
I dont think that thats it, I have done this before and the gates were open
---
Modern problems require modern soloutions.
---
this deserves a lot more attention
---
i didn't make this meme
---
Hey thats me!
---
Works the same if it was just ruin and haunted grounds too
---
Take this theory a step further. It's not the oni or the tiger it's the literal poster(or whatever it is) that they're printed on
---
I don't use SPine Chill as anti-Spirit, I personally use it because it tells me if the Killer is chasing someone nearby or if they're on their way to me.
---
I get so many gens done that I usually wouldn't because I know when to stay on them because of Spinechill.
---
Lol. What happened in the match? Were there 5 survivors?
---
You still got out though.
---
They have to remove those things on top of the basements stairs
---
No sadly one left by choice
---
There's a claudebt to be paid, and they're here to collect.

What's your point here? Just to whine?

Well you were complaining that your teammates aren‚Äôt sweaty enough while you sweat on two gens

Just glad to see a rework

ü§£ This comment is amazing. Holy shit.
---
It's an issue with the dedicated servers most grabs don't work well.
---
The amount of people that would block us spirit players, oh boy
---
I worded that seriously wrong! I meant when you snap out of it. On switch it can be impossible hitting the skill checks.
---
Wait, he's getting out? Hey, I want out too!
---
Just report them for hate speech and they'll likely have their PSN banned or timed out.
---
Probably just dedicated servers, since that dropped, games will just randomly disconnect a survivor, usually if they have worse connection than the server likes. So the game will just end for people. You can tell if they are running and just drop, because that means they didn't go through the menu. And alot of times, it won't give abandoned points. Also with dedicated servers, there have been magic hits through windows, teleporting survivors, hits through pallets, (like, as the survivor is running away, the killer hits a pallet and it kills the survivor, so maybe BS hits are making people DC. All in all, most of the problem happened after dedicated servers came out, which i find hilarious, because sooo many people were saying "oh you wait for dedicated servers, then you can't  DC as much!"
---
Excuse me his name is Carl
---
Not your key.
---
Oh god its back, and uglier than ever
---
Only a few are tied explicitly, but there‚Äôs several implied connections and then some theories about others.
---
My personal theory is that all of the survivors were first connected to the Entity when they visited the location where the Entity took the associated killer (even if they weren‚Äôt necessarily taken right then.)
---
The lore states that the entity can only connect to the real world at ‚Äúweak points‚Äù where powerful tragedies have occurred.  My personal head canon on the way survivors are taken is that when a person enters one of these weak points, the entity can sink its claws into their souls.  Once it has its claws in a person, the Entity can take them at the moment of their death (even if they don‚Äôt die at the weak spot.)

But I have a challenge to cleanse totems.

go for it dude
---
OMG. So funny!
---
They used to always win because the connection was p2p, with dedicated servers now it comes down to whoever has the better connection to the server, there's been a few videos of people on this sub of survivors jumping through even though the killer was closing it. They could've fixed it to make it always go to the killer but from what I understand it's just a connection thing
---
Stop reposting this.
---
Lol. So very true. Had a god level Freddy completely own our group, i looped him as the last survivor for 50 seconds, had him eat one pallet....and it felt sooooo guuuuddddd‚öì‚öì‚öì
---
Come to pc. If the match is already lost, most killers will goof around with you for a little bit before killing you. Sometimes they even give you hatch &lt;3
---
But then some killers will straight up murder you regardless.
---
Oh yes! Look at the hive mind activate! Shirtless David acting like its no big deal unless it became a problem for him lol just like everyone else in the sub. Anonymous cowards lol always being sarcastic pricks when you bring up actual issues, but as long as the hive mind dont complain, who cares? Lmfao fucking losers
---
Correct. Neither of these things are toxic.
---
You do realize the person who got hooked gave up almost immediately, right when the gen finished, not even giving OP or the other survivor a chance to save them, right? And OP said the Claudette escaped right after they did, so what‚Äôs your problem here? Two survivors were dead. OP used the key, and the two remaining ones escaped. *That‚Äôs what the key is for*, and no one got screwed over by OP using it.
---
Funny that you censored everything but your name in left hand bottom cornerü§î
---
Have you played on console or pc before?
---
Out of curiosity... as a killer main, when would it be appropriate or how would I be able to identify a good time to offer a friendly hatch to the lone survivor? 
---
I typically go for all 4 kills every time.
---
change phobia to STBFL
---
Um does this mean there is an unlimited number of Dwights that only exist to be thrown into the fire?
---
when the killer is a noob and gets no kills but it's ok because you bodyblock baby dwight during egc and do a murder-suicide
---
feels good bein a nea main
---
I don't know if it counts only for survivors or not
---
They make generators go by extremely slowly, and is completely unfun to play against when coupled with other game slowdown perks like dying light / thanatophobia / ruin.
---
What else were you supposed to do when the doors were open?
---
He's severely hurt and trying to mask it lol
---
Why would that matter?
---
This *literally* just happened to me in my last game. The player chasing me got mad and started vaulting everything near me and wasting pallets to draw the killer in. Then they suicided on hook.   
---
Luckily the rest of us managed to get away.   
---
Please don't be toxic like this, guys.
---
Not even close, billy without add ons its actually balanced, freedy its better than him and disguating with specific add ons and perks, they need to start buffing the weak killers, and maybe a small nerf for freedy and add on rework for billy
---
Oh i see, yeah they should match that with bbq
---
You should have said follow your own advice
---
Oh okay, I get it now, thanks!
---
üò≤
---
It‚Äôs not. You have perks designed to help you kill. If you need to do it at the endgame so be it.
---
Yeah I know but like they could have easily got him if they didn't leave
---
Not sure. It's only until the Trial grounds are created, so the equivalent of the searching, lobby timer, and loading screens, I guess. Time in the Entity's Realm doesn't work like it does for us normally. As evident by the Plague still being alive, the Legion, Nancy, and Steve still being 19ish when they're from the 90s and 80s respectively. I'm sure they're aware that time is passing, but it doesn't affect them in any way.
---
This isn't my first time posting this?
---
this is the scariest thing in dbd
---
I saw the exact same post 10mins ago.
---
That sounds awful.
---
For me it's too stressful because no matter what I won't be able to protect them, it just requires more attention I can give
---
They should've just made it give 1 progress to whoever is on the heal when it gets finished
---
The Teachable perks on a character remain unlocked, but you still need to find them in the bloodweb again. With the way that bloodwebs spawn, and how much it costs to get a single level, it just doesn't feel worth it.
---
I prestiged my billy 3 times. On the third time, it took me 50 BLOODWEBS to get bbq!
---
I've had it happen before!
---
I... never said that he's not a good stealth killer. I said that he needs a nerf. I majn Ghost Face, and I don't follow what's typically used on him. He's too good, that's always been the problem.
---
More like they should buff WGLF to have another effect
---
They're some of his best meta add-ons. Now called the "Forever Freddy" build, where generators take 4 years to be completed.
---
Oh, that's because I accidentally posted this on a second account that I forgot I had. I deactivated that account and posted it on this one. Sorry!
---
Why ditch alert? I may be clueless but from my perspective it‚Äôs a good information perk that lets me make my decisions better.
---
I just try to have fun. I like giving hatch, I don‚Äôt take this game too seriously
---
This is usually how I play. I let the survivors guild my actions. 
---
The only problem with that is, they never seem to realize when their actions lead me to play they way they are. They only want a fair killer, even if they are playing unfairly.
---
It‚Äôs super fast lol.
---
Camping is absolutely pathetic.  That being said open exit gates is not fucking camping lol.  Only a truly entitled meme of a survivor has the entitled balls to complain about an endgame camp.
---
Guess you can say that it slows the game down just a little bit?
---
We live in a *takes a massive breath from gas bottle* society
---
*He says after nerfs of DS, insta heals, BNPs, MoM, BT etc*
---
Here‚Äôs a truly unpopular opinion, the survivors nerfs were warranted, and the killer nerfs were warranted too. Killer mains won‚Äôt stop the bitching until every game is an ez 4kakewalk where they can fuck up many times in one game and still have all 5 gens left. Survivors mains will bitch regardless. Both sides should be ignored. 
---
After Legion, Pig and Doc get some balanced buffs the game will be in a good spot. Every killer doesn‚Äôt need to be S/ A tier. Clown, Ghostface etc are fine as are
---
He's not wrong, with the right builds it can be pretty fun to meme around with. It can reduce the time it takes to catch a survivor with dead hard if you swing and it makes corn blindness bearable.
---
Yes and?
---
This happenee to me, dont close your game or change killers and you can enjoy him for the rest of the day!
---
Welp, isn't ulra rare should be strong? And it's easy to play around with numbers on deep wounds: how fast timers goes, how much time you need to mend.
---
According to moistinator_69

Oh no, you‚Äôll be seen by his 3 subscribers on Youtube! You better watch out!

I've even had it where the skill check notification sounds, then doesn't pop up at all but penalises me for not hitting it. Then teammates point at me to leave :(
---
And period.
---
‚ÄúGet out of here stalker‚Äù
---
Oh yeah I didn't camp at all the whole game til the end game collapse started up and I hooked someone

I don‚Äôt main either one there buddy, I‚Äôm saying that killers are unnecessarily targeted like mad in this ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù and it needs to stop

You better not cry

Why should ds be permanent?

If you want to see the ultimate evil tho look for a Dwight squad. Rank 1 Dwight is an absolutely ruthless creature who will chew you as an aperetif
---
Replace iron maiden with thanatophobia and replace bbq with ruin if you dont care too much about bp.
---
Your build is fine but a bit boring, add diversion in there for some fun?
---
Except the hatch just spawned when they completed that gen so no one knew where it was before that AND the key was obviously at the base of a destroyed hook, just here because the survivor who brought it died on said hook. 
---
He "stole" the key of a dead body.
---
Everyone would take Flower Babushka with it then.
---
I miss my swings at rank 1 after two years of playing. I still won't use Unrelenting
---
I do agree that they're not that bad, but the key is that they're worse than peer-to-peer which is what they were trying to fix, which means that the main objective of dedicated servers was missed.
---
Thought this was gonna be an announcement for the upcoming trailer or PTB feelsbad.
---
Uh have you tried clicking on the animatic icon?
---
Ok
---
What is that perk on the right? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen that one before.
---
And none of them realised thrill of the hunt? Actually tbh quite accurate.
---
Warning 4k post
---
I run a similar build sometimes but minus thrill of the hunt for bbq. I had a game where the survivors managed to cleanse everything except haunted grounds. I felt so cheated lol.

You are not allowed to do that toxic killer

Infuriating as camping in any capacity is, this looks like he deserves it. He was clearly hysterical with salt.
---
Rare picture of a Bill main ascending to Valhalla(colorized)

Because typically you run from the killer, so when someone walks up to you and drops their item at your feet you take a second to register what happened and realize they just wanna mess around
---
At this point both sides get made if the other breathes
---
Flashlighting every down, when I decide to not look at walls every single down to prevent it. Constantly teabagging, head-on, finishing the generator in my face. Dismantling hooks or multiple people bodyblocking when I'm about to hook someone making them finish wiggling. Fast vaulting windows or lockers while I'm in chase so I can't hear shit when I already can't hear shit because of the obnoxious chase music. Dismantling event hooks during the hollowed blight event. Following a trapper with small game and dismantling every single one of their hooks making their power absolutely useless. Every single game ending when people teabag at the exit gate or the hatch.
---
Edit: Added more stuff
---
Yes but, when you are telling someone to buy something and you rate the maps it sounds like to them that the only way to get the maps are through the chapter.
---
People are so lame sometimes
---
You right. Toxicity clearly is not breaking the rules you know.
---
This is beauty at its finest.
---
I've got the benefit of having my step-brother play on PS4 so there's no in game chat so they'd have to message via Play Station network and most don't bother. It's constant cheerleading and coaching on my part as he plays and I feel the most important rule I've taught him is "If they have the gens done and theirs 4 still up, don't bother your just gonna get t-bagged at the gates, walk to a corner, and go grab a drink/sandwich" I know doesn't translate well to later, but it keeps him from quiting or giving up on this.
---
Survivors are to immersed to do something useful. Not a big deal to me as killer tbh
---
He isn't a bad killer. But at high ranks, no one uses the stalking part of his kit and just use him for his lack of terror radius and red stain. This was just an idea to maybe get more people to stalk along with giving him a small but cool buff
---
ultra cursed
---
I don't understand what's special about this.

*crouch intensifies*
---
He either plays on a controller or flexing on you with his analog keyboard
---
-Tenacity has allowed me to crawl away from the killer quickly
---
-No Mither's noise reduction prevents the killer from hearing my moans. The perk also removes my pools of blood, so unless they have deerstalker, there is no way to reliably track me
---
-Unbreakable gets me up quicker so I can get back on action sooner
---
-Flip-Flop has never done anything for me, I've used it in over 50 matches  and not a single time did it come in handy. Either the killer picks me up before I can build flip flop up, I crawl away from the killer and get up OR, and this has happened only 2 times, the killer picks me up after a brief period of slugging and then brings me to a hook anyways because 50% of the wriggle bar isn't enough to get me free
---
I don't see the first 3 as watsed perk slots because I can actually use them from time to time. The last one is wasted because it literally never made a difference, not picking a 4th perk would have gotten the exact same effect
---
Idk how it's called lmao
---
Not the point. Survivors wont stop yelling about until they 4 person escape every match.  Someone was bitching about trapper being op a while ago,  like wtf.
---
Damn the salt.

Spirit isn‚Äôt THAT hard to beat.

THAS RIGHT

My little brother never played killer but while I was sitting in his room he told me he wanted to be doc. So he loaded a match and there were a bunch of rank 20s like him but two of them were neas with pink hair flashlights and the exact same outfit I got suspicious so since I'm on Xbox I checked their profiles to see how much they played the game and by what I've seen they purposely dropped to play lower killers. I asked if I could have the controller so I could see if they were gonna bully him and yeah they were. Flashing light clicking and tbagging after everything so I went full sweat on them and kicked their asses because turns out they weren't even that good, explains why they wanted baby killers I guess, but they were better than a newbie. Before I killed them i made sure I was a dick about it though, I let them off my shoulder a few times just to beat them in another chase shaking my head and all that good stuff. And to finish I told them gg and said "man this killer stuff is super easy" and quickly muted them to prevent the some notifications from popping up on my brothers Xbox.

---
No, you lose everything but your characters teachable perks. All perks besides your teachables, all your add ons, and all your offerings for that character are gone. Its basically a complete restart. In return you get a piece of a bloody skin cosmetic and an icon that you're prestige 1.
---
Imagine just chilling in the park on your day off and then some leg decides to kill you out of nowhere
---
I also ran into a guy using stuff like this the other night. I was unable to hit him and sometimes he was even invisible. First i thought i was stupid but I chased him out the exit gate and picked up another survivor, then he suddenly tried to blind me trough the exit gate but i looked away and hooked the other. He once again came out of the gate and unhooked and they ran out. I was standing at the, for me blocked gate and he was like 10m outside without actually escaping and teabagged me.
---
See that open door? That's the chat window. Just close it.
---
Even your teachables get knocked back to tier 1.
---
Yeah I know what you mean,I say away from it personally but if he wants a good build it should be in there. I personally don't run BT too much either. Im a fan of we'll make it and Spine Chill with Dead Hard and Adrenaline
---
Erma? 
---
If it's half as cute as OP's art please share.
---
When u see steve walking
---
Ok.
---
Honesty the only toxic thing I see listed is teabagging, the others are all valid gameplay mechanics.
---
I've had dead hard bug and give me infinite uses once before. There a lot of weird ass bugs in this game.
---
Curtain Call was one of my favs. Clown suffers from map pressure but at least he doesn‚Äôt get looped all game. More than that though, it‚Äôs because as that chapter was launched the game was coming into its own from the dark days.
---
Spirit chapter was good. Good killer, interesting perks, shame about the map.
---
I‚Äôd have rated Halloween as the worst. DS ruined the game for over 2 years and dying light was a toxic perk that encouraged hard tunneling.
---
Legion I would agree with. Awful, awful killer in terms of mechanics. Plus the unreal update came out at the time which really fucked with the game, especially the sound
---
wow remember when they used to have those offerings? it sounds like they still do, but maybe u dont get them if u buy every dlc as soon as its out?
---
There should *really* be a rule against backseat moderation.
---
Cool mate I‚Äôm kind of glad you think I care for your ‚Äúinspiring‚Äù words.
---
I‚Äôd just lobby dodge something like this. A 4 man swf is hard enough to beat on its own, ESPECIALLY hard to win if they all have toolboxes. Even spirit would have trouble dealing with this
---
Yeah, it appears as locked when I try to play it but it is showed as unlocked on the left side of the screen that shows how many challanges I have done for the memories.
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse'sCalling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
Well if you want to face a hooksawing swf as killer, have fun with that. Just because it's a valid gameplay strategy doesn't mean it's fun and won't piss anyone off.
---
[erma ](https://m.tapas.io/episode/261918) is web base comic that basically saids, ‚Äúyou know that girl from the ring, what if she was older and she had a daughter‚Äù
---
Vice versa.
---
Also clown has 2 strong perks! 
---
I don‚Äôt agree with your rating on Halloween but we have to include the fact that Clown has 2 strong ass perks.
---
So then transfer the screenshot to your phone?
---
ive always felt that its [the killer's job to be a 'good host'](/intensifies) . try to help everyone have fun, and always let everyone win. (besides ppl who intentionally give up on the hook, nothing u can do about that)
---
Is this just a meme now?
---
If you're playin 5 totem Pig like the drawing suggests, they most certainly do. 5 totem Doc, or Spirit, or Nurse can actually work but Pig is never gonna guard them well unless you're on The Game vs a non-SWFs
---
This, none one could figure out how to walk.  She had good map pressure bit her power isn‚Äôt good in a chase.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, it is!
---
avoid the killer and bring toolboxes with faster repair add ons and bnps
---
Happened to me but with the agitation basement hook thingie.
---
Well, in short, they spent lots of funds on the game that has 68 players online, despite all the pr among dbd community. So that could be possibly a reason why they try to restore cash lost from that game trough dbd dlc's, and why they made season pass in the first place.
---
They also have a problem with being obliged to "release" that game, and that means - spending even more cash to develop something that's already dead, but they cannot cancel the game as well, because people already bought it. And this probably means even more paid updates for dbd to cover the losses.
---
Chill out. You only need to be there when the gen reaches 100% completion,not do it all the way.
---
Doin gens you?
---
"Fixed an issue that allowed the Legion to hook Survivors"
---
BUT WHAT?
---
Oh dawg, this is getting out of hand
---
I think I laughed way more than I was supposed to. Nicely done and put together lol.
---
Murderous* solutions
---
I somehow did it, first gen I used a tool box w/ a new part, then the other 2 I did w/ my team mates, try to use an offering that gives you a big map so it‚Äôll be easier to finish them before the killer gets to you
---
As long as you are on the Gen as it completes it counts, you don't actually need to 100% it yourself.
---
I understand the rant. You could just ask on reddit ir steam if someone wants to play w you (maybe for a longer time or only for the challenge). I dont play anymore so im out, but I did this several times for games my friends didnt own
---
I wouldn't run this many hex perks, but it would be nice to label the hexed totems to prioritize patrolling and baiting Haunted Grounds.
---
Then why the fuck did you explain yourself to someone who doesn‚Äôt care, you aren‚Äôt making any sense mate.
---
Just do all the totems whenever you see them like I do. Lol
---
O0f
---
It‚Äôs the names. If you‚Äôre all named the same thing then the hud has no clue what‚Äôs going on. One guy will get smacked and it‚Äôll say someone else got injured. And it‚Äôs not even consistent
---
If you're outside the radius, you hear the Phase sound, but to be honest I've never ran towards the husk to see if it would suddenly stop when you get in range. u/int3r4ct might have tested that, perhaps they have an answer for you.
---
What is hg?
---
Haunted Ground :)
---
I related the most to the "Standing still" mind game lol Literally no skill involved. I actually got spirit and used her for the first time and survivors were literally tripping over themselves, I stand still- They drop a pallet and run, I phase they try to walk away but i just release my phasing and see them since you won't get far. I haven't bumped anyone that i know of but i rememberer phasing and unphasing and the player run into me. She's the worst imo No telegraph to speak of.
---
That even scared me
---
Toxic people=all the main survivors

Just don't do it on the Pig, you're gonna have a really bad time. I'd recommend Doc with sniper addons, Spirit with Prayer Beads or Billy on an open map if you actually want to see any sort of success with it. Also Hag but it can be hard to setup traps on all 5 totems before one gets broken since she's so damn slow.
---
*chuckes* I‚Äôm in danger
---
What.
---
Also reported him, ingame and on steam. It said on his profile that he had been VAC banned already like a year ago...
---
Is this the krustykrab?
---
It's doable, if very situational, if you take Bond and maybe a toolbox &amp; an offering to start together. Try to only ever do gens with others, you only need to be working on it when it's finished.
---
Why so mad
---
Outdated but thx anyway
---
What's a boomer
---
Urban evasion who?
---
I think for these type of hex builds, you just have to accept that you could have games where the spawns are trash and you‚Äôll get steamrolled. But I mainly play survivor so I wouldn‚Äôt really know.
---
Why? If someones getting chased and it looks like a safe time, get some backrubs. Both of us running behind a tree is time we could be doing gens, Meg.
---
Yes
---
He should post this screenshot to YouTube as well so people can laugh at how hurt he is about losing a match
---
Just like this mate here, what a coincidence...
---
Lol you must have me confused, just because someone says a swear word doesn‚Äôt mean someone‚Äôs angry lewl. You must be confused once again.
---
I don't know what is happening, but it scares me on an instinctive level...
---
You realise you just have to be on it while it completes right? Bring bond and prove thyself. It's really not that hard.
---
Also where is there a hint of inspiration you speak of?
---
Survivor confirmed?
---
I've had that idea for so long, so glad somebody got around to making it :)
---
I love you too
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say Myers is great, he‚Äôs good and fun to play, but he‚Äôs just a simple M1 killer who can expose at EW3. Same with Ghost Face
---
I probably will swap prayer beads for Distressing and a small map offering once the patch comes out. In my experience, with Distressing they get desensitized to always being in your terror radius and still get grabbed late into the game.
---
I love you too &lt;3. 
---
Let‚Äôs get into one those horrible marriages where it doesn‚Äôt work out babe.
---
Thank you
---
I do
---
Mission failed, we get em next time!
---
Both sides are targeted like mad, there‚Äôs no victim here lol
---
Can you imagine the size of the bowl for survivors?
---
I do.
---
Well, he's not wrong, I guess?
---
Imagine being that upset over a video game
---
Classic looks
---
One guy and the whole community is different. The "proof" behind every survivor being like this is that they complained about Nurse and Spirit, who both needed changes. They complained about something worth complaining about and changes were made that were not that harmful to either side.

Claudette 3: *gets hooked*

Claudette 1: *ayy first hook fifteen minutes in lmao killer bad*
---
Thanks I recently started using KineMaster
---
By finishing a generator in your face, do you simply mean somebody sticking on the gen to finish it while you‚Äôre approaching? I‚Äôve always felt that was an altruistic approach for survivors that likely costs them but benefits the team. Plus it typically gets the killer a guaranteed hook.
---
I'm A SpIriT MaIn!
---
We got him.
---
I really wish this game had a training mode that let you play as the killer of your choice in an environment where you can actually use the game's mechanics (vaults, pallets, use your powers, etc.). There are several killers I have never played (and even some where I have and still have no clue how their powers work) because I don't like that my first attempt at learning the barest of basics will necessarily be in a live-fire environment.
---
I have only played Nurse twice and both times I don't think I even hit a single survivor because I couldn't figure out how to chain-blink and I got steamrolled so hard it was embarrassing. I don't understand why the tutorial in this game is so bad.
---
So... do we kiss now?
---
Just tell people in chat before game. Everytime someone mentions it in pre game chat I just 99% to help. Had a killer with pop in one but it‚Äôs still nice to help others out. Most will help I think.
---
As long as you are on the gen for 1% when it gets completed it counts, it's one of the easier challenges
---
I was the last survivor left vs a ghostface once so I ran to Maurice for comfort in my dying moments, he downed me right there and then HIT MAURICE. Couldn‚Äôt believe my eyes. Reported

What‚Äôs that whooshing sound.....
---
I play Claudette and can confirm this to be true. (Although i don't play blendette, i play glow in the dark claudette)
---
With interest
---
The problem with those "challenges" are the rewards aren't really worth it... at all. I'm not trading my sanity for rift fragments.
---
Sorry m8 this was my group. We didn't lose a game that night
---
It‚Äôs honestly a decent Perk until the Survivors figure out you are using it. 
---
I like to use it on Myers to stop Borrowed Time, or kick a Gen and sit by it in Tier 3 until someone comes to touch it. 
---
The only problem with it is that it‚Äôs SUPER situational. You don‚Äôt really want to be standing still as a Killer, but there are times when 1-2 Survivors are dead and you can really start to mindgame with it for the late-game Survivors. Sitting on Hatch/near exit gates with Insidious is hilarious because almost nobody expects it to be used, considering how off-Meta it is.
---
Oof. Ouch. My bones are hurting.
---
Personal? That's not fair to the other three survivors
---
Maybe it's an actual hidden feature
---
I tried not camping, kept losing, now I just patrol the area. If the survivors want too throw the game by doing rescues instead of gens then that's them being stupid. The killer is supposed to get kills and not allow escapes, if you're a survivor and you're going for rescues when there are four gens too do, you're an idiot. If you're hooked and there's four gens too do and you keep trying to get off the hook  instead of waiting and you summon the entity within the first ten seconds, you're ass.
---
Helps for when you‚Äôre getting Gen-Rushed at the beginning, or finding that last Survivor after kicking the Hatch.

It‚Äôs not really common, but I suppose some people might still be using it.

OP. This is bug is referred to as ‚ÄúMachine gun Nurse.‚Äù It happens when you blink immediately after a fatigue (I think)
---
Believe it or not, last year I submitted a support ticket to DBD and posted it on the forums asking the devs to fix it.  I‚Äôll try to find it.
---
Edit : [Found it](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/28088/nurse-bug#latest)
---
I do this challenge with no mither and this is not happening, green toolboox with speed add ons fucking easy that poor Myers dont have a chance I do four gens in 3 minutes

God, I absolutely hate players like this. Sorry you had to deal with this. Not all of us PS4 players are like this.

I use it on Pig a lot, because most of the time people with Traps on their head spend a lot of time running around you, so it‚Äôs easy to tell which box they‚Äôre going to/their general location. 
---
Honestly it‚Äôs super underrated on Pig/Nurse/Spirit. But god forbid you get a shitty wide-open Map
---
No, I‚Äôm not taking it ‚Äútoo seriously‚Äù. The realm on the Entity defies logic, but the killers don‚Äôt. What if the Trapper decides to mori a survivor in a desolate corner with no bear traps for at least 60 meters? It makes no sense, and the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre taking it too seriously‚Äù argument tells me that you‚Äôve run out of things to say.

"One of the killers jobs is not taking advantage of the game"  ??  
---
But survivors can?  The killer's objective is to kill you.  If survivors are pulling out all the stops and getting their objective done ASAP by utilizing the game mechanics - then so can the killer.  Gen rushing is part of the game  - but that coin has two sides and NoEd punishes gen rushing.

I agree with there rules as a (mainly)Killer main.
---
Sir trust me when I say I don't need a breakdown of the chad build. Look at my flair.
---
It's a meme build. Yes, it can work, everything CAN work. It's still not a good build. You're much better off running just about anything else. Unbreakable and tenacity have their uses, but they're still not good perks. Flip-flop can come in handy as well.
---
I don't understand why you would ever defend no mither. Running no mither is quite actually just throwing whatever match you're going into. It should be used exclusively for fucking around.
---

The Rift resets every 60 or so days. You can earn up to 1000 shards in the rift in order to purchase the next rift for free. But yeah, every new rift costs 1000 shards :) You have plenty of time though

When the survivor loops you for the full 60sec:

why do I relate to this

why the first rule though? that‚Äôs just cruel. It‚Äôs not their fault their teammate did that.

Jeff is a quality survivor

Technically they‚Äôre not exclusive. Just play the game a lot and get a large amount of viewers/subscribers on Twitch/YouTube and you‚Äôll be a fog whisperer in no time!
---
The clown
---
I sit on it while it‚Äôs open until I start to hear footsteps/breathing nearby, and then I slam it immediately because I‚Äôm directly on top of it. Headphones will help with this a lot, or you can just use Whispers or Stridor too.
---
In some scenarios where‚Äôs its inside/cramped in a small space, they might have a chance to escape before you can slam it, but on maps like Springwood/Autohaven when it spawns in the middle of a field or smack in the middle of a building, you can easily hear a Survivor coming to it and slam it before they even get close. It‚Äôs even better when it‚Äôs in the Basement in Springfield because there‚Äôs usually an opportunity to body-Block it from the corridor
---
Same damn thing happened to me
---

While they‚Äôre at it they should add a wishlist feature.

That's still a great dumb fun movie. I love it
---
Instead of the exhaustion effect, it should give Hindered for x amount of seconds after getting off a gen less than 80. Turns into a useless perk to amazing with stealth killers
---
That's the dumbest comment so far. How am I supposed to read the future to know when I need how many minutes and when like no and then don't write stupid comments that assume things that aren't true then and you won't be disappointed. Quite a lot of people play on xbox so what even. I'm not setting my capture to 10 minutes to waste up capture storage when I only need 60 seconds how are you this dumb? Like wow.

I think he is pretty solid. Decent mobility and can shut down certain loops when you learn his Shred attack. That isnt even mentioning all the adorable noises he makes.

Can someone explain what is so interesting here?
---
what about deja vu deja vu op nerf too pls
---
I'm so used to playing against disorganized, immersed survivors that it's honestly a treat to face a coordinated team that actually tries to win. I enjoy seeing what they are gonna try to do. Are they bringing a map offering? Will I actually sweat a little bit this game? Can I give them a run for their money or are they going to genrush in ten minutes and get out of there? It makes me care about what perks I take a bit more and the payoff is nice when you guess right and counter them.
---
https://youtu.be/oyAP6PpAzK8
---
I agree with all of them, one rule i think should be added is if the killer has no sacrifices and the door is open, you should let the killer sacrifice one person.
---
Trapper is stupid at low ranks can't even place a trap down without it getting taken out lol, and steeping on my own trap never gets old lol I laugh about it every time

Dang, I'm toting a 85% disconnected rate as killer (disconnected 11/13 games). My internet is incredibly stable so I'm about certain it's not on my end.

Yeah, pretty much. I think it's super funny when survivers constantly deny kills but when their survival gets denied they flip their lids

Bitch this is English. You got a Mental problem or something. Also wglf is useless. Just bring in a blood point offering
---
i dont think so, if i get no sacrifices im just bad
---
Because it's not a SpongeBob meme.
---
yeah i meant unhooker
---
If anything, survivors are targeted more often than killers on this sub. Also, if survivors should get used to dying once in a while, killers should get used to not always getting 4ks. I know im fine dying even in 50% of my games, as long as they were fun, and I'm fine letting 3-4 survivors out sometimes if it was a good match. If you're gonna try to preach equality, actually be equal in your suggestions.

---
Top quality meme good sir
---
*chuckles* I'm in danger
---
Nah only morons think it‚Äôs toxic
---
And you‚Äôve prove. That you are incapable of seeing another‚Äôs point of view or opinion.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking video game. About basically a Hell dimension/limbo. But ok.
---
Ah I see it now.
---
What a game eh lol
---
Yes and no.
---
Yes, if you loop the killer for the sake of being looped and are not trying to actually escape
---
EDT: Short dumb version:
---
If you loop for more than a 1.5 minute, not trying to escape, it‚Äôs toxic. Lose the killer. Play mindgames.
---
Full version:
---
This is complex. Bear with me and try to think while reading this. If we assume that facecamping and teabagging is toxic, then looping is toxic as well, but it becomes toxic only if you loop only for the sake of being looped AND looping after three or more times on one pallet and do it on two or more pallets in a row before being hooked at least once. Infinite looping is super mega toxic. That‚Äôs it. Idk why‚Äôd you want to know it though, if doesn‚Äôt change anything
---
They really need to get rid of the 1 million BP cap, all these extra points coming in should‚Äôve been reason enough to raise the cap
---
I feel like his perks are underwhelming to be honest, surge feels like the only decent one
---
Added bonus: jacket off for full distraction.
---
Is turning the game on toxic?
---
How is trying to survive toxic?
---
I think he played pre buffed freddy
---
I changed it to Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Spine chill, and Bond because of exhaustion.
---
You have to edge your stalk until it's rock hard
---
*looks in direction of Alien vs Predator*
---
I disagree. Survivor is literally just doing what they need to survivor. If anything in that situation is toxic, its the killer that can't complete a chase and is only chasing one survivor the entire game.
---
That being said play how you wanna play.
---
To my anxiety it sure does feel like it yeah lol
---
Did you read my comment? *facepalm*
---
If people call facecamping toxic, then looping for minutes is toxic as well. In both situations player leaves other player with no power to do anything about it.
---
That could be it, but if I'm correct dedicated servers aren't on console, and my internet connection is pretty good. So it isn't any of those problems. Maybe just a new bug nobody encountered yet. Which I guess I what you were saying.
---
Shoulda brought your own Dwight then
---
I usually give it unless the survivors were toxic which I have a very small window of what I consider toxic. However.... sometimes you get that game where they‚Äôre just good survivors and you in your heart know they aren‚Äôt toxic but in the heat of the moment you‚Äôre like ‚ÄòHOW DARE THEY TRY TO LIVE‚Äô

You got the template for this?
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
They‚Äôve done multiple here already, probably trying to get some extra exposure
---
I pretty much do the same, i also have the added rules of noed and mori are for toxic survivors or dailies/challenges.
---
No because that's how you win lmao wtf
---
You are though. Your perks aren't helping you at all throughout the game, and your grading will be poor to show that.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems
---
Check the emblems. Getting to endgame too quickly, and mostly at all, is poor grading and is quite evident right here. This isn't a problem with those builds however. I wish that the emblem system didn't try to force you into a particular build pattern, but this IS how the system is designed to work. Thankfully they've made totems count towards your "objective" points now. But it's a drop in the bucket, and as far as time vs. grading goes. It's still the worst.
---
tl;dr: Getting to endgame as a killer is a failure to do your objective properly. You can't argue this. This is literally how the system is set.
---
Would there be any downside to putting them around different objectives? Thinking more along the lines of someone coming to unhook and healing at the hook, they both would have stalk already built up unless they cleared the camera before unhooking them and if the camera gave a notification when they got cleared it would just help people tunnel or proxy camp easier since you'd know when someone was going for the hook whether they clear the camera or not
---
When I look away from my screen for 0.01 seconds.
---
agree with all as a person who plays both evenly
---
Me with the spirit yesterday
---
That‚Äôs not possible for Ghostface from all the anti-depressants he‚Äôs taking because people loop him for the full 60sec of exposed
---
Yes, you actually understood what I was trying to say. And I don‚Äôt see how is this absurd though.
---
Killer that doesn‚Äôt want to give up a hooked survivor and survivors can‚Äôt do anything about it == survivors that don‚Äôt want to be hooked and a killer can‚Äôt do anything about it
---
If the map is the Yamaoka estate, you‚Äôre screwed
---
Would the AI work on gens and run from the killer or is it only going to be beneficial to the killer?
---
Don‚Äôt know about the first one apart that staring at him gets him out of his power and the second one is a perk that blocks 3 gens fro 120 seconds at the start of the game, it‚Äôs meant to slow the game down like ruin.
---
n...o...? it's annoying af when somebody's good at it, but it's how you win. killers need to learn to walk away from an engagement that's just wasting their time instead of blaming people for being good at the game.
---
My guy &lt;3
---
By default you hear the phase instead of her terror radius. New prayer beads will be like legions iridecent button
---
Run spine chill, it counters him because it gives you an alert that hes looking at you
---
Never understood this. You get caught healing in the corner and there's nowhere to go. You're down again. At least in the middle there's probably stuff to vault if you get caught.
---
This man's never been walkin before
---
That's why you don't actually expose them until you're mid chase and in range to hit
---
Huntress! That's not how the song goes
---
&gt; *Doesnt that make Prayer beads useless as the same as having no add on?*
---
No. Without the add-on you can either get into Terror Radius and have no Phasing sound, or Phase anywhere you like and give survivors an element of warning. The new Prayer Beads Bracelet will *always* play the sound, *everywhere*, so survivors will never know if they're safe or not.
---
Sounds like someone needs to remember that this is a game.
---
But Danny can‚Äôt edge HES ON ANTI DEPRESSANTS
---
Me sneaking into the kitchen at 3 AM for water and shredded cheese
---
Making it global lets you freak out all the survivors so it has value.. just not much.
---
The big question will be... do survivors in your terror radius hear it?  Because that completely breaks mindgames.
---
I like where this is going but make it so if she hits a survivor a gen gets poped
---
get pebble, babysitter, BT, and mettle of mann
---
Up to you. I typically give it to a guy that got shafted by bad teammates, or was good at the game without being an asshole, or seemed to be a lower rank than should be in my lobby. But it‚Äôs really up to you
---
Do you just want survivors to hide and do nothing, making the game mindnumbingly boring? I get rank 11 us hard, but stop bitching
---
just tunnel :&gt; they will blame you for it anyway
---
It's additive rather than multiplicative.  So regular grunts of pain are 100%. Iron will makes it 0% (100-100 = 0), and stridor makes them 150% louder, so 100 - 100 + 150 = 50% when injured.  This does mean that if you have iron will and no mither (no mither decreases it by 50%), even with stridor, you won't hear anything.
---
i think strider increases the sounds of breathing, not grunts of pain
---
Not saying your point was absurd, just that your method to convey it is called an ‚ÄúArgument to Absurdity.‚Äù
---
There is a whole lot of "I'm only toxic if..." going on in this post. Just don't be toxic. Move on to the next game and be a good person, it's really not hard.
---
Survivor*
---
No worries just letting you know
---
Yes, thank you.
---
It's additive before applied. So if someone has IW and killer has Stridor, grunts are reduced 50% (100%-50%).
---
You forgot to mention how between bloodpoint based and emblem based ranking system there was a victory cube and that straight up forced killers to tunnel to rank up
---
I disagree, and I‚Äôm not going to continue arguing the bs and semantics for the next 90 minutes with someone who‚Äôs trying to use ‚Äúold surveys‚Äù that likely never happened in the first place, and even if they did, are no longer relevant.
---
Np:)
---
If they are out of the game it counts, hook, mori, devour, bleed out and I think dcing also counts
---
Maybe not bleed out but Mori's should count, along with any perks that let you kill
---
But what do I do when it activates? Just run to a random direction and hope he won't reach me?
---
Not even a little bit.  It's something every good survivor needs to learn how to do if they plan on playing anywhere near Red Ranks.
---
Also, that person that was just hooked was on death hook. He didn't leave anyone behind.
---
By any means is just however you can. Sacrifice them, mori them, I'd imagine letting them bleed out would also count but if you can keep a survivor down long enough to bleed out you'd be better off just hooking them. You just need to get a 4k.
---
I perfectly understand it‚Äôs a game. A competitive game with two sides versus each other. I fully expect each side to try and win the game based on the agreed-upon game rules and mechanics.
---
You don‚Äôt play a game and purposely lose.
---
You don‚Äôt play monopoly and never buy property. You don‚Äôt play poker to lose cash. You don‚Äôt play basketball and purposely miss shots.
---
Why would you expect your opponent to not play to win even here?
---
Try and figure out where hes looking at you from, think like the killer and try to figure out the best vantage point, run sprint burst as well, as soon as spine chill goes off, book it
---
Sure it takes skill but who's saying it doesn't?
---
I got this challenge from having someone DC during loading. Literally anything counts with this one. 
---
But don't aim to slug someone 'til they bleed out, that's a nasty way to play.
---
What i was trying to say with my "breakdown" is that the effects of No Mither, Tenacity and Unbreakable can all be felt from time to time, they all affect your gameplay.
---
Meanwhile, flip flop has NEVER come into effect for me. And I have tried many times.
---
It's also easy to defend No Mither: you're almost guarenteed that the perk will affect your gameplay.
---
When I say "wasted perk slot" I don't mean that you could have put something better there, I mean that the perk slot could have been empty and nothing would have changed

He‚Äôs a well-groomed dog with expensive linen/fabrics in the background. He probably got a treat after these photos were taken. Dogs shouldn‚Äôt eat pizza anyway, and even still they have good senses of smell, so he knew there wasn‚Äôt any delicious hot pizza in that box beforehand anyway.

He‚Äôs fine. Does that make you feel better?
---
&gt; What‚Äôs the point of the servers then?

I've been asking the same thing.

no legion is fine no need to change anything

You gain objective points for doing gens, boldness points for chasing and totems

Yamaoka's Haunting doesn't normally have global sound. You only hear the "wooosh" sound when she's close. 
---
Old Prayer Beads used to remove this sound effect, new ones make it global instead. So instead of never hearing it, you'll hear it as if she's right next to you all the time.
---
Edit: to be clear, the reworked beads aren't live in the game yet.

Yeah dcs too, i got that one with 3 dcs and a sacrifice

dang thats a problem

No man it's cool. Those guys should play in tournaments they were able to bully a lower level non meta killer they are going to jerk off thinking about it tonight.

Ye play pc or console?

I have used that as survivor and the killer can definitely catch up to you after the second loop.
---
I'm salty right now lol. Just lost to a swf team because I decided to have fun and play wraith. I don't mind losing so much but getting hate afterwords pisses me off. Survivors want to bitch about only going against the same killers but this is why. When I get bullied and hated on for trying to have fun I'm just gonna stick with spirit and Billy and bring a mori every game.
---
lol yeah, like you know how good his life is.

I have used flip flop successfully many times before running the chad loadout. It‚Äôs a you problem.

To be honest it‚Äôs a good thing to stuck in purple.

I‚Äôm so confused what his is supposed to mean... The top bar is end game collapse I‚Äôm gonna guess?....

That would be a cool offering, actually

I did this challenge when somebody DCed while loading. Lmao

sorry i meant swearing at BHVR.... like Fuck BHVR etc some of the more popular streamers do it heaps which is likely why they're not FW's.
---
I wonder if that's why my account randomly got suspended for months. Lol jk. I'm still iffy about what events happened exactly--like if Evan got stuck in the mine--but I'm glad the archives clarified a lot! :)
---
You‚Äôre joking but I remember once on here somebody genuinely said no mither is a counter to noed. It was months ago and I still remember it because they were being 100% serious.
---
Except facecamping is even discouraged by the devs and punishes you for doing it while looping rewards you for doing it well and is even part of ranking up. Plus the killer will always eventually catch survivors because of mechanics like bloodlust and windows closing during a chase. I don't think there's a single combination of perks items and offerings that make it completely impossible to ever catch a survivor, but if a killer is facecamping you aren't going to get them off the hook because the killer can just immediately down them again and hook again. Whether or not it takes a long time to catch someone is up to players skill level and there are some nasty loops on maps, but part of playing killer is knowing when to drop a chase to find someone else. You could argue looping is toxic when the survivor does no other objective but chase the killer until they chase them and then loops them for minutes on end, but if they aren't doing anything else why would you chase after them, just go for someone who's actually trying to finish objectives while the other person follows you all game, at that point it's more toxic for their teammates than the killer
---
Rule 6 : no support post. You got a similar post about about this remove for this rule, so why post it again? Attention whore or something?
---
Archives + dailys has mucked up the gameplay so much for solo survivor. I just play swf now unless I'm prepared mentally to have troll games and not be so intent on winning.
---
This is so fucking funny. Killers never play along when I shuffle walk

That's good on you man. TBH after looking at the replies to this comment I think I'll definitely start giving hatch to anyone who has their teammates screw them with 2 DC's. 
---
As long as they don't T-bag non stop! I always let a t-bag "hello" slide, but if someone is non-stop bagging after every pallet drop, I will tunnel them and end them with a near 100% success rate... it's the only thing that gets me.
---
Just recently got my Adative Plague achievement just yesterday. It took me 6 4K's to finally get merciless killer. Yeah Plague is a bitch, and achievement is only a 0.08 unlock rate too.
---
I genuinely got carried in one game by Spies the other night. I was playing Billy so I couldn‚Äôt exactly hear every crow due to chainsaws and whatnot. I got two survivors caught thanks to it, one I straight-up hadn‚Äôt seen and the other was an immersed Claudette that was setting up for a pallet save. Nobody expects you to run it and that can totally fuck the survivors over if they don‚Äôt figure it out.
---
I mean, they're kinda right. Sure it has its uses and I don't think it should be removed from the game but it also promotes bad habits like playing too immersed and I hate watching someone urban evaisoning towards a hook even though the killer is miles away rather than running.
---
The worst is that survivors can dead hard, or edge around traps that trapper cannot avoid. It turns his own power into a barrier for HIM in a chase that completely throws it. So ridiculous.
---
So currently Yamaoka's Haunting CANNOT be heard if the survivor is in within the Spirits Terror Radius when activated. But if the survivor is outside the terror radius when activated the survivor will NOT hear it either unless the spirit gets close enough to the survivor within her terror radius as she phase by?
---
Now the current Prayer Beads phase sound is completely dead silent and the rework will make it a global phase sound regardless of where you are when its activated or where you are when shes phasing?
---
What a mean spirited post.
---
They actually said on stream that it‚Äôll be more like a year
---
I‚Äôm at 1 mil, rotating out one daily, and just spending 200k at a time and earning them back.
---
Personally, for me, it‚Äôs the matter that I don‚Äôt like being able to only unlock the teachables for one role right away once a new DLC drops. I play on PS4 so I don‚Äôt experience the PTB. When new content comes out, I wanna try both characters and perks out pretty quickly and I play both killer and survivor frequently. I like to experiment with mixing the new perks in with the current content right away and the BP cap forces me to choose one role for a while. 
---
Of course, I eventually earn the BP needed for the other role but for players (especially on console) that play both sides equally and don‚Äôt experience the PTB, it can be a bit of a bummer to feel restricted like that. I always buy the full DLC right away and I am happy supporting the game. It‚Äôs just a little nitpick I have.
---
Imagine not walkin‚Äô
---
The killer defends the one that's haunted grounds then the other 3 cleanse devour, ruin, and thrill. Feelsbad
---
boy I made this meme, it was stolen from ME and reposted XD
---
When you wanna charge Second Wind but they do .001 seconds of self heal when you start so you have a tiny sliver of charge left over before the perk is ready.
---
Try + not \*
---
"an act of meme" well thats going in the lexicon, lol
---
Yeah... Good luck winning and playing a non-meta killer.
---
Though I will stand by Plague being a really good killer, I think the will find a place in the meta in time.  Just needs some other killers to be toned down first...
---
That statement instantly made me think of seeing survivors doing dabs at the exit gate and as a killer main I have never before been so annoyed and horrified in my days.
---
It didn't have the "never lose this key ever" add ons, so 10 to 1 it's someone running plunderers and aith to get a free escape every other match.
---
I really love how the change to Dedicated Servers made it so you can't walk over your own traps after placing them when you could before. It's especially nice since more-often-than-not you literally stun yourself for using your power.
---
Depends on the intent of the loop! It's not toxic to play the game and try to survive. Looping is a strategy. Are you tea bagging and being a dick while looping? That's more so toxic if you ask me. Just like face camping and smacking a survivor on the hook comes off as toxic.
---
Nobody says Billy is op besides boosted rank 1s
---
In my opinion it would be a bad idea to fuck with Billy. I think he's the most balanced killer in the game. A strong M2 but can still be countered and looped but a good Billy will still land saws at loops.
---
I say this as someone who plays both sides but I do consider myself a survivor main and I love going against a Billy because he's strong but fair.
---
No, I think that was bad wording. It says:  
---
" The Spirit currently retains her phasing speed for a short period of time after exiting her power before returning to her normal 4.4m/s movement speed. We have altered this curve to be more gradual, similar to The Wraith. "  
---
So she just doesn't maintain the speed she had as much as before.
---
Legion has the best power because their power to vault pallets is countered by vaulting pallets.
---
God i love maining clown, it's fun to break looper's spirits. &lt;3
---
Hope this isnt stolen
---
Here‚Äôs an idea, it‚Äôs complicated but maybe you‚Äôll get it, the people asking for those things are different people.  I know crazy right?
---
The thing is both of those perks as they stand pop off of catching a survivor and being able to hook them (downing them and picking them up), if you manage to down more than one person and pick them up in the time those are on cooldown then you've already slowed the game down once with the perks, once with the first person being hooked (unless they got saved by DS, flashlight, or pallet), and then another time by getting the next person down and hooked. It's especially bad if you end up downing and hooking someone when they get the first person off the hook because then you've kept half their team off the objective while the perks slowed down the objectives even more. I think the time it takes to actually catch and down someone is enough of a cooldown for those two perks, I just wish that surge had a bigger range since often enough it barely hits one gen when you manage to pop it anyways. Personally I think it would snowball too much if someone made a bad call if they could just pop those perks again since surge would break a gen almost 40% from two pops
---
9/10 Killers Tunnel and Camp on ps4
---
Sorry wont do tier list again :(
---
This is why I stopped using Exhaustion perks, they're practically gimmicks considering they catch up anyways.
---
Play with your food perhaps?
---
And instantly the percentage of female killer mains quadruples üòÅ
---
Hit the nail on the head. Why did people want all those survivor perks/mechanics you listed nerfed? Because there is no counter play to them. People suggest that there is no reliable counter play to Spirit, that Omega Nurse is op etc and they‚Äôre entitled cry baby man child survivor mains. I genuinely can‚Äôt believe some people are not even 1% self aware lol. I say this as a 50/50 player, a minority of hardcore killer mains are the most unbearable group of people in any community I‚Äôve ever seen. Always the victims, not even slightly self aware.
---
Typically the people I see running urban evasion are just crouching around the outside of the map looking for ruin the whole game, gen tapping (because they still somehow never find the ruin), and self caring every time they get hit lol. Effectively making it a 3v1 instead of 4v1

Wait a minute‚Ä¶Is that the song for ribbit the game on the wii?

That still wouldn‚Äôt make sense for me to do given my first comment, but I appreciate it lol

write "gg wp", its usually the most they need, an actual confirmation that the match was good, and you have each others respect.

Plot twist is that the killer is legion.
---
Play with your food is a hell of a drug

Same on PC below red ranks

We get it, you're a virgin.

Nice

It‚Äôs the worst thing in the game right now imo

Cause why not honestly. I assumed the hatchets would work so I wasn‚Äôt really worried about using a one :/

Santa Suit is hands downs the worst as the placement of the maggots makes me faint and I die every time I see a killer in on.

You lucky bastard. consistent 32k black pip is literally ideal.
---
Personally, my experience is the closer I am to rank 20, the more likely I'll see a killer that camps people on hook. Perhaps if you haven't played survivor in a while, your survivor level isn't far from 20?
---
I usually play solo in purple, and sometimes red ranks, and almost no killers camp at those levels.
---
As for challenges, aside from an increase in Trappers, and a few people insisting on self caring here and there, I haven't noticed much in the way of changed behaviour. I don't feel like I'm dying any more than I usually would.
---
Most of the challenges don't really promote toxic or shitty play. I could see the odd person slamming pallets early in a chase, or maybe some basement patrolling, but other than that,maybe you're just running in to newer killers or killers who can't rank up due to their play style.
---
You should leave him be to have his own opinion and you shouldn‚Äôt bother him about it.

r/technicallythetruth
---
Always a hard decision...but the win is so tempting
---
To be fair, if it really was all 5 gens, there‚Äôs no reason for them to leave the hook, and it DID work for him in the end if what you said is true.
---
It sucks, but the sometimes the best option is to let a player die. Killer depips and gets matched with players he‚Äôs more suited for in chases, and the other 3 escape.
---
Edit: EG rescue is also killer dependent, as well as if you have BT. Some killers can still put you in an unfortunate checkmate however, like Leatherface
---
HillBilly is fine. Do something about Forever Freddy instead.
---
It never occurred to me that PC players can't walk. Master race, my ass.

I remember seeing a dbd animated video of if emotes were added into the game with it having claudette doing that stupid clown take the L dance at exit gate, then showing trapper facecamping her doing the same. Its awful

You need to kill all 4 with the tombstone add on. Mori or sacrificing won‚Äôt work.

---
Sorry, but BP is BP, challenges are challenges, and dailies are dailies. 90% of Survivors wouldn't offer me a free kill at the end of a match, so why should I offer them a free escape?
---
I honestly love that, I think it's supper cool, it's just I hyper focus on the crotch maggots and open fly.
---
i meant if the killer is appearing offline :)
---
I have a build I call Terminator Myers with infinite tier 3, bamboozle, spirit fury, enduring and any fourth perk of your choosing. There‚Äôs just no escape.

Correct and it‚Äôs very difficult to achieve, took me a few days of trying but I got it and got it again because I was screwing around with my totem Myers
---
Pharmacy Quentin, run pharmacy, sprint burst, adrenaline, and empathy, burn a coin for 2 more chests to loot, and thats all, deliver heals and medkits everywhere.
---
Plague is a bit of an oddball when it comes to perks. Perks that are meta on some killers (Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling) are **terrible** on her due to survivors being able to just cleanse and heal instantly; other perks like Thanatophobia and Stridor (more so the former than the latter, but that‚Äôs just my personal opinion) actually suit her well. Admittedly, Thana is still a weaker perk, but the slowdown and the red bar sometimes fucks with survivors heads and ‚Äúforces‚Äù a cleanse. 
---
For addons, I personally prefer her Ametic series (Vile Purge is more potent per spew): break them quicker during a chase, down them faster, and snowball. Large maps in general aren‚Äôt the best for her (or for any killer without a movement ability of some sort).
---
Yooo did you really delete that comment?! Loool bro get a clue
---
That's Small Might, not All Might though.
---
Urban Evasion is a good perk but a lot of people either:
---
**A.** Rely on it way too much.
---
**B.** Use it when they really don't need to.
---
~~**C.** Both.~~
---
I fell quite firmly into the A camp which is why I stopped using it. It's very helpful but I found that often it ended up being a crutch that made me go for sub-optimal plays. There were times that it saved me and times now that I wish I was using it (cough Hag cough) but quite often it was a waste of a perk slot.
---
Urban Evasion is Sprint Burst lite, in a lot of ways. People who use it often don't know when they should be sprinting or when they should be walking. At least with Urban it's more that people feel like they should get use out of their perk (as opposed to Sprint Burst where people don't want to waste it, and then end up ironically wasting its potential) but fact still stands that someone Urban Evading everywhere is just as bad as someone walking everywhere to hold onto Sprint Burst.
---
People seem to forget Urban's quote: *"The paint is still fresh but I'm long gone."* Urban is good to evade the Killer in situations where your trail is fresh and you wouldn't be able to evade normally. But outside of those situations regular crouched movement speed is enough. You move at 28.25% movement speed while crouched normally, which is usually enough to evade the Killer if you're smart. While Urban can be helpful in very clutch situations you're far better off running a more generally useful perk that has more applications overall, or a stronger general-case use.
---
Most contexts where Urban would've helped can be avoided by running stronger detection perks (Spine Chill, ~~Worse Spine Chill~~ Premonition) or stronger stealth perks that are more generally applicable (Iron Will, Lightweight, Fixated.) Even excluding perks to help you avoid situations that Urban combats there are still a lot of incredibly strong perks that you won't have a slot to equip if you're running Urban: Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, Exhaustion Perks - that's already 4 perks, and you're going to have to give up one to bring Urban.

But the game can still progress because the other players can finish the last gen and trigger end game collapse.

Holding the game hostage is when the game literally cannot continue. This game can. What the Huntress did was scummy as hell, but it is not what you are describing.
