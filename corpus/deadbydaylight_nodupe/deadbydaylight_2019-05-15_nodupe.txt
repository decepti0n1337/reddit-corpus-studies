IKR why use all of the basic bitch perks when you can mess around with others.

That tattoo is badass! Tell him it looks great :)

DONT HURT MEG

SHES TOO PRECIOUS
---
This is a joke right? RIGHT?!
---
You don’t have to be a fan of hiding in lockers to use them effectively against BBQ. If you’re near one when someone is downed just hop in and count 4 seconds after the hook and hop back out. Otherwise you can run distortion but those tokens usually get eaten up fast as fuck. Or you can walk around and fake directions to get the killer going one way while you go the other or just eat the aura reading and be ready for a chase if it happens.
---
OH DO YA!?
---
You would get a medkit the emits light covering the entire map blinding all survivors and killer. If ran with ace in the hole it would get that but with a brown battery
---
I mean Dead By Daylight on Roblox is more popular than Dead By Daylight itself.

I now use traps in early-mid game although it itself is a pain in the ass. Typically in my high ranked killer games ruin goes after 1-2 gens are done, this is when I would have previously used my traps to further extend the game... Now that it's gone, it feels wrong to use her traps when Ruin is still up. Removes a lot of what she did, feels really shit and her games are shorter than ever.
---
Perks I use vary regularly, however, Ruin is the only one I have in every game/build due to games being too fast. Anyone who disagrees doesn't play with Good Survivors.
---
Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher and Enduring
---
Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Enduring and Spirit Fury
---
Ruin, Thanatophobia, Enduring and Spirit Fury
---
Ruin, BBQ, Thanatophobia and Brutal Strength
---
Ruin, BBQ, Sloppy Butcher and Brutal Strength

Changes through those a lot, I've tried Remember Me, NoeD among others and it's just not good for me personally.
---
If you want to know my Addons for the RBTs I usually do:
---
Face Mask (Blindness) and Last Will (+1 RBT)
---
Jigsaw's Sketch (+1 Jigsaw Box) and Last Will
---
Jigsaw's Sketch and Tampered Timer (Reduced Time for Trap to Kill Survivor)
---
Jigsaw's Sketch and Crate of Gears (Longer Box Search, Quicker Trap Application)
---
Crate of Gears and Tampered Timer
---
All work well, but my personal favourite is the first one I said.
---
I'm so trying that now

Nah, that survivor is definitely telling you to kielbasa your sausage. They're obviously a linked meat connoisseur.
---
As killer I’ll almost never farm unless I feel really bad that some people got shitty teammates (DCs, obvious farming, etc.) because I’ve been there and those games aren’t fun as survivor. On the survivor side I always appreciate a killer willing to farm because it’s a rare occurrence and nice break from the normal game, plus is easy bloodpoints. But if it happens too much (usually during bloodhunts) it gets super boring though.
---
If ur feeling brave.... monitor and abuse nurses calling,thanaphobia and save the best for last ( you can swap out thanaphobia for sloppy butcher or just us the addon for their power to add mangled effect) build works well with slugging people very early and stoping the team from healing

I never notice the killer until I'm being carried away from Jane.

I misunderstood door powering to mean opening. Yes, it's a free door powering which doesn't matter much when they're close enough for any killer to patrol both in half the time it takes to open them. Yes NOED can be prevented or disabled in a normal game (Which is why I think it's very well balanced around a normal game) but there's no way to do it in a hatch game. If you need to get hatch then chances are that your team did some stupid stuff and you didn't have time to cleanse dulls, and once the collapse starts you don't have time to find/cleanse the hex and still open a door. You should still have a chance to escape since that's the entire purpose of the hatch and the collapse, though that doesn't mean that you should be guaranteed an escape. NOED currently makes it impossible unless the killer is blind/deaf or you get insanely lucky, if they changed it to trigger when the last gen is powered then the killer still holds the advantage but the survivor still has a small chance of escaping.
---
Nah nah nah, take out NOED and turn it into Sloppy. Yeaaaaahhh
---
why does hilarious stuff like this never happen to me:/
---
wow thanks for the really detailed response (kudos to the other responders as well) and yeah I've been noticing/doing pretty much what you said. games go by too fast bc of gen tappers or ruin just straight up going down and bc her endgame potential is out the door and even using traps at early game feels like im not doing much so its like... now what? also is thana decent now? I've played this game for a long time and im still having trouble wrapping my head around it being good, although tbf I haven't tried it at all and just ignore it in my webs
---
So I understand perhaps not/unable to heal against a Plague, but why wouldn't you heal against a Legion?
---
It can, but its also too easy to get out of traps. His traps are just..bad
---
There is actually a lot of nice people, I only run into a handful of super toxic people when I play, and I'll usually play for multiple hours a day. It's just people only lost the toxic side of the community so that's all you see.
---
It's not just you. I can't purchase either.
---
What about food...?
---
Yeah I agree, at least without add-ons.
---
Because if you're full health and he sees you, you're just going to instantly get hit with feral frenzy again. Yes you can dodge it, but 9/10 times its an easy first hit for him. Him hitting you with frenzy also alerts him of any nearby teammates, allowing him to apply more pressure to them as well. A lot of legions run sloppy butcher, which makes self caring take well over 30 seconds. That's 30 seconds you could be spending on a gen. Even if he has Thanatophobia, it only adds 12 seconds to the gen time (80 x 1.16 = 92) if all 4 players are injured. Its the same reason you shouldn't heal against an insta-saw billy. If you're fully health, situations where you're going to get M1'd are situations where you probably would get chainsawed as well. In the end, it's just a waste of time
---
I just saw a new post saying they can't purchase from the shrine either so it's not just you. Sit tight for now, I'm sure the devs will have the fix out soon.
---
Thanks for the quick feedback ;) Good to know
---
[removed]
---
Which is the tier list, without perks and addons. With add ons then i think LF is worse cause his power doesnt give him like anything
---
&gt; you do totems even tho NOED has no indicator
---
Not sure where you learned that from. The time it takes to cleanse dull totems isn't worth the chance at cleansing every single one so NOED doesn't pop. Huge waste of time, especially considering you're only likely to find the more obvious totems (which are exactly the ones you would want NOED to show up on).
---
&gt;So it sounds like the perk is doing its job really well then? It's effect is strong enough that the immediate thought is to abandon the chase.
---
It should be balanced around extending the chase, not making the chase so long that the Killer in a 4v1 asymmetrical horror game about Survivors fleeing from a Killer, decides to pussy out and walk away with his tail between his legs because he's just that weak.
---
Is that a pregnancy test??
---
I've only had these issues as killer but today it seems like a good day for me
---
Nope, works fine for me. Try restarting your game.
---
I read an awesome forum post one time that tried to canonized toxic behavior and did a damned good job.
---
The story went that the survivors knew they were stuck, so toxic behavior was to fuck with the entity.
---
I want killer voice lines...
---
The pools reset when theres no more available pools for survivors to cleanse, it also gives you corrupt purge on the spot when they resets.
---
Whatchu say about my momma????
---
The good old days of getting vault looped, and meg and claudettes op Perks and Jake breaking all my hooks...
---
would it be fine if i re-created the map in sfm?
---
There are more people having problems like me tho. The only think that comes to mind is one of BHVR's "spontaneous dedicated servers tests" that they said would roll out randomly after PTB to random players.
---
What’s a guy gotta do to get these incredible designs in his game, eh?
---
*Hits the bloodwarden gate* I think we have problem
---
YES! Polnareff hair for Leatherface! MAKE IT HAPPEN, PEOPLE!!
---
Read my post. I’ve ONLY experienced this as killer, and i STILL think it’s unfair
---
I did. 3 times.
---
I think it affects the items you get but it would be near impossible to test or not very beneficial since it would still be inconsistent, plunders should be more than enough to get good items from chests.
---
Mettle of Ogre
---
Any yet they could easily ignore it and let the person enjoy their new tattoo.
---
Exactly! Someone who finally realizes that facecamping is just as bad for the killer as the survivors, the killer wastes so much time just waiting for 1 person to die rather than chasing others off of gens. Facecamping only counters survivors when they let it counter them, or if they REALLY can't go without that single teammate. I get facecamped so much, and I get angry that my teammates either try and sandbag/farm me and unhook me in front of the killer just to get put back on, i'd rather them do gens and save themselves
---
Mettle of man is really dumb, I say it should be an exhaustion perk
---
Once when I'm being chased, bam dead hard into a window, he gets close again mom. A little later into the chase Adrenaline.
---
The fact that these things can stack to me, is really dumb. Mom all it really takes is 1 hook + 1 heal.
---
But what if they predicted the people who were gonna predict how predictable they were. Outpredicted
---
&gt;  Is there a new killer tier chart for the killers?
---
no, but zubat or fungoose will probably tell you something like: 
---
1. Nurse
---
2. Billy/Spirit
---
3. Everyone else
---
at the end of the day though, just play what you have the most fun playing.
---
Then, if nobody thinks about how 2 of those perks are still good without getting a "head on" play, you sound smart. /s
---
It appears that not everyone is having this issue though. I submitted a ticket to BHVR though.
---
Oh yeah, now you have to take 2 steps forward to see the lit totem 5 meters from spawn. Fixed.
---
If there was a good perk that helped the last survivor, it would be meta.
---
I just did on Xbox. It worked fine for me.
---
[Maybe its just because you're ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9JGzBdfkp0)
---
Correction: The Doctor is actually saying "I see everything"
---
I saw a video like this a while ago lol. Except it was with nurse that picked up an Ace but he was on the floor and it looked like he was throwing a tantrum lol
---
That's why bloodwarden can be good. It's literally the only reason it can be any good at all.
---
Try to down as many people as you can before the last gen is done. But you should probably start using your beartraps when at least 2 gens are done
---
Thank you :)
---
Will you make all killer pictures? If so, I would apreciate a download link.
---
There's a comment with a download link somewhere in the comments
---
Awesome. Thanks, my dude
---
This picture has J A C K S O N V I L L E written all over it!

---
What do you mean? He’s right. This game is currently more balanced towards survivors side.
---
Yes please
---
Hand got caught on the hook.
---
That’s better but still leaves so many issues with that perk. Bring yourself and insta heal and you’ll completely negate its downside. Getting that 1 hook + 1 heal means that during your second chase you’ll get hit twice, insta heal (this activating the aura reading until you are downed again) then have to get two more times that you absolutely didn’t earn. Adding exhaustion negates the use of a few other perks but would you really need them after wasting so much of the killers time? Probably not. 
---
Now that’s not a scenario that happens every game but that doesn’t negate how fucking dumb of a perk that is, because it’s stupidly strong when multiple survivors run the perk, and how badly it needs a rework (not a nerf, a fucking rework) ASAP.
---
MEG YOU SLIME
---
Yeah I'll probably do that. I will be making all the killers :)
---
F
---
Why the fuck are survivors so damn toxic? I'm fr about to just start tunneling and camping hooks with bubba's chainsaw 🙄...
---
Ps4 or PC?
---
holy yesss
---
If that were the case they’d have to nerf the whole meta on both sides
---
i might actually give it a try then, thanks for the advice
---
Is it a Mori ritual? I had one for doc and the last guy DCing while he was slugged waiting for the last hooked guy to die so I could Mori him with a Cypress Mori, asshole. As cheesy as this strategy sounds you could bring Rancor, and simply follow the obsession without hitting him for 5-gens, then insta-down and Mori him. They might not realize you're running Rancor and there's no secret offering so they won't suspect a Mori.
---
I have a similar issue, on my laptop everything is just a bit brighter for me I would suggest sending the image to yourself on your phone a few times while you’re coloring to make sure it looks ok
---
Why do people say "Don't heal against Legion/Plague"? Red rank at peek but I stay in purple/green now because that's not a fun rank to be at. Anyway, whenever I do play as those killers and people don't heal it's just a 4 man slug fest. Just want to know the method to the madness.
---
No you basically start at level 1 like a new player
---
Someone should test this in kill your friends, 4 up the antes and 4 jars of vigo should make the 50% chance into a 100% chance to find a 2° add on. Anyone can test this? :^)
---
And doing generators isn’t? Wtf lmao
---
Neither. He's from Northern England, possibly Yorkshire.
---
Okay - too bad that it's only two perks, but I'll keep an eye out.  If worst comes to worst, I can work on leveling the Doctor up to level 35.  I mainly use Michael Myers, so I was hoping to get a series of perks that could make him extremely stealthy -  it might not be the most effective build, but it should be fun to play as, and hopefully scare/surprise some of the people that I'm playing against.
---
Is wake up worth getting for those egc situations? I know it’s a very niche perk. Opening gates 5% faster doesn’t sound like much but could it make a difference?
---
You're welcome keep up the great work
---
Why wouldn't you do 1/10 5/10 4/10?
---
 NOED me boy, I need you to get me secret  survivor salt formuler
---
How about trying to have fun?
---
That's a load of shit and You know it. If ur ruin was caught early it's because they were actively looking for it, not bc ur totem spawned in a shitty place. Do you want ur hex Totems to last the whole trial now? Should we give all Hex Totems the NOED treatment and let them move to another totem if the one they are originally set to be in gets cleansed?
---
As a Scottish person myself I can tell you that he's not Scottish.
---
English but not sure where.
---
Roll 2 d6 to teabag.
---
well there's nothing really giving it away that it's a joke
---
How about we remake pharmacy into a perk that allows you to choose the item you are going to get with a random rarity.
---
Short male survivors when?
---
Telling someone to go kill themselves is absolutely unacceptable and it’s honestly absurd people aren’t punished for it.
---
Ok, sorry for have diferent opinions:)
---
You don’t but you counter the first third thus upping your chances of survival
---
Some people have fun playing the way they play, it’s a casual game after all
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
No, you commented, deleted it, then commented again. That's recommenting.
---
For Legion: Legion's ability only lets them put you into the bleed state, like BT. The ability just "injures" you and you need a regular M1 swing to take the survivor down. So if you're injured, you won't go into the dying state when Legion uses Frenzy on you. Not healing just saves time to punish Legion's weak ability.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Plague: Well the fountains full heal, so just use them instead of healing.
---
Crows/the horse on clown’s map
---
She has never been in less danger.
---
No, you shouldn’t get points for not doing anything
---
Nice, the only perk I cared for in Jeff’s teachable.
---
Thank you. I’m asking in the situation where there are multiple gens left. Like before, I would usually let myself die so long as the other survivor wasn’t a dick or worthless. Now I’m not sure if it is better chance for someone to survive if I get saved or still let them try for the hatch.
---
I agree with the nurses thing but MOM is worse than old DS
---
Map design has always been a big deal in this game. It's only getting attention now that in one specific scenario, survivors get kinda screwed by it. Get the picture?
---
New legion sucks because his power is now just trash. Every other killer has some ways to influence the chase by their power even by a little but legion? Nothing.
---
Also not mentioning the fact that behavior just killed his unique style and instead threw in not so unique style of walking up to the survivors and m1ing.
---
Does anyone know what causes this glitch? It’s funny as shit.
---
Couldn't the same be said for Agitation though?  It counters the same purpose
---
Not op, nurse is op, billy is just able to gain a lot for very little, but not op
---
Wish the nightmare realm looked like the boiler room!
---
There's other map design flaws that have rightfully been getting attention as well due to killer players actually saying something instead of shitposting like a child- as you are now .
---
Good players don't need small size and camouflage
---
IIRC its after a stun or attack action (inc. kicking pallets).
---
&gt; recommenting
---
*recommended
---
Hah tell me about it.
---
I agree with ur post, but it is still salt
---
It's an Idea. However, there's two problems:
---
1. The name "The Voorhees" sounds stupid, no offense. If there was a Jason/Pamela Killer, I would prefer the name to be "The Slasher".
---
2. Jason Voorhees and Pamela actually CAN'T be added in right now, due to a lawsuit in the F13 franchise preventing anything related to F13 to be produced. If there wasn't, F13 the game would still be pumping out content.
---
Wholesome
---
Aftercare is for the first time in the shrine! Hope people buy it to see how useful and helpful it is :)
---
See this is why I defended Surviviors when I saw EGC. I knew my side of the community was gonna be full of toxic little shitheads. 
---
Of all the people in the world who would hold a hand out to people who are now getting abused, you would think it would be the ones who have previously been abused. But no. Killers like you, who dance on the grave of well meaning Surviviors bc you finally got even more of a way to screw them over, are what gives killers like me who try to be as non-toxic as possible a bad fucking name. 
---
Instead of empathy and "I understand what ur going through. Let's join together and pressure BHVR into fixing this" it's just "haha see how it feels now". That isn't productive and it's contributing to the divide in this community. 
---
And lemme guess, ur someone who hates toxic Surviviors. Guess what fuels their fire and makes them seem legit to non toxic Surviviors? Toxic killers. The more of an asshole you are, the more you divide this community. 
---
Like Trapper says. We focus too much on what makes us different and not what makes us similar. We all came to this game because we want to have fun. And neither side should be jumping for joy and pissing on the grave of others bc now they aren't having fun anymore.
---
*loose*
---
tier 3 is 15% faster. That's the same as bamboozle. 15% isnt alot but it seems a lot faster.
---
He's a northerner. So neither.
---
What is the Plague’s ms while holding her vomit at the ready?
---
He just means that no one cares how many hours you have, doesn’t make ur point any better and often makes you seem entitled, I recommend just stating the point and not adding the “I’m this so I know what I’m talking about”
---
Fuck yes we did. How do you think the EGC came around lmao.
---
First mistake: PLAYING AS LEGION!
---
This is all kinds of messed up.
---
Discordance counters itself, generators get done more efficiently with one survivor per generator until the point in the game where it doesn't matter anymore; also "Tinkerer" is labeled with counterplay? You can't counter Tinkerer, it always goes off, you can only play around when it goes off.  
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring are similar if they're having to break pallets, particularly since the counterplay is to not go for the stun.
---
Predator is countered pretty heavily by Urban Evasion or Lightweight.
---
Monstrous Shrine is labeled "no counterplay" even though several "area avoidance" perks are labeled "with counterplay"; Infectious Fright and Nurse's Calling generally involve positioning away from the threat - and if that's avoiding the general basement area, so what?
---
BBQ and Dying Light and Rancor have counterplay but Remember Me doesn't? There are quite a few ways around Remember Me, especially if you survive.
---
Fire Up has a huge amount of counterplay, given that a killer can't keep everyone off generators and the bonus to regression still leaves the perk worse off than Ruin. Just because you can't remove the bonus from Fire Up doesn't mean the perk doesn't have counterplay.
---
Bloodhound is really only if you're color blind in the red spectrum, so it doesn't seem particularly relevant because it exists to account for a design flaw (no colorblind mode) and by all accounts if you're not color blind you don't even need the perk; I'd question whether 'no measurable improvement if you can see red' makes the perk itself matter. **Additionally just don't get hit? You say Thanatophobia has counterplay when the counterplay is to heal up/don't get it, but Bloodhound is handled the same way - you have to get hit and not heal up.**
---
I could probably go on, but this list seems to have some major double standards.
---
Overcharge = Hit the Skill Check.
---
Dying Light = Literally don't die, your altruism speed as the Dying Light obsession is increased, telling you to go full-on-fucking-immersive; you know how hard it is to find someone locker hopping, it takes hours. (Literally, those Claudettes that dragged matches on for 9 or 10 hours were a real thing after all).
---
Like the black lock escape hatch? The entity is not as all powerful as we think if it wasn't able to remove the hatch. All the tools and stuff too.
---
You act like every Survivior main came together and decided on this grand conspiracy to bully all the poor killer mains and shove them in lockers and take their lunch money. Not every Survivior main is toxic, there are a metric shit load that are just playing Survivior bc they like it or they wanna have fun playing the game and they like Survivior more. Acting like they all deserve to suffer for this is contributing to the divide in this community. 
---
Your solution shouldn't be to piss on their grave. And if that is your solution, you should not be welcome in this community. 
---
But sadly my community is stereotyped as a bunch of crybabies who want free 4ks and sadly it's not for no reason so you're fitting in just fine you entitled little twat.
---
Soap. I'm going to lose my mind over this.
---
ooo gotcha for overcharge and lmfaooo honestly with dying light when that shit pops up on my screen im like: oh shit.. time to crouch everywhere. 
---
meanwhile im in a bright ass blue shirt.
---
It's not the tagging that's bothering me it's the not leaving and wating at the exit gates till you chase them out.
---
You won I lost, let me move on to the next game...
---
Yeah if he's tunneling or camping someone he's not getting a BBQ stack
---
I do. Lol. Still not okay for anyone to do
---
Nah. They run noed so we run things to counter it. If we didnt have to worry on noed we wouldn't have to run MoM or ds.

Really? I was sure you needed to purchase Chapter 3: Of Flesh and Mud.  
---
Unless you're talking about PS4 specifically.
---
Bro I had a pig match where anytime anyone was injured, they'd T-pose instead. Funniest match I've ever had
---
&gt;  That's how most of them get their ranks back 
---
Camping is a bad strategy though? Like I get that it sucks for the one person but that should be an easy 3-4 gens rights off the bat if the killer chases then camps one person.
---
Survivors shouldn't feel safe while you're looping, you're being chased by a maniac who wants nothing more than to kill you. And I'm afraid that implementing something that allows you to run and throw pallets down at the same time would only bring back the pallet vacuum (even if only a little bit, which shouldn't happen at all).
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
The issue with SWF is that it was a cat let out of the bag and now it can never be put back in. Honest to God I agree with Ann Coulter for once but I'm gonna apply it here. 
---
"Once the cats out of the bag you aren't getting it back in, that's why prohibition failed". It's the same thing here. SWF was let out of the bag and now it can't be put away without the game literally dying. 
---
But the issue is that unless BHVR makes a giant overhaul to how Soloq works, they aren't gonna be able to do shit about it. 
---
I'd propose an optional VC for soloq once dedicated servers are here, as well as the killer knowing who is in a SWF group (as well as other Surviviors of course) and then start balancing the game around Surviviors being a coordinated team. Leave wiggle room for the soloq players without comms, but move the game more in a team direction
---
Its because nurses main are all over this subreddit and they care more about their little self objectives like winning a non challenging game over the current state of the game ...  also you cant have a different opinion than others arounds this parts
---
indeed! im still bummed out about it though the other exit gate was to his left pretty close but he didn’t notice it T^T
---
Xbox too. I didnt have to buy hag. The ultimate edition included every dlc up to huntress when it launched. Then everything after her came out after I believe.
---
Well… you are allowed to use it… just like how survivors are allowed to destroy your dull totems to stop NO: ED from popping off in the first place
---
The frenzy fatigue ones do stack but the only ones worth it are Cold dirt with Joey’s and those two still only take 1 second off the total so running only one is pretty much unnoticeable. 
---
The only really semi decent ones are the pins especially the green pin and brown pin. Ooh that’s a sexy combo. Iridicent Button is really fucking good now but the fact that almost all the other addons in that rarity Tier are poop speaks volumes. I do like that I can use my blades again cause I have like 40-50 of each one from not using them for so long but mostly they just need more variety in the addon area. Franks Mix Tape is fucking garbage as well as Stab Wounds Study and they should have gotten a facelift with Legion too. Hopefully we can have some fog whisperer talk to BE about it.
---
I'm not the one telling people who have legit complaints about EGC to get over it and that it's a taste of their own medicine. Or that it serves them right for how horribly other fucking treated you. 
---
But you are. And you saying that contributes to the toxicity in this community. So fuck off with it bc it shouldn't be fucking welcome here.

Hitboxes haven't been "fixed" since this game has released(They have gotten better, however).  
---
While I've never used a controller for this game before, I've watched others play with it and it doesn't seem like they have the same problem as you - having to stop holding sprint. Maybe try playing around with your keybinds?
---
Her dash is also useful in loops
---
It’s very niche but has its uses. I put it on last game cause I was running a support build and managed to escape because of it. If I wasn’t running that perk to open the gates a bit faster the Pig would’ve killed me. However as you said it’s very niche and in 90% of your games you’ll be playing with 3 perks
---
If they took away noed we wouldn't need MoM.
---
As long as auras are still visible
---
Captain Spaulding is the clown killer I always wanted lol
---
I believe the hatch,  tools and exit gates are there to inspire hope in the Survivors with which the Entity sustains itself. It is stated that the Survivors exist in a temporal loop, when they escape or die in a trial they are placed again at the start of another trial or perhaps they go to the campfire.
---
I'm sorry but this is just dumb. You have plenty of perks to escape wiggles too.
---
What part of AsYmEtRiCaL game don’t you understand.
---
Its possible they got a 4k and the survivors D/C'd on hook as they always do.
---
dumbass meg shining a flashlight at nothing and wasting it smh
---
You can throw the pallet while running. What you're experiencing I believe is that you need to be closer to the pallet than you may be during that chase before you can it down with the killer on one side and you safely on the other.
---
Happens to me often where I can't throw it because the game registers that I'm not pass the middle point (or something) so the pallet stays up. Even had it drop and knock killer to the side I am on while still getting downed and getting the stun.
---
The hatch was a survivor invention it's in the lore. Vigo had a huge lab where he did experiments and made things. That doesn't sound like what the entity wanted. If it was the entity would have made it right?
---
Awfully rude of him to propose that to you.
---
Monto has discovered that the entity can also trap lizard people in its realm
---
Killer are way more disadvantaged tho
---
cries in legion
---
He actually has played dbd before on his channel too, though it was back when Mikey released I think
---
I just got gen rushed by a survive with friends that had skeleton key plus the add-on that makes you not lose it on death, don't have much to do with this ig but I just wanna complain bc fuck that dude I'm salty as hell I just wanted a Freddy game.
---
we need james as a survivor! that would be awesome
---
Okay well can I hear your reasoning? 
---
I’m not saying if I agree or disagree but just saying they are doesn’t do anything, we need to talk about specifics
---
Ignore the ''im live'' text at the end!  
---
A montage I did of some glitches we found!  
---
It's on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciTl7r_UksM) aswell!
---
Hope you guys liked it! :)
---
Yes I believe so. Haven’t played in a little while so not entirely sure
---
The ultra rare seems a bit op but I like this idea
---
No.  
---
Summer 2019, as we were told.  
---
Probably *late* summer
---
You can interpretate wharever u want on the way u want, i said i have 2400 hours because i have experience playing the game, i never said i was good, lr great
---
Laughs in Amanda's letter.
---
Cries in both versions of legion.
---
Dedicated servers are not released.
---
That would be cool theirs so many possibilities they could do !
---
Once you master it, survivors dc
---
I know but saying that just makes you seem entitled, that’s all I’m saying, no one actually cares about ur hours
---
Sorry, my main lenguage is not english, that hurt u?
---
MoM is almost impossible to counter, but billy/ legion are played a lot so eh
---
Right !!
---
If you waste time on yourself it's also safer. You aren running around injured
---
True
---
Alright xD as u say, im really super salty
---
Tbh if the killer has 6 perk, I get why you dc
---
True true...
---
&gt;Unless there's altruistic players. Then they try their best to unhook said survivor. Which in turn causes more downs and points for the killer.
---
Why is that the killers fault though? 
---
Plus I've been accused of camping when I KNEW based on the gameplay leading up to the hook that the survivors would suicide rush the hook (flashlight spam while carrying, doing a gen right next to the hook,etc). Then I've been called a camper for not apparently walking away despite that survivors were obviously nearby and I spent a few seconds searching.
---
Was about to comment saying that this was stolen from CowsIAm until I saw your name. Lol
---
Then I stand corrected
---
You're both wrong : he's from Northern England.
---
I guess both of ye have to play your accounts to 1million BP...
---
Lol i dont even know where to start with this one guys.
---
If u woundlt care, i would ignore it...;)
---
Maybe but it happens to me all the time I’ll spring through it and not be able to throw it down ever
---
MoM is kinda 50/50, u need luck, with some killers is useless, with other killers is op
---
How do you do that tap to reveal text?
---
What changed??? Wiki isn’t showing differences
---
I understand that pallet vacuum was broken don’t get me wrong but I have gotten killed more times than not because I haven’t been able to throw a pallet down while sprinting
---
Michael should be higher
---
They're in testing phase right now so we might get it quicker than we expected
---
agreed. the lighting patch was a big nerf for survivors eg. claudette’s. the game looked way better back then. but due to balance it had to be done.
---
I did not think that would be real
---
Old jungle gyms :)  
---
This has been in for a while. A bug, I believe.  
---
Sucks when you get it as killer, though.
---
Correct me if the flare is wrong, I'm really new here
---
Yeah, I was getting flashbacks for a sec. 
---
Somehow they didn't manage to do anything with them, thank goodness for rank reset.
---
That would actually make more sense than wasting a perk slot for it.
---
It does, except arent most killer ultra rare add ons. (I would say survivor, but only 1/3 are any good now)
---
Yeah well I'm glad that there are what you consider "trash memes" on this subreddit because it would be pretty boring otherwise.
---
Solo survivor sucks, but one down DCs will always lead to the prevention of a pip, and a killer needs to try hard or farm if they want to actually pip and not safety or depip
---
haha ye, I always uploaded my shit to reddit before i got alot of subs  
---
But I'll continue uploading here for a while atleast :)
---
Valid point, however, it’s called not being lazy
---
I heavily admit I am a complete dumbass.
---
Thanks!
---
I apologize for my Canadian idiocy. 
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Incoming grammar nazi: it's would've.
---
We already have a tormenting killer
---
I play Jeff because I too am a sensitive, doughy lad with a beard.
---
Yea but if we all agree to farm that eliminates depipping for everyone
---
No it doesn't.
---
Don't worry about it  :)
---
Happy to help.
---
"Snap out of it"
---
It is the Entity's realm. I doubt there is anything that goes on which it does not know about. The hatches themselves seem to have been repurposed by the Fog and used by the Entity. Whatever the original hatch was or what it did is a mystery. But it is clear the hatches we use are a pale imitation of the original that was created.  
---
Just because the Entity didn't make it doesn't mean it isn't being utilized to the Entity's own ends.
---
Then, and hear me out here, move on from the post. Hell downvote it if you want. You making a comment whining about it brings just as much to the table as the post you’re complaining about.
---
thanks!!
---
ik that, but I hadn't gone against many doctors and I didn't know t3 prevented me from doing stuff
---
I prefer headphone audio over speakers plus I'm often playing late when my kid is asleep so need to keep it quieter than normal. I haven't had a speaker system on my pc in a few years honestly bc I never use them. It's not being cranky though, it's literally just using the game programming to nullify one single sound bite that plays sharper and louder than the others. It's obviously not just me, even streamers often mute focus when they're hooked as survivor.
---
No but I think that its a bug so maybe they will fix it later. We have a week before the next shrine so we'll see
---
You're overcomplicating the recipe for a camp. Just combine any four items /s
---
Yeah, blame your fellow survivors that refuse to play nice for me not wanting to farm with you
---
Leatherface is absolutely not the worst killer, not even anywhere close.
---
Doctor, Freddy, Trapper, arguably Wraith are all worse than him. 
---
Just because he is a worse Billy doesn’t change the fact he has a free instadown as his power.
---
Kind of a moot point since we're both stupid.
---
Since Scotland is at least attached to England I'll do 500K BP for him since I enjoy grinding!
---
Very true and sometimes feels like being on a assembly line but then the game ends and it says merciless victory.
---
Is this a spin off of hero clicks?
---
Sounds like mr.cranky needs a nap. No but you sound reasonably smart. I take your word for it.
---
Seems counterintuitive but a deals a deal.
---
Your free to do whatever. Kill the survivors or farm with them. But not all survivors DC and act like buttmonkeys. I see just as many killers act stupid as survivors.
---
As a killer if I get ass blasted, I put a gg then the ezs come in, and I leave. If I destroy people I put gg wp and they put “zzzzzz crutch perks” while running the most meta build, I don’t like to be toxic but I get in fights in end game chats sometimes when the survivors get angry.
---
Never have I seen a killer, as someone with 60% killer games and 40% survivor games, be toxic when they win. Sure it happens sometimes but usually they are toxic when the survivors are, and the few I have seen be toxic in end game are ones that are really bad and insecure
---
Solution: Hardcore mode, no perks no addons/items, leave boxes, max 2 man SWF? no one sees anyone pregame lobby.
---
Same problem I'm on PC
---
I don’t think anyone can get anything from shrine, I know myself and others can’t
---
I actually think the difficulty of focusing on the image makes it even creepier. I imagine myself in a dark room and as my eyes are just starting to adjust, the thought of what exactly is that figure I'm focusing on turns into the instant and terrifying realization that it's already too late. Really well done, OP.
---
It was an actual match, in the post chat he said "I was trying to figure out what you were doing" And I assume they were in chat, cause someone quoted him as saying "They're pulling some evil Knievel shit"
---
By the sounds of it, curiosity overruled his desire to escape. Which is fair, I was so amused with that experience I didn't go for kills.
---
Entity: you idiot, you’re no longer able to yank people out off hatch safety anymore (makes a 3 page report on the need to be able to yank people off hatches again)
---
Shoot, I thought it was only a ps4 issue
---
Lmaooo I remember that wasn’t that pre-vacuum pallet nerf?
---
Pass dat shit
---
Like it, but that doesn’t solve these issues, just makes it so people can avoid them.
---
Also “leave boxes”? 
---
And this “solution” doesn’t fix nurse
---
that's an old screenshot, holy crap
---
Cough ~ Survivors next? ~ cough
---
I feel like it is all about play time and learning a player. Playing nurse requires super focus not just for the blinks, that’s easy, but you need to identify and learn every player.
---
Examples:
---
Does this player have dead hard, do they double back,  do they break line of sight and go back (last 2 are most common), do they vault and Revault, can they read you?
---
All of that is important. In a chase blink short and never aim your blinks until you are ready to release onc you get the timer down, it throws a good survivor off. Also don’t be afraid to blink short, you have 2 for a reason
---

No one said it's okay. We're just obviously not as outraged as you about it.
---
Meg: “Every man for himself!”
---
[SNAP]
---
Meg: “Help me, Dwight!”
---
Idk why ur getting so defensive. I already addressed this in another comment. And I never once said it was the killers fault.
---
Grind is a terrible thing. Before M&amp;A came along we used to use Insidious to mind game at blind wall jungle gyms which you could do instead, if the entity gives you Insidious over M&amp;A on your web that is. Was also fun to sit on top of the Asylum and watch the survivor antics when they saw you drop down sprinting at them.
---
Following the Legion rework, the new description for the Deranged Pursuit trophy/achievement is as follows:
---
"In public matches, as the Legion, down 25 different Survivors that have Deep Wound applied."
---
What exactly does this mean? Do I have to down the survivor after losing them, so that the Deep Wound timer begins?
---
I wish I had money to give you gold but I dont so here's my fake gold! An upvote and this 🏅
---
How long on average does it take teachable perks to show up in other bloodwebs?

This is why we run No Mither +  Tenacity :)

True.

&gt;quacking around the shack
---
I'm fucking *dead* omg
---
^(lol shack-quacking)
---
Way to assume!! Stop defending camping as a strategy its literally SOME RANK 20 SHIT.
---
Wow. I have insidious but I'm thinking about getti g him to p1 just because. I'll get m&amp;a then. I need to do something my matches I either dominate or come super close to dominating they just play too many games to be quick enough.
---
Bruh!
---
Nah f selfcare.
---
One time I played my lvl 5 pig for a daily, got fucked, and BMed every stem of the way, saw the same SWF group almost a week later, and destroyed them with nurse. Got to gloat in the end game chat
---
“Remember me fuckers”
---
Fear the wrath of FREDDY'S FRAMEDROP BASEMENT.
---
After killers of course!
---
Yay! Ur style is averynice
---
what kind of final required you to make a DBD food truck?
---
I had the same thing happen but with a different window on Haddonfun. They seriously need to do something about balanced landing on maps like Haddonfield, Coal Tower, Grim Pantry, etc.
---
Best case scenario, I say GG with constructive comments or praise for a good job, however if the killer is a dick, I’ll either just leave it at GG, or just move onto another match and hope it isn’t against the same killer
---
i think the issue is right now is so many people crash or get DC'd from games and it's completely out of their control. once they fix that it'll be much easier to punish DCing.
---
Wake Up.
---
Interesting with the endgame.
---
Is there a Zappy Boi yet??
---
No, tunnelling isn't chasing.
---
Tunnelling is when you go after one guy, and only one guy
---
Yes indeed I posted 6 killers previously :)
---
If it's a Myers take the deal, an offer of mercy is rare from Daddy Myers

I even put the /s just to make the sarcasm more obvious and you still didn't get it. Unreal....

Imagine thinking online interaction and irl one are the same.
---
I never take self care off.
---
Ohh he's great lol
---
Could I ask why? I thought bond might be better just cause it’s permanent and aftercare isn’t. Is it better?
---
Yesterday I watched a Meg block her window she was looping someone on pretty much instantly in spectate. But for some reason she could STILL vault it even after it was blocked.
---
Normally it's the devs who break the game
---
I appreciate your perspective, thanks again.
---
I’m gonna be honest, farming is boring
---
Lazy man just cleanse the dull totem
---
It usually happens when you unready right when you join a match as survivor.
---
If we are going to count the clows stomping Mori I count legions, when you could spam it it was just you dragging a survivor and looked really rapey
---
Claudette
---
What I tend to do is let the saw go before I actually come around the corner and use the oversteer to come around it and aim at the survivor. Saving that second before you come around can mean the difference in them making the next corner/vault and you shutting the loop down before it starts.
---
Like using freddy without his power?
---
I agree, and this meme doesn't quite represent what I believe-- I will power through gens if a killer wants to farm. I try to give them as few points as possible.
---
Do some research before suggesting this
---
Devs allready condirmed it wont happen since pennywise is his own entity
---
Literally went to haddonfield against the same SWF team twice in a row all with balanced landing and it was straight terrible lol
---
There's always the possibility of them being kicked
---
Yes it is impossible to win during end game
---
Camping is technically a strategy. It’s a annoying but it gives the survivors the upper hand if they take it. We don’t even know if he was toxic or not.
---
Can’t find good posters like this anywhere
---
Spencer’s
---
*go kys*
---
Claudette is probably the easier, most basic survivor there is, as for the hardest one, I’d say that goes to David.

They click and drag (whilst holding M1), so that when the item is unlocked they can just click on the next item under their cursor. Rinse &amp; repeat.

Might be PS4 or console shrine, earlier when I was on and tried to get something it wouldn’t let me
---
How are you a killer main??
---
Camping is just dumb game play
---
great tip, thanks.
---
I only do that when people tbag, funny as fuck lmao
---
Exactly.
---
What’s wrong with dead hard? That’s probably one of the most balanced perks a survivor has.
---
Blood warden should go off a second time for 25% of the time, change my mind
---
Lmao
---
That's an oddly specific genre of gay porn to be into so very very odd
---
Add me;) friday i can show u how im a killer main
---
I don't jump on a killer to be toxic to other players when I'm frustrated at a killer. What kind of monster pays negativity forward like that?
---
Loved the art being posted on here by u/LucaBicono, and the Spirit was my favorite!
---
Yea he’s a pretty chill dude. I don’t particularly care for him as a streamer but he seems like a genuinely nice guy dedicated to providing a positive experience. I try to go easy on them. They aren’t the best, but damn are they nice. You have to have respect for that.
---
I used to be the meg.
---
FYI, customer service did respond to me and said we aren't the only ones with the issue, and to try making our purchases another time. Mine still isn't fixed yet, but hopefully soon.
---
What is this trying to say? You want changes?
---
Okay so like i only play killer and always see survirors being toxic. People that main both, are they equally toxic? Because when someone flames me i just tell them that winning was my goal and i did.
---
I like the idea of being able to banish a survivor into another dimension. I just don't know why you'd want to do it besides maybe wasting time and 1 survivor not able to do hook saves or repairs. 
---
Would Pinhead be able to enter the maze realm and chase the survivor there?
---
It’s their friend’s tattoo, not OP’s
---
Luckily I play pig, and can geriatric tbag right back.
---
That’s true
---
Saw a guy D/C when the killer brought him to hatch today.
---
*Bloodwarden activates*
---
"Misery, misery, misery; that's what you've chosen!"
---
Uh, cool?
---
Pretty sure it's a bug, although i thought they fixed it
---
Doc, wraith and trapper are all better than leatherboi.
---
Laurie is for experts only. 
---
Claudette is ez pz
---
You’ve got my vote
---
isn't Nea DLC?
---
Played a game as wraith. 4k. No gens completed. Won every chase. But this is what I get...
---
I have a picture of the game if people dont believe me, just need to figure out how to add it to comments using mobile
---
Is she? If she is i completely forgot that she was!
---
After he first swing on the hay bales stand still or get far enough to hug the wall and not fall off, and then quickly swing forward
---
I got this once as well. It happened to me when trying to join SWF and it just freaked out on me. I was stuck like this while on one of my friend's screen I was in the lobby and not the other friends but she could no longer send another invite.
---
Did you have to close your game to get rid of it? Mine just went back to normal after trying to start my own lobby which kicked me from the stuck lobby.
---
What takes priority, borrowed time or MoM?
---
Much accurate
---
I agree that he's balanced. My caveat is that his instasaw setup has no drawback whatsoever. Compare that to a killer like Spirit where her best add-on (in my opinion), Mother Daughter Ring, removes the ability to see scratch marks when phasing. I think his add ons could be tweaked, but he's fine. You could argue between him and Spirit on the tier list. I don't think there's a clear answer. They're good at different things and it's really situational.
---
Well technically since survivors are just Reskins any of them. If you mean by their "unique" perks I'd say Meg with sprintburst and/or adrenaline or Claudette with... well any of her perks really are best. Laurie becoming the obsession or David with his no mither are the hardest in my opinion. Hardest adept achievements at least.
---
It’s nearly impossible to cleanse all 5 totems solo. I’m not gonna go across the whole map just to see if some totems haven’t been cleansed
---
honestly this problem is worse on consoles
---
🗿!
---
Funny but shitpost not suggestion...
---
I only use ash becuase why not
---
I miss when there were fewer killer and survivors in a way. It made your choices feel more reflective of your playstyle. Now theres so many survivors playing one doesnt say anything.
---
Well except maybe shirtless david.
---
Fuckin love Feng x Doctor, got it mainly from the fanfiction Dark Sense.
---
The fact it's fuckin stupid
---
I've always said a blanket item which you can use to lay prone on the ground under the blanket would be nice for stealth. Add-ons could change color, charges, texture, etc.
---
If you're not coming from killer with a stupid amount of BP saved its David for WGLF...
---
Yes
---
It's a joke
---
Joke
---
Tis a joke
---
Its a joke
---
What's a good combination of non counter perks? Asking just incase I have a bad day and really need the kill  :(
---
It would basically be a pocket dimension yeah, slow the game down, there would be some balancing issues but I feel like this would be the most interesting take on Pinhead.
---
Spine chill is pretty great even without the speed buff. If i hear a heartbeat while i do a gen but spine chill isnt activated then I know its most likely the killer is chasing someone. And with the range being farther than some killers' heartbeat, i can hide myself sooner.
---
Remember jungle gyms and having only basement hooks to use
---
Or the devs will do whatever they want as long as they can reach an agreement with the owners of the trademarks and make money

Its called latency.

Took you a fraction of second to see the *flick* animation performed by huntress.
---
Sometimes I'm really... like insanely stoned, and I mess up.
---
That's a reason why.
---
You'd be surprised, people nowadays dc the second they see a strong add on. Iridescent head huntress? DC. Prayer beads spirit? Goodbye team, old Frank's mixtape? I'm outta here. Not throwing shade at them for doing it but people get reallllllyyyyyyy upset about strong add ons
---
Sorry, didn't think of that.  How do I edit the title, I cant find it.
---
&gt;Why is there no way to bring yourself back up? If the killer is just leaving you on the ground on purpose for a long time, I feel like the player should have a way to pick themselves up, even if it takes a really long time.
---
There is, its called Unbreakable and No Mither.
---
I would assume that it means that you just have to down them after hitting them while they have deep wounds active.  I can try to find out and let you know through testing it!
---
Me, with david tbh. He’s such a hunk
---
Before you couldn't close it the entire reason it was closed cause of a thing called stand offs where the killer and suvicior both stand therw forever waiting. It was bad.
---
The one or two kills thing is stupid his goal is to kill everyone.
---
As for leaving someone on the ground it's called slugging and it's used to not open the hatch for instance.
---
If he closed the hatch and stood there you use the gates.
---
there is no suidce for the fact it would ruin game balance
---
What if they're running Monstrous Shrine *and* Insidious? They'd be completely uncounterable.
---
Does Play with your food stack on legions ability? Like when your chasing someone with frenzy do you go faster when you have tokens or does it only apply without frenzy???
---
Just crouch walking is enough to not alert crows. Calm Spirit lets you stand/run too. Also no screams from madness or clown gas.
---
You didn't answer on why
---
I think that the red rank survivor meta for Plague was to not use the fountains to limit her ability to down you from range.
---
Oh thank you god. With BHVR you really can’t tell
---
Thank you!
---
She’s free and came with the Last Breath chapter like Nurse.
---
I'm actually a survivor 2/3rds of the time.
---
the spaghetti code
---
&gt;TL;DR : The emblem system is bad, making getting killer adepts way to difficult than normal, not to mention how there are bugs with the emblem system involving generators for survivors.
---
The generator bug is just for bloodpoints, not emblems.
---
I think that if they incentivized diversity of perks through rewards (maybe BP for easier ones and cosmetics for harder ones), then there would be a wider range of perk, survivor, and killer usage by the player base.  I think that behavior was kind of thinking that with their season pass idea, but that's terrible for a game that people already theoretically already paid $20 for.
---
Its sounda like you need to play more killer and survivor to understand OP. Youre making some pretty basic mistakes.
---
I doubt the Entity is primarily focused on humans.  
---
Also, it's interesting you would post this since a lot of people made similar posts about Scream and there you go.
---
"Let me explain about that stuff earlier"
---
Whow whow whow that's advaced technique don't overwhelm the new players.
---
I kinda know that predator ain't coming because of his new DBD like horror game similar to F13. Alien might be his chances a wee bit low. Pennywise probably will come because of his new movie and the fact the killer after ghostface comes in september which is the month his new movie comes out, etc etc.
---
Just remove it already i agree
---
It was so painful chasing a Claudette in that outfit. She went over at least 6 of my traps and I wanted to die.
---
Thank you!  I had no idea how any of that works.
---
I can see how the standoff thing would be bad, but why not make it so the player can't just jump in instantly or something. Or do the same for closing the hatch. Surely there's a better way to handle this. I get that he was doing it to prevent the hatch from opening (didn't know it was called slugging), what I'm saying is that I didn't really have a counterplay there. Like I said, he was probably just cycling the gens and as the last person alive I wasn't really able to do anything about it. Even when I \*did\* go to heal the other guy in the vain hope that he'd help, my last ditch effort, I ended up in worse position because he led the killer right to the hatch, which ties into my first point.
---
I don't think the one or two kills thing is stupid at all? Obviously your preferred way to end the game is the most optimal one, where everyone either lives or dies depending on who you're playing, but I highly doubt the game is balanced so that the killer is only satisfied by a complete sweep. In both balance and theme, it makes sense for the last person to have the leg up in escaping (IE, a lot of horror movies end with everyone but the last person dying.)
---
How would suicide ruin the game balance? All it does is prevent slugging and trolling. And even if slugging were absolutely, 100% necessary to the game's core, there's no reason why the \*last\* survivor shouldn't be allowed to suicide is there?
---
I had a game today where when one person found out it was ruin they dced. Then another dced when they got downed and the thirs person dced randomly. They the hatch got closed and i died. 10/10 would play again.
---
MoM is definitely supposed to only function if the survivor is injured.
---
Ussylis on a video said that spine chill gives u 15% vault speed...
---
Every... single... time...
---
*I'm James A Janisse, this has been the kill count* 
---
Don't forget the dip in tone of voice and head bob after saying his name.
---
Ooo would it look like a swarm of beetles with a humanoid shape? I dig that idea
---
Goddamn it I just can't help adoring him. He's so wholesome even with videos about horror movies. He's truly a peach to the horror community
---
DUNDUN *SVU theme plays*
---
Technically survivors are skins, but claudette and meg are the two you want to level up first.
---
There isn't a better way trust me they tried to fix it. Just go after the gates they are revealed.
---
The killers goal is to kill everyone that's the entire point. The killer did there job well suviviors shotlsbt have it free.
---
Because people would sucide way to to much. Slugging is a game mechaic on purpose.
---
BBQ and ruin never change
---
 P L A G
---
It was sarcasm I edited my original comment lol. Sorry peoples.
---
It's not 4 minutes.
---
Almost every game since rank reset has been like this for me. It makes for some pretty boring games.
---
It's always accurate for the killer. It's bugged for survivors.
---
You should do ghostface
---
Yikes dude I guess my phone autocorrected to that good shit 👀
---
But male survivors have the A E S T H E T I C.
---
Yeah its super wierd. I don't even know what would cause that.
---
Pennywise IS The Entity.
---
Decisive pencil
---
Spies, Surveillance, Discordance, Brutal Strength, Corrupt Intervention, and Save the best for the last have counterplay.  
---
Use Calm Spirit/Don't sprint, Wait a bit before working on a gen again, Don't work on gens together, wait to throwdown pallets, camp the corrupted gen out of sight, and block for a non-obsession as the obsession respectively.  
---
I also don't get how Knock out has counterplay unless you're in comms. Otherwise great list.
---
The Entity feeds off hope. Pennywise feeds off fear. Possibly they're the same species but Pennywise isn't the entity
---
Hey, uh...About that.
---
Or even easier: Killer closes hatch = Last survivor becomes obsession. That way the last survivor isn't even affected by the perks gate speed de-buff.
---
As i the first occasion this rule don't worn
---
It does affect his frenzy speed however it really isn't worth it
---
I've already made her actually, see a previous post I did in this sub :)
---
Hey! This is my friend! Mori me Doctor is my friend irl and we always play DBD together. You'll find us usually together, my username is Mori me Michael :) she doesn't use reddit but I showed her this post and she's happy
---
To be fair I truncated a lot of what actually happened in the game for the sake of not making the post even longer, so this isn't a completely and totally accurate summation of events as far as what I was actually doing goes. But for the sake of argument, what would you say my mistakes here were?
---
If you watched the movies you'd know Pinhead and the rest of the Cenobites were originally human, so it would technically work in lore.
---
EGC is 2 minutes when a survivor is downed or hooked the timer moves at 50% speed meaning 2 minutes can technically turn to 4 minutes
---
Because you fell with a ton of survivors LOL
---
Okay, i wasnt paying attention to the thread and should shead some light. I got downed and crawled to the corner. A shirtless david and a nea came over to revive me. David blocked us both in the corner when reviving me. When i went back up both nea and I were stuck in eachother. We couldnt get out. I got the short stick and myers didnt care i couldnt move due to a glitch and hooked me. Revieeing it now looks like nea was blocking and i should have been more clear.
---
Hello Malygosa, 
---
You seem to be quite popular. Do you mind explaining to me why so I could also be in the loop?
---
Doc? Haha no
---
Trapper? Ehhhh, Trapper struggles hard
---
Wraith? I can see an argument for this
---
Heh Jeff main, and can confirm i can sometimes be the hardest to find
---
the adept awards as killers are solely based as to whether anyone escaped, if you obtained a 4K, you should have received the award.
---
Imagine doing a generator, only to turn around and see T-Pose Myers peeking at you from around a corner.
---
Yeah and I asked “can you imagine”... I know it is.

This is one of those spots I just let the Survivor play themselves. You'd be surprised how often they'll vault in and out of that spot then get themselves locked out and stranded on the hay bale for a free hit.   
---
Unless they have Balanced but even then sometimes they tend to think they'll somehow win the mind game.
---
No thats the biggest thing just bring unbreakable or no mither so he cant slug you. If they added a way to get up without those perks people would rage. You need to run unbreakable and adrenaline so if he slugs you, you can get up. I swear man you new guys are always the problem.
---
Yeah sorry I was on a roll answering the same thing to people saying things like "bhvr is insane1!1!!1!1!" My bad
---
This displeases the Freddy mains
---
In Michael’s lore it’s pretty much said that the Entity didn’t even have to manipulate him—he’s “happy” senselessly killing survivors and doesn’t really need any manipulation. But I do agree, the Entity pretty much only takes humans so far, it’d be kinda weird for that to change.
---
You forget Bubba comes default with one of the best tracking perks in the game.
---
In fact, a tracking power is redundant since many, many perks are dedicated to tracking. 
---
Surveillance, Discordance, Spies from the Shadows, Whispers, Bloodhound, Sloppy Butcher, Nurses Calling, and of course BBQ and Chili. Many more as well, but I digress.
---
He didn’t leave your teammate on the ground on purpose... he wanted a 4k and he knew if he hooked him you would’ve escaped. 
---
You can get yourself up with no mither and unreadable.
---
Survivors have been keeping the game hostage for years and when they did it lasted for sometimes 5-10 minutes so don’t complain about waiting 3 minutes.
---
And why would there be a suicide option? So you want people to DC without getting the punishment of not getting bloodpoints? And how will they commit suicide? Shoot themself with a gun in their pocket?
---
Redbubble ._.
---
dbd and rodriguez together? upvote
---
7 perks on a survivor hmmm sounds good
---
Yeah that would be best for the game probably.
---
Mmmmmm Jane’s ripe bum
---
Have should be in A. Her potential to snowball is just too good to ignore.
---
Nerf it, run from it, Amanda arrives all the same
---
Honestly yeah. It sucks because they’ll carry you near the hatch, close it, and just stare at you for LITERAL MINUTES until you die
---
And you can’t DC because you lose your XP/Bloodpoints, so it sucks.
---
Just make the timer 4x faster if there is only one survivor. You’re basically dead anyway if the killer closes the hatch and isn’t a complete moron with the exit gates.
---
Do you have enough shards?
---
honestly, I wish they would try to make the lighting different from survivors vs killers (obvi darker for survivors, brighter for killers). 
---
Lightborn and Shadowborn used to do that anyways (moonlight offerings too, but those were global whereas those perks made it JUST brigher/darker for the killer only) but I suppose its a lot of work to make sure the maps look good with two types of lighting.
---
Self care. Gotta be healed up to save a hook camped survivor for bt...scope it out, go in, take a hit (cause you don't want to get grabbed during a save) and (depending on where the killer is positioned) if they are gonna hit you again, hit dh as soon as the unhook animation is done. I have almost 3k hours and helped tons of people escape by doing this.
---
yeah, that's what I want. I just P3'd my Feng tonight, and I wanted to use that 250k to boost her up a bit.
---
But if you play freddy like a chase killer you're doing it wrong **reeeeeee**
---
why are you angry over self care?
---
I feel like people who do get upset should play survivor without rare perks.
---
And to really get them thinking, they should play traditionally weak killers without addons.
---
It's be an interesting experiment, they'd either wise up or quit. :P
---
lol I really don't want to explain for a 4th time why I don't think "just bring these specific perks" is a good counter argument, but suffice to say, its luck. In this case, I wasn't even the one who needed no mither or unbreakable, that was my teammate. Also, I'm not necessarily saying survivors \*need\* a way to get up, just that I imagine it was incredibly unfun for the person being slugged and definitely unfun for me, waiting for the killer to give up and hook them while holding all the gens hostage. Maybe its a way to get up that takes a really long time, maybe its a suicide option that takes a really long time, whatever. All I'm saying is that the lack of counterbalances allowed the killer to stall the game out to a ridiculous length and was incredibly frustrating. Especially since even when I tried to end it early by giving the killer a free sweep, he was able to stall me out for no reason other than to be a dick.
---
Well it has happened to me like 4 times this week.
---
I play killer, bring bps and 2 or 3 people insta dc as soon as the game starts. Its pretty annoying, and I hope for a dc penalty too.
---
This is a requirement in all evolving games with a ranking system. This is there to make sure everyone *earns* their rank on the *current* version of the game. The game is ever changing, and being good on a previous version does not always mean you will be good on the current version (ex. a crutch perk was removed/reworked, a killer's power was changed, an exploit fixed etc..). It could be adjusted, perhaps, but it can not be removed.
---
I love the idea of the player not being able to hook the survivors, and the second AI killer has to most of the heavy lifting.
---
bhvr
---
I've only ever seen this once, but IIRC MoM popped first, because otherwise you could BT&gt;MoM and still go down from bleedout.
---
I *sort of* get toxic survs trying to "stick it" to the killer by doing that, but I'm not the one that brought the BPS, it was their teammate. That's what really surprised me.
---
Get monitor and abuse and get the 2 stage as fast as possible then 99 tier 2 so you can quick down a survivor. Or just stay in tier 2 and pratice doing good in that mode. That’s what I did when I first started
---
oof
---
Does this include face camping?
---
Part of it is because there is very few things that are truly OP. 3-4 person MoM and Nurse with good addons are the few things that come to mind.
---
When you think about it, spitting is just long distance kissing.
---
You can’t use perks when discussing a killers powers. If you truly wish to do that doctor has the best 3 gen strat in the game to the point it’s almost impossible to counter on certain maps.
---
If you want to have 15% quick vault speed you need to use Spine Chill with Resilience.
---
MVPs right here. I'd I'm doing a daily on a killer I suck with and get looped into oblivion, I always appreciate the survivors who leave right away so I can cry in peace
---
&gt;Billy, and yes that is why I am so fucking confused on how I got one shoted. I look thou the perks his items,nothing gave people exposed or anything he just, one shot me out of thin air.
---
However his response when I ask him how was "You fucking dead loser" so,yeah..
---
Don't forget to Like, Comment, and Subscribe.
---
I forgot what map, but it has loop where it's two buses together and in the middle you can vault between them. But if you vault one way (or both) it will play the animation but keep you on the same side. Shit got me downed by a Bubba last night.
---
Yep. You can gen jockey it while also denying her biggest weapon. If you can get your whole team to do it works pretty well; if not you’re probably going to get boinked and spend a lot of time hiding.
---
I agree with adjusting it, I went from rank 8 to rank 13 as survivor, literally skipping me bad ALL the green ranks, and I don't have much time to play, and with this new ranking system, it's impossible to rank, all my games are full of potatos, I end up running the killer around for five minutes and no gens get done, then they lose me, I get on a gen, and then get caught again, with all the luck-based ranking, and my shitty luck (especially with hitboxes) I can't rank up past 8, and I want rank 1 because I'm an achievement hunter.
---
A voodoo related item that makes it so whenever a killer would see your aura, it consumes some charge and blocks it. higher tiers can show you the killer aura as well when it triggers, or even show a decoy aura elsewhere on the map.
---
Q U I C C
---
Yeah, survivor pips **definitely** could use a re-work.
---
I like to rehook the first person immediately - on an open map you won't lose the unhooker, and you REALLY need that momentum; the game becomes so much easier with one person dead.
---
It's nothing specifically personal towards the poor soul.
---
Also if the second person is genuinely farming they will loop back around to try and get the first person again, and that's when I go mercy mode (I will chase that second person and do everything in my power to get them, I don't turn around and tunnel the first person for the death hook).
---
Of course sometimes I just stumble across the same person three times in a row without even trying, and while that really sucks too (had it happen to me, particularly with potato teams that blow generators I'm working on and hook farm me) I still need someone dead to reduce generator momentum.
---
...I'm not a perfect person, like sometimes I do get tilted and incredibly salty, but when it comes down to rehooking someone it's usually just bad luck that the mechanical situation means I need an early kill to snowball.
---
Plus if I pretend I'm tunneling I'll have other survivors run up to distract me - I love that too; I want each of my BBQ stacks, I will chase that person down who took a 'protective' hit and everyone wins (they get a WLGF stack, I get a new injured target).
---
That's how you get my attention as a killer, if they're injured and you're healthy, you have to let me hit you if I'm going to commit to chasing you instead.
---
I agree, I main both, but in chases, I'm a way better survivor, so, as previously stated, the killer is usually on my ass most if the trial. It's pretty uncommon for me to end a trial with max boldness, but I can't rank uo because those killers tunnel or camp me.
---
I'm a survivor main and i know that. I play enough killer to know when its 2 gens left, i know they're hidinf in a locker waiting for the hook. I told him to bring perks to help. Bit he's like perks dont matter. Im like perks are what save  new people like you.
---
Longer then a gen? Wow... I wonder if this'll be meta?
---
Distressing, SB, Thanatophobia and Coulrophobia on like Doc or another character with a large Terror Radius
---
When someone is sabotaging hooks you can try
---
Depends entirely on playstyle and build you are going for.
---
These days Freddy players are becoming more vocal.  Hello.
---
Yes the auto aim thing sucks.  Don't swing when an awake survivor is so close to you.
---
Freddy has the best tracker and staller in the game.  I can comfortably play him without Hex: Ruin or similar because his power naturally slows the game down to a snails pace.
---
Yes. Hurr durr 7 seconds.  Except at the start of those 7 seconds you could be literally breathing down their neck.  Also if you learn the timing for his flickering, you can mindgame the shit out if it.  Once those 7 seconds elapse, free hit.
---
Also, how many killers can comfortably get a hit in in under 7 seconds? Not that many.
---
Wallhacks.  He has goddam wallhacks.  Freddy is the epitome of "you can run but you can't hide".  If you are able to sleep multiple survivors, you can drop chase with one to ambush another.  Don't play Freddy like a traditional chase killer.  Don't commit to bad loops unless you can afford it.
---
Oh he's also stupidly good at slugging.  If there are two survivors left and both are asleep, and you manage to slug one before the other wakes up, you win.  For example.
---
By extension; Knockout is far and away Freddy's strongest perk.
---
Honestly all I can say is give him an honest go.  Play him in a style that's more like Scratch Mirror Myers.  Don't blindly chase and instead concentrate on keeping as many survivors asleep (and maybe injured) as you can.
---
If all four are asleep and injured, you have such an absurdly strong advantage the 4k is basically inevitable.
---
Huntress does need a speed boost alone, plus her hatchets are easily dodged.
---

HE'S REPTILIAN
---
&gt;I know hitboxes in general are completely fucked than they’ve ever been in the game but that’s literally the only counter to nurse sometimes or used to be.
---
Except for Billy's Chainsaw, they aren't... No matter how many people go around saying this purely because they don't understand how ping / latency work.
---
That's a nice buff for Rancor.
---
Spoiler:he did not disconnect.
---
I'm just happy to see the community starting to come around on Freddy's capabilities.  Fedora Man is so much better than people say he is
---
How dare you put Freddy above F tier /s
---
Someone knows Spirit's movement speed in phase walking when she use Mother Daughter Ring ? She seems really fast with that add-on, but I can't find a exact number for it, even Wiki don't say how fast she is with that add-on.
---
I would sacrifice myself for him if he did that to me
---
There was a similar art a few days ago, this one is really good too
---
i understand ping and latency. even with good ping it’s still a problem. bad ping is a field day for survivors going up against a nurse.
---
I really hate that map too :/
---
Same here...it's a really serious issue that I think a lot of people are upset about. When I was rank 8 I still saw these issues happening but not like I am after rank reset. I don't care if I survive or not. I'm playing the game to have fun and dealing with killers and survivors who play like this is both boring and frustrating.
---
I feel like it should be 3 or 4 times just to avoid being confused with 'heal requests' if you're injured.
---
Or perhaps if you're downed in the exit gates it should be blocked from you (if you were injured, meaning NOED wouldn't do it) for 30 seconds.
---
Personally I'd prefer Hex: Hook. "If you teabag in the exit gate, you get hooked in the basement automatically and become broken".
---
Shouldn't we just be asking for the visuals to be fixed instead of demanding it be removed?
---
Only time I’m able to wiggle free or help my teammates wiggle free is because of sabotaging
---
Once I read sister I thought we had a James Charles killer
---
I legit had a game earlier where I juked a nurse and she swung, but her back was to me and it still connected?
---
no thanks. i would instantly uninstall. 
---
the games become bland in terms of depth at this point. we don’t need any more.
---
Oof
---
As I said like, 6 times now? The killer stalled out the endgame timer to be a dick when I was the last player alive and he had already taken me down. I thought I'd made it abundantly clear already that this is the only issue I see as being pretty inarguable, as it just wastes my time so he can have a laugh. 
---
And I've also explained (granted in other comments) that suicide doesn't have to be instant or always allowed as soon as you get downed. It can be something that's only allowed when you're deadhook, or when you've been downed without being hooked for a long time, or it can just be an option that takes an incredibly long time to take effect. 
---
My killer's perspective might be lacking, but "ruining" a 4k sounds incredibly petty. You killed 3/4 of the players. That sounds like a perfectly good game to me. "Some assholw can hide in a locker and find the hatch" is also ridiculous considering I could just as easily have called the killer an asshole for slugging. I didn't because I'm fully aware that thats just how the game is, and its seen as a legitimate strat, I just don't think its very fun for the survivors involved. Especially the one being slugged.
---
Yeah that's a most Bill thing ever, at least in character. Which is why I love him.
---
It’s a masterpiece
---
It would be nice if they added at least one perk that increased your struggle meter rate since killer’s get iron grasp which reduces it to the point where they can almost always stick you in the basement.
---
Actually I would run Left Behind perk so it took some skill to avoid the killer,  stealthing away while invariably trying to complete 1-2 gens for hatch to spawn. It was far from welfare. Now a skilled survivor has no end game options other than praying for exit gates to be spawned far enough a part to hit the gate immediately after a killer checks it.
---
GO PLAAYYY
---
Well if they arent gonna change the map visually next best thing is to remove it entirely so we dont get eye cancer straining our eyes trying to see.
---
That's a good point, actually. The only thing I can think of is someone that doesn't play bragging about being rank 1, but that's not really something the community or devs would care about. Anyone else have any reason why the devs do rank reset? I feel like there is one, but idk what it is for sure.
---
not having to verse the same try hard red rank players over and over again
---
Thanks for the advice! I'll give all that a try, wish I hadn't of waited so late on this game to start playing cause it's all pretty overwhelming just jumping in now
---
it is bland now. i’m saying it would even make it worse. i’m not fussed with what people run, it makes it entertaining
---
These perks have been around for quite a while, and apart from Sloppy Butcher, are not meta by any stretch. I would go as far as saying Thanatophobia and Coulrophobia are non-perks, to a real extent, unfortunately.
---
Thanatophobia's numbers are awfully negligible - it only adds a handful of seconds to interactions, and that's if every single survivor is injured. Coulrophobia just means survivors will not heal in your terror radius, and if you are not on The Game as Doctor with stacked Calm add-ons and Distressing, there will always be an opportunity for survivors to leave your terror radius. Which, sure, that takes some time as well, but not only can survivors also opt to simply not heal, but if you as the killer are not downing people, all you are doing is delaying your inevitable defeat, since you are not progressing your objectives, whereas the survivors - at whatever pace - are.
---
Sloppy Butcher is also not good strictly as a means of stalling, since it doesn't actually prolong roundtime by that much either (8 seconds per self-heal or altruistic heal), but it's good because it increases the pressure on survivors and can improve a killer's snowball potential (needing that little bit longer to heal up a slugged or unhooked survivor, to heal before being able to go for save plays or pressure objectives, etc., enabling the killer to capitalize off of these situations more easily).
---
Poor Dwight. Please tell me you released him safely back into the wild.
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
Yeah no. I'd rather it be fixed. You are being a hair rash.
---
Feedback would be appreciated. Is it my commentary or just because the survivor got downed I'm getting downvoted? haha
---
Ok sure, the killer was 100% certain in his mind that I was waiting at the hatch because I didn't bother trying for the gens to give him the free sweep. Granting that, is the core of the argument affected? It just means the killer has even more reason to slug.
---
I know this is just a repost, but that is top art. Pls forward to artist if you know them.
---
This has pretty much always been a problem for me.
---
Hmm...
---
Struggler's Envy: You never were one to lie still and die. The time required to struggle out of the killer's grasp is reduced by 5/10/15%. The time you can stay in the Struggle phase of the hook is increased by 10/20/30%. The time you can stay in the first phase of the hook is reduced by 40/30/20%
---
They have a perk for that. It only works if you were slugged first. So it's useless 9/10 times.
---
(Hides bloody hook) oh yes, I released him at the farm
---
I totally understand. I've only been playing consistently for about 7 months and I still have some teachable perks left. Make sure to check the shrine if you have enough iridescent shards. Oh! I would also recommend Bamboozle too. In EW 3 you vault faster and with Bam. you vault up to 15% faster on top of that and it can close loops. So if you find yourself getting looped a lot definitely try to get that.
---
They are cheating, somehow.
---
Thankfully the Xbox has a much better reporting system so you can report his account for cheating and flaming
---
The あえぎ next to the Nurse is Japanese for the gasping noise women make during sex.. ha
---
...................what?  
---
Dude, just stop.   
---
Everyone wants the graphics updated because both survivors and killers aura aura abilities that are useless on that map. Which means, we will get it.
---
I’m fine with the first part, because it effects only when you’re being carried. Hook stuff should be separate. 
---
But you probably won’t get more than 4/8/12 to appropriately counteract Iron Grasp numbers. 
---
Goodness though. If we did add a hook part to the perk, I’d just want the ability to hold a button down and let it count as my struggle rather than tapping away at my keyboard.
---
Nah, criticising seeing the same posts every month makes me a bad person!
---
Reminds me of maplestory the proportions
---
If you understood you wouldnt want to have people just suicide on the ground or pick themselves up. Ita not perception its experience we all have had that happen to us. Where we were confused that the killer downed a guy and then immediate knew where we were. Its called stealth if you cant hide from a killer then yoh should stop playing. If he went down again near a hook then he killed him why wouldnt you juat wait by a door or do a gen. He also stalled for 3 mins thats not that long. The reason why you really dont get it is that its so common that you shouldnt complain. Killers slug and survivors have perks not matter how much you say "I may not use them!" It doesnt matter i bring adrenalone every game. If it never gets to end game i wasted a perk slot but if it does i greatful, as killer i bring bloodwarden 90% of my matches, do i use it rarely but wheb i get the chance im happy. You need to figure out what buolds work for you and help you survive. Please juat play longer you probably have 80 hrs in game.
---
It worked out for me once. It really worked well. Flip flop actually got me a escape.
---
It would be except...
---
**Rancor:**
---
You become ***obsessed*** with one Survivor.
---
Each time a [Generator](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generator) 📷 is completed, the [Obsession](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Obsession) 📷 sees your [Aura](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Aura) 📷 for **5**/**4**/**3** seconds.
---
Each time a Generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for **3 seconds**.
---
**&gt;&gt;Once all Generators are completed**, the **Obsession** has the [***Exposed***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Exposed) ***📷*** **Status Effect** and the Killer can **kill** the ***Obsession***.&lt;&lt;
---
*The Killer can only be* ***obsessed*** *with one Survivor at a time.*
---
So unfortunately that means you won't get the benefit from it unless all the generators were completed before you closed the hatch.
---
I still dislike camping (but do tunnel sometimes) and you are pretty much right the "counterplay" to MoM involves hard-tunneling or camping. You could bring a Mori every time you see an Ash and save it just for him after tunneling off the hook.
---
No drinking/making tea while playing this
---
Cheers for feedback :P help yourself to some steamed ham

Are hatch standoffs toxic? I'm a killer main, and I was being berated, for doing a hatch standoff after the second to last survivor used a key, leaving one man on top of the hatch with 3 gens to go. Was it toxic for me to stand there, like the survivors said?
---
You still get a token for body blocking but now the unhooks have to be safe unhooks to get a token. It makes it so you can just farm people and get stacks.
---
Well if you don't struggle the killer could bring you from one end of the map to another end just to throw you in a basement and camp you, but if you go down next to a basement, then tough luck.
---
Ah, alright. Forgot that some perks require all generators to be repaired in order to work, not just triggering the EGC.
---
This last update seem to make them crazy long tho. Like I’m getting 20-25 minute ques sometimes
---
Myeah, and?
---
That seems like I want to see the quote's origin
---
You waste the killers time by wiggling. And he can't carry you to the basment everytime.
---
Not really a harmful buff, basically.
---
It seems like a very sloppy way to do it though, just casually deranking everyone.
---
I understand that there are specific perks and items I can use to counter some of what the killer does. 
---
Items run out. You are not guaranteed to have tons of everything you need. Not to mention that you lose them if you die.
---
Explained down below my issue with perks. Not everyone has access to the same ones, though the way you explained how the killer can specifically build around slugging does make me rethink my position on it. Don't think this killer was building for it, but I hadn't heard of or seen any slug-based perks before now, honestly. 
---
As for pip, I had a misunderstanding as to how the pip system works for killers so sure, whatever arguments I made about the killer not needing the 4 kills can be considered null.
---
Oh yes unnerving presence and dying light. Hype
---
I prefer Kate.
---
Not an oversized ass, has a nice rack, and a pretty face.
---
10/10.
---
Plus, I THINK her blue jeans has a hole in them so you can see her panties
---
Defiantly low hanging fruit with a hit instead of hang version "at 3 stacks after every hit you get a 20% cooldown on hit delay, 6 stacks reduced terror radius to 0, at 10 stacks mori". It would kind of suck on 1 hit killers, but every perk doesn't have to fit every killer.
---
You’ve Ironed your last Will.
---
Bruh I’m not trynna inspect these player models under a microscope, Jane is the only thicc player model so that’s good nuff to me.
---
have fun getting hooked in the basement
---
Every encounter with this killer has been like that for me
---
Yeah but her face ain't as pretty and her ass is FAT, not GOOD, like Kate's
---
Yeah, *I* get it, but ppl are judgmental. I realize it was a candid moment and we can't all be perfect all the time, but yeah I think you should re-up without audio.
---
I've def. said some horrible stuff from the other side of the screen, I think we all have. Just try to keep your uploads positive.
---
This is what happens when you enter a survivor game as Claudette tbh
---
1. Yes, because Killer's couldn't do anything with the hatch. Thus, they couldn't actively prevent that last escape.
---
2. You work for it by getting all the gens done before your team dies, by finding the hatch first or even by bringing a key into the match.
---
That's chibi for you :)
---
Personal taste at that point, I think James face is the only actual one that looks like the art pic does, Kate’s ain’t bad but compared to her pic like Laurie she Garbo
---
Then you invest in the bloodweb...
---
This is why you bring a mori for each darkly clothed Claudette. So you only have to find them once
---
I think the best way to implement this stuff is to just add a ranked/unranked mode.
---
Most people will play unranked and they can use whatever, and those that do want to play seriously can play ranked, with one of the limitations I made above
---
It definitely is, but BHVR **definitely** isn't one to focus on quality over quantity, lol. Also your username makes you impossible to take seriously lmao
---
he's unbalanced in few things. being 115 killer with inbuilt instadown he doesn't have a cooldown for his chainsaw, doesn't need to recharge it and while revving has survivor running speed.
---
with that he gets way too many BBQ snipes plus too good at protecting hooks and totems. no other killer can do that apart from Omega Blink Nurse but that's add-ons, it's not inbuilt. and you still get two fatigues giving sirvivors more time.
---
of course Nurse is op. but if there were no Nurse, i bet y'all would hate on Billy as much as i do. i will face a Nurse any time instead of Billy cause there's nothing less fun than simply looping and getting instadowned cause of insane hitboxes Billy has. i fukin love hiding, running away from Nurse, trick her. and i play on red ranks, i rarely get trash Nurses. but amount of Billies with same builds and same boring tactics as insane and i wish it stopped.
---
I like Survivors having a chance.
---
In the past, the hatch was too powerful, now it's fine.
---
Do I know you *
---
Yes items run out use them wisely.
---
If you need a perk grind and save for what survivor you want buy them and level them up its what i do. 
---
Yeah i dont think you can tell a build apart from one another. 
---
The thing i want you to take away is that you need to grind and learn. You need to play killer, you need to play more than 80 hrs, and you need realize you dont understand the game yet juat play morw and you will.
---
That's what the other option is... Did you skip the second one lol?
---
I feel like it really depends on the killer at this point.
---
Also quick thing these are my opinions on some of these killers so your views may not line up with mine but I'd like too hear why.
---
Some killers can get shit done but still have counter play. Hillbilly, Hag, The Shape. All feel balanced too survivors in my opinion (except for some addons and perks.) 
---
Some though just have too easily exploited problems, are inefficient, or are out classed. Bubba, legion, Trapper. 
---
But one I think really hurts the balance and is probably one of the least counterable if not the least thing in this whole game. 
---
It's nurse. Sure she is not broken for most people who play her but if they know how too play her there is almost no chance of winning because of the meta right now and how the game works, she has almost unarguably the best map control and chase potential. All of this is ignoring her multi blink addons which are insane.
---
So while survivors do have an edge over some killers, some other ones are in my opinion equal in the strength too the combined strength of the survivors.
---
I get you, i just feel like if im consistently seeing the same like 8-10 perks and most of them are cross character , I feel like that says something about either the strength of those perks or even the weakness of the ones that are underused
---
 Poor Dwight. Please tell me you released him safely back into the wild.
---
She would be the biggest
---
I do notice a little bit of a difference compared to the artwork and the actual model.
---
The model isn't bad looking at all, but Kate's artwork is STUNNING
---
Tbh half the time it's manical laughing when a trap goes off...i should probably never stream haha.
---
potentially locking them to tier two or even just changing the numbers on them slightly throughout the tiers when their learned by different characters
---
Reddit:Ranks dont matter. Also Reddit: Only things in Red ranks are real gameplay.
---
On a srs note, I used to actually bring that if I saw flashlights b/c I swear flashlights could blind in a handful of frames. Anymore I never do b/c dodging them seems to be effective. Idk if I got better, flashlights were nerfed, or both.
---
Why should I do that and not the people being camped? Why can’t they get over it and feel the need to post this? I know these posts are just for survivors mains to comfort each other in saying camping bad over and over until either bhvr either removes camping or they get tired doing the same thing over and over and realise how useless these posts really are. 
---
Yes it brings more to the table and that’s what I want. I want interesting discussion, for a long time I’ve been wondering what are the purpose of these posts but now I know there isn’t one and their defence for them are all the same.
---
Remember 1.9...?
---
(Hides bloody hook) Oh yes, I released him at the farm
---
Yeah
---
I...I know. I'm aware. I understand the concept of slugging.
---
Honestly they could just buff boil over to do that and make that perk more than a meme
---
I think the dedicated severs will help it in being more inconsistent. (I heard it helps the hit boxes as well somehow but I dont know)
---
So I would wait till the dedicated severs are on the regular build of the game and see if it's still inconsistent.
---
Hopefully it fixes it but I wound still keep an eye on it.
---
I'm legit watching that movie rn. Lmao
---
Maniacal laughing is great! It's in-character. Just keep at it, and try to always play devil's advocate to yourself. Keep in mind that even though maybe most people are being toxic or what have you, that doesn't mean you should judge a new person that way. Your stream will attract a higher audience if you keep it positive!
---
tbh. the devs just need to buff underused perks. but some are great when used together with others. for example. my build atm is lith, dance with me, quick &amp; quiet and mettle of man. great for runners. people just need to get out of the old mind set that self care is a must have. it’s not anymore.
---
Boil over doesn’t increase your struggle percentage though. I’ve never gotten free with book over. Ever.
---
Why do you think it's needed/wanted?
---
Chalmers: Yes. I should be- Good Lord! What is happening in there?
---
Im slowly seeing it less and less. It is annoying though same as slugging for the 4k
---
What will be the difference between modes besides perk limitations? 
---
Same BP gains? Everyone will play easier mode. Different gains? Most will play the mode that will give more BPs.
---
Monitor and Abuse , Dead Rabbit, Memorial Flower, and any of the green addons are good. His brown addons are awful. 
---
Get close to people but not too close when stalking. If you get to tier 2, chase them and only stalk if uou concede the chase or when theyre looping. The best time to activate tier 3 is during a chase you are sure to win
---
I know lol I’m saying they could buff it to *make* it do that since it already involves the process of making struggling difficult but not all that effectively
---
Well yeah, thats what I typically do lol
---
No good deed goes unpunished.
---
But that's just it.
---
There are alot of decent perks that see no use because everyone runs the same OP shit on both sides
---
There’s so much stacked into the second perk maybe give either a less time on exposed and increased aura or get rid of one of the effects. Overall, pretty good but the killer should probably be a 115% movement as their power doesn’t damage survivors
---
That scared the shit out of me in Monto’s video.
---
Just one mode increases your rank and the other doesn't.
---
Because everyone on both sides constantly complains about how the same perks are used by everyone?
---
True, clear vision into a garbage human
---
That's convenient for the economy.. :p GG devs
---
good
---
if it was darker for survivors than killers? IMO it wouldn't be that big of a deal but there might be something unforeseen I'm not considering.
---
Also yeah it did! It was just not very clear in the text for the perk for some reason, unlike Lightborn. It's not very well documented on the [DBD wiki](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Shadowborn) but if you check the bottom, you'll see that in patch 1.8.3 they removed the  "clearer vision" buff and in the trivia it mentions that both it and lightborn had their lighting effects removed "due to the Developers wanting more control over the lighting conditions on the Maps".
---
[Also here's a video for comparison if you still don't believe me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lMZEHl9Iyw)
---
Prove Thyself, Toolboxes and Deliverance are really not major BS or OP shit... Whereas killers have a lot more things than here listed, such as ranged Nurse, Insidious (major BS because its only real use is hardcamping), Iridescent Head, Rancor to an extent, Fragrant Tuft/Tombstone if other survivors just let Myers stalk, that whole Mori thing, and then stuff like Treatment Mode grabs and other pretty BS interactions such as Pig blocking boxes...
---
But I do agree with the sentiment: both sides can be OP or BS, it changes round-to-round, and you do have the ability to use these things and ways to play in accordance to your opponents. There are still some things that definitely should be addressed though, on both sides.
---
Oh of course! I love this game, and I doubt I'll stop playing it anytime soon.
---
You can at REALLLY low ranks, as the requirements to double pip is lower.
---
Okay silly me I’ll just get 5 gens done before the team of potatoes die or get 2 done then just run around trying to find the hatch before anyone else.
---
Dead by Daylight: The Fortnite Chapter
---
New Survivor: John Wick (Perks: Do the Floss, Dab on the Haters, Skills from the Battle Bus)
---
New Killer: Default Skin (Power: Golden SCAR, Perks: Prime Subscription to Ninja, Best Mates, Hex: Epic Gamer Time)
---
New Map: Tilted Towers
---
Just imagine a Claudette p3. Self care, botany knowledge, empathy and 4 other perks of their choice e.g balanced landing, adrenaline, mettle of man, ds. How could you think that would end well
---
I mean, what they could do is say "Every second where it's not worked on, the gate loses 2% Progress if there are 2 Survivors, 6% if there are 3 and 10% if there are 4."
---
So 1 Survivor = no regress. 
---
2 Survivors = slow regression
---
3 &amp; 4 Survivors: strong regression.
---
It's similair to the gens, the more survivor there are woeking on the same, the less ig's effectiv. Nowhere in the game is it explained, but it's still a mechanic. ^^
---
I'm gonna be real this is scarily well edited
---
Yes. As shitty as face camping can feel it has his weaknesses. Plus it is discouraged as you lose points for doing so
---
I remember this artwork! I'm not sure who did it though.
---
That’s not how luck works.
---
I've never run any of these 😔🤙
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Rank 
---
It shows the point requirements to pip on there. Rank 20-17 can double pip with only 3 iridescents. Dont know if the act of double pipping gives you merciless victory tho.
---
I camp sometimes if I really think something may come out of it.
---
For instance, if every single time I've hooked someone they got down within 15 seconds, I may camp if I'm playing a stealth killer because I know they're coming.
---
I'd like an option "I try to not ...".
---
A wise man once told me, "It is not your job to ensure other people are having fun, for your enjoyment is the only one you have control over". If facecamping gets your rocks off man, do whatever you want. Am I saying it's the nicest thing to do? No, but as long YOU are having fun playing YOUR game, do as you must to maintain your own level of enjoyment. No survivor will find facecamping, tunneling, NOED, etc, to be fun. No Killer will find being looped for 2+gens, MoM, old Dstrike, Flashlight saves, etc, to be fun. The 2 roles directly conflict each other. Do what you think is fun and that's it.
---
You should feel safe if you made it to a pallet before the killer was close enough. Pallets arent supposed to help killers out they are supposed to act as a defence

---
I mean this mans is clearly cheating and should not be allowed to play dbd, i feel like ever again. Think about it, if you are that trash you have to resort to lag switching and ruining the game for others, should you even be allowed to play at all?
---
It slows the game down just a litt-Oh wait. Sorry. Force of habit.
---
“**SAVE ME!!!**”- Hooked Dwight
---
Holy fuck
---
Or atleast make it optional, usefull for new killers.
---
I too will ree with you.
---
Me the other day lmao
---
I went from "why did I do that?" to "holy shit big brain moment"
---
Yeaj, it is cheating and fucking stupid. And yes, report them and they'll get a ban eventually. If not, soon enough they have to use their skill (which is probably non existant) or quit.
---
Which stealth killer? If you say Pig I will love you.
---
you're right, the chainsaw aint hard to hit but you will never get the chance to even use it against good survivors meanwhile doc can snipe gens and get people to tier 3 fairly fast
---
I'd fear that huntress.
---
I know this’ll probably piss a few people off, but as much as the community hates it, I still love using Mettle of Man. I think it’s really fun to use but nowhere near as bad as Decisive used to be.
---
Michael is always a joy
---
Mostly the pig. Sometimes freddy. Much more rarely insidious bubba.
---
Dr.dbd here. I'm going to prescribe you spine chill for your survivor and noed with ruin as needed for your killer. I hope you get to feeling better.
---
Serious question: how will you prove that killer was lag switching?
---
Trying to find the crouched Piggy is like playing a game of ‘Where’s Wally?’
---
YOO DOOGIE, PICK UP THE PHONE!
---
I never load into the game if I bring a cake, happened literally every time it became a joke with my friends.
---
Ever played against skilled swf? those are really rough games and gens get done in like 3 minutes with ruin, im sure you understand why someone would like insurance like noed and even then the perk can be countered by doing totems before the end game
---
Op, you know what your problem is?
---
I’m too good looking
---
I have it recorded mate, legit was fine the whole chase then i vault a window, teleport behind the window get hit and do the same again, every time i went down i vaulted a window and lagged back behind it.
---
It's how i play.
---
Scratched Mirror Myers in Lerys, the Game or the School. 
---
Spirit with Prayer Bands, Make your Choice, Surveillance etc.
---
Hag with the "no phantom spawns"
---
Wraith with silent bell+ghost
---
Myers again, but just chosing to stay in Tier 1, derank on purpose while using Surveilance, M&amp;A, NOED etc. to jumpscare them to death. 
---
It's my only pleasure in this game. Scaring People. :)
---
Common sense
---
I love you. NoHomo
---
So no one would play:
---
Wraith
---
Trapper
---
Doctor
---
Leatherface
---
Legion
---
Myers
---
Pig
---
Dwight
---
Ace
---
David
---
Adam
---
Tapp
---
Or Jeff
---
I see. Have I found another intellectual Jeff main?
---
Chick with the ruler still able to Carry the professional fighter like he’s nothing.
---
I really like this. Much respect to the artist.
---
What is this a crossover episode?
---
You shouldn't play DbD if you not enjoy it, simple as that.
---
Bill4life
---
I didnt see the second panel but still sang in my head... de faq
---
Yeah, Michael does not fit that tier at all. If he lost to someone, he’d stare at them for a minute with his intense breathing, then reach over and choke them to death.
---
So, high ping and lag... where's the proof of "switching"?
---
&lt;3
---
You can't cheat on console

---
And sell your soul to satan
---
lol was a 60 ping game mate.
---
I was about to say "Petition to have killers go into 3rd person when entering the cornfield" but upon further consideration, I have decided retract this idea because it'll make the killer OP af
---
Guess I'm not playing Hag
---
They're all the same
---
I will sell 10% of my soul to satan. With accumulating interest each year I stay alive of 2% so if I'd have to live for over 40 years if satan plans on getting anymore than 90% of my soul.
---
If the exit gates open, I’ll camp the hook, there’s no reason not to.
---
Sooo you just want us to make you bleed out on the ground, is that it?
---
Sacrificed 3 (one happen very early in the game and I was actually scared that it seemed like tunneling) and let one get the hatch. This was a long game going on past 20 minutes and this was probably my second to third time playing killer. 
---
I was also shocked to find the first person killed stayed until the very end of the game.
---
.....just use the traps before the last gens pops?
---
I was watching a streamer go against a Myers who pulled a stunt similar to that. Name was “Trust Me Myers”
---
Yeah but what if you’re the last survivor and they don’t know where you are
---
So you're telling me that every single game you play, you're using a key?
---
Freddy probably thinks the Legion are insufferable. They’re a bunch of edgy teens, and do remember Freddy does have a history of murdering teenagers.
---
You can see 60 ping in lobby and get 300+ spikes during the game. It happens. But I still can't see how it is a proof of "lag switching". How will you prove those lag spikes were artificially forced by killer?
---
The real mvps are the guys who sit at the exit and let you down them for bloodpoints before crawling out
---
Honestly that would be hilarious. Instead of rummaging through a Jigsaw box, you’re desperately pressing buttons to make yourself a cappuccino.
---
Rank reset is truly beutifull
---
Why are piggies always so nice?
---
Just curious who is Vigo?
---
I got a Doctor who asked us to farm - he got us all into tier 3 on The Game, in the room next to the basement - and when he started downing more than 1 person, we had no chance with the madness - all 4 of us ended up in the basement and surrounding hooks :(
---
But not me, when playing Claudette, cuz I got calm spirit.
---
I mean im assuming its just lag tbh. 
---
If you are that bothered send a report ticket with recorded footage
---
Okay that came out a bit aggressive.... Anyways yeah Billy-balance posts piss me the fuck off, and I just wanted to mention that they will never nerf base-Billy, only carburator and primer bulb most likely.
---
Objectively balanced builds
---
So he's talking out his ass then?
---
I want to know what you type to get that as an autocorrect.
---
maining small survivors like feng min and what not does not seem to save my ass!!
---
Rank 1 killer and survivor does acc mean shit hun, it shows that I can see both sides of the argument. Sure, noed can be frustrating to play against, but tbh this post was made to stir tea, so imma leave now
---
*Wiggling. Struggling is the last phase of being in the hook. If a perk were introduced that flat out lowered the Wiggle time, it would give the Survivors a crazy amount of leverage. The Wiggling mechanic is not a guarantee that you'll escape from the killer, you got caught by the killer, your opportunity windows to escape are becoming sparse.
---
There are several things in the game that can give you a better chance of escaping. Decisive Strike, Boil Over, Flip Flop, teammates running Sabotage, pallet stunning, flashlight stunning, or body blocking. 
---
It does happen every so often that you can wiggle out, so always try. If a teammate died on a hook that's in a corner of a map, try to let the killer down you in that area as the hook will be disabled, and they will be forced to walk to another one, so your wiggle escape chances become better.
---
Balanced by whom? Who will "objectively" decide on the cost of each perk? Devs? "Top-tier" players? Steam forums? In-game survey?
---
STORY OF MY LIFE. Im not good at DBD at ALL but all of this ^ is so relateable. And yet. AND YET. I fkn love this game its so wild omg
---
Well, you didn't say anything about intentionally dc'ing so, you're already better than half the motherfuckers I solo with.
---
Bless his little nerdy heart
---
You think that's what he said?
---
Not very accurate
---
&gt; nce was a 90 ping game so still green, yet i spent the whole game teleporting around. 
---
Sounds like there might as well be something wrong on your end.  90 milliseconds latency is nowhere near "teleport"-grade lag.  I routinely play 150+ and it's still okay.  Make sure you don't have any large traffic spikes on your internet connection.  Siblings downloading stuff, computers updating, etc.
---
Nah there are a lot more. Probably the half of all perks but not for general use on all killers
---
But BBQ i would run on every game even if it would not show survivors - i just want the bloodpoints
---
With "point buy" system you will be forced to use less viable perks or to play with fewer than 4. Of course those two perks were used as an extreme example. But the question remains the same - is forcing players to use worse perks is a good way to "fight" the meta?
---
I never ever DC intentionally but I honestly feel fucking tempted to when I get haddonfield. Feels whenever I burn another map offering someone in a survivor squad burns a Strode Key and of course they have balanced landing. I lost two jigsaw pieces in a row this way. I just hate it. I feel like it's the most survivor sided map in the game. The only consolation prize is Railgun Doc can zap survivors in the next house over which never fails to amuse me.
---
They already fit the killer role so it al works out
---
IT IS OVER NINE THOUSAND XD
---
I check, He had nothing that could down me, at first I assume He was chainsawing people. Then, I got hit by the hammer and down in one shot..I assume the game gave him NOED because the guy got the last gen done in time when he hit me..But,he had no noed or any perks that cause expose. I can only assume there is a glitch with the chainsaw and hammer cause he would randomly rev his chain saw and not use It or something.
---
nothing wrong on my end, got the fastest internet available in my area a year ago and have never lagged once, can have 4 different devices streaming 4k video while downloading somethinf at the same time and still not lag, i would know i tested it and have done numerous times. There is nothing wrong with my internet at all.
---
I thought that as well
---
Did you read my post?
---
Does anyone else feel nurse has too long of a lunge after she blinks ? I feel like the more she blinks in one go, the smaller the lunge should be. It’s frustrating being able to dodge her but then she just does the biggest lunge and it’s all for nothing.
---
I’m willing to bet you’ve never used to combination you just described
---
Also, great taste. Wish we had some more obscure villains in the game, Tallman from phantasm or Angela from Sleepaway Camp would be great
---
[deleted]
---
The broad suggestion/topic is white different from mentioning 2 specific perks as an 'extreme example' .. like the literal answer to the question you posted is:  No, he is not saying forcing everyone to use those perks is a good solution. Because that's not the solution he's putting forth.
---
I was saying this very thing the other day. A lot of people bitch and complain about the game, but fail to realize the devs are actually trying. They listen to the community and constantly give us updates. Gamers are never satisfied. If they weren't giving us updates we'd be bitching about that.
---
Good luck with that, considering 4v1 nature of the game.
---
I said it's a meme. I don't actually think it's toxic. But pallet stunning and blinding aren't toxic either if that's the point you were making. They're features in the game.
---
And?
---
How does that have to do with anything at all?
---
We've all known this.
---
Seems like you just wanna start a fight
---
THIS IS NOT MY FINAL FORM HAHAHA
---
1. Throughput (aka what you call "fast internet") has little to do with latency.
---
2. What kind of internet connection is it?  Cable by any chance?
---
3. How does your computer connect to your router?
---
4. Unless you're an expert at networking, I'm hesitant to trust your judgement/test results on the matter.  Sorry. 
---
5. Yes, it's possible that there's nothing wrong on your end.
---
6. Objectively, 90ms RTT is nowhere near what you'd feel ingame.  That should be obvious, right?
---
I hope you've looked at the rules they have for weapons and such, because many cons would still be really strict on that. Looks good so far tho
---
The ending to Sleepaway still creeps me out :s
---
There are no public leaderboards, matchmaking is not very good with ranks... So what will be incentive to play ranked if a) BP gains are equal between unranked and ranked, b) your choices of perks are limited in ranked and c) there are no benefits of playing ranked?
---
I wanted to type "invest" lol.
---
Ok, so you're sending out survey "How much will Ruin cost?" With majority of playerbase playing survivors, how objective will results be? What about MoM results?
---
I don't use Nurse's (bc I don't have it), I mainly play killer, but I play some survivor, and I don't think it's too strong. It's good, but not THAT good. Just don't heal in the terror radius
---
And the dumbass of the year award goes to.... Dweeb.
---
Sounds good tome but the progression should regress a little bit over time tho
---
Yea, I think everyone would've preferred Englund Freddy with Langenkamp's Nancy, but licensing issues suck.

---
And it got worth with EGC since hatch always spawns. If a killer goes tryhard and want a 4k he always have to slug l, even when there are 5 gens left. Thats the annoying part
---
It's definitely not forcing players to use 2 specific perks. See why using that 'extreme example' is grossly misleading and mischaracterizing his suggestion?
---
Man I play the game the way I fucking want it.  Some people tell me that abusing loops is not a thing. They clearly don’t know about infinite. Something that shouldn’t be in the game in the first place.  Sometimes I have a laugh camping sometimes I don’t camp. I also play survivor and run OOB all the time.  Thing is nobody should tell you how to play the game.  Like when they call me on tunneling. Like you just rescue the survivor basically in front of me should I just play dumb and let it go and change focus nah that is not my style. Could care less about a downvote on Reddit lol I speak my mind
---
I mean... Why wouldn't you run MoM? It is literally a free Septic every  match.
---
That’s awesome I wish I could sound like Donald Duck. When I play dbd I do voices as well like Herbert the pervert and mostly king of the hill and family guy but I wish I could sound like Donald Duck
---
Someone here the killer can use whispers.
---
So, survivors can use adrenaline or unbreakable in this situation and still escape
---
But you are right, it's stupid.
---
Really? That would be interesting to see but do you think it would really fit into their gameplay design ?
---
Loud  waaah incoming.
---
Let’s establish, first and foremost, that DH is different than everything you just mentioned. 
---
DH is the second best exhaustion perk and if a survivor is in open area, DH is now useless against a half decent killer. 
---
But yes, adrenaline, MoM, DS/BT and an exhaustion perk is a very common build you’ll see in high ranks. The insta heal doesn’t happen all the time, but it is seen sometimes. Survivors will pick Haddonfield, Ormund, or Crotus often to complement their builds. 
---
This is a real thing in higher rank gameplay, especially now that not everyone can get to high rank.
---
So where's the killers second chance when the last survivor finds the hatch first? Unbalanced and unfair, fix pls!
---
“The Faces”
---
???
---
Why not ‘The Strangers’?
---
So where's the killers second chance when the last survivor finds.the hatch first? Unbalanced and unfair, fix pls!
---
Gotta talk from your throat with tons of sliava in there
---
To be fair, they didn't go to the exit gate that was close to them and went to the other one that was further away.
---
Surveillance is a substitute for skill, and eventually you'll have enough gamesense that you just won't need it. Whispers is not a noob perk, but at the same time, it's only needed on a few killers. Whispers allows you to save lots of time looking for survivors by narrowing down where they AREN'T. Sloppy isn't really that great, it's 2 effects are that survivors bleed more, and heal 20% slower. Healing by default takes 16 seconds, so it's another 3.2 seconds, or another 6.4 against Self Care's 32 seconds, so really not that great.
---
As for perks, as Legion is more in line with an M1 killer, the best perks would be BBQ, Ruin, Enduring, and Spirit Fury. However, if you want to be off meta, any other on-hit perks would work, say Thanatophobia and Save The Best For Last, or Third Seal or something. 
---
As for Monitor, it WAS better pre nerf, as Legion had a smaller terror radius, and he now has default 32m, you can attempt to be sneaky. General playstyle is use your ability to get an easy first hit, or multiple stacks if you're using STBFL, and then loop for 2nd hit.
---
haven’t played dbd in a while but is this really true?? :o
---
Originally it was going to be called The Faces in production and I thought it sounded creepy.
---
What's to stop the entity manipulating an alien into thinking that the entity is a queen alien? Then it would happily do what it's "mother" tells it to. I'm sure the entity could strike a real with a willing predator to have endless hunts. As for pennywise, the only lore I could make for it is that the form a symbiotic relationship, with one feeding on fear, and the other feeding off hope
---
And "OP" is objective? I mean, when you read "BBQ is OP", you agree?
---
Also, would perks have different price for different killers? Would Bamboozle cost more for Billy than for Nurse?
---
I love it! 
---
It looks absolutely incredible; especially the moon, her hair, and the blood drip from the knife.
---
Sure in a similar way, glad you see that.
---
Thanks for the advice! Looks like imma need to start investing in teachables haha
---
It's essentially minecraft
---
Except instead of a creeper
---
It's a Giant Slavic woman with axes
---
I used the sharpest tool in the shed
---
I didn’t even know it was buffed, so i’m assuming people were telling me ab it pre-buff bc that sounds absolutely awful. I think i’ll stick with Whispers then until I get a bit more sense of where people might be, thanks!
---
BBQ and Chilli is very OP on Billy, and a good Billy will just go from person to person with it.
---
As for the other point, i'm not sure, after all, i'm not a top tier player, and I'll let them decide
---
There is some strong builds in that list of yours, especially prayer beads spirit
---
This dumb shit better get lots of upvotes
---
Don't say that he Has a valid reason.
---
That was the "new" matchmaking system, but it fucked up PC queues a bit so they reverted it
---
Wow, talk about comparing apples to zebras. Very rational and well thought out argument.
---
"I die all the time!"
---
*Runs No Mither*
---
Hmm... I think I found the problem lol.
---
Anyway, what system you on? If you are on PS4 I can add you to my squad, keep you safe
---
Impressive! Looking forward to the coloring!
---
Yeah now you're just fishing for an argument.
---
I'm not replying to you anymore. You want to go fight someone, well it won't be me
---
No Mither doesnt rlly counter these things but.. it renders them useless
---
It’s an obnoxious perk. But at least you can avoid it completely with certain killers. Until/if they ever address MoM, my M1 killers will be bench warmers.
---
This is nice, but some people would clearly be useless (hi Ace, how's those 1 and a half worthless perks going for ya?)
---
I would much prefer playing a Hillbilly over a very good Nurse or Spirit. I can counter Billy much easier at Red Ranks than a very good Nurse or Spirit.
---
Pallet stunning is toxic? What level 20 killers have you been hanging around?
---
Tell me how is it toxic?
---
Laurie?
---
The only crutch perk in the game is noed. Don’t let this Reddit community or anybody tell you otherwise. 
---
You play this game for yourself, not the other side. You can only show mercy when it is applicable.
---
Kill the survivors
---
I'm gonna break your heart then... We always feel left out :*(
---
Yeah i have colored perks, but i didnt know about colored, shaded perks. i dont know how that works
---
Most likely Laurie.
---
i’m dead cx
---
The problem with this is people don’t understand what tunneling is. So there’s like 3-4 different definitions of what tunneling is floating around.
---
The killer perks aren't so great either. Dying Light is so so, unnerving presence is only good on killers that rely on big terror radius (aka Doctor)
---
Chucky, Pinhead, The Thing, 
---
Also, Happy to see some Trick ‘r Treat representation! Phenomenal film
---
Worth it
---
Teabagging they could stop as easily as Friday the 13th did it.
---
Just make it so it takes a one or two second cooldown on the crouch button.
---
Flashlight clicking isn't inherintly toxic though, but I suppose the same could be done for the flashlight too, with a one/two second cooldown after you shut it off.
---
I love it as well. If we somehow cant get jason then id still love this to be added even as a dbd original. Instead of killer mom and son it could be some weird brains and brawn kinda thing or some twisted version of Jekyll and Hyde. I fo however think this would be an amazing way to bring jason into the game and make him unique. With Scream coming in and an already existing  Meyers im afraid that  "The Slasher" style of killer might be overdone
---
Prestige should happen after you spend a certain amount of bloodpoints for that character. Not when you get to 50, you just reset.
---
P3 imho isn’t anything scary or intimidating. Imagine a P tier requiring something like 40 million BP investment. Then you see a P3 Billy or whatever. You know that dude has played his Billy a long ass time.
---
Ofc, it’s whatever at this point because the prestige system I doubt will ever get a change.
---
I feel like teabagging in this context isn't BM. Not much else we can do without a Thanks! emote
---
Hmm, you could try running Premenition?
---
Then you'd know the killer was coming and could hightail it outta there. A good build for you might be:
---
Urban Evasion, Premenition, any exhaustion perk and any fourth perk you like
---
I thought I was alone in thinking this, her lunge feels hella long.
---
There's nothing wrong with running it, and looping. It's being a dick about running it. Teabagging at the gates during the last 10 seconds while I sit there hitting you while you teabag, proc mettle of man, you instaheal, teabagging, then call me trash that I hate. Sore winners. I never fucking say "EZ GG" after stomping. (Although I do like to make the "YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE" joke after a NOED + blood warden power play with Freddy)
---
The joke is that you're already playing with exposed status so majority of the time, those perks won't stress you out (at least not more than you already are)
---
yeah that makes sense, it would probably have to come along with significant balance changes or even complete reworks to some perks, which in themselves i think would resolve the issue, if everything was a bit more inline i feel like we'd see more variety, i just always seem to see ruin/bbq or self care/decisive in every game multiple times
---
Imo noed is more toxic. Since it's kind of a free 4 man even if the survivors do complete the objective.
---
I really should level up Wraith to get Lightborn, because I hate flashlights so much
---
Thanks
---
Ok, I know I’m bout to get some flak for this, but I really ship Meg and Frank. I know, Frank and Julie are canon, but I just love protagonist x antagonist ship. I just feel like Julie is just not that good of a character, and she’s pretty much the Legion member with the least distinguished characteristics.
---
Drug slang
---
No problem, thank you for sharing it! Ɛ&gt;
---
Ah there is nothing in the game that feels as good as taking out a toxic jerk.
---
I remember an Ace once got pulled off the hook right next to an open gate, RIGHT after I put him on it, and then seemed AFK.
---
I hit him, BT activates and he runs out the gate
---
I haven't seen many glitches on console but once had a Nea floating behind me after I unhooked her. Was both the funniest and most terrifying thing I've seen.
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
I did not say I rather DS. It's just mettle of men is literally a better DS
---
Yeah, totally agree with you, vaulting or hiding in lockers shouldn't counter tombstone, but you know, I prefered to survive, rather die and return in lobby simulator for 10-15 minutes (I'm on PS4).
---
Nice, please submit your final cosplay :) I love Frank.
---
Take it from someone who played WoW forever. Lore isn’t concrete and can be changed at the discretion of the devs.
---
All it takes is, “...but the entity was impressed with this ruthless and cunning hunter”.
---
I do, Dwights have gone pretty much extibct in the top ranks, rank resets equals Dwight Hunting Season
---
Very gud
---
Well, all you can do against MoM and others meta survivor perks is to play meta killers like Nurse, Billy, Spirit or Huntress. 
---
Maybe try to use as many instant down perks as you can, like NOED, Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, Rancor, so you don't give enough stacks for MoM users or their MoM don't activate because they are healthy and you have an instant down. It's pretty much all you can do against MoM If you don't want to play with top tier killers, just spam instant down perks and hope they will work.
---
It is in the description.
---
DS needed a skill check and I actually liked it pre nerf because you could swing right before the skill check and they would, 95% of the time, miss. MoM is a no skill, no counterplay, free save perk and I loath it. The same people who complained about the Legion not having counterplay are the people who run this perk. I hate it with a burning passion and it's the only reason I play killers who counter it.
---
It's depressing, isn't it.
---
True, But wake up! Was in the shop a few weeks ago, is totally usesless and then aftercare? No one uses aftercare. It would be easier to use Bond which was just in the Shrine aswell
---
Exactly
---
Maybe I'll wait to see how the new ones looks! I'm super picky about cosmetics-- I've been running candle wraith, Glowy Huntress &amp; Trapper, Prestige Pig and Myers, along with Burial Spirit. 
---
So it might be worth it if only to get a good skin. Everyone I see uses the Susie skins, and that's okay-- but I don't want to look like every single Legion ever, Haha. 
---
But the other one you suggested is a good choice too that I don't see often!
---
Thanks man. That guy was next level douche.
---
I highly suggest him! He's fun! Although, I've seen some crazy clown plays too. I def get not going for the plague. After my huntress days, I think I'm good when it comes to aiming. LOL.
---
apparently i'm a complete moron(surv found a key and opened the hatch)
---
Survivors, waited in the gate when everyone was safe since forever. It's still shitty from the killers, so now killers can be time waisting jerks too
---
I admire your thoughts on this.
---
I think it’s more so having your fucking skull fractured by a unit of a man
---
Ruin breaks super quickly and is very easily to counter, either by running small game or playing SWF and having person track it while the others power through it, while MoM has no conuterplay unless you are playing certain killers or have a mori.
---
You hear a huge skull cracking sound during the head stomping, pretty sure they are dead.
---
Yeah, the important thing is to not take it personally when you're on the receiving end.
---
Unfortunately some players are just bad people, or have been around these bad players long enough to have the bad players BM rub off on them.
---
My advice would be to not treat the game so seriously because there are so many variables in every game that it's almost never actually fair enough to be considered a competition of skill, at least not without lone wolfing it when it suits you (letting others take the fall for your mistakes, letting others die on hooks to facilitate your own escape, etc). 
---
In your former teammates case, they think you're to blame for them losing. When really it sounds more like you carried them. And their pride can't deal with that if they also think of the game as a fair competition.
---
Yes you did. NOED is easy to avois by cleansing totems. But if survivors just rush through gens without doing 10sec totrms in between the killer earned to punish them. Their objective is to survive. You survive by doing gens and be aware of specific perks which can cost you the game.
---
Funny how you say you earned adrenaline tho. I can hide in a corner all day long and wait for gens to be completed. How is that earned in any way?
---
Yes, and nurse is in a good place right now
---
Thank god you don't lose pips at those ranks holy shit.
---
It sounds interesting, so I can help in my spare time
---
Negan really wouldn't fit as a killer at all but having some kind of survivor only content from The walking dead? Hell yeah.
---
Until we kill everyone, we can’t feel left out if we’re the only one left :)
---
How dare BHVR steal from Roblox creators.
---
Yeah this is better than almost every scenario where you escape the match
---
We just wanna bring everyone to the end game screen with us
---
Everything about nurse is frustrating.
---
So what perks was he actually running? Do you have a clip of it happening? It was probably lag, hacking on console is pretty difficult.
---
Why do you say that about Negan?
---
Yes it does, I tested on a kyf :)
---
Pretty sure is faster than old frenzy speed but need to fact check that
---
i didnt know that lol . yeah sounds about right. you would need medical attention right away to survive this lol
---
You can’t hack or modify files on console, you can’t even connect to psn/Xbox live is the system detects a modified file, I don’t know what you ran into but it wasn’t a hacker.
---
I'm guessing this list is without gameplay just looking at their powers so if that is how the list is made I agree.
---
In reality, it is very different trapper is already a bad killer bc traps aren't always effective just small things like those
---
Did you spell it devour soap cause the killer cleaned the floor with you?
---
You're kinda right. I play "Hostage Doc" (Anti Skillcheck) and people would miss their DS all the time because of the random placement + Unnerving.
---
It’s actually 754 billion views
---
It can still activate from something like a chainsaw hit if the survivor is injured.
---
Should be added to the perk Fire UP at least
---
Omg I'd SO be down to do that kind of animation! ...Although maybe not as pixel art, since I've only ever animated with my regular digital work (or it wouldn't hurt to attempt). I will keep that concept in mind, for sure! Thank you :D
---
Lol Actually it is 754k views
---
A 17 year old built like that shouldn't be able to single handedly pick up a grown adult and give them a shoulder ride. To make sense of it I like to think that the entity gives all its champions super human strength and abilities e.g. Increased awareness. Even if they're already powerful, the entity makes them stronger. This is backed up by Freddy's entry when the entity reshapes his powers.
---
Both sides have perks you can’t counter, and most of them aren’t great perks, MOM is the only one that you can’t counter that is also really good
---
I also think all of his perks are better for, with, and against newer players. Games tend to go on longer, so that means more pebbles + chances to get Autodidact stacks, and Deliverance saves you when your teammates aren't helping you out.
---
Recently peanits said it's hard to make bunny feng because the head needs to link with other torsos, but what if it didn't?
---
My suggestion is that when you are not using the torso, the hood becomes a beanie, and if you are indeed using the torso and the head they get linked
---
I was mid sneeze when I clicked that link...That was a weird laugh afterwards.
---
This post was about chapter 10, youre super late
---
CrUtCh PeRkEr OP!!! /s
---
So?
---
I'm not saying that I like to play as weak as possible. I say that i like to be scary.
---
That's betrayal
---
Bloodwarden greatest perk in the game
---
The fix is already there- closing.
---
Looks fantastic! Pink hair susie best susie. Great work!
---
Now tell me, what can wraith, freddy, hag, nurse, spirit, clown, pig, trapper, plague, michael use instead of standard attacks??
---
Chainsawing a decent survivor who is always on a loop is going to be really REALLY difficult with billy, let alone bubba. Pig’s dash can’t work all the times, most of the times the survivor will abandon the loop. Michael’s instadown will only delay the MoM, not completely delete it. Also michael’s instadown is temporary... trapper’s traps? Do you seriously think that his traps are THAT reliable? You’d be lucky if 2 people get trapped in an entire game most of the time... 
---
the only ones who can do something are huntress with aim on point and a billy if the MoM user is really bad.
---
I empathise. My favourite new thing is the survivors who teabag inside the gates far away enough from the exit for you to down them and pick them up, only to hit you with DS so they can teabag some more and run out. I’m not a douchebag killer and I don’t run the overpowered shit I have so I’m not sure why these people save their DS just to use it to try and BM right in the last minute. They got away from the hook and into the gates because I don’t camp, even in end game. I play fair and I don’t BM and I don’t get butthurt about flashlights or whatever, but people going out of their way to annoy you in every way possible gets old after awhile. These people create the kind of asshole killers they complain about.
---
Yet again, he is weakest by many different opinions. But as always, there is a second opinion. And I personally don't consider Freddy's power weak and Freddy the weakest killer overall (and I'm not alone in this), though I definitely think he is not really spectacular.
---
Seeing as your account is fairly new it's understandable you wouldn't know but yes, /s means sarcasm.
---
Accurate
---
I legit just main huntress now cuz of MOM
---
I love billy because fuck your MOM
---
Gave me an error when posting
---
that's kind of genuinely creepy
---
Sloppy is universal and great on Legion. His faster speed means he’s a threat injured, therefore you must heal, and they heal a lot vs a Legion, so drag it out with Sloppy.
---
I run Ruin, Monitor, Nurses, and Thanataphobia.
---
Sometimes I sub out Ruin for Huntress Lullaby considering how easy it is to get hooks with Legion.
---
I also sub Thanataphobia with BBQ, and I've been fooling around with STBFL instead of Nurses.
---
All of these have yielded decent results but of course it's rank reset so I'm on the climb back to red.
---
We need more Asian Killers! They are either completely fucked up or extremely scary (or both)
---
What? This is definitely a serious suggestion
---
You do not bleed out in two minutes. You bleed out in four. I have definitely slugged Survivors for longer than two minutes either because I was chasing another or I couldn’t find them again.
---
That means the killer found it first. So the survivor got another second chance with gates.
---
So what if the survivor finds it first? Why is he allowed to leave without giving the killer a 2nd chance like the other way around? The hatch should just power the gates then as well instead of giving a free escape, right?
---
Self care and borrowed time aren’t toxic
---
Nobody would play certain characters and certain characters would be meta.    
---
Nurse with Thantaphobia, Nurses (whatever else)     
---
Billy with Tinkerer, Enduring + Spirit Fury   
---
Meg with any of her perks, Claudette would be predictable.    
---
Nobody would play Wraith, Ace, Tapp, Quentin, even to a certain extent Legion or Freddy if this was added. This isn’t his you increase diversity
---
corn is OP since engine update, it is really difficult to hunt them down with nurse
---
Honestly just don’t drop pallets, ez fix
---
I don't think anybody here got that the song is Bring Me To Life of Evanescence
---
God, I love haddonfield. I dont care if I get looped or wrecked or camped, I just love haddonfield.
---
I don’t agree with the animal thing cuz there are crows
---
Collapse is an excellent improvement for this.
---
Would not suprise me if Freddy actually did this in a movie
---
During the beta or whatever there was no skull-crack. I actually would have preferred squeaky clown shoe noises [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6f-Np4nXrU). Survivors die out of embarrassment.
---
Do her hatchets not build MoM stacks?
---
But he was human at one point. I think they have to have been human at some point in their career.
---
Nope, but I still get it sometimes cuz I’ll probably go for swings if I’m close and they’re injured
---
Id imagine it'd have a similar stance as the Hag.
---
I think the previous version even if you didnt had to be toxic It was really easy you only need to Walker backwards if the survivor was doing a good job
---
Someone needs to make a music video of this.
---
No, [this is the hatch](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/lost/images/c/c0/The_Hatch.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060129165255)
---
Not quite mate, if you look at the cloak compared to the films they're quite different but to be fair it's as close as we're gonna get. Also if you look at the hood its different from the films
---
I'll give you Freddy and maybe Wraith, but I disagree on Doctor and Trapper. 
---
Doc has superb tracking and can keep pressure on generators while slowing the game down a lot. Trapper's redeeming quality to me is that he can waste MoM or deny it entirely for people who step in your traps. Nothing feels better than smacking someone stuck in a trap and seeing that MoM be wasted.
---
That’s the streamers for ya
---
Yes, I'm kurizeria. crxsszeria was my former username for many platforms, but I've changed to kurizeria on most places but reddit \^\^ ^(I don't actually know how to change names on reddit lmao.)
---
Dude you shouldn’t be using mouse and keyboard on console
---
The hood I know but I thought the cloak itself was still pretty similar? I started watching the movies and it honestly didn’t look *that* different to me but idk
---
When I find the last survivor after the hatch is closed, I just let them farm some points by throwing pallets on my head or letting them open both doors for points... if the match went poorly for them I usually let them escape afterwards. Leagues better than what the hatch standoffs were.
---
Yea same
---
Ideas for perks
---
Cause it is not fair either way (too close and too far). RNG is RNG and you won't get a better system tho
---
Where's the second one?
---
Haven’t they said they’ll never do an alien killer?
---
Whatever dude. You done?
---
*nuzzles*
---
Trained athlete, huge muscular fighter, war veteran... and Kate has very nice hair.
---
I’d fucking love to have him as a killer
---
The best feeling in the world
---
Omfg. This has basically a new unique role. To play as the entity and choose where stuff spawns. Thats just fucking awesome
---
In the middle of the picture. Hard to see though.
---
Only none humanoid creatures. Specifically like spiders and shit like that.
---
The game won’t get better by restricting options
---
Survivors who are altruistic still suffers fot noed, but ok, ik im the minory:(
---
With mori I don’t think noed will even activate unless the billy is complete asss
---
Ohhhhh ok! just making sure someone wasn't stealing art XDD
---
Not really. Stridor is stronger than Iron Will, you will make noises when the Killer is running it even if you have tier 3 of IW. Yes it is a little quiter but still stronger. I don't rrally understand why because IW will srop it to 100% so your noises are basically 0. 50% more of 0 is still 0...
---
Wait but this account you’re using is 2 years old why would you post twice on two different accounts
---
Oof. In the middle of the picture. Hard to see though.
---
Wow your going to saw con?
---
Killers normaly get kills by noed, that what i hate about noed, you can be shit and put very minus map pressure, and still can get 1 or 2 kills
---
Man i would love to play as Ripley she's a badass
---
They're making him a jump scare Meyers, his ability basically screams it at me (you see what I did there?).
---
I'm excited to see his other perks an to creep around corners on unsuspecting survivors.
---
I'm also excited to see if/who they release with him. I don't expect it to be anyone from a Scream movie due to ownership differences, but I'm still ready for whoever it is.
---
Borrowed time has a counter, don’t tunnel
---
Flashlights were nerfed into the ground a while ago lol
---
I think he means the exposed effect
---
It works now?
---
I certainly can! Feel free to send me a message whenever you're available &amp; we can go over it :3
---
You also haven’t used this account in a year
---
Nah. Just ridiculous how there are xx complaining posts about the same but no one trys to see both sides to make it fair.

Adrenaline has a counter, don’t let the gens get done

I'm trying not to chase any ideas about his power how OP he might be ETC.
---
The leak we all saw was clearly a very early version of the developer build, i doubt they have fully fleshed out his power just yet, I'm going to hold back and wait for an official PTB.
---
Welcome to the Club of Zap Zaps, where screaming is mandatory and we make bad doctor jokes.
---
Predator and Alien just don't fit in the game at all imo
---
Wow I'm right here and you're gonna say that. Hmm
---
They’ll eventually make a remake and I’ll cry because it’ll be awful
---
Borrowed time only works on the person who was unhooked though
---
Not sure how close you're looking?
---
[Here he is ingame.](https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/dead-by-daylight-scream-ghostface-killer-leak.jpg.optimal.jpg)
---
[And here's the Cloak from the movies.](https://img.wondercostumes.com/products/11-3/mens-ghostface-zombie-costume.jpg)
---
I thought it was universal, just confused me as I’m level 50 on legion and never saw it. I’m levelling so many things at once it’s difficult to do anything
---
The reason why they look different is because the film cloak is an all in one jet black cloak. Where as the DBD version looks like it's in bits and pieces with drapes coming off it. The colour is more grey compared to the jet black. The games cloak only comes down to the knees and parts where in the film it comes all the way down to his boots. The games cloak also has what looks like discoloured shoulder pad over the chest area and shoulders.
---
It’s a free character
---
Who needs to power through ruin when it disappears in 5 seconds :(
---
I respect that, keep up the good work.

Evanescence is a very popular band and BMTL is not only one of their most popular songs but used in memes constantly. Everyone knows this song.
---
Susie has like 16 years i think, so, yep... bill can destroy her so easy
---
I’m not saying they are the same but even than I do like the ingame one better personally and that’s because I only watched the first one and started the second one, I mistook the sleeves for the cloth in the back for DBD
---
Well that’s not really eating, it just won’t be used
---
it's the only perk i always keep
---
HEY NOW, YOU’RE A ROCK STAR!
---
What are the 4 high rank killers? Nurse, Billy, Myers, Spirit?
---
To make it fair? Let's see. Killer finds hatch and closed it when there's still gens left to do. Doors both are literally next to each other. Killer literally needs to put no effort into tracking because there's only one area the survivor can go. No chance for survivor in that scenario. 
---
Or, and get this.. Doors have set spawn points. Killer has to make a guess, a best decision based on where they last saw the survivor, where the last gen popped, something. Choose a door. If survivor isn't there, they still have time to get to the other one since you gotta hold the lever to open it. On a small map, which, as I said was my biggest issue, that's no problem and at least the killer will get one last hit. They still have a fairly decent chance of getting that last kill as well depending on If the survivor just went for opening the door or waiting for the killer to check it. 
---
Thats literally about as balanced as it can get. The doors spawning next to each other? Not. You can be done here dude, you have no solution so idk why you're here aside from trying to complain about a post you could have simply ignored.
---
No it’s fine that other account was deleted I did research to find out and I believe you
---
No problem! I totally get that reposts for karma happen a lot, so it's understandable to be cautious :3
---
I’ve legit struggled off killers so many times, mostly because they’re inside a building and get stuck on shit or don’t see the closest hook, I wouldn’t say it’s pointless, just rare for it to actually get you off, which it should be, survivors shouldn’t just get a free escape
---
jeff is the best survivor soo
---
Haha lol. Yeah it'll be really interesting to play against. The whole reason I play the game and its been the Same reason since I first ever played, is the fear factor and hopefully ghostface can bring that. Theres only been Myers who's really brought that and I'd love to see it from my favourite killer of all time. I'd love to see sidney Prescott but who knows.
---
i’ve had this happen once, so satisfying
---
Yeah, someone tested that build and it worked.
---
Absolutely beautiful man! Keep it up! Do you have artworks of other killers too!?!?
---
Is the undead the guy from hatchet? 
---
Can you list all of them? I only recognize the Creeper (Jeepers Creepers) and Hell Priest (Pinhead)
---
So how is OoO high tier?
---
Yeah good point. I can imagine hes still in a very early state. Brings a lot of excitement knowing hes coming and he has so much potential to be possibly a fun killer to play against.
---
That's my favorite Legion skin.
---
I wouldn't be surprised. The time between originals and remakes is getting smaller :(
---
I dream to be stabbed by susie
---
Ohh okay! All good then. Have a good day! :D
---
Every other week we see this meme and every time we have to explain the lore of the game. The Entity gives the killers superpowers on top of their abilities, this is why a 17 year old quicc girl can lift each and every one of those fully grown adults like backpacks, carry them around like flopping fishes for 12-45 seconds, and literally yeet them onto Meat hooks high enough to suspend them, and most impressively yoink them from working on a generator with no fight back one handed.
---
*same*, man, same
---
Ok you too
---
Valak from the movie “The Nun”
---
To be fair though he’s a reluctant hero at best, and has always needed convincing to actually fight. Bruce has called him a coward multiple times.
---
It's always for that second chance if he fails
---
Can I get a link I need to watch this I think I know what made this demon and please
---
My favorite part is how they pretend like there is no counter play.
---
Glenn would be awesome
---
r/thatsthejoke
---
Except he's in the Entity's realm now. The Entity has power over literally everything, it doesn't matter how strong you were.

---
No his power is saying like comment and subscribe until the survivor cry until they die from dehydration which takes one second
---
Yes i am a beta tester for Minecraft you want to be one
---
You took a calculated risk but it turns out you were not good at math.
---
Ofcourse    https://youtu.be/EvYr3w5F7UU
---
It's beautiful, well done! There's something very satisfying about the pixel art style.
---
Dead by daylight is trying to prove that big dick gets you killed. they are envious cause they have small dick... 😂😂😂😂
---
Thank you
---
Literally, the only bad perk here is Adrenaline. If you have issues with DS, then stop tunneling
---
Oh, i love that part!
---
Oh god you didn’t tell me it was by jelly
---
borrowed time. borrowed time. BORROWED TIME
---
Im just saying dont hate on people running meta perks if you also run meta perks
---
Gens are tokens :) They are not on the pic
---
It's literally not the point.
---
Your what?
---
Coaltower and rancid abattoir :)
---
Sure :)
---
WAZZZAAAAP!!!
---
Money.
---
I have the only Version nur I will make Another for the Devs soon.
---
Personally I just face camp every Ash on their 2nd hook.
---
This is probably the worst comparison I've heard on this website ever. Shouldn't be surprised, easy to forget the DBD community is 99% teenagers.
---
Cursed\_Left For Dead
---
You can't blame anyone for chasing this hunk tbh
---
Lore-Not much for lore myself. I personally do not like the lore of this one, but that doesn't mean it can't be in DBD.
---
Character John-Who is this John fellow anyhow? You mention Payday 2 and the only John I can think of is John Wick, which would be odd imo. Payday 2 cosmetics also seem odd for DBD. 
---
Mental Breakdown-A gun power again seems unfitting for DBD, but in terms of gameplay seems potentially alright. Does he slowdown upon activation? is there a warning sound upon activation? Cause if no sound then its unfair to get sniped with the aura. I see the power working in DBD, just needs the proper indicators and balancing. Also why should this character have idle animations when compared to the rest of DBD characters?
---
 
---
 Eager to kill and fast- has too many varying effects and should instead focus on one or two things at most increasing via tokens. Not saying your perk can't happen, but it seems to be too varied for its own good. Also the chance to not get stunned seems to be not a great effect since killers if playing right rarely gets flashlighted or pallet stunned. Also note do not use a successful attack recovery as part of your perk. If combined with Save The Best For Last we will get machine gun combo to return and that would be unbalanced. The mori may be too easy to achieve. Final thing to note about that perk, why 2% and 1.5% difference among killers? It wouldn't be overly strong if just 2% consistently imo.
---
Eenie Meenie Miney Mo- Why is the duration getting smaller upon higher tiers? You don't wnat a perk that can arguably be better on lower tiers. Instead something like a flat 80 seconds with 10%/20%/35% for your tiers would be more consistent and with DBD perk style. Also this perk has a tunneling requirement which are generally frowned upon by users of said perks.
---
Breathe,Blink,Cry- Shoulld be automatic instead of activation upon double use of ability, otherwise interesting perk, however I doubt Behavior would ever make this as the End Game Collapse is supposed to stop griefing and match hostage over actualyl being deadly. I would like this perk in the game cause that would be fun.
---
I tried to give you feedback as a player with +1000 hours with thoughts on balancing and the potential of it to fit in with DBD.
---
I de-ranked from Rank 2 to 6 because I'm having a blast with omega terror radius Myers.
---
Distressing + Insidious + Agitation + Ruin
---
Fragrant Tuft of Hair + Dead Rabbit
---
Purple Mist offering
---
With EW3 you have a 51% increased terror radius which is a little over 48m. For reference, that's twice the distance of Devour Hope. Everyone is constantly within heartbeat range of EW3 Mikey. Use Insidious to lull them into a false sense of security (especially since they are used to your omega terror radius).
---
I've had a lot of fun &amp; compliments in post game chat. Absolutely terrible build, but everyone including myself has a blast.
---
I don't know Hero clix sry :D
---
Yeah true. There would probably really be some OP perk builds for survivor and killer. But I also had an idea  that you would go up against people with the same presteige level as you that way if everyone in the May h is P1, P2, or P3 everyone would have the same amount of perk slots. And oh god I really can’t care about it being a Claudette but as a killer main to me that sounds horrifying
---
Thank you for the feedback 😊
---
You must be fun at parties
---
I'm sure it's because Survivors are generally the ones that like to abuse glitches, and making it so that survivors can have fewer gens to start with really screws over that killer's game. 
---
Having an extra killer in there doesn't really screw over the Killer's game. Killer queues are longer, and thus it sucks a bit more when they're ruined.
---
So you want a guarenteed escape for the last survivor after failing multiple times. Got it.
---
That's just one scenario with bad RNG for survivor. If doors never close it's just a free escape if you dont face billy/nurse. Would not be balanced at all. This way door can be close ot not. Flip a coin. It's fair.
---
The Brutal Strength (I think) perk says the Entity gives killers supernatural strength.
---
The requirements mean without healing they would be on death hook if it activates. Once it's used that's it. Aura reveal disadvantage and it doesn't get around NOED which rewards killers for 'failing' and the door getting opened
---
You might think that, but I’m trying to say a fact. His power is the weakest of all and he is easily loop able.
---
It's not a free escape lmao. Go find something more productive to do, you're being pretty useless here
---
It's "couldn't care less".
---
Took me a minute to get that but I LOL'd quite loudly Haha! 
---
Yeah I'm super stoked, wanted him in for so long and now hes finally here!
---
Man it would be cool playing as Jason, predator, or a xenomorph. But I wonder what their abilities would be
---
I could not care less and i'm playing like 50/50. 
---
But IMO it can't get more fair as it is now with RNG. One time you got an easy escape when doors are not close to each other and the other time you will die. You got enough chances to survive without the door RNG so if you get fucked by RNG just move on to the next game and you get good RNG in that game.
---
Good for you. If you could not care get off my thread 😌
---
The Blair witch 😂😂😔
---
Oof I feel sorry for that Dwight
---
I mean the tbagging, obviously.
---
Imagine if they'd done a full Left 4 Dead chapter.
---
couldn’t sleep tonight so set up the server where it’s at least ready for use. changes will be made and channels will be added but for now it’s fine. anyway for anyone who would like the link here ya go https://discord.gg/gevZq5d
---
Let me buy default dance for my killers.
---
Her auto aim was even stronger before, all you needed to do before they change it was get close to a survivor a left click and it would do the work for you.
---
That would be to easy of an escape.
---
Nobody said lie, just shut up if you don’t like it
---
Those DC penalties can't come soon enough
---
No shock, big cock doc &gt; zappy hands
---
*HOLY SHIT HE'S A LIZARD!*
---
Dead Fall
---
Im playing huntress He throws a pallet while injured and I hit him with a hatchet.
---
i checked his trophies, he has like 2 or something and he was rank 20 so a new player, still a legend
---
damn. what a dumb dumb
---
I can assure you, I've received at least two adept killer awards without getting a double pip.
---
Hell, my adept nurse was the result of three DC's and a suicide, ended with a Entity Displeased, a depip, and a trophy.
---
Since when do they actively nerf survivors?
---
don’t worry, never forget that this is reddit :)
---
The people who run mettle of men usually have long chases which I need to abandon to pressure gens. I am being punished for attacking multiple targets.
---
I play both regularly.
---
This sounds, Fucking amazing. Will try
---
Report, move on, and calm tf down.
---
*FOOKING ELL*
---
Yet someone still downvoted :( guess fun is not allowed and I'm supposed to run Ruin + Enduring + Spirit Fury + Bamboozle
---
aw, whoops
---
Billy is absolutely amazing, especially on console. I'll give you Trapper though
---
Yeah as of like 2 days ago, i think its a bug. My friends like to DC to lose pips (i know) and they no longer lose them. So they tried to die immediately multiple games and they said they both could never lose pips, only safety pip
---
Except that Rancor kills you right away, so it makes its representation invalid.
---
That's if it's active, otherwise chainsaws are 100% good to go
---
I would think that a sick person would move reasonably faster than a dehydrated corpse wrapped in dry linen.
---
I've seen BT go 1st then MoM. But when BT is active with bleed out timer I don't believe MoM will work.
---
Their "reward" for escaping is getting to the campfire, where they're safe until they fall asleep, after which they wake up in another trial, or try to escape, where they find themselves lost in another trial afterwards. It's how teachables work lorewise - They teach the others at the campfire.
---
If they die, they immediately wake up in another trial and get no real rest.
---
I don't know how leaving with an active Pig trap would work, though. I assume they'd still die after it sets off and get no rest.
---
What perk pack is that?
---
End game collapse, buff to ruin and BBQ, nerf to healing speed, nerf to DS. Piggy main here and Killer is easier than ever.
---
this made me happy to see thank you
---
yea but its just 2%, not that good imo
---
welp, i hope that fix hitboxes
---
What game did Riot have before they made league?
---
That's the thing. We already have Wraith, so idk what Predator would do and with Alien we already have Piggy and Ghostface. Even tho I gotta admit that I was saying that Saw won't fit as well, but it ended up well.
---
I will always go to f13 for slasher movies, but Jason is over represented as fuck. He even got two games of his own.
---
I would love to see under represented killers like the creeper, maniac cop, hell I want to see the red/green devil from scream queens.
---
PressF
---
Works both ways. I don’t care about brining MoM or DS because I know it will always be used because of camping and tunelling.
---
Every update since Legion was released
---
I don't think it' fair to group rank 20's with the rest of us...
---
If they Behaviour is lucky enough to get the license they'll make it work.
---
The visuals for most killer weapons dont match their  swing radius, Freddy being one of the best examples. But in general hitboxes make things even worse, along with the ping in most cases. Hatchets seem to hit even when they dont because of all the issues listed above. Hope they add capsule hitboxes eventually.
---
because it takes the entire patch to do it, and they can't "just patch the game" because of consoles
---
Frame rate was vastly improved in the last patch.
---
What isn't
---
Can you mash up The Legion with the main character from Party Hard? I feel like they would be good additions to the game not gonna lie, they even have similar masks.
---
You cut the video in the right time! xD (Cut in both ways :p)
---
PS: 3 people?! I thought the game cancelled matches with less than 4 people! :o
---
Killers don't know that they can't injure you if you injure yourself first. And that's just smart.
---
Personally waiting for a perk that lets me jump on a hook and kobe.
---
I'd be a Ripley main for sure! Alien is one of my three favourite horror films.
---
Somebody needs to tell this bitch to try hugs instead of throwing a hatchet in your face. I would give her love, but everytime I try she's like **HA!**
---
BBQ got nerfed. lvls 1 and 2 used to give up to 60 and 80% of bloodpoints and now they give 50 and 75
---
no one cares about the aura reading anyway
---
Bruh I hear you, I was playing a match the weekend before last against the Doctor. I kept my distance, cleansed most the totems, got four genies done, and finally unhooked two fucking survivors before opening a door and escaping. 
---
Team called me a coward. I ran my ass off fixing shit while they ran the killer around. I help them out, they still got salty since one guy died.
---
WTF! I can't see the middle one.
---
I love it because it reveals the aura of the person who came in hooked you which means they're probably going to be your favorite other player in the game and now you get to see each other auras
---
M&amp;A is amazing on Legion. Reduced TR lets him get close and frenzy easily, and then you get the extra 8 meters of tracking while in a chase in frenzy.
---
I said this with the last post. All I can picture with that is a L4D Charger whiffing. 
---
"GRAAA... RUUUUUUUUUUU--"
---
BOOM!
---
This usually comes after the survivor rages about how unfair the end game collapse is.
---
Hitting the ground Dead Hard.
---
I love the map visually,  it looks great but using perks like discordance or surveillance can barely be seen cause white or yellow with snow is rough.
---
Wouldn't for me, but hey opinions are opinions
---
1:if bhvr gets alien then it’s likely 2: Jason already has his own game sadly 3: If bhvr talked to other game companies maybe 3: the killer looks too much like a survivor so they wouldn’t put him in 4: if bhvr manages to get predator then it’s likely
---
The game is doing you a favor tbh
---
Fr though I've seen updates for games literally only patch one thing. It's very doable to release a patch that fixes this. I'm not a programmer but I imagine it wouldn't be that hard
---
r/whoosh
---
I could buy the bottom one but none others.
---
it's based on a TV series called gravity falls, if you like that style, check it out.
---
I'm getting some Ugandan Knuckles vibes from this, and I'm as displeased to as the Entity after a 1K.
---
I'm surprised Jason isn't in here after Michael was implemented. Back then I thought for sure he'd make it in any patch now...
---
The Spirit one is god damn awesome. I rarely check up these fanmade things but this one struck a nerve.
---
god sometimes, don't get me wrong i like him \*under breath\* \*in the movies\* but sometimes i can't deal with him thank you for the useful intel on how to counter tombstone myers
---
Most of these are very possible but unfortunately Jason will never happen. Trapper exists for that very reason. Jason is currently locked in copyright Hell because the guy who wrote the script is expecting the rights when he sold the damn story willingly. That’s why Friday the 13th isn’t being updated regularly.
---
Also I don’t care at all what anyone says, Alien would be awesome. And if anyone says “iTs NoT iN tHe LoRe” just remember it’s a LICENSED killer. It doesn’t have to fit the lore. At least in my eyes. You wouldn’t care as long as it was a good killer and you know it.
---
Your argument against Negan is kinda killed by Legion being a thing.
---
Actually that is a sick idea
---
He's stronger if you're good at the game. Overall they're deadlier, but you now dont just get free downs by looking down or by frenzying the survivor 4 times.
---
I love Wraith's too. Us killers are in for some good ones.
---
Tunneling is when the killer goes for the survivor who was just unhooked and the regents affect how much fog is on the map.
---
Nurse's Bizarre Adventure.
---
Any hate comments will be downvoted and ignored, any comments telling me how to play the game that I BOUGHT will be downvoted and ignored, any players bragging about how "Good" they are will be downvoted and ignored, any comments telling me I'm "Tunneling" whatever that means will be downvoted and ignored. 
---
And... This comment will be Downvoted and ignored, yeah I hate you too.
---
Good. I'm glad :)
---
I've currently unavailable to buy aftercare off the shrine. 
---
I have the shards to buy it just every time I try to it say "purchase failed, the item could not be purchased. Please try again later" and it has been like this for hours
---
Is anyone else having this problem?
---
This is a bit late, but the new shrine looks pretty good rn
---
Here we see an Immersed Claudette in its native environment. Let's hit it with a stick and see if it can run.
---
I wish we had a Cthulhu mythos killer. Some kinda shambling mound with tentacles. I dunno what the power would be though
---
Seems like killer mains cried so hard about ds devs were like ok will nerf it but wait til you see what we got up our sleeves...  that was when mettle of man was born!  Its an amazing perk. 
---
Hey killer mains you cant have it all... yall got some bomb ass perks but choose to run the same 3 over and over.. ruin, bbq, and nurses rinse and repeat.
---
They could hotfix it on steam, but they cant push hotfixes on console, so us PC-players have to suffer because otherwise asswipes who don't understand that not all platforms are equal will fucking blow this sub up.
---
While I'm inclined to agree... suddenly seeing the triple laser dot marker appear on my survivors head and the triangle outline slowly closing around me while working a gen would be amazing. The Predator has already been in a few different asymmetrical games.
---
Similarly walking along and hearing the *pit pit spsssssss* of acid dripping and sizzling on the ground around me from the xenomorph above me.
---
With bond you permanently see survivors nearby, wich allows you to find injured survivors, survivors to heal you, totem locations, generators, chesgs and many times if they are being chased or not, do you knownif youcan just commitnto the repair even tho you are hearing the TR
---
With Enpathy you just know if someone is injured, who is most likely just going to be running away from the killer, self caring or looking desperately for someone
---
If you want a perk with a big ass radius, just use aftercare, otherwise, bond &gt; empathy
---
 What do you even count as trolling because I never had that issue. The hatch system is fine how it is currently just give some tweaks to doors.
---
You shouldn't always escape
---
That looks like a nuclear bunker entrance. Am I right?
---
On a side note, I assume noed or devour soap wouldn't work with frenzy.
---
*glances at my lean plank called Quentin*
---
Not all Bois are thicc, but they are all good boys
---
Oh yeah, I completely forgot about the increased 8 m on a chase
---
Noice
---
&gt; Resist the temptation to tunnel and camp.
---
Its a good strategy to camp a survivor to secure an additional kill after the gates are opened, especially if they are in the basement.
---
Negan a big boi with a big bat wrapped with barbed wire, and there's no rule saying that killers can look like a human.
---
Thank you for source, hero.
---
So I dont get to use a perk because someone else is running the same perk I am?? Tf?  How would you like to bring bbq and not be able to use it?
---
I don’t see pennywise
---
NOED and Bloodwarden
---
welp, diferent opinions, i think perks that rewards players for loosing shouldnt exist, but its okay.
---
“The black guy from Predator 2”
---
You mean … Detective Tapp?
---
I really like wake up as a perk, so I'm hyped to see it in the shrine. It really helps with those "oh shit they're coming right for me" moments!
---
Ive been having issues buying aftercare, so I think the shrine is bugged. Give it some time and try again?
---
Wraith is such a happy camper &lt;3
---
Legion qualifies as cancer so the knife must be cancer as well
---
Ok yeah when you say that I get it (never watched twd)
---
Yeah, basically
---
*doctor laugh*
---
I mean I just want to buy aftercare to get my 250k BP but sadly I can't :( game doesn't want me building on bubba
---
Yes you are
---
I LOVE PIGGY! 💖🐷💖🐷💖 oink! I love the use of red!
---
Yes! My heart goes crazy while i'm opening the gate now XD  
---
There's still 7 days left, so I guess it can normalize before it ends
---
The killers look like the survivor's stands they way they stand behind them like that
---
i didnt know this was instagram...
---
No, i'm saying most people don't loop, and it's probably more then 70%, based on the kill stats released awhile back
---
But you're not thinking in different ways, noed is a common perk to be be salty about.
---
Now if you were salty about monstrous shrine, then that would be thinking different.
---
Ghost tongue is scary
---
Well this is where I took the picture
---
Tbh I just run it because im partially colorblind, and wake up/deja Vu are good for finding gens/doors in the distance. But, I suppose there's a reason I'm a Quentin main.
---
It has saved my ass several times though, and I know several survivors that appreciate the aura when it's Max level. Particularly when they're being chased
---
I hope so, we really got a good shrine this week!
---
Yes, they traded off the ability to pull people out of the hatch escape when they gave the killer the ability to close the hatch (they’ve implemented it in the endgame collapse update not too long ago)
---
So if I bring four Up the Antes and 4 Jars of Vigo or what it's called, how will that affect the numbers for getting off of hooks and out of beartraps?  I can't imagine it'll be 100%, but I don't have the numbers.
---
what way i should think?
---
This is beyond science!
---
He could trap windows and pallets to injure survivors.
---
Well fuck you too
---
I got it whenever it was free on psn. It's pretty much been the only game I've played since then
---
No, i meant balance it like ds. Like when you are not the obsession you have to wait x time to activate or shit. Just something so 4 MoM arent so powerful
---
I think if a trap was placed well, it could be a good counter to things like balanced landing
---

I'm afraid to pick short killers
---
Freddy is an entity (demon) that feeds off fear, he references this in the beginning of Freddy Vs Jason where he says "I can't do anything if they're not afraid of me! Being burned is one thing, but being FORGOTTEN? Now THAT'S a bitch!" He them uses Jason to murder kids and Freddy leaves messages saying that Freddy is doing it so Laurie (not Strode) and Quinton will be triggered by their PTSD and Jumpstart their belief in Freddy again.

*Survivors BM post game*
---
No tears, it's a waste of good suffering
---
I occasionally forget that I can close it honestly, and I keep forgetting that you can’t grab survivors anymore lol
---
First of all, why would you even use Infinite Tombstone builds for ranking up?
---
&gt; it doesn’t make a whole lot of sense 
---
Honestly to me it makes a lot of sense. When you are in T3 of Infinite Tombstone, everybody goes full immersive. Insidious seems to me a perfect choice. I'd even went so far and say that instadown (or instakill in case of Myers) builds are the only good fit for Insidious

*Dead Cells flash backs*

While it’s definitely much better than it was before the changes, legions ability is still basically an easy hit. It’s better to heal now than before, because a smart legion will hit you if you’re already injured because they’re 115% now. Not healing vs plague is annoying because you’re broken the whole game, but she can do a lot more damage to the whole team with the corrupt purge if you give it to her. I feel like it depends on the skill of the killer.
---
I can 360! Wait....no.
---
Hi guys. I'm sorry I overreacted. Please forgive me. Karma is just imaginary internet points. This is just a video game after all. I don't want to get anymore internet hate so I realize I'm in the wrong here. No one else did anything wrong and this is all my fault. I shouldn't have posted this screenshot because it is probably spam. I hope I didn't make anyone mad. I got really mad but it isn't your fault. I just need to accept criticism. Please don't down vote this anymore I'm sorry. I did tunnel the first survivor so I told the truth. I had a 2% proximity to hooked survivor at the end so I camped a little bit. I also didn't use any perks, add-ons or offerings and that made me happy because it was the first time I've even done that.
---
Read the caption
---
My only concern would be balance. The aliens are these stealthy killers, but also fast and agile. Doesn't really fit with how Killers in DBD work. Same with Predator
---
The post isn’t saying those perks are toxic it’s saying they’re meta. Saying “gg ez bb killer” is the toxic part
---
I had No Mither on and was getting slugged by a Michael in Endgame Collapse. I brought myself back up and sprinted to the door. Collapse got me right as I stepped foot in the door. My peen has never felt the same
---
It's clearly something they messed up with the latest patch, so they just have to find the mistake, and remove it, that's it. If other cross platform games like overwatch can do it, what hinders BEhavior unable to do so
---
Doesn't Alien have a Hivemind effect to them? There is a queen and all the entity would need to do would be imitate a queen. I'm not exactly sure how they work though.
---
Why is that tekken character in there?
---
Alien’s ability could be that he has multiple vents across the map he can use to get around faster. It’s really no different than a Nurse Warp with a locked enter and exit. And Predator could just get a Wraith reskin, like Ghostface got a Myers reskin.
---
😂😂😂 it’s bad I get it lol
---
Just had that happen, was using no Mither though so piff is what I say to NoED
---
Yeah, looking back at it, apple of temptation is way to busy (and its name is meh), lol. Hmmm... I'd probably reduce all the values in it by a bit, the Reduce exposed specifically to 5-10 seconds, and the aura probably removed entirely. (Since her third perk already does aura)
---
As for movement speed, I really wanted her to be a slow killer, since we havent seen one the Survivors can easily outrun. That's why I gave Stigma lvl 3 the slow debuff- so she has a chance to catch up. We could probably increase the debuff to -25% move speed, to simulate the 115 move speed on a weakened survivor.
---
Why the fuck so people genuinely think this, like legit just suck it up and you don’t loose 3 pips and all the bps
---
Yeah, I have no clue WHY they continue to do this
---
There totally should be an end match or something as an alternative to just leaving the game. Sometimes I just have to leave a game but I’m forced to DC
---
Or we could get that cocksucking 6 armed goon that BACK FORWARD X’S ME INTO OBLIVION EVERY FUCKING TIME
---
Woooooo DBD on Warsaw Comic Con! On what days will you be there? Are you alone or with a group of other DBD cosplayers perhaps? :P

holy shit i wish i could upvote this more than once (and do so in a way that wouldnt get me banned Forever)
---
10 outta 10 OP, good job

Not quite, apostrophe should be 1 more to the left, but props for trying lol

Id you don't want to ruin your controller, can't you just press the button more softly?

WAKE UP IS IN EVERY FUCKING SHRINE!!!!!!!
---
I'd love Ripley.   
---
Many may not agree, but I'd also like Clear Rivers from Final Destination. Since the baddie in that movie is pretty much the entity anyway, lol.
---
Due to everyone still hating me I am going to delete this post, I am the most hated user on the sub-reddit and I'll probably get banned for spam. I wish people would compliment me but nothing is perfect.
---
Yeah he is quite a very deadly guy to be against, everytime I see a Myers, it's the panic for me haha
---
Honestly i think it should just be a button hold instead of mash. It's pretty annoying.
---
Ash's DLC was called a chapter too homie.
---
Whelp, I guess it's a moot point until I have enough points saved up to buy Ace or get the DLC for him and the hag, I guess, but that's interesting to run as part of a shit build with a SWF.  Thanks for the numbers!
---
The thing I've been seeing most often is downing the last 2, hooking 1 and then keeping the last near the hatch. Once the hatch opens, they drop you near it, close it, and just wait to watch you die. This endgame seemed really cool, but has clearly just become the same fuckfest the original hatch standoff was. Except, back then, I could actually get the fuck out. To every killer that does this: Would you kindly go fuck yourself? I'm sorry your parents don't love you, but now the rest of the world thinks you're an asshole too.
---
My concern is how would he work on most maps. The main draw of his power seems to be hiding just out of sight and leaning around corners and such. How effective will this be in wide open maps or in areas that aren't exactly in loops. Basically the same problem jumpscare Myers has, only this seems to be his basekit instead of a niche build on him.
---
He could be fun though, especially with TR reducing perks. M&amp;A seems like it would be essential on him, we gotta see the final build on him for me to be sure, but looking at the 1 perk we know of his, they may all revolve around reducing TR in some way.
---
I'm more curious as to how the survivors perks will work. We are assuming Sydney, but it can easily be like 2-3 other people from the movies. They all had widely different roles as well so the perks could differ greatly depending on if they want to make them fit the character.
---
[They called Ash a "Chapter" too.](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1113112638047780864)
---
No, i tried to compare a stun to the standard animation after a hit + the speed burst after a survivor gets hit.
---
Making a game isnt like telling your computer to do something, and then expect it to work flawlessly. Making a game takes work, so unless you're a game developer, you can be quiet(and this comes from experience, too).
---
As far as I remember, Miller never shut the game down. In fact, I remember him saying he WANTED the game to continue.
---
He’s much better, the people who say Legion is dead still haven’t gotten off the bandwagon. 
---
His power is for tracking, easy first hits and time wasting. It’s no longer a power to down, but a tool that provides utility. There’s counterplay to it now. I would describe the new Legion as an alternative Pig.
---
oink ;w;
---
Yeah great point. Theres a lot of ifs and buts with him at the moment, so I guess only time will tell. Exciting times ahead tho!
---
You mean a bush?
---
Yea but they also called it a glimpse of the next chapter ...saying we haven’t seen it all ..also I’d like to point out that we only saw 1 of his perks and his model was not fully finished...sure we could only get a killer but we could also get a survivor and map personally I think we will get a map and survivor...
---
That does not help
---
Well, the core game is not very fun on survivor side to be honest. The chase is the only part that can be exciting. Other than that, you're either sitting still doing skill checks, or hanging on a hook for minutes. It's not great design.
---
This. Getting seen and chased first does not equal tunneling. But when a killer blatantly passes over other chases to focus solely on a single survivor, that is tunneling. And, although it isn't against the rules, you're a scumbag if you play that way.
---
Simply by pursuing it he shut it down, though.
---
I get it, it’s a legal issue, and it’s rightfully his money, and there’s probably a million things going on that I’m not smart enough to understand. But it’s been 35 years, the rights are supposed to be his, and he still hasn’t won them, which has shut down one of the biggest horror franchises ever. 
---
Seems like a good time to just drop it.
---
Slugging for the 4k is residentsleeper gameplay
---
I really wish Predator would fit.. but Predator doesn't attack unarmed people so it wouldn't work. Maybe like an exiled Predator but even then, they are way too overpowered lore wise.
---
Hex: I FUCKING SEE YOU

The Entity took the horse on Father Campbell's Chapel, too

Oof, this cuts deep
---
Dude nice!! Did you 3D print it? It came out great
---
Insidious? MORE LIKE FARMVILLE
---
Hold a button to give up and accept your demise, otherwise no input should be needed its really unnecesary
---
No i mean I **created** a template myself and did thais.
---
I mean, as you said, we only saw one perk. That alone could classify as a "glimpse."
---
Is it possible we'll get a map &amp; survivor? Sure, of course it is, but it's definitely not guaranteed.
---
That and I don't have made with mematic at the corner
---
Same tbh.
---
I don't mind dying for a teammate, I've intentionally gotten myself killed to give a teammate the hatch, but... come on, man, at least lie to me and pretend to do something, haha.
---
It's a sewer
---
If they're toying with you, I get being upset but killers are playing to kill.
---
You've been conditioned by a broken hatch system to feel like being last alive = escape.
---
The system as it stands now rewards groups that keep everyone or most alive to make an effective escape.  1 vs. 1 has a very poor outlook... as it should.
---
We can agree to disagree, I’m tired of arguing tbh.
---
I am not trying to be a disrespectful or anything, but if I had that same health issue I would look for an auto-fire controller
---
Just do a hotkey combo and you dont have to suffer through it anymore
---
"Do you like scary movies?"
---
Wouldn't call asking a simple question "Getting triggered" but you do you bud.
---
I once deadharded and slammed inbetween a box and the killer, the thing that made it hurt more though is that it was directly after i unhooked myself in front of the exit gate. I was given the 4% and still failed
---
I am guessing that after the end game colapse addition the perk went up a bit in the meta.
---
Cool. I always thought this new skin looked more like meg tho
---
Just play the way that you want to play. The majority of people on here are really nice. And the one’s that get salty usually aren’t that great at the game anyway. ;)
---
A shocking revelation.
---
I hope we get David and Jake soon.
---
Ok, Thanks,
---
Yes officer, this post right here
---
I'd let Frank stab me ngl dont @ me
---
At the end of the day, you play games to have fun, you paid for this game, as long as you yourself are enjoying it, don’t worry what others think
---
Me too. Those were my favorites from this round of skins.
---
And if all that fails, hook yourself again and get the sacrifice points instead of the killer. Can't sacrifice us if we do it to ourselves! OUT-FUCKING-PLAYED.
---
Following update adds the option to teabag while on a hook.
---
true, thats a good point. but yeah, i agree that it shouldnt really be punished, especially when there are so many other things to be looked at over mutual farming xD
---
when i'm in that situation i just leave, even though [ i guess to them ] that kinda makes me an ass for not giving the rest of em whatever bloodpoints im worth and cutting time. i do gens, then peace out, i play to play, not to play tag or whatever else cos it's just not fun for me.
---
Yeah it’s similar to Meg’s 90s outfit from December
---
Perhaps the internet isn't the place for you right now.
---
People don't like that you play Legion...so?? 
---
It's just words on a screen bud.
---
Ok
---
“I wanna see what your insides look like”
---
“Then turn to page 54”
---
“Nice”
---
This is probably my new favorite top for Nea. I don't really care for everything else though :\
---
I never teabag. It's just rude and pointless.
---
Negan’s power is Lean. Negan leans backward at a humanely impossible angle and shoots badly written dialogue at survivors giving them the Exposed status.
---
I didn't say you were triggered. I meant the "it's a meme" part. And I never said they're toxic perks. They're just common to see on toxic killers.
---
This could just be someone in the PR that doesn’t actually play the game, and just wrote this.
---
Why legion? :(
---
... BBQ and chilly was in the blood web ONCE and it was never to be seen again until like a year and a half later.
---
If anything it really tells me its random and random will usually fuck you over.
---
Try not to tunnel or camp. Using NOED, Blood Warden, Remember Me and BBQ as an endgame build is pretty good.
---
But reverse flash is so much better and cooler then anyone 🤔
---
If I make it to end-game, I consider it a win. So you bet your ass I’m on a suicide mission to save the homies
---
Whatever you say man. It's just always weird to hear that there are objective opinions and there are subjective
---
He’s more tolerable now. Not an instant DC. The add-ons you use are important now. Not a Legion main myself but going against iri button or cooldown add-ons is particularly annoying.
---
...
---
I wasn’t aware he won and all that. Shutting up now.
---
IMO it depends largely on rank and your build.
---
I personally really like the coxcomb clapper (the ultra rare one? I may get a couple of the names wrong, apologies if I do!) for stealth, but it’s most effective on maps with low survivor visibility or in connection with thick mist offerings, otherwise higher rank survivors who know what to look for can see you a mile off and there’s really no benefit to silent uncloaking.
---
The all-seeing add-ons are also really useful, especially the ultra rare one, which outlines all the generators in white and they progress into red when they’re being worked on. The less rare ones are also great, especially for those survivors crouching behind hooks waiting to save, or hiding behind a rock when you’ve found their generator.
---
Swift hunt is useful and I always like to have it on because it can mean the difference between catching someone before they escape or losing them.
---
yes... which is the person that died.
---
Whenever someone throws out the ole EZ at me as killer, I kindly remind them how EZ their mom was last night
---
we been knew
---
Macro's are against the TOS. If their filter catches it your account is banned for life, no appeals.
---
I HATE THAT THE GOTL CHARACTERS GET THE FLASHIEST COSMETICS REEEE
---
Any chance someone could link some screenshots of them?
---
I think if a teammates gets to a new hook phase without the killer being near all survivors should be punished. So if I get hooked and the killer is more than 28meters away and I go from phase 1 to 2 all survivors should lose points in altruisme.
---
Predator and Alien while I love them I wouldn't want to see in game. You'd have to nerf Predator like crazy which would make him lame. Because the Survivors are basically unarmed you'd probably only have a Predator using it's gauntlet claws. As far as The Alien isn't really sentient, so I don't see it being useful to The Entity.  
---
Mr. X and Claire I'd be okay with. I mean he already pauses after successfully punching you, and he has a Mori (Skull crush).
---
If they added anyone from TWD I'd want COMIC BOOK Negan and COMIC BOOK Rick. Fuck that show, but the comics are amazing.
---
Jason is a no-brainer, despite The Trapper already being a stand in for him.
---
* Windstorm is definitely good.
---
* Swift Hunt is nice, but the numbers aren't that good. 
---
* Bone Clapper is a favorite of mine. 
---
* The Ghost and Coxcombed Clapper are a great combo for sneaky play. 
---
* Blind Warrior is eh at uncommon (60 seconds of aura blindness inflicted with a surpirse attack) but the rare is legit decent (a Sloppy Butcher without requiring a perk slot at the cost of only surprise attacks inflicting mangled ans hemorrhage).               * Shadow Dance is fun, but only okay in terms of usefulness IMO. 
---
* Blink has decent numbers, but disappearance time is not too nessecary to speed up I find. 
---
* All Seeing at Very Rare grants 12 meters of survivor aura reading when cloaked while All seeing at Ultra Rare lets you see gen progress based on a scale of white (no progress) to deep red (about 1% from completion) when cloaked. 
---
* The Beast is to be ignored.
---
Not a pro, but I have been playing him recently and these are my experiences.
---
he was a professional in his own eyes and if you don’t call him as such he’ll kick your ass
---
Panie, zajebisty!
---
I played a match yesterday. I was being chased by a pig for 10 minutes (checked the time later in stream's archive) and I saw this one David standing in a corner of the map for all this time (thanks to my bond). when I finally got downed I just saw him standing in the same place, walking in circles, waiting for my death. after the match he told me "why risk doing gens when I can escape via the hatch?"
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
oh fuck lol. I swear I didn’t copy ma’am please don’t kick my ass this was a 4 am discoed meme w my friends
---
How is a BM timer a Nerf to survivors? Besides now the hatch spawns even if no gens are done.
---
I also did 2 gens this game and there was only one left to do when I started being chased
---
In-game ones? I haven't seen any yet. But there are some pics from the [official sneak peek BHVR released last month](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/58915/cosmetic-reveal-mid-chapter-2-7-0#latest).
---
SURVIVORS KEEP DC’ING AND COSTING ME MY ADEPT PLAGUE SINCE THE NEW PIP SYSTEM IS SO BUSTED
---
Accurate flair.
---
Although this is what a selfish person deserves, I was going more for positive reinforcement than punishing measures. Not a bad idea but I feel like rewarded for playing the game right vs punished for playing it wrong doesn't have the same effect.
---
In-game would be neat but just store display works as well, just curious as to how the teasers/leaks actually ended up looking.
---
When you see a survivor head to a window, wait for them to commit.
---
Skskskskks It’s cool lol probably wasn’t even an original meme idea when I made it. Just funny it’s not even a week ago since mine was posted 😂
---
I’m gonna disagree with that, A common misconception about the game is that the survivors are a team, you’re not, you may share the same goal but the only persons survival you’re responsible for is your own 
---
I get where you’re coming from, I did two gens and ran the killer for a further two, but died cause the bill who could have saved me just hid on the side of the map to try and get the hatch while the 3rd person was being chased (4th guy was dead)
---
Let's be real Freddy isn't the worst anymore, he isn't that good but I still think he beats trapper or pig
---
True. Maybe they should increase the amount of points for Safe Hook Rescues.
---
Its not as easy at just finding the mistake and fixing it and hoping it doesnt make more. 
---
It takes time
---
Someone told me in lobby yesterday my Feng Min outfit with purple pigtails and Level Up sweater along with jorts and leggings looked like it was from Fortnite.
---
You better damn believe I sandbagged them harder than a Claudette in a no0b3 video.
---
ok that one was just a typo lol
---
if a survivor has a key and can find the hatch, there's no incentive for them to help anyone. they just wait for the hatch to get closed, killer walks off confidently, then they open the hatch and slither away
---
But you'll depip from the penalty you get to chase points. You get penalised for camping.
---
And I play survivor and killer and can say its defo anti-fun to camp.
---
Even if it was just anti-fun for survivors, its everyone's job to make this game fun. If you dint care about other players and just want points then you're part of the reason this community is so bad.
---
They've had several days to find the bug now
---
I mean obviously one of his perks has to be ‘I Know What You Did’ not sure if they’re is already a perk that has this mechanic, I imagine they’re already is because it seems obvious, but anytime you fail a skill check whether that be a healing or gen then your aura is revealed for an allotted amount of time? 
---
Then perhaps for shits and gigs have another perk ‘I Still No What You Did’ with some other perk 😆
---
We're Gonna Live Forever stacks are always worth the sacrifice. Because my blood points are gonna live forever even if I don't.
---
Slugging 3rd guy is still a good tactic.. You can slug them till you find the hatch then hook that guy if he is still down, run to the hatch and close it.
---
It’s not one it only it works till the totem is destroyed are you about talking no one escapes death?
---
Wait, do you know what NOED does? Because 67% of what you said is wrong.
---
Next time, hit’em with that no mither unbreakable tenacity flip flop combo
---
Yeah. The critical hit mechanic. It only works once, you get one shot then you're back to regular attack strength.
---
Care to enlighten me then?
---
This is all really neat conceptually, but the reality is that against good survivors, it should just never work out that way.
---
&gt; Except at the start of those 7 seconds you could be literally breathing down their neck. Once those 7 seconds elapse, free hit.
---
Yes, if you're against awful survivors who don't react to the singing at all, and then spend 7 seconds running to a deadzone, it is a free hit.
---
Good survivors understand that an invisible Freddy still vaults slower than them and is stopped by pallets. So
---
&gt; Also, how many killers can comfortably get a hit in in under 7 seconds? Not that many.
---
A more realistic question is, how many killers can comfortably burn through a bad pallet in under 7 seconds? ...a lot of them, really.
---
&gt; Oh he's also stupidly good at slugging.
---
He's stupidly *terrible* at slugging. Slugging as a game plan requires you to actually be able to capitalize on someone trying to save the slug, not stare at them for 7 seconds while they get the slug up and you have to earn your hit again.
---
The "hit and run" dream world strat is a nice idea, but if you find someone doing a gen and sleep them without chasing, they have every reason to just boom the gen and move on with their life.
---
It's to make up for not wearing camo.
---
  
---
Side note how is it even possible to mess that up so bad? What are you paid to do?
---
It literally just does only one of the things you said
---
I HATE THAT PEOPLE DC EVERY SINGLE GAME. JUST YESTERDAY, SOMEONE WHO HADNT BEEN FOUND ALL GAME DCD WHILE THE GATE WAS OPEN BECAUSE I DOWNED THEM.
---
 ITS SO FRUSTRATING.
---
Instant buy for that Legion skin since I first saw it. Wish it had a bit more detail in it but it’s still awesome.
---
New doctor buff
---
TWD can fuck off if it's gonna be the show - Clem or nothing.
---
Hmm. I suspect you are making mountains out of molehills. You have to understand that there are people who take the internet very seriously, they believe there is no difference between this and the real world. You do not want to be one of those people. The internet is not a serious place and does not deserve to be taken seriously. This is something the younger generation has a hard time coping with and it seems to me that you are quite young.  
---
I too remember thinking it mattered at all what strangers thought but with time and the right mindset you do not have to care. Indeed, it is healthier not to care because you have to realize that none of us truly cares about you. We can't. We don't know you or your life and we aren't gonna learn anytime soon. At best we know you are emotional and you play Dead by Daylight.  
---
Speaking of Dead by Daylight; play however you want. People will get upset either way. I get salty messages from Survivors I save and from Killers who win. People just want to be mean sometimes. It's nothing personal.

Entity fuckery, don't question it, its always the Entity, it may not make sense, but its the Entity.
---
I wish I could mod audio files in the game to play [this song](https://youtu.be/VTsD2FjmLsw) when the EGC starts.
---
Teammate: Why are there five hex totems?
---
You move 4% faster and you have insta downs until the totem is destroyed, are you illiterate?
---
as others have said, this description [doesn't match No One Escapes Death](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_No_One_Escapes_Death)
---
No you don’t it works indefinitely unless the totem is destroyed. The movement speed can be the difference between a down or not.
---
Either five hex totems or three, but never four. Do they want to lose?
---
This is what it does:
---
"While this Hex is active, Survivors suffer from the [***Exposed***](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Exposed) ***📷*** **Status Effect** and your [movement speed](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speed) is increased by **2**/**3**/**4** %. "
---
No idea where you got the survivor outline from.
---
The reason why Survivors dislike it is it can be considered a 'crutch' for killers that arent great. A sort of "if I dont do well, at least when they've completed the generators I'll be able to 1 hit down them".
---
No outline, exposed all the time.
---
Wow, you're a terrible human being.
---
RANK RESET. THAT IS ALL.
---
I hope he's good and I'm really excited for him(/them?) but I am sick and tired of people on official forums/steam forums/dbd sub telling how good/bad he is going to be even though he's not even ptb ready.
---
Even then though, whats not to like about more bloodpoints? This is why I'm talking about a reward and not a punishment. If you help others, you get more points, if you don't you get the same amount of points. 
---
I guess it depends on your point of view. The way I play the game , I try to get everyone out as much as possible. If it is too risky and I risk my own life, then sometimes I'll bail, but never without trying at least. I feel like when it's feasable to help someone and you just don't, it's selfish and shouldn't be rewarded.
---
Sounds more like rancor.
---
Not the answer you want to hear but just stop caring about what people think about you.
---
Realise that as the Killer, you're supposed to do everything you can do stop the Survivors from winning.
---
As long as you felt you did good in the game and enjoyed it, who else gives af.
---
Im assuming ur a troll but NOED give infinite intsa downs as lomg as tge totem is active
---
It can take months to fuind a fix a bug
---
im waiting for the delete
---
Sounds like he managed to combine them. Still don't know how he got the second point though.
---
Mr X. NOW
---
You get 1500 bloodpoints per rescue. The same as a full gen. There is plenty of incentive to save
---
He's a good boy but he'd probably rage and flip the table when he loses
---
Trapper and Jason are the same as Billy and Leatherface
---
You don't get pips for face camping noobs.
---
Still no news on the Pig skins?
---
I couldn’t be happier to start playing her lol
---
This is rad! Fantastic job!
---
You'll never take me alive, copper!
---
It is but lets say 500 blood points per survivors or something like that. Just a lil extra for playing as a team and helping each other.
---
Not a matter of showing you, manchild.
---
You just need to accept that you are rude.
---
No one wakes up once in the entity.
---
No Mither = No Weakness
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

[They're streamers..](https://i.vgy.me/jp9Xku.png)
---
Yeah but that's if they have a key. It's not going to happen every match.
---
Same. Honestly Panda has been my biggest "teacher" for DBD. I would be completely worthless as a killer w/o his videos.
---
New perk! No One Escapes Rancor
---
There it is.
---
They're a company publishing and patching a game. If you think it would take them months to find a bug, then you're delusional
---
Ez hahahaha nice one
---
I think console only has the special edition, so I got everything up to huntress with it. Not licensed killers though
---
But actually it's Haunted Ground and then you get insta down.
---
JEEZZUS. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE HATED RANK RESET, SINCE I WAS A NEW PLAYER, BUT NOW I FUCKING KNOW - WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT AND HOW LONG UNTIL I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH DCING TEAMMATES OR DCING KILLERS.
---
Dude WHY DID THEY NERF LEGION STUN REDUCE ADDONS?
---
HE WAS ALREADY SO DEAD GAUD DAMN IT
---
You didn't answer my questions.
---
But of course you didn't, it'd be bad for you if you did.
---
1. Yeah, they definitely need to ramp up the punishments, losing pips isn't enough of a punishment for baby Survivors.
---
2. I don't care about your fun, you don't know what you're talking about. You also refuse to learn counterplay. I'm here giving you tips on how to beat Legion. You need to adjust your strategy accordingly. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER KILLER.
---
You're definitely a rank 20 or a rank 15. You seem to be forgetting that Legion has been nerfed. Or just can't do things on your own, always gotta group up...
---
I GOT HOOKED BY THE GATE (THAT I OPENED) AND EVERYONE RAN OUT INSTEAD OF RESCUING ME
---
reminds me of an scp... but  I can't remember which one.
---
OR he could just jump in. also, this person didn't have a key
---
X gon give it to ya
---
They aren't as iconic of Characters as Glenn and Negan and would bring in as much money.
---
I was thinking a cross between Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas and the nano-bot zombies of *Prey* (Michael Crichton) but that works too! 
---

---
That's an insane amount of detail. How long did it take you?
---
dude yes this is so good!!! should post on twitter bhvr might retweet
---
Super pumped to be doing this for Momocon in Atlanta next week! I have a bunch of props including the boomstick, chainsaw, dagger, Necronomicon, Ashy Slashy and even some DBD stuff like a flashlight! Gonna also be covering my entire top half and face in blood for that Prestige 1 look. :)
---
I'd be happy to give advice and show you some tricks if you're looking for it. Add me on discord.
---
(Me lol \#1136)
---
Ay yoo! 
---
Please add me on steam I need friends like you!
---
Oh i'm sorry, i got triggered for no reason, haha ...

K
---
Exhausted on the floor PepeHands
---
Alright I am hard.
---
I wouldn't call Ruin and BBQ buffed. It's more like they try to get the core aspect of a perk more consistent between Tier. I think it's more to make the grind more bareable.
---
THERE GOES MY HERO!!!
---
How exactly does this contradict what I said?
---
This is so cool! I'm planning on doing an Ash at some point too, where did you get the shirt and belt holster, if you don't mind my asking?
---
I blow my load whenever i see someone say "7 seconds"
---
Well I'm not sure they make sure it doesn't make more considering this glitch was made from the most recent patch
---
old yet recent, looking at the DC's
---
How’d ya make the mask? Looks great!
---
Same
---
SO MUCH THIS.
---
I WENT AGAINST A HUNTRESS WITH IRI HEADS, NOED &amp; RANCOR WHO FACECAMPED ME WITH 4 GENS TO GO, WHEN 2 TEAMMATES DC'D.
---
I KNOW YOU WANNA RANK UP BUT DAMN.
---
I feel like clown and trapper should be A tier, mainly because of the pinky finger addon and trapping survivors becomes more inconsistent in the low ranks
---
I’ve seen a lot more DC’s lately
---
 **I GOT FIVE LEGIONS IN A TOW JESUS CAN PEOPLE PLAY ANYTHING BUT THAT SHITTY ANNOYING KILLER LIKE USE BILLY THAT WOULD BE MORE FUN**
---
you have read the bible of cod gamers, i see
---
Its impossible. If you dont have angry survivors calling you bad and a tunneler or camper or hacker or lag switcher for no reason, they will be calling you bad, try to teach you to play and say gg ez. Ive done many tests as wraith were id play by “survivor rules” and i found the only way to make survivors happy is to let 1 or more escape when you could have killed them. If youre looking for a nice community where you can get tips and meet other people then you can join a community dbd discord. Otherwise I recommend saying gg and just leaving, its easier that way.
---
Legion and Ghostface?
---
Thank you!!! I did post on Twitter, here is the link! https://twitter.com/OnlyShapeshiftr/status/1128686466522079232?s=19
---
I mean, I can see dumb/cocky survivors falling for his antics... buuuuut no survivor with experience palying is going to fall for a camping cannibal, which is the only real danger that killer poses, he is going to abandon whatever poor sod is the first to get hooked and focus on gens. 
---
And if he evers get bubba on him, he will try to run as far from the basement as possible and play mindgames with the pallets and him trying to predict pallet drops to make him waste as much time as possible.
---
Great.
---
Honestly it could've been amazing.
---
Mercy Hospital or the town from The Passing (it even had generators already) would have made very unique and fun maps, and The Hunter could've been a very cool Killer with the right design.
---
Mercy is a mistake.
---
YES
---
Well this is a waste of time (looping and making gens)
---
Thank you! Wait until you see the finished product, that's all I can say! Stay groovy!
---
Thank you so much!
---
 I always found this movie surprising good and the plot is a bit unique. I think hed fit into dbd wonderfully too!
---
Cringe alert 🚨
---
Tommy Jarvis is the obvious pick for survivor, why Not Chris Higgins or Alice.
---
It doesn’t make looping a waste of time, just means they break the pallet faster or they usually lunge through the pallet, and if you can’t work through ruin, ur a terrible survivor
---
Of course! Like I said, I highly recommend that particular shirt... I feel like it captures the look and feel of the screen used shirt quite perfectly, and it comes pretty cheap and available too!
---
Not quite. OP was hooked and runs Borrowed Time (which would only activate if OP unhooked someone in Myers' Terror Radius) so the Claudette who unhooked OP would not have Borrowed Time active. Claudette is the one that died and did not have Borrowed Time active because she was not unhooked
---
Why not? It's not like you don't know where they are when they wake up. Besides sometimes you just get bad skill check rng.
---
I know how it works. It didn't take them months to fix other smaller bugs, but this bug is literally gamebreaking, so they should've began fixing it since they got noticed of it
---
Freaking love them ❤️
---
WHY DO SURVIVORS THINK THEY ARE SO PRIVILEGED?  YOU GOT CAUGHT AND DIED DONT TELL ME YOU "WORK IN THE INDUSTRY" YOU FUCKING KID. I DON'T PAY 9K A YEAR TO GO TO UNIVERSITY AND GET MY FUCKING DEGREE IN GAME DESIGN FOR YOU TO PRETEND YOU CAN GET ME BANNED CAUSE YOU SUCK AT A VIDEO GAME, IF YOU WORK IN INDUSTRY TELL ME THEN WHAT DO YOU PROGRAM IN? WHAT IDE? WHAT SDK? WHAT ENGINE? WHO DOY UO WORK FOR? WHAT CYCLE DO YOU USE? DUMBASS GROW THE FUCK UP AND ILL SEE YOU NEXT TIME WITH A FUCKING MORI
---
Not only does that survivor first have to have gotten a save themselves, which not only makes it unreliable but also regularly comes at the cost of playing time-inefficiently pressuring for saves just to secure they get their unhook, as well as hiding in the beginning so as to not get found first, therefore often not repairing generators right off the bat, but then there's also the circumstance that other survivors will regularly go for the save anyway, because they do not know that the hooked survivor has Deliverance. So unless they use their Deliverance right after being hooked, that aspect basically goes out of the window as well - and unhooking yourself in the killer's face is not usually beneficial, for obvious reasons.
---
I do think that in combination with Decisive Strike it is kind of BS: DS is supposed to protect you against tunnelling, yet with Deliverance, you can force the killer's hand, abusing DS offensively in a way it is not supposed to be. It should not activate on self-unhooks.
---
Balanced Landing and Object Of Obsession are more so "OP" perks in my mind, but fortunately only few survivors really know to abuse them.
---
&gt; But you'll depip from the penalty you get to chase points. You get penalised for camping.
---
The penalty is so small, unless you are facecamping.
---
&gt; its everyone's job to make this game fun.
---
Sure, but what do survivors do that makes my game more fun?
---
*i'm shocked too*
---
WOW this looks fantastic! Nice job do you mind if I use it as a steam picture? I'll give credit to you and just to make you sure my user is Dweet In Disguise
---
He needs some changes still, i wouldn't buy him yet. They nerfed his power in exchange for regular movement speed, there are far more interesting killers available to play.
---
You can run,  but you can't hide, Bitch!
---
If all you do is attempt to sleep people and don't give chase they don't have any reason not to just wake up on the spot. If you're giving chase, everyone else has the opportunity to wake up.
---
The best perk oh yeah
---
MoM isn't getting nerfed or changed in any way any time soon. BHVR gotta rake in dat P2W cheddar.
---
A medkit has charges.
---
You need 16 charges to heal yourself once without great skill checks.
---
If you put a syringe on  a yellow med kit(default 16 charges), it will have only 8 charges after, so you cant heal yourself normally since you wont have enough charges for that.
---
Usually you want to add more charges via addons to be able to heal yourself once before using the syringe on someone.
---
But be carefull put always the syringe on the first addon slot and the more charges on the second addon slot, otherwise it might wont be enough charges.
---
Greatly extended lunge and attack range after a short channel (growing rotting tentacles). Lasts for a set amount of time before tentacles rot off. Each stun received shortens the time. Once timer is over, get slowed for another period of time while recharging tentacle growth.
---
Object is usually only used to bring the killer towards you and the survivor won’t do gens so they just follow around the killer, so I agree people don’t use it correctly but deliverance by it self can still negate so much pressure from the killer. Like a 4 man deliverance(where even just 2 get it off) is a bitch to deal with
---
Just trolls trolling, I think that guy also knows he can’t get you fired from your job just based off how you play a game and your steam ID lmao
---
(Although to be fair you are running noed)
---
Susie is 18.
---
All the characters have to legally be 18 years of age or older because of the game's rating and content.
---
She's still a shrimp though, so her ages changes nothing.
---
Didn't have to use NOED they got to 1 gen left it was a fair game they were just salty
---
Malos?
---
THE EGC IS COOL AND ALL BUT CAN YOU PLEASE SPAWN THE DOORS ANYWHERE BUT NEXT TO EACH OTHER? ITS ALL END AND COLLAPSE BUT NO GAME.
---
I usually use the increased mend and the frenzy duration, The button that applies the broken status effect is pretty good because if you run mend addon + broken button it takes a long time for them to fully heal back up, you can even use thanatophobia or sloppy butcher to make it even longer.
---
But if you're even remotely compitent in chases you can end it before everyone wakes up and you lose track of them.
---
I now husband, me like.
---
Who runs calm spirit? 😂🤣
---
Yup. My friend has a 3D printer. Me and my dad made the whole model in sketchup and sent it to him. It looks sick!
---
Imagine the notifications when adrenaline pops, god damn
---
Oh I forgot to say that it looks really good so far. Do you think you'll have any issues taking it into a convention center b/c it looks damn realistic.
---
Wait, I thought the last update was that the original owner can keep miss Voorhees, but Jason belongs to the movie studio?
---
That's a big if though, given that the killer will know you're running No Mither. Honestly I want a No Mither rework. You don't start the game injured, and but you can't be healed to full health, and the broken effect doesn't show up. That way Killers won't know and make it a useless perk.
---
More like 2003
---
What fixed it -if anything. I cannot purchase aftercare.
---
I dont mind this. But the healing rate should be lowered. And be an obsession and have certain range you can get the notification
---
Roughly around that time. At least two weeks after the PTB which will probably start at the end of this month with the announcement about *that* new killer.
---
I would swap Freddy and leatherface and maybe some small adjustments but that aside, this list is actually very good imo.  That whole B and C tier  is very spot on especially since most tierlists are just some random midtiers because people have no idea how rank everything except top and trashtier. Good list.
---
Cunt
---
*Meg runs into a corner due to Hag trap's camera lock and gets immediately downed again*
---
My sweet safe unhook :'(
---
Oh, for sure. I'll totally slug a person to chase a 4th, but no need to be sadistic. End it quick and get on to the next match
---
Player "Freddy is the only F tier killer,  Behaviour cant make a worse killer then him"
---
Devs "Hold my beer"
---
And that's how Legion was remade.
---
Leon instead of Claire please
---
Not my cup of tea. I have nurses for that.
---
Plz.
---
whats-his-name. (the bad guy that does all this shit) cant even deal with Micheal in his head.
---
he *is* the boogyman.
---
Can I ask what's wrong with flashlight blinding in a farm game? Doesn't it give points? Kinda new so I don't understand how everything works yet. It just doesn't seem much different from when killers let you pallet stun them in these games.
---
There’s a certain part of this art that just ASSerts itself better than the rest
---
If you’re not from America then you just completely contradicted yourself
---
I don't think that you are just lucky, it's the same thing with the players i encounter. 
---
I have met a lot of people through dbd, with some of which i write or play regularly.
---
Spirit fury, ensuring... jUSt CHaInSsaW
---
I get it, but it’s weird when people think Freddy is really good, cause he’s NOT.
---
Is this a leaked cosmetic?
---
Yup, that's the main problem rn.
---
In a way it's a hatch standoff 2.0.
---
Real credit is @gamusaur or u/Gamusaur
---
Damn, I was hoping I would actually be able to buy pieces of the legion skin, I guess not.... Now I can only hope that the David skin isn't Auric only.
---
Why do you want wake up doe just look at where they spawn when gens are done. Even then it’s useless
---
Or maybe they did but couldn't do it practically since it's more difficult than photoshopping a picture?
---
So survivors go down faster, this is what I mean this is not that op but not that fun
---
In my opinion, it should be lower, escaping the March should be around 40%, I mean, if you count a victory for a survivor by escaping, so you count a victory for a killer for killing only one survivor? Thx for thé stars tho
---
I pretty much run it all the time, I don't know why, but I feel like I'm performing way better when I have the perk equipped
---
If it isn't too much to ask, I also saw the chainsaw on your Twitter, how did you go about making that?
---
Wake up has its uses, but the times it would come in handy are so miniscule, and that's why people consider it not that great.
---
It's always fun to try out new things, though!
---
I PLAYED A MATCH BEFORE I LEFT FOR SCHOOL AND THIS FUCKING HUNTRESS KEPT TUNNELING ON ME AND WAS CAMPING HOOKS YO. I LOST A PROGRESS CHECK BECAUSE THIS THOT WANTED TO CAMP HOOKS AND FOCUS SUPER HARD ON ME WHENEVER I GOT UNHOOKED. BULLSHIT FUCKING GAME.
---
Dang I never even noticed this, good spot I just thought I was getting less and less BP
---
WATCH HIM AS HE GOES!!
---
How long is the borrowed time effect? Would need to be at least equivalent to that.
---
A S S, A B S, AND  T I T T E H S
---
Few months away from my 3rd year with this game. Man so much has changed.
---
DBD seems to be a real gamble with random issues for different people and their PC's. Even with my PC which I put quite a bit of money in to play games seems to have problems with DBD, mainly having to verify the game through steam almost every time it has an update or patch and neither of my friends tends to have this problem.
---
Pig/Oink=upvote
---
Meg is THICC shes the only one I like out of the 3 in game tho
---
But, I am a rank 1-4 Pig.
---
Not to mention he has Pig’s crouch
---
I can’t 360 on console. I just seem to run then at last second turn right or left. It works sometimes
---
I'm usually not a fan of Dbd cosplays (a lot of people will just pick something like legion and make a paper mask and call it a day 😒) but this is dope af
---
So let me get this straigth , they hate legion for being edgy teens, but love the one that looks more like a teen than any of the others.
---
Not too much to ask at ALL! 
---
Rubie's Costume Unisex-Adult's Animated Chainsaw, as Shown, Standard https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078VFSQK4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_Bye3CbTB02E3R
---
I bought one of these and HEAVILY modified it using paints, thermoplastic, screws, foam, PVC pipe, and a lot more (as well as some clever rewiring in order to get the chains and sound to still operate) and voila! Def one of the harder parts of the cosplay. I may put a tutorial up on my YouTube eventually, but not certain as I want to move to the accurate chainsaw model in due time.
---
Thank you so much! I was eyeing that prop up, and I'm thankful for the confirmation!
---
I see what you mean, and I totally agree with it but it's not the one I was thinking of, I've seen it a few times and it's a deerskull with religious inscriptions in it.
---
Groovy!
---
Hey, you know, a cosplay can mean a lot to people as it can be a laborous thing to do and a lot of the time it's out of love for the IP or character, I get that some designs are a lot more simple than others so it may look much easier but you never know how much effort people put in. That being said, I love all cosplays and I can understand what you mean to a point but hey, I always appreciate the effort! Thanks for the kind words and stay groovy!
---
Why is Meg licking Nea's leg?
---
She is in my previous post doing just that XD
---
9/10 could use a chainsaw hand
---
Don’t pop tier 3 unless ur certain of a down. Until then stalk about 95% of T2 meter then when u want t3, stalk the surv ur chasing for the last bit of evil
---
You are my god. A super good pig. I’m a surv main but i always love a good game against a pig.
---
Can't run loops if they're exploded.
---
Disagree. 10 seconds. A bleed out timer should be short, especially since it can pause during the heal/mend, otherwise it is more an annoying than an 'oh shit I need to get away'.
---
forgive me I’m not up to date on my Susie lore
---
Billy: Did you just assume my killer's name?
---
every time i find out it's myers the first words to come out of my mouth are "oh for fuck sake"
---
Why not?
---
You're injured. You're the last one alive. The killer found the hatch before you and closed it. You don't have a key. I feel like it's fair at this point that you should be screwed.
---
I don't know, everyone DCs before I can catch them.
---
clem is way better than the people from the show wym
---
Everywhere on the web... and even if you were right 3 skill checks aren't really common in one gen, you can always hit great and I seriously doubt the animation of gen tapping is faster than 15%... Unless you're not gen tapping properly (and you're spending more time on the gen with each tap, in that case you may as well hold the button since you can get skillchecks anyway).
---
What did they replace it with?
---

---
Can confirm you still get a quitter bonus.
---
You don't deserve a free win because the rest of your team sucks ass... thats the whole point of a team game. You deserve a chance but you already got 2.
---
I would play Survivor more if we got Mista as a Survivor. 100% would buy cells for that DLC
---
Run NOED.
---
ANd depending on your killer, you might want to do different stuff, for example with leatherface, you pretty much have a guaranteed kill if you manage to get one, and if the survivors get salty, you might get the 4 of them. With Freddy, strop trying to hurt them, and put them all to sleep, before the last gen pops, so they won't have a way to wake up, then just kill them.
---
I like to imagine while writing that comment he had a clipboard and a notebook going down the list.
---
"Right lets see.... Legion check!, Crutch perk without context check!, Hook camp check!, i lagged this match so he is probably lag switching so lets write that too!"
---
Agreed, struggle is a stupid fucking mechanic. Instead of making me mash a button, just give me a button to submit, in case I want to kill myself.
---
I think that Glenn should come alone, like Bill or Ash, no point on having a human killer
---
Gatekeeping?
---
It's called a tree juke, and it's a legitimate strategy.
---
gg ty for daily
---
Mummy please.
---
I don't think he's amazing either, but not like really bad either. My main issue with him is just that he doesn't feel like dream demon, he doesn't do almost any illusionary stuff. Doc feels more nightmarish stuff
---
But also I am always triggered when people say they know the absolute truth about game balance but then can't really say how they measure it apart from just "me and other people don't like it". Different opinions about game balance are really important, you can't just narrow it to the voice of some specific group - that's how Freddy got nerfed in the first place.
---
GREAT!!!

aaaaa thanks ma lord!
---
I JUST WANTED TO BUY AFTERCARE FROM THE SHRINE.
---
aww, that's a real shame, that was the one perk i was really looking forward to getting but there that goes.
---
cheap legion cosmetic it is now
---
Dude I always get such salty survivors as legion even after the nerf.
---
Also, a tutorial would definitely be appreciated, but no pressure!
---
Whose the dude next to alien?
---
All the killers are human lol
---
^^oink
---
Happy cake day
---
She's used to licking windows, but there aren't any windows around.
---
That's even more impressive, I would have thought it would take much longer than that. Well done!
---
Negan from walking dead
---
So who’s this Legion? Frank? Joey?
---
It'd be awesome...But it would be difficult to incorporate him into the game with his artstyle. I mean it would be difficult to incorporate him into the game because there are 4 survivors in a game so he wouldn't be too happy...
---
I mean, a real human
---
wait they replaced wake up dang I wanted it
---
THANK YOUUUU!
---
Legion.
---
super I've always wanted quick and quiet
---
That could be the case. As of right now I'm level 16 since the season reset but im usually around rank 10-12 as a survivor.
---
Wow....cheating in dbd better uninstall. Right on it!
---
I like
---
Well say if the points you get for keeping teammates go into a category someone already has max points in, why should they worry about their teammates? They already got what they need
---
Survivors are just selfish and will easily sell each other out to get an escape. This is why teamwork makes killers frustrated cause even the most basic of teamwork give you great chance for survival. I love selfish survivors when I’m Killer, they do my job for me so I just collect easy kills.
---
&gt;All Mista Survivors DC instantly to bring the number down to a nice, lucky three :^)
---
Im not saying she isnt. Just that Glenn and Negan are far more recconized and we'll known
---
I know your feel.
---
I love playing legion but survivors would rather complain than actually learn how to counter.
---
All you need is a carburator tuning guide and a dream, my dude
---
EVERY. TIME.
---
Me too
---
There was an exploit with 2 of his addons (the blades can't remember exact name) that would basically make it so you had to mend indefinitely.
---
well its meant to be extremly hard and the Killer is the Powerrole after all
---
"He played good so i dont deserve a chance" Honestly even with the luckiest gate spawns theres still not a chance. 
---
Also, just saying, in the game im talking about he closed the hatch while i was downed and it gave me adrenaline
---
So first off run Adrenaline, once they close the hatch it activates adrenaline. Secondly they have wakeup in the shrine buy that with shards, that helps you open the gate 15% faster and you see where the exit gates are. Test that build out. See if that works for you.
---
I'm a guy
---
But uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I wish you were exaggerating but I've literally had teammates not unhook me in a freaking farm game
---
TELL ME WHY !
---
Obviously the killer will most likely find the hatch before you.. they can run  freely with no worries that someone is gonna smack them with a mallet...
---
Please follow my twitter [https://twitter.com/JJRoach\_Art](https://twitter.com/JJRoach_Art) if you guys enjoyed, I'm gonna try and make some more dbd fanart when I have time.
---
Facts even before mom it’s just billy nurse spirit
---
I always run adrenaline in this specific game i posted about they closed it while i was down so that was super helpful. It should just eat me up then and not waste my time. I might try wake up but w out it end game in this scenario is pointless for a survivor
---
Cool, but is NO one gonna comment on your Toe is longer than your fingers.  Get those socks and sandals ASAP.
---
Really doubt predator is getting in since he’s getting his own game now.
---
But I’d love for resident evil to get in ❤️
---
Yeah that and if youre injured youre loud as fuck w out iron will and if they have whispers forget about it. (i was downed when he closed the hatch so its not even like it was a fair race to finding it)
---
You say they cant do shit, but you don't even know how hard it is to program 'shit'. It contradicts you  because you're wrong about what you said.
---
I SAVED THIS RANDOM GUY THEN HE DIDNT HEAL ME AND GOT THE HATCH WHILE I DIED
---
"Our team lost the round and arguably played worse than the other party but the odds should still be stacked in my favour"
---
You were literally in the dying state when the killer closed the hatch, smh
---
Cleansing totem.  
---
Sex noises.
---
I'm pretty sure you can't post an image with someone else's name in it in order to shame them.
---
It reminds me of Infamous Second Son
---
Female characters stick their butt out when they crouch, gets me spotted everytime.
---
my favorite was the time I was huntress during last BP event. I figure she's not great at getting BP, but I have party streamers, so I might as well farm right? so I keep stopping during chases to give the farming signal, but this SWF doesn't get it. so I get 3 hooks for my multiplier, all the time giving the signal to farm at pallets. they still dont get it. so my third hook is at the end, near a gate. I let them open the gate in full view of me, dont throw a hatchet at the opener, and stay well away from the hook, just swinging the axe. they keep teabagging to distract me. I let them unhook, dont attack, and they all swarm to bodyblock the unhooked from getting hit. while teabagging. then they stop at the gate and all teabagged furiously, thinking they won. on the upside, I still got a couple long-distance hatchet down from them doing that, so I guess that's some progress toward the absurd trophy.
---
Is it me or is your index toe very long
---
Is her weapon really a broken ruler? Yikes.
---
The Legion skin is available for shards.
---
i've really been digging the recent uptick in positivity around here! Thanks for sharing

BANNING DC’ERS ISN’T GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM QUITTING. THEY’RE JUST GOING TO PULL THEIR ETHERNET CABLE, ALT-F4, GO AFK, OR SUICIDE ON HOOK INSTEAD.
---
I think you're hearing the noise of her going to one of the fountains that someone had used to cure themselves. It's her power getting upgraded so that it damages survivors upon impact
---
Glad you take critism and feedback well. I did this for someone before and they just sent a middle finger picture back to me for their terrible F13th the game ripoff concept. Also maybe change the name slightly cause John Wick is a popular movie and your character could be mistaken for that. however no obligation to do so.
---
The power being a gun would work in DBD. Having one shot to hit someone, and probably have an ultra rare addon for more shots, is a decent ability. I see it being used in close range in open areas or to snipe someone who sin't hiding properly. The killer will still be looped, but the power wouldn't be overpowered as long as the indicator exists and he goes through a slight animation upon activation. Also how long is the duration?
---
Now here is my attempt at generating perks via the name.
---
Eager To Kill and Fast( maybe just Eager To Kill to keep it short): Either after you hook a survivor you gain 5% movement speed and increased lunge distance for a short period, maybe 30 seconds, or after every generator that gets completed gain a token, each token provides 1.5% movement speed. Upon gaining 3 tokens gain increased lunge range. Upon gaining 5 tokens decrease weapon recovery by 20%. Even with stbfl you only gain semi machine gun at the end game, so a bit more balanced. With concept one you have effectiveness throughout the game, with concept 2 you gain more power at the end of the game.
---
Eenie Meenie, Miney Mo- You start the match with an obsession.  The effect of this perk activated upon starting the match and when the killer can move. That obsession's aura is revealed to you for 4 seconds. Upon hooking the obsession you generate a new obsession randomly and the effect retriggers. Now is like the children's game where you randomly choose a person.
---
Breath.Blink.Cry-Survivors who are unhooked are immune to being hit for 60 seconds. After those 60 seconds the survivor's aura is shown and the exposed effect is put on them for 45? 30? seconds. Based on the name they get a moment to breathe and then get to see the terrible effect and cry. Seems kind of tunnely so maybe the second part of the perk can only be activated after you hook another survivor. So the secondary effect waits until that is accomplished.
---
Anyhow hope this helps.
---
Nice cosplay and nice feet dude but why is there like 20 mile gap between your big toe and your index toe tho.
---
How on earth has no one in this thread mentioned "The thing"??
---
john carpenter owned so we know hes down for it (as he made myers), could add an extremely unique killer with a huge variety of potential abilties, and has a multitude of amazing survivor choices
---
Go forth and torture souls.
---
Even if, you can open doors faster with wakeup and your teammates can see you opening also.. i wanna run it so bad. But I get chased and tunneled a lot so I need my ds,dh,MoM,adrenaline. I literally had a trapper chase me through 5 gens. He got my down in the beginning. Hooks me I get unhooked he comes to tunnel me, I loop him then he gets me I gave him my d and we go on a long run while everyone else is powering through gens. I'm pallet stunning running him all over grim pantry.. I'm about to run up on the pantry get stuck in a trap meanwhile my friend is literally right next to me going through a chest and the trapper looks at her and i'm trying to free myself , at the moment he hits me I free myself and MoM kicks in and we are off, hes still hot on my trail. Theres like 2 gens left, I'm running him around the pier, and bam adrenaline kicks in. I take off hes still on me.. I'm running him my friend says oh heres a lit totem hang on a bit longer it was noed, the random is waiting at the door he has it 99 and here I come he opens and takes a hit and i tbagg him all the way out the door. Turns out he had an ebony mori and messed up by picking me up instead of mori me..   but thank goodness for all second chance perks or I would've never made it out.
---
Ive mentioned The Thing along with MacReady as a survivor but people say Thing wouldn't work
---
Been said a million times and explained by the devs but it's not autoaim.
---
What happens is when you swing you get a cone hitbox in front of you.
---
If that hitbox overlaps the survivor you get a confirmed hit.
---
After that, the camera gets moved towards the hit target to make it look more natural.
---
Autoaim would be if you swing, it's a miss, but the game the adjusts your swing trajectory to make it a hit.
---
Does relentless reduce the puke cool down?
---
&gt;This is all really neat conceptually, but the reality is...
---
I'm not talking conceptually.  I'm talking out of experience.  I've put probably over 200 hours in playing Freddy, and he's the killer I feel the most comfortable playing at rank 1 as
---
Your Drake? They aren't even cut out the same, she probably found one online.
---
\*CHAINSAW REVVING NOISES INTENSIFY\*
---
Seriously. Either reduce the cost of everything in the bloodweb or increase BP gains
---
Also a lore idea maybe the entity promises him the chance to see his family if he continues his "work". Although a big lie, a man after that traumatizing experience can reasonably be a bit troubled and see comfort in the thoughts of returning to his family. A good way to also tie in meenie miney mo is a nursery rhyme that he told his kid.
---
Not your hole...
---
Yep I just googled the pic lol since I've been seeing the memes everywhere and had an idea
---
I would wait til they gonna finally fix the bug with entity blocks not working sometimes
---
Sound has been absolutely trashed for months now. Spirit can’t be played to her peak because of it.
---
Weak to stealth killers with the injury music playing.
---
I don’t think so. I think OP just used the word the describe a Plague who is tunneling you. 
---
Please correct me if needed.
---
Not a lot of very rare cosmetics come with additional recolors, and probably for the better as they are pretty expensive compared to uncommon or common.
---
This is so beautiful.. I love your style of art! If this ever became animated it'd be on my phones lock screen :) 💕💕💕💕
---
Which we all 100% understand. 
---
It just stinks when you hoard shards (65000 now in my case) to convert 2700 to 250000 whenever possible, then you can’t :/. It’s like the ultimate tease. 
---
Then again I guess I really should shave shards for upcoming cosmetics, but it still makes me sad :(
---
This happened to my sister while playing yesterday, to the ace who sacrificed himself for her, you are a hero
---
Are there individual drawings for all of them alone?
---
So let's get this straight. Rank reset is good for high skill players to get to use their high skills against lower skilled players? Nope, we don't need rank reset.
---
honestly i main Killer so my Survivor skills aren't exactly mint but from a Killer's perspective if you throw the pallet down i have 2 options: backtrack around the pallet, or destroy it.  
---
most killers will destroy the pallet and then when they recover from doing so a nice beam of "fuck you" blinds them for an additional X seconds meaning that between the pallet destruction and the blindness you have lost quite a sum of chase points. in the time you took to stand there, aim your light and wait for the bonus points, you could have run off out of sight (Killer looks down when destroying things, remember) and hidden yourself while i wander aimlessly trying to find your now-faded scratch marks.  
---
instead you stood there like a twat waving your light in my eyes for extra points and now that my blindness is gone i can see your scratch marks and track you down all over again with the knowledge that you have a flashlight so now i can better prepare for your shenanigans.
---
with that being said it is NOT a toxic move, just one that i (and several others) personally hate (hence my throwing out the "imo" in my previous comment) and one i frown upon as a whole because most Survivors i've met in games are little cunts who teabag and flicker their flashlights to try and goad you into chasing them (not ALL Survivors, just the tryhards and, from what i've noticed anyone purple or red; some green but nowhere near as often). they're trolls, plain and simple, and i ignore them until i *have* to go after them (like if they're the last one alive) and even then sometimes i just let them escape because it's not worth frustrating myself to death by feeding the little bastards in the end game.  
---
what everyone seems to be on the "fuck Lamb3ntSpartan" bandwagon is the part where i say "shitty Survivor" which i say from experience, not from outright fact.  
---
8 out of 10 times when i get to Franklin's Demise a Survivor with a flashlight (troll or not) they fall apart. without their flashlight they can't blind me; i can break pallets worry-free, i can pick up dying Survivors without a distraction (body blocking cunts are another issue all-together though) and for the most part the one Survivor's entire plan is fucked.  
---
they cna try and get their flashlight back if they can find it but most times i'm following their ass until bloodlust gives me the takedown.  
---
overall, it is, IN MY OPINION (gotta emphasize that cuz some people can't fucking read apparently!) a totally valid albeit troll-ish thing to do. it isn't toxic, it's a mechanic that does what it's designed to do: piss. killers. off. and it works a treat cuz here i am, getting raped with downvotes cuz some Survivor mains can't handle the fact that they're being called shitty for using a tactic that requires no skill, and no effort  
---
and again, i'm a shitty Survivor in terms of actual skill; i gave up on flashlights and firecrackers and shit when i kept getting flooded with them by the bloodweb and they did fuck-all for me. i'm NOT saying to nerf or ban or remove the flashlights, just fucking chill the fuck out
---
Minor bug BTW
---
I like the idea of the first one but combined with meta perks like MoM it’s super powerful.
---
3 THINGS MAKE MALE SURVIVOR GREAT:
---
BEARDS
---
SHOULDERS
---
ACTUAL TBAGS
---
Bring a bound envelope to the match to flex on the killer
---
True, but honestly I don't see why they made High Viz Very Rare to begin with, given that it's arguably less detailed than Susie or Devil May Care Joe.  It could have been a nice new Rare outfit for Legion.
---
Facts
---
Prolly not very altruistic then are ya? 😂
---
UwU rawr x3 daddy legion bout to give the bulge

“The little mermaid”
---
If I see Feng I tunnel because she's a smol S Q U E A K E R.
---
Your killer main is showing
---
Mista could never be a survivor because he’d be in a group of 4
---
I wish this was in the shop already, I'm literally at player level 99 and I'm waiting for that to be released so I can play again.
---
git some darkness falls action in here. need my tooth mommy
---
That's the point. MoM is like the best perk and other than that you dont got ahit to fend off the killer
---
Sopa de Macaco
---
WHAT A FUCKING MELVIN
---
If you make the gates always spawn far away from each other that would be yet another change which would punish every killer in the game except Billy and nurse.
---
And then the next week we would have you complain how all you face is those two killers.
---
People like you are just unable to take even a tiny look outside their own perspective and think about what's healthy for the game.
---
You lost. A single round. To RNG, which is a core element of the entire game. Better luck next time, until then, get over it
---
Head on is actually really good paired with quick and quiet. It usually gives you just enough time to charge it up and stun the killer
---
I deal with this by just trying to hook everyone twice before they're mori'd, that way no one's losing out on points and they'll most likely even escape.
---
You're not obligated to farm just because of 4 streamers, you can just play nice instead. Farming just ruins the game for some people.
---
Not if I destroy the Hex Totems! :P 
---
Thanks tho! I'm having fun with the game. I just lose interest every few weeks due to the insane grind of bloodpoints required to enjoy fun / interesting combinations.
---
This is brilliant, make them DC without even using a Mori.
---
Mr x is a dope ass idea
---
Don't worry about it.  95% of stuff on here is reposts.  
---
And I don't mind this one cause it brings out some people that like to talk about the lore.
---
Hag is my ride or die, but this is making me want to git gud at Huntress.
---
You look more like human Shrek with Ash's clothes
---
Usually swinging a few times over their body the second time you down them helps. I'm acting like I'm so excited to use my "Mori" (Shroud) I'm mashing M1 like mad because I REALLY want to Mori them. Few swings and poof, the survivor is gone!
---
This is a 500 IQ play
---
Even at Green Ranks I've started to see the impact of Mettle of Man in killer diversity.  This perk definitely needs a hard looking at, because as it is right now it punishes you for playing an M1 killer.
---
That would be interesting
---
Sorry to disappoint but that will never happen as Nea already is the entity
---
i think they will never add predator... sad, but true );
---
Seems kinda redundant once a survivor DC's? Pretty easy sailing from there.
---
His numbers are acaullty pretty good. His Stealth acaullty lasts until he gets spotted by someone so it can last forever and his stalking only takes like 7 seconds
---
Huh, the new skin does indeed look nice.  It's a shame that they vault so slowly nowadays.
---
I'm honestly looking forward to the Clown Skin though, perhaps next week!
---
Bro, it was my potato survivors. Totally not me.
---
It lasts 5 seconds when your looked at otherwise its permenet.
---
So you might as well take advantage of it with *extra slow*, something Freddy desperately needs due to his issues with applying pressure across multiple survivors.
---
Imagine still making fun of Ochido even though he doesn’t play Dbd anymore
---
No human is that big of a whiny bitch. That goes for all four/five/six(???) of them.
---
Loss
---
You can watch some DBD gameplay so that you’re learning new techniques. Sometimes I do that if I’m in the mood to continue DBD-related stuff but frustrated with actual playing.
---
had a meg try this during a Freddy play a few games back. when I put her to sleep after her first hook, she DC'd.
---
not sure what she expected.
---
I agree, I believe also that should have been a cheaper outfit or at least have an iridescent shards option to buy it
---
this is amazing. SOMEONE PLS animate this!!
---
And M1 killers are already harder to play as it is...
---
Why play and M1 killer that will get punished by MOM when you can instadown with bubba or Billy
---
You seem to be under the impression that I'm not aware that I'm not funny in the slightest
---
Wish i could be lucky enough to have this happen to me
---
You're killing it with the shorts! I'd tunnel that. 
---
Did you make the puppet yourself?
---
I’m at loss for words
---
Well you are supposed to run it with a sabo perk setup... or at the very least with atleast 1 SWF member so they can distract and/or coordinate a bodyblock... Running flipflop without any synergy is pretty much a dead perk.
---
Hey you're the guy who banned me from the fourms. 😂
---
Since when does that sound last 5 seconds?
---
ACE VISCONTI: "AM I A JOKE TO YOU?"
---
Nice.
---
Yeah I've seen (or more heard) that one a couple of days ago on someone's stream. Was super annoying and I can't remember the last time I put off my headphones that quickly
---
Let's just hope the devs are aware
---
I I
---

---
Idk about y’all but I’m major Skyrim vibes from this
---
Think there is a predator game in production now which would rule him out? 
---
Alien wouldn’t really work because it’s super fast and climbs walls and shit - hard to implement with the models they have in the game today
---
They need to get Jason in there somehow, not sure what the latest is with the legal situation blocking it
---
What?! No your wack. Best load out by far is: Spine Chill, Urban Evasion, Bond, and Borrowed time OR Iron Will. Such a yummy load out.
---
WHY THE FUCK CANT I NOT GET POTATO SURVIVORS WHEN I RUN A MEME BUILD? HONESTLY FEEL LIKE I HAVE A TARGET ON MY BACK JUST BECAUSE IM ASH. 
---
# BECAUSE FUCK THE ASH WITH NO OBSESSION PERKS, AMIRITE
---
...ya tried :)
---
I can't tell if there actually is or if I'm being trolled.
---
HEY TEAM. ITS ME. THE FENG MIN WITH A FLASHLIGHT, DS, MOM AND BALANCED LANDING. THE ONE THE KILLER HAS BEEN CHASING FOR THE LAST 6 MINUTES.
---
IF I HAVE MAX BOLDNESS POINTS BY THE TIME I GO DOWN AND YOU DONT HAVE AT LEAST 4 GENS DONE, AND CAN'T BOTHER TO GET ME OFF THE HOOK WHILE YOU'VE BEEN PLAYING M1 SIMULATOR I HOPE YOUR GAME UNINSTALLS ITSELF.
---
I've got 3000hrs plus as a surv main and I just started using dead hard for the first time. What a fun perk! It's amazing at countering basement camping. I thought it was garbage bc as killer or never bothered me but as surv I'm making all kinds of fun plays. When I first used it i kept trying to turn around corners like to a window LOL. Took me a retartedly long time to remember dead hard only goes straight xD
---
Iron Will won't help him since he's always dead
---
All thats missing on that groovy cosplay are your long socks and sandals
---
# F
---
Sorry guys, we know this is important to a lot of you and we wanted to make sure we did it right rather than cutting it short just to get it out quickly. We're aiming for Thursday or Friday.
---
HOW DID THE GATE HOOK YOU?
---
I don't get why killers just throw the game to kill one person, smh.
---
When is this supposed to ckme out anyways, i stopped playing a while back and i want anothe reason to come back other then missing my bing bong boi
---
Nice
---
Well, he played with Cannibal, so it isn't a suprise that he got gen rushed.
---
New chapter today?
---
Solution: Revert the auto-cancelling of 3 man games
---
That's actually sick as fuck
---
STOP RATING YOUR PROGRESS BY PIPS AND START RATING IT BY BLOOD POINT GAIN AND SKILL IMPROVEMENT. IF YOU WENT DOWN IN 30 SECONDS ONE GAME AND THEN 40 SECONDS THE NEXT YOU'VE IMPROVED.
---
He's actually really nice to play against, as he has counterplay. Pretty fun to go against now that he isnt "How to tunnel 101" anymore.
---
Ellen Ripley plz &lt;3
---
Not losing posture, I like it
---
IDK FAM MUST'VE BEEN PART OF THE UPDATE
---
&gt;Hex: Epic Gamer Time
---
Oh no don’t say it ms obama get down
---
It is! The Adam and Clown one is very good also
---
It's supposedly the Freddy Rework, but not today
---
Heavy Death Metal Huntress confirmed
---
Reminds me of yogurt
---
Ain’t nothin’ but a heartache
---
If I do a daily for a killer, I just take off all perks and addons.
---
Too much. 
---
10 a pop, 400 Aurics a piece
---
Well, the dev update consists of several parts and the things that are currently working the devs. It is like a ROADMAP of the near and future things, next content that the game will have, and I hope that one of them in that ROADMAP will be some Freddy information, I hope there is more information to improve the game.
---
What a damn shame. Playing leatherface sucks dick, honestly. Can’t remember the last time I had a good match. It’s either all survivors are too smart to be overly altruistic or too scared to go for any saves at all. Very boring matches with and against him.
---
Aftercare and wake up are one of the only perks I don’t have yet, so that’s cool time to save up more shards....
---
I feel like i have to bring it these days, with all of these tunneling killers ive been seeing. The second i try to run a meme build, i get chased until all of the gens are done.
---
Oh I am very altruistic, but my survival is my primary concern.
---
I’M LOSING PIPS AT RANDOM THO NOT FROM PLAYING THE GAME. ITS LIKE THE GAME REFUSES TO SAVE MY PROGRESS!
---
Ahhh thanks! I had thought about that regarding the fatigue and the need to hit them twice. That was my apprehension about the buttons.
---
Thw game wanted you to stay at level 69 why are you mad? This is an accomplishment!
---
They'll wait for you to buy the first one before giving you a better one later. This is more optimal for making money.
---
Wrong claw hand. 0/10 would wake up again.
---
MoM is the new DS. It's not as bad as old ds but it's pretty bad
---
Really? I thought it was survivors who had to be at least 18, because theyre the ones getting brutally murdered, but Killers are fair game. iirc the Devs said on a stream they could have a killer who was an actual infant and it'd be fine. (correct me if I'm wrong though)
---
I felt like you’d be here...
---
Hex: Epic Gamer Time:
---
When two survivors are on hooks at the same time, Hex: Epic Gamer Time activates. The survivors have 90 seconds to unhook one survivor. If they do not unhook a survivor in this time, they shout the n-word, which immediately brings them down one health state (if a survivor is in the dying state when Hex: Epic Gamer Time activates, they instead get the deep wound status effect upon heal).
---
Autocorrect will be the death of me
---
so you can blame your lack of perks and add ons for your lost? smart
---
You guys are both wishing for something already in the game... it’s called walk up the the killer and get him to hook you. Or just go akf while you do your thing. Why must BHVR put in a specific function just so people like you can quit even easier, with less punishment, which other people will undoubtedly abuse.
---
I'm just cannon fodder on this game honestly
---
I could see that being a boring game, but you can still buy time for your teammates to do gens, and punish the killer by making him waste time on you!
---
Don’t DC please
---
@skemooo can you help me with a standing 4K front / back?
---
I get a bunch of extra downs on people who bring in purple gear. Got several people hooked when they were in the exit gates cause they tried to grab it (goes good with StBFL)
---
It’s not a bug it’s just the way they decided to make the perk.
---
Bases bro
---
Not all
---
Yeah, I mean they said they will only add “people”. 
---
I couldn’t find a specific term, but I think  an alien in an humanoid form could have more possibilities of being added
---
i will, i just can't stand it being camped. Sometimes when someone is face camping a teammmate is run like a savage to save her/him. but when it happens to me, none saves me..
---
I wanted to play that game but I was too scared. Must’ve installed and played up to the first scary bit 4-5 times. Same as Amnesia: The Dark Descent.
---
Yeah, i dont even know why they just changed numbers, its even more useless than before
---
X2 bro
---
Post game menus and maybe try a ticket in their support side? Not too sure on that?
---
It’s better if nobody comes to save you if the killer is camping because altruism in this case only helps the killer get more kills.
---
I would suggest running kindred so that other surv can see where the killer is
---
Combining perks makes most of them uncounterable. Most killers that use insidious camp by hook, Killer can also run Hex:Ruin or Huntress Lullaby with it then use the hook by the ruin totem making gens impossible to do while Survivors are being camped 1 by 1. I've used Sloppy Butcher many times and it leads a line directly to where the injured Survivor is and loud injured sounds making chases way too easy. Getting out of a chase is turning a corner if the Killer stops and turn away for a second. Distressing Doc always ends in gen lock and not being able to do anything in tier 3.
---
It automatically uses one from your inventory until they are gone. When I first started playing, I thought they didn't get consumed either, but it's just automatically using them if you have more than one.
---
Finna hack them hex totens
---
Well, when you are helped by some magical extraterrestrial monster, I guess fight get somehow easier.
---
Look at his left hand.
---
I THOUGHT INFINITE LOADING SCREENS WERE GONE!!!!!! THEY'RE NOT AND I HAD 3 GAMES BACK TO BACK WITH THEM!!!!! WTHHH!!
---
Had something happen like that. Downed someone at exit gate. It showed they left but I was able to pick them up and hook them. Both alive and dead schroigers survivor
---
Yeah I get that sometimes too
---

---
Oh ok lol

Alien is pretty humanoid as far as aliens go. So is Predator. Any more humanoid but still extra terrestrial and you’d have the ayy lmao green one.

[KILLER SWEAT INTENSIFIES] (/intensifies)
---
too long, didn't watch
---
ARE YOU DISCONNECTING FROM ANY OF YOUR GAMES?
---
I didn't see that stream, so they may have said something along those lines, but considering that Hag and Spirit are partially nude, I'd imagine the same general rule applies for every killer in addition to survivors, with exceptions given only to specific characters. 
---
As far as I know, none of the devs have stepped up to confirm Susie's age, so until they do, she's a legal adult by default.
---
Your cock is far too big
---
I mean you can hard tunnel a guy to death without needing a very rare addon. Very unfun approach as well
---
Niiiiiiice
---
Now we just need an animated version with some Waveshaper tune playing alongside it.
---
Nice play! Really like that risky altruism at the end.
---
It's joey, if you see the neon skin he is black
---
Honestly it just sounds like you dislike flashlight because of the disadvantage those give you, but that's exactly the point of a flashlight item
---
We need one for "Using Dead Hard against a killer with 200 ping" with the head exploded and brain bits dripping off the background.
---
Yah had a Bubba do this to my SWF 3 man during the blood hunt, did 1 gen and then went to the basement for hooks and heals, well needless to say bubba insta downed all of us after healing up and trying to run out of the basement after all being hooked twice and finished us off. But he sent a in game message on PS4 saying to run streamers and farm, so we had 4 total, 3 from us and 1 from him and then did that. I asked him wtf after it was said and done, he stated “Gotta Watch Out For Them Bubbas” the random solo guy told him to go fuck his mom and that he was a dick. I told him karma is a bitch. But yah there are some real evil scumbags out there and I ignore most farm request now and definitely stay out of the basement if we are farming.
---
what's the problem? it isn't like points don't roll over after you level or anything.
---
DID THEY JUST FUCKING RE ROLL THE FUCKING SHRINE?
---
I want Negan as a survivor
---
That's what I like to see
---
Doc is my main, and I always use distressing on him. I can assure you it rarely ends in gen lock. It's been repeatedly shown that ruin is best sdealt with by burning through it and fixing gens anyway, which is what I usually do. 
---
your comments suggest you are relatively new or not very skilled yet, I suggest you check some youtube tip videos, they are very helpful to new players on both sides; I recommend TydeTyme's vids to start with.

Same old, same old, toxic swf :/

---
If you really want to be an ass go Freddy and just follow the obsession without sleeping them. Since awake Survivors don't see Freddy, the obsession won't see your aura when a gen is done (Which normally happens with Rancor)
---
Once gens are finished sleep, down, and Mori.
---
Wait, console has no post game chat? That sounds amazing.
---
It's 2019, nothing is safe from infuriating woke scolds... 
---
Jokes aside, they've already commented that the struggle is specifically NOT a free pass to sit there. If no one enjoys it, then it's doing its job.
---
The Legion have all graduated no? They’re like 18.
---
Gurgles as she blinks through a pallet
---
Understandable, but I tend to see it a lot more from survivors. The DC’s just because they got downed are ridiculous, it screws over the whole team.
---
Some people are just unskilled assholes. I always try to make a save unless the Killer is camping with NOED or they force me through the exit.
---
A killer that makes remote controlled doubles of itself and explodes making the survivor injured... THATS PRETTY FUCKING COOL
---
I was just thinking that...she's literally underage. Then the OP comments further that he likes 11 year olds... what the fuck :S
---
Go to the linked video and read the info in the description.  'Unlucky' explosions never happen if you follow the described method.
---
That's the entire point of finding the maximum time you hold a 'tap' for and I've also confirmed that 19 or 20 is the maximum time for a tap.  The guide works.
---
Best thing to do is block them. People age really toxic in this game
---
I love using it but it is a meme perk :D I'd place it in the second or third best tier.
---
I saw the comparisons. The difference is pretty good and I have been able to lose/disorient the killer many times.
---
A few days ago, the survivor posted this video from their prospective haha
---
They won't be doing anything with predator or F13, predator has its own asym game on Playstation coming, and f13 just clearly isn't gonna work out.
---
I'd love to see Claire and Mr.X. His Mori should be the head crush animation in the remake.
---
And if he gets pallets his hat falls off.
---
Also maybe allow us to pick our hat back up and place it back on our heads.
---
I feel like if it counts towards NOED it should count towards Mettle of Man.
---
You can know where the killer is at all times(besides Tier 1 Myers). That is extremely powerful.
---
Kinda sad they stopped doing cheaper recolours of new cosmetics:(
---
WOW kid you just got r/WOOOOOOSHED!!!! 😂😂👀
---
"Wooosh" means you didn't get the joke, as in the sound made when the joke "woooshes" over your head. I bet you're too stupid to get it, IDIOT!! 😤😤😂
---
My joke was so thoughtfully crafted and took me a total of 3 minutes, you SHOULD be laughing. 🤬 What's that? My joke is bad? I think that's just because you failed. I outsmarted you, nitwit.🤭
---
In conclusion, I am posting this to the community known as "R/Wooooosh" to claim my internet points in your embarrassment 😏. Imbecile. The Germans refer to this action as "Schadenfreude," which means "harm-joy" 😬😲. WOW! 🤪 Another reference I had to explain to you. 🤦‍♂️🤭 I am going to cease this conversation for I do not converse with simple minded persons.😏😂
---
I used to think I’d never be able to 360 but one day I finally learned how to and I was so happy lol. Now I’m learning how to moonwalk! (I’m on console btw so that’s why I’m surprised I figured it out since there’s not a lot of advice on how to do it since most people who make content play on PC)
---
Exactly. It is an extra life for mistakes that people make. I honestly don't run it but it is consistently a life saver for people that use it.

---
Have you not figured it out yet?
---
I’m so happy I bought this game. I mean, there’s always those frustrating moments but truthfully I do like this game it’s a blast. I started playing February of last year so I’ve racked up quite a few hours lol
---
I don’t, because it’s so fucking boring. What I mean, is other survivors assume it’s insidious leatherface and be less likely to save. I don’t camp, it’s stupid. Why would you assume I do.
---
it makes it so all survivors suffer from the “exposed” status effect (one hit down) for 60 seconds
---
Still needs permission because it is their artwork. It is like a museum. A museum doesnt just take a piece of art and goes “here is this cool piece! Oh idk the artist though.” They ask the owner and source!
---
Gorno! Have you been turning my knives into Pokemon again?
---
*chainsaw noise intensifies*
---
Even if that happens, if your the last survivor and you still have your 3 chances, the killer is most likely gonna stay there and make sure you die since your the last one
---
I’d like to see you star in an Indiana Jones parody
---
L
---
While Nurse's is good for most of killers without faster healing downside... hmm... not convinced.
---
Yeah after thinking about it I don't really think it's that good anymore 😂
---
Just today for example, I’ve had countless games with billys and nurses rq’ing just because they lose their targets; wasting streamers, escape cakes, puddings etc.
---
I can agree though some of our fellow survivors do need to stop being so whiney and accept they got downed first though ;)
---
Is this a joke?
---
I bet that Killer was wondering wtf just happened.
---
The Loadout screen on the left will allow you to see your perks and assign them to slots. 4 may be assigned upon the character reaching Level 15.
---
To obtain level and obtain more perks for your characters, you need to spend Bloodpoints (currency earned in every match) in the Bloodweb tab, also on the left. Some perks are available to everyone and some (called Teachables) must be unlocked. In order to unlock Teachables (the 3 perks unique to each character) for everyone else, you must level that person. 
---
For example... Claudette’s 3 perks are Empathy, Botany Knowledge, and Self-Care. She can use these as soon as they come up in her Bloodweb. However all of the other survivors can not. It’s unique to her. But no worries! 
---
Once she is leveled to 30, an orange perk will appear in her Bloodweb for Empathy. Purchase that and now Empathy has a chance of showing up in all other survivors’ Bloodwebs to be purchased. Note that even though you will have unlocked Empathy as a teachable, you still need to level another character until it shows up and then buy it to use it on a non-Claudette. 
---
Once Claudette hits 35, you can do the same with Botany Knowledge, and at 40, Self-Care becomes available as a teachable as well. This applies to all survivors and killers in the exact same way. First perk becomes teachable at 30, second at 35, and third at 40. Therefore, in order to be able to unlock every perk in the game for a given character, you must level everyone to 40, and buy all orange Teachable perks in their bloodwebs. 
---
That being said, you can see how much of a grind the game is. (;
---
Fire up OP, please nerf
---
thanks for looking out for me buddy!
---
As a killer I make sure I offset DCs by farming with the survivors (after I gather the rest of my BBQ stacks). I don't give hints beforehand and play normal, if you DC after the first DC you don't deserve the reward for sticking it out.
---
I love using No Mither with a dedicated Sabo Build, what're you gonna do? Hook me?
---
Can you find that Video ? :)
---
I wish I could just buy a boatload of cosmetics just for feng lol also, these cosmetics look cool.
---
Has anyone else noticed people playing the game?
---
Kinda wish Legion kept the eyes blacked out, would have been much more intimidating
---
Skins still look sick tho
---
It's all good bud  :)
---
Ok that's fucked, even if it's a joke.
---
Hits off blinks would be too op cause then it’s useless against nurse.  But traps and frenzy don’t effect MOM anyways.
---
there’s nothing wrong if you’re the same age as her right
---
I don’t feel like the entity really is Satan. I honestly really like this theory but when it comes to lore I want to know more about the the entity itself. Where does it come from? Who or what is it? Was it once human like the people it brings into its sick and twisted games? Why does it need to feed off of hope? Where do it’s power come from and how did it get them? I just have so many questions
---
EGC was actually Wake Up buff
---
I'M FUCKING FED UP WITH DC'ERS AND THOSE FUCKS THAT KILL THEMSELVES ON THE HOOK
---
Escape rate at 50% means that the killer is getting 2 kills a match on average. 40% escape rate means that the killer is killing closer to 2.3 survivors a match.
---
Roughly:
---
80-99% = 4 survivors escape on average
---
60-79% = 3 Survivors escape on average
---
40-59% = 2 Survivors escape on average
---
20-39% = 1 Survivor escapes on average
---
1-24% = 0 Survivors escape on average.
---
I consider 2 kills about a tie, and anything below or above that a loss/win respectively. Though there is more to playing Killer / Survivor then escaping or killing, that is a decent metric.
---
Hey Survivors! Micheal here...
---
You can't loop me forever...
---
🤔
---
😤🤬😤🤬
---
Wow kiddo you got me good
---
*spins around tips fedora *
---
NOT ONLY ARE THEY DC'ING, BUT THEY ARE PLAYING LIKE TRASH OVERALL AND AS A SOLO SURVIVOR PLAYER IT IS SCREWING ME OVER. I JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF SHIT TIER SURVIVOR LEVEL, BUT NO ONE CAN HIT RUIN SKILLCHECKS. STOP RANK RESETS.
---
I could have gone living without clicking this
---
Looking at forum posts about it killers on PC seem to be much stronger than console.
---
She could be any of us !
---
Very true
---
you only need to shave, get contact glasses and you are perfect! nice cosplay
---
That means you’re doing the right job lol
---
I love it, but... his glove’s on the wrong hand.
---
at least it wasn't the jigsaw puzzle. i hate that map with every fiber of my being, no matter if i'm killer or survivor.
---
Me at the two survivors t-bagging every chance they can once I finish a perfect game.
---
As long as you have bloodpoints, you can buy perks. You just can’t pick the ones that show up, it’s all random. Characters get perks by leveling their Bloodweb and they show up as a diamond-shaped node on the web. Each time you complete a web, a new one is generated. Every web should have at least one random perk. At some point (I think once your character is level 20), two perks will show on each web with you being able to pick one of them. To get a new web with new perk options, you need to complete the entire web.
---
Here’s my main character. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/ySS0M9D.jpg
---
I wanted a perk called Flip Flop. I had to wait for it appear in my bloodweb. Anytime it didn’t appear, I had to just buy whatever and complete the web to get a new one. Once it showed up, I bought it. You can see, the black cloud at the bottom of the web covering my second perk choice. If I want that, I’ll have to wait for it to show up again in another web. 
---
Now that I’ve bought it, it’s in my Loadout and can be equipped for my next match. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/HsWnlbB.jpg
---
You shouldn’t be stuck with NO perks or anything, but you will have a semi-limited choice until you start leveling more people. There are many perks in the game that are not unique or locked to a certain character and you don’t have to do anything special for those to be available to you. They will show up in your webs over time. Check under the title of the perks and you’ll see when it “belongs to someone” and when it does not. The FlipFlop perk I pictured above is unique to the Ash character. However, if there is no name there, anyone can use it.
---
Keep leveling a survivor and it will make more sense. (;
---
I have no idea why this makes me laugh so hard.
---
And plag throw up
---
This has been covered so many times lmao.. People hate them in game, but like the looks and aesthetic. What’s so hard about that to understand?
---
Deerstalker OP please nerf could see them crawling
---
I mean just because people make art of them doesn’t mean the person who made it hates legion-
---
They only like Susie tho
---
Coolio
---
I suggest you take a short break from this game. That’s what I’ve been doing too, hope something changes for the better soon
---
Check the tag 😙
---
never knew No Mither can help you fully recover from dying state as well as no blood trail and reduced grunting noises.
---
Its pretty gimmicky, but It seems like an ok perk for a soloist or some meme build. Maybe some Tenacity No Mither Deliverance build?  ^(Was gonna say unbreakable but it also does what NM does. probably better to just replace NM with it.)
---
This is traced
---
Nvm instead of shitpost I hit fan content, fml
---
You're taking a joke seriously that's kinda sad.
---
wouldnt really call it a race 
---
killers are faster and dont have to avoid being spotted by someone trying to kill them so its much easier to find the hatch first as a killer than it is as a survivor 
---
the fact that you can close the hatch as they jump in and cancel their escape is just another issue with the hatch close mechanic
---
Yeah I have no idea how the hell they got so big but it makes me mad
---
It’s traced
---
I can’t find it unfortunately but it was tilted something like “why does the fucking hatch take so long to open” people where suggesting that he body blocked you on the stairs so he could of escaped.
---
It’s literally traced
---
No
---
I was so confused LOL I expected to see shitpost and feel like an idiot but nope. All g man ^^
---
“Ebony Moro would like to know your location.”
---
But its more fair when survs hatch camp and want other teammates to simply die. If they do so and killer gets there right or before the others die, i think i can call it fair that killer has upper hand
---
It's his right hand, not left.
---
Right but In this circumstance. The Survivior made it to the hatch first. They should be able to escape but in this circumstance they couldn't bc the escape was interrupted by the killer shutting the hatch
---
Was it added yesterday?
---
That would be a bit BS I think, but it would be interesting if the thing had dual powers like Amanda. One would be you assume the form of a random survivor in the game, has a constant distant terror radius while disguised, cannot emote, always sprints and automatically drops its disguise when it comes within X meters of a survivor that looks at it. In addition it could have a longer ranged tentacle strike on X cooldown to hit survivors right as they walk within detection range.
---
Well with skills being universal, yes smaller models give an advantage. Small but true. It's not opinion lol.
---
I mean so would I
---
It happens when someone's dcs just as they are getting hooked. Can happen on any killer and also can last the entire match
---
I feel like rank reset is a huge part of it too.
---
\*playing survivors ;)
---
Löng Ärm
---
wheres pin head
---
thank
---
yeah, that was what i had in mind. i think it would fit perfectly
---
WTF dude? why is the video taking only 1/12th of the screen?
---
Until you notice her leg
---
Really?
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhead_(Hellraiser)
---
this may help :)
---
YES! IT HAPPENED TWICE TODAY RIGHT AS I FINISHED A MATCH.
---
"Dwight. Where's the exit gate?"  
---
"It's right there, see, there's the aura from Wake Up!..."
---
"You were supposed to open it up while I was **hooked**."
---
"Dude, I'm gonna open it!"
---
"Oh really?"  
---
"Yes!"  
---
"So go to the exit gate!"
---
*Leatherface with fully revved saw waiting as the timer is halfway down.*
---
"...I see the problem."

https://hellraiser.fandom.com/wiki/Hellraiser_Wiki
---
This too
---
I WILL CHECK IT OUT. THANKS!
---
Fr fr. Saving up for new characters take forever. Oh whats that? A perk u want is in the shrine? Well time to level up 7 more times to regain those shards.
---
Laurie would definitely be in the first one, that’s literally her whole character
---
S
---
Report on website. You need full clip of entire match. Also report in game. You will get a response and if you have full I’m game clip he’s getting banned 100%. I’ve reported many jackasses to great success. I have emails from employees at BHVR informing me of the updates and resolution. They all were banned.
---
Mr. X as a killer is what we need. His pallet break animation would be a goddamn haymaker and his terror radius would be his stomping.
---
nea is actually suzie and is a killer
---
The top tier is a meme. Conglaturations!!!
---
That's what I was thinking
---
Aftercare is just Bond on steroids, change my mind.
---
Then put that in the title.
---
I like all the ideas except sab. Make it a new perk, and leave it at tool box.
---
They also said they’d never have a clown killer but hey.
---
Thanks, than i will buy Spirit, she looks fun
---
lol. I actually enjoy aftercare though. It’s not an S perk but it’s certainly nice to know where all your teammates are
---
I don't even have spirit fury
---
It's actually the exact opposite lmao instead of a 10 second post game chat you get 4 messages from a swf every other game flaming you.
---
a lot of people like frank and joeys design as well as susies 
---
its only jules people dont like the design of
---
No sprint burst either?
---
Well, if you have every character why is the change a problem? Just curious.
---
Pff, jokes on you, they probably have 2 dads
---
i actualy ruined my space bar on my old key board because of it
---
It was also posted here on r/deadbydaylight titled something like "Ash 4k render"
---
*suspenseful song intensifies*
---
Cool stuff keep if up!
---
I think it’s on of his best skins to date, the detail in it makes him look fresh.
---
A Xenomorph Queen would be absolutely terrifying... Except I guess in the DBD a pallet would someone still stun it?
---
Really ? My FPS is godlike since the engine update, I’m a standard Xbox one, I’ve even picked up nurse.
---
throws money at screen
---
Maybe its a ps4 exclusive problem
---
I don't know, I always assumed they did
---
What’s MoM?
---
I feel like thats how the game should be played to be honest
---
WE HAVE SUCH SIGHTS TO SHOW YOU
---
We know and so do the developers. They have been planning improvements to optimisation for this year. Planned to gradually improve different parts of the game to make optimisation better over all. They posted a roadmap for their plans. The latest their plans extend to is chapter 14.
---
Laurie continually utilised improvised weapons and made it a priority to *run* over fighting. She made a lot of smart decisions instead of fighting Michael head on, which is exactly what you're supposed to do when they have a knife and you don't.
---
But alot of killers refuse to hook the 3rd guy if the 4th isn't down still
---
nothing. it doesnt stay golden
---
Mettle of man.
---
Thank you.
---
i have definitely noticed an uptick in disconnects. my favorite theory is that people got so accustomed to disconnecting when they're unhappy with a match, that they're just used to it now.
---
I’d actually rather have noed and a mori for the speed and flexibility but I love rancor on wraith with save the best for last.
---
Oh well (:
---
I hadn’t thought of the fact every locker has Huntress hatchets in, even when she’s not the killer; until I saw it as a joke in a Samination animation. Like 4 v 1 all armed with hatchets pmsl :’P
---
I bring ebony Mori for my Mori daily and go for the 4k. Wym?
---
On that map from what I’ve seen, it usually spawns The for in the middle of the street
---
Yeah it's joey
---
I mean, in movement, when the killer is moving, I dont think just the lunge speed is enough for that jump.
---
The puppet is my favorite part, very well crafted!
---
Freddy is getting 200% movement speed and insta exposed status as soon as you transition into dream world as his buff.
---
How could 4 claudettes crouch towards you if your playing survivor?
---
Its not confirmed it will have map and survivor, but the killer is ghostface without doubt.
---
true
---
Legion is still cancer. But yes, I believe people are simply used to DCing without consequence.
---
Oh I dunno man, this could be anything /s
---
OH JEEZ I CAN'T WAIT TO FIND OUT WHO THE NEW ~~GHOSTFACE~~ KILLER IS
---
Stealth killers are the best imo, I don’t even mind losing games as long as I can make people jump; and I love being scared as a survivor too. DbD can be a fantastic horror experience &lt;3
---
*Four stacks of leader, hides in locker*
---
Agreed, but don’t lose hope yet, it’s as if you fucked up a skill check, woke up, and have a second chance my friend
---
Dragging on others for having fun on the internet is weirder
---
Ditto
---
**BOOM SHAKALAKA**
---
Dude I had 9 points in objectives. Lmao
---
"RNG" doesn't mean impossible. As with everything RNG there is an average case, and that average case is, you wake up pretty damn quickly from skill checks.
---
JUST PLAYED BILLY WHO STOOD ON OPEN HATCH WITH 2 GENS LEFT (NEAR HIM ON ONE END OF AZAROVS) UNTIL I FINALLY TRIED TO JUMP IN FROM BEHIND. 
---
HE BODYBLOCKED IT, CLOSED IT AND DOWNED ME WITH NOED.
---
YOU'RE FUCKING TRASH MY DUDE
---
Hahaha shushh
---
&gt;4 Claudettes
---
&gt;Oink
---
skillchecks arent affected by the killer's connection, just the framerate. even then, doing good checks instead of great is faster than looking for the totem. if the gen sparks, stop for 2 seconds, then get back on.
---
I think that's fair.
---
Oh I'm dumb lol piggy be creeping
---
I refuse to ship a teenager with a bunch of grown ass men and women
---
You and your friend *were* playing 😄
---
I dont understand he couldve went after my friend that instance. But he wanted that mori so bad.
---
YOU THINK YOU CAN TBAG ME AT THE GATES SURVIVORS!? IM GONNA LET DEEEZ NUTZ DROP WHEN GHOSTFACE COMES OUT, WINTER IS COMIN BITCHES!
---
I bet y’all can hear the song in your head right now
---
I mean besides the fact people like the idea of a sadistic gang of thugs, literally anyone can put together a legion cosplay. A leather jacket, some torn jeans or sweats, and any two-bit mask you throw together.
---
BIgDCkLoCkerBoy
---
Euh so Michael, Mikeeeey... I noticed you arent clenching a fist...
---
How about a quick stab and hook?
---
*breathing intensifies*
---
What are you talking about
---
Obviously you arent because I'm smart enough to just wait by an exit gate and as soon as they close the hatch start opening the door..
---
I agree it's bullshit. As killer I've started running Dying Light much more often to take advantage of it.
---
Didn't stop them from making Freddy
---
The Pig has a new cosmetic that could, at first glance, be mistaken for  a Claudette, especially when she's crouching.
---
One of there very feW
---
I feel your pain. Rank reset has been a nightmare. I mean...I was getting a few bad games here or there before the reset but now every single game I get is against a hard camping and tunneling killer. The worst part is that when I’m unable to get hook saves and the killer refuses to chase me because they want to tunnel I’m stuck at my current rank since I can’t get a pip.
---
I'd kill for a jojo chapter
---
Is that new huntress skin out?
---
I mean you have to move to actually lunge so I thought that was obvious
---
I don’t like camping but I agree with you there that it isn’t cheating
---
That's dope too mad i dont want to buy licensed killers in poor
---
The one true savior will have you now.
---
That's borderline depressing, if I'm honest. If every survivor knew that exact technique then the perk would barely make any difference if at all.
---
"Oh no he can walk forward that's 2 op duuuuuuud dev nerf or im going to cry"
---
I guess if you're not creative, have no hobbies and zero interest in costume fabrication and sourcing you would see it that way, and that's understandable to a certain degree (especially when it's apparent that you're ignorant to it) but why comment thinking I would care if you think it's "weird"? Seems sorta petty; just block me and other cosplayers you see and move on instead of spreading negativity. A lot of people love cosplay because not only is it a fun and crafty thing to do, but it shows your affection for these characters and is a great creative output/hobby. If you don't get that, well... 🤔
---
You have such nice cheekbones &lt;3
---
STUPID FUCKING FACECAMPING NOED USERS THAT ALSO HAVE RUIN AND BBQ WHILE THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT CRUTCH PERKS
---
Shucks, thanks!
---
Though legion got nerfed I still don’t like playing against him. I get why people are still dc’ing. Legion could use a full rework, even more than freddy IMO
---
Yeah it hurts the already not so interesting meta
---
I AM SO FUCKING MAD THAT KILLERS ARE NOW REQUIRED TO DOUBLE PIP AND KILL ALL FOUR SURVIVORS TO GET THE ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT. JUST GETTING A 4K SHOULD DO IT. REVERT IT. NEITHER SIDE SHOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE PIP TO EARN THE ACHIEVEMENT.
---
Wish I had a minion play the game for me while I’m at school
---
Are you playing on a tv? I switched to using a monitor a month or two ago and it made a world of difference. If you do use your tv, try setting it to game mode if you have it.
---
If we could get an Arnold survivor, I would be happy.
---
I ONLY DO SO WHEN THE FOURTH PLAYER HAS BEEN TOXIC OR ADEPT ACHIEVEMENT. OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T. I'M SORRY IT HAPPENS TO YOU
---
I am using a tv.
---
Thanks i’ll defo look into that
---
I don't play Hillbilly, but I want this part of the costume and combine it with his Ranger Rick one xD so he's a truly demented park ranger boi!
---
And if we're to add all the licensed Survivors, let's add "a police officer" in there.
---
of course I'm getting downvotes because you fucking assholes refuse to accept the truth. jesus christ.
---
Today
---
also its not making the circle so...
---
Is this a joke? If so, I can’t believe I’m seeing somebody complain about a perk that isn’t NOED or any other totem perk
---
I like these new cosmetics but I still think they could have done more with nea in this case, longer hair is one I keep seeing
---
So what do YOU do when one or two people DC? because what happens to me is the killer just immediately slugs/slaughters the two people that are left which doesn’t exactly give players any incentive for staying in the game.  (I don’t DC, but as a mostly Survivor main I see a lot of bad behavior on both sides)
---
Sometimes I wonder if there’s cheats floating around for this game. 
---
The perks are basically built in hacks, doing something like spawning next to a totem and forcing the killer to spawn across the map wouldn’t be hard and it wouldn’t even look suspicious. 
---
Makes you wonder, when the game is supposed to be RNG what are the actually numbers for a survivor being spawned RIGHT next to a totem?
---
Maybe 1-10 games but I’ve had 3-4 games in a row where all my dull totems were wiped out before the 2nd gen even. 
---
Just seems fishy sometimes.
---
I explained that in the post,
---
No it’s not...?
---
I LOVE WHEN YOU CHASE SURVIVORS AND THEY TAUNT ON YOU THEN YOU KILL THEM AND THEY MESSAGE YOU CALLIJG YOU TRASH
---
A 'Dying Light' speed reduction to repairs is hardly insignificant.  You're being hyperbolic.
---
MY TEAM IS FUCKING USELESS
---
 I feel like the Legion skin doesn’t hold up to the phenomenal art. It’s just so grey for a neon skin, wish it lit up or something
---
Susie is best stabby stab stabber tho
---
STRUGGLING IS TOO HARD FOR SOME PEOPLE!
---
Thank you, but I didn't make the puppet, it's from a company called NECA!
---
What
---
M1 killers: tunnel the non-obsessions.
---
survivors: surprisedpikachu.gif
---
Maybe.  But noone has the data to make a real statement on the average.
---
In my experience, survivors don't wake up super fast when I run Green Dress or Blue Dress.  And I can only talk from experience
---
Edit.  I suppise that's data I should research into.  Skillchecks per minute while asleep, no addons and each rng addon
---
That is probably the stupidest reason I’ve ever heard
---
And now she is here to *beep* us!
---
We already know pretty much everything about his power. 0 terror radius until someone sees him, with a 20~ sec cooldown. Can crouch to keep out of view better. Can quickly stalk to expose people for short time. He'll be one of my favorites for sure.
---
I guess she didn't know killers could close the hatch now
---
I remember looping a micheal around a rock for three gens before he got T2. As soon as he got it he walked away from me. When he came back insta T3 and hook camped. Was still worth it tho.
---
Right? Holy fuck talk about stupid.
---
I think it should have built in wake up and just show the aura of the hatch for 3/4/5 seconds when it becomes active.
---
So the most powerful perk in the game is locked behind a paywall...
---
HMmMmMm
---
While I agree that on a 1v1, if your opponent have a knife, even if you are trained, you still have a tremendeous disadvantage, the situation here seems to imply that they're going 4v1. And you can't just stab four people at once.
---
And there's also the fact that Susie's "knife" is just a goddamn sharpened broken ruler. I don't think it's as efficient as an actual blade.
---
There's still the Entity power-up thing to take into account, anyway.
---
Ohhh you’re right, you’re right. I still think that the new ECG dynamic is unfair, but I see how the survivor messed up.
---
Yea they are because Killer was host. Good skill checks will regress the gens which is why people get off and look for the totem it in the first place, have you even played Survivor before?
---
we're not talking about succesfully running away from someone with a knife, we're talking about fighting here.
---
as other commenter already stated Laure used many improvised weapons of her own and didn't try to fight him head on, just to slow him down so she can run away
---
I don't really know what happened with Freddy and Quentin because I didn't watch a movie, but I'm gonna take a wild guess that he didn't beat him in a fistfight.
---
The situation we are talking about is a trial in game, no improvised or real weapons for survivors, maybe some rocks or shit but it's a long shot, and where you usually do the logical thing and run away, but OP put in doubt why they are running from a girl with a knife and I explained that knife itself is enough reason to run. The best weapon you can bring into the trial is a flashlight and man, even if I'm ever jacked like David King I'm not gonna go 1 to 1 against anyone with a knife while having only flashlight in hand - unless, as I mention before, I had proper disarm training.
---
I haven't seen it in that spot specifically but on the shack window on one map I had the Nea vault it twice after the block animation was up. 
---
It's a bit wonky in plenty of places.
---
I feel your pain, yesterday I had a survivor message me asking me not to camp before the game even started. I'm not a camper anyway I run BBQ I had a potato game but still managed to get all 4 stacks of bbq so it was all good but then when I go to the exit gate to chase the survivors out the guy who messaged me asking me not to camp was teabagging and bming! Double standards in this game unfortunately is just a thing we have to deal with and move on!
---
Just wait 8 months for it to show up on shrine like bbq
---
Prob cuz a majority of people still playing is on PC
---
It’s probably “Very Rare” because it’s using the Joey model/animations, same reason his standard Devil May Care skin is “Very Rare”
---
There are only 2 options:
---
\- it was a weird bug
---
\- he was cheating
---
I don’t care to read that but why so offended?
---
I was thinking of all seeing - blood with the game or lery’s map offerings with cox combed clapper, but obviously they’re hard to get addons. Just needed something that’s not hard to get and can replace swift hunt as the numbers don’t seem to change much. Might start running bone clapper again as it does seem good, adds pressure but don’t know if it would work well in red ranks. 
---
Thanks for the suggestions though.
---
I JUST WANTED THE COOL NEON LEGION SKIN! BUT I CAN'T SINCE IT'S WORTH ABOUT $10!
---
It was free for a month with PS+ so probably a lot of people tried it (or tried to try it as the servers were frequently down when it became free ...) a bunch of times out of curiosity. Also, according to the "My PS life" video from end of last year my rarest trophy was Conniption which 0.2% of players owned back then, and it told me that about 10500 players had this one at this point. So even if the percentages are low, 40% are still a decent number of players that own Zealous.
---
except YOU are not MOST killers. 
---
Most of them WILL take advantage.
---
Every single 2+ killer game I was unfortunate to land in wasn't a "messing about" game. It was a tryhard bullshit game where they'd just constantly smack survivors to the ground. 
---
This post is bullshit, claiming they feared survivors would exploit it when killers were the ones who exploited the bug from their last video. Should have released both and at least evened out the playing field. If killers get to be massive shits, survivors should get to do it right on back. But they didn't do that. Therefore, their post was incredibly one sided, in favor of the killers. 
---
"Here! This is a thing you can do! We won't show you HOW even though someone will figure it out and post it. 
---
No, let's not show the survivor version in case someone exploits it."
---
Likely more so then the imagine dragons song
---
It seems they've ditched multiple variants of the same thing as they have with lower priced cosmetics. Seeing as everything now is 400AC and/or 7,200 Shards.
---
It's a real shame because having more choice is nice and the recolours for this outfit are a great example.
---
Loads have achievements on Xbox
---
Yes.
---
That's just the regular rarity now.
---
Or that you can’t grab survivors when they jump in
---
Well yeah but Zealous is an extreme outlier. The next 2 were 25 and 15. Everything was at the .1 which almost always means less than 1. Everything else was 1 - 3%.
---
I play huntress on Xbox one X. Frame rate is fine. I can go a little wonky when bloodlust kicks in
---
Blame the Bloodpoint Grind for that.
---
Yeah, it's really disappointing.  i get it for a lot of their more recent cosmetics, but I don't think it would have killed them to take a simple outfit like this and throw in some recolors.
---
RIP the idea of grinding out cosmetics, at least the ones we can currently get are still available as long as they don't pull a Doc on them and switch them to Auric Only.
---
I think the latter is most likely, I reported him for cheating just in case, if multiple people have reported him then hopefully it will flag up. Strange though, I’ve never come across cheating on PS4 servers.
---
Not only would this look good, it'd be a free way of advertising the cosmetics they release.
---
What does your Player Level have to do with these outfits?
---
This either sounds like a bug or devour hope. Considering you said his loadout had no perks, it was a bug.
---
Am I the only one urked by there being four survivors but only three survivors in the corner?
---
Oh wait, is that Nea? Makes sense now.
---
No prob
---
The All Seeing - Blood on those two maps are like a mini-scratched mirror Myers. Bone Clapper isn't his best, but it's fun to make the survivors jumpy when you uncloak halfway across the map. I sometimes use Blink, with Swift Hunt so bing bonging goes faster. Also, if you like Sloppy Butcher (I do) Blind - White is a good add-on. Basically free Sloppy Butcher so you can free up a perk slot or have a 5th perk in the form of an add-on. 
---
Also you're red rank? Well that kinda makes me giving you advice awkward (I got to purple as my peak before reset).
---
Sure we do. A generator has 80 charges, 1 second per charge, dream state halves action speed so 2 seconds per charge. Skill check chance for generators is 8%/charge. Somewhere between 8-9 charges (16-18 seconds), you're more likely than not to have experienced a skill check.
---
Self-healing skill check procs are even more likely.
---
Oh boy thats a lot of trash talk ;_;
---
Well have a couple upvotes! I play both sides but I dont consider it "genrushin" I as a survivor would like to live so I'm on them gens. As killer I want the reverse so I'm on them gens as much as possible. If they get a bunch done in a short time as killer I played badly or they played well. Either way it whatever I want my points. As long as I can get 3-4 hooks for bbq anything else is just bonus
---
Even so, she still knocked him out quite a few times and DISARMED him herself. Laurie is great with improvised weaponry so much so she has a whole perk dedicated to it. If these trials weren’t a video game I’m sure she’d try to use rocks and sticks and branches to fight back and probably would do well if the Entity didn’t stop her. You don’t have to be trained in disarming someone to win against someone with a knife, I’m saying you just have to outsmart them in order to beat them which is what all these characters did to beat their respective villains.
---
Far better than simply increasing the numbers like they actually did.
---
The flick? You know how Billy can spin in place after he releases his saw but the hitbox for instadown is only in front of him? The hitbox for the saw used to spin with Billy allowing you to "flick" your mouse left or right and hit someone beside you. I haven't noticed it coming back when I've played Billy however, I really miss the flick.
---
Its needs complete rework
---
I would play an absurd amount of money for an Alien chapter.
---
*Wah* is only made by one creature of DBD
---
Wake up is actually pretty good for EDC
---
You just found this out?
---
I love this.
---
You don't lose shards from devotion levels, you're thinking of prestige levels, and even then it's only perks, items, and offerings.
---
1) Whatever the survivors do is like... Not my fault
---
2) They are going to die too, don't worry
---
That’s awesome 😎
---
I could just imagine having an unlimited supply of flashlights and not getting a brown tool box every time when I have plunderers. Give me now
---
85% of the community is shitty people so its not surprising
---
OH MY GOD that would be awesome
---
Did he hook camp or was he really patrolling?
---
*vsauce music begins*
---
I would kill caesar all over again
---
What platform please mate?
---
It's sad bc it was and it is my favorite perk of the game it use to be sooooo good to Reach palets or vaults or straight up do clutch plays
---
YEAH MY STEAM PROFILE IS SET TO FRIENDS ONLY AND I HAD A FURIOUS SURVIVOR (WHO I KILLED IN-GAME) SEND ME A FRIEND REQUEST. I DON'T READ POST-GAME CHAT BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY SO THAT SEEMS TO HAVE ANGERED HIM EVEN MORE.
---
I'M A KILLER.... I KILL. THE GAME GIVES KILLERS A NOTIFICATION WHEN A SURVIVOR GETS UNHOOKED. I'M NOT GOING TO RUN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP TO LET THE TEAM UN-HOOK HIM.
---
PEOPLE EXPECT THE KILLER TO PLAY DUMB IN THIS GAME.
---
Same here
---
I'd think Laurie and Claudette would switch places.
---
FUCK YOU, DOCTOR!  
---
YOU AND YOU STUPID POST-GAME "THX NEA BUT DON'T FARM NEXT TIME"
---
YOU TOOK FULL ADVANTAGE OF THEIR OBVIOUS TROLLING WHEN SHE CONSTANTLY UNHOOKED US RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU WORKED SOMEONE ON THE OTHER TEAM, [WHICH IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/381210/discussions/16/1474222499230242023/) I HONESTLY HOPE YOU GET BANNED FROM THIS GAME, YOU MASSIVE SACK OF SHIT.
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
WHY IS ADEPT SURVIVOR JUST ESCAPE BUT ADEPT KILLER IS GET MERCILESS? SWITCH IT BACK TO JUST GET A 4K. THIS NEW PIP SYSTEM MAKES ADEPT KILLER  RIDICULOUS. ALSO WHERE IS BUNNY FENG AND RANK REWARDS???? YALL DROPPING PROMISES.
---
Never heard of it.
---
Honestly, I'm really appreciating that people seem to enjoy me trying to play up the horror. I keep trying to cut them off and pop out from around corners and surprise people, and I usually get good remarks in post-game when I do so.
---
If only the devs didn't make the horror so anemic.
---
Look it up it’s more violent but way better
---
“I’m gay.” - Quentin Smith.
---
So I guess Nancy is just a cover up.
---
Laurie has more of a canon personality than Claudette, and as a result, I based it from her Halloween 1 incarnation, who never showed any self loathing.
---
Claudette also had crippling social anxiety, so
---
I would honestly love to buy this as a poster if they would sell it.
---
I mean, would you want to date her? She has all the personality of a bowl of porridge.
---
I CAN'T FUCKING STAND THIS GAME!
---
WAIT, IS THAT A NEW COSMETIC?!
---
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME!
---
WAIT, IT COSTS $10?!
---
I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME!
---
Great idea! Except I think tribal blood is way too bad, you can get the same results with the perk “DC”
---
You forgot the pallet youre supposed to sit under for the majority of the game waiting for the killer to come hit you
---
I also did not take into consideration of addons because I feel a killers strength should be at more of a core level and not if you have good addons
---
I can't stop thinking of Legion saying "*I SMELL PENNIES!*" because of that crazy jump he's doing.
---
Except this wastes more time
---
I’d rather date her than a clone of myself.
---
Congrats, I now have a Kink for Leg Licking.
---
A wise decision indeed.
---
There are three addons that decrease skill check chance to factor in.
---
Interesting data nonetheless
---
Feng and David doing homework?  They'll soon having booze for breakfast than doing any homework. Feng probably fire up Fortnite while boozing away. 
---
Also, Laurie should be higher.
---
Wow, I wanted to buy both of these survivor perks but now they have replaced them with Quick and Quiet and Windows of Opportunity... two perks I don't want. That sucks.
---
Some of you may die for my 1000 points, but that's a risk I'm willing to take
---
I wasn't sure they were doing a roadmap for this year as it's later this year. 
---
I can't wait for the Freddy rework!
---
You forget when Ms Piggy was delayed by a day for PC players.
---
Except no he isn't. His power enables an easy first hit but to actually down you he needs to go through the hurdles of being a typical 115 movespeed killer. You can loop him for years.
---
I want Sebastian Castellanos and SafeHead from Evil Within.
---
There's also toolboxes and Spine Chill that increase skill check chance.
---
No, there have been posts about people being concerned survivors blood points have been low, we just hadn't found a cause until now.   
---
I posted about it myself but people said "Naw, it just feels like less because the Blood Hunt is over". So I deleted my post since nobody believed me.  
---
Turns out that I, and others, were right. Other people were being dismissive.

---
When else do we see the splash arts for skins. I never see them except sometimes in the store if they are being featured then never again.
---
They did a quick fix. It will pop up when you open the game.
---
This is the most satisfying mechanic ever implemented. After all of those dreadful standoffs where I'd go make a sandwich, come back, and the motherfucker is still tbagging.
---
Oh God not this again. No one ever said Legion was going to get a rework, McLean said they were going to change some things about Feral Frenzy. Thats it.
---
Now you can actually get hooks without turning survivors into living gen simulator. And his bigger base TR gives him better tracking than before, not worse.
---
Most players are enjoying the new Legion, lots of new Legion mains.
---
Sorry but the "nETFED TO oBLIVIOn" karma bandwagon crashed a long time ago buddy. Try with the Pig, better results.
---
Ooh this one is going to give my huntress kitty cosmetic a run for her money
---
I liked neon for the infinite sprint and almost infinite slow down
---
Hag with a chainsaw, you'd never fuckin see that comin
---
I'm getting BP's, but I'm not getting survival BP's for some reason.
---
I would love to see Alan Wake added as a new survivor. He could work perfectly in dbd
---
I mean he is so much better than what he was before in my opinion. 
---
Originally the only way to consistently down survivors was to exploit the deep wound mechanic which was tedious and cheap. The only reason so many Legions did well was because of the ridiculous nature of the mechanic &amp; survivors DC'ing during a match or killing themselves early on the hook.
---
Now with Legion, he is an M1 killer that can place groups of survivors into the injured state. Although he is no hillbilly I would say that he has definitely got some quality to him. Having everyone injured makes tracking much easier &amp; makes chases faster, similar to the plague. 
---
Feral allows him to apply split pressure really easily to groups of survivors by forcing them all in the injured state which applies heavy pressure for them to heal. Combine with perks like Sloppy makes healing a bit of a chore and a decent time waster. 
---
Definitely, wouldn't consider him useless.
---
From what I’ve heard, this is just a temporary fix while they work on a full rework. No confirmation though. 
---
Besides, with how broken legion was it’s better to nerf them than leave them. They aren’t good by any means, they just have no counterplay. No counterplay doesn’t make legion good, it makes them a balancing nightmare.
---
And here we go..... see here’s the thing popular or not... we are all allowed to have an opinion, you don’t like mine, cool. Can we at least try not to be an asshole about it? Thanks dude.
---
Agreed, solid point, legion is still ass to play though.
---
I like the game, I play Tinkerer Leatherface
---
In what world does Hag rank higher than Myers and Huntress?
---
I want to preface I only play SWF, most of my time spent on the game is as Killer. This is a gigantic wall of text, so I will leave the TL:DR here: &gt;!This playstyle of selfish survivors is either the best thing for the game, or the worst thing for the game.!&lt;
---
This honestly feels like Dead by Daylight's biggest success or biggest failure. 
---
There are two ways of viewing this, Dead by Daylight's objective as survivor can either be "do whatever you can so you survive" or "work together as a team, or die alone". They both come with many, many benefits but have their own major drawbacks. 
---
Tackling the "do whatever you can so you survive" promotes selfish gameplay in many ways:
---
1. Rushing for unhooks to fill out your Altruism bar for the sweet 8k bloodpoints instead of progressing the game and allowing people in a potentially better spot to get the unhook. I literally mean running across the map with Sprint Burst following the killer instead of continuing working your generator.
---
2. Using perks like Bond,  Diversion, etc, to lead the Killer to a survivor in a weaker position.
---
3. Full immersive gameplay entirely self centered to avoiding interaction with the Killer. This can be selfless in some cases, but usually you end up avoiding the Killer and splitting zero aggro. Sometimes you can waste a Whipers Nurse's time in the best way possible.
---
4. Full on sandbagging. This one is very rare from my experience in solo's/duo's. But it does happen. Usually it's them being a dick.
---
As much as we may hate to admit it, this playstyle made Dead by Daylight what it is. The toxicity of Dead by Daylight largely stems from this, and the dichotomy of Survivors and Killers disagreeing with each other's actions (an entirely other topic). And you know what? Toxicity has been one of the biggest factors of Dead by Daylight's longevity. I've been playing video games online for over a decade, and I have *never* seen a more torn and toxic community in my entire life.
---
But it's also hilarious.
---
Deny it all you like, it's really funny. It makes you laugh seeing people say what you've wanted to say so many times in end game lobbies. It makes this community what it is. 
---
This is not me condoning it, but I really do believe this very playstyle is partly to blame for the growth of this toxic community. 
---
Is there a better way? 
---
I have said for a while now that changing the Survivor bloodpoint system (and ranking system for whoever cares, even after the changes) to be more team focused is a viable idea. Your 32k points you earn together as a team, not alone. If only three of you escape, you only get 6k bloodpoints in the escape category. If one person gets chased for four generators, you all receive the benefits of that. It can even be made so that time working on generators is awarded double while someone is in a chase (efficiently using time). 
---
Hell, it could even be a separate game mode. This leads to an entire new set of issues, but I think over time we would see many problems plaguing this game weeded out. 
---
I would like to hear anyone's thoughts on this if possible, so I could potentially make a formal info-graphic or something similar.
---
He's just less anoying that's all... I found some legions that could eat my team's ass very quickly this week and also very... Not bad but kinda worse legions that couldn't get the 2k
---
He's C tier for me... Almost B
---
M1 killer means the killers power doesn’t help during a chase. For example, Trapper, Wraith, and Freddy are all M1 killers with nothing to help during a chase. 
---
As for legion, try to tag as many survivors as possible. Thanks to his new addons and bigger TR, Killer Instinct has a wider range so you do want to just tag and find another survivor. That’s really all I can think of, but I haven’t played DBD in a month or 2 so hey what do I know.
---
I get what you’re saying , but now he’s both unfun to play against and also to play as. Survivors split up and hit gens, on any bigger map you’re hitting one and then you have to run all the way across the map to hit another, wastes too much killer time, not enough surv time, know what I mean?
---
that’s why i’m thankful ps4 doesn’t have post/end game chat
---
Seems like this be a little more appropriate for trapper. Billy should have a belt buckle made out of huge deer antlers.
---
Honest to the entity I've meet more toxic survivors then killers and I'm a survivor main. Its freaking nuts and its driving me up a wall. 
---
I'm not sure if I can disable messages as I'm on Xbox.
---
When Nurse has infectious Fright
---
Stun time after end of frenzy is too long, the fact that if you try to stack the frenzy attack you get stunned, and even worse they slowed pallet and window vault times..... why?
---
I did and it explains nothing. You say they suck without giving a reason why and it just sounds like your bad. Tracking is NOT the best thing about them, never was. It was a bouns. They are meant to get A free first hit off then waste time while they chase for a down.
---
What’s your rank? I see a considerable decrease in use of it in purple to red ranks
---
Used to be 3-4 now rank reset went to 11
---
I’m sure you can. Personally I get immense joy from hate messages, but that’s just me. And yeah I get more messages from survivors than killers, I guess it’s just how it is.
---
1. It is NOT a free hit, it uses the power, and leads to a stun irrespective, if that’s the case then traps are a free hit, Billy’s saw is a free hit. Any power in fact.
---
2. Why are you so pissy about it? It’s an opinion dude.
---
UwU Iwm  gwonna pwouncey wouncey on your bwig bwulgey wulgey Nea-sana 😳
---
get the hand not the puppet,  or a the chainsaw brother
---
It does, The blue stripes glow in darker maps
---
Why?
---
Detective’s Hunch is GOD tier dude
---
Okay that’s much better than how it looked in the store then! I would buy it but I’m gonna swap my main soon
---
i really doubt hes cheating if it was on ps4
---
Hey now, leave Maurice alone, he's innocent
---
Damn no mor upvote foru
---
What was the issue ?
---
It's alwhite.
---
I love how he waited til he was right outside the gate to de-cloak
---
Yeah, the store page doesn't do the skin justice because of the bright campfire light but when I was playing in the Swamp or Macmillan estate, It looked so sick
---
if you think its bad now you havent seen what it was like a few months ago
---
Yeah, I've heard about the Dark Times.
---
Legion has been dissapointing from Day One and on top of being a low tier killer (110 speed made it impossible to get hooks, No Mither being your worst enemy is pathetic) it made the game boring for survivors, because you either got frenzy tunneled without possible counterplay or you spent the rest of the match mending.
---
Now survivors can actually play the match and Legion can chase and down with his 115 speed and his increased 32 m TR lets you track easier. You get a pretty much first free hit, use it to locate other survivors, injure them all and waste their time mending and chase normally the last survivor. With one hit you can cause absolute chaos, and his add ons now add status effect like Exhaustion.
---
Is he a good killer now? No, he is still a low tier killer, but thats because his core concept is disappointing. The changes were for the better for both killers and survivors.
---
Thats my opinion. Now, this is not an opinion, this is a FACT: Legion was never meant to get a rework, that was misinformation spread on this sub. The only news we got was a McLean stream talking about "changing some things about how Feral Frenzy works" and then the patch notes.
---
I don’t know how people still think that there will ever be a Friday The 13th chapter. Behavior said it themselves they won’t add Jason to the game
---
Shards don't get removed with devotion
---
I think it's mainly just the angle, but I have now learned to crop my monkey toes for future pictures, so this was a valuable lesson.
---
I like the idea of more loot-based perks, here's a couple simple concepts.
---
**Engineer**
---
You feel right at home among heaps of metal and scrap.
---
* Increases **Repair** efficiency by **10/15/20%** while using a Toolbox.
---
* Looting a Chest for the first time will guarantee an *Engineer's Toolbox*.
---
*"Finding the right tools for the job is a cinch, as long as you know what you're looking for." - Unknown*
---
**Light Bearer**
---
In the depths of this nightmare light still seems to find you, one way or another.
---
* Increases item efficiency by **5/10/15%** while using a Flashlight.
---
* Looting a Chest for the first time will guarantee a *Sport Flashlight*.
---
*"Light is the key, keeping it close can mean the difference between life and death down here." - Unknown*
---
The reason I have Legion so low is he requires good addons to be semi relevant the bottum 3 killers you will notice tend to take the most amount of time to "build up" to even be able to down a survivor, Legion is in the same boat as Freddy, their power is just straight counter intuitive to what a killer wants to do. Its never a good thing when a killer is literally punished for hitting a survivor.
---
Trapper just need to start with ALL of his traps then place them as he wants rather than having to go get them and boom he is balanced.
---
Along with what other people said, it has to be one contiguous chase. If the chase breaks at any point, the count will be reset. This usually happens when forcing them onto the chute, and they vault back before being sighted again.
---
Holy fuck I’m stupid we were agreeing the whole time
---
Just wait until the end game screen pops up then click leave game through there. If you hit esc then leave early it counts as DC.
---
LF Is too high, LF should be bottom tier, then Freddy above LF. Freddy is better than LF at the very least.
---
That sucks
---
Goodbye
---
Indeed, glad you're one of the good ones at least from what I gleam from here 💀💜
---
It makes me wonder if they had intentions from the start to troll or jus decided to mid match, like if they intentionally ran the Killer to my and my GF throughout that match.  Matters little, but I'm too damn curious.
---
I try my best to be good/decent as Survivor and try to save as many, on my main Survivor Nea I run We'll Make It and usually Borrowed Time just for those needed saves. Sadly some people grow up into being selfishly rude individuals and often it shows in video game interactions (almost like a social test)
---
Hope the best in the future for ya
---
Best
---
Track survivors, get a first free hit with Feral Frenzy, locate the other survivors and chain as many different Frenzy hits as possible, then chase the last one normally.
---
Now you have 1/2/3 survivors injured AND wasting time mending and you are in a chase with an injured survivor.

Use Feral Frenzy tracking wisely.
---
I'm just saying adrenaline is the only one that can be annoying
---
Honestly, now I would just be fine being able to play the damn game.

What perks did they replace aftercare and wake up for?

Ugh, that's dumb. It's 30 seconds from the moment the struggle prompt goes away until it loads the end scene, it's just so boring and unnecessary to sit through over and over again. Should at the very least be a skip-button. Anyway, thanks for the reply.
---
All the addons work very well but you just gotta double stack them unless it’s the buttons
---
Its like 10-15 seconds tho
---
Damn thats spot on. Im jealous.

Last night is the most recent. 5 bad games in a row.
---
Game 1: Pro nurse. Downed all three team mates within two minutes. I unhooked one but by that time she was on my ass again, and downed us both. Why even bother?
---
Game 2: Same fucking nurse. Enough said.
---
Game 3: Camping and nodding leatherface. Team mates go in for unhook even though he's clearly camping. Two hooked within the first few minutes, and the third guy is crouching nearby eager to join them. I wanted to ignore them and just work on the gen, but inevitably I have to go over and try to help. I don't need to tell you how it went.
---
Game 4: Another nurse. Different player but same results.
---
The fifth game was the drought breaker, but only because we versed a Myers who didn't know how to tier up and had NOED. Lol'd at that and escaped while he camped one poor team mate to secure a kill.
---
u/Peanits
---
Thank chief. I'll look into that.
---
The flying upgrades for video basically make it infinite as long as you touch the side of a building. I will admit the slow down is really nice but I like invisibility for video better since it can be an instant kill on most enemies besides the heavy guys
---
How so, Freddy is basically an M1 killer who has to wait to M1, LF is an M1 killer who doesnt have to wait and can chainsaw break pallets, and can 1HD a survivor or multiple in the right situations, By no means is LF  a "good" killer but he is far more consistent than the ones below him.
---
I can stand with that
---
Playing as Myers against an obviously deranking Voicecom SWF Squadette.
